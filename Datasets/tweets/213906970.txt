@sam_vinograd @andrewzimmern Find that attack on the President as obnoxious with a touch of ignorance. I don't know how you obtained your job, but if you worked in my company I'd terminate you attacking someone publicly without and factual sustaining information other than a Democratic VP said the same.
@BeingtheThe @maw921 @pushkinforhouse @washingtonpost @IlhanMN @FoxNews okay now I understand. Have a nice day.
@ThisWeekABC Democratic Party hierarchy is now control by Muslims who also control the purse strings &amp; now we have political violence. How many Democrats have their hands in the $ pockets of the Saudis? Mueller obstructed the 09/11 terrorist investigation in San Diego. Treason &amp; coup d'etat
@dansleezer @realDonaldTrump I helped write and edit the book "In the Mind of Mohammad" before you are "not sure" why don't you ask questions &amp; compare them to the reality of facts versus Islamic propaganda, brainwashing &amp; outright barbaric conduct.
@Criket2015 @maw921 @pushkinforhouse @washingtonpost @IlhanMN @FoxNews The oil men allowed Muslims into the United States without researching their ideology that reduces their mental thoughts into barbaric acts worse than Jim Jones. Compelled to "pray" 5 times a day every 4.5 hours clearly clouds their minds with brainwashing. Jefferson bomb Tripoli https://t.co/zjl6fCSFCz
@BeingtheThe @maw921 @pushkinforhouse @washingtonpost @IlhanMN @FoxNews What are you implying? Bush &amp; Associates received over $1.5 bil in Saudi contracts after leaving office. Mueller obstructed the San Diego investigation of the terrorists. Racism is the wrong word to apply to Muslims. Discrimination is the word. Islam enslaves the minds of all men
@SenatorCantwell Madam, I think you should resign. You propagate legislation such as IMBRA that is barred by the Constitution of the United States depriving Americans of freedom of association, marital privacy &amp; compels family destruction inclusive of parental separation from children. Treason!
@Acosta Mr. Acosta, even the President has the freedom of association. What makes you feel that he must accept talking to or answering any of your question by imposing yourself like a wart that won't go away. He don't like you! Accept that! Sorry, but wait for the next President to win.
@dansleezer @realDonaldTrump The minds of men being controlled by an ideology is mind control similar to Jim Jones. Praying 5 times a day (every 4.5 hours) is a form of mind control - to apply that to nations such as sharia law? Is that what you are saying? Enlighten me about your question?
@maw921 @pushkinforhouse @washingtonpost @IlhanMN @FoxNews Were the pictures discriminatory towards Muslims or actual facts of Islamic conduct towards non-Muslims. I reiterate that it's impossible to be racist against Muslims. Islam is represented by every color of mankind so to suggest that a Muslim is based on racism is propaganda.
@AlwaysActions Not to mention these students can go to religious schools like the Catholics do. School is NOT a church.
@AlwaysActions There is a separation of church and state. If individuals choose to worship they should go to their religious institution rather than disrupt classes for others. Or, they should use their time to study. That is the bottom line. The excessive prayers are a form of mind control!
@JKhashoggi @Walidfitaihi The facts are the USA does not recognize dual citizenships. If he failed to renounce his Saudi citizenship and returned. He is a Saudi. Sorry folks.
@pushkinforhouse The term islamaphobic was created by the Muslim brotherhood towards those who are versed in the ideology of Islam and speak out against it. Not with fear, but facts. Facts that those followers can murder internationally Christian children &amp; others who don't believe as they do. https://t.co/KtsmrGX97t
@pushkinforhouse @washingtonpost @IlhanMN @FoxNews The display is not racist at all. It is discriminatory without a doubt. Those who follow the ideology of Islam are represented by all colors &amp; shades of mankind. To apply the word "racism" to this ideology suggests ignorance or propaganda misuse.
@AOC Mueller threatened Cohen with his wife being arrested if he didn't cooperate. Mueller obstructed the 09/11 terrorist investigations in San Diego. He's a deep state elitist who shouldn't be prosecuting anyone. He should be imprisoned for treason. Considering all of the actors? ha
@JustinTrudeau Sir with all due respect, for Canada to allow extradition of  Meng Wanzhou of Huawei is a very serious blunder that China will punish Canada severely. Please reconsider. USA officials are NOT always right, many times are self serving elitists idiots with no respect
@NYPDDetectives @NYPDHateCrimes @NYPDTips @NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDONeill @NYPDnews @NYPDCommAffairs @NYPDChiefPatrol @NYPD112Pct And, by the way, "ZERO TOLERANCE" is an effective Nazi and Communist era policy. It has no place in the United States - think about it - for those who look into the Abyss may very well be looking at themselves. Outrageous!
@NYPDDetectives @NYPDHateCrimes @NYPDTips @NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDONeill @NYPDnews @NYPDCommAffairs @NYPDChiefPatrol @NYPD112Pct This was not a "great job" going after a boy writing on the sidewalk with chalk. Nor is it a hate crime. It may very well be protected "freedom of speech" regardless if you or I agree with it. A stern scolding from an officer of the law would have been much more effective.
@IlhanMN Universal background checks are a waste of time propagating elitism. Never in history has mankind been able to predict who's going to go fanatical &amp; violent sometime in the future. There is no prediction and classification is unAmerican - they do the time for crime &amp; reintegrate.
@RealSaavedra It is becoming more &amp; more clear that we have deep state elitist lawyers who are attacking every single person that they find unacceptable. This lady should be aware of that after revelations of a coup d'etat against Trump. These people are far more dangerous to our nation.
@billy4trump9 @Razorsmack1 @Serremmy @garway95 @nancy_hamm1 @CocoKAG @realNick_777 @RealWolf72 @NJ_2_FL @standuptoswamp @beatrizmacia1 @captainwife6699 @raynman123 @luvnewinfo @JudbrokatJudy @BigD_plorable @MattInman13 @ljermyn1 @Country21849663 @Dflorill Anyone who has watched videos from conception to birth: https://t.co/mqBExMeYG9 is clearly aware that the controversy over abortion is a woman's right to take a life that is not her own versus saving her life or other valid reasons for termination &amp; not as birth control method.
@SanhoTree @SecPompeo English is a major but secondary language to the Philippines. Many are not so versed on its specifics. It is inappropriate to degrade a politician who is in that status. He is trying his best and people know what he is saying. Leave it at that.
@Ilhan Attacking Trump is not constructive to the USA. The people are tired of the rhetoric &amp; will change nothing. Think America! Think providing Homesteads of 7.5 to 10 acres on undeveloped state and federal land for the homeless to build homes and take them off of the street.
@Ilhan Listening to  Farrakhan about the Jewish ideology is political suicide. But, confronting Congress with excessive allegiance to Israel may very well have merit as well as Sunni Saudi Arabia, a culprit that has intruded into our MSM and government. Be objective &amp; neutral!

@RashidaTlaib @OversightDems You're just a racist who hates white people, right?
@RepAlGreen Personally the racist tag belongs on you. You hate white people don't you?
@NSchneiderAZ13 @SenatorCantwell That is UR opinion but my natural conclusion which comes from research of factual scientific review will surely overcome &amp; prevail in the end. Maybe not this year or the next - but before the United States &amp; Europeans "extinct" themselves from the world - my opinion will prevail.
@NSchneiderAZ13 @SenatorCantwell Roe v. Wade was a law created prior to today's technology. The big question is does one human being through bad judgment (pregnancy) have the right to terminate a life that they created? Is a human created at conception or birth? My own natural conclusion now is from conception.
@NSchneiderAZ13 @SenatorCantwell It's all in one's perspective after reviewing facts. I watched fetus videos from conception to birth - that information changed my perception of abortion. It's murder of life, period. However, when it comes to women's health, rape, incest or child defects abortion is appropriate.
@SenatorCantwell I think Trump is correct. From the point of conception there is life. Protecting life is very crucial to mankind. Abortion should not be used - when terminating life as a form of birth control - because the life in the womb must also be protected in our technological society.
@twasulnews what is that?
@realDonaldTrump If there were ever a photograph worth a thousand words, it is the picture that is attached. Sir, you are dealing with an "Asian mind" - NOT AMERICAN. You must allow him to show face by offering something in return - NOT EVERYTHING but something. You did not &amp; the meeting failed. https://t.co/WMvLQKKTjx
@Ilhan Many Americans totally disagree with you. Indeed if he were to be removed from office after the coup d'etat was discovered, there would more likely create the brink of civil war. Highly likely for those who don't understand the real American spirit - which I am sure you don't.
@IlhanMN My God we have such supremacists, deep state elitists devouring the right to degrade and dehumanize another person who of all people - Mueller the man who obstructed the terrorist investigation of 09/11 in San Diego - who should be held for treason. What a bunch of degenerates!
@HavaBatia If you don't understand something it is quite normal to ask for clarification.
@HavaBatia Point is most Christians treat Jewish faith as if it is Christian because of OT without knowing all of their rituals  &amp; beliefs. The phrase "Lie to the Lamb" is a Jewish phrase meaning Jews can lie to Christians in matters. I read that &amp; my Jewish friend explained it to me. OK?
@Ximena74560472 @HavaBatia @Yousaf83 @IlhanMN What didn't you understand? You can message me for clarification. Yes, I am a writer. Presently writing a war movie - Battle of Crete - for a Canadian financier. He hopes to star Tom Hanks in it - deeply involved. I use twitter as a mind break while having coffee.
@DalePreuett @Ximena74560472 @HavaBatia @Yousaf83 @IlhanMN what sounds like lawyer words?
@Ximena74560472 @DalePreuett @HavaBatia @Yousaf83 @IlhanMN what disappeared?
@69mib Children born in Iraq or Syria that were part of the Islamic State, then the children are Syrian or Iraq have inherited these children born there. Why didn't this guy ask to leave the Islamic State way before this time? Why did he go there in the first place? to protect England?
@LindseyGrahamSC you're sponsoring sanctioning Russia which may affect our need for Titanium. How about sanctioning SAUDI ARABIA for infiltrating our government and 09/11?
@SenRonJohnson @LindseyGrahamSC @VP All sounds great but what about AMERICANS OVERSEAS? IMBRA &amp; related laws compel FORCED FAMILY DESTRUCTION, separation of children &amp; abandonment or EXILE for husbands sponsoring their wives when they have US children. I'm one of them whopermanent residency for family unification.
@AOC You're a public figure now. Get used to it.
@UkrEmbLondon @Telegraph Good assessment. People don't want fact news telling us what our opinion is. They want factual news to make their own minds up.
@realDonaldTrump I can't believe this Alva Johnson's stupid ass claim about some kind of kiss she received from you just exiting a RV? Allowing this woman 15 minutes of fame &amp; because she waste her $ creating a lawsuit on a kiss is so asinine any juddge would throw it out.
@HavaBatia @Yousaf83 @IlhanMN Christians have a misconception of the Jewish relationship to themselves. Christians don't know that Jews use arrogant elitism towards Christianity &amp; unspoken ritual, "Lie to the Lamb" is okay. That means they can lie to Christians. They are not Christian value but Jewish values.
@usernamer12 @big_bare23 @Yousaf83 @IlhanMN Absolutely I know what I am saying. Do you know what they are duping you with regarding their ideology? If you would like to clarify your remarks please message me.
@AOC You have some credibility to what you are saying, but many small businesses can't afford the wages that you are suggesting. Only major businesses can cope with what you suggest. Look for other alternatives that accommodate both issues such as the government paying a portion.
@IlhanMN There isn't such thing as Islamophobia of the Islamic death cult that deceives &amp; yes murders children in their endeavors.  Nor does your vagina provide you with such powers to commit slander and libel over men who are not of your Islamic ideology. That word for you is misandry! https://t.co/ZHNVGj0uNa
Special thank you to my 7 new followers from Australia, and more last week. https://t.co/EGauWnWbwq https://t.co/SImAPk9j86
@JeffBezos Jeff as a Washington State home boy - why don't you just say "fuck the East Coast" and open up your office in ABERDEEN, WASHINGTON? Or pick a state like South Carolina where no one would expect - We have some new deep state elitist Demo Party Muslim led elitists now!
@TorstenVeblen @SnowCalmth @UkrEmbLondon @UN I wouldn't go so far as make a comparison; totally different factors those islands had no people on them at the time of English acquisition &amp; they were a territory - but the colonization by Great Britain destroyed many nations. i understand where you are coming from but disagree
@IlhanMN Ilhan, please don't give me this bullshit about abuses of refugee children - WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN CHILDREN? IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS are forcing AMERICANS into EXILE, forced family destruction, abandonment, separation of children from parents because AMERICANS CAN'T SPONSOR WIVES.
@SnowCalmth @UkrEmbLondon Some truth to what you're saying. But you alone don't represent the entire area given to the Ukraine by Soviet communists without the consent of the Russian inhabitants of the disputed territories. This gives rise to civil war &amp; conflict unless a referendum is provided for issue.
@awri125 @HowardPeeples14 @HouseGOP @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @USATODAY The troubling aspect of your tweets &amp; purpose of twitter is to engage issues with factual and supportive responses to change or come to natural conclusion. It is not to attack individuals solely who disagree with your opinion. That is a tactical islamic method of response. Fuck U
@HouseGOP @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @USATODAY Demo Party hierarchy is controlled by Muslims holding the purse strings &amp; manipulating minorities replacing American/Christian values with Islamic political violence values. Some need to be charged with treason &amp; its only going to get worse unless confronted with this reality
@FDRLST I disagree with your assessment. They are both national representatives and of course NK has different values, some quite offensive. He has to deal with him &amp; bring him to the peace table. It will require him to accommodate asian customs of something face saving in return.
@HouseGOP @TransportGOP The Green New Deal should issue homesteads of 7.5 to 10 acres to the homeless from  undeveloped State and Federal lands so they can move off the streets, build a house, and help grow food to feed themselves.
@SnowCalmth @UkrEmbLondon I totally understand what you are saying and there is some truth to what you are saying. But, historically the Eastern provinces &amp; Crimea were given to the Ukraine without the consent of the people who lived there. This issue has caused problems in the region in today's world.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, just remember that you are dealing with an "asian mentality" which requires some form of "gift" in the negotiations - and you will be fine.
@Alex24439697 @LeeRoyWright @KendallJenner And your an idiot. Parents should keep you away from their little girls &amp; boys as not to taint their mentalities of right &amp; wrong. Stick to supportive facts in issues instead of attacking people. Thats a Muslim tactic
@Alex24439697 @LeeRoyWright @KendallJenner #metoo movement is based on criminalizing people publicly without an identifiable source or right to confront violating const. Law. Most are casting couch wanna be actresses doing auditions @ 2am in hotels. 10 in bed &amp; 0 on the screen.
@Alex24439697 @LeeRoyWright @KendallJenner Where the FUCK do you pull your opinions out of your ass to talk about my children? A stranger like you coming near. my children with your toxic mouth would be neutraluzed in the spot. Keep 2 topic &amp; supportive facts or Fuc*k off!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for the like - Women seeking an abortion should be mandated to see a video from conception to birth so they know what they are terminating. https://t.co/1uEEsYLkW0 It is called a human life &amp; surely an abortion is murder.
@SenatorCantwell https://t.co/1uEEsYLkW0 Being a "barren" woman &amp; deep state feminist elitist who does not oppose abortion, why not create a law mandating all women view a video from conception to birth before they decide to have an abortion. Live begins at conception &amp; abortion is murder.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP #GreenNewDeal - should include NEW HOMESTEAD ACT providing 7.5 to 10 acres of undeveloped state &amp; federal lands to homeless people to 1. get them off the street 2. grow their own food and 3. let them build a house as the new foundation of America like the old Homestead Act was.

@MarshaBlackburn @senjudiciary Mr. Barr is a deep state elitist lawyer &amp; should be watched with a suspicious eye.

@realDonaldTrump Didn't realize that anyone could secure abortion after the first couple of months. What I'm reading is insanity. As President why don't you SUGGEST that all women securing an abortion MUST watch a video from the moment of conception to the day of birth. Life begins at conception.
@DineshDSouza @Debber66 @foxandfriends It is my opinion (probably because of oil) but I think our nation (USA) is manufacturing this crisis &amp; should let the Venezuela people decide their own future. Tyrants come and go - sooner or later people will dispose of them.
@UkrEmbLondon The people of Crimea are Russian, Russian speaking, and Russian Orthodox. The Crimea was given to the Ukraine with a stroke of a pen by the Communists no one asked the people if they agreed to become Ukrainian. Ukraine is a great nation but reality must respect Russian people!

Go fuck yourself
@Pontifex Did it every occur to you that no priest can be perfect like Jesus Christ? Jesus said that to be a bishop that takes care of God's family he had to be a man of one wife and take care of his own family. Now why the hell don't you adhere to Jesus' wisdom which would remove abuse?
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump I read AOC's New Green Deal. It's never going to happen! But, China plans to convert to all electric vehicles in less than five years. He makes a deal with Trump on USA auto parts for cars that won't be allowed on Chinese roads &amp; Chinese government is financially backing it.
@RepAdamSchiff Time for Silent Disagreement? OK. Let's start with u who align URself with Saudi Wahhabi Sunni Royal family to attack Yemen. Same bastards who attacked us on 09/11 &amp; finance Democratic Muslim hierarchy. Russia is a diversion. YOU TREASON! Jewish lie to the lamb policy, huh? USOB
@JarettSays He has to be dating Kendall Jenner - their dresses are a perfect match for a perfect couple. lol

@LeeRoyWright @ZoeMsutwana Is she dating Billy Porter? They look like a match for the Oscars - lol
@LeeRoyWright @KendallJenner The #metoo movement would probably cringe with her wearing that dress and claiming she said, "no". lol
@AOC @MylesMill It's great that you don't give out your address because there are lots of creeps out there in the world - but you need to develop a better political platform. Socialism for medical treatment of men women &amp; children, education,  a plus, like roads for USA but with with Capitalism
@AOC @MylesMill New Green Deal - how about a NEW HOMESTEAD ACT giving HOMELESS AMERICANS a 5 to 10 acre track of undeveloped state and federal land to build a house and sustain their food supply. The original Homestead Act created a fantastic America &amp; provided opportunity. People need homes!
@FultertonAW @realDonaldTrump I don't disagree with what your saying. Big problem arises if Dad &amp; Mom were still in USA on diplomatic visa at time of birth. If yes, she's NOT American. If NO, she is American &amp; subject to arrest on return. Very Simple &amp; that's the law.
@RepAdamSchiff it's my personal opinion if the Demo Party continues the political violence attacking President propagated by Muslim heiarchy of your party that YOU &amp; they should be brought up on TREASON charges. UR dumber than a fuc*kin rock but dangerous.
@suepafan @SenatorCantwell My natural conclusion after viewing videos from conception to birth is that life indeed begins at conception. Taking that life with the exemptions of medical saving mothers life, rape etc. constitutes murder. Only monsters from the abyss would think otherwise.
@FultertonAW @realDonaldTrump An error about her citizenship is that her dad and mom were in USA on a diplomatic visa. So the big question is was she born while her family were in the USA on diplomatic visas or another visa? If diplomatic she is NOT an American.
@bestchris55 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo Maybe more true to that than you know. I'd like to see him put on trial for treason.
@gr8astro @SenatorCantwell I think your talking 9.9 on the o'shit a meter. I saw the videos of live from conception to birth my natural conclusion is life begins at conception. If there are any monsters in the abyss look at yourselves in the mirror after slicing life from the womb.
@gr8astro @SenatorCantwell My statement is NOT wrong. I've seen fetus videos from conception to birth &amp; it's MY natural conclusion that life begins at conception &amp; any termination of that life except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape etc. constitutes murder.
@hiltzikm Jewish journalist picking on America's John Wayne from an era 35+ years? Next you will call for Washington's name removed for $ bills for owning slaves and Jefferson for impregnating Sally Fleming @ 14. UR Jewish or American? Lie to the Lamb to undermines USA? Fu*k Off
@ProfImranAwan UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RULES THAT ISLAM IS HOSTILE TO AMERICA!	https://t.co/EPpQ9hPaR9
@ProfImranAwan I guess you could say tracked to be deported on the spot. Better than future generations of Christian children having their heads cut off, yes? Or, should we welcome them with open arms and hand our children over to them? https://t.co/gvu9uR2Vf5
@ProfImranAwan The United States has already ruled that Islam is hostile to the United States of America. If you were to ask the parents of these Christian children pictured then you would also realize Muslims are hostile to children of Christian families. They're murdered for family beliefs. https://t.co/AZozbkb7e1
@ProfImranAwan I do not believe anyone should be tracked. Those who provide an oath and allegiance to any other nation, conceptual or in fact where it is also their believe to replace any government with their own form and no concept of assimilation should be denied entry &amp; deported on the spot
@gr8astro @SenatorCantwell A dead fetus is not a living fetus. Using extreme to propagate uncontrolled abortions as a method of birth control under conditions tantamount to murder of a human being is abhorrent. Sorry no sympathy here for your argument.
@AlwaysActions It seems to me that she is propagating violence using minorities in the furtherance of Islamic domination in America.
@SenatorCantwell How would you know? You're a carpet bagger Democrat who wasn't even raised in Washington state.
@CatalystImp @horowitz39 Regardless, those acts created a nation for today's milliins. We can mope on what happened 200 years ago or we can makes lives better for the common man and woman of today. Nothing you say helps native Americans or today's  homeless.
@SenatorCantwell Women should be required to view a video on fetus development from conception to birth before deciding on abortion. I did and realized abortion is absolutely a vicious MURDER. Before I viewed the video I was pro abortion. Beware of feminists who have no husband or children. Evil
@ProfImranAwan That's great! Muslims should be tracked when dwelling in non-Muslim nations. Their allegiance is solely to their Imam, the Ummah Islam (Nation of Islam) and their citizenship is called brotherhood. They are at perpetual war against non-Muslims. Domestic enemies who are dangerous.
@ProfImranAwan interesting tweet
@AOC Why don't you submit a new HOMESTEAD ACT that affords 10 acre homestead tracks from undeveloped State &amp; Federal land where the homeless can build a house &amp; help sustain themselves with livestock and min-farms? That would help the people.
@CatalystImp @horowitz39 you have not made any factual presentation to equate transferring Federal &amp; State undeveloped land to the people in the form of 10 acre Homesteads where the homeless can build a house and help sustain themselves with livestock or agricultural products. This is a reality of today
@IlhanMN You need to address Clinton &amp; Bush receiving Saudi $ &amp; why the Saudis were not held accountable for 09/11 when all of the terrorists were Wahabi sect Muslims while Bush turns his head he &amp; associates received $1.5 bil in Saudi contracts after leaving office. TREASON.
@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Deep state elitist who needs to be purged. Next when electing a feminist is like Jesus told his bishops. Be a person of one husband and take care of your family first or you could elected a Feinstein who doesn't give a shit what you think unless you think like her.
@number2pencil1 @DLoesch No I did independent research and formulated my own natural conclusion. What sparked my interest was a notation on the AMA (American Muslim Association) website suggesting that Muslims "infiltrate" the democratic party. Then, I observed the hierarchy $ was now under Demo Muslims
@pierre It is important that nations of the world afford other nations to take on their own destinies from within - regardless of the consequences. Tyrants come &amp; go once the people have had enough. History repeats itself over and over.
@AP Alleged victims all under 17 &amp; he's 5 years cases from 15 -+years ago by girls groupees. Prosecutor using R. Kelly fame to make a name with these women getting paid via the courts under victim witness compensation. New definition of #metoo paid services for legalized prostitution
@mariss716 This woman is a great selection for our United Nation's Ambassador. She could have done a little better as our Ambassador to Canada but under the circumstances of how the world is and was during her tenure she still gets a passing mark from me - just an ordinary person.
@oldmandash Disagree with U. Y? Muslims give an oath of allegiance to their Imam &amp; Umman Islam (conceptual nation of Islam). Citizenship is called "brotherhood". Proof shown by the 10s of 1,000's of Muslims flocking to the Islamic State to fight. She has no allegiance to GB. She's Muslim.
@DLoesch Those behind propagating political violence that is replacing American values in politics has been researched &amp; identified. It comes of Islamic infilitration into Demo Party heiarachy that now controls the party purse strings. Sad but follow the $. A former Democrat.
@horowitz39 The reason America was properous was because of the ancient Homestead Act that gave people a place to stay, means of sustaining ones self and selling agricultural products. Now we have 350 mil &amp; no homestead act to get the homeless off the street. 10 acres they can build a home.
@revrrlewis @AOC Your dog is clearly a snuggle bug &amp; loves you - but with no offense he's kind of fat and ugly - lol But beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. lol
@Ilhan Planned Parenthood is topic that majority of women take on. As a man, brother, father, &amp; human being it was my opinion that a woman has full rights to determine a need for an abortion. New technology videos showed me without a doubt God creates life at conception. It's Murder!
@spkerofthehouse THAT'S GREAT SIR but R U out of UR FU*kin mind GIVING THE SAUDIS NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY knowingly after the Saudi Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam attacked us on 09/11 is nothing short of insanity or treason.  I'm Pro-Trump but NOT on this issue. Need to NUKE the Saudis!
@bestchris55 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo U must not have seen the photo of Bush kissing the Saudi king on the lips &amp; holding hands. Bush &amp; associates received over $1.5 bil in Saudi contracts after leaving office. Clinton got a bill passed that Presidents out of office don't have to state where foreign $ came from. Hmm

@FDRLST Beautiful region. The Green New Deal should be to give homeless Americans a 10 acre homestead to move off of the street, be self sufficient in food &amp; build a house. Not to keep Americans poverty stricken.
@AP President Trump is correct. Y? Muslims give their oath of allegiance to their Imam &amp; Ummah Islam (conceptual nation of Islam). Their citizenship is called brotherhood. Their sharia goal is to replace all non-Islamic governments She's a Muslim &amp; not an American or Mexican, Muslim!

@KimberlyMrsRR1 @ECHOtheCALL There is NO BILL that protects criminals. Lawmakers R 2 create laws where criminals do the time 4 the crime &amp; R reintegrated back into society. PERIOD. No registrations, no laws to recriminalize or enslave people. Lawyers R the deep state culprits legislating our enslavement..
@KimberlyMrsRR1 @ECHOtheCALL Haven't read the bill but AMERICANS must stand up our deep state elitist lawyer propagandists that use extremes to micro control &amp; create politically correct laws that are unconstitutional. Using these 3 topics to treat Americans like animals must stop. It's already gone to far.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, you want to sell the God damn Saudis who were responsible for bombing our people on 09/11 using their Wahabi citizens to do it &amp; now give them nuclear information? That's fucking nuts. If you want to give them a taste of nuclear power - then BOMB them!
@IlhanMN @repjohnlewis lol girl without a doubt, you will never win another election in the USA! Good luck if you do!
@KremlinRussia_E Do you notice how Greece an Orthodox Christian nation keeps its doors open to Russia? Expound on Czar Nicholas goal to protect Greece &amp; Future of EU while Turkey sends muslims into EU by the boatloads - future invasion plans. If you do GREECE will be your ally.
@KremlinRussia_E TURKEY plans future invasion of EU to protect MUSLIMS. Facts: Told Russia that it can be overrun in 7 days. Refuses EU decision not to accept Turkey into EU-Turks sends massive Hijra (jihad by immigration) jihadists to EU with no families. Future goal B4 UR EYES

@realDonaldTrump Roger Stone is having biased Judge issues. The presumptuous lady had audacity to threaten Mr. Stone to "shut up" outside of her courtroom. Where &amp; hell does her power to strip Const. rights from a person before trial &amp; judgment? He's afraid to call her a bitch.
@TuckerCarlson I think it's hilarious &amp; clearly shows you are just a human being with feelings. There is no need to apologize for emotions created by others where you just happen to express your real feelings about their comments. I will say it to him for you - Rutger Bregman go fuck yourself!
@AJGuglielmi This guy is a moron!
@IlhanMN WTF are you talking about? Did you review IMBRA &amp; related laws compelling Americans into exile, forced family destruction, parental separation from children? USA is supposed to be BARRED from interfering in associations &amp; marriage. Americans First - lady. Fix American rights 1st
@nytimes I'm American &amp; we all see how these so called "threats" are coming down. It's NOT the Russian Federation. IT'S OUR OWN DEEP STATE ELITISTS &amp; INDUSTRIAL-MILITARY COMPLEX. We are so duped and integrated into Saudi Foreign policies we divert our own people to appease the bastards.
@AmbJohnBolton The Miskitu Government in Exile ie: Rev. Josephenie E. Robertson has a lawsuit against Ortega for genocide against her people - in a federal United States court. Interesting.
@CassandraRules Woman swore allegiance oath to Imam &amp; conceptual Ummah Islam (nation of islam). Citizenship is called "brotherhood". She is NOT an American.

@FultertonAW @realDonaldTrump Truth to what you say &amp; 2 ways of thinking. 1. ISIS or otherwise if born in USA must be allowed to return. 2.

@realDonaldTrump the deep state elitists which constitute our "LAWYERS" in America holding NON-ELECTED positions NEED TO BE PURGED from government ASAP &amp; may be the very reason of a future civil war. Extremists who believe in their own supremacy. DANGEROUS.
@realDonaldTrump The WALL is about the ONLY issue I disagree with you on sir. Saudi Wahhabi Muslim terrorists attacked on 09/11 &amp; NOT Catholic Mexicans. Ban the MUSLIMS sir. We will need the Catholics on the front lines in the future civil war.
@realDonaldTrump understand UR concerns of this ISIS bride's "remorse" appears after the last battle of the war &amp; she is captured. I'm American too. If she's born in USA she MUST be allowed to RETURN &amp;IMPRISON HER OR recognize her oath of allegiance to Ummah Islam &amp;  USA citizenship not valid.
@SecPompeo This's convoluted issue: She's born in USA &amp; must be allowed to return under all conditions, You can imprison her. 2. Muslims swear an allegiance to their Imam &amp; conceptual "Nation of Islam" (Ummah Islam), Citizenship is called brotherhood.  USA citizenship NOT valid.

@PatriotPure I still feel for many school that a uniform for the children as well as the teachers would afford instant recognition during a crucial time of potential violence. Also, an alarm "button" in the hallway that can activate to alert a police station of violence would also help.

@LisaSchuman8 @Louise212nyc2 @rweingarten @DNC Who retreats Trump?
@TulsiGabbard What America needs is a new HOMESTEAD Act giving Americans 10 to 15 acres to get off the street build a home and food.
@tjungarayi @abcnews I think you're talking shit. lol
@UkrEmbLondon It would be best that you made peace with Russia &amp; allow those provinces that are former Russian territory with Russian Orthodox Russians who speak Russian to go back to being part of Russia. If you don't and pursue a course of confrontation in a war Ukraine will cease to exist.
@IlhanMN Your allegiance is to your Imam and the Ummah Islam or perceptual nation of Islam. How can U be a representative in the United States government when UR very ideology is to destroy it &amp; replace it with sharia law. Shame on you. You should be arrested &amp; charged with domestic enemy
@PatriotPure Taught college business English
@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC Sounding an alarm? As a neutral American &amp; Democrat from what I see is a God damn coup d'etat by non-elected officials in our government who should be arrested, indicted and put on trial for treason for undermining the Presidency of the United States. Deep State Elitists are bad!
@UberDick @Trey_VonDinkis @rakri99 @gex_daniel She has to be voted out. And she is representing an area where the United States settled Muslim refugees. Good luck.
@RJRosenstein Very serious allegations against you regarding an attempted coup d'etat which is a treasonable offense considering you are a non-elected official. Maybe you should prepare yourself for an arrest and prison?
@CNN Black, White &amp; every other color of American when students should all be afforded a free school lunch - period.
@RealSaavedra Very simple safety standards - all students &amp; teachers wear a school uniform. Those who come to school without are subject to interview and denial to come into school.
@abcnews This may very well have problematic results of innocent people being charged and innocent families targeted without no evidence by outside intrusions based upon suspicion - such as a child's behavior change at school - after Dad &amp; Mom caught them stealing $ from the cookie jar.
@StyggeStigge14 I think mainstream media is just preparing Swedes for the Muslim takeover of your nation after they rape all of the women. Of course their babies will be dark skinned with blue eyes - as a natural result. lol

@MullahOsk @davidwebbshow @IlhanMN No, I mean attacks on innocent people by Islamic State terrorists such as beheading Christian children because of their family faith. Don't act stupid. If this conduct is your custom &amp; teachings, just say so. Don't hide by claiming innocence or passing the blame of intolerance. https://t.co/EzYLlXI1cq
@AnissaNow @facebook @CNN @AtlanticCouncil This is a very sad day for freedom of speech. The United States has always found a manner of propaganda into other nations such as funding Voice of America and other speech related entities. Partial funding any business entity by a government is very common.
@MullahOsk @davidwebbshow @IlhanMN No, I mean by Islamic State terrorists Beheading the children. Don't act stupid. If this is yuk our customs &amp; teachings then say so.
@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Why isn't Trump terminating Mueller &amp; charging all 3 with coup d'etat treason. It's so obvious
@AOC You forget that rich or not he was leaving some of his money in the town via new jobs. It's called "work" or the employer/employee relationship that allows people to pay this bills with money instead of "your words". Simple fact! You hurt Bezos feelings &amp; he is rich enough to go
@cher So true. Even if he's super rich by creating jobs he is leaving some of his money in a city where it can be recycled and spent by the employees. Dumb shit lady forgets those concepts of employees &amp; employers ie: work to pay our bills. @JeffBezos is probably shy emotional &amp; hurt.
@davidwebbshow @IlhanMN Slaves are very free in Muslim countries especially after they are murdered including their children. https://t.co/ZstjnppbrD
@RyanAFournier The facts have nothing to to with the customer wearing some hat. What is problematic is an employee degrading a customer in public who is shopping and said nothing derogatory to start the argument.
@TheRevAl How come you don't stand up to the Islamic ideology regardless of some of their followers are black or not. Black has absolutely nothing to do with the teachings &amp; beliefs of these fanatics who murder Christian children solely because their family faith is Christian. https://t.co/L0GVW3nv44
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I believe what you are saying is true, but your response - a response to terminate the Mueller plundering the National Treasury &amp; his co-conspirators attempting a coup d'etat requires you to seek their arrests. Why aren't you doing just that instead of talking about it?
@AmbJohnBolton Amb.  Bolton we both know that if it wasn't for America's need of Venezuela's natural resources such as oil &amp; gold, we wouldn't give a shit about this nation or their problems. Right? Right! Tell it like it is sir. We're both Americans so there's no need to talk shit. lol
@GeraldoRivera Geraldo - you have to be lying. The #metoo movement dictates that because women have a vagina they are incapable of lying. Therefore, all men are publicly convicted because a feminist says so versus a valid complaint, identifiable source, a trial to confront the evidence &amp; jury.
@IlhanMN And how do you justify Islamic teachings of elitism against those ideologies of the "Book"? Where Christian children are murdered by those of your faith solely for believing in Jesus Christ? Is that the freedom you are talking about? Freedom from life under penalty of death? https://t.co/VsehNYvH2s
@RashidaTlaib I'm a Democrat but I have to believe the same as Trump! Every deep state elitist has
@UkrEmbLondon It sounds more like an American prison you're talking about? In the USA &amp; in prison they don't give a shit if you live or die.
@IlhanMN Trump's power grab? Lady I'm just an American &amp; after reading the McNabe &amp; Rosen stein fiasco, they should be arrested for treason &amp; coup d'etat without a doubt! Now that's a power grab!! Hang em High!
@TuckerCarlson IMBRA &amp; related laws DENYING Americans who have children to sponsor wives/husbands is resulting in EXILE, forced family abandonment, forced separation of children,imposed poverty, family destruction. US Gov is supposed to be BARRED from making laws interfering with families? BAD
@TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump @AlanDersh Have expressed this to President Trump in numerous tweets that deep state elitists are involved in a coup d'etat against the Presidency. Bizarrely, most coup players are involved in the 09/11 Saudi Wahhabi cover up on USA incl Mueller.
@Reuters Kurds should listen to words of wisdom by President Putin and Assad they would align themselves with Assad to protect themselves against the Turks because Turkey will commit genocide against them without a doubt. With Assad they not only live but are a part of Syria &amp; defended.
@nytimes moron
@AlwaysActions We are affording them the right to their beliefs here in America while their beliefs are being acted on internationally. One of those beliefs is killing Christian children because their families are Christian. 09/11 attack by Saudi Sunni sect &amp; we build a wall against Mexicans? https://t.co/J4ToCFXCRt

@SenateDems @JudiciaryDems @realDonaldTrump Barr is a deep state elitist who like may other "lawyers" should be detained, arrested and charged with treason against the united states.
@HouseJudiciary @JudiciaryDems This act is so bullshit - you people should be ashamed of yourself.

@realDonaldTrump Making deals with the Saudi Arabians huh? How about them now buying from the Russians? https://t.co/dnaAyBWDmi   Trusting the Saudi Arabians is like a snake charmer trusting a pit full of cobras.  STUPID to say the least.
@ABC The Alaska governor should be putting the National Guard on Little Diomede island to protect the USA from the Russians seeking refugee status. It's less than 3 miles for USA territory and a small skiff can easily make the journey.  Oh, I guess Russians don't to come. lol
@Louise212nyc2 @rweingarten @DNC Not at all. May I inquire as to why you would think such a thing? I am an independent freelance journalist, novelist and screenwriter. I do my research before I speak. What haven't you researched out to ask such a question? Grin

@BetteMidler Amazing.  I thought the north pole was shifting to Siberia?
@StuteeMishra Those who adhere to Islamic political ideals &amp; resort to violence should be exiled to Pakistan and the border sealed permanently.
@ediramaal Execute them one by one publicly.
@realDonaldTrump EXECUTE the Islamic State terrorists on behalf of their respective home nations as the Islamic State executed Christian children solely on the basis that their families were Christian. Hire me, I will execute them - one by one and Islamic State son by son - all of them! https://t.co/LuQF12Uh98
@realDonaldTrump Ths resolution is simple. The United States must execute them by instituting the death penalty on all of the Islamic State terrorists without delay as the Islam State had invoked the death penalty on Christian children solely on the basis that they families were Christian. https://t.co/uniz6TCano
@JeffBezos You're not seriously going to give Ocasio-Cortez the time of day are you? This girl has some bolts missing in her machinery Jeff - regardless of New Yorkers voting her in - She's a screwball - Beware of feminists - treat them like Jesus treats Bishops - family woman.
@AnaSamways hilarious - funny.
@RealSaavedra Am pro-Trump on many issues except the "WALL". Y? Because it was NOT Mexican Catholics that attacked the USA on 09/11/2001. It was Saudi Sunni Wahhabism fanatics a state religion. We haven't banned them &amp; Seattle looks like Mecca the last time I stopped. Y aren't they banned?
@washingtonpost Women give Americans a great perspective about feminists similar to what Jesus Christ told us about Bishops. Make sure a feminist is of one husband and a mother to sons/daughters taking care of her own family first before voting her into office or you may be voting for a monster!
@justinbivins2 Do wee need a wall to  Christian Mexicans out bcuz Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Muslims attacked on 09/11 &amp; we still let muslims in. I stopped in Seattle on a flight, I thought we landed in Mecca. all a crock of bullshit &amp; Acosta's schizoid stories on Trump don't help because no one cares
@rogerlsimon @Acosta No one cares about Acosta's schizoid @realDonaldTrump Trump stories. You're reporting isn't helping you. Even Obama kicked a reporter out of the White House. You're lucky you got back in with Trump. But, that still doesn't make you a good reporter. To be honest you're bad. Retire
@KamVTV @Acosta Acosta's antagonistic approach to Trump is just too much for the public. His schizoid story approach to Trump isn't earning him any credentials except people want him to retire early. Take the hint Jim. Retire early. No one gives a shit anymore.
@Acosta I have tried to maintain a neutrality about myself, President Trump and your antics. Oddly President Obama kicked a reporter out of the White House with no obstructions. With Trump you got back in the White House. But to be honest, your Trump stories appear to me as schizoid.

@nookyelur @IlhanMN @jdforward @ggreenwald @bungarsargon @AIPAC @realDonaldTrump Well it could be the Zionists &amp; Christian aren't afraid of Omar's person but rather her ideology that is non-tolerant towards non-believers that allows her fellow overseas faithful to murder children of Christian families without some kind of restraints on their thinking/acting? https://t.co/ZmNlSOQBTz
@refugeecouncil The United States is secretly forcing Americans into EXILE by refusing to allow Americans to sponsor their wives/husbands even though they have children. This creates a situation of forced abandonment, forced children/parental separation &amp; exile. For family unification YES refuge
@TehminaJanjua As a neutral party, I find the allegations against the Pakistani sect that engaged in murdering 40 plus Indians in Kashmir - quite valid. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out. It may be best for Pakistan &amp; India to seal the border indefinitely.
@IlhanMN I almost agreed with you. But, I noted that all planets of our solar system are undergoing change. I am under a different impression that because our solar system has continued to move in our galaxy so too does planets climate change. Has nothing to do with people. Maybe. ???
@Ilhan how about a new Homestead Act that gives all Americans 10 to 15 acres of land to build a house or grow their own food to get them off of the streets? That is how American became great! It needs to be done again because there are too many Americans without homes.

@NPR Confused? First CONGRESS created the Immigration LAWS. Now DHS is creating the laws? What about IMBRA &amp; related laws that DENY AMERICANS from sponsoring their wives/husbands when they have children? forced abandonment? exile? separation of children/parents? family destruction? BS
@RyankatKatz @SmashRacismDC @TuckerCarlson I hate to ruin your party but the United States was created with Christian values.

SAD to know USA affords the Islamic ideology representation in 	Congress. Islamic members afford no tolerance of faith outside of USA. Results in murder of Christian Children based on family faith. SHAME ON AMERICA &amp; SHAME ON ISLAM! No Christian seek refuge in Muslim countries! https://t.co/XxdbBLaXNz

@RashidaTlaib Diversity is fine, but to afford your ideology representation in our Congress is appalling with the knowledge that Islam has zero tolerance for non-believers that affords your ideology to murder Christian children solely based upon the faith of their family. https://t.co/ri8M1Mt4Qh
@Ilhan The problem that I have with the Islamic ideology that you follow is that the ideology offers no diversity for free religious thoughts who are not of your faith that results in Islam justifying the murder of Christian children. To give your ideology protection is appalling https://t.co/Tu8xLLTmng
@stevenmnuchin1 @USTradeRep The United States needs to begin a new Homestead Act to give Americans at least 10 to 20 acres getting them off the street to built their own homes with enough land to grow their own food.  Screw the world - get food on American tables and people off of the streets.
@RobertFife Feminists are like Christian bishops. Be sure when electing a "feminist" that she is a woman of one husband &amp; has sons and/or daughters as children being able to take care of her own family first before attempting to govern society equally. Otherwise U may be electing a monster.
@AmitSri42728334 @KremlinRussia_E it is extremely possible. The border is closed. Anyone caught crossing is shot on the spot. Zero Tolerance - the border is closed. Those Kasmir Muslims who want to go to Pakistan have a one way ticket or are relocated to the southern tip of India or Bangladesh - End the Violence.
@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN U R mixing up American nationalism with "white nationalism" which is clearly an Islamic attack on the Christian values that America is based upon. Demo Party now has Muslims holding the party purse strings and exchanging Christian values for Islamic values = political violence.
@AdyBarkan @IlhanMN @AIPAC Saudi Arabia is far more aggressive in financing both Democrat &amp; Republican government officials to sway sympathetic ears to the Saudi Sunni Islamic causes. This is an abomination &amp; other similar foreign funding is probably right. The lady needs to create a bill banning foreign $

@AP I'm American &amp; firmly believe our USA needs to stay out of Venezuelan affairs. If Maduro is bad enough, then surely the people will terminate his Presidency either the easy way - voted out or the hard way - executed.
@keribla I'm not sure what UR position is on this execution? R U opposed to Capital punishment? Or, relieved that this individual is being executed? Personally, I'm not against Capital punishment but the requirements should be more stringent such as more than 2 eye witnesses to the act.
@CantlieUK He will probably be arrested if found alive for aiding and abetting the enemy.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @SpeakerPelosi YOU are covering up Saudi murder of journalist just like Pres. Bush concealed Saudi attack 09/11 by Saudi State religion of Wahhabism &amp; using Mueller to cover terrorists in San Diego. Bomb these bastards &amp; ban them from USA F**K Saudi $
@realDonaldTrump You R doing Great except 3 issues: 1. U won't fire Mueller who committed treason during 09/11 protecting Saudi terrorists. 2. building dumb wall to keep out Catholic Mexicans when Saudi Wahhabi Muslims are flocking to USA - just look at Seattle - I thought I arrived in Mecca.
@RepJuanVargas YOU should verse her &amp; other new representatives not to do violence against our Constitution by engaging in creating politically correct laws that R nothing less than treason &amp; don't conform to Const standards such as IMBRA &amp; related laws barring American sponsorship &amp; marriages.
@IlhanMN What about the Sunni Saudis funding political parties &amp; mainstream media after they attack USA on 09/11 via their state religion of the Wahhabi Sunni sect of the Islamic ideology which surely degrades all other sects of Islam?
@may_reads Just remember dear that we are all human beings and just because a person is placed in a position of authority does not make that person some kind of superior being or an idiot. They are what they are which means a position of authority could also contain an idiot like you met.

@realDonaldTrump If one has an open mind, does their research, they will find there is climate change taking place on all of the planets of our solar system at this very moment. Maybe something else is going on as our solar system positions itself in our Milky Way.
@ConflictsW Eye movements clearly sustain this gentleman is reading his statement. However, that does not allude that he wrote his concerns first then read them. Either way, right or wrong, he has a right to express his individual thoughts towards his people and nation.
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump Many times we are empowering the wrong women who in turn are attacking men for the sole purpose of power. Make sure you choose the correct feminist - one with a husband, sons and daughters. Similar to Christ advising selection of Bishops who take care of their own family first.
@WhiteHouse Only issue I disagree with U on is UR stupid ass Mexican-American wall. Y? Because Muslims are flooding into America - just look at the Seattle airport, you'd think you're flying into Mecca. Catholic Mexicans didn't attack USA on 09/11 Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Muslims did.
@POTUS Only issue I disagree with U on is your stupid ass Mexican-American wall. Why? Because Muslims are flooding into America - just look at the Seattle airport, you'd think you're flying into Mecca. Catholic Mexicans didn't attack USA on 09/11 Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Muslims did.

@realDonaldTrump @CNN I don't really give a damn what excuse you provide to get American troops out of the middle of an Islamic political-religious war - but our Constitution tells us not to mix religion and politics. Let Allah or the Russian Orthodox Church sort it out. Bring our boys home!!!
@AnnaHopkins94 Another investigative journalistic issue is Americans with wives &amp;  children forced into exile because they can't sponsor their wives/husbands because of IMBRA &amp; other related laws dictating abandonment, forced family destruction &amp; children separated from parents.
@AnnaHopkins94 Your article about the Southern Baptists problems is lightening but expected.  You should take on Islamic Imams in America. GB reports underage marriages telling girls to keep silent with authorities &amp; teaching 5 year olds in mosques on how to behead Christians.
Very Interesting business considerations: 		https://t.co/xvr6VspMTi https://t.co/xvr6VspMTi
@KremlinRussia_E Excellent! May God bless!
@UNHCRUSA @washingtonpost People should advise America to STOP exiling American families &amp; denied the right to sponsor their wives when there are American children involved. Families are forced to be abandoned &amp; destroyed under IMBRA &amp; related laws. REPEAL THESE LAWS.  I KNOW BCUZ I'M EXILED AMERICAN DAD
@HopeforVirginia Your claim to being a husband, Dad &amp; delegate doesn't afford U the right to deprive Americans from a written complaint, identifiable source, the right to deny &amp; confront before a judge &amp; peers solely because a human being has a vagina or a penis. You're engaged in Treason sir.
@TeamPelosi Lady you sold out American values yo t he Muslim $. You're just a whacko calling someone else a whacko. But you're still just a whacko.
@KamalaHarris Totally disagree. If they've done their time for their crime restore all of their rights including voting. No one can see into the future or predict which whacko is going to go whacko.  You're just talking shit lady.

@BrazilianReport For those morons who are offended by female breasts - Get used to it - that's part of being a human being! It's what you've suckle when young and every man's vision of beauty when old. They are called teats and 50% of the world have them &amp; mom's use them to avoid hungry kids.
@LGJustinFairfax All Americans have a right to be heard. The Constitution is a system put in place. A person can file a complaint, provide evidence &amp; testimony. The accused has the right to confrontation, to defend themselves, &amp; be heard by his peers.  A vagina or penis doesn't guarantee truth.
@brithume Americans who are unaware of Native Americans extensively kidnapping female &amp; children settlers compelling them to assimilate first as slaves then members of the Indian tribes are unaware how extensive this was done. Under these circumstances Warren may very well be correct.
@SpeakerPelosi You take every opportunity to undermine our American government. I am questioning why? Are you senile, a closet terrorist with Islamic ties or a feminist so determined to discredit any male for power. In effect, Madman you are an old woman who is a whacko. My natural conclusion.
@AP So why must this guy resign? I say bullshit on Clinton et al. They're nothing more than proxy Muslim terrorists.
@SenSasse The liberals have just been allowed to go way too far &amp; the same with the feminists contrary to our Forefathers &amp; the nation established on Christian values. Abortion allowed up &amp; until moments before birth is an abomination that dictates abortion must be banned period
@SenSasse We have no business being involved in a religious-political Islamic war. We had 09/11 instigated by the Saudi Wahhabi Sunni sect of Islam - a national political-religion. We should have banned its followers and neutralized Saudi Arabia &amp; saved billions in national security.
@realDonaldTrump I can't believe that you haven't or don't TERMINATE MUELLER - unbelievable deep state elitist under Saudi influence with Russia as their diversion. FIRE THIS BASTARD - MUELLER IS AS EVIL &amp; CORRUPT AS SATAN HIMSELF. YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL FOR NOT DOING DO!
@LAPDHQ It seems like the feminists pushing the equality button on these women mens rea believed that these girls could match the man's strength &amp; got their asses kicked. Don't try to confront a brute thinking you're going to kick ass - get your men to take him on. Dumb shit feminists.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends How many God damn Muslim "caravans" are reaching our shores via airlines Mr. President? They bomb us on 09/11 &amp; we let them in by the droves. Hell I thought Seattle was Mecca when I landed there. Catholic Mexicans did not bomb us on 09/11. Get rid of these Muslim pirates .
@realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia Wahhabi is running rampant &amp; becoming even bolder after 09/11 attack on the USA. Not one Muslims from this terrorist sect of Wahhabi Islam has been banned from the USA. Why? It is a Saudi state religion! Shame on you allowing the USA deep state elitists to do this.
@ProudResister I don't buy Coats' assessment. What I buy is that Russia is a diversion away from Saudi Arabian infiltration into our mainstream media and politicians while avoiding liability for 09/11 - it is Saudi Arabia &amp; Coats is just another deep state elitist covering it up. Hang him!.
@RefugeeHub @bondjk I want to bring my wife and family to Canada as immigrants. I'm a professional writer. She has completed her international caregiver program. 2 kids 5&amp;6. Can you help?

@kerpen I myself am a "Vietnam Era" veteran having volunteered for active duty during time of war, I even volunteered for Vietnam. I was sent to Alaska to a USCG air station training pilots designated for Vietnam in foul weather flying. I'm not a Vietnam veteran rather a Vietnam Era vet.
@kerpen Apparently Phillips is a "Vietnam Era" veteran. He would have received national defense service medal for volunteering during time of war. Many times duty outside of Vietnam was considered "back-up"  such as training pilots in Alaska to fly in foul weather before Vietnam duty.
@RepChrisSmith You should go back &amp; review some of your legislation that affects marriages &amp; in reality is BARRED by the Constitution. There is a Constitutional proper procedure of legislating new laws established by the Fore Fathers that you are NOT following. You may be sued

@TulsiGabbard Ever since Islamic ideologists took over the Demo Party financial hierarchy the political change from Christian to Muslim values is quite evident. Political violence &amp; national destruction of values using feminists &amp; minorities to cloak the deeds.  Think Deeply: Word is TREASON
@TulsiPress You might want to remind Americans that your religion is "spiritual" and not similar to Islamic "sharia law" that has a goal to overthrow national governments with their own form of government.

@AmbJohnBolton We have no business in Venezuela even though it's government is bad.
@RepAlGreen It reminds us Americans that our government is $20 trillion in debt and we can't afford big government. Lay them off nicely because America can't afford all of the government hype to keep them. Especially when we have to pay the fees to keep them working anyhow.
@JimCarrey Very bad Karma Jim! Your comedy is okay, but some of your political views are toxic. And, those views do your person more harm than good.
This girl's name is Nargiz Zakirova and she will rock your ass off your seat! Super Fantastic voice. 		https://t.co/NqIRiG7AQm https://t.co/NqIRiG7AQm
She even takes "Love Hurts" to new heights - singing it even better than the original! Amazing - The Russians are now stealing our music! lol Sign her up! 		 https://t.co/SDZ5iG2MbK https://t.co/SDZ5iG2MbK
@Alyssa_Milano I think the DEMO PARTY is, now that Muslims have infiltrated the hierarchy using Islamic values instead of Christian values propagates political violence &amp; because of this people like you remind me of Islamic State &amp; Jim Jones followers. Yea you do - no mind at all - just follow
@KellyO @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi It's NOT Pelosi's prerogative. It's Constitutionally mandated requiring her compliance to assure it happens. The AG should hold Pelosi accountable for undermining the US government &amp; Presidency. Charge &amp; arrest her for treason &amp; stop this Demo Party Islamic value attacks on Trump
@KremlinRussia_E Trusting the Turkish President, his politics &amp; national interests is very dangerous. Make sure the Turks understand that if they purposely allow the rebels or they themselves conduct themselves outside of Russian &amp; Syrian protocol, consequences will be catastrophic &amp; make it so.
@KremlinRussia_E Sir - I admire you &amp; many of your international positions on many issues. But, not all. BEWARE Sir of Erdogan and Turkey's involvement in Syria. They support some very dangerous rebels that are NOT in Syria's or the Kurds best interests, Make sure they are "straight arrow"!
@JimCarrey your might be named in a lawsuit on this drawing sir... be careful - love your movies - but your politics sustains the Islamic infiltration into the Democratic party that controls the purse strings and propagates violence. do your research rather than being duped. I did.
@JimCarrey https://t.co/tvNADEK0dG - You had better apologize ASAP or you are going to pay the kids!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS TO HELL WITH PELOSI You're mandated under Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution to provide the People with a State of Union Address. This woman  is in alliance with member of the Islamic ideology using Muslim values. She commits treason! Do it at the WH &amp; arrest Pelosi after!

@RobertFife Great! After seeing how our most prestigious American government targets anything that walks to appease our deep state elitists - as if they are God's gift to mankind when in fact they're nothing more than a dingle-berry hanging on the end of a butt hole.  OUR GOV IS Embarrassing
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They should be charged with a Coup d'état and treason for attempting to undermine the Executive Branch of government - arrested and imprisoned without a doubt.
@cher My God, U R so wrong on this political statement! Check out Islamic infiltration into the hierarchy of the Demo Party, MSM &amp; funding politicians. Islam isn't Christian values. But Islamic value propagating political violence. An American Nationalist isn't a racist. UR Foolish
@BrentBozell NBC &amp; any other mainstream news  that doesn't investigate this matter and degrades these children are open to libel and slander per se lawsuits. I would expect nothing less to have these news outlets finally held accountable. SUE THEM FOR MILLIONS!
@cbouzy I think you're talking shit because no one gave you a MAGA hat. The Indian and Black Israelites came to the student. The students didn't come to them. They were waiting for a bus. That means your talking shit - sorry.
@realDonaldTrump The WALL is the only issue I disagree with you on. WHY? BECAUSE you haven't stopped those of the Wahhabi Islamic ideology from entering the USA. It was Saudi Sunni Wahhabi terrorists that attacked America on 09/11 &amp; not Catholic Mexican criminals. That's why! Think about it.
@realDonaldTrump Deep State Elitists &amp; Democratic Left Wing for reasons only God knows believes these these MAGA hats are somehow offensive. Shame on them! A great political slogan. I wish I had one &amp; I'd wear it on Veteran's Day. But, I do, but I wish I did.
@JimCarrey The children were waiting for a bus. Black Israelites came to the kids, used unbelievable vulgarities  &amp; the Indian started pounding his drum in the boys face. The Children are the bad guys? Get a reality check Jim - This type of news is toxic and you're propagating. BAD KARMA!
@doctorcool124 @news10nbc I'm just an observer &amp; an expert on the Islamic ideology. I know their pursuits and goals. Apparently you don't?
@news10nbc Islamberg is rumored for ties to terrorism. The followers of the Islamic ideology do not come to assimilate &amp; are dangerous. Civil war is coming to America because of Islam &amp; its values. Don't blame the boys. Blame the oilmen who let the pirates in the door. President Jefferson
@kathygriffin  YOU &amp; OTHERS attacking "American Nationalist children" solely BCUZ foul-mouthed groups &amp; a Native Elder approaches them on the street as they wait for a bus is about as obnoxious as politics can go. These deep state elitists controlling media &amp; our thoughts R EVIL
@realDonaldTrump Which asshole prosecutor telling the world he's is "America" &amp; trying to get a name by going after the Huawei exec in Canada &amp; trying to start a war? He IS NOT the USA, he is just a deep state elitist bastard. So call the dog off of her &amp; identify to the world who USA really is!
@RepMaxineWaters MLK was a black American nationalist. His legacy should be purged equally with white American nationalists.
@SenJohnHoeven @realDonaldTrump 1 issue in immigration that you forgot? What about depriving American husbands with American children their equal rights to sponsor their alien wives to America? It's great you remember migrants but to put Americans last? IMBRA &amp; Related laws force American families into EXILE.
@realDonaldTrump You're doing a great job Madam. President Trump has to put some power into bringing back old fashion forms of teaching our youth. It might be wise to bring back the 1950 school text books that also contain real American values. We have raised a bunch of idiots this generation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Trump knows Mueller is  deep state elitist who obstructed the 09/11 investigation &amp; San Diego terrorists which is treason. Now he's being used to attack every God damn person associated with UR Dad. To hell with threats against your dad if he were to fire him. FIRE THE BASTARD!
@adriangarro I don't understand what point he was attempting to portray by throwing away his microphone? He's not a good singer, and he's not some national leader shrugging off the world, maybe it's because he is a moron? I don't have a clue &amp; will waste no more of my time on the issue.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Trump needs to terminate the Mueller investigation period. It's a waste of time and does treason against the Presidency. People are sick of Mueller not withstanding he obstructed the 09/11 investigation of terrorists in San Diego. Mueller has  to go &amp; stop plundering the treasury
@krassenstein @NordstromJoe Disagree totally! The  Democrats need to investigate themselves for treason for undermining the Presidency. They need to start doing their jobs like creating a new Homestead Act to give people land that they can work and become self sufficient. And investigate the Saudis.
@LindseyGrahamSC She's not the Commander in Chief and has no business going to meet our troops. Waste of tax money.
@RIA_Worldnews :)
@JudyChu06634420 @senjudiciary not really both plunder the treasury for 26 million - both use bait and switch tactics - for what? A BJ where the girl kept the stained dress or Mueller concealing Saudi interference in USA politics including attacking us on 09/11 - Hang them both.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, you need a reality check about Mr. Mueller! He's a deep state elitist who has committed treason on behalf of Saudi Arabia obstructing the 09/11 investigation in San Diego. He's dangerous, plundering the treasury &amp; needs to be FIRED. DO UR JOB - TERMINATE HIM
@Refugees Where does a person secure a form to file for UN Refugee protection and make submission for themselves and family if they are overseas from their home country? Please reply to: john.grinols@gmail.com
@davidwebbshow @CNN @ArevaMartin @foxnation @GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @SiriusXMPatriot @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity Then sir, surely you must be guilty of #blackprivilege ? Labeling our citizens as "black  nationalists" or "white nationalists" instead of being in reality "American nationalists" is a similar misconception by the far left. Good luck.
@senjudiciary Mr. Barr conceals the conduct of Mueller in his role to obstruct investigation of 09/11 suspects in San Deigo. These deep state elitists should be investigated thoroughly for treason.  Mueller like Starr is plundering the treasury for millions over diversionary investigations
@AmbJohnBolton Trusting Turkey about anything is insanity at best. They are devious and dangerous. Get our nukes out of their country - pull our men and bases out of Turkey &amp; kick their ass out of NATO - then I trust them.
@GOPLeader you attempt to demonize King for exercising his freedom of speech. Odd Islamic indirect approach to obstruct freedom of speech and attack white people solely for being AMERICAN NATIONALISTS. FUK U McCarthy - you're creepy
@senjudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC Bill Barr sustaining Mueller based upon his integrity is tantamount to a jackass sustaining  credibility. Mueller obstructed 09/11 terrorist investigation in San Diego. This is a treasonable offense. Mueller is dangerous &amp; anyone supporting him is a deep state elitist. Remove him
@JimCarrey The problem with the painting is Bush &amp; Assoc. received $1.5 billion Saudi contracts after leaving office. Saudis support Clintons &amp; buy into mainstream media to silence any bad publicity. We needed to nuke Saudi Arabia after 09/11 not ally with them.
@FloydMayweather @girlcollection @TheMoneyGirls @BigBoyMansion What you say is true! But, having family to share in life's adventures is so much more rewarding, and in a similar fashion exercising artistic creativity. Have you ever thought of making a romantic musical comedy or science fiction movie?
@SecPompeo Sir, just make sure that you're not talking shit to the American people. The Saudis 09/11'd the USA - Turkey is like a poisonous snake. Warn them the USA will nuke their ass if ever again they attack the USA or our Kurd friends or admit you're talking shit. No offense intended.
@RepRashida Lady, your speech about a sitting president was a disgusting Islamic attitude that serves no purpose but to undermine our government &amp; in the future bring forth a very violent confrontation with Americans against Islam. Choose your words wisely instead of talking shit
@CNNPolitics As an American, being neither Democrat or Republican I'm totally appalled that CNN reduces itself to some kind of pro-Islamic &amp; anti-Trump propaganda machine that spews out nothing but bullshit.  UR newspaper must really hate America &amp; in turn, I don't read much now
@realDonaldTrump Now you see where Muslim infiltration into the Demo Party surfaces with its vulgarity out in the open. They are propagating violence sir and need to be called out for what they are. Terrorists.
@realDonaldTrump With all due respect sir - it's time to terminate Mueller and his attempt to over throw the Presidency while plundering our US Treasury in his attempt of coup d'ete. Mueller engaged in treason by obstructing 09/11 terrorists in San Deigo. He's a deep state sicko
@DeadlineWH @DonnyDeutsch @NicolleDWallace @TimOBrien @emilyjanefox Michael Cohen &amp; others that Mueller is attacking does NOT impress Americans. He's attempting a Coup d'état &amp; his conduct after obstructing the investigation in San Deigo against 09/11 terrorists is TREASONABLE. He needs to be TERMINATED. Trump's NOT the problem.
@BradSherman @realDonaldTrump @RepAlGreen You're a deep state elitist whose conduct is disgusting &amp; tantamount to a coup d etet. Your sir should be charged with treason &amp; kicked out of office as an idiot.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, we installed their corrupt ass governments &amp; toured their youth in our prisons then sent them home as gangs. Until we stabilize their nations with a normal form of government it is our responsibility to take refugees.
@get_america @realDonaldTrump We don't need any damn bullshit wall that illegals can dig under, cut through or pole valt over. If we're going to build a wall build it like great Wall of China as tourist attraction.
@realDonaldTrump Beg to differ with you on Honduran refugees sir! We installed their fanatical elitist criminal leaders. So we're responsible for their refugees until we remove their corrupt government.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I'm just an American - who observes &amp; from what I'm observing - there is someone in CNN hierarchy whose goal is not to report the news but propagate a coup d etat  against the Presidency - and their perpetual negativity should be subject to treason because its not reporting news.
@FloydMayweather It's too bad you haven't had your own children to share these kinds of things with because without family, children, &amp; friends - it's all just a swimming pool &amp; you're just a lonely man walking alone observing a swimming pool.
@JSchipperWDRB @WDRBNews Our deep state elitists now want to punish citizens for the field mistakes of police. Horrible the woman overestimated her powers &amp; died - but that's her fault - Sorry he didn't her - she killed herself
@realDonaldTrump Outstanding performance to get the hell out of Islamic religious-political wars. If they attack us again, nuke them. Otherwise leave their fanaticism to their enemies. USA is banned Constitutionally from taking Islamic religious sides. Review Pres. Jefferson.
@marcorubio Trump is CORRECT~ we can't continually fight proxy Islamic ideological wars - neither side of the religious Islamic ideologies conform with Christian values that established America. Just ask President Jefferson &amp; the bombing of Tripoli - we can use MOAB's if needed.
@realDonaldTrump Well sir those car tariff benefits given to the USA don't mean diddly sh*t. The Chinese are going all electric cars - gas cars will be banned - so who in hell will  buy American gas cars in China with a great reduction in tariffs? May I suggest NO ONE. Bad deal sir!
@realDonaldTrump Think about it Mr. President? Deep State Elitist lawyers engaged in a methodical &amp; treasonable coup d' etat to compromise the Presidency. Very disturbing while they plunder our Treasury - Star $26 mil to prove a blowjob? Mueller $26 mil to prove no collusion - ARREST FOR TREASON
RT @realDonaldTrump: When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or wi…
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo @senjudiciary Considering Mueller Deleted All Strozk Texts as per: https://t.co/si8AvvTDM8 - It is obvious Mueller is involved in a treasonable coup d'etat that compromises the Presidency. He &amp; his investigation should be terminated IMMEDIATELY. Fire him now!

@supriyadwivedi Very noteworthy indeed that there is an Islamic block of nations now in the UN &amp; this allows immigration from Muslim nations to secular &amp; Christian values nations - but what about secularists &amp; Christians immigrating to Islamic nation? reciprocal treaty for the migration compact?
@czarymarybum777 Pope Francis is talking shit &amp; doesn't know a damn thing about the Islamic ideology. President Jefferson calling them "pirates" with respect to his perception of not knowing their ideology or Qur'an at the time should tell the Pope something doesn't register on his perception.
@JohnBrennan Brennan,  if ever there was an Amican traitor, one took an oath of allegiance to a wahhabi imam &amp; Ummah Islam it us YOU. Terrorists.
@realDonaldTrump Comey &amp; Mueller are deep state elitists who are part of an organization to control who is in the Presidency - It is time for their indictment, arrest and charge of treason. They are undermining the Executive Branch of government with thier bullshit scheme. terminate &amp; arrest them
@realDonaldTrump Sir, it is so God damn obvious that James Comey &amp; Mueller are part of the deep state elitists who are using their positions to undermine and control who is in the Presidency. HAVE THEM INDICTED, ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH TREASON NOT WITHSTANDING END MUELLER'S TREASURY PLUNDERING!
@HouseJudiciary That man James Comey &amp; Mueller are attempting to undermine the Presidency of the United States - regardless of Trump being President - these two sons-of-bitches should be arrested and charged with treason!
@SecPompeo  Sir, TRUMP's a dumb shit &amp; Xi is snookering him! Y? He's proclaimed China will be 100% electric cars in 2 years. He gives us no tariffs on US GAS cars. No 1 will buy them in China because they will be illegal in 2 years. He's going 4 new product economic dominance.
@VP Sir, TRUMP's a dumb shit &amp; Xi is snookering him! Y? He's proclaimed China will be 100% electric cars in 2 years. He gives us no tariffs on US GAS cars. No 1 will buy them in China because they will be illegal in 2 years. He's proclaiming economic dominance of a new product.
@realDonaldTrump Sir - You're a dumb shit &amp; Xi is snookering U! Why? He's proclaimed China will be 100% electric cars in two years. He gives U no tariffs on US GAS cars. No 1 will buy them in China because they will be illegal in 2 years. He's proclaiming economic dominance on a new product.
@lisamurkowski  Mueller &amp; his assc's do treason against the US Const &amp; is dangerous deep state elitists paid by Saudis. He blocked investigation of the 09/11 terrorists when they were in San Diego.  He's plundering the treasury attacking the Presidency.  Have the bastard arrested

He blocked investigation of the 09/11 terrorists when they were in San Diego.  He's plundering the treasury attacking the Presidency.  I hope he's arrested.
@realDonaldTrump Bob Mueller obstructed the San Diego investigation into the 09/11 terrorists at the request of the Saudi government &amp; Bush. Wahhabism is a "state religion" and these people including Mueller are dangerous and committed treason against our nation for $$$$$$. Terminate him.
@realDonaldTrump PRESIDENT TRUMP - THIS IS A BAD HORRIBLE DEAL! WHY? BECAUSE CHINA IS COMMITTED TO CONVERTING ALL CHINESE VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC IN TWO YEARS - WITH 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE  - GAS CARS ARE HISTORY!
@realDonaldTrump Stay the fuck out of  RF-Ukraine problems sir - Crimea was transfered with a stroke of a pen by the communists. Its part of Mother Russia like Virginia is USA &amp; keep barking up the bears tree - they might very well kick our ass as we can theirs. Leave em alone if U don't like em
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I suggest you stop downplaying Russia while supporting the tyrants of Saudi Arabia - were on the wrong side of world allies - and if you don't realize that - America is DOOMED - Our gov is filled with Saudi kiss assers. Get rid of them - make friends with RF
@ABCPolitics @ABC Mueller aided and abetted the 09/11 terrorists by obstructing the San Deigo investigation. This guy is a deep state elitist who is dangerous to America and needs to be terminate from his investigation role. Milking the treasury for big bucks on a bullshit job to discredit Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Have him investigated for obstructing investigation of the 09/11 terrorists when they were in San Deigo. Mueller is an evil dangerous deep state elitist and you're a fool if you don't investigate him and fire him. He represents non-American interests &amp; does our nation harm.
@SenMikeLee There are too many deep state elitists who are lawyers interfering in government creating laws that don't benefit the people, but themselves. The Forefathers used "counsel" as not to ordain them in any capacity of government. &amp; Jesus warned Christians to beware of lawyers.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @senjudiciary Sir, get off of your ass &amp; have Mueller prosecuted 4 TREASON during the Bush era. He obstructed Saudi terrorists in San Diego from being investigated. He's a deep state elitist lawyer who's DANGEROUS to US &amp; compromising the Presidency.
@realDonaldTrump @senjudiciary @SecPompeo YOU need to run an investigation on Mueller's conduct of obstructing an investigation into the terrorists when they were in San Diego. It seems the deep state elitist lawyers are interfering with the Presidency - it must stop!
@MonicaLewinsky I've never seen a woman milk a "bj" for such a huge amount of money as you do, by claiming to be a victim &amp; all the while keeping the stained dress like a trophy - unwashed doesn't bring any sympathy from me, in fact, that one fact is cheesy. In it for the money from day one?
@SenBobCorker @washingtonpost From Bush to Clinton to Bush to Obama the USA should have neutralized Saudi Arabia after 09/11 - but NO asshole politicians line their pockets with Saudi $ even when attacked. The Wahhabi sect is a state religion meaning Saudi Arabia attacked with the USA with impunity. Nuke 'em!
@GeraldoRivera @Ocasio2018 You're correct Geraldo - there are deep state elitists in both parties doing violence against citizen rights and treason against the Const. many are paid by the Saudi Arabian government. STOP foreign lobbyists &amp; funding our Congress  - that's why we got ambassadors.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller obstructed a Saudi investigation during 09/11 to protect the Saudi royal family. He committed treason and his continual participation dipping in the treasury for money is creepy. Fire the son of a bitch! Don't be a chicken shit with this guy He's dangerous! Get RID OF HIM
@realDonaldTrump @FEMA_Brock @SecretaryZinke @fema Why can't FEMA have SMALL, SINGLE WIDE TRAILERS that fit in DRIVEWAYS &amp; stocked w/ food, water, propane to be used by people rebuilding their homes? THINK ABOUT IT SIR? Tarps &amp; water is BS. China amassed 100K troops with shovels, aid, &amp; food for disaster in 24 hours. Can we? NO!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenateFloor Mr. President, you're being a "farthead" by guaranteeing Nancy @NancyPelosi enough votes to be speaker considering the Democrats have enough votes to quash her. I think it's hilarious! Great political move to let an idiot speak for them! lol
@realDonaldTrump I don't understand how CNN can sue you.? Bizarre because the White House is YOUR HOUSE. A person makes you feel uncomfortable or does not meet your standards of conduct - Okay kick his ass out! That's what you did. CNN can appoint someone else! Right?
@IDFSpokesperson Maybe it is time to neutralize the Gaza strip entirely and relocate those people who live there to Jordan and make the area a nature park. If a nation  fired 300 plus rockets at the USA they would cease to exist before the morning sun.
@RyankatKatz @SmashRacismDC @TuckerCarlson Disagree - It's the hierarchy of the Democratic Party now controlled financially &amp; ideologically by the Muslim faction propagating political violence and using these followers like puppets on a string.
@bhandel58 @lisamurkowski My Gosh, do I disagree with you on this statement! I'm shocked to afford any woman to be believed solely because she has a vagina to compromise, due process &amp; Constl. rights. Tantamount to verbally sexually assaulting an innocent man legalizing slander, libel &amp; public conviction.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, it's time to get a reality check on the European Union. They're not poverty stricken nations like just after WW2. They're now united into a strong nation. Let them defend themselves! Dissolve NATO and defend ONLY America! They are wasting our money!
@bennyjohnson Their leaders &amp; financiers of these people should be held accountable for any potential violence. Many families with children would may very well have neutralized them the moment they set foot on the porch - justifiably!
@RogueElsa @RyanBottjer @Acosta I totally disagree with your assessment of President Trump's decor or conduct during the interview. He has a right to terminate any questions at any time. Acosta showed no respect for the office. It's not the person but the office.
@SmashRacismDC Give me a break on your bullshit! Look deep into who is financing your protests. Muslims or Soros? Keep your legal protests on the street. If you come to the wrong house &amp; family with kids - you may get more than you expected.
@SmashRacismDC @TuckerCarlson Going to the privacy of one's home with innuendo threats is a very serious violation of privacy. BEWARE - there are some America who'd take the threat seriously &amp; neutralize the protesters - especially if the occupants have kids.  Leave Carlson alone - Protest on the streets.
@Hjorleif @Acosta I saw the video &amp; noted Acosta's refusal to hand over the microphone to the woman. There was minor resistance by Acosta to compliance by more or less blocking her attempt to take the microphone. Sanders "blew it out of proportion" without doubt - as she emphasized this conduct.
@Acosta Interesting protest. YOU have a NEWS story right in front of you. I could care less about the Mueller probe about Russia. It seems diversionary from a needed probe on Saudi Arabia into US meddling. Mueller protected 09/11 terrorists by obstructing probe in California. Disturbing.
@Acosta Sir, I watched the video in depth. Understandably there are times reporters need to be confrontational, but with the President, you're making it a habit &amp; as part of the public audience, your conduct was perceived by me as continually offensive to the office of the Presidency.
@IvankaTrump I hope my daughter Skye makes me as proud of her as your father is proud of you! Have a happy day!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I totally agree with you Geraldo. Many in the press are trying not only to create havoc for a story but President bashing on every single item of his agenda by convolution what the President's intentions are, if bad karma.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS @WhiteHouse I beg to differ with the Pentagon. The President DOES have power to SEND troops DOMESTIC VIOLENCE &amp; once the MIGRANTS reach American soil this issue is valid. Constit. Domestic Violence DIDN'T mean FAMILY VIOLENCE IN THE BEGINNING.
@louis2nd @bawl @SteveKingIA @DMRegister "White Nationalist" is a bullshit term. They are American Nationalists - &amp; they include Blacks, Whites, Asians &amp; everyone else who love this country.  In fact someone should start an American Nationalist Party!
@FoxNews @lindaritchey8 11 Felonies for ditching a woman on a date so he didn't have to pay the bill? How many men always get stuck with the bills for women who go out on a date? TOO MUCH! Who is to say the date was all that great? The women were dumb shits for going out with him via internet for sure!
@RT_com that is a bullshit article. It can't happen except in the reciprocal nation's general's wildest dreams.
@SteveKingIA @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump I am opposed to this change in the status quo of citizenship as a birthright. Born in  the USA - you're American - I'm American &amp; I am sick of all of these God damn deep state elitists perception of using some Unconstitutional Exemption Doctrine to create politically correct laws
@realDonaldTrump China snookered you on trade because they are going all out on Electric cars - the moving force for finance in the future. They don't need our trade exchange you agreed to because what we have will be obsolete soon. https://t.co/MOzBHRtA2A - Wise up sir! GO ELEC
@SecNielsen @POTUS With all due respect that wall is worthless as teats on a bull to keep Saudi Wahhabi terrorists out of America - or did our government forget who bombed us on 09/11 - it wasn't Catholic Mexicans Madam. What a bunch of dumb shits to fall for Bush's diversion. 1.5 bil of Saudi $.
@nytimes Well, that is YOUR Newspaper's fault for backing the Bush &amp; Clinton era for letting the sons of bitches into our country and infiltrating our government and media with their money - it works - they bomb us on 09/11 and we blame it on Iraq - Bush &amp; Assoc. receive !.5 bil contracts
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine Ah, Pres - don't go kissing law enforcement's ass too sweetly - remember the FBI - had a plan to oust you - and they are always propagating fake news to increase their business ventures at American citizens basic rights.
@realDonaldTrump When the caravan of refugees start to pole vault over the wall, make sure you order the troops to only aim at the legs - because if anyone is killed then  you're the bad guy again. lol
@KumarRaoNYC @nikkihaley @Bakari_Sellers You are so full of bullshit trying to pin "violence" on Pres. Trump. FDR was a DEMOCRAT who allowed Stalin to murder 10's of thousands of Americans PLEADING to get home. After they left the US Embassy the KGB took them to Gorky park &amp; shot them in the head. Men, women &amp; Children
@FoxNews It is beyond my mental thoughts on why anyone would walk in and murder innocent people at their place of worship. Nor do I understand this "hatred" towards the Jewish people. I'm a half-ass Christian without a clue to this deranged killer's thought process. His execution swift.
@nytimes https://t.co/gTl00a0vcf - this lady screaming in public on the street that she'd been sexually assaulted - the video shows she's talking bullshit - Believe all women because they got  a vagina &amp; give up due process Const. rights? #metoobs - "bs" means bullshit. Go by the Const.!
@washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump The #metoo movement dictates we believe women because they have a vagina &amp; must give up due  process, formal complaint, due process &amp; confrontation? Let's start the #metobs movement starting with: https://t.co/gTl00a0vcf with her screaming in public? BULLSHIT!
@GeraldoRivera Y should America allow migrants into the USA when the USA is dictating forced family destruction resulting in Americans being exiled in nations around the world? It's insanity! I got permanent residency. The wife can't be sponsored &amp; come with me &amp; Kids! Why? Because I'm American
@dscc Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@SenateGOP Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@senjudiciary Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@SenateFloor Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@HouseDemocrats Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation
@HouseGOP Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@WhiteHouse Sir "I strongly disagree w/ U on children!" on this matter. Born in the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@IvankaTrump Disagree w/UR Dad, "I strongly disagree!" on this matter. Born is the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation. Force them to support children. No job - deportation.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, "I strongly disagree with you!" on this matter. Born is the USA is American. These are American children with illegal parents. Give the parents residency until child is 18 with mandatory deportation then. Force them to support children. No job - deport.
@PeterGaeta @pattysmattyvt @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump I think quite the contrary! Deep state elitists dictating a Const. Exemption Doctrine to implement politically correct laws contrary to Constitutional rights &amp; politicians receiving Saudi $ 2 divert our attention from infiltration into USA R traitors. UR 9.9 crock o' shit meter.
@timmitchell05 @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump Don't call people names Timmy - Explain your position - that's what this is about. I could call you an idiot but that doesn't mean you're right or wrong. That just means a tweet that calls you an idiot which would make me look like an idiot too because I don't have a valid reply.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS Mr. President, YOU have another alternative to these 1,000's of Hondurans &amp; Guatemalans on their way to the USA! WARN THOSE NATIONS THE USA IS IMMEDIATELY SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO RESTORE LAW &amp; ORDER TO ASSURE THE SAFE RETURN OF THESE PEOPLE.
@pattysmattyvt @PeterGaeta @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump Quite the contrary - that is an Islamic tactic to attack the person rather than the issues at hand. I was involved in writing "In the Mind of Mohammed" with intense deep research with Ali Sina - not talking shit like you!
@Benjami79165812 @Chalkarts @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump They attacked us? Who? Russian ghosts? Democrats headed now by Muslim hierarchy &amp; government officials who receive Saudi $ divert the attention from them using the Russian Federation.  We do far more internationally by intruding into governments than Russia ever dreamed.  Saudis!
@CandiceMalcolm Correct  verbiage is "Muslim nationals" - In Islam followers take an oath to their imam &amp; Ummah Islam (Nation of Islam). Their citizenship is called "brotherhood". They are citizens of the conceptual nation of Islam. They're not Canadians or any other nationality. They're Muslims
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo Does turning a "blind eye" to a U.S. permanent resident entering the Saudi Embassy dead- means indirect concurring with this kind of conduct: affords the USA right to attack Americans who R residents of other nations if they enter U.S. Embassy?
@Chalkarts @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump Ah you're talking shit. We need the russians as allies - the treason appeasers are those paid by the Saudis like Bush &amp; Assc. who got 1.5 bil in contracts after office &amp; attacking Iraq instead of the Saudis. That's why their journalist got hit - can't talk bad about the Saudis
@dianne_116 @anthony_carroll @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump Ah you're talking shit lady. My heritage is 1/16th black American. I may look White but there's just a lot of creme in the coffee - it's still coffee - and definitely not racist - Trump's not racist because he confronts Muslims.Islam enslaves all colors of mankind. discriminatory
@pattysmattyvt @dindin6 @realDonaldTrump racist? There's nothing racist in the comment. I'm 1/16th black American
@dindin6 @realDonaldTrump His NO PLAN STRATEGY IS WORKING FANTASTIC - TAKE DAY BY DAY &amp; ISSUE BY ISSUE AS THEY COME - AND DEAL WITH THEM AS THEY HAPPEN! Great Job Mr. President - I'm 97.5 % with you &amp; the other 2.5% - I can deal with you on those issue I disagree with. Dindin is a smart ass. lol
@starsandstripes 12 Secret Service attached to the President Trump's Oval Office in the White House use Air Force 1 to fly to Cincinnati from Wash. D.C. &amp; chop off a CNN reporter's head. But, Pres. Trump doesn't have a clue what happened? Is this the Saudi's similar scenario defense? MBS =More BS
@realDonaldTrump Coming en mass as invaders? Order the military to SHOOT THEM IN THEIR LEGS or FEET - in order to stop them - NOT KILL THEM. Invaders must realize it's time to STOP if guns are pointed &amp; will be fired! Only a dumb shit would proceed.
@GeraldoRivera Good Question - IT'S TRUE &amp; IT'S FALSE. Military is NOT outlawed to protect the borders  of the United States. They are outlawed within the scope of domestic laws. People are "invaders" if they attempt to gain entrance into our nation outside of procedures. Military should shoot!
@senrobportman UR suggesting the Feminist cause, it's mandatory people are forced to believe women because they have a vagina so men can be attacked with verbal sexual assaults, denied due process, a written complaint, identifiable source &amp; confrontation w/ a constitutional exemption doctrine?
@thehill It's not the police's fault. Our Congress &amp; Legislature elitists in fear of the unConst. exemption doctrine laws they want to impose political correctness - gives cops too much power to be violent on the whim of the cop. Congress &amp; legislatures needs their asses kicked, not cops.
@nytimes B4 YOU vote for FEMINISTS analyse the feminists you're voting 4! Is she a Mother with sons &amp; daughters? Or a single, barren, unmarried or divorced woman creating laws that effect families. Jesus warned Bishops to first take care of their own families B4 giving spiritual guidance.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @gatewaypundit B4 YOU vote for FEMINISTS analyse the feminists you're voting 4! Is she a Mother with sons &amp; daughters?

@PadmaLakshmi Your assessment is totally wrong! She is "sharing" American values that the nation was created &amp; based upon. Multi-multiculturalism was the reason for the fall of the Roman Empire &amp; most likely the USA. Her remarks are in way "racist". She's warning against future discrimination.
@realDonaldTrump Good Luck &amp; be careful Mr. President. The Democrats who are now infiltrated &amp; controlled by Muslims have different values that have replaced American values &amp; now incorporate political violence. I worry &amp; pray for your safety sir. The Demo Party should be designated as terrorists
@ShotsRangOut @THETXEMBASSY @_CFJ_ @jstines3 @No_Liberal_Tex @lenlucas46 @andyoaklee @CrazyCatRescuer @AppSame @NascarChuck336 @NahBabyNah Americans are Americans - color doesn't mean shit. Only in the minds of idiots does color means some stupid ass perception that's full of sh*t.
@US_Secy_State 2 believe the Saudi prince wasn't involved is = to 12 Secret Service Agents @ the White House using Air Force 1 landing in NYC, showing up @ CNN &amp; chopping off a reporter's head but Pres. Trump doesn't know shit about it. Duh! We need to drop Saudis like the plague
@dscc To believe the Saudi prince wasn't involved is = to 12 Secret Service Agents @ the White House using Air Force 1 landing in NYC, showing up @ CNN &amp; chopping off a reporter's head but Pres. Trump doesn't know shit about it. Duh! We need to drop Saudis like the plague.

@SecPompeo @ForeignAffairs @realDonaldTrump Sir please stop being a God damn puppet for the Saudi regime foreign policy. Stay out of political-religious Islamic wars. They're all insane - quote from Mark Twain - "Pirates" quote from Pres. Thomas Jefferson who bombed Triopli after reading the Qur'an. FukEm!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @WhiteHouse @POTUS With all due respect sir - to believe the Saudi prince wasn't involved is = to 12 Secret Service Agents @ the White House using Air Force 1 landing in NYC, showing up @ CNN &amp; chopping off a reporter's head but U don't know shit. Duh!
@realDonaldTrump WORDS OF WISDOM - GET RID OF THE SAUDIS AS ALLIES - BECAUSE IT COULD COST YOU THE WHITE IN NEXT ELECTION - THEY ARE TOO GOD DAMN BARBARIC &amp; WE SHOULD HAVE NUKED THEM AFTER 09/11. President Jefferson warned Americans when he called them "pirates" &amp; bombed Tripoli.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @MichaelAvenatti because its a nicer word than skank? How many times in your life have you gone out on the town &amp; woke up with someone that you wish you'd never met. He probably paid her to pretend it didn't happen - maybe because he got the clap from her. lol
@realDonaldTrump Islam affords deception and lying to the infidels sir - part of their "religion" &amp; please don't let on to the public that you really believe their bullshit or you'll be labeled a BUSH who was paid 1.5 bil in Saudi money after leaving office for attacking Iraq instead of them.
@realDonaldTrump Did you tell the Crown Prince that you know he's talking bullshit because the men at the embassy in Turkey were identified as the prince's personal bodyguards? Think about chopping a guy up? Bomb Mecca &amp; Medina &amp; the royal palace - seize all of their $ &amp; make it a Christian state
@realDonaldTrump Sir, you need to get rid of that country as an ally like its the plague. Not to mention you should obliterate them for the same tactic on 09/11 when their Wahhabi government controlled ideology bombed the trade center. They're evil sir &amp; no amount of $ will appease their impunity
@nikkihaley @USUN Are U talking about our USA? Wahhabi Muslims attack us but we don't ban them, instead we revoke American freedoms 4 our citizens, spend billions on security, ban Mexican Catholics &amp; attack the wrong nation of Iraq. We need to obliterate Saudi Arabia from the face of the Earth.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Totally DISAGREE WITH YOU Geraldo. Is that what Bush &amp; assoc. did 4 them on 09/11 &amp; collects $1.5 bil in contracts after office? How about we FREEZE the US $ overseas as NULL &amp; VOID in ALL Saudi accounts? How about neutralizing them permanently? Sometimes $ doesn't buy values.
@ForeCit3 @keithellison So, based on those facts &amp; that our family WERE strong Roosevelt Democrats - I think U are talking off the top of UR head instead of a neutral  independent research of facts. I don't make up or create the results. From my perspective you're looking stupider than me. Enlighten me.
@ForeCit3 @keithellison Wish I could agree with U, but  my research &amp; at times backed up by statistical probability. Facts R directly from the AMA (American Muslim Association) website. 'THEIR" terminology for Muslims to "infiltrate" the Democratic party becuz they didn't have a sufficient voter block!
@realDonaldTrump Reality Check Mr. President! Those men enter Saudi embassy that requires a code &amp; security to enter. They drive their van inside the compound like they own the place. Interrogate &amp; start chopping of heads and arms. And, that "puke" is supposed to answer you? BOMB his palace!
@keithellison Ever since Muslims infiltrated &amp; took over the hierarchy of the Democratic Party all we see is political violence propagated by those cloaking themselves as a religion &amp; minority. It's time to label the Democratic Party as a "soft" terrorist organization &amp; start making arrests.
@EngrMHKhan @054durin @anna_sorget @realDonaldTrump Why? Why should anyone believe in an entity that allows humans to kill other humans for any reason such as not believing in any entity whatsoever?
@NicolasMaduro @CuatroFWeb World is watching you &amp; we don't know exactly what you are doing to your country,, but we know that tens of thousands of people are leaving Venezuela - so you are doing something horribly wrong. This is a natural conclusion otherwise everyone would be flocking to your utopia.
@FloydMayweather @LeonardEllerbe Floyd, you will lose this one - this young man's mentality is like ISIS - dangerous - more dangerous than you'd ever dream - so if you fight him - you'd better reduce your mentality to being a ruthless vicious barbarian to defeat him.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Went back after reading this tweet and watched the 60 minutes interview. That lady was scandalously rude and degrading to the President both professionally and personally. I admire him for standing up for his causes and putting up with her. I would have told her off if I were him
@realDonaldTrump The USA thanks you Mr. Trump 4 bringing the pastor home. But Uuld warn all Americans that "bible thumping" in Muslim countries is extremely dangerous with the potential of death unlike the rights we give Muslims in the USA.  We should have reciprocal  laws for news &amp; religion.
@realDonaldTrump With all due respect sir, we need to terminate the alliance with Saudi Arabia regardless of their financial status. They should be paying the USA for 09/11 - don't forget that Wahhabi sect of Islam is a "state" - political-religion responsible for murdering us.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo Because that is exactly what the Saudi Prince is broadcasting to the world - that, you're not going to do shit! I strongly suggest you neutralize them by making their palace a parking lot of glass. And, I'm no war monger - THEY ARE!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo Saudi belligerence &amp; arrogance about the murder of the journalist is targeting U with impunity. There's only 1 solution &amp; that solution should have been invoked after 09/11. A surgical strike on the Saudi royal palace. Unless UR talking shit?
@EricHolder The Democratic Party purse strings &amp; hierarchy is now controlled by Muslims from @keithellison to V. Jarrett. They don't use American values but rather Islamic values using the Demo minorities like puppets on a string propagating political violence. No way says this former Demo.
@054durin @EngrMHKhan @anna_sorget @realDonaldTrump Sure they have! Simple statistical probability proves God exists. If U don't believe in God &amp; there isn't 1 - there's nothing to worry about. If there is a God &amp; you don't believe in the entity - you're in deep shit.
@SduffortHays Feminist perception of being afforded a Const. exemption doctrine re: innocent males R attacked w/ verbal sexual assaults to destroy instead of Const. due process of valid complaint (police report) identifiable source &amp; right to confront is the issue. RGB is a Constitutionalist
@PennWomen I adamantly disagree with you! Feminists shouldn't be able to attack men by verbally sexually assaulting them publicly without a written complaint (police report) identifiable source &amp; right to confront. No Const. exemption doctrine without due process. Sorry lady UR wrong!
@gatewaypundit They screwed up by giving her a security clearance in the first place.
@054durin @anna_sorget @EngrMHKhan @realDonaldTrump What you say is very true - he may been created to emphasize what naturally and instinctively is considered by human beings as right and wrong - All words pertaining to any "God" came from the minds of men &amp; women who could write down their thoughts.
@aynex @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Funny or not - research it out - AMA told Muslims on their website to "infiltrate" Demo Party. Valerie Jarrett &amp; Keith Ellison control Party $ purse strings. Political violence is an Islamic value not America - we have a Christian &amp; war value.
@greazypeazy @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS U can call me anything you want. That doesn't elude the facts Muslims run the $ &amp; hierarchy of Demo Party &amp; playing on the minority sympathies. No 1 knows their strategy unless  research them out - like I did &amp; assholes like U - don't realize I'm part black &amp; expose their asses!
@IvankaTrump @StateDept @JTIP_State I disagree with this position adamantly. Ambassadors is a position throughout history designated by nations to represent nations &amp; not political ideologies. BAD CORRUPTION OF THE INTENT. Same with foreign lobbyists - they have ambassadors to talk to our government - BAN THEM!
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Black Americans need to realize that the Muslims in the hierarchy of the Democratic Party changing to Islamic values is using the minorities like puppets on a string for their political goals as they control the $ - &amp; that's the reason for today's political violence. Wise up!
@GeraldoRivera Saudi Arabian arrogance is our fault for not making that nation a parking lot after 09/11 - The Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam is the state-religion of Saudi Arabia &amp; everyone knows they were behind it - including Bush &amp; assoc. who received over $1.5 bil after leaving office.
@054durin @anna_sorget @EngrMHKhan @realDonaldTrump To each his own! The Jewish community tosses out the New Testament. Jesus whether you believe he is just a man, a prophet, or the son of God brought wonderful words of wisdom to mankind. He doesn't need the OT to persuade his teachings.
@thileite__ @washingtonpost My daughter was sent home from school w/ a note. I inappropriately dressed her &amp; propagated violence? I bought her a family kilt to wear on holidays - streak of red - can't wear red to school - Crips. violence? Told her to walk away but knock em on their ass if anyone touch her.
@thileite__ @washingtonpost Quite the contrary. Usually its a Muslim tactic to attack the person rather than confronting the veracity &amp; validity of an issue! It shows ignorance rather than explaining why 1 opinion is in error. Teachers at times go way too far. As a parent, I prefer to control proper manners
@SenatorHeitkamp Wow!Read UR article Y U voted No for Kavanaugh. Completely opposite for me. I believed Dr. Ford until I saw her "glazing into the abyss" (blank-stares w/ lowered eyes) - ALL knows is visual evidence of lying. &amp; verbal sexual assault against guy w/ no due process?
@thileite__ @washingtonpost in the context of her portraying Kavanaugh &amp; consent is politics, teach young children about what lies can do to innocent people would be more fruitful - at their tender age. I've got 2 young sons in school - &amp; I prefer the basics to be taught at school &amp; Christian values @ home.
@EngrMHKhan @anna_sorget @realDonaldTrump I study what's in the Qur'an, &amp; related literature. It is not the people who are negative but rather the ideology itself.
@thileite__ @washingtonpost It's fu*k heads like you that need ivory soup to wash the diarrhea dog shit coming out of your mouth. You sound like a drip that didn't run down your mamma's leg after leaving her brothel job. Y did U mail order some slut to marry Bcuz U Stink? lol
@Amon_Cornix Third Grade? Give me a break! Big thing to learn in 3rd grade was to lay our heads on the table for 20 minutes &amp; listen to the classics of Beethoven &amp; Bach. Then we did our arithmetic. Our Principal taught kids what "no" was with the paddle board on our asses. So stfu boomer U 2
@senjudiciary His first step as a USSC judge should be to take a case of Const. Due Process versus Feminists Const. Exemption Doctrine - that they believe we must believe every American with a vagina - to convict every man in their way as they abuse the system to get more power.
@NBCNews @BillKarins So, what are FEMA's plans? To provide bottled water while the electricity is out for six months like in Puerto Rico? Any single wide trailers, stocked with food &amp; water for those to rebuild?  Nonsense agency as worthless as teats on a bull.
@washingtonpost Teachers need to stay out of teaching our kids politics and stick to the original "reading, writing, and arithmetic" formula of teaching. There are too many whacko's teaching our kids bulls*it.
@ChinaPlusNews Many times I look at "delicacies" and realize those "bizarre" food are remnants of past famines in nations when they were poverty stricken with nothing to eat - and so - in remembrance they identify these "foods" as delicacies - for me - they're "yuk". lol
@SchrodngrsTrump @FoxNews @POTUS I disagree - but regardless - Our due process laws of a valid complaint (police report) identifiable source &amp; right to confront an accuser MUST NOT be obstructed with a Const. exemption doctrine - forcing people to believe someone because they have a vagina, penis or are a eunuch
@ABC Fantastic that our species can help another such as in this case. Wonderful happening.
@nathans388 @ABCPolitics @ABC You're wrong! I didn't serve this country to afford a Const. Exemption Doctrine that affords a person to be believed solely because they have a vagina or penis. Due process requires a valid complaint (police report), identifiable source, &amp; right to confront an allegation.
@nikkihaley I'm American like you - &amp; you're always knocking the Russian Federation with bullsh*t. &amp; it pisses me off. Why not attack Saudi Arabia who was responsible for 09/11 - you keep it up you're going to get us in a war we can't win. USA needs Russia - USA doen't need you!
@RT_com charter a plane and send these immigrants on to the Western Sahara with a parachute, food, and a tent. They came from Mohammad's land - then they can go back to Mohammad's land.
@FoxNews RE-VICTIMIZED? you're the one who opened your big mouth with wild ass claims like you're some saint sent from heaven itself. People defend themselves &amp; now you learned why unless you have evidence - at least publicly - silence is golden. Shame on you!
@anna_sorget @realDonaldTrump R U serious? I'm an expert in the Islamic ideology. Sharia is not optional; it is prescribed for believers (5:48), &amp;, the Qur'an (33:36) says that it is not fitting for a believer to choose for themselves (i.e., disregard) any matter already decided by Allah. Don't talk shit 2me
@MyDesert You offend me by apologizing to radical feminists who believe they can verbally sexually assault males on the sole basis that women never lie because they have vaginas instead of due process, valid complaint &amp; right to confront before being prosecuted by these elitist morons.
@anna_sorget @realDonaldTrump Islamists are domestic enemies in the United States strictly on the basis of wanting to replace the government with sharia law. They should be arrested and imprisoned en mass.
@realDonaldTrump The Muslim community is now controlling Democratic Party hierarchy &amp; purse strings, &amp; are responsible for the political violence now becoming their trademark. It is time to label the Demo Party as a "SOFT TERRORIST ORGANIZATION" &amp; DOMESTIC ENEMY. Start the arrests!
@realDonaldTrump The future problem is going to be, "Who and hell wants the job if that is what it takes in the job interview to get it? - My congratulations to Judge Kavanaugh. Great courage confronting the feminist elitists who believe we're suppose to believe women because they have a vagina.
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit So, who is paying these people to travel, take off work, and show up there? Curious. And, let's not forget it is the Muslims who control the Demo Party hierarchy  &amp; money. They not only infiltrated the party but took over the leadership = political violence.
@HonAhmedHussen You are an amazing man Mr. Hussen. May God Bless you and your family.
@AdyBarkan @lsarsour you want to replace a woman who afford Const. rights afforded every person in America because she doesn't believe that just because a human being has a vagina that everyone is suppose to believe that person? She will be re-elected &amp; you are a domestic enemy. That's my opinion.
@lsarsour The Qur'an affords no secular or Christian values any rights whatsoever, so why do you think we should afford you rights where those rights are used to subjugate our rights? Pres. Jefferson called Muslims, "pirates". He read the Qur'an &amp; stormed Tripoli with Marines after bombing
@lsarsour Are you fuc*ing nuts? You expect some kind of Const. Exemption Doctrine to deny a man having due process, a written complaint, identifiable source, &amp; the right to confront versus someone because they have a vagina &amp; they say so? There's no amendment affording exemption of rights.
@FoxNews Give me a break ABA!Let's take all of your asses in front of the public letting the elitist deep state feminists verbally attack you w/  verbal sexual assaults publicized on television, news papers etc. and tell me you wouldn't come at them with a baseball bat. Stupid ass morons!
@lisamurkowski You have deferred Constitutional rights to a person's due process to have a written complaint, identifiable source, and the right to confront vs. feminist elitists dictating we must believe a woman because she's got a vagina? Bullsh*t to U madam. Angry Alaskan 2 VOTE U OUT!
@USANEWS007 @lisamurkowski I used Dept of Law - State of Alaska statistics that can be downloaded from their website. They are proud of such a high conviction rate - that assures the lawyers get the dividend check of defendants and NEVER win a case. Corruption at its finest!
@Lauribi3 YOU BET IT'S TRUE! I used the State of Alaska's Department of Law's own statistics that I found in my research for a project. If you are arrested you will be convicted. I couldn't find the criteria that Alaska uses on who they target to meet their quota.
@USANEWS007 @lisamurkowski Alaska is strong feminist state with a 99.6% conviction rate, quota system of arrests where lawyers seize the Alaska permanent dividend of a defendant then lose their cases. Women who file sexual case against Alaskan man receives $100,000 in victim compensation, their college $
@TheDemCoalition bullshit! Just because a woman has a vagina doesn't mean she must be believed &amp; deny a man due process, with a criminal report &amp; right to confront. Democrats &amp; MSM demanding Const. Exemption Doctrine are demanding Const. Treason.
@lisamurkowski As an Alaskan, U have set a bad example &amp; precedent. The feminists belief that they deserve to have a Const. exemption doctrine &amp; be believed because they have a vagina is unconscionable &amp; violates due process of a complaint and confrontation. UR NON-VOTE FOR CONST.TREASON! SHAME
@SenatorMenendez It's a bullshit investigation because it was a bullshit tactic to make wild accusations without a valid criminal police report for a man to confront. The Const. Exemption Doctrine allowing feminists to publicly conviction a person without trial is bullshit and must be stopped.
@USAmbNATO Madam, R U smoking marijuana? Seriously? Russian Federation isn't a 3rd world nation w/o the ability to neutralize us. Hyper-sonic missiles, FOAB's, S500's, mobilize 300K men overnight. Jets =2 our F-35. Smaller navy? Sure but different strategies. USA can't win a war with RF.
@MSNBC Our Demo Party Leftists propaganda clearly shows how many ignorant Americans believe whatever they are told. What about the Bill of Rights - an original police report &amp; right to confront versus compelled to believe ALL WOMEN? FU*K OFF - i SEE CIVIL WAR coming to America soon! Sad
@CChristineFair In fact, your political remarks if taught our students to degrade our government - you should be terminated on the spot. Too many Democrats are turning to political violence dictating we must agree or be destroyed. Go to hell because it's NOT white men being harmed. IT'S ALL MEN.
@CChristineFair Feminists use &amp; abuse the Const. Exemption Doctrine by dictating all women must be believed against the Bill of Rights. No confrontation, against a brutal attack by "verbally sexually assaulting" men. There is NO exemption doctrine in our Const. &amp; your remarks are Const. treason.
@redsteeze Democratic Party isn't listening to their party  grass roots - using the feminist's right to Const. Exemption Doctrine to undermine the right to due process will destroy the Demo Party - People will walk away. Got a complaint - call the police, Don't force people believe a woman.
@redsteeze Dr. Ford's "visual evidence" she presented by psychotically looking away &amp; "glazing into the abyss" (blank-glares) is known as as an untruthful trait. She should be arrested &amp; charged - notwithstanding liable for slander &amp; libelous per se. STOP Const. exemption doctrine for women
@SheaTycho @FoxNews @TomCottonAR @SenFeinstein Jesus came from his Mother. And, the Jewish ideology of that time demanded his murder. I didn't make up the Jewish comment of "it's okay to lie to the lamb". They did. I'm an atheist and independent thinker.
@ABC It is scandalous that this concept of women are always truthful being afforded some kind of Constitutional Exemption Doctrine right that feminists can use to verbally sexually assault any man in their way - with no right to innocence or confrontation - is Constitutional treason
@ABC Rep. Jerrold Nadler - get a reality check from grass-roots democrats. DROP THIS CASE - if it is the position of the Democratic Party to undermine constitutional rights for any person to be accused and convicted publicly without due process. The Demo Party will be destroyed.
@RyanZinke Quite difficult to believe the USA would dare attempt to blockade the Russian Federation naval fleet in any capacity. Their counter strike would obliterate any naval forces equally devastating as we could do to them. It's not an option - not in our best interest. DUMB
@FoxNews @TomCottonAR @SenFeinstein America should always remember a unique expression used by our American Jewish community - it's okay to "lie to the lamb". The hidden meaning is Christians with respect to Christian values in American politics. They solely seek political power to undermine American values.
@CNNPolitics @cnnbrk really stunned? Are you fu*king kidding me? You attacked a man using a feminist strategy of publicly verbally assaulting a man in public claiming innocence. To that to some other man - they'd come back with a gun &amp; neutralize the attackers. No more exemption doctrine for women BS
@dmock70 @gerardinebaugh @TheView Was your attacker Brett Kavanaugh? No! There is a process - start with filing a complaint with the police - from there the suspect will be arrested - and have their day in court to admit, deny, or plead no contest - and justice is served. To believe someone based on sex is BS.
@latimes @DavidGSavage Totally disagree with article &amp; journalist's assessment. Mr. Kavanaugh didn't testify as a "judge". He testified as an innocent man being attacked by feminists under conditions of a "verbal sexual assault" claiming exemption from Const. due process dictating we must believe women
@CBSThisMorning @LindseyGrahamSC Judge Kavanaugh was not afforded due process - a legitimate complaint file with police and the right to confront before a jury of his peers &amp; to believe we must believe ALL women's claims is unconstitutional - being used by feminists for a power grab against any man who disagrees
@CBSThisMorning @LindseyGrahamSC INDEED, I WAS SYMPATHETIC to Dr. Ford's allegations - UNTIL SHE TESTIFIED! Her decor provided "VISUAL EVIDENCE" of "glazing into the abyss" - a blank-stare - &amp; looking away into space - a trait of fabricating events to meet ones own needs. ie: false swearing. I believe the Judge
@CBSThisMorning @LindseyGrahamSC I don't believe we allow deep state feminists to attack American men under some Constitutional Exemption Doctrine with verbal sexual assaults. NEEDS to STOP. If there's a complaint the process says call the police. ABUSING &amp; UNDERMINING THE CONST. PROCESS FAR EXCEEDS ANY BENEFIT.
@latimes @DavidGSavage Totally disagree with UR assessment. Tended to believe Dr. Ford's testimony B4 she testified. visual evidence; Her  decor of "glazing into the abyss" (blank-look) is w/o doubt a trait of untruthfulness. Any innocent man subjected to a verbal sexual assault - WOW - he did good!
@Jeremy_Hunt With all due respect Mr. Hunt - I'm American &amp; I don't buy allegations that Russia &amp; Syria are using chemical weapons. Why? Because they have FOAB's that could obliterate the rebels in 10 seconds if needed and not a word would be said. Stupid allegation is outdated.
@Jeremy_Hunt I disagree totally with you. Russian Federation emerged from USSR as a Christian value nation eager to work with UK, USA, &amp; EU - But the Saudi alliance with these same nations obstructs this happening with their $ &amp; interference. So, I think you're talking sh*t sir.
@ABCPolitics Let the GOP put Mazie in his seat. Mazie's temperament coming back into the hearing would be a  suicide bomber neutralizing domestic enemies. Judge's composure was extraordinary - vicious attack being verbally sexually assaulted by the feminists using Const. Exemption Doctrine.
@GeraldoRivera TOTALLY CONCUR.. IF he were guilty  - her claim is he @ 17 was trying to "feel her up outside of her clothes" in a bedroom. The problems are witnesses refute her statement. Her psychotic "glare into the abyss" (blank-look) during testimony is "visual evidence" of untruthfulness.
@LauraLoomer Attacking @keithellison is racist &amp; discriminatory. The Qur'an from the words of the Prophet tells the followers that a woman should be beat ever so often. This is a religious belief &amp; the woman knew the consequences of an Islamic relationship. Shame on you!
@JeremyW91842810 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump What lie are you talking about? Dr. Ford's "visual evidence" of glazing into the abyss - the lowered eyes/blank stare - that psychoanalysts evaluate as an instinctual reaction to false swearing? Or feminists using the "verbally sexually assaulting" men to propagate their power?

@guskenworthy Son, please take a course in psychoanalysis. Dr. Ford provided "visual evidence" of untruthfulness when lowering her head &amp; "gazing into the abyss" (blank-look) under examination. This conduct is a psychological trait found in criminals when they lie. Who's telling the truth? IDK
@tehpeggy @bostonnewslocal Kavanaugh was brutally attacked with vicious feminist rhetoric using a technique that "verbally sexually assaults" men. Dr. Ford provided "visual evidence" of "glazing into the abyss" (blank-looks) a distinct unconscionable act of untruthfulness. How would you react if innocent?

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo @POTUS I WANTED TO BELIEVE DR. FORD. BUT, I CAN'T! Part of FACT FINDING is the visual evidence one acquires while watching people testify. She continually looks deep into the abyss (the blank stare) while testifying. Something's not right!
@SenatorCantwell Standing behind women who "verbally sexually assault" men on behalf of Demo Party deep state feminist elitists using and condoning these kinds of unconstitutional tactics in support of a Const. Exemption Doctrine to create unlawful politically correct laws is a bunch of BS Maria!
@EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Michael Avenatti is a degenerate pervert thriving on Demo Party feminists who prey on men via "verbal sexual assaults" - ie: the accuser did "trains" with lots of men, never once filing a complaint - meaning consensual slut sex - Y should Kavanaugh  break up her fun? Bullsh*t U!
@realDonaldTrump OMG - @MichaelAvenatti block me from reading his salacious "verbal sexual assaults" on targeted men by the deep state elitist feminists targeting men that may do away with their Const. Exemption Doctrine for their politically correct unconstitutional laws reducing men to animals

@SecPompeo Mr. Secretary, this is one issue we deeply disagree on. The only reason for the USA to degrade Iran is to maintain ties with the most heinous regime in the world - Saudi Arabia - a nation that should have ceased to exist on 09/12/2001
@psgsr160 @johnrobertsFox @PressSec I have read the Qur'an too! ! That book only calls Jesus a prophet.
@psgsr160 @johnrobertsFox @PressSec I think you have been smoking some hard core weed! lol
@rearentryfun @SmashRacismDC Very true. It doesn't even have to be Mr. Cruz - but if I were an owner of a restaurant with prominent guests who - with all due respect - paying customers - are disrupted by a bunch of people storming into my business, they would have been escorted out with a gun if necessary.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sir, isn't it time to shut down the feminist Const. Exemption Doctrine that verbally sexually assaults men &amp; convicts them without trial B4 public? No more exemptions - hidden identities - equal to men - Men aren't their slaves. By the Constitution.
@psgsr160 @johnrobertsFox @PressSec Are your names mixed up? Bush &amp; assoc received Saudi $1.5 bil after leaving office. Clintons, Brennan, McCain, Obama Demo Party all on Saudi $. 09/11 terrorists from Saudi Wahhabi Sect of Islam - so we attack Iraq? Saudi $ in MSM, gov &amp; military &amp; you say Trump? Thank God 4 Trump
@NancyPelosi It is all bulls*it - Mueller needs to be removed  - he is a Saudi pawn and nothing more than a deep state elitists attempting to overthrow the government - you all need to be arrested.
@NancyPelosi The Islamic controlled Demo Party is going to continue to disrupt government to a point where the public is going to rebel against the party and your ass is going to jail.
@SmashRacismDC Your organization is so filled with Demo Party - Islamic controlled bullsh*t that you're nothing more than pawns propagating violence - and in the end - you will be destroyed. Not America - you will lose - because you're dumbsh*t idiots.
@SmashRacismDC I think the restaurant should have intervened and thrown the disrupters  out.
@CNNPolitics I'm just an American. Where is Avenatti coming from? He attacks Trump &amp; now this judge guy. Who the hell is Avenatti trying to interfere in our government using sexual verbal assaults on the feminist claim some kind of Const. exemption doctrine? I think this guy's talk sh*t
@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump Mr. President: I have a complaint about Sec. @SecPompeo Pompeo - He is one of the few gentlemen that I feel extreme comfortable with representing our U.S. of A. His decor is both warm, amicable, and yet firm as a man among men! Great choice! ;) Great!
@johnrobertsFox @PressSec Not firing this traitor who sought an internal U.S. coup to over throw the government of the United States is a waste of government tax $ keeping him on the payroll when he should be arrested, charged, &amp; taken to trial for treason! FIRE the Ba*t*rD.
@jennybethm This situation is as bizarre as my book, "The Christophe Rocancourt Affair" when the alleged victim told me  to read police reports and talk to witnesses she identified. Every single witness claimed she was talking sh*t - and maybe that is why she told me &amp; the police that. Why?
@SenSchumer Are you fu*k*ng serious? I'm American first - not a Rep. or Demo - this conduct is tantamount to overthrowing the government from within - This is treason - Rosenstein shouldn't be fired. He should be arrested &amp; charged with the capital offense - How dare you sustain this conduct
@realDonaldTrump This Dr. Ford is a fuc*king fruit cake. It's time to stop the Const. Exemption Doctrine depriving men of Const. right to afford women additional right to make them Equal? Bullsh*t. They should be treated equal - if an accuser - face to face &amp; identified publicly.
@SecPompeo @POTUS The PEOPLE are sick of seeing MUELLER'S face every God damn day AFTER we ELECTED YOU! Get RID of the son of a bitch and do it now! He's become the FACE behind the President with SECRET powers to DESTROY. TERMINATE HIM. Cant you see they're attaching him to you?

@TheJCMorning @jennobenno @PaulBegala She's trying to convict some guy apparently from some "WET DREAM' she had - doesn't know where or when &amp; her witness says she's talking B-LLsH*T - Charge her with verbally sexually assaulting the Judge!
@SenBobCorker @ChuckGrassley Dr. Ford talks B-sh*T- Congress must stop the Const. exemption doctrine  depriving men of confrontation to make women "equal" by convicting men without a shred of evidence. She doesn't know when or where, her witness doesn't agree - her remembrance appears 2 B a wet dream!
@TheJCMorning @jennobenno @PaulBegala her story not sustained by  HER "witness" she cited. Scorned girlfriend or nut case? 35 years ago? Come under juvenile law at best. Why now? These women's extra rights under some Const. exemption doctrine HAS TO GO! Got a complaint? FILE IT AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED CRIME or FO
@PaulBegala Polygraphs are NOT an exact science &amp; aren't creditable. Voice stress analysis is a far better science. The man who cut off both of a woman's arms - "passed" a polygraph  &amp; release on parole only to murder another woman. Pass? He didn't "pass" shit! It doesn't work &amp; isn't valid!
@PaulBegala This is why the man who cut off both of his victims arms "passed" a polygraph, then let out on parole &amp; murdered another woman. He didn't pass sh*t! It doesn't work Voice stress analysis is a far more credible science that polygraphs because - polygraphs is not an exact science
@PaulBegala Polygraphs are worthless! Any Electronic tech will tell you this. Why? The electronic feedback is displayed via mechanical arms. 3 calibrated receivers w/ mechanical arms of 1 exact input signal - results in 3 different conclusions. Polygraphs are NOT calibrated with 3 others.
@NancyPelosi Dr. Ford is talking sh*t - revenge for Kavanugh's mother foreclosing on the family home or a young woman who was scorned wants international fame to offset her pathetic existence.  And, you're worse! YOU engage in verbal sexual assaults against men without their right to confron
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump The bottom line lady is that Islam has infiltrated the Democratic Party &amp; pays $ to many officials - while their goal to to destroy our government. &amp; many others like  U R one of those treasonable people who should be charged, arrested, and imprisoned as a domestic enemy. RESIGN
@realDonaldTrump Dismantle the FBI then reorganize it with professionalism. Very easy to do in order to remove these deep state elitists.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I have attached exclusive evidence of Russians on US soil conspiring with Americans to alter the outcome of the Presidency. Here are their mug shots! Give me a break Nancy! You're a deep state elitist &amp; Demo being funded by the Saudi political-religious Wahhabi - terrorists!! https://t.co/BKwScXmB5I
@GeraldoRivera @JohnKerry We caught the Russian meddlers with their American conspirators right here in the USA - Mueller should arrest them or since Mueller, McCain, Clintons, CIA Dir are all funded by Saudi Wahhabi $ - maybe the Russians are a diversion from Saudi meddling &amp; buying off our politicians? https://t.co/9L1QvbUKw6
@GeraldoRivera We caught the American illegal alien smugglers &amp; they were with the Russian Meddlers too! Contact Mueller for arrests! lol https://t.co/iB5h11sLYB
@NancyPelosi Personally, lady - I don't know if this "woman" is some old "rejected" girlfriend of someone who finally made national attention &amp; "the wrath of a woman scorned" but waiting 40 years to complain is bul*sh*t - I don't buy the feminists verbal sexual attacks on men.  Bullsh*t on U
@KhurramParvez I am quite confident that the people who were most probably being shot at for hours by this "rebel" don't consider removing his body any worse than seeing the brains of their comrades splattered on the wall. War is hell! Get used to it or seek peace.
@SenFeinstein Personally, lady - I don't know if this "woman" is some old "rejected" girlfriend of someone who finally made national attention &amp; "the wrath of a woman scorned" but waiting 40 years to complain is bul*sh*t - I don't buy the feminists verbal sexual attacks on men.  Bullsh*t on U
@michaelschweitz That's some kind of "white power" hand gesture? Someone is talking sh*t - if you ask me. Let the boy go! Someone's delusions are NOT his problem.  Ex-Coastie here!
@realDonaldTrump @USAGSessions @DHSgov @SecPompeo - https://t.co/65k6bmWouL This US Border Agent killed more people in 1 week than illegal immigrants killed all year! They harass the hell out of Americans inside of the USA &amp; coming home. 09/11 No Saudis banned &amp; they attacked us?
@KremlinRussia_E @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump RUSSIAN MEDDLERS NABBED inside of USA! Russians caught contacting their USA conspirators! American-Russian conspirators caught will illegal aliens!

@fema @realDonaldTrump FEMA needs to restructure an intense rapid deployment relief standard. China had 100k troops with picks &amp; shovels on the ground in 24 hours in one local disaster. We don't have sh*t going on to protect our people in nuclear or natural disasters. Reality check!
@SecPompeo @JohnKerry @SecPompeo -  Sir, you are totally correct within the perspective of a former government official undermining a new administrative position. However, within the content of the meeting - there is freedom of association &amp; speech unless Kerry is marrying the guy - IMBRA laws = jail
@metesohtaoglu I'm American &amp; our U.S.A. with 100 marines is talking sh*t about any warning. Why? Russian Federation just deployed their marines with ships &amp; air support. Mobilized 300,000 men &amp; 1000 aircraft. There's no way -  USA can muster troops with 800+ overseas bases. Turkey will provoke

@vvanwilgenburg @DefenseUnits Come on @SecPompeo do your research sir! Iran is a "Shiite" Islamic-political state religion. The Chinese Islamist are SUNNI - the same political-ideology of the Islamic States: https://t.co/cAdjG2sBkm - Di you really give a shi*t about an ideology that would behead UR Momma? OK!
@vvanwilgenburg @DefenseUnits He should be tried, and sentenced to the fate of any human being he murdered as I Islamic State jihadist, whether it be hanging, shot, beheaded, burned alive,  or crucified.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @DeptofDefense Sir R U Serious our 100 US Marines sent to Syria R a strong msg to Russians? Our men aren't supermen &amp; RF has FOAB'S + 300K troops waiting to be transported in 24 hours. Get the fu*ck out of Syria b4 ass kicked!  https://t.co/f26647tqj8
@HellerWeather NOAH described the phenomenon when climate change occurs. There are so many typhoons that it will rain for 40 days &amp; nights flooding the world before it stabilizes!  It's my opinion we are in the beginning process of another Great World Flood!
@nikkihaley @USUN We need to tone down our rhetoric threatening every single nation that doesn't dance to our tune. Most of all stop treating the Russians like their a worthless piece of sh*t! They have many weapons more advanced than our own &amp; a war with them is a N0_WIN-NO_WIN situation for USA
@AmbJohnBolton We can't defend ourselves with troops in 800 countries &amp; NONE at home. Show me you can muster 300,000 troops downtown WASH DC in 48 hours &amp; I will believe you - otherwise we're talking shit to the world. Our troops in Syria will be murdered by your wishful thoughts
@AmbJohnBolton Pls counsel Pres Trump to get our troops out of Syria's religious-political war &amp; stop threatening parties. Can you muster 300K troops in 24 hours or like China 100K troops transported in 24 Hrs? Fu*k NO! FOAB'S &amp; hyper-sonic missiles are a reality. Thats a fact!
@JazzDeeApple @m5drummer @LAPDHQ I don't assume shit. I heard the way she acted towards the guy with total disregard for introduction protocol when she starts talking about him. That's targeting. First remarks? You were stopped for _ and may I see your identification_ PERIOD. She's not his fucking Mom or GF.
@DebraMessing WoW - Being a neutral party - everyone should know that the Immigration polices were inherited by President Trump and in place before he took office.
@nikkihaley R U fu*king serious threatening Russia on Idlib? How quick can we muster 300,000 troops &amp; 1k jets? China transferred 100K men in 24 hrs 4 disaster relief! We're spread all over the world &amp; can't defend ourselves. FOAB's &amp; armed with hyper-sonic missiles is reality. DF
@amybwang @gwlaw Justice Ginsburg is totally correct. The politicization of the Judicial branch became rampant under Pres. Obama &amp; is now branching out its tentacles to force political correct &amp; a constitutional exemption doctrine philosophy that has no business in the USSC or any other court!.
@realDonaldTrump So how many troops can we muster as a show of force = to or greater than Vostok 2018 to protect Wash. D.C. - within a week?  EMERGENCY PARADE - May I suggest that the USA couldn't do it at all - Our troops stationed around the world protect everyone but America.
@JazzDeeApple @m5drummer @LAPDHQ correct &amp; maybe not in all cases - but many that leads to "targeting". There are pros and cons to every side - that is all that I am trying to show.
@JazzDeeApple @m5drummer @LAPDHQ They sure do! If they don't meet their quota they lose their $100K job
@SecPompeo WTF are we allying ourselves with the Saudi regime? Not to mention giving them billions of dollars worth of military arms? My God they are only as big as Peru! Give me a break! We are more responsible than they are - we gave them the weapons!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @VP @DefenseDep_FPS Sir - hold an EMERGENCY PARADE in D.C. = Russia's Vostok 2018! WHY? China sent 100k troops for domestic disaster in 24 hours. Russia amasses 300k troops, 1k jets, ships instantly. How the hell can you defend US equally?  PROVE IT!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. President, quit wasting your precious time on these dumb fu*ks, you have more important things to do! I CHALLENGE YOU - as the Commander in Chief to show what America's military can do! Emergency Parade in Washington D.C. equal to Vostok 2018 - or else the USA is in DEEP SHIT
@m5drummer @LAPDHQ hate to rain on your BS rhetoric, many states (Alaska) using their own statistics have a 99.6% conviction rate;  quota for arrests sustained by the Alaska Sup. Ct; Dividend checks mandatory given to lawyers as 1st creditor. ie: if you're arrested you will be convicted. Dumb fuck!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @VP - Mr. Pres, I heard you sent 100 Marines to Syria to scare the Russians? Sir, read this: https://t.co/UOUYLqabG8	Can we mobilize 300,000 men overnight for one "drill"? Get your shit together sir &amp; tekk Deep State assholes to get a reality check.
@US_Secy_State That's right &amp; never forget the attackers were Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect Muslims - we attacked the wrong nation &amp; now restrict Americans, Canadians  &amp; Mexicans. President Bush should have been charged with treason.
@italianmystery @LAPDHQ Always getting WAPS talking BS
@italianmystery @LAPDHQ Being a God damn cop doesn't make a person Jesus Christ himself - that is all I am saying - The cop knew him - was going to use him - dumb shit had a gun &amp; died. Life goes on - Liberal? I'm no Muslim in the Democratic Party asshole
@italianmystery @LAPDHQ look fuckhead - keep to the topic - squirt your mouthy shit at someone else. Lady is talking shit to him before she even asks ID - meeting her quota for arrests? I don't condone murder &amp; he's a fuck up - disgustingly he killed - because he knew her motive. to fuck him &amp; he's dead
@m5drummer @LAPDHQ The lady cop introduced herself and who he was before he ever said a word. Which means she had contact with him before - and most likely she was using him to fill her quota of arrests. Sometimes slight bits of information tells us alot - just like a picture can tell 1,000 words.
@LAPDHQ It seems like the driver was being targeted since the police already knew who he was? hmmm. Something's not right - but killing people shouldn't be the alternative.
@WolfOfWeedST @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump  I agree that we should leave the gentleman alone. It's possible he has cancer or wants to relax. Cigarettes which are highly addictive should be more of a concern to intrusive elements dictating life styles of fellow Americans.
@SenKamalaHarris Totally disagree with you! Too many times Women's groups demand some kind of unconstitutional "exemption doctrine" based on political correctness to equalize women to men. They are already "equal" except they're women! I was pro-abortion until I saw videos from the womb. Murder!
@realDonaldTrump I have concluded that there are only FOUR possible people suspicious to be a "spy" in your administration - that's OBVIOUS - you can figure that out - cross-referencing syntax with the 4. You can conclude 1 by  prior Islamic ties - because of lies. GOT UR MAN
@starsandstripes Maybe these Muslims are replacing all of the Americans that the U.S. government is abandoning overseas under stupid ass laws dictating who can marry who depriving Americans of right to marry, have kids &amp; stay a family. Our exile makes room for them to take our place! BS-USA
@starsandstripes Sounds great! I'm a veteran too! Problem is under IMBRA &amp; related laws, I as an American with 2 US kids am DENIED right to sponsor my wife 2 US &amp; she has cancer. Do I abandon HER or our kids? Or Kids 2 be forcibly separated forever without MOM? I will stay unified FAM in EXILE.
@Yourshouldertal @FoxNews @nikkihaley I feel exactly the same! Problems arise when we keep attacking these nations on all fronts - like their 3rd world worthless &amp; defenseless "nothings" &amp; we are kept in the dark that a Russian &amp; Chinese war on us - would obliterate us - we have no bomb shelters 4 our ppl &amp; they do!
@realDonaldTrump DON'T SUGGEST that if their adversaries could ever impeach you that it's your followers fault! IT's YOUR FAULT! Why? Because every God damn one of them, including MSM is backed by SAUDI $, a gov that infiltrates US politics using Russia as a diversion &amp; U did 0
@FoxNews @nikkihaley Madam - Reality Check Please! Russian Federation isn't a 3rd world country that can't defend itself - Why the hell would they use archaic chemical weapons when they have FOAB's that can obliterate Idlib and end the war in 2 minutes? I don't buy your BS supporting Deep State hawks
@POTUS Mr. President: An unknown breach resides in your office! Only one option available. Advise your employees to go into a room &amp; discuss the breach. Explain, "either one person resigned immediately or you have to discharge everyone!" AND, DO SO without delay!

@realDonaldTrump This is an unfortunate situation with highly flammable consequences regardless of who is President. There is confidant at the highest national level undermining the Presidency - like a spy, undercover cop, or subversive that has knowledge of national security issues. Arrest them
@realDonaldTrump MSM using anonymous to attack a branch of government claiming insider or spy inside of your immediate administration requires immediate investigation and arrest. Or admission by MSM the article was written by one of their own. Extremely serious sir! A breach of National Security
@Kaepernick7 Son, I believe you are misguided. The American nation &amp; the Fore Fathers created our American values. More whites than blacks are murdered by police. Look at who you are attracting? Brennan? He took an oath of allegiance to his Sunni Wahhabi imam &amp; Ummah Islam while CIA director.
@realDonaldTrump It's  NOT wise to threaten Syria &amp; the Russia, nor fabricate Chemical weapons being used. The Russians have their FOABs that are 10 times stronger than our MOAB's &amp; could obliterate Idlib within TWO MINUTES. If you attack the Russians - our troops may cease to exist in Syria.
@realDonaldTrump USA does NOT need to be involved in an ISLAMIC POLITICAL-RELIGIOUS WAR! Assad PROTECTS Christians &amp; other minorities. The SUNNI ideology (Turkey, Saudi Arabia etc.) in the past &amp; with ISIS commit genocide against Christians &amp; minorities. NONE of the players would defend America!
@realDonaldTrump WTF are you doing threatening Syria over Idlib? Sir, get the hell out of that "rat's nest" - it is a political-religious war. Study the Ottoman Sunnis genocide of Christians &amp; Armenians. Separation of Religion &amp; USA - its not our war. It's Allah's!!
@azcentral @realDonaldTrump @MeghanMcCain President Trump's eulogy: May he rest in peace with Allah. I pray the $1 million a year donation from the Saudis didn't influence his votes in Congress. BTW didn't those 09/11 terrorists belong to the same Saudi "state" religion of Sunni Wahhabi thats sponsored by the Saudi gov?
@McSally2018 @azcentral @realDonaldTrump @MeghanMcCain Mr. McCain's passed away. In the military he just tried to do his job. As a Senator, he took Saudi $1 mil a year. The same Saudis who have a "state" religion called Wahhabism &amp; the same ideology that bomb USA in 09/11 money from terrorists to conceal their terror. He's no hero!
@RussiaUN  то взорвать второй FOAB возле города, чтобы заверить мятежников, это только одно решение. Таким образом, Российская Федерация развеет смешные требования об использовании «химического оружия» и превалирует перед миром.

@FoxNews on one hand, I respect his service for his nation when he was younger. And, on the other hand, later when he started accepting foreign Saudi $ @ a million a year donation, did I question his political allegiance to American interests over Saudi Arabian infiltration into our gov.
@SecPompeo Sir, Pres. Bush should have known that as a natural conclusion that Iraq with its huge Shiite population would lean towards Iran after Hussein was toppled instead of attacking Saudi Arabia. He was a dumb shit or committed treason or both.
@realDonaldTrump You're the President - every word is sacred to those who follow you and can be twisted into a sword of wrath for those who don't! Words of wisdom, "Beware of the Ides of March!" spoken to Caesar..
@geertwilderspvv President Jefferson read the Qur'an learning to negotiate with Muslims. After reading their book, he created a navel armada, &amp; sent the U.S. Marines in to storm Tripoli. &amp; he called them PIRATES &amp; was called a "HERO". Does Pakistan run the Dutch gov and make its laws? No - So?
@realDonaldTrump well - YOU have to protect AMERICA'S NATIONAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH! BAN all international control of our mainstream media - start with SAUDI ARABIA - Only the news created from inside the internal boundaries of the USA - others must be labeled: FOREIGN NEWS SOURCE
@ABCPolitics Well Katrina wasn't exactly a success either. And, how is the US prepared to protect Americans in a nuclear war? Put duck tape on the windows? Russia had a 420 sq mile underground city. China has 5 layer subways. USA has duck tape. We need to rid ourselves of you w/ vote.
@NancyPelosi Lady, I'm a Democrat &amp; your treasonable alliance with Islam knowing their political agenda to replace our gov with sharia law. Well, I'd put you in jail and thank God there is Trump until we get deep state elitists like you out of government &amp; in jail even if it means NEW party
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Why would Russian Federation use chemical weapons to take Idlib, when all they have to do it warn the rebels that if there is no peace agreement with Syria, they will use their FOAB to end the war immediately?
@RusEmbUSA @UN @mfa_russia @StateDept @RussiaUN @tassagency_en Why would Russia use chemical weapons to take Idlib, when all you have to do it warn the rebels if there is no peace agreement with Syria, you will use your FOAB to end the war immediately?
@RresidentRussia Why would you use chemical weapons to take Idlib, when all you have to do it warn the rebels if there is no peace agreement with Syria, you will use your FOAB to end the war immediately?
@matteocarr You're wrong! AMA told Muslims to infiltrate the Demo party. They now control the financial strings &amp; propagate Islamic political violence. Pass the Religious Freedom  Bill? Read closely! it appoints a Muslim Ambassador to Islam. Beware of deep state elitists - funded by Saudi $

@TeedyW Hogwash! A child has no knowledge where they are born! Wherever that may be is there homeland. Don't forget that! Only a deep state elitist with sadistic perceptions with no social values would say such a thing! Fraud is the person "crying wolf" depriving a baby birthright! Shame
@realDonaldTrump @espn I was absolutely shocked by the conduct of ESPN degrading both the Presidency &amp; Tiger Woods for his most appropriate comments. This bullshit is going to far - and maybe these comments should be prosecuted for libel per se? These comments are not news - its hate speech
@SecPompeo The Iranian boats parked in the Strait says that what Iran says is true. Unless you plan to move them off the road? I mean waterway!
@Lrihendry Absolutely NOT! That constitutes despotism and not the will of the people. She has the option to run for office. She is not her father, nor does she have his credentials.
@messymason @TrumpsArmy @M2Madness @eavesdropann What's the question? Whether you're and asshole or an idiot or that you have a supportive argument over a specific issue rather than degrading someone who is voicing an opinion?
@messymason @TrumpsArmy @M2Madness @eavesdropann I am not paid to say shit - lol - I'm paid to write motion picture screenplays and books. I speak my mind, do my research first from a neutral perspective, change opinions if facts are contrary to the general opinions. and tell assholes why they're idiots with supportive facts.
@XHRMAN Background checks are fine regarding the alien spouse - but IMBRA was based upon an Ethiopian refugee &amp; her Muslim tormentors. The lawyer now receives 12 mil a year using Americans as her diversion. It stops Americans sponsoring wives for so much as  DUI. I know, I'm one of them
@XHRMAN Seriously? If you're married do you believe that you must be forced into a conversation with your wife, subject to imprisonment &amp; fine about expunged, sealed, or acquittals or complaints prosecuted or not? Gov is barred under the 9th from intruding into associations &amp; marriage.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You're fucking up sir! Asia has different standards. You must provide a saving face issue - such as deescalate on one or two issues helping their economy &amp; you will get what you want. Deal with them on an Asian scale, not a European scale. Otherwise you're fucking up a good deal
@POTUS Fake news is easy to fix sir! To protect "America's Freedom of Speech" rights as a nation, ban all foreign and international ownership of USA mainstream media. For those who are partly owned international, require a disclaimer that their news is NOT based in the USA!
@realDonaldTrump This is an issue easy to fix sir! To protect "America's Freedom of Speech" rights as a nation, ban all foreign and international ownership of USA mainstream media. For those who are partly owned international, require a disclaimer that their news is NOT based in the USA!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I will counsel you as an American citizen on what to say to AG Sessions: "Mr. Sessions, it's great that your independent. This establishes that I am NOT biased by terminating you. YOUR TERMINATED! Get the hint Mr. President? Deep state elitist are dangerous! to USA
@USAGSessions Do you know what you have just said &amp; done? You are not independent. You are not appointed by the Congress or the Supreme Court. He is appointed by the United States President &amp; your office is under his authority!
@GovernmentZA @realDonaldTrump @PresidencyZA I understand your ideals about providing your citizens land. USA had a Homestead Act that gave people free land. Breaking up commercial farms to give land with no tools, machinery, seed, will destroy your nation.
@northjersey If I were the Professor, I'd put everything in a reality check perspective &amp; sue the hell out of the University. Why? There is freedom of speech 2. He was never convicted of harassment or discrimination in a court of law. 3. Univ is violating his mental thoughts - written words.
@Alwaleed_Talal @realDonaldTrump Under what custom, tradition, or cultural permission allows you to interfere in USA politics? There is too much Saudi $ diverted to US politicians via 3rd parties, donations, lobbying, etc. It's my opinion Russia is a diversion to impede Saudi meddling investigation. Reciprocal?
@AnnaApp91838450 @AZWS The Big Confrontation would expose "treason" to the Elists is why! Every single major anti-Trump politician has $ ties to Saudi Arabia, from Brennan, McCain, Bush, Clintons who used Russia as a diversion to avoid the Saudi confrontation with their political-Islamic Wahhabi sect.
@RussiaUN Россия должна открыть свои двери для новых американских иммигрантов, предложив проживание и 5 акров. Наблюдайте за тем, как правительство США сходит с ума, когда их граждане принимают предложение.
@mfa_russia Россия должна открыть свои двери для новых американских иммигрантов, предложив проживание и 5 акров. Наблюдайте за тем, как правительство США сходит с ума, когда их граждане принимают предложение.

@AmbJohnBolton Sir, advise Trump to get his shit together. Confront his adversaries with investigation! From Mueller to McCain, Bush, Brennan, Clinton - all ties to Saudi $. Russia Meddling is a BS diversion. Demand investigation of Saudi meddling B4 they smirk &amp; burn his ass!
@SecPompeo Sir, you should advise Trump to get his shit together. Confront his adversaries with investigation! From Mueller to McCain, Brennan, Clinton - all ties to Saudi $. Russia Meddling is a BS diversion. Demand investigation of Saudi meddling B4 they smirk burning his ass!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Who gives a shit about permanently separating families? IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS FORCIBLY SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM PARENTS, DICTATE ABANDONMENT OF SPOUSES - ALL BASED UPON FEMINIST CONST. EXEMPTION DOCTRINE THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY EXIST. AMERICAN FAMILIES FIRST before whining!
@POTUS Sir, you'd better get your shit together. Figure out your adversaries! From Mueller to McCain, Brennan, Clinton - all ties to Saudi $. Russia Meddling is a BS diversion. Demand investigation of Saudi meddling &amp; ties or these people will smirk as they burn UR ass for power!
@WhiteHouse Sir, you had better get your shit together. Figure out your adversaries! From Mueller to McCain, Brennan, Clinton - all ties to Saudi $. Russia Meddling is a BS diversion. Demand investigation of Saudi meddling &amp; ties or they will smirk as they burn UR ass for power!

@TeamPelosi I'm a naturally born Democrat &amp; what it looks like to me is deep state elitists who reap Saudi $ with all kinds of $ ties diverting their attention from themselves using Russia &amp; Trump, so Saudis are confronted for attacking on 09/11. Islam is political-state religion - treason
@SenMikeLee @RandPaul There are too many God damn laws created against American rights, based on some kind of right to using a Const. Exemption Doctrine that doesn't exist creating "politically correct" laws enslaving Americans. And, people are getting fed up with elitist deep state lawyers doing do.
@rosemcgowan There is too much #metoo drama when the mentality of femininity attacks masculinity crying "wolf" to bring attention to themselves over the severity of an allegation. In street talk it's called, "talking shit" about someone.
@SecPompeo How about helping Americans denied by IMBRA &amp; related laws to not be discriminated against &amp; afforded their international rights to sponsor their wives rather than be forced to separated families and children? AMERICANS FIRST - MIGRANTS SECOND!
@realDonaldTrump Totally  agree. America must remove itself for "religious-political" Islamic wars. The government must separate religion from politics and war. We can not take sides. When tyranny is at hand based on religion. The people either suffer or rebel. That's life &amp; we can't be involved
@GMA I'm from Washington State and when a teenager - both myself and friends jumped into rivers from bridges. And, you bet, my friends pushed friends off of bridges. Yes, it was fun and yes, being stupid teenagers there was absolutely no ill intent. They should let the girl pusher go
@hrw @Google @facebook It osn't the USA business to dictate to other nations about human rights, when we, the USA run by deep state elitist lawyers creating laws that are enslaving our own people by removing the most basic rights. Imprisoning more &amp; with worse human rights abuses than any nation! WTF
@hiattf @PostOpinions Adm. is a moron &amp; yes, his clearance should be revoked too. Why? Brennan swore allegiance to a Sunni Wahhabi Sect Imam &amp; Ummah Islam (nation of Islam) while CIA Dir. Citizenship is called "brotherhood". Islam is a political-religious ideology. 2nd. he's NON-Elected like Adm. BAD
@MaryEngleheart @HelpRefugees @GlblCtznUK @yasminkadimusic @AsylumAid @Scroobiuspipyo @Harryslaststand @migrantsorg @DawnOPorter @refugeecouncil @HelenPankhurst He should put a little "joke" on the sign to overcome discrimination against Muslims - ie: Promise not to use rockets to blow cities up!? lol
@SecPompeo @POTUS USA reminisces for the old Iran. Shiite or Sunni? The Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam is more dangerous to USA.  Our Christian value nation not to take sides with political-Islamic ideology   correct. Need to stay out of Islam politics. 09/11 wasn't Shiite &amp; worse Iran was. Nuke 'em
@Kahunanc @Jilltay72785426 @Dasani_01 @realDonaldTrump I beg to differ with you totally! Political-Islam must be confronted! I have read the Qur'an and edited the "Mind of Mohammad" &amp; quite versed on Islam. Your kafir beliefs couldn't exist in an Islamic nation. Reciprocality! Case law paid by Saudi $ to US politicians? Bullsh*T 2 U
@Rojavian She should look to the UN Refugee Board to be deflected to Canada! That is a legal international right.
@Rojavian It's great to know that Germany has vetted their refugees so well. Now that we Americans know how well, we should ban ALL GERMANS from the USA as potential terrorists? Wake up Germany. One of  Merkel's boyfriends?
@DarthHendrick @IamStevenT @TODAYshow That's no biggy thing - The guy was quite presumptuous. Don't blame Tyler for nothing...blocking his way...
@JohnBrennan You are wrong Mr. Brennan. Every NON-ELECTED government employee is directed to NOT be involved in politics. You breached that directive. And, while CIA Dir. you took an oath of allegiance to a Sunni Wahhabi imam &amp; (nation of) Ummah Islam. Your citizenship is called brotherhood.
@kaitlancollins President is correct in removing Brennan's Security Clearance. Why? He took an oath of allegiance to a Sunni Wahhabi sect Imam &amp; Nation of Islam while a CIA Director. Citizenship is called brotherhood in political Islam. Non-elected officials are banned from politics. Breach!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Your comment Madam is outrageous! Brennan swore and oath of allegiance to a Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam &amp; the Nation of Islam. Citizenship is called Brotherhood in political-Islam. All done while a US government official CIA. Then, attacks the US President. Bullsh*t to you.
@StephenKing Im sure there are times when every American man has called yheir wives worse and visa versa. Its called being a human being. Is that short for bitch?
@realDonaldTrump We elected YOU to stop the blowing of smoke in the people's faces. $5 bil to Afghanistan to fight who when Bin Laden was a Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect Muslim? Pull our troops home &amp; turn our military on the real culprit! Saudi Arabia!
@ChattyEmu @KarenMonahan01 @keithellison What an unusual response to your ex's allegations! Why didn't you say, "Girl, you're standing on your head? or You're crazier than a hoot owl?" You don't deny anything but rather state there is no evidence confidently as if you yourself destroyed the evidence! Islamic response?
@10DowningStreet @theresa_may How many times in the thousands of years of British history have atrocities like this happen until once you allow Muslims to settle in your nation? Zero? Then why do you whine when these atrocities happen. Ban them or deport them back their allegiance for Islamic nations is.
@ABillionSuns You remind me of the dingleberries that my platoon leader told us about that really exist in every society.
@ABillionSuns @wombat_punch Who is the racist? I'm not a racist but I know when Saudi $ buys into mainstream media and politicians while cloaking itself as a minority to create political violence versus actual founded racism. You check the journalists financial background. Seriously - only 1 person 1 can =?
@ABillionSuns I can tell you're well educated on the aspects of public forums and free speech where one can freely express opinions to be educated or educated. But, are you aware of libel per se and civil penalties for your comments as noted above? I will screenshot it for my lawyer. Good day
@heartrocksrock @petestrzok Read your government manuals when being hired NON-ELECTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS are prevented from being partisan period. It's part of the job &amp; if you don't agree your subject to being terminated on the spot. I went through the same shit. Couldn't stand some of Reagan's polices.
@KimDotcom There is much veracity as to what you are saying. The world is not going to sustain a $20 trillion plus debt of a nation (USA) that is using their $ as a weapon against them. So sad! And, yea, I'm American.
@realDonaldTrump No need to "bad mouth" her. Voice stress analysis indicated you were truthful about you not knowing Kelly fired her. She hurt your pride because she breached your trust. Understandable - But, what's Kelly's situation? He's the one you need to watch.
@heartrocksrock @petestrzok I understand what you are saying &amp; that's BIG PROBLEM in today's government - Code of Ethics is disregarded by many non-elected officials - believing they have all of this politically correct power. THEY DON'T &amp; are accountable or subject fired. Keep your mouth shut on politics.
@DrJohnMerry1 Wow, what a wonderful help &amp; blessing you provide sir. I'm a vet, in need of a left hip &amp; degenerative bone disease in 6 discs. Can't get the Manila VA to do nothing yet they send Guam VA to Philippines for operations but not vets in Philippines. That's bullshit.
@KarenPierceUN I'm American Madam, &amp; I don't buy your allegations regarding the Russian Federation. It might be a private Russian or some UK or USA older spy, but definitely not Putin. Why? Old methods of assassination are methods of an old man when new methods are easier &amp; avail
@petestrzok Why are you deeply saddened? I'm a former government employee &amp; everyone who is in a non-elected government position is required to maintain total neutrality regarding politics. WTF man, the problem isn't that your anti-trump but rather you violated your oath by being partisan.
@EllisonCampaign @keithellison I don't know Keith - it may be alright to beat your wife or girlfriend once a month in the Qur'an, but you might be in deep shit here in the USA, regardless if its true or not - you're convicted on her word and the allegation in the media #metoo girlfriend. so sad too bad.
@ABillionSuns give me a break! Some journalist needing a story buys a can of soda, some tape, yellow paper, and a black marker, then writes some stupid ass shit on it - and the whole world is racist. It's only one can - one guy and one marker! Talk about 9 point 9 on the crock o' shit a meter
@GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec Happy Birthday girl! You're doing a fine job!
@realDonaldTrump A voice stress analysis of her tape where you said you didn't know about her termination indicates you were truthful. This tweet shows your hurt. But, what's with Kelly? Hell hath no greater fury than the wraith of a woman scorned. Pull in his reigns.
@NydiaVelazquez What I see is the Democratic Hierarchy &amp; money that is controlled by Muslims cloaking themselves as a minority - are playing these people like a fiddle to propagate political violence. If they don't stop it - civil war is coming &amp; they will lose.
@StumpforTrump @Don_Vito_08 unfortunately, i understand where the woman is coming from - but from the perspective of doing shit like that in the Presidential Situation Room - the girl may very well - and most probably should - be arrested.
@M2Madness @eavesdropann they're all just talking shit - anyone can figure that out -
@Fleur12309 @MMFlint What a reply! I did just the opposite after learning muslims took over demo party heiarchy &amp;$ while propagating political violence I changed to Republican.
@ananavarro @Rothna_Begum they aren't as bad as those anti-Trump politicians who if you were to investigate - all of them have Saudi $ ties from McCain, Clintons, Brennan and the list goes on. Not to mention Saudi $ buying in to MSM - treasonable alliances using Russia as a diversion.
@SpillerOfTea @Rothna_Begum Great job! Keep and maintain your beliefs and standards. Freedom of thought and speech should not be quashed to accommodate an ideology that maintains zero tolerance of others.
@RealKyleMorris @SandraTXAS They need to put that boy in the United States Marines!
@cafreeland You shouldn't be alarmed at all. In fact, this kind of conduct from an Islamic nation can not only be expected but this is the reality of their ideology. Maybe that  family should have stayed in Canada where they would have been safe.
@RealAlexRubi These mainstream media expressions of "white nationalists" referencing the average American's role in politics is pure "bullsh*t" Islamic propaganda generated from the Demo Party's Islamic hierarchy who now control the $ strings manipulating the real minorities. dumb shits.
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends I don't know about everyone's paycheck going up, but I can tell you the VA uses every single excuse on making my pension to go down, down, and more down to the point of receiving only a little over 600 a month in December. So?
@realDonaldTrump The President is required to liquidate any government entity that has lost the faith &amp; embarrasses the USA. The FBI &amp; DOJ have done just that. Liquidate the departments and rebuild them from scratch. Send all of the employees from both departments on secret mission to Greenland.
@AdamHBeasley So, where did these protests begin? Take heed fellow Black Americans from being manipulated by Islamists who control the Demo Party hierarchy, MSM, &amp; many American politicians. Islam "cloaks" itself as a minority propagating political violence using non-informed for dirty work!
@FischerNBC6 @nbc6 @NBC6Sports So, where did these protests begin? Take heed fellow Black Americans from being manipulated by Islamists who control the Demo Party hierarchy, MSM, &amp; many American politicians. Islam "cloaks" itself as a minority propagating political violence using non-informed for dirty work!
@LesBowen So, where did these protests begin? Take heed fellow Black Americans from being manipulated by Islamists who control the Demo Party hierarchy, MSM, &amp; many American politicians. Islam "cloaks" itself as a minority propagating political violence using non-informed for dirty work!
@ZBerm So, where did these protests begin? Take heed fellow Black Americans from being manipulated by Islamists who control the Demo Party hierarchy, MSM, &amp; many American politicians. Islam "cloaks" itself as a minority propagating political violence using non-informed for dirty work!
@Kaepernick7 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 @footcandles So, where did these protests begin?

Islam "cloaks" itself as a minority propagating political violence using non-informed for dirty work!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS @WhiteHouse Sir, have you read this article? https://t.co/98lOStkT8Y - Your adversaries continually compel you to hate Russia as a diversion of Saudi Arabia infiltration &amp; meddlings in US affairs - must be confronted by YOU! Do it B4 they do U.
@MMFlint Democratic voters are leaving the Demo Party in droves considering the Islamic infiltration into the hierarchy of the party propagating political violence. Russia is just a diversion to Saudi/Islamic funding MSM, Demo Party &amp; Politicians. That's the real threat!
@media_ksa @Infographic_ksa Political Islam must recognize that if their "religious-political" ideology is to be assured equal protection under Christian value nations, they must accept reciprocal rights to be afforded, less they lose their rights in other nations who may become non-tolerant of Islam.
@SirPatStew @cbsallaccess @shervinfoto @StarTrek Congratulations Patrick!
@BrandonLewis @AlistairBurtUK @BorisJohnson BTW, how many Islamic nations accommodate Christians? Alistair Burk is on the Saudi payroll to appease these immigration jihadists. Tell them to go back to Muhammad's lands if they want to wear them. The Crusades already settled this problem!
@BrandonLewis @AlistairBurtUK @BorisJohnson I disagree with your assessment. Muslims supposedly come to Great Britain starting a new life in GB they considered far more attractive then what they left. Their natural objective would be to assimilate and adapt, not demand accommodations. Burka are evil looking &amp; Go back home
@realDonaldTrump Excellent happenings! The Democratic Party is going to self-destruct as so many voters find the Islamic infiltration pulling the purse strings of political violence while cloaking themselves as a minority.  Former voters for the Democratic party find this repugnant -free society
@CanadaFP Canada can seize Saudi assets in our mainstream media outlets that they are buying into to propagate Saudi political rhetoric that hides their human rights abuses from the Canadian public in retaliation.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS @VP TAKE HEED! Asian nations customs - require saving face - for North Korea to continue complying - give them a carrot - drop some sanction so they save face. It can be simple - but for agreement to work - You got to give them something!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo  Sanctions are going to fail sir. Not because they aren't justified, USA is attack with too many sanctions and tariff wars causing confusion &amp; undermining the veracity of the USA - People see our conduct as bullying &amp; world domination. Retreat a little
@VP These sanctions are going to fail sir. Not because they aren't justified, USA is attack with too many sanctions and tariff wars causing confusion &amp; undermining the veracity of the USA - People see our conduct as bullying &amp; world domination. Its time to retreat a little.
@US_Secy_State The European Union is going to screw you royally with respect to the Russian Federation &amp; Iran. Russia isn't the threat to USA - Saudi Arabia is. Iran is more moderate than Saudi Arabia - I understand - all Islamic nations are creepy - But to the EU &amp; Russia - Saudis are creepier
@WhiteHouse @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump The European Union is going to stab you right in the back - because the Russian threat is a FAKE - they're playing both ends against the middle (USA) - get rid of NATO &amp; let Europe defend themselves. Russia isn't the threat - SAUDI interference  is!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Your intentions are correct about - free world trade &amp; no tariffs. I don't think China &amp; others understand you're offering equal trade &amp; no tariffs. Too much attacking nations economically w/o your explanation could be devastating for USA. backfires.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I beg to differ with you about Pres. Trump. I see a conspiracy regarding foreign interference in our elections - It comes from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz was degrading Trump? My research indicates Brennan, McCain, Bushs, Clintons, MSM all Saudi $ ties.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, look at Saudi financing into our MSM. Their commentaries are attempting to think for the American people instead of reporting the news. my investigation shows almost every instance of Saudi $ ties to our government anti-Trump agitators. Screw Saudi $ - Investigate meddling
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo @VP @POTUS Where are OUR hypersonic rockets being tested from our jets versus Russians? See: https://t.co/KriwwLRIbK - Rumsfeld stated $2.3 trillion missing from military budget. Lots of $ but Americans aren't getting the bang for the $. BS
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecPompeo  what do you think of this video? Very disturbing information, yet the information is credible.	https://t.co/knPyo6FR5U
@docmowat @senjudiciary @SenSchumer You're in error. Jefferson was 1 of the few Deists. There wasnt knowledge of the Qur'an or Islam. Muslims were called Barbary pirates. Jefferson said he maintained stronger Christian values than Christians w/ respect to gov. Individual thought to interpret God based on Holy Bible
@SenJohnMcCain The people are repeatedly warned that you receive $1 million dollars a year from Saudi sources, which undermines the ability to be partial in anything to do with American politics.
@USAGSessions Sir, if you don't get rid of Mueller knowing the bastard is tied to Saudi $ like the rest of the Trump haters. Then we will ask President Trump to let you go - because only a deep state elitist would put Islam above America. Is that you????
@realDonaldTrump The Demos tied to Saudi $ are claiming that your challenging the independence of the special counsel. Mueller should be strung up with Bushs, Clintons &amp; Brennan for treason those sons of bi*ches are bed with Saudi $ meddling in USA politics &amp; MsM. Mueller is in there too!
@realDonaldTrump All of your witch hunters all have financial ties to Saudi Arabia - so if you are looking at the culprits to running the funding for the Demo Party or Brennan, McCain, Clintons - all tied to Saudi Arabia - GO AFTER AL WALEED BIN TALAH  YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC BIG MOUTH smiling enemy
@docmowat @senjudiciary @SenSchumer The interpretation of separation &amp; state has long deviated from our Forefather's thoughts. God was written in as an entity of our Government. Christian values our foundation. USA allows all people to individual belief in the entity God - from the Holy Bible. Qur'an was never read
@rolandofletes97 @VP There is a difference between "thinking like the people" &amp; telling people how to think. Indeed many Americans let MSM think for them without researching anything out. Remember Walter Cronkite days? Too much commentary telling us stupid ass opinions that are stupid propaganda.
@TorontoRefugees @The519 @McCarthy_ca @RefugeeHub @ProBonoOntario Great work!
@rolandofletes97 @VP This is not what the Miskitu government in exile says.
@CorbieCrow @realDonaldTrump Manafort being persecuted by Mr. Mueller who is one of the Wahhabi Mafia. From John Brennan, McCain, the Clintons, Bushs, Keith Ellison, &amp; list goes on with Trump-Haters - they all have factual ties to Saudi $ &amp; Saudi meddling into our MSM and political system. TREASON!
@rolandofletes97 @VP the Miskitu people think otherwise. They were forcibly annexed in 1894. Since that time every single hereditary leader of the royal family has been forcibly sent into exile under threats of death or their children held hostage until they leave.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @VP @SecPompeo @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Mr. President, you must TERMINATE Robert Mueller from his position. This scoundrel is tied to Saudi $ like Brennan, Clintons, Bushs, &amp; McCain. He's evil &amp; toxic to America! Saudis are meddling in our Gov.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo @VP Sir, Mueller has ties to Saudi Arabia just like Brennan, McCain, the Clintons - you must start an investigation on Saudi financing our politicians because those politicians want your ass out of office. They're committing treason
@VP The United States needs to support the Miskitu Coast in their endeavors to break free of Nicaragua and restore their kingdom. They have a lawsuit in the US 9th Circuit pending claiming genocide.
@thehill That religious protection bill was nothing more than a diversion for Christians while our government attempts to justify an ambassador to ISLAM. We need to get rid of every God damn politician linked to Saudi MONEY and charge them with TREASON.
@realDonaldTrump There are consequences when Americans LEGALLY cross our border &amp; marry an alien spouse. IMBRA &amp; related laws DICTATE families must be abandoned and children permanently separated from their parents. REPEAL IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS that deny Americans equal protection.
@stark61555 Here is another British mainstream media complaining that Imams who are marrying underage girls is epidemic. But, NOT A WORD in the USA. Why? Because our law enforcement are too chickenshit to go undercover in mosques to find out. https://t.co/JsIB85FKza
@stark61555 Here is one article about imam in Great Britain &amp; Europe marrying child brides. Isn't it strange, NOT ONE SINGLE STORY OR INVESTIGATION IN THE USA. There has to be a cover-up. https://t.co/HsQdmp6Dta
@realDonaldTrump Request AG Sessions to appoint a SECOND special investigator to do just that. And, fire Mueller - all of your anti-Trump adversaries have TIES TO SAUDI ARABIA - GET THAT INTO YOUR SKULL SIR.
@DeptVetAffairs Are you aware that there are 1000's of VETS in the Philippines that cant see a doctor at the VA Manila hospital let alone be operated on? Scandalous &amp; torture of our old age veterans. Guam vets are sent to Philippines for operations but vets in Philippines suffer
@VetAffairsDems There are thousands of VETS in the Philippines who can't so much as see a doctor at the VA Manila hospital let alone be operated on? Scandalous &amp; torture of our old age veterans. Guam vets are sent to Philippines for operations but vets in Philippines suffer!

@SVACDems @SenatorTester @SenDanSullivan @SenatorTomUdall @DeptVetAffairs Bullshi*t on your claims to protect vets! Honorably Discharged American VETS are being DENIED to sponsor their alien spouses &amp; American children forcing them into EXILE versus forced family destruction, abandonment &amp; family separation. OUTRAGEOUS - I'm one of them!

@SVACDems WE need immigration reform that DOESN'T DESTROY FAMILIES. IF there's an AMERICAN CHILD - give illegal parents until they're 18 then BOOTED OUT NO EXCEPTIONS. STOP VETTING &amp; denying Americans from sponsoring WIVES &amp; HUSBANDS SEPARATING THE KIDS.-VET ALIEN SPOUSES!

@realDonaldTrump Question sir! How did President Obama come up with $150 billion to give Iran &amp; you can't come up with $20 billion for a wall? Is that wall to keep Mexicans out or Americans in? Why didn't we just ban the terrorist Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Sect Muslims?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, I am one of your BOYS - so to speak - I listen to your words on Immigration &amp; sir you are talking bullshit - Billions of dollars wasted on immigration &amp; NOT ONCE do you talk about BANNING the Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam from our shores.. SHAME ON YOU their NOT Mexicans
@SecPompeo Make sure you tell the Islamic-Political ideology this - because if you go Bible thumping in a Muslim country - you will be saying your prayers in heaven &amp; not on this Earth. They have zero-tolerance of Christians &amp; others. Don't forget that is their religion - research it out.
@SecPompeo @VP Sir, with all due respect, All of the anti-Trump conspirators and MSM have Saudi Arabian financial ties - from Brennan, Mueller, McCain, Pelosi - and the list goes on. START A GOD DAMN INVESTIGATION BEFORE THESE ASSHOLE FRAME HIM! Check it out, I did. Saudi is common denominator
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, All of your anti-Trump conspirators and MSM have Saudi Arabian financial ties - from Brennan, Mueller, McCain, Pelosi - and the list goes on. START A GOD DAMN INVESTIGATION BEFORE THESE ASSHOLE FRAME YOU! Check it out, I did - Saudi common denominator
@PAAttorneyGen Targeting one religion may suggest your inquiry is suspect. Why aren't you investigating the imam's of the political-religion of Islam. In GB they have found imam's secretly marrying underage girls. Don't be a chickensh*t &amp; go after them too!
@realDonaldTrump @potus President Trump, you irritate me by not ordering an investigation of anti-Trump conspirators - Every God damn one of them including Mueller, Brannen, McCain, Pelosi, &amp; MSM have Saudi $ ties. Investigate &amp; arrest them for treason before you're framed	https://t.co/KuYc15MGa4
@ABCPolitics As a  American citizen and reviewing the MSM  it's Walter Cronkite days for sure. CNN adds too many bias opinions to the news instead of just reporting the event. In fact, their articles are contaminating the news with toxic opinions telling me what to think. I don't like that.
@PepperBaker70 @InstituteGC @NoraMulready @Independent Mr Blair you are in the Saudis $ pocket with Bush. How did Great Britain survive its gloriously history without the EU? You are talking bulls*it sir &amp; should be held on charges of treason. The EU is an easier future Islamic conquest. F-U
@RealSaavedra It is an "incident" to the Demo Party because the Islamic-Political ideology now controls the hierarchy and "purse strings" cloaking themselves as a "minority". This is why there is now political violence &amp; anti-Trump - clearly all ties with Saudi $ &amp; US politicians. Treasonable
@RepErikPaulsen So, you really represent Americans? What about overseas Americans being denied to sponsor their wives when they're married with children? Force separation of children &amp; abandonment of families overseas or EXILED. Fu(k the Immigants sir. ! Pissed off overseas American DAD in EXILE
@IanDunt Remember sir, Muslims take an oath of allegiance to their imam &amp; Ummah Islam (conceptual nation of islam). Their citizenship is called "brotherhood". They afford no allegiance to Great Britain except future conquest &amp; non-tolerance of Christians &amp; other kafir. US should ban Brits
@Harryslaststand Remember sir, Muslims take an oath of allegiance to their imam &amp; Ummah Islam (conceptual nation of islam). Their citizenship is called "brotherhood".

@GurbirGrewalNJ @nj1015 That is fine. But, in the United States there's freedom of speech. And, although those radio host's satire was in bad taste, it wasn't "hate speech". If you studied American history, this is a Christian value nation. Those who don't take the Biblical oath affirm Christian value!
@EveHawk @SenatorMenendez Putin may be crooked but Russia is a Christian value nation. Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia are Political-Islam a dangerous ideology that both killed Americans - US barracks in Iran &amp; 09/11/2001 Saudi Arabia whose $ goes to many of our politicians &amp; MSM. I would ally with the crooks!
@SecPompeo Excellent assessment. Considering all anti-Trump politicians have ties to Saudi $ &amp; considering regardless of Iran or Saudi Arabia Political-Islam is a dangerous ideology. It's better to ally ourselves with Christian value Russia. Crooked but not terrorists like 09/11/2001 Saudis
@GermanyDiplo @HeikoMaas @GRIPS_Japan Isnt that odd that two defeated enemies of the Western World now choose to restore a new alliance based on different principles.
@EveHawk @SenatorMenendez Be more precise Sen Menendez? I admire a man among men confronting concerns. That doesnt mean I agree, but rather admire for standing up &amp; expressing your concerns.
@EveHawk @SenatorMenendez I totally disagree! Putin explained that tax evasion $ led to Demo Party laundering $400 mil. Russia exposed truthful emails period from their investigation. Saudi Arabia is the real villian. But we have to deal with RF NK &amp; Iran to avoid a nuclear war that No one will win.
@SenatorCantwell What about Saudi Arabia filtering $millions through their lobbyists like the Podesta brothers? Ruusia was investigating 400 mil of their tax money laundered to tge Demo Party? R U covering aomething up? How much Saudi $ was filtered into your acct?
@SecPompeo Personally, regarding the Crimea, maps before 1917 don't show any Ukrainian access to the Black Sea. All was given to them with the stroke of a pen by the Communists. The people voted to be part of Russia - so be it. They're Russian Orthodox &amp; speakers.
@SecPompeo Mr. Secretary you did GREAT before Congress. Most of these scoundrels in government that are anti-Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia that needs to be investigated for meddlings in USA affairs. Council Mr. Trump to get off his ass &amp; do so before he's destroyed first. He's a good man.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS @WhiteHouse - I expect news to be informative, but not telling me what my mental thoughts are to be or my opinion. There is too much negative commentary from CNN to the point of sedition. BAN them from the @WhiteHouse Great idea! &amp; maybe more!
@EveHawk @SenatorMenendez I will add that in almost every instance, the anti-Trump hate is propagated by American politicians &amp; mainstream media with financial ties to Saudi Arabia. Russia is a diversion, Saudi Arabian meddling is a fact.
@EveHawk @SenatorMenendez Totally wrong! Years ago, Iran made a major mistake killing US soldiers under Carter. Sadly that carries on in today's politics. I'm not comfortable with threatening anyone. Saudi Arabia Sunni Wahhabi sect attacked the USA on 09/11 &amp; is a political-religious ideology &amp; our enemy
@SecPompeo Stand your ground sir. With respect to some of those in Congress, stand your ground. They're talking bulls*it and sedition &amp; most probably receiving secret Saudi financing because it seems every politician from Brannon to McCain has ties to Saudi $.
@SenatorMenendez Sir, with all due respect, you're talking bullsh*t about Sec. Pompeo &amp; President Trump. Are you receiving Saudi funds for your campaign or under the table?
@MayorJenny @TIME @SenWarren You're a disgrace to the City of Seattle, the State of Washington &amp; as an American. To degrade an American President while holding office is sedition.
@TuckerCarlson Immunity? To conceal that he launders Saudi "meddling" money to our government politicians? This guy is involved in a treasonable alliance with the Saudis. John Brennan and John McCain need investigation - start one!
@katharinemcphee Why don't you tell the "haters" that there is an adult age where people chose whomever to marry with their own consent. Do these "haters" put food on the table, pay medical bills etc. or old jealous women pissed because an older man chose a younger woman? Screw them all!
@BlissTabitha Islam is a political-religious ideology requiring allegiance to their imam (who is like a priest) and the Ummah Islam (conceptual nation of Islam). Their citizenship is called "brotherhood". You should inform your Minister for Immigration that the Danish government must confront!
@HouseJudiciary @HouseGOP @RepDaveBrat @RepAnnWagner @RepGoodlatte @RepMimiWalters @RepMarthaRoby Fine! Great! BUT, what about REPEALING IMBRA &amp; related laws that force Overseas Americans to abandon spouses &amp; permanently separate children from their families? Fu*k the Immigrants! Americans First - Now repeals discriminatory laws against our own People! 1 ANGRY OVERSEAS DAD!
@HouseJudiciary @HouseGOP @RepDaveBrat @RepAnnWagner @RepGoodlatte @RepMimiWalters @RepMarthaRoby Why is Trump worried about Russia meddling? Putin stated $400K tax $ was laundered to Demo Party.

@POTUS Why are you worried about Russian meddling? Putin said, $400K of Russian tax money laundered to Demo Party. They investigated &amp; released undoctored &amp; exact emails as truth. Our government does the same thing home &amp; abroad. How about investigating the Saudis financing US?
@POTUS Human beings have the right to leave or return to their home countries. This is international basic human right. USA laws reduces a human being to slave without the right to say no and leave from wherever they are or bring family home. Do you lose that right for UR self?
@realDonaldTrump Total Bullsh*t sir. Putin explained there was no meddling. Tax Fraud in Russia led to $400K laundered to Demo Party. In Russian investigation they released emails un-doctored &amp; truthful. The exact same thing we do in USA. Now what the Saudis' meddling &amp; paying off US politicians?
@AganonKris Human beings have the right to leave or return to home countries. This is an international basic human right. Your proposal reduces a human being to slave without the right to say no and leave from wherever they are. Would you care to lose that right for yourself?

@NancyPelosi @RepEliotEngel @RepAdamSmith @RepAdamSchiff Sorry lady - but under the Democrats they have put some really sleazy ass people in positions that have compromised both American values and the United States. They aren't working for the government - great - they don't need any security clearance. That simple.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent assessment.
@esaagar @TuckerCarlson All of those so called "people" have ties to Saudi $ &amp; the Saudi Royal family. You can start with John Brennan - the CIA Director who swore allegiance to his imam &amp; the Ummah Islam (nation of Islam) - trust the basta*ds? Hang them out to dry &amp; charge them with treason! The wolves
@TuckerCarlson The Podesta brothers have been laundering Saudi money &amp; to give these scoundrels "Immunity"? Whoa to the American public! These sons of bit#ches should be arrested &amp; charged with TREASON against the United States of America!
@realDonaldTrump Great work on illegal immigrants but WHAT ABOUT AMERICANS OVERSEAS FORCED INTO EXILE UNDER IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS depriving families from unification FORCED SEPARATION OF CHILDREN solely on the basis of an AMERICAN SPOUSE? outrage!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @POTUS @WhiteHouse SHOCKING - Canadian terrorist from Iran became German national moved with visa to Canada &amp; killed people! Exactly what President Trump was fearful of European Muslims unvetted coming to America for terrorist acts! Shameful disbelief!
@NancyPelosi Excellent idea. Considering that John Brennan used to belong to the communist party. Then, as CIA director took an oath of allegiance to his imam and Ummah Islam (nation of Islam) a political-religion while representing the USA. Outrageous!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, please don't flaunt our power with consequences. Iran is aware of our power as well as their capabilities during a confrontation. If they are foolish to try something. Let them find out for themselves.
@SecPompeo It is my opinion that President Trump &amp; yourself - might not suggest a military confrontation with Iran. Oh we are stronger one on one - but never underestimate a desperate enemy &amp; what they can do. If there is a confrontation - just do it - &amp; don't talk about it.
@Balenciaga90 @phinathome @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump All I know is that anyone trusting an Islamic nation is beyond being a misguided moron. Theyre idiots in the 1st degree
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What about you, the Demo Party in a treasonable alliance with saudi Arabia &amp; other Muslims financing politics? And 400 mil of Russian taxes being diverted to DP? Shame on you Pelosi. Youre a traitor to USA

@realDonaldTrump Actually sir, I agree with the DP on ICE. &amp; add CIA &amp; FBI to the list. For 200 years we never needed ICE &amp; USA was Great. These deep state elitist non-elected government creations &amp; laws like IMBRA are fu*king citizens more than illegal aliens. start over with more control..
@realDonaldTrump Pull out of NATO &amp; tell them to defend themselves. Turkey buys S-400's &amp; Germany buys gas &amp; oil. Russia is making a fortune, Turkey &amp; Germany stabbing USA before our very eyes &amp; you don't do shit? Are you a "chicken shit" to tell them to go fu*k themselves?
@realDonaldTrump Please NOTE - every single one of them including MSM has ties to Saudi Arabia. Take that asshole nation off the best friend list &amp; put on the glass parking lot agenda by threatening to obliterate Mecca &amp; Medina - for an attitude adjustment.
@realDonaldTrump The EU is like a woman. They love you when they get your money, but when there is no money - there is no Honey. Fuck them! Dissolve NATO &amp; watch Great Britain on their knees begging you to open the USA door.
@realDonaldTrump BIG ERROR with NK. To prevail THINK ASIAN! Give NK something - not much but something economically to save face. Then everything will fall into place the way you want it. They don't think the way we do. But they want peace, unification &amp; no nukes. Make it happen! Good luck!
@realDonaldTrump That's right sir. The EU expects us to defend them via NATO with a FAKE adversary (Russia) them gives them our business by paying them billions of $. Let them defend themselves against the Russian GHOST. DROP OUT OF NATO or they buy USA.
@realDonaldTrump Kick their asses Sir! Do what you gotta do to make it fair &amp; equal to USA business &amp; people.
@realDonaldTrump Sir you're 1000% correct. NO Tariffs or EQUAL tariffs just like our Forefathers wrote. Excellent job sir!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, Putin didn't lie about not meddling. He had criminal investigation of 400 mil Russian tax money diverted to Demo Party. They hacked DP &amp; revealed truthful information that the crime led too. Our FBI does the same shit. Turn over the people requested. LOL
@SecPompeo Come on Pompeo - Putin smiled &amp; stated they just stole true information &amp; disseminated it. They didn't try to manipulate our elections like the Saudis did - lol And, what did our USA do to the Soviet Union? We interfere all of the time... lol
@YouHadMeAtHowdy @PradRachael if they breached the code of ethics for non-elected officials of government - when I worked for the government - instant dismissal - back in the 70's - if the laws of employment are still on the books -Terminate them on the spot regardless of position.
@SenatorDurbin @SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez @brianschatz Why should you object? Our former Ambassador - to be honest was a complete asshole - and he still is. Fuck 'em - let him be interviewed. Being an American doesn't make him some sort of Jesus Christ - he's a deep state elitist - who needs to go!
@SenatorDurbin Senator - you're just talking like a man standing on his head.  What the hell do you want Trump to do? Engage in a nuclear war with the Russian Federation? BTW where are the American public bomb shelters? No one does shit to defend citizens do they? Russia definitely protects.
@PradRachael The woman should be hung! All government non-elected officials are warned to remain neutral and non-political or be terminated. She violated the ultimate sin.
@dreamerhnl @bostonnewslocal What do wee expect with the rhetoric coming from our Democratic Party who would prefer to nuke the Russian Federation than maintain peaceful co-existence or some form ot peace with them.
@NancyPelosi @AjitPaiFCC @realDonaldTrump Well, for the first time we have one issue in common.  I believe in a FREE internet. We always know that our government is trolling the web snooping, but that doesn't mean they have the right to control it.
@phinathome @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You're correct and just what is Soros' connection to these other scoundrels?
@realDonaldTrump Sir, the Saudis &amp; deep state elitists financed by them &amp; MSM bought into are responsible for political violence and attack on your integrity.  Wake up call sir! Start investigation!
@lisamurkowski The government might have asked Agape Food Bank in Othello Washington to help with a couple of tons of food.
@SenatorShaheen @POTUS Give me a break! Who the fu*k are you to degrade our President by such remarks? Are you some kind of  deep state elitist feeling that there's some kind of Constitutional Exemption Doctrine" for every claim to being "politically correct"? Are you on the Saudi payroll like McCain?
@RobertFife @althiaraj @realDonaldTrump Not really frightening considering the deep state elitists, MSM, Saudi funded politicians all want Trump to Nuke the Russian Federation, China etc. instead of propagating peaceful coexistence so we can all survive.
@SamSanderson123 @McFaul @PressSec Give the Russians McFaul to be deposed. He is a deep state elitist who cries wolf about treason similar to McCain on the Saudi payroll or Brennan who swore allegiance to the Ummah Islam as our CIA director. Handcuff McFaul &amp; hand him over to explain his treasonous roll.
@GibbKathy @McFaul McFaul has been making rash statements bringing attention to himself - after he lost diplomatic immunity. His status doesn't make his poop talk a rib-eye steak for everyone to consume without confrontation. Let him be deposed.
@jcrsaltman @McFaul I'm not so sure about your natural conclusions about US &amp; Russia. Let them have their testimonial from this deep state elitist. We all poop in the same pot - no reason to think this guy is immune from being as asshole any less than someone else.
@McFaul You aren't being prosecuted by the Russians, &amp; if they are so crazy then your testimonial before them shouldn't matter to you. Many times the US requests the same respect from Russia. Personally as an American I think you're kind of cheesy but that doesn't make you guilty.
@AlexPappas Infiltrated Demo Party. Its okay to deceive &amp; take from infidels. Pleads NOT GUILTY because its his religious beliefs. LOL
@AlexPappas I read your report about the Russian woman &amp; the government story doesn't add up? Convoluted on 1 big issue. Why is she packing to return to Russia after screwing single American men? Mission accomplished? I see bullshit being disseminated.
@newtgingrich Sir, yes, Trump should stand by Americans first. But our FBI deep state elitists &amp; CIA John Brannen who took an oath &amp; allegiance to his Imam &amp; Ummah Islam exercising his Islamic citizenship (brotherhood) while a CIA director has horribly compromised USA intelligence.
@avale01 @SecPompeo I don't know lady. The man took that extra step called "trying". One step more than any President before him. Maybe you want him to nuke NK &amp; Russia so  our USA is mutually obliterated? Think deeply on anti-Trump rhetoric. Its called treason when its violent speech.
@SenJohnMcCain Just like you do to the Saudis, right?
@SenatorMenendez Are U Fu*king serious? Russia is a diversion of Saudi infiltration of our politicians, MSM, heiarchy of Demo Party, Bush, McCain etc. Investigate these traitors for treason B4 bitching about Trump.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo John Brennan while representing the USA swears allegiance to an Islamic Imam &amp; Ummah Islam (Nation of Islam) where his Islamic citizenship is called "Brotherhood" - &amp; has the audacity to suggest our President seeking peace is what?
@RepBonnie Are you fuC*ing serious? All of this hate-Trump campaign by MSM &amp; politicians have one other thing in common - ties to Saudi money &amp; Saudi infiltration into the uSA! From McCain, Brennan to CNN. Russia is the diversion. MY opinion as an American Democrat.
@MMFlint Are you fuC*ing serious? All of this hate-Trump campaign by MSM &amp; politicians have one other thing in common - ties to Saudi money &amp; Saudi infiltration into the uSA! From McCain, Brennan to CNN. Russia is the diversion. MY opinion as an American Democrat.
@BetteMidler Are you fuC*ing serious? All of this hate-Trump campaign by MSM &amp; politicians have one other thing in common - ties to Saudi money &amp; Saudi infiltration into the uSA! From McCain, Brennan to CNN. Russia is the diversion. MY opinion as an American Democrat.
@AC360 @andersoncooper @SenJohnMcCain Are you fucking serious? You need to stop telling Americans how to think &amp; restrict your news reporting to the news. We will make up our own minds. All of this hate-Trump campaign by MSM &amp; politicians have one other thing in common - ties to Saudi money! Russia is the diversion.
@JohnBrennan How dare you suggest President Trump is being un-American after learning you took allegiance and oath to the Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam &amp; the Ummah Islam (nation of Islam) where your "brotherhood" is your citizenship while running our CIA - you should be hung by your balls sir.
@McFaul From my perspective as an American Democrat is observing extensive Saudi Wahhabi sec infiltration into US MSM, government officials, military-industrial complex using the Russian Federation as a diversion. Sorry, but I am for President Trump on this one!
@TimOBrien @DavidCornDC From what I see as an American Democrat is extensive Saudi Wahhabi infiltration into our MSM, government officials, military industrial complex &amp; the Russian Federation is a diversion. More power to President Trump versus American traitors commiting treason via the media.
@jimsciutto @WalshFreedom From what I see as an American Democrat is Saudi Wahhabi infiltration into our MSM, government officials, military-industrial complex &amp; the Russian Federation is a diversion to their extensive infiltration. More Power to Mr. Trump!
@WalshFreedom @PlanetFitness So what?
@HouseGOP Be more explicit in identifying deep state elitists. In almost every instance from McCain, Brennan or CNN these culprits are tied to Saudi $. Remember the anger of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal? They have infiltrated DP &amp; US gov;Russia is a diversion from an investigation
@SenateGOP Be more explicit in identifying deep state elitists. In almost every instance from McCain, Brennan or CNN these culprits are tied to Saudi $. Remember the anger of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal? They have infiltrated DP &amp; US gov; Russia is a diversion from investigation
@StateDept @SecPompeo @POTUS @niinisto Sir, be more explicit in identifying deep state elitists. In almost every instance from McCain, Brennan or CNN these culprits are tied to Saudi $.

@mfa_russia Sir, you have to be more explicit in identifying the deep state elitists. In almost every instance your opponents in government, MSM, &amp; military industrial-complex are tied to Saudi Arabia $ from McCain, Brennan or CNN. Russia is their diversion. START INVESTIGATION NOW stop them
@POTUS Sir, you need to confront McCain for taking Saudi $1 million a year for his non-profit business, expose him being compromised - regardless of being a war veteran, terminally ill, or a senator, HE allowed treasonable Saudi infiltration into USA &amp; using Russia as diversion.
@SenJohnMcCain Sir, I don't know who you think you're bullshitting after taking Saudi $1 million a year for ur non-profit business - you're compromised - regardless of being a war veteran, terminally ill, or a senator - YOU allowed treasonable Saudi infiltration in USA &amp; Russia is a diversion.
@Schwarzenegger @realDonaldTrump WTF did you want Trump to do? Nuke him? Defend our FBI deep state elitist bullshitters? Or McCain or the Saudi payroll? Hitler was your hero as a youth. I read his book @ 16 &amp; thought he was a moron?  Trump did GREAT Arnold considering the assholes he has to represent.
@MaxTheDragon @RacismDog @RichardDawkins Confronting Islam is NOT racist. This ideology enslaves all colors of mankind. Discriminatory is more precise less confronting an extremist ideology more precisely identified as a cult. Also see Jim Jones defining cults.
@RichardDawkins Both soundings are nothing more than noise pollution. Jesus never had bells &amp; Mohammed never had loud speakers in their days. Let the public peacefully sleep to noon. Ban public noise from 5 pm until noon the next day under penalties of 6 months imprisonment.
@amber_red1 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK You talk total bullshit sir. Every single source of anti-Trump rhetoric comes from ties with the Saudi Arabians who have infiltrated our MSM, government, military-industrial complex &amp; have meddled in US affairs since the Bush days. Russia is their diversion to avoid investigation
@SecPompeo Sir, I honest believe that CNN should be designated as a "domestic enemy" of the United States. Their news does not need the negative &amp; destructive "commentaries" that they are forcing the the public who can make their own judgements on news.
@USAGSessions Sir, I honest believe that CNN should be designated as a "domestic enemy" of the United States. Their news does not need the negative &amp; destructive "commentaries" that they are forcing the the public who can make their own judgements on news.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Sir, I honest believe that CNN should be designated as a "domestic enemy" of the United States. Their news does not need the negative &amp; destructive "commentaries" that they are forcing the the public who can make their own judgements on news.
@angela_nastase Thank you. After teaching in Central America for 6 years - I noted a change in MSM reporting. There was no more Walter Cronkrite neutral reporting - always bias commentaries telling us how to think - it's extremely irritating &amp; unAmerican. I noted Saudi Arabia buying into MSM
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SecPompeo Do you remember the anger &amp; remarks of Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal? Ever single source of anti-Trump rhetoric from MSM to politicians like McCain &amp; Brennan are tied to Saudi Arabia infiltrating US gov. Start investigation NOW1
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK NBC is talking BullShit - Is Trump suppose to NUKE Russia? Does the world believe Mueller's probe? Every source attacking Trump has ties or $ ties to Saudi Arabia that has infiltrated MSM, our politicians, and military-industrial complex. TREASON that needs to be investigated
@WhiteHouse Sir - you be careful because the political violence secretly propagated through Saudi infiltration into US mainstream media &amp; Demo Party is getting seriously out of hand. It needs to be investigated &amp; those tied $ with Saudi Arabia removed from government before bad..
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson Mr. President - those who scream the loudest anti-Trump rhetoric of treason ALL have political &amp; definitely financial ties to SAUDI ARABIA from McCain to Kellison &amp; Demo Party deep state elitists. It's time to expose them for their treasonable alliance &amp; Russian diversion. Beware
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson Please sir - Advise Mainstream media to stop making slanderous &amp; treasonable commentaries - stick to reporting the news &amp; and allow us Americans - the public to interpret the importance of these international meetings for ourselves. I'm pissed &amp; Anderson should be fired.
@cnni @StCollinson CNN needs to stop making offensive &amp; treasonable commentaries - stick to reporting the news instead of propagating propaganda against the President of the USA. We Americans can formulate our own personal opinions without Mr. Anderson telling us how to think. I'm really pissed!
@cnnbrk what really pisses me off about CNN? Your commentaries telling us what to think when our officials are having international meetings. Report the God damn news &amp; let the people formulate our own opinions! Sorry but you should can Anderson.
@cnnbrk John Brennan is one of the most abhorrent CIA directors ever appointed - a born again Muslim convert who himself engaged in treason against the United States. He should be arrested and given a death sentence!
@cnnbrk BEWARE -Those who scream the loudest anti-Trump rhetoric of treason ALL have political &amp; definitely financial ties to SAUDI ARABIA from McCain to Kellison &amp; Demo Party deep state elitists. It's time to expose them for their treasonable alliance &amp; Russian diversion tactics

@StateDept @SecPompeo @POTUS @niinisto You &amp; President @realDonaldTrump Trump should be commended on the Helsinki meeting with Putin. Beware of people like @SenJohnMcCain , @NancyPelosi &amp; others including mainstream media - every God damn one of them have links to Saudi $ - the very instigators propagating violence.
@1Marchella Excellent point! And, another issue. The USA by our Constitution is BARRED from taking sides of religious wars. Islam is a political-religious ideology that we have no business taking sides in. Both sides are wrong &amp; we should NOT finance or ally ourselves with any sect of Islam
@Qwarktastic2 @tedlieu @PressSec You are wrong! If you read the purpose of the electoral college, where Bush was elected over Gore - (and I wanted Mr. Gore) there is a specific strategy to win an election by winning the national state electoral votes from the states. Clinton and Gore's strategy was wrong. Sorry!
@rent_hero @SenJohnMcCain @antonioguterres @washingtonpost I don't know but I got pretty damn well pissed off when my research discovered that the militant Rohingya jihadists had been attacking Burmese government offices - cross referencing dates show they were the provocateurs. These Muslims are not the peace loving people MSN portrays
@mermaidstale @bostonnewslocal @realDonaldTrump Your statistics are small potatoes compared to US officials, mainstream media &amp; industrial-military complex ties with Saudi Arabia infiltration of our nation &amp; paying, funding, lobbying, our nation diverting their meddling with the Russian. How much Saudi $ goes to McCain?
@Noneother_EO People should be demanding that Saudi Arabia be investigated for meddlings in USA government affairs and mainstream media. They buy our politicians, buy news outlets then place pro-Islamic journalists in our media. Russia is just a diversion to these treasonable acts and conduct
@keithboykin Our infamous deep state elitist justice system trashed themselves. As a former government official - ALL non-elected employees are instructed to remain neutral &amp; make no political statements or opinions versus immediately removal. You're propagating treasonous statements.
@keithboykin Give me a break from the bullshit! Cooper needs to stop his commentary rants and report the news. CNN receives too much Saudi $ from their meddlings in USA government &amp; mainstream media. Saudis are the meddlers &amp; control Demo Party hierarchy. Russia is the diversion.
@US_Secy_State Sir, I sent you a private message. You may already know what I've said is true &amp; a dangerous situation is at hand. But, if you don't - please take heed.
@spkerofthehouse Sir, all I see is "hype" political violent attacks that's sprang from a Demo Party now controlled by political Islam &amp; financed directly, indirectly, &amp; lobbied by Saudi Arabia infiltrating &amp; meddling in our government &amp; mainstream media with treasonable intent.
@SenateFloor All I see is "hype" political violent attacks that's sprang from a Demo Party now controlled by political Islam &amp; financed directly, indirectly, &amp; lobbied by Saudi Arabia infiltrating &amp; meddling in our government &amp; mainstream media with treasonable intent. Address it

@SenJohnMcCain Sir if People like you directly involved with the Saudi Arabian infiltration into our politics via direct &amp; indirect financing, as in your case don't stop attacking the President voices will  call for your and others treasonable arrests!
@the_edwin_mix @tedlieu @PressSec Are you talking about Bush &amp; Clinton's treasonable relationships with the Saudis infiltrating our gov mainstream media while putting Saudi $ in their pockets? Russia is a diversion to this infiltration.
@the_edwin_mix @tedlieu @PressSec I detest political correctness that affords idiots to create unconstitutional laws as if there were some exemption doctrine to afford them the treasonable right to circumvent the intent of Const. rights to benefit deep state elitist &amp; globalists &amp; NOT American citizens.
@HillaryClinton It's strange that you ask such a question of Trump when you allowed the Saudi Arabian  Sunni Wahhabi sect along with other sect of political Islam infiltrate the US government, military-industrial, mainstream media, colleges. How much Saudi $ did you get? Russia is a diversion.
@tedlieu @PressSec To add to my last tweet. I couldn't stomach Mr. Bush, didn't really care for Clinton &amp; loved Mr. Gore. But as an American once elected - I held my tongue and dealt with them, if you understand what I mean. Prepare to run for President if you don't like who does.
@tedlieu @PressSec Sir, it's time to stop whining. Whether American citizens like President Trump or not is fine in a nation where freedom of speech and thought is suppose to reign. But, the election is over. It's time we back America's choice as a nation of people under one flag and government.
@jules_su What a PC response. Laws establish an age of responsibility for becoming an adult in society. At that age, it is NO ONE'S business what kind of relationship an individual entertains. Words of Wisdom - Negative comments are not appropriate &amp; sometimes offensive
@SecPompeo Awesome, intense &amp; intricate work on behalf of our fallen soldiers from another era of world history. Congratulations sir. Great job!
@RespectableLaw I doubt there could be any case with respect to freedom of speech and thought here regarding Musk's opinion. Why? Well, the person he talks about is in another country requiring US law jurisdiction to consolidate their law to a foreign laws to establish a case. Not gonna happen!
@shelbygrad @IndieFocus WTF?
@michelleisawolf @ScottFeinberg @POTUS @CNN I don't think President Trump intentionally disrespected any of these people. First of all, he is correct on Britain exiting. May didn't want that to happen &amp; is watering down the exit - it won't work. That's the 1st time he met the Queen &amp; wasn't versed on protocol.
@Katiefr91856894 @SenatorCantwell Please read: Because my wife is dying of cancer &amp; as an American with two children, I can't bring her home with me so I filed for and received permanent residency here. Not a joke - in effect her laws are tantamount to 1st degree murder: https://t.co/Oevad8g4ve
@Katiefr91856894 @SenatorCantwell Cantrell sponsored Leyla Wilson-Muro &amp; an Eithopian woman using American men as a diversion to allow them sponsorship into the US under IMBRA is they complain against their violent jihadist husbands. Muro makes $12 mil a year off Cantrells bullshit
@Katiefr91856894 @SenatorCantwell Like I said - repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws. The government is BARRED under the 9th from making such laws reserved for the people. She can go screw herself - one of the men barred by her bullshit - from a Washington state pioneer family Issac Stevens was my great great uncle.
@Katiefr91856894 @SenatorCantwell Don't think so lady! Cantrell is a known homewrecker having an affair with married man. She sponsors IMBRA based on revenge &amp; a Muslim woman from outside the USA - interfering in friendship, fiance, &amp; marital rights to deny American men less rights overseas than they get at home
@SenatorCantwell repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws that are treason against our Constitutional rights to freedom of speech, association and marriage or resign your government position as a domestic enemy cloaked in the Democratic Party solely coming to Washington State financed by vitrolitic  Lesbians
@princeh81976229 I am in linkedin - it's a great website
@princeh81976229 I can see it in your children's eyes - they all sure love their Daddy! Congratulations!
@RepBonnie @realDonaldTrump Why doesn't the US government investigate Saudi Arabia funding directly &amp; indirectly our politicians, mainstream media, military industrial complex &amp; neutralized them after 09/11/2001? Saudis are the meddlers, Russia is the Diversion. The FBI deep state elitists are fu*king nuts
@Hollybowie This guy Strok is a deep state elitist psycho who should have been charged with treason against the United States and imprisoned. All non-elected federal employees are warned from the 1st day of employment of being required to stay out of politics and neutrality. Hang the bastard
@theresa_may You are totally foolish to align with the EU - which is doomed to becomes Islamic. Protect your nation first lady or lose America and its power to elevate Great Britain above the European Union. Make a clean break.
@DavidLammy @StevePeers I totally disagree with you! The Democratic Party was infiltrated by Muslims at the request of the AMA who now are in control the financial hierarchy of the Party while cloaking themselves as a minority. Now there is political violence - Islamic values rule. Trump is just a man.
@mburnell @senjudiciary @SenSchumer @RacismDog I'm not sure what your reply was but I can assure you if there is concern about Islam - that is not being racist - as Islam enslaves all colors of mankind - that's called discriminatory &amp; well founded fears of this ideology of terror.
@SenJohnMcCain You have the audacity to suggest "Russian meddling" while  collecting over $1 million from Saudi Arabia for your non-profit organization? Sir, they should should be investigating  YOU for a treasonable alliance and neutralized Saudi Arabia before the sunrise 09/12/2001 - Shame!
@realDonaldTrump Before Sent McCain complains about you asking the Ruskies about meddling why do you ask him about the $1 million dollars a year he receives from the Saudis who are the real meddlers. Russia is just a diversion.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, the Crimea was given to the Ukraine with a stroke of the pen by Communist leader Kruschev - Since Catherine the Great era, this territory is Russian, populated with Russians - there is no way you could have stopped Russia without war!
@SadiqKhan You're not American nor British. You swear your allegiance to your Imam &amp; Islam. You have no right to disrespect our President for confronting an ideology that threatens the United States or our form of government. Its called respect.. Know the power of the word called Peace.
@SadiqKhan - You're a horrible politician who has dishonored our President Trump, who stands as both a man among men speaking his mind on behalf of himself &amp; our nation! You should be compelled to apologize or face being banned from America forever! You a disgrace to mankind!
@Ohio_Buckeye_US @danielc2010 @gsteck74 @realDonaldTrump deep state elitists involved in treason against our Constitution - financed by Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam directly and indirectly along with mainstream media, military industrial complex and our officials - simple as that. Russia is a diversion
@donaldrusso994 @danielc2010 What you're seeing in the Demo Party are not American Values but Islamic Values - the DP was infiltrated by Muslims at the request of the AMA - they now control the hierarchy purse strings &amp; political strategy. Kellison, Jarret, &amp; Muslim Brotherhood - all cloaked with minorities
@replouiegohmert @Coffeytweet Mueller is a "deep state elitist" who engages in treason against the Constitution in the furtherance of his aims. He is dangerous, methodically stealth, &amp; unelected. DSE (deep state elitists) are in both parties - mostly paid by the Saudi Wahhabi sect of Islam indirectly/directly
@SenatorCantwell Lady how can you speak your BS with a straight face? You're responsible for overseas Americans forced to destroy their families &amp; permanently separate &amp; abandon their children You're a deep state Demo carpetbagger who did treason against Const. Rights. Phew!
@princeh81976229 I'm a screenwriter motion pictures. Science fiction you can see my screenplays &amp; books https://t.co/a5A6hPBarz - any production companies in Dubai?
@princeh81976229 Wow these children are your family? Its fantastic being a father isn't it. Great to meet you.
@princeh81976229 thank you for the follow.
@princeh81976229 thank you for theme follow
@Miamiescapee @bostonnewslocal Are you serious? Our so called allies need to be ragged on. And our ally Saudi Arabia needs to be obliterated off the planet after 09/11 - Russia is just an Islamic diversion to their infiltration &amp; meddling into USA affairs. Do your damn research lady instead of mouthing off MSM
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Mr. President, your failure to terminate deep state elitist AG Sessions who hides his allegiance by omission is a stain on your integrity. Remove the bastard immediately!
@RepCohen @RepEdRoyce @SpeakerRyan Sir before U start talking BS to the public &amp; fellow Democrats - let's call a spade a spade. The damn Saudis Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam have infiltrated, paid, &amp; control the purse strings of the Democratic Party which really pisses me off as a Democrat. Russia is a diversion.
@RepCohen Sir, I don't think the hearing is a witch hunt at all. The facts are the FBI &amp; other non-elected government positions are suppose to be NEUTRAL. Clearly this is NOT the case at all. Strozk should be removed from office based upon public bias.
@RepCohen To be honest, our so called allies needed confrontation about Russian gas unless NATO and the claim Russia is a threat is nothing more than bullshit - and that is what my natural conclusion is as a Democrat. We should dissolve NATO - Russia is a Christian value nation now.
@SenatorMenendez what about repealing IMBRA &amp; related laws that are forcing overseas Americans to destroy their families &amp; permanently abandon their children or live in Exile for family unification? When did the USA start fucking their own people? I'm exiled with my wife &amp; kids.
@SenatorMenendez if the USA is so worried about Russia's S-400's why don't we have the Russian Federation protect America or ally with them because it looks like militarily were fucked &amp; can't keep up with their technology. Shitcan our Saudi allies.
@hootin_heck @loverandomleigh @FIFAWorldCup Oh NO! Now the closet queers &amp; old fat lesbian wenches are kicking beautiful women out of FIFA! Next will be boxing!
@hootin_heck @loverandomleigh @FIFAWorldCup This is what happens when you put closet queers &amp; old fat lesbian wenches in charge of FIFA!
@realDonaldTrump What about overseas Americans forced to destroy their families &amp; permanently  abandon their children or live in Exile? When did the USA start saying fuck Americans too?  Repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws. I'm one of the Exiled.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @US_Secy_State You are RIGHT &amp; you are WRONG about Germany, Russia, &amp; NATO. Germany buying gas from Russia means that we don't need NATO &amp; Russia isn't a threat! Dissolve the alliance and save America BILLIONS OF $'S.
@WhiteHouse You are RIGHT &amp; you are WRONG about Germany, Russia, &amp; NATO. Germany buying gas from Russia means that we don't need NATO &amp; Russia isn't a threat! Dissolve the alliance and save America BILLIONS OF $'S.

@p_edelmann its too bad the US government isn't confronted about forcing overseas Americans into Exile versus destroyed families and forced separation of children. Please Read: https://t.co/Oevad8g4ve
@SenSchumer Trump meeting Putin is far more honorable than Demo Party secretly being funded &amp; infiltrated by Saudi Arabia using Russia as a diversion from being investigated for interfering into our gov news colleges military. GTH sir.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS I think you are doing great putting these trade tariffs on all of these nations using the USA as a piggy bank. The next real thing you need to do is EXIT NATO. These nations claim a need us to protect them, while buying Russian oil &amp; gas. Let them defend themselves &amp; save USA $
@MSNBC @SenatorMenendez Give me a break! The Democratic Party is using the Russian Federation as a DIVERSION considering the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam pays off our government officials &amp; infiltrated our news, colleges, and military. In other words your assessment is deep state elitist bullshit.
@senorrinhatch @senjudiciary With all due respect, Mr. Hatch is easily assessed as a deep state elitist who will be doing America a favor the quicker he leaves office. No sympathy for the man.
@SenJohnMcCain @antonioguterres @washingtonpost I thought similar to your assessment until after my intense research that the Rohingya had engaged in jihadist style terrorist acts justified under the Islamic ideology against the government resulting in deaths. After assessing the new information my natural conclusion changed.
@fatbob3sons @BillOReilly Raymond ideology is very close to the original intent of our Forefather's. Trump's selection is a deep state elitist who is not good for America.
@BillOReilly Raymond would have been a better choice.
@WhiteHouse - I had a dream you nominated a different person to the USSC - now my dream isn't a vision but was only a dream - whaaaaa lol
@JudgeTedPoe @realDonaldTrump No he won't. This creates a minority representation of 69% Protestant nation.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Madam I totally disagree with you. Why? When I was young I believed women should have abortions for any reason. In my old age after viewing videos of - after conception life. There is no doubt life begins at conception. And abortion is murder. Women use the pill etc or go to jail
@WhiteHouse It is very difficult when a person such as myself has visions of events before they happen. So, if I go ahead and tell the world that you are going to nominate Raymond Kethledge to the U.S.  Supreme Court &amp; read these words before you make your announcement, then you will believe
@VictoriaH1962 @USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 "Lie to the Lamb" is a Jewish expression - the right to be untruthful to secure dominance over Christians within the perspective of being chosen &amp; comply to Protestant Christians expecting Jewish people to "affirm" an oath to maintain Christian values as American values in gov.
@VP @POTUS May I suggest to you that you are going to nominate Raymond Kethledge because I already saw your announcement in my dreams. Congratulations Mr. Kethledge.
@SenJohnMcCain @Reuters I disagree. These gentlemen knew that Burma has strong religious ties with their government regarding Buddhism &amp; their perception of Islam. Mr. McCain you receive over $1 mil a year from followers of Islam - your thoughts are tainted.
@RepEBJ I am not  so sure that you are correct on this issue. In my younger years, I believed a woman had the right to choose to have an abortion for any reason. In my older years &amp; after reviewing videos of life after conception - it is my firm belief that life starts at conception.
@FarzadAzizi16 @niklassvensson @jimmieakesson @ExpressenTV @annieloof Whomever made that sentence should be evaluated for mental stability - surely an insane sentence for an act that is not a crime.
@nikkihaley While you enjoy your loved ones in America. I'm American enjoying my loved ones in Exile because Americans can't sponsor their wives under IMBRA &amp; Related laws that complex Americans to abandon their families or face Exile. America's Shame!
So Americans are always bitching about their gun laws without realizing just how lucky we are! LOOK AT RUSSIA! Their government is trying to reduce the Russian people's right to limit guns to only 20 guns per... https://t.co/PDVBZCFokw
@robjective I find the "main goal" of the Democrats identifying the Russian Federation as "meddlers" as a diversion to the Saudi infiltration &amp; financing of the Demo Party, our government and military - which is far more intrusive - Russia is the cover up. Angry American about this bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump If you select a female Catholic you're making a major political blunder to a 69% Protestant nation represented by 70% catholics &amp; 30% Jewish special interests that include 1 lesbian 2 barren &amp; 1 "lie to the Lamb" women. The USSC will destroy America. Protestant only sir.
@realDonaldTrump Now go for the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Islamic sect that infiltrated USA financed these blunders &amp; used the Russian Federation as a diversion to offset their exposure.
@LucidHuricaneX @dsa_louisville @DemSocialists The problem I have is new US laws are forcing overseas American families to be destroyed &amp; children permanently separated or be Exiled. Repeal IMBRA &amp; Related laws. How do I know this? Im exiled to preserve family unity. Thats how.
@dsa_louisville @DemSocialists Some of our deep state elitists who believe they can do violence &amp; treason against the US Constitution by claiming the poltically correct exemption doctrine - on both sides of the isle need to be publicly confronted! Im a Republican - expose them with my blessings! No violence.
@US_Secy_State An error in negotiations with NK is if you push too hard on all.our issues you come accross one sided. Give NK a bite of the apple of the big picture. Words of wisdom.

The United States is using every means possible to restrict Americans overseas &amp; international travel rights to the point of being dangerous to our own citizens. Maybe its time for everyone to secure secondary passports? https://t.co/4rJoejPhQe

@senjudiciary @SenSchumer America is 69% Protestant while the USSC is 6 Catholics &amp; 3 Jewish of whom 1 is lesbian, two barren women, &amp; 3 feminists. How about representing the Protestant majority in America with a Protestant Judge instead of the minorities ruling over the majority?

@StephenKing Trump isn't dividing us. The Democratic Party is. AMA told Muslims to infiltrate the party. They now control the hierarchy of the DP &amp; now there is political violence &amp; discord. Russia is diversion to Saudi Arabian infiltration into our mainstream media, gov military etc wake up
@jk_rowling Actually, I think President Trump is starting to do okay...contrary to what people are saying...
@GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump Life begins at Conception &amp; no one can change that fact except our Heavenly Father, also known as God!
@SecNielsen @POTUS @DHSgov @CBP @ICEgov I'm 68 and a natural born American. Republican. I Never needed or heard of any of these agencies until BUSH became president &amp; engaged in a treasonable alliance with Saudi Arabia. Our people are fantastic when not molded into deep state elitists. Dissolve ICE!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS This overseas American family sits in Exile while the bastards who call themselves Americans tell us to destroy our families &amp; abandon our children. REPEAL IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS. No social value in destroying American families.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Start by repealing IMBRA &amp; related laws that bar Americans from sponsoring spouses compels abandoning their children &amp; wives - Feminists lawyers doing treason against Constitution. Arrest them
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS I'm Republican &amp; feel ICE is sleazy ass deep state fanatics when they stop my car a hundred miles from the border asking me a stupid ass question if I'm American. Invading my privacy &amp; wasting my time while intimidating me.
@POTUS Ipray that you nominate  a Protestant for USSC justice. We have 6 Catholics &amp; 3 Jewish judges &amp; 69% of America is Protestant with no representation.
@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump MS-13 was created in American prisons under our system of justice - then we deported them back to their countries.
@realDonaldTrump ICE is a diversionary bunch of bullshit sir! With all due respect, it was Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect Muslims who attacked USA on 09/11/2001 - But the ARE NOT BANNED? Do you know the difference between them and Catholic Mexicans? Bush created ICE. Bush egaged inTREASON AGAINST USA!

@realDonaldTrump And how many of these bastards are using the Russian "diversion" to cover their covert Saudi meddling, financing, and interference in our U.S. government that's far more extensive than any Russian meddling. These men should be charged with treason beginning with Pres. Bush!
@senjudiciary The Ginsburg Standard is from the perception of a Jewish person elected into an American value government whose foundation is Protestant Christian. Her concepts of law are equated with it's okay to "Lie to the Lamb" - if you understand the Jewish meaning.
@senjudiciary Amul Thapar conceals his religious affiliation. Many "Indians" are of the Islamic ideology. His extreme sentence on an 80 + non-violent woman of 35 months in prison was barbaric, cruel &amp; sadistic - far from any realistic judicial decision. Think deeply before nominating to USSC.

@repmarkpocan I disagree. I believe ICE should be eliminated along with "Homeland Security" which reminds me of the Nazi Era of Germany. We never needed either of these agencies prior to President Bush's secret affairs with the Saudis whose ideology - the Wahhabi sect is responsible for 09/11.
@ThisWeekABC @MarthaRaddatz I totally disagree with you &amp; I'm not a Socialist Democrat. We had excellent Immigration standards in the 1970's &amp; we didn't have ICE harassing the hell out of Americans on American soil. This is a Bush escapade diverting attention from the Saudi Wahhabi 09/11 attack! Screw ICE!
@spkerofthehouse 33% of Supreme Court Justices are Jewish. 66% are Catholics. Yet, 69% of Americans are PROTESTANT. How about nominating a minority Protestant American to represent the majority of Americans?

@realDonaldTrump The Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam should be banned from the USA regardless of how much oil and money they have. They are deceptive terrorists who have infiltrated our government. BAN THEM &amp; STOP THE OIL!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I beg to differ with you. Its time to reign in the police state mentality realizing that many Americans have a desensitized mentality towards psychological torture &amp; extreme police state tactics &amp; many of our era  don't &amp; know a better American life without all of the drama
@RealLastJedi @TomCottonAR You means since Bush? The guy who got 1.5 plus bil for letting the sausis attack us on 09/11?

@JimHaf1 @keefybabe @dietrich_eiden @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 Please read about how easy it is to return to the good ol' USA; http://www.grinolsson	Com/Americans-in-Exile-Condidential-Report.pdf
@ParisBelle7 @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 Please like you claimed the same thing against FDR when he put people to work during the Great Depression. Those people in turn saved their money &amp; started new businesses that made America Great Again. Social Security claimed to be Socialism. LETS REMOVE ALL ROADS - Socialist! HA
@ParisBelle7 @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 Disagree totally with you. You put socialism to work like a capitalist. How? Student doctors get free tuition R/B. They pay gov back working 10 years for gov at low wage to reimburse. Duh! Win-Win
@POTUS with 3 Jewish &amp; 6 Catholics, including 1 lesbian &amp; 2 feminists, How about nominating a Protestant to represent the other 66% of Americans?
@KamalaHarris With 6 catholics, 3 Jewish, including 3 feminists &amp; 1 lesbian. How about selecting a Protestant married man to represent the other 66% of Americans?
@TomCottonAR To be honest, I am a Republican &amp; realist. Our nation for 200 year never had an ICE - &amp; I don't see why we need one now. We need to ban Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Sect Muslims for 09/11/2001 = Stop using Mexicans as a diversion to appease our Muslim friends. After that then we talk!

@ShaunJo04739310 @eavesdropann @DCClothesline It isn't Trump's fault. It is Bush - and it is with that asshole we have laws forcing Americans into exile &amp; forced separation from their children or securing residency outside the USA: Please read: https://t.co/Oevad8g4ve
@repmarkpocan I agree - American existed 200 years without this ICE nonsense - I don't think we need it now.
@RichSMallory @DianaforTrump @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 I didn't enjoy volunteer for military service during Vietnam to share my body with the USA as expendable - that is socialism in a capitalist society. Adding medical and education is easily afforded as giving Pakistan 6.5 bil to like the USA better - like Clinton did.
@RichSMallory @DianaforTrump @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 You not understanding concepts of "socialism, communism, and capitalism". Suggest that you study portions of those ideologies mixed with capitalism tor the common good of society, we build roads &amp; volunteer for military defense. Let's add medical - but not total socialism to gov.
@DianaforTrump @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 I disagree with you. Captialism with socialist applications to the disabled elderly pensions, education, and medical treatment for all - is lust like driving down the roads which are a result of socialistic capitalism. Not too much - just enough to take care of our own..
@Doberdad20 @nycDSA @Ocasio2018 the government doesn't own everything. It mainstains the roads, hospitals, and pensions for the elderly and disabled  - from taxes first - not trillions disappearing in the Pentagon and they can't explain where the money went -
@realDonaldTrump Sir, you must not forget that elections are not just to elect a good person for good governance but to vote out deep state elitists and assholes! ;)
@nycDSA @Ocasio2018 Socialism mixed with capitalism creates care for all of the public in: roads, medical, and education.
@Ocasio2018 congratulations on your victory.
@Ocasio2018 Congratulations on  your victory! It's great to see deep state elitists being replaced by the public! Beware of minority political -religious intruders in Demo hierarchy provoking political violence with non American values! Good luck on your way to Congress;
@RepAdamSchiff You hit the nail on the head! And its only going to get worse. Get our nukes &amp; military men out of Turkey before they seize everything for themselves. Turkey is DANGEROUS &amp; to appease them is insanity!
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis @AmericaNewsroom Look @ big picture since AMA told Muslims to infiltrate Demo Party then took over party hierarchy $ purse strings - political violence escalates because American values replace &amp; minorities deceived to escalate violence. Muslims sit back laugh!
@RepMaloney The Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam which is the Islamic ideology behind 09/11/2001 is the sect of Islam that should be BANNED  from entering the United States. What has Catholic Mexicans have to do with terrorists? NOTHING except a diversion.
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely Sir. You should compel open hearings!
@DonaldNorcross actually the President might have a point. Aliens outside of the USA don't have any US Constitutional rights until they are on American soil. Now if they come on American soil illegally there may very well be precedent to push them back over the border - like an invader.
@realDonaldTrump With all due respect sir, the wall isn't going to do shit. While Americans took the pill &amp; didn't want babies - the rest of the world increased to over 6 billion. We're outnumbered and destined to become extinct. Do what Russia does &amp; pay for extra babies? Were Doomed sir.

@NBCNews This is great to know. Many people thinks Trump's executive order doesn't go far enough - but the reality of his order - it does. All that these children need is to know their parents are safe and that they are there for them - keep them together - and proceed.
@RepMarkMeadows It's time to disband &amp; terminate the entire DOJ - reeducate them on American values and standards after restructuring the agency.  Terminate all deep state elitists who believe their powers are above Congress, Presidency &amp; Supreme Court.
@USAGSessions @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan Non-Elected Deep State Elitists that believe in their politically correct Constitutional Exemption Doctrine to do whatever the hell they want - AG should arrest &amp; charge them with violence &amp; treason against the U.S. Constitution and government without delay!

@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Congratulations! What about IMBRA &amp; related laws forcing Americans to abandon their wives &amp; children overseas? Americans Forst Sir! Dont allow destruction of USA familirs based on sadistic laws with no social value. Gov is barred under 9th Amend from making these laws.
@SecNielsen Under the circumstances, you &amp; Trump dod fantastic. Next repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws that destroy families &amp; separate kids from parents under US compelled abandonment by American spouse. Family unity is allowed only in EXILE.
@POTUS Expeditious and extremely commendable action on keeping families together! Congratulations sir!
@realDonaldTrump Excellent Order sir! Congratulations.
@WashTimes @SenatorLankford Give me a break! You are looking for "ghosts" - Remember Voice of America sending our propaganda out into the Communist airwaves? Russian trolls don't make a shit any more than American trolls effect Russians. Give us a real troll - like Saudi Arabians!
@realDonaldTrump - its Aldo my natural conclusion that Mueller, Eisenstein, &amp; yes Sessions are deep state elitists who are "pulling your tail" with bullshit &amp; have got to go. These are the kind of guys that you grab by the collar &amp; throw them out the door!
@StephenMilIer @BlissTabitha Laura Bush should acknowledge that on her husband's watch IMBRA was created that forces American husbands to abandon their wives &amp; children overseas because they can't sponsor them to America - leaving them in poverty.
@SecNielsen My apologies Madam, not that I agree with you or your politics or ideology - but rather - you just got into office - and suddenly they throw all of this shit all at once with no notice or preparation, that no one could properly handle - Good Luck on finding a solution
@SecNielsen No one can stop people from marrying, having children, associate with, or intruded into marital privacy. IMBRA is like the English taking Scottish brides on their wedding night - contaminating them - then giving them back to their spouses. These impositions are not valid laws.

IMBRA is like the English taking Scottish brides on their wedding night - contaminating them - then giving them back to their spouses. These impositions are not valid laws.
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez I was unaware of all of these issues until I decided to find out what the hell is going on - because Americans overseas are being traumatized by these laws after already engaging in marriage and having children. I'm not just talking about me. I know of 5 cases in Cebu alone.
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez In the USA process - compulsory Constitutional deprivations within the scope of marital community are scandalous &amp; Constitutionally forbidden. 9th Amend. These feminists went over the red line on wives &amp; children of Americans using techniques of psychological torture.
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez If they do not abandon their wives &amp; children, the American men are compelled to seek marital permanent residency in other countries. Sponsorship denial regardless of background should not be allowed with wives &amp; children - vetting should be only the alien spouse, &amp; Not American
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez Leyla Muro-Wilson &amp; Maria Cantrell are responsible. Leyla receives over $12 mil for processing. American men are the diversion. She brings in Muslim wives under IMBRA while American men are psy tortured, denied  same marital rights as if they are in the USA on predictions.
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez I beg to differ with you. I did extensive research on IMBRA &amp; related laws regarding spouses. Saw MAJOR obstacles for American husbands here. So, I'm a writer &amp; researched it all out. SHOCKED &amp; OUTRAGED at what I found to be the source regarding their reasons, diversions, &amp; fraud
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez Are you going to sue them for me? Are you a lawyer? I'm a permanent resident of the Philippines now with two wonderful sons &amp; a new life. But, my daughter was indeed kidnapped &amp; the USA covered it up. Judge &amp; I got into argument of him acting in the furtherance of child snatching
@sofiegeorge @SenatorMenendez lol - proof of what?That is the problem with Americans the gov conceals their crimes - kidnapping is my opinion of what they did. No crime being a father &amp; approached by immigration based on a phone call of misinformation. The crime is that they didn't check out their facts.

@US_Secy_State This is one confrontation we need to stay out of - the Russian Federation will protect borders of "Mother Russia established by Catherine the Great - come hell or high water. These Ukraine provinces are Russian people stolen during Communist years from Russia. Leave it alone!
@US_Secy_State Strongly disagree sir! Look at a 1917 map of the Ukraine. No Black Sea ports - landlocked Roman Catholics in a Lithuania, Poland corridor. The Eastern provinces were given to Ukraine by Soviet Premiers - no vote - stroke of a pen. They are Russian Orthodox who are &amp; vote Russia

@Venom024024 @SenatorMenendez And, the second time is when I heard a immigration lady in the background saying they had new information my daughter wasn't my biological child I heard her voice - room where 2nd guy was standing in the doorway - guy extremely nervous freaked my girl - I was thinking WTF is this
@Venom024024 @SenatorMenendez Yes, there were two instances - I was released after being beaten &amp; reunified with my daughter - then they called me back a few days later - in an immigration room - one man was lurking next to a door - that's when my little girl became terrified - then they attacked  second time
@Bree000007 @SenatorMenendez went through a point of entry - the attack came later based on false information disseminated that I wasn't the biological father when I was. Without notice they attacked. I fended off 4 of them but the 5th? They beat my ass while holding a child that i handed of in mid air.
@VeteransHealth But what about non-service connected disabilities? The VA approved my hip replacement for operation in the Philippines. When i got here, they said it had to be service connected. Results are I can't get my operation here &amp; I'm disabled.
@Al_FinkNJ @SenatorMenendez Wsh you were right, but you're not. My little girl was ripped from my arms with no proper notice or identification process by out of uniform immigration. fought 5 of them - they beat the shit out of me - only to find out I'm DAD - Sorry Al - don't question my veracity - its true.
@FidTradZ101 @SenatorMenendez You don't understand. It's you who needs to leave or be charged with treason against the Constitution &amp; violence against citizens rights and freedoms. I'm a veteran from the Vietnam era - Was taught to deal with non-American &amp; freedom hating ideologies. You got a problem? U LEAVE
@US_Secy_State Mr. Secretary, our U.S. position on the UNHRC is totally correct in its assessment to remove the United States from such an asinine body. This does not allude the fact that we must properly apply basic human rights ourselves.
@RepDonaldPayne American immigration laws are so bad &amp; unconstitutional for Americans not to mention illegal immigrants. The feminists groom family before destruction. Husbands can't sponsor wives must abandon children overseas to poverty and disease. IMBRA &amp; RELATED LAWS must go

@US_Secy_State 15 years ago, the USA provided false information to Immigration Canada that I'm not my daughter's Dad. I'm her biological DAD. I was attacked by 5 immigration official handing her off in mid-air. Never seen her again. NEVER TRUST IMMIGRATION OR AMERICA WITH YOUR CHILDREN! Torture https://t.co/04XlmZWmRX
@US_Secy_State Americans can't sponsor their alien wives under IMBRA this results in our American children being forcibly separated from their parents. So, if a father brings his children to America without his wife because he can't sponsor her - will Immigration seize or kidnap his children?
@USAGSessions Sir, you're NOT protecting children by separating them from their families. You're looking into the abyss of evil techniques of psychological torture with a desensitized mind. You forgot that you have the right to NOT follow unconstitutional laws and unlawful orders
@USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 I DIFFER WITH YOU! Rosenstein's Jewish perception of American values is "Lie to the Lamb" &amp; NOT perceived by the FOREFATHERS. Christians oath is the Bible. Jewish AFFIRM to maintain Christian values in gov.. He forgot his powers of being a Jew is NOT stronger than the Congress.
@VetAffairsOIG Sir, there are 1,000's of US disabled veterans who are denied medical treatment at the VA hospital in Manila, Philippines, but Vets from Guam are flown to Philippines for hospital treatment. They need urgent treatment. When will a decision be made to help our vet?
@SecPompeo You are so correct on this issue!
@SecPompeo Sir, when is the VA going to authorize disabled veterans to receive medical treatment at the VA hospital in Manila Philippines? Vets in Guam are flown to Philippines for medical treatment but Vets here only receive medication. 1000's of Vets need help sir.
@VAVetBenefits Am curious when the VA proposes to make a decision to allow disabled veterans to secure medical treatment at the Manila Philippines VA hospital. Thousands of veterans are in need of treatment.
@VeteransHealth When is the VA going to allow veterans medical treatment in the Manila VA hospital in the Philppines? Thousands of US vets are suffering!

@realDonaldTrump What about Americans being denied to sponsor their wives to the USA - then forced to destroy their marriage, abandon their children and wives in 3rd countries? IMBRA &amp; related laws need to be repealed before letting NON-AMERICAN IMMGRANTS &amp; their children in to the USA!

@ATFHQ @trentonpolice @NJSP Give Americans real news okay? The shooter sports an Islamic style beard and his first name is Pakistani nationality, but shooting 22 people isn't terrorist related, just a pissed off person gone whacko? WTF? Are you working for deep state elitists?
@TroyRiser @kathygriffin American children &amp; families are separated &amp; compelled to destroy under IMBRA &amp; related laws. US families are forced into exile to maintain family unity. How do I know? I'm a vet &amp; also one of the exiled. Thank God I got residency overseas because USA betrays their citizens.
@kathygriffin Lady your comments aren't comical nor do they show any social value - not even a chuckle or a smirk. Disappear, regroup with a positive comical punch &amp; start over before you destroy your public image if it isn't already too late. Words of wisdom
@dmb1031 @SandraTXAS USA IMBRA &amp;_related laws compel family destruction, children separation &amp; family exiles. Kind of like English screwing Scottish brides on the wedding night - only worse - forcing wives &amp; children to be abandon &amp; contaminated then groomed with feminist lesbian BS while they starve
@PeggyGolemo @realDonaldTrump Its a fact. Leyla Muro-Wilson gets millions $ using American spouses as the diversion denying sponsorship. Created for jihadist Muslim wives into USA for filing abuse complaint against husbands. Its fraud &amp; treason against our Const. She's minority Muslim regulates marital sex.
@SecNielsen American spouses are denied sponsorships in violation of basic human rights. So screw the immigrants kids &amp; bring our families home before they declare civil war on our deep state elitists &amp; vote them out of office. This note is from an American DAD &amp; family in exile!
@SecNielsen Please educate yourself before talking shit lady! IMBRA &amp; related laws force family destruction &amp; separation of children from AMERICAN parents who are forced into EXILE. IMBRA is like the English taking first conjugal rights on the Scottish brides wedding nights. Repeal it!
@GovMurphy Give me a f#@king break. The killer's beard with a Pakistani first name? And you completely neglect to suggest Islamic ties &amp; blaming guns? You"re either a God damn moron or a deep state elitist who needs to be charged with treason against the Constitution &amp; removed!
@POTUS - The USA IMBRA &amp; related laws DESTROY Father's Day &amp; are tantamount to the English having first conjugal rights with Scottish brides! Repeal &amp; charge the creators with treason!
@rweingarten @DNC I presume the DNC will remove all Muslims that infiltrated the Demo Party &amp; took over heiarchy positions under orders from the AMA because Muslims didnt have a large enough voter block? Now they propagate political violence under a lineral banner? Ha!
@realDonaldTrump I'm serious Mr. President. Americans are a family - whether they be the best of the best or our morons - we must stand by our nation citizens first - and if we treat our own like animals who seek refuge or exile to maintain their family - we are looking into the abyss of tyranny
@PeggyGolemo @realDonaldTrump It was not Trump - It was under Obama and the Demo Party that created these laws - Read exactly what Trump is saying....I thought like you at first - then realized - he is telling us - get Congress to change these horrific laws against family and immigration. Double check it!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mueller is far more dangerous than you suspect. He's one of the deep state elitist kingpins who needs to be neutralized by being terminated. He knows Islamists control $ &amp; Demo Party hierarchy propagating political violence. He's on their payroll - he's a dumbfuck
@realDonaldTrump True start with repeal of IMBRA &amp; related laws obstructing American family unification forcing them into exile &amp; refugee status. How do I know this? I secured a permanent visa overseas versus US dictating family destruction via unconstitutional laws.
@realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about? I'm an American vet &amp; I cant even bring my wife &amp; children home to America because of IMBRA - Americans FIRST - to hell with the rest until you bring American families home first.
@realDonaldTrump - FIX Americans being denied right to sponsor alien spouse &amp; family who must live in exile or refugee status for family unification - Repeal IMBRA &amp; Related laws to avoid International condemnation. UN Complaints being prepared.
@sjbrg @KettilsMead Sorri - eg tala islanskol
@sjbrg @KettilsMead that means no one has a clue what your talking about - explain yourself.
@RTSportNews Awesome originality for team spirit!
@realDonaldTrump That's right Americans forced to abandon alien spouses &amp; US children in foreign nations - OUTRAGE by one Father in Exile - neutralize the deep state elitists plundering our treasury with these treasonable laws to benefit minority Islam using our citizens as a diversion.
@realDonaldTrump You must mandate REPEAL of IMBRA &amp; related laws forcing American families &amp; children into Exile, Destruction or abandonment by denying Americans right to sponsor ship solely for being AMERICAN because those laws are Treason against our people.
@TuckerCarlson IMBRA is creating American familes in exile &amp; refugees to maintain family unification. TO HELL with Int. Refugees - take care of USA unification &amp; children 1st - my family is forcibly exiled &amp; Im US vet. IMBRA allows jihadists wives in while destoying US families.
@Beccamford Email me
@RealAlexJones The complete fall of the deep state elitists must include judges who condone PC via constitutional	Exemption doctrine. Treason against our constitution freedoms &amp; rights. They have to be reeducated in US values or got to go!
@KremlinRussia_E President Putin, I pray that you do not share the S-500 with Turkey, I see disaster in this nations future based on it's evil diversionary presumption to bring forth a 2nd Ottoman Empire! Dangerous ally, friend, &amp; opponent.
@realDonaldTrump - when deep state elitists like Rosenstein believe they're more powerful than Congress or Presidency - Ultimatum to Sessions FIRE HIM or BE FIRED.
@bgmama58 Trump? It was created under Obama. American men are the diversion to bring wives of jihadists into USA on different visa if they file complaint. Its fraudulent premises treason against constitution.
@POTUS To HELL with world refugees! When are you going to repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws so Americans can sponsor their wives instead of living in EXILE?
@realDonaldTrump - When the hell are you going to repeal IMBRA &amp; related laws so Americans can sponsor wives instead of living in EXILE? To hell with world refugees until you take care if Americans FIRST!
@dccc I'm American &amp; our gov sentenced my wife to death with cancer &amp; my children to poverty under their IMBRA laws - How about helping Americans to bring their US children home first? Or, how about bring dad home first to start a civil war &amp; remove deep state elitists from government?
@dccc What a bunch of "Bullshit"! Americans First! IMBRA now forces American families into Exile &amp; Refugee status in foreign nations because Americans can't sponsor wives even if it means death or child abandonment &amp; financial peril. How do I know? My wife has cancer &amp; I;m targeted.
@elonmusk Make best battery option available standard - why? China plans to go all electric by 2025 - 1.5 bil people why!
@QueenRania You are very beautiful - but Jordanian freedom for women is only good for as long as your reign. There will be a day - a new day - where fanatics prevail.
@sjbrg @KettilsMead So what is all of this suppose to mean? That you're pro-Islamic world caliphate or some shit?
@BlissTabitha Rosenstein and Sessions - both deep state elitists need to be removed from office. They no more follow American values than Nazi storm troopers. Rosenstein applies Jewish values to American Christian values - remember? - you affirm - Christians use the Bible to take office.
@US_Secy_State Strange - because under USA IMBRA Americans aren't allows to sponsor their wives and children back to the USA forced to abandon them to poverty, illness &amp; out on the street - YES - United States children who are citizens! Take care of America 1st
@US_Secy_State Fantastic teamwork!
@WhiteHouse Happy Birthday, Mr. President!
@POTUS Happy Birthday Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump - Happy Birthday Mr. President!
@DineshDSouza Because Rosie is a deep state elitist and those people just like Rosestein are above Congress &amp; laws - do what they want - because tgeyre not Americam value Christians but Jewish values -they affirm without the bible oath. Their crimes dont count!
@US_Secy_State I will reiterate US IMBRA laws are forcing American families into exile &amp; refugee status. I know for a fact because my family is affected. So until laws are removed to destroy families stop talking shit anout non US refugees &amp; exiled peoples.
@US_Secy_State Sir we dont need to to deal with these refugees until we recind IMBRA laws now forcing American families into exile &amp; tefugees. Our family is one of them! IMBRA is treason against Comstitution!
@realDonaldTrump -So Rosenstein &amp; Sessions believe their powers are above Congress? TREASON! Terminate both these deep state elitists!
@USAGSessions - Sir you either terminate deep state slitist Rosenstein or the public will go after your ass too! He thinks his powers are above Congress? TREASON!
@tonesterify @geertwilderspvv The problem solely arises with  exercising "freedom of speech", Muslims have no problem creating cartoons that are degrading to Christ's name as well as, enslaving, murdering, forced conversions, crucifixions of Christians as well as banning the Bible in Islamic nations. So??.
@Bob_Stannard @realDonaldTrump Actually Bob - You're talking bullshit about Trump. Why should all of these nations put huge import taxes on US goods instead of on par trade? They're not allies they're living off of us &amp; whining because he wants to wean them from the suck-a-teat. Go Trump!
@realDonaldTrump President Trump - You don't even need to waste your time commenting about De Niro's ranting spectacle - anyone who saw it - general public - can see that Mr. De Niro was being used &amp; has a few bolts missing in the machinery, so to speak.
@GreggJarrett Its time Congress &amp; the Presidency eliminate these non-elected deep state elitist government positions &amp; recreate the FBI CIA &amp; DOJ or eliminate them completely. We've had enough of their BS!
@USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions @POTUS To hell with these deep state elitists and all of their BS stories. Start working for the American people's freedoms and rights! Demand IMBRA be ended as treason against our privacy, association, and speech rights! Then, you're doing your job!
@USAGSessions IMBRA denies Americans sponsorship except allowing alien wives green card if they file complaint against spouses. No options except family destruction. Totally unconstitutional intruding into marital privacy. Does this mean DV exemptions for alien American spouses?
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations on a fantastic job dealing with North Korea!
@WayneASchneider @realDonaldTrump I disagree with your assessment totally.
@realDonaldTrump The results of your meeting will be a reunified Korea!
@ryanjreilly All faked for publicity so people think these deep state elitists should remain in power instead of being terminated &amp; transferred to the Alaska tundra.
@SecPompeo You have done an excellent job! Amazingly so! Congratulations.
@realDonaldTrump Sir I think its awesome that America takes back its right to fair trade. For too long the World uses us as a piggy bank. It couldn't last forever! Great job!
@realDonaldTrump HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. PRESIDENT! - If I tried to say it like Marilyn Monroe did to Kennedy - you'd probably vomit because I'm a guy and not gay - with a rough voice - more like a raspy horse. 39 again this year? lol
@JacobFried93 @ChadAaronMarlow @Hardcoremike420 @MissAmerica It seems to me that having a Miss America without a bikini relying solely on what comes out of a woman's mouth - reminds me of an old saying from my Grandfather, "If women didn't have vaginas, they'd be extinct!" Miss America contest is going to be extinct!
@ikalin1 I will concur with your term "discriminatory" but the term racist is not applicable - Islam enslaves all colors of mankind.
@ACLU You know - while you are defending this moron, what about Americans forced into exile &amp; refugee status under IMBRA laws compelling family destruction? Yea, defend Americans, not Muslims claiming to be Americans - but real Americans.
@ACLU He is NOT an American  citizen. He has sworn allegiance to his Imam and Islam. Their citizenship is called "brotherhood" and he would no more defend American than a cow out in the pasture. Set he free where they captured him!
@hwinkler4real You're too old to vote now! Just collect your pension and remain part of the silent majority! lol
@hwinkler4real Didn't you know? The Democratic Party said you're too old to vote now! Not to mention you're not an illegal immigrant! Just collect your pension and remain one of the silent majority! lol
@US_Secy_State You are so correct. But we have a long way to go with many obstacles in our path.
@Jilltay72785426 @Kahunanc @Dasani_01 @ezlusztig @realDonaldTrump Bullshit - racist is a word that was created and is used by the Muslim Brotherhood propaganda machine.  Islam enslaves all colors of mankind. The word discriminatory is what you are looking for - but racist? Only racists use that word to defend Islam.
@US_Secy_State Rather than a diversionary myopic approach on the Russian Federation, our government should be looking deeply into  Saudi infiltration of our mainstream media, industrial-military complex and government officials. These Saudi Wahhabi sect bastards need to be banned from the USA!
@US_Secy_State @Rosie - Lady, contrary to your assessment of Trump, you might take a look at the Muslims who infiltrated the Democratic Party hierarchy &amp; are pulling political violence strings using illiterate liberals &amp; feminists towards their world Caliphate goals, Your an idiot at best.
@MsMelChen The world is two genders. Feminists who undermine equality standards by requiring politically correct exemption doctrines in a power play over males will ultimately destroy their society opening the door for Islamification where no male will want to defend feminist rights anymore
@US_Secy_State It is very doubtful that you can accommodate Turkey over their intent to annex the Kurdish areas of Syria by exercising their former expansionist Ottoman Empire perception of themselves by believing their are again powerful to take on this region. Beware sir - Turkey is DANGEROUS
@US_Secy_State Excellent
@Jilltay72785426 @Kahunanc @Dasani_01 @ezlusztig @realDonaldTrump Totally Disagree with you - Discriminatory is the word - Racist reflects the color of one's skin. There is no way discriminatory conduct is racist - unless the Muslims of specific color apply their skin color to a remark. It is racist calling people Americans? No!
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump I tried to follow the link from here in the philippines. Its not working &amp; i teally want one of thiose hats.
@realDonaldTrump You're totally correct! Your counsel needs to file a Writ of Quo Warranto with the USSC. Why they havent done so by now, I dont have a clue, so I counsel you to do so.
@Kahunanc @Dasani_01 @ezlusztig @realDonaldTrump Are you talking about yourself? Confronting Islam is not racist. The ideology enslaves all colors of mankind. Americans - black, white, asians demanding Ameeican values be applied to gov standards are not "white" nationalists. So sorry 4 U.
@PutinRF_Eng - why not advise Assad to make peace with the Kurds - federation - yet Syria - to end the war? Kurds could be great allies to Assad if approached correctly. Screw the Turks - theyre evil.
@verbosity99 @realDonaldTrump Are you serious? Thats his daughter! No matter how rich or famous a Dad is - doesnt mean shit  when it comes time to defend your child. Its called parental instinct. The bitch talking ahit isnt funny.
@realDonaldTrump Your correct! The attack on Obama was bad taste satire covered by 1st. Bee attack was personal verbal assault. There is a difference.
@US_Secy_State Isn't this the truth. What's problematic with Syria is that Assad is more secular &amp; protects minority religions. The Sunnis from the Ottoman Empire - when in power murdered 7 out of 10 mil Balkan Christians and 1 mil Armenians. The Sunni more fanatical. be careful.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS These nations lead the world to believe that you are starting a "trade war" when the reality is you're starting a "LET'S BE FAIR IN TRADE" war. Great job, Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump These nations lead the world to believe that you are starting a "trade war" when the reality is you're starting a "LET'S BE FAIR IN TRADE" war. Great job, Mr. President!
@therealroseanne Think about what these domestic enemies have done to you &amp; them! Exercising free speech after working hours &amp; fired. Regardless if you were bad to the bone - it's your right. It's not their right to fire you for expressing yourself. Sue them! Sue them big!
@niklassvensson @jimmieakesson @ExpressenTV @annieloof He is trying to tell you Muslims reduce our natural genetic adaptation to our habitat with jihad immigrants. We will be conquered and our women cultivated with the characteristics of the Middle East - get used to it or get rid of immigrants
@KettilsMead Hann er að reyna að segja þér múslimar draga úr náttúrulegum erfðafræðilegum aðlögun okkar að búsvæði okkar með jihadum innflytjenda. Við munum verða sigruð og konur okkar ræktaðir með einkenni Mið-Austurlöndum - venjast því eða losna við innflytjendur

@realDonaldTrump What's really sad is people losing their jobs over exercising freedom of speech - after working hours - just because its crude and the boss doesn''
@keithellison And would you call Christians who protest violent Qur'anic verses calling for beheafing and enslaving unfair cowardly and idiotic?
@piersmorgan Confronting the Islamic ideology is by no means racist. Islam embraces all colors &amp; creeds of mankind. The actual term is discriminatory. Those who use the "racist" claim are both ignorant &amp; racist Islamists identifying their ideology with their skin color.
@realDonaldTrump Very BAD idea to postpone this meeting. All was going your way! Same with your instinct to get out of Syria and Middle East. Stop listening to Saudi Sunni fanatics, our CIA, FBI, and Military-Industrial complex - and get us the hell out - NONE are our allies!
@KendahlTuttle @kingcosoPIO Yes - because they are animals of whose habitat has been invaded - and the invaders should be aware when out in the forests of Washington State - some type of defensive weapon should be available - small baseball, machete, spray etc..
@HattiesburgPD The most obvious destination of this lady would be Canada. There her conduct doesn't constitute a crime. Closest border crossing is Detroit and Windsor, Ontario Canada. If she crossed - she's free!
@kingcosoPIO Our family were homesteaders in this area - and everyone knows about cougars as well as encounters with cougars - the Cascades are their habitat &amp; they should not be killed - outrageous!
Credit and Special "Thanks" was given to GrinOlsson and his book, "The Christophe Rocancourt Affair" for participation in the CANAL + 2 part documentary, entitled, "IMPOSTURE(S)" - Genesis: https://t.co/DEs1aytSFY	- The Origin of Evil: https://t.co/AAB8sYS1Aa
@DeborahKIRO7 @KIRO7Seattle Scandalous that they euthanized the cougar. Our family were pioneer homesteaders in Issaquah - as a child camping up on the mountain - we all knew about cougars. They are natural to the area - Humans are not but encroaching on the cougar's natural habitat. Sad.
@AmichaiStein1 @netanyahu Thats a really creative and original protest sign. Congratulations.
@VBPDTraffic This law &amp; the ability of strangers (regardless if they are police) to place people under such scutiny far exceeds the Nazis keeping track of Jews in a Polish ghetto in 1942. No justification to go this far - regardless what they smoke.
@TheBankova @poroshenko With all due respect sir, Crimea was illegally given to the Ukraine with the stroke of a pen &amp; without a vote of the people who are both Russian speakers &amp; Russian Orthodox. Make peace sir.
@realDonaldTrump WTF is our military doing in S. Korea just before negotiations? Holding military maneuvers is bullshit - seriously sir - someone is making you look like a fool when you should have the Nobel Peace prize. Can you correct it?

@TheCoffeeBean - Only the ignorant would defend Islam and the followers of Islam by suggesting someone is racist for confronting that ideology. Islam enslaves all colors if mankind &amp; is a very dangerous &amp; nontolerant deceptive ideology.
@realDonaldTrump Followers of Islam swear allegiance to their Imam and Islam. Their citizenship is called brotherhood. When they come to settle in secular or non-Islamic nations it is for future conquest. Once you figure this out - then you have changed your thought process. God Bless!
@Emina_ibrahim What she says is true! The word Islamophobia was created by the Muslim brotherhood. Have you ever heard of Christianophibia? Nope! Take a Bible to a Muslim nation &amp; pray on the street. Then report back to us, if you're not murdered first.
@miqdaad @DawnHFoster @daily_politics Its my natural conclusion that Melanie is totally correct in her assessment of Islam. If you dispute her, I suggest you go Bible thumping in Saudi Arabia, then tell the world how successful you were. Reciprocal laws needed with Islamic nations.
@US_Secy_State Remember Nicaragua -  with negotiating a NK-SK unification treaty - The democratic parties splintered leaving Daniel Ortega's party the majority of the minority - and he took control democratically. The NK communists could pull the same on SK. words of wisdom to you sir - be wise
@EmbassyofRussia @KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia @Russian_Council @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassy @Dpol_un @DrMarcusP @MauriceSchleepe @Geostrat_ME @Amb_Yakovenko Congratulations Mr. President! As an American I admire your representation of your nation. They must be very proud of you!
@US_Secy_State Mr. Pompeo, you are doing a great job from North Korea negotiations to your guiding your subordinates. As an American, I'm impressed.
@MsMelChen Ah, come on! Next week the MetGala will feature Islamic Imam robes and head dresses with a touch of burka. The theme looks stupid on these women anyhow. The only reason they are wearing these items is that they're paid to! lol
@SenBlumenthal Problem of our "deep state elitists" statement "no on is above the law except them" because they wrote inclusions to afford diversionary tactics to go fishing in people's lives using a false premise to initiate the probe. Compel the original intent to be adhered to. They R bad!
@FoxNews @SteveScalise We have "deep state elitists" who expose themselves by believing their position is above the Congress &amp; Presidency. We have news for these scoundrels, "You will be punished &amp; probably removed.
@KatyCatt80 @jes_chastain So what?
@LukasMikelionis - we need a new Homestead Act giving 7.5 acres to Americans to build homes on instead of being homeless.

@US_Secy_State Can't you read the writing on the wall with the Turkey-USA alliance? They are removing all of their gold from the USA! Ottoman Empire 2.0 is in progress while the USA sits on its ass doing nothing. Terminate the USA-NATO alliance with Turkey!

@thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump They are hiding Islamic intrusions into the Democratic Party. These people have taken over the hierarchy cloaking themselves as a minority installing values that aren't American. ie: political violence
@realDonaldTrump Providing this man a pardon would be an honorable action!
@VP silly but good jab at communism.
@US_Secy_State Achieve peaceful unification &amp; non-nuclear Korea requires the most basic of the laws from each Korea to be the unification laws. Communist Party afforded as political party with the S. Korean parties. Communists may be the majority of the minority parties &amp; win election? Wrong?
@US_Secy_State I will have to concur with your assessment. Thank you.
@US_Secy_State Yes, they do! From a neutral perspective looking at both sides creates a natural conclusion of what is an erroneous assessment and what is beneficially proper researching both sides of a political issue and its intent to abuse, use, or enlighten.
@US_Secy_State @DailyCaller An example of my help -at your request - is I wrote WW3 The Night the Angel's Cry about the US-Iraqi War &amp; copyrighted it in 2000 - ONE YEAR BEFORE THE WAR! https://t.co/SuucVvdGyq https://t.co/k0MyC6YTc6
@FoxNews @POTUS Congratulations are in order for @US_Secy_State meeting with Kim Jong-un. Pompeo is the man to sit down with the North Korean leader &amp; tell it like it is. Great selection by the President to lead the opening negotiations.
@US_Secy_State @DailyCaller I would surprised you sir! I'd be happy to present you any neutral assessment based upon facts, statistical probability, factual history, or ideological assessments resulting in an unbiased natural conclusion not based upon propaganda that you may request. FREE!
@EmbassyofRussia @OPCW But, it was sanctioned by Saudi Arabia who visited all three nations - UK USA &amp; France immediately before the attack and accusation! The deceit, diversion, and hidden agenda is Saudi - using these allies to accomplish creating a new Sunni nation against the will of the Syrians.
@EmbassyofRussia @KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia @mod_russia @Geostrat_ME @DrMarcusP @Partisangirl @GrahamWP_UK @ValLisitsa @Dpol_un @MauriceSchleepe Saudi MBS visited the UK, USA &amp; France immediately before the spy-Syria chemical accusations - Was this a behind the scenes Saudi request in the furtherance of creating another Sunni controlled nation from secular Syria like what happened in Kosovo? Hidden Diversion &amp; Deceit!
@EmbassyofRussia @SpiezLab @OPCW @mfa_russia @foreignoffice @RussianEmbassy @rusembassynl @Politics1st @DrMarcusP @GrahamWP_UK @NeilClark66 @JohnDelacour Small events in the media created major results! Did anyone note that Saudi MBS met with the UK, USA, &amp; France during this spy &amp; Syria  chemical accusations? Were these nations acting on a Saudi request like in Kosovo to start a conflict? Think deeply!
@nikkihaley She seems like a nice woman &amp; wosh her well. But she married and bore a son whose Presidency's did treason against the USA in a Saudi conspiracy.
@US_Secy_State Reminder: It seems to me pur Fore Fathers required Congressional.permission before attacking another nation, under all circumstances.
@US_Secy_State Sir, in my neutral position on poltical affairs, the Russian Federation has been quite upfront and the veracity of their claims have been based on solid facts &amp; not propaganda. But Turkey is another story.
@US_Secy_State sir, you did an excellent job on publicly condemning Turkey about invading Afrin. Congratulations!
@SecretaryCarson @HUDgov The special task force is always being financed to fund paper pushing lawyers, but we have homeless that need homes. How about a Homestead Act granting 7.5 acre self sustaining homesteads that people can build homes on. Screw the lawyers plundering your funds for a task force.
@SecretaryCarson @hud @TheJusticeDept Talking about housing, when the Homestead Act was created, we had 10 times less Americans. Now, we have no Homestead Act and Homeless. How about reinstating the Act and provide 7.5 acre self sustaining homesteads to make America Great Again?

@realDonaldTrump I am proud  of our military too! We're on the wrong side in this political-religious Islamic war! No American or Christian values afforded. This is a bullshit game perpetrated by our Saudi led CIA - &amp; who believe our military can rule the world - for the Saudis? Think deeply sir
@realDonaldTrump Perfect? Sir we lost 71 out of 105 missiles to an archaic defense system. We didn't wait for the OPCW investigation to start. A news report says Russia is innocent: https://t.co/GD1MG4JlYU - Are your people fabricating events to meet their needs to support Saudi foreign policy?
@nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, as an American I'm not sure about this convoluted propaganda that we or the Russians are disseminating, questioning the veracity of both! https://t.co/GD1MG4JlYU - How do you account for this report &amp; why didn't we wait until after OPCW investigated?

@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @senrobportman @amyklobuchar @RepAnnWagner @SenBlumenthal @CovenantHouse @MissingKids @GOPLeader @RepMimiWalters Have the government pay their bills and feed their kids before telling us how wonderful these new extremist laws are.
@StateDept @POTUS In 200 years of law making - making us Americans believe this or that law will cure all - is pure deep state elitist police state propaganda bullshit. Its time to stop globalist domination of our gov!
@POTUS - you have opened Pandora's box in this fraudulent attack on Syria. Sir, expect to see a Russian  FOAB video soon! Putin is no chicken shit sir! Defending Sunni fanatics is insane. Words of Wisdom!
@New23456789 @arabnews Ah but they do apply Christian values in everything. That is what American values are based on.
@RusEmbUSA Russia will detonate 1 or 2 FOAB's near US-Coalition troops so that with their own eyes but from a safe distance - realize a reality check before them &amp; deter further military escalation. This is the only possible pre-designed option available.
@timkaine I concur - bad decision for USA to ally itself with the Sunni ideology in a political-religious war against secular Syria that defends Christians. We forget it was the Sunni ideology that attacked on 09/11 and genocide in Balkans Armenia WW1 - 8 million Christians dead.
@KremlinRussia_E Sir, I wouldn't trust Erdogan regarding any alliance with the Russian Federation. To do so, is like having a prostitute as a wife - telling you that she's faithful but is going out with the girls on Friday &amp; Saturday night to watch football. She comes home with a gold necklace.
@KremlinRussia_E It may be a very wise decision to detonate a couple FOAB's near US military sites in Syria to deescalate the USA-Coalition missile attack as a strong warning of more to come. This warning would save lives &amp; provide a reality check.
@DeptofDefense @thejointstaff This is our America's greatest mistake in our history allying ourselves with the Sunni ideology in a political-religious war against a secular Syria that protects Christians. May God protect America from an angry Russia who should be our ally through Christ.
@DeptofDefense @thejointstaff Update Syrian forces missile defense is active and has intercepted 20 USA-Coalition missiles. US missile destroys apt complex.

@NBCNews Photos of Russian/Syrian missiles shooting down USA coalition missiles over Damascus. ISIS using missile strike to attack southern Damascus. Russia expected to use FOAB's and counter strike source of coalition missiles.
@NBCNews This is most probably the worst possible decision America has made in its entire history to ally itself with the Sunni ideology in a political-religious war against secular Syria that protects Christians. The Russian Federation may very well resort to FOAB's  and other defenses
@US_Secy_State This is the worst possible decision our nation has ever made regarding Islamic political-religious wars involving a secular Syria that protects Christian values. We must thank the Saudi infiltration into our government. Pray that Russia doesn't respond with FOAB's.
@US_Secy_State This may very well go down in American history as the greatest political mistake ever made - allying ourselves with the Sunni ideology in a religious-political Islamic war - against a secular Syria. And by doing so, losing Russia as a natural ally!
@VP This may very well do down in American history as the greatest political mistake ever made - allying ourselves with the Sunni ideology in a religious-political Islamic war - against a secular Syria. And by doing so, losing Russia as a natural ally!

@New23456789 @arabnews Sir, globalist mainstream media saturates the news that the USA is not a Christian value nation, but contrary to their interpretation of our government's creation, it is a Christian value nation "ordained by declaration under the Holy Trinity" Treaty of Paris 1783.
@mrbromwich @realDonaldTrump - Just an American here, sick &amp; tired of hearing FBI whining, that made me realize the FBI people are the deep state elitists &amp; are dangerous to our nation's freedoms. FBI needs to be dismantled, restructured &amp; restored.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Bring back jobs? What do people need FIRST? Ans. HOUSING. Problem: 10 x larger population + no Homestead Act = Homeless. Solution: New Homestead Act for 7,5 acres to sustain Americans &amp; let them build their own homes &amp; get off the streets.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You just made the WORST deal with China on auto parts! China is CONVERTING all gas guzzling cars to ELECTRIC CARS for 1.6 billion Chinese by 2025. Our car parts will be worthless. Unless you start new to get in the electric car business. Stupid deal!

@realDonaldTrump Well you would be doing America an honor so you can get on with your business as being President by firing Mr. Mueller and Rosenstein - The American public are sick of the deep state diversion - it's not Russia, but Saudi Arabia meddling in US affairs.
@Oregonian That's what this sheriff gets for dating perverted girlfriends!!!! lol
@realDonaldTrump You might stop all of the anti-Russian threats first - that would be a beginning.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect,  it isn't wise to "brag" about what our missiles might be able to do in this situation. They have very high tech defenses and hypersonic missiles. You'd appear very foolish to the world if they neutralize then entire threat.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, beware of a Russian counter offensive with their FOAB's - Remember a while ago, Putin stated he didn't want to use nukes unless he has too! Don't push him to! American lives matter more than a political-religious Islamic war w/o Christian values!
@StateDept @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Don't believe it was the Syrians or Russians sir - run the investigation - possible air strike against rebel chemical depot or the rebels did it themselves - our side keeps finding chemical depots in rebel held areas. Attack Damascus we may get a FOAB gift on our fleet or troops
@realDonaldTrump Don't be a "sucker" regarding President Xi's remarks on automobile barriers! Why? He has mandated all gasoline cars are to be replaced with electric cars in 'China by 2025 - our cars are to be obsolete - his words mean nothing in the long run. We still LOSE sir.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller, Rosenstein and the entire FBI and CIA has to be dismantled, reorganized and restored from scratch to remove political deep state elitists from its ranks. Mueller should be charged with conspiracy and treason against the US Constitution. What you need to do- IS DO IT!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, without an investigation on the chemical attack, it may very well be the result of the Syrian-Russian air forces destroying rebel stockpiles of chemical weapons. Beware sir of listening to deep state elitists whose ideology is controlled by Saudi Arabia. A war cant be won!
@realDonaldTrump If you really dare attack secular Syria on behalf of the Sunni ideology, there is no doubt in my mind - that you will bring forth Russian Federation wrath - a wrath that in many ways is equal to and superior then our own. Americans will die sir!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, both Sunni &amp; Shiite Islamic ideologies are insane. We should not be involved on taking sides with political-religious Islamic ideologies - as they are our enemies on the premise to replace our American government. Assad is secular protecting Christians
@POTUS Some say fire Rosenstein. May I suggest - disband the FBI all together and recreate it - and while there do the same thing to the CIA - Mueller and deep state lawyers have GOT TO GO - it is not their attack on you - it is their attack on America!
@finkd Do you really believe that phony diversionary Russian probe crap by the "deep state" elitists who are Saudi infiltrated? Remember Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal's outburst degrading Trump? It's not the Russians who infiltrated the US gov, colleges, mainstream media &amp; military.
@AmbJohnBolton Sir, advise Trump - DON'T fire Mueller! ARREST him for criminal misconduct along with any superior issuing the order - treason against the US Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm you. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality!
@US_Secy_State Sir, advise Trump - DON'T fire Mueller! ARREST HIM for criminal misconduct along with any superior issuing order - treason against the US Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm him. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality!
@VP Sir, advise Trump -DON'T fire Mueller! ARREST him for criminal misconduct along with any superior who issued the order - treason against the United States Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm you. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality.
@WhiteHouse Sir, DON'T fire Mueller! ARREST HIM for criminal misconduct along with any superior that signed such an order - treason against the United States Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm you. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, DON'T fire Mueller! ARRESTED him for criminal misconduct along with any superior that signed his order - treason against the United States Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm you. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality!
@POTUS - Sir, DON'T fire Mueller! Have him ARRESTED for criminal misconduct along with any superior that signed such an order - treason against the United States Constitution. These "deep state" elitists are desperate to harm you. Russian diversion was a lie! Wake up to reality!
@SecretaryZinke @POTUS @Interior How about reinstating the Homestead Act and grant 7.5 acre homesteads to Americans? We have 10 times the people with no Homestead Act that made America Great!
@brianklaas Why pick on the people's choice just because he studies history &amp; knows about the Muslim conquests of Europe?
@StateDept @POTUS Make sure "chemical attack" wasnt the result of Russian-Syria attack on rebel facility. With Russian fire power Im having a difficult time believing Assad used chemical weapons. Claims sound like our Saudi infiltrated military-CIA bullshitters.
@RaniaKhalek Trump may very well push Putin to use his FOAB's or surgical nukes and obliterate our troops in Syria. Who's side will Turkey be on then? Advise? Stay out of Islamic political-religeous wars. Let Allah sort it out!
@RaniaKhalek Make sure the chemical attack isnt the result of Russian-Syrian air attack on rebel chemical warehouse. Everyone will pay a price? Beware that your statements dont include Americans sir. The Sunnis are worse than Assad, who peotects Christians.
@realDonaldTrump I understand your emotions, but PROVE that these deaths are the result of Russian-Syrian air attacks on a rebel chemical  compound first. Secondly, Assad protects Christians but Sunnis commit genocide &amp; were terrorists in 09/11. Stay out of war!
@POTUS - its time to bring back the Homestead Act granting 7.5 acre self-sustaing land grants to Americans. Our pop is 10 times greater with 0 homesteads. Make America great again!
@BobbyZ23 @cnni Presidents are not Jesus Christ by anymeans from Jackson to Kennedy to Clinton to Trump, there are always woman scandals but the Presidents remain the same.
@AmbJohnBolton Were you the one who advised Bush to tell Americans to protect themselves by "duck taping" our windows during a nuke attack? Russia hs a 420 sq mi underground city &amp; in St Petersburg alone 5k bomb shelters. It only takes 5-10 nukes to disable a nation sir.
@RuthieRedSox @thebradfordfile Very easy accomplishment! HOMESTEADS! Open up 7.5 acre government homestead grants to Americans. Our pop is 10 times more with 0 homesteads. Make America great by self-sustaining land grants!
@AmbJohnBolton Just remember sir, that with constant  threats of military action and was the only protection a President (Bush) offered Americans was to duck tape our windows. How many bomb shelters does America possess?
@realDonaldTrump - Why on Earth would Syria use chemical weapons on the rebels, when they have Russian Federation aor power backing them up? Are you sure that the cause wasnt a destroyed rebel chemical depot?
@realDonaldTrump Because they are "deep state elitists" that believe they have the power to do what they want, when they want, and how they want - funded by our most prestigious Saudi allies who have infiltrated our government and mainstream news media. Reality Check - arrest them.
@SpoxDHS DHS forgets that the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam murdered thousands of American yet has never been banned from the USA. All of this diversion suugests they infiltrated &amp; control your agency?
@POTUS Are you serious $100 bil against China? Get ready for the Chinese and Russians to dump US Treasury bonds and start buying from South America! Because they don't need the USA anymore to stay economically afloat! Why? Because we are broke with trillions of $ in debt.
@GeraldoRivera Very stupid waste of U.S. taxpayers money. This is a diversion tactic using Mexican Catholics as the results of the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Sect of Islam murdering thousands of Americans in 09/11 - and none of them are banned from the USA. Outrageous!
@EmilyVirginOK Do you remember Sec. Clinton giving Pakistan $6.5 billion to "like is better?" - tell Pres. Trump Oklahoma teachers will like him better for some funding &amp; see what happens! lol
@StefaniaFOX10 So now the parents want this lady to spend the rest of her life in prison on tax payer's money for this crime? No wonder the boy sought out attention from his teacher. His parents are nuts.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, the caravan coming through Mexico is a "protest" and 09/11 wasn't based upon a diversion of Mexican Catholics coming here, it was based upon Saudi Sunni Wahhabi Muslim sect murdering thousands of Americans. Think sir!
@BasedMonitored It seems that if not for the "racist" Forefathers of the United States, you would not have the freedom to call "white" American's "racist - that facts are Americans are "white &amp; black &amp; Asian" because their not racist at all - They're Americans!
@SugarLafever @JuddLegum Naw, he is putting the Saudis first. Russians are just a diversion to avoid Saudi infiltration.
@JuddLegum This is great information but diversionary &amp; deceptively avoiding just exactly who have the Saudis contacted, financed, infiltrayed &amp; controlling our mainstream media, coleges, military, CIA, and officials?
@realDonaldTrump Sir, as your supporter, Mexicans &amp; the Wall do nothing against the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect - they aren't even banned from the USA - for 09/11 terrorist attack. Why the diversion sir?
@RusEmbUSA @GK_Seattle @Russia Until there is actual evidence I believe the USA expulsion is wrong!
@RonnyJacksonMD You know what veterans are subject to once they leave the service - later in life disabled, hard to secure benefits, medical treatment - make VA accessible. US disabled Veterans in Philippines cant use the VA hospital yet they send Vets from Guam to the Philippines for treatment?
@RonnyJacksonMD Congratulations on your appointment to the VA! Maybe now disabled veterans will be able to get Medical treatment at the Manila Philippines VA hospital.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent choice!
@BasedMonitored Nuts
@US_Secy_State It is not paranoia sir. Historical analysis of the Sunni Turkish government  will clearly bring violence against U.S. military personnel &amp; region conflict in the future. They are no more our ally than the Saudis are - neither would defend the United States in any future threat.
@Patriot_Drew They are not liberals. They are a minority-Islamic coalition that doesnt assimilate using our freedom to destroy us.
@realDonaldTrump Great, but just remember when flaunting all of this firepower, that Russia, China and others have thousands of bomb shelters for their people. All we have is duck tape to seal our windows! Its not how powerful are we, but how powerful are they!
@US_Secy_State USA has got to stop the negative never ending sadist &amp; belligerent degrading &amp; confrontational approach in the world or q day - we are going to get our asses nuked. We are not as big as we appear. How many bomb shelters in USA compared to Russia or China? NONE? Reality check!
@US_Secy_State Give me a break - I'm American too! We have been provoking the Russians over &amp; over again while they try to be our allies. We pushed them towards China. You know damn well our CIA &amp; military industrial complex has been infiltrated by the Saudis. Get rid of them!
@BobbyZ23 @cnni I don't think so at all. From what I observe, Trump woke up with a hangover saw a skank laying next to him &amp; paid her to shush. She went through the money, got fat, out of a job &amp; the anti-Trump morons want to pay her more - so she whines. I see blackmail and extortion charges!
@jdolan2020 Find out how many of our government officials, mainstream media, and colleges receive donations, funding, 3rd party monies and outright Saudi and Middle East money - then charge the bastards with treason!,
@RT_com If this lady represents me and 325 million other Americans then she needs to stop talking bullshite and demand evidence before opening her mouth!
@US_Secy_State  Is it true that the Russian Federation is going to close the entire U.S. Embassy in Moscow?
@SenateGOP  Is it true that the Russian Federation is going to close the entire U.S. Embassy in Moscow?
@dscc  Is it true that the Russian Federation is going to close the entire U.S. Embassy in Moscow?

@POTUS Is it true that the Russian Federation is going to close the entire U.S. Embassy in Moscow?

@realDonaldTrump We don't need a wall to keep criminal Catholic Mexicans out. BAN the Saudi Sunni Wahhabi sect of Islam that murdered more Americans than the Japs did at Pearl Harbor - while Bush paid under the table to attack the wrong country of Iraq to divert liability. Reality Check sir!
@realDonaldTrump IMBRA and related laws are victimizing Americans - while the real intent of IMBRA is to allow wives of jihadists into  the USA as immigrants while cloaking this admitting them under denying Americans right to sponsor - read it carefully - BAD LAW!
@realDonaldTrump Sec Donald Rumsfeld stated trillions of dollars were unaccounted for via our military - before funding our military - who about an audit to find out who is plundering our national treasury in the US military? Like you, I'm for a strong military - but something is not right.
@POTUS The United States needs to bring back free "homesteads" for Americans. US pop 34 mil in 1862 at time of Homestead Act. 2018  325 mil - 18 mil vacant homes. It is time to get the homeless off the street and back on their  with a 7.5 acre homestead grant.

@10DowningStreet @theresa_may I think you are "jumping the gun" on your Russian accusations before a chemical analysis regarding the source is established. Inside information - investigate Saudi intelligence for possible involvement.
@jdolan2020 I don't understand the question or what it is leading to?
@BasedMonitored The boy's parents should be punished for not teaching their son how to fight back physically that the moment someone "touches" him - and kick their asses the best he can!
@USAFCENT @usairforce @GenDaveGoldfein @CENTCOM @CJTFOIR Iraq is no more an ally or would defend America in any future conflict than some farm animal out eating grass in a pasture. We waste our time and resources as the nation turned to its Shiite ally Iran - which should have been expected the moment Saddam was removed.
@USAFCENT I pray that our top Air Force commanders realize "America First" means that we trust no one with respect to alliances, as they never last forever &amp; the day comes that nations are not our friends is after they already plundered what they could get from us.
@USAFCENT As an American, please enlighten me on the probability of either Turkey, Qatar or Saudi Arabia "defending" America in a future conflict? How about ZERO %? We need to stay out of Islamic wars that have no USA values involved and remove Saudi infiltration out of our gov. DOOMED!
