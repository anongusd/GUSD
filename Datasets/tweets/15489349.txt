@hodgetwins She must've smoked the REALLY good shit.
@THNCalifornia I'm for legalization, but this isn't the most impressive group you could have come up with.  lol
@HerbsforFreedom I was 20, and it was recommended to me by a doctor. I'd never even seen it before then.
@DrewFromTV Not a commie, just uninformed. It is legal for the cabinet, VP, and speaker to remove the Prez, not members of the deep state.
@markpannebecker @revperme3 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Yes it does. It says that every person is a sinner.
@joncoopertweets You're a self-hating, homophobic gay man using the most disgusting of smears against people you don't agree with.  Go away.
@USAttyStuart I hope when cannabis is legalized at the federal level that you will lose your job, which you seem to think consists of making up laws that don't exist.

@Davidlaz The more "liberally educated" you are?  There is more than one type of education, you know.
RT @hale_razor: Of course, SNL could’ve avoided this mock-the-disabled-vet debacle if it had a single conservative on staff, but that would…
I wonder how long it will be until the #Democrats have dead celebrities endorsing them.
@TuckerCarlson Big fan here, but you're wrong on cannabis. Get educated.
@MadamSecretary Please tell me the partisan preaching is over.
@MsPackyetti You're such an idiot.  Thanks for the laughs.

Illegal alien! Illegal alien! Illegal alien! Illegal alien!
@IngrahamAngle Cannabis legalization is NOT a partisan issue.  People from both parties support it.
@Sen_JoeManchin I'm a constituent who will base his vote in Nov in the Senate race on how you vote for Kavanaugh. Confirm!

@nbcsnl Your all anti-Trump, all the time format is making your show unwatchable. I understand why you did it right after the election, but it has become tired and unfunny now.
@RoyalFamily Shame on you if President Trump is not invited to the Royal Wedding. I can assure you at least half of the U.S. will feel insulted if he's not.
To be clear...I love Trump. I love God. I love the Republican Party.  That is all.
How big of an idiot do you have to be to oppose the lowering of your taxes? I have a feeling @chelseahandler could tell us. She has the time these days to think about the answer.
Now that Twitter is banning accounts for hate speech--oh wait--that's only hate speech directed at conservatives they're banning.

@katyperry Leading the way to what, exactly? What do protesters actually want? Seems to me all they're doing is having a hissy fit.
I wondered if SNL could be funny with the cast depressed over Hillary's loss. The answer is a resounding "NO".
Now the election's over, Twitter can return to comedians' shameless (and constant) self-promotion.
@cher You still haven't answered my question about which moving company you're planning to use.
@IngrahamAngle I say screw the NeverTrumpers. Why reward disloyalty to the party?
@ericowensdc @DailyCaller Is that a promise?
@chelseahandler Or perhaps maybe-just maybe--women are capable of independent thought. I know that must upset you.
To all those protesters out there, I would like to say: Na na. Na na. Na na. #nevertrumper #TrumpBeatHerAss #Hillary2016

@SassyMamainLA Oh get over yourself.  You lost...someone had to.
@31415inthesky @SassyMamainLA Calling people racist is a big reason Trump became so popular.  Call it karma.
@kristinnw @tarasview Apparently you haven't figured out that name-calling is a big reason Trump was so popular. It's called karma.
@cher Which moving company are you planning to use?
@SethMacFarlane Get used to it. Whoo hooo! The people are winning!

Why is it ppl like @ConanOBrien don't understand how offensive it is 2 viewers that they don't think we see it when they advocate politics?
I was a very vocal and loyal member of @TeamCoco until Conan decided to stab us in the back w/ his 1-sided politics.
Many of us stuck by @ConanOBrien in his darkest hour, only to have him betray us with 1-sided politics. What a douchebag.
I haven't watched 1 sec of Leno since he screwed over @ConanOBrien, but because of Conan's 1-sided politics I will be watching Leno til Nov
@ConanOBrien will no doubt B seeing a significant ratings drop because people like me are tired of 1-sided politics intended to sway opinion

@ItsTheXfactor @EvaLongoria Disagreeing with someone does not equal "hating" them. Perfect example of why I don't want politics from celebs.
@Fool_4_Twitt_r @EvaLongoria Don't want to hear from GOP celebs either. Host a fundraiser or something, but don't politicize entertainment.
@Fool_4_Twitt_r @EvaLongoria Clint Eastwood is a former elected official, although I think his convention speech was also an abuse.
Dear @AmericanIdol, no matter how many fake controversies you create,I will not be watching as long as that trash @NickiMinaj is on the show
@SarahKSilverman used to be really funny. Now she's just pathetic. This is what happens when celebs decide to get political.
I never saw Demi Lovato's TV show, but thanks to #XFactor I have become a big fan of her personality.
@EvaLongoria If you want to promote political causes on Twitter, log on under an assumed name instead of abusing your access to mass media.

@AnnDRomney If you have any pull w/the campaign, please tell them to send me the e-mails I've signed up for FOUR TIMES now, please.
If the @MittRomney campaign isn't sending e-mails to people like me (who signed up for them), I don't hold much hope for him in November.
What is going on at @MittRomney headquarters? I have signed up for their e-mails (on their website) 4 times now, but I have yet to get any.

@ghostinmarble @jimmyfallon It amazes me you would try to make this a partisan thing.  I would feel no differently if it had been Hillary.
I can't believe @JimmyFallon won't even apologize for treating a female guest that way. He now has one less fan.  #JimmyFallonSucks

I've loved Lady Gaga, but she just posted something about "The Beast" and "666" on FB that makes me very uncomfortable.
@SethMacFarlane Are you saying that cartoonists are currently in charge of morality?  God help us all.
Has anyone ever done a poll on who the best celebrity Twitterer is?
Is it possible the reason Obama won't release his birth certificate because his mother put "white" under race-and that would hurt w/ base?
@elliottyamin  Sometimes I forget how young you are.  :)
@lisalampanelli   YES YOU SHOULD!  You're "bigger" than they are with access to mass media they don't have. That makes it an unfair fight.
Watching @lisalampanelli take on everyday people makes me sad.  It's a form of bullying.  I wish Lisa would make me laugh instead.

Apparently Obama didn't learn anything from Clinton's first term--if you get beaten badly at the polls you have to work with the opposition
@amyislu No1 claimed majority of abortions are black. If they were, the black race would have disappeared already.http://tinyurl.com/y9zrdvz
Hey @Ralphie_May  Just because you're ignorant of the facts about PP doesn't mean I don't like you or that you aren't funny.
@amyislu  Those statistics SUPPORT my argument.  lol.  Read again and pay attention to the "rate per 1000".
@Ralphie_May  "shut your piehole"  Apparently someone doesn't like losing an argument because he doesn't know the facts...
@amaticrodriguez   Adam, PP is a racist organization, founded to eliminate blacks after Civil War. http://www.blackgenocide.org/planned.html
@Ralphie_May  I'm not mad because you disagree, I'm disappointed you don't know all the facts.
@Ralphie_May  Black women who get an abortion are 4.7 times more likely to get breast cancer.  Source: 1993 Howard Univ study.
@Ralphie_May  Thanks to abortion industry, blacks are the only minority whose population is in decline. 5x more likely to get 1 than whites.
@Ralphie_May Birth control, cancer screenings...these are all things done by other (just as capable) orgs that don't perform abortions.
@Ralphie_May  78% of Planned Parenthood's clinics are STILL located in predominantly minority neighborhoods.
@Ralphie_May  Quote from Margaret Sanger (Planned Parenthood's founder):  "Colored people are like human weeds and are to be exterminated."
@Ralphie_May  Are you even aware of the founding purpose of Planned Parenthood and how it is still working (successfully) toward that goal?
Wow @Ralphie_May!  You're not even trying to hide your racism.  I'm disappointed u think that way. http://www.blackgenocide.org/planned.html
Sorry @Ralphie_May but I don't want my tax dollars going toward a racist organization:  http://www.blackgenocide.org/

@kathygriffin @tiffanyrinehart @omfgitsjulie55  Tonight's drinking game is:  Take a shot every time Kathy says something that's not funny.
@kathygriffin Remember when people would think "Joan Rivers" when someone said "old comedienne with too much plastic surgery"...
@kathygriffin  Anderson, your show routinely ranks last among cable news programs.  Do you like being the bottom?
@kathygriffin Anderson, for your midnight kiss, I'm giving you a choice between Cloris Leachman (sans makeup) and this Chippendales dancer.
@kathygriffin Anderson, the only way Kathy Griffin will b funny 2night is if u have Bristol Palin sitting just off-camera with a squirt gun.
@kathygriffin  Anderson, I dare you to turn to Kathy and tell her (live on air) that you're a registered Republican.  Do it!
@kathygriffin  Anderson, will you please explain to Kathy the difference between "mean" and "funny"?
@kathygriffin  Anderson, did you know if you became Kathy Griffin's sperm donor, she would give birth to Perez Hilton?
@kathygriffin  Anderson, now that "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" has been repealed, I have a question for you.....
@kathygriffin Anderson, tell us what you REALLY think of Kathy Griffin in a bikini?
@KathyGriffin  Anderson, which of the following will the most out of fashion in 2011--Gloria Vanderbilt jeans or Kathy Griffin?
@RyanSeacrest  I was gonna watch ur show 2night until I heard you were having on that witch who takes advantage of desperate parents.  Boo!
@kathygriffin Anderson, which of the following will be the most out of fashion in 2011--Gloria Vanderbilt jeans or Kathy Griffin?
@kathygriffin   Anderson, I'm not sure doing a live broadcast with an overdone drag queen is the best way to come out of the closet.
@kathygriffin  Anderson, as a journalist aren't you worried about being seen standing next to yesterday's news?
@kathygriffin    Anderson, what's it like to stand next to someone who once was funny and shocking but now is totally irrelevant?
Shame on @justinbieber for working with @ChrisBrown!  Responsible parents won't excuse Brown's behavior by letting their children listen.

@866ourvote Note in voter book "do not allow to use machine or sign voter book".  Longtime voter at this address #43215 #EPOH #votereport
I voted for McCain, but don't know if it will be counted thanks to a "do not allow to vote" message next to my name in the voter book
It's not against federal law to reward people for voting.  It is, however, against some state laws (but not in Ohio)
@RealJustinLong I suspect the fact I voted in the GOP primary has smething to do with why my ballot is suddenly a problem for the first time
@RealJustinLong No, it's not.  I've voted at my precinct for three years.  Why would they suddenly mark me as "do not allow to vote or sign"
I am very concerned my vote won't be counted.  Where is the local Columbus media?
