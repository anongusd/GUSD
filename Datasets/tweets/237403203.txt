ICYMI: I had quite a few things to say about today's #KavanaughConfirmation hearing: https://t.co/o91ao1Q9CN #tcot #Kavanaugh
In all of this, the seminal point must be: what is holding up the confirmation vote? They should vote in committee immediately, and, this weekend, in full Senate. https://t.co/o91ao1Q9CN #tcot #KavanaughConfirmation
How many of Dr. Ford’s family/friends were there behind her? This has been appalling &amp; left shld be ashamed, but that wld require honor, integrity, or character. Left is deranged, delusional &amp; demented. To do this to an honorable man will not be forgotten &amp; will not go unpunished
“OK folks, here’s the deal: Judge #BrettKavanaugh is emotional, therefore, in the definition of progressive socialists, he is credible. The key point is that he presented facts and evidence to accusations and allegations that had none. #tcot #KavanaughConfirmation
Oh boy, looks like Judge #BrettKavanaugh ate his Wheaties today, and is bringing it against the hate-filled Democrat (Socialist) Party. He needs to counsel the GOP on getting a spine! #tcot #KavanaughConfirmation
Dr. Ford can emotionally compel us all day long, the issue is whether or not she’s credibly accusing Judge Kavanaugh. Democrats always want to stress feelings. . . Are we really going to condemn someone based upon feelings? 2/2 #Kavanaugh #KavanaughConfirmation #tcot
All the media hacks keep asking the same question, is Dr. Ford a credible witness? What does that mean? The point is that her accusations and allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are not credible. 1/2 #Kavanaugh #KavanaughConfurmation
Again, this is not federal jurisdiction, as they have done 6 extensive background investigations into Judge Kavanaugh. It’s obvious the left wants stalling &amp; delay. @SenKamalaHarris isn’t #KarenMonahan also a profile in courage &amp; an American Patriot? 2/2 #KavanaughConfirmation
.@SenKamalaHarris says Dr. Ford is not on trial, the inference is that Judge #BrettKavanaugh is? I thought this was a hearing &amp; not a judicial proceeding. Sen. Harris would you believe an allegation without any evidence &amp; polygraphs are not admissible? 1/2 #KavanaughConfurmation

They deserve armed protection, but org advocating for 5M+ law abiding legal gun owners has blood on its hands? We don't deserve the constitutional right that shall not be infringed? C'mon, y'all sure you REALLY wanna show up in Dallas &amp; confirm the fact you're truly that stupid?
Here's the other delusional hypocrisy, &amp; I invite these jackasses to an open debate: how many of them walk around shielded &amp; protected by armed guards? Think about it, how many armed security personnel were there at the most recent Academy Awards (which sucked, by the way)? /more
Oh yeah, that's right, those unelected jurists decided that a woman has a right to kill and dismember an unborn child. But me, having a right to own a firearm -- a constitutional right forged on April 19, 1775 at Lexington Green and Concord Bridge -- nope. #tcot #bcot /more
How many of these entertainment elites write checks to Planned Parenthood, oops, that's right, they don't have to since Planned Parenthood lobbies Congress to give them $568.7M/yr of taxpayer funds. That's what I call "blood money." But, nothing to say about Planned Parenthood?
How is it that these not-very-astute folks are taking issue w/an organization that has historically defended a Constitutional right but say nothing of an organization founded by a white supremacist and racist that kills unborn babies everyday, by the hundreds? #tcot /more
Oh boy, I cannot wait for these chuckleheads to come to Dallas. Maybe I can debate every single one of these misguided individuals. Yeah, me against all seven of them are still very favorable odds -- in my favor of course. https://t.co/xz4GODIFIk #tcot #NRA #2A /more

One thing for certain, our combined military forces comported themselves with impeccable professionalism, as they always do. All they wanted was a Commander-in-Chief who would give them rules of engagement that enables them to thump the enemy.		Stay tuned. #SyriaStrikes #tcot
The last thing we need to see is a failed state under the control of multiple Islamic jihadist organizations. And that does include a resurgent Islamic State along with Hezbollah and the Al Nusra Front. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
However, someone needs to consider this: what happens if Assad were to depart, leave Syria, on his own accord, eventually, which he would if he did not have external support. This coalition needs to consider that transfer of power, and to whom. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
We continue to build the international coalition and case against Assad and #Syria, we do not need United Nations permission. And, we let Russia, Iran, and Assad know that we can, and will, pull the trigger again. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Where do we go from here? We must keep the pressure on Syria. We must use other means of national power, economic sanctions, to isolate #Syria frm Russia &amp; Iran. Next month, we need to decertify the Iranian nuclear agreement &amp; reinstate economic sanctions against them. /more
To hear the MSM prognosticate about Trump's affinity for Russia/Putin is delusional. Any objective head-to-head comparison of Obama &amp; Trump on the issue of Russia would lead one to a simple conclusion: more collusion, appeasement, &amp; acquiescence was given to Russia by Obama /more
Just remember, this is what Barack Obama did not do. Recall that it was Obama and John Kerry who deferred to Vladimir Putin and trusted him — reset, more flexibility, you get it. #SyriaStrike #tcot /more
This, all those folks who ranted on about creating a broader conflagration were wrong, this was a very well executed, targeted, and precise strike against Assad's chemical weapons production capability. And yes, we can always go back for more of that capability. #tcot /more
Now, could something happen in the future? Only if we had credible intelligence that Russia and Iran were directly supporting and engaging in the delivery of chemical weapons against innocent civilians. #SyriaStrikes  #tcot /more
.@realDonaldTrump, through his advisers, made the conscious decision to go after the chemical weapons facilities, the center of gravity, and not risk the collateral damage of killing Russians or Iranians. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Sure, we could have gone after Assad's airfields and delivery means, meaning his aviation assets, well, guess what’s also there? Yes, you got it, Russian and Iranian military assets and personnel. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Utterly laughable to the highest degree...and as I heard someone say, if it were not for double standards, the left would have no standards at all. #tcot /more
Now, how very perplexing to hear the leftist media all crowing, someone sent out the dog whistle, about @realDonaldTrump not having a strategy. You mean to tell me that #Obama had a strategy to engage the Islamic State? Or even Afghanistan? #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
.@POTUS acted w/in his Constitutional power. If a longterm military op for #Syria, then yes, @realDonaldTrump would need to go to Congress. The War Powers Act provides the Commander-in-Chief an ability to conduct limited scope military ops, but nothing sustained. #tcot /more
However, lest they forget, after Obama's infamous "red line" assertion, that approval was challenged, #Obama dithered, and did indeed turn to Congress, and nothing was done. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
The leftist media had very little to say about Obama's "outsourcing" of our military to Islamic jihadists in Libya. There were those progressive socialists in the Democrat party who stated that President Trump needed to go to Congress to get approval, good luck with that. /more
What I found quite interesting this weekend was the response from the usual suspects: the liberal progressive media. The notion that @POTUS did not have the Article II Constitutional enumerated powers to conduct this strike operation as Commander-in-Chief is absurd. #SyriaStrikes
What has changed is that we have a presidential administration that is exhibiting strength, resolve, and firmness, and that is a cherished quality sorely missing during the #Obama administration who embraced the concept of "leading from behind." #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
However, no foreign policy is valid without a credible military deterrent, and that is what we saw this past weekend. #SyriaStrikes #tcot  /more
What should happen is an isolation of Assad, and cut off the resources he depends upon from Russia and Iran. That is more of a financial and economic measure, rather than a military endeavor. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
It is imperative that we do not embroil ourselves into a civil war action, and certainly the US should not be pursuing an effort to topple Assad...remember Obama's empty rhetoric? #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more https://t.co/zZgtlptPgO
Russia and Iran, and to a wider extent North Korea, have aligned themselves with Bashar al-Assad and Syria. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Lastly, this coalition has Israel, who won’t sit back &amp; willingly allow the expansion of Iran into Syria. I believe that Israel is that tip of the spear when it comes to confronting Iranian incursion into Syria. It appears the Prince of Saudi Arabia has no issue w/that fact /more
Another key ally here is Egypt, and their motivation is not to allow for the border shared with Hamas controlled Gaza to become a transit point for Islamic jihadists and resources. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Saudi Arabia is the "keeper of the grail" in the Islamic world, and they would prefer not to lose their prominence, certainly not to Shiite Iran. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
This is a very important leverage point as these two countries have their respective motivations. Turkey would like to be restored as the dominant Islamic nation, a return to the old "Ottoman Empire." #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia, Sunni Islamic states, do not want to see a hegemonic dominance in the region by the Iranians, and their proxy terrorist army, Hezbollah. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Furthermore, we had cooperation from Turkey — who I do not trust — along with Saudi Arabia. The major reasons why you have Turkish and Saudi Arabian assistance stems from the angst towards Iran. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Also, important to comprehend is that the French provided confirmation of — and certainly corroborated — the employment of the chemical agents in Douma, Syria by the Syrian government. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
First of all, we need to realize how important that was: the fact that this was a combined strike operation and not just a singular American action. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more
Over the weekend we’ve heard the news reports and punditry over the Syrian strike conducted by a combined force of the United States, Great Britain, and France. #SyriaStrikes #tcot /more https://t.co/QC9bwRrDg1

This is that decisive moment, so choose for yourselves today, whom you shall serve. I will not surrender to the tyranny of George Soros, Planned Parenthood, and the progressive socialist left. #ThursdayThoughts #tcot
Will the #GOP stand for liberty, or will they cower, quit, and run away from the present day onslaught of the progressive socialist vision of tyranny? #tcot
The Dem party is the party that, as the British did in April 1775, believe in disarming law abiding legal gun owning Americans, rendering them not citizens, but subjects. So, whydo we have such a level of incompetence of #GOP leadership failing to articulate those points? /more
Dems are the party of supporting criminal illegal immigrants, sanctuary cities/states. The party that rejects notion of American sovereignty. The party of collective subjugation, the party of Antifa, &amp; the party that represents the economic failures of America esp in inner cities
What is it that the modern day Redcoats, the Democrat party, promise for America? Sure, they will lead the effort to impeach the POTUS. They will repeal the tax cut law, something that Nancy Pelosi stated.  #tcot /more
Just as w/a controlled burn bringing forth new growth, this is a decisive moment for the #GOP. As a political party, they've not been effective communicators -- even in the majority -- &amp; find themselves reacting &amp; being pushed around by the progressive socialist left #toct /more
The #GOP hasn't reversed the damages of Dodd-Frank. They just passed the 2nd largest spending measure in US history, resulting in increased debt/deficits for future generations. No reforms to budget process &amp; spending. #tcot /more
If the #GOP wishes to run away at this time, in the end, they will not deserve the love of true American men and women. The GOP leadership, at this time, has not done what was necessary to correct the debacle that is #Obamacare. #tcot /more
I say if the summer soldiers and the sunshine patriots of the #GOP shrink from this moment, so be it, farewell. For there will arise a new generation that will stand and fight for the cause of liberty, and the exceptionalism of our Constitutional Republic. #tcot /more
Those words were written at the request of General George Washington in order to inspire a dejected Continental Army to cross the frozen Delaware River and attack the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton, and later, they would be successful at the Battle of Princeton. #tcot /more
Perhaps this is, as Thomas Paine wrote in Dec 1776, "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."
There are many who are singing the woes and despair of having some 40+ #GOP members resigning from the House of Representatives. They believe that this is that moment that will turn the tide for the Democrats. I see it in a completely different way. #tcot /more
All seemed lost, save for 1 thing: a willing spirit for the cause of liberty in the hands of leaders like Daniel Morgan, Nathanael Greene, Henry Knox, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington. Leadership is abt vision &amp; resolute will to instill that vision &amp; inspire others.
I believe the British also had a similar feeling of being invincible &amp; a sense of inevitable victory over the new American nation. After all, they held the most important city in the north, New York, &amp; Cornwallis had taken the most important city &amp; port in the South, Charleston.
And, this week, we got news Paul Ryan won't seek congressional reelection. Interesting since he was just here in TX &amp; raised ~ $4M. Ryan's announcement was met w/prognostications abt impending blue wave, sweep of House &amp; restoration of Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. #tcot /more
So, we have come to a decisive moment for the #GOP, who appear to be reeling. If you tune into the liberal progressive media, the midterm elections spell doom and gloom for the GOP. #tcot /more
They were reeling frm enormous loss at the Battle of Camden. Brig Gen Morgan strategically used terrain &amp; art of deception to win a resounding victory &amp;  eventually lead to w/drawal of Lord General Cornwallis from the south. He was later trapped at Yorktown, where he surrendered.
The Continental Army and the militia --  led by General Daniel Morgan -- were being pursued by the vicious British commander, Sir Banastre Tarleton. Why was this a decisive moment? Because the southern campaign of the Colonial forces needed a victory. #tcot #history /more
In any battle, there's always a decisive moment. At @ClemsonYAF this week, I reminded the students of such a moment, not far from the campus, near what is today Spartanburg, SC. The date was January 17, 1781, and the moment was the Battle of Cowpens. #tcot /more https://t.co/zcU6IN974b
I’ll be joining @RiskRewardFBN on @FoxBusiness this afternoon. Hope you will tune in! #tcot
Again, a great evening with @ClemsonYAF. For a special treat, go to swing by Memorial Stadium and see Coach Frank Howard’s Rock and gaze into Death Valley. Boy do I miss college football! C-L-E-M-S-O-N Tigers! #tcot https://t.co/pKEKj4dWUB
How many more federal government agencies will be weaponized? And, who is next in this dark Stasi type of secret police politicized system of justice? #tcot #MichaelCohen #MichaelCohenRaid
Yes, we should trust our federal law enforcement agency, the #FBI, but when there are so many blatant and politicized abuses of justice, and violations of our Constitution, namely the Fourth Amendment....trust is a hard pill to swallow. #4A #tcot #MichaelCohen
The liberal progressive left is creating an environment where the #DOJ &amp; #FBI, at the upper echelons, have lost the trust and confidence of the American people. #tcot #MichaelCohen
Heck, why has no one ever conducted a raid of George Soros? I tend to believe funding a domestic terrorist organization,#Antifa, would be worthy of a little visit from the FBI. Matter of fact, why hasn't the FBI raided Antifa? #tcot #MichaelCohen
Doggone, Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress, nothing happened there. And whatever happened with that Fast and Furious scandal that resulted in the death of US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry? Yes, another American died, but no FBI raid over that. #tcot #MichaelCohen
I ask y'all to ponder this, do any of you believe that Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch would unleash their DoJ on Barack Obama? #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmm #tcot #MichaelCohen #CohenRaid
We have all this "collusion" btwn Peter Strzok, Lisa Paige &amp; Bruce Ohr, no FBI raids there. Will we ever know who carried the Fusion GPS dossier to a secret FISA court? Heck, btwn former AG Loretta Lynch &amp; former FBI Director James Comey, who knows the truth? Yet no raids there.
We know it was #IRS employee Lois Lerner who abused her power to target conservative groups and no one raided her house. Oh yeah, she's now receiving a six figure tax payer funded retirement. #tcot #MichaelCohen #CohenRaid #tcot
Barack Obama lied about the Islamic terrorist attack in #Benghazi, along with Hillary Clinton &amp;  others, but there was no raid there...and four Americans died. #MichaelCohen #MichaelCohenRaid #tcot #Benghazi4
Why didn't the FBI raid the homes of Cheryl Mills or Huma Abedin when caught in a web of lies? When did liberal progressives attain a sense of morality? It was their beloved Bill Clinton who abused power sexually over a young intern in the Oval Office as a sitting President.
I can hear leftists ranting abt #MichaelCohen possibly destroying docs. Where was the FBI when #HillaryClinton destroyed computers &amp; hard drives/bleaching databases? Why wasn't there a raid of the Clinton residence w/unauthorized server  transmitting classified info? #CohenRaid
How can it be that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would overly deem it necessary to raid #MichaelCohen's residence and office? It seems rather excessive to me. #tcot #MichaelCohenRaid #FBICohenRaid #FBIRaid #FBI
If we have come to a point where justice is all about trolling to find any and every thing, then our rule of law in American has been degraded into a Stalinist style of politicization. #MichaelCohen #MichaelCohenRaid #tcot #Mueller
I am trying to ascertain how this situation with #MichaelCohen has anything to do with Russian interference in our election or collusion? #tcot #MichaelCohenRaid
Perhaps I am presenting something that is blatantly obvious &amp; rhetorical in nature, but, what does something that allegedly happened ten or so years ago with a porn star have to do with Special Counsel #RobertMueller? #tcot #MichaelCohen #MichaelCohenRaid
How do we protect a Nation &amp; its citizens, when the rule of law &amp; justice has become abjectly politicized? I am referring to the FBI raid of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, #MichaelCohen. #tcot #MichaelCohenRaid	https://t.co/2pdnrlayzf

And there is nothing more fun that seeing the left in a manic meltdown mode! #tcot
The manic response of the liberal progressive media to the changes in the Trump administration national security leadership is once again evidence that the left prefers weakness over resolute, strong, and determined American foreign and national security policy. #tcot /more
Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea, along with the advance of the global Islamic jihad are all part of the residual effects of a failed Obama #foreignpolicy. #tcot /more
Why, certainly, let the wolves guard the hen house, &amp; all will be well. The UN is the home of dictators, despots, &amp; autocrats. The fact that @AmbJohnBolton doesn't defer to the corrupt UN freaks out the collective globalists who find more energy in condemning Israel. #tcot /more
Of course, what the leftists would respond with is that we should trust the global body politic organizations, such as the United Nations, to rectify these issues.  #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more
The repeated chemical weapons attack by Bashar Assad is the fault of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Barack Obama. The left defines peace as doing nothing and allowing the violators of human rights, dictators, despots, and autocrats to run about free #tcot /more
Barack Obama admitted he'd have "more flexibility" after his 2012 reelection to Russian president Medvedev. I just do not hear the media making much ado about that Obama statement. Yet, we have the liberal progressive media in full attack mode against @AmbJohnBolton? #tcot /more
Russia is only a menace when the left can leverage it for their perceived political advantage. It was former Obama Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who gave the Russians a silly toy called a "reset button." #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more
Don't forget that Obama's Secretary of State, John Kerry, told us that the Russians had taken care of the Syrian chemical weapons...blind trust with no verification. It was Barack Obama who lifted sanctions on Iran &amp; provided them billions of dollars in laundered cash #tcot /more
.@AmbJohnBolton spooks the progressive socialist left b/c he doesn't believe in taking crap frm globalists. He believes American strength defuses global conflicts &amp; realizes the perception of American weakness, --  8 years of the Obama admin -- results in what we face today /more
The left finds its strength in going to secret courts before secret judges in order to obrain permission to spy on innocent Americans. But, when it comes to standing up to the real enemies, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria it's all abt "strategic patience &amp; leading from behind.
Decisive action, against declared enemies, evidences the abject weakness &amp; fecklessness of leftists &amp; tthey can't stomach it. The left can find all the courage in the world when it comes to attacking political opposition,  like unleashing the #IRS on the Tea Party. #tcot /more
What the left is all about is talk, bluster, sounding tough, but in the end, doing nothing. What scares the left more than anything are those who will take action, back up rhetoric with decision, courage. #tcot /more
It appears that the left once again has a very bad case of amnesia. Recall, if you will, that it was one Barack Obama who made the infamous assertion about a "red line" if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons. It was also Obama who incessantly stated that "Assad must go."  /more
.@AmbJohnBolton takes over from LTG HR McMaster at a critical time w/a potential meeting w/NoKo leader Kim Jong Un &amp; recent heinous chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Sadly, if you read MSM headlines you'd think Mr. Bolton was the cause of all these global security fault lines.
Well, today was the very first day for new National Security Adviser, @AmbJohnBolton. And, as expected, the liberal progressive media went apoplectic in their dire predictions of doom and gloom. #tcot #ForeignPolicy https://t.co/3JMibJp0hD /more

Memo to the #GOP: We gave you the House, the Senate, and the White House...nothing has changed. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/LV08UkRGlR
Only those who are stuck on stupid wish to see a Speaker Nancy Pelosi or a Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr, you both have been utter disappointments, so you will need to be replaced with principled, resolute Constitutional Conservative fighters.
#GOP: Where is your anger, indignation, resolve? The time for high-brow academic discussions is over: this is an old school brass knuckles fight...and I guess what we need are more Old School Patriots. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
The #GOP is proving, yet again, that they are not willing to fight. At least as we define fighting back against the onslaught from the George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer funded leftist movement. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
#GOP: I, for one — and I believe there are many others — get tired of y'all bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight. We want those who will fight. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
How is it the left can pressure companies to boycott conservative hosts, but, when you have a far left show host that presents the argument that Rep. Steve Scalise's shooting was justified due to his voting record, you say nothing? (That was MSNBCs Joy Reid, FYI). #tcot /more
Municipalities are threatening gun confiscation in America under penalty of enormous fines &amp; we’ve not seen a single Republican speaking out? Have y'all forgotten what happened on April 19, 1775 in America? Are we so weak, and cowardly, to allow this to play out again? #2A #tcot
#GOP: We have the leftists enacting unconstitutional measures against law abiding legal gun owners in America and y'all are saying nothing, nothing! #tcot #2A #DrainTheSwamp  /more
Where’s #GOP leadership when it comes to the Parkland shooting? Instead of being silent &amp; allowing the anti-gun left to dominate the narrative, why aren’t you challenging them? #2A #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
When, as happened this past week, Nancy Pelosi comes out and says the Democrats are going to repeal the tax cuts if they win in November 2018...where was @SpeakerRyan to crush that assertion? #tcot /more
.@GOPLeader should be on every news channel livid that Mayor Schaaf would place the lives of CA citizens in danger. Have we seen him support efforts of OC &amp; others in CA to stand up to Governor Brown &amp; CA AG #JavierBecerra? Why do we not have GOP "leaders" who fight back? /more
Where was @GOPLeader, Kevin McCarthy, of California, when Oakland Mayor Schaaf decided to alert criminal illegal immigrants to an impending #ICE raid? #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
When was the last time you heard #GOP leadership stand up and speak out against criminal #illegalimmigration? Save for Congressman Peter King, I have not heard anyone speaking out against the vicious El Salvadoran gang MS-13. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
That #Omnibus spending bill is the second largest spending measure in US history, only second to Barack Obama. And we thought we were getting reforms to spending in Washington DC? Nah, the GOP-led swamp won again. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
Who actually read that cacophony of wasteful spending, to include $568.7M to an organization founded by a white supremacist and racist, Margaret Sanger's Planned Parenthood? #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
Why do we have a #GOP in the majority on Capitol Hill when they are producing insidious pieces of legislation like the 2018 #Omnibus spending bill that was 2200 pages long? #tcot #DrainTheSwamp /more
Think about it, with all that’s happening in our Nation, where are @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr, @JohnCornyn, @GOPLeader, &amp; @SteveScalise? Heck, there may be many of you who do not even know who these fellas are, but we certainly see plenty of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. /more
I would have loved to have had my own private email server in my quarters while I was a Battalion Commander with classified information being transmitted. #tcot #DrainTheSwamp

If anything, we should collectively be pissed off at China as they believe they can screw over the United States, and we will just take it! It's time to open up a serious can of whoop ass on China, and do as Reagan did with the Soviet Union, crush them. #tcot
#China is betting on our fear. Say what you wish about @realDonaldTrump, he’s the 1st US president to stand up to despots, dictators, and theocrats. It comes down to a very simple choice: stand up to #China, or keep bending over to China. I choose the former...what say you? /more

With all of this, where is the World Trade Organization? Folks are talking about a "trade war," well, wake up and smell the coffee, #China has long since declared an economic war against the United States. #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more
#China has been turning their economic growth into an expansion of their military/maritime capability, and we all know what is happening in the South China Sea and the threats they levy. #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more

Why should we confront China?		Simple.		Explain to me how we can just sit back and allow the Chinese to plunder our intellectual property? #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more https://t.co/9n1obHS1G1
In doing so, #China has now built, &amp; become, the world's second largest economy, &amp; in turn has created such a dependency &amp; desire across the globe that no one has ever had the Reagan-esque resolve to confront them. And why should we confront China? #tcot #ForeignPolicy /more
China saw what happened to the Soviet Union and the lesson learned was simple: to engage the west, they must adopt free-market #economic principles. #tcot #ForeignPolicy #history /more
And as President #Reagan stated when asked how he defined victory against the Soviet Union, well, he answered in that simple Reagan-esque manner, "We win, they lose.” And, so it was. #tcot #ForeignPolicy #history /more https://t.co/bVg8hj8AOw
When President #Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate and sent the very resolute message, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall," he delivered his intent. #tcot #ForeignPolicy #history /more

A true socialist economic model cannot survive, esp competing against a strong free market/free enterprise economy. #RonaldReagan knew as he embarked upon strengthening economy &amp; rebuilding military capability/capacity, the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union would come about.

This country embarked upon a revolution for liberty because of gun confiscation and control. We have come full circle. #tcot #2A
What happens with a law enforcement officer who owns a personal semi-automatic rifle? And ya know, those "high capacity magazines" are soooo dangerous, you know they can load themselves and insert themselves into a magazine well of a firearm. #tcot #2A /more
This is the left, and they are relentless. And, sadly, I fear, we are on the verge of a potential confrontation. #tcot #2A /more
Yet, far away in Deerfield Village, IL, we have law abiding citizens being told they will have their firearms confiscated, or face a massive fine &amp; they've done nothing to deserve such. The weapon they own has done nothing. #tcot #2A /more
Ya know, Sheriff Scott Israel has to be laughing his butt off that he's still in position. Sheriff Deputy Scot Peterson must be rolling on the floor laughing knowing that he has not been charged with dereliction of duty or criminal negligence. #tcot #2A /more
How will Deerfield Village go about enforcing this folly? Will they do as the British did back in April 1775 &amp; dispatch armed columns to go door by door, and violate the #4A addressing illegal search &amp; seizure? #tcot #2A /more
Let me be clear: the left just lost the 2018 midterm election with this one. This tyrannical move cannot be spun in any way to be justified #tcot #2A #Midterms2018 #midterms /more
This new ordinance is a complete violation of the Bill of Rights &amp; the threat to fine legal gun owners $1K/day violates equal protection clause. Who are these people embracing this idea of collective punishment &amp; legalized coercion in order to advance their ideological agenda?
I would think that there needs to be some probable cause presented in order for this ban to be lawful. https://t.co/jVse6LEIip #tcot #2A /more
So, why does a law abiding American gun owner in Deerfield Village find themselves being under "assault" when it was the failure of the FBI &amp; Broward County Sheriff's office, &amp; a specific Sheriff's Deputy, that resulted in the rampage at Stoneman Douglas HS? #tcot #2A /more
There is no such thing as an "assault" weapon: we are talking about semi-automatic rifles. #tcot #2A #NRA /more
Otis McDonald was the vet who wanted to defend himself in his home &amp; took on Chicago's draconian gun laws. McDonald, a black man, had his case affirm that 14th amendment equal protection clause applied to gun ownership. So, what gives in Deerfield Village &amp; Highland Park, IL?
There have been two cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that upheld the Second Amendment at the Federal, State, and Local levels. Those two cases were Heller v. DC (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010). #tcot #2A /more
First of all, I'd find it very interesting if any local municipal attempt to undermine the #2A survives legal confrontation. Either the Bill of Rights is relevant or it's not; therefore, we have a serious constitutional crisis on our hands. https://t.co/jVse6LEIip #tcot /more
Today, the progressive socialist left is leveraging a tragedy in order to advance their gun confiscation agenda. And let's be honest, it is all about gun confiscation. #tcot #2A #NRA /more
Then it was the British marching to confiscate and destroy an armament, a firearms factory. The British did not want to have any armed resistance from the Americans. #tcot #2A /more
What happened on April 19, 1775? Well, that was the day that American patriots met the advancing British column at Lexington Green and at Concord bridge. #tcot #2A /more
I find it very interesting that here we are in April, just days away from the anniversary of April 19, 1775 and we are having a major move towards banning weapons. #tcot #2A /more https://t.co/jVse6LEIip

Doggone, she has caused quite a bit of consternation for the left who are always operating under the maxim of "never let a good crisis go to waste." This one doesn't fit neatly into their designed narrative. Darn. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting
Ms. Nasim Aghdam was not a constitutional #conservative, bitter clinging to their guns and religion right wing extremist. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
Oh yes, the assailant in Southerland Springs was able to acquire a firearm because the US Air Force and federal law enforcement did not enter him into the criminal database, having been issued a bad conduct discharge for conviction of a domestic abuse charge. #tcot #2A /more
I do know that an #NRA member, Stephen Willeford, stopped the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs Texas. #tcot #2A /more
Sadly, you watch and see, somehow the anti-gun left will blame the #NRA. I, along with others, have done a little research, and I have yet to find any mass shooter in recent American history who was an NRA member. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
This all comes back to one person: Ms. Nasim Aghdam. She is personally responsible for her actions. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
I have read reports that said Ms. Aghdam visited a firing range before heading off for her evil &amp; nefarious action. Again, you can't spin this into something being wrong, &amp; we should not hold the law abiding legal owner of the firing range as culpable, or responsible. /more
If Ms. Aghdam didn't have a previous or reported criminal record or noted misconduct, then she was able to undergo a NICS background check, pass it &amp; after her waiting period, acquire a firearm...unless illegally obtained &amp; anyone complicit should be prosecuted. #tcot /more
In the case of Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farouk, they used a straw buyer, which is illegal, and something already on the books. #tcot #2A /more
We need to answer the pertinent questions of how Ms. Aghdam acquired the 9mm handgun, &amp; if she exhibited any previous examples of mental instability that went unreported? After all, her family did report her missing, lo, and behold, she turned up at YouTube headquarters. /more
Once again, as with the case of #MarjoryStonemanDouglas High School, it is an issue of mental instability. #tcot #2a #youtubeshooting /more
What I would like to see the anti-second amendment left finally accept is that the tool, the instrument used, should not be the focus. We need to focus on the individual. #tcot #2a #youtubeshooting /more
Yes, these shootings happened in California, a sanctuary state with some of the most stringent #guncontrol laws in America. #tcot #2a #youtubeshooting /more
We know that the motivation of Tashfeen Malik was Islamic jihadism. We now know that the motivation for Nasim Aghdam was her belief YouTube was censoring her videos. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
Just remember it was previously a woman named Tashfeen Malik who participated in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, along with her husband Syed Farouk.  #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
Ms. Aghdam did not fit the narrative preferred by the anti-gun left, but you can bet that they will spin this to their advantage, somehow. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
Ms. Aghdam used a Smith and Wesson 9mm semi-automatic handgun. So, will the left now declare that this is also an "assault weapon?" #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
And, no, Ms. Aghdam, who ended up taking her own life after wounding three people, did not use a "military-styled weapon of war" -- an AR-15. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
I also sense the left's letdown and disappointment because the shooter was 39 year-old Nasim Aghdam, an Iranian woman, PETA supporter, and  angered at YouTube #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
Something tells me the anti-gun/anti-second amendment progressive socialist left, and their new-found little minions were licking their chops waiting to pounce in the aftermath of another shooting. #tcot #2A #youtubeshooting /more
First and foremost, we #pray that those wounded in the #youtubeshooting will experience full recovery and healing. #tcot #ccot /more
How will the anti-gun left spin the #youtubeshooting? The left has a real conundrum on their hands, &amp; you know this is not what they wanted dropped in their laps. #tcot #2A https://t.co/InkVFSi4TT

The global progressive socialist left is more afraid of strong Nation-States who believe in their own sovereignty. Always remember, the left can only advance their ideological agenda by way of intimidation, coercion, lies, deceit, threats, and last resort, violence. #tcot /more
How odd that Russian aggression, Chinese belligerence and expansionism, North Korean nuclear threats, and Iranian hegemonic dominance and support to islamic terrorism is not what concerns the global progressive socialist left. #tcot /more
We must come to realize that the Resistance movement is not just centered here in America. This is truly a global movement expressing the concerns of the left. They were so close to fundamentally transforming America &amp; now their master plan has been turned on its head #tcot /more
I'm no fan of the recent #Omnibus spending bill. We're going right back down the same path Obama led us down. Hence my assertion progressivism has nothing to do with R or D but rather how one sees the relationship between individual &amp; liberty &amp; the institution of government /more
The economic policies of Obama were rooted in the Marxist principle of wealth redistribution and transfer, domestically and internationally. #tcot /more
We still see Mrs. Clinton traipsing around the world as if her opinions matter. What she's actually doing is trying to heal the hurt of the globalists who can't accept her loss. They can't accept that America is reasserting its role as a strong sovereign Nation. #tcot /more
And the left just knew that things were going to be well, following along the same path, with Hillary Clinton as President. There would be more global policies such as the Paris climate accord, done not by the rules of legislative democracy, but rather executive order #tcot /more
When Obama was asked abt American exceptionalism he responded the idea was  the same as any other nation's exceptionalism. The global lib progressive movement, esp in western Europe, cheered as they had one of their own as President of these United States of America #tcot /more
Never forget the massive throngs who welcomed candidate Obama in Germany &amp; his proclamation that he was a "citizen of the world." #tcot /more
Well, it's official: the global progressive socialist movement is worried. All was well when their boy-king Barack Obama ran things in the US. Obama was a true globalist embracing the concept of surrendering American sovereignty to global body politic orgs https://t.co/6dDkVr3DGw

Progressive socialists &amp; Islamic-fascists are driven by two great similarities: their intolerance of anything that’s not consistent with their beliefs, &amp; their hypocrisy. And that, folks, is non-debatable. #tcot
Look at what Obama &amp; the left did to the #TeaParty. Yes, they unleashed the power of the federal government against them, via the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). And still to this day, not a doggone person has been held responsible, or accountable. #tcot /more
I ask you a simple question: do you really want to see the progressive socialist left attain power in America...again? If they do, realize that anything that offends them, basically anything in opposition to their ideological agenda, is targeted for destruction. #tcot /more
As a Christian Constitutional Conservative I have little chance of delivering a speech at UC Berkeley or Cairo University, yet, Barack Obama spoke at the latter. At that speech he insisted members of the Muslim Brotherhood be seated front &amp; center. Quite telling wouldn't you say?
Another means of similarity between progressive socialists and islamo-fascists is, well, fascism. Neither of those two groups desire any opposition voice to be heard #tcot /more
So, when will the left start tearing down statues of West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard? Nah, that's the fella who was praised by Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with Barack Obama upon his death. #tcot /more
Quite fitting that "Ms. Deplorables," Hillary Clinton, was given PP's Margaret Sanger award. The left is offended by folks who were proponents of "settler colonialism" but those who are proponents of killing innocent unborn babies &amp; selling their body parts are just fine /more
Now, you know what's funny: Margaret Sanger was a white supremacist, racist, &amp; spoke at  KKK rallies. We just again gave ~ $568.7M to the org she founded. Sanger isn't offensive to the progressive socialist left, even if she did refer to blacks as "weeds" &amp; "undesirables" /more https://t.co/BCthYaGaCo
Hmm, if the good folks in Arcata, CA are blaming President McKinley as a proponent of rape, what does the left think of Bill Clinton? Ahh, that's right, he does not offend the liberal progressive left. #tcot /more
Therefore, the progressive socialist left would have us remake Mount Rushmore with FDR, LBJ, Bill Clinton, &amp; Barack Obama. #tcot /more
And, Theodore Roosevelt, well, of course they will say he was an imperialist American who hated brown people. #tcot #bcot /more
You know, Washington and Jefferson owned slaves. Lincoln was the first Republican president...and he ended slavery -- can't allow folks to remember that the Democrats voted against ending slavery. #tcot #bcot #BlackTwitter /more https://t.co/nfPCFOqKNO
Consider the recent wave of statue removals related to the Confederacy. So, just wait, if the left ever regains power in America, can we expect the figures on Mount Rushmore to be destroyed -- perhaps they will consult with the Taliban on how best to do it? #tcot /more
All this was because there is no other belief than that of islamic totalitarianism -- all else is sinful &amp; must not be tolerated. So it is for those who refuse to subjugate themselves to progressive socialism, ya know, those oh so tolerant leftists #tcot /more
We've witnessed the Taliban's destruction of Buddhist statues in the Bamiyan province, and the rampage of the Islamic State to destroy historical artifacts in Palmyra Syria and Christian heritage sites in Iraq. #tcot /more
The great similarity of the progressive socialist left and islamo-fascists is that they both embrace revisionist history by way of eliminating any philosophical discourse with which they disagree. #tcot /more

This week, #China and #NorthKorea showed that they are concerned about a muscular America...and it is about time! #tcot
https://t.co/NYwogeGwHw
#China and #NorthKorea are nervous about the new Sheriff in town, and so is the left in America. The liberal progressive leftists are ashamed of American strength, resolve, commitment, and courage. #tcot
#KimJongUn is an unstable individual &amp; the MAD Theory (Mutually Assured Destruction) that existed with the old Soviet Union is invalid with #NorthKorea, or the Ayatollahs of Iran. Another of Barack Obama's foreign policy blunders. #tcot
Former Obama national security adviser, and now Netflix star, Susan Rice wrote in the NY Times that we needed to learn to live with a nuclear #NorthKorea . . . typical. #tcot
We should now turn to the United Nations and pressure them to sanction China, and remove China from the UN Security Council. They can no longer sit on this council knowing that they openly embrace and support a brutal dictatorship. #tcot
#China has aligned itself with a #NorthKorea that illegally arrested, charged, tried, convicted, tortured, and murdered an American citizen, Otto Warmbier.
What needs to happen now is that more economic pressures should be lined up against #NoKo, and #China. As well, since Xi Jinping has decided to formally align himself with a brutal dictator who starves and murders his own people, he should feel the consequences. #tcot
https://t.co/GZ1R0CiFpq
China is realizing that there's a new Sheriff in town who won't lay down &amp; take theft of our intellectual property, cyber attacks, trade imbalance, &amp; military expansions into international/sovereign seas. For years China kept #NoKo at arms length but now both feel the pressure.
This visit by #KimJongUn was not some brilliant strategic move, it was Dad telling the wayward son, 'do not screw this up.' As well, it's Dad telling the son, 'who gave you permission to do this?' #tcot
I see it completely differently, as anyone with common sense does: there is a new Sheriff in town. Under Barack Obama, North Korea and China were able to do as they wish under Obama's policy of "strategic patience," but no more.
#KimJongUn secretly left North Korea -- for the 1st time since becoming the hermit kingdom leader in 2011 -- to visit China's Xi Jinping. Of course, this is supposed to represent his outmaneuvering South Korea &amp; the US, according to the liberal progressive left. #tcot
If you follow the MSM you'd believe that Kim Jung UN is some masterful diplomat. Just like when they went school boy crush over Kim Jung UN's sister at the Winter Olympics. You remember, the North Korean Minister of Propaganda, in essence the modern version of Joseph Goebbels

The latest thing to offend the left: #tcot #Census #census2020 #2020Census #immigrationdebate https://t.co/YSSssdhJqA
I shall say it, and am willing to defend this assertion: today's #Democrat party, the progressive socialist left, is indeed an anti-America party. #tcot
Ask yourselves: how can individuals here in America illegally be given authorization to have representation, especially since they cannot participate in our elections? Then again, this is truly what the liberal progressive left wants. #Census #census2020 #2020Census #tcot
What the left fears more than anything is that they will lose electoral representation. We need ask ourselves a basic question of governance, and civics: shall our representation be based upon citizenship, or just population? #census2020 #2020Census #Census #tcot
What delusional mind would refute asking a question regarding American citizenship in our census? To the reasoning of the left — that such a question would deter people in the country illegally from answering the inquiry — is nonsensical. #census2020 #Census #2020Census #tcot
In essence, the left seeks to render American citizens helpless in the face of a growing illegal immigrant population. #census2020 #2020Census #ImmigrationDebate #tcot
The left is currently on a mission to disarm law abiding legal gun owners in America. This is the same left who, as we have witnessed, finds more comfort in embracing criminal illegal immigrants, as in the Kate Steinle case; and the example of Oakland Mayor Schaaf come to mind.
If the liberal progressive left wants to enact these "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants, there are consequences. Ask yourself, who would want to vote for a political party that does not support the concept of these United States of America? #SanctuaryCities #census2020 #tcot
What the left wants is representation in America based upon population, illegal or otherwise, not representation based upon #citizenship. #census2020 #2020Census #tcot
The left needs victims — that is, they need a demographic group that is dependent upon them for electoral patronage, and leverage. The left is driven by a desire for power, nothing less will satisfy their insatiable appetite. #ImmigrationDebate #Citizenship #census2020 #tcot
My thanks to the good folks over at @cnsnews #tcot #DrainTheSwamp  https://t.co/9yVnci7nGO
When Tyranny told Liberty to lay down her weapons, Liberty &amp; Freedom replied, "ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ.” Down in Texas we have a saying which is the English translation: "Come and Take It.” #2A #tcot https://t.co/9N47YE6zFk
The progressive socialist left is all about collective subjugation and that can only be attained if the people are disarmed, rendered unable to defend themselves, and turned from armed citizens into helpless subjects. #2A #tcot

Funny, throughout history we’ve had examples of despots &amp; dictators who believed that personal ownership of weapons was "outdated &amp; misunderstood" —  not to mention dangerous. And yes, it *is* dangerous — for the tyrant — until the populace is disarmed. #2A #tcot

So, at a time when constitutional conservatives were truly angered at the @GOP over the 220 page, $1.3T #Omnibus spending bill, they now have a true cause...and the enthusiasm to prevent leftists from taking over on Capitol Hill. #tcot #2A
Remember that it was a black man, Otis McDonald, who challenged the #guncontrol laws of Chicago because he wanted to be safe in his home. And, it was the @NRA — ya know, that “terrorist organization” — that aided him in his legal pursuits, which he won. #2A #tcot #bcot

Justice #JohnPaulStevens &amp; the #March4OurLives gathering just gave the GOP a political bailout. The number one raison d'etre going into the 2018 midterm election will be to deny the progressive socialist left the ability to repeal the #SecondAmendment. #2A #tcot
Thank you for helping to set the record straight... https://t.co/HY0CWIjeaI
#2A #tcot #Constitution https://t.co/NQTUPDsGiV
Justice #JohnPaulStevens shows that he’s just another progressive elevating the institution of government over the rights, liberty, &amp; freedoms of the American individual. #2A #tcot
I find it rather perplexing that Justice #JohnPaulStevens would say nothing about the failures of the #FBI and the Broward Sheriff's Office, namely Sheriff Scott Israel and Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson. #2A #tcot
Justice #JohnPaulStevens fails to grasp that law abiding legal gun owners had nothing to do with Nikolas Cruz and his evil act. #Parkland #2A #constitution #tcot
As well, Justice #JohnPaulStevens is obviously not a well read student of history. I suppose he fails to understand why the British were marching towards Concord, Massachusetts in April of 1775. #2A #constitution
It seems clear that Justice #JohnPaulStevens doesn't support a critical part of our #Constitution. #2A https://t.co/oaZw8pjYB1

In America, we cheer for champions &amp; @AmbJohnBolton will call the plays that lead to our victory. And ya know what, sometimes you don't have to throw a punch to scare off bullies! Just knowing you are willing to — and can — do so is all it takes for peace to exist. #tcot
And yes, 9-11 was a residual effect of Bill Clinton's weakness, noted by Osama bin Laden after our withdrawal from Somalia. (more) #tcot
Just so our dear misguided friends on the leftist spectrum know: No major war ever started b/c of American strength. Aggression looks for gaps/weakness/opportunity to exploit &amp; during the Bill Clinton &amp; Barack Obama administrations we gave them plenty of ammunition &amp; opportunity.
It’s time the United States stopped playing by rules prescribed by others — rules to weaken and render us ineffective, and irrelevant. (more) #tcot
Why was there no outcry against Obama getting security clearance when he, admittedly, traveled to Pakistan, at at time when US citizens were not allowed to do so? Who was it that financed the young Barry Soetoro to travel there? (more) #tcot
Where was Senator Kaine when Barack Obama was issued security clearance with his known associations with domestic terrorists like Bill Ayres and Bernadette Dorn, along with Louis Farrakhan, and Tony Rezko? (more) #tcot
Virginia Democrat senator &amp; failed Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, has even gone so far as to insinuate that a video done by Amb. Bolton for a grassroots pro-gun group in Russia is somehow evidence that Amb. Bolton can’t get a security clearance...how absurd. (more) #tcot
Folks oft times prefer the Chamberlain, but when those darkest hours come, people look for a Churchill, who was also denigrated by his countrymen. (more) #tcot #ForeignPolicy
Too many in the international community would rather deal with an America that surrenders a position of leadership, the moral high ground.  (more) #tcot #ForeignPolicy
How do we deal with dictators and despots? How do we face autocrats and theocrats? I guess we can do as Obama did and give nice speeches with soaring rhetoric and issue false "red lines." (more) #tcot https://t.co/9ILFgSKCuy
I hear the left castigating @AmbJohnBolton as one who does not exhibit an understanding of the "rules-based international order." Well, that is all fine and good when there are those who play by those rules, but what about those who do not? (more) #tcot
Nothing unnerves the leftists in America more than American strength, which is why they want individual American's disarmed. (more) #2A #tcot
#PositionOfStrength #tcot #bcot https://t.co/CABp0ohv9j
We will work with our allies, but we shall never exude "strategic patience," which to me is synonymous w/cowardice, in order to appease, acquiesce, or compromise our national principles &amp; values: namely a commitment to liberty and freedom against despotic aggression. (more) #tcot
Our national security policy should be forged with the understanding that our national interest and security is above all else. (more) #tcot
The left argues that @AmbJohnBolton believes in American unilateralism; it’s a true statement. And I believe in the same, as opposed to our Nation surrendering its strength, power, might, and sovereignty to these collectivist body politic such as the UN and the EU. (more) #tcot
If you believe in American exceptionalism and resolve, then you are — well, to the left — dangerous. (more) #tcot
Sadly, to the progressive socialist left, if you show strength — embracing Reagan's philosophy of "peace through strength" — you scare them. What the left wants more than anything is a weak America, &amp; that’s what Barack Obama, Susan Rice, &amp; Ben Rhodes gave us. (more) #tcot
For some odd reason, the leftists in America would prefer the shameless and degrading policies of the Obama national security team that resulted in a grossly belligerent #KimJungUn and a regional hegemonic expansion of Iran. (more) #tcot
See, with an @AmbJohnBolton as the National Security Adviser we will no longer be fed insidious policies such as "strategic patience" or be shipping billions of dollars to the Ayatollahs in Iran via unmarked aircraft. (more) #tcot
Furthermore, under an @AmbJohnBolton there will be no more leaks emanating from the White House National Security Council, since the Obama holdovers will be cast adrift. As they well should have been, and that truly causes the grandiose nervousness of the left. (more) #tcot
It is my further belief that @AmbJohnBolton will not recommend that President Trump  whisper off mic to a Russian emissary that he will have "more flexibility" after his reelection (more) #tcot https://t.co/FXvndwBvAJ
As the synergy point for foreign policy as it relates to our national security, @AmbJohnBolton will probably not go out to Toys R Us &amp; purchase a little yellow toy with a red button on it to be presented to the Russian foreign minister. (more) #tcot https://t.co/4DAKWxPbaK
For some reason I do not think Amb. Bolton will be selecting a Deputy National Security Adviser who will be lying to the media about a foreign policy agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, nor being "creative" with intelligence memos from the CIA, as Ms. Rice did. (more) #tcot
Ms. Rice also told us all that Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. And remember little Ben Rhodes, ya know, that fella with the Masters degree in creative writing, younger brother of the President of CBS News? (more) #tcot
Y'all remember them, right? Ms. Rice who stated on five different Sunday news talk shows that #Benghazi was just a protest over a crude anti-islamic video (more) #tcot
Left’s greatest fear is that @AmbJohnBolton will assemble a team &amp; create a national security strategy contrasting the complete failure, incompetence, corruption, weakness, ineptness &amp; deceit of the Obama administration's national security team of Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes (more)
Now, bless their little liberal progressive hearts, since their original Darth Vader — Vice President Dick Cheney — has been gone, the left has long since been looking for a new boogeyman. (more) #tcot
By the left’s reaction, you would almost believe that @AmbJohnBolton has become a one man, well, James Bond Spectre type of organization. As I said, it’s laughable (more) #tcot
But what has been truly laughable —  and quite disconcerting — is the complete meltdown of the left over @AmbJohnBolton “starting a war” with Iran, North Korea, heck, I guess everyone. (more) #tcot
Let's first set the record straight on something. President Obama had 2 National Security Advisers, 2 SecState's, 2 Attorney Generals, &amp; 4 SecDef's in his tenure, not to mention some 3 different Chief's of Staff. So please, no more with the duplicitous hypocrisy (more) #tcot
