.@Jvzuck: What do "big" and "tech" mean? Some of the biggest companies don't make any money. And some of the biggest "tech" companies aren't primarily about tech anymore. #ITIFBigTech
.@bpmehlman: We need greater innovation diversity in the United States beyond Silicon Valley. #ITIFBigTech
.@bpmehlman: We need to think critically about what new jobs will be created and how to make them more accessible. #ITIFBigTech
.@bpmehlman: There have been waves of techno-optimism and techno-pessimism. But the state of technology has not been as optimistic or pessimistic as they often portray. #ITIFBigTech
.@bpmehlman: Tech isn't monolithic. There are a lot of different companies, and not all have upset policymakers and society in the same way. #ITIFBigTech
.@SreeRamaswamy: A superstar ecosystem may be emerging. Gains are getting more geographically concentrated, often in superstar cities. #ITIFBigTech
.@SreeRamaswamy: Nearly half of all superstar firms fall out of the top ranks in every business cycle - churn rate has not changed over the past 3 business cycles. #ITIFBigTech
.@SreeRamaswamy: Superstar firms, making up the top 10 percent of firms by economic value, account for 80 percent of all economic value creation. And superstar firms are not just technology companies - they come from all sectors of the global economy. #ITIFBigTech
.@dmoschella: Self-regulation has served the U.S. well so far. The most successful role of government is when governments use technology to meet their own needs. #ITIFBigTech

.@RobAtkinsonITIF: We're not saying that all mergers are good and that big firms never misbehave. The argument is more about whether antitrust policy generally gets it right. #ITIFBigBiz #BigBizisBeautiful
.@superwuster: At a certain point, the advantages of big business deal less with efficiencies and more with barriers to entry. #ITIFBigBiz
.@superwuster: With increasing size, at some point (depending on industry), scale runs out, resulting in dis-efficiencies of scale. #ITIFBigBiz

.@BobPerch: In order to mobilize technology, we need the mobilization of large amounts of capital that can only be done by the private sector.  #ITIFenergy
.@BobPerch: The private sector has been very focused on greenhouse gases and sustainability for some straightforward business reasons. Investors are thinking about it, and businesses are starting to think long-term. #ITIFenergy
.@BobPerch: There is no coherent federal policy in the United States to address climate change. Our greenhouse gas emissions have declined, but the electric sector has played a big part. #ITIFenergy
.@JudiGreenwald: Bridging low-carbon innovation gaps is a challenge, but it’s doable. But time is of the essence - we have to innovate faster. #ITIFenergy
.@JudiGreenwald: Three revolutions could be game changers: electrification, mobility as-a-service, and automation. #ITIFenergy
.@JudiGreenwald: Transportation emissions are the most difficult to address, because low oil prices are a challenge and most historical progress in the U.S. has been through vehicle efficiency standards. #ITIFenergy
.@JudiGreenwald: The Mid Century Strategy Vision calls for improving energy efficiency, near-complete decarbonization of electricity, and switching to electricity and other low-carbon fuels in transportation, buildings, and industry. #ITIFenergy
Read @ProfDavidHart's full report, "Making 'Beyond Lithium' a Reality: Fostering Innovation in Long-Duration Grid Storage" #ITIFenergy https://t.co/4vwMU3hRDl
.@ProfDavidHart: Federal leadership is needed in long-duration grid storage. We need to set aggressive goals and to invest in a diverse portfolio of new technologies. #ITIFenergy
.@ProfDavidHart: Some technology options include pumped-hydropower, flow batteries, liquid metal batteries, thermal storage, compressed air, and hydrogen. #ITIFenergy
.@ProfDavidHart: Lithium-ion batteries are too expensive and prone to safety problems, and they don't last long enough. This technology has surprised us in the past few years, but we also need back-up technologies. #ITIFenergy
.@ProfDavidHart: The biggest slice of the hardest to eliminate carbon emissions is highly reliable electricity. #ITIFenergy https://t.co/kSHG1WFmo3
Read @colin_cunliff's full report, "An Innovation Agenda for Deep Decarbonization: Bridging Gaps in the Federal Energy RD&amp;D Portfolio" #ITIFenergy https://t.co/DmKTw8lrSi
.@colin_cunliff: We need innovation to address the carbon emissions that are hardest to eliminate. Policy recommendations include increasing funding, establishing new research programs, reorganizing energy RD&amp;D programs, and enabling greater private-sector innovation. #ITIFenergy
.@colin_cunliff: To address the carbon emissions that are most difficult to eliminate, our report identifies six ‘technology missions’ with corresponding policy recommendations that would bridge the gaps in the current RD&amp;D portfolio. #ITIFenergy https://t.co/zcfFngkINK
.@colin_cunliff: All emissions are hard to eliminate, but the most difficult to eliminate include highly-reliable electricity, aviation, shipping, industrial processes, and high-temperature heat. #ITIFenergy https://t.co/ZH0rHLa6XG
.@colin_cunliff:  U.S. emissions are projected to level off, but we need them to continue decreasing. #ITIFenergy https://t.co/2E6bTsDDua
.@colin_cunliff:  We need radical innovation in clean technologies. It will require a broad set of technologies that cover all economic sectors. #ITIFenergy
.@RobAtkinsonITIF: Climate change is real, and we have to do something. But neither side of the aisle has come to terms with what we need to do. The grand bargain is and should be technological innovation. #ITIFenergy

.@JoannaILewis: Several Chinese battery manufacturers are benefiting from industrial policies (and indirect subsidies), as well as government procurement. #ITIFenergy
.@JoannaILewis: There are four categories of regulatory frameworks for energy storage in China: innovation and industrial policies, power sector reforms, broader energy sector goals, and regulations targeting energy storage. #ITIFenergy
.@JoannaILewis: China leads a $300+ billion per year global clean energy industry. It is particularly strong in scaling-up and commercializing clean tech innovations. #ITIFenergy
.@JoannaILewis: China is late to the game in developing energy storage technologies, but it has been ramping up very quickly and is on track to surpass current leaders. #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: Catching up requires "technology-smart" policy. Policy should include making production in Europe and partnerships with European firms attractive; creating a large and predictable home market; and creating incentive for a “European cell.” #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: It is hard, if not impossible, to leapfrog. The next generation requires a lot of tacit knowledge, and gaining it requires	experience with design, production and use of the technology. #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: Is a battery cell a commodity-like	component to simply source on the market? No - it is a core, strategic, and complex component  #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: When it comes to Europe, there are three puzzle pieces to consider: the battery industry, the car industry, and government. And currently, these pieces do not match. #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: Future demand for Lithium-ion batteries will come from three main markets: stationary energy storage, electric vehicles, and consumer applications. #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: We're seeing historic demand for and innovation in lithium-ion batteries, which has helped bring down costs. #ITIFenergy
.@ETH_EPG's Tobias Schmidt: Lithium-ion's fundamental advantages include high round-trip efficiency, low temperature, and relative safety. #ITIFenergy

.@JV_Kennedy: The consumer welfare standard focuses on the interests of the majority of Americans. We should be hesitant to discard this strong consensus in favor of a failed theory from America’s past. #ITIFantitrust
.@JV_Kennedy: Holding antitrust responsible for everything is likely to mean that it accomplishes nothing. #ITIFantitrust
.@JV_Kennedy: Government interference in the market to protect smaller, less efficient companies from going out of business would reduce productivity and living standards. #ITIFantitrust
.@JV_Kennedy: Antitrust is not the appropriate place for framing privacy policy or enforcing it. #ITIFantitrust
.@JV_Kennedy: The consumer welfare standard also protects other market participants. Companies are not allowed to use market power to unfairly drive down the prices of their suppliers or conspire to take actions that would reduce labor costs. #ITIFantitrust
.@JV_Kennedy: In fact, in some ways large companies can actually spur competition. They are often also the best source for the knowledge, capital, and marketing expertise that are needed to take a promising innovation to scale. #ITIFantitrust

.@JV_Kennedy: In most markets, concentration remains at moderate levels and no company has a dominant share of the national market. Modest concentration does not necessarily imply harm to consumers. #ITIFantitrust

.@JV_Kennedy: A new movement resurrects the arguments of former Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, who argued that bigness itself was a curse leading to a broad range of social ills. #ITIFantitrust

.@WillRinehart: I'd like to see some reforms at the FTC, which would be a big lift. The FTC is the place you'd like to see privacy enforcement. #ITIFprivacy
.@castrotech: Cambridge Analytica is a Europe-based company, and European data protection laws didn't stop their practices. #ITIFprivacy
.@JustinBrookman: I would prefer to see a data protection law that lays out clear rules for what you can do. #ITIFprivacy
Have questions for our panel? Tweet them using #ITIFprivacy. https://t.co/W7T0AKhNre
.@castrotech: A potential area of agreement is around data breach laws. However, we shouldn't work to limit data sharing, but rather to hold companies accountable for how they share it. #ITIFprivacy
.@JustinBrookman: The law should try to align privacy expectations with practices. #ITIFprivacy
.@astepanovich: The U.S. sector-specific approach has fended off harms in certain industries, but it has not done its job providing a sufficient level of data protection for people in the United States and it won't keep up with global standards. #ITIFprivacy
.@castrotech: It's not clear data protection laws like the GDPR will be effective. If you look across countries, the level of trust in the Internet is about the same. #ITIFprivacy
.@castrotech: Policymakers should be asking whether consumers want to pay more for privacy. Surveys show consumers consistently don't want to pay. #ITIFprivacy
.@castrotech: Data protection laws should be solving a real problem, and we need to be very clear about identifying that problem. They shouldn't have a negative impact on consumers or innovation. #ITIFprivacy
.@astepanovich: The Right to be Forgotten is in part a right to deletion and in part a right to erasure. The latter is more controversial in the United States and easier to abuse. #ITIFprivacy
.@astepanovich: If we don't put data protection practices in place now, new companies will build themselves for a system that doesn't have these rules. #ITIFprivacy
.@astepanovich: The GDPR was written in a very specific context and with case law that the U.S. doesn't have. Re-writing it or copying it in the U.S. would not be the right solution. #ITIFprivacy
.@WillRinehart: A federal law doesn't have to suffer the same problems of the EU's GDPR. #ITIFprivacy
.@WillRinehart: Due to the GDPR, companies have to retool their processes, there is an increase in risk compliance, and it causes the broader industry to change.  #ITIFprivacy
.@WillRinehart: We don't have unbounded data collection right now. There are some control rights under different platforms. #ITIFprivacy
.@JustinBrookman: Surveys show people desperately want more privacy but don't feel a sense of agency to protect their information. #ITIFprivacy
.@JustinBrookman: Privacy policies from companies haven't been helpful. They are often vague and difficult to interpret. So how do we meaningfully convey what is going on? #ITIFprivacy

.@JosephMajkut: If you are solely focused on financing, there are a lot of things to tax. The reason we'd tax carbon is beyond deficit reduction - it's to improve the environment. #ITIFcarbontax
.@JV_Kennedy: We'll need to address both climate change and deficit reduction, but it is wiser to keep the two issues separate. Using revenues just for deficit reduction will not be enough to build support for a carbon tax. #ITIFcarbontax
.@DMarron: Not all carbon taxes are created equal. The size, breadth, and trajectory matter. #ITIFcarbontax
.@JosephMajkut: A carbon tax is a mechanism to internalize costs and create an ambitious, economy-wide way to address climate change. #ITIFcarbontax

.@cwru's Sue Helper: Supply chains and workforce policies have made it more difficult for the U.S. to compete internationally. The institutes help compensate for losses in some key industries and build clusters of practice. #ITIFenergy
.@cwru's Sue Helper: It can be a challenge for small manufacturers to implement new technologies. The institutes' demonstration projects can help small manufacturers deploy them. #ITIFenergy
.@AmChemistry's Gina Oliver: The innovation institutes play an important role in securing the U.S. position as a leader in advanced manufacturing. Protecting our investments in energy innovation is critical to this success. #ITIFenergy
ITIF's report recommends that policymakers should continue to fund existing institutes; allow greater flexibility; intensify outreach to small and medium manufacturers; develop mid-skill education and training; and inform public regarding energy-specific mission. #ITIFenergy
Market failures to energy innovation include under-investment in knowledge and skills, weak cooperation across supply chains and within regions, and unfair international competition. #ITIFenergy

Doug Doerfler of @MaxCyte_info: To ensure patient capital stays, we need transparent science-based regulations, strong intellectual property, and a competitive tax code. #ITIFlifesciences
Joe Devaney of @AstellasUS: To remain competitive, universities and industry need to improve their ability to work together. #ITIFlifesciences
.@SWHRAmy: The U.S. can remain globally competitive in the life-sciences through reevaluating requirements for clinical trial participation, closing the gap in research on unmet need, improving research on women's health, and modernizing the regulatory system. #ITIFlifesciences
Mitch Horowitz of @TEConomyP_LLC: States have had to step up to meet specialized requirements like R&amp;D that support the life-sciences innovation ecosystem. #ITIFlifesciences
Mitch Horowitz of @TEConomyP_LLC: The life-sciences sector is an American success story and an amazing economic driver. If we don't pay attention to it, we may lose that ground. #ITIFlifesciences
.@JV_Kennedy: To strengthen U.S. competitiveness, policies should: expand R&amp;D tax credit, support NIH funding, expand workforce training in STEM fields, restore long-term financial stability to health care, and address unfair trade practices by other countries. #ITIFlifesciences
.@JV_Kennedy: The U.S. has a relatively free market for drugs and devices. Other countries suppress both demand and prices in their markets. #ITIFlifesciences
.@JV_Kennedy: The U.S. is losing global market share in the life-sciences, and the biggest winners have been Switzerland and Germany. #ITIFlifesciences

Anh Duong of @DHSgov:  We want to reach full integration of drones into our national airspace because it will grow our economy. The authority we're seeking is an important step to assure the public we have the necessary capabilities. #ITIFdrones
Brendan Groves of @TheJusticeDept: We need legislative relief because the use of drones is hamstrung by federal laws that were written before the technology existed. #ITIFdrones
.@Diana_M_Cooper: We should focus on granting the appropriate authorities so technologies can be tested and deployed. #ITIFdrones
Anh Duong of @DHSgov: The free market provides a wealth of solutions, but not all will be suitable for users. For example, many existing solutions were developed for military settings. #ITIFdrones

Michael Lind: Not all new businesses are startups, so they shouldn’t be treated that way. #BigBizisBeautiful
Michael Lind: Ironically, one of the reasons the reputation of big business has declined is the decline of labor organizations. Historically, labor organizations supported big businesses because they provided better jobs and higher wages. #BigBizisBeautiful
.@RobAtkinsonITIF: #BigBizisBeautiful argues for an open and honest dialogue about the benefits of big business.
Michael Lind: During waves of technological innovation, countries with great industrial power adopt new technologies in different forms and with different methods. #BigBizisBeautiful
.@RobAtkinsonITIF: Putting an end to size-based industrial policy would support innovation and lead to an increase in wages and productivity. #BigBizisBeautiful
.@RobAtkinsonITIF: Aggressive antitrust enforcement in the 1950s that forced U.S. companies to give up their patents created an opportunity for competitors abroad to gain leadership in high-tech industries. #BigBizisBeautiful

Compromise should not be seen as betrayal of sacred principles, and cooler heads should prevail. #NetNeutrality #FCCLive #OpenMtgFCC https://t.co/IfDFG2Rshs
For those of us trying to articulate good polices that preserve the open and dynamic character of the Internet—at both the edge and the core—while giving those throughout the entire Internet system the confidence to invest, the current debate is downright dismaying #NetNeutrality
With a legislative compromise, Democrats could not only secure open Internet protections but a laundry list of progressive goals that aren’t provided for under current law, such as rural broadband infrastructure, broadband adoption and digital literacy spending. #NetNeutrality
Legacy telecommunications laws don’t offer the balance needed for a dynamic platform like the Internet that encompasses not one application, but many, all with different needs from the network. #NetNeutrality
@AjitPaiFCC Republicans should seek regulatory stability, even if at the cost of broader FCC authority than they would prefer. Likewise, Democrats should recognize Title II, a law written in a different era for a static monopoly, is not a hill worth dying on. #NetNeutrality
@AjitPaiFCC But those on the right who think this “#NetNeutrality lite” at the FTC is sustainable will have another thing coming if a Democrat is elected president. Democrats—right or wrong—don’t see antitrust as an effective safeguard, and this pendulum could very well swing back.
.@AjitPaiFCC is right to pull broadband out from under the cloud of Title II’s heavy-handed regulation. The hyperbolic fearmongering leading up to this vote is simply not grounded in reality—the openness of the Internet never has been and is not now under threat. #NetNeutrality

Senator @ChrisCoons: The chance to work across the aisle with other Senators toward competitiveness goals is among the most rewarding work I do. Through thorough, thoughtful, and bipartisan work, we can remain a highly competitive country. #ITIFcompetitiveness
Senator @ChrisCoons: The competitive spirit is one of the key factors in our economy. Globalization demands that we continue to focus on innovation.  #ITIFcompetitiveness
Andrew Reamer: There is an absence of institutional mechanisms to do competitiveness policy. #ITIFcompetitiveness
.@SreeRamaswamy: Improving competitiveness could help address the widening U.S. trade deficit in advanced industries. #ITIFcompetitiveness

.@JeffFarrah: The competition for high-growth startups has become a global game. Other countries are courting entrepreneurs and creating the right environment for the next generation of high-growth companies. #ITIFtechstartups
All levels of government should bolster tech-based start-ups by crafting policies that increase survival and success rates of tech-based start-ups, encourage individuals to create or join them, and enable them to scale their growth faster and become larger. #ITIFtechstartups

Our report recommends reauthorizing @ARPAE, expanding its budget, maintaining its operational autonomy, establishing an ARPA-E trust fund to stabilize its budget, and infusing ARPA-E practices into the rest of @ENERGY. #ITIFcleanenergy
.@ARPAE projects have led to 56 new companies formed, $1.8 billion in private-sector follow-on funding, and 14 commercial products. #ITIFcleanenergy
Our report shows @ARPAE projects were at least five times more likely to produce both a patent and a publication as comparable @ENERGY OS or EERE projects. #ITIFcleanenergy
Our new report shows @ARPAE projects were more likely to produce a patent than similar projects within @ENERGY's EERE. #ITIFcleanenergy
Policy weaknesses in U.S. energy innovation include an over-reliance on peer review allocation of R&amp;D, and gaps between publicly-supported R&amp;D and application in the energy system. #ITIFcleanenergy

We would like to thank our stellar panel and audience for a great discussion on Innovation vs. Maintenance in the Drive Toward “Hybrid” Infrastructure. Stay tuned for a video of the discussion: https://t.co/6ZVetpp6ap https://t.co/sbM9O2t7ag
Read more about The Maintainers, a community of scholars coordinated by @STS_News and Andrew Russell from @SUNYPolyInst, and interested in the “maintenance, repair, upkeep and the mundane labour that keeps the world going.” https://t.co/JvjmdiNAO9
"Yes we need to push for innovation when it is beneficial to us but we need to keep the innovative power of digital technology in context. Remote sensors are cool and useful but are they as transformative as cement? I don’t think so." - Lee Vinsel (@STS_News) #ITIFinfrastructure
John Casana, of @ASCETweets and @BoozAllen, points out that innovation and maintenance are not mutually exclusive. We need innovative technologies for effective maintenance. #ITIFinfrastructure
The issue of maintenance is bi-partisan and interests both progressives and conservatives, according to Russell. Progressives believe that maintainers deserve more recognition &amp; conservatives like the idea of conserving what we already have. #ITIFinfrastructure
Andrew Russell from @SUNYPolyInst emphasized the importance of inculcating a maintainance mindset among all innovators and policy-makers. #ITIFinfrastructure
"Many public transportation agencies focus on procuring low-cost technologies, but we need to get them thinking about high-return investments instead.” - @rpuentes #ITIFinfrastructure

According to @rpuentes of @EnoTrans,"A big part of the problem is that many public transportation agencies don't know what the maintenance needs are for their infrastructure." #ITIFinfrastructure
Our all-star panelists for the day are @rpuentes - president and CEO of @EnoTrans, @SUNYPolyInst's Andrew Russell, @BoozAllen's John Casana, and @STS_News from Virginia Tech. #ITIFinfrastructure
