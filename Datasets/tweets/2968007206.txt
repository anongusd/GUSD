An FBI investigation should immediately commence, the Senate should slow down, and it is the responsibility of Congress to get to the facts before moving forward with Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to the highest court in the land. https://t.co/qXzr0XgSKF
Republican Senate Judiciary Chairman Grassley scheduled the vote to advance Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination prior to hearing Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony sending a message to victims, survivors &amp; the American people that they don't care about the facts, a fair process, or public opinion. https://t.co/CxYn5YoBAB

The FBI investigated Anita Hill‚Äôs allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas before a hearing was held. Republican Leadership and the White House should allow an investigation to move forward.

Donald Trump made 4,229 false claims in 558 days. In June and July of 2018, he averaged 16 false claims a day. This is not normal, and he will go down as the most untruthful President in U.S. history.  https://t.co/pAUwCOU42I
America needs more solutions, not pollution. Trump‚Äôs rollback of existing federal clean air standards will cost the U.S. $450B by 2050 &amp; expose Americans to increased health risks caused by air pollution. Americans deserve #HigherStandards. #CleanerCars
The Trump Administration‚Äôs announcement that it will roll back current fuel economy standards defies commonsense. This is one of the most destructive decisions of Trump‚Äôs presidency, and will only hurt our environment, economy, and public health. America deserves #HigherStandards https://t.co/51f3x08Qv5
Rolling back fuel economy standards is an attack on clean air and public health. Proud to lead 60 of my colleagues in condemning this move and showing the Trump Administration that America deserves #HigherStandards.	https://t.co/f0ETJxy6F7

We must take a stand against this type of inequality by imposing a tax on corporations that pay CEOs salaries higher than 100x what it pays workers. @RepBonnie &amp; I are pushing a bill in Congress that would impose this tax. https://t.co/aS55aBw1hj
Income inequality is a serious problem facing our nation. The pay disparity between the average American CEO &amp; average worker is a ratio of 303-to-1. The #GOPTaxScam is doubling down on this pain w/ reports that corporate executives have profited handsomely under the new tax law.
Thank you to our local firefighters, first responders, and cooperating agencies for their bravery and hard work to contain the Marsh Fire east of Mount Diablo and protect the families, homes, and communities of Contra Costa County. Stay safe everyone!	https://t.co/aw5MloTKwB

If this is true, it flies in the face of Donald Trump's ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù rhetoric and instead it directly implicates him in an effort to conspire and collude with the Russians to sway the 2016 election in his favor. https://t.co/ouoh4wKYGA

Today, @repcummings and I called on the Government Accountability Office to study the practices that are leading to this neglect in order to identify a way to put an end to this type of unfair treatment.  https://t.co/VUMPrj3vrd
This neglect creates a serious problem for the surrounding neighborhoods, both for the risks to health and safety as well as for the drag on local economic development, including the diminished attractiveness of the neighborhoods to new residents and homebuyers.
A decade after the housing and financial crisis of 2008, foreclosure still affects one in every 96 households, and another three million loans are likely to reach the foreclosure pipeline this year‚Äîleaving millions of houses potentially vulnerable to neglect.

While Donald Trump and his minions will surely try to spin the #IGReport as fake news, the real fake news is their claims of tax cuts helping working people and their false promises of affordable health care that protects those with pre-existing conditions.
At a time when the American people are left to decipher fact from fiction, I have great respect for Inspector General Michael Horowitz and the work of the IG‚Äôs office.

If the #TrumpKimSummit were an honest effort to create a pathway to denuclearization, we would be working with our allies on an acceptable &amp; verifiable plan. Trump‚Äôs actions show that he is constantly looking for his 15 minutes of fame, not for solutions to make our world safer.

Thoughts and prayers are not enough, failure to act dishonors the victims and all who have been affected by gun violence.
On a day that is supposed to be filled with love, my heart is broken for the victims, families &amp; the entire Parkland, FL community impacted by this horrific shooting. It's long past time for Congress to engage in a rational conversation on how to curb gun violence in America.

Today, I joined my Democratic colleagues in sponsoring the CLEARANCE Act, requiring the WH to report on the #securityclearances that it grants.		https://t.co/6zyYJDKSX8
Knowing who has access to our most sensitive information is critical to protecting our national security. Dozens of senior Trump WH officials have access to highly classified information, before being fully cleared by the FBI.
Hopefully @TGowdySC investigating WH #SecurityClearances is the first step on the path toward conducting bipartisan oversight of the executive branch. The integrity of our democratic institutions depends on it. https://t.co/8BVBTs1Gam

President Trump‚Äôs infrastructure plan sets back American families and communities. It calls for limited federal investment, but will raise costs on American families and dramatically cut transportation projects in urban areas, like Contra Costa County. https://t.co/8d1NRqVEPN
