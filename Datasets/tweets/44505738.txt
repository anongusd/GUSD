@Allen_Clifton Based on computers modeling data that may not be accurate or was derived to produce a certain result.
@Allen_Clifton The 97% number is highly suspect.
@Allen_Clifton To me a conservative gives the fed its enumerated powers and leaves the rest to the states, local govt and individuals.
@Allen_Clifton I would argue that CO2 is an effect of warming and not the cause. Other gases like water vapor have a much greater impact.
@Allen_Clifton Now we're getting somewhere. Is the human impact significant enough to restrict certain economic activity that impacts lives?
@Allen_Clifton So, only humans cause the climate to change? Sun, earth tilt/wobble, ocean currents etc have nothing to do with it?
@Allen_Clifton Again, Establishment Republicans are not conservatives. I'm against unconstitutional big govt regardless of party affiliation
http://t.co/HqFE7wgdC6 @wilkowmajority China may not have Nicaraguans but they have some North Koreans.
@Allen_Clifton Not true. Our govt was setup to protect individual freedom and rights for all. There are limits on what the fed can do.
@Allen_Clifton Not true. There are many variables that control climate. Some things are not even fully understood.
@Allen_Clifton Accusations of denial are straw man argument. Climate is complicated and science is never "settled". Debate is AGW or not AGW
@Allen_Clifton You're confusing true conservatives who believe in individual rights and freedom of opportunity with big govt statists.
@Allen_Clifton Not true of little "r" republicans.
