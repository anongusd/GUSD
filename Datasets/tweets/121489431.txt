@MollyJongFast Trump's going there at the end of the month.
We have now drifted into madness. The Democrats and with Russia. Collusion between the Democrats and the fake news right here.
"Their policy of taking away your car. Taking away your airplanes. You're not allowed to own cows any more." Also, it should not be allowed to investigate the crooks I surrounded myself with me.
"They all said we love the tone of your State of the Union speech."	But now I'm in El Paso, so I can be a jackass.

@LisaDeeleySmith They said Sloan had named Haldeman to the Watergate GJ as someone who controlled the ratfcking fund at CREEP. Haldeman had controlled the fund, but nobody had asked Sloan about it in the GJ. So their attribution was wrong, but the fact of the matter wasn't.

@PeterDombrowsk6 @IvanCarter9 First time I ever saw Stockton and Malone. Danny Manning was there before starting school at Kansas and he got absolutely killed. Barkley laid a screen on Stockton that you could feel in your teeth. Stockton got up with a fist cocked. That's when I knew he was a keeper.
