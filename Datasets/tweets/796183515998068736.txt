President Trump is once again putting his own interests above those of hardworking Americans who need their paychecks, especially this time of year. His willingness to shut down the govt at the last minute (when he's had two years to work on border security) is reckless. #FL07
The idea of America is too great to be walled off from the rest of the world. We need a real plan to secure our nation‚Äôs borders including Florida‚Äôs air and sea ports, not shut down the government and punish families to prove a political point over a misguided wall. #FL07 #FlaPol

I'm honored to be the first Vietnamese-American woman to serve in Congress. As an American, I'm deeply concerned by @POTUS' attempts to renegotiate the 2008 MOU between Vietnam &amp; the U.S., which would potentially deport Vietnamese refugees who arrived in the U.S. before 1995. 2/3

...I‚Äôm optimistic about the future. But it won‚Äôt be easy. I‚Äôll keep working in Congress to build bipartisan support to treat gun violence like the epidemic it is. We must work together, and we must act like our lives - and our children‚Äôs lives - depend on it. Because they do.
...I refuse to accept these mass shootings - and the daily drumbeat of gun violence in our communities - as the new normal. From Pulse to Parkland to Las Vegas, I‚Äôm continually inspired by the survivors and victims of these tragedies, their stories, and their advocacy...
...We don‚Äôt have all the answers, but we do have some, and some is a start. What this Congress lacks, however, is the courage to stand up to the corporate gun lobby and pass even incremental, popular reforms. It‚Äôs shameful. We deserve better. Our children deserve better...
...We must do more than simply pay lip service to mental health; we need to strengthen it and better fund it. Weapons should be harder to get, not easier. Assault weapons that can take down hundreds in a manner of minutes belong on battlefields, not on our streets...
...After each of these tragedies, we looked for a single deficiency to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù this problem because it was easier than identifying the real problem: we have a systemic gun violence problem in this country. We need more than patchwork fixes; we need comprehensive reform...
One year ago today, hundreds of individuals &amp; families had their lives taken or forever changed in the #LasVegasShooting. My thoughts are with them today. Since then, in Florida alone, we‚Äôve had mass shootings in Parkland, Jacksonville, and before that, Pulse. Enough is enough...

RT @Fla_Pol: House defense bill advances with several provisions from Stephanie Murphy https://t.co/st5DowOq5X via @ScottFist #FlaPol https‚Ä¶
5) Since last year, I've fought to ensure the @DeptofDefense's @USNationalGuard counter-drug program has the resources it needs to combat drug trafficking. Last night, we secured an additional $20 million for the program to address the opioid crisis.
4) It includes language from H.R. 5126, a bipartisan bill I intro'd with @RepBrianMast to deter attacks against Israel and ensure that it can defend its citizens. Given the recent rocket attacks launched against Israel from Syria, it's more critical than ever we support our ally.
3) I secured language in the defense bill to strengthen Orlando‚Äôs world-leading modeling, simulation, &amp; training community and our growing cyber community. My provisions will help keep high-paying tech jobs in #Orlando and protect our national security assets from cyberattack.
2) The NDAA includes the language of my Microloan Modernization Act, which helps entrepreneurs obtain low-interest loans of up to $50,000. As a former businesswoman, I'm committed to supporting small businesses, including those who aid our troops in their missions.
1) The defense bill includes the core of the BATTLE Act, which I authored with @RepJackBergman to help servicemembers transition to civilian life by preparing them to attend college, learn a trade, or start a small business. @VFWHQ, @studentvets, and @iavaMy endorsed my bill.
