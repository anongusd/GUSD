@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with you much, but those questions are still not answered during this testimony.  It was a waste of time, apparently Cohen was running manuevers for Trump but not by explicit order of Trump.
@kurteichenwald Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Cohen Testimony was like watching divorce court proceedings to me.  To save you time, let me simplify:  Somehow Cohen had a crystal ball that told him to do bad things for Trump, yet Trump didnt tell him to.  That's like saying I robbed the liquor store cause my dog wanted me to.

@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux I'll concede that we may have different definitions of cultural appropriation.  Also it seems many people aren't in agreement on where the line is crossed between what is or isn't giving one culture or another a bad light.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux How so?  Can you elaborate?  What verbage has he used to call violence for one race to commit on another?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux Nationalism can theoretically be sustainable if the right formula for economy, trade, and protection of civil rights can be achieved.  A self-sustaining element helps a lot.  Having it run on fiet currency however is a recipe for disaster.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux This is where the danger or vulnerability of letting people gain too much influence with wealth etc, and not addressing it with anti-trust laws etc.  If they can reach enough voices, they can subvert enough of the population to start a race war.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux So you agree that cultural appropriation is healthy for diversifying populations then correct?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux So a Harvard graduate has to be treated equally to a high school drop out when it comes to employment?  Making it a law is just going to confuse things.  There's no clear perfect way of making sure it's fair for those that deserve and those that don't.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux So you think cultural differences have gotten worse or better?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux Evolution or progression of that is the dependency to trade with others which forces them to be more accepting to survive.  How do you think we got to this point before technology came in?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux Hunan Nature meaning in this particular case is how the evolution of cultural development for that particular faction or tribe is.  In some cases, if they aren't meeting others outside of their own, they get stuck in their bubble and create a plethora of trust issues for others.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux You're speaking of human nature.  Which a law doesn't force it to go away unfortunately, sometimes it makes it worse.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux It's not race at all these towns should worry about.  It's hostile actors wanting to put the constiuents in danger for various motivational reasons.  Land/resource/strategic placement etc.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux What's stopping him?  If a hotel is dependent on renting out that one extra room in order to pay the staff, would it make more sense that they rent the room or go in the negatives for silly prejudice?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux Well obviously state B isn't associated with States A and C.  Which can be viewed as a hostile territory.  Will have to find an alternate route, while State B gonna have to deal with its own internal problems of civil unrest.		Are we confusing corporations with government now?
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux I see.  It's a difficult choice for sure.  On one hand the question is freedom of choice.  The other hand is enforcing acceptance of others.  Both cases prejudice can still exist.
@Yozhik26 @montkobalte @A4OutOf10Dem @StefanMolyneux Interesting, I'm a friend to a few Muslims myself, they never mention this.  Are you unknowingly associated with people on a watch list?
@StefanMolyneux Ok, I'll bite.  Is the plan to reverse the demonization of cultural appropriation?  Encourage celebration of non-decaying culture, and praise diversity of thought?

@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa That's where Military Tribunals come in.  It won't be a civilian court case at that point.  The judges for those cases are appointed by the Commander in Chief for 15 year terms.
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa There will likely be detractors though, when some of them recognize that the one in power is tyrannical.  Officers are permitted to disregard orders if they feel the orders received are unlawful.
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa Also, the left-right crap.  Hopefully one day it ends, and we can just be human beings left alone to enjoy our devices.
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa I don't think the normal hardworking left or the right american that should be feared, its whoever can pass orders to the military is who should be feared.  There won't be a level playing field at all when an actual situation arises in relation to "civil war."
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa Also, with the Defense budget as big as it is now, "Shays rebellion" repeat won't happen since this particular time our military has all the funding in the world.
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa A rebellion like that?  Hardly.  Have you seen the tech the military has nowadays not available to public?  Active denial system, no harm done to them, and they can be easily incapacitated. Range is up to 1km.  This is just 1 example.  Military-industrial-complex reigns. https://t.co/Rn8scMRDif
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa Not everyone is falling for it though luckily.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa I won't argue that, its just the way the state of corporate media is, one side is radicalizing to the left, and the other side is radicalizing to the right.  Media Matters getting funded by hyper-partisan actors, just fuels it too.  Polarized media is just that, polarized.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa I did, fox news, they're still partnered with the NRA.  After the boycotts earlier of course they're gonna fear monger, its just gun sales and membership dues they're trying to get.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa I haven't caught that, so whose telling who to arm up?  You do realize its the NRA looking to increase gun sales for their gun manufacturers right?
@QConteret @E_A_Swearengen @mmfa Shays Rebellion does have some historical value, but how does it relate to today?  The NICS, is used basically at the federal level on every gun purchase.  If they're a radical, chances are likely they would be caught.  Its the underground gun trade we have to worry about mainly.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa I read it.  Want me to repost what you said?  The rest of it hinges on the same original point.  Why is it a logical assumption that somehow gun-owners are just looking to over-throw the government to you?
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa It just seems a bit wacky to be walking down the street to subway, and look at a guy and automatically think "yep hes looking to buy a gun, and kill us all, and resurrect hitler into power."  No offense.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa Correct, its semantics though.  You actually said "Nearly all white men."  Which if half of the white man population is "nearly all" to you, I would say that we have different perspectives of what "nearly all" is.  Nearly all would be you know like 95%.  Its nearly half, no alarm
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa To assume intuitively that a grave situation is brewing without proper analysis of the facts is what fear mongers do.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa 42% of the Adult population are gun owners.  Only half of white men own a gun, which if you wanted to say that there are more White men that own guns than most other groups, you would be correct.  However to say they're all intentionally arming up for some race war, its far off.
@E_A_Swearengen @QConteret @mmfa "Gun ownership attracts some people (nearly all white men)"		Claim here is misleading to begin with, and the rhetorical nonsense after that gives implications that they're all out to kill you.  Come on man, be realistic.  https://t.co/hNsT3lCxaI
@longhornjules @QConteret @dismith52 There's been a popular scam going around where people legitimately pick up pets for free from shelters, make up some sob story, and sell them for profit on Craigslist.

@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk That's implying the hypothetical if it is true or not though.  Don't take it the wrong way.
@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk It really places extra scrutiny and danger on more hate crime victims indeed.  Not a fan.  Makes you question if there really was ever a deterrent in place for actions like this.
@Drewcifuer26 @Felonious_munk "You shouldn't discuss things, or criticize other viewpoints"		Speaking of cowards...  So discourse is not an option to you, lets just all sit in our own little bubbles and not share the truths that we each know at all.  You go this route, you will forever live a segregated life.
@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk You're speaking of the polarization, cause it seems theres already pro-jussie and anti-jussie camps created.  This is why I feel its harmful to worship celebrities to begin with.  I'm not gonna blindly jump into either one.  Respectfully that is what @Felonious_munk was doing.
@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk Well thats definitely a fact, I won't argue about what narratives conservative medias will push.  Although there will be a point in time where the predominately left-media will leave things out with the same intentional goals, leaving a gotcha for you later on.  Trust yourself.
@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk No I don't watch fox news, or mainly any of the corporate outlets much, if at all.  But thats the trouble with specifically left-bias or right-bias media, one side or the other is gonna be omitting facts to suit a narrative.  You have to balance both and filter out the nonsense.
@craigtpeterson1 @Felonious_munk One thing I gotta know, how did the "suspects" get the money to post bail to be released (no confirmation on how or why they were released, if we're to believe Jussie), and why were they released, if they're a danger to the public?
@mini_glik @Twitter @jack In other words, in case you misconstrued what I meant.  Are you going to invite your friends to come over?  Maybe we can talk about things, like how you live in a fantasy worldview 24/7.

@Felonious_munk You're not that sensitive to criticism are you?  I didn't ever paint you as someone that was.  Was I wrong?
@Drewcifuer26 @Felonious_munk Thanks for being honest.  Not sure how it benefits the discussion though.

@EdwardF128 @Felonious_munk Right, I'm talking about noticing something inconsistent with the main narrative.  Waiting until the media finishes up the story has never panned out well, cause sometimes they go full silence when it is no longer is a story they profit from.  They will mislead you for ratings.
@Felonious_munk I don't understand why anyone would be silent when they see something fishy going on.  This is entirely the reason why this fake hate crime hoax garbage happens.  NOBODY TALKS.  I'm not mad at you, just mad at how being a coward about it is somehow encouraged.  Call it out!

@amber_athey @AngryBlackLady Yeah I'm not even a conservative, and I agree she needs to be called out on this.  Has her nametag been satire the whole time?  Or she legitimately fabricating nonsense to get people riled up in another fake outrage.  If its the latter it needs to quit, FULL STOP.

@RobertC79159297 @RepRobinKelly @POTUS Yep, she doesn't care about any crime against humanity, only if it serves her position to power.
@RepRobinKelly @ChicagoDefender @chipublib What is your solutions to stop human trafficking completely?
@RepRobinKelly @POTUS All it is, is just shifting emergency funds from one thing to another.  I can think of many numerous times it was used for purposes that were pointless.  Its kind of funny you're getting up in a rage about it now.
@NatashaBertrand Hold up...  Isn't this proving her ability to judge the case as being biased, and is grounds for disbarment?  Need a legal analysis here.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews Same here, there's not one politician that I can align with 100% for various issues.  Wish we had a no party system, where we can pick apart individual ideological beliefs before we vote them in, so no media can collude with them cause of party affiliations.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews We would be in the same situation if McCain won, I believe that.  Maybe different policies or objections, but the investment for war in foreign territories would have been the same or worse.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews They're all friends yes, its true.  They pretend they're enemies in public, but in reality their friends in private.  Imagine all the friendships that was lost over some person choosing loyalty to one party or the other.  This is obviously what they wanted.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews Ahh the Duel Citizenship, the source of the real foreign influence in our Government.  You know I did try to corroborate some of the claims that a lot of politicians have duel citizenship with Israel.  Didn't really find much smoking gun evidence of it.  Are they hiding it?
@ak_runcible @joshtpm Have fun, sorry I misconstrued the humor.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews AIPAC seems to be a bipartisan issue, they control both sides of the aisle with lobbying.  Not an easy fix at all.  You would think the ban on foreign lobbying would end it though.
@ak_runcible @joshtpm "he's FBI, just the facts"  Thats basically what I'm saying, the individual human factor is never going away correct.  What you said is arbitrarily implying that just cause hes FBI that he can be trusted.  Appealing to authority where authority hasn't been really earned.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews Seems like they got their own class warfare there too then.  For the pro-israel, how do we protect them if we can't tell them their government is ran by murderers.  I get both sides of the argument theres radicalism,  Anti-BDS laws would make it worse.
@ak_runcible @joshtpm Like the CIA historically?  Just the "facts" hidden in all those redactions?  How many whistleblowers shall we prosecute before we realize we can't trust agencies with state secret privileges?
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews The issue is interesting, needs a bit more research.  I get the Israeli government could potentially be corrupt, but the hard-working citizens of israel.  How much do they really support the government?  I know they got a party system etc.  They had their yellowvest protests btw.
@joshtpm Could have chosen a better cover, but that's just me.
@RealJMcDonough @NBCNews I wonder, Palestine is in such a mess, their population dwindling.  Where do they go?

@thehill Ok, I gotta ask, is there a more recent photo?  People are getting crazy about proof of life nonsense.
https://t.co/KR31sgpP7w		All these reports of Human Trafficking, still blatantly getting ignored by the Mainstream.  Are your politicians doing enough to raise an alarm to this issue?  Its slavery in our own backyard and its continues to happen today.
@QConteret @SarahKSilverman @brandondarby Yes, they all should go down.  Its ironic, that politicians are trying to convince us that they care about human lives, and are against slavery, and they continue to let it happen in our own backyard.
@SarahKSilverman @brandondarby Number of cases in 2016	United States: 20,424;		California: 1,012;		Texas: 499;		Florida: 410;		Ohio: 292;		New York: 262;		Georgia: 201;		Michigan: 190;		Illinois: 153;		New Jersey: 143;		North Carolina: 140;		Nevada: 124;
@SarahKSilverman @brandondarby "Human trafficking earns profits of roughly $150 billion a year for traffickers, according to the ILO report from 2014. The following is a breakdown of profits, by sector: $99 billion from commercial sexual exploitation."
@SarahKSilverman @brandondarby There are more victims of human trafficking in the us than the yearly numbers of mass shootings.  But you know, that's all you care about is shootings, when there's an even worse crime being done to people against their will.  Its called Slavery.  https://t.co/3E3qoaT4Ct

@AmoneyResists @NitwitTV @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump "Civil Rights Champion" Is a complete lie, you don't deserve that label.  Not one human trafficking victim should be allowed.
@AmoneyResists @NitwitTV @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You act like you have some social justice imperative, even though your partisanship is literally allowing a slave trade operation happening in California.
@AmoneyResists @NitwitTV @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Yet, its not.  Human Trafficking still exists. 1/3rd of it in the US happens at the border.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LK9IiqZVIz Study by San Diego University.  Approximately 30% of undocumented workers are human trafficking victims.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It's absolutely sick, that you treat these victims as just a "statistic" when its even in our constitutional duty to end it.  The 13th amendment isn't just for the us citizens.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You don't have the conviction.  It is time to stop marginalizing human trafficking victims, and come up with a plan to stop it.  If the Wall is the only option, so be it.  Don't pretend you're making any efforts or have the moral high ground to do so.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The plan is to fix a problem that you have been letting go on for far too long in the state you were elected in.  California is basically running a Slave Trade operation with the open borders.  It needs to be stopped now.
@fawfulfan https://t.co/LK9IiqZVIz		According to a Study by San Diego University, approximately 30% of all undocumented workers in California were victims of human trafficking.  Other people call this Slavery.  Or forcing people to do things against their own will.  Whats the Dem solution?
@fawfulfan Human Trafficking.  Still a bigger problem than both, and its a bipartisan issue.  I don't buy the Democrat party has a moral high-ground in any issue until the biggest one is addressed. https://t.co/NbSa2XF4eR

@TheRealJoeShow @RealJamesWoods @tariqnasheed John Adams wrote that the "foundation of American independence was laid" on March 5, 1770.  Who was in the right at the time?  Were we just using it as a legitimate reason to get out from British Rule?  Why are modern day publications somehow downplaying that event?
@cvpayne @DaveRamsey
@joshscampbell It cancels out some of the calories you're ingesting.  FBI never taught nutrition class so that's understandable.
@thehill Welp, I can already tell whose not gonna win the Democratic Primary.
@RealJamesWoods @tariqnasheed I remember when human trafficking was a bipartisan problem, and needed to be solved.  That was 2014.  Now MSM ironically doesn't condemn it, nor help offer any viable solutions to combat it.  (The wall)  Democrats are in the same boat.  No effort is being made at all on the left.
@HeatherChilders @POTUS @GriffJenkins @FoxFriendsFirst I estimate about 30 people will show up.
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Solutions to problems are never found if you only know a single side of the issue.
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I agree with that.  The lie perpetuated, that the well established politicians have on being enemies of eachother stands to serve the purpose to keep us ideologically segregated.  A diverse society will never happen if diversity of opinion is condemned by the mainstream.
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Also, the Wall does deserve skeptism, but in reality to foreign countries is that it needs to serve as a message to the rest of the world that we don't stand for Human Trafficking, or Economic Slavery.  I've seen absolutely no effort from Democrats on stopping both of those.
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/mmEbLp9HTh
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It was supposed to be the United Nations job, but they prioritized Climate Change agenda, and inadvertantly support Human trafficking the world over.  		The oil industrial complex is a problem, which is why getting out of Syria is important.  Its a pipeline deal gone wrong.
@DaliaKilimnik @TmooreThomas @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Still happening.  After Obama's "help" for Libya, Slave trade in Africa is at record highs now.  Face it, anytime the US steps in and tries to "AID" a foreign country, we make it worse than it was previously.  Being the world's policeman has never been more pointless.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Good.  Neither are you.
@lionqueen1952 @_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald Or does that mean something to you?  Obama wasn't liberal enough to you, where you actually support left-wing radicalism in its entirety.  Something tells me, regardless whose president on either side you will never be satisfied.  You're just gonna be a violent radical.
@lionqueen1952 @_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald Sure.  I guess Trump for having a wall as his campaign promise meant nothing at all, and Obama supporting it during his Administration meant nothing either.  I guess the "Deporter in Chief" wasn't at fault at all for the xenophobia.  He gets a pass right?
@WillHDavidsonSC @brianstelter @ReliableSources Well CNN isn't the reliable place to do it unfortunately, that ship has sailed long ago when @brianstelter lost his balls to actually report things that doesn't align with his ivory tower worldview.
@JabezYaz @MileHIGHChiefs Well they're not entirely imaginary, if there's white supremacists, it's due to the MSM inadvertently creating them due to their unethical practice of journalism.   They treat issues like this as one-sided, which forces people to segregate ideologically.
@kasie @ScottWalker @MittRomney @LindseyGrahamSC You mean, you didn't have a problem.  But since you're a political hack and not a journalist, your opinion doesn't mean much to anyone either.

@StephenSterrit1 @StormyDaniels Do you just assume everything at first thought?  So, apparently according to your warped brain, the fact I don't take sides in the political cultural war, means I'm a "right-winger" is that correct?
@peterbcaster Oh one of those archetypes...  "IM GONNA TRY TO OUTSMART HIM ON TWATTER"  If you misconstrued what I meant, there's no hope for dialogue is there?

@LisbethMA @_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald There comes a point in time when you have to put aside your differences in order to pass bipartisan legislation that helps the american people overall.  This new congress hasn't been able to do that yet, that's a fact.
@LisbethMA @_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald "But it's not Congress' job to go to him...."  That is a bit silly to assume that this is a one-sided ordeal.  You can't run 2 parallel governments that are competing with each other.  The resentment from both sides is not good at all, its a literal stalemate.
@LisbethMA @_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald Same reason they don't go to him.  Both sides legitimately has too much pride.
@kurteichenwald @_R_S_S_ Well in reality, which was ironically under-reported.  Is that he has completed the first 3.  4 and 5 seem to be a work in progress.  @USACEHQ Can give you an accurate assessment of the first 3.
@SenTinaSmith Yeah I'm sure you had all the time in the world to read that 1000 page spending bill.  Yet you passed it anyway ignoring the rising national debt.
@_R_S_S_ @kurteichenwald So...  Giving a democratically elected congress time to address the situation, and them failing at it makes him the dictator?  All 3 branches of government are fighting each other, basically a scenario where nothing ever gets done, and citizens just get more angry.

@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke I'm not a "right-winger" though.  I just been noticing our society getting more polarized since Bush Jr as we went along.  Some point its gonna hit a level nobody is gonna like.
@E_A_Swearengen @charlescwcooke I hardly ever see them.  Twitter has got the parental controls turned on mine I think.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke :) Of course I don't have all the answers, I'm not gonna pretend I do.  Of course as a country/nation or what have you we should be working together to find all the solutions.  I'm sorry if you felt like I was attacking you at first.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke Oh and I appreciate the time you took to chat with me.  Not many people brave ongoing discussions on twitter.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke That's understandable, its hard to detach, and look at the opposing argument.  Which is why being a judge is a very hard profession.  They're not meant to be biased towards either side.  Which with your statement I know a lot of people feel this way.  How do we evolve from that?
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke I agree with that notion, he should do everything he can to UNITE us.  But how would you know if he was trying to unite if you only follow the ones that are intentionally dividing us as well?
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke Think about this clearly, if EVERY SINGLE thing he posted had a rapid angry hateful mob on it attacking him, its just going to get worse.  Would you somehow act nicer to a army of bullies verbally attacking you daily?  This isn't in defense of Trump at all this is common sense.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke I mean don't misconstrue or take out of context.  You can't enforce anyone to just stop tweeting or stop being stupid at all.  Only authoritarians do that.  Thing is, fighting hate with more hate only intensifies it.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke He could, but he won't so what's the point if his tweets are still getting propagated everywhere on social media etc.  Then you got an angry mob tweeting some of the same equivalent hate right back at him.  It's a cluster.
@glenn_wofford @DLoesch 1st amendment should have included this already.  Freedom of Assembly.  Interesting how they figured out a way to glorify it constantly, yet create certain legal constraints on top of it.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke Understandably, those are valid reasons, but on every single tweet seconds after and not looking into the issue?  It distracts, and makes everyone question the fact of how a journalist has all this time to troll Trump's twitter 24/7.  2 wrongs don't make a right.
@glenn_wofford @helper2 @DLoesch Yet although, what they can get away with and the amount of users on the platform, they can make the whole site a weapon for political influence to subvert opinion across the board.  Silencing those that are questioning the status quo.
@glenn_wofford @DLoesch It shouldn't though should it?  I imagine a lot of people wouldn't be so involved in sifting narrative after narrative, if politics didn't affect the community at all, that make sense?  I imagine two people can find similar interests easily, but when it comes to politics today...
@glenn_wofford @helper2 @DLoesch Sillyness.  I didn't find it offensive at all.  Proof that the guys running this Popsicle stand live in their own little bubbles, not understanding worldviews outside their own cubicle farms.
@glenn_wofford @DLoesch I like this.  Is there a possibility to have a good community without the burden of whose running the government?
@glenn_wofford @helper2 @DLoesch There was a meme posted, you missed it.  Although I think the twitter mods may have gotten to him already.
@Makinwaves3 @EdKrassen @charlescwcooke On the similarities of causing more division instead of less.  Yes they are very similar, I understand you don't see this at all, but when all you post is garbage that is constant partisan attacking (Fox news does this too) theres no real chance at unity in this culture war.
@QConteret YAY POLLS! you know how I feel about polls.  They pick polls that make them look good and use them to flex their political muscle.  Polls are for the narcissists really, not really an achievement IMO.
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner Make's sense.  There's times where I think they should just ban ticket scratchers from convenience stores cause of the time in line I have to wait until they're done picking out 8 different scratcher tickets.
@EdKrassen @charlescwcooke Feelings aside, there is a very striking similarity.  I already put you in that list long ago.
@helper2 @glenn_wofford @DLoesch Finally.
@glenn_wofford @DLoesch The guns or the criminals?  Also, they always come back which was my original point.  I'm not pushing for any sort of fantasy utopia here at all, although how do we completely deter them from doing it at all?  Secular religion? mind-control? or just good ol community building?
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner Might be a bit authoritarian, but I'll bite.  How would it work?  If you don't vote what are the consequences?
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner Agreed, maybe I'm impatient.  I hate how a lot of publications rush to push a breaking story for the clicks/views without the nitty gritty.  Also on Burr, or any politician for that matter, none of them really are gonna act 100% on good faith, its all about public opinion.
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner Let me just say, no I'm not one of those everything is 'Fake News' guys, but I do honestly believe in order to protect the integrity of the Press, they do need to do a lot better in its entirety.  I see articles all the time, if I was peer reviewing them, I'd reject.
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner I apologize, I'm a fan too.  Just not entirely involved as of late.
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner Ive been in this game far longer than you have, you can claim to be an expert in everything WWE, and I'll respect that.  Don't pretend you have authority of what actual journalism is.  You will lose, trust me.
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner https://t.co/tTxpn3ZA0R
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner I don't believe everything at first glance, sometimes it requires a bit more research.  One-sided approach isn't how actual journalists analyze before making stories. Ethical Journalism requires corroboration, do you want me to show you the tenants of ethical journalism now?
@QConteret @SenatorWarner @MarkWarner It's corporate media you expect anyone under rules of corporate policy is gonna tell all the truth?  This includes fox news too.  Let's be a bit more realistic here.
@kathygriffin Except you're not a very good one, so you being an ACTUAL comedian is up to debate.

@glenn_wofford @DLoesch A lot still come back and repeat offenses, not really a rebuttal.  Also, someone's life is only worth 5-10 years jail time?  10 years per prisoner costs an average expense of $310,000.  What's the real deterrent?
@StormResist @HawkeyeResists @AragornResists @UncannyXmen2017 @HitGirlResists @ShuriResists @tizzywoman @pru_fallows @ListenToEzra @Augustus709 @MadelyneRants Yep, we're fucked.
@vtbirkenstock @SaraCarterDC Nothing...  Absolutely unequivocally nothing.
@DLoesch Well, interestingly, tougher punishments haven't proved to be a decent deterrent for those committing the crimes.  Homicide is illegal, but it doesn't stop people from breaking that law.
@JRubinBlogger Nevermind, just noticed you're spamming the same article repeatedly.  Just stop.  Nobody cares THIS much.
@JRubinBlogger That's sweet.  Tweeting your OP-ED twice, there's already 1000's other articles like this.  Stop wasting our time.

@QConteret Any reason why its specifically only CNN reporting it?  Not exactly corroborated, other publications just citing CNN about it.  @SenatorWarner   You going to answer the phone...  EVER?
@QConteret Interesting.
@sponge4739 @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC Been saying that since they got their fame on Twitter, trolling for recognition and then pushing their click-bait circular reporting garbage.  But they're always gonna be those easily manipulated fans.  Nothing against their readers.  They just got tricked.
@AsteadWesley Horrible analogy @StefanMolyneux, a bit easy to misconstrue or take out of context.  I'm assuming what you meant to say is that Drug use is bad mkay, so is enslaving others.  The comparison looks very difficult to create between the two.  Care to try again?
@MBPRDC @lachlan Sorry, my humor is a bit dark.
@MBPRDC @lachlan There's no vaccination from gross government negligence of fiscally responsibility and justify taxing you to death to correct it.  Sad.
What a waste of time... https://t.co/l07LYuy2Lr
@BlueNGoldJoe @Gregbanks99 @Brewbom @chrislhayes Depends on what you define as "Free Trade."  Cause last I checked free trade is reciprocal.  By that I mean, a lot of social policies in foreign nations are in fact subsidized with tariffs they place on other nations.
@Brewbom @chrislhayes To reiterate, the DNC hasn't died yet, cause of their base has desperately been stoking the fire to keep it burning.  While the leaders running it keep getting caught committing political suicide.  It's like the 2 are legitimately working against each other.
@Brewbom @chrislhayes I've been saying that for a while now.  You don't even have to be defending Trump, to know that being Democrats (The party, not the voters) fundamentally have no idea how to deal with Trump, and they just simply can't do it even on merit alone.
@chrisjohnson82 @WashBlade All it takes is just one idiot, or dumb immoral worldview to dismantle a whole movement.  Good luck.
@jdandur2 @AOC @IlhanMN I'm just merely curious, not angry.  If you can't elaborate with a decent answer why did you bother answering?  You fail at this twitter thing.  Don't let your own cynicism blind you.
@JudahAriGross You have won the internet for the day sir.  Congratulations.
@JoyousPanther @AOC @IlhanMN Obviously there's no real clear definition of antisemitism anymore, now its just being used to throw around at adversaries for political points to be gained.  This is getting absurd to me.  I've yet to find anyone that can explain what exactly a "dog-whistle" is and how to notice
@jdandur2 @AOC @IlhanMN Thats a lame answer.  You have to know what the "dog-whistles" yourself in order to even assume your statement is correct.  Do you speak from experience, are you part of some nazi-cult that speak only in dog-whistles?  This is the rabbit-hole you lead people to.
@DavMicRot It's absurd to expect everyone to believe it without educating why Trump is anti-semitic.  I'll wait for your vast wealth of knowledge about it.
@AOC @IlhanMN Yet, nobody can ever seem to elaborate on exactly why Trump is "anti-semitic."  Are people dumb, or is it just not there?
@BrendanNyhan Please go in intricate and elaborate detail on exactly how these quotes are Anti-Semitic?  Is it me, or does only liberal partisan-hacks only see dog-whistles?
@PoliticsWolf One of those articles hinges completely on what the judge says, which ironically can be proved as racist.  Judges viewpoint that a drivers license isn't as obtainable for blacks as it is for whites.  No where have I seen in either of the articles state GOP admitting things. https://t.co/NXjQkO2ATP
@repcleaver Oh it's WaPo...  Nevermind.
@jburnmurdoch @PoliticsWolf Hold up, soo... @PoliticsWolf won't concede or disagree with the findings, although will jump in the voter suppression bandwagon narrative cause some GOP members said some mean things?  Seems a bit of a childish thought pattern to me.
@sarahkendzior @docrocktex26 Is she ever going to answer?  Figures.  Just like all the other bluecheck maniacs propagating nonsense without any further thought to the matter.
@letamericavote Prove it.  Or just make statements without backing up with facts or logic.
@sarahkendzior @docrocktex26 Can you please elaborate on how those votes were "suppressed?"  Feel free to pretend you're somehow an expert.  I'll wait.
@PoliticsWolf @PILFoundation
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Never gonna let that one go are you?  Wew.  North Korea also said they're gonna nuke the US, but you don't see me repeating it ad-nauseam.
@PeterDawsonUSA @Heritage There's already a Harvard and also a Stanford study about that.  Not exactly what you're looking for but it debunks the effectiveness of Russian propaganda influencing the 2016 election.  @Twitter has its own analysis that contradicts it.
https://t.co/3zQllyyc1Q		Ok, Florida Man you're getting quite scary, go back to raping alligators.
@KamalaHarris Cool.  Which ones?  What are their names?  I'm convinced you have no clue.
@democracynow No thx, not unless I want ruin my career.
@Maxxflyy @shaunking @Alabama_Voodoo @AOC Socialism doesn't exist, and will never exist.  In reality its more like lighting money on fire until everyone complains they're starving.
@Rocknboxmatchm1 @shaunking @Alabama_Voodoo @AOC Correct, we haven't at all.  Politicians on both sides of the aisle either can't math right, or are gaming the system for special interests.  A lot of money goes into it from our hands, and most of us don't see it ever coming back.
@AOC Is this when you gonna learn that the whole financial industry is privatized, and the federal reserve regulates the currency and is in fact not really "federal."
@shaunking @Alabama_Voodoo @AOC Her ideas aren't dangerous, they're just realistically unfeasible economically.  There's quite a few variables that have to be met for them to work at all, she addresses none of those.
@JKeds98 @shaunking @AOC Such as?
@shaunking @AOC Why are they scared again? Please elaborate.
@lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Actually she is being investigated again ironically. Thought people with bluechecks are supposed to be smart?
@ericuman @JustinElliott @ilyamarritz Nobody? Seriously?
@ericuman @JustinElliott @ilyamarritz I've been digging through the FEC laws, and this one seems to be one giant loophole not covered, as in it may actually not be an official crime.  Anyone find it yet?
@DavMicRot @PredictWise It's undoubtedly a horse race, corporate media lives by it unfortunately, and they use it for narcissistic tier muscle flexing.  "Look at those poll numbers from a small survey of 100 people!"
@LaDemos You forgot to mention he was Republican, since somehow a great amount of people are obsessed with the myth that Democrats can't be racist.
“For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0.7 percent of Clinton voters and non-voters who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, a persuasion rate equivalent to seeing 36 television campaign ads.”

@Jerrodburkesgm1 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump No not really.  Please tell me you own a gun though. There's a lot of psychopaths on twitter.
@Jerrodburkesgm1 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I gotta ask, it's not relevant though.  But why are you posting your email as your id?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It wasn't THAT great.  She's married to a real estate millionaire, I don't think you have a decent chance, although I gotta question your choices in women.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Your brother not talking to you anymore, so you gotta talk to yourself?
@DavMicRot @DonaldJTrumpJr You know I always thought cyber-security itself was American.  Although after the many times the DNC got ass-raped by Chinese hackers throughout the years, and CIA agents getting assassinated under Obama admin.  The American thing to do is to vote idiots in to power now.
@DavMicRot Old Fashioned
@EricHolder What's difficult about it?  The Democrat party in it's entirety has encouraged the use of identity politics to levels where we're calling anyone and everyone racist without merit.  Then when an actual racist comes along, you think we need to "talk."   I've learned enough.
@DavMicRot I think it's safe to assume that David doesn't like guns.  Am I wrong?
@vnbateman This is an old "feed me your attention" tactic.  It really clouds the issue at hand and historically has reversed perceptions of what you support into the opposite.  I'd suggest other methods, but it's a bit too late now.
@PoliticalAnim13 @psiikik @FlaDems Irrelevant.  But you're proving my point, failed liberal teacher can't critically think, consider the consequence of not teaching and forcing memory retention on students.

@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @nytimes @FoxNews https://t.co/gvTsvtcmbo		@democracynow Pulling the same garbage in Unison with corporate henchmen media.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  WHERE'S THE DOCUMENTS.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @nytimes https://t.co/0VISCzwnWz  BAHAHAHA You too @FoxNews You basically have the same article, doing victory dances of the supposed "documents" but never provided "documents".  Corporate media in its entirety is absolutely disgusting.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @nytimes Welp, this confirms why journalism is dead, pretty much everyone becomes a conspiratard by omitting the docs, or making things up constantly.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin Absolutely drives me bonkers when NYT's doesn't link the CIA documents they're referring to.  @nytimes You been doing this nonsense since 2002 or before.  https://t.co/hCP4w6MPeb
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal @intercepted @democracynow That's your opinion on the matter and I respect it.  However I follow the money, and its not pretty for democracy now.  I can't go running around citing them, as they get discredited horrendously.  When a NPO doesn't have funding, they can be very easily controlled by big donors.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal @intercepted Ok, you're killing me.  I can't be expected to be trusting billionaire funded sources by proven ideologues.  That is in part just as bad as trusting all the pro-trump stuff, don't make me choose either one please.  Is there anything neutral at all with this rabbit hole?
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal @intercepted Jan 2019 article...  I'm disturbed if it is true at all, that not a single FOIA request was even submitted after all this time.  What does that say?   Government sponsored co-up's take a lot of time if its just propaganda. Fake news doesn't subvert a population overnight.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal Give me something solid and trustworthy here friend. https://t.co/g8RkwlBZf8
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal Trying to stay away from being conspiratorial here basically.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin @GrayzoneProject @BenjaminNorton @MaxBlumenthal So...  No collaborating evidence then?  I kind of need something solid not exactly talking heads, no offense here.  Others can go so far as to reach that @AbbyMartin was paid by the Latin Government under the table for a disinformation campaign with the same logic.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin Those are sanctions, not necessarily sponsorship.  You would think russia would have its own civil unrest with all the sanctions we put on them.  One can even argue that they just weren't self-sufficient enough economically and blaming sanctions isn't justified.
@Suspended_Acct @AbbyMartin Ok, so is there any actual collaborating evidence that the US is indeed sponsoring the unrest?
@Suspended_Acct @YouTube Will watch, 22 minutes though.  Eww.
@Suspended_Acct I suppose the philosophical question comes to mind.  Where is the line drawn where the people being oppressed and forced to starve has to legitimately take up arms against the government for their own survival?  At what point is it morally justified?

@LiamConverse @DavMicRot @HowardSchultz @CNN The reality of how 2020 is gonna really go.  The democrat party is so much of a cluster of varying degrees of ideology, that the only thing that legitimately unites them is anti-Trump things.  Doesn't look like a recipe of success to me.
@DavMicRot @LiamConverse @HowardSchultz @CNN Of course not, they mostly have two-tiered healthcare systems anyway  Both Public (tax-payer funded) and Private.  Some instances the private care systems are better suited for people that prefer quality treatment.  Although I believe that the government negotiates prices.
@DavMicRot @LiamConverse @HowardSchultz @CNN Interesting, I like where this is potentially going.  So let me get this right, you want the humanitarian notions of social programs, though you don't want to sacrifice the ingenuity and innovation the people can potentially create with balanced incentives for success.  Correct?
@DavMicRot You did the monthly recurring donation didn't you.
@LiamConverse @DavMicRot @HowardSchultz @CNN Nah, he just has an undying love for everything democrat for some odd reason.  We can try to sit him down for an intervention some day, maybe.  I think he would enjoy it, we'll let him rant about the GOP the whole time and we can sit there staring blankly being non-responsive.
@politico Good job politico for making it a story about yourselves cause of partisan-motivated semantics.
@nprpolitics I hope that covington lawsuit humbles you, and you stop being partisan idiots.  But then again that won't ever end, NPR will still be collecting money from Democrat Mega-donors, like the one with random dead black guys in their homes.
Reminder:  This is Virginia Governor Northam's attack ad on Ed Gillespie. It should be a painfully obvious fact to everyone by now, that Racists indeed use identity politics to further their own agenda, it's sad that Virginia has fell for it.  https://t.co/iJuVGSAZ5j
@kasie So wait, wasn't it the media so focused on getting these racists elected by being complete partisan-hacks?  Good job, not looking good for you.
@fawfulfan Fiet currency, welfare handouts, obamacare mandate, monopolies, I can continue if you want.
@fawfulfan Its missing the 3rd challenge.  Quality.  If there's no incentive to provide good quality healthcare, pushing the single-payer package is gonna look pretty stupid.  Example:  people prefer to pay 4 times the price in India to Private industry, to avoid lousy public healthcare.
@Lukewearechange It's ironic how many people don't see past the "solutions" some people create, while there is a huge problematic outcome that "solution" will create.  It's literally band-aid politics.  This endless cycle of band-aid fixes will end up being worse for Hawaii.

@Kokomothegreat Are you phone-posting or something?
@DavMicRot Whats the general cause of all 3 of those factors?  I would like to hear a decent analysis, and how to improve it.
@DavMicRot Research concludes, that the majority of the issue that ties in to the 700 pregnancy related deaths per year is mainly caused by poor Provider, poor Systems of care, and patients having poor health or mental issues.  A very small fraction is caused by poor facilities used. https://t.co/o5WeFakrak

@DavMicRot @Kerri_Kupec Acting AG Whitaker?  Are we sure this isn't one of those rabbit-holes we're led to believe for partisan points?  I like to keep my foot on reality, no offense David.
@DavMicRot @Kerri_Kupec Apparently you're a degenerate liar, got any response to this?  I request that you avoid any defamation lawsuit on David, hes mainly satire so to speak.
@fawfulfan Prostitution will still be legal in some states.
@DavMicRot Privatized healthcare is still however more popular globally. 	 Look at india, they have a hybrid of both and 80% of the public still use privatized healthcare.  Why?  My analysis assumes its the lack of incentives to provide good quality healthcare with the public sector.
@DavMicRot @DanCrenshawTX Ireland makes really good whiskey still.  Have you seen how trans-formative their economy was after dropping tax rates?
@tashimom @Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra The sex education bit is at best trivial, it doesn't unfortunately prove one way or the other to reduce teen pregnancies.  Abstinence-only education proves it doesn't work either.  https://t.co/IHaGoy8jKH
@ForecasterEnten Warren might be off the list soon, Robert Barnes defamation lawsuit will most-likely eat up her finances on campaigning for 2020.
@ForecasterEnten 50% of democrats still support the clown after that?  I have to wonder if the polling is made up now.  Thoughts?
@DoellaG @DavMicRot A lot of people do actually.  Possibly being irrelevant here, have you seen all the grandstanding whenever there's a congressional hearing?  It's disturbing how much of it you see whenever a politician is given the spotlight.
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra Yeah, its scary that we may have inadvertently created a abortion-industrial-complex with Planned Parenthood.  Their quality of care is dwarfed by many numerous private ObGyn clinics.
@DavMicRot @Easterly151954 @namalhotra Well that's generally a lot of people, which makes intelligent people cynical of the masses, as they're not thinking outside the box or use critical thinking to determine why one problem is that way without looking at the factors or variables leading to that one problem.
@DavMicRot @Easterly151954 @namalhotra I would like to hear the method or solutions in getting the former completed, without turning us into a authoritarian state.  For example:  Firing all doctors without nutrition education, would have a negative impact, as those doctors are needed in their current positions.
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra David seems to be acknowledging a problem that conservatives holistically ignore for their partisan pro-life agenda.  In effect, liberal and conservative brains are wired differently, finding a compromise to fix a problem is growing more difficult with people being hyperpartisan.
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra https://t.co/jppXOqECjj		So obviously this is a problem, public schools aren't teaching it, higher education isn't requiring it for medical doctors.  How do we inform the masses that they need to eat healthy?
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra It seems we have been caught going after short-term solutions to problems that arise.  People will mask an obesity epidemic by calling it fat-shaming and think the problem will go away, which only makes it worse in reality.  Effectively making health issues increase in society.
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra In defense of David, I wouldn't say hes agreeing to it 100%.  Just the band-aid fix of a problem that is growing, while we determine where the source of the problem is.  Me personally, I don't like band-aid fixes, usually the band-aids never leave.
@DavMicRot @Easterly151954 @namalhotra David Eisenberg has done the research about the lack of nutrition classes in modern medical schools in the US.  I hate to wonder what the resulting outcome is, for removing a curriculum that should be vitally important, as a lot of issues/diseases is related to malnutrition.
@Easterly151954 @CaMaeDaisy @DavMicRot I'm not pro-death myself, its just hard to find an alternative solution in reality.  I find brain scrambling a bit more horrible.
@DavMicRot @Easterly151954 @namalhotra How many of those cases do we see are a result of malnutrition.  Is it possible for a pregnant women to go all 9 months on McDonald's alone with no issues?
@DavMicRot @Easterly151954 @namalhotra Thanks for replying @DavMicRot.  I haven't found much sources solidifying those.  But if true, can a decay in education/training and higher-costs of education be contributing factors to that?  Note:  Only 1/3rd of Doctors graduating today have taken any nutrition classes.
@CaMaeDaisy @Easterly151954 @DavMicRot Of course it is extreme, its meant to be as such.  The deterrent isn't supposed to be a slap on the wrist when they have done far worse against humanity.  Thing is, our methods of execution we use is more expensive than life imprisonment in most cases.
@Easterly151954 @DavMicRot @namalhotra Interestingly, the problem is also aligned with career/schooling/time.  A lot of abortion clients surveyed don't want to sacrifice some ambitions for a new child they'll have to devote all of their time to.  Hypersexualization of culture is causing everyone to be more hedonistic.
@Easterly151954 @CaMaeDaisy @DavMicRot The argument for the pro-death penalty is the repeat offenses criminals continuously commit.  Criminal Psychology is a very interesting subject to research on this case.  Mainly its due to a lack of deterrent, most violent criminals only communicate with violence, what's the fix?
@DavMicRot I fear you're letting your favoritism towards democrats, skew your opinion.  I'm willing to discuss all matters of this if you're free to do so.  One thing we should be prepared for is some democrat backdooring the party to push a radical ideology unacceptable to both sides.
@DavMicRot @namalhotra The interesting thing, is if you look at Guttmacher's research on the deciding theme of most abortions, can be mainly attributed to financial or economic sense.  The corporate media ignores the possibility that abortion issue wouldn't be an issue if they can afford children.
@fritz_shea @Alison8675309 @Kimberlyrenee62 @MzWakeNBaker @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Well then there's others, that are radicalized of some nature that don't share the same goal neither liberals or conservatives have.  Interestingly, corporate media continuously fails to call them out and condemn their toxic ideologies.
@DavMicRot Cheers.
@fritz_shea @Alison8675309 @Kimberlyrenee62 @MzWakeNBaker @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Nobody has noticed that liberals and conservatives have the same end goal for a problem, but still people are bickering over the method or implementation to solve that problem.  Questions I have for each.  Do all Liberal solutions work?  Do all conservative solutions work?

@schensuz @GetaGripDumbass @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy Nope it doesn't you're right.  Thing is it doesnt even matter, you're still gonna go back to your echo chambers again and continue accepting everything you're told as fact, go into your daily fake outrage for no reason and then wonder why our culture is divided.
@schensuz @GetaGripDumbass @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy I'm only here to target the bluecheck liars, you didn't offend me.  All the idiots seem to continue to worship them daily without a even a remote thought to check to see if they're right or wrong.  Good job for joining the herd mentality olympics.
@schensuz @GetaGripDumbass @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy Want me to read for you too?  Decode legalese, and put in 3rd grade English?  It's absolutely absurd how many people refuse to research for themselves and accept everything as fact from political clowns while everyone around them both left and right is getting radicalized.

@GetaGripDumbass @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods I trust they're smart, sometimes they can't afford decent so they choose the lesser qualified alternatives, putting themselves at greater risk.
@GetaGripDumbass @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods Hah no sweetie, thanks for your concern though.  And you're right its the Woman's choice to decide that, the problem is when they screw something up, and the liability falls on the woman not the nurse/midwife.
@fawfulfan Thats enough to kill 10% of americans fatally.  Not an emergency right?  Lets focus on the measles thing, even though barely nobody dies from it.  Good job declaring health emergencies Washington and Oregon.
@GetaGripDumbass @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy Only in non-surgical abortions.  Are you that blind?  Trust me they can figure out how to abort your fetus without surgery.
@KimKimwiden @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods The question you actually NEED to be asking.  Do you trust a "worker" at an abortion clinic, or a Obstetrician that spend their whole career in woman's health more?
@KimKimwiden @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods For fucks sake, I never conceded or admitted either.  You haven't read a single reply have you?  Don't put words in my mouth.  The Majority of abortions are not preformed or determined by actualy physicians at all.  READ https://t.co/92te5yCfBk
@KimKimwiden @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods They're not, absolutely not better qualified.  This bill proves it, its a dumb question, doesn't really deserve an answer in reality.  The more the idiots running our government try to fix things, the more they screw something else up.  They don't see things outside the box ever.
@TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods There's other material as well.  Shall I hold your hand and read things out-loud for you too?
@BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy Talk about the mother's safety all you want, but I must implore you, nurse ratchet isn't qualified to know what to do in case of an issue.  Case in point they're not ObGyn's.
@BethReads @JohnGreenwoods @TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy intrapartum issues in pregnancy is already rare, having a doctor coming up with the best treatment options for you is vitally important.  The new abortion legislations ignore the latter.
@TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods "Why its viable":  Gee whiz, I don't know maybe cause its funded by actual Doctors?
@TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods Seriously want me to hold your hand to do the research for you?  Isn't that what people let "FB and youtube" do for them?  God you're a hypocritical fuck you do know that right?    https://t.co/JzAMoboKk8		This is 2017.  Only 7%
@TheRealTheDavey @fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods For fucks sake, coming up with that rebuttal is absolutely a cop-out.  I come up with my own analysis.  In 1985 only 34% of abortions were preformed by obstetricians.  Has it changed much since then?
@fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods All the morons liking his post, have completely ignored the facts thats been going on for ages.  ObGyn's don't have to make the determination, not unless its mandated by state law.  Go do your own research, don't worship this partisan clown.
@fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods You haven't read the legislation at all have you?  A midwife can even make the determination, and also there IS NO obstetricians at planned parenthood clinics.  Trust me I called and asked.  This bill was all about more access and profit for abortions, not at all about health.
@fawfulfan @oneplainGuy @BethReads @JohnGreenwoods What and who determines how the fetus is "viable" though.  That part of the legislation you completely omitted.  (Purposefully or Unknowingly, I don't care either way.)  Its lunacy to think its about "woman's health" when in fact they are surrendering it to unqualified nurses.
@SharylAttkisson https://t.co/N1vEARhbmx		Here's what we discovered in 2014 on antiviral research for Measles.  It apparently works, however its not manufactured due to the return of investment, the "outbreaks" in the US is too small, too irrelevant to make a profit.
@SharylAttkisson In any other circumstance Anti-viral has always been better than vaccinations when contracting a disease.  I feel that the CDC and most Doctors have forgotten this, so the funding balance of Vaccine and Antiviral got heavily skewed towards vaccines.
@12voltman60 @michellemalkin Pretty much.
@Sur5r_1 @CDCFlu @CDCemergency @US_FDA My question is why they are so heavily obsessed with vaccinations when they have all the tools and research to work on antivirals.  Its like they aren't even preparing for IF the epidemic actually happens, just furiously trying to prevent it.
@EllynThomps Also.  Measles are NOT deadly, no matter how much you spin it.  Try looking at treatment options first.  There's no "buy a casket" in the treatment.  Big Pharma spends more on vaccines than on antivirals, ask yourself why.
@EllynThomps K, I'll stop being angry at the dumb dumb people.  There's no vaccine for that I'm sorry.  Continue your destiny of being willfully ignorant.
@12voltman60 @michellemalkin So reiterating, it's not about the women's health or choice is all about access to more abortions for profit.
@12voltman60 @michellemalkin Incorrect.		They are being preformed legally by non certified doctors with no training in any surgical procedures now according to the new legislation.  So yeah, nurse ratchet the "medical professional" is doing abortions now.
@EllynThomps Facts that are completely irrelevant.  Be mad all you want.  That's not gonna fix your stupidity.
@ebarteldes @EllynThomps @nytimes You're an idiot.  The 26th amendment is the right to vote.
@EllynThomps Stupid question.  If you're unable to ascertain and notice fear propaganda pushed by MSM and discredit others independent journalists are trying to expose to you, you indeed become part of the problem, not the solution.  What's deadlier, illegal immigration or measles?
@EllynThomps @CBSNews 2015 article.  Did they die?  No.  		You're not getting the point at all, for some odd reason you think it's an anti-vaxxer thing.
@EllynThomps Shut the fuck up.   Barely anyone dies from measles, except for the malnourished.   0.1% chance of death in the United States.   Fucking @CBSNews How about the Ebola Virus?  Theres a real problem right there.

@LLCoolSA @cliffsatton @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Give yourself a vacation to the Florida Panhandle.  Destin FL is a good Deep Sea fishing village, good chance at interactions there.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Same, nothing surprises me at all, I lived all over in this country, got a chance to see many different worldviews.  Anyone that just calls the Midwest fly-over states, seem to be caught up in herd mentalities.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune They were ironically pretty well read about it, their understanding was that the federal government shouldn't have full authoritative control over most if not all state's laws.  Their disagreement with the union was that they didn't make it about slavery when it started.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune I lived in Louisiana for about 6 years, I've actually met a few lol.
@jonspaihts @Resister19681 @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Yes I read them.  I'm also aware of other historical articles, that exposes a not so simple narrative of this.  In reality its really both about states rights and slavery.  Neither are wrong.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune The broad brush by mainstream corporate journalism is starting to get a bit too far IMO.  A lot of people fall victim to it, thinking that its all just black and white.  When in reality its just a symptom of the current political cultural war. https://t.co/d6e7bt0QmA
@stevenjwhite @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Sanctuary Cities/States, is the blindingly obvious one.  Black people are still treated worse judicially speaking than undocumented immigrants.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Still though, need to discuss why we need to arbitrary label all the pro-confederates as racists though, as you notice there definitely is quite a few that can be easily mislead one way or another.  Do we believe in a diverse set of cultural values that we should be doing this?
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune I concede, you're right, I just wanted to disagree with something.
@LLCoolSA @cliffsatton @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune So is it possible to be pro-confederate in support of the 10th amendment, and not it be about the slavery issue?
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Well people don't listen very well when they're immersed in their own cognitive biases trying to argue that their worldview is right and all others are wrong.
@cliffsatton @LLCoolSA @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune So basically with that said, both are correct.  It was about States Rights AND about Slavery.  To think all these people thought the war was just so simple.
@cliffsatton @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Is Howard Cecil Perkins credible?
@Ironiclast490 @LLCoolSA @Denisec67527755 @Resister19681 @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Agreed, go make a thread and link it.  :D
@cliffsatton @Resister19681 @RadicalGoats @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune I'm listening.  Go forth and throw the chronicle of events at us.  Did the South attack first?
@cliffsatton @Resister19681 @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Can't we all just get along?
@Denisec67527755 @Resister19681 @Ironiclast490 @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Well it is in fact another popular myth that the Union went to war to end slavery.  South fought for slaves, the Union went to war at first to keep the nation held together, and then it ended up being about slavery for the North's convictions.
@LLCoolSA @cliffsatton @Resister19681 @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Its interesting how it only covers the leaders of those states etc.  Simplicity sake, its good for a quick non-enthusiastic understanding of it for quick debates.  @KevinMKruse You have any background knowledge of why the non-slave owners of the south would even go to war at all?
@fawfulfan @RadicalGoats @Resister19681 @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Well slavery still exists, so maybe we should do it again for old time's sake?  Waitresses and Bartenders are modern day economic slaves in the US, lets free them from the evil slave-driving Restaurants. What do you say?
@jonspaihts @Resister19681 @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Screw it, lets settle it once and for all.  Was it about states rights or slavery?  I know there's historians out there that will argue for states rights.  Maybe they'll jump in, with their research sources.  This time we should be nice and not throw ad-hominems this time...
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Nah, the people that died in all of the hardships make up the history of the country.  Leaders are just figureheads, and everyone had to deal with all their difficult decisions as we carried through hardship after hardship.
@Resister19681 @fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune This particular debate has been going on for decades.  I got love letters from Lee to Lincoln that says one thing, and history books saying another.  Which is more accurate?
@fawfulfan @LLCoolSA @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Certain people in this thread, are pushing the idea or notion that not wanting to take down certain statues automatically means they're racist. I find it intriguing that inanimate objects can cause this much drama.  I don't care either way, just put it in a history museum.
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune I don't celebrate either, whats the point in worshipping either side again?  Abe Lincoln isn't Jesus nor is Robert E Lee.  The Hero Worship is complete societal decay and meant for political manipulation.
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune The whole entire civil war was a stain, more so than you realize, or even read.  Teaching of american civil war history at public education isn't as good as it used to be.  Which equates the younger population to being even more dumbed down, like yourself.
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Here we go, glorifying one side or the other...  You are aware Lincoln wasn't originally a abolitionist, nor did he believe that blacks and whites should be equal.  In fact if you do some research at the Library of Congress, you would find out that he wanted to deport blacks.
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune Well the argument is more valid than you think or willing to admit.  You honestly think half the country is racist, I don't agree, and I'm asking for proof that your worldview isn't cancer to an already divided nation. https://t.co/DLGxyR3NKm
@LLCoolSA @fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune You know it wasn't long ago (A WEEK AGO), that all sorts of journalists were pushing the idea that Racist parents raise racist kids, so are we contradicting the whole MSM narrative of the covington ordeal now?
@PamRVLifeTX @fawfulfan @bitstory @TexasTribune Yeah, collectively not very many hardcore Democratic Cultist ever knows or talks about it, but they hold the reigning lead on Dynasties in politics.  Its absurd to call them non-establishment at this point.
@fawfulfan @bitstory @PamRVLifeTX @TexasTribune I remember when Nancy Pelosi's dad lobbied for funding to put some of these Confederate Statues in.  Interesting how we end up full circle, the Dems funding racist things, and then end up trying to hide their racist things, and somehow people keep voting in their dynasties.
@LisaDNews @USCBO Syria pullout would save us according to DOD estimates of $15.3 billion yearly.	Afghanistan pullout (unconfirmed in reality) would save us $45 billion per year.

@ScottMGreer Appreciate the response.  I suppose it's one tiny example, where Big Tech is gonna have to focus on taking out a newbie congressgirl to protect their wealthy empires.  I like it, get their focus off us for a second.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister Right.  Somehow I'm a bot, this is exactly where the uneducated devolve to when they feel inferior to another intellectually. 		1.  It's not hard to make a correlation between you going to school and educated.  Not unless you view them differently.		2.  Irrelevant.		Good night.
@ScottMGreer Why though?  I don't Like AOC but shouldn't we tell her that breaking up monopolies isn't communism?
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister Thought you were "educated", can't read above 3rd grade literature now?  I'll take this as a concession, since you seem to be too willfully ignorant to read things outside your own normal comprehension.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister That response is a bit of a copout.  Glad we agree I suppose, although a feller from the UK using a false bout of accomplishment from 80 years ago is bordering on narcissism.  I can use the toilet, but I'm not gonna pretend it's an achievement.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister My point is, that not everything from the history channel is 100% accurate.  It's not all rainbows and flowers, mainstream culture spends a lot of time painting things pretty for our consumption so we aren't triggered by actual reality.  It's manipulative madness for the masses.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister Cool, so killing women and children and arming your rebels using Russian resources is an Icon to you, that's sounds like a great human being to me.  I think Trump would like to meet you.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister You haven't really looked into Mandela's full history have you? 	 Again the hero worship has you too blinded. All history is relevant regardless if you enjoy it or not.  Creating historical icon cults is like manufacturing another religion.
@SNOWSTER34 @magwitch5151 @toadmeister "No you miss the point."  Many don't understand history and that's where they completely end up blinded by letting mainstream praise Churchill and constantly ignore his misdeeds.  We need stop the hero worship and prevent redoing past mistakes.

@TheBoltUpright @AdamParkhomenko Here's where the whole thing gets a bit iffy though, buzzfeed released the report, and then also released above statement from Peter Carr.  Without sourcing or providing verified document or materials.  Why is Buzzfeed somehow the gatekeeper of information on this one?
@TheBoltUpright @AdamParkhomenko "BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate"  Seems a bit straight-forward to me.
@TheBoltUpright @AdamParkhomenko I'll concede to you being correct in that.  Buzzfeed still hasn't retracted the story after Mueller has refuted it.  I just don't wanna get everyone all jaded and resentful towards factual reporting of things like this before it happens.

@mini_van @suzy1493 Wew, you gotta stop losing arguments with a cat on twitter.  I know you're bored, and sometimes its fun for you to accuse poor little furballs on twitter of using illegal drugs, which I can attest with anecdotal evidence that there is no drug done by this cat.  Ever.  Clean Kitty
@mini_van @suzy1493 Girl, I have no clue who taught you in English/Literature class, but they need to be fired.  Accusing is charging someone with an offense or crime.  Where did you go to school at, people need their money back.
@mini_van @suzy1493 I don't think you're a dumb bitch, but assuming and name-calling does meet the same criteria.  If I called you fat or on drugs without any empirical evidence,  yes that's assuming.  If there is slight evidence of you being fat or on drugs, that would be presuming.   Thanks.
@mini_van @suzy1493 "I didn’t assume you were on drugs. I straight up said it."  You really think I'm this stupid?  So if I said "You're a dumb bitch" That's not assuming?		I can see right through this idiotic logic of yours.
@mini_van @suzy1493 Let me get this straight, both of you agree about Kamela Harris but you're in a debate about her anyway?  Also, you assumed Carol wasn't a black woman, and also assumed I was on drugs.  Both are largely inadequate assumptions that have nothing corroborating it.  You love assuming
@mini_van @suzy1493 Understandable, losing an argument to a cat on the internet does seem pretty bad...
@mini_van @suzy1493 I never explicitly agreed to the statistics she stated, but what alarms me is that you seem to be ALL IN on Kamela Harris like shes the savior of the white race.  Literally no pun intended.
@mini_van @suzy1493 So admittedly your reading level is below 3rd grade then?  Ok, gotcha.

@mini_van @suzy1493 Hold up, are you talking about all those mainstream articles that get retracted constantly?  Ever heard of circular reporting?  Just wondering.
@mini_van @suzy1493 Thought we were discussing Kamela Harris?...  Now we got some mud-slinging.  I'll go make popcorn, this might be funny or ugly...  Not sure yet.
@suzy1493 @mini_van @blackvoices I don't trust statistics much, but I know the issue exists.  Other than that I know her history in California as DA and AG, is gonna get fully exposed if she wins the primaries, and its gonna be a big giant NO from the black community.

Where is she btw? https://t.co/3GTP3MkuVf
@mkdholsters @UnclePecos3 @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump More like an edgy kid rebelling on the forced societal pressures of being included on social media.  Of course he doesn't have a job, most millennials don't, all the previous generations before him created the situation he's in by constantly voting in the criminal elites.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump "Le 16 year old doomer"
@mkdholsters @UnclePecos3 @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump In his defense, he's not on Twitter to be serious.  Just here for the bants mainly, I know this archetype, and the only thing he's effective at what he's doing is desensitizing you to the same lunatic mainstream insults you deal with already.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump It was largely ineffective, kudos for trying though.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump Wew, so resorting to name-calling the opposition to a class of people you obviously have biased prejudice against.  What do you gain from this, besides looking like a troll?
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump Still the name-calling.  Yet somehow I'm the stupid one.  Interesting, do you think name-calling is an effective strategy to debating your points?  It's obviously hasn't changed anyones mind here.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump Let me guess, you don't like me cause I called you white and racist.  You ever wonder why you don't have any friends?
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump So basically you're a self-hating white American then.  There's plenty of people you can see to help you with your mental health issues.  Don't be ashamed to seek help.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump "I'm a refugee from a ethnostate, so my lack of anecdotal evidence of race issues means I'm an authority figure in calling everyone I don't like racist."		Pot calling the kettle black.
@UnclePecos3 @mkdholsters @rn_gal @MikeJBarnes @KayaJones @RepAOC @realDonaldTrump Oh look it's another one of those, "i don't like you, so you must be white" rhetorics that infected too many people.  Question is there racial division in a all-Hispanic country?

@ADmomof3 @TwitmoDenizen @JonahNRO Well I actually appreciate left vs left, and right vs right.

We cant move forward blindly following someone's ideas cause we like them.
@ADmomof3 @TwitmoDenizen @JonahNRO Well the political climate we're in today, has got everyone slinging shots at eachother.  I guess its getting harder to filter out between reasonable criticisms and blatant smear campaigns.
@ADmomof3 @TwitmoDenizen @JonahNRO Oh ok, you're a diehard Tucker fan.  Fair enough.  Im just not into the celebrity worship thing.  Tucker has some good qualities yes, but Im not gonna vote for him as President, hes too "DC" for me.  Thanks for responding.
@ADmomof3 @TwitmoDenizen @JonahNRO Ok...

@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer That makes logical sense, I just can't do it though, her history of being bipartisan in a split congress is lacking greatly.  When we need something in the nation done, we can't depend on her to look past politics and self-interested power.  Shes wealthy, and ideologically broken
@Bishopspawn11 @EdKrassen Oh and to answer the claim about doing or not doing what I do, I data harvest mainly, from a separate twitter sanctioned account.
@Bishopspawn11 @EdKrassen Everyone including all the bluecheckers on twitter are snarky, I'd say I fit in really well.
@Bishopspawn11 @EdKrassen You think so?  Maybe I should become another crooked politician and get that body guard detail.  What you think?  I might write a book after called "How to become rich.  Step 1.  Become a politician."

@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer Me too to be honest, China owns most seaports in Seattle and Portland, and there is too much angst among Immigration and DEA officials there, for them to get anything done.

@EdKrassen 1/9/2019:  Krassenstein says to arrest half the country placing words together in ulterior motives.
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer Good find.  You know its pretty easy in hopping those fences, just last year though the new border wall prototype, was getting praises by DHS, as way more effective.  Analogy: Its kind of like trying to keep a dog fenced in the backyard, and addressing mistakes as you go.
@RepSpeier @POTUS You fail at life, just fund border security.  You never appropriated funds for this, get off your ivory tower, and help law enforcement by DOING something, not nothing. https://t.co/EVrLJkt2iT

@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer Just like to add, that yeah those drugs were caught at port of entry, but imagine the huge area that isn't monitored, isn't funded enough to guard, and the magnitude that comes in unreported, cause you guessed it, funding.  LEO's are working way too hard on this.  I support them.
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer It does, I assume its the continuous finger-pointing from both sides playing politics, and worried about economy nonsense.  When you look at the recently failed DOD audit, its really hard to justify giving the government more money from our pockets, if they can't fix their own.
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer Actually yes.  HR. 6061 109th Congress.  Secure Fence Act.  The problem has always been funding for border security.  You can't have any of the drone tech, or fencing or whatever it is, without appropriating funds. Thanks for conversing btw. https://t.co/hKBij3BzMT
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly @SenSchumer They did it for votes then to stay in power, and they're playing their games again for votes to stay in power.  There hasn't been any intention funding border security, its all been a blatant lie by politicians sitting in ivory towers while getting the best medical care.
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly Here some education, this bill was Passed with bipartisan support in 2006 Intended to cost $50 billion over 25 years with all your proposed bells and whistles INCLUDING a border fence.  Not enough funds were ever appropriated for it. @SenSchumer https://t.co/tXWXgpeGm6
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly Let me ask you this.  What exactly are you resisting?  More drug seizures of the most deadliest opiod coming in?
@Tidy_Tim @tonyposnanski @BillOReilly "CBP said fentanyl seizures are trending up. Officers seized 440 pounds nationally in 2016, and that number grew to 951 pounds in 2017, and it has risen to 984 pounds through April 2018."  More marginalizing cause its apparently cool to be a partisan-hack.  Good job.

@CChristineFair @J0HNST0N No they're not accepted those "drone strikes" have created more resentment among Pakistanis, discredited US diplomacy and radicalized more towards India in the process. This just proves you internalized this the whole time. Your narcissism became your downfall.
@drawandstrike Congress still has to vote on the trade deal btw.
@QConteret @megynkelly Yeah too much politics can slow a nation to a crawl, and the people not sitting in congress all end up taking the beatings.  Those ivory tower lunatics still get a salary while its shut down.
@QConteret @megynkelly It took shutting down a government to bring the issue to light, the other was immediately written right after it happened and was on tv screens for 2 weeks straight.  They could have addressed the issue without government shutdown like the others.
@QConteret @megynkelly A deal has to be made regardless no matter what side of the aisle.  If the dems get what they want, they still wait months.  If Trump gets what he wants the dems might get to throw in some deal for those immigrants, a sad reality the stupid has infected chuck/nancy cause of Trump
@QConteret @megynkelly That depends on congress, once again.
@QConteret @megynkelly They were offered asylum in mexico while they wait for us immigration to process.
@QConteret @megynkelly Its literally whataboutism, marginalizing non-propagandized victims and placing ones that the media oversensitizes above them, doesnt make a good moral argument.  A life is a life regardless of what value you decide to place on them.

@bweb581 @dandrezner Pelosi has a history of lying blatantly to the public and been in congress since 1987.  Does "we have to vote on it first before we can read it" ring a bell at all?  Have you seen her networth shes completely in it for her self and kept in power with jungle primaries.
@bweb581 @dandrezner Ok find me ONE official democrat politician that has a solution for border security.  Trust me you will find me none, I scoured all of their campaign websites, and their twitters.  Its absolutely sad.  It used to be a bipartisan issue, now they chose to fight a figurehead instead
@bweb581 @dandrezner You stick forks in electrical sockets don't you?
@bweb581 @dandrezner Why are you placating me for being willfully ignorant?  I hate trump, but I can't stand to side with any "open borders" ideology.  I'd rather vote Trump, cause a figure head doesn't matter to me, if we have a chance to prevent more american innocent lives from being lost.
@bweb581 @dandrezner Then go to the "PORT OF ENTRY" Its not hard, its not rocket science.  Don't skip past it, through the many numerous miles of unprotected, unchecked border, where we obviously need a wall at.  Nobody innocent will seek asylum if they have a criminal history FACT, its simple.
@bweb581 @dandrezner https://t.co/OZpU0gOqVo		Was it peaches and cream to ALL these victims with these girls?  Are you gonna counter with your fake feminism next?
@bweb581 @dandrezner Israel-West Bank has a wall.  Morocco-Algeria Has a wall.  Cyprus Has a wall.  India-Pakistan has a wall.  Turkey-Syria Has a wall.  Saudi Arabia-Yemen has a wall.  Hungary has a wall.  Quit living in your warped dreamworld, this isn't about a orange hitler figure head anymore.
@bweb581 @dandrezner Yes, putting children in danger is "best" for children, you know how I know you're a worthless partisan-hack.  You're willing to put politics above innocent lives to serve your hate-filled agenda.  I've traveled the world, trust me, theres walls everywhere and they work.
@bweb581 @dandrezner So you're willing to drag a toddler 2000 miles across desert, through mexico city (#1 in kidnapping).  I can safely assume you have NO children.  FACT:  Walls don't throw tear gas idiot.
@justicedems "Muh evil billionaires" Sigh...  Give me a good reason why we should place price-tags on human innocent lives?  I'll wait.
@bweb581 @dandrezner It was a great thing, the MSM has a absolute proven history in demonizing anyone supporting Immigration laws.  Get off the "trump harming children" garbage, if you had a child you wouldn't risk dragging 2000 miles on foot with little food or water.  That is completely dumb.
@RepAdamSchiff https://t.co/OZpU0gOqVo		Fear and division...  Dude.  Its just $5 billion dollars.   Innocent lives aren't price-tags, get off your ivory tower.  Impeach Trump later.

@irosky007 @RebeccazWriting @kathleenparker Israel and Hungary.  Its 2019 now, and their walls still work.
@RebeccazWriting @kathleenparker Oh Im racist now?  FACT:  Walls dont fire tear gas.  FACT:  Walls dont discriminate.  FACT:  Obama was called the "deporter in chief" and deported 2.5 million illegal immigrants.  Is obama racist too?  Fuck your warped worldview in wanting more rape culture fake feminist.
@RebeccazWriting @kathleenparker You have an oddly disturbed trust in an obviously non-working surveillance state.  If 80% of all girls get raped upon crossing the southern border (-huffpost 2014), your precious flyover drone technology isnt working.  Keep pretending that you have the moral high ground.
@kathleenparker Not to the MSM, every single victim of death, rape, or child abduction from ALL the criminal illegal immigrants will continue to be marginalized, silent, and pushed to the side in order to serve their lunatic agenda.

@SpiritedIdeals @gypsyinca @joncoopertweets "Nowhere have I said..."		Look at your twitter, think of it as a mirror.   You act like a complete partisan hack.  Nowhere do you ever criticize a single democrat, and its a safe assumption that you have abandoned philosophy and became an ideologue. Bury that head deeper in sand.
@SpiritedIdeals @gypsyinca @joncoopertweets Siigh...  Here we go, another pseudo-intellectual, you even sprinkled on some low-tier analytical race-baiting at the end there.  Wow.  You do realize, if and when you do "resist" all of those bad guys on the right, theres still going to be a plethora  of bad on the left right?
@SpiritedIdeals @gypsyinca @joncoopertweets Thanks I guess, appreciate your input.  So what exactly are we resisting?  On the "inappropriate things."  When people keep catering to all the same viewpoints, its like talking to flat earthers, when you see hypocrisy its really difficult to break the collectivist thinking.
@BertJ4411 @joncoopertweets Sure, whatever helps you sleep at night.

@Giftedbutlazy1 @joncoopertweets I understand that you retreat immediately to nonsensical buzzwords when you don't like reading actually non-racist things, since it goes against your whole worldview.  I don't have a problem with it, but just know its looking more and more retarded everyday from your archetype.
@joncoopertweets Congress can't subpoena anyone on the Trump admin if the government is shutdown.  Maybe if we build the wall and then arrest Trump, but you know, that would take some actual forethought which the Dems legitimately lack.
@ArtDosher @SenSanders This is also a known problematic solution.  It would make the higher education state controlled, which if you paid any attention at all with the downward spiral of quality our current state controlled schooling has, you would agree its a bad idea.  Education reform is needed bad.
@lirparob43 @BarneysNose If they can make it to California, we wont have to deport them right?  See, money saved.
@BarneysNose I suppose Trump will just have to import 2.5 million illegal immigrants that Obama deported. You know what they called Obama? "Deporter in Chief."   Short term memory seems to be a growing epidemic around here.

@clarkmo12 @nedprice Its not even reckless, besides the 15k number was the estimated ISIS guys in Syria in 2016.  2017 they dropped it down to 1000.  You still havent properly explained why we should stay.  Waiting still.
@clarkmo12 @nedprice EXPLAIN, how its logical to stay there?  I'll wait.  You been living in a cave lately?  They justify a dumbass war, to increase military spending, while everyone continues to starve at home.
@clarkmo12 @gilliee @nedprice Probably cause they have better reading and writing comprehension than you.  Makes sense.
@clarkmo12 @nedprice Correct.  Shit numbers, its not even worth keeping them there.
@clarkmo12 @nedprice To add, since I have exposed how dumb you are and you can't seem to look in the mirror of how much you fell for a neocon pro-war narrative.  We had 15000 US Troops in Syria in 2016, now 2000.  Its pointless if we got nothing to gain, with a civil war that has 4 different fronts.
@clarkmo12 @nedprice Still stupid.  "You can't spell."  Look I'm not gonna grammar nazi this rebuttal shit on you, your posts are a terrible eyesore already.  The kurds have our troop count outnumbered there since day 1.  Whats the benefit for the US being there again?  None, its a money drain.
@GeorgeTakei I don't think the Ming dynasty would ever endorse this statement.
@clarkmo12 @nedprice You too are stupid.  Its not wreckless if you got only 2000 US troops sticking out like a sore thumb doing nothing and you decide to pull out.  Israel lives right next door with 3 million active military members, that don't stick out like a sore thumb.  YES it is NEOCON to stay.
@nedprice Cool, are you omitting facts for the neocon narrative again? Estimates show that the Syria conflict if we decided to stay, would have costed a total of $2 Trillion dollars.  Also economic refugees have been proven to be a total net loss time and time again.  Quit being retarded.

@QConteret Right, and what do we get in return to stay in Syria?  To appease the neocons?  This is unlike any liberal I have ever seen, is to take up neocon narratives and defend it like its their own.  What ever happened to the anti-war liberals?  Do they still exist?

@JewishNewsUSA Wew...  True colors are shining brightly.  If Israel cant handle the Syria issue on their own, after its 38 billion wasted yearly in aid from the US.  Then IDF isnt exactly effective are they?  Dont get all pissy, over only 2000 troops which Israel can easily manage on their own.

@frodofied Ever considered people see you as just a trollbot, due to you regurgitating the same nonsense ad nauseam and not engaged with your followers?
@rainechief @adamcbest Just to reiterate, if Trump leaves office, (impeachment, resignation or whatever), and all we focused all on Trump and not on any of the important issues.  Would we know what to do to pick up where we left off?
@rainechief @adamcbest Ok...  I don't mean to critique, but why is throwing anti-trump/pro-trump articles (meaning they talk about Trump throughout the article) in rebuttal a good source of ongoing discussion on the issue?  How do we get ahead this way?
@MarkhamJesse @robreiner So more political football on border security/immigration reform then.
@rainechief @adamcbest I appreciate you discussing this, can you provide the source proving that undocumented immigrants aren't getting government benefits?  Also, can you specify which cities/states those are if its not exclusive?

@rainechief @adamcbest So according to multiple sources, illegal Immigration cost tax-payers over $100 billion/year, apparently by over stay.  Are you suggesting that we may have incentivized immigration too much due to the amount of migrants not renewing their VISA status?
@JksKathryn @TheDemCoalition What I understand what you're suggesting instead seems symbolically close to basically having a human-made barricade on the border, which sounds silly, and more dystopian level "police state."  Correct me if this isn't what you meant.
@JksKathryn @TheDemCoalition You do realize working as a border agent isn't that popular correct?  (Roll Anti-ICE protests and Border Patrol footage)  Also, the cumulative upkeep of those salaries trying to keep them well paid in a inflation increasing economy won't exactly be cost-efficient either.
@adamcbest Cool, what's the Democrat solution to border security?  I have not gotten a single answer, everyone is assuming they want "open borders" which the Democrat leaders deny.  Help a curious person out here please.
@EdKrassen What's the Democrat solution to border security?
@TheDemCoalition What is the Democrat's solution to border security?
https://t.co/xgMFEdAiw8		I don't see anything about border security in this, since they claim they don't support open borders.  I want to believe them, but why is their solution such a secret?
@dodoweiss @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What is the solution to border security then?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What's the solution on border security then.  Its been entirely mute from the Democrat side, the solutions I've heard from the "no wall" supporters are entirely based on fairy tale Utopian ideas, that has proven to not work efficiently domestically.

@Tonycuz @JonEHecht @oliverdarcy What are you arguing?  It seems we're both on completely different levels of discussion.  Im not faulting your anger at all, it seems you're letting it cloud the discussion.  Both those questions are rhetorical.
@Tonycuz @JonEHecht @oliverdarcy You just proved my point by misconstruing it and went right into emotional platitudes.  I never stated that Israel's government is some perfect utopian establishment.  Not your foe here.
@Tonycuz @JonEHecht @oliverdarcy The root of it really boils down to religious dogma to be honest.  Taking a step back to analyze the situation, its really a pro-israel vs anti-israel situation.  The level of D&amp;C it causes is a heavy burden globally.

@JonEHecht @Tonycuz @oliverdarcy On that note:  Look into Neturei Karta.  Its really easy to get upset about an issue, especially this one, and I understand your first reaction to anger about it. Holocaust Denial isn't really a new thing, its been around for a while longer than we think, its just more popular.
@JonEHecht @Tonycuz @oliverdarcy Well everyone has their "cult" of followers it seems on twitter.  On the holocaust denial thing, there is also speculation that it was started by Ultra-orthodox Rabbis that denounce Israel as a Jewish state.  Implying that they didn't get their messiah to return them to Israel.
@JonEHecht It seems they put polling on overdrive since the previous administration, while most of the public is coincidentally distrusting polls even more.  I imagine there's gonna be a over-saturated amount of polling during this administration too. https://t.co/TdMVG3Qzlk
@JonEHecht @Tonycuz @oliverdarcy Haha, ok.  I don't believe you're really that upset about it though, D'Souza is gonna do his thing still regardless how you feel about Hitler being anti-gay or not.  Don't let twitter drama get to you.  :D
@funder @realDonaldTrump Kind of a quick and vague analysis to be honest.  Heres a few factors I seen, that could have correlated.  	  	1.  Huaweii CFO getting arrested.	2.  Qatar leaving OPEC.
@JonEHecht @Tonycuz @oliverdarcy Hitler liked his soldiers strong, white and manly, I wouldn't be surprised if he viewed the effeminate ones genetically non-evolutionary to the white race.
@JonEHecht @oliverdarcy Skeptical is definitely allowed, being sold on something due to inherent cognitive bias without factual evidence is too close to the deep end.  Sadly, doesn't seem there's a lot of incentive for investigative journalists lately, the profits are headlines and click-bait articles.
@JonEHecht @oliverdarcy There's actually books about that, written by Jewish researchers, claiming that Hitler was in fact gay.  Just like the internet though, if its in a book doesn't make it true.
@oliverdarcy Again @CNN trying to claim they know what "mainstream" ideas are, even though they have the lowest ratings.  Good job friendo, now both of you look stupid.

@ItchieBootie @benpatrick90069 Don't take it as some defense of Trump being President, certainly not.  Historically we have been blind to blatant disregard to corruption in our government for a long time, and there hasn't been a real actual deterrent to prevent it.  Freedom of press failed to sound the alarm.
@ItchieBootie @benpatrick90069 "others never compromised our democracy..."  - Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bush SR and JR.  Pretty much all of the CIA directors, with their support for human torture, and surveillance programs.  Brennan especially, after getting exposed to lying repeatedly to congress.  DYOR
@Billbrowder Are you ever gonna pay the US the taxes you owe them?  Asking for a friend.
@ItchieBootie @benpatrick90069 Gotta stay young though, I can't fault that.  :D
@ItchieBootie @benpatrick90069 Oh no, don't take it personally, I'm just reiterating the fact that all the previous administrations weren't exactly rainbows and sunshine.  Obama did some important things domestically, although his foreign policy decisions gets a F to me.  My viewpoints aren't 100% partisan.
@ItchieBootie @benpatrick90069 Theres a lot of US foreign policy decisions made in the past that still make people's blood boil domestically and globally, conflating it to a single President is a bit immature.
@NHTC @benpatrick90069 Ironically this.  The decision made about the war in iraq solidifies this fact.
@benpatrick90069 Nobody said decisions on foreign policy are easy, theres always a caveat and sometimes even worse results.  For example:  The US decision on getting Gadafi removed from power in Libya, now Slave auctions are legal there.  Definitely a bad decision.
@benpatrick90069 The interesting dynamic of the us military industrial complex selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, and knowing they will pay the full price...  A question comes to mind, do we want Russia or China being their client instead?  Food for thought.
@Alyssa_Milano DHS reports they are mostly men.  Thought you were a feminist?

@dailykos Umm...  No.  That non-authentic hat doesn't even match the confederate or even the union soldiers design.  Officer hats in the confederate army had 2 crossed rifles displayed.  Not one single hat that I have seen from the civil war memorabilia from either side fashions a star.

Note:  The last thing I said before he blocked me, was asking him to prove that hes willing to have a civil discussion and hes fine with opposing viewpoints.  Kind of hypocritical in his case, since that entails having to hear opposing viewpoints in order to become ex-republican.

When DOJ and Court records are cited in it, I'll praise it.  Until then, I'll file it under flat earth tier garbage.
@QConteret True, the twitter limits is a bit restrictive.  It seems to encourage more turd-slinging instead of civil discourse.  Imagine the level of deeply well thought-out debates if the limits were reversed.  "Must have over 155 characters to post, not less."  I would enjoy it a lot more

@Davebr0chill @bungarsargon @arielsobelle @Uber That's fair, just understand that there's a lot of people on twitter that just impulsively post things, with no real intentions other than to troll.  There's literally a 180 degree difference between meeting people IRL, than the way people act on these social media platforms.
@Davebr0chill @bungarsargon @arielsobelle @Uber So, you admit that you're absolutely obsessed with bigotry then?  Tell me, what have you accomplished by crying about it?  Does it rhyme with frothing?
@Davebr0chill @bungarsargon @arielsobelle @Uber Oh I care about bigotry, but not in the sense that your worldview seems to shine a light on it all day every day.  Reason why bigotry (such a stupid buzzword in reality) grows is that people keep feeding it undeserved attention.  Celebs have influence cause you blindly let them.
@Davebr0chill @bungarsargon @arielsobelle @Uber I simply wouldn't care, its our fault for placing so many "celebs" on pedestals, without realizing the complete narcissism that got them there.  They really don't accomplish much, except propagate words on some morally defunct social media platform.

@gelles Might be the only reason @CNN hasn't completely lost all its viewers, the uncorroborated maybes of multiple unnamed sources telling them all about it.  Interesting how journalism has devolved to click-baiting people in to the edge of your seat nonsense and then nothing happens.
@maggieNYT If the corporate press wasn't so involved with glorifying narcissistic behavior to begin with, I think more people would agree with you on that issue.  I don't see much accountability among the already established news organizations anymore.  I just see 2 narcissists in this case
@DPKNAMBIAR @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He asked Trump why he thought the way he did.  Thats kind of harrassy but you know, I guess people just cant accept opposing worldviews.
@harrydrydensnr @Acosta So questions like "why do you think like this?" repeated by @Acosta for 2 straight years is what you consider journalism?  I mean Trumps a dick, I get it, but Acosta hasnt learned that theres different worldviews than his own sometimes.  Narcissism isnt Journalism.
