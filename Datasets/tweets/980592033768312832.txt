@R_Whiskey @roozief @ali That left has moved past Democrat they are Communist the moderates are Socialist. Bernie is a conservative​ in today's Democratic party.
@chelseahandler The people buying this line of bologna are a threat to National Security, the rule of law and our Constitutional Republic.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Lock em up as the traitors to the Constitutional Republic they are. These are people that live outside the rule of law and poise a threat to our Nation and way of life. They are Communist and have a end game of dragging the Country into their plot.
@KAG4All The decline of our republic can be traced to 3 events. Legalization of murder (abortion), taking the Bible out of public schools &amp; Letting down the Jewish people. 		It was the USA under the leadership of Harry Truman (a Dem) that demanded a Jewish nation be est in their Homeland
@mitchellvii I think your drinking the Socialists/Communist koolaid.		 There is a antidote standing up for the Constitutional Republic instead of working to distroy it.
@KAG4All They gave us social this or that. Changed history to social studies. ThenThey scrapped a healthcare system that at most needed tweaked. The old system so far gone that we will never see it again. Single payer and every single payer will. End game Communisum they don't care.
@RealMattCouch @PolitixGal That the media will brush it under the table, wall and anyplace else they can hid it.
@ChatByCC I knew she would!!
@mitchellvii Well then it's time for the dreamers to set sail and head back to the country they are citizens of. 	It's shameful that Schumer and Polsi won't come to the table to help them. Start deportation of Illigalls that will help cut crime. Unfortunately they are violating our laws.
@cvpayne @PIRATEDANTRAIN Then it's time to deport if they are not interested in working on the issue faced by dreamers. It's shameful they don't want the dreamers here.

@JacobAWohl Who will pay for everything?
@KMGGaryde @KAG4All Yeah Nancy we will throw in a plane ride.
@USALoyalty1776 @SpeakerPelosi Well start deportation then.
@realDonaldTrump The left wants to fabricate a crisis. They don't care who gets hurt as long as they run the board.
@charliekirk11 Now if white males marched on DC the media would go into overdrive calling us Nazi's and Clan.	If it was a male March it would send them into a tail spin calling us weoman haters.
@JudicialWatch Talk about scary. The only thing I can think of as more frightening would be Polsi as President and Waters as VP. Makes me think my 5th Great-Grandfather was wrong for fighting in the Revolution. Blaming a corrupt monarch 3000 miles away would be the better option.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump What was the cheapest gas we saw under Obama? .75 - 1.00 more then now pay was his cheapest.
@SenBlumenthal Unavoidably you Democratic-Communist have been baiting traps for over 2yrs. Hope the American people wake up and see just what the deep state and your party is overtly doing to our Constitutional Republic Bernie I may not like but respect that he is truthful about being Socialist
@marcorubio @POTUS I hope his concession is not more then a 1/100th inch of wall hight.
@ChatByCC The one that went out of business at the end of Reagan's term would have welcomed them. USSR for those to young that would be Communist Russia and every country they had gobbled up at the end of WW2
@TheAndrewMeyer @ali @ADL_National A lot of Christian people love the Jewish people. We understand what Never Again is in reference to. We will not stand by and allow a Final solution to the Jewish quistion happen again!
@GaetaSusan @DrSueDVM @POTUS @VP We need to remember him and all that condone the murder of babies. He said it was better to have a mill stone tied on them and cast into the sea then to suffer one of the innocent children. God help us and don't abandon our nation as this genicoid continues 5 decades later.
@gaye_gallops @DrSueDVM I guess she will need to drag out her broom. I wish someone with more computer tallent then me would superimpose her face on a flying Halloween witch. Maybe leaving DC with broom pointed west toward Calf

They take a inch at a time and give no quarter. It is the long range plan they have to make the US a Communist nation. They are upset that the process they had on steroids for 8yrs has ground to a stop. Patriots stand tough the noise you hear is just that noise. https://t.co/vJ6APVX9vv

@JamesGidcumb @bbusa617 @dayburned Hi Nancy
@DawnDavis64 @ZibaLady1 This Congressperson is deranged and needs to be rained in by the Democratic Leadership before she totally loses the faithful working class Democrats around the country. Her song only plays well among the lowest forms of life.
@asanchez1607 She better bring her lunch if she thinks that she can discredit Sen. Graham he is a man to be respected and marches to his own drum.
@Mike_Beacham Well they won't have to suffer through listening​ to Nancy. Small blessings are still a blessing.

@SociallySherri @ali I think Nancy use them on her legs
@RealSaavedra She really should keep quite. She is great at putting her foot in her mouth. Who was hiding last weekend on the beach? The only people they where not hiding from were Lobbyist. The libs are shameless and pathetic.	I feel bad for her if she really believes what she says.
@ArthurSchwartz @KurtSchlichter @camanpour Well with the cast of characters running Congress Trump will be a sure thing in 2020. The current banking committee assignments junkets with Lobbiest as the shut down in full gear. Once they hit the road all hundred or so running and beating each other up. Trump will be a shoe in

@SenBlumenthal @JoeNBC When will the Clinton foundation, the illegal email server, destroyed phones and laptops be investigated? These crimes predate Trump. No it's not enough she lost we need to know the truth! You know how special council reports work if not your more of a idiot then most in Congress
@JonLemire @JoeNBC I think we elected Trump to talk to other world leaders. It seems to me he had the head of China meet with him in Fld. Now we didn't hire Hillary to conduct the pay for play operation conducted at the State Department or the mishandling of a email server.

This Lady is brilliant!! https://t.co/xikKlYdygV

@Mediaite Wonderful spokes person. We will be able to hear all about Communism. Sadly she is the future of the Democratic parties leadership. She makes Polsi look sane omg did I think that🤔 sad but true.
@CNNPolitics Maybe they can get float from the Lobbyist that paid for the Democratic junket to the sand and sun last weekend.	It's a simple solution the Democratic Leadership needs to call the WH and meet in good faith!!
Keep informing those around you. We must side step the media and get the message out the old fashion way one person at a time. https://t.co/LrsvcfFzYe
@thehill Why don't the grapple with their own racist like Waters and some of the new members that are openly anti semitic? Why where they not outraged by old Senator Byrd a clan leader? They have a lot of in-house cleaning to do before they take on Republican members.
@BrentBozell @DavidLimbaugh It's time to have conservative options!!
@SenBlumenthal It's shameful that Polsi and Schumer are not willing to do the people business.
@conncarroll @DavidLimbaugh The outcome worse then you suggest, we would be a county without borders. Our dedicated border patrol and ICE may as well be disbanded. Just lay down their guns for those entering and leave the vehicles. The migrates would be the only ones the Libs will feel should be armed.
@TrumpsAsianChic @thomasjulian7 I think he needs to look in a mirror to find a racist.

@CillizzaCNN The Democratic Primary will be a cluster. The up side little restaurants in New Hampshire and Ia will be selling lots of organic salads, tea and bottled spring water. Add a surcharge to the bill they won't mind Soroes will be picking up the tab.

@starmicbak16 @bbusa617 Other liberals vote them in. I say give them California they can make Nancy Queen and float away when the chunk falls off the edge of the Country. They just have to take Schumer along as King or court jester.
@RealMattCouch No but the thing that will have a lot of people upset is that at days end no collusion. The report will go to Barr and he writes a report based on the findings and gives his report to Congress. If there had been a smoking gun this would have been wrapped up 6mo ago.

@tonyblazintxn @V_actually @MAGAnificent_7 @realDonaldTrump If the one life taken was someone you loved?
@tonyblazintxn @V_actually @MAGAnificent_7 @realDonaldTrump Your missing the point. A wall will deter crime. This will be my last attempt to try and explain this to you. I've done everything but get out the big crayon's and use each of the colors equally to get the point across. If ONE life is saved with a wall it is worth being built.

@JackPosobiec Good for them!! Nancy your right walls don't keep people out.
@SenBlumenthal Is there anything wrong with people paying out of pocket if that is what they want. Most drug stores, grocery stores and convenience stores have products the guy can use. No prescription needed. Plus they are safer.	Oh I get it you want me to pay for it! My mistake.
@GOP @pat_yust @realDonaldTrump Maybe with drinks paid for by Lobbyist along with meals, rooms and other perks. They may be up to the task at hand the people's business. If they had to wait for their pay they might have stayed in town. They are shameless
@marklutchman @GrizzleMeister Thanks for noticing. My Grandmother's Granddad left his farm wife child to enlist to fight in the civil war. Why? He was old enough to not have to serve he believed that all people are equal. That belief has been handed down. He came home minus a leg but believed in the sacrifice
@tonyblazintxn @V_actually @MAGAnificent_7 @realDonaldTrump Not at all. What I'm saying is if we can help curve even 1 percent of crime and a border fence helps to that Great! Personally I welcome anyone here that follows the rules yes the imigration system needs fixed.	I would think that anyone that looks at this logically would agree
@RealMattCouch Well Mr. Potty Mouth I guess I'm one of them. Shame on you for being first unpatriotic for saying that to those you disagree with and secondly for being foul mouthed. It's no wonder young people talk like they do when they have role models like you. God please help us.
@Eddie_and_Patti @KayaJones @pat_yust @realDonaldTrump I'm glad at his age he is willing to work to get the country back on track. With his money and business empire he could just enjoy life. Anyone to take the job has to have a ego but it's about more then ego. It's about giving back and fixing a broken system. Thanks Mr. President
@sscharf12 @cmclymer @existentialcoms Take a look at the taxing Countries you list do to pay for Free Healthcare   	The new Governor of Cal Nancy's nephew is going to tax water to give illigals free healthcare 	The next wall Texas wants is to keep Californians out of Texas. The taxes are driving them over to Texas

@PAULLEOFASO @dcexaminer In your dream. 2020 full steam ahead!!!
@ejdesign01 @realDonaldTrump Your wrong support for the wall is in the mid range 10 higher then just a month ago. The number putting blame on the shut down has stayed consistent. That has a lot to do with how the questions are ask. The wall on the other hand has growing support.
@NewsPacs @dcexaminer Yes take a look at the nice wall and fence Nancy has around her Estate. She is a closet wall lover.
@dcexaminer I think the Democratic Leadership needs to roll over on the sandy beach and look at the polls by the liberal media. Americans want a wall polling in the mid 50 percent range. Given they would ask the questions geared to get a low number it is likely in the 75 percent true range.

@JackPosobiec The GOP has rinos it looks like the Dems have? 	We wants walls not whale.

@GDanzker I think you will be unpleasantly surprised. What you would find pleasant is if he turns out as you suggest. He is a practitioner of the rule of law. You may disagree with his outcomes but they will be within the sound rule of law.
@tonyblazintxn @V_actually @MAGAnificent_7 @realDonaldTrump What your saying then is we can cut crime like murder by building a fence at our Southern Border by 1 percent. I'm all in favor, maybe you will be when a loved one is murdered in cold blood during the commission of a crime by that 1 percent. I pray you never need to find out!
@sscharf12 @cmclymer With Health Care cost in Canada have you factored in the tax rate on everything they buy? Our President has given the green light to drugs formally considered experimental.

@RealMattCouch I wonder who had the immoral wall built around Nancy's palatial vineyard Estate?? lol the jokes on us as a vineyard it's considered a farm ( no wonder she supports the farm bill) her wall would be a tax write-off so we paid for her wall. Shameful
@MAGA_Cy @RealMattCouch I'm surprised the Democratic Members didn't go there for their much needed break. In the interest of reviewing a wall the beach is a better spot in January.
@sean_spicier @MAGAnificent_7 As Rome burns Nero fiddled. You should also add they are not alone. They have twice their number of lobbiest along to pick up the tab. Shame on the Democratic Partiers!!
@thehill My bet if the President's numbers have dropped a few points. The Democratic Lawmakers numbers have totally tanked as they continue to be paid and being lavishly entertained by lobbyist on the beach. As Federal Employees sign up for unemployment. Shame on the Democratic partiers!!
@sscharf12 @cmclymer Our northern border is open if you want factory fast food medical care head up The area I live in has Canadians coming to the US for healthcare.	Are you under the misconception that people go without healthcare here? Do yourself a favor sit one Saturday evening in a ER lobby.
@GDanzker I'm deplorable!!
@DFBHarvard @Houstonbabe That family is in the hearts of a lot of caring Americans I will keep them in prayer. My heart has been heavy thinking of the family of that young policeman that had his life taken		Where are the Democratic Lawmakers? Playing on the sand. 	Nero Rome is burning put down the fiddle
@ChatByCC Yes just as soon as these disgraceful, shameful, lobbyist loving Democrats can break themselves away from their vacations in the sun and fun.
@charliekirk11 We must stand behind our President. If we don't then just throw open the border and let them take over.
@bbusa617 Shameful, shameful where is the fake news when they are needed?
@bbusa617 Everyone needs to send this photo of Rome in flames as the modern Nero's play the fiddle!!
@V_actually @MAGAnificent_7 @realDonaldTrump As Federal Employees go unpaid and our border is not secure they bask in the sun.	It is shameful that they get paid in spite of the shut down. It is shameful most of them live behind walls and fences inside gated communities.
@JackPosobiec It would be nice if the Democrats could stay in DC long enough to work on national security and reopening government. Instead they want to see notes a interpreter took? They are SHAMEFUL and a embarrassment to all Americans​.
@realDonaldTrump If I was him I'd go on the warpath.
@JudicialWatch Lock her up!!
@JudicialWatch JW is (Crooked Hillary's) buddy now with a second dead body in his apartment  being treated like anyone else? or is he being treated like a Clinton donor? I'm not sure about other people but a second house guest being found OD DOA seems suspicious		Clinton body count on the rise
@realDonaldTrump We would hate to disrupt their vacations to actually do the nation's work. Everyone needs to see the footage of Nancy's wall of stone, gate and inner fence at her vineyard. My bet is she takes hefty farm exemptions for her Vineyard Estate. Great work if you can get it.
@realDonaldTrump Yes and where ever they are it is behind a wall of protection. Everyone should take a look at the walls and fences Nancy has around her estates. It is to keep the riffraff like those of us she considers deplorable out. 	I wonder how many undocumented she has doing her lawn
Its great to see Warren's son understands  the issue	Warrentt&amp;#8217;s Son Takes Massive Action To Secure the Border https://t.co/XGWerQ3HEL
As the D's vacation rather the work on border crisis and government shut down. Remember Nero fiddled as Rome burned.	Previously Arrested Illegal Aliens Caught With $200K Worth Of Meth In North Carolina	Great work Law enforcement Thanks for being on the job https://t.co/iz0sOgcW3Z

@Bamafanaticfan1 @MAGAnificent_7 @SenateDems @SenateGOP @senatemajldr @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump The one mother said it best. It is a kick to her child's grave by Nancy. Why is the Democratic Leadership now against the wall? Because Trump is backing it.
@SidneyPowell1 @DrSueDVM @MittRomney Mitt is still sore that he lost big time. Well in National politics his agenda is a losing score card. His song and dance plays well in one state only and we all understand that. 	He maybe the only one that does not see how pathetic he looks.
@AmiHorowitz @RealDeanCain @dbongino @therealroseanne @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump It would be interesting to know who is putting the money up for these people to travel. Will the money trail lead back to Soroes??
@KAG4All This is where it's Mexico paying for the barrier. They now have to pick up the cost of these people.
@realDonaldTrump Your great!! Out with those on the Frontline of our defence. Why can't the Democratic leadership listen to what the experts are saying?	Instead of working through what they call a crisis with Federal Employees not being paid. THEY LEFT TOWN do they really care? Chuck, Nancy?
@lisamurkowski The shut down could end today. It's up to the Democratic leadership to agree that securing our border and protecting our Country is not only important but must be funded. Oh it can't be done today they all left town.
@realDonaldTrump It's time for you to unleash a investigation on them. Incoming AG has a lot of work it do!!
@lisamurkowski I guess Rino's can live in the cold north.
It seems that the former Dem Senator from desert is getting too much sun. Harry mind your own party candidates that can't defeat Trump without recruitment of Republican non starters like Romney. Keep your powder dry Mit we didn't want you before or now! https://t.co/xCnJmWOSaE
@Eric_Schmitt It appears that they are crossing the boarder.
@realDonaldTrump I think Biden looked like he was in agreement.
@Acosta The bad actors keep moving into other parts of the County. BTW every illigal has broken the law!!
@AOC Joe is out of touch!! His party has been hijacked by Communist and Socialist. Its not the party of Jefferson and Jackson any longer.
@realDonaldTrump Couple that with the annual cost that Mexico will incur with the illigal from Central and South America being on their side of the barrier.	If Mexico is spending money to provide food, shelter and medical care and we are not  that spells out Mexico paying for the wall.
@Chef_Chas @realDonaldTrump Chas you look like you can throw a great bash. Get one ready he will be reelected with bigger numbers then he was first elected with. 		With out a agenda when you ask. Start asking Law Enforcement how they feel about him or those in our nation's uniforms.
@Chef_Chas @realDonaldTrump Are you living under a rock? Businesses have returned to our shores and hiring American's. Lowest unemployment in over 50yrs lowest minority unemployment ever.	Higher wages, lower taxes and lower priced gasoline in spite of the new taxes states have been packing on the price.
@EBDesign1 @realDonaldTrump Another issue I would like to draw your attention to is the last administration sent near 4 times the amount for the wall to Iran. What will we get for that investment?
@EBDesign1 @realDonaldTrump Check and see what our increased border protection is costing Mexico. Everyone we stop from entering from South America they Mexico must deal with. It is known as cost avoidance. We are saving money by keeping them out of our system. Money that can be better spent on Vets!!
@Debshell54 @realDonaldTrump No reason to be there. I sure would not want to sit and stare at Nancy and Chuck if they did not want to discuss the issue at hand.
@Ken_McGuire @realDonaldTrump and others that didn't see it that. I will accept the word of Mike Pence over the rest of the room. He didn't call Schumer a liar but said it did not happen as Schumer suggested.
@spencersloan98 @jessdaadoll @MissyDachtyl @realDonaldTrump What have you been smoking?
@realDonaldTrump I had no doubt that you conducted yourself professionally. The VP said you walked in handing out candy. 	They are pathetic and pathalogical. They lie when the truth would sound more far fetched. Stay the course.
@marcorubio Amen
@thehill Senator McConnell stands in sharp contrast to the Tiny Tears Schumer. Senator McConnell has class!!
@TheJuanWilliams The more Ms. Ocasio-Cortez opens her mouth along with the Nancy &amp; Chuck side show. The less that will need to be spent in reelecting our President.		Keep giving them the microphone, they can't keep their feet out of their mouths.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump You need to add lowest unemployment on record for Hispanic and Afracian Americans.	Historic petroleum production and export of petroleum products.		This wall has a price tag that is one fourth of the amount. That the prior administration sent to the warlords ruling Iran.
@USALoyalty1776 @carrieksada @realDonaldTrump It's all about them beating up on a President that isn't afraid to put in long days and work for all of us. They are jelious of him and his accomplishments.
@JudicialWatch He should be ashamed of himself. He is a discredit to the honorable people that can to find freedom in America.
@renato_mariotti I think if you look closely you will find the Democrats invinted it.
@Rise1Soar2BFree I'd rather have Jesus then silver or gold. I'd rather have Jesus then wealth untold. He is Lord of lords King of Kings and came to earth to walk among us. Fully man and fully God at the same time.
@lilbulli1031 @DrSueDVM My Sunday school teachers were kind and loving.
@brithume The next two years we will have the Chuck and Nancy side show with the occasional rectal by Pocahontas Warren.
@BreitbartNews Most of them live inside a fence, inside a gated community
@thehill I'd bet this clown lives in a gated community. To keep woodchucks out of a garden put up a fence or shoot them. 4th century maybe but I think walls go back to earlier times then that. Why they work.
@realDonaldTrump Stay the course. Don't let tiny tears Schumer or old hagered Nancy wear you down	You have a great bully pulpit as President. Wear them down everyday step out and say this is day 2 and no valid offer from Nancy or Chuck. What will it take to get them to pay our Federal employees?
@realDonaldTrump Now Cohen sees the light and is the victim? His stock and trade is to know the law.	No one twisted his arm to work for the President's Company. My best guess is he felt paying the bimbo would give him leverage with Trump Corporation. Now he is fired and will be a jailhouse lawyer
@Ashaniyan1 @gconnorsrecruit It is known as standing at attention.
@mcspocky @gconnorsrecruit In the short term but how many jobs have been taken from Americians with the Chinese trade imbalance and currency manipulation? Trump has the backbone to stand up and say enough this must be repaired.
@StevenBeschloss @gconnorsrecruit It is time for Mueller to take a dump or get off the pot.
@hillyard_sue @realDonaldTrump Well if your referring to the 3 dwarfs lefty Obama sleazy Clinton and running out of fuel Carter. I'd say President Trump was fortunate to be ignored. Those three ignored the backbone of the country "the Americian worker" during their time in office.
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps now we will have an Attorney General that will have the intestinal fortitude to "Lock Her Up" and Mueller at the same time. They are both corrupt operatives of the deep state.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Bill Barr can have no greater champion then Lindsey Graham!
@cspan What's in a name? Well let me tell you pour your self a John Barr Scotch and rest assure Americian Justice will be well served by Bill Barr
@molratty Those pets are normally cats that eat their owners corpse. Where is Alf (not Landen)when you need him
@anitasarkeesian What caused Americian wearyness of radical Muslims was 9/11. Since the attack we have offered numerous Muslims a new home here. I enjoy the Muslims I've met the friendships  devoloped. It is apparent you have anger issues. Perhaps a therapist could help you cope with your issues.
@JudicialWatch Its time to demand a full investigation into the email server, the Clinton foundation and the uranium deal with the Russians. It is time someone connect the dots.
@FLOTUS @kimguilfoyle @WhiteHouse What a stunning and gracious First Lady!! We are blessed to have her elegance and strength of character beside our President.
@washingtonpost Well I'll take dull over slimball traitor that Comey is. Or spineless like Sessions.	Hopefully Whitaker will send Mueller, Clinton and Obama before a military tribunal for high crimes and treasonous acts! The selling of uranium to the Russians and accepting big money to broker it
@ChadPergram You have forgotten the wild card in this hand. Donald Trump all he,needs to do is ask and she will gain enough Republican votes to become Speaker.
@drummeratheart2 @ilgop @RepKifowit It appears again a Democratic leader is showing their true nature.		 Massive voter fraud in Chicago for decades, Jim Crowe in the south for decades, ties to mob bosses for union support for decades.		Now they openly want to kill anyone with a differing opinion or questioning them
@HoneyHawkins10 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Yes remember Jim Crowe Laws and vote for the party that enacted them
@simonslisa @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA I'm seeing red!! 😂
@PapaLovesMambo @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Shame on them.
@alexperdurabo @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA How dare you, how dare you ever compare a free and democratic society to Nazi Germany.	You obviously never knew anyone that had to escape that evil. 	Shame on you and I hope you never have to know what living under those conditions was like.
@WilliamTrampos2 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Well I think you will learn that Mexico is spending "pesos" to help stop illegals from entering the US. Just take a look at how they have worked to maintain order with this caravan. I realize you may not support the blue wall that protects you but police are a wall of defence.
@wildav52 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Again a history lesson. After reconstruction what party set up a test in the south for voting? What party enacted Jim Crowe Laws? Oh yea it was Democrats least we forget. Oh I almost forgot the leadership of the kkk in West Va old Democratic Sen Byrd kkk leadership.
@BuckeyePeach @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Humm let's see Obama and the Clinton's really did a great job pushing their picks for Senate and Governor's. 	I only wish President Trump had been able to hold a ralley for each Republican congressional candidate. He is only one person and only so many hours in a day.
@isolovethelord @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Yea and if your person wins maybe he can employee broward county Fld and Chicago style voting. You know double counting Democratic wards and one dead person one extra vote. People people people read your history.
@OgmeisterGammie @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You voted should have voted for brad but you voted.. That is after all the American way. One person one vote. In Chicago the Democratic machinery even lets you keep voting straight Democratic ticket after your dead.
@PageantBoyCody @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Good for you Cody!! Thinking young people like you need to vote!!
@horsecrazybean @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA People, People, People wake up smell the coffee its being roasted by the Communist that have taken over the Democratic party. Stand up and vote them down.
@kchandler1 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Lets take a real look at the kkk it was a part of the Democratic machine of the south after they lost the war to the Republicans of the north. Humm maybe we need to start teaching history in school rather then gender bender ideology??
@OgmeisterGammie @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Good for you!! Your a true American
@LAM43 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Another communist has spoken. Yes I said it your a leftist communist it's time for Americians to get off the bench and start calling you folks out for what you are.
@louiselnelson91 @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA What a load of crap!! Republicians have stood for the advancement of people of color far longer then the Democrat party has. Let us please remember that Dr. King was a Republican along with Fredrick Dougless.

@binimannn @ashleyfeinberg Want to replace it with the Marxism?
@cosmipolitik @ashleyfeinberg Landmines every here and there
@marzec_daniel @MartyChavez @cmclymer @Bravo_Avo_Cado Its not at all complicated. One position is party leadership in senate and one is congressional leadership of the entire body. This is how the President will be able to help her become Speaker by asking his supporters in Congress to vote for her. 	It is know as bipartisanship
@TeraAshley2002 @44vreiki @cmclymer @TeamPelosi Carl Marx and Stalin are dead! Btw so should their ideology, there I said it progressives are repackaged communist. We need to stand bipartisan against it!!
@DirkCherkferner @cmclymer @Summer_Daye Another communist has weighed in without money things stop moving Just look at the popup advertising It takes those ads to pay for social media. If it became a state sponcered social media then it back to taxes to run it. What a novel idea it is money that makes the economy work.
@sscharf12 @cmclymer Your great!! The mask is coming off and we get to see Marxism. Public money public money. Those are tax dollars!
@bralfucious @cmclymer It would be ok with me if you Communist come out of the closet and stop referring to yourselves as progressives. Right in most cases it's not a closet it's your mothers basement.
@YankeeJosh @Waltz_Wizard @cmclymer Yes she is. Crying Chuck what a joke
@Waltz_Wizard @cmclymer The Republicans will be voting for her!! The President has offered his support with Republician backing and the support of Democrats loyal to her She will win. It has to happen to keep the speakership out of the hands of the radical communist.
@cmclymer Thankfully the President is going to aid her in regaining the speakership!!! The Communist takeover of the Democratic party is afoot and out of control. They have forgotten or like with most issues don't care about logic. It is a vote of the full Congress that includes the GOP
@Asoka_raj @cmclymer Yes the Democratic party has fallen into the hands of the Communist.
@FZirm @cmclymer Ohhh is that how you communist refer to people that believe in the Constitution?
@Tim_Canova Simple solution a national standardization of the election system. A 100% mail in ballot, then supervision/observation of the opening/counting/tabulation proccess by the major/minor parties on the ballot.	This would increase partisapation &amp; transparency. Some state are doing this

@GOP Lindsey we would welcome you in Pennsylvania. Bobby Casey has moved farther and farther away from his moderate view that got him elected. I'm not even sure if he is pro life any longer.

@Mike_Beacham Or was she offering tips on withholding information and then getting it leaked to the media.
@nytimes Cry me a river New York Times wouldn't we all have been glad to have a wealthy father. The President has worked hard to turn his inheritance into a brand. I think his father would be proud.
@BreitbartNews Come on General.The guy is doing a outstanding job!! He is leading us back to prosperity calling out people who don't do their job. He would not have rested had his Intel told him about a chem weapons stock pile. We sent troops to harms way for a stock pile that did not exist.
@RealSaavedra @PeinsippMike If not for Sir Winston Churchill, we would be speaking German today. The father of the modern Democratic party tried to avoid getting involved.

@LANURSE1 @kimberly329b Good for him! Oh let him know that most of us live in a Country that believes in the persumtion of innocence until PROVEN guilty.
@realDonaldTrump I think it is or soon will be time to tell Sessions YOUR FIRED!! There are plenty of good Attorneys in the Country that can do the job and have the backbone to make the tough decisions. I never thought he would be so lame. He rose to a job one pay grade to high.
@realDonaldTrump I see the Soroes fans have wieghed in. I have lived through and at times endured Presidents. This President keeps connected to an ever growing base, and helps get members of Congress elected or re-elected at the mid term.I knew Ronald Ragean and he's no Ronald Ragean He is better

@bhweingarten @DineshDSouza We lived through years of the Democratic party running the show. I never once thought it my place to go heckle. Its interesting that the people that talk about inclusion and bullying are the ones in the gallery mocking, antagonizing and belittling.
@MattWalshBlog @DineshDSouza Senator Collins was brave and eloquent in her delivery. It showed a graceful thoughtful Statesweoman. It was obvious to anyone that listened to her words that she spent time weighing the evidence before jumping to conclusions. God Bless her for her courage!
@DineshDSouza Yes and West Virginia is coming in for us.
@DineshDSouza It would be welcome if Bobby Cassey would see the light.
@DineshDSouza But if he wants to come over to the side of everyday working Americians we would welcome him and his constituents would cheer him on. What does he really have in common with Schumer? Or Hillary?
@DineshDSouza I think the Senator may have taken a look at the Trump Rally numbers in WVa and thought I'd better sign up. What ever his rational is its good to have him in board. A few of our own should be as noble.
@RealSaavedra Does anyone know who is next on the Presidents short list? It appears that he will be needing it and not due to his needing a back up game plan for the current nominee. Looks like Darth Vader may not remember where her parking spot is soon.

@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle DNC irrelevant sad sad shape. *I'm from the basket of deplorables* Look at the basket of Criminals, Crooks and wack jobs that hate yes they the liberals can be haters (DNC, ABC,NBC,CBC,CNBC, Hollywood Elites, The Clinton Foundation, Comey last but not least CROOKED HILLARY)
@DRUDGE_REPORT It's time to get rid of him like unneeded baggage. He can go write a book and follow Comie another Failure to bring down a truly Great yes I said it Great President. New jobs,Lower Taxes,N. Korea coming to Peace talks,China backing down on currency manipulation and trade inequity
@realDonaldTrump Way to go. Lets see what legal action the loyal opposition Comies up, to take away from this a Great thing.	They are silent now, does anyone remember the concern you where getting us into a nuclear war. 		You understand Peace through strength!
@TheRealECarter @SenTedCruz A little secret! Don't tell anyone but a company called NELSON HAS DONE IT "FOR YEARS LET ME REPETE YEARS" Follow people watching tv and time they are tuned in. That in advertising known as drive time. Oh the politicians buy their ads based on data, radio similar deal. WOLF WOLF
@DFBHarvard I know you intended the Lord help to be cheeky but ask God to intervene. He heard our prayers Trump won, jobs returning, North Korea at the barging table, China backing down on trade and currency manipulation. The list goes on. Pray God is blessing America remember to say Thanks.
@CoreyLMJones Yes and let us pray that the President is able to set in motion Christian food aid for the people that are litterly starving in NK. 	This is a answer to prayer just like this Presidency. Thank God he still hears our prayers and pleadings.
@charliekirk11 You will not find a book that has redeemed more wicked, sobered more drunks, or reformed more drug addicts.	If you look at prophecy 95% has been fufilled the few things still to come are set in motion. Their has yet to be one creditable assault on the truth revealed in our Bible.
@DineshDSouza They must have been selling them illegally! Illegal guns are responsible for most crime with a gun 	I'm guessing this is more about some tree hugging leftie. They sold hunting rifles, shot guns, deer and rabbits must be breathing a sye of relief just before they get hit by a car.
@thehill Its a good thing he dieted. It could have been 5 times the cost.
@HuffPost Disgusting they Distroyed the country and no this as part of their legacy.
@SpeakerRyan @RepKevinBrady @cathymcmorris Speaker. I respect you but to keep America moving forward allow a new speaker to have the gavel. Ahh you said you wanted to give the office up for your family.	This is your golden opportunity to jump start that by getting home every weekend. Let A new speaker raise money.
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Thanks for being good at your job. Your the best! I'm going on 60 your on par with Reagan and one other I never mention in public. The great thing is your just getting started. We are so lucky. The right man at the right time God has blessed us.
@NatResources @POTUS Keep the chopper chopping. Cut regulations until every American can live the dream that is Americia
@SusanDuclos @SenTedCruz @AuntFannysPants Yes then he can expat th problem solved. Just like liberals do it regulation
@RealDimitraE @SenTedCruz @Magnumf0rce There is a wonderful idea, waterboard a BUSSINESSMAN for doing what businessmen do. Make money. After we waterboard him  Wal mart executives next. They are ruining the dairy industry in a lot of small rural areas they got the down town now we don't have a downtown now farmers
@DeverMarty @SenTedCruz Then they should sue the business and allow the rule of law to sort it out.
@yamadrummer1 @SenTedCruz @sparklybev &amp; your point is? I think we all knew that and thank God it is his right as an Americian last time I checked the founding documents.
@JulianneFox36 @SenTedCruz I missed that must have dosed off the one second that any intelligent life form ask a good question. Hacks the lot of them
@LowellNihizer @SenTedCruz Yes and I vote for Mullar
@LittleTweet4U2 @SenTedCruz Sure then they will move THEIR BUSSINESS a third world country and pay no taxes here, have no employees here. As conservatives arnt we against regulation and for business
@ChaseBCarothers @SenTedCruz @Nigel_Farage His hand isnt red I'd say green several billion green. Wonderful the Americian Dream before our very eyes. An idea becomes a tiny business and within a few years your innovation becomes a success. The Quistions should have been show us how we only understand deficet spending.
@Fibonacci222 @SenTedCruz Name calling great back to high school children
@congdanthegioi @SenTedCruz I missed something and watched the whole idiotic event. It was nothing about nothing hosted by wind bags.
@NeedA2ndJob @SenTedCruz In the United States we allow BUSSINESSMAN to donate to whom they choose, ask the Kouc brothers tons of politicians in their hip pockets, I see nothing wrong, to be fair do we call them before congress? Now I like those ole boys but we need to becarful or our ox will be gored
@Lanacharaeogle1 @SenTedCruz @right_as_kiwi Reasonable statement his bussiness. The independent businessman that owns the cornor market selling beef raised in Mexico .10 a pound cheaper then American beef. We require of him to label it product of Mexico and let the consumer decide. If you don't like fb don't use fb.simple!
@KarenFronterhou @SenTedCruz What did he really do?? Free air time tilting at windmills. They should have been questioning Mullar as to how many more tax dollars he plans to waste until he trumps something up on Trump.
@MpMael @SenTedCruz @RodStryker What laws are being broken by this yes liberal businessman. As I read these comments it seems like dumb and dumber. As conservatives we should be outraged that free enterprise was brought before the kings of Congress
@baby9er @SenTedCruz @ouchinagirl Anti trust rules????
@ferrishollis @SenTedCruz Show time that's all it was. He was there as political grandstanding by both parties the outcome Mark my word will be to now have pay for fb and they will still sell advertising. How many new American small start up business have come about as a result of targeted advertising?
@Kimball1Kelly @SenTedCruz A fantastic tilting at windmills
@TheRealECarter @SenTedCruz Right after the tv stations start sending you a monthly check. Oh Humm tv we pay for the service and still sit through ads. I guess fb might be a good deal after all
@RobertK84659507 @SenTedCruz Sure lets do that and watch how fast they move their business to another country. Yes let's monitor a private corporation, lets censor a free enterprise business and then lets all gather in the town square and burn some books. Yea lets we will show them conservative values.
@BobbyWill1960 @SenTedCruz He is in business under the dictates of free enterprise. We call ourselves conservatives a true conservative would set out and start a competitive Bussiness and it would be welcomed if we stood behind the anti trust rules.
@AbbottWolf @SenTedCruz Then lets start our own conservative version???? It is free enterprise after all that we are questioning. LOL conservatives quistioning free enterprise. Reagan must be spinning in his grave. The time should have been spent calling the Deputy AG before Congress to mussel Mullar
@huskernate @SenTedCruz Then do a conservative startup to compete. I think free enterprise allows competition and the long forgotten anti trust rules would be in favour of it. Break up the monopoly under the anti trust there you have meat on the bone.
@fromTull @SenTedCruz Yes now see how you feel when it's a paid service and no longer free. Thanks Congress what's next baseball?
@lorettastringfe @SenTedCruz @interestedmaga I missed something and watched it all. What I saw was a great job wasting taxpayer money going after FREE SPEACH! Now his alternative will be to charge for a ad free service. So much for FREE SPEACH in the largest town hall in the history of man. Oh side note free enterprise?
@vmwilliamson1 @SenTedCruz @ChuckGrassley No see this was political grandstanding calling a FREE ENTERPRISE BUSSINESSMAN that pays a lot of taxes who employees a lot of people that pay taxes before the mighty wind bags. Lawyers that make laws asking why not kindergarten reading level? Do they read the laws they pass?
@SenTedCruz Has he broken any laws? If his business was headquartered in Japan you would not have been able to call him before you. Now his alternative is to take a free service with ads and turn it into a ad free pay as you go service. Ahh thanks no wonder our country is in debt.
@realDonaldTrump Does anyone remember when that nut Carter dawned a sweater and turned down all the Whitehouse thermostats, then didn't light the national tree to save electric and had us buying gas on odd or even days. Thank God the Globalist are out of the White House Go Trump Go we need you!!
@realDonaldTrump Sad sad
@OfficeOfMike She can jump on her broom and do all the air raiding she wants. Ahh as long as it's OVER THERE YES OVER THERE.
@CameronLMitchel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @PressSec @GOP @VP The swamp monsters in DC want him prosecuted. They just need to crawl out of the swamp and get real jobs. They have suckled on the teet of the middle class till it was drained now their environment is being drained and what will we do with the toxic waste they leave behind?
@shecameundone @realDonaldTrump And your misinformed. He is a Patriot that came along just in time to salvage us from the leftwing nuts that financially drained our middle class wanted to enslave the Americian Dream by globalists like Gore, Clinton and Obama.	You need to thank God Almighty for giving us Trump.
@mommachz2 @seanhannity Like you don't know. Just look in your purse. As a matter of fact we need a campaign to start sending Nancy Pelosi empty wallets and purses with a note. We are done giving.
@cutchen_bailey @seanhannity The Police are instructed to follow the money. Hobos have no money and law abiding tax paying folks that have a heavy foot or cost thru a stop sign when no one is coming will pay up to keep their wheels.
@RepChuntley Be a good Uncle take a puppy and kitten over to your sisters house with a bag of Rachel Rays nutrish for puppies and Meow mix for kittens
@HuffPost One Den that can think on her own. There is hope.
@thehill This from the guy that opened Capone's vault looking for treasure on tv. I'm sure the President will lose sleep over this.
These are the same polls that had Hilliary all but picking drapes for the oval office. I'll put my money on his logic. He spends a lot of time with the real people. You know the deplorables https://t.co/ySyhKAzsr8
I guess we's hers and Massa Obama's chill'en. Massa was real goud to usens. He gave us health care that crippled the industry and cost not what it cost to send them all on thier vacations but it was at a cost average Americians couldn't afford it. https://t.co/Ld8y0kZv7E
@sacjeff12 @seanhannity @Austan_Goolsbee @AriFleischer @SebGorka Your numbers are just like the pre election polling flawed! You libs love to play with the numbers. When the numbers don't support your flawed views you invent or just plain lie. If you like your Doctor you can we the the truth was kiss him good bye. Flawed flawed flawed
@keanothedog @seanhannity @Austan_Goolsbee @AriFleischer @SebGorka And then you woke up. It was just a figment of your overly active dream life that you allow to cloud reality.
@marnie_bond @Larrypolya22 @seanhannity @Austan_Goolsbee @AriFleischer @SebGorka The moron moved out of the White House a year ago this past January.
@thehill It cost more to send the Obama's on one trip to their island vacation then the combined English Royal family for 2yrs travel. Think of how often they vacationed I won't use the word (girls) trip extravaganza we paid for The first Lady both daughters and Granny cost a kings ransom
Why can't the Obummers do like Bushs once done with the Office keep quit. Look at the things they could have spoken out about the stain on the red dress (Willy is that is is) to the outlandish lie he knowingly told if you like your Doctor. Good parents don't lie to their children https://t.co/94dYUAX0ID
@thehill Don't we need to have a war for war crimes to be committed? Only Congress can declare war! The President can send troops in the interest of the US and every President in 55 years of life has done so. I don't remember one of them going to the club called Congress to ask permission
Jesus said let that one which is among you that is without sin cast the first stone! I believe in a Saviour that removes sin as far as the East is from the West when we ask him. Do we know that the President has not asked forgivness? Are we Evangelical types allowed to judge? https://t.co/Z6kVz3odFx
@SidneyApplebomb @thehill Christian conservatives still care about our persecuted sisters and brothers in Syria, China, N. Korea, California and numerous other places here and around the globe.
@Sandman_HQ We all pay to much for what we get in return. If Nancy gets her way she will be after those crumbs and more. They want to leave us all with a dollar or 2 on the 100.
Out of touch Time I'm surprised they are still in business https://t.co/bVQXPHwRLl
@HuffPost Since when is free speech a personal attack? What did she say that wasn't true? The liberal collages that didn't want jr will beg him to come. It time for us the voice of reason to boycott the advertisers that are leaving enough already. This kid had his Mark Twain 10 min of fame
@Fillinusername @thehill Yuk!!!
@RealCandaceO It is time for action. We need martial law declared, send Federal Troops gain control. NYC has done a outstanding job a model once Federal control is gained.  We do it in other countries take control, slowly release to better trained local law enforcement.
@charliekirk11 They will need to try and get this past us old people that respect the gains afforded us. Law Makers will find a line drawn in the sand or shall we say the ballot box.	They will do well to remember it takes statesmen and patriots to stand behind our liberty not politicians.
@Sandman_HQ How is that different then its ever been break it down to the percentage that the top 1% pays. You will find most of the tax revenue has always come from the top.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President it has been a long time since we have expanded the United States lets kill two birds at once lets ask the Ukraine if they would like to join us. It will expand our reach, new lands to open to exploration and a strategic place to keep an eye on the Russians.
@realDonaldTrump Go Donald Go!!! Happy days are here again!!! We are blessed to have you leading us from the swamp of a floundering economy to a booming economy. Keep cutting regulations.
@Thomas1774Paine Isn't it time this guy gets sent to prision for interfering with elections? He is worse then the Russians he makes them look like choir boys. I think what he did in our election both pre and post amounts to high crimes and treason. Guantanamo should make him a great home.
@realDonaldTrump I think we will see Trump carry a lot of the Black vote next time around. They will become part of our basket of deplorables. You can bet they will do like the rest of us tell the pollsters one thing and vote with our wallets.
@FoxNews I chip in for it becoming Hillary's new office space. We can tell her she is Queen of the universe and that's she can control us from there. I'll even throw in for a mint on her pillow.
@UnSocialMe @FoxNews I'd chip in to send her
@charliekirk11 Follow the money!! They have created jobs for people beating that worn out drum. Hillary is currently doing anything maybe she should hit that movement up as their point person. However it needs to be noted, she paid men more money for similar work of their female counterparts.
@synthgem I doubt you or your liberal protege would have turned down a chance for a free Government paid for egg. The kids and the First Family seemed to be having a grand time. The President even sat and colored with the children. I'd prize owning a Trump original signed in Crayola
@FoxNews He was right the first time. As can plainly be seen the libs not only want our 2nd Amendment they also want FREE SPEECH of anyone disagreeing with them. They are far more dangerous than any assault weapon. 10s of 1000s of brave Americian Patriots died to ensure us both liberties.
@DineshDSouza @HillaryClinton No Hilliary they just didn't and don't like you.
@HuffPost I hope everyone else in Pennsylvania feels like I do. Its time to tell our tax and tax and spend liberal governor YOUR FIRED!!
@thehill His mug is in the News every time someone asks him. You want to see how quite Past Presidents act look at G. W Bush.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends Thank you for your Public Service. You make me proud to be an American.
@thehill It always interests me that when the conservatives are out of power we refer to the President as our president even if we have to plug our nose. The so called progressives,9 socialists and other Marxist making up the Democratic party won't accept the lawfully elected President.
@nytimes Perhaps their time would be better spent on the causes behind the shootings. Looking back to when I was young most of us boys owned a gun or 2 &amp; 90% carried a pocket knife. We took Hunter Safety, respected guns and each other. I was 30 when I first heard of a school shooting.
@WISH_TV Its time we all start eating more Spam and sausage gravy and biscuits. Pork the other white meat isn't just for breakfast anymore. Its time to eat less rice and more bbq ribs. We can take up the slack for our pork producers by eating one additional pork meal a week. Bacon anyone!
@thehill I think if they want to keep rice on the table and a expanding middle class they better back off. 	We are starting to like the slogan		 "Made in Americia"		Spread the word Americia is back in business and the currency manipulation China has been at for years won't go unpunished.
@realDonaldTrump @OfficeOfMike I'd rather they focus on repealing polsey.
@OfficeOfMike You have my vote!!
@OfficeOfMike The up side is 60% disagree
@OfficeOfMike This is about as good as if you like your doctor. How they can stand and lie when they know the truth will come to the surface is beyond me.
@OfficeOfMike @AnnCoulter Nuff said! LOL
@OfficeOfMike We are blessed that at a time most men wonder off to the golf course Donald Trump has taken on the toughest job in the world. Think of what our prospects where without him. The right man at the right time in history!
@OfficeOfMike Don Jr we love all those things about your Dad also!
@OfficeOfMike Good for them it will save us money. We should send a thank you note to the Kremlin.
@OfficeOfMike We have leadership in the Whitehouse. Have the liberals noticed that our President has North Korea at the table? Part of a deal needs to be humanitarian aid to feed those people, but in conjunction needs to be assuarance that Christians will no longer be persecuted.
@SebGorka @OfficeOfMike This is a national disgrace Democratic opertives working in the upper management of the top policing agency of our country. J. Edgar must be spinning in his grave. After he had worked so tirelessly to keep the communist out of our government his agency is now supporting them.
@OfficeOfMike That is 100% correct if the President of the United States asks someone to serve it is their duty to do so. Given this President is a conservative bussinessman would make it even more meaningful.
@charliekirk11 Back to bringing back God to the class room and the home. Send or better yet take your children to Sunday school. If your serious about class room violence.
@charliekirk11 On Good Friday we are reminded that we are Barbarous. We are set free and our sin is placed on God to bare to the pillary post and scurged, crowned with thorns and nailed to a cross. For me? For you? LOVE LOVE
@charliekirk11 With him forever. Praise his Holy Name. Can we bring him back to school? When He was there we didn't have school shootings, and disrespect for authority.
@charliekirk11 We hear the libs beating their war drums. We are getting ready for a new assault on the 2nd Amendment. Remember if that one amendment falls they will soon take the rest.
@charliekirk11 Can Pennsylvania keep the Independence mall and give the rest of Philly to NJ? We will even throw in the Philly steak and cheesecake.
@charliekirk11 That was just male heads of families. If you add the rest the count climbs to close to 3000. Have you ever tried to get three people to tell a lie and keep it straight? It can't be done. Yet we have all these people that saw Christ after he arose from the dead. Christ is Risen!
@decunningham2 @DemocraticLuntz @JMilesColeman It was a great Night for Pennsylvania!! The State got a man that rolled up his selves and worked tirelessly for Pennsylvania. His Democrat father would have been proud that night. The man no one ever heard of from a city no one had ever been to. According to the eastern press.
@TalKopan Governor it is obvious God still has work for you to do on our behalf. Thank you for your tireless public service that goes back to your action that offered you a bronze star for your Action in Vietnam. We are the ones blessed to still have you leading.
@UniReEditor Praise the Lord Tom he still has work for you to do.
@nahlaw Then as our States Governor, then for all of us when he took on the monumental task of getting government working and sharing information as the first Homeland Securty Secratary. You can look back to the young man that Earned a bronze star in Vietnam
@nahlaw Just for your information Governor Ridge did not come from privelage or the 1% his Dad worked in a hot dog factory. His Uncle's all worked in the dirty steel mills of Pittsburgh. Tom is a self made man who worked tirelessly for the people of his district as a congressman
