@JDiamond1 SORRY FOR HAVING A SOUL.
RT @jdawsey1: Trump is revising history here on Mattis in CBS interview. "He resigned because I asked him to resign." What really happened?‚Ä¶
Trump tells CBS he‚Äôs not telegraphing military moves by talking about them, unlike Obama: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference. When Obama pulled out of Iraq in theory we had Iraq. In other words, we had Iraq. We never had Syria because Obama never wanted to violate the red line in the sand.‚Äù https://t.co/7TSMiiWcL1
Trump is also asked about Pompeo possibly leaving and running for Senate in Kansas. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd do that,‚Äù Trump says, adding Pompeo doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúlame duck‚Äù(?) https://t.co/920a7wHfR4
I am also not really sure what to make of this sentence from Trump in the CBS transcript on this intel chiefs testimony topic: ‚ÄúIt wasn't so much a report. It was the questions and answers as the report was submitted and they were asked questions and answers.‚Äù
Trump never answers what specifically was wrong about his intel chief‚Äôs testimonies, though he mentions Syria/ISIS/Iran/NorKor throughout the intv as examples of something he‚Äôs succeeded on despite intel that says they‚Äôre not done deal victories. https://t.co/DPMfBFmPbA

@jpodhoretz Okay....I mean, feel free to read the rest of the thread where I explain why. I‚Äôm just telling you *their* thinking.
So what's the timing on all of this recount business?		1. County canvasses began yesterday &amp; are ongoing. They will be finished by noon, 11/10.	2. If margin is &lt;.5%, machine recount, done by 3p, 11/15.	3. If that margin is &lt;.25%, by-hand recount, done by 11/18. #FLSen		(Fin.)
Elias says they are on a ‚Äúmission to make sure everyone who cast a ballot and was eligible should have it counted and counted accurately.‚Äù #FLSEN		(5/X)
Finally, Team Nelson is focused on Miami-Dade &amp; making sure provisional ballots count. On a call w/ reporters just now, Elias pointed to a national ‚Äúhistory of rejection‚Äù of signatures on provisional ballots that impact Hispanic and black voters disproportionately. #FLSEN 		(4/X)
They're also looking at about ~10,000 votes still being counted in Palm Beach County, where Elias believes a ‚Äúsubstantial number‚Äù of votes will end up a) counting and b) upping Nelson's vote share in the already blue area. #flsen 		(3/X)
The Nelson team is looking at Broward County (where votes are still being counted right now) and specifically an "under-vote" in the Senate race. Plain English: more people voted in the gov and AG race than in the Senate race, a pretty rare thing - Elias argues. #flsen		(2/X)
A few top lines on this #FLSEN recount adventure, from a call with Marc Elias -- the lead lawyer on the Nelson effort. First and foremost, he thinks Senator Nelson is going to stay Senator Nelson by the end of this process.		(1/X)

Trump is at play in all these midterm races BUT it's refreshing to see a debate about things other than that. Tonight's #NDSEN debate was substantive about healthcare, role of the press, tariffs, school safety, Mueller, etc. Trump was a tangential mention, not central.
"It's interesting @kevincramer talks about President Trump. Why not talk about what you've done?" @HeidiHeitkamp asks. "Why not talk about your bipartisan credentials?" #NDSEN
Cramer knocks Heitkamp's bipartisan pitch. "The problem is you can be on both teams and maybe feel good about it, but when one team is so much better for North Dakota..." Cramer adds he thinks that Prez Trump stands with ND more than Heitkamp does. #NDSEN
To this same question, Heitkamp calls free press "critically important" but says that "too often subjective opinion infiltrates" and that "makes the press weaker." However, she says, that doesn't make them targets for "unspeakable kinds of attacks." #NDSEN
On Q about role of the press and how the president talks about them, Cramer says he appreciates an "accessible president that sometimes misspeaks" in the course of speaking frankly to the American ppl. "You don't have to like it but I appreciate his bluntness frankly." #NDSEN
Asked if they believe Mueller probe is "rigged," both Heitkamp and Cramer agree it is NOT. Heitkamp goes on extended answer about Mueller as a "patriot." Cramer says he also has "some faith in Mueller" but "less faith in the team he's assembled" and probe should wrap up. #NDSEN
.@HeidiHeitkamp starts the first #NDSEN debate apologizing again for her campaign's including women's names on letter w/o their permission. "Unfortunately this week, I not only disappointed many North Dakotans, I disappointed myself." 		More on that: https://t.co/hLUsbmc48J

Trump references the upcoming GOP primary here in #WVSen. He's seated between two of those candidates. "Go out and vote," Trump says before letting both men speak.
Gov. Justice told a story just now that he asked Trump to sign something for a group of pro-Trump women he met at Hardy's. The message, per Justice, went something like "Dear Hardy's Girls, take care of Big Jim. A great guy and a great friend. -Donald J Trump."
fwiw, Trump's opening remarks did mention tax cuts (the theme of the event) ‚Äî but mostly that he wanted to brand it as cuts, not reform, and bashing Dems (like Manchin) for not getting on board and voting for it.
Roundtable participants now speaking after Trump's opening remarks. He teased that he will take some questions ‚Äî so let's see...
Trump said the same person votes "many times" in California. Then, says it's not a conspiracy theory but that "millions and millions of people" vote many times.

Trump mentions recent news items discussing getting rid of 2nd Amendment. Someone in the crowd shouts out "tyranny!" Trump assures "your Second Amendment will always be your Second Amendment."

Trump‚Äôs reasons for voters to vote for Rick Saccone in #PA18:	1. He‚Äôs a fine human being (but POTUS unclear if that matters)	2. Competent 	3. Hard working 	4. Knows things many people don‚Äôt know 	5. Knowledgeable on North Korea 	6. Rick will vote for us (Trump) all the time

Apparently presidents are robots, per Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù impression rn.
@pbump He did this during an opioid summit at the WH recently, too.
‚ÄúI look forward to 2020,‚Äù Trump says, because he looks forward to how left the Democratic nominee will be pushed.

RT @ddale8: Trump says he‚Äôs going to impose his tariffs in ‚Äúa very loving way.‚Äù
Asked about stopping this from escalating into a trade war, Trump says "when we‚Äôre behind every single country, trade wars aren‚Äôt so bad." The Swedish PM is looking down at papers on his podium. Trump adds: "The trade war hurts them, doesn‚Äôt hurt us."
Trump's rebuttal when asked by Fox if he'll go ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminum - spoiler: yup. He says the EU can do whatever they'd like but if they do that then we put a big tax of 25% on their cars so believe me they won't be doing it very long.
Standing next to Trump, Swedish PM speaks against tariffs, saying "increased tariffs will hurt all of us in the long run."
Trump says the US remains "determined to achieve a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and that "there's been a lot of news on that today...hopefully...it will lead to a very positive result."

Now, are there discussions to be had about how Trump thinks this should be legislated? Yes! But now we see where he stands on some of these issues and ideas: he wants to ban bump stocks; wants to raise age of purchase for some weapons; likes the idea of 'hardening' schools...

The easy joke is that this is reality TV. And it is! The reality, though, is these are the discussions our lawmakers are having in the aftermath of multiple national tragedies. It's good that we get to see who wants what.
I will say this: more access is better than less. The president clearly wants to negotiate with lawmakers on critical issues - like immigration, or school safety/gun control - in the public's eye. Gives a really interesting view of the thought process, where he stands, etc.
This whole session is just fascinating.
POTUS tells lawmakers at the WH that he's going to "write out" an executive order banning bump stocks "so you won't have to" include that in future school safety/gun legislation.
Trump talks about his lunch with top @NRA officials this past Sunday. He calls himself a "big fan of the NRA" but said he told them "it's time. We gotta stop this nonsense, it's time." 		Unclear, though, what specifically Trump told these NRA officials it was "time" for.

This in reference to North Korea sanctions. More on those here: https://t.co/o5QxyxiwXD
Asked what happens if today's new round of sanctions don't work, Trump says "we‚Äôll have to see" but if they don't "we'll have to go to Phase 2. Phase 2 may be a very rough thing, may be very unfortunate for the world."

So, yeah. Let's all time travel back to the present from that 60+ minute detour back into 2016.
And as he wraps up, he throws in that he "just wanted to let you know" that they just announced sanctions on North Korea.
Trump calls his a "great movement. They try like hell, they cannot stand what we‚Äôve done. We're even doing the right thing for them, they just don‚Äôt know it yet."
Wait...Trump sounds like he's wrapping up. And he hasn't mentioned North Korea sanctions yet.
I'm gonna be honest: I didn't realize how much 'the snake' was associated with my Twitter brand until scrolling my mentions right now.

RT @W7VOA: If US doesn't have a strong military "you might not be allowed into this room" in the future.
Trump celebrates his decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem. "Every other president really lied because they campaigned on it‚Ä¶then they got into office, they never did it."
Trump is talking about John Kerry now at CPAC. The most memorable attack against him he used to level on the campaign was about Kerry getting in an accident while riding his bike. Trump promised if he won he wouldn't ride a bike. So far, promises made, promises kept.
Hey @DougNBC - this Trump CPAC speech is making me wonder if I'm still an embed and need to file a READOUT after it's over?
It's 2018. The president is at CPAC, still talking about his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, and how he won the electoral college.
Trump gives his honest take on his remarks: asks the crowd if they mind him going off script a bit because his prepared remarks, while beautiful, are "a little boring."

Btw, if these quotes are sounding unscripted...it's because they probably are. Yes, Trump has prepared remarks ‚Äî with a big North Korea sanctions announcement in them! ‚Äî but he's riffing now, feeding off the crowd's more than friendly energy.
Trump still blaming a "certain senator" for his healthcare vote. 	"Remember one person walked into a room and when he was supposed to go like this (thumbs up)...he walked in and went this way (thumbs down)...Who was that? I don't know." Crowd shouts "McCain!"
Trump says if Democrats get into office they'll take away the massive tax cuts and the 2nd Amendment. He then polls the crowd to ask which they prefer to keep if they had to pick one. Keeping 2A seems to win based on cheers.

Trump catches a glimpse of himself on a nearby monitor at #CPAC2018 and pauses remarks to smooth down his hair. "I try like hell to hide that bald spot folks, I work hard!" he jokes. Then says it "doesn't look bad, hey we're hanging in! Together we‚Äôre hanging in."

TRUMP: "If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything. "
"It is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy," Trump says tonight in #SOTU. "Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people...we were elected to serve."

Amid all those topics: a message (albeit only a few minutes long) on the admin's push for greater e-connectivity for rural areas. Trump signing 2 presidential orders on the issue now.
RT @christinawilkie: Trump just told a longwinded story about Steve Bannon‚Äôs personal hero, Andrew Jackson.
POTUS wraps up in Nashville after just over 30 minutes of remarks. Crowd was very friendly to his message - which spanned from celebrating tax reform, to attacking Dems, to remembering 2016 elex, to praising farmers, to NAFTA, to deregulation.
Spotted here in Nashville during POTUS remarks, a man -- who is very much into this speech in a positive way -- wearing an "I Support NAFTA" button on his jacket.
Trump plugs his twitter - "@realdonaldtrump" - and calls it his "only way around the media." 		"Fake media," he adds in a lower voice, pointing toward the press riser.

Trump urges Congress to "pass a farm bill on time so that it delivers for all of you and I support a bill that includes crop insurance --	 unless you don‚Äôt want me to."
RT @ZekeJMiller: Trump: On NAFTA, I am working very hard to get a better deal for our farmers and our manufacturers...It‚Äôs not the easiest‚Ä¶
Still rehashing 2016: "there was no way to 270..." Trump remembers.
"Oh are you happy you voted for me?" Trump says to more applause. Adds that the "other choice wasn't gonna work out too well for the farmers...or miners, or anybody else."
The deregulation message will be (is being, so far) well-received here. Folks I talked to pre speech were fans of that, but also a bit skeptical of the long held Trump threat that the US could pull out of NAFTA.
A "USA" chant breaks out among the thousands in the room when Trump says "we want our flag respected...we want our National Anthem respected also."
"From now on most family farms will be spared ‚Äì and it really is the word punishment -- of the deeply unfair estate tax, known as the death tax, so you can keep your farms in the family," Trump says to huge applause here.
RT @PeterAlexander: NEW: White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says Trump's physical on Friday will *not* include a psychiatric exam.
While celebrating tax cuts Trump says the "competing party wants to raise those taxes" to crowd boos. "We can't let that happen; we worked too hard to get them."
POTUS says the farmers here "embody the values of hard work, grit self reliance, and sheer determination we need to -- did you eve hear this expression? -- make America great again."
Trump says he was disappointed to hear it was the American Farm Bureau's 99th year. "100 is so much cooler, I have to be honest." Says he thinks he'll come back next year.
Huge cheers and standing o for @realDonaldTrump here in Nashville as he comes on to -- you guessed it -- "Proud to be an American."

"My Way" is playing right now in Nashville. My favorite campaign memory is when Bobby Knight's cell phone went off during an intimate campaign gathering in Wisconsin, seemingly answering the question of why Trump had been bringing the song up so much on the stump at the time.
