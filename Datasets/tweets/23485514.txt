Cohen opens by saying Trump never expected or wanted to win. Cohen said he ran to increase his brand, THEN, in answer to DWS question if Trump would collude with Russia to win, Cohen says Trump would do anything to win. Which is it? 🥴🥴
@TheDemocrats Don’t forget, this Michael Cohen circus has been planned by the party that denounced God 3 times and visited against medical care for an infant. Morally bankrupt people.
@TheDemocrats Guess what? We don’t give a rats ass what Michael Cohen says. You apparently think we aren’t aware you are doing this to embarrass the POTUS as he is negotiating nuclear disarmament with N. Korea. You care more about party than country. 👿
Michael Cohen is a scum bag. Even if everything he says true (and it isn’t) he is betraying client/lawyer confidentiality. He is hurting all client/lawyer relationships. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

A Lefty told me “Western Civilization” was a dog whistle for White Supremacy. White nations have always been diverse. That they weren’t more diverse in the past was more about not having planes, trains &amp; automobiles than about racism.
It is normal and natural for people to seek what is familiar and be more comfortable with people who share their values and culture. That is HUMAN NATURE, not RACISM. The Left is redefining terms to mean something they never meant.

Good for your family. Trump has denounced racism but the media doesn’t report it and every Liberal talking head calls him a racist daily. I know thousands of Trump supporters and I don’t know a single bigot or racist. I’ve been to hundreds of rallies, no hate, no violence. https://t.co/gGM6jZ4qoW
Yes, the media is complicit in causing division. But despite 92% of the coverage of Trump being not just negative but slanderous and mean spirited, his approval numbers are at 52%. Think what they’d be if even a little unbiased. https://t.co/GnXqM7IEvE
That’s right. But the media calls Trump supporters or Conservatives in general, racists, homophobes, Islamophobes, bigots, etc. We are none of those things. We haven’t changed our principals. Still for limited gov, individual Liberty, self determination. https://t.co/GnXqM7IEvE

If you don’t know the facts of this it’s because the media doesn’t report it. The FBI (not rank and file, but leadership) tried a COUP. Watch the video of Alan Dershowitz about this. Read McCabe’s book. He ADMITS trying to overthrow Trump. https://t.co/KFOVXMEMyS
Sadly, we had a horribly corrupt government under Obama. Many departments were weaponized. Did you not see Strozk/Page texts that said they had an insurance policy if Trump won. I know Katherine Englebrecht. She was harassed by five federal agencies. https://t.co/KFOVXMEMyS
Apparently, you haven’t listened to McCabe. or Comey. They admit they were trying to remove Trump from office. McCabe SAID they were trying to use the 25th Amendment. It isn’t the FBI’s job to determine a POTUS competency. They admitted using a false dossier to investigate. https://t.co/KFOVXMEMyS
His saying there were good people on both sides was simply his attempt to tone down the anger. I agree, I can’t imagine either side having good people. But I suppose if I were generous I might say there were some “misguided”. Trump isn’t always artful but he is a good man. https://t.co/Qa2WwFV0cc
No, they aren’t his supporters. One side was White Supremacists, the other ANTIFA. ANTIFA is Liberal &amp; White Supremacists don’t believe our Rights Come from God.

We have 1/3 of the population of Mexico and El Salvador in the USA NOW. It’s about the NUMBER of poor uneducated people not their race. 53% of adults in LA neither speak or read English. 93% of students in LA schools are Latino. Half drop out of school. It’s destroyed CA. https://t.co/b3mcHtXDgn

We aren’t sending anyone back to their deaths. During the Obama admin “refugee” claims increased 4000%. S. American countries didn’t get more dangerous.

You couldn’t be more wrong about Trump being a racist. He just isn’t. I’m friends with Jamiel Shaw Jr. Trump couldn’t be kinder to him. You may never like him but if you keep voting for Democrats they WILL take your guns. And they WILL ration energy. Trump won’t. https://t.co/28NUbuJqAS
The truth is that America is the least racist country in the world. I’m SICK TO DEATH of ppl throwing around the racist meme. I know LOTS of very successful minorities. Every company I ever worked 4 actively sought minority employees. Media is irresponsible for pushing racism.
