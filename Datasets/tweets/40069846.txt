RT @MadaleneMielke: As a @WINonline Advisory Board, thank you @akmcquade for taking the time to educate the members!
RT @ReproJobs: .@WINonline had an event discussing hiring &amp; interviewing for careers in the movement. Check out the convo on #WINcareers! #‚Ä¶
RT @akmcquade: Had an awesome night talking to some young, impressive women interested in careers at women's orgs. Thanks, @winonline! #win‚Ä¶
Volunteer experience can help you stand out, even if you don't have a related internship or work experience. #WINcareers
Hill experience, even an internship, is helpful and helps you stand out. It shows you are willing to put in the time. #WINcareers
Connect the dots about your skills when you're at the interview. Show why you are the best for the position. #WINcareers
Other protip: it's a pain, but it's important to tailor your resume for the place where you're applying. #WINcareers
It's the simple stuff: keep your resume up to date. Write a strong cover letter. Check for typos. Get the name of the org right. #WINcareers
Want to work in comms? @RachelLarris: one key thing is demonstrating that you have writing skills even if outside of day job. #WINcareers
How do you stand out--when there are 500+ resumes? #WINcareers
Networking can also help you learn more about the work environment at a certain org &amp; if it would be a fit for you. #WINcareers
RT @I_archer: ‚Äú@WINonline: What job or path took you to where you are today? #WINcareers‚Äù taking risks and always being willing to learn so‚Ä¶
.@RachelLarris gives WIN a shoutout on finding a place to have those "repeat" interactions w/people in your field. #WINcareers
Seek deeper opportunities to interact w/people in your field: internships, volunteer work, not just one networking event #WINcareers
RT @I_archer: @WINonline I've landed more success cold applications or staffing agencies.
RT @crystallander: ‚Äú@WINonline: What job or path took you to where you are today? #WINcareers  Studying abroad changed my life!
Also inspiring: one of our speakers started off as a temp and then was hired. #WINcareers
Reassuring fact: at the lower levels, most hires are from cold applications. #WINcareers
.@RachelLarris: Networking certainly helps you, it gets you a step forward in the process, but it's not always necessary. #WINcareers
Networking or cold applying: what's the difference in getting a job? #WINcareers
Keep improving on what you're doing. Don't rest on your laurels. -protip from @RachelLarris #WINcareers
Look beyond your space, look at what others in your field are doing. Stay current. -Protip from @akmcquade #WINcareers
Alison McQuade, a digital press secretary: "my career didn't even exist 10 years ago." #WINcareers
Internships were key for Megan Donovan of @ReproRights in her career path. It helps you break into a new field. #WINcareers
If you want to work in field operations, EJakobsen suggests you have some practical experience organizing on campaigns/labor. #WINcareers
Two things in common so far with our speakers, two previously worked as organizers on political campaigns. #WINcareers

#Birthcontrol is #NotMyBossBusinesss. We need to #FixHobbyLobby to ensure women have access to the healthcare they need. #WEmatter
Your zipcode shouldn't limit your access to #reprohealth care. No matter where we live, women matter. #WEmatter
Tipped workers are 2x as likely to live in poverty as other workers. 3/4 tipped workers are women. It's time to #raisethewage #WEmatter
In 2012 alone, the #wagegap resulted in a $18,650 loss for African American women and $24,111 for Latina women. Awful. #WEmatter
American women are paid just 77 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, it's even higher. #WEmatter #equalpay
*All* women deserve to be paid equally and recognized for their contribution to the economy. #WEmatter #EqualPay

RT @Miss_CTINA: Lots of wonderfulness shared tonight at the WOC @WINonline panel. Thank u to @HendersonKaya @TikiaKHamilton &amp; Mrs. Salcido ‚Ä¶
That's a wrap on a fabulous conversation with #WINWOC on #Brownat60.
Final question from #WINWOC Co-Chair @Miss_CTINA: Do you feel the need to prove students of color can learn?
.@HendersonKaya highlights after school programs, sports, clubs, nternational travel in creating well-rounded education &amp; empowerment.
Mrs. Salcido speaks to @ChavezSchools public policy program strengthening students and empowering them in school.
DCPS alum askes about empowerment program for public school students, especially for those who may not have support system at home #WINWOC
Audience member attended DCPS McKinley Tech, praises the focus on global education. #Brownat60 #WINWOC
Mrs. Salcido says @ChavezSchools doesn't want to encourage students to apply to colleges that only graduate 30% of their students #Brownat60
Talking best colleges, graduation rates, and money for college for minority students. #WINWOC
.@HendersonKaya emphasizes teachers' expectation and curriculum providing rigor for all students. #WINWOC #Brownat60
Question on where we can raise expectations - is it at home, the teachers, government, higher ed programs?
"The quality of education I want for my kids is the equality of education I expect for everyone" - @HendersonKaya on why she works for DCPS
Out to the audience for a quick Q &amp; A! #Brownat60 #WINWOC
"Fixing buildings, buying books, restructuring curriculum" @HendersonKaya on what she sees schools doing over focusing on teachers #WINWOC
.@TikiaKHamilton and @HendersonKaya stress public schools not attracting best talent and thus limiting what teachers can do #Brownat60
Mrs. Salcido plugs @ChavezSchools' symposium for seniors presenting their theses, including one on education reform. #WINWOC #brownat60
I fundamentally believe none of the work we do... will last unless we include the community - @HendersonKaya #WINWOC #Brownat60
#WINWOC Co-Chair @Miss_CTINA quoting from @andreperryedu Op-Ed "Education Reform Movement is Too White..." http://t.co/kVx08oE3SP #Brownat60
.@HendersonKaya says schools may play social worker, psychologist, general community fixer if no one else does it. #WINWOC #Brownat60
Mrs. Salcido points out students coming home to parents without jobs may lack the same enouragement to succeed in school. #Brownat60 #WINWOC
.@ChavezSchools' Irasema Salcido: "We need to do more" to make education a priority as a country. #WINWOC #Brownat60
"There's a shake up in the teaching profession right now..." @HendersonKaya on our country expecting more from student/teacher performance.
Other countries only allow their top students into teaching programs, the US lets our "C Students" into teaching programs - @HendersonKaya
. @HendersonKaya argues Teach for America is "bringing sexy back to teaching" and 40% of their program are people of color #WINWOC #JT
Discussing the roles of programs like Teach for America in bringing young, white people and displacing teachers of color #Brownat60 #WINWOC
.@TikiaKHamilton says we have said education is the civil rights issue of the last two centuries, but we don't act on it. #Brownat60 #WINWOC
.@HendersonKaya talks about the importance of choice in educational options, and all of them being good quality #WINWOC #Brownat60
Systemic, structural issues like class are inextricable from the issues like segregation, @TikiaKHamilton points out. #WINWOC #brownat60
.@TikiaKHamilton shares her worries about making integration the goal, bc it suggests black culture is inferior to white culture #WINWOC
To encourage integration, put real incentives in the neighborhoods east of the river, says @HendersonKaya #WINWOC #Brownat60
Last tweet is a quote from @ChavezSchools' Irasema Salcido. #WINWOC #Brownat60
"(Integration) is in our interest. Unless our young people are interacting with each other, they're not going to be able to solve problems."
Irasema Salcido: "(The Brown v. Board of Education decision) sent a message to children that they were valued" #WINWOC #Brownat60
DC Chancellor of Schools @HendersonKaya speaking to the importance of expectations of students from poor families #WINWOC #Brownat60
"We have not achieved desegregation by any stretch of the imagination" - @HendersonKaya #WINWOC #Brownat60
Talking Central High School (now Cardozo High School) and the impact after desegregation in DC #WINWOC #Brownat60 http://t.co/ZVTgQ7Q0vh
All the panelists have highlighted the importance of residential segregation impacting educational segregation. #WINWOC #Brownat60
First Brown-focused question for @TikiaKHamilton: Would Brown have happened if non-white schools had had "equal" facilities? #WINWOC
Opening the #Brownat60 event with a poll to gauge various experiences with public education. Folks from Tampa, Boston, Chicago. #WINWOC
