@j2sheck that's fair, and even the specific example in that quote where he said it's no longer his - it's out in the world - refers to another character he now plans to bring back I guess
@MagentaRocks Oh 100%. And I also fully believe his answer doesn't actually matter! I mean, it might for some people - folks looking for a definitive answer from the author - but my stance is that once it ended, all that matters is what he was trying to say with what aired/how we view it
@MagentaRocks it is, but feels like nowadays creators endlessly explain their work and get asked for and/or provide endless more detail -- and everything gets rebooted forever and ever and ever, nothing ever really ends, etc.

@dankois you're a young man in Stan Lee terms, he hadn't even been in Mallrats yet by then
obviously the guy was a veteran in the profession, obviously the JACK KIRBY of it all is an essential part of those creation stories, but: The things for which Stan Lee is most famous didn't occur until nearly halfway through his life
A nice little reminder in Stan Lee's life for anyone feeling like they want to try something new or start something else and worried it's too late:		Stan Lee was 38 when Fantastic Four #1 published, 39 when Amazing Fantasy #15 published and 40 when X-Men #1 published https://t.co/CJqnXecLvI
The insidious strain of American gun violence, the kind poor neighborhoods know best, is a massacre in slow motion. In D.C., which has seen 145 homicides so far this year, the dead included Steve Slaughter, a random casualty, 5-foot-4 in size 7 hightops 		https://t.co/AJv1e1XXNa

That comment was specifically made during his earlier hearings when Kavanaugh was asked to respond to Trump's attacks on the judiciary. 		He refused, saying he wouldn't "get within three zip codes" and adding: "We don’t comment on comments made by politicians.” https://t.co/dk5FIsbXFq
I'm stuck on Kavanaugh saying the allegations against him are an "orchestrated political hit" fueled by anger at Trump's election in 2016 and people trying to get revenge for the Clintons 		Three weeks ago at an earlier hearing, Kavanaugh said of judges: "We stay out of politics"
Kavanaugh's opening statement is veering from angry claims that the allegations are a "calculated &amp; orchestrated political hit” fueled by anger about the 2016 election to him tearing up when saying his young daughter wanted to pray for Ford. And he's again denying the allegations
Kavanaugh is criticizing Democrats and the media calling it a "calculated, orchestrated political hit" fueled by anger at Trump and the 2016 elected and "revenge" sought on behalf the Clintons. 		He goes on to say that what's happening now will reverberate for decades
