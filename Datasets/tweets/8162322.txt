This is Lee Greenwood's second @realDonaldTrump rally appearance in this late midterm blast, with the campaign announcing him as a special guest on Sunday.
"Bill and Hillary Clinton on their national stadium tour ... Have you seen Obama,? he‚Äôs stumping down in Florida where I live. He‚Äôs drawing crowds of 1,000 people, 2,000 people. Joe Biden can‚Äôt fill a phone booth because he‚Äôs looking for someone to punch out" - @RushLimbaugh

On a personal note, Charley Schwab, Boston Terrier, has finally discovered that pig's ear I left out for her two weeks ago. And has decided just as the @realDonaldTrump begins, to go absolutely nuts over it.
.@rushlimbaugh says "I am so hoping that in a few minutes you start chanting something else" when he hears a U-S-A cheer. 		Once he references @HillaryClinton he gets a raucous "Lock her up!" 		"I love these rallies. They‚Äôve got the message," he says.

Of course, it's bad news for the Republicans that Balderson is struggling this much. This is a district that went for @realDonaldTrump by 11 points.
If these numbers hold, Trump gets his two guys in Michigan and #OH12 tilts Republicans' way (Balderson is 1,031 ahead right now), @realDonaldTrump can proclaim victory and move on
