Secretary Chao, "Integrating AV technology into our transportation system has the potential to create new types of jobs. In addition, it could increase access to transportation for traditionally underserved communities — especially the elderly and people with disabilities."

Secretary Elaine L. Chao, "Decades of experience in highway safety makes clear that tough laws, effective enforcement and public service campaigns can change attitudes and actions, and save lives."

What They Are Saying – Leaders React to Joint Proposal to Revise Fuel Rules for Safety, Consumers, and the Environment https://t.co/x8bqCS0IO9 @NHTSAgov
Through the notice and comment process, correcting fuel economy standards to more appropriate and realistic levels for the American consumer will be one of the largest deregulatory and economic accomplishments of this Administration. #SAFERule @NHTSAgov https://t.co/HtxlQQ5H1e
@NHTSAgov estimates that the proposed new standards will save half a trillion dollars in regulatory costs for the U.S. economy and will save approximately 12,700 lives over the lifetime of the vehicles covered by the new rules (well more than 1,000 lives saved per year).
There is an urgent need to revisit the standards set by the previous administration. Compared with the preferred alternative outlined in the SAFE proposal, keeping in place the current 2012 standards would add $2,340 to the cost of owning a new car.
The SAFE Vehicles Proposal presents an alternative that would save thousands of lives and deliver economic benefits by modernizing the Nation’s vehicle fleet and enabling Americans to afford cars and light trucks that are newer, safer, cleaner, and more fuel efficient. @NHTSAgov
