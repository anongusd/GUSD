#BobWolff says landscaping is very important. It's the first thing a buyer sees #carealtorschat
#BobWolff specifically called out @DunnEdwards colors Swiss Coffee and Bone #carealtorschat
#BobWolff says colors most likely to entice buyers are ones by @DunnEdwards #carealtorschat
#BobWolff says a REALTOR can help w/staging for less $ than a professional stager. #carealtorschat
Still plenty of time left to join #BobWolff and ask about open houses and staging http://t.co/2xZIbfTcVx #carealtorschat
#BobWolff says burnt out lightbulbs equate to electrical problems in a buyer's mind #carealtorschat
Most ppl are visual and will spend $ on paint, landscaping and flooring. #carealtorschat
Least expensive improvements: make sure all light bulbs work, windows are clean, no foul odors, home looks bright. #carealtorschat
Consumers are asking about home improvements that yield the biggest return. Bob's answer: replacing the front door! #carealtorschat
Our expert says staging is nice, but not important in all homes --depends on the house #carealtorschat
Our housing expert says use all social media aves to get ppl to your open house. He says Craigslist works best! #carealtorschat
