'Forgive me God': 'Dee Money' came to Maine to sell drugs -- he'll spend the rest of his life in prison https://t.co/E2lx2rtwTr
"I don't have any kids up here in Maine, so the one statement was already wrong," Marble said from prison.
"These types of guys that come from Connecticut and New York, these guys, they come up here, they sell their heroin (and) then they go back home. Incidentally, half the time, they impregnate a young white girl before they leave,‚Äù LePage said.
"The traffickers -- these aren't people that take drugs,‚Äù former Gov. Paul LePage said less than two weeks after Marble's arrest. The governor referred to Marble by his nickname, ‚ÄúDee Money," which Marble used for selling drugs and for a side entertainment business.
‚ÄúDee Money" says he saw a market in Maine -- one of epidemic proportions, killing more than one Mainer a day. But, Marble said, what he sold, which, most often, were bags of heroin, did not kill anyone, though he does not have evidence to back up that claim.
David "Dee Money" Marble Jr. will never leave Maine. He is now in prison for life. A jury convicted Marble in November for the 2015 murders of Bonnie Royer and Eric Williams.	‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://t.co/9vQPgKXzxq
"These are guys that are named 'Dee Money,' 'Smoothie,' 'Shifty,'" former Maine Gov. Paul LePage said at a January 2016 town hall meeting. Tonight, "Dee Money" tells us his side of the story.

Now, all that is left for Collins are the clothes her daughter wore that Christmas morning. Police dropped them off after Marble's sentencing for Collins. A time of year meant for family no longer brings any holiday cheer. "I don't celebrate Christmas anymore," Collins said.
Royer was shot twice in the head. She was able to call 911, but died before help arrived. Inside her socks, investigators found a Suboxone wrapper and a knife. She was also carrying a pipe with drug residue on it in her waistband.
Royer's life ended around 3:30 a.m. Christmas Day 2015. Collins received a call from police, telling her that her daughter had been shot.
"She's a victim, no matter what,‚Äù Bonnie Royer‚Äôs mother, Christine Collins says. Bonnie was shot and killed while 4 months pregnant while on a drug run. "Even if she had lost her life to an overdose, it was just a way worse victim.‚Äù		‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://t.co/9vQPgKXzxq

Lincoln says he is happy to help and he is proud of the work of @CBP, many of whom are his neighbors. He also cites the increase in agents from about 80 before 9/11, to nearly 250 full-time now working in the Houlton sector, the sector which patrols all of Maine. @WMTWTV
"One of my neighbors just two weekends ago told me somebody was camping on a tent on my property -- and we were away that weekend,‚Äù Blaine Lincoln says about living on the Maine-Canada border in Hodgdon. @WMTWTV
In all, Lincoln estimates he has seen about 40 people attempt illegal entry. His most recent case was in August. "I was coming home from work and three kids were walking down the street. They just didn't fit the neighborhood. They weren't our Amish neighbors.‚Äù @WMTWTV
The number of people coming into the U.S. illegally through the northern border is much smaller than on the southern border. Arrests in the north make up just 1% of the nationwide total. In FY17, @CBP made 306,973 arrests at both borders, with 3,027 of them in the North. @WMTWTV
Now at 6 on @WMTWTV: In addition to cameras, sensors and @CBP agents on the 611-mile-long Maine-Canada border, there are also everyday people, keeping a watchful eye. In the era of "See something, say something," the federal government hopes neighbors report anything suspicious.

There were 54 arrests in Maine in FY 2018, an increase from 30 the year before. Numbers have steadily decreased from a high of 59 in fiscal year 2009. Nationally, after years of decline, the number of people trying to get through the northern border increased by 32%. @WMTWTV

@SFCret2 @WMTWTV It's a state referendum. Mainers also voted in 2016 for recreational marijuana stores, statewide.
Mainers voted again for ranked-choice voting in 2018 with 53% voting "Yes," which meant ranked-choice voting would be used for federal races in November.
26,814 Mainers left the question blank.
Pulled some stats about the 2016 ranked-choice referendum. Maine voters approved the referendum with a 52.1% majority, but the majority of voters in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, 52.7%, voted against ranked-choice voting. Either way, courts have ruled it is law, for now. https://t.co/2iznj2VRQK

@MESecOfState @golden4congress @RepPoliquin .@PaulMerrillWMTW is in court. Follow him for updates.
@MESecOfState @golden4congress @RepPoliquin "...Plaintiff Bruce Poliquin, the incumbent congressman in Maine‚Äôs Second Congressional District... seemingly recognizes that -- although the tabulation has not been completed‚Äîit is quite possible that he will not be elected under Maine law," @golden4congress' lawyers write.
@MESecOfState .@golden4congress' lawyers respond to @RepPoliquin lawsuit, "Thus, since at least May‚Äîalmost half a year ago‚Äîit has been clear that RCV would be	used in the 2018 General Election."
"Issuance of a court order to stop the RCV counting process before it is concluded, as the plaintiffs request, would be extremely disruptive and would jeopardize the integrity of the	process," @MESecOfState says in newly filed court documents.
According to paperwork just filed in federal court, Maine has until Dec. 14 to let Congress know who their votes chose to send to Washington.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to see what happens tomorrow. I‚Äôm going to be watching. I‚Äôm going to see what‚Äôs said. It‚Äôs possible they will be convincing. With all of that being said Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been for many years one of the most respected people in Washington.‚Äù
.@realDonaldTrump says it‚Äôs ‚Äúpossible‚Äù he could ‚Äúchange his mind‚Äù after Thursday‚Äôs hearing.
‚ÄúI could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also ‚Äî and I would look at the character ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think people are reluctant to come forward.‚Äù
‚ÄúPeople are going to have to make a decision. 36 years there‚Äôs no charge. All of a sudden the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out. Then you have this other con artist [@MichaelAvenatti] come out with another beauty today. I only say you have to look at the facts.‚Äù
