#SCOTUSlinkoftheday: @brkend &amp; @JessBravin cover yesterday's 5-4 vote by #SCOTUS to stay Louisiana abortion law from going into effect; by doing so, “justices likely committed themselves to giving a full review of the Louisiana case during their next term” https://t.co/fKLFwsK1hl
Here is a link to the order and accompanying Kavanaugh opinion. https://t.co/9aJxiE3QTW. The other Justices did not write an explanation for their vote. The injunction terminates if the Supreme Court doesn’t later grant cert, but it almost certainly will.
Tonight’s injunction suggests that the Court is not poised to pivot hard in the direction of limiting abortion rights. Both the Chief Justice (in granting the injunction) and Kavanaugh (in saying he would deny it pending factfinding) seem inclined to hew to existing precedent.
Kavanaugh’s dissent argues that the Court should wait &amp; see if abortion providers could secure required admitting privileges during a 45-day period before the statute’s restrictions take effect. If they could not, Kavanaugh would let the plaintiffs apply for a new injunction.
Breaking: SCOTUS 5-4 grants temporary injunction of Louisiana abortion statute while the case is litigated. Roberts joins the more liberal justices. Kavanaugh writes a dissent, for himself.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation this afternoon makes him the 114th justice of the Supreme Court; @ahoweblogger covers his nomination process and today’s 50-48 vote https://t.co/hnOWkCNbiO
By a 50-48 vote, the Senate confirms Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Update: We now expect the vote on confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court between 3:30 and 3:45 p.m. today.
The Senate is expected to take its final vote on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court at around 5 p.m. today.
The impending narrow Dem takeover of the House, powered by the harder left infuriated by upcoming conservative rulings, means Kavanaugh will likely face but survive an impeachment vote, a war that will cement a gaping partisan divide over SCOTUS’s legitimacy.
Today the Senate voted to advance Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final vote tomorrow, and 51 senators have now indicated they will vote for Kavanaugh, all but assuring his confirmation; @ahoweblogger has our report https://t.co/hc5Tempft2
Kavanaugh’s confirmation transforms SCOTUS, creating the most conservative majority ever, which — absent surprise health issues — will last decades. The left, opposing the majority and objecting to him personally, will likely begin an indefinite assault on the Court &amp; Kavanaugh.

Justice Kennedy was the obstacle to moving further to the right on issues like abortion and affirmative action. But just as important, the fact that his vote wasn’t certain dissuaded conservative interest groups and justices from taking up a host of big issues. That all changes.

The President’s take on making SCOTUS less political is utterly sincere. Conservatives care too much about this particular seat to listen.
Progressive groups will fall in line, and deeply respect Garland and the President’s choice, but their actual disappointment will be deep.

Democrats apparently have just been briefed by the White House, likely explaining the leaks now. Numerous press reports that it is Garland.
A Garland nomination would be the ultimate endorsement of qualifications in a nomination, over any attempt to score any political points.
