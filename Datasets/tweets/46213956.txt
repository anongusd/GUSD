“They fetishize this nonconservative in the Oval because it’s tribal. It’s us versus them, we’re right and they’re evil, and it’s created this Trump cult that dominates the party.” https://t.co/WjsjEJFjGG
Trump can have Kushner around at family dinners. Ignoring national security warnings and granting him a clearance invalidates every criticism Trump ever made about Clinton’s emails and places his own concerns above the nation’s. That is par for the course, but remains outrageous. https://t.co/bxGVFKFPwb
The thread you should read today. https://t.co/3mOtq2dArm
Stephon Clark’s was “broken windows” policing carried out to its literal extreme, and @MarcosBreton minces no words in holding the district attorney, Sacramento’s mayor, and @AGBecerra accountable for “the broken stool of criminal justice in California.” https://t.co/RF6wsIqejq
Take the local prosecutors off the case. We need independent investigators for every instance of police violence, especially those which result in death. I made this case when Tamir Rice’s killers got off easy, and I will stand by it. It needs to happen. https://t.co/2UvQDXebBl
I can understand Sacramento’s district attorney arguing that she could not have convicted Stephon Clark’s killers. But she went further. She practically made a case against Stephon Clark. Even if the young man wanted to die, that doesn’t absolve the crime. https://t.co/tFXBBroWGs
You should revisit @MarcosBreton’s warning from last April about Sacramento D.A. Anne Marie Schubert, “who is too compromised and too mistrusted to have the last word on whether [Stephon] Clark's killing was a crime.” https://t.co/Xw8xC5FLyI
His killers now excused by the district attorney, this may be the last day that many people ever read or hear Stephon Clark’s name. After his funeral, I argued for a more permanent way to remember victims of police violence, who are too easily forgotten. https://t.co/uJKsfd88GY
“Was a crime committed? There’s no question that a human being died,” said the Sacramento district attorney, Anne Marie Schubert. “But when we look at the facts and the law, and we follow our ethical responsibilities, the answer to that question is no.” https://t.co/rkelMXQObo
Stephon Clark was fatally shot by Sacramento police last March 18, who fired 20 bullets at him in the dark. He was hit eight times total, and six times in the back. Not one of the bullets struck him in the front of his body. He was unarmed at the time of the shooting. Yet, legal. https://t.co/apJ8t94qde
“The people’s agenda really depends upon democracy,” said @RepTerriSewell. “And the base of the democracy is the right to vote.” Before the anniversary of Selma’s Bloody Sunday, @fivefifths reports on a new effort to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/SupQKgYOXn
@jbouie Not my experience, sadly.
We have all these stories that show white characters shedding racism simply by being around black people. Yet so many white families don’t send their kids going to school with black ones. Separate and unequal lives on. But damn, do folks love those movies. https://t.co/X1k6CfsHsD

Steven Spielberg got his start directing television. It is remarkably obtuse of him to compare Oscar-nominated fare like ROMA, MUDBOUND, 13TH, and BEASTS OF NO NATION to so-called “TV movies.” What an insult to those films and filmmakers. https://t.co/iKzFfaZEJ3

@briebriejoy I’d say Sanders’s statement today was more dismissive. I sense that we’ll agree to disagree. I’d co-sign @ijbailey in that Harris needs to clarify her message on reparations. The Root interview is different than theGrio one. I’ll give your pieces a read. https://t.co/qampsWXDN2
@briebriejoy That is a certain interpretation; you posted one video. I’m waiting for more specifics to come forward. But at least others appear to have given the topic some thought and are not dismissive to the very notion. There is still room to push them to be more specific, to be better.
Thread. https://t.co/ijYkrtZlod
Characterizing reparations for black Americans is simply “writing out a check” is needlessly dismissive of a policy that, whether Sanders likes it or not, is on the table in this primary. In this response, he sounded like he hadn’t devoted a single serious thought to the topic. https://t.co/VsxrbPwNwY
I wrote about why @RashidaTlaib did the right thing when she confronted @MarkMeadows. She followed the @jsmooth995 principle: When you want to tell folks they did something racist, have the “what they did” conversation, not the “who they are” conversation. https://t.co/13AL57EF9g

“It’s all too easy,” @kashanacauley writes; “to picture a version of yesterday’s hearing where there was no Rashida Tlaib there to remind us that racist acts outweigh accusations of racism.” It may be easy, but this is a smart point I didn’t see many make. https://t.co/JbzdOXvVuX
When you’ve convinced yourself that “racism” actually means “white guys unfairly accused of racism,” you end up with the aggrieved whining we saw from Mark Meadows. @michelleinbklyn, on how white fragility is being weaponized to normalize Trump’s bigotry. https://t.co/g8ggVNJvvT

Read @zakcheneyrice on Justin Fairfax, whose self-serving invocation of lynching is “stemming from a mix of indignation and a misreading of history at best, and at worst, an effort to hide nefarious deeds by equating his accusers with racist terrorists.” https://t.co/cu4gyvFpbY

It turns out that Trump did make some kind of deal at this summit, after all.

No one is spared. https://t.co/rdyZBrtZ1f
Jussie Smollett apparently staged a lynching attempt on himself. Justin Fairfax became the latest to say that being accused of sexual violence was tantamount to lynching. I wrote about men misusing the iconography of racial terrorism for the own purposes. https://t.co/U62OQSgB8u
If Pam Northam had done this to a white child, perhaps she may gotten somewhere.

Rashida Tlaib did nothing wrong. 	Elijah Cummings needs a better friend.	Mark Meadows needs a dictionary.	So do many in the press.	She did not call him a racist.	She called the act racist.	Her statement was not racist.	Using black folks as props is racist.	https://t.co/P4uANuzkSe
This was a good use of the time allotted. @RepAOC not only asked Cohen questions that revealed newsworthy information which merit further investigation, but ones pertinent to her district. If you missed it live, as I did, this is her questioning in full.  https://t.co/fUxgq4e5BN
At the end of January, right before @LynnePatton took residence in New York City public housing, @SecretaryCarson appointed a federal monitor to oversee @NYCHA. Read this @kristoncapps report to catch up. https://t.co/JBKLOBz9Sv
Don’t forget: @LynnePatton is supposed to be in midst of her month-long publicity stunt, staying in NYC public housing to spotlight its decrepit conditions (see below). As @TracyJan noted, Patton interrupted her stay to perform that role for Meadows today. https://t.co/I33WGXtamk
In a smart bit of reporting, @TracyJan interviewed HUD official @LynnePatton via text message from the Cohen hearing after she allowed herself to be used to refute Cohen’s accusations that Trump is a racist. Patton didn’t think that she was a token. Okay. https://t.co/7JNn6n3C5R
Mark Meadows tried to defend Trump from Michael Cohen’s charges of racism by having one black Trump appointee stand up to refute him. @DLind examined that moment not just by critiquing Meadows, but by picking apart the faulty frame Cohen had established. https://t.co/UxZjYnkB7F
This is a word. https://t.co/iQDD0oPAka
Republicans appear to have concluded that that the best tactic for defending a president who openly violates the emoluments clause is hounding a witness headed to prison for three years about pursuing potential future book and film deals.
I’m baffled as to why anyone was impressed why anyone was impressed with that @justinamash question. What truth is Trump most afraid of? Seriously?
I mean, the Democrats could quite literally read from this @MotherJones list of questions and do infinitely better than they have been doing thus far in the Michael Cohen hearing. An absence of fuckery is not inherently substantive. They need to do better. https://t.co/9k08iPp08H

The “I have a black friend” defense, in real time. What we saw with @RepMarkMeadows was not a misunderstanding of racism in America. It was gaslighting. It was a willful perversion of the meaning of racism, meant to twist and dilute the definition to defend what is indefensible.
I’m trying to imagine being a grown man and being worried about someone seeing my SAT scores. I honestly do not remember mine, and I’m nearly 30 years younger than Trump.

The continued stigmatization of the incarcerated is a common theme of Republican attacks on Michael Cohen, despite the fact that the man sitting before them was on the Republican National Committee last summer. Some of the folks with the worst character have never been to prison.

Michael Cohen’s assessment of Donald Trump’s character may not matter to you. We may know that he is a con man, racist, and a cheat based upon the available evidence. This is all worth watching because there is more evidence to be uncovered. More to learn. https://t.co/kZ7LKkhIgQ

Every single Republican, including and especially Trump, who ever whined disingenuously about voter fraud should be asked about what has happened to the Mark Harris campaign in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. To get them on the record or for laughs, if nothing else.

@blakehounshell CNN, for what it’s worth, struggled for years to fill that 8pm hole before it was wise enough to plug Anderson—who was a fill-in host when I worked there—into that slot. The Chung show was a good project that wasn’t given enough time to flourish. A theme of my career (TNR, MTV).
@blakehounshell I was a PA on Connie Chung’s primetime show. We were in preparations to cover the war, but suddenly she was relegated to doing news updates and the show was canceled. I got a job offer outside of cable news, and was thankful for the rescue. Other colleagues were not so lucky.
@blakehounshell The snark here is strange, considering that you likely have no idea which show I’m even talking about or have any context whatsoever. But hey, do you.
I can co-sign all of this. I was a production assistant at CNN in 2002, and saw this exact same pattern developing. It is the main reason why I left the following year, as our highly-rated primetime show was sidelined as the network prepared to cover the Iraq War. https://t.co/JKwUGy8wOw

@ridgej @latchkeykidd @RollingStone @ThePlainDealer @PDNewsGuild @RachelDissell @BrieZeltner Indeed. Brie is a former classmate of mine, and I know both her and Rachel’s work well.
Contextualize this. Clarence Thomas wants to loosen libel laws. Egypt detained and ejected an American journalist. Then there was the would-be mass killer who targeted Trump critics in Congress and the press. Just this week. And @POTUS doesn’t give a shit. https://t.co/UJo6xP5rFo
If he actually did this, I fear that I’ll never fully understand what Jussie Smollett was thinking. I hope that he gets help, and doesn’t hurt anyone else going forward, including himself.
Nothing good will come of this. Leaving Jussie’s fate and motives aside for the moment, I fear that we don’t know the true victims yet. There will be folks who use this as justification for not believing accusers of every stripe. They were already cowards. https://t.co/dzZ24TEoL5

A domestic terrorist within the military ranks. Fifteen guns, and a lengthy hit list that included Democratic members of Congress, liberal journalists, and cable news hosts.

I had been looking forward to @JasonReitman’s take on GHOSTBUSTERS. Then he went and said that stupid shit about “handing the movie back to the fans,” as if the female cast had stolen the original from our precious little boy memories or something. I’ll probably skip it now.
This story is what has Trump so upset today. Both he and his defenders argue that the Constitution grants him the power and immunity to do what he is clearly doing. The most harrowing thing was never Trump, but our lack of preparedness for a man like him. https://t.co/WvKwm8qkTW
Trump’s declaration of a national emergency is, at its heart, a president taking money that Congress refused to give him. But Mitch McConnell and his fellow sycophants are ready to abdicate the power of the purse. So why should we pay them, @crampell asks? https://t.co/cQL178A3Hc
Vallejo police shot Willie McCoy about 25 times by on February 9th, according to the McCoy family lawyer. Bullets struck the center of his face and throat and blew off part of his ear. McCoy was asleep when the encounter began. He was only 20 when he died. https://t.co/csfu2IVEBj
Journalistically, this is indefensible. Yes, folks left and right may snark that CNN isn’t journalism, but there are many professionals who work and report there. They are tarnished by this. Hiring this person as a paid pundit would have been questionable. https://t.co/VI2ItomOhv

The climate is becoming catastrophic at a faster rate. @dwallacewells, whose book is out today, argues that fear may be the best way to rouse Americans from either denial or the self-satisfaction of hybrid car purchases. This essay is a punch to the chest. https://t.co/o0ccYHXlot
The reasons why @BernieSanders didn’t do very well with black voters overall last time are myriad and complex. But as his HBCU tour organizer from that campaign said, “Those first hires are going to let a lot of us know if he learned from the 2016 cycle.” https://t.co/EG4civrA5V
Sanders was asked whether he is still the best “face of the New Democratic Party.” His response, in part: “We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age.” https://t.co/ZzFEutbPVK
Bernie Sanders is in. Democratic opponents will test him, @mtaibbi notes, “to see if he’s found a way to make his core message about combating corporate influence and fighting for the working poor meld with modern ideas about diversity and social justice.” https://t.co/SwarnwUm6h
@SandyDarity @KathaPollitt Indeed so, Sandy.

“There’s another proposal that belongs on the progressive to-do list: universal affordable high-quality child care,” @KathaPollitt argued recently, prioritizing above free college. “It would help more people and do more to change society for the better.” https://t.co/HYqHVQEBeM
Warren’s plan seeks to make access to child care universal, @CitizenCohn reports, by offering federal funds to providers that offer care at their facilities on a sliding income scale. On an initial read, this all looks very plausible. https://t.co/SO3TdLeZK6
Korryn Gaines’s family will appeal this ruling, but we see yet another reason why “financial justice” is such a false goal. The civil verdict was punitive, and $38 million would obviously help her son. But we are reminded how temporary that victory can be. https://t.co/pZcD8R8CxH
A small-town Alabama newspaper editor published an editorial requesting domestic terrorism. “If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we'd all been better off," Goodloe Sutton told @MGMAdvertiser, adding that he wants lawmakers lynched. https://t.co/m7myWBgClq

Virtually every mass shooter seems to have a history of domestic violence or some other misogynistic behavior. Noting that fact and even passing laws to address it hasn’t ended it. The system was in place to stop the Aurora, Illinois gunman, and it failed. https://t.co/3SjN7rUEHD
The gunman who killed five people at his workplace outside of Chicago last week had served prison time for beating his former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbing her. The state’s background check system failed to prevent him from buying a firearm. https://t.co/dXWsL5QaEo
This wasn’t an invitation for folks to give me a history lesson on Presidents’ Day, but I see some went there. In a day and age when public officials are too often treated and covered like celebrities, it is worth examining why we have a holiday that so broadly honors an office.
No matter the politics or histories of the presidents being celebrated, it has always struck me as peculiar that we might have a holiday to honor people whose sole accomplishment to qualify for that honor was to be elected to a position of public service.
Toni Morrison’s @NewYorker essay in the wake of Donald Trump’s election remains one of the most powerful and persuasive pieces of argument written in all the time since. https://t.co/dp1u4AH2bU
Toni Morrison is 88 today, and we all should explore and revisit her work today to honor her. Her birthday feels like a holiday of sorts for black writers, in particular, and this 2003 Hilton Als profile illustrates why. https://t.co/8LlX8Cd9vx
The obvious answer to this question is “no.” Neither Colin Kaepernick nor Eric Reid sold out by accepting a settlement for the money they were due for careers the NFL colluded to keep them from. But the headline undersells @WCRhoden’s perspective on this. https://t.co/Dll9G5LqYz

I wrote about the allegations of sexual violence against Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, and offered a way forward: start the impeachment process so that he gets the investigation he demands and his accusers get a chance to present their case. https://t.co/0tGuDAYTGE
This is disappointing. Kaepernick and Reid aren’t sellouts by any stretch. But they had the potential to expose the depths of the NFL’s collusion, and possibly to prevent it from happening again. Money is something the owners have. This is not a deterrent. https://t.co/5Nh3mhQDMo
Trump should be impeached. As @YAppelbaum reminds us, it is a process for accountability, not simply an outcome. I revisited his argument today for obvious reasons. It is sharp and intellectually honest, and its relevance and urgency only continue to grow. https://t.co/z2kVhn7UYU

“Of course I see color as an adult,” @HowardSchultz told @washingtonpost. “Of course I understand the issues of racial justice.” What he said 48 hours earlier: “I didn’t see color as a young boy and I honestly don’t see color now.” Color me unconvinced. https://t.co/nNiGZ0ya94

It may change, so I’ll just type the original headline here: “Booker on blackface controversy: ‘Put yourself in a white person’s position.’” That is so misleading that it is actually irresponsible. It is less than two minutes long. Give it a look and see. https://t.co/xRCtEYjbVF
@emayfarris Yes, indeed. He needed more context. https://t.co/BqNb0aKNyn
I’ll be clear about what I mean. Northam is actually correct about indentured servants arriving in 1619. I am happy that he is learning. He needs to grasp the history. But if he stays, what policies will he enact? Virginians need him to fight systemic racism, not pass an AP exam.
We don’t have time for this. https://t.co/84I2zjlrxd
Black voters in Virginia are the ones being put in more of a bind than the Democratic Party by this mess involving Northam, Fairfax, and Herring, and you can all but hear that as you read the quotes in this @emarvelous report. https://t.co/FKvi6He0Zj
@ovie52009 @jmartNYT @daveweigel The tweet, even in isolation, doesn’t come close to expressing any of that. It is a response to Jonathan’s question, and states a hypothetical. I’ve written an entire column stating my belief that Northam should resign, and for more reasons than just the blackface. Ease back.
@daveweigel @jmartNYT I had forgotten that momentarily; thanks for the reminder, Dave.
@ovie52009 @jmartNYT @daveweigel I’m in support of full accountability in every respect, for every man involved in this scandal. You’re responding to a hypothetical scenario that I put forward as though I stated that was my belief. That is wrong.
@jmartNYT @daveweigel Yes. If Democrats have a lick of sense, both Northam and Herring will be primaried by women of color when they are up for re-election, should they choose to even run again. That is if both men even make it that far without resigning.
Note the result from black Virginians. Most would keep a governor who is now in their pocket, but his Blackness 101 course shows he arrived in office unprepared to address (or even unaware of) systemic racism. That should disqualify any candidate nowadays. https://t.co/SsKET5eP28
Author and domestic-violence activist @Sil_Lai accused @extratv host A.J. Calloway of sexual assault in 2006, when he was employed by the show. In January, more accusers came forward and @THR was preparing a story detailing additional claims against him. https://t.co/DDxYHDtXiY
If Fairfax is impeached and replaced by a black woman—say, state senator Jennifer McClellan or delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy—how is this all that much of a bind for Democrats? If racial representation is their main concern, that is a relatively easy fix. https://t.co/eGwvIEHXJx
Trump put up a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office. He knows who he is, and likely knows what he did. And even if he didn’t yet know the full history of the Trail of Tears, something called the “Trail of Tears” is usually not something that you use as fodder for a joke.
I try to never dignify this man’s tweets, but there is little doubt here that he uses “TRAIL” to evoke the genocidal Trail of Tears, and does so to land a political jab. Warren has taken justifiable heat on this issue—but he used the murders of Indigenous people as a punchline. https://t.co/LiyK2iruDF
Elizabeth Warren has officially launched. Not merely was her location—the site of a women’s labor strike more than a century ago—a compelling choice, but she told a key truth about structural change that is necessary after replacing Trump. A good start. https://t.co/Hn1Gi5OBGj
Northam’s actions in the Union Hill pipeline drama are as disqualifying as the blackface. Before this all began and he started reading “Roots,” the governor was all too ready to let a historic black community in Virginia be put at risk of being poisoned. https://t.co/hjigGfS8CL
"I think he'll leave a legacy that he didn't care," said one Virginia activist. "He might as well be one of those saying there's no climate change, there's no global warming. He might as well be one of those because that's what his actions have shown us." https://t.co/okonUNq9Ue
Ralph Northam’s heart may very well be in the right place. However, blackface or not, this sounds like he showed up to the governor’s mansion unprepared to fight systemic racism. He is now cramming for the test, trying to learn it on the job. Unacceptable. https://t.co/DEPdZifOoM
I spoke to @RevDrBarber about Northam. We didn’t talk much about blackface. He wanted to discuss a planned pipeline that will go through a historic black community. “That’s racism,” Barber said. “I want to know where he stands on that!” I looked into it. https://t.co/hjigGfS8CL
Northam can read all the articles he wants about reparations. But as @RevDrBarber notes correctly, that won’t make amends. What will is, as Barber writes, “restitution that addresses systemic harm.” And Northam can work towards that as a private citizen. https://t.co/8ZSdEnww1H

Virginia's Democratic attorney general, third in line of succession for governor, admits that he also wore blackface.

“I find it perplexing that more pundits and more of the political establishment aren’t discussing Stacey in the same breath that they discuss Beto,” the @WorkingFamilies nat’l director told @AsteadWesley. Abrams will proceed at her own pace, but I agree. https://t.co/6Lqu1gGNOC
Stacey Abrams gave the true State of the Union last night. In a fraction of the time, she outlined far more constructive policy measures than did @POTUS. But @fivefifths notes correctly that her emphasis on voting rights is what distinguished her response. https://t.co/aKv2Yq5m8v
Trump has been investigated by his own government, via the special counsel, since damn near the start of his presidency. By his account, it has been the best presidency ever. @conor64 doesn’t take long to expose the flaw in his State of the Union argument. https://t.co/CpZ9l4TXoV
@QJames @washingtonpost Why not, Quentin? Just spell it out, since you seem to know what’s up. All I said is that she is credible and should be taken seriously. I base this not merely upon some kind of intuition, but my reporting. Have something to share with the rest of the class? Please, enlighten us.
Trump’s State of the Union should be criticized for ignoring poor people, the shutdown, climate change, and Puerto Rico. But it will be most remembered for this line: “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.” https://t.co/3ITXGCnelB
@loafingcactus @washingtonpost Yes. https://t.co/qZOwSq8olU

Stacey Abrams talked about actual problems that the nation faces: voter suppression, closing factories, isolated farmers, caged migrant children. She made it personal, real, true. Trump largely ignored those in favor of invented crises and exceptionalism. https://t.co/hLNiD2zaPo
That was the @staceyabrams I covered. https://t.co/lhMiG6gNQz
Stacey Abrams is talking about an America that actually exists.
He never mentioned any of the children who his government kidnapped and incarcerated, and in a couple cases, saw die in its custody. He never mentioned Puerto Rico, even to give an update on the recovery he says is going so well. Yemen, nothing. How are these not the headlines?
It is as it Stephen Miller cribbed from past addresses and changed a few platitudes. It is so utterly unconvincing coming from this charlatan of a president, and I regret that we put ourselves through that as a country.
To hear Trump say that the United States was “founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination and control” is jarring in and of itself. But to hear him decry socialism minutes after he called upon Congress to control women’s bodies was even more so.
Trump just lied about late-term abortion, and used God as cover. The legislation he requested also has no chance. It was likely a signal to red states. There are no “unborn children.” There are children and fetuses. And there are women, whom he called “mothers” before the fact.
I am not a pessimist, but I am not a fool. There will still be people all over the world dying from HIV and AIDS in 10 years, and not merely due to the scientific hurdles. It will be due in large part to men like Mike Pence, and this president’s utter incompetence.
I don’t know how I feel about that. He just ended a racist tirade by celebrating women, and then everyone was all, “USA!”
Walls don’t work. This wall would kill.
I don’t expect him to mention Puerto Rico once.
It is legal to seek asylum. No human being is an “alien.” Repeat this ad nauseum, if necessary.
Okay, that’s done. Back to the racism.

Trump considers himself a crusader against trafficking. It’s key to his argument for the border wall. It is a mischaracterization, @Jenna_Krajeski reports. She not only details his lies about the crisis, but shows just how his policies are making it worse. https://t.co/aVGmiGUvjk

Trump is such a coward. He never says any of this stuff to the faces of the folks whom he criticizes. With the exception of McCain—yes, read it—he’ll have an opportunity tonight to do just that. I have my money on him “choking like a dog,” as he would say. https://t.co/5fXlC2bq7M

I wrote for @newrepublic years ago about the dangers of football, my own complicated relationship with the sport (yes, that’s me and my dad, 30 years ago), and how I feel that it mirrors America. My argument stands. Before this Super Bowl, give it a read. https://t.co/0p9WEcTTqp https://t.co/etwCbVqnAy
If you are able to watch @RealSportsHBO’s newest episode this Super Bowl Sunday, make a point to do so. It addresses the growing class disparity in football, with low-income kids increasingly becoming the labor force in a sport that isn’t yet safe enough. https://t.co/sEa0qaQvvu
By steering his son away from football, Trump is speaking to a larger trend that we are seeing with whiter, wealthier families. As @AlanaSemuels recently reported, the sport and its extreme health risks are being relegated to the poorest and the blackest. https://t.co/phv8dbq9y5
The second part of @margbrennan’s Trump interview that I found useful was the bit that most Americans will find most irrelevant: when she asks him whether he will allow his youngest son to play football. https://t.co/ck6b3vezKt
This was one of the dangers in hyping the FIRST STEP Act victory in the way that some folks did. Van Jones even said that Trump was on his way to becoming the “uniter-in-chief.” Folks, he thinks he is finished with criminal justice reform. That’s all we’re ever getting from him.
Continuing his tradition of mischaracterizing Kaepernick’s protest and going unchallenged by the interviewer after he does so, Trump displays barely a passing interest in an issue that literally means life or death for people who look like me. Even after he “took care of that.”
Trump ignores @margbrennan’s (actually incorrect) encapsulation of Kaepernick’s argument, and insists that he has pretty much solved the issue that Kaepernick was complaining about by making the FIRST STEP Act law. All it took was one piece of criminal justice legislation, folks!
In the @CBSNews interview, there is the lying you may expect: about Pelosi, migrants, Russia, black people liking him. But two bits concerning football stand out, and not just because it is Super Bowl Sunday. Read this bit where @margbrennan asks Trump about Colin Kaepernick. https://t.co/JDlTy6UX5v
Today’s Super Bowl coverage will feature @POTUS lying to us. All due respect to @margbrennan, but we really don’t need to see or hear Trump say these words to grasp their full meaning. They should stand on their own, independent of his charlatan theatrics. https://t.co/4IKyOGhJJO
Candice Payne saved lives. She got more than 100 homeless people into a hotel during Chicago’s recent arctic cold, thanks to her credit card and community. “It all sounded like a rich person did this, but I’m just a little black girl from the South Side.” https://t.co/VMV0bUTkGF
Racism doesn’t just look like a white man in blackface or a Klan hood. Sometimes, it looks like a @senatemajldr calling increased ballot access a “power grab.” My latest for @RollingStone, on Mitch McConnell, persisting nevertheless with voter suppression. https://t.co/8Y70FqhJY6
“Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.” https://t.co/2MrT9mqbzc
Justin Fairfax, Virginia’s lone black statewide official, has spoken out. At today’s presser, Northam made it sound like his lieutenant governor had his back. Yeah, way back. Fairfax didn’t demand that he resign. But it should be clear from this where he stands. This is incisive. https://t.co/bUv308vM2n
Northam refused to grasp that blackface is dehumanization. Wearing us like costumes makes it easier to render us homeless. Easier to take away our ballots. Easier to silence our voices in the public square. To miseducate us. To let us die in hospitals. To kill us with impunity.
This is what happens when you think your casual racism won’t ever cost you anything.
Let’s say that Northam admitting the San Antonio story was him getting ahead of bad press. How, exactly, does Northam think that admitting yet another episode of blackface leave him in a position to effectively govern going forward?
Admitting to blackface seems okay, in the governor’s view, as long as there is no photographic evidence. “That’s not who I am,” he said of the Sambo in the photo. But it was him when he put that shoe polish on his face at that party in San Antonio. So who are you, @RalphNortham?
Such an essential point. Even if Northam hadn’t ever been elected @GovernorVA, he is a doctor. Medical school is when, perhaps more than any other time, one should be learning how to save every life and to treat every human being with dignity. That photo represents the opposite. https://t.co/MN3QwrGcZC

It would be convenient for conservatives if racism could be solely captured in a photo or in a word. If racial slights were limited to the easily observable, there could be no targeting the systemic problems that afford so many unearned advantages to the people whom they protect.
Demanding that Northam resign is not doing the dirty work of conservatives who targeted him for the abortion bill he signed. Now, it is about mitigating damage. Not for Democrats. For us. Every moment he stays in office furthers a misconception that racism is just about imagery.
Ralph Northam is embarrassing himself. If he was truly convinced that he never dressed as a Sambo or a Klansman and then posed for a photo, he would have known that yesterday. This insults the intelligence of every black voter who helped put him in office. https://t.co/nQ48wgX2JY

If “racism has no place in Virginia,” per the chairman of the state GOP, then why are Republicans in the Virginia Senate continuing to honor Robert E. Lee on his birthday? Why is there only one black statewide official, and why is he alone in his protest? https://t.co/FkoT1p5nZM
“Racism has no place in Virginia,” said Jack Wilson, chairman of the @VA_GOP. Wilson endorsed Corey Stewart, an actual neo-Confederate for U.S. Senate. “A Senator Stewart would be much better for Virginia and Republicans than a Senator Kaine,” Wilson was quoted saying last July.
This is extraordinarily racist, and @RalphNortham and his defenders should not use youth to excuse it. Ironically, the conservatives who dug this up may replace him with his black lieutenant, a man who sat out when Virginia paid tribute to Robert E. Lee. https://t.co/LwaPgfI0Ru

I still haven’t decided how I feel about Trump visiting the memorial. Do I want a man so demonstrably opposed to Dr. King’s goals sitting the day out altogether, or should he simply go through the motions of commemoration? @Eugene_Scott keeps me thinking. https://t.co/tKeDesMR7A
Michelle Alexander argues persuasively in @nytopinion that the same kind of moral courage that Dr. King demonstrated in 1967 when he opposed the Vietnam War is what we need to summon now to disparage the human rights abuses ongoing in Israel. https://t.co/cFMyI2tyKa
When Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday, @fivefifths argues, the man became a modern Founding Father. That annual celebration now allows for people who oppose his goals to lay a wreath at his memorial, or the NRA and CIA to tweet out remembrances. https://t.co/vIQNKF2eoA
I wrote several years ago that Martin Luther King, Jr. doesn’t belong to any of us, and the vain fight to claim the mantle of his legacy is one that the enemies of racial progress want. My argument stands. https://t.co/fjIkGtFqIp

@YAppelbaum It depends upon your perspective. Greatness can be observed and even appreciated. I was in awe of Michael Jordan, Derek Jeter, and John Elway—but I did not enjoy them. They were obstacles to my enjoyment as a sports fan. Greatness at your team's expense is not all that enjoyable.
None of us own Martin Luther King, Jr.’s legacy. That doesn’t mean we can’t see when someone is spitting upon that legacy. Trump does so with virtually every breath and action he takes. @julianzelizer, on what @VP said. https://t.co/CjXmppir70

Precisely. This shutdown isn’t some partisan squabble, nor is it Trump and Pelosi tussling in some metaphorical sandbox. This shutdown is a hostage crisis. The president has a ransom demand, and the government and its employees are his captives. It is not that difficult to grasp. https://t.co/3w1bI9GQjq
Nathan Phillips told @nwarikoo that he was playing peacemaker, blocking that (mostly) white Catholic school mob from going after a group of Black Hebrew Israelites. “There was that moment when I realized I've put myself between beast and prey,” he said. https://t.co/5nnawYubKr
The Indigenous People’s March should not be defined by the Joker grin of that white kid with the MAGA hat. But as this @byTheresaVargas notes, the shutdown has an intellectual cost: tens of thousands who might have otherwise visited @SmithsonianNMAI can’t. https://t.co/Tc3KkxFuem

The framing of @MarkLandler’s Jan. 17 story is such rubbish that I won’t share it. Pelosi’s State of the Union letter may have been a power move, but ultimately was about security. Trump’s was the exact opposite. Implying they’re both kids in a sandbox is irresponsible and lazy.
They ripped them away from their families. Then they lost count. “How many more children were separated is unknown,” reads a key line of a new report from the @HHSGov inspector general about thousands more migrant kids we never heard of. Read @tessastuart. https://t.co/00jcHYzhhW

Failing to hire black journalists is not some sort of benign omission. It isn’t about the lack of candidates or professional networks—or whatever excuse news executives make for their racism or their laziness. It is a choice, and networks and publications keep paying for it.

Trump also said that he would “100 percent” declare a national emergency to get his wall ransom if Democrats don’t capitulate. But if this was a true emergency, why wouldn’t he declare it now? This is a question that every Republican should have to answer. https://t.co/edN0b4dTF1
Trump just told @kwelkernbc that “the buck stops with everyone” with regard to the shutdown—both a lie and a cowardly refusal to be accountable. Also said that he’d rather negotiate with China than the Democrats. Today’s “I can’t believe that he is president” moment came early.

I wrote in December about Warren’s rollout of her DNA test and her Native heritage. I agree with the Senator on a number of policy points and look forward to her presidential candidacy, but I stand by this argument. This merits both coverage and criticism. https://t.co/Vfkl1U3RYW
I don’t know if this response addresses the core problem that many, Native American or not, had with Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test. She clearly understands the specificities of what she revealed, but isn’t yet grasping why the test itself was a bad decision. https://t.co/zhXYfaXOgd
“It’s deflection,” said #MeToo movement founder @TaranaBurke in a @RollingStone report last June. “Largely, R. Kelly’s audience is black women and girls. We have huge buying power, and I hope they recognize that. They should be paying attention.” https://t.co/OzemCQs2kA

@djrothkopf @MittRomney So why then take rather blind shots at people who critique the Romney column? I am not sure what you sought to accomplish.

Rubbish. No one should pull their punches on @MittRomney for fear that if they don't, he won't actually challenge Trump's agenda, or even vote to impeach him. Now that would be cynical, David.

Jazmine Barnes was murdered on Dec. 30 in Harris County, Texas. She was in the car with her mom and her sisters when a man described as white, bearded, and in his 40s began firing at them. She was only 7 years old. As of now, her killer is still at large. https://t.co/xMGscs3a7L
What @MittRomney either fails to realize or hopes that we do is that Trump’s wretched character is not the primary crisis that we all face. The president’s policies—many of which Romney praises here, along with his judicial appointments—do the most damage. https://t.co/rC0sClU0CK

Thanks for reading me here, and elsewhere.
If you should find yourself struggling, for whatever reason, own that struggle. Do not try to shrug it off, or overcome it with “balls” or sheer will and determination. Those all may come in handy, but I recommend that you start with vulnerability. Not every fault is a weakness.
That all said, I think that in a year in which I published a @TIME cover story, landed a dream job at @RollingStone, moderated a @Comic_Con panel, made my high school’s hall of fame, and had dinner with my parents at the same table, the best thing I did in 2018 was go to therapy.
I also got to do amazing things, like moderate a panel at @Comic_Con. Again, interview Spike Lee (twice). Do panels and talks with the likes of @BootsRiley, @MichaelEDyson, @mollycrabapple, @davidhogg111, @adamjohnfoss, and @MitchLandrieu. More to come in 2019, I hope. https://t.co/oEbJ3XyuLX
I also have my parents and my (social media-shy) wife to thank for joy.

It also helps to have people in your life who make you smile and laugh constantly. Thanks to folks like @ClintSmithIII, @AngeliqueRoche, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @YoditTewolde, @Lilly_Works, @katieorenst, and especially @ChloeAngyal who helped me enjoy some good moments in 2018. https://t.co/W0Fzglm73r
I won’t go into too many details here, but I will say that 2018 was the first time that I understood what depression felt like. What brought it on? A combination of things. But the realization came through therapy and introspection, both of which I highly recommend to you all.
I can’t say how many positive words that I heard and read about my work at @RollingStone from kind people here on Twitter, at events, or even on the street. It was enriching in a way that folks may never realize, as 2018 was a very tough year for me in my personal life.
My work in 2018 was enriching and enraging. I was able to sit down with Spike Lee, whose work had immeasurable influence on me as a young man. I saw Sacramento after Stephon Clark, and Tallahassee with Andrew Gillum. But perhaps nothing moved me like this. https://t.co/VhZkUQLi05

That was the most fun we fans have had for a good while, @Browns. End of the beginning.
John Kelly, according to @maggieNYT’s reporting, “frequently told people that Mr. Trump was not up to role of president.” Which people? He certainly never told us. https://t.co/KuUdQwHMpr
I am not entirely sure what John Kelly hoped to accomplish with that interview. It is as if he had been covered in fecal matter, residue from serving President Trump, and he now hopes that we do not notice when he vainly attempts to wipe it off. We can still smell you, General.
I do wonder how that particular Kelly quote will rattle about inside Trump’s skull once the president learns about it. (He won’t read it.) On one hand, it is an outgoing staffer covering for him. On the other, it makes him sound as if he was subject to the whims of Jeff Sessions.
In March of 2017, John Kelly talked about @DHSgov considering the separation of children from their parents as a method of deterring unauthorized immigration into the United States. How can he say that he was “surprised” by Sessions more than a year later? https://t.co/dj70e9ZV6s
While Sessions undeniably had a key role in family separation, blaming him exclusively for it is ahistorical. Kelly would have us believe that after @TheJusticeDept’s order, there was absolutely nothing Trump could have done to slow this policy or end it altogether.
One, Kelly appears to concede that Trump’s family separation are both inherently bad policies. This is someone seeking to avoid looking having he and @POTUS appear like villains. Ignoring his own role, he displays a consciousness of guilt while simultaneously trying to avoid it.
“What happened was Jeff Sessions, he was the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,” John Kelly told @mollymotoole. “He surprised us.” That is such a fascinating quote, for many reasons.
John Kelly made news with “To be honest, it’s not a wall,” but I was struck more by what is absent here. An apology to @RepWilson for his lies about her. Accountability for his role in Trump’s immigration crusade. Recanting his Confederate apologism. Alas. https://t.co/aXTOqxLI9C
Per @maggieNYT, Trump has been telling folks that the shutdown “will slow down the Democrats in other pursuits, such as oversight investigations into his administration.” I ask this honestly: is there any legitimate reason to think that this would be true? https://t.co/rLdX3hY3M2

My principal issue with Bernie is, for all his frankness and leftward pushing on economics, he, as @zakcheneyrice put it recently, “echoes a broader tendency in American politics to entice such voters by lying to them about how racist they actually are.” https://t.co/m1x46luF8J
@mcbyrne That was also ten years apart, in two completely different elections. Besides, you helped make my point: there is still, after a decade, a significant part of the Dem electorate that ultimately chooses in the general election the candidate best equipped to guard white patriarchy.
@GDimieri If you are claiming that the numbers NPR reported are wrong, please offer proof of that.
More than one in 10 Sanders voters backed Trump in the general. Nearly half of those people disagreed with the idea that "white people have advantages." As others have said before, the racism is the central concern here—not the progressive litmus test. https://t.co/QBUV0cPesp
Alluded to but left underexamined in this @jonathanchait argument is the fact that a significant part of Bernie’s support came from white guys unwilling to vote for a woman. Those men may have just found a new white, male candidate to back in Beto. https://t.co/FnRJZCECLP
This argument sums up the main reason that I feel Sanders shouldn’t run again. Any white challenger to Trump will have to prove her or his bonafides on issues specific to voters of color. Sanders may not have the widest credibility gap, but it’ll be close. https://t.co/5TXlC8x8xU
This @jmartNYT and @melbournecoal report is full of quotes from people who seem as though they don’t want to just come out and and say that Bernie Sanders should sit this one out, for any number of reasons. I agree. O’Rourke, for me, isn’t the reason why. https://t.co/N2F8HIxgFK

Trump is set to release thousands of migrant families from detention along the border over the next several days, per @DLind. Good news, right? Well, they’ll likely just be dropped off at bus stops. Yes, literally out in the cold. https://t.co/MT8TFYPvnf
Migrant women and children detained at the border are crowded into tiny rooms at @CBP facilities nicknamed “las hieleras” (the iceboxes). Shivering inside foil blankets, they are denied mattresses and medicine. The rooms may have contributed to two deaths. https://t.co/rEl1JKdgfm
Don’t engage in the soft bigotry of low expectations. Trump lied to soldiers about pay raises, exposed a covert deployment, encouraged prohibited activities, and provoked Iraqi politicians to call for our military to leave. Suffice to say, that doesn’t make for a successful trip.
Trump also lied to the military in Iraq. Claimed that they hadn’t gotten a raise in 10 years. Their pay has risen every year for decades. Said that the raise he got them was 10%. It was actually 2.6%. Said lawmakers wanted a smaller raise. He made that up. https://t.co/08pyqGFc87
Trump’s Iraq visit was also a diplomatic catastrophe. Perhaps that was intentional. 45 says he wants to keep U.S. military in Iraq, but he met with no Iraqi officials—an unforced, avoidable error. Now politicians there say they want our military ejected. https://t.co/Eye0n96k44
This wasn’t a visit so much as a campaign rally. I also doubt that all of those soldiers packed MAGA hats and Trump flags—or had them sent to Iraq by loved ones—just in case @POTUS showed up. Especially when requesting autographs could get them in trouble. https://t.co/uMZZrVEcQi
Trump shared video of his Iraq visit on his Twitter account. In it, you see him posing with Navy SEAL team members. Their mission was covert, and thus, their faces should have been obscured. No time for ensuring their safety—there is a @POTUS to promote! https://t.co/IK8TQaGEh4
This is a very smart and persuasive argument from @jbouie, outlining why a black candidate may have a strategic advantage over white ones running against Trump in 2020. It reads like one of those columns we’ll remember years from now as an ignored warning. https://t.co/5TXlC8x8xU

This story about the podiatrist falsifying Trump’s bone-spurs diagnosis is an effective reminder that we truly don’t know a goddamned thing about the physical health of the president, who happens to be the oldest one ever elected and has the diet of a garbage disposal.
Shortly after Trump exhausted his educational deferments, he was suddenly diagnosed with bone spurs. That helped him avoid serving in Vietnam. Per @SteveEder, a Queens podiatrist may have granted the false diagnosis as a favor to his landlord: Fred Trump. https://t.co/hpukKqJCBM
It took two young kids dying to push them to do this. And Felipe Gómez Alonzo—the 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who died on Christmas—had been detained in @CBP’s facilities for a week. It’s against policy to hold adult immigrants that long, let along children. https://t.co/pCm87mYxCw

“She, and the thousands of children like her crossing into the US each month, never had the option of a carefree childhood. The journey offered her that chance. It may also be what killed her.” @DLind had a truly sober perspective on Jakelin Caal’s death. https://t.co/GiPPr6ngNq
Jakelin Caal’s body arrived in Guatemala last Sunday. A pediatrician wrote about her death, arguing that it was “not the random outcome of accidental events, but the product of a system that never valued her health to begin with.” https://t.co/PqrXO5vzE0
Yet another child has died in @CBP custody. This one was a boy, 8 years old and like Jakelin Caal, from Guatemala. He was diagnosed with a cold on Monday. Then it was a fever. Then he started vomiting. By the early hours of Christmas Day, the boy was dead. https://t.co/WoOXe13VaH

Mulvaney also said that “The fence doesn't solve the problem.“ To the extent that immigration is a “problem” at all, Trump isn’t trying to solve it. He is about using the racism behind the issue to stay in power. We need to discuss it within that context. https://t.co/EMFiL1BQDy

It is clear that @MikeFrankelSNJ saw Andrew Johnson choosing to have his dreadlocks cut off as a selfless, All-American sacrifice. But to ignore how wrong it was for that choice to be forced—upon a child, no less—isn’t merely white blindness. It is journalistic malpractice.
I’m not suggesting that there are two legitimate ways to view what happened to this young wrestler. He was subjected to a racist standard, and he clearly realized it (even as he went on to win). You shouldn’t see that as him being a “team player” while ignoring his victimization.
This incident is a Rorschach test for racism. A white referee who once called a colleague “nigger” told a black wrestler to cut his dreadlocks off or be forced to forfeit. A white journalist called the young man a “team player.” I saw a kid being violated. https://t.co/P7snXXflug

The United States has helped kill thousands of civilians and starve children in Yemen. Voting to end U.S. support may have been a rebuke to Trump and the Saudis, but more needs to be done. It isn’t enough to just end our involvement in perpetuating horror. https://t.co/FOTH9MpJla
A migrant girl from Guatemala died in @CBP custody last week. She had been detained for about eight hours when she began having seizures. Revived from a cardiac arrest, then died about 24 hours later. Elections have consequences. https://t.co/OTjn7PZsBJ

It alienates readers and destroys trust when press outlets use “we” to imply “everyone” when they mean “white people,” @jdesmondharris argues in an essential piece. As she writes, “If you’ve forgotten that people of color exist, what else have you missed?” https://t.co/DmA3hCYbv3
The point of this is not to get people to “cancel” the entire @nytimes, whether in terms of subscriptions or social value. That is silly. I’m more interested in pushing them to be better. I don’t see how that ever happens without constructive criticism.
(I realize that I make such a request in a thread in which I said “ain’t,” but my point stands.)
You can’t say “we” missed the rise of right-wing extremism when it was the feds ignoring it, or when many of us have covered or experienced it. You can’t say “we” miss WASPs when it’s you. This isn’t about dictating your headlines. I am requesting that you use English correctly.
THE DAILY episode attached to this terrible headline is worth a listen. My @RollingStone colleague @janetreitman speaks on it; she wrote an important story about how federal law enforcement exhibited willful indifference as white nationalism metastasized. https://t.co/CHP8DOMU97
“We” ain’t me. https://t.co/lxOnRAd72w
“Bringing the country together” is not the job of a presidential campaign. Even if a “unity ticket” worked, it isn’t what America needs from a candidate. We need to get better, not feel better. I wrote about all this for @RollingStone. https://t.co/LRpJQHAFnn
This is wrathful. One, this is why you can never give Trump credit for backing off a policy. He’ll do it again when he thinks you aren’t looking. Two, to the extent that he is consciously redefining “criminal” as “nonwhite immigrant,” this is part of that. https://t.co/gTO63RUrzt
We all would be so much better off had Donald Trump had a healthy understanding of what it meant to be a man. @NancyPelosi isn’t just hitting him where it hurts, per se. She is pointing directly at what this is all really about. https://t.co/AU76k8KgGo
McKenzie Nicole Adams was nine years old. She was in the fourth grade. She was being called horrible things like “black bitch” and being cajoled by bullies to kill herself. Then she did. Nine years old, and in the fourth grade. https://t.co/Y10LJM764p
This is political malpractice, @SenateDems. Here is a guy who literally shot a hole in the last climate bill, as @drvox reminded us last month. Manchin alone won’t doom the planet, but he is an impediment to progress on climate change. https://t.co/DiVceM7NMB

@RealTimBlack Perhaps you might take a stab at my questions. Your tweet may not have been intended as criticism, but it surely reads like it.
@RealTimBlack As a journalist, I try not to throw my formal support behind any legislation. My job is to cover it—and to not be easily impressed. I do like the First Step Act’s ostensible goals, but it has been changed to win GOP support. Those changes haven’t been released. So, who knows?
@RealTimBlack Yes, Tim. It is quite evident that the tweet was all that you read. Hence my questions.
The neo-Nazi who mowed folks down in Charlottesville with his car last year may get life plus some, if he is lucky. For murdering Heather Heyer and injuring dozens of others, he still faces federal hate crime charges that could bring the the death penalty. https://t.co/95HPkZJwJy
Jazmine Headley, the young mom who had her baby ripped away from her as the NYPD arrested her last week, has been ordered released from Rikers. The Brooklyn DA dropped all charges. Headley still faces fraud charges from an outstanding case in New Jersey. https://t.co/fWm1RaFfMl
@RealTimBlack That is a strange tweet. How does me taking a few moments to point out to a major media organization how their tweet misinforms people a) a sign of my undue focus on Trump or b) get you thinking that I’m not able to focus on the incarcerated? Do you read my reporting and columns?
Quite the preview of the next two years.  https://t.co/K2Zn8iyR09
This was something to behold. Not merely because Schumer got Trump to own a potential shutdown. @POTUS only governs for his own voters, but he is wagering that they want the wall more than government services upon which many of them rely. Racism as ransom. https://t.co/0ju8aHRhbX
Trump’s claims about the wall are fiction. This cannot be reiterated enough. He is lying about the migrants coming, he is lying about the amount of wall or fencing that has been built, and he is lying about the effect that it would have on immigration. https://t.co/LtM1MVb72w

Criminal justice reform is not a top priority for Trump. He supports one piece of legislation—the First Step Act—and has otherwise been regressive on this issue. Reporting it this way misinforms your audience, @NPR, and erases both the politicians and activists behind this bill. https://t.co/3lUZpwgfx2

Two years ago this month, a guy stormed into the D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong with an AR-15 and a revolver, expecting to liberate children from a pedophile ring. @AndyKroll looks back with two of the people targeted most directly by that reckless slander. https://t.co/Ljev5DroUj
Cyntoia Brown had run away from her adoptive family and was living with her abusive boyfriend—a 24-year-old man who raped her and forced her into prostitution. She is both a survivor of sexual assault and a trafficking victim. https://t.co/4T4PaY795a
This note from @LilianaSegura corrected an earlier tweet that I deleted for fear of spreading incorrect information, but it has a link that is helpful to those seeking to better understand what happened to Cyntoia Brown. https://t.co/RM9wimhYa7
Tennessee has some of the nation’s harshest sentencing laws, dodging the federal prohibition on mandatory LWOP sentences for juveniles. Parole is so distant that it doesn’t matter. @LilianaSegura pointed me to this vital context for Cyntoia Brown’s case. https://t.co/xTxUMeiuqx
America doesn’t believe women who face sexual violence. That problem is both cultural and structural. It feeds our prisons, for one. Cyntoia Brown was 16, and about to be raped. She thought he was going to kill her. Now she got 51 years. It is a travesty. https://t.co/49o3nKBf0M
I don’t want to laugh, since none of it is funny. But Republicans might break with Trump if evidence of conspiracy with Russia surfaced? If? Tucker Carlson criticizes @POTUS for bad governance? He knew that he elected the guy who was going to wing it, no? https://t.co/y3lec66n39
Tim Scott is the only black Republican in the Senate, and he sealed the fate of judicial nominee Thomas Farr by opposing him due to his past discriminatory actions. This letter rebuking @WSJopinion’s Farr editorial was good, but it didn’t go far enough. https://t.co/xM5vEReRdB
Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test fiasco is not the “But her emails!” of the 2020 race. It is not a “minor story treated like a major crisis.” It is worth reporting on, talking about, and learning from. I wrote about it for @RSPolitics. https://t.co/Vfkl1U3RYW

The last part of this is what resonates for me. Trump and Cohen believed that it was necessary to buy the silence of these women.

I sincerely hope that Victorina Morales’s courage is not wasted, since the man to whom she is standing up could have her fired, deported, or worse and likely not suffer a single meaningful political consequence from his party or base. Nor will he face any real legal jeopardy.

Republicans are presently defecating on democracy in Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina. I wrote for @RollingStone about why this is all is not merely the GOP making a power grab, but as part of its overall plan to disenfranchise voters of color. https://t.co/vCwpZKpISt

In another conspicuous grasp for power, the Republican majority in Wisconsin’s Senate pushed through 82 of defeated governor @ScottWalker’s nominees in one day. Eighty-two in one day. At least one was for an office that Walker had left vacant for a year. https://t.co/ONrn0h2La4

Newsrooms covering the 2020 election need to pay heed to these two lessons as much as the Democrats do. Particularly the one about having a diverse set of folks in the room who are empowered to make decisions.
@MorrisMichaelB @AsteadWesley Fair enough. But rather than complaining about my insufficient tweet and citing your Native bonafides, why don’t you add some of this supposedly missing nuance? All I stated in that tweet was my opinion: the test was a bad idea; this isn’t about Trump, but instead Native groups.
@NellSco @jeppsaddison @AsteadWesley @TheDemocrats Come on. It is a real concern for her team, for Native groups, and for Democrats. We shouldn’t discuss that? Dismissing this report like that impugns @AsteadWesley’s integrity as a reporter, and it risks missing some really smart lessons that the Left can learn from this episode.
Two, from @Eric_Lundy: “Race is a true third rail in American politics, and you can make a lot of mistakes when we don’t have a diverse set of folks who are in the room and empowered to make decisions.” This is the time to understand this, 2020 candidates.
One, from @RebeccaKKatz: “Our 2020 candidates need to understand race and identity in a way that tripped up candidates in 2016.” And 2018, I would add.
In addition to @jeppsaddison’s necessary call for Warren to center her reconciliation around Native voices, there were two quotes in @AsteadWesley’s report that stood out. They are two real truths, well stated, that @TheDemocrats should learn verbatim.
@MorrisMichaelB @AsteadWesley My man, you can not be angered all you want. The fact is that a lot of people are. Astead lays it all out here; I recommend that you read and share it to inspire discussion around this issue—rather than using your time here to tell folks that there is nothing to complain about.
Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test was a very bad idea. It wasn’t about whether or not she played into the hands of our bully president. Native American groups and other progressive allies were angered, for good reason. Read @AsteadWesley’s new report. https://t.co/Ax8srAIAe9

Whenever Kareem Hunt inevitably issues a statement saying how sorry that he is for knocking women down and kicking one who was on the ground, my argument about Ray Rice from a few years back will still stand. https://t.co/6xulnQIibP https://t.co/o7HOQZvEcd
The @Chiefs claim that they are learning about the Kareem Hunt video for the first time today, which is ludicrous. Hunt is from the Cleveland area; the story has been in local papers since February. No NFL team goes that long without knowing about this. https://t.co/yj3EW929hl
Kareem Hunt will be a test for the NFL, and I don’t think that they’ll pass it. We have video of him putting his hands (and foot) on a woman. He isn’t Ray Rice, on the downside of his career. He is in his second season. Will he be blackballed, justifiably? https://t.co/xPL5kYxVGr

This is not @SenatorTimScott’s victory. He just did the right thing—what anyone, black or not, should have done. Thomas Farr has no business being a federal judge, and the credit for ending his hopes (for the time being) belongs mainly to effective advocates and good reporters.

Hyde-Smith will likely win because the Republican Party, even more so than in the past, is counting on its constituencies not to give a damn about policy beyond its capability to help them feel better about being white and enhance the unearned privileges that come with whiteness.
The only purpose for questioning whether @espyforsenate “fits in” inside the blackest state in the Union is racism. It is to get white people in Mississippi to vote for Hyde-Smith because she is white, or more acutely, against Espy because he is black. That’s all, folks.

I wrote this about Trumpism, the shorthand we use for Republicans espousing racism to entrench their power. We need to understand something this corrosive as more than a mere political strategy. Read my column for the December print issue of @RollingStone. https://t.co/FfMl7ztn6g
One last thing: @espyforsenate is a moderate. Of course he isn’t going to call @cindyhydesmith a racist on the debate stage. That isn’t necessarily a reflection of a desire to cater to a white electorate. That may be just who Espy is, and how he speaks. Beware convenient framing.
It is vital that the political press understand race a lot better than it does before 2020. This is about the impact of a white rural vote for someone like Donald Trump, not about what is in their hearts when they cast it. We cannot afford any more of this amateur anthropology.
The left won’t win over white voters in rural areas by stepping and fetching, nor by moderating their speech. Comparing Gillum and Abrams to Obama is absurd. And how does a report about the performance of black Democrats in the South never once mention voter suppression?
It is increasingly difficult to sit idly by and watch as predominantly white newsrooms fail to understand the necessity to imbue their coverage with a thorough and comprehensive understanding of race. I can only speak for myself, but I’m tired of it. https://t.co/peZPm9l9Un
The centering of whiteness is not always deliberate, though it is certainly more prevalent in newsrooms that center it with their hiring. We will not always be there to steer you clear of such pitfalls, nor should we be expected to. To that end, read this. https://t.co/HgwQg1MOyI
This is an unfortunate trend that persists in political journalism, this continued centering of whiteness. Republicans and their voters are espousing bigotry more openly than they have in a generation, and yet it is Democrats who are constantly reminded how they need to behave.
Inherent in the report, however, is a misunderstanding of white racism—at least as it is articulated through our politics in this Trumpian era. White voters who won’t vote for black people won’t somehow really not vote for them if they speak truth to power more directly.
The framing here is off from the jump. @jmartNYT quotes Espy’s milder response, but ignores the more incisive retort he gave after Hyde-Smith claimed her lynching reference was twisted: "I don’t know what’s in your heart, but I know what came out of your mouth."

Read this great review of HEAVY, @KieseLaymon’s memoir. “Laymon’s writing, as rich and elegant as mahogany, offers us comfort even as we grapple with his book’s unflinching honesty,” writes @theferocity. Lovely, brutal words from both men on display. https://t.co/mVAoPaTcpI
The best journalist out here covering voting rights offers his analysis of where we stand after the 2018 election. “We’re becoming two Americas again,” writes @AriBerman, “one where casting a ballot is a breeze, and another where it’s a pitched battle.” https://t.co/9Dz3dM8rAo
It is odd to see folks all hemmed up about the @whca not picking a comedian for its dinner, when the dinner itself shouldn’t exist. https://t.co/yaINXvvpqr
Thomas Farr is up for a lifetime appointment as a U.S. district court judge. Same guy who wrote that blocked North Carolina voting law which “target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision.” He even defended Jesse Helms in court. Kakistocracy. https://t.co/3yYeerjGWA
Aisha Fraser taught sixth graders in @shakerschools. She had two girls of her own, 11 and 8. Their father once stopped the car on a main thoroughfare and proceeded to punch Aisha 20 times, breaking her orbital bone. It now appears that he has murdered her. https://t.co/AziuB6d5aT
Aisha Fraser was my high school classmate. I didn’t know her well, so I wasn’t aware that her husband served nine months for brutalizing her. When he got out, Cleveland’s mayor hired him. He was just arrested for stabbing Aisha to death. She was only 44. https://t.co/5sUVb0aw6v

Trump condescends to groups that are either opposed to him or merely useful as political fodder, but he may save his real disdain for his own base. He sees every interaction as a way to either swindle or be swindled. He has to see these folks as suckers. https://t.co/jJr6ldDBa6
One California man whose children lost everything said of Trump, “I voted for him—and now? He can kiss my red ass. What he said was ridiculous. It hurts my heart. A lot of us voted for him and he [talks] down to us?” He has done that the entire time, sir. https://t.co/AWTw7mJ5d1
All due respect, Chuck, but this is nonsense on at least two levels. Gavin Newsom didn’t need Trump as a bogeyman to win in California, and your phrasing implies that “Trump bashing” is somehow a replacement for any platform that Newsom or any other candidate offers. https://t.co/xUErpKx9v9
The fawning tone here is foul, but it tells me that this Rice leak likely came directly from owner Jimmy Haslam—brother of Tennessee governor Bill Haslam, a Republican. Haslam and his wife really need to sell the @Browns before they scare away any decent coach from the job. https://t.co/2UC11EhiiN
@iwannabejessica @Browns She is not qualified at all. I’d say the same of Barack Obama or Colin Powell, for instance. If the @Browns announced that they were interviewing either of those men for the job, I’d level similar criticism, charging that they were more interested in headlines than anything else.
Rice, like me, is a @Browns fan. Has been since her days growing up in Alabama. Our differing politics aside, she could possibly bring something to the organization in another capacity. But there are women now coaching football who could use this interviewing experience.
John Dorsey, the @Browns general manager, did say that he’d consider a woman for the job. Leaking that Rice would be the first such candidate underscores what a joke that was. This is throwing table scraps at feminist goals, using that promise for P.R. value rather than progress.
I have many thoughts about this. A principal concern that I have about this is that the @Browns, whom Condoleezza Rice and I both love, will use her to satisfy the Rooney Rule and will fail to consider any other black candidates for the head coaching job. https://t.co/9jNH9wKkxL
The Finland bit about raking leaves was climate denialism taken to an absurd extent. But this may be even more disturbing. The Camp Fire started on land for which @SecretaryZinke is responsible. 76 are dead. Nearly 1,300 missing. Yet this is his priority. https://t.co/gRnTRy4RvV

“So much of journalism is about the choices we make about who will be seen and heard; the race beat is recognition of the fact that images and voices have seldom told the stories of my community,” @emarvelous writes in @CJR.		“I have aimed to change that.” https://t.co/peZPm9CLiX

Its call to Trump to reverse the Sessions memo will go unheard, but @WesleyLowery reports that the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights “concludes that black Americans, among others, have valid concerns about police violence and lack of officer accountability.” https://t.co/eocy9i71zI
Family separation doesn’t happen without Ronald Vitiello. He fractured more than 2,500 immigrant families as the head of @CBP. Now Trump wants him to run @ICEgov. He’ll likely be confirmed. And as @nlanard writes, hardly enough of us are paying attention. https://t.co/LU3IFVXV6v
Chicago church leaders are calling for the white @MidLothPolice officer who shot and killed Jemel Roberson to be fired. Though the cop was placed on paid administrative leave, his name still has not been revealed to the public. By now, it should have been. https://t.co/0YNmQyKw2N
The @MidLothPolice claim that Jemel Roberson was given multiple warnings before he was shot dead, and that he wasn’t identifiable as a security guard. His family’s attorney says that he was wearing a hat at the time. On the front was the word “SECURITY.” https://t.co/zPQ4tBsuJ6
Jemel Roberson should still be alive. @GWtweets professor Cynthia Lee argues here for state laws that require police to de-escalate in situations like his. We need, at least, laws that provide a disincentive for cops to judge us as inherently dangerous. https://t.co/nKvuXnbZKo
We didn’t talk nearly enough about this. On his last day, Jeff Sessions chose to restrict @TheJusticeDept’s ability to oversee police reforms. @ProPublica, on how that same policy may also hamper DOJ’s role in environmental, voting-rights, and other cases. https://t.co/5mmpzhdRac

This we knew. WaPo columnist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated on orders from the Saudi crown prince, who likely will pay no price for sending a team to butcher a man. The CIA should also lay bare the American president’s apparent complicity in this murder. https://t.co/5R3VHZnbYf

The new @BetsyDeVosED guidance for handling sexual assault on college campuses appears like it will help more men get away with rape. It will also ensure that more accusers are traumatized. Given a chance to help end this crisis, she only made it worse. https://t.co/b7VYBz8e7Z
This @rtraister profile of @RepBarbaraLee is also essential. “Being a black woman in America,” Lee said, “you stand out. You have to just stand your ground with what you believe in. The majority of black women do that in their daily lives all the time.” https://t.co/RMeifPx0X8

I wrote this in July after speaking with @staceyabrams, and, yes, I still believe it: “But even if she loses in November, Abrams’ party would be wise to follow her lead, both by backing more black women and seeking more places to win in the South.” https://t.co/lhMiG6gNQz
Voter suppression won in Georgia, but just barely. @AriBerman adds a postscript to the asterisked Brian Kemp victory over Stacey Abrams and a purpling Georgia. https://t.co/znmkTtaM8C
“Let’s be clear: This is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,” said @staceyabrams, ending her campaign to be Georgia’s governor. “As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.” https://t.co/HlBXMv4jB9
This would constitute @POTUS sending a man out of this country to almost certain death, all to help Saudi Arabia cover up the Khashoggi assassination. Folks like @MalcolmNance saw this coming, and it is now coming to pass. https://t.co/ucucEseQNQ

I do agree with @ezraklein and his interview subjects in one respect: use investigations to convey policy stances. @TheDemocrats rely upon convincing voters why we need competent government. Passing legislation, especially now, is not the only way that they can demonstrate this.
A great many voters chose Democrats so that they would have subpoena power. I get the need to be thorough as they pursue thee investigations. If they put some arbitrary deadline on using it—100 days, as @RonaldKlain suggested—I know that I, as a voter, would be pretty pissed off.
Democrats should pass bills, because that’s their job. But with this Senate and this @POTUS, they would only be signifying to voters where they stand. To get anything actually signed into law, Democrats would likely need to make compromises that would turn off much of their base.
We cannot have a conversation about how Democrats should proceed in their new House majority without understanding why they got there. Yes, they stayed on message, but they also worked consistently to turn out their base, which succeeded in large part because of who is @POTUS.
I don’t agree with the premise of this. A strategy that works in a campaign may not work on the Hill. Yes, @HouseDemocrats should engage Trump on policy, where he is terrible. But folks elected them to administer accountability. They can do both at once. https://t.co/k4Ka7VGkGu

Trump’s approval numbers with black voters are abysmal, by the way. It has been polled recently at 17 percent. He would have us believe that they are around 40 percent. He lies about this not to absolve his racism, but to make it seem as if we enjoy it. https://t.co/AeCAozB1V7

@jonathanvswan No need to be snippy. It was a genuine question, because I was genuinely puzzled why you tweeted that. “Excited to share with you the first snippet from our interview with President Trump yesterday” is not obviously “I’m excited about our show launch,” but Godspeed and good luck.
I really need y’all to watch this again, and understand how disturbing this clip is. Birthright citizenship is in 14th Amendment—which guaranteed the right of citizenship to all African Americans in 1868. Trump wants to bypass that with an executive order. https://t.co/eiug0L13HP
@LiberalPortions @pdacosta Well, because Trump’s argument could be disproven on the spot by someone with even cursory knowledge of the 14th Amendment. And because it is quite odd and utterly myopic to be “excited” to share a story about @POTUS stripping citizenship rights away from people. In any context.
@ron_fournier Your reading comprehension is lacking, Mr. Fournier. That wasn’t my argument, though tough questions are good. Once again, the presser is a time to get answers that help inform that public, not soothe the egos of journalists or perform some outrage that doesn’t solve the problem.
I’ll just say this: I published a little scoop last week concerning Brian Kemp, both Georgia’s top elections official and the Republican nominee for governor. I was certainly glad that I got the story. But I wasn’t “excited” to share that with folks. It was bad news. Objectively.
That Trump could propose such an outlandish thing without any significant pushback from the reporters interviewing him is not a good look for them. The joking at the end was worse, considering what Trump said. That isn’t a clip that I would be “excited” to share, I don’t think.
This isn’t “in dispute.” Trump is proposing something unconstitutional. Such an executive order would violate the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States. But tell that to his sycophantic supporters, who will eat this up before the midterms.
This @axios clip is infuriating for many reasons. First, it shows Trump declaring that he intends to end birthright citizenship by executive order, which we can figure is being done because racism. Then the reporter is sharing a laugh with him by the end. https://t.co/eiug0L13HP
Why does it “excite” you to share an interview in which Trump says he plans to end birthright citizenship? That’s a real question. https://t.co/yvrOoOgTnQ

@samstein @rachelsklar The implication here seems clear: that any violence or unrest—especially any that results from the election, which Trump himself has all but threatened—should be blamed on the Democrats. The primary Republican priority isn’t mitigating the vitriol. It is escaping accountability.
“The United States has seen a recent surge in terror-related violence, with 65 attacks last year, up from six in 2006...[Of those 65], 37 were ‘tied to racist, anti-Muslim, homophobic, anti-Semitic, fascist, anti-government or xenophobic motivations.’” https://t.co/5Ve4FR6EN7

There is new evidence of @BrianKempGA’s efforts to suppress votes in Georgia. @Greg_Palast found that more than 340,000 voters were purged. Kemp claimed that they had all left Georgia or moved to another country. Palast reports that none had moved. https://t.co/lpL0HkMYvV
White supremacy needs anti-Semitism. ”It renders authentic protest illegitimate, and it renders a tiny religious minority a seeking, devious force, whose vile otherness precludes tolerance,” wrote @chick_in_kiev in an essay published three long days ago. https://t.co/Y2EMt1qtRy
There is a vast difference between blaming Trump directly for acts of domestic terrorism, and recognizing the obvious: that his work furthers white supremacy and his politics cater to its adherents, and that far-right radicalization has spiked since he began his political career.
“The moral inadequacy is vast. Murderous acts of hate have occurred, on a national scale, several times this week. It is a tragedy that the President is not able to see them for what they are.” He is not willing, I would argue. Or he can, and doesn’t care. https://t.co/emGAoCRiI3

I’d missed this at the end of September, when Crystal Mason went to prison for five years for the crime of voting. This is one reason why Florida’s Amendment 4 matters, and why Republicans are so afraid of it. Disenfranchising felons should be un-American. https://t.co/2Lev2JIptD
Excellent point. https://t.co/byaXX7jKp6
The “exact match” program that Georgia Secretary of State (and gubernatorial hopeful) @BrianKempGA is using to suspend and purge voter registrations was once prohibited—thanks to the erstwhile Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. @brentinmock, on all this. https://t.co/jv0iXG44zB

Hatice Cengiz, Jamal Khashoggi's fiancée, has uncanny strength. "If he is dead, and I hope that is not the case, thousands of Jamals will be born today, on his birthday," she writes. "Oppression never lasts forever. Tyrants eventually pay for their sins." https://t.co/zoI1hVelAx
I realize that I have shared this argument of mine quite a few times over the last two years. But Trump’s Central Park Five ad and his subsequent refusal to accept their exoneration are perhaps more predictive of his behavior as @POTUS than anything else. https://t.co/eEBrQqok0h

@boxsterman77 @elizabethforma Nowhere in my critique here do I insist that anyone else should share in it. It is not my job as a journalist to endorse @elizabethforma as a Senator or as a potential presidential candidate. It is my mandate to press her for answers to questions that I feel are important to ask.
I would add that after his reckless condemnation of the Central Park Five and so many other instances, we should be familiar enough by now with @realDonaldTrump’s premature and convenient conclusions about who and who isn’t guilty of a crime.
The Trump family has a noted antipathy towards paying taxes, but the fact that Khashoggi was a United States permanent resident and taxpayer should be front and center as this @POTUS, quite eagerly, assists the Saudis in the cover-up of his disappearance. https://t.co/YlkqWa7Kk8
@nabsharris @BostonGlobe If you truly think that this is me nitpicking Warren so as to disqualify another female candidate for president, you are mistaken. Nor do you understand me or my politics.
The Right’s charges that Warren’s Native American heritage was used to advance her career were always rubbish. However, it has never sat right with me that she changed her ethnic ID with her employers, feeling that she could such enjoy such racial flexibility without consequence.
Yes, the end of today’s @BostonGlobe article explains that Warren did offer a reason why she changed her ethnic identification with her employers at the time. What it, and this interview, don’t interrogate is whether she now understands why that was wrong. https://t.co/ZMr4SnjkQx
I applaud @SenWarren’s transparency, but DNA tests for Native ancestry are unreliable. This won’t deter Trump’s racist barbs. And this still doesn’t fully explain why, as she claims, family nostalgia pushed her to identify in workplaces as Native American. https://t.co/ixdpaN3jCO

Kanye West sounded like a men’s rights activist in the Oval Office, notes @dstfelix. Of black MRAs, she writes: “His grievance isn’t that he is losing male privilege; it’s his belief that he was never endowed with it in the first place.” https://t.co/g3UpfWUqJx
Trump’s “rhetoric against journalists probably encouraged the Saudis to do it,” said a political analyst close to Khashoggi, with the Saudis concluding: “Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist.” https://t.co/135YWXILlU

Trump’s denial about the Central Park Five extends to ignoring forensic evidence that exonerates them. His continued condemnation of these men is as racist as anything he said after Charlottesville—and it is a similarly unforced error. This should be as easy as damning neo-Nazis.
Trump should be asked about the Central Park Five every single day. It remains bizarre to me that it was not a central issue of the 2016 campaign. He demanded the execution of five innocent black and Hispanic teenagers, then still refuses to admit that he was wrong.

@NicoleKowalski5 I am not blaming the Democrats should VAWA expire in December. I’m wondering why they have not made it a central issue of the midterms, all things considered.
The president is a known misogynist and at least 20 women have accused him of sexual misconduct. If @TheDemocrats succeed in November, they may able to keep him in check. It is odd that VAWA isn’t a major part of Democratic messaging, outside of sporadic tweets and sound bites.
The Violence Against Women Act did not expire today. It was extended through December 7. That doesn’t make the issue any less urgent, though. I am baffled as to why, in this political climate, Democrats are not making an extraordinary fuss about saving it. https://t.co/jbRhfdBZSz
What Kavanaugh said in his Fox News interview is now actual evidence under “penalty of felony,” @7im points out—noting that “this means that the credibility-straining claims Kavanaugh made on the network could now place him in legal jeopardy.” Fascinating. https://t.co/jhw69yLVLd
We’ve been over this. Yes, it matters. That we are still debating the benefits of a diverse newsroom, or of White House correspondents, is a testament to the convenient stupidity of many who run those newsrooms and select those members of the press corps. https://t.co/23QtLG4v6x

The @senjudiciary should read this. https://t.co/5bm1eLBdYT
Christine Blasey Ford’s family had to move out of their house over this. I don’t want to hear another word about how difficult this has been for Brett Kavanaugh’s family. I feel for his daughters, but come on, now.
Do these Republicans understand how badly they are undermining their case by quoting @JoeBiden from the early nineties?
No matter how many times @ChuckGrassley goes with this line about Feinstein hiding the Ford allegations, the point remains: only the president can order the FBI investigation of those claims. He refuses to do so. Yelling at Democrats doesn’t change that fact.
It actually is worse than Clarence Thomas. I’ll give @OrrinHatch that. The allegations against him were actually investigated by the FBI.
Sexual assault is not immaturity, @OrrinHatch.
Even if Kavanaugh feels as though he has been unjustly accused, there is a way to respond to pressure. In fact, had he merely modeled the decorum that Dr. Ford displayed, he would have been better off.
How does Kavanaugh sit on the Supreme Court after this? Or any court? He may win favor with Trump with this sophomoric performance, but he is undermining any credibility he has to be a judge, or Justice.
The Durbin questioning is arguably the key moment thus far. While Kavanaugh felt he could be combative with other Democrats, he froze (and stewed) when his bluff was called concerning his supposed willingness to be investigated—by the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.
Kavanaugh’s “Have you?” strategy is classic high school. It is separating the supposed cool kid he was then from the Democratic nerds giving him a hard time.
I just spent an afternoon speaking with high schoolers, so perhaps I’m a bit sensitive to this. But Kavanaugh’s defensive “Have you?” retort to @amyklobuchar—when she asked whether he ever blacked out after drinking—sounded like juvenile bullying. Frankly, he sounded like Trump.
The Republicans have offered quite the performance of malignant masculinity, and unearned privilege under threat.
He is a serial liar. https://t.co/axVD3lQktF
I just got done talking to a group of black boys at my high school alma mater about becoming men, and being vulnerable. Then I came out and watched Kavanaugh’s behavior. If he was aiming to perform a Trumpian masculinity, give him the Oscar. That won’t help him, though. Not now.
We should not need survivors to expose their trauma to teach us. The knowledge is out there! Many of us know what rape culture is, and how we all can and do perpetuate it. Those who do not know about it should be more curious. What a sad, violative business this hearing has been.
Do not forget that moment when @ChuckGrassley ignored @SenKamalaHarris’s request for the documents being used in Ford’s questioning. It should be clear now that he did not merely seek to hide behind a female interrogator. They hired her to put Ford on trial. A sham one, at that.
Today is impossible for someone you know, even if you don’t know why.
This should have been investigated by the FBI, and this nomination should have been suspended if not pulled altogether. That is what was true before Ford’s testimony, and even more evident after she has spoken.
The female attorney asking questions on behalf of Republican men on @senjudiciary is working somewhat on an aesthetic level, which angers me. No one elected her to ask these questions. Their contempt for Ford and her truth will be revealed in their votes for Kavanaugh, however.
“Ford has had time to think about what she might say, but she did not sound rehearsed,” wrote Benjamin Wallace-Wells in @NewYorker about Christine Blasey Ford’s opening. “Her manner changed only once, when she began to describe the alleged assault itself.” https://t.co/BfNZdAKhsd

Surely, @McDonalds is not the only fast-food chain rife with sexual harassment. This national strike will be one of many to come. https://t.co/wa5y1jEFWY
This isn’t difficult, @bariweiss. At all. A Supreme Court Justice should be held to a higher standard. If Kavanaugh committed this sexual assault, he is now lying about having done so. Both the assault and the lie are disqualifying for the position he is seeking. Nothing to add. https://t.co/pBD27BnbM9
Trump believes @RepDeSantis owes him. He probably does. Without the president’s endorsement, he likely wouldn’t have won his primary. But loyalty, to Trump, means lying for him. He is mad that DeSantis didn’t support his Hurricane Maria death toll fiction. https://t.co/XiyLypzLfp
Christine Blasey Ford said that an FBI investigation into her allegations that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her should be “the first step” before she is put “on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident.” Which makes sense. https://t.co/cstbWH60pF
Utter cowardice. Republicans on @senjudiciary are all men, so they’re considering having female staffers question Kavanaugh’s accuser, lest they appear sexist. You’re likely supporting a nominee who will likely kill Roe v. Wade, gents, so that die is cast. https://t.co/uxd3FmLfPz
Christine Blasey Ford has moved out of her house. “Ninety percent of people think she’s a hero and are extremely supportive of her,” a person close to her told @nytimes, “and 10 percent want her to die immediately.”		“Her worst fears are coming true.” https://t.co/hzkefD3Nyr

This idea needs to die in a fire. Michael Bloomberg’s legacy of encouraging the racist and ineffective stop-and-frisk policy as New York City mayor should end any discussion of him running as a Democrat. Then, there is what he says here about Charlie Rose. https://t.co/psTwxcoroC
Of all the conspiracies that Democrats could devise to end Brett Kavanaugh’s chances, getting someone to accuse him of sexual assault would be about the last thing that I’d consider. Naturally, that would presume we live in an America free of rape culture. https://t.co/iDPKsmsbYB
There is no reason to disbelieve Christine Blasey Ford. Kavanaugh’s apologists want to try to redefine sexual assault, but the nominee himself isn’t questioning that. He says he didn’t do it. That it never happened. He is calling her a liar. I believe her. https://t.co/QE8H2jeAl6
@IAmSophiaNelson Even if you consider forcing a woman down and molesting her just a part of a boy growing up, the issue isn’t merely that Kavanaugh is alleged to have done this. He denies doing it. So the issue isn’t just whether Kavanaugh is a would-be rapist. It is about whether he is a liar.
@IAmSophiaNelson This is a ridiculous take, @IAmSophiaNelson. First, that wasn’t some common youthful indiscretion that Ford described. It was attempted rape. Sexual assault. If you consider that common behavior for young men, the proper response isn’t shrugging shoulders. More like a fire alarm.
Brock Long should resign after saying this. https://t.co/t9FGIcbo3H
Brett Kavanaugh should withdraw, but I’ll take a delay in his vote. @davidfrum makes good arguments for why that needs to happen, but it’s all very simple: nominate a woman to the Supreme Court, or find a man who isn’t accused of sexual assault. https://t.co/O38Q77xt1x
When @POTUS (an admitted abuser himself) inevitably attacks Ford, I expect him not merely to deny her allegation but cast doubt on the impropriety of the act itself. There are so many incidences of sexual violence that men ignore or dismiss simply because a penis wasn’t involved.
The myth of men as uncontrollable would-be rapists is, of course, insulting to men. But too many guys would rather promote that self-slander than be held accountable, much less learn about consent and what constitutes sexual violence. It is much easier to rely upon our privilege.
Kavanaugh’s apologists want to try the “who among us didn’t try to sexually assault a girl in high school” argument, much like the “every man is a rapist waiting to happen” line. Yes, that is meant as a defense. Les Moonves tried it. It worked for a while. https://t.co/3a4R658zuL
“If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried,” a lawyer close to the White House told @politico, perhaps unaware of how badly he was slandering himself. “We can all be accused of something.” https://t.co/d4Q0xsF7sQ
You can decide whether to believe Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. That’s your choice. But what she describes is sexual assault. It is molestation. Anyone defining it differently should not be taken seriously. https://t.co/Eb4WW1k0SX

I don’t want this survivor to endure what Anita Hill did. But I don’t think that happens if @SenFeinstein tells Democrats on the committee. And waiting until now to refer the allegation to the FBI, even if is in good faith, allows his supporters to claim that it is all politics.
A woman told @SenFeinstein in July that Brett Kavanaugh, during their high school days, attempted to force himself on her. Both he and the alleged witness deny it happened, as we might expect. But Feinstein keeping this from fellow Democrats until now? No. https://t.co/17qt8BJyRw
Rape culture is knowing that getting women whom a man didn’t try to rape to bolster his denial of the allegation will help exonerate him in the eyes of many. This is odious behavior from @ChuckGrassley, of course. Sadly, this may be all the defense Kavanaugh requires. https://t.co/4l1MPhuYpc

Botham Jean was at home at night, in what seems like a nice, safe apartment building. He was alone. He had committed no crime. Where can we be both black and safe from police violence, in particular, if not at home?
I don’t know why Botham Jean’s death is affecting me differently than some of the other unarmed black folks whom police have killed in recent years. It isn’t that Jean was so young, seemingly so kind, or even that he was so promising. I think that it is because he was at home.
This report indicates that Jean’s door was unlocked and his lights were off, so that explains how Guyger gained entry. But how did she fail to notice the red doormat, one that she did not have, before she entered and shot him? There are so many questions. https://t.co/qyKDQf2npe
And if Jean didn’t open the door, how did Guyger gain entry to the unit at all? Is there any security footage that could help us understand what happened? Did Jean and Guyger know one another, even if just as neighbors who may encounter one another in the elevator or in the gym?
The apartment building uses key fobs or codes for the doors. I know from experience that you generally don’t hear anyone trying to enter an apartment with a fob until the door’s unlocked. If Jean came to the door before he was shot, what prompted him to do so, then open the door?
Jean lived on the 2nd floor. Guyger lived on the 1st, which is not on ground level. How does someone with a 1st floor apartment go either up some stairs or in an elevator to a 2nd floor unit, thinking that she lives there? Even if she mistakenly gets off on the wrong level?
Amber Guyger—the @DallasPD officer who shot and killed Botham Jean, 26—has been arrested and charged with manslaughter. The Texas Rangers, not the team, are now in charge of the investigation. Still, there is so much about this case that is not adding up. https://t.co/UexU2oKJEy

This police officer, Kevin Brown, not only tased this child. He blamed her alleged theft for the consequences of systemic racism! The child is already traumatized, having paid too high a price for a mistake that many children make. Now she is responsible for food deserts? https://t.co/4f1rUB3Ntj
It is rather stupefying that Brett Kavanaugh is getting a hearing at all. He was nominated by an unindicted co-conspirator and could be the deciding vote to protect that same person from prosecution. As long as we are, we should know all we can about him. https://t.co/DjvSj6gRzN
The president whose campaign didn’t tell the FBI when Russians offered help now wants @nytimes to “turn over” the anonymous op-ed writer “for National Security purposes.” @AshleyRParker, @PhilipRucker, and @jdawsey1 report on Trump’s sound and fury. https://t.co/PUP4APT5bD
The Trump administration is working daily and consciously to make the lives of marginalized people worse here and throughout the world—and I’m supposed to cheer the people who are stealing papers off of Trump’s desk, but are otherwise complicit? Count me all the way out.
I understand that we’re in an American emergency, and I don’t prioritize governmental norms in the way that many Democrats do. But this is why it’s important to have a @POTUS who isn’t a corrupt charlatan. You have to be like him in order to slow him down. https://t.co/o0IJ8nYdsj
That Anonymous op-ed in @nytopinion didn’t help. The writer clearly thought it was a selfless, patriotic act. But we knew that Trump would behave like this. Anonymous went to work for him. Either invoke the 25th Amendment, or resign. Stop wasting our time. https://t.co/NzRFnSvBl1
Democrats buy shoes, too. Nike signed Kaepernick to make money, @jemelehill argues in @TheUndefeated. Not to make a statement, nor to place pressure upon the NFL. Echoing that classic Nino Brown line, she notes that “It’s always business. Never personal.” https://t.co/NAYpfACfEr
“There was once a firewall that, at least in the eyes of the public, divided black athletes from the concerns of being black in the United States,” writes @jelani9 regarding Nike’s association with Colin Kaepernick. “That separation is no longer possible.” https://t.co/5vUBHSqiLX

Colin Kaepernick is a civil rights activist. He is also Nike pitchman. The NFL was better off when he was just playing quarterback. I wrote about how the league created the troubles they now face with @Kaepernick7, and why a team signing him would help. https://t.co/lcPs1SCuZl

“I don’t know why they don’t take care of a situation like that,” Trump said of the demonstrators at Kavanaugh’s Monday Senate hearing. “I think it’s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don’t even know what side the protesters are on.” https://t.co/CZ7YaEgLZr
I’ll add that it was grotesque of @BretStephensNYT to lament, in print, that @kathrynschulz wasn’t fired for objecting to the @NewYorker interview with Steve Bannon. I, for one, am thankful to have never been a part of any newsroom or production staff where dissent was unwelcome.

The father of a 14-year-old girl who was murdered in a school wanted to greet the man whose tenure on the Supreme Court will likely make this country more susceptible to that kind of violence, and Kavanaugh just turned his back on him. Then, right away, Rod Rosenstein patted it.
I haven’t stopped thinking about this @andyharnik photo since I saw it. How often do you look another person in the eye, then refuse to shake her or his hand in a situation like this?

Please read @AdamSerwer on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, and the precipice upon which we stand. America has been here before. The Supreme Court, during Redemption, enabled Jim Crow’s rise. We are on the verge of a Court that could inflict similar damage. https://t.co/hUO7O6g1LR
What @ChuckGrassley and his fellow Republicans are doing with this Kavanaugh hearing is indefensible, and it is a public disservice. We and the Senators representing us have a right to know all that we can about a man who could, by himself, reshape life for millions of Americans.
Bannon is a racist and an accused domestic abuser, so it is almost funny to hear him speak of someone else being cowardly. He was disinvited not thanks to a “howling online mob,” but because employees complained and actually famous people were backing out. https://t.co/SowKGvXB6m
The president is mad at @TheJusticeDept for indicting two Republican Congressmen before the midterms because it may cost the party those seats. So, ignore crime if it helps the GOP keep the House. I know we’re following a lot today, but this is some shit. https://t.co/5iv7Nw3Ovf
The @NewYorker pulls the Bannon invite. https://t.co/sOwF6J1scG
The essential truth of the @Kaepernick7 protest and his subsequent blackballing is that if one team had given him an honest chance to win a roster spot, we are not having this same conversation. How difficult would that have been, especially for teams with a need at quarterback?
They may take a financial hit from sore conservatives, but I doubt it. Black folks buy Nike, too. Signifying that your corporation is willing to stand behind people fighting for social justice and civil rights helps build trust. Also, it’s how corporations should use their clout.
Is this a corporation seeking to profit off of the pursuit of social justice? Yes. But this accomplishes one thing that could be important. The NFL is now facing pressure from one of its biggest partners to end its collusion against @Kaepernick7. Nike makes the team uniforms. https://t.co/OM08WMa9fr

I realize that the GOP, by and large, has been little more than sycophantic in its approach to Trump. One would think that this could be an especially unique test for them. The president went out of his way to avoid praising their dead friend and colleague, and they all know why.

What happened to Mollie Tibbetts was an unmitigated tragedy. However, the reckless propagandizing of her death minimizes her life. And we have seen enough hate crimes to know that this kind of talk also endangers the lives of undocumented people who had nothing to do with this.
If a young woman like Mollie Tibbetts had been killed by a white boyfriend or family member—as is significantly more common in America—there would have been no @WhiteHouse video lamenting her “permanent separation” from her family. Trump’s exploitation of her death is abhorrent.

I do wonder why @realDonaldTrump so urgently “needs a nigger,” as Baldwin described. I would ask him. I wouldn’t expect a forthright response, nor for him to even understand the question. But so that you may, here is the full Baldwin interview from 1963. https://t.co/gya11Xms43
Baldwin, who had stated earlier that he is not a “nigger” but a man, continued. “If I’m not a nigger and you, the white people, invented him,” he said, “then you’ve got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on ... whether or not it’s able to ask that question.”
Trump’s @KingJames tweet likely evokes for many the notion of “you’ll always be a nigger to them.” It also recalls James Baldwin. “What white people have to do,” he said in 1963, “is to try to find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place.”

@bendwilliams With all due respect, Ben, I disagree. Private negotiations with politicians who endanger journalists shouldn’t be part of a publisher’s job. They weren’t going to get Trump to stop. So treat this as an adversarial relationship, and focus on holding him to account on the page.
@bendwilliams I don’t know what might work better. I truly fear we won’t figure out how to cover this presidency until it ends. But this wasn’t it. Trump seized upon the meeting’s privacy to score points and exacerbated his rhetoric. Rather than ending the behavior, it had the opposite effect.
@bendwilliams I don’t care who wins the exchange, really. I care about Trump’s behavior coming to an end. The statement that Sulzberger released read, to me, as if he took a misguided approach towards achieving that goal. Trump won’t stop. We need to figure out a different path.

Trump’s people tell us that they’ve met the deadline for reuniting “eligible” families. But the parents of about 431 children seem to have been deported without their kids. “Ineligible,” then? Reporting by @itscaitlinhd, @anniecorreal, and @MitchellFerman. https://t.co/TSTa271ehC
The part that makes this even worse is that @kaitlancollins wasn’t just asking questions for @CNN. She was the pool reporter. By banning her from a Rose Garden event, Trump banned a large swath of the American people from a party that they are paying for. https://t.co/yHCrtkQHN4

It seems that there are some men—not all, as we’ve been told—who object to @JessicaValenti’s op-ed today about how feminism can help boys. Perhaps those men will be more receptive when they read a similar argument written by a man. Me, from last September. https://t.co/3iA9gKHlA4
Men are not natural misogynists. It is something we learn how to be. What @JessicaValenti suggests here is essential. https://t.co/TZTUKNzwCC
Trump’s defamation of @staceyabrams this morning only confirms the wisdom of her strategy. Represent all Georgians if elected—but don’t pursue a bloc that would vote for such a man. They cannot be persuaded. They need to be defeated. Me, for @RollingStone. https://t.co/lhMiG6gNQz

Nia Wilson’s murder should infuriate and sadden us, but that can’t be all it does. Yes, this was a random act of violence, but it manifested everyday fears for women, girls, and femmes. We each can and need to do more to make this a safer world for them. https://t.co/N3hxO6YKpl
“You have corrupted discourse for the entire world by going along with these lies" is something that I would like to tell every person who has worked for Trump. @maitlis said it to @seanspicer, and it was the right thing to do. As a journalist, especially. https://t.co/LTeGabFsPT

Just now in a Cabinet meeting, Trump was asked if Russia is still targeting the U.S. Contradicting the intelligence community’s findings and common sense, he said, “No.” That is as insane as anything he said in Helsinki, and evidence he is in dereliction of his duties as @POTUS.

Two key points, for me: Trump didn't try to alter these remarks in his Fox News "interview" last night. And that this is the only thing he wanted to change from all the words that he spoke in Finland on Monday. All that other lunacy that spilled out of his mouth stands, I guess.

The police were once again summoned in the manner one may call an exterminator upon the sight of mice. This brother was sitting in his car, listening to a yoga CD. Where can we go? “You don’t have to call 911 on me,” he said. “Talk to me. Ask me my name.” https://t.co/NtO5RPdLSR

A major U.S. defense contractor quietly detained dozens of immigrant children inside a vacant Phoenix office building—with dark windows, no kitchen, only a few toilets—during three weeks of the Trump administration’s family separation effort, per @reveal. https://t.co/8ZBE6CFkS6

Malevolence and incompetence are bedfellows. The Trump administration will fail to meet any deadline to reunite children they stole with their parents because they never planned to do so. That much was clear before even this startling @itscaitlinhd report. https://t.co/cjBZGNco7l
An immigrant family testified that their 14-month old boy was returned to them after 85 days covered in dirt and lice. Per @NewsHour, they allege that he was never bathed in all that time. Over three months! Forget moral outrage. Child abuse is a crime. https://t.co/r0gg5imI6K
The late Antwon Rose was 17, unarmed, and running away when an East Pittsburgh cop shot him three times. Rose had written a poem two years earlier about this exact thing. But poet @atmcwilliams writes that Rose’s words have power beyond their prescience. https://t.co/6A8OszP0Mh
“I can say a lot of things about this monster,” said Statue of Liberty 🗽 protester Therese Okoumou of @POTUS, “but I will stop at this: his draconian zero-tolerance policy on immigration has to go. In a democracy, we do not put children in cages. Period.” https://t.co/9kLr3pkWd5

I realize that Trump is an admitted sexual abuser himself, and is more likely to side with the accused. He surely finds @Jim_Jordan useful in the effort to derail the Mueller probe. But he can't possibly know what really happened at Ohio State. For God's sake, say "no comment."
Imagine if a Congressman whom this @POTUS liked personally and had relied upon for defense had been accused of enabling the abuses of Larry Nassar. This is that serious.

As a taxpayer, I’m opposed to not only @POTUS being an admitted sexual abuser, but having people like Shine earn a government salary when they have a record of enabling such harassment. As a man, I’m disgusted by Shine, Trump, and everyone who thinks how they treat women is okay.

There are legions of Americans who thirst to see these immigrant parents and children separated, degraded, and dehumanized. Trump understands what he must do with government power, and to our norms, in order to accomplish that. My latest for @RollingStone. https://t.co/rRR2T6L9X4
RT @AdamSerwer: I’ve said this before but the thing that best explains conservative conspiracy theories about the media is how conservative…
I saw the @TIME cover depicting Trump looking down at that crying toddler as a powerful statement on power, and on the racism inherent in family separation policy. I still think that, but @kainazamaria got me to consider the image differently. It can be both poignant and flawed.
Visual journalist @kainazamaria is critical of the new @TIME cover image. “I see it as an insensitive and exploitative play to sell magazines,” she writes, “and one that, albeit unintentionally, offers up this personal tragedy to be memed and ridiculed.” https://t.co/m1c4B6fCQU
“If you want to continue down the road, then yes, ma’am. We need to know what citizen — what country you’re a citizen of,” a @CBP agent said. And if a driver declined to answer? You’re good if “the agent is pretty sure that you’re U.S. citizens.” In Maine. https://t.co/Ubdq4C2os8

Nothing is slavery but slavery, but my God, are there echoes of it in our time. A former acting director of @ICEgov told @priscialva that it is entirely possible that immigrant children and parents separated by Trump’s policy will remain so permanently. https://t.co/WMI6MlBduL
Answering Trump's token request for pardon recommendations, four @NFL veterans outline systemic changes that he could make. "If President Trump thinks he can end these injustices if we deliver him a few names," they offer, "he hasn’t been listening to us." https://t.co/8z1HGTtF9U
The folks at @HHSGov have asked the Pentagon to begin planning to house up to 20,000 unaccompanied immigrant children at military bases. Presumably, this includes children whom Trump's policy separated from their parents, though that isn't confirmed here. https://t.co/jMhyYQGTtq
The whole @FLOTUS border visit today was a stunt, and I can understand why many consider it offensive. They seemed to go out of the way to ensure that she didn’t visit many children who have been separated from their parents. It is barely worth discussing, jacket aside.

If people like Michelle Alexander are simply going to be invalidated in the economy of ideas because of an opinion that proved to be wrong or one that made people uncomfortable, well, shit, we should all just quit. I also have disagreed with her in the past, but come on, folks.
Had no idea that there were so many Michelle Alexander dissenters on the left. Two things: Making her responsible for her U.S. attorney husband’s inaction on the John Crawford III shooting case is asinine and sexist. Canceling her over one critical Hillary column is also foolish.
Racism is designed to take a toll in various ways. Now we can quantify it. America can’t afford to ignore the rising cost of injuring black minds while police disproportionately kill black people. Read this new reporting from @jeligon. https://t.co/qU5kK9Ya4K
"That’s the way the end of democracy sounds, I think," @anamariecox wrote of the jingoistic, monochromatic crowd at Trump's Wednesday night campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota. "People so eager to join a chant they do it before they know all the words." https://t.co/T84qFJKD6p

I would add that Vick’s observation about America’s strong economy, one, is too broad—and two, isn’t exactly the reason that many are crossing the border. They aren’t looking merely for a chance to feast on a boom. Many are just trying to survive. They are refugees.
I do wish that @karl_vick’s story was as explicit as the @TIME cover to which it is linked, connecting family separation to white supremacy. But it is quite striking nonetheless. “Presidents have many jobs,” Vick begins, “and one is telling us who we are.” https://t.co/tX0f2weXUJ https://t.co/e1pUmD1KiJ
Something @DrJasonJohnson said stuck with me when I considered Trump and how he indulges his authoritarian urges. “You cannot accomplish white nationalism,” he said on @amjoyshow, “without, basically, turning the government into a terrorist organization.” https://t.co/rRR2T6L9X4
First, we have seen reporting that some of the parents have already been deported. Secondly, this means family separation didn’t truly end. It will continue for thousands of children. And even if they wanted to reunite these families, could Trump’s government actually do it? https://t.co/lWTBRN9fuX

Homeland Security is breaking the law to deport separated immigrant mothers without being asked by Customs and Border Patrol officials if they were afraid of returning to their home countries, an advocate working with detained women told @woodruffbets. https://t.co/jF9vTmsHMW
President “I Alone Can Do It” showed us what he alone can do, given a chance. He’ll break up immigrant families while denigrating them as vermin, hold kids hostage for a wall, then go all “Am I not merciful?” as he orders them all into a different kind of internment. Duly noted.
Trump’s executive order won’t immediately stop the separation of immigrant parents and children. It seems to be, at the moment, illegal. If a judge signs off, it could be a recipe for indefinite family detention. American concentration camps for a new era. https://t.co/rDC0aFbMGS
A federal lawsuit filed in April claims that Trump’s family separation policy is, per @reveal’s language in this report, “creating a zombie army of children forcibly injected with medications that make them dizzy, listless, obese, and even incapacitated.” https://t.co/XIYUq5dmwz
Taxpayers have paid more than $1.5 billion in the past four years to private companies operating immigrant youth shelters accused of serious lapses in care, per @reveal, including neglect,  sexual and physical abuse, and the forcible drugging of children. https://t.co/s0CykQz8Uh
To merely end family separation, at this late stage, would be grossly insufficient. The die has been cast. How would immigrant families be reunited, especially those with parents deported without their children? Or, as I suspect, is there no plan at all? https://t.co/9cl19I9iUe
This @AdamSerwer essay is required reading. “People who would do this to children would do anything to anyone,” he aptly observes about Trump’s family separation policy, citing American precedent. “Before this is over, they will be called to do worse.” https://t.co/xSNtjp00Lf
If Trump “signs something” to end family separation, do not congratulate. This is a crisis of his own making, and one that he could stop with a phone call. For no other reason than politics, this @POTUS has broken families apart and put children in cages. https://t.co/rRR2T6L9X4

I am genuinely concerned that the @GOP won't have to do much to distance itself from Trump's family separation policy. Perhaps send a tweet. Visit a child prison camp. Appear mildly perturbed in a television interview. Or put out a bill ending it, but making the whole mess worse.

As she lies from the podium today, @SecNielsen’s use of the word “law” is telling. Same with Trump and anyone else either now defending family separation. Claiming that this is the “law” makes the brutality involuntary, and turns even crying children into “illegals” and “aliens.”

Good sentiment, bad wording. Trump disinviting the @Eagles is not unpatriotic by itself. And this isn't just about free speech. It is about racial justice.

I wish that could trust my country as much as you do, @davidfrum. Decency will help, and it is a must in our next time president. But Samantha Bee’s sin was not giving Trump fuel, but distracting the press from the topic she addressed: family separation. https://t.co/uz5SmPhYbV

I never watched ROSEANNE—the new one or the old one. I rely on people who know what they’re talking about, and when we’re talking about media literacy and criticism, @jennpozner is atop that list. https://t.co/NjBAN7fAEy
All these folks tweeting at me to “take the win” on Roseanne’s firing, like we’re talking about sports, or like this is over.
There will inevitably be people who make unintelligent arguments defending Roseanne, many of which will use @Kaepernick7 as a shield. For example, “If you’re offended by her speech, why can’t we be offended by his?” Few, if any, will explain the real reason why he bothers them.
What was ABC thinking when it hired her?
I am thankful that @ABCNetwork cancelled Roseanne Barr’s show, but I need to know a lot more before I start anointing heroes. It’s clear that at least one actor and one writer were quitting the show. Would she have been on set alone? Did @iamwandasykes and others force its hand?
"Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show," ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement. This isn't censorship. It is termination for cause. https://t.co/1fvFKh165L

At least 4,645 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria and its aftermath, per a new @Harvard study. That's more than twice the Katrina death toll. Yet the official government count still stands at 64. It's as if those folks never existed. https://t.co/MX8ra422EG

Aaron Schlossberg’s threat to call @ICEgov is the most abhorrent part of this. He is no different than the white folks calling cops to re-segregate space. Well, aside from his behaving as though he has an untreated mental healh condition, which racism is. https://t.co/c9vqrjVZGw
Yes, @EPAScottPruitt needs to go. But his innumerable scandals distract a bit from his most fireable offense: he is charged with protecting the environment, yet he is busy vandalizing it. I wrote for @RollingStone about Pruitt’s utter dereliction of duty. https://t.co/F1GXTPIkG0
The good brother @ClintSmithIII, rightfully, takes Trump’s labeling of undocumented immigrants as “animals” as seriously as a heart attack.

This was a welcome surprise. Whether #NetNeutrality dies in the Senate or thanks to a Trump veto, the push to maintain this civil right—you heard me—has forced elected officials to put their names behind protecting it or violating it. That is a good thing. https://t.co/R9xKGImGOs
Seeing the police repeatedly summoned to re-segregate spaces have me feeling like we’re trapped in the worst “Aristocrats!” joke ever. Black folks can be doing literally anything, but the story always ends with: “Then a white person called the cops on us!” https://t.co/PyAjr0AbGi

Donald Sherman’s son Caleb was sick, so he took the day off from work to stay home with him. Later that day, his dad took him out for some air in Washington. For this, a white woman alerted security. This has always happened. Now, it’s just in the news. https://t.co/mf3aYj1AWc

Alexander, a @UVA professor, had a front row seat to White Supremacy Live! In Charlottesville last summer. But as many have noted, he has been writing this same ridiculous take for years now. It is to @nytopinion’s discredit that they allowed him to regurgitate it on their pages.
That is stupid, natch. One true cowardice of modern conservatism is that it goes to extremes to escape the truth of its own beliefs. It wants the benefits of the racism and misogyny baked into America, all without truly owning it. They’d rather blame a liberal being mean to them.
Gerard Alexander’s argument in @nytopinion is as inane as the one @bariweiss made. They’d have us believe that the bigots who enabled Trump’s rise were somehow provoked by liberal sanctimony and terms used to describe them, and therefore should be exempt from social consequences.

@JillFilipovic @NYTmag The jarring and unnecessary juxtaposition of @NYTmag’s presentation of this newer drug crisis with the headlines and images we all remember from the ostensibly black crack epidemic—as some have noted—could’ve been avoided, directing even more eyes to a smart piece of journalism.
@JillFilipovic @NYTmag The image of a cherubic white infant, in particular, evokes emotions concerning the demonization and discarding of black “crack babies,” a pseudoscientific stereotype that persists today. As much energy needs to be devoted to debunking that as to telling the truth about opioids.
@JillFilipovic Or a cover with people of various races. Opioid addiction crosses racial lines. As such, @NYTmag appears to the casual reader to embrace the white framing of the opioid crisis, and the suddenly sympathetic approach to drug use that has accompanied it. https://t.co/iic1knuqDW

One of the dangers of a black man with @kanyewest’s platform saying that slavery was a choice is that it implies that is also true of any form of racial violence that is less than slavery. Which, of course, is everything. He isn’t insane. That’s white conservatism, in a nutshell.

This @WhiteHouse gaslights the public and endangers the press. Its platform is a to-do list for those wanting to exacerbate inequality. Its @POTUS mocks and slanders with abandon. Its Cabinet is a rogues’ gallery. Let’s be as alarmed about that as some are about @michelleisawolf.

If other companies are smart, they find out what this Starbucks anti-discrimination curriculum is and look into pre-emptively implementing it. Don’t wait for an incident to occur. Also, the problem can’t be solved in an afternoon training. Use it as a step, not a salve.
Okay, now I’m very encouraged about the Starbucks trainings. @Sifill_LDF, @JGreenblattADL, @hmcghee, @EricHolder, and @eji_org’s Bryan Stevenson will “develop the training curriculum and monitor the effectiveness of the company’s policy and training measures.” https://t.co/P1bimrihU3
Saying that it’s a positive step for a company to realize its culture needs to change—and that the Philadelphia incident may be a sign of something more systemic—is not a signal to stop pressuring them to make that change.
I say that the @Starbucks anti-bid training is a positive step because I didn’t expect them to take any steps. The trainings, effective or not, are somewhat beside the point. Starbucks knows this can’t happen again, and its employees should, too, if they hope to keep their jobs.

Read @jbouie’s epitaph for @SpeakerRyan. https://t.co/sHDXG5r7W2
Those killed by racial violence, whether lynching or police brutality, are too quickly forgotten. I wish that this wasn’t a problem. In @RollingStone, I offer an idea for radical remembrance. Is it far-fetched? Sure. But that isn’t an argument against it. https://t.co/uJKsfcQxio

"Right now, one of the Republicans running in Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District is an actual neo-Nazi,” reads an email sent from @IronStache Wednesday morning about Paul Nehlen. “I’d like to say he’s unelectable, but look who is in the White House.” https://t.co/JD6GqKyE6h
Scott Pruitt is a low-rent Donald Trump, literally. No wonder @POTUS defends him. https://t.co/Ofo4KyyMyd
Missouri governor @EricGreitens was a rising Republican star. He is one of the nation’s youngest governors, and is a former Navy SEAL and a Rhodes Scholar. He is now an accused sexual abuser. So, for all we know, he may still be a rising Republican star. https://t.co/KjwNeOBiK2
Informative and well done. https://t.co/baU1ItojFV
I cannot recommend this @reveal reporting more highly. It found that African American and Latino applicants continue to be routinely denied conventional mortgage loans at rates far higher than their white counterparts, 50 years after the Fair Housing Act. https://t.co/LAzW5cTlRK
The Fair Housing Act turns 50 today.	Read this @GeeDee215 thread.	And the writing to which he links. https://t.co/p4RikuOrqK
“Had its goal of promoting integration been implemented,” law professor Michelle Adams writes on its 50th anniversary, “the Fair Housing Act would have had the potential to be an extraordinary anti-segregation weapon.” Alas. https://t.co/zFGXzgB8nx
Read the replies to this. He’s right, by the way. https://t.co/afk8SFZxWT
Massive. It is curious that @PRyan plans to retire from Congress with much of his wish list for societal upheaval left undone—and now, I hope, it is unlikely that he’ll be able to do more damage before he leaves. In that respect only, I am thankful to him. https://t.co/ZPX6pkehy9

“No comment” would have been better. My quick thoughts on Trump’s Cohen raid meltdown, in @RollingStone. https://t.co/xf65oNmVpq
“For the gilded class orbiting Trump Tower, impunity,” @AdamSerwer writes of Trump’s approach to due process. “For communities of color and others targeted by his rhetoric, and the public figures who draw his wrath, only the harshest sanctions will do.” https://t.co/9jD0c13MLc
Trump wants to fire Mueller.	Can we all accept this as a basic truth?	And finally, just stop asking him?	Instead, ask for his justification.	A (slightly) better use of time, no?	https://t.co/JYpbdFFyVn
Insert the typical adjectives describing Trump’s presidency here—reckless, authoritarian, dangerous. But for him, it also feels late. And wouldn’t firing Rosenstein be the literal obstruction of justice? Trump would only help Mueller’s case against him. https://t.co/8usTXEdrzY
There are at least two myths at work here. One, that he is empowering the people whom he is belittling. Two, that moving into the workforce means you escape poverty. Yet, the @POTUS who barely works sees fit to imply that poor folks are lazy and shiftless. https://t.co/TxU3bP7TZd
The vultures are still circling. @AlanaSemuels reports on a new lawsuit alleging that African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings. https://t.co/OeFFqm7mdY
Colorado governor @hickforco stopped by @RollingStone and talked to @tessastuart about the future of marijuana under Jeff Sessions, the importance of local journalism, and more. https://t.co/vkblxnIq4c
"I saw that Trump lawyer upstairs before," @JohnSurico heard a man say at the Loews Regency Hotel, where the FBI raided Michael Cohen's room. "He was complaining that they took his iPad and briefcase!" https://t.co/ExpFhWxA2X
With much of the world bracing for Trump’s new missile strikes on Syria, his legal authority to attack Bashar Assad is conspicuously AWOL, @attackerman reminds us. Though he might want to be, he is no king. https://t.co/uRKMWs7zZ0
The President can request the firing of the special counsel. The Attorney General or the person acting in his place—presently Rod Rosenstein—can refuse that request. Presumably, Rosenstein would either be fired or resign in protest, as would others put in his place who refused.
He doesn't. This isn't debatable. https://t.co/kj2CgYgVUN
Every day needs to be #EqualPayDay.
I wrote for @RollingStone about Stephon Clark, @eji_org’s new lynching memorial in Alabama, and how we remember those who suffer from all forms of racial terrorism in America. https://t.co/uJKsfcQxio
As much as Michael Cohen seems to consider himself a friend of Trump’s, Monday made it very clear that he is just an employee. My thoughts on how @POTUS responded after learning that his personal lawyer was being raided by the FBI, up now in @RollingStone. https://t.co/xf65oNmVpq
