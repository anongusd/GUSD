What NOT to include: any efforts at enforcement beyond at the border, provisions aimed at deterring or reducing asylum applications, reductions or changes to legal immigration programs, or efforts to expand the population of those protected from removal as part of this deal. (7/)
5. More support personnel would allow front-line agents and officers to do more of their duties. Incentivize service in remote locations &amp; ensure the ability to more easily transfer personnel to address changing patterns of migration, drugs, or other threats at our borders. (6/)
4. Sector-specific technology, roads, port of entry security measures, forward operating bases, communications, and other infrastructure are as important as physical barriers. (5/)
3. Border security should be defined broadly, and not just focused on physical barriers or a wall. (4/)
2. Protections should at least include TPS beneficiaries who have had status the longest and have been terminated: those from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. These people have been here a decade on average, are working legally, and have built lives here. (3/)
1. Deal ONLY with DREAMers &amp; TPS holders for now. Green card status for the largest group of DREAMers: those who have DACA and those who would have been eligible. They should be able to apply for citizenship on the same basis as other green card holders. (2/)
No more shutdowns. No emergency. It‚Äôs #timeforadeal on immigration and border security. We can shore up border security and protect DREAMers if both sides work in good faith. Here‚Äôs what a bipartisan deal looks like: (1/)

A5: The Sen. FB doesn‚Äôt change the structure of SNAP-Ed, but adds a section mandating that state agencies use an electronic reporting system to measure/evaluate projects, &amp; to submit annual evaluation reports. This aligns w/task force recs: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri
A4: Our task force recommends a more robust infrastructure to support implementation/evaluation of SNAP-Ed. States lack support from HQ &amp; regional offices needed to construct/implement effective plans. Details on task force SNAP-Ed recs: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri
@MomsRising @DanRGlickman @bfrist @MarianaChilton Our task force suggests strengthening SNAP retailer standards to improve the food environment for shoppers ‚Äì nutrition ed isn‚Äôt enough by itself. For more details https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri @DanRGlickman @bfrist @MarianaChilton @AngelaRachidi @KBDeSalvo @kowalker1
@MomsRising @DanRGlickman @bfrist @MarianaChilton it would be beneficial to expand the USDA‚Äôs ability to conduct a range of evidence-based pilots to improve SNAP participants‚Äô diets, and to collect &amp; share store-level data on all products purchased with SNAP funds. For more rec‚Äôs: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri
@MomsRising Our task force recommends eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages from the list of items that can be purchased w/ SNAP, &amp; supporting healthy purchases by continuing/strengthening incentives for purchasing fruits &amp; veggies (#FINI) #FoodFri @DanRGlickman @bfrist @MarianaChilton
@MomsRising A4: SNAP is a nutrition assistance program, so our task force proposed improving diet quality should be a core objective. For more on improving diet quality: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri
A3: #SNAP participants are 20-50% less likely to report food insecurity than income-eligible nonparticipants ‚Äì leading to fewer hungry Americans. For more on SNAP‚Äôs anti-hunger impacts: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk #FoodFri
A3: SNAP is based on the Thrifty Food Plan &amp; historically aimed to increase calories, but now the problem is not being able to afford, access &amp; prepare healthy foods ‚Äì this means participants face an excess of calories with a lack of quality nutrients #FoodFri
@MomsRising Our #SNAP Task Force had many recs for improving SNAP diets inc. incentivizing fruits &amp; vegetables, &amp; restricting soda. For details, see: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk from our Task Force @DanRGlickman @bfrist @MarianaChilton @AngelaRachidi @KBDeSalvo @kowalker1 #FoodFri
@MomsRising Some conclude that the most effective strategy (to improve nutrition and reduce health care cost) is to combine incentives for healthy foods w/disincentives for unhealthy foods. #FoodFri
@MomsRising A study published last week provides supports that #SNAP benefits aren‚Äôt enough to buy healthy foods throughout the month. This is called the ‚ÄúSNAP-cycle‚Äù, where food purchases &amp; nutrition drop off as the month continues. https://t.co/FqAD1M5iLM #FoodFri
@MomsRising A 2012 study found that participants had lower dietary-quality compared with nonparticipants ‚Äì inc. fewer whole grains &amp; more red meat; a 2016 USDA report found that soft drinks are the #1 purchase for SNAP households, compared to #2 for non-SNAP households #FoodFri
@MomsRising Despite the SNAP‚Äôs success in reducing hunger, studies show it‚Äôs been less successful in promoting nutrition. Pilots that give subsidies to purchase healthy foods have shown an increase in fruit/veggies, but no effect on eating unhealthy foods #FoodFri
@MomsRising A3: Child participation in SNAP is linked to better health in adulthood ‚Äì inc. reduced chance of obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes #FoodFri
#SNAP reduces food insecurity &amp; poverty among low-income Americans, but could do more to improve nutrition among recipients. For more background, check out our SNAP Task Force report authored by @DanRGlickman @bfrist: https://t.co/XWVxy5Zdfk  #FoodFri
A2: #SNAP has its roots in the Great Depression &amp; was renamed from Food Stamps in the 2008 Farm Bill. It‚Äôs run by the USDA and reauthorized by Congress in the #FarmBill. Its annual cost is ~$70 billion #FoodFri
A1: The FB is an omnibus legislation usually passed every 5 years. The last FB (2014) authorized $489 billion for a variety of ag, food, &amp; nutrition programs. The House passed their bill last week, and the Senate passed theirs last night. #FoodFri
