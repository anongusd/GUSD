A5: Big opp for macroalgae to help meet growing demand for protein and carbohydrate needs. Great industry, highly supported by ABO #biochat
RT @cleantechczar: #biochat A4  Underpromise, overdeliver.  it is so easy to get excited about its potential.
RT @Biochat: Q4: How does Algae manage expectations that have hurt other renewables while still keeping the public supportive? #biochat
RT @benlubbon: #biochat A3 There isn't an algae app that I don't like. All are multiple win-win scenarios.

RT @BIOblogger: A3: I am amazed at the range of applications for algae. Much different than other #biostock. Many sizes to scale. #biochat
Absolutely - many different sources for nutrients. RT @cleantechczar: #biochat A2 nutrients can also be in CAFO operations and other areas.
RT @Biochat: Q3: Does an Algae farm/refinery need to be large scale (like an oil refinery) or can it be localized and distributed? #biochat
RT @Biochat: Q2: How much of an infrastructure build-out are we looking at to make Algae commercially viable? #biochat
A1: Drivers are usual biofuel drivers, with huge growing markets for food, feed, hi qual nutraceuticals, ability to monetize carbon #biochat
RT @riggseck: #biochat A1 production driverr is for hi quality products .  But  big fossil polluters will fund infrastructure buildout
