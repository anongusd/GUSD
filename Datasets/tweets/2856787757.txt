It‚Äôs vital the U.S. continue to negotiate from a position of strength and not to make concessions when the NK regime isn‚Äôt being reasonable.
I‚Äôm encouraged @POTUS has engaged in diplomacy with our adversaries in North Korea to end their nuclear program. I‚Äôm particularly pleased he held firm in demanding concrete steps for the regime to denuclearize.

It‚Äôs time for the #Senate to put a halt to these delay tactics and get back to fulfilling our commitments to the American people.
We can‚Äôt allow the #Senate to be bogged down by unprecedented obstruction tactics. The American people expect, and deserve, a fully-functioning government with the right personnel in place.
The recent levels of obstruction for nominees have not only kept the Executive Branch and our federal courts from staffing critical positions, but have also prevented the Senate from moving forward on other critical legislative priorities and initiatives.
As any #Iowa small business owner can tell you, if you don‚Äôt have employees, you can‚Äôt function.
This issue plagued the 115th Congress, and it is one that I hope we can move past to put our country before politics in this new session.

Fortunately, partnering with state and local officials, we‚Äôve found a solution to allow this land to be used for purposes that make sense for today‚Äôs Council Bluffs community.
The Western Historic Trails Center (WHTC) was created with the best intentions in mind. However, years later it became clear to the state and the city of Council Bluffs that the WHTC was no longer the best use for the land.

At the end of the day, this legislation is a key starting point that will allow the president to move forward on desperately needed border security efforts. https://t.co/cHWvxS0KDZ
While it sets up the critical framework for a border wall, I‚Äôm concerned there are provisions tucked into this compromise bill that will actually establish roadblocks for wall construction in areas where it is needed.
It also contains a provision that could hamstring federal law enforcement efforts and open the door for illegal criminals to evade deportation using vulnerable children.
...and the flow of drugs into #Iowa and the rest of the country. However, I‚Äôm frustrated this bill fails to extend the Violence Against Women Act, legislation I have long called on to be modernized and reauthorized.
We successfully fought back against radical &amp; unreasonable positions from our Democratic colleagues‚Äîlike abolishing ICE &amp; borders all together‚Äîin order to reach a deal that provides critical funds for border security &amp; gives the president the tools to curb illegal immigration...
Negotiating in good faith and working towards a compromise means both sides get things they want and things they don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a lot of good in this compromise legislation, but there are also parts that fall short.

This is just another reminder of why we need to codify my bill, Sarah‚Äôs Law, which requires fed law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants who've killed or seriously injured another person. https://t.co/fU1FwnR4GN
Good to see my Democratic colleagues walked back their border security proposal to put a cap on ICE detainees which would've allowed dangerous, criminal illegal aliens to go free.

Simply put, when Washington gives power back to Main Street, American families win.
Furthermore, cutting red tape and scaling back burdensome regulations has led to a surge in small business optimism.
For example, a business in Dyersville, Iowa invested 75% of their tax savings last year into their employees, giving $800 bonuses to their 162 full time workers. One of their employees said she planned to put her bonus into her retirement fund, an investment in her future.
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct has allowed Iowa‚Äôs job creators to invest in their workers and grow their businesses.
Nowhere is the power of this job creation more evident than #Iowa, where the 2.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in the nation. There are 64,000 plus jobs open in Iowa right now! Over 1.6 million Iowans are employed ‚Äì the most in our state‚Äôs history.
The tight labor market has drawn workers off of the sidelines. Folks that have been unemployed or underemployed are finding work.
Just as important, this economic growth has put upward pressure on wages, with the average hourly pay increasing by 3.2 percent from last year. Lower-wage workers saw some of the biggest increases.
Last Friday‚Äôs January jobs report is a continued good news story, with 304,000 new jobs added last month.  It is also an example of how Republican pro-growth policies are getting people back to work.
I rise today to speak on the strength of the U.S. economy. As President Trump said in last night‚Äôs #SOTU, ‚Äúour economy is thriving like never before.‚Äù

I've seen firsthand Air Force Sec Heather Wilson's leadership for our men and women in uniform - she would make a great Secretary of Defense and make our country proud.
