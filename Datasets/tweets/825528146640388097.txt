You kinda have to try to touch the ball to bunt. You can't just pull it back every time. Ugghh.

I can't see how they can find evidence to overturn it.

Kinsler has had the bases loaded, one out twice. Hopefully this time is different.
I HATE THE ASTROS. THEY DONT EARN ANYTHING THEY GET. CHEAP HITS AND BAD CALLS AND STUPID PLAYS ALWAYS GO THEIR WAY. BEAT THEM @RedSox
You have to go quickly on that one. That is not a base hit
Kinsler is not clutch at all
I hope the Astros hit 10 more home runs this inning. Might wake them up and make them want to try. Goodnight to everyone except Eduardo Nunez, Brandon Workman, and every umpire to ever exist.
I know what this team is capable of. I have watched them all year, just like all of you. We all know this is not what they are made of. They did not bring it today. Changes need to be made. This is a championship team. Prove me right, @RedSox.
@RealSwaggyT I guess you're right. But Sale gives his team a better chance to win because he keeps them in it even when he is shaky. Price will create a big hole early. Hopefully not, but can't expect him to be good.
@RealSwaggyT But will give up bombs left and right. Way worse than walking people.
AN EASY WIN THROWN OUT THE DOOR. EASY WIN. NOW DAVID PRICE WILL PUT US DOWN 0-2. JUST GREAT.

An umpire is bad when he misses calls for both teams, but he is just needs to get a new job when he just does it for one team.
Should be 2-0, but Nunez.
HAVE TO score more there. Big squander.
Verlander acting like Sale. What an AB for Mitch! Down 0-2, takes some tough pitches.
The Astros are the luckiest team in baseball. Yes, even more so than the Yankees. And Alex Bregman is the luckiest hitter. Did you see some of the walk-offs he hit?
Welcome back, Chris Sale.
See, just because it is hit hard doesn't mean you can't make the play. Pathetic game all around so far.

He lets them make stupid plays (Holder last night) and says they did nothing wrong. How is that gonna make them learn? And tonight, he says Severino didn't try to throw at Mookie. Hold you players accountable.
Boone is an awful manager. First of all, he has no idea what a bullpen is and how to use one. He doesn't know any situational hitting or strategies late in games. And worst of all, he refuses to make his own players accountable for their bad play or actions.

@Krazyfool4 @BostonStrong_34 See, changed to a hit

Too much blown opportunities. The Astros bullpen sucks. They are probably not going to score once this series against them though.
This was a winnable game. We had multiple chances to take the lead. Now we have to trust the bottom of the order to win it. Awful. Rafael sucks this year too.

STOP GETTING NO-HIT BY AWFUL PITCHERS
@Rich_Sady They forgot how today. They need to remember how
Why can we not get a hit? He has a career 4.61 ERA
This is not my team. Figure yourselves out @RedSox
This is ugly. Learn how to play baseball please. I can call some 2-year-olds to show you how it's done if you would like. @RedSox
Every time the Red Sox are about to sweep someone, they just refuse to play baseball. Today is an ugly all-around baseball game, and so was the game 3 against the Rays.
What the heck was that? You guys wanna play baseball or not @RedSox
Come on Sandy
We are going to get no-hit again with Sale pitching aren't we
The first one that was a ball was an inch closer than the strike he owed that to Sale
Sale has made one bad pitch. Everything else, he has made hitters look like little leaguers
The Red Sox refuse to try to hit when Sale is pitching. I don't know why.
Umps can't call that a strike on JBJ it's in the dirt
Idiots just get runs
#Steroids https://t.co/9zHoPXuxgj
