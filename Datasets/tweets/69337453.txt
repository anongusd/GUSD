RT @genevanetwork: SPC stockpiling provision would further damage European innovation #SPCwaiver https://t.co/QUYkq6w4sL
The waivers will allow generic manufacturers to "produce generic and biosimilar medicines during the SPC period for export purposes and to stockpile for two years in order to prepare for launch in the EU the moment SPC expires." Read more here: https://t.co/FMhGKmyNkI
Last week, the Legal Committee of European Parliament voted in favor of introducing supplementary protection certificate (SPC) waivers. Under current legislation, generics cannot manufacture during the SPC period.
