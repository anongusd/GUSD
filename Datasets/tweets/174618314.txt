@raedtsuleiman @mehdirhasan @theintercept @PeteHegseth The United States was founded on principles of religious freedom.

@Political_QRM The .@NFL care about ONE THING: $. They don't even really care if you watch. Someone else will, and someone else will buy his jersey. They stopped showing national anthems so you wouldn't see the kneelers. They don't care about it &amp; neither do the players (for the most part). 🇺🇸
I get that Andrew Jackson is attacked for being a Native American bad guy, and that some folks talked about Harriet Tubman replacing him on the $20 bill. Do you think that Libs know she earned an Army pension for leading ARMED raids to free slaves? This is my favorite pick. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/mYzoT5YTwd
