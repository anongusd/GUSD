@scottmguthrie @AaronBlake Excel if you don’t separate first and last names into separate columns.
@Reuters From what I can tell, the British Royal Family - and especially it’s younger members - regularly and consistently focus on helping others directly and through charitable work.  Kate, Meghan, Will, and Harry are especially impressive.  Trollers should Lay off them.

@DispatchAlerts You may need to get @Jim_Jordan a suit jacket for the hearings to come.
@ABC This self inflicted blindness is destroying America. Focus on the facts and pull your head out of the President's backside.  If you really cannot see the problems, you at least need to admit that you do not care about corruption and the treasonous actions of this administration.

@costareports Disgracing the flag, the presidency, and the country. Is insanity a defense to impeachment?
@amyklobuchar At CPAC today, @realDonaldTrump disclosed @FLOTUS as a witness to Trump's intent with firing Jim @Comey, claiming he talked with her about his plan to fire him.  Never mind that it is at least the third version of his claimed story. But @FLOTUS can claim immunity, lie, or flip.
@DavidAFrench practiced abstinence with the American people by not conspiring with foreign enemies.
@jheil @SHO_TheCircus @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 @JackieSpeier @mattgaetz @RepCummings @MarkMeadows @AdamSchiff @JimJordan @CPAC @emilyjanefox Curious as to others' thoughts about Trump disclosing at CPAC that @FLOTUS is now a witness to Trump's intent when firing Comey.  Would she claim spousal immunity, lie, or drop him like a bad habit?  Maybe tonight would  be a good time to renegotiate the pre-nuptial agreement.
@satanisfemale @sloviansk8900 @realDonaldTrFan Parody accounts are more believable.
@Yamiche How many times did he say, “reciprocal,” “beautiful,” “really, really great,” “greatest in history,” or “your favorite president - me?”  That would have taken up about half the time.

@peterbakernyt @MarkLeibovich Therein lies the problem.  Focusing on Trump’s success instead of the country’s success is a huge problem with this President because those interests are not aligned. Graham has become complicit in hurting our democracy.
@SenatorBurr You are correct, Senator. Of course it would help if POTUS made human rights an issue in his discussions with his buddy Kim.
@EJDionne @justinamash Policy differences come and go with a pendulum that swings back and forth.  That is not only survivable, it is the essence of America.   But corruption and authoritarianism is different, and should be opposed by all. The R’s have lost their way on this.

@ananavarro Wonderful and kind tribute.  Peace and best wishes.
@davidfrum Wish the media would raise hell and demand to see the notice of audit(s) to which Trump claims his tax returns are subject.  He is welcome to Redact personally identifiable and private information.  Usual wager that they do not and have never existed.
@h8Wankmaggot45 could you visit my work place and pretend its Thursday?  I'll have a list waiting.
@MeghanMcCain Great respect for you &amp; loved your father. I respect your pro-life position. But this issue of "post birth" infanticide just lacks a truthful foundation. Killing a child born, under any circumstances, is covered by existing law. Sensationalism hurts the cause.
@SarahPalinUSA What efforts are R's - and D's - making to mount a primary challenge to AOC?
You just knew it would eventually get to this. https://t.co/DLE0QLZSn9

@bridgetbhc @DonaldJTrumpJr 3/1 begins the season of school trips to Washington, DC - a great time for both students and our elected officials.

@senatemajldr Government-run need not be the same as single payer. Insurance premium increases are much greater than actual costs b/c of uncertain risks of no caps and PEC. Let private insurers administer but have single Govt payer to lower costs.
@chrislhayes sounds like just a wonderful person.
@GOPLeader Perhaps the more relevant question is why not one Republican attempted to defend Trump yesterday.  All attack on the witness, and not even his testimony - just him.  Why is it so difficult to work together for the country instead of some cult leader?
@TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump Trump will be lucky to come back with Kim’s autograph.
@GovMikeHuckabee Governor, in all seriousness - mental illness is faced by so many people with various degrees of disability and risks.  It really should not be mixed with the abortion debate.  The 2 should not be equated.   Will appreciate your rethinking this line of comment.  Thanks.

@JeffreyToobin Largely true with a few notable exceptions.  Kudos to Congressman Amash - only Republican to focus on seeking information. On the D side, AOC and Jackie Speier showed real skill in their 5 minutes. And chairman Cummings was masterful diffusing a volatile issue.

@chiproytx Congressman, I appreciate your passion for many important issues you raised today. However, there is no more important issue for the country than ensuring our president is not acting criminally.  It should be the priority.
@thehill Mark Meadows should be added, too, after his little stunt this morning to "refer" Cohen for activity that is not, in fact, criminal.
@thehill Not one.  And the efforts of the minority committee members are just ineffective.  They have elevated Cohen's credibility and hurt the President. Amazing.
@dcpoll Isn't it ironic that Cohen defended Trump on this (and a few other things) yet not one Republican member has defended Trump on anything.  Not one.
@irinafowzry and she's concerned about child separation at the border?  That's rich.
@RepCarolMiller Congresswoman, please feel free to bring President Trump before the committee to offer his own testimony.  Frankly, I don't think his credibility is going to compare favorably with Cohen, or anyone else.
@RepSpeier Impressive work in today's hearing. Good job.

@chrislhayes Based on his own reasoning, Meadows shouldn't be believed.  "Mark Meadows .. must repay the government more than $40,000 after the House Ethics Committee found that Meadows didn’t do enough to address or prevent harassment" in his office. Nov 16, 2018 - Charlotte News Observer

@chrislhayes So far, you are correct. What is @Jim_Jordan and @RepMarkMeadows so afraid of with Cohen?  And why do they want to keep pointing out that Cohen lied TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT?  The truth - and their cover up of the truth - hurts all of them. @DispatchAlerts

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I have spoken out, favorably, when I thought you were on the right side of governing, even if we disagreed on a particular issue.  But Senator, voting to erode the constitutional separation of powers on spending issues will taint you and forever haunt those ceding control.
@Jim_Jordan What will it take?  At a minimum, an actual emergency.  		Curious why such “emergency” never arose during the 2 years of Republican control of both houses of Congress.

@NicolleDWallace “Republican allies on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform will aggressively question Mr. Cohen’s credibility, trying to paint him as a liar and accusing him of fabricating stories to help his cause.” Ask yourself- why would they seek to protect POTUS instead of country?

@Bornabrit1 Is it important for a president to be honest to the American people?
@SenJohnKennedy When / where has this happened?   Serious inquiry.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump The media?  or persons in his administration worried what concessions he will make when someone compliments his svelte physique.  You know it’s a fair question.
@HouseGOP The government’s own numbers do not support this - is there an issue with border patrol under reporting or are records being falsified?  There is a disconnect between the rhetoric and what is supposedly fact.
@GOPLeader I’ve never known someone who survived an abortion.  Seriously - is this an issue?  Oppose abortion all day long but is this a new frontier in the fights over abortion and women’s rights or is it just a sensationalized argument?  Thoughtful responses appreciated.

@NormOrnstein @RavMABAY Seriously.  This performance should scare the hell out of all Americans.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Better run out to the podium and tell him his 5 minutes are up.
@kaitlancollins WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
@chucktodd “So much money I don’t know what to do with it all.”   Bet we hear that again.
@chucktodd Well, he’s always showing something.
@KellyO Is he on medication or does he need to be on medication?
@KellyO “We’re claiming emergency. It’s a great thing to do.”  Huh?

@AngrierWHStaff Seriously - what the hell is he talking about?  Gobbledygook.
@kaitlancollins More disinformation - claiming his own Department of Homeland Security’s data is a lie.
@Acosta Forcefully taking property from private owners. Just great.
@JoyceWhiteVance What the hell is he trying to say?  Gobbledygook.  China. Brexit. Korea. Tariffs. - he’s scared.
@RepJerryNadler today’s power grab by the President - encroaching upon congressional appropriation authority - is yet another abuse of power rising to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor.
@WSJ How many victims of gun violence in the US over the past year? THAT’s an emergency. POTUS will try to make this  problem caused by immigrants - it’s not.  Less than 3 % of border crossers commit crimes of any type.  #StopLying
@SenatorCollins Senator, does this mean you commit to vote for a resolution of disapproval of the emergency declaration?

@Jim_Jordan Then I guess neither you nor POTUS have anything about which to worry.
@rbeaux54 @WarrenGetchell @Jim_Jordan @RepCummings Wouldn’t it be great if we just deal with facts?   Too many people being failed by our K-12 systems.
@JohnCornyn Senator, this issue deserves so much better than gotcha politics. In trying to hit back at Democrats for a problem created by POTUS, you are hurting people who had no responsibility for their predicament.
@NicolleDWallace Nicolle, unfortunately the answer is nothing.  We are doing nothing.
@seanhannity Certainly how we should interact with each other - let the president”stick it down their throats.” That attitude is a big part of what’s wrong with government today.
@realDonaldTrump If accurate, why would your favorability numbers lag behind 20-25 points?  Sounds like a problem that people have good views toward the economy and yet not toward you. Either you are not getting credit or voters’ bad feelings toward POTUS are stronger than financial goodwill.
@JackKingston You make a good point, Congressman. The speaker has a problem on her hands.  Need some grown up leadership.
@chrislhayes @EdClowes What the hell is Trump doing that we apparently don’t know?
@rbeaux54 @michaelrburris @Jim_Jordan @RepCummings I haven’t seen reports of the millions of prosecutions for illegal voting.  Only seen the fraud in NC by the Republican operative.  It would be helpful if you could provide the proof of “rampant voter fraud.”

@matthewamiller However, apparently he is smart ass enough.  He is showing disrespect for the entire country - just offensive.  Regardless of ideology, all Americans should demand more accountability from Whitaker and the entire administration.
Regardless of one’s political party, we ALL deserve more respect from the acting AG. Whitaker is violating the fiduciary duty he owes the American people. Really want him to have to hear that and answer to US.
@RepJerryNadler Mr Chairman, I personally would appreciate your sharing with Mr Whitaker that his comment about your “5 minutes” being up was received as his middle finger to all Americans. Flipping off America is not OK.
@JRubinBlogger Someone please send Senator Collins a copy of Kavanaugh’s dissent. Please write at the top, “ YOU GOT PLAYED.”  Surprise.
@AshaRangappa_ This is outrageous. When Whitaker tells the chairman “his time is up” he is giving the country the middle finger.  Hold him accountable to all of us!
@RepDougCollins congressman - respectfully - today’s hearing is important for our democracy.  The questions asked so far have been fair, specific, and were given to the witness to prepare his answer. His disrespect for the committee is breathtaking. Please take this seriously.
@TheRickWilson The guy’s professional future looks less bright by the minute. Thick headed and arrogant is no way to go through life.
@TheRickWilson Experience is what you get when you were expecting to get something else.

@AngrierWHStaff Please share - can’t watch right now.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov What environmental impact studies have been done? Seems like the movement of significant dirt and displacement of long settled topography would create drainage and flooding issues.  Significant erosion should not be allowed, and the surrounding land owners should be informed.

@JoyceWhiteVance @RepJerryNadler Maybe Nadler could offer to turn the air conditioning on and set it at about 40 to keep the “Albert Brooks level” sweating to a minimum.
@Fava @SenGillibrand I can agree w/ that in part due to the issues raised on this thread about the big step of going public &amp; “putting yourself out there.”  Even then, to be fair, there should be discretion in supporting one side or the other based solely on allegations. Thks  for your comments.
@Fava @SenGillibrand I agree there should be an investigation.  She has and should have that right.  The Lt Governor also has rights.  But credibility is a determination for the fact finder, and that rarely can be determined by the allegation alone. Let due process work.
@SenGillibrand Senator, serious question - what makes her claims “very credible”? I have no problem with valid investigations, but jumping to any conclusion - either way - should be discouraged.  You are playing with a person’s livelihood and future - make sure you are right. Thanks.
@JRubinBlogger Guys in New York pouring through records. You would not believe what they are finding.  You would not believe what they are finding.  Believe me.  That I can tell you.
@VA_GOP Yes. Every elected official should sign a statement under penalty of perjury that they have never engaged in such racist activities.  Confident that all Republicans can easily make such representation.  Thank you @VA_GOP for being a beacon of tolerance and inclusion. Not.

@RawStory Please obtain the infamous “routine audit letter(s)” that Trump has claimed for years.  There is more than a decent chance that there is no such audit(s).  It’s a BS excuse to begin with, but another lie about his tax returns may motivate some congresspersons to do their jobs.

@madwest45 @realDonaldTrump If this president had not lied every day in office - and most certainly longer  - he might be given some benefit of the doubt. He waived that claim of right long, long ago.  Free advice - don’t ride his coattails of “integrity;” the emperor has no clothes.

@JRubinBlogger Better to sell coffee to Americans than the BS sold to the country in 2016 (and every day since).
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Anyone who could be “goaded” Into running for President by name calling would not be someone to be taken seriously. But then again, a president engaged in name calling and taunting like this sets the bar really low.
@HowardSchultz Political office is much more impactful than leading even a large company like Starbucks.  Assisting Trump to stay in office is against the world’s interest, and an independent run is self centered.  Please add to the discussion, run as a D or R, but not as an independent.
@mccaffreyr3 @nytimes An attempt unilaterally to withdraw from NATO would be a failure to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.  Congress must step up and fulfill its role  as a co-equal branch of government.
@JoyceWhiteVance Insightful.  Thanks.
@mccaffreyr3 Always grateful for your service and leadership.
@JRubinBlogger Ds should not gloat- and the Speaker did not - Americans want grown ups to govern not play political games.  Ds are seen as doing that by the public and need to maintain that persona. So who cares how the President responds to getting his ass whipped.
@greta While having no idea if this happened or not, I suspect there was a desire to have a third party available to document what did NOT happen to counter whatever lies Stone would and will undoubtedly tell.
@dbongino Hmm. I didn’t read that in the indictment.
@amyklobuchar Run, Amy, run.
@RepMarkMeadows They seem very serious.  The Speaker passed on any chance to gloat.  This is about policy and balance of powers between branches of government.  This was the right result, even if temporary.   Hope a full resolution can be reached quickly.

@AshaRangappa_ @renato_mariotti Where might one send a package of diapers for President Man Baby?  Maybe send them to furloughed workers needing them for their own kids, courtesy of the Trumps.
@SenCapito All because of a temper tantrum by the President. Congress has shown it could - and did - pass a CR.   We are in this mess because POTUS changed his mind and threw a fit.  If he was your child, would you let him have what he demands whenever he demands it?  Senator, do your job.
@kaitlancollins Completely out of touch. Mr Secretary, 800,000 people may be 0.3 percent of GDP to you, but they are fathers, mothers, children, neighbors, and friends to American citizens.  Real people. Real pain.  How sad you lack empathy for so many people.
@SenCapito Pass the bill you already voted to support only a month ago and the House has repassed in this Congress.  Today it is furloughed federal workers. Tomorrow it may be coal workers in West Virginia. Senator, please don’t support hostage taking.
@RepBillJohnson I personally would be concerned about allowing the president to get his way because of a tantrum and holding workers (and increasingly our economy) hostage.  When he acts like a five year old, he has to sit in time out until he changes his behavior.

@marcorubio @POTUS Senator, you can’t let the President through a tantrum every time he doesn’t get his way and shut down the government.  Hostage taking is not acceptable.  Open the government and then negotiate.  Until that happens, POTUS is 20 points below Ds.  Just facts.

@BillKristol Agree, but unfortunately, what has POTUS tweeted lately?
@morewinningplez @brithume However, you are not correct about any committees’ actions.  They have been controlled by the Republican caucuses in both houses until 15 days ago, so no “committee” screamed impeachment.  Indeed, at least one member / committee chair reportedly being investigated himself.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Compare with the evil inflicted upon Chechnyans by their Russian invaders, who this week called upon persons to kill their LBGQT siblings.  Why would anyone want to have a “good relationship” with such horrible governments?

Why would the President WANT to “get along very well” with an invading country that has such little regard for life?  Blame Obama for not blowing the hell out of them when Russia invaded - blame Trump for showing approval for the invaders and not taking action the last 2 years https://t.co/ZeuRtnmdPH
@matthewamiller 2/2 “Cohen continued to work on the project and discuss it with Individual 1 well into the campaign ... it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” Cohen Sentencing Memo.
@matthewamiller 1/2 Cohen admitted to lying in front of Congress about plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow, telling lawmakers the deal ended before the campaign when it actually continued well into 2016.
@morewinningplez @brithume You are correct.  Mueller gets credit for issuing the statement last night - consistent with his stellar reputation as retold by Bill Barr this week.  Let him finish his work and then judgments can be made.  BuzzFeed “bet the company” by premature reporting - gutsy or stupid.
@brithume Fair enough.  However, articles of impeachment were voted favorably out of committee and would have been approved by the House within days had Nixon not resigned.  Suspect the country will have to address this again at some point.
@RashidaTlaib @CovCathColonels , let’s hope you can find a way to turn this into a teaching moment that honors your stated mission of “Building Minds, Living Faith.”
@seungminkim So at 3 he is granting pardons for all persons without documentation in the US - amnesty for all to start fresh.  Someone better let Ann, Sean, and Rush know.
@BrendenShur @allatti2d @BuzzFeedNews @gtconway3d unfortunately, you are probably correct.  while people make mistakes, and can be forgiven, I'm n to sure someone comes back from this if it is really false.  Suspect, however, the truth is some different shade of the original report.
@mviser @CillizzaCNN @michaelscherer This would likely re-elect Trump, assuming he is still President.  If he wants to run, run in one of the main primaries.
@KarenBoston @Internet_Hitler @Geenak @raych212 @LatinaChic1337 @SweetPicklesRG8 @RepAdamSchiff @DonaldJTrumpJr Why do you think they support prison reform? Our narcissistic president will slap his name on a prison and call it Trump Tower.  Orange jumpsuits by Ivanka.
@howardfineman Wouldn’t it be ironic if Trump’s shutdown is what leads R’s to change their position on impeachment and removal.  R senators will start to see their own poll numbers plummet and will opt for self survival over corrupt president.
@MichaelPacholek @natchezalley6 @jmeacham @11thHour And ironically, Nixon at least had enough shame to resign to avoid removal.  I don’t think Trump has any shame, certainly no recognition of wrongdoing.

@neeratanden hold your position. Trump’s “best people” are, in fact, not. Appreciate your insight.
@senatemajldr Senator, there is no reason to keep closed any government agency unrelated to border security including a wall.  Ds complaint is about funding a wall. POTUS holding hostage agencies because of no wall funding. Need leadership from you. End the shutdown please.
@senatemajldr Corrected:  My Republican colleagues have an important choice to make. They could stand with common sense, with federal workers and with their own past voting records… or they could continue to complain from the sidelines as the President refuses to negotiate with the Democrats.
@JohnCornyn No need for more posturing photo ops by the President.  There are 2 issues - they need to be uncoupled. Open the government and negotiate what security efforts are best for the US.  Lunch not necessary.
@pithywidow Don’t you know it ....
@kwelkernbc @rickwtyler @POTUS Although I am curious how “you know better than anyone” - even got a finger point - that’s sort of “take the rest of the week off” fantastic. Should come up with a whole list of “yes or no” questions.  That orange head will spin around.
@AshaRangappa_ @ddale8 He has to tell everyone he paid for it.  But I’d check the Foundation’s checkbook. Because it was so cheap, however, it is more likely he did pay for this one.  Just FYI - Evangelical groups aren’t mad that Chick-Fil-A wasn’t included?

@AshaRangappa_ @PressSec it is past time for this president to come clean, voluntarily or otherwise. if he is without guilt, he should want a full and complete investigation. The fact that our law enforcement even opened an investigation into anti-American behavior by Trump is just scary. Tell the truth,

@lauraapollo @Eidolony @NBCNews Wow.  I know it may be posted as a joke, and probably far fetched, but is there a way to use soybeans as a means to create other products like building supplies?  Plastics? 3D printing material? We need to help our fellow citizens hurt by this damaging trade war.
@thehill Can @thehill - or some media - please send a FOIA request for these “messages”?  While you are at it, get all those messages from federal workers who asked Trump to keep the government closed.
@stormestone @replouiegohmert @BreitbartNews As a matter of fact, I have spent a lot of time in southern Arizona, areas outside El Paso, and Southern most California.

@RWPUSA Look at me look at me look me!!!! He has lost his mind. 90 percent of US has no idea what the hell he would be talking about. A lawsuit would lower that number quickly and substantially, and at least half will believe he is guilty no matter the facts.  Stupid.

@brithume Trump improves his moral position by pushing through and signing the other approp bills that are not in contention. Makes him look more reasonable and less child like. Otherwise looks like what it is - political blackmail.  I think he loses.

@matthewamiller Either the statute is tolled or he can be indicted now. Walking “Scot Free” is not the Founders intent. Impeachment is a political solution-Indictment a legal solution.  It is not either/or.  Why should the US allow a criminal to stay in office while prosecuted by impeachment?

No willfulness is required, nor an underlying crime - the meeting itself is the crime.  Not sure that would play well politically, but also doubt that is all Mueller has.
@newtgingrich Right.  Remember that deal Reagan cut with the Russians to funds his campaign, or his turning his head away from the murder of a US resident and journalist because of his own financial interest?  Me neither.  Trump is no Ronald Reagan.
@Bornabrit1 Yes we should all believe him. With no legal assistance, his claims of privilege are limited. What did he review to answer the questions and to whom did he talk?   He says not his lawyers.
@kaitlancollins Yes, several congressional committees and the FBI talked to Clinton about hers and the result was the same.  Why are we suppose to disregard multiple investigations but accept your (not too respected) word?
@jimsciutto Will media types please push WH for a list of everything Trump did to obtain lower oil prices? Placing my bet on “not a damn thing.”
@JoeNBC R’s are likely already looking at another disaster in 2020. Question is whether it’s an election cycle or generational shift.  If and how R’s stand up to Trump will be determinative.
@h8Wankmaggot45 I think I’m in love
@JohnCornyn @SecNielsen “Humanitarian crisis” ? - yes.  Invasion of criminals and “middle easterners” ? - no.  I bet, as smart as you are Senator,  that if you reach across the aisle to address a humanitarian crisis, the Ds will accept your hand.
@thehill While there is a history of presidents disagreeing with SCT decisions, including Obama’s disagreement with Citizens United, those comments did not attack the judicial or personal integrity  of specific judges nor accuse them of bias impacting decisions. Trump did
@politico Yes, Chernow's topic is expected to be "the dramatic recent decline in presidential intelligence."
@realDonaldTrump Keep it up Mr. President.  The 5 more conservative  SCT justices will increasingly be under public pressure to vote against you to "prove" that are not politically motivated.  McFly?!! McFly?!!
Let us be clear about who we are giving a pass for having brutally murdered an American permanent resident.”  85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, says new report - The Washington Post https://t.co/oM5tDJ2MuU
@hughhewitt Hugh, come on - do you really doubt our Intelligence Agencies’ assessments that MBS is behind the hit on Khashoggi? Why doesn’t POTUS at least be honest that he values the economic and political benefits more than this reporter’s life?  So disingenuous.
@kasie Can we add one more rule that says the new dictates are only enforceable on days Trump or Sanders does not lie?
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce, you give them too much credit.  Just sign a memo of INTENT to purchase - no obligation - and this administration turns a blind eye. This isn’t America.  The money changers are occupying the temple.

@SenTomCotton If amendments are appropriate to the bill, by all means please bring them forward.
@SenTomCotton Senator it seems pretty clear from responses to my earlier question that there have indeed been hearings on this bill. I’m not taking a policy position on this but I do worry about falsely telling Americans that process has been ignored when it appears it has.  Please stop.
@MaddowBlog Must the Trumps try to outdo Hillary Clinton on everything?
@varohaub @graytfl @SenTomCotton Thank you Senator Lee for clarifying this.  @TomCottonAR, does this resolve your concerns that hearings be held on this?
@CillizzaCNN In fairness, he is the biggest A we have ever had as president.
@Susan_Hennessey Ask him to point out Pakistan on a map.
@ChuckGrassley All Americans regardless of political leanings should be supportive of this view. Our government and country are not well served by POTUS publicly bad mouthing senior officials and cabinet members.  After all, he chose them.
@WalshFreedom For many Americans, the concept of shame has evaporated.  The collective “We the People” only withstands so long as “I” get what I want and it’s better than you.  It is a symptom of a diseased democracy, dependent upon judgment and empathy.  Liberty weeps.

@ScottforFlorida @JohnCornyn Dear Tricky Rick,  is it more important to ensure all legal ballots are counted &amp; every Floridian’s constitutional rights are honored, or is it more important to violate thousands of voters’ rights just to secure a win?

@joelockhart @KellyO Apparently France Germany and Canada all figured out a way. Maybe no McDonalds along the route?
@Stonekettle @MalcolmNance As they say in Texas, Gaetz is all hat.  And in Florida, they might well believe his speedo is a bit too snug and has slowed blood flow to the brain. Can all blow hards - on all sides - just shut up and let the process work? Every vote deserves to be counted if properly cast.
@JackKingston Sounds like a plan. Florida continues to be a mess without adequate explanation.
@amyklobuchar Pass the Coons Flake protection bill. ASAP. And perhaps call Sessions to testify about how Whitaker ended up COS.
@brithume This is one of several issues that Florida needs to address going forward. No one knows for whom the ballots were cast, but those inadvertently mixed have tainted the 205 - may not be fixable.  But it is improper to use this “whataboutism” to disregard other valid votes.

@SenSchumer Amen and amen. President Lester Maddox should enroll in Constitutional Law 101.

@peterbakernyt @Acosta #StandwithAcosta
@TexasJul @PressSec I stand by my statement.  From reading the comments, it seems most people saw the same thing and it wasn’t the BS spewed by Sanders.
@dcpoll @Acosta Is there a fund set up to support legal fees for Acosta to sue Sanders for her purposefully false statements made to hurt him?  Sanders needs to be held accountable.  #StandwithAcosta
@joelockhart @nyfedsdaughter I hope there is a way for Acosta to seek damages for the false statements made by Sanders against him alleging some type of inappropriate contact with the woman grabbing Acosta.  So clearly a damaging lie.  Sanders needs to be held accountable even if Trump refuses to be.
@PressSec What is defamation law in DC?  The # of times your false statement was made and restated is probably each a publication. Even nominal damages would be substantial. Doubt there is immunity for your position and even if so would not apply to intentional acts. Retract quickly
@PressSec Everyone should watch the entire exchange.  I find your spin on what occurred to be very misleading.  He had the mic - she grabbed at him.  POTUS egged it on and caused the brush up in the beginning.

@JenniferJJacobs @maggieNYT @jonkarl Tell Trump they’re coming to one of his rallies. It will then morph into the largest mass of humans in history and all likely to receive asylum.
@peterbakernyt I’m no Paul Ryan fan. But as it relates to constitutional knowledge, between Ryan and Trump, Trump loses every time.  Come to think of it, that is true between Trump and most anyone else.
@JRubinBlogger Ironic is t it?  The man craves attention and admiration, yet has no idea how to cultivate those feelings in others.  His focus is always inward while lashing out instead of reaching out. Give him this - he will be consequential in history, just not in the way he sees it.
@maggieNYT It is easy to be snarky; I do it a lot as part of a “gallows humor” to keep my sanity. But in seriousness, @BeschlossDC said it best and most simply - (paraphrasing) empathy and conciliation are just not in POTUS’ toolbox.  He doesn’t have the ability. Hurting us as a country.

@LindseyGrahamSC Senator, please tell us you understand that birthright citizenship provided via the 14th Amendment is not subject to presidential - or even congressional - whim.  I have to believe you know this.  For the love of God, man, quit helping POTUS violate his oath of office.

@Eviltrkeyslice @kwelkernbc @POTUS I agree she certainly hasn't received justice to date.  But it is impossible to call her experience "false" since no one had the political courage to actually seek the truth. Our country is headed down a dangerous path.
@JoyceWhiteVance Can. Not. Wait. To. Vote.
@chrislhayes Four of nine justices currently serving - FOUR - were nominated by presidents winning in spite of a minority of the popular vote.  This time, the nominee had less than a majority of public support as well. This will eventually cost our Republic.
@kwelkernbc @POTUS I hope the image of Dr Ford's scared and pained face haunts Kavanaugh every time it is mentioned.  History will not be kind to either Kavanaugh or Trump, and we all face judgment someday.

@bobbbyg @PressHerald @PPHEricRussell @thisdog @SenatorCollins Please hold the President accountable for his cavalier - and mean - attitude toward women and sexual assault victims. Voting to proceed on Friday will tell POTUS that what he said is OK.  It is not OK. Maine deserves better. Thank you.

@josiahdartagnan @dcpoll Presidents and Members of Congress may be voted out or are term limited. SCT justices have no such limitation. More relevant is the importance of creating a check on the unbridled President. Simply switching one of the houses blue would do that. House is easier.

@thehill A fresh perspective in an administration of moral relativism. Keep it up Senator.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Please consider what you are saying - the Republicans are rallying to protect POTUS mocking a woman claiming a sexual assault whose accuser is a self professed “obnoxious drunk.” Sure as hell not my daddy’s GOP.

@SenateGOP @senorrinhatch Truthful to Congress? Fair and unbiased?
@senorrinhatch The personal slights - perceived or otherwise - in the Senate are not relevant to the nominee’s qualifications and temperament for the Court.  Senator, you are better than this - get over the procedural / political side show &amp; focus on  issues affecting BK’s suitability for SCT.
@SRuhle Bet they’re Prada frames.
@SenFeinstein More abuse of power.
@CillizzaCNN Agh!  Admitting going to a UB40 concert is itself probably disqualifying.  Hang it up, Brett. No wonder you drank.
@senorrinhatch If the timeline shows BK did know of the Ramirez claim before it was made public, there will not be any reasonable argument that he did not lie.  Question will be materiality of the falsehood. Don’t know about perjury but almost certainly violates judicial ethics.
@JoyceWhiteVance This starts to approach a basis for judicial review of the judge by the DC circuit. Looks like a pretty black and white case of false testimony.  Wonder if the standard for an ethics violation is the same as for perjury.  Also, bar inquiry?
@JoyceWhiteVance The people of Arizona in her jurisdiction might find her rush to “nonjudgment” disturbing.
@senorrinhatch Yes. That’s what professionals at the height of their profession do.  HOWEVER, I’d settle for him just being truthful. That would be a start.
@senorrinhatch Interesting use of the term “crumbles.”
@senorrinhatch Of all of the potentially qualified nominees who fit POTUS’s ideological criteria, why fall on his sword for Kavanaugh, someone clearly with alcohol issues and potentially truth issues?  One reason - protecting POTUS from special counsel. Huge risk for Republicans Think. Think.
@SenTedCruz Really neat how you sent the bill for the tax legislation into the future for our kids, grandkids, and great grandkids to pay.
@frankthorp Wonder how history will reflect Senator McConnell.  A skilled political player or a statesman?  Will he have contributed to making our union “more perfect,” or will he have contributed to desecration of our democratic republic?  Just having to asks suggests the answer.

@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC @BWilliams @NBCInvestigates Every effort to limit that scope should make its way into the media immediately.  Otherwise it’s a trap.
@JRubinBlogger Think of the audience of one. The one difference between Kavanaugh and others pre-approved by the Federalist Society is his expansive and non mainstream views that POTUS cannot be indicted, subpoenaed, etc while in office. Trump cares only about him.

@JRubinBlogger It is disgusting.  The contrasting picture of his behaviors and the dignity Dr Ford has tried to hold onto in the face of this kangaroo court is vivid.  Every woman in America with their own Kavanaugh Moment is reliving they own nightmare today.  So sad. So angering.
@SteveSchmidtSES If Senators Graham, Cornyn, Grassley, and team keep talking, it will be a Democratic Senate in 2019.  The lack of empathy and political tone deafness of these guys is astounding.  Really disappointed in Graham.

@SteveSchmidtSES What does this do to the chance of a senate flip? Certainly doesn’t help R’s.
@davidaxelrod She highlights the huge contrast between real Americans and the 11 angry old white men. Just awful optics.
@chrislhayes Im not sure I can agree with you here.  Ford’s testimony is uncovering a lot of anger about how the Republicans have handled this nomination in particular and women in general. She is really brave.  She speaks for a LOT of women who have experienced their own Kavanaugh moment
@amyklobuchar It strikes me that every single woman who has ever had their own assault nightmare is reliving it this morning.  It breaks my heart and also angers me.  R’s have hurt this country - and themselves - in the manner this has been handled.
@HardballChris Grassley and gang are only hurting themselves. Mitchell not helping. Just amazed they don’t see this.
@IngrahamAngle As a purely political matter, the nomination is hurting POTUS and R’s.  The optics of this hearing are horrible for R’s. Ms Mitchell may be a nice person, and perhaps even a good state prosecutor - she isn’t helping the R caucus today (not totally her fault). Grassley looks awful
@ChuckGrassley Non-partisan, Senator. Not Republican staff, not Democratic staff.  I'm sure they are all fine people. The appearance to and perception of all Americans is extremely important, maybe paramount. Isn't a lifetime appointment worth investigations done correctly? vs lifetime regret?

@JRubinBlogger Maybe it's time?  Maybe?  There guys wouldn't know country over partisanship if it whacked them in the face like a bag of nickels.  Starting to think maybe the FBI should investigate committee members - what is it with this particular nominee?  No shame.
@MSNBC Just can't say it, can you, Mr President.  	"Russia." 	Now you try it.
@senorrinhatch Can you guys knock it off?  Please? Think about the country for once.  @senorrinhatch that means a full investigation by the FBI and release of all documents. @maziehirono that means no gotcha games. When you are driven by an artificial deadline of midterm elections, you mess up.

@ktfos55 @SenFeinstein This might actually work, but there will be issues with the discoverability of her work product and whether internal rules were followed for hiring professional staff.  If a politically hire, there is likely no exception.  Just too cute by half.
@MikeRey43186001 @SenWhitehouse "Charging" a fee is not an element of whether one is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, although fees might be disgorged if they were paid.  She's not a senator.  She's not a lobbyist. And if she is not a lawyer, then there is no privilege.  No R women lawyers in DC?
@Sa_MCDR @MichaelAvenatti my goodness, I guess you are right.  I don't know anything about this,  But if I DID know something about this, I might know that whether one is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law is not dependent upon whether it involves a court matter.  Nor does it depend upon payment.
@MichaelAvenatti Counselor, curious to know what you think about lawyer Rachel Mitchell plans to practice this week in DC without a DC license? (licensed only in AZ, according to AZ Bar) Rule 49 of DC Ct of Appeals prohibits unlicensed practice. Privilege inapplicable?

@11thHour Rachel Mitchell is listed in the Arizona Bar directory as licensed only in Arizona.  She will be acting as a legal counsel in the District of Columbia on Thursday .  So it appears she will be practicing without license in DC, which will likely jeopardize her in AZ

@MichaelAvenatti Mr Avenatti - serious question.  What would happen if BK is confirmed and seated on the court and then Maryland indicted him?  Convicted him?  Assume the Senate refused to convict on impeachment.  Not sure there would be a remedy.
@fowldsbarb @ShannonBream And potentially a new cause of action for defamation has now arisen.  If truth is the goal, an investigation would be conducted and all persons who can add to that effort would be meaningfully questioned.  But neither side believes this is about truth to the other side.
@senorrinhatch Maybe subject to penalties of perjury, but the letters are not the same as testimony subject to cross examination.  It’s a cute trick senator, but in the age of Trump, Nunes, Jordan and others of your colleagues, so much of what is presented falls apart with only a gentle wind.
@Lawrence Know what is really sad?  It’s really sad if these R women believe this AND it’s really sad if they don’t (and still say it).
@senorrinhatch Senator, please.  Random and meaningless time deadlines are political. Refusing to follow your own past insistence on an FBI investigation of the allegation is political. Leader McConnell’s public statement that he has the votes prior to any discussion with Dr Ford is political.
@seanhannity @GreggJarrett And Rosenstein would jeopardize his career why????  Better check D. Nunes’ recent emails with NYT.
@realDonaldTrump In related news, AMERICAN jobs being lost due to ill considered and self inflicted trade mistakes made by this Administration. More to follow (unfortunately)....
@seungminkim So He has no foundation to dispute what happened.  Ds can still use his past writings as part of questions to Kavanaugh - his and Kavanaugh’s past statements and writings are just awful and really raise some concerns.
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC In related news, multiple American assets have now been revealed and face harm.
@RepSwalwell Congressman, I oppose the nomination; there are multiple concerns with Judge Kavanaugh, include Dr Ford’s allegations.  But she loses credibility, and the D’s lose the higher ground, for her not to testify without condition.  Otherwise, it begins to smell. Hope she reconsiders.
@Mastermind7864 @berrymaiden Yes
@TheLastWord @maddow @Lawrence While R’s absolutely should explore the Ford allegations and demand transparency, so should D’s. Failure of Dr Ford to provide testimony without strings or demands will not only hurt her, it will hurt D’s.  Big risks now for both sides.
After today’s developments, it is appropriate to also say that transparency, openness, and timeliness is a 2 way street. Not fair to swoop in, dirty up the process, and then demand other steps before willingness to testify.   Failure of the Ds to demand this will also cost them. https://t.co/qZZbw8fCWc
@GeorgeTakei @berrymaiden I see what you did there.
@senorrinhatch Anything short of complete transparency of information potentially relevant to Judge Kavanaugh’s behavior and views will be costly to R’s.  Please don’t limit this committee hearing in an effort to control message or predestine an outcome. PS calling it a game wont help either.
@JoyceWhiteVance The optics of Monday’s hearing is fraught with danger for R’s. 11 white males, largely older, facing an accomplished woman witness who has what appears to be a story with credibility. Not sure there is a win obtainable for R’s.
@DavidCornDC In related news, House staff members added another section to the draft articles of impeachment  of POTUS for abuse of power.
@seanhannity And in other news, Paul Manafort.  #anotherflipper
Just wow https://t.co/SwxmISOcxm
@JoyceWhiteVance How would he feel if his own daughter was making such allegations? Would he want to get to the bottom of it or sweep it under the rug? If there is no truth to the allegation, as he claims, Kavanaugh himself ought to demand the hearing be re-opened so he can prove his innocence.
@FoxNews In RELATED news, Paul Manafort is now, what I like to call, a “flipper.”  #anotherflipper

@thehill Professor, do you mean they were late to the Obstruction party?
@MotherJones @jaketapper Media should publicly pledge not to end its investigative efforts to get to the truth even if Kavanaugh is confirmed and sworn in.  The public deserves to know to what the Senate turned a blind eye.

@JRubinBlogger All media need to step up their game and point this out.  Need a return to "meaningful shame."
@sahilkapur (1) Kavanaugh is unique among the federalist list because of his extreme pro-executive powers stance. Iindeed, this is what stood out to Trump. (2) time is not yet an issue, but could be if this drags out past Oct.  D's just need to get past election hoping for a Senate win.
@PhilipRucker @emmersbrown And how is Mrs. Kavanaugh responding?  Maybe she and @FLOTUS can form a new book club?
@JRubinBlogger Odds still favor confirmation, but at what cost?  R's have to use political skill and judgment to avoid another anti-women episode; they cannot sweep it under the rug without a price paid.
