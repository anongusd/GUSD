@RickGre65152764 Entrance fees have predated the National Park Service and  help pay for improvements to visitor services (road repair, upgrading campgrounds, etc) that aren't possible with appropriations alone. Of the 400+ national park sites, only ~120 charge an entrance fee.

Today @SecretaryZinke signed an order to begin the process of @USGS creating the first ever national survey of #CriticalMinerals: https://t.co/ji82jzw2lu
@VinceBoombatz @USFWSPacific They estimate she is 67 years old!
@mutukumiraray @USFWSPacific Wisdom was first banded in 1956. And because Laysan albatross do not return to breed until they are at least five years old, it is estimated Wisdom is at least 67 years old, but she could be older. It's an amazing story, isn't it?
@himat @USFWSPacific What an experience! Thanks for moving the birds to the beach. It's amazing seeing photos of all the albatrosses nesting there https://t.co/vwPcF6jgbL
@MrMikeMac @USFWSPacific There are older birds in zoos. Wisdom is the oldest known wild bird at an estimated age of 67!
