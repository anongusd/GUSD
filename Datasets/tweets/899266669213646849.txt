@JawMadison @TheDemocrats Let's agree to disagree.

"The new House bill being drafted by Jayapal will likely have a transition period of two years." Partial list of advocates excluded from the process. https://t.co/McVJzoWpLR https://t.co/TID62p1Ane
Advocates were right to refuse to support @RepJayapal new Medicare for All Scam. She is delaying the roll-out as they feared. If she didn't get pressure from the public it would have been a 4 year delay but she's going for a 2 year delay.

@Ockerlord @RoKhanna @justicedems @RepJayapal @SpeakerPelosi Yep this is the bogus plan advocates warned us about. "HR 676 had a transition period of between 1 and 2 years (if the bill was passed on January 2, it wouldn't be implemented for 2 full years), with no benefits until full implementation at the end of that period."
