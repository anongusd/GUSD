"However, VA still has significant problems in the system that need to be addressed, starting with the unrealized efficiencies of NWQ and the seeming lack of authority for VAROs to resolve claim issues at the lowest possible level." #VFWTestimony
"In closing, the VFW does believe that VBA is headed in the right direction philosophically in establishing a fully-electronic and easily-accessible claims process..." #VFWTestimony
"It becomes clear that the efficiencies and innovations that VA seems extraordinarily proud of don’t exist in the eyes of veterans and the family members who continue to suffer delays and denials due to incorrect rating decisions."
"We are appreciative of the VAs efforts in seeking VSO input... Yet in the final analysis, despite our repeated attempts urging VA to assess shortfalls and take corrective action before programs went fully operational, we have seen VA forced to play catch up time and time again."
