Fact: We‚Äôd love more facts, but the CDC was effectively banned from conducting research on gun violence in 1996. Collecting the facts requires allowing the CDC to do their job and study all public health crises - including gun violence.
Fact: The gun lobby spent more than $52 million dollars on the 2016 election. How can we count on elected officials to help us prevent gun violence when they are financed by the NRA?
Fact: Gun laws work. The 10 states with the weakest gun laws have an aggregate level of gun violence that is more than three times higher than the 10 states with the strongest gun laws.
Fact: Blaming mental illness for mass shootings is not only stigmatizing, it‚Äôs false. Individuals with mental illness are more likely to be a victim of gun violence than a perpetrator of it.
Fact: Teenagers in the United States are 82 times more likely to die from gun homicide than their peers in other developed nations. This is a uniquely American problem that we cannot ignore. Our kids deserve better.
