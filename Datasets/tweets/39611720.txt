@LeoCruz1787 @BrandonBG_ 1) UCF and the citadel are in the same tier of college football, which is why you don‚Äôt get a home and home. 2) SEC teams schedule tough OOC games all the time, even with a hellish SEC schedule. See: Florida scheduling Michigan and FSU.

@kombiz If you want to start down a rabbit hole, here‚Äôs a great explainer and critique on how it works in the Air Force, and suggestions for fixes: https://t.co/9O3WTrB8JN		And here is the response from the top general in the Air Force: https://t.co/0k3XOQSeQY
@kombiz And it‚Äôs *very* complicated. Each service has its own system and way of doing things. When you get above Major they are Senate confirmed. And many, many more reasons.
@kombiz Again, just because it doesn‚Äôt make the news doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening and not public. The general public doesn‚Äôt care much, so you have to go deep into military twitter/journals/DOD pubs to see what‚Äôs happening.
@kombiz Progressives have a perception problem among active duty military and veterans, and tweets like yours, where you‚Äôre blindly assuming that the military doesn‚Äôt do work to try and weed out bad leaders and continually improve only make it worse.
@kombiz Ok, same. Criticism of the military happens a million times a day too. I chose to engage with you on this because you‚Äôre influential in progressive politics and campaigns.
@kombiz d) What does Kelly‚Äôs anti-immigration views have to do with his role as general? If he kept those viewpoints to himself and did his job and carried out the orders of the President, nothing.		Youre going to tell me there are Principals out there who don‚Äôt hold the same viewpoints?
@kombiz c) Bro - yes. There is plenty of reflection in the pentagon and work being done on how to make sure that the best leaders rise and corrupt/racist/poisonous/etc leaders don‚Äôt. Just because it doesn‚Äôt make the news and you don‚Äôt hear about it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening
@kombiz a) how much would you hate it if I, someone who knows very little about the public education system, blindly condemned the entire education system for those leaders in Atlanta? 		b) the military has 2 million active and reservists. There are a lot more leaders than just the 231
@kombiz And sometimes the system is successful and sometimes they are not, correct? 		There are 1.3 million members of the active duty military and 800k reservists. The system is always working to weed people out and be better. Sometimes DOD is successful, sometimes they aren‚Äôt.
@kombiz There is a LOT that you can criticize the military for, but your condemnation in this instance is one that every organization faces. Wholly unfair.
@kombiz Then it also reflects poorly on the public education system that these guys could rise to leadership positions, right? https://t.co/4zYwdYGhAn		Anthony Weiner made it pretty far in the Dem party. Hell, Conyers was judiciary ranker. Reflects poorly on everyone in Dem politics?

@AlexanderMcCoy4 Even if it did impact those two things, those are side effects to Trump using the military to accomplish domestic political goals.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 Does it? Will these troops be interacting with them at all? Trump‚Äôs position on this has already defined his relationship wit Mexico, this is unlikely to change that. 		They were deployed weeks before the people were due to arrive, to a place where they weren‚Äôt even going.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 Yes, this is all true, but what‚Äôs important are the ends you‚Äôre trying to achieve.

@AlexanderMcCoy4 A reset isn‚Äôt going to do anything. And no matter what happens, the face of the party is going to be the nominee. And plenty of the base loves Nancy Pelosi.

@AlexanderMcCoy4 Right, this is what a weak Speaker would do. Don‚Äôt have the votes? Don‚Äôt bring it up. The point is Pelosi has a track record of getting the votes she needs on tough legislation, which allows her to bring it up and get it passed. Think it‚Äôs easy? Ask Speakers Boehner and Ryan.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 - show what can happen if we have a Dem Senate and Dem President. We can‚Äôt do that if no part of the Dem agenda is passed in the House

@AlexanderMcCoy4 This is wrong I think. We‚Äôre going to need something to run on in 2020, and showing success in the House is going to be critical. It takes someone like Pelosi to keep the caucus in line, especially those in tough districts who will want to avoid tough votes.

@danpfeiffer Yet another reason that plays into a campaigns spending strategy. This publicly telegraphs that these orgs are going up on digital, freeing up money for the campaigns to spend elsewhere.		But when FEC reports come out, it's going to be "BUT WHY ARE THEY SPENDING SO MUCH ON TV!"
@CommsDirector Perfectly honorable to subtweet, but to speak out or stop a madman from being elected in the first place is unbecoming of a General Officer. Come on Dave, you didn't know that?
@danpfeiffer How campaign professionals can say that spending money on tv is wrong for all campaigns using only AOC, Pressley, and Gillum as examples is...well, irresponsible.  Show me data backing this up rather than anecdotal examples and I'm happy to listen.
@danpfeiffer This year, when Trump has awakened a huge swath of new voters, is different than 2010.  The piece even makes that clear.		You do a benchmark, spend a bunch, do a tracking poll, spend a bunch in a different way, and see what moves the numbers more.
@danpfeiffer I really just don't see how anyone can apply this as a blanket statement to all campaigns. Each district, each election is going to be different. A primary is different than a general. A district in South Florida is going to have a lot more seniors than suburban Detroit.

@teddygoff ...a good manager will have a baseline, do a week of digital &amp; then a tracking poll to see how the numbers move.  Then do the same with tv, and evaluate which one has more of an impact. It will be different for every district, every state, &amp; you have to adapt for individual race.
@teddygoff ...it's nearly impossible to break through that noise, no matter how much you spend. It's a lot different when there are few campaigns up at 1000 points/week. 3) this is what polling is for, to ensure you use your money in the most efficient way possible...
@teddygoff A few things here. 1) Gillum's campaign is one data point, not a complete body of evidence that you need to make the determination that digital is more effective 2) Gillum competed on tv with three other Dem gov campaigns, two GOP gov campaigns, AG and other statewide races...

We should elect more veterans of every demographic, ethnic background, gender identify, religion, sexual preference, and whatever category you can think of. We should do that because they know what it means to serve.
The subheadings of those three are even worse. One of them is ‚ÄúI will meet with someone from an opposing party one-on-one at least once a month.‚Äù Yes, cuz as we see, that solves all of our problems.
Is With Honor naive enough to think that every Member of Congress wouldn‚Äôt respond affirmatively if they were asked if they act with integrity, civility, and courage?
It ends with ‚Äúwell we have differing positions on this issue. But I respect the fact that you‚Äôre willing to have a conversation on this issue.‚Äù So?  This is the new ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù. With Honor wants us to say ‚Äúsorry this happened. But hey, at least we‚Äôre talking about it!‚Äù
Haha jk. They both staked out their position and came to no compromise whatosoever.
What happened? Spoiler alert. Moulton wants to get rid of assault weapons and Taylor thinks they‚Äôre protected under the 2nd amendment. So they came to a compromise and decided to ban high capacity magazines.

@AlexanderMcCoy4 @Jason_K_Dempsey It‚Äôs consistently near the bottom of voter priorities. Health care, economy, immigration and many more all higher on the list, almost always. And revered institutions and professions matter more than foreign policy.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @Jason_K_Dempsey The base may want to have a conversation on foreign policy, but in the end that conversation doesn‚Äôt matter because foreign policy doesn‚Äôt move voters, base or otherwise.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @Jason_K_Dempsey He knows the military and officers specifically are revered and that their opinion and how they are treated (or perceived to be treated), matters.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @Jason_K_Dempsey Whether that‚Äôs bad or not doesn‚Äôt matter...that‚Äôs the way it is. Trump always said he was best for vets because he recognized that. It‚Äôs a populist issue.
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @Jason_K_Dempsey Being a veteran resonates in politics because every year Gallup finds that military officer is one of the most trusted professions &amp; the military the most trusted institution in America.

This is why Trump is offering to testify under oath. No tapes, &amp; no one else in the room. Trump made sure of that. His word against Comey's. https://t.co/IQ5ClTsPvz

But to also say whether he thinks Trump broke the law and committed obstruction of justice. He set the standard, he should live by it. [end]
Than his decision to have dinner with Trump should allow him to not just testify on exactly what transpired and leave the rest to others...
If Lynch's decision allowed him to have that presser and pass judgment on Hillary's action while declaring she hadn't broken the law...
And c) while McCain rambled and made no sense in the hearing, he was actually right in his clarifying press release.
And maybe we would've, maybe we wouldn't. But these are some of the smartest people around, &amp; look at how they performed. This shit is hard.
b) These jobs are some of the most challenging on earth, and we probably all look at what happened and say "I would've done better"...
a) Comey is a big ol' hypocrite. I bet at the time he had said to himself "I'd never have done that". But in the end he did.
But he did the exact thing he criticized Lynch for. Allowed himself to be intimidated by POTUS. So what I'm trying to say is...
Sure, he thought others were going to be there, but he could've left. And he said he wishes he had spoken up and told Trump proper protocol.
But didn't Comey do the exact same thing when Trump invited him to dinner? Only worse, because he had time to think about it.
It's been reported that Lynch felt like she couldnt have refused a meeting with a former President. She made a snap judgment under pressure.
Basically saying Lynch made a huge mistake which created a situation in which he had no choice but to go, in a word, rogue.
Comey confirmed that the meeting with Loretta Lynch and WJC on the plane was a main reason for his email investigation press conference.
One thing that's been bothering me about the Comey hearing and his testimony...
Guys, guys, guys. Team Trump knows damn well that Comey's disclosure wasn't a "leak". They are attacking his credibility for a distraction.

The Commandant didnt mince words. If you can't understand this, get out of our Corps. You don't belong. (end thread) https://t.co/1oYLTcQ2if
And we're going to set the example. We're going to lead, because that's what Marines do.
Because you're a Marine, you do what is right. The @USMC is going to leave  wrong to the civilians who wouldn't make it 3 days in bootcamp.
And being part of that fighting force means you understand right from wrong - and engaging in the behavior that Marines United did is wrong.
The culture needs to change. Young Marines need to understand that they are members of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.
It hurts women personally, it hurts the people that love them, it hurts women as a gender, it hurts the @USMC, and it hurts our country.
It has friends emailing me, as though somehow I hadn't seen it, as though somehow I am responsible, because I am a Marine.
When something like Marines United happens, it makes all of that seem completely empty. It denigrates the service of other Marines.
We're taught to rely on the Marine to your left and to your right, no matter who you are or where you come from.
We're taught this from day one. Honor. Courage. Commitment. The Few. The Proud. JJ DID TIE BUCKLE.
We're supposed to be better than everyone else, especially, ESPECIALLY, the lowlife spreading revenge porn &amp; pics meant to be personal.
The Marine Corps is supposed to be made up of the best that America has to offer.
What @AlexanderMcCoy4 gets absolutely right, however, is that this is a culture that the Marine Corps has done little to change.
So I disagree this is a result of segregated training environments, and I vehemently disagree this is a culture the Marine Corps created.
...much less post nude pics of their ex that they believe belong to them. This mindset starts well before recruits arrive in SD or PI.
Our society (globally, not unique to the U.S.) has a problem making men understand that it's wrong to catcall... https://t.co/U5FuEoxrfm
These were normal civilians, brought up in regular homes, who dont know that this is wrong, or dont care. I suspect for many it's the former
They didnt have different training environments for men &amp; women, and didn't have a slut wall for girls who dumped their recruit boyfriends.
The fact is, 100s of revenge porn sites exist, w/ millions of visitors. The ppl who run &amp; visit them didn't learn this behavior in boot camp
This is tragic - an embarrassment to the corps. But this is not behavior that is unique to the Marine Corps, or even the military.
There were over 30k members of this FB group, both active duty and veterans, who circulated nude pics of female service members.

@John_Hudson covering this was your attempt at edification? Is edification the role of the journalist or Philip Gordon?
@John_Hudson no need to embarrass the hell out of him in FP Mag. But I respect your point of view.
@John_Hudson My point is it sounded like an honest question, he got an honest answer, and now he knows why assassination isnt an option...
@John_Hudson How much of your time would be taken if you covered every ridiculous question in an OTR briefing in DC.
@John_Hudson can be considered senior staff on the house side. This was an CFR briefing, not an NSC meeting.
@John_Hudson Sure, but this is newsworthy? Fair point on senior staff, but you know as well as I do that 26 year olds who are not experts..
@John_Hudson It was an opp for him to learn from experts. Think he'll ever ask a Q in public again? Now he has to be worried about his job..
@John_Hudson I have to guess this was a kid who was intellectually curious and thought he was in a safe place to ask Qs...
@John_Hudson Serious question: what do you gain by picking on a staffer, probably a young LC, asking a Q at an OTR event? This is ridiculous

I wonder if he'd known, when he said he'd always wanted a Purple Heart, that many, including American Muslims, had given their life for one.
I wonder if Trump knows that his rhetoric and his policies are fomenting violence against American Muslims https://t.co/em6PUVdodj

I wonder if he knew that calling for a complete ban of Muslims into this country would keep out people like Captain Khan.
I wonder if Trump knew that Iraqi &amp; Afghan Muslims have put their lives on the line for this country, and live in danger everyday b/c of it.
...it was those values that made him take those 10 steps. Those 10 steps told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country"

"If you want to see the best of America, then you need look no further than Army Captain Humayun Khan," Hillary said https://t.co/MTKwsq0lY6
Then, in December 2015, just over two months into working at @hfa, @hillaryclinton gave this speech. https://t.co/MTKwsq0lY6
I have to believe he never would have called for such a reckless policy. At least I hope. Nothing would surprise me at this point.
If Donald Trump had ever met one of the Afghans that put their lives on the line every day to help Afghanistan and the U.S. achieve peace...
But when Donald Trump called for a ban of Muslims coming in to this country, that's when this became a mission for me.
I‚Äôve always believed in @hillaryclinton. I always knew she had the experience to continue moving this country forward.
They deserved special immigration visas to come to the United States. They wanted nothing more than to contribute &amp; live the American Dream.
Not only had they been loyal patriots to their home country, but they had been helping the U.S. achieve its objectives as well.
When they and their family came under threat from insurgents and they needed to leave, they looked for refuge in America.
They were hard working, loyal people who I will be friends w/ for life. They wanted to make their country better &amp; end decades of war.
When I served in Afghanistan with USAID, I met some amazing people, who also happened to be Muslim.

@LorenRaeDeJ Eh, I tend to think representing your country on the international stage is inherently patriotic.
@LorenRaeDeJ ...we expect candidates to refrain from criticizing opponents while overseas, athletes should do the same. End rant :-)
@LorenRaeDeJ But representing your country in an international setting is a whole different thing...
@LorenRaeDeJ Especially if it's actually raising awareness and helping to move the country forward.
@LorenRaeDeJ IMHO, if she really feels strongly about making a statement in a domestic game, like all athletes, have at it.
@LorenRaeDeJ then maybe you dont really understand what it is your protesting in the first place.
@LorenRaeDeJ Which goes to your point - if youre willing to play for a country that you feel the need to protest in an international setting
@LorenRaeDeJ ...you shouldnt be there in the first place.
@LorenRaeDeJ If you can't stand up for our national anthem in a competition in which you are representing our country...
@LorenRaeDeJ International athletic competition is a way to project soft power, just like exporting our culture and relying on diplomacy
@LorenRaeDeJ Interesting. Intent actually means less to me than the setting, though...but now that I think about it, theyre both intertwined

It's not enough to get to 270 electoral votes. We must do far better.
And think about how destructive and un-American Donald Trump's policies are.  And vote on November 8th.
Instead, listen to this interview. I can promise you haven't heard anything like it in a long time. https://t.co/5lpwYy6Jyg
...you'll stop giving the likes of Carl Paladino the attention he craves. Instead, remind everyone what Mr. Khan said that night.
To really get back at those who spread awful lies about a family that has sacrificed more than most of us can imagine...
"Have you ever even read the constitution?" Mr. Khan asked.
And he was reminded that, in Donald Trump's America, Captain Khan wouldn't have been allowed into the country that he died defending.
He was told that Humayun Khan gave his life for this country and its citizens.
Trump was reminded that he called for a ban on Muslims entering this country.
Donald Trump said he was "viciously attacked" by Mr. Khan, &amp; that he has a right to respond. But he wasnt attacked. He was asked a question.
...which is the attention to be shifted away from what Mr. and Mrs. Khan said that evening, and to a character assassination.
But any more than a quick condemnation is giving the people who spew this hate exactly what they want...
These attacks should be condemned by every American, especially elected officials and anyone who aspires to be a leader in this country.
I see the Trump Campaign is attacking the Khan Family again, with remarks from Carl Paladino that are too vile to repeat here.
