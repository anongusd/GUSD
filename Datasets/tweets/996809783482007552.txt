I’m so confused.  Conservatives think Rosanne should be able to keep her job for racist “jokes”, and football players should be fired for protesting American issues.  Now their premise is freedom of speech.  		#RosanneBarr #BLM #blacktwitter #NFL

@FoxNews @NFL The Fox network is a disgrace to an enlightened America.  And again... There is a simple solution here.  We could all just accept that the American flag represents an America that struggles to properly train officers on how to use brutal force against other Americans 🤣

@trblc23 @FoxNews @NFL 3. There is a simple solution here.  We could all just accept that the American flag represents an America that struggles to properly train officers to not use brutal force against other Americans 🤣
@trblc23 @FoxNews @NFL 1. Just because Fox chooses not to report players doing charity in black communities does not mean it is not happening.  You should do some research.  Several current/ex-players have extremely active non-profit organizations that do just that. 2. This is about police brutality.
@HarleyQ696969 @FascistFB @FoxNews @NFL Is it the money or the cries of the privileged they care about.  I’m sure Colin’s doing ok without his pay check. 🤣.Several other players that y’all enjoy watching could probably survive without there’s also.  What they are responding to is nagging patrons and biased publicist.

@ministryovlove @FoxNews @NFL I just don’t see the disrespect you all speak of.  I think the contrary if they didn’t respect this country they would fake sick in the locker room. 🤣 Or pretend police brutality isn’t happening, and there aren’t a bunch of dead black people because of it.
