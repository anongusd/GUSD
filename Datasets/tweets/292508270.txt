Spend #kyderby chasing jockeys, getting quotes. Everyone not at race asks: Did you meet Guy Fieri? Um. no. #ilovemyjob
Jockey Robby Albarado on being pulled from #kyderby winner Animal Kingdom: "It's over. I can't do nothing about it now. No changes now."
Seen at #kyderby Fred Thompson of Senate and Law&Order, ex-qb Warren Moon and chef Guy Fieri. Conclude what you will about this development
Business brisk at #kyderby. Vendors doing well despite economy, iffy weather.
Picking horse for #kyderby. Got a bunch. Fun people watching too.
Not at Kentucky Oaks today. Prepping for Kentucky Derby on Saturday. #kyderby
