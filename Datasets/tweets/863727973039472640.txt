Each work has to pass through ridicule opposition , and then acceptance .Those who think ahead of of their time are sure to be misunderstood
People with good intentions	Make promises but people with 	Good character keep them
Money is a small coin 	Health is a big coin	Love is a lucky coin 	Friendship is a sweet coin	And relationship is a gold coin 	 Keep it safe
Little adjustment  is always better than a lengthy adjustment 	And a meaningful  silence is always  better than meaningless	Words

Purpose of education is to moralize and socialize the people

Life should be great rather than long
Never play with feelings of	 others, because you may	Win the game. But you will surely lose the person
Our is a battle not for wealth	Not for power,ours is a battle; 	For freedom ; for reclamation	Of human personality
