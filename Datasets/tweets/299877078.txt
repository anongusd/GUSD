You're going to be seeing a lot of numbers fly by about Paul Manafort's potential prison sentence in Washington DC. The bottom line: he can't be sentenced to more than 10 years in DC. Remember, he's turning 70 yrs old April 1st.

Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker says he has been "fully briefed" on the special counsel probe and that he thinks the investigation is "close to being completed." He said he's looking forward to getting a report.
@wanderslug Yes, it will be reset for another day, but for now, the word in the judge's order is "cancelled."

Bill Barr says, "There hasn't been a special counsel removed since Archibald Cox and that didn't work out very well."
On marijuana, Bill Barr says the current approach "is  breeding disrespect for the federal law" and that Congress needs to act to make a decision about whether to "regularize" and "federalize" the situation.

"If you take this job, you have to be ready to make decisions &amp; spend all your political capital &amp; have no future," AG nominee Bill Barr says. "I feel I'm in a position in life where I can do the right thing &amp; not really care about the consequences. I can truly be independent."
Under questioning from @SenatorLeahy, who asked whether Bill Barr would "commit to both seeking AND following the advice of career ethics officials" about recusal from the Russia probe, Barr says he will seek their input but under the regulations, Barr would "make the decision."
AG nominee William Barr makes clear that when he met with President Trump in mid June 2017, Potus knew that the Barrs and the Muellers were "good friends" &amp; basically says he politely declined to join Trump's private legal team defending against the Mueller probe.
Service to the Justice Department and to the country, Barr's friends say. He himself says he was "reluctant" to wade back into this job at this time. https://t.co/yIPEXjzL1r
AG nominee William Barr, in response to q about obstruction statute &amp; Potus: "If a president attempts to intervene in a matter that he has an interest in, that first should be looked at as a breach of his constitutional duty."
William Barr says former Atty General Jeff Sessions "probably did the right thing" in recusing himself from Russia probe; that he has a "very high opinion" of Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein &amp; his service at DOJ; and that he doesn't believe Robert Mueller would be involved in witch hunt
Beyond his daughter and son in law, who both work at the Justice Department, Attorney General nominee William Barr is flanked by current US Attorney @USATerwilliger and current head of the Office of Legal Counsel Steve Engel.

The news that Doug will serve as the top lawyer for the House of Representatives means that Nancy Pelosi &amp; other Dems will have the benefit of sterling legal advice as they advance a legislative agenda, and as they seek to impose accountability on the Trump White House/agencies.
Since then, he’s been thinking and advising at Georgetown Law Center, to great acclaim.
As for Letter, he told me in March that “one obviously has to be concerned about the Justice Department and the future of the Justice Department."
Former Attorney General Eric Holder says Doug Letter “personifies what is best about the Justice Department.”
Doug shared this as his proudest moment at Justice - “The Obergefell case," he said. "That's the one where the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage was constitutionally protected."
Doug Letter spent 40 years at the Justice Dept before retiring earlier this year. For him, public service is a family matter and a calling.

Prosecutors have just filed a "motion to travel" for Russian agent Maria Butina. Agents want to take her to interview rooms at US Attorney's offices in Alexandria, Va., and Washington, DC, and to the grand jury in DC.
"A sitting National Security Adviser, former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year-veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents. He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents...."
The government brief says then deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe told Flynn the questions would cover his contacts with the Russian ambassador in a call BEFORE agents arrived at the White House for the interview. Flynn also had "multiple" chances to correct the false statements.
The special counsel says Flynn first lied two weeks before the FBI interview, when he talked to the media, incoming VP Pence, and other members of the presidential transition team. And he repeated those lies to the FBI.
JUST IN from special counsel, urging the judge to reject Michael Flynn's efforts to "minimize the seriousness" of his lies to the FBI: "Nothing about the way the interview was arranged or conducted caused the defendant to make false statements to the FBI on January 24. "

Special counsel says Paul Manafort told "multiple discernible lies" including that he or others were in contact with administration officials as late as May 26, 2018. Authorities say he also lied about "another DOJ investigation," topic redacted.
Comey says he has "total confidence" in the Fisa process and believes the system worked. He adds that the Mueller probe is proceeding "incredibly quickly" and without leaks from the government.
"I like and respect Bill Barr, I know he's an institutionalist and cares deeply about the Justice Department....I think he'll serve the Justice Department well," Jim Comey tells reporters as he leaves a daylong deposition by the House Judiciary/Oversight Committees.

Basically, Butina's lawyers argue the statute, acting within the US as an agent of a foreign govt, is unconstitutional bc it is too broad and captures all sorts of First Amendment protected activity.
"If fantasizing about a future career in diplomacy &amp; jabbering about personal events and peacebuilding aspirations w others like a friend &amp; mentor who happens to be an officer from some foreign govt agency...makes one a foreign agent," then lots of people are breaking the law.
Butina team says govt doesn't allege she was an agent of Russia in the traditional sens but rather she ran afoul of law bc "she shared her memorable American happenings and naive, youthful optimism...with others." 2/x

“I believe that as long as we live we can learn,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says when asked if she’s still “optimistic” about the court’s jurisprudence on racial &amp; gender equality given its composition. She cites Rehnquist upholding Miranda after a long record of opposition.
Justice Ginsburg says Sandra Day O’Connor believed in an independent &amp; fair judiciary, and launched a civics program for students that’s “amazingly successful.” That shared understanding of who we are helps us put country over party &amp; hold govt officials to account.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returns to the DC Circuit for the annual Flannery lecture. She’s talking about “the art of judging” with Judge David Tatel. https://t.co/RYE3Bbh0ji

RT @Robertwaldeck: @johnson_carrie @lrozen @joshgerstein 35 sets 2 per set 1 for the witness and one for defense counsel
@lrozen @joshgerstein The filing I saw earlier today said 35 subpoenas. Not sure where the number 70 came from. Now eating tacos after a long day so not near Pacer system to check.
@CHitch94 It's a good one! Funny + touching moments too... 👍
@lrozen This is normal order for prosecutors preparing for trial not a pressure tactic. Also I thought there were 35 subpoenas not 70.
@CHitch94 Yes but the wiretap is not surprising since it has been known that Cohen's  emails were being surveilled.
Pretty much this. https://t.co/p1J0sKVNSW

The word "funneled" through a law firm was used. No info on whether the $ came in batches under $10k.... https://t.co/po2ByaFRpm
Rudy clarifies Trump repaid Cohen over a period of months. "Just trust me, they're going to find no violations here." https://t.co/r054MnOl1W
Rudy also says Trump repaid Cohen the $130k. That's new. https://t.co/DHVm4kkfFY
Rudy Giuliani says there's "no campaign finance" problem with any Stormy Daniels payment. Trump "didn't know the specifics of it but he did know the general arrangement." That's what lawyers like Michael Cohen do for clients.
Rudy Giuliani says the country would be "up in arms" if prosecutors "went after" Ivanka. When @seanhannity asks about Jared Kushner, Rudy laughs and says, "well men are disposable."
Rudy Giuliani says he believes a president cannot be subpoenaed in a criminal case. He says, "I believe (Sessions and Rosenstein) should end this investigation in the interest of justice."
Rudy Giuliani says "right now the odds are he (Trump) wouldn't be interviewed" by the Mueller team. "But I wouldn't close my mind to it," on @seanhannity show.
Rudy Giuliani calls former DoJ employee James Comey "a disgraceful liar" to @seanhannity - recall Comey had some harsh words for Rudy's tenure as US Attorney in his new book.
Key question, Rudy Giuliani tells @seanhannity, is whether Mueller team is "objective." Fear he says is that they made up their mind and believe @Comey over Trump. "This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice."

@joshgerstein It warms the heart, really
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein glosses over tensions between DOJ and the White House, but nods to some with Congress. "Their duty is not to interfere with any ongoing investigations...not to compromise national security or endanger any informants."
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, at the Newseum for Law Day,  is cracking jokes with interviewer who wants to hand him a piece of paper. "It's not a subpoena, is it?" Rosenstein asks.

@benjaminwittes I also think this special counsel investigation is moving more quickly than any I have covered in 20+ years. But it's not clear yet whether the courts will be the ultimate decider, or another branch of government will.
@benjaminwittes I think Flynn is giving Mueller something or someone(s) he wants and that the lenient deal reflects that cooperation. Still not sure how far up the ladder this gets, but it will be difficult &amp; ugly and I expect more charges and possibly more pleas.

White House lawyer Ty Cobb praises special counsel for moving quickly, adds: "Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn." But, what about the statement of facts???
New statement from Michael Flynn on his guilty plea &amp; agreement to cooperate. He says the deal reflects "a decision I made in best interests of my family &amp; of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions."
