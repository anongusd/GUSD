@chrisasabutton @MooreSenate I am as thrilled as I am stunned by the eager willingness of many Alabamians to overlook my character flaws and grasp my potential. Then again, some people say “Grasping” is my middle name.
@woodpecker002 @chrisasabutton @NotSoLibtarded @MooreSenate I have never had the pleasure.. No offense intended, but Chris is way too old and he’s the wrong gender. However, Richard, I might make an exception for a fine Texas specimen like you.
@woodpecker002 @chrisasabutton @NotSoLibtarded @MooreSenate I have never heard my campaign committee and/or the good people of the Great State of Alabama referred to as a “twert” before. You one of them Commies?

@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @seanhannity I have lost a voter here, gentlemen. Poor, confused &amp; grammatically challenged Jimmy seems to have mistaken me for a despised Democrat. Naturally I expect voters to discount the words of 9 lyin’ Alabamians over mine. https://t.co/oJ2xPhfgAb
@GovernorKayIvey I know you believe those harlots that assault me with accusations of child molestation, but I thank you, Governor, for putting aside conviction in favor of political expediency.
@JudgingRoyMoore ANOTHER apostate! https://t.co/hpYNLOgNQb
@MooreSenate Well, it’s almost 4:00am..Time for me to start prowling around for votes.
@Cherylsway Now I’m depending upon the good people of Alabama to disregard character as a prerequisite for office. Indeed, I expect my fellow Christian Conservatives to viciously attack all my Alabamian accusers in the interests of partisan politics.
@Cherylsway And that would have some relevance were I on trial for a crime. In the court of public opinion, no such legal presumption of innocence obtains.
@denise_cullum Evidently, you are a subject of the Crown, but you might want to exercise some care when inviting Americans to register their willingness to enter into a rebellion against the US. Advocating the violent overthrow of the government IS a federal crime.
@denise_cullum I welcome your efforts, Bubbles. However, in addition to the aforementioned obstacles to bringing a successful defamation action, as the judge, I am a public figure. Moreover, you are evidence that no harm was suffered. I will be elected overwhelmingly. #MAGA
@tallahoe Aw Jimmy, again I am forced to disabuse you of several mistakes...Parody &amp; satire are legal exceptions to defamation. Also, Truth is an absolute defense to libel &amp; slander. The statute of limitations prevents charges from being filed by anyone.
@tallahoe Now don’t you worry your poor little head about it, Jimmy. I’m confident that the good people of Alabama are just like you and character is as immaterial a consideration to them as it is to you. I’m gonna be elected by a landslide.
@tallahoe Moreover, I was an adult, in my 30s, forty years ago. And molesting a 14 year old was a crime then, as it is now, under Alabama law. (How I hate to correct the very people I’m depending upon to elect me to the US Senate)
@tallahoe As a former prosecutor I’m obliged to point out that a criminal standard of proof only applies in a trial. The accusing women are percipient witnesses. Their testimony would not be hearsay. And this is a parody account as is designated in the profile.
@proledicktat @tallahoe Now you’re a voter and voters aren’t supposed to think. I want to end public education &amp; replace it with private Christian schooling. I want to prosecute any woman getting an abortion for capital murder. I want everyone packing heat. I want to kill all homos.
@tallahoe ...my denial of 9 Alabamian women’s accounts of my actions ought to be considered in terms of my honesty. Naturally, I insist that all these females are lying and I’m the only one telling the truth here. Besides, character is irrelevant. I’m a Republican.
@tallahoe I don’t know if they’re interested in hanging me. They seem to think that my actions as a prosecutor in violating Alabama law have any relevance to my fitness to serve as a United States Senator. Some of my political opponents actually think ....
@tallahoe I’m thrilled to learn your son-in-law was not castrated for taking your 14 year old daughter to the woods, stripping down to his tighty whities &amp; trying to force himself on your daughter. It all worked out. Just because it was against the law is irrelevant.
@tallahoe That’s it on the nut! People have no right to take my adult behavior into account in evaluating my character. The evidence describes my actions a long time ago. Ask yourself, would it be fair to bring up a murder I committed 40 years ago? Of course not.
@NotSoLibtarded @chrisasabutton @MooreSenate (Evidently)
@tallahoe I am a big believer in pickin’ the fruit when it’s ripe.
@NotSoLibtarded @chrisasabutton @MooreSenate My date was short. Apparently my business is not appreciated at the mall...probably owned by Libtards!
@tallahoe I’m all for the Christian bonds of matrimony. Of course, I prefer no ties and a couple of those lying Jezebels did claim that I accosted them.
@NotSoLibtarded @chrisasabutton @MooreSenate Another one bites the dust

@girlscouts @campfire_girls @gossipgirl @BGCA_Clubs I am seeking the endorsement of organizations for which I have intimate knowledge. I ask you to embrace my candidacy for the US Senate. Winning will be like taking candy from a baby. #MAGA
@sweetatertot2 @realDonaldTrump There is absolutely NO ONE more #Deplorable than me. And I make this promise to you, that once I’m elected to the Senate I’ll be reviled by every single citizen everywhere. You’ve heard of me, but you haven’t seen anything yet!
@kelliwardaz I offer my unconditional endorsement to Dr. Kelli &amp; her campaign. I also want to thank my good friend, Steve Bannon, for his unstinting support of my own candidacy. Together, we’ll RIP the GOP to shreds. There’ll be nothing left. And that will #MAGA God bless
@MooreSenate There is absolutely nothing in the Ten Commandments forbidding Tighty Whities! https://t.co/jYW9Md1bn8
@rebeccaactually @CouldYouJustN0t @pwheelerlvt @NewYorker You tell ‘em, Grandma!!
@pwheelerlvt @NewYorker You’re just bitter OLD women! I’ll bet you’re at least 25!
@NewYorker The girls love me! It’s those jealous old women that hate me. But I’ll fix them. Just wait till I’m a Senator!
@graywolf @LydiaDYork @chrislhayes That’s right!!! Its a forgery. All of these people..McConnell, McCain and ALL the Democrats are conspiring against me. The MSM is in on it. They’ve bribed Alabama women to lie about me. It’s a vast right &amp; left wing plot to keep me out of the Senate!
@chrislhayes FAKE NEWS!!! I’m too smart to leave evidence. That’s why I take my girls to the woods.
@PunishPence @Elastigirl2018 Pence is my kind of guy... deaf, dumb and blind.
@GDouglasJones @MooreSenate Lil gals are just naturally drawn to me as I drive around Alabama. https://t.co/S2kxc6SuTH
@DrDavidDuke @GDouglasJones I do have to say that I’ve dated some very sweet black gals. The only problem was that they couldn’t stay out after 6:00pm on school nights.
@ChelseaClinton You’re kinda cute, but you’re way too old for me!
@HillaryClinton Blah blah...I’ve dated some of those lil gals &amp; they ought to encourage their parents to move to Alabama &amp; vote for me! Judge Roy Moore for Senate!!
@KellyannePolls @GDouglasJones Kellyanne, could you recommend a good coloring book to go with the crayons I bought my girlfriend for our 6 month dating anniversary present? https://t.co/X2OGg8v6r5
@GDouglasJones It’s a conspiracy I tell ya! Those Hollyweirders, Weinstein, Spacey &amp; that comedian are all in on it. This is a political plot to keep me out of the Senate. I only molest people that chafe my hide. But I do like those sweet young things. #MAGA
@GDouglasJones Forget Jones! Any REAL man will tell you that he’d rather be with a sweet, young thing than some old, wrinkled prune draggin’ a trailer park of luggage behind her. So vote for me, Judge Roy Moore for Senator. I’m your man! #MAGA
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @GOP If you think I molested little girls, you just wait &amp; see what I’m gonna do to those Dems! As God is my witness, I’m gonna line those Libs up like sheep &amp; shaft them till their eyes bug out! #MAGA
@ProudResister @san_houcy @FoxNews If the sex is good for me, then it’s good sex.
@VicenteFoxQue @elderberryplace @realDonaldTrump We here in the Great State of Alabama don’t care about the rest of the world. It’s #AmericaFirst .. minus all those commie states, like California &amp; New York.

@northkats @TheGoodGodAbove In MY court, that’s clear, unambiguous DEFINITION of character!
RT @chrisasabutton: "Did you date teenage girls?", reporter	"Not generally, no", Roy Moore. He later said "I dated lots of young ladies."…
@RealAlexJones I need your money. I need your help. I need your lil girls. My campaign is based on strict Christian Conservative principles. I believe the Bible should be the center of all public &amp; private education. Christianity should reign in Govt. #MAGA
@infowars #Vote4Me I believe in strict Christian Conservative values. I’m opposed to the minimum wage, homosexuality, taxes on the rich, undesirable people &amp; the Media (except for FOX, Breitbart &amp; onfowars). Support me for the Senate! #MAGA
@RVAwonk All this hubbub about my dating practices while I was a prosecutor is re-DICK-u-lous &amp; politically motivated! As an Assistant District Attorney, I concentrated on the Penile Code, helping young girls avoid run-ins with the law of Alabama. #MAGA
@RepComstock You’re a little mature for my taste, but I’d still appreciate your endorsement of my candidacy. And, by the way, if you have some granddaughters, I’d welcome their participation in my campaign. #MAGA
@nbcsnl On behalf of myself &amp; my campaign I’m proud to accept your kind offer to host SNL’s special Christmas broadcast. As you know, I’ll be accompanied by my own troop of young, female elves. I also look forward to your endorsement of my Senate campaign.
@MMFlint Michael, I’m appealing to you, as a fellow Moore, to support my candidacy for the US Senate. We all suffer occasional peccadillos. My appreciation for young girls is entirely in keeping with Alabama tradition. May I count on your endorsement? #MAGA
@TENI_Tweets I’m looking for support wherever I can find it. Would you consider granting me honorary membership in your organization? #MAGA
@RepMoBrooks Home of America’s most notorious pedophile...ME!
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP I want to thank you for your unwavering support of me &amp; #pedophiles everywhere. We certainly feel comfortable &amp; welcome in the Republican Party &amp; in all Christian Conservative circles. BTW, when’s the next Camp Fire Girls’ cookout?

@ilove_libertine @MooreSenate @seanhannity No bushes. No trees. I prefer it free of foliage.
@heidirosie @MooreSenate @seanhannity Hey...I resemble that!
@ExDemLatina @MooreSenate @Emma19780 @seanhannity Thank you, but it’s more like Hump Hump Hump!!!

@FoxNews It’s 10:00pm. Do you know where your children are?		I can tell you where your little girls are!
@Adamtheactivist @Nugoomi @seanhannity Well, your moniker does include the word, “Child.”😉
@breningstall @SenShelby @amyklobuchar My memory, like my interest in teenage girls, comes, and my commitment to Conservative Christian values, goes.
@SenShelby @amyklobuchar Addressing an excited group of campaign staffers, Judge Roy Moore described his legal problems and explained, with his team’s help, how he planned to get himself off. https://t.co/3OaafYLwUG
@GovernorKayIvey I recently spoke with the 1st Christian Girls’ Academy 8th Grade Civics/Gym class and explained, under Alabama law, how I could get them off. https://t.co/vsYptXQgZ4
@seanhannity Sean and I discussed our mutual interest
@Adamtheactivist @Nugoomi @seanhannity Maybe, but Sean and I share a mighty big urge.
@Nugoomi @seanhannity Sean and I exchange photos
@SenateGOP I couldn’t be happier with my campaign staff! However, I do need someone with a driver’s license to round up younger female volunteers. https://t.co/KVXmlNhDch

@chrisasabutton @overfield_jay @JeffFlake @Kmginnis That’s my base. They LOVE me!!
@samthejewishguy @JeffFlake I am NOT a pedophile! I am a Christian Conservative Pedophile. There’s a big difference there.
@overfield_jay @JeffFlake @Kmginnis Now to be fair, I never had to lock any doors. I’d just offer the little girls cookies &amp; milk &amp; take them to the woods.
@tx_blue_dot @JeffFlake @Tam_Resist Carroll’s one of MY people. I’d get in her pants, but she’s old enough to vote!
@JeffFlake Jeff, I could molest a 2 year old and these idiots would still vote for me.
Welcome to Alabama where I will personally provide daycare for your young girls. I believe in taking a hands on approach offering Christian Conservative values. https://t.co/PERdCeYcRa
@TweetHomeAla I can provide care for your girls.
@AlabamaWBB These girls are too old for me.
@seanhannity I’m depending on you deluded dummies to sweep my mess under the rug.
