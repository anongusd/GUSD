@NalediSpaceLaw @renarde @RCKGreenwald @LorenzosCreati1 @NYCMayorsOffice There are few (if any) med staff in the U.S. who have only seen patients of one sex.

@NalediSpaceLaw @renarde @RCKGreenwald @LorenzosCreati1 @NYCMayorsOffice The quoted portion of my comment was in reference to "female nurses being demanded".

@NalediSpaceLaw @renarde @RCKGreenwald @LorenzosCreati1 @NYCMayorsOffice That's problematic to public health. Anyone with a cervix still needs to be screened for cervical cancer if they are at risk.

@TheClash709 It’s a bit of an odd thing to censor. I did see the event where an elderly woman (assumingly LGBT) was assaulted/battered by a younger (FTM?) individual. I’m secretly anticipating VICE to cover this issue at some point.
@TheClash709 Yes, their article made an odd, poorly worded attempt to deflect the statistics (they mentioned the stats they were trying to refute at least twice). Even so, any individual of any gender who’s a registered/convicted sex offender shouldn’t be exposed to any vulnerable population.
@TheClash709 I just read up on Karen White in the UK...pretty disturbing. And for prisons/jails it should be a no-brainer that safety for the masses is paramount.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I’m definitely out of the loop...like actual bats? If these individuals are exhibiting intimidating behavior they can be charged with menacing...Ah yes, I do remember reading an HRC pamphlet and watching an @ArielleScarcell video on “GirlD*ck” Rather disturbing...
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch Sounds like a misrepresentation in education. That’s one of many reasons why our country needs comprehensive, earnest, sex education. Sex is not mutable. Unfortunately, you’ll always have quacks in every field.
@TheClash709 Seriously? That’s some kind of extreme case? Using the word “female” offends trans folks?? Just “female” or using “male” as well? Those are scientific/biological terms. That’s the equivalent of claiming that XY/XX is offensive. The medical/scientific community cannot be censored.
@TheClash709 I concur. Out of curiousity, have any of these lawsuits been decided in favor of the plantiff or defendant?
@TheClash709 As a medical professional...we’ve seen it all. We’ve had both MTF and FTM trans in the practice where I used to work. Most patients have it flagged in their charts. The FTM still need to get seen because..uterus. And the MTF...honestly they could go to urology for their anal pap.
@TheClash709 Uhh, I’m sure they can find someplace that will do it if they’re HONEST when booking the appointment. The lawsuit sounds like garbage. I understand that some folks may have dysphoria but there are certain fields where reality sets in (e.g. Emergency department, etc.)
@TheClash709 There are women being assaulted in prison by MTF trans? Is it a trend, an outlier, etc? For clarity, one assault is too many but I am curious of statistics. You equate drag to blackface or just commonalities? That’s quite the comparison...I need to ponder on my stance on that.🧐
@TheClash709 That’s really weird that anyone would sue a spa for not waxing their testicles. Don’t businesses have the right to refuse service? What’s was the basis for denying service? In any case, it preemptively sounds frivolous...like the hot coffee McDonald’s lady. 😒
@TheClash709 Not a crime at all, just @Twitter Terms of Service. However, they should apply their standards universally. They will never do that because it would eliminate major influencers (e.g. Donald Trump). So they police the “little guys” (or anyone that’s heavy reported.)

@TheClash709 Ah! I remember reading about this actually and wondering TFW to Twitter. I don’t follow how it’s misgendering if the person refers to themselves using the same name/pronouns. Also, if a grown man is inquiring online about assisting a girl with a tampon...that’s crossing the line.
@TheClash709 Unfortunately, only time will tell. As for children, it’s quite the dilemma however we shouldn’t be administering these treatments to children without knowing the impact.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I see where you’re coming from, as it is also culture/geographically dependent. A perfect example is Iran. Iran is #2 of the world’s highest rates of SRSs but not due to gender dysphoria...it’s exacerbated by religious homophobia. It’s literally the only way gay people can live.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I concur, while their conditions should be given attention we should err on the side of caution. We literally have no idea, how and in what way hormone blockers or hormone therapy will impact the health of these children. Unfortunately, the current generation are guinea pigs.
@TheClash709 Those reactions are a bit odd considering testosterone is already present in females and it’s not biologically possible for a MTF to menstruate. Patient education issue? I figure if they’re being treated for Gender Dysphoria they could have another comorbid condition as well.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I’ve only seen one 2014 medical article that stated a significant satisfaction % , (only had MTF data not sure why it excluded FTM data). To be honest there’s A LOT of data/studies lacking in this particular area. Until we know more, it’s still listed as a treatment modality.
@TheClash709 Most defintely, it’s key to not “throw the baby out with the bath water”. Hmm, can you expound upon the exploitation/eugenics angle? 🤔
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch Whoa, is there an example of this 80s incest thing? I think that it’s significantly more difficult for social sciences to have theories authenticated because it relies on human behavior. Several factors (e.g. time) negate problematic theories; public opinion bias is the worst.
@TheTweetOfGod @JerryFalwellJr Dang! Good one G-d! *High-Five*
@a_salty_pinch ...We’re not all trans.
@TheClash709 Is this actually published? I will read more but just the excerpt alone is concerning. Was this peer-reviewed? 🧐
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch Interesting...I will read up on this individual. 🤔
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I concur! I wish I had seen this post earlier...I could have saved some of my words “preaching to the choir”. You are correct as I have seen countless commentary w/the erroneous belief that sex actually changes. As of recent, there are claims that sex is a social construct...
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I’m not a fan of Money or his Reimer experiment fiasco. It’s not uncommon in the social sciences to have crackpot individuals whose theories we adopt. Freud loved cocaine, yet we continue to utilize some of his theories like psychoanalysis...we also threw away some others.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch Some individuals find that SRS relieves their gender dysphoria. In part, I believe secondary sex characteristics (facial hair, voice, etc.) and not just stereotypical characteristics attribute to relieving dysphoria. 3 y/os should not undergo any procedures. It’s irresponsible.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch I agree that psychiatric diagnoses need oversight and scrutiny in general, which is cause for revisions to the DSM. I know Money had inappropriate (understatement) views regarding children. Kinsey had similar views? An issue I believe is that society has conflated gender and sex.
@CTurbeau @kristianDavid @JaniceFiamengo Why mention issues that have nothing to do with your point?  Unless perhaps you ran out of space, which in that case there are other mediums for extended commentary (e.g. Reddit, etc.)
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch There is no medical definition of transsexual that claims to alter chromosomes/genetic sex. All of your statements are correct except for the first and last sentences. It is when the medical definition/psychiatric diagnosis is misconstrued where the issue arises.
@TheClash709 @a_salty_pinch The med definition of a transsexual is one who seeks, or undergoes, physical transition via cross-sex hormone treatment and/or SRS. Transgender refers to the broad spectrum of individuals who transiently or persistently identify with a gender different from their gender at birth.
@ComedyHype_ John Leguizamo’s “Latin History For Morons” @LatinHistory101   Ask me why...  😏
@a_salty_pinch Your entire claim is contrary to the American Psychiatric Association. All the previously listed disorders are derived from the same Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 5th Ed. Your post (as well as those who liked it) displays ignorance of medical diagnoses.
@a_salty_pinch Via the DSM V (the same manual where OCD, ADHD, and ASD are listed)...Gender Dysphoria DSM-5 302.85 (F64.9) - People whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. American Psychiatric Association (2013) DSM (5th Edition)

@a_salty_pinch No...we are not all trans. That’s like saying “we’re all a little OCD, ADHD, Autistic...” A chromosomal pattern need not “match” to a social construct (e.g. boys in blue, girls in pink c. 1927).

@JaniceFiamengo Oversimplistic fallacies.
@CTurbeau @kristianDavid @JaniceFiamengo The legality of female genital mutilation is dependent upon where it is performed. Of note, the 1996 U.S. ban was deemed unconstitutional. There have never been criminal penalties. Both male &amp; female GM are medically unnecessary and inhumane. Both should be brought to an end.
@LoudmouthR @kristianDavid @JaniceFiamengo Some people either assumed the Selective Service would include women upon the ban on direct combat being lifted. I myself was an unfortunate few who erroneously assumed that. Or they have no clue what it is. It is also extremely classist that it is a requirement for financial aid
@LoudmouthR @kristianDavid @JaniceFiamengo Selective service should be changed to include women now that women are 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐝 to be in direct combat roles (c. 2016). Selective Service is an antiquated remnant from when women were not technicically allowed (some exceptions for ancillary services) in the armed forces.

@Sparkdiggety @HercFamily5 @stonejf @bonegreco Yes, it may be perceived as political endorsement by the military. Perception is key. I never spoke to the probability of this being a case. There are appropriate and inappropriate ways to balance freedom of speech as a private citizen and representing the military in public.
@IDream_inColor9 @HercFamily5 @stonejf @bonegreco @loudlong If I’m not mistaken, the story you posted and the story in discussion are two separate incidents. This member seems to be inquiring if the CINC can sign his hat. DoD 1344.10 doesn’t address that as inappropriate. The slogan may skirt the boundaries but it’s still a personal item.
@HercFamily5 @Sparkdiggety @stonejf @bonegreco @loudlong I believe it’s reasonable to agree that bumper stickers &amp; banners are dissimilar. Per directives, political activities must not be perceived to imply military support...which may be conveyed via a banner. GS civilians are governed by the Hatch Act, not the same rules as military.
@Sparkdiggety @HercFamily5 @stonejf @bonegreco @loudlong For clarification, going back and rereading the directive, they do categorize bumper stickers, signs, and banners differently w/o further distinction. However, compliance must be met if it is ordered removed. Perception is key, and if perception implies support conflict arises.

Wow, if she was in fact told (aka given a direct order) to put it away and purposefully disobeyed, her behavior as a Capt is reprehensible...

@bonegreco @loudlong DoD Directive 1344.10 is a reference.
@Trumprocks3 @Suz_Todd @loudlong Cheering for someone and displaying a large trademarked political slogan, in uniform, at work, in support of a partisan candidate (‘16 election &amp; ‘20 re-election) are two entirely different circumstances.  For your own edification, read DoD Directive 1344.10...
@loudlong @feliciano_jorge Conflating support for CINC &amp; promotion of a partisan candidate is problematic. A banner w/“Trump” is not identical to “MAGA”, a ‘16 election remnant. The former is acceptable, the latter is skirting the boundaries. To fail to see that perspective speaks to a lack of objectivity.
@HercFamily5 @stonejf @bonegreco @loudlong DoD Directive 1344.10 clarifies appropriate and inappropriate political activities f/military members. Retirees who are entitled to pay are also under the same jurisdiction...that includes Retired Air Force...
@HercFamily5 @Omniseed @loudlong @BethLynch2020 Where’s the banner?
@HercFamily5 @stonejf @bonegreco @loudlong Expressing political ideology/affiliation as a private citizen and expressing the same ideas in uniform/at work/in the public eye are two entirely different actions. Political bumper stickers are allowed on POVs but not to be displayed on base. Actions do not signify correctness.
@bonegreco @loudlong I think you missed the main concern...the military (to include those who represent it) are to remain neutral (publicly) in respect to politics and religion. It is also in direct violation of the UCMJ; a separate set of laws that military personnel are supposed to abide by.

@ik3 @loudlong Even if it was asked of that Capt, it’s disconcerting that she didn’t make the appropriate judgment call regarding that request. There will be significantly greater vital decisions she’ll be responsible for and no doubt that her future decisions will keep me up at night.
@Sherri60647025 @McFarlinFred @loudlong Seriously? So an individual is still deserving of blind power, isn’t held to a higher standard, and not accountable due to positional status?

@Vanessa1971 @edgarmglez @Infantry0300 The denial of representation on EVERY level (Electoral College, Federal, Senate, House, etc.) is a disgrace.

@Vanessa1971 @edgarmglez @Infantry0300 I never understood why “taxation without representation” is justified in contemporary politics/affairs.

@Vanessa1971 @EricStuckensch1 Unfortunately, the U.S. treats it's territories like property and not as the equals they should be. The "United" in U.S.A. is a misnomer, which is why lack of statehood is leveraged against territories such as Puerto Rico in favor of profit. Very dispiriting...
