I've done over 500 #WordPress updates in the last few days. no joke.
#igivenofucks fuck this white bitch who gets 911 on Christmas Eve. I got your license plates number...
@cyndilauper last night was a contest to win kinky boots tickets in Chicago. I sang I drove all night. Your music continues to inspire me. https://t.co/ugsYRc24FK not finished but working hard on a cover....
@DanielNewman Like. 100. I saw @RuPaul one year in #boystown #chicago and she was fierce. I watch it every few months. It‚Äôs gotten more sentimental over the years....
@SenFeinstein Don‚Äôt give them anything. Talk to these people on the phone or try to get help. They don‚Äôt even realize who pays them. In-appropriate phone conversations, obstruction of justice, failure to provide services. You should be #auditing these checks how many dead people you paying?
@realDonaldTrump Who‚Äôs paying us? You got so many allies #makethempayforthewall not me. I thought Mexico was going to pay for the wall. That is what you promised and how you got so many votes. #impeach ??? Lying in a presidential vote? @HillaryClinton
@SenJeffMerkley I love the federal holiday. @SpeakerPelosi @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump
@LightfootForChi Take anonymous complaints. How about make people mind their own business. This is the result of an anonymous complaint filed on Christmas Eve. https://t.co/BTSxqvmKBi
@elonmusk @InsideEVs How much for my spaceship? I got to start saving now.
@Bethenny I wish Bethany would call me.... ;-) we could have a good chat &lt;3
@SenatorDurbin @RepUnderwood @RepCasten @RepDannyDavis @CongressmanRaja @janschakowsky @RepBobbyRush @RepBillFoster @RepRobinKelly These checks should be audited. I bet your paying some people who are dead....
@SenFeinstein Has trump ever been an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù business man?
@realDonaldTrump Oh so your agreeing to common sense tactics that were suppose to be done 10 years ago. @BarackObama
RT @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/6xciJ0ubp0
@ChrisVanHollen He finally found his balls!
@nbcchicago This is a racist verdict. Young men who aren‚Äôt even muderes get more jail time Than this. On top of that this is ongoing escalated aggression by van dyke. Hi should have already been terminated before this incident. Again the police win.... @JBPritzker @LightfootForChi
@LightfootForChi Um wow isn‚Äôt that conflict of interest. No alderman should be able to do business like this. #corruption just continues. @ChicagosMayor no conflict of interest issues?
@realDonaldTrump If I‚Äôm going to have to fund your wall we should be able to paint on it and use it as an art space, a few new towns. And an immigration office to help people who are looking for a new home. #allourancestors were immigrants. Don‚Äôt sacrifice our core beliefs. @SpeakerPelosi
@realDonaldTrump You can‚Äôt stop criminals who are legal to live here.... or properly close and detect crimes for the victims of our city @ChicagosMayor maybe @LightfootForChi and @JBPritzker can help convince people to do their jobs...

@LightfootForChi I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt agree. Until the cops stop killing kids on our streets. Or a feminist male can get proper treatment. @ChicagoCAPS19 keep violating constitutional rights. Case after federal case
@SenRonJohnson Don‚Äôt give into trump. Prevent these types of shutdowns from happening in the first place....
@SenatorDurbin Maybe you should focus on the people you represent better. You love the camera more than you help the people who voted for you. #greatpolitics
@SenFeinstein Maybe you should learn to play politics better. Sometimes you have to convince people that what they think is not a reasonable thought. @realDonaldTrump

@nbcchicago Thats lazy you shouldn't be able to enforce two overlapping colored circles as a trademark or patent....  @Mastercard
@JBPritzker what can you do to enforce courts to start following the #LAW I have been going to court for almost 10 years because a landlord violated the law.... Courts don't even hold these landlords accountable for municipal code violations in the hundreds @LightfootForChi
speaking of #misplaced judges @realDonaldTrump should start making the government watch over these local courts who continue to violate our rights.
@LightfootForChi I keep fighting cases at the courthouse because the city doesnt enforce our rights as citizens only as businesses and landlords who continue to violate the law and NO ONE holds them accountable. That is what the cook county courthouse is suppose to do

THe city of Chicago‚Äôs @ChicagoCAPS19 owes me money in damages and constitutional right violations. @LightfootForChi already set for 2019. And there is no accountability for #privileged #whitechicks2 based on real events. Written by Solarbluseth.
Is your website up to date? @Solarbluseth websites in #wordpress are already updated to include new features. Get your 2019 custom business website today.
i was working on some new #wordpress features who would have thought i would involve the @ChicagoCAPS19 #security in this place is lax. Time to #stepmygameup
If i was president i would have a better #hairpiece i thought you were rich already from other peoples hard work. forget the taxes #letsseethescalp @realDonaldTrump the #realyou
@SpeakerPelosi #enactalaw that allows songwriters to maintain copyright status undeniably for time of inception. not waiting 9 months for a copyright baby to be born to only have the federal government not even enforce our rights.  @realDonaldTrump
@automatic @automattic ahhhh T i see what they did there. thanks for the heads up. no need to fill your #timeline with #php #nerdspeak thanks for the heads up.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump #legalizeweed
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump how about you create a bill that allows we the people to overide a veto. Put the power to the people again in a balanced government. This guy doesnt speak for me. I would let everyone in and create a new city. Not a wall. kicking out new tax revenue of people who want to work ?
@cyndilauper we should have open arms for these people struggling to start a new life. #human

@LightfootForChi some businesses are violating their city licenses and paying people under the table $10 or less an hour. And there are many districts and business in #uptown doing this right under the @JamesCappleman nose. the city does not take license complaints seriously...
RT @elonmusk: There are no coincidences https://t.co/9AEbbuXZGn
@elonmusk wow #mindblown @elonmusk
@LightfootForChi I love the fact that you have experience working with the city, other people in local politics and keep these people on their toes. This is what we need in a need #citymayor someone with a high enough IQ to pay attention.....
@JamesCappleman will i finally have a stage for my recital ? The #solarbluseth recital can be a yearly event where solarbluseth can showcase new projects. as a chicago artists I work hard to make chicago #lgbtq proud with my 5 million lines of code and expertise.
@SenatorDurbin we should #egalizeweed @SpeakerPelosi and stop losing money on industries that can thrive under proper guidance. you should enact a law that allows all citizens of a boundary to override a veto of any sitting president, mayor, or governor. there are not enough #checksandbalanes
@SenatorDurbin we should create  a new city and a new port of entry and review all those migrants trying to come into our country with open arms. Make the criminals walk back home. #endofhostage @realDonaldTrump
@ChicagoCAPS19 or trying being #gaybashed the and l#lgbtq community district wont help. https://t.co/RObOgVDjNO continuing to violate my constitutional rights is going to land your district in court again. more members of your district will #poof disappear.

@SenJeffMerkley Yeah taxpayers continue to pay for everything the government wants. The government continues to harass its own people. So tough shit federal employees are not getting paid. #blame @realDonaldTrump

@RepKarenBass Fire some of these incompetent federal employees. Trim the fat. Make Mexico take care of its people.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe Mexico should take responsibility for their own people. This is getting out of hand. Your arrogant ass shut down the government because you don‚Äôt know how to play politics.
@ABC7Chicago Yet no charges have been filed.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump These federal workers give no shits about the American people.

@Montel_Williams @realDonaldTrump Apparently the government shutdown doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt use the airplane? You should be grounded for life.
@PattyMurray Don‚Äôt blame the president blame your constituents
@BarackObama Why aren‚Äôt you running for mayor? The authority in this city is out of control. Listening to music at 10 pm. The cops show up? #chicago #ignorant badges. Federal violations just keep adding up. @JBPritzker
@Tsoukalos I wish the aliens will come back already
@SenFeinstein Maybe you should show more concern for the people who are homeless in our country. Where the people you keep kicking off of welfare.
@SenatorDurbin Maybe you should start revisiting why we have so many employees. Or why a president can shut down the entire country. Most of these federal employees are ignorant. You try calling the IRS for a simple question.
@hitRECordJoe @Madonna was my first and always will be. She helped me through the rain...

@ChicagoCAPS19 someone flatten the tires of all the bikers on Hutchinson. Fun times.... Three offenders seen running from the neighborhood. Even little kids are not safe from these guys...
@JamesCappleman Wow someone put holes in all the bikes on our block. 711 on the corner is now out of business and you cant even get through the crosswalk. #safepassage

@CherylScottWX @cubsweather Bring on the snow.
For example why do the dead need a traffic signal to work 24 hours a day on a busy intersection in the city? I'm talking about clark and irving. Yes thats right the dead need a light While the living continue to sit and wait. #STUPID @JamesCappleman @AldTomTunney @ChicagosMayor
@mashable This is a great idea @JamesCappleman @ChicagosMayor you cant even cross the street where your suppose to be able to. cars dont stop on addison, there are not even signs for half the crosswalks in the city. and lights are not long enough...
@RepKellyCassidy @CNN like these hate crimes in chicago which allows illegals to continue to create crimes and not deport them @ChicagosMayor @JBPritzker https://t.co/RObOgVDjNO this is whats going on in chicago. @realDonaldTrump even the AG wont help
@BrandiGlanville apparently they dont live in a sanctuary city.
@CBSThisMorning He was let go from @apple after their recent update to Mojave and he was "just looking" for a new home. :-P
More #hatecrimes the Justice system fails. @realDonaldTrump make a better hatecrime bill for our #LGBTQ community. https://t.co/RObOgVDjNO https://t.co/yETVVdB7et
@cbschicago How much money has been raised for Laquan's family? How much money this guy is going to get in pensions? his family doesnt need a handout they need a lesson in paying for your mistakes.
@realDonaldTrump legalize it now! ASAP. There are people in chicago suffering and this could reduce crime on the street as bring money into our economy and take it away from the criminals.

@JudicialWatch isnt that called obstruction. and protected by EEOC rules?
If you thought the democrats were unfair to you before wait until we take over the senate and congress. @realDonaldTrump Elections and revenge is only a few votes away. You should be scared. Maybe now youll learn how to be bipartisan. across the board.
@chrisbrown Now thats a hot outfit Chris &lt;3
@SandraBernhard @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner oh yeah ask them if gays are allowed to be there. There are so many countries where we are killed just for being human. I would boycott these countries if i didnt have to use gas...
I am proud to say I lived in a time when we had a president from my city @BarackObama who did so much to help the #LGBTQ community because of him we dont have to hide in the closet anymore, unless you want to be fashionable.... thanks B. #NationalComingOutDay2018

@ChicagosMayor add one thing to the sanctuary city "unless your a criminal" If your trying to have a better life, contribute to society thats great but if your beating up the #LGBTQ community, literally then go back to your country. in handcuffs. @LightfootForChi @JBPritzker @realDonaldTrump
@ChicagosMayor deport the illegals who are criminals at minimum you wonder why there is soooooo much crime..... Simple steps to prevent crime should be taken. @realDonaldTrump there are several complaints the @fbi has now about the #LGBTQ community being accosted by some of these illegals
@ChicagosMayor how about you stop by my house and we can have a real talk about homelessness, gaybashing, police accountability and legalizing weed. @JBPritzker I invite anyone willing to standup. @LightfootForChi  @JamesCappleman bring your friends. Ill always have my #GoPro

Even though we have openly gay alderman like @AldTomTunney and @JamesCappleman who could force the @ChicagoCAPS19 to do the right thing including the @ChicagosMayor  they continue to sweep these crimes under the rug putting our community further at risk
@TheEllenShow @Alyssa_Milano maybe in honor of @MattShepardFDN you could use your platform to bring awareness that law enforcement and the @FBI dont care about the #LGBTQ community and they continue to not solve #hatecrimes https://t.co/RObOgVDjNO  cry...
