Me RN: I feel like I haven't slept in 10 years.
Even if senators feel like the testimony from both witnesses today seem credible, isn't a committee vote on a Supreme Court justice nominee tomorrow morning a little soon? There's so much to this that it's hard to absorb and sift through that quickly.
Asked by the GOP's outside counsel how many beers is too many beers, Kavanaugh says "Whatever the chart says. The blood alcohol chart."
Kavanaugh notes that he didn't list in his calendar for 1982 his time at church. He said that he also didn't brush his teeth and he said going to church was like brushing his teeth.
So Kavanaugh is not using his prepared testimony submitted yesterday. He said he wrote it yesterday afternoon and last night.
