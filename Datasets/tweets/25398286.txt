@MBeienburg Like it or not, changing the requirements from "attend a bad school" to "should attend a bad school, but you already exercise one choice option" is, by definition, *expanding eligibility* to the program.
@MBeienburg and the goal of the program was to allow vouchers for *current* public school students, not those who already attended private schools are were homeschooled.
@MBeienburg And FWIW, I find that argument to be disingenuous, at best. The reason there were different standards for K-eligible and other students was that K-eligible *can't* have possibly attended a district school the prior year...
@MBeienburg That's not wit, it's a genuine question. The program has been in place for years, and the legislation has been crafted by/with GI since the beginning. If the requirements are "inconsistent language," whose fault is that?
I think the best quote @jeremyduda got in this article on the #AZLeg moving to reduce firearms misconduct penalties is this one: "‚ÄúNo rational person believes that it‚Äôs a harm that they‚Äôre in there where they‚Äôre not supposed to be with their gun." https://t.co/REoyuMv520

@AZVotes I think Dem voters want a change, but if you look at who they elected up and down the ticket in AZ this year (especially in primaries), you'll see the change is decidedly NOT older white men (nevermind ones who were recently GOP). It's female, POC and younger.
BLUF: It's unclear who @dougducey will appoint to the #AZSEN seat. Today, CNN says it's likely McSally. Yesterday, WaPo said Ducey had soured on her. Both based on anonymous sources, no doubt two warring camps aiming to influence Ducey.		We'll all just have to wait.

@AndreiCherny @MrJackWHarper @AZredistricting @ccmathis You'll notice how I never actually said that about Ms. Mathis, right?

@AndreiCherny @AZredistricting I'm not making a value judgment on what was done, just merely pointing out that there were A LOT of other ways to add a district to Maricopa County that wouldn't have been conducive to white, urban Democratic candidates.
@MrJackWHarper @AndreiCherny @AZredistricting The IND will always be the swing vote on a 5-member commission. Any political party that doesn't attempt to have a "friendly" person in that role is, frankly, committing malpractice.

@brionneeley Needless to say, if the ballot return margin approaches R+6, that likely spells bad news for more than just Sinema, given recent polling showing tight statewide races in an R+10 environment
@brionneeley I'm not sure if I could pinpoint a specific number around which results will definitely pivot, but I'd say that any turnout at R+9 (or less) is positive for Democrats -- that is nearly 3 points better than the historical midterm average.

RT @CarmenMForman: BREAKING @dougducey placed embattled Parks Director Sue Black on administrative leave today. https://t.co/LxSkL85yah
Sinema is able to be neck-and-neck with McSally, and potentially on a path to victory, because A) she is strong among indies and B) McSally is a bit soft among Republicans, some of whom are gravitating to Sinema. (/end)
In a state like Arizona with such a strong GOP registration advantage, it is tough for any Democrat to win statewide elections.
For fun, I also ran the historical midterm average of R+11.7, which expanded McSally's probable lead, but by no means to a level that would be insurmountable on Election Day.		And it's important to note that there's virtually no way for Republicans to hit that level in 2018. https://t.co/Yz55o40IOR
Under this scenario, using the party split average from those three polls, Republican early ballot turnout will have to grow to R+9.6 for McSally to take a probable lead https://t.co/mGQliwdzgW
If the turnout model goes to R+6, as some Democrats have said they expect, Sinema's probable lead jumps to about 65,000 votes https://t.co/tVkx7rXIdx
If the turnout model shifts to R+7 with 2.25mm votes, Sinema's probable lead grows to 45,000 votes https://t.co/dxrHkBXTna
But what if the trend from this week continues, and Democrats continue to narrow the gap in early ballot returns? The early ballot returns amount to an estimated 60% of expected votes, putting total expected votes at about 2.25mm.
If the polling averages are accurate (and they may not be, due to margins of error!), then the current returns show Sinema likely has a small lead among early voters of about 8500 votes https://t.co/CMr6QUFcmf
At that point, it was a matter of running those support levels against the ballots that have already been processed. (The scenario doesn't include the 0.7% of minor party voters.)
By averaging the party support splits in the 10/31 @FoxNews poll, the 10/29 @azhighground poll and the 10/20 @NBCNews/@maristpoll poll, I set my scenario with these levels of support for each candidate:	-- Sinema: 92%D, 8%R, 50%Oth	-- McSally: 87%R, 4%D, 31%Oth
So, what if you take recent credible polling data and try to extrapolate something from those returns? I went through the crosstabs of 3 of the most recent polls (2 national firms, 1 local) to see how @kyrstensinema and @MarthaMcSally each fared among GOP, Dem and OTH voters.
In recent days, returned ballots have skewed sharply to the Democrats, and the GOP advantage has decreased from more than 11 percentage points to 8.6 percentage points.		The historical average in midterm elections is an advantage of R+11.7 percentage points.
As of today, nearly 1.35mm ballots have been processed by county recorders. Per the figures compiled by the indispensable @Garrett_Archer, the ballots have come from the following voters:	--42.3% GOP	--33.7% DEM	--23.3% OTHER	--0.7% Minor party
Inspired by an analysis I did back in 2011 during the Russell Pearce recall to see how early ballot turnout rates would affect the election when combined with information from polls, I played around today with scenarios for the #AZSEN race (1/)

@FoxNews @kyrstensinema @MarthaMcSally Earlier this month, the same poll had Sinema up 47-45 over McSally. 		Both polls are within the margin of error, and both show the race as a toss-up.

@fryerforarizona Those strategies may not be the reason for their polling differences, either! I'd say an apples-to-apples comparison of whether Dems have a better chance to win in AZ by being centrist or progressive isn't possible, either, given the dramatic gap in funding b/t Sinema &amp; Garcia.
@fryerforarizona Those are the labels the candidates have attached to themselves and their campaigns, and are very definitely the positions and posture each has staked out.
@fryerforarizona That's a good story idea! But it's also not an analysis of polling demographic crosstabs, which is what I wrote in this instance. All detailed public polling has shown the same thing: Sinema is winning support in key blocs that Garcia is not.

@senyorreporter I long ago lost count of how many times a lawmaker's expertise in a field was their basis for cutting against otherwise ideologically held views, as in this case. It's actually a good thing, and in the #azleg, highlights the benefit of a "citizen legislature"

@stephenlemons Rita is her maiden name. She hyphenated after her divorce. I have no clue about their current relationship status.
The ex-girlfriend was a lobbyist. Their relationship was not a secret at the Capitol. As conflicting as it was, everyone in position to say something seemed to turn a blind eye to it.
Here is a screencap of a Facebook post from several years ago by another page that found the AZINews coverage from 2011.		I've redacted the victim's name. https://t.co/xyJt6eJOSd
The story was covered by, as I remember, two outlets that are now both defunct: The Arizona Independent (AZINews) and the Arizona Guardian.
In 2010, an ex-girlfriend got a protective order against him. She accused him of stalking her and sending her compromising photos he took during their relationship.

Worth noting that, as oddly as Legislative District 13 is drawn, it doesn't include the Biltmore area.
In November 2017, the deed was transferred to her, her husband and the family trust. The Shooters then borrowed more than $950K against the house.
Shooter's wife bought a house by herself in the Biltmore area, for $500K cash, in June 2015.
The home was sold to an investor in October, in lieu of a trustee sale https://t.co/isB4GpETtL https://t.co/ahDULZuX2d
In June 2015, the Shooters faced foreclosure on their longtime Yuma home https://t.co/O5w30KK0Rx https://t.co/tPZpNIfltw

@AZs_Politics @barrettmarson @azcentral @politico Sure, the story includes details of skeevy things that happen in and around the Capitol, all in the name of power and policy.

From FY17 to FY18, overall spending increased $208M. Of that, 75% ($157M) was for education. Of *that*, 80% ($128M) was purely a formula increase based on student counts &amp; inflation. You know, statutorily required, not discretionary. https://t.co/zkQFL7JmQ9

@AZs_Politics @azcentral Don't üëè use üëè the üëè quoteüëè
@AZs_Politics @azcentral This is a man who literally set up his business to exploit women, not someone who had no choice.		Allowing someone to brag about using women as sexual props to affect legislation shouldn't pass journalistic muster for anonymity.
@azcentral This isn't a person who is apologetic about how he's run his business, or who understands why this is bad. 		Frankly, it reads like he's *bragging* about how he's figured out how to get results at the #azleg.
@_Stacie_Banks @azcentral For starters, you don't use the quote. And you be careful about granting anonymity when you do interviews. There was no reason to allow it for this quote, and cutting it wouldn't have harmed the story at all.

If I were Mesnard, I'd secretly be hoping that the investigation becomes moot long before Opening Day because Shooter resigned. 		Imagine the questions posed to every female in the building when the media shows up for Day 1 with Shooter still in office. https://t.co/ZkAAj7SneN

@stephenlemons Shooter's been accused of far worse than joking about masturbating, though I feel his time in the barrel isn't yet over. 		All legislators should get scrutiny over their behavior, whether it's interpersonal, business, political, etc.
@PhilRLG @barrettmarson you just need a sense of humour ;)
@stephenlemons That was the rumor we could never prove at the time, and what her ex-hubby asserted in the divorce case. And she's engaged to said staffer now, so...
@stephenlemons She had an affair, so she's fair game for unwanted advances? Or her credibility is bad because her marriage was bad? Not sure I follow.
Functionally, it means nothing, since the #azleg isn't in session. It's rearranging the deck chairs while the investigation occurs. 		And it won't ultimately matter once Shooter resigns, which seems like an inevitability at this point. https://t.co/MCTXY29J2N
@stephenlemons Shooter's allegations about her?

@rickhasen Lots added, FYI. Thanks for the mention
@politico McCain was lucky this was found and seems to have been dealt with. Most people know someone who wasn't so lucky and had a stroke, etc
@politico Doctors don't mess around with blood clots in the brain, as they are deadly.
@politico My guess is he had his exam Friday, was scanned, clot was discovered, and he was sent to emergency surgery.
@politico McCain voted in the Senate Thursday, had craniotomy on Friday: https://t.co/OigdNZs3Ya
@gfallar For instance...
Proof the PR shop won the day: @politico downgrades McCain's *brain surgery* to mere *eye surgery*, as though it was a cosmetic procedure https://t.co/smb0uRwzUJ
But there is little doubt that this operation was much more serious than they are presenting it as.
There is no reason to doubt claims from family, others, that McCain is on the mend and will recover fully.
Symptoms of frontal lobe brain clotting are varied, and include headaches, vision loss, paralysis, cognitive loss, behavior/mood changes.
That means McCain most likely had some symptoms that prompted the scans.
The way to find clots in the brain is with either CT scan or MRI with contrast. Neither are part of a "routine physical."
I'm skeptical this was found in a routine physical, btw. Medical sources say it is extremely unlikely.
@APChristie @AP Why is AP not reporting this as brain surgery?

@sydneemcelroy Wld it be normal to find brain clot in routine annual physical of 80+ y/o? Thx, love the show!
But that's *where* the craniotomy incision was made, *not* where the clot was. It was in his brain.
Those words should be in every lede and headline. Instead, reporters are distracted by "over the left eye."
The most important &amp; seemingly overlooked word in the McCain announcement is "craniotomy." You know, brain surgery.

@katiehobbs Fair point -- ex-contract lobbyist
6/They also have a slew of contradictory explanations of why that is, naturally.
5/Nevermind that the SOS has already sunk $500K into this project &amp; has nothing to show for it but some cool design ideas for the new site.
4/So... Your money will be used to hire more developers, but we don't need it until development milestones are met? Odd.
3/BUT! CCEC isn't expected to pay SOS until deliverables are met and produced... which takes developers, doesn't it?
2/But if they have CCEC money, then they can finish it quicker by hiring more programmers to create the site.
1/I'm utterly confused by the SOS office's request for CCEC money. They claim the money isn't needed, site will be completed anyway
