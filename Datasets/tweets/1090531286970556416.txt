@BernieSanders A lot of this can be attributed to behavioral problems which are made worse by Democratic policies because they incentivize them. I don't want the government this much in my life
@TheDomSirJon @TheRightMelissa @AOC @RashidaTlaib Explain how blacks experience higher rates of economic growth under Jim Crow segregation and government mandated racism than after the welfare expansion in the War on Poverty. How was marriage rates better under slavery for blacks than now, what incentivices this behavior?
@TheDomSirJon @TheRightMelissa @AOC @RashidaTlaib Explain how welfare and the war on poverty don't incentivize the negative behavior which damages the black community. Who gets the most money from the government... Those who make the worst decisions.
@Anaksunaman @TheRightMelissa @AOC @RashidaTlaib There's a reason LBJ said, "I'll have them niggers voting Democrat for 200 years." They had to have something to replace Jim Crow.
@Anaksunaman @TheRightMelissa @AOC @RashidaTlaib Thomas Sowell and Larry Elder are popular thinkers in this area. Some of the primary arguments are the effects the war on poverty had on the black population. Marriage rates, black teen unemployment, the medium wage. All these took a turn for the worst after the war.

@Frankiesports8 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Agreed. This shit show is an embarrassment to our country. This whole presidency has been from both sides. I vote Republican because they best embody my personal values, but they don't make it any easier to vote for them. Democrats straight up scare the shit out of me.
@DafoeDiana @Iamdevinnsmart @BernieSanders So by that logic, should the Republicans have voted against the anti-lynching bill?

@TamerNaguib22 @BernieSanders Why? What's your argument?
@BernieSanders Raising the minimum wage increase unemployment, inproportionately so in minority communities. It kills small business with small profit margins. And it increases the demand, and thus the price of literally everything. Why do we want this?!?! Why is it so great?
@AOC It's not something they want because it increases unemployment. In an age where AI is taking over, it further incentivizes companies move in that direction. It inproportionately affects minorities. It kills small business. We don't want to raise the minimum wage.
@93101Dianne @StarbuckMichael @clhspd @MarkDice @BernieSanders I disagree. I believe in the free market. I believe that tuition is so high because the demand had gone up inproportionately to the supply, thus an increase in pricing. If we as a culture change, and FASFA gets reworked or appealed, the demand, and thus the price will drop.
@JannaLS @TheDemCoalition You're not gonna hear any opposition from me about that. One of the primary reasons why I push for smaller government is because I just don't believe they are competent enough to take on the responsibilities we give them already. Much less so with more power and responsibility.
@JannaLS @TheDemCoalition I've been self-employed for a while so I'm used to receiving little or paying every year. What's your counter argument? Lay it out for me.

@lyndonws @NYDailyNews Open to counter points.
@lyndonws @NYDailyNews https://t.co/5Qoq9TPY8w
@lyndonws @NYDailyNews The FASFA incentive is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be overhauled or repealed. Feel that way for 99% of welfare programs. If you know what's good for you, don't be pushed into destructive behavior because it's incentivized, you're way better off going at it on your own.
@CBRhino @TheDemCoalition They should require students to read Thomas Sowell, "Economic Facts and Fallacies." Will literally make them shit their pants from all the lies.
@NYDailyNews Quick tip for students, you are NOT required to go to school full time (even though FASFA incentivizes it). You are required to take responsibility for your own finances. If you can't go to school full time without borrowing money to survive, drop your hours and work more.

@lexonimous @charliekirk11 is there more than a moral argument against socialistic governments? Why not nationalize all industry?
@lexonimous @charliekirk11 with national rail, this is the first time I'm hearing of it; but, I am curious if you could make the argument that it grew more since it's inception than other privatized railways in Europe. How had quality and size improved? Finally, if the government is so great at business,
@lexonimous @charliekirk11 To save both your time and mine, I'll skip to my point. Private businesses have a strong incitive to grow their business and market. To invest in development and marketing. How does the growth of these nationalized services compare to similar private industries. I'm not familiar
@lexonimous @charliekirk11 Damn, you could have just said USPS or Amtrak. Glad you got an example though. So what makes the Network Rail better than it's predecessors? Why is it of benefit to put that industry in the hands of the government?
@lexonimous @charliekirk11 If you're going to defend the government literally taking over any market, your going to have to provide me with an example in which they did so better than just letting the free market go. I have several counter examples such as the telegram and rent control.
@lexonimous @charliekirk11 I don't see it as denial but faith in the free market. Plastics dropped 40% last year, the solar panel industry is now at a half a trillion dollars.

@EugeneStumpf @GOPchronicle @ewarren Maybe we should max out or credit, and build new banks just to allow us to borrow more money. Yeah, let's do all this while being in the greatest amount of debt a country has ever been in. #GreenNewDeal
@ewarren @SharylAttkisson The only way we get quality and costs is through the free market. The number one way to drastically increase cost, or decrease quality is to put the decision in the have of a third party purchaser, such as the government. In other words, you're only gonna make it worse.
@ewarren There's a reason LBJ said, "I'll have them niggers voting Democrat for 200 years." That's because the Democratic party replaced Jim Crow with welfare programs you wish to expand today. Programs that discourage production and responsibility in minority populations.
@ewarren Perhaps it's cause they issued a bunch of welfare programs that positively enforced negative behavior. Black medium wage was better in the Jim Crow era than just after the war on poverty. Black child bearing outside of wedlock, black teen unemployment rate, etc.

@Babyblack1977 @MatildaSwallows @KamalaHarris I'm pretty sure Trump wouldn't be president if Bernie Sanders didn't scare the shit out of Republicans with his balls to the walls spending plans and Hillary Clinton and her 15 miles of baggage. $11b for a wall is a drop in the bucket compared to the national budget.
@Babyblack1977 @MatildaSwallows @KamalaHarris $11b is a drop in the bucket compared to the federal budget, why are you against this if it decreases our expenses, raises wages, and drives down crime even marginally?
@Babyblack1977 @MatildaSwallows @KamalaHarris Crime is a consequence of population, I think we can all accept this.

@sohlemac @ewarren We're also the country with the highest amount of debt of all time. I'm not gonna support anything like the Green New Deal, which suggests we create new banks to loan us the money to enact these socialistic policies. All I'm asking is for a little fiscal responsibility
@jakeyvol @TheJerryPi @AOC @paulkrugman Which is why I'm skeptical about all politicians, especially the DNC touting looks their just gonna ride in and save the day with socialist policies that aren't really "socialist." I'm just anxious to see the details behind their magnificent new programs.
@jakeyvol @TheJerryPi @AOC @paulkrugman Why do you think I'm ok with the tax cuts it increase in military spending? Is asking for fiscal responsibility not moral anymore? Or am I a racist now?

@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN It was in the late 60's that the way on poverty began. There's a reason why LBJ said, "I'll have them niggers voting Democrat for 200 years." Many welfare reforms we're enacted during this way on poverty.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN Jim Crow was from the late 1800's until the civil Rights movement in the 1960's. Looking at the trend line I've provided under my sources, yes, this is the case.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN I'm not following your line of reasoning.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN How else do you explain the fact that the median income for African Americans more rose under Jim Crow than with civil rights and welfare policies?

@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN Many welfare programs encourage negative productivity and single parenthood among African Americans. The effect of this is evident in the single parenthood rates and the median income of blacks after the major welfare reform push known as the "War on Poverty" in the mid 60's.

@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN Yes I'm impatient, you have yet to present a counter argument to the assertion that many of the policies asserted by the DNC has historically and currently harmed (not helped) the black population. It's going in two days dude, get to the point already.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN Now should I go in a complete circle and redescribe many of these policies as I've done earlier? Perhaps in more detail with evidence, for that has been done extensively by the people I've referenced.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN You can split this apart six ways to Sunday, but many DNC policies have evidence that contradicts the states intention. I don't care what label you put on the people behind those policies, but the policies are still in effect and are still supported. I'm going in circles now.
@sjcarjo1 @JerkSmirking @CNN Yes I generalized, but that's what we do when we have a collection of individuals. I'm talking about policy passed and supported by the collection of "Democrats" who call themselves the DNC. I'm not seeing how the philosophies and definitions of government connect to the argument

@lilsadboi2002 @nytimes Polarization in action. One side completely agrees with something without doubt or evidence simply because the other side believes the opposite. Also without doubt and evidence. Can we step away from the narrative and look at this stuff for what it is?
@BuntyKritty @AdamAtUBC @nytimes First present evidence.
@clydeleesmith @YourNeighbor57 @laware75 @nytimes So you're solution is that we polarize more and present even more radical political policies? Jesus, can we start debating idea and principals instead of holding a national popularity contest every 2 years?

Trump the show is the best damn piece of entertainment in my life. It broadcasts everyday, in multiple languages (CNN, fox, MSNBC, @realDonaldTrump), and never lets me down.

@Dink_Derenik @blue_man_chu @DonnaNoble10th @SenWarren @ewarren How about the money he reinvested in the economy? Should we take that out of the market and put it towards welfare? We adhere to the free market for a reason. Just say it, you're jealous.

@missyslaymaker @DylanRoper1 @timtime2 @juebecker @blue_man_chu Then make a company and do that. It's America, the land of the free for a reason. You have the right to give, provide, and serve. They have the right to decide how much to pay employees. That's the free market, the reason why this country is wealthy to begin with.
@missyslaymaker @tbonetokar @juebecker @blue_man_chu So you never heard of investing and inflation?
@ArkayEvans @missyslaymaker @juebecker @blue_man_chu Explain how this isn't a product of the free market. If you can do that, then explain why the free market is do bad if it allowed us to have the top GDP on the world, as well as being the number one way to reduce poverty in the world.
@facialmerkin @missyslaymaker @juebecker @blue_man_chu If you define hoarding as keeping all of the money stashed away in some bank account then you need to reeducate yourself. It's invested back into the economy to outpace inflation. We have the top GDP of the world for a reason.
@blue_man_chu @LunaLuvgood2017 Jesus Christ, have you ever even looked at a finance book. The capital is invested to outpace inflation by investing it in other businesses, this back into the economy. This is why we America has top GDP people, go back to school.
@_Ben_in_space @missyslaymaker @juebecker @blue_man_chu Jesus Christ, it's investing 101. Keeping all your cash in a bank account is the worst thing you can do with your money, it's called inflation people. Instead it's invested back into the company, and thus the American economy.

@plplewis200 @RyanAFournier Interesting how this survey illustrates the whole point of this thread. There's no way this poll wouldn't be radically different under a majority liberal thread.

@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews Welfare state is one that has bore no fruit so far. The conservative principles of personal responsibility and capitalism has. The free market had been proven to bring wealth to impoverished nation's, while welfare had brought many to destitute. Tell me why I should support
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews You're making my point for me. Why support Democrats and social welfare programs when they haven't done so little positive and do much negative to our community? Look here, I DETEST the majority of the GOP. But, the philosophy of taking more money from the rich to expand our

@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews Yes, many single mothers go to college. But, one of the biggest indicators of poverty is out of wedlock births. I'm not saying single mom's are bad. Hell I'm a product of a single mom and an absent dad. I'm constantly in awe of the strength of my mother.

@DiamondandSilk If you really want to hurt African Americans, vote Democrat. They got 200 years experience and going towards oppressing black ppl.
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews Economic growth of African Americans, but not the other races? You keep rushing towards ill intent, acting like I or any normal person is calling for blacks to be oppressed. You need to chill the fuck out and respect the dialog between us for both of us might learn something
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews No Jim Crow was not an economic policy, but we're is, and it had affected the black population, specifically the marriage rate. Why is that important? Because having children out of wedlock is the surest path to poverty. So what specific forces, laws, or programs have stunted the
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews And why is the medium wage is African Americans lowest among all races besides native Americans? What is stopping them from succeeding outside of social welfare programs? Is it the culture? Is it the white man putting us down? If so, then how, be specific.
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews That doesn't explain the rise in marriage rate, the spike in the unemployment rate after minimum wage, or why those rates are still high as hell today. What system if oppression is stopping blacks from having children out of wedlock or dropping out of high school?
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews And.....
@NBCNews Talk about a shit day. Just chilling, on your phone tweeting. Then next thing you know your house falls apart from under you and you're buried in mud. I'm glad I live on a hill because the thought of it scares the heck outta me.
@AlphaLackey @unc0mm0n1 @RobMaury @RealSaavedra To think hope much I've changed over the last ten years. Making mistakes and fixing them is how we define being a human, and should unite us through commonality. It's sick how we nitpick through people's lives and pile a bunch of crap into them in the name of some ultimate good.
@ramey_deb @noonanjo That's what we get for watching the news. It's all about the narrative, and pro life is defiantly not the narrative.
@otohp @CBSNews Really... You gonna blame the sun setting every evening in him too? What about the cold weather, is that God telling us how bad Trump is?
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews I do concede to the fact I wasn't specific when I said blacks did better under Jim Crow. I was thinking in purely economic terms. Yes Jim crow was bad and we all want it gone. So why did African Americans do better economically under Jim Crow than under social welfare?
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews You're the one bringing weak counter arguments and now resorting to deflecting over dialog
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews I'm here supporting systematic racism and am discouraging it. Prove to me these Democratic policies you support are policies are not racist at their core. Prove to me why I should stop seeing myself as a black conservative and why I should fall back in with my race.
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews I'm not supporting Jim Crow nor do I desire it. I'm saying that several Democratic policies which we still support did this to the black population. And looking at the Democratic politicians at that time, I highly suspect the effects were purposely created out of racism.
If a Democratic candidate came out and said: "you know, I didnt think Trump was that bad." They would either win by a complete landslide, or be stoned to death on the steps of Congress.
@williamlegate @ListenToEzra What color is your dog? Don't be bringing in no funky ass poodle, we had enough of their racist bullshit.
@BoogerCory @NBCNews These are the presidential candidate for the Democratic party....? Anybody else still wondering how Trump became president in the first place?

@ProudResister @RalphNortham Look here it's bad..., but the idea that we should destroy careers and lives over past mistakes is absolutely fucking insane. This is coming from a black Republican. If he's been doing a good job, then I think he should keep it. End. Of. Story.
@AndyZerkel @washingtonpost 1/1024 Native American. If you want to call her Native American, then that's your business.
@krittercrews @washingtonpost She straight up lied about her heritage so she can claim minority status as a native American, that's so what. This is a perfect case of the nonsensical identity politics taking place in the Democratic party. I damn near shit myself cause I laughed so hard when the test came in
@SaraCarterDC All Republicans aren't racist, but all racists are Republicans........ Bwahahahaha https://t.co/ktF8oCJ65J
@RealSaavedra @RalphNortham How would any interaction from him help his case at all? Have you not seen what happened to the kids at Cumberland high school? Them saying their side of the story only made things worse for them. There's no talking your way out of it once your convicted by social media.
@Rancidsmallbus There's a reason why I lean toward conservative principals even though I hate the majority of the GOP. But at least they don't scare the living shit out of me with their policies. Hence...MAGA
@Rancidsmallbus Because I like what I said. I'm not seeing your point
@krassenstein Welfare and the Democratic party has destroyed the African American community. These are policies enacted by racists which are still in effect and are still supported by Democrats today. There, got that of my chest.
@Rancidsmallbus Can someone please explain to me why we should support programs implemented by actual real racists in the Democratic party that has shown to impact the African American community negatively since it was implemented?
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews That doesn't explain why the marriage rate plummeted and single parenting skyrocketed. Yes it went up some for all races, but it jumped from 20% to 70% for blacks. How did tax breaks for the rich rip apart the African American family?
@Rancidsmallbus I'm not suppprting Jim Crow. Just saying the Democratic party doesn't contain all your hopes and dreams. Yes I know Jim Crow was bad and we shouldn't have it. Stop assuming the worst of people and discuss.

@Resisto18504954 @CBSNews @Rancidsmallbus Here go some reading material 		https://t.co/QUEE6BXKrR		https://t.co/TkqdkpqbTq
@Rancidsmallbus @Resisto18504954 @CBSNews If you got something to say then say it. Either dispute, or shut up
@Resisto18504954 @CBSNews @Rancidsmallbus Then educate me. Tell me how the African American community is doing so much better with social services and affirmative action? Either that or just call me racist and move on like the rest of them.
@Resisto18504954 @Rancidsmallbus @CBSNews So argue differently. Explain to me what the median household income for African Americans grew under Jim Crow but stagnated after social services. Explain to me why single parenting in the black community shot up since the 60s and never recovered.
@bi_and_mediocre @jsaxonred @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump You're not going to convince me there isn't a shitload of illegals in this country because I can see it. But we can't begin to deal with that problem or any other connected to it without securing our borders. This isn't an end game strategy but a first step of many.
@bi_and_mediocre @jsaxonred @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump What will happen if we start kicking the illegals out to help pay for our social programs, do you think they won't simply walk back and continue taking advantage of them? What happens if we create even more welfare programs, would they simply stop coming?
@sarekins @CBSNews Yes we can find people who can do it better, and we should, and I'll support them. But it's not Schumer, Kamala, Warren, or Pelosi. I am convinced their policies will run is into the ground, just out of sheer financial reasoning.
@sarekins @CBSNews I do care about a lot of his moral inadequacies, hell I didn't vote for neither him or Hillary because of it. But he has earned my support in the last couple years. When you take away the narrative and look at the facts, he hasn't been doing that bad of a job.
@bi_and_mediocre @jsaxonred @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump So we do nothing? What do we do? The problem is there. If you think drones in the sky is going to do anything but let us watch them walk across, you're fooling yourself.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Tells you how much of a leader he is. People are actually following him, even with the bullshit. I think that says a lot about him and his opponents. Dems need to change their rhetoric or lose their base
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump GOOGLE IT!!!
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Please stop back from the edge miss. There's terrible ideas and people on both sides. Problem with the media and tv is that we only see the extremes. The left has good ideas as does the right. This sorry if rhetoric is the reason why politics is being split at the seams
@MeghanS71060672 @realDonaldTrump He learned it from Clinton.
@prosehaikus @benshapiro I bet the bill smelled of sulfur when they signed it.
@sarekins @CBSNews If it's that or allowing mother's to kill babies all the way up to death or implementing a crappy of new social welfare programs without a well thought out economic infrastructure. I'll damn near take Satan than another Democrat
@Resisto18504954 @CBSNews And I believe if you really want to be racist and cause an immense amount of damage to the black community, then vote Democrat. There's a reason black people did better under Jim Crow than with social welfare programs, ask Thomas Sowell or Larry Elder.
@st_thecla30 @brent_rauch @realannapaulina @RyanAFournier Your not gonna get both in government. There's a reason why the system is constantly muddled and bogged down, because it affects more than 350 million people. Of course that assumes are leaders are actually able to fucking talk to each other and compromise when necessary.
@RandyMcVean1 @KamalaHarris Love doesn't fit the narrative
@JoeKov @KamalaHarris You can't expect her to know that. Wasn't like she was an attorney or anything.
@realannapaulina @RyanAFournier I don't think anybody is disagreeing with you. The big question is how? What are we doing that we should double down on and what more should we be doing. I ideas sounds great, but we need more than ideas.
@MeghanS71060672 @ProudResister @PressSec I'm not blaming the pastor for him not being Cristian. Just bringing light to the fact that the pastor is out here taking about his constituents in public.
