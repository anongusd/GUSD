"If there's two things I know, it's women and exactly what's going to happen in the future."
"We are deeply distressed that the president's attention has landed on this issue, even if momentarily, but we remain hopeful that he will soon be distracted by something, anything, else."
"We are glad that this important national issue has the president's attention" is a hell of a statement to make in 2019. Whatever the subject. https://t.co/1iNffHdGx7

As I say above, though, to my ear this was generally a thoughtful and sympathetic statement.
To put it another way, even a supportive reference to the feelings of American Jews about Israel is going to reinforce stereotypes if its framing oversimplifies what those feelings are.
@miri_iron Absolutely. That leaped out for me in Corbyn's reference to "English irony," too.
The complexity of American Jewish opinion on the state of Israel and Palestinian rights is missing from Omar's comments. I don't think there was malign intent in that flattening, but the flattening is there.
There's no nod in the clip above to American Jewish activism around Palestinian rights, and I think that's an unfortunate omission. Jewishness leads many American Jews to be more sensitive to Palestinian rights than they would otherwise be, not less, and that's important to say.

@andrea_wolfson @LOLGOP I don't think the claim that AIPAC is pro-Israel trades in antisemitic tropes.
There are moments in the speech where she uses phrasing that I wouldn't, but to suggest that she's saying that grassroots concern on the part American Jews for the Jews of Israel is a matter of improper dual allegiance is false. She comes far closer to saying the opposite.
When she talks about "allegiance," she specifically, explicitly frames it as a statement about pro-Israel lobbyists, not about American Jews at the grassroots.
She goes on to say, though, that a concern for the suffering of Jews in Israel—which again, she doesn't deny the legitimacy of—has to be joined with a concern for the suffering of Palestinians.
Omar says here that feeling a bond as an American Jew with the people of Israel is legitimate and understandable, and in fact she analogizes it directly to her own children's sense of connection with Somalia.
FWIW, I also mostly disagree with Chait on the merits of his criticism, having watched the clip in question. https://t.co/oVSvUaDYgi

@johnshaplin There's no constitutional barrier to altering the electoral college. Depriving states of their equal vote in the senate is banned by Article V.
@silhoue77277930 Two presidential elections in the last five violating the expressed will of the people to no discernible purpose strikes me as a bug rather than a feature. But go ahead.
"White House and security clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushner’s security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone. That was conveyed to the media at the time, and new stories, if accurate, do not change what was affirmed at the time.”

@dash_kensington ND doesn't get its power in the federal govt from the EC, where its votes are taken for granted. It gets its power from the SENATE.
@dash_kensington You made a specific claim that was incorrect.
@dash_kensington If you're a swing voter from North Dakota, you WANT the national popular vote. As it is now, neither party cares how you vote, because your state's EVs are locked in.
@dash_kensington Two things. One, we are a democracy. We're also a republic. A republic is a kind of democracy. And two, the electoral college doesn't enhance the power of voters from ND—it lessens it. ND is a solid red state, so presidential candidates either write it off or take it for granted.
@dash_kensington Tell it to LePage. Also, a vote is a vote no matter where it is. You get more votes than the other person, you win the election. That's democracy.

@richardbackes What would change is that while currently campaigns concentrate on fewer than a dozen swing states, under a popular vote system they'd be chasing centrist, persuadable, and mobilizeable voters, wherever those voters lived.
@richardbackes Also, the electoral college does the opposite of keeping all states relevant. Swing voters in states that are heavily Democratic or Republican get LESS attention in the electoral college system than they would under a popular vote.
@richardbackes California and New York have a combined 14.8% of the population of the United States. So ... no.

@Prince_Kropotkn @CoreyRobin I said just a couple of days ago, just as an example, that if he loses next year I expect him to claim that the election was stolen. That's a falsifiable prediction connected to his weakening of democratic institutions, and it's not an outlier among his critics' statements.
@Prince_Kropotkn @CoreyRobin The "radicalizing the right" part is reflected in hate crimes, political violence, the rise of extremism, threats against Dem politicians, all of which are quantifiable. "Weakening democratic institutions" is a longer-term thing, but still falsifiable.
@CoreyRobin I don't see a lot of people on the left worrying that Trump is winning the center. What I DO see is a lot of fear that he's (1) radicalizing the right and (2) weakening democratic institutions.
@halaljew @DavidKlion @bfkelleher "It's a travesty that this clown show is going on while" is a comment on (1) the merits of the hearing itself and (2) the timing of the hearing, not (3) the amount of press attention the hearing is receiving.
@CoreyRobin Which brings us back to where we started—my suggestion that Trump's rhetoric is simultaneously having a corrosive effect on his supporters and also pushing moderates to the left.
@CoreyRobin Or we could say "there's plenty of evidence that his rhetoric has been corrosive in other areas, and good polling on affirmative action isn't evidence his rhetoric ISN'T corrosive in that area," which is where I land.
@CoreyRobin Well, I think it's easy to imagine that Trump is radicalizing his supporters in ways that won't be obvious from polling. "I oppose affirmative action" and "I oppose affirmative action and I'm eager to be an asshole about it to strangers on the street" look similar in polls.
@CoreyRobin Isn't it possible that Trump's rhetoric is simultaneously having a corrosive effect on his supporters and also pushing moderates to the left?

@sukatra @TCFKA_NCSteve I don't agree with your claims of ageism and sexism in this specific instance, but I recognize that I have blindspots on those kinds of questions, so I'm keeping an open mind and not pushing back. You may be right. I may be wrong.
@sukatra @TCFKA_NCSteve As for hills and me dying, my view is that pushing Dem leaders to the left on climate is a matter of life and death, AND that maintaining coalition between liberals and leftists is going to be essential in coming years. So I'm trying to bridge that gap through dialogue today.
@sukatra @TCFKA_NCSteve You don't need to take my word for it—the exchange begins at 1:15 in the embedded video. https://t.co/OS060xtPjq
@sukatra @TCFKA_NCSteve That full exchange was in the edited video. The 16-year-old says "we're the people who voted you" in the edited version, and Feinstein says "how old are you?"
@miri_iron @TCFKA_NCSteve Have any of the families said that?
@miri_iron @PJLM We'll have a stronger sense in a few years whether this general approach was a good one, but my guess is there won't be anything approaching a consensus even then.
@miri_iron @PJLM ...I'd say it's far too soon to tell whether yesterday's action was a productive one. It'll have been productive if it, along with similar actions, pushes MOCs like Feinstein to take a more aggressive climate change stance than they would have absent such pressure.
@miri_iron @PJLM I'm not saying the video was a success, or even that it was tactically wise. I was responding to one specific criticism of its target choice. But since you ask...
@TCFKA_NCSteve Again, I'm just asking for an example. I'm asking that you provide a clear, specific, verifiable, falsifiable example of deceptiveness. That's all I'm asking for. There's no need for all this speechifying.
@TCFKA_NCSteve I've now asked you multiple times to give me a specific example of this malfeasance. If you're not going to provide one, let's just drop it.
@PJLM Putting pressure on elected officials by confronting them in public isn't exactly a new or unusual tactic. Sometimes it's effective, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes you make people vote with you by making them like you. Sometimes you do it by making them fear you.
@TCFKA_NCSteve I asked you to give me a specific example of a way in which you considered the editing so deceptive as to rise to the level of a lie. If you don't want to, that's fine. But I figured you might want to.
@TCFKA_NCSteve Identify one lie. Not something that you think should have been included, a lie. You said they lied. How did they lie?
Just saying that if it doesn’t seem like the activists you’re observing have a plan, consider the possibility that it’s you, not them, who doesn’t know what their plan is.
Which isn’t to say that we shouldn’t criticize, or even that a bad unintended X outcome can’t outweigh the hoped-for Y “victory.”
“They were trying to do X but it backfired!” isn’t a productive critique if the goal wasn’t X but Y.
When someone mounts an action that confuses or repels me, I try not to assume that I know what they were trying to achieve and how.
Most of us are walking around with a lot of unexpressed, often unexamined, assumptions about how political change happens and how activists can affect the process.
@PJLM Feinstein is in a deep blue state, just won re-election, and likely isn’t running again. If you’re going to publicly drag someone and don’t want to lower the chances of retaking the senate, isn’t she the tactically perfect choice?
Just a quick PS: We’ll get along better if you don’t start from the premise that I’m stupid or ignorant. I may well be, but leading with it doesn’t move us forward.
@PJLM If we're going to take aggressive action on climate in congress in the next few years, three things need to happen. (1) Dems win presidency in 2020, (2) Dems win Senate in 2020, (3) mainstream Dems move left on climate. Yesterday was about pushing for (3).
We don't have to be teammates to work together, and we don't have to declare ourselves to be enemies every time we find each other on opposing sides.
BTW, plenty of people I like and respect and regard as political allies disagree with me about yesterday's action and the video it produced. I don't like or respect them any less than I did yesterday.
@DawgsWillHunt You treated it as a given that yesterday harmed the prospects of the GND. I said I didn't agree that it's a given. How is that dismissive?
@DawgsWillHunt Aggressively assuming ignorance on the part of the person you're talking to is rarely conducive to productive conversation.
@DawgsWillHunt I don't have the time to get into a big strategy/tactics discussion right now, but I will say that my hunches as to the Sunrise Mvt's thinking on this action are not the same as yours.
@DawgsWillHunt That the answer is no is not as obvious to me as it is to you.
We can argue about whether this specific video was fair or unfair, productive or unproductive. But the view that Feinstein and the Sunrise Movement are adversaries—rather than teammates, allies, or enemies—strikes me as obviously reasonable and correct.

@PJLM One tweet ahead of you. I think it's reasonable for advocates of strong action on climate change to see Feinstein as an adversary, not an ally.
To go back to the situation at hand, Feinstein's supporters are mostly arguing that Feinstein is an ally of climate change activists, who are treating her as an enemy. The opposing view would be that on this issue they're adversaries, and acting like adversaries.
So you can see, given the above, why I said at the top of the thread that "We're all on the same team, but you're trying to bring us down so you're my enemy" is so discombobulating to me.
If we're enemies, then our interests are fundamentally opposed. A win for me is a loss for you, and vice versa. For me to succeed, you have to fail. I'm not trying to convince you, or convert you. I'm trying to defeat you or immobilize you.
If we're adversaries, then on a specific issue, today, we're diverging on goals or strategy or tactics or all three. I'm trying to move you off your current position, or you to move me off mine, or both. We may be friendly or not, work together on other projects or not.
If we're allied to each other—in the sense in which I'm using the term here—we're on different teams, but our teams are working together on a particular project. We may be on opposite sides of a different issue, or diverge on this issue tomorrow, but today we're working together.
If you're my teammate, you and I are engaged in a common project, working together. You regard me as being on your team, I regard you as being on mine, and we've chosen to act in concert in support of common goals, supporting each others' work on an ongoing, open-ended basis.
Gonna say a little bit more here about adversaries and allies and enemies and teammates, and how I'm using these terms.
@JustTheFacts37 Deceptive and unrepresentative are two different things. And I've explained why I don't see this video as having anything in common with PV.
@PikeBot @sukatra In my view, the Pelosi sit-in did a huge amount to raise the profile of the GND, and of advocates for dramatic action on climate change more generally. I'd call that a success, and the opposite of pointless. But opinions will differ.
@JustTheFacts37 I don’t believe the editing was deceptive. Selective, yes. Deceptive, no.
@NR_Garrett I’m saying we can work together even if we’re not teammates, and you’re telling me to GTFOH. Remind me which of us is the splitter again?
@JustTheFacts37 I don’t agree with your assessment of their tactics.
@Tzipshmil Who said it’s more important to move the party left than to beat Trump? Not me, for sure.
@Tzipshmil Weird that I spent all that time door-knocking for Hillary Clinton, given my views.

@sukatra They are doing it to male senior Democrats, though. They've done multiple actions at Chuck Schumer's offices, for instance.
@FeralHomemaking I think it’s too early to tell. The effect of this kind of tactic is cumulative, not individual.
If you're a Democrat who disagrees with that, you may not be my enemy, but you are my adversary. We are not, in any simple straightforward way, "on the same team." We may be able to work together, and we may be allied on all sorts of things, but we're not teammates.
@debunkdenialism Necessary but not sufficient.
My view is that—in the most optimistic possible reading of current conditions—moving the Democratic Party dramatically left on climate change is an urgent, maybe existential, project.
Some people believe that kicking out Trump and putting Dems in will on its own be more or less sufficient to bring about the changes on climate that we need. That's not a belief that Sunrise shares, or that I share.
@NR_Garrett My view is that moving the Democratic Party dramatically left on climate change is absolutely urgent and essential, and that pressuring senior Democrats is going to have to be a part of that process.
@FeralHomemaking My view is that the Democratic Party needs to move dramatically left on climate change, and that pressuring senior Democrats is going to have to be a part of that process.
@sukatra I think the Democratic Party needs to move dramatically left on climate change, and that pressuring senior Democrats is going to have to be a part of that process.
"They picked out the parts that were the strongest for their argument and edited out the other parts" isn't a claim of ethical malfeasance. That's literally how every adversarial political video works, and has ever worked, and will ever work.
Getting a bit of "it doesn't matter if they used O'Keefe's tactics" pushback. No. Attempting to portray your adversaries in a bad light is universal in politics. Universal. What matters is the tactics you use, and the ethical constraints you abide by.
"We're all on the same team, but you're trying to bring us down so you're my enemy" is a hypnotically self-refuting claim.

@NR_Garrett By that standard, every political ad ever filmed—for instance—was "O'Keefian."
O'Keefe tapes people without their knowledge, he lies about who he is, he uses deception to attempt to goad them into violating the law or their ethical obligations, and then when they don't, he deceptively edits the tape to make it look like they did. There's none of that here.
"Cherry-picking video highlights" isn't what O'Keefe does. It's what ESPN does. What O'Keefe does is fundamentally different.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 He tapes people without their knowledge, he lies about who he is, he uses deception to attempt to trick them into violating the law or their ethical obligations, and then if they DON'T commit such violations, he deceptively edits the tape to make it look like they did.
As @banditelli notes, James O'Keefe doesn't freaking livestream his hits, whereas here there was full and open disclosure throughout.
@banditelli I've seen several people say it who clearly just have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
I've seen a number of people suggest that last night's Feinstein video was akin to O'Keefe's work. No. Ew. No comparison. Even if you disagree with how the Feinstein vid was edited, they're fundamentally different things. Entirely different.
James O'Keefe's videos aren't about editing openly shot video of electeds' meetings with constituents to highlight the worst parts. They're about secretly, maliciously recording private citizens, lying about what they say, and trying to destroy their lives and livelihoods.
@reading1960 I have no idea what you're trying to say. The mom in the story behaved badly in the story, and I blame her for behaving badly. Why would I be joking about that, and why wouldn't I blame her for her actions?
Seems weird that I have to say this, but when I say "I don't blame the kid in this story...I blame the mom," what I mean is that I blame the mom in this story. This specific story, the one I link to at the top of the thread. The one I'm discussing in the thread.
@reading1960 Did you read the thread I was discussing? It describes an incident in which a mom, a child, and a babysitter appear. There's no dad in the story. We don't even know if the kid has a dad. When I say "I blame the mom," I mean I blame THE MOM IN THE STORY I'M DISCUSSING.
@beagewill The mom appears in the story, so I can judge her behavior as described. I have no idea whether there even IS a dad.
And no, I don't blame the kid in this story. Kids say stuff. Kids think stuff. Kids do stuff. I don't blame the kid. I blame the mom.
Ideally, you want to explain racism to your kids BEFORE they say racist stuff to their babysitter. But if you don't manage that, WHEN they say racist crap to their babysitter is the time to do it.

@ScottMadin This isn't just about how she, as an individual senator votes in three years—it's about what the legislation winds up looking like when it comes time for her to vote for it. The more outrage and anger is expressed now, the better the bill will be in 2021.
@ScottMadin I think senators' views on climate legislation matter, and that when senators say stupid shit about climate policy they should get heat for it.

@familyunequal @ScottMadin I'm not outraged, I'm pissed off. She's opposing real action on climate change, and she's defending that decision in an obnoxious and ham-handed way. Why shouldn't she take heat for both halves of that?

Oh, and since it's come up: It's not an "abuse" of parental leave policies to quit after your leave ends. If you've earned the leave, you can do whatever you want after it ends.
So apparently now we're going to get a bunch of serious journalistic research on congressional staff parental leave policies. Cool. (The media is so weird.)

@JoshBrandfon Great to meet you too! I had a lovely time.

@eastsidekate There's a lot of variation, sure, and I'm not an expert in the field. It's possible I'm wrong. But I've looked into this a fair amount in the past, and my strong impression is that the clawback stuff is unusual for this kind of a workplace.
@AntoniaEliason @satmandu Yeah, and that's the case even if it were applied evenly. You can't ban cursing on signs at a public protest.
@SarahGrynpas This thread isn't primarily about whether she's a bad boss on an interpersonal level—it's about her parental leave policies.
Parental leave in professional workplaces is typically something you accrue, not something you borrow from your future self. The Times is correct to say that Klobuchar's policy, as described, is non-standard.
Second, and more specifically, no—demanding triple time back at work after new parent leave isn't standard, and threatening to claw back leave pay definitely isn't.
What policies you set in the workplace you control tells us about the policies you'll try to implement more broadly, as well as telling us what kind of a White House you'll run. And if you don't know to get this stuff squared away before you announce, that is itself telling.
First, it's definitely worth asking and discussing what typical Congressional parental leave policies are, and I hope this piece prompts that discussion. But it's also entirely reasonable to expect and demand that Dem presidential candidates be leaders on this kind of thing.

@RadicalGoats I hear you, and it's possible that if I watched it happen I'd agree with you.
@lindaholmes Yes! (My favorites are the "this is absolutely not a thing but still sick" ones.)
@Shmaesh No, and as I said two tweets down in the thread to which you responded, I take those other reports seriously.
@RadicalGoats If she'd eaten the salad with a pair of chopsticks she found in her purse, then told the staffer to clean the chopsticks, I don't think the story would have made the article.
@mr_bellis Parental leave is taken disproportionately by women, and bad parental leave policies harm women disproportionately. I said what I said on purpose.
@RadicalGoats That's my impression. But the comb story doesn't add substantively to that argument.
I'm troubled by the accounts of Klobuchar being a jerk to her staff, but the comb story isn't even that. It says that on one occasion eleven years ago she "berated" a staffer who screwed up. Without the salad comb, the anecdote doesn't make the article.
@Shmaesh There is one sentence in the comb anecdote about how she addressed the staffer who screwed up, and it doesn't say she screamed. It says she berated him, which is a term that could refer to all sorts of behavior, much of it benign.
If Klobuchar implemented non-standard, idiosyncratic, punitive parental leave policies in her senate office, that tells me a lot about her approach to labor justice. The other story just tells me that if I lend her a comb I should let her keep it.
The comb story is a "Klobuchar is a weird lady" story. The parental leave story is a "Klobuchar is a bad boss to young women" story. I don't care about the comb story. https://t.co/qypybZpiWn
@chrislhayes @CoreyRobin There's also a huge gap right now between "what needs to be done tomorrow" and "what we can imagine actually implementing tomorrow," and trying to close that gap by nudging public policy incrementally in the right direction isn't self-evidently a bad idea.

@CamilleLoftus Okay, if I'm wrong, let's approach it from the opposite direction: Can you identify some specific circumstances in which you'd be in favor of allowing trans women to participate in women's sports?
@CamilleLoftus But it definitely sounds like your default is "exclude trans women from all women's sports," even if there might be theoretical exceptions. And that's exactly the default position that I was saying that most people on your side of the aisle are taking.
@CamilleLoftus Okay. So given all that, when I asked you two hours ago whether you were saying that trans women should face a blanket ban from women's sports, why did you refuse to answer? A simple "yes" would have saved us a bunch of time.
@CamilleLoftus It sounds like you're saying that transgender women have an innate advantage over cisgender women in athletics, one that renders competition between trans and cis women in sports inherently unfair. Is that accurate?
@CamilleLoftus I don't know what "compete against their physical equals" means. Most athletic competition—virtually all, if you cut it fine enough—involves competition among people who differ in physical strength, size, agility, etc.

@pointblaek "My opinions about anybody else's opinions on the 2020 primaries" is stuff like "you're bad to hate/love this candidate and you should feel bad," not "I'm glad to see people on all sides of this issue behaving congenially."

And yes, it's a tiny and unrepresentative sample size, but I take heart from the fact that—on my tiny timeline at least—a lot of people on both sides of the Bernie divide woke up going "AAAAAAH!" but then smoothed down their shirts and got in the shower.

"That framing feels really aggressive to me. Can we try to dial it back a bit?" The person who replies with "yeah, sure, sorry, let me try again" is worth continuing to talk to. The person who replies the other way probably isn't, and may be worth blocking.
@sweatingbanshee Also, a lot of folks these days take the toxicity of online spaces as a given—frequently they don't feel the need to offer examples.
@sweatingbanshee Sure. But if I have a rep for interacting aggressively with people online, the responses to even my seemingly innocuous utterances are going to be shaped by that.
This is definitely a real thing. I've taken to telling people when the way they're interacting with me online strikes me as overly aggressive—often they're shocked to hear it. And the way they react when I say it tells me a lot about the conversation's prospects. https://t.co/ewNJicRhOO
And those bystanders will come to believe that it's the nature of online spaces themselves to provoke such toxic behavior, and they will be afraid to engage with others in such spaces. And the cycle will be complete.
And when you then complain publicly about how toxic online spaces are, you'll be able to point to your own experience as proof of your claims. And bystanders, watching the conflagration that ensues, will find your claims convincing.
As a result, your experience of online interaction is going to be severely distorted, but that distortion is going to be invisible to you.
If you're a person who escalates every online disagreement to a flamewar, you're going to repel people who are interested in actual conversation, and attract people who are willing to participate in your flamewars.

But it's a tremendous, important, daring rhetorical strategy, and one in whose reflected discomfort a lot of us could bear to sit for a while, a century and a half later.
That move—that insistence that his white supporters sit with his criticism of them and their discomfort in that criticism—would have caught Douglass a hell of a lot of flak on Twitter.
Here, as with "What to the slave is the Fourth of July," Douglass didn't hesitate to make audiences deeply uncomfortable by rejecting the premises of their gestures of support for him.
"We were born at times: harvest times, watermelon times, and generally hard times. I never knew anything about the celebration of a birthday except Washington’s birthday, and it seems a little strange to have mine celebrated."
"What in the world have you been doing that for? Why Frederick Douglass? That day was taken from him long before he had the means of owning it. Birthdays belong to free institutions. We, at the South, never knew them."
Another story: Douglass apparently once got up at a birthday event in his honor, organized by white supporters, and used his speech to chastise them for holding the event.
@danielle2u Yeah.
Frederick Douglass's history was stolen from him, so he built his own. Starting with his birthday.
He took that as a possible clue—one of the few he had. So he made February 14 his birthday.
Today is the day that Frederick Douglass celebrated his birthday. He didn't know his actual birthday, but on one of the few times he was able to spend time with his mother as a child, she called him her "valentine."
@AngryDaenjangny @TheHipsterRebbe @Russian_Starr What does "hold people to a higher standard" mean in this context if it doesn't mean "criticize people when they screw up and expect them to apologize and make amends"?

It's not just a matter of learning. It's also—and in many respects much more—a matter of unlearning. And unlearning is harder than learning, because adding stuff to your brain is easier than figuring out what's already there that you need to get rid of.
And of course it's precisely because Northam has never had to talk about this stuff in a serious and coherent and thoughtful way in the past that he can imagine that it's going to be a simple process to learn how to do so now.
"Indentured servants from Africa" is the kind of casual gobbledygook that white politicians can get away with when they don't have a spotlight on them. I'd be shocked if this were the first time Northam had used the phrase.
But no, "indentured servants from Africa" didn't land "on [Virginia's] shores" in 1619, despite the various reasons why such a phrasing would hold an appeal for some white Virginians today.
And yes, the use of laws governing indentured servitude was part of the process of constructing a legal apparatus of race-based enslavement in Virginia in the 17th century.
Slavery as a legal institution in what would become the United States wasn't fully elaborated until well after 1619, so the legal status of the slaves (yes, slaves) who were brought from Africa that year is the subject of considerable historical discussion.
"Indentured servants from Africa" didn't come out of nowhere. It wasn't a slip of the tongue.
What's most interesting to me about this quote is what it reveals about how Northam has been trained over a lifetime to talk about America's racial history, and how difficult it's going to be for him to make the kind of pivot he's imagining.
I mean, the text is online. You could read the damn thing. https://t.co/wB02NIdmxa
A lot of the right/center criticism of the Green New Deal seems to be predicated on the idea that it's intended solely as a corrective to the climate crisis, when it's explicitly framed as a broad progressive legislative agenda for the climate crisis era.

@LuxAlptraum Every time I get into an argument about prof-student sex, someone demands to know why I think it's bad for students to want sex with their professors. But I don't think that's bad. I think professors wanting sex with STUDENTS is bad.
@MikeTRose @BigMeanInternet @NotSklawface Yep. Exactly. And shared interests can be rooted in self-interest, ideology, desire for excitement, altruism. Generally they're a combination of multiple motivators.
@LuxAlptraum There's also—and this isn't universal, as you've noted upthread—the reality that a lot of times teens who want to have sex don't actually want to have sex with adults. Grooming isn't just "grooming to want sex," it's also "grooming to want sex with you specifically."
@NotSklawface @BigMeanInternet Let me put it this way: The difference between someone who wants better pay at who joins a social movement and someone who wants better pay who doesn't isn't that the one who joins the movement wants better pay MORE.

@Auricchio_Laura I am absolutely going to tell her this as soon as she gets home.
Progressives aren't being alarmist on climate change. The crisis is huge, and it is imminent, and we are all woefully underprepared. AOC's rhetorical approach was exactly right, and to try to both-sides her on this is crap.
@infinitusestnum Other way around. It's a Nazi singing a Nazi song, and despite the fact that it was written for an anti-Nazi film, it's been embraced by Nazis since the movie came out. It's a tricky situation.
RT @banditelli: @studentactivism the "we're like" is hard for the olds to understand
Even absent the rhetorical framing, it's obvious hyperbole, but the rhetorical framing is essential—and its meaning and purpose are obvious.
Here's the quote: "Millennials and Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up, and we're like, 'The world is going to end in twelve years if we don't address climate change, and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'"
People who really should know better are going around saying that @AOC said the world is going to end in twelve years if we don't take action on climate change. She didn't.

@render_sir I'll leave you with this: "Silence can lead to someone thinking they have consent when they don't" is not at all the same thing as "Silence is consent." They're fundamentally different propositions.
When you find yourself drafting an "of course Hitler's domestic policies were also objectionable" apology, maybe it's time to stop speaking in public for a while. cc: @RealCandaceO
@render_sir Your premise is that the person who is made uncomfortable unintentionally bears responsibility for addressing the situation, but that the person making someone uncomfortable unintentionally does not. I reject that premise. And I can't put it any clearer than that. Bye.
@render_sir Nobody's arguing that it's bad for people to say they're uncomfortable when they're uncomfortable. Everyone on earth agrees that it's good for people to say they're uncomfortable when they're uncomfortable. Everyone.
@render_sir You keep talking exclusively about the obligations of the person on the receiving end of unwelcome behavior, when the quote is about the obligations of the person who is engaging in behavior that may be unwelcome. Why is that?
@render_sir The statement "silence is consent" refers to how you judge whether you have consent, not to how you judge whether you need consent.
@render_sir If you're doing something, and you're not sure the person you're doing it to wants you to do it, stop. Stop and ask, or just stop. If you don't know you have consent, and you need consent, stop. For god's sake, stop.
@render_sir If we're talking about actions where consent isn't required, we don't need a definition of consent. If we're talking about situations where consent IS required, we DO need to know what counts as consent. And again, silence isn't consent. Not legally, not morally.
@render_sir You realize that the guy who is being discussed in the thread has been accused of a pattern of serial sexual assault and harassment, right? That that's the point of the thread?
Also note that Charlie Kirk is standing RIGHT THERE, not ... well, not doing anything.
@michelet One gets the impression that she's mostly just deeply, deeply ignorant.
@render_sir Silence isn't consent. Period. Consent is consent.
That's an accurate and fair quote, by the way. Not taken out of context, or cut to make her look bad. Watch the whole video clip if you're not sure.

Some stuff you've got to just carry. And sometimes the work you do on the stuff that's in your past can't be done in public.
You can't assume absolution. You can't demand absolution. You can't expect that disclosure will erase, or even mitigate the bad deed. It might well cause more pain.
The question of how and whether to reveal acts in your past that you're now ashamed of is a delicate and complicated one. You shouldn't assume that "coming clean" is somehow automatically the noble or moral approach.

@Andrew_Dad @TheodoreRoosev8 @mollycrabapple @HotlineJosh This is a thread about the need for high-speed rail to augment and replace our current wildly outdated passenger rail grid.
@Andrew_Dad @TheodoreRoosev8 @mollycrabapple @HotlineJosh Hardly. Getting to and from the airport in a city like NYC is a huge schlep. Vastly quicker to get to Penn or Grand Central.
@TheodoreRoosev8 @Andrew_Dad @mollycrabapple @HotlineJosh Obviously the changeover would be gradual and would have to be accompanied by lots of infrastructure improvements. But under any reasonable scenario, the time spent in transit but not actually on the train/plane will be lower for train passengers than plane passengers.
@Andrew_Dad @mollycrabapple @HotlineJosh Train stations are typically centrally located. Airports are not. Also, train stations are embedded in public transit grids far better. Travel time to and from airports for most city-dwellers is much higher than for train stations.

@ORgrannie A colleague of Neeson's cited his role in Widows as evidence he's not racist.
As a datapoint, Lenny Bruce was telling "lust trumps racism" jokes in the early 1960s, but those jokes read as obviously stupid to not-particularly-woke-teen-me by the early 1980s.
(By "collectively," I'm referring to the moment when I would have said something like a public consensus emerged, not the moment when people who were actually paying attention figured it out.)

Whether Liam Neeson is a racist isn't a question that can't be answered by recourse to who he has sex with in real life, much less who he makes out with on screen for money.

@jaegotrip @Coco_Crisp I said blackface specifically is about enacting a racial caricature. If you’re asking whether your wig was about enacting a racial caricature, I guess I’d have to say I don’t know. Afro wigs generally tend to tend in that direction, for sure.
@jaegotrip @Coco_Crisp It’s an honest question. You’re saying you didn’t have racist intent, and I have no basis for doubting that, so what are you asking?
@Cajsa Not sure which “he” you’re referring to. Three or four different politicians have admitted to blackface incidents in the last few days.
@jaegotrip @Coco_Crisp I’m not sure what “was it racist” means in the context of this thread.
(Also: Many people are going to be highly disinclined to adopt the most charitable possible reading. That's their right, and you're gonna have to suck it up. Sorry.)
What some public figures are describing as innocent blackface is actually—in the most charitable possible reading—actually ignorant, grotesquely and malignantly so. And naming it for what it is seems like a reasonable minimal bar in 2019.
Blackface is a cultural practice grounded in white supremacy. The belief that putting a bunch of crap on your face makes you look like a black person is belief that can exist only because of and in the context of racism.
So if you've got an "innocent" blackface incident in your past—one that you didn't think of as grounded in racism or racial caricature—you've gotta understand, and express, that yes, it actually was. Even if you didn't consciously realize it at the time.
@JohnELTenney And I count on you for that.

If you, a white person, think you look more like any specific black person with cork or shoe polish on your face than you do with your own damn skin on your face, that's racism at work. Period.
Seems worth saying and repeating: The point of blackface isn't to make you look like a black person, much less to make you look like a SPECIFIC black person. The point of blackface is to make you look like a racial caricature.

@CaNettoyant Yeah. I think they were fucked up parents, but I absolutely get how they wound up there.
It's a very good film, I think. Better—deeper and richer—than it seems at first glance. #AbductedInPlainSight
@CaNettoyant Absolutely. But that kind of social pressure wasn't unique to the LDS church.
@LizzieBedDeath God, yes.
So while the bizarreness of the story definitely leaped out at me, there was an undercurrent of something else as well. An inevitability, almost.  A horrific inevitability. #AbductedInPlainSight
People who came of age back then have stories. Not stories like that, most of us, but stories. #AbductedInPlainSight
It's not quite naiveté, and it's not quite acceptance. It's something structural—a reflection of the language and framing and resources and community support that would be available to a family like them in a situation like that today, but weren't then. #AbductedInPlainSight
@kristinrawls I'm not sure I regard the dad's willingness to give his neighbor a handjob as purely a reflection of naiveté. There's something else operating there.
But a related phenomenon that a lot of people are shocked by in the movie made perfect sense to me, and that's the Bergolds' willingness to maintain social ties with the Berchtolds. #AbductedInPlainSight
The next major explanatory thread of #AbductedInPlainSight was societal lack of understanding—even awareness—of sexual abuse of children. I felt like the movie didn't handle that particularly well—wasn't quite sure what it wanted to say.
The American sexual milieu of the seventies—post-sixties, pre-AIDS—remains a foreign country to most of us today. More so, I'd argue, than the sixties or even the fifties. #AbductedInPlainSight
The seventies was a time of intense, simultaneous sexual experimentation and sexual repressiveness, and it's hard for us today to fully relate either of those phenomena. We're far more liberated than that generation, but also, weirdly, less permissive. #AbductedInPlainSight
There's something very specifically 1970s about the way Berchtold was able to slither into the Broberg parents' sexual lives, and the power he wielded over them once he did. #AbductedInPlainSight
The documentary nods a few times in the direction of talking about the Broberg parents' fear of what Berchtold could do if he went public with what he knew about them, but partly because of their affect, it kind of glosses over it. #AbductedInPlainSight
(The two I'm not so interested in are the family's particular naiveté and Berchtold's...charisma, for want of a better word.) #AbductedInPlainSight
There are five big explanatory threads for the family's behavior in #AbductedInPlainSight. The doc leans hard on four of them, and I want to talk about three of them, including the one the doc gives short shrift to.
I'm going to try to keep spoilers (is that the right word for a documentary?) to a simmer, but if you don't want to know anything more about the doc than you do now, feel free to mute the #AbductedInPlainSight hashtag.
So I watched #AbductedInPlainSight last night, and it's as bonkers as everyone says. But it also really resonated with me, as a child of the seventies.

And he's neither bright nor well-staffed enough to realize that there's a No Backsies rule when you admit you did blackface.
My honest guess is that it's NOT him, but that he assumed it was him when the photo first emerged, and accepted responsibility on that basis. Then one of his med school buddies called him up and said "dude, that's Kevin and Matt."
My hunch:	1. I think he found out last night who was in the photo, or who he can pin it on.	2. I think he's going to put the names out in the next few days.	3. I think he thinks that's gonna help.
Here's the moonwalk clip. I put it at 50/50 that he would have actually done it if his wife hadn't stepped in. https://t.co/R3YqYljaPc

"We need to wrap this up, guys." Northam takes another question.
After that answer, the staffer tried AGAIN to end the presser. He's still taking questions.

@banditelli "My former friend Seth."
The above tweet is not a joke. This is a thing that actually just happened.
A reporter just asked Northam to moonwalk AND HIS WIFE HAD TO TELL HIM THAT WAS A BAD IDEA, if you're wondering just how much of a trainwreck this press conference is.
Northam's repeated references to "my friend Seth," a black guy who explained to him that blackface is bad during his most recent campaign are going to go over real well.
"All of you will be reassured to know that I am not the one in that photo," says the guy who just admitted he put shoe polish in his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume in the fall of 1984.
Blackface homeopathy. https://t.co/R8P2tUXvOi
Northam now saying the other blackface incident—the one he admits to—occurred a few months after the photo appeared, after he graduated from med school. Well.
"I hid the fact that I had a blackface incident throughout my political career but I'm not going to fall on my sword now" is a tack that's sure to endear him to his Dem colleagues.

"I cannot in good conscience choose the path that would be easier for me," says Northam in refusing to resign. Yes, you heard that right. He's trying to paint clinging to power as an act of moral courage.
Northam saying that his memory of the OTHER blackface incident is seared on his brain. Which means he remembered it and hid it throughout the campaign and his first year in office.
Jesus. Northam is saying the photo isn't him but that he DID do blackface at around the same time, in a separate incident.
Northam now: "I believed [yesterday] and believe now that I am not either of the people in that photo."		Northam yesterday: "I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo."

And that's even before you get to the idea that your past is such that you'd just take it as a given that a photo that purports to be of you in blackface/klan regalia must actually be a photo of you.
So the premise here is that someone else takes a photo in KKK/blackface, that it shows up under your name in your yearbook, and that this screwup makes so little impression on you that you retain no memory of the incident.

@jmhenner That's absolutely fair.
@jmhenner The tweet to which you were responding wasn't about pronunciation at all, though, but about acknowledging students' preferences for the names they go by. And I said earlier in the thread that it's rare any of us will arrive at perfect pronunciation anyway.
@casciato College professors get exactly zero training in this sort of thing, so it's easy to fall into bad habits early in your career and then just never fix them. I've heard from several people in response to this thread that they're going to change their practices.
@ehorseVT If there's something in that piece that contradicts something I wrote, tell me and I'll correct if I was wrong.
One last quick thing on this. I have gone by my middle name since birth, so my name on all school records was always wrong every time, even though it was an entirely standard unmispronouncable Anglo name. It's not just "weird" names you need to watch out for.

@sinhadeb Excellent. Thanks.
@kjgormley Some schools will let you change the first name on the roster without a legal name change, so I'd start by finding out if that's an option. Barring that, I'd go with quick email and face-to-face followup as the prof walks in the classroom to confirm that the email was read.
Finally, as with everything, this stuff gets easier the more you do it. Finding your voice as a teacher in navigating these issues is essential, and you'll likely find that voice by floundering a bit in the process. It's worth it.
Anyway, yes, go take a look at @therealOcloo's thread. Lots more stuff there that I didn't cover. https://t.co/qMQaWsxSBQ

I'm never going to get to the point where I'm pronouncing all my students' names absolutely perfectly. But I can get closer if I make an effort than if I don't, and I can make the effort in a respectful way that puts the labor on my shoulders rather than the students'.
Fourth: As suggested here, it's easy to take your quest for "authentic" pronunciation too far. Accept that there are limits to what you'll be able to do, and that respecting a "close enough" can be the right course of action. https://t.co/sPYVuOd8KC
@runclepennybags Yes, definitely. I'm on my way to that.
@rjohnston4 I err on the side of asking when calling the roll, and then invite all students to tell me when they hand in an in-class exercise on the second day to specify what name they prefer to be called by.
Benefits of that approach: Unobtrusive. Covers all students. Addresses nicknames/middle names/pronunciation/transition/etc. Doesn't require students to come to you individually.
Third: ASK STUDENTS WHAT NAME THEY PREFER TO BE ADDRESSED BY. I have a classroom exercise I do on the second day of class every semester, and I tell students that when they're filling out those cards they should use their preferred names, not what's on the roster.
Another thing you can do if you're not sure on pronunciation but can narrow it down is ask "Is it X, or Y?" (Also, because they'll likely say their name for you in response, you can correct yourself even if the answer is actually Z.)
RT @mzbitca: @studentactivism Also with blackboard now it’s easy to reach out before hand to do a general pronunciation/preferred name requ…
Second, READ OVER THE ROSTER BEFORE YOU WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM. You can practice saying names that are likely to be difficult for you in advance, even google common-but-new-to-you names to get a leg up on pronunciation.
And given the above, it goes without saying that a blanket "please correct me if I pronounce your name wrong" before you call the roll will be almost completely useless.
First, students are WAAAY more likely to tell you how to pronounce their name if you ask them to say it for you than if you ask them if you got it right. If you ask "is that correct," many many students will say yes even if the answer is no.

@JakeReif If you think that I came to these clips looking for fodder for a pre-existing anti-Harris narrative, which is what you seem to be implying, you're just factually wrong. I was surprised by what she said, and how she said it, and it lowered my opinion of her.
@JakeReif She's not saying all people to her left are unserious, and she's just saying some people to her left are unserious, either. She's STEREOTYPING people to her left as unserious.
@JakeReif Again, what I'm talking about is her rhetorical framing, not her policies. I've said that over and over. We disagree about what's going on in the clips. That's fine. But I'd appreciate it if you'd try not to insult my intelligence or sincerity while we do so.
@JakeReif I'm not sure what it is you think I'm misunderstanding here. She's mocking people to her left as unserious, and positioning herself as living in the real world, being willing to make hard choices. That's my claim.
@JakeReif It's not disingenuous, because I'm not pretending to believe something that I don't believe. And "mocking the slogan" vs. "mocking the vagueness of the slogan" is a distinction without a difference, to my view.
@JakeReif Again, my point is that her rhetoric and affect in these clips is mocking people who position themselves to her left on questions of how education policy and criminal justice policy should interact.
@JakeReif She's mocking the slogan, and she's mocking people who take the slogan seriously. And she says she agrees with the idea "conceptually"—in other words, in theory.
@JakeReif You're saying that her policy preferences are more nuanced than her messaging, and I'm not disagreeing with that. What I'm saying is that her messaging is in these clips is lefty-punching, and that that's going to be a problem for her in 2020.
@vom_marlowe Yep. As I said to someone yesterday, the video is way worse than a transcript would have been.
@JakeReif That's false. "Build more schools, less jails" is the slogan she's mocking in the clip I'm referring to. Not "no jails," "less jails."
It's similar to the clip about school vs. prison funding. Policy aside, what she's doing in that speech is mocking the idea that school funding should take precedence over prison funding, and mocking the people who believe it.

@princessmom122 Where did I say she was threatening anyone with jail?
@matloaf (You were right and I was wrong that both versions of "carrot and stick" exist in the culture going way back. But it's clear what Harris meant by "stick" here.)
@matloaf "As a prosecutor, in law enforcement, I have a huge stick." The stick is the threat of prosecution. There's no other way to read the analogy.
@matloaf "The carrot and the stick" refers to reward and punishment. That's how the metaphor works. The carrot is reward, the stick is punishment.
@buffsblg Blocked it is, then.
@buffsblg Yeah, that's not even vaguely what I'm doing. You're being an asshole, and you're real close to getting blocked.
@buffsblg @HongPong I didn't say "this defines her." I said this is gross, it's going to hurt her, and it's not consistent with the way she's recently been explaining the more regressive aspects of her prosecutorial record.
@buffsblg If she'd said "sometimes, as a last resort, after all other venues have been exhausted, we need to use the criminal justice system to ensure that kids get to school," my tweet as written wouldn't have made any sense. She didn't.
@buffsblg It's literally clips of her talking.
@buffsblg If you've got evidence that the clips were manipulated, provide it. Otherwise, you're just being silly.
@kevinwatts Is there a specific reason you're being so aggressively snotty in your responses to me? Because I'm not a big fan.
@buffsblg They're not edited. They're excerpts, but they're lengthy excerpts, and there's no indication I can see that they're deceptive in any way.
A lot of people jumping in my mentions assuming that I'm Launching A Partisan Attack Against Harris or something, and responding accordingly. Don't do that. I'm criticizing what she said in these clips, because what she said sucked. That's it.
@kevinwatts Yeah, if you're opposed to threatening parents with arrest you're in favor of truancy. That's definitely it.
@greggentry1 You seem to be under the impression that you're disagreeing with something I said, but I have no idea what.
@mushuweasel Again, I'm not talking about the policy as a policy (though I have opinions on that). I'm talking about what she says in these clips.

Do you really want your tweets to be the reason someone with a disability flunks your class, or drops out of college? Do you want to be a barrier to equal educational access? I assume you don’t. You don’t, right?
Because while you may imagine that all your students are eager to work the system, I guarantee you that many—including some of those most in need of help—are hugely reluctant to step forward.
Two: Have you contemplated the effect that your comments here might have on students at your institution with “legitimate” disabilities? On their willingness to disclose to you, or seek legitimate accommodation at all?
If not, (and if you’re not a particular student’s doctor, the answer is almost always “not”), then what are you even doing? What’s the point of all this? What grade would you give a student who yammered like you’re doing on a test, or in class?
If that’s the case, I have two questions. One: Are you qualified, medically or otherwise, to make a robust, well-defended assessment of which ones are which?
You’d admit, surely, that SOME disabilities are both real and deserving of appropriate accommodation, right? (If not, a free suggestion: Shhhhh.)
Fourth, let’s say you’re right, and that accommodations are dispensed too freely and for too little reason. (A lot of smart people would argue that the opposite was true, but let’s say, for the sake of discussion.)
Third, the internet is forever. You shouldn’t say anything here that you wouldn’t want to see in a printout on your dean’s desk in three years. And yes, that still applies if your account is “anonymous.”
I’m not a “one true path” classroom teacher, and plenty of old-timey strategies work just fine, but if you’re not interested in growing and learning as a teacher, maybe keep that fact to yourself?

If your argument is a “this can’t withstand scrutiny” argument, the “scrutiny” should be something a bit stronger than the hunches and habits you fell into when you started teaching in the 1980s.

Part of the thing about putting black paint all over your face is that whatever your intentions are, other people are going to see it and think "Wow. Blackface. Gross." And if you know that, and you do it anyway, because you're okay with that response? Guess what? It's blackface.
Note: "It's not blackface, it's just a white kid with black paint all over his face" is not the unassailable argument a lot of folks seem to think it is.
@JonHaidt @FreeRangeKids My ex and I started letting our kids out on their own at about the same time—scary as hell, but so good for everyone. (And as a child of NYC myself, a way to give them a bit of the experience of the city that I had growing up, which a lot of kids don't get anymore.)
@mia211csl So if I tell you that if you slather yourself in greasepaint the teenagers on the other team will understand it as a hostile, racist act, and you do it anyway, for "school spirit," you haven't done anything wrong? I say that's bullshit.

@ScottMadin Precisely.
I find all the "What if Trump shows up at the House chamber?" stuff baffling. I can't imagine anything more out of character.
@mia211csl Nobody's saying you don't have a 1A right to wear blackface. The question is, if you know your greasepaint is going to make strangers think you're a racist, do you want to wear it anyway? If your answer is yes, go for it. But many people's answer will be no.
There's a lot more going on in it, but that's the part that always leaped out for me.

Finally, and this is the crucial bit: EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S A BAD IDEA TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING THAT ARGUMENT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION IN THE HANDS OF A TENTH GRADER WHO NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THE TRADITION HIMSELF.

@B_Barbarian It turns out that because of Obama's mother's age, the question of whether her citizenship automatically would have made him a citizen under the law in effect at the time is actually a tricky one. https://t.co/dXYQF1i6BC
@B_Barbarian My recollection is that the question of citizenship by parentage is a matter of federal law, not constitutional jurisprudence. But the core birther claim was that he was born outside the US, which was a lie.
@compbiobryan My recollection is that the "citizenship through your mother" question is a matter of federal law, not constitutional jurisprudence, and that the law changed within a few years of Obama's birth, so it wound up being a quirky technical issue.
@flycat636 I think that was ultimately a tactical political question. In that instance there was a false factual claim being made, and he had the ability to debunk it. I don't have a strong opinion on whether that was the right move.
@miss_speech I understand your position and I disagree with it. I've said that a couple of times now. I'm not sure what else to say.
Because yes, this was of course a putrid racist attack on Kamala Harris, it was also, and crucially, a continuation of a larger and deeply dangerous attack on the idea of contemporary America as an essentially multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural nation.
@miss_speech I've explained in my thread why I think it's important to publicly push back on such claims. It's okay with me if you disagree, but I'm doing it for a reason.
So when someone challenges that principle—when someone suggests that having the wrong heritage or going to the wrong high school makes you less American—you don't ask them for proof. You tell them they're full of shit.
"If you're born here, you're from here" is a fundamental American principle, born in the aborted Reconstruction-era project of granting full citizenship to former slaves, and always contentious, but by now woven into the fabric of the country's life.
@kujakupoet He started with the parents, threw in Canada as a garnish.
@miss_speech I'm only tweeting about it as a corrective to Cuomo's guff and as an opportunity to do a civics lesson on the 14th Amendment.
So why tell such a stupid, obvious lie? Partly it's penny-ante othering of Harris. But mostly, I suspect, it's intended to undermine the constitution itself—to weaken our collective understanding of and commitment to the country's bedrock guarantee of birthright citizenship.
Wohl didn't claim that Harris wasn't born in the US. He claimed that *even though she was born in the US* she's ineligible to be president because her parents were the wrong kind of immigrants. It's transparent bullshit. It's self-refuting.
This is a big part of the reason why Chris Cuomo's tweets on the Kamala Harris claims were so wrongheaded—it makes no sense to ask for "proof" of a claim when that claim is grounded in a xenophobic lie about the text of the US Constitution.
The Obama birther claim was a lie about Obama. The Harris birther claim is a lie about the constitution.
@Golyk @ChrisCuomo I said “Harris is a citizen by birth.” How is that ambiguous?
@Golyk @ChrisCuomo Harris was born in Oakland and thus, according to the 14th Amendment, born a citizen.
@carla_wessells @ChrisCuomo No. The 14th Amendment governs US citizenship, not the laws of India.
@carla_wessells @ChrisCuomo What questions? She was born in Oakland. That makes her a citizen. The constitution is perfectly clear.
@carla_wessells @ChrisCuomo And? Finish the thought. How does that render her ineligible for the presidency?
@ChrisCuomo Harris was born in Oakland. Under the Constitution and federal law, she is a citizen. There’s no factual or legal dispute here. Read the Fourteenth Amendment.

@earlp1231 @mtracey The overwhelming majority of Jamaicans (Harris' father among them) are the descendants of enslaved Africans. My tweet was based on the assumption that that was common knowledge.
@maryking1948 @mtracey She's of Indian descent, Jamaican descent, and African descent, and as a black woman born in the United States, she identifies as African American.
@maryking1948 @mtracey I'm aware of that, but the vast majority—including Harris's father—do.
@_25_mentalety @mtracey Because her father, like the vast majority of Jamaicans, is descended from enslaved Africans.
@mtracey You didn't, again, ask whether she identifies as African American, which a moment's googling would have confirmed that she does. You raised doubt about the validity of that self-identification.
@mtracey @EdAsante77 You asked what you—you, Michael Tracey— were "missing," and I gave you an answer. If you'd been a different person asking a different question, my answer probably would have been phrased differently.
@GeeDee215 @mtracey Sure. There's complexity to the question of identity, and like Obama and Colin Powell, her ancestry distinguishes her from many African Americans. But Harris identifies as African American, which seems relevant as well.
@EdAsante77 @mtracey I of course understand the difference, but the difference isn't "this group is African American, and this other group isn't." Self-identification and cultural identity are much blurrier than that, and always have been.
@mtracey I mean, yes, we all know that ethnic identity is culturally constructed. And yes, some Americans of Afro-Caribbean ancestry choose not to identify as African American, but very many do, and have for a very long time.
@mtracey But you're not asking whether she IDENTIFIES as African American, you're asking whether she's DEFINITIONALLY African American, which is a very different thing.
@mtracey As an American-born person with a Jamaican father, she's an American of African descent. Thus, African American. I'm confused why you're confused.
@angrykittenpaws Yeah, I keep getting pulled back to this position. The cynic in me wants to say it's all money, all performance. But if he's faking the ecstatic thrill he gets from it, he's a very good faker.

Aaron Sorkin believes that Jeff Daniels playing acoustic guitar would win the 2020 presidential election in a historic landslide, because Aaron Sorkin does not realize that other people are not him.
But I don't assume that *everybody* likes Jeff Daniels playing acoustic guitar, and I wouldn't write a scene whose emotional core was a couple of dozen people of varying ages, genders, and races coming together as one to swoon over Jeff Daniels playing acoustic guitar.
And I mean, I happen to kind of like Jeff Daniels playing acoustic guitar myself. I, like Aaron Sorkin and Jeff Daniels, am an old white guy.
The core problem with Aaron Sorkin as an electoral politics guru is the core problem with Studio 60 and The Newsroom: The man is resolutely convinced that everybody likes whatever it is that he happens to like.

@AngusDwyer @CaptDavidRyan I can see it, definitely.
Lemon out!
But Richard Spencer doesn't appear in public anywhere near as much as he used to, and people know better than to talk shit to Buzz Aldrin now. Draw what lessons you choose.
Political violence in the US was overwhelmingly a phenomenon of the far right before Spencer got punched, and it stayed that way after. Left political violence was extremely rare then, and remains extremely rare today.
Spencer himself was publicly humiliated, and made very famous in a way that turned out not to be fun for him at all. So that was a good thing. But the tsunami of Nazi-punchings that many anticipated never materialized.
And just to close out this particular meander, it's well worth remembering how small of a thing the Richard Spencer punch wound up being, in the life of the nation.
In general, by the way, my view remains that punching people in the face because of what they believe or say is a bad idea. But the question of who gets to be an exception to that rule is a question worth pondering.
We don't in fact have a cultural prohibition against punching people in the face because of their beliefs or public statements. We think we do, but we don't. We make all sorts of exceptions.
Remember when half the country's chattering class freaked out for two straight months because Buzz Aldrin punched a moon landing denier? Me neither.
The fact that Richard Spencer got punched on Buzz Aldrin's birthday is a gorgeous cultural convergence that I hadn't noticed until just now.

One question the Buzzfeed story leaves tantalizingly unanswered is what proof there is of Trump’s order beyond Cohen’s testimony.
@mnemosyneous It was absolutely true during Watergate. Clarity was a long time coming.
“Trump ordered Michael Cohen to lie to investigators” is potentially a pretty good first draft of such a sentence.

@bob_wilson I don't think you're contradicting what I said nearly as much as you think you are.
To the extent that the United States resembles a democracy, Trumpism is an electoral dead end. That's obvious in a way it wasn't even a few months ago. So this move is, at least in part, a hedging of bets.
The obvious explanation for this move is his explicit embrace of white supremacy, calling it by its name. But it’s also a reflection of a deeper panic, I think.

@AdamTheRed Most of that difference is a reflection of his broad unpopularity, though. And his strongly/moderately approve ratio is much higher than most previous presidents.
Sorry, meant for this to go on the thread, not as a stand-alone: "And because his polling has been so consistent, even a net loss of, say, another five points in the next few weeks would take on an outsized significance to a lot of people."
@AdamTheRed His "no opinion/no strong opinion" numbers are far lower than most presidents'.
@maxberger I agree with that.
@AdamTheRed What part of what I said do you think you disagree with?
@maxberger I'm done making predictions, but my strong sense is that this year is going to be WAY more tumultuous—and precarious—for him than last year was.
And because his polling has been so consistent, even a net loss of, say, another five points in the next few weeks would take on an outsized significance to a lot of people.
If you have to bet, bet on that staying the same. But if it changes, things could get real weird real quick.
So far Trump's polling has been absurdly consistent: People who hate him hate him, people who love him love him, there are more of the former than the latter, and there aren't many people outside those two categories. That's the story of every poll of his presidency.
But with the shutdown continuing, and the shutdown-specific polling looking really ugly for him, I suspect that a lot of people around him—and a lot of people in the congressional GOP—are beginning to check polling data a lot more closely than they have in a while.
(Ordinary for him, that is. No first-term president since Bush I has ever had polling as bad as Trump "ordinary," at any point in his term.)
So he's still within his 2018 range, though at the low end of it. And he's got a bit more to lose before he starts hitting his 2017 troughs. As of today, in other words, his polls still look pretty ordinary.
A month ago, Trump's net popularity was around -9, about as high as its ever been (except for the first few weeks after inauguration). He's lost about five points since then.
Trump's net popularity in his first year in office wobbled around between about -15 and -20. In his second year it rose a bit, to the -10 to -15 range. Remarkably consistent overall, but the upward shift seems to have been real.

@portorium We don't know. They handed off to Mueller when he came on board, and nothing has been released publicly since then.

And of course the list of his enemies is constantly transforming and expanding. It's not a defined, or definable, category. It's unbounded.
For Trump, a win-win isn't a win, because it doesn't involve anybody losing. But a lose-lose feels like a win, because, again, watching your enemies suffer is what really matters.
@mbrockenbrough Right. Him seeing himself as winning requires the other person losing. But it doesn't actually require him winning. It's the losing that matters.
Assume a situation in which there's no way out of the shutdown that's a win for Trump and a loss for the Dems. Which will be more appealing to him: win-win, or lose-lose? The answer's obvious, right?

@oatmealish Remember when we were going to be withdrawing from Syria? That was like ten minutes ago. He's not building a wall.

RT @AlloutHelter: @studentactivism FWIW, Wende Davis still hosted TJ Miller despite protests in Denver to his presence. So her doing the ri…
@stevecantsmell Nope.
There's no way to "help people think this sort of thing through" if you don't know—and don't care to find out—what "sort of thing" the thing you're talking about actually is. The specifics matter. Always.
Two quotes from the same Buruma interview: 		1. "The reason I was interested in publishing it is precisely to help people think this sort of thing through."		2. "The exact nature of his behavior—how much consent was involved—I have no idea, nor is it really my concern."
So the example Wende Curtis is setting here isn't just in banning CK from her club, although that's great too. It's in taking the process addressing this kind of misconduct seriously, beginning with making sure you know the facts before acting or speaking out.
Every time I yammer about CK on here, a bunch of people come up and say "so people who are accused of bad things should never work again?" And I have to say, over and over, that CK isn't "accused of bad things." He's ADMITTED to WORKPLACE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. There's a difference.
And of course the specifics matter. They matter when you give someone a soapbox, and they matter when you invite someone into your place of business.
Think of Ian Buruma, who commissioned, published, and defended an essay by Jian Ghomeshi without ever bothering to find out the specifics of what he'd done and been accused of. Happens all the time. All the time.
But what's significant here is that when it became her professional responsibility to find out what the details were, she actually did that. So many people don't bother, even at that stage.
One thing about this story: It doesn't surprise me at all that she didn't know the specifics of the allegations when CK reached out. Not everyone follows the details of stories like this, even in their own industry.

@ElectionBabe You made a new argument I hadn't heard before, and I considered it. But as soon as I asked you a question about it, you abandoned it and moved on to a different one. My experience is that when people do that, they're not actually interested in a discussion. Sorry.
@ElectionBabe That's a different objection than the one you raised initially, and it's one I've addressed elsewhere—both on Twitter and in the essay I linked. I'm not interested in rehashing it, sorry.
@RealestBobbyJ As I said in the thread to which you replied, I think it's right and proper that the legal age of maturity for all other actions to stay exactly where it is. But since you're not reading what I'm writing, let's just go our separate ways. Bye.
@ElectionBabe Serving as a sworn witness in court strikes me as a much closer analogy to signing a voter form than serving as a juror does. In each case, a minor is affirming under threat of legal penalty that they are telling the truth.
@ElectionBabe Kids younger than twelve testify in court today. How is this different than that?
@RealestBobbyJ Yes, and I regard young teenagers' input as desirable and valuable to society.
@Jbenne75 I sound like a pedo because I say that it's bad and harmful to have sex with kids and that it's good that it's illegal to have sex with kids? Interesting.
@Armyactor So move on.
@ElectionBabe We set different ages of legal adulthood for different things. Always have, always will. At 16 your signature can legally commit you to some things but not to others.
@SadieInProgress The most thoughtful, compelling argument I've heard is that it would expose some children in abusive households to additional coercion and abuse. (Yes, that's also an issue in elder abuse, but not on the same scale.)
@RealestBobbyJ Under that analogy, everyone who votes for candidates we oppose is doing the equivalent of dumping toxic waste in the river, and should be barred by law from doing so.
@lightguy10 I have never in my life cast a vote in a public election that was decided by one vote. The outcome of every election I've ever voted in would have been the same if I'd voted the other way. That's the kind of consequences I'm referring to.
@oraymw (Also, the younger you set the voting age, the more likely it becomes that parents will cast votes on behalf of their children, which is wrong, so it's not like there's no downside to me in setting the age too low.)
@oraymw I don't think I'd frame it as "duties." I don't think there's a duty not to cast a vote by flipping a coin. I'm just saying that there would be a societal benefit to allowing 12-year-olds to vote, and I can't identify a similar benefit to giving the vote to infants.
@oraymw Take care.
@oraymw A typical twelve-year-old is capable of understanding what voting is, how an election works, what the duties of an office-holder are, etc. A typical two-year-old is not. Somewhere between those two ages is where I'd draw the line. I don't know exactly where.
@PaprikaPink I'm not arguing that we should take the vote away from people over 18. Younger voters would be a small slice of the electorate. The only questions they'd even have the chance to have any impact on would be ones where everyone else was equally divided.
@jamesecoulter Your.
@MichaelArtz Sure. And if we lowered the voting age, there's a lot of work we'd have to do to ensure that those votes would be cast freely and without coercion.
@vom_marlowe That's a real question, and one I take seriously. But there are benefits to encouraging kids to understand that they have rights that can't be legally abrogated by the adults around them, too.
Voting is an act that carries virtually no risk to the voter, and the practical consequences of one cast vote are negligible. It's essentially impossible for a single individual to cause harm to themselves or others by voting.
@vom_marlowe One thing worth contemplating is that all the data we have indicates that voting rates among young voters would be quite low. The right to vote isn't an obligation to vote.
We all understand that it's legitimate and appropriate to allow children to make certain decisions for themselves, and to prohibit them from making other decisions. At 12 and 14 and 16, kids are typically granted autonomy that they don't have at younger ages.
If you set the legal age for drinking or smoking or leaving school or working or having sex at twelve, the people who would suffer the most would be the children themselves. Setting the age higher is designed first and foremost TO PROTECT THEM FROM HARM.
In most cases—drinking, driving, working, smoking, having sex, leaving school—we set the age of majority at a certain point primarily because we recognize that putting it lower would result in harm to the kids themselves.
We set the age of majority in the US at different ages for different things, because we recognize that the costs and benefits of allowing young people freedom to make choices about their own lives differ depending on what the choice in question is.

Always a treat to wake up and discover that your tweets have been shared by some bozo on some bozo message board.

@oraymw And I'm also deeply skeptical about claims that everyone has a duty to do something that can't be clearly described or measured, when we're talking about duties that attend the exercise of legal rights.
@GradyPounders Some do, some don't. As with grownups.
@sweatingbanshee I don't know what it means to say that people who are X years old have a right to vote but that people who are X-1 years old don't, in the context of moral rights.
@oraymw "Do the best you can" is an obligation that it's as easy for a 12-year-old, or a 6-year-old—or an infant!—to live up to as it is for an adult. Easier, I'd say.
@GradyPounders @nberlat So you think that people with cognitive disabilities and the elderly should be barred by law from voting. Fab.
@GradyPounders They'd get in a lot of accidents and hurt others and themselves. As I argued in the thread linked below, though, it's hard to make a similar case for harm in the case of voting. https://t.co/qAjUP2pZm1
There's a huge amount of lacerating, essential discussion happening right now on the #SurvivingRKelly hashtag. I can't do justice to it all in a tweet, but if it's not on your radar, it should be.
@colocha_rachel @jonathanstegall Fair enough.
@oraymw I think my question is this: if the chance that the vote you cast will be for the “better” candidate is 50/50, is it more moral for you to vote or not? I’d say voting is better.
@AnaMardoll @JanetteKirchner @ticketdust @ScottMadin I was only addressing the question of whether the law permits it, not the prospects for prosecution.
@psychofan Yay!
@oraymw Nope. If I vote for an evil person because I want him to do evil things, that’s evil. But if I mark the wrong box and neglect to check it, that’s not immoral, to my mind. (And it could easily lead to a good outcome!)
@ilVeleno Why should that be the same as the voting age?

@AnaMardoll @JanetteKirchner @ticketdust @ScottMadin Voter coercion is a federal crime. Yes, enforcing it would be very hard. But it’s a crime. https://t.co/gBPau1gmCS
@oraymw No it doesn’t.
@AnaMardoll @ticketdust @JanetteKirchner @ScottMadin I’m pretty sure that’d be a federal crime under current law.
If I let my twelve-year-old pick who I vote for, is anyone harmed? If not, who is harmed if she casts that vote herself?
But if I vote using a “bad” decision-making process—if I flip a coin in the voting booth, say—it’s not at all obvious that I’m doing harm to anyone in the way we typically use that word.
When we bar kids from making choices they’re not mature enough to make, it’s generally because we’re worried that they’ll do harm to themselves or others if allowed to choose.
At 12, the typical kid is more than able to meet baseline standards for voting—understanding what an election is, learning about candidates, managing the act of voting.
One more thing on youth voting: There are a lot of folks in my mentions saying kids aren’t cognitively developed enough to vote. But it’s not clear to me what that means.
@MARspidermonkey I don’t know what “cognitively ready for” voting means. Kids typically make decisions in different ways than adults do. But we allow them to make lots of decisions.
@TheJustiest No. The US has different ages of majority for all sorts of things. This wouldn’t change that.
@ScottMadin @AnaMardoll Yep. That's a hard one for me.
@AnaMardoll @ScottMadin Yep. I think they're all really important, and if I were writing the RS piece today I would have leaned on that angle even harder.
@erikawas And yet here you are. Again.
@AnaMardoll @ScottMadin I think it's absolutely true that it would be bad for some kids in abusive households and good for others. (And wouldn't make a difference for a third group.) My hunches about how many would fall into which category are wild guesses.
@MARspidermonkey I don't expect that every kid would have that confidence. I think that quite a few would, and many more would be nudged in that direction over time.
@AnaMardoll @ScottMadin If I had the power to snap my fingers and make it happen tomorrow? Well, I'd probably still do it. But that's partly because I believe it would wind up being a lifeline for a lot of kids in oppressive homes. And partly because I believe it would lead to other changes.
@AnaMardoll @ScottMadin Honestly, there are three big reasons I publicly support 12-year-old suffrage:	1. It makes 16-year-old suffrage look like a moderate position.	2. It gets kids excited about imagining themselves as autonomous.	3. It encourages us all to think about the ways kids are screwed over.
@MARspidermonkey One difference between that and voting is that voting is, by law, a PRIVATE choice.
@MrFarberToYou There's a lot of discussion of the differences between kids and adults in abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills and empathy. But most of us vote—at 18, at 28, at 38—the way we were acculturated to vote. We're not blank slates.
@AnaMardoll Yep. See my replies above. Completely agree.
@AnaMardoll And that's honestly part of why I support the idea—because it encourages us to think seriously about the kinds of abuses you're talking about, and how to mitigate and combat them.
@AnaMardoll I hear you, and I take that seriously. And yes, a country that would allow 12-year-olds to vote would have to be a very different one than the one we live in.
There's a lot of people in my mentions whose perceptions of how the average voter makes their decisions are VERY different from mine.
@AnthonyCruzJr1 @fabiansociety Yep. As I said in the article I wrote advocating for this, parental coercion is my most serious qualm about the idea. https://t.co/HumaBYKI08
@FrKadel I don't think it's coming for a long time. I'm optimistic that I'll see the age lowered to 16 before I die, but I think anything beyond that is a pipe dream in my lifetime.

@lelelom No voter chooses the people leading the country in isolation. And if you'd known from the age of six that you were going to be voting at 12, you might have prepared for the possibility. Or chosen not to vote.
@sweatingbanshee Sure. In theory. But if I say "X group shouldn't vote because they have trait Y," I'm saying people with trait Y shouldn't vote.
@bradiscranky "I don't want these people voting because they're likely to make decisions I don't like for reasons I don't respect" is an antidemocratic position to take.
@fl_snowbirds By that logic, what's the argument against depriving adults the vote if they fail tests of cognitive development?
And hell, one OTHER other thing: If your argument against 13-year-olds voting is that it might lead to electoral outcomes you don't like, be aware that you're advocating disenfranchising people on the basis of their political viewpoint.
One other thing, while I'm up: If your argument against 13-year-olds voting is one that could be used to block people with cognitive disabilities or the elderly from voting, maybe keep it to yourself.
(And if you're going to tell me that votes for 12-year-olds is a bad idea, at least do me the courtesy of making an argument. I mean, statistically, I already KNOW you think it's a bad idea.)
@DearDara @CarlottaBrad4 @lizzwinstead The hollowing out we're going through now is agonizing, and you're absolutely right about the causes.

@banditelli My strong suspicion is that the campaign as an institution will do what's needed to get this right for 2020 and repair what needs to be repaired from 2016. But this kind of talk from the candidate is dispiriting.
@jasongrote Well, reasonable people can disagree on that one. (I wrote this in early 2016, and pretty much stand by it.) https://t.co/FatbKl5IeY
And a euphemism. Two conditionals, a to-be-sure, and a euphemism.
@jasongrote If he fumbled it, that's a failure, no? And I don't think you can write this piece without mentioning the Bernie Bro thing. But I guess we can agree to disagree. Thanks for replying.
"I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately." That's two conditionals and a to-be-sure in the space of barely a dozen words. It's not going to inspire confidence in anyone that the mistakes of 2016 aren't going to be repeated in 2020.
But whether or not the failures described in the Times piece were common failures, they were failures, and if you're the candidate under whose banner they took place, you need to make it clear that you take them, and the project of rectifying them, seriously.
My assumption, as I said earlier, is that most campaigns have been piss-poor in dealing with sexual harassment until pretty much yesterday. I'm not surprised Bernie 2016 was, and I don't think they were unusual in that.
(I voted Bernie in 2016, and don't regret it. This isn't me weighing in against him for 2020. This is about how ANY elected official should respond to a story like this one about one of their past campaigns.)

@jasongrote A reported story like this is going to be about a specific campaign 99% of the time—a comparison of multiple campaigns' harassment issues is a distinct genre of story, and it piggybacks on stories like this.

@nothingsmonstrd It's unlikely to be a huge problem for a GOP candidate during primary season, but it's not a story the nominee will want to have to address during the general, and every candidate is hoping to be the nominee.
The piece is well worth reading in full, BTW. The issues go beyond harassment to questions of pay and staffer safety at work—issues that I've seen crop up over and over again in progressive organizing environments.
As of today, all the 2020 candidates are on notice, and that's a good thing.
I have no idea whether Sanders 2016 was worse or better than a typical campaign in handling sexual harassment complaints, but it suprises me not at all that its practices weren't as good as they needed to be—a lot of political and activist orgs are still lousy at this.

@GetClamps YOU are the one who keeps claiming they're being oppressed. You keep saying it over and over. I haven't said it once. But this is stupid. Go enjoy your new year's.
@GetClamps You're claiming you're being oppressed by my words. That's the distinction I'm drawing. Think whatever you want, say whatever you want, but drop the "So I'm not allowed to disagree?" bullshit. I'm not a cop, and I'm not a censor, I'm just a guy with a Twitter account.
@GetClamps Nobody's saying you're not allowed to do anything. God, you're such a whiner.
@Doorknobsnob @SweetGeekling @davidaxelrod Two separate issues: He's a serial sexual predator, and his new jokes are ugly and unfunny. The first is why he got fired, and why people have been calling on people not to put him onstage. The second is why he's been criticized this week.
@EBlumberg11 I mean, people pay to see plenty of stupid, unfunny comedians, and when they aren't also sexual predators, other people mostly just shrug and ignore it.
@GetClamps "Backlash" is just another word for criticism, and criticism is just another word for free speech. And on the Columbia situation, are you saying that the people paying you to tell jokes don't have a right to tell you to stop?
And again, since a lot of people don't seem to get it, Louis CK isn't being denied work because he tells stupid, unfunny jokes. He's being denied work because he's a serial workplace sexual predator. There's a difference.
@Doorknobsnob @SweetGeekling @davidaxelrod He admitted to workplace sexual harassment with multiple victims over multiple years. Is it not reasonable for potential employers to consider that history?
@GetClamps He lost his ability to make money because he sexually abused his co-workers and everyone who hired him to do stuff fired him for it. Nothing to do with the quality of his jokes—which, by the way, used to be very very funny.
@GetClamps Do you always get this upset when someone thinks a joke you think is funny isn't funny? I'm not telling you not to like it.
@CarlKleinduff You said I made an inaccurate statement, and that I did so knowingly. I did not.
@flamefingered1 It's been a while, but I don't remember the retard jokes. "Euphemism is bad" isn't all that's in the CK joke, and it's not the part that I was responding to.
@flamefingered1 If you're not disputing my claims that the bit is old, tired, hacky, and based on a false premise, I'm not sure what you think you ARE disputing, or why you're bothering.
@flamefingered1 As I said in my original tweet, the joke isn't "accurate," because plenty of people with cognitive disabilities are perfectly able to explain why they find the word "retarded" obnoxious. But what I was saying in the tweet to which you replied was that it was old and hacky.
@flamefingered1 The idea that Kurt Vonnegut, of all people, would have cosigned CK's joke is the most preposterous thing I've ever heard.
A question for those who claim that Louis CK stopped sexually harassing his colleagues in 2005: Don't you think that if that were the case, he would have said so last year? (He didn't. Because he didn't.)
@GetClamps It's a hack joke. It's tired. It's the anti-PC equivalent of "make the whole plane out of what they make the black boxes out of"—it's grounded in a false and lazy premise, so it can never go anywhere funny.
@davidaxelrod Would you hire someone who'd been fired from his previous job for taking his dick out in the workplace? If not, why should comedy club owners?
@nozzarelli So you're saying you DON'T think the free market should decide? I'm confused. But also bored. So don't bother answering.
@artlung Note that he hasn't done this since the Times article. He's not interested in risking his own money on finding out what kind of an audience he has, at least not yet.
@nozzarelli So...we agree that it's good that he can't get work because nobody wants to hire him because he takes his dick out in the workplace. Swell.
Me: Louis CK's bit about euphemism is old and tired.	This person: Posts a Carlin bit from 1990 to prove me wrong. https://t.co/0KBJK49h5Y
Let's be real clear about this: All the businesses that employed CK before the NYT article fired him, and none of them, other than a handful of comedy clubs, have hired him back.
@nozzarelli A lot of potential employers are clearly deciding they don't want to hire him. Is that wrong? Should they be forced to?
@CarlKleinduff Not all the allegations against him have been made public and on the record. He didn't stop in 2003.

A word to the Louis CK stans who are showing up in my mentions: Note that I'm not saying his joke was offensive. I'm saying it was lazy and flaccid and didn't land. You don't get to be outraged on CK's behalf at my outrage at his joke, because I didn't offer up any.
Another interesting thing about that bit: Louis CK makes fun of the phrase "intellectually challenged" in it. That term's usage peaked in the early 1990s, which suggests that CK has been saving up shitty hacky jokes for 25 years.
In his new set Louis CK says it's bad we don't say "retarded" anymore, because people with cognitive disabilities won't understand why. Which is ironic, since my sister, who has a severe cognitive disability, could easily tell you why, and Louis CK, who doesn't, can't.

@nathanl75 I don't have a "he's a really bad person in a different way" exemption to my "don't falsely accuse people of horrible crimes" rule.
@jbenmenachem I believe that Weinstein is a rapist, and that belief is based on compelling evidence, so his chances of winning a libel suit against me in a US court are essentially zero. He could sue me, and that suit could cause me a lot of pain, but morally and legally I'm in the right.

@BloodwingBX You gotta earn your seat at the table.
Miss you, grandma.
"If I didn't know something about hard-ons," she says, "NONE of you would be here." And then she goes back to her conversation.
She turns and puts her hands on her hips, arms akimbo, and speaks.
@Auricchio_Laura She was so great.
My grandmother, thankfully, and as always, was cooler than me.
Like a putz.
Instead, I said, loud enough for everyone in both conversations to hear, "I can't believe I just heard my grandmother use the word 'hard-on'!"
When you hear your grandmother use the word "hard-on" for the first time, the thing to do is feel honored and play it cool. Reader, I did not do this.
(I said "fondest" memories at the top. Not "sweetest.")
Again, I'm in my early twenties, and the youngest person in the room by a generation. Absolutely the first time I've heard my grandmother talk like this.
And so it was that I happened to hear a piece of a sentence in which my white-haired grandmother, describing a work of classical art—I deeply wish, today, I knew which one—used the word "hard-on."
My paternal grandmother was an artist, and my aunt is one, and my mom is English and a history buff, so it's not surprising they were talking about Aunt Wendy that day. I was overhearing snippets of their conversation in the gaps in my own.
Anyway, we were all in my grandmother's kitchen area—me and some male relatives around the dining room table, my mom, aunt, and grandmother hanging out in the kitchen proper.
My story, given the timeline in the obit, would date from around 1994. I was in my mid-twenties, visiting my grandmother in Seattle with my folks. (In my memory I was in or just out of college, so it's possible it was 1992.)
So Sister Wendy was a nun who did a series of art-appreciation shows for the BBC, in several of which she waxed rhapsodic about erotic themes in classical art. Everyone was thrilled and scandalized and thrilled again. It was a whole thing.
This obit for Sister Wendy reminds me of one of my fondest memories of my grandmother. https://t.co/FI1YCnC7wH

@BipolarAndrew I don't think they'd be able to get away with making it if the show was more open about wanting to attract that kind of audience, though. On the surface, it's clearly pitched at adults, so they can get away with a lot more.
@BipolarAndrew This is a crucial part of its insidious genius, I think—kids are going to watch it behind their parents' backs, thinking they're getting away with something.
@jcatjcatjcat It's 100% both. It's massively crude and over-the-top disgusting—young teens are mostly going to watch it behind their parents' backs. But the core outlook of the show is defiantly moral.

“Prayer for a New Mother.” 		Dorothy Parker, 1928.
Ah, let her go, kind Lord, where mothers go 	And boast his pretty words and ways, and plan 	The proud and happy years that they shall know 	Together, when her son is grown a man.
Keep from her dreams the rumble of a crowd, 	The smell of rough-cut wood, the trail of red, 	The thick and chilly whiteness of the shroud 	That wraps the strange new body of the dead.
Let her have laughter with her little one; 	Teach her the endless, tuneless songs to sing, 	Grant her her right to whisper to her son 	The foolish names one dare not call a king.
The things she knew, let her forget again—	The voices in the sky, the fear, the cold, 	The gaping shepherds, and the queer old men 	Piling their clumsy gifts of foreign gold.

@edkrayewski I've said what I have to say to you about this subject.
@A_Siegel And that's household income, not individual. A lot of MOCs have spouses who work.
@ideirdre A ton of freelance editing work makes it possible, barely. But it's not pretty.
@Ethnography911 Yep. Most of their families are living somewhere where everything is MUUUUCH cheaper.
And please, please, PLEASE, if you're going to tweet at me about how hard it is to survive on $174K in DC, bear in mind that I'm an adjunct professor, and that I live in Manhattan.
@JacobBrahm @WhenIs2001 I live in Manhattan on the salary of an adjunct professor who moonlights as a proofreader, writer, and occasional public speaker. $174K a year isn't "hard" anywhere in the United States.
Would some MOCs feel an economic pinch if their pay was held up during government shutdowns? Yes. Would that be a good thing? ALSO YES.
@JacobBrahm @WhenIs2001 174K a year for two residences isn't anything close to the same standard of living as 89K a year for one residences. Most of your expenses stay the same or only rise marginally.
And no, such a law wouldn't discourage working class people from running for congress, as Ed suggests.
I think AOC is right on the policy here, as well as right on the rhetoric—withholding MOCs' pay during shutdowns is the right thing to do, and it'd probably make shutdowns a bit less frequent and a bit shorter.
@edkrayewski Docking MOC's pay is a policy, and her assessment of the merits of that policy—her "analysis" of it, if you will—differs from yours. And you said she was "falling for" the rhetoric, rather than endorsing the policy because she thinks it's good policy.
And again, this wasn't a "MOCs are obscenely wealthy" tweet. It was a "there's no such thing as a low-income MOC" tweet. Because there isn't.
And yes, there are specific financial burdens on members of congress. But there are specific financial burdens on a lot of people who make $174K a year. The burdens on MOCs are not uniquely onerous.
@edkrayewski I didn't say it was offensive, I said it was ridiculous. And to act like this was a matter of her getting hoodwinked rather than her having a different policy analysis than yours is doubly so.
Note to everyone pestering me about the DC cost-of-living: $174K puts you in the 96th income percentile in the US, and well above the 90th in DC.
@edkrayewski Fine. I disagree, but fine. But to express your view by slamming one of the few working-class members of congress for endorsing it, and to call her ignorant along the way—AND to phrase it the way you did—struck me as ridiculous.
@A_Siegel Assuming no outside income, $174K is 96th percentile for the country. I'd call that "high income," and "upper middle class" only by the US's weird standards for how to use that term.
@edkrayewski But the crucial element—one AOC understands—is that being personally exposed to someone's difficulties makes a huge difference in how you respond to them. Causing hardship to a colleague is harder than causing hardship to a stranger.
@edkrayewski There's never been a government shutdown longer than three weeks. The difference between a $174K salary and even one half that is huge at that length of time. So yes, MOCs would still be insulated from real financial crisis—though they'd feel the pinch, some of them.
@edkrayewski Well, I'd be absolutely shocked if the average furloughed staffer's salary was anywhere near $174K. But no, I don't think such a law would discourage low-income people from seeking office, and I do think it'd help. Here's why:
I've got lots of ideas, and the folks who are bringing me out do too, but I'm eager to hear from folks in the field as well. Feel free to reach out by DM. (And yes, I'll be asking again when it's not the Saturday before Xmas.)
@FuriosaSK Yes, I'm aware. But wealth and income aren't the same thing, and AOC won't be living paycheck to paycheck as a member of congress, either.
@RadicalGoats It is neither low nor middle income, is the point.
Specifically, I'm keynoting the #NACA19 professional development luncheon, and speaking at two educational sessions—one targeted toward students, and one targeted toward professional attendees.
Got a favor to ask of campus activities professionals and students involved in the campus activities field: I'm going to be speaking at #NACA19, and I want to know what y'all would like to hear.

@suntzufuntzu To the extent that they will emerge from the nomination process, yes. Debates will focus attention, allow the campaigns to try out specific strategies and messaging, cull the herd, etc. The debates, and everything surrounding them, will help shape the discussion, for sure.

@driven2drink Thank you so much. I really appreciate that. Trying to keep my head above water.
Oops. Quadruple negative. Tripped over my shoelaces. The problem isn't that we don't NOT have a shortage of good ideas.
I mean, yeah, the endless campaign cycle is a drag as a general principle. But is summer 2019 too early for the contenders for the leadership of the Democratic Party to start a high-visibility public debate about how to beat Trump and what should come after? I don't think it is.
@JerryActually I don't think summer 2019 is too early for the Democratic Party to start debating  how to beat Trump and what should come after in a high-profile way.

The way I remembered it carries a hint of transformation—that we have to be careful not to become what we pretend to be. But that's not what Vonnegut is saying. He's saying what you pretend to be is what you are.
My memory of the quote for a long time was that it was "we must be careful about what we pretend to be, because we are what we pretend to be." I had the clauses reversed. It's so much darker the way Vonnegut actually wrote it.
And that's the thing. Even if he is, IT LITERALLY DOESN'T MATTER. It doesn't mitigate the harm. It doesn't ameliorate the racism. It's just ... irrelevant. It's a distinction without a difference. https://t.co/wzS3DJdztK

@JoshZ2012 I’m not saying vote by mail is bad.
Make voting as easy and as frictionless as possible consistent with the integrity of the process. That’s the answer. Anything else is making the process of voting itself a test of your worthiness. That’s not what voting should be.
“If they wanted their vote to count they shouldn’t have screwed up” is so noxious to me. I wanted my vote to count, and I screwed up. Happens all the time, for a hundred reasons.
And yes, I feel like aschmuck for screwing up my ballot. But I’m admitting it publicly because when there are hoops to jump through, some people won’t clear them. It’s inevitable.
I learned a couple of days ago that I didn’t actually vote this November because I neglected to sign the envelope the ballot was mailed in. On top of everything else, early voting makes voting simpler than relying on absentee. https://t.co/bKjpY6SRRk

@ggreenwald @DavidIDean He didn't introduce the censorship framing. You did. But yes, you've made it clear why you did, so I'm happy to leave it there.
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl So advertiser boycott campaigns aren't definitively, but merely arguably, censorship. Got it. Have a good day.
@ggreenwald @DavidIDean No. Again. For the fourth time. I'm asking you why, if you didn't intend to conflate THESE boycotts (which you haven't repudiated opposition to) with "censorship," you used the "censorship" framing to discuss them.
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl Or you could just answer the question: Why did you drag the "censorship" boogeyman into a discussion of advertiser boycotts? It's not a complicated question, and I've now asked it three times without an answer.
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl What I see in this series of tweets is you characterizing Nate's opposition to boycotts as "oppos[ing] censorship," then saying boycotts are "blurrier" than "STATE censorship." (Emphasis added.) Which is not, in fact, an answer to my question.
@DavidIDean In this tweet, Glenn characterizes Nate's opposition to boycotts as "oppos[ing] censorship." https://t.co/vxoHwZCAzt
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl So why are you dragging the "censorship" boogeyman into a discussion of advertiser boycotts?
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl Also, CORE used threats of client company boycotts to force ad agencies to integrate their campaigns. That worked too.
Also, CORE threatened boycotts against major ad agency clients in 1963 to press the agencies to integrate their advertising. That worked too.
@brainmist They dubbed in Geena's voice—that's why it was so effective.
@ggreenwald @karengeier @hasanthehun @JordanUhl I know you're gonna say the Montgomery bus boycott was different, but activists picketed and boycotted Woolworth's nationwide to get their southern stores to desegregate.
Students and activists in the north picketed Woolworth's in their home towns to put pressure on the chain to desegregate in the south. Corporate boycotts were a tactic of the Civil Rights Movement, and an effective one. https://t.co/3bgFRzMgKv
@BCDreyer @hels @vespabelle @emilynagoski "Regift" is a thing of beauty.
@BCDreyer @hels @vespabelle @emilynagoski Hell, I'll make the case. BD's use of the transitive "gift" is bad, because "give" would have been clear in context. But "give" and "give as a gift" are distinct concepts, and where it's important to make the distinction concisely, "to gift" is useful, and thus good.

@alyssaharad Basically the idea is that this law exists for sitting judges to address the actions of other sitting judges.

@timeoutofmind64 Oh, I'm sure L&amp;S was cheesy as hell. That's a whole other question, though.
We all got fed a lot of bullshit about gender and sexuality in the 1970s, but Laverne DeFazio was out there fighting for justice. For real.
@alyssaharad Yes. But they only have jurisdiction over judges who remain judges while the complaint is being adjudicated. If someone brings a complaint against you and you retire, the investigation ends.
I'm sure if I went back and watched again I'd find cringeworthy stuff, but thinking about the impression her character left on me as a pre-adolescent boy, I've got nothing but positive memories—a surprising number of them formative, in retrospect.
Laverne was a badass. Ride-or-die for her friends. Happily, exuberantly eccentric. Unapologetically sexual as a not-conventionally-beautiful single woman of the late fifties. Abrasive, aggressive, but warm-hearted and loving. Flawed and vulnerable but strong as steel.
Thinking a lot about Penny Marshall's Laverne today, particularly in the context of thinking about creepy 1970s pop culture yesterday. She was such a breath of fresh air.
@SFoskett Wouldn't have mattered anyway. The worst that would have happened is censure.
@DawgsWillHunt Yes, but the authority of the Act isn't retroactive—you have to still be a judge when the complaint is brought and adjudicated.
Only congress can remove a district, circuit, or SCOTUS justice from office. Even if these complaints had been legally able to go forward, he wouldn't have been facing anything worse than censure.
Also: The judicial council that would have reviewed his actions wouldn't have had the power to remove him from the bench anyway, even if the law covered SCOTUS justices.
@ChrisConwayDC The problem isn't that the law doesn't provide a mechanism for holding him accountable. The problem is that the Senate GOP is going to refuse to use the mechanisms the law provides.
@jinbmore No. Kavanaugh can be punished for his misconduct, just not under this specific law.
Basically what the ruling today says is that Kavanaugh is no longer under the jurisdiction of the act in question. Accordingly, the ruling requested that the complaints be forwarded to relevant congressional committees for consideration.
The Judicial Conduct and Disability Act applies to federal judges (not SCOTUS justices) during their tenure as judges. When they retire, are forced out, or move on to another job, the Act no longer covers them.
A lot of people throwing up their hands about this, but it seems to me to be a straightforward reading of the law in question. https://t.co/dOWbCFYvwf

@cistifellea1 @joshuaxsherman I’m saying that his making the movie under the circumstances in which he made it was a repulsive act, not that the movie itself, taken in isolation, should be censured.
@cistifellea1 @joshuaxsherman I offered no opinions on the movie’s plot, taken in isolation.
@cistifellea1 @joshuaxsherman I’m not calling for censorship. I’m expressing moral revulsion.
@willaful @ahkond I stand by my summary. He falls in love with her despite his own qualms, and none of his friends decisively repudiate the relationship.
@joshuaxsherman @cistifellea1 Making a huge Hollywood movie about your girlfriend without giving her a heads-up—when you’re in your 40s and wildly famous and she’s in her mid-teens—is fucked up.
@CAwkward I’ve seen criticism of the piece, but I’m with you. The author got a LOT on the page.
RT @CAwkward: @studentactivism Writer of that piece did a good job of honoring her point of view and making her the center of her own story…
@CAwkward Yeah. I thought I had a handle on his character already, but each of those was ... revealing.
@cistifellea1 Manhattan is based on a real-life relationship that began as statutory rape, and it falsifies the details of that relationship to turn Allen’s sexual use of a teenager into a romance, filmed without her permission. That’s not reproachable enough for you?
RT @sadydoyle: I swear I was 18 when I read in a Woody Allen bio that Mariel Hemingway's character in "Manhattan" was based on a real girl.…
@flycat636 Yeah.
The reality was that he was stringing along a group of young girls, some underaged, keeping them isolated from friends and colleagues and in the dark about his work—even when he was making a movie about them.
The (already gross) story of Manhattan is one of a middle-aged man who serendipitously falls in love with a teenager, winning his friends’ welcoming approval.
And since I see the original tweet is a little obscure if you haven’t read the story: The woman who just came forward as a (one of several, it’s now clear) sources for the Tracy character says he never spent time with her around his friends.
The fact that Tracy is a composite character really says it all.
And again, note that Allen was maintaining multiple simultaneous sexual relationships with teenagers throughout his forties. Imagine how different a movie Manhattan would be if it hadn’t hidden that fact.
@sbelcap Quickest way to answer a question like that is to do a Twitter search. Big story on WA just dropped this morning.
@serenebabe Yeah.
@stephens_ben A lot of us assumed for a while that the relationship was the fantasy. Turns out the relationship was real, and the friendships around it were the fantasies.
@anonymously_all Neither of those facts had emerged when I tweeted.
“The heart wants what it wants,” says Woody. In his case, it turns out that the middle-aged heart wants lots of threesomes with teen models just above or below the age of consent.
One thing that leaps out in the new Woody Allen exposé: “Manhattan” was a fantasy in which his friends were interested in hanging out with him in the company of the kids he was screwing.

@KTKeith Also quite a bit fewer "I don't vote" types than I would have predicted.
@KTKeith If I'd have been guessing, I'd have guessed that something like 30-40% of the people who follow me would say "If X runs, that's who I'm voting for" at this point in the cycle.
@pokereleran Yes, clearly that was my purpose.

@kujakupoet Yes, I too wish Twitter polls were more granular.
@pointblaek I suspect I have a LOT of Bernie supporters who are still keeping an open mind about who they'll pull the lever for in 2020. Just a hunch.
@kujakupoet "Not voting" of necessity includes everyone who isn't voting, for whatever reason. And yes, I wish Twitter polls were more granular.
I'm fascinated by the results of this poll so far. They're not all that similar to what I would have expected. https://t.co/y7oOrR9LJI
@Larkin2112 If I had found a word that encorporated everything from "usually" to "rarely" without seeming to lean in one direction or the other, I would have used it. "Sometimes" was the best I could find.
@Larkin2112 But there are lots of people who consider themselves Democrats but don't consider themselves left. Far more than those who consider themselves "left" but are party-line Dem voters in all situations. In my experience.
@Larkin2112 And for the THIRD time, there is nothing in "sometimes" to imply "rarely." Period. You're making that up and putting it on me.
@Larkin2112 There are only four options in a Twitter poll. If I'd had five or six I'd have worded it differently. And poll answer options have to be short—"sometimes" was the best I found for "may or may not vote Dem, depending on circumstances."
RT @brosandprose: I once asked someone I’d been on one date with to stop texting me while I was at work because the notifications were dist…
@Larkin2112 There's no implication in the poll that those on the left rarely or never vote Dem, and the results of the poll show that in my sample, the overwhelming majority of those on the left are open to voting Dem.
@Larkin2112 (And there's a HUGE difference between "sometimes" and "rarely." "Sometimes encompasses the whole wide swath between "most of the time" and "almost never."
@Larkin2112 I don't use the word "centrist." I'm distinguishing between people who primarily identify as Democrats and those who primarily identify as leftists. As you can see from the poll, the overwhelming majority of the latter who've responded are open to voting Dem.
@lsockett1 The point of this thread isn't to browbeat people into adopting your approach to politics.
@Larkin2112 Why?
@DeathCar72 It leaves open all three possibilities. Maby you don't vote all the time. Maybe you go 3P or write-in when all the Dem options disgust you. Maybe you vote R in protest.
@agtmadcat I'd put that under "sometimes," where "sometimes" incorporates "pretty much all the time."
@lsockett1 Most people don't vote in primaries, so it's pretty clearly a choice.
@DeathCar72 "Vote for the leftmost candidate in any election who has a plausible path to victory" is advice I've seen a lot.
One more: What best describest your relationship to politics:
@TheMezcalJones This is the thing! I've got candidates I like a lot more than others, but there's a long time between now and when voting happens, and I'm sure my attitudes will change.
@RebekahWriter That's why I put "assuming they run" in the question.
(As always, not interested in debating the 2020 elections here. Just curious as to general attitudes and approach among the people reading this.)
If you're definitely going to vote in the 2020 prez primaries, are you sure who you want to vote for (assuming they run)?
Have you decided whether you're voting in the 2020 primaries yet?

And honestly, that's also part of why I do it. Because I—I, specifically—can.
And yes, as a couple people have noted, my gender plays a big role in my freedom to do this, and in the way people respond when I do.
@NeolithicSheep Yeah. It's a calculated decision on those grounds—part of why I do it is to let people who need to hear it but don't hear it for once.
How someone responds when you tell them you're not interested in talking to them is really quite revealing, it turns out.
At that point, most people wander off, or say "okay bye," or something. And if they don't do any of those things—if they try to keep the argument going when I've said I want to stop—then that tells me a lot about them and tells me I'm on solid ground blocking them.
So when someone is really irritating me and it's clear we're not going to make any further headway, I just tell them I'm not interested in continuing the discussion.
I don't feel the need to win an argument on here, but I do find that I often need some kind of closure, particularly if I've invested some time and energy.

Those kinds of stories rewire your brain. They give you insights—into the past, and into the present and the future, too—that you could never get any other way. And they're invaluable for that reason.
Not bad unexpected, not traumatic unexpected, and not romantic unexpected, either. Just alien. Different. Outside my experience.
But without going into detail (maybe some other time), what it told me about their relationship—about the way people like them approached romance and sexuality at that time, in that place—was utterly unexpected.
He wrote it before they were married, and from the narrative I think he may have written it at a moment when they had broken up, or were thinking about breaking up. It's a sad story.
When I was a lot younger, I stumbled across a file in my grandfather's papers—a short story he wrote when he was in college. It was autobiographical, and it was about his relationship with my grandmother.
Particularly for a story like this, which is so resonant and yet so elusive, the last thing you want to do is just make stuff up—to put your make-believe in the place in people's brains where they store what they think they know about the past.
It's experiencing hundreds, thousands, of small stories that allows each us to acquire that sort of a gut sense of how a particular time and place in the past would have worked, and so telling the details of those stories accurately is essential.
I'm far from an expert in the time and place where this story is set, but the details of (for instance) the reburial rang powerfully false to me. It just didn't feel like the way that process would have transpired.
And if you make that up—if you write letters from lovers who didn't exist, say, based on your fantasies of what they might have said, rather than research into what men like them DID say—you're not just painting a false picture, you're erasing the truth.
A big part of the power of a story like this is the window it gives us into the lives of the protagonists—what it tells us about what it was like to be young and in love with another man in Central Europe a hundred years ago.

Someone should write something placing this incident in the same genre as all the dubious /r/relationships stories that have been making the rounds recently. There are new genres of folklore emerging, and it's fascinating to watch it happen in real time.
In all honesty, if the latter chapters of the story hadn't turned quite so preposterous—and if he'd provided a more plausible account of how he learned it all—I probably would have fallen for the whole thing.
And because the story didn't come from an English-speaking country, I couldn't read the various documents, either—and trying to track down the true story was going to wind up being arduous.
There's also something really interesting about the role of translation here. Because I read an amateur translator's version of the thread, I wasn't sure how much of what I was reading was an accurate version of the original author's words.
It's not just photoshop and other kinds of visual and auditory manipulation we need to worry about these days. That thread was a perfect example of how real, unaltered artifacts and documents can be put to work in the service of a lie on social media.

@Ethnography911 Absolutely. And what was extraordinary about the thread was all the documentary "evidence" he provided, starting with the gravestone but sprawling out in all directions.

@mikesphar He made mouth noises, but I didn't see an apology in any of the coverage I've read. And when he made the "I've addressed this before, I'm not going to do it again" video last night, he didn't say he'd already apologized, just that he didn't want to rehash it.

@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman They also tweeted this, this year. https://t.co/oM4B9gDY8a
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Jesus Christ. https://t.co/YnyWBqDfgU
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman As I indicated above, they tweeted that he "asked but we never said yes." It was on November 10, 2017, the day after the NYT story broke. I'm not linking to their account, because I don't want to open them up to more harassment, but you can easily find it through a search.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Believe what you want to believe. But your original claim was that he never masturbated in front of someone without receiving permission, and two of his victims say you're wrong about that.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman The gawker piece says he "stood in front of the door, blocking their way with his body." I didn't say he committed the crime of sexual assault. And the women he masturbated in front of in Aspen said on Twitter that he "asked but we never said yes."
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman I'm not making any assumptions. I've been told explicitly by one of the women he accosted in Aspen that she didn't give consent, and you've offered no evidence to contradict that other than the Gawker summary, which itself says he prevented those women from leaving the room.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Also, if you believe the Gawker piece is an accurate account, it says he physically blocked their way and prevented them from leaving until he came. That's not consent.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Again: EVEN HE DIDN'T CLAIM HE ALWAYS RECEIVED CONSENT. And if you don't think he worded that statement extremely carefully, I don't know what to tell you.
@DanNaturman Again, you're speaking to the people who are comfortable hanging around him, which is exactly the point I began with.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman The Gawker piece doesn't claim to be a first-hand account.
@DanNaturman Okay. Fine. Just one last question. Do you admit that CK has habitually sexually abused female comedians? Because you've been silent on that question throughout our conversation.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Note that he here (1) doesn't say he got consent, just that he asked, and (2) is only referring to instances where he exposed himself to women, not to when he masturbated on the phone with them.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman That's from the Gawker blind item. The women in question have said on Twitter that they did not consent.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Also, what he did in Aspen was absolutely a violation of Colorado state law.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman You're mistaken. There is no claim, from him or anyone else, that he received permission before masturbating on the phone with AS. And DG and JW have said explicitly that they never gave him permission to masturbate in front of them.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman HE claimed he asked permission of some of them. Some of them say he never asked, others say he asked but didn't wait for an answer.
@Nlitend_1 @DanNaturman Nope. That's not what they said.
@DanNaturman Abusers commit their crimes where and when they think they can get away with it, and your refusal to so much as entertain the possibility that he might put his colleagues at risk illustrates precisely why that is.
@DanNaturman I didn't ask you whether you've ever seen him harass anyone at the Comedy Cellar. I asked you whether his history of sexually abusive behavior specifically targeted toward female comedians suggests he may pose a greater threat to female comedians than to other women.
@DanNaturman Do you or do you not agree that what is known of his history suggests that he represents a greater threat to female comedians than to waitresses at random restaurants?
@DanNaturman We're not talking about him being a customer at a random restaurant. We're talking about him performing at a comedy club as a man with a long history of sexually abusive behavior toward female comedians in and around the workplace.
@DanNaturman How do you know there's never been an incident with Louis at the CC? Did you know about the other incidents before they went public? And yeah, if I owned a restaurant and a guy came in who I knew had a hobby of showing his dick to waitresses, I'd kick him out. Wouldn't you?

PETA wants your hate clicks. They're playing the heel. They're annoying on purpose. That's their business model.

@gpmominoh @flycat636 It was a sleeveless tee, which is a bit of a different thing, particularly in this context. But he also doesn't deny making the comments about seeking release, which in her description strike me pretty clearly as a clumsy, tone-deaf sexual pass.
@flycat636 I wouldn't want to be defending a sexual harassment suit from the assistant, particularly since he says in his post that he made the "If I hug you I might just want more" remark to her (1) multiple times and (2) in the workplace.

@gpmominoh There are a LOT of damning-if-true specifics in the assistant's account that he neither admits or denies, which feels like the opposite of transparency to me.
As is so often the case, the denial sounds a lot better if you don't pay close attention to the specifics of the allegations. But even in isolation, Tyson's (for instance) admission of and explanation for "If I hug you I might just want more" is bizarre.

@banditelli @jacobinmag Or a, what, sixty-tweet thread?
@KillerMartinis @nothingsmonstrd @sunlightwarden I think the Miami Herald's reporting this week advanced the story in significant ways. But yeah, the basic outlines were known to anyone who cared to know long before my first comments on the case a in 2017.
All of which is his right. But just as he has has the right to take blood money from whoever he pleases, befriend whichever rapists he chooses, and contribute to the perversion of justice however he likes, the rest of us have the right to draw inferences based on those choices.
And he did it for money, and he did it out of friendship with the monster he defended. And he's still swanning around making threats against people who dare to criticize him for it, years later.
Second, this was of course no ordinary case. As recent reporting has reminded us, it was deeply corrupted by Epstein's wealth and political connections. It was a travesty of justice, and one that Dershowitz eagerly signed up to participate in.
And of course many of Epstein's victims were even younger than sixteen.
(Proven how, you ask? Well, a search by the police turned up one of her high school transcripts. She was 16 when he raped her. He was fifty.)
And I say "victim" rather than accuser here intentionally, because the child I'm discussing specifically in the above tweet was later proven to have been telling the truth when she said she'd been at Epstein's house.
To begin with, Dershowitz's work for Epstein wasn't just standard defense attorney stuff. It included—just for instance—hiring PI's to hassle Epstein's victims, then dragging their names through the mud with the cops when they complained about it.
A year ago, when I posted the original thread, and again this week, a bunch of people have suggested that Dershowitz was just doing ordinary defense attorney stuff in his work for Epstein, and shouldn't be criticized for that. 		Yeah, no.
Since the tweet above and the thread linked below are blowing up again this morning, I just want to say one thing about them. https://t.co/NUUefMTDki
@HobartGus @AlanDersh He's a famous guy who helped a serial child rapist—who was a friend of his—go free, using scumbag blame-the-victim tactics. And he keeps threatening to sue people who call him out over it. So I called him out over it, and dared him to sue me.

@pkcapitol YOU MADE IT ABOUT MISSISSIPPI.
@sknolle Yes!
Anne Bancroft walked into The Graduate and said “I’m going to make a completely different movie than the one everyone else is making, except in scenes where the script makes it literally impossible.” And then she did it. AND NOBODY STOPPED HER BECAUSE SHE WAS INVISIBLE TO THEM.
@pkcapitol Again, the question is whether Mississippi fits your model of underperforming milquetoast old-guard candidates, not whether that characterization applies to other races.

@gpmominoh I'm not in the habit of making predictions about what's going to happen a year and a half from now in American politics.
Franken's sexual misconduct on the USO tour wasn't just caught on camera, it was performed for a photographer. Even if some of the other allegations against him were less conclusive, that fact colored them all.
And of course Franken never articulated a defense that would allow his colleagues to support him with confidence. In the absence of that, mounting pressure for his resignation was inevitable.

@confusedcharlot By "right now," I mean with the primary race about to heat up. Aside from the folks who have been gunning for her all along, several of the senators who were on her side at the time are potential candidates against her in the 2020 race.
I understand the perspective of people who think Franken should have stuck around to defend himself, but it's important to acknowledge how little support he had among his fellow senate Dems by the time he quit. Gillibrand wasn't out on a limb.
@AlexMAbroad My recollection is that Chuck waited until later in the day, once the result was pretty much inevitable, but I could be wrong.
But it's not really in anyone's interest to point out that Gillibrand was part of a team right now, so you wind up with coverage like this, which misrepresents the history in a major way. https://t.co/8h8nIsYatP
Nobody's written a deep-dive history of how the Franken thing went down yet, but coverage at the time made it clear that Gillibrand was the spokesperson for a substantial fraction of the caucus, not a lone wolf.
A lot of people believe Gillibrand acted on her own against Franken. That's demonstrably false. She was one of a group of a half dozen women senators who coordinated their responses.

"I loved the role because I felt that as long as I stayed tasteful within his majesty and size, i could go to the moon with him. And each day I found myself more liberated." —Frank Langella on playing Skeletor in _Masters of the Universe_.
Langella appears to be doing the interview from his living room, by the way. The chair he's sitting in is draped with a handmade quilt.
"Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of evil?" is a line Langella still relishes—and can still call up unbidden—all these years later.
"It became very important to me that I not say silly, foolish things, that I find inspiration in some of the great writers."
Langella did insist on extensive rewrites to his part, and he wound up improvising a lot of it, so at least he was pleased with how that went.
RT @RebelScumTR8R: @Robert_Mason_SF @studentactivism https://t.co/4G3GmblUPi

"I was a young man and I was in fabulous shape, and so I had them design a costume so you could see the pecs and the legs and all of that. I *wanted* that. In a lot of the cartoons, Skeletor is undressed." —Frank Langella
He's clearly still miffed about it, thirty years later.
Frank Langella is on my TV expressing chagrin that the producers of the He-Man movie wouldn't let him be sexy as Skeletor.
We talk a lot in my classes about how the survival strategies of cultural minorities get warped and distorted when they're described by members of dominant cultures, and popular discussions around Chau's death are (among other things) that ramped up by orders of magnitude.
A lot of people don't get as far as "if Chau had coughed on one of these people he just might have wound up kiling them all" in their understanding, but even that is basically square one.
What happened to John Allen Chau was historically contingent. It was shaped not only by interactions between the Sentinelese and outsiders over the last 150 years (and, presumably, beyond), but by historical forces on the island as well.
Because the vast majority of what would make up such a history is unknown to outsiders. There are volumes that could be written—untold hours worth of stories that are being told on that island right now—that the rest of us can have no access to.
When you frame it that way—as "a history of the Sentinelese people over the last 150 years"—it immediately becomes obvious how partial and inadequate it is, right?
What @RespectableLaw has written in this thread is the halting, fragmentary start to a history of the Sentinelese people over the last 150 years.
The assumption that neolithic peoples live outside of time and history is incredibly widespread. "Incredibly," because a moment's thought will make clear that the assumption is false, must be false.
One thing that leaps out at me from this amazing, fascinating thread: How much of the chatter about the people of North Sentinel Island has assumed that the community has no history. https://t.co/WuVs9iw9rS

@mcbyrne Yeah, I absolutely agree. And I think the whole "start at cc, finish at a four-year" thing is really really bad for a bunch of different reasons.
@anthoknees Click. https://t.co/iukwvwAALm
@NeolithicSheep We do. I was going to give a free-college talk this month at which I was going to use them as a launching point, but it got rescheduled.
@mcbyrne I'm not saying community college is the be-all and end-all. I was using it as an example of a higher ed sector that serves those most in need and most at risk. (I also teach at a community college, so cc students' struggles are very visible to me.)

@SallyLHudson https://t.co/pzJIpEEapX
@SallyLHudson I think you and I disagree less than David and I, but I'll leave you with this: Any claim that full debt student forgiveness (for all) is bad because it's regressive should state plainly that full debt forgiveness (for many) is a worthy progressive alternative.
@SallyLHudson My view is that a retrospective debt forgiveness program should be implemented as part of a shift to free public higher ed. That looks very different than a debt forgiveness plan that's intended to apply to future debt as well as past debt.
@SallyLHudson There's a big difference between debt forgiveness that's linked to a program of free public higher ed looking forward, and debt forgiveness that isn't. They're fundamentally different beasts.
@DLeonhardt @SallyLHudson Do you think that full student debt forgiveness for poor and working class people—however defined—is a policy goal worthy of support? If so, why didn't you say so in the column? And if not, isn't your "regressiveness" argument against debt forgiveness a red herring?
@SallyLHudson @DLeonhardt I think the distinction matters a lot. "Poor and working class people should have full student debt forgiveness" is—empirically, politically, and symbolically—a very different position than the one he lays out in the column, and so far in his tweets in this thread.
@SallyLHudson @DLeonhardt Saying "people whose income is below a certain threshold should have some of their debt forgiven" instead of "...should have their debt forgiven" isn't an accident, or an oversight. It's a policy preference.
@SallyLHudson @DLeonhardt He makes that argument in the piece, as I said in the thread (and as I just said again in response to his tweet).
@DLeonhardt Because you say so explicity, as I said later in the thread. "People whose income is below a certain threshold should have some of their debt forgiven." Some of. Not all of. Some of. Those are your words. In the piece.
@ConorConneally Optimist.
@btrwkart Five minutes of googling left me none the wiser.
"Take the money you'd use to retire UMC-and-above college graduates' undergrad debt and use it to pay for books, childcare, and living-expense stipends for every community college student in the country" is a left argument. 		This column ain't that.
What this thread is about is the fact that the column under discussion is pretending to be an attack on the idea from the left, but is actually an attack from the right. Which is not at all uncommon in this arena.
And again, since folks are piping up, reasonable people can disagree about whether eliminating ALL student debt is solid progressive policy. That's not what this thread is about.
As is your tweet. https://t.co/2A3uf3wdk0
@mistressmatisse I live to serve.
"Eliminate student debt and make college free" may not be exactly what I'm looking for—or exactly what we'd get out of the process—but as a soundbite, it's a whole hell of a lot better than "elimination of all student debt...is a bad idea."
My own view is that public higher education should be made free, and that as part of that project the student debt that exists should be forgiven. And that yes, that project should start with the debt of those who most need relief.
And no, he never explains why.
(my emphasis)
Not actually joking, by the way. The piece is all about how we shouldn't eliminate student debt for the wealthy, but when he finally gets to the debt of the poor, he says this:		"People whose income is below a certain threshold should have SOME OF their debt forgiven."
"We shouldn't eliminate student debt, because rich people would benefit."	"So we should eliminate student debt for the poor?"	"No, not that either."	"Why not?"	"Sorry, going through a tunnel!" https://t.co/Q54t2KHS1f
@KevinCarter42 @KevinMKruse The murder rate in Chicago dropped by 25% in 2017, and it's on track to drop by another 20% in 2018. Just in case you were wondering.
@KevinCarter42 @sexygirl798 @KevinMKruse The fact that you imagine that nobody—no activists, no organizations, no community leaders—are doing anything about violence in Chicago suggests that you have some research of your own to do.
@Jeremy10036 It's an interesting question, not least because it's a large enough figure that you'd start butting up against diminishing returns. But I'd start with CUNY.
