Hopefully you enjoyed my live tweets. Figured I'd try something different. Now back to my one to two tweets a day. Thanks everyone!
Both candidate's wives picked similar dress colors, pink. Both look lovely.
Debate is over:(
Obama:I want to fight for them (people who are struggling/middle class).
Obama: I believe everyone should have a fair shot,we should all play by same rules. I believe Gov. Romney is a good man. Loves his family...
Romney: I will get incomes up. We don't have to settle for $4 gas prices, 47 million people on welfare...
Romney: I understand that I can get our country on track again. We don't have to settle for 50% college kids who can't get work...
Romney: I care about 100% of people. I understand what it takes to make US prosperous. I believe we are all children of same God.
Barry Green: What is the biggest misperception people have about you as a man and as a candidate?
@bruiser_ham I say war
@bruiser_ham naw
Obama: There are some jobs that just aren't going to come back #keepingitreal
Coming down to the final question. Any thoughts on what is will be?
I want to hear more about these alleged investments the Pres has in China dealing with his pension....hmmmmm.
Obama: I want to close loopholes that allow companies to avoid taxes when they move to China
Romney: On day 1 I will label China a current manipulator. This will allow me to put in tariffs.
@mattwargo I did:)
Carol Goldberg: What plans do you have to put jobs and keep jobs in the United States?
@mattwargo Thanks Matt. You look like Chris May in your twitter pic:)
"folks" seems to be the word of the day for both the Pres and Gov.
Romney on guns: We need moms and dads helping to raise kids. Before they have babies think about marriage...lead to lower poverty rates
Obama: I want a comprehensive strategy part of it is is to get guns out of the wrong hands and catch violent impulses before violence occurs
Obama: Weapons designed for soldiers don't belong on our streets.
Background crowd is getting pumped and Moderator had to help set the facts straight
Hey did you guys see First Lady in the crowd. Where's Romney's wife?
Obama on Libya...I'm the President and I'm responsible.
@CBSPhilly @crowleyCNN pretty good considering the candidates are willing to talk over her to get their point across.
So did the State Department deny security and WHY??? Answer the question!
Obama: "When folks go after Americans, we go after them"
Obama: says he wanted to beef up security at every consulate.
Kerry Ladka: State Department refused extra security in Libya. Who denied it and why?
Romney asked Obama if he looks at his pension. Obama smiles and says, no my pension isn't as big as yours so it doesn't take me as long.
Had to come back early!!!
Taking a 10 min break tweet peeps.
@JustGregPoet Too bad you didn't get invited. You would have for sure busted out with a Poem! You should try to get on next time:)
Obama: We need to fix a broken immigration system. First thing we did is streamline immigration process.
Can they get her name right?
Romney: I would not give driver's license to people who have come here illegally as the President has done.
Romney: We should give green cards to people who are useful to America
Lorraine Osorio: What will Romney do with immigrants who have green cards who are productive?
Romney: When Obama took office there were 20 million on welfare. Now Romney says 47 million are on welfare.
@PennBannekar a tad over 2...I'm well:)
@tjholmes ooooooo, yeah (in my janet jackson voice)
Obama: Admits it's been tough. We've created 5 million jobs, saved an auto industry on the brink of collapse.
Michael Jones: A voter who has lost confidence in the President. Everyday living is tough.
Obama: Differences are not on economic policies
Obama: There are some things where Romney and Bush are different
Romney: Pres. Bush had a very different plan for a very different time. My plan is to grow small business.
Back to question..Romney: My party has been championing big business too long. I'm for small business
Romney: Every women in America should have access to contraceptives. Wow! I don't think he's ever taken such a position like that.
Susan Katz: I attribute economic problems to policies during Bush admin. What are the differences between Romney and Bush?
Obama is standing up....
But how do you make it FAIR?!!!
Romney: Tells story of how we made a conscious effort to find women to fill leadership roles in his cabinet when he was Gov.
Obama: Women are increasing bread winners. 	Me: Women are holding it down!!!!
Katherin Fenton: Basically asks how to make workplace fair. Why do men still make more than men for doing the same job?
@langstonwalker I think you should donate all your savings to the poor:)
Romney: the numbers do add up.
Candy: If the numbers don't add up would you be willing to look at 20% again?
First 33 minutes....who is winning in your opinion?
Obama: The cost of lowering rates 20%(Romney's plan), costs more money than it's worth according to the President.
@berman what movie is that from. I never buy by the gallon (lol)
Obama: If we are serious about reducing deficit, we have to make sure wealthy do more (I think he meant debt)
Obama: I want to give middle class families and those striving to get to middle class, some relief
Romney: I will reduce tax burden
Romney: "I will not increase taxes on the middle class."
Romney: says he will give an amount as to how much money you can deduct...he randomly through out $2500
Romney's answer...I want to get relief to middle income famlies
Mary Follano wants to know what deductions Romney will cut
What question would you ask?
Gas prices were 1.86 when Obama took office? Time flies. It feels like I've been paying at least 2.50 for a while now.
Romney just basically told Obama to sit down! What! "You'll get your chance in a minute," said Romney.
Romeny shouldn't turn his back to audience...it's about the people!
There both standing awfully close to each other
Are they about to fight!
Pres: we are drilling on more public lands. He says Gov. said at one point that "coal kills" and now he's a proponet for coal??
Romney says lets take advantage of energy resources we have
Romney, "I want to make sure we use our coal, gas, nuclear, renewable."
Jeremy will not be unemployed when he graduates (lol)
Natural gas production is up, coal employment is up...have to look to futures says Pres.
Phillip Tricolla asks question about energy
That's right Candy...keep the ball rolling
it's getting a little heated
hard to get specific in two minutes
President's response: Build on what's working, increase access to education....
Jeremy better make sure Romney makes good on his promise if elected.
Romney didn't really answer that one with specifics??
Obama looks engaged
Romney talks about a student from Philly that he met
1st question: how can candidates reassure college students they can support themselves after graduation?
They both look refreshed
