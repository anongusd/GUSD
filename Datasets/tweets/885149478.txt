Mattis spent 45 minutes with President. Before leaving for WH, he watched the president's video with Mr. Trump pointing to the sky saying he was pulling out of Syria for troops who had died. 50 copies of his resignation letter had already been printed, US official tells me. https://t.co/ly0qzfXtRn
It appears Mattis' resignation letter had already been written. I am told Mattis went over to the White House at 3 pm yesterday with his resignation letter in hand. I am told the final straw for Mattis was the President's order to withdraw from Syria.
I am told to expect more resignations at the Pentagon in wake of Mattis. 	 A senior US defense official tells me: ‚ÄúMake no mistake - Mattis is resigning in protest over the President's national security policies," a resignation based on "principle."
Scathing criticism of POTUS Syria withdrawal from Jack Keane, a top candidate to replace Mattis:  ‚ÄúThis is a huge strategic mistake that I hope the President will reconsider and if he does not, I believe with some degree of confidence that he will come to regret this decision.‚Äù
A Military Times poll conducted in late September found that nearly 84 percent of troops had a favorable view of Mattis‚Äô work leading the armed forces. Among officers, the figure was almost 90 percent. https://t.co/4XXkFZHHiy

Senior US defense official: "Mattis was NOT pushed out. This was NOT a forced resignation." He met with the President at 3 pm and delivered letter of resignation.

A senior US defense official tells me they have never seen the morale in meetings at the Pentagon worse than they have in the past few days, following announcement that President Trump is withdrawing from Syria, drawing down in Afghanistan.
A senior US official, tells me President Trump planning a ‚Äúsignificant drawdown‚Äù of US troops in Afghanistan. This source tells me that it would involve MORE THAN 3,000 US troops pulling out. Confirming @glubold @jessdonati WSJ scoop.
I am told that CENTCOM, in particular, Gen Joe Votel, the head of US Central Command, feels "punched in the gut" by the decision to withdraw troops from Syria. US military commanders were "shocked" by the President's decision, but now are making plans to withdraw.
Trump gave military 30 days to pull out. Pentagon chiefs fear the SDF, who fought with US vs ISIS and Kurdish forces to be slaughtered. 	As one senior US defense official put it to me, "no one will ever work or fight with us in the Middle East again." https://t.co/9CoGjpAPHR
Sr US defense official tells me: The President made the decision to pull out of Syria last Fri Dec 14 after speaking with Turkish President Erdogan, who told Trump Turkish forces were planning to enter Syria to go after the Kurdish PKK and warned US troops to get out of the way.

TROOPS TO BORDER: Rules of engagement for these troops have not been established, but order Mattis signed Friday outlines that CBP wants DoD personnel to be in "direct contact with migrants and protestors." "This may present issues under the Posse Comitatus Act," order states.
The US troops, which began arriving today, will set up 3 unified command centers, temporary shelters for up to 2400 CBP personnel. Order signed by Mattis authorizes MREs - Meals Ready to Eat - and riot gear for 500 CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) agents.
Pentagon - not DHS - will pay for deployment of 5000 troops to border. DoD Comptroller is working on cost now. Congress will expect an answer soon. When DoD sent 2000 National Guard to border it cost $185 million. When President Bush sent 6000 National Guard it cost $1.2 billion.
JUST IN: US troops already flowing to border. 800 arrived today. Another 200 to arrive tomorrow. 1700 will be in place by Saturday, according to senior US defense official. 5000 total expected to be sent. Mattis signed order Friday authorizing troops to be there through Dec 15,

Mattis on No Ko war remains: "We have families that when they got the telegram they have never had closure. They have never had the body returned. So what we are seeing here is an opportunity to give those families closure to make sure we continue to look for those remaining."
Mattis on Syria: "There are some nations that have kept Assad in power. We know who they are: Russia and Iran." Re: ISIS fight "It's not over yet....What you don't do is walk away and leave the place as devastated as it is - you don't just leave it and ISIS comes back."
MORE: Mattis: "the forensics will be when we land them in Hawaii where the laboratory is. We have no indication that there is anything amiss but we don't know. We can't confirm one way or another." https://t.co/og8In1Zh5Y
Mattis asked if he has evidence these are US service members remains from North Korea: 	"The reason those remains aren't back to the US right now is that they first are going to be reviewed. Initially, they are in Korea and we'll look for any anomalies for what they might be...."
Mattis on war remains returning from No Ko:  "We also look at it as a first step of a restarted process so we do want to explore additional efforts to bring others home. Perhaps have our own teams go in. They have been in before. We are looking at this as a first step."
Mattis on North Korea returning war remains: "By the way you notice there were UN flags on the boxes.... We don't know who is in those boxes. As we discover it , we will return them. They could go to Australia. They have missing. France has missing. America has missing."
Mattis: "The Dept of Defense swears an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution. We live in a raucous democracy that's what we defend and we will continue to defend and uphold the Constitution and we continue to carry out our duty to protect the country. That's our job." https://t.co/wYk6YXy6s2
My question to Mattis: "Can we get your reaction to recent attacks on the press particularly in the wake of the VFW meeting where the President talked about the press as fake news and then members of the VFW booed the press, what is your reaction to that?"
Mattis would not say whether he recommends 2nd Putin mtg adds: "It's essential that leaders talk to one another. It's essential that we talk with those countries that we have the largest disagreements with. That's how you repair those disagreements." https://t.co/2mc7HdywMB
Mattis: "Even in the worst days of the Cold War we had head of state to head of state discussions &amp; I believe we'e been way overdue for that and this isn't about this administration, this goes back years now. Many years. So I am all for reopening communications at the top line." https://t.co/KoLhEpTIWs
Mattis says he is considering meeting his Russian counterpart. On 2nd Putin summit: "I have always been in favor in fact promoted the idea that we talk with one another...even when we had nuclear missiles pointed at each other and right now they are pointed over open ocean."
Q: "What is the govt doing to halt Russian interference in the next election?"	MATTIS: "Just rest assured there are actions underway to protect our elections to expose external efforts by anybody to influence the American public to show false news that kind of thing."
Q: Could you foresee sending US military personnel back into North Korea for the first time in years to conduct additional search missions. 	MATTIS: "That is certainly under consideration. Absolutely." https://t.co/eFqtb3oTFI
After some remains of US service members returned from North Korea: Mattis says the US is considering sending US military personnel into North Korea to look for more Americans remains killed during Korean War. "This humanitarian act is a step in the right direction."
Mattis on the Pentagon steps moments ago:	Reporter: "Has the President asked you to start working on the ground in Syria militarily?"	Mattis: "No."
I asked Mattis about report US preparing strikes against Iran: 	MATTIS: "I have no idea where the Australian news people got that information. I am confident it is not something that is being considered right now. I think it is a complete, frankly, it's fiction."
Secretary Mattis on Helsinki summit:  "I have talked immediately after the Helsinki summit to both the chief of staff and national security adviser called me. I wouldn't say immediately, but as soon as they got free. There have been no policy changes that have come out of it."

Haspel looks set to be confirmed after Sen Joe Manchin (D-WVa) says he will vote to confirm: ‚ÄúAfter meeting with Gina Haspel, discussing her extensive experience as a CIA agent, and considering her time as Acting Director, I will vote to confirm her to be our next CIA Director."
A year ago today President Trump fired FBI director James Comey. May 9, 2017 https://t.co/9DV4BIlGR2
Protester removed from Senate confirmation hearing for CIA director nominee Gina Haspel after shouting, "Bloody Gina. You are a torturer."
Sen Heinrich (D-NM) to Gina Haspel: Why not keep a digital record &amp; pixilate the faces of the CIA officers rather than destroy the videos. Haspel: "I never saw the videos....We were worried about unauthorized leaks....the issue was the security issue posed to our officers."
Gina Haspel on post 9/11 interrogation program: "We're not getting back into that business....I would not restart an interrogation program at CIA under any circumstances."
Mattis to Sen Richard Shelby on Senate Armed Services when asked his opinion on North Korea: "These talks could be fruitful."
Mattis on decision to pull out of Iran nuke deal: "not a hasty decision" "been working with allies for a year" hope to "address shortcomings" of the deal.
Mattis on Iran nuke deal during Senate hearing:  "We have walked away from the JCPOA because we found it was inadequate for the long term effort and this was something that was probably noted by the Senate several years ago when the Senate did not endorse it as a treaty."
Haspel corrects Sen Dianne Feinstein who claims the destroyed interrogation tapes showed the interrogation of 92 detainees. Haspel: there were 92 tapes showing the interrogation of one detainee. Facts matter.
In response to questions about her role in destroying interrogation tapes: Gina Haspel to Sen Feinstein: "I never watched the [interrogation] tapes" but "officers faces on the tapes"concerned about "unauthorized leaks" and security of those agents.
CIA director nominee Gina Haspel to Sen Mark Warner: "Senator, my moral compass is strong. I would not allow CIA to undertake activity even if it's technically legal. I would not permit it."
Gina Haspel: "I support the higher moral standard that this country decided to hold itself to. I would never take CIA back to an interrogation program again. CIA follows the law. I support the law. I would not put CIA at risk to take risky controversial activities again."

Trump: History is asking whether we're up to the task. Our answer will be renewal of will, rediscovery of resolve &amp; a rebirth of devotion.
Trump: "We are calling for a great reawakening of nations for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people &amp; their patriotism."
Trump: US pays 22% of UN budget "if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals...,this investment would easily be well worth it."
Trump: US is working "to crush the loser terrorists &amp; stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people."
Trump on Iran Deal: "Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States and I don't think you've heard the last of it, believe me."
Trump to UN: "The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into."
Trump on Iran deal: "we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program."
Trump reconsidering Iran deal: "We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles."
Trump turns sights on Iran: "a corrupt dictatorship" "a rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos."
