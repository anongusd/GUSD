@mboyeast @CNN saw a guy with a Rob Nincovich shirt at the airport yesterday.  Seriously.		Thought about giving him a hug
And I had a couple people shout cheers for @CNN along the way.  		I think they recognized me from my legs.		Only 1 person, shouted anything mean.		But to be fair, I think they actually knew me personally...so that makes sense.
a couple closing thoughts on the Mall run....		Towards the end, I passed the Russell Senate Office Building...which is still the Russell Senate Office Building.  And I guess will always be.  Inertia is powerful...	Remember, it could be the McCain building if they wanted.  	(more)
yeah yeah, I know this is an unusual time to complain about royal weddings...but I am doing it mostly because my co-anchor is not on twitter.		And also because I mostly mean it.		I sort of think it is related to all this.		(more)
And the you see the Capitol....the most beautiful building in the world.  To me at least.		Whenever I see it, I think, "I am so glad we did this."		That means I am so glad we don't have kings and queens and royal weddings.		(more)
now the Washington Monument also struck me as particularly interesting today.		I ran at it from both the right and the left.  And you know what?  it looked the same from both sides.		I think there is a metaphor there (at least I did 6 miles into the run) 		(more)
This is the point during the run where I observe that the Mall is very flat.		This tells me that the Founding Fathers did not want us to do any hill work.		(more)
It sort of feels like it is saying, "yes we can do this, so long as we ALL do it.  If we all stand together, we can succeed."		And I will note, the pillars are not arranged in red states and blue states.		(more)
At the other of the Reflecting pool from the Lincoln Memorial is now the World War II Memorial.  I am a big fan.		It is encircled by big granite pillars with every state chiseled in stone.  		The way it is situated, it's like an answer to Lincoln's challenge.  		(more)
And when you walk the steps, the Memorial is filled with tourists from all over the world.  It is as if THEY know how remarkable this thing is that we have accomplished, even if sometimes we take it for granted.		(more)
And to be clear, he is look out at ALL of us.  His gaze is not to the White House, which it could be....just to the left of where he is sitting.  It is out, at the American people.  		(more)
I am always struck by how Lincoln is gazing over us.  Watching.  		It is almost a challenge.  Can we "bind up the nation's wounds?" as he implored us to do.

Kavanaugh has issued a full denial.  And that is important.  		But worth thinking about the message this sends to victims of sexual assault who choose to wait to tell their stories.		Does this send a message that they will be heard?		It’s from the President of the United States. https://t.co/Brb0lfJT2s
To be clear, Kavanaugh has issued full denial.		But this is saying, if Blasey didn't file charges, it must not have happened. 		We know that sex assault victims often remain silent for years.  We know that.		This is a HUGE departure from the restraint POTUS was praised for. https://t.co/TIN6WWk6Xi

@jaketapper main takeaway...you are old
@realDonaldTrump To be clear...what is interesting here...is that @AlanDersh--who often makes the case that POTUS should not be in trouble in Russia investigation-- says that he is VERY MUCH in jeopardy with Cohen matter.
Notable from@AlanDersh this morning, who often defends @realDonaldTrump.		He says the Michael Cohen situation puts POTUS in a real legal bind. (and in jeopardy)		And is very critical of Cohen defense team.		https://t.co/Y4qgTtCSUu
@AshleyRParker sometimes when you have to go, you have to go....and write it.
@robert158 @AlanDersh @realDonaldTrump Dersch says if President claims attprney privilege...he could be in trouble for Cohen recordings.  If he doesn't...then he has no standing to eliminate evidence
