@Bennythesnitch @TideFanJoe @GOP But as the private investor loans increase again, the failures will come again.
@Bennythesnitch @TideFanJoe @GOP And it takes in average 5 years for homes to start a foreclosure avalanche.   As the regulations were lifted in the last year.  I have seen this happen for the exact same reasons twice before.   That is an opinion piece if I hope it doesn't happen again.
@Bennythesnitch @TideFanJoe @GOP Those were lifted by trump.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP People, made decisions to do negative amortizing loans.  No one was "forced".  Fraud was running rampant, those were through primarily brokered loans.  You need to stop speaking on real estate .  You know shit. And are promoting lies.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP 1000s if banks were not destroyed because if Fannie.  They were destroyed on their private funded portfolios.  When the market tanked, it affected all sides if market because it affected everything and consumers were greedy and stupid.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP No Democrats had nothing to do w the high risk loans.  It was because Republicans lifted glass steagal and dodd Frank.  Essential lifting consumer protections.  No party governs Fannie, Freddie, FHA or va.  Those guidelines are 8n place and adjusted through bi partisanship.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP No it starts going down.  It is a short term cut and it has been chewed up by the extraordinary costs in gas. And goods due to the tariffs.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP I didn't even vote for Carter.  Your skills of deduction and facts are sorely lacking.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP but are not eligible to be sold in that market.
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP Fannie Mae has NOTHING to do with high risk loans.  No one is forced.  Those loans that do not fall into guidelines are rejected.  High risk loans are serviced from secondary markets, private investors w seperate guidelines.  Some use the auto underwriting program for Fannie
@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP No. Sorry underwriter her for 20 years.  Wrong.

@TideFanJoe @Bennythesnitch @GOP Oh sweetie.  I worked in mortgages for 30 years.  In every job, including loan officer, underwriter and servicer.  Lifting dodd Frank and glass steagal has been done twice before, each time it ended up disastrous. It didnt cost consumers a dime to adhere to rules.

@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec No. He bailed the financial markets, all the funds were paid back.  Bailed out American cars, all paid back.  Yes, he BORROWED MONEY AND IT ALL CAME BACK AND THEN SOME.

That is why they are called progressive.
@supamanxxx360 @DoniJuarez @Breaking911 A really good CEO never has to declare bankruptcy, get investigated by feds, have charity shutdown for illicit use of funds, cheating people out of money because of false claims and have to pay 25 million in restitution.

@AlphaAdams86 @TheView @AprilDRyan You have no extra money.   Good grief.  Unless you are part of the 1 percent you are getting pennies.  Which has all been eaten up by tariff rising costs.
@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec Those regulations did not cost money.  They were consumer protections.  And since you are ignorant of what they were, they are way above your ability to understand the purpose and affect.  I was a mortgage underwriter,  the glass steagal act saved our ass from depression.
@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec When Obama took office it was 9 when he left office it was 4. Now it is 3.5. Whoopee.

Yes, but they do not represent whole groups of people.  That is ridiculous. Is every Republican a pipe bomber? No. Grow up.
@TY23000 @DonWrig64956623 @mocnud01 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec No one told them to harass or throw anyone out.
@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec No.  Read Forbes.
@mocnud01 @TY23000 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec Rme.  No they don't.
@DoniJuarez @supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 There has been absolutely no talk of any of that in this election.  Except on faux news.
@GOP So Kemp in georgia can. Though huh?
@AlphaAdams86 @TheView @AprilDRyan That's is just plain crazy.  Sorry but not one thing you are saying about Obama is legitimate.
@AlphaAdams86 @TheView @AprilDRyan He never promised not to raise taxes.  Quite the opposite.  In order to balance the budget, taxes must be paid.  He raised taxes on the wealthy and corporations.   How did Obama suppress freedom of speech.  He was always polite and informative at his press conferences.
@AlphaAdams86 @TheView @AprilDRyan No, many of those things were never promised at all.  Show me where he said he wouldn't use executive privilege.   That was trump honey.   He didnt spy on citizens. By the Bush administration the Patriot Act allowed for some observation if suspected of Terrorism.
@AlphaAdams86 @TheView @AprilDRyan Who is he?
@mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec There are not sides or views in news. There are only facts.  That is where you are confused.  Facts are true.  The sky is blue. An opinion is you say the sky is blue I think it is beautiful blue.
@supamanxxx360 @DoniJuarez @Breaking911 No, out of the 4 3 were Republicans.
@supamanxxx360 @DoniJuarez @Breaking911 That wasn't fraud on HRC part.  Sanders is a socialist and should not be on the democratic ticket.
@supamanxxx360 @bernade50365738 @Breaking911 No they don't.   I am a Democrat,  and no one I know supports antifa.  They have NOTHING to do with Democrats.
@TY23000 @DonWrig64956623 @mocnud01 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec It shouldn't be taken seriously??  Why not?  He says and does inciting hateful things all the time.  What makes trump special?  He lies...
@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec No they don't  I have never once heard them use those words.
@TY23000 @mocnud01 @DonWrig64956623 @ElizabethMTHC @TheView @AprilDRyan @CNN @POTUS @PressSec No he hasn't.  Reagans economy sucked for one thing. And he is now where close to the Clinton economy.  None of trumps policies have anything to do with the 10 years of upward swing we have had.  10 years.
@supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 You people are flat out nuts!  Nothing you are saying makes sense, your views are more radical than the common man.  Stop watching the ridiculous crap that has no basis in fact.
@OJLovell @supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 No, people will believe whatever fits their agenda despite logic and truth.
@bernade50365738 @supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 Omg.  You are crazy.  Democrats have nothing to do with antifa.  That is ridiculous.   Do you hear how CRAZY that sounds???
@Vern_Eli @supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 What a stupid statement. Are you really that dense?
@DoniJuarez @supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 No they are not. There were 4 cases of voter fraud in the 2016 election.  3 were trump voters. 2 of them voted them twice.   There is NO PROOF of what you say.  Except from the lying lips of fox commentators. 	However there was a lot of voter suppression in this election.
@supamanxxx360 @kimpownow @Fulks24 @Breaking911 Which is why you are not a scotus.
@supamanxxx360 @kimpownow @Fulks24 @Breaking911 What evidence???
@supamanxxx360 @kimpownow @Fulks24 @Breaking911 No he is not an innocent man.
@supamanxxx360 @Breaking911 Please, people in glass houses. Democrats didnt  send pipe bombs to people.
@GingerJ66019714 @Breaking911 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews No he is not honorable.  Honorable people do not tell lies, exaggerate the truth and incite anger.
@Woodbridges25th @Breaking911 That is another stupid statement, and so prejudiced that it makes you look ridiculous.
@GtrDan67 @Breaking911 She did not instigate this.  She told American citizens to ask their Congress members why they are not working for ALL the people.  This is radicals, reacting to the radical speaking.  Both are at fault.
@86753093 @rwgamer @Breaking911 That would be a ridiculous and irresponsible accusation.
@rwgamer @Breaking911 Better question who is inciting this??   Where is the hate starting??

@GovMikeHuckabee @flanagan_aj @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Weasel
@dbongino @flanagan_aj Acosta and the other journalists did not make fools of themselves.  Trump acted like a cornered petulant child.
@flanagan_aj @TobyHusseyWA @marcorubio Yes he did.  Because trump would not let him speak.  Through the whole press conference he cut journalists off. Called them names and stomped around the stage.  If he doesn't like getting called out on his lies , he shouldn't lie.
@BillJLibrary Coward, show the video.  A screen shot is total misrepresentation.

@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Puked a little... again
@GOP Then why did the GOP extend the same courtesy they are screaming about for PRESIDENT OBAMA  and MERRICK GARLAND?????
@Incatnito1 @realAliTweets @spiny311 Nah, trump already did that.  This just adds a little more muck to the mud.
@realAliTweets I don't think so.  Too much entitlement running in his very very privileged veins.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Graham is such a weaselly little shit.  Crawl back in your hole.
@lisamurkowski Then how about you do the right thing for America and act like you work for the people and not a party.
@DaddyDaddymac Wow, I guess we know how people feel about this question.
@DaddyDaddymac ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
@GOP @SteveDaines Yea, do not vote for the assholes in the gop.
@SenatorCollins please do not vote Republican,  please vote for America.
@lisamurkowski  Please make sure you vote for the right thing not the Republican thing.  Congress needs to start working for the people, not trump and McConnell.

@SenThomTillis  why didnt you start confirmation hearing for MERRICK GARLAND.  .... HYPOCRITE!
@SenThomTillis 	I disagree with YOU!! Going to California has nothing to do with making a determination.  This AMERICAN wants an FBI investigation! I want Kavanaugh to quit dodging answers.
I find it interesting the the Republicans now don't feel that an FBI investigation does not come to conclusions.  They don't feel that way when it's a Democrat they are investigating.

@JaybeeStewee @MichaelRCaputo @KirstenPowers Yes, but Gorsuch.  Republicans did not follow history or what was even right.  Typical that they can't get right from wrong.
@MichaelRCaputo @KirstenPowers He acted like a baby. A spoiled baby.
He now says.. they didn't laugh at me.  They laughed with me because I am so great.    RULE 25
