@420_organic They are both good options. Seriously too close to call. My answer should be Montana based on my location and fandom, but I am probably more influenced by recent accomplishments made by Brady....
@420_organic My first memory is Montana to Taylor against the Bengals. I have been a Niner fan ever since. I missed the earlier years. The comparison between Brady and Montana is too close to call. The best measuring stick in my mind is ring count.
@420_organic My heart says Montana, but I have a hard time arguing against 6 rings.

The #49ers are trying to win with class? So lying, spreading rumors, firing coaches, and signing criminals is the way to do that?
After attending 1 event at #LevisStadium I now appreciate #AT&amp;TPark even more. Levi's seemed impersonal and cold. Not in a rush to go back.
With 5 mins left in the 2nd I wanted a pretzel, but they were already sold out #disappointed #StadiumSeries #Levis http://t.co/aZRYfsUzSP

The weather at the #PebbleBeachProAm this year is ridiculous. It is usually overcast, raining, and windy. Awesome weather!
Congrats to the New England Patriots, winners of #SuperBowlXLIX. What a great finish to a hard fought game.
The last thing I want to see is a blowout like last year. Make this a close, entertaining game. #SuperBowlXLIX #NFL #Patriots #Seahawks
I am tired of the media naming every controversy "Gate" #NFL #Timetobemorecreative
Please no, not Lane Kiffin. Could there be a worse pick for #Niners OC?
Hoping for the extreme long shot where both road teams win today. #NFLPlayoffs

The #Niners are trying to sign the #Broncos OC as their HC. I for one, would love to have Peyton Manning as SF's head coach. #Sarcasm
As a #Niners fan I don't like the #Cowboys or the #Packers, so I am rooting for a triple overtime game today.
Yup. #fantasychampion in one of my leagues! http://t.co/cnTeKtNd9C
