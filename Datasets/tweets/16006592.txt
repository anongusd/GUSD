@Neoavatara It's not the ones raging I'm complaining about, it's her job not to say anti-Semitic things that provoke people. It's that her instinct seems to be the criticism proves her point, which means this is only going to get worse, because the criticism is not going to stop.
@owillis @BotsonBob There's been continuous liberal criticism of Israeli policy for decades, but there's a reason these particular phrases keep setting off explosions across ideological lines. It's very easy to explain without resorting to these pat explanations.

@DouthatNYT @mattyglesias @allahpundit @SethAMandel More like what's likeliest to happen: "Well, I guess we'll take this infrastructure bill we always wanted to do anyway and make it a 'Green New Deal' bill." Similarly, "I guess we'll  cut taxes a bunch for people and institutions we like to cut taxes for and call it tax reform"
@allahpundit @SethAMandel They were debated and defeated by other ideas! It happens! But the reason we have most landmark policy is someone carried the torch as the ideas person and usually was co-opted by a more pragmatic politician who won later on.
@DouthatNYT @allahpundit @SethAMandel Also yeah, I don't doubt the hardcore GNDers are going to decry what D's come up with as a betrayal. But they also are pretty psyched they're pushing issue to front burner and forcing responses. That's a major part of the activism around it.
@DouthatNYT @allahpundit @SethAMandel Perfect example. Remember when we were all going to be Greece?
@allahpundit @SethAMandel As I've been reporting, this could create a lot of confusion if D's put out bills that don't achieve 10-12 year timeline, assume it was meant to just be a motivator not actual policy, and then activists revolt. But that comes later.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel I mean, her position is her position. But the bill is also a goal, not a detailed plan, and she talks pretty explicitly about how that's designed to get Democrats to push competing ideas out. It's a "request for proposals," her words.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel Actually the best example from Paul might be his push to get rid of all foreign aid, a classic never-gonna-happen applause line that also moves the terms of foreign policy debate and Trump co-opted in some ways.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel Paul and Ted Cruz were good examples as well. Some supporters took various ideas -- defund ACA, balanced budget ASAP -- as deadly serious workable plans. Others as a political tactics to advance discussion. This can create a lot of headaches for leaders managing everyone.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel Totally disagree on the not seeing herself as starting a policy debate point, that's a pretty explicit goal of GND. You raise a separate and related point though, which is some take it literally, others seriously.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel AOC is truly on another level in terms of the frenzy around her, you need to go back to Sarah Palin to find that. But Paul's budgets are a good example of bills that were treated as serious by some, aspirational by others, got press, and forced leadership to respond.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel Yeah, he ran for president because he had become one of the most prominent politicians, obviously in Trump era he has not been as relevant. But one example that got a lot of attention: His balanced budget bills, which are pretty similar to what you described.
@allahpundit @SethAMandel Rand Paul became one of the most prominent figures in American politics with relatively similar moves in large part because it was seen as an "ideas guy" move
Trump gets nothing politically at home from lavishing praise on dictators and minimizing their crimes. There's no constituency begging him to become best friends with Kim Jong-Un and disgrace Otto Warmbier's memory. These episodes are very revealing in that way.

@maxberger @CoreyRobin @rortybomb @DLind @cjane87 But I don't think anyone who was writing about that would argue it doesn't matter if the president, say, starts talking about banning religions from entering the country even if they don't enact it. They're different things.

What's interesting from their research is that the daily tumult around Trump does register with voters. The challenge they identify is connecting it to bread-and-butter issues -- i.e. BECAUSE Trump is generating this chaos, policy that could help voters is not getting through.
Cecil also says there's not much sign that voters distinguish between different D candidates yet in matchups vs Trump. "We don't see seismic changes based on whether the candidate is one person or another," he said.
This shouldn't sound surprising, this is overwhelmingly how Democrats approached the 2018 midterms. But it's a big shift from 2016, when focus was more on Trump's character, bigotry, and threat to democratic norms.
At @prioritiesUSA briefing on $100m early investment in FL/MI/WI/PA, to expand later. Their research shows best anti-Trump message is on health care, wages, cost of living. "While people are talking about Mueller, we’ll be talking about high health care prices," @guycecil says.

@katherinemiller I wonder about that too. I do think one advantage D’s have politically from Gilded Age-level wealth concentration is that you can pretty easily distinguish the rich from the merely upper middle class.
They also hit different types of rich people. A 70% tax on income suuuuucks for LeBron James whose NBA salary alone is $35 million. But Jeff Bezos probably won’t even notice it, his fortune is in unrealized capital gains that aren’t touched by income tax. Wealth tax, though...
Think of it this way: Say you had a 4% return on your giant fortune last year. But then you pay the 2% tax on April 15. Effectively that’s about a 50% tax rate that also applies to way more assets than the income tax.
The 2% wealth tax is much more far-reaching than the 70% income tax idea, but 2% sounds small and 70% sounds big which I think helps explain these gaps in polling support https://t.co/2Lbdu8kPrv

Long applause when Harris says she supports Green New Deal: "It's a resolution that requires us to have goals and think about what we can achieve and put metrics on it. Some of them we’ll achieve, some of them we won't, but if we don't aspire [there] is going to be a bad ending."
Harris repeatedly calls pharmaceutical companies "immoral," says were "pushing [opioids] knowing of its side effects"
Asked how she'll win outside the coasts, Harris says she'll present herself as a leader who "understands that power is about understanding and caring and having an interest in the lives of people other than oneself."
Harris: "We have failed to put the resources into our public education system and instead we are putting tons of money into a system of mass incarceration"
Addressing what she calls "the elephant in the room," Harris says she's serious about campaigning in NH, despite early focus on SC and CA: "I'm here to tell you I plan on spending time in NH, I plan on competing in NH, I plan on doing very well in NH."

@allahpundit Did he get any draft picks
The Senate GOP's position re: emergency is very similar to their position re: Trump in late 2016. Many of them went all-in on denouncing him, then had to sheepishly crawl back once he won. They sent similar signals to shoot down the emergency trial balloon. Now it's happening.

Finally, it's *really* good news for Republicans that the current Democratic presidential candidates are totally ignoring the most militant activists on this hypothetical emergency and not, say, rushing to align themselves with their demands
It's *especially* good news for Republicans that if there were such an emergency, it definitely wouldn't involve large scale funding for engineering projects. That would really be bad.
It's a good thing for Republicans there's nothing going on right now that virtually every Democrat considers a national emergency and that the next Democratic president won't be able to get any GOP votes to deal with
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @jbouie To put it another way: Is it possible GND supporters don’t realize they endorsed something that falls short of their more concrete policy goals, not the other way around?
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @jbouie This is going to create internal problems down the line, because core GND supporters definitely do NOT see this as broad aspirational language, but there’s very little that actually ties 2020 Dems to the kind of policies you’re talking about.
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @jbouie One thing you’re missing, I think, is how vague and disputed the parts you’re referencing are.

@EsotericCD To the extent there's an embedded assumption, it's that a vote puts people who already publicly support it in a political bind. But even then, it's more about how that's McConnell's perspective, which I don't think anyone would dispute.

Republicans are happy to get questions about Omar. They’re less happy to have a simmering news cycle relitigating everything Trump has said about Jewish donors and neo-Nazis and then getting asked about them.
In a pretty uncharacteristic show of restraint, Trump stayed out of the Steve King news cycle. That move made sense for a lot of the same reasons it’s so shameless and potentially damaging for him to wade into the Ilhan Omar story now.
Look, it's going to happen. A Democratic presidential candidate is going to RT the president with "This ain't it, chief." We need to admit to ourselves the inevitable and be honest with ourselves about how we'll respond.

Yes, the GOP, a coalition of hawks, evangelicals, free marketeers, and cultural conservatives, would have spent the last 20 years passing BDS amendments left and right, but damn, donors. There are real debates about AIPAC -- especially among Jews themselves -- but this is dumb.
The anti-semitic trope is upsetting on its own, but it's also so misleading to her own followers. Imagine thinking Kevin McCarthy and the broader GOP would be anywhere near Omar's position -- and not using her tweets to split the left -- if  a few donors and AIPAC didn't exist.

@LoganDobson I’ll need more than a CNN poll or two given that we just had elections in every House district several months ago with both sides talking about the issue constantly
@LoganDobson They’ve ticked up a little recently, but they were clearly a midterm liability according to independent polling, the GOP’s own pollsters, and the way both parties responded. One CNN poll doesn’t change that.
Through it all, a major theme is taking the party back to a pre-Reagan state, when top rates were much higher and D’s were less skittish about the “big government” label. Trump is seen as the perfect foil for this project. https://t.co/7aoDPfOmxG
Three, the rise of Sanders/Warren/AOC wing, who see knocking billionaires down a peg as a goal of its own, even aside from generating revenue. They believe concentrated wealth is itself a threat to democracy and shared prosperity. A lot of this echoes Gilded Age politics. https://t.co/JhTowq3P4V

@Noahpinion ? I'm looking at it right now
Broad thrust of the Green New Deal is that the politically sustainable pitch is more "We're going to spend a lot on green jobs" rather than "We're going to ban lots of stuff and tax your energy."

@derekmke No, it’s worth reporting, just with the context that nothing he says on legal immigration along these lines usually lasts more than a few hours
@EdAsante77 No, something like the deals that were on the table in 2017 for a permanent DACA path minus the legal immigration cuts
We went through this dance a million times before. My guess is it depends on whether he’s talked to Stephen Miller or one of his business colleagues last.
If this were functionally true and not something he drops as soon as he sees Fox react, you could probably have a wall deal. But that first premise is very very very unlikely. https://t.co/tuzIQAuFJu
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @rcbregman @gabriel_zucman I think the Buffett Rule and Bush cuts were important to his 2012 campaign, but most of the real world fights on taxes were over squeezing any kind of revenue out of deficit talks with Boehner.
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @rcbregman @gabriel_zucman Working on something on this, but the context of possible D control is also different. Obama’s first term, taxes were more about revenue for ACA and whether to let Bush cuts expire. After R’s took over, he ran on much more ambitious taxes on rich,  but they were DOA as policy.

@dznyc @nycsouthpaw In the case of taxes you can break this down further — polls showed voters widely believed they went to the wealthy, many (often, but not always, inaccurately) believed their own taxes went up as well https://t.co/iM4daudPQf
@dznyc @nycsouthpaw They do in the sense his health care, tax, and immigration policies have all polled badly and were sources of Democratic attacks in the midterms. When presented with actual decisions as opposed to campaign lines, voters seem inclined to focus on the decisions so far.

@dznyc @nycsouthpaw Same thing happened on immigration. He once got asked mid-debate about why his website said he opposed H1B visas and he denied it was his policy and said he favored more high skilled foreign workers
@dznyc @nycsouthpaw I wrote about this constantly during the campaign and tried to push Trump on it. If you asked him about his own blatantly regressive tax plans, he’d disavow it mid-interview and say he actually wants to raise his taxes and lower everyone else’s.
@AdamSerwer @_waleedshahid I may be trying too hard on this one https://t.co/7pnLDR8AUc
@AdamSerwer @_waleedshahid Fight, fight, fight!
@vidbizz Nobody said anything about core convictions
@nberlat @mssilverstein I do think there’s been a change since he became president and got in the Fox-loop continuously.
@nberlat I’m saying instincts here, obviously he doesn’t get all the policy details. But it’s also that he doesn’t care if his advisers just pretend his public statements don’t exist and draft the opposite policy. Or that he’s constantly lying. It’s hard to say, but result is the same.
@nberlat This is also more than random, in the case of health care and taxes especially it’s a consistent pattern. Immigration is more complicated, but he kept contradicting his own campaign on an issue he does understand as a businessman: Work visas.
@nberlat It’s not clever if you do the exact opposite and the results are politically toxic!
@BenDWalsh This happened over and over in the campaign, but it even goes back decades — the last time he was seriously looking at a WH run he proposed a wealth tax lager than Warren’s!
@jonathanchait @veraxunlimited Let me use a gif https://t.co/SxpSc4yisg
@veraxunlimited @jonathanchait This is a complicated contradiction to explain, but I’m going to try to do it in one word: “Lying”
It also makes you wonder what his approval rating might be if he had pursued all those goals, since every time he’s listened to his advisers and gone the other way the result has been unpopular.
I think it’s underappreciated that Trump’s raw instincts are to promise more public spending on health care, more taxes on the rich, and more legal immigration. He gets that something is beneficial there politically, even if he refuses to make it his actual agenda.

@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler @_waleedshahid Gotta jump to something else, but I couldn't disagree more on the last point. It's the molten core of the dispute between their plans, not a side issue.
There are some conservative Republicans uneasy with Trump and some moderate Republicans uneasy with Trump. 		But since you can't run both as the same primary challenger, you end up with poll results like this, via @MonmouthPoll. https://t.co/foc0uYnjRs
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler @_waleedshahid I think that's more precise wording. But I also think arguing it's a Betsy McCaughey myth to claim it eliminates insurance is actively misleading. The whole point is to eliminate insurance, including by banning almost all forms of it that anyone experiences today.
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler So remember arguments over "Ends Medicare As We Know It?" in the Paul Ryan era? I think this is a more extreme version. People conceive of the question as whether they'll be able to keep their current insurance. Not whether they'll technically get a plan that covers minor gaps.
@_waleedshahid @nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler Waleed, can I use you as a Marshall McLuhan here for a second. Am I right in saying the Sanders plan is 1) an actual plan, not a messaging bill and 2) would mostly eliminate private insurance, even in comparison to other countries with universal coverage?
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler For example: https://t.co/JLQiFOwius
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler This is what the actual conversation looks like from the perspective of M4A advocates
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler Finally, it’s not the press that’s forcing this question, it’s that there’s a very vocal part of the party that doesn’t see it as “messaging,” but wants their nominee to all-out go for the Sanders plan in its fullest form and is deeply suspicious of those who won’t do so.
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler Yes, that’s the point I’m making! And the reason they’re getting tripped up on this question is because they’re effectively getting asked “Are you really proposing this — or are we being naive and you actually support some incremental public option instead?”
@nycsouthpaw @jonfavs @brianbeutler Like if your position is Democrats will institute a plan with universal coverage, but a robust private insurance option, there are people proposing to do just that. But that's the whole reason this question is a litmus test for M4A advocates in the first place.
@nycsouthpaw @jonfavs @brianbeutler I don't really get what distinction you're arguing over. It's not "experience" that's relevant here, it's an actual piece of legislation whose features produce a specific outcome. Unless you think the legislation is a messaging bill and we should judge something else.
@takethepith @nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler Yes. His plan would make Medicare vastly more generous than it is now, in addition to expanding it to everyone.
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler Lots of countries in Europe also achieve universal coverage without full single-payer. Sanders is articulating a very specific goal here, which is to cover almost everything that can be conceivably covered through a public plan.
@nycsouthpaw @brianbeutler I'm going to say again: Not every country that has done "this" has  done what Sanders is proposing. In Canada, supplemental insurance is a bigger deal because their public plan covers much less.
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw The flipside of course is if Medicare For All becomes what "Balanced Budget Amendment" is to R's and the point is more to articulate a goal than pass a bill anytime in the next 50 years. In which case, yeah, no need to dwell on details. But the M4A activists really mean it.
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw That’s at least much more honest than “you won’t have your current insurance, but you can buy a plan that covers gym membership and chiropractors”
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw There are other countries with more of a mix between the two, but that’s not the system being proposed here. The specific Sanders plan is to institute about the most comprehensive and generous coverage possible, even by standards of countries often cited as models for care.
@brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw If D’s lean on the small private insurance exception to get around the question for two years, it’s really going to come off as spin. They need to prepare the public in a major way for what it means in practice.
@realdeepdives They want to cut it in half https://t.co/Q5qL1mF7ax
This may be part of a separate trend, in which extreme concentration of wealth in the top 0.1 percent makes it much easier to differentiate them from the merely well-off.

@NickRiccardi @ThePlumLineGS I think it's a pretty crucial distinction, though. Trump's ideas are very important from an intra-GOP politics perspective, but they're extremely unpopular writ large, which explains a whole lot of political outcomes from the midterms to the shutdown.
@ThePlumLineGS @NickRiccardi For, example I’d say it’s important context to his primary win that people aggrieved with what seemed like a rapidly moving consensus on immigration were a huge driver of support. But if anything that’s because they were an aggrieved minority looking for a home.
@ThePlumLineGS @NickRiccardi Yeah it’s hard to dismiss the polls as bad, theyve been consistent for years across and conducted regularly. How they manifest themselves in partisan politics is another question.
The irony of Trump's election is that it came as polling showed positive attitudes towards immigrants were at a historic high. That trend seems to be continuing: Now there's a spike in support for more legal immigration, which Trump has proposed reducing by a large amount. https://t.co/sA904KzgOO

@econwonk @JHWeissmann @ScottElliotG Similarly the filibuster is pretty far down the list of hurdles to D's passing single-payer until both the Democratic party and the Senate map change in a major way.
@econwonk @JHWeissmann @ScottElliotG Right, and it's not the issues people often name. Health care would have had same problems getting to 50. Immigration probably too. But a whole bunch of other stuff would suddenly become a huge priority.
@econwonk @JHWeissmann @ScottElliotG But for almost every example, there's a strong GOP consensus on the underlying issue. Which is why a 50-vote threshold could lead to a kind of reverse-HR 1 passing.
@econwonk @JHWeissmann @ScottElliotG Referring to a filibuster-less Senate, not reconciliation. I'm regularly told by the same people in favor of ending the filibuster that there's a crisis of democratic accountability caused by the other side's gaming of voting/finance/mapmaking/labor rules on the state level.
@econwonk @JHWeissmann @ScottElliotG I still don't see a detailed counter to the "what the GOP can use it for" argument, especially given current advantage in the Senate. Many of those D issues won't have 50 votes. But there is likely GOP consensus on right to work, voter ID, ending campaign finance limits, etc.

@bfrankphoto @samstein @BenMathisLilley @oneunderscore__ @NoahShachtman @kporzee @dallasmavs I'd be OK if they struck out on stars, then tried it all again after another year of tanking and another pick.

@ryanjreilly Did we get a trophy for that, where is it
@daveweigel @BW @AOC It wasn’t a cover story about how world leaders in Davos are all reacting to the news that a billionaire criticized someone else’s tax proposal?
@mattyglesias I really mean this: Cain was slipping in the polls, but he might have won if he hadn't dropped out. He was still a popular figure who made trail appearances even afterwards and I heard from plenty of voters who said they were upset he left.
In 2011, I heard Romney folks celebrating his rise in the polls because he split anti-establishment opposition and would inevitably fade. He lasted *just* long enough to worry them a little, but not much longer. In 2015, Jeb folks were saying the exact same things about Trump.
Herman Cain played a serious unappreciated role in Trump's win by convincing the political class in 2016 that every primary has a wacky frontrunner who says he'd build an electrified border fence and bash on Muslims, but OF COURSE they'll just implode and drop out at some point
@cjane87 Oh god, I forgot about that piece
Notably, Trump was not impressed with allegations against Cain at the time. Per CNN: "I think it's a very ugly witch hunt and I think it's very unfair. You say, 'Oh, hello, darling, how are you?' And you get sued because you've destroyed somebody's life. It's ridiculous."
He's maintained an active role in GOP politics since then, but Cain dropped out in 2012 over #MeToo workplace allegations https://t.co/0vT7CfkECb https://t.co/8Z7aERmgFl
The best sign of this is how Romney had to publicly accept Trump's endorsement in-person in 2012. It had nothing to do with getting Trump's donations, they were worried he had a legit following that could hurt if he turned on them. https://t.co/AVbTgcAtD0

@eric1743 @SenSanders Yeah you're right, let me give it another pass
It's both true that Schultz has no obvious path to winning AND that Democrats are correct to worry he'd take votes from them. These are completely consistent stories.

On one level, it’s ridiculous that it’s news Harris backs Medicare For All. She’s signed onto the Sanders bill! She wrote about it in her book! But D’s have worked hard to minimize their differences on this issue so far and it’s still untested territory politically.
Why Harris coming out for full single-payer Medicare For All matters: Lots of Democrats have ambiguous positions, with many backing M4A but also multiple rival bills at once. It’s going to take a primary to sort out who’s leading with M4A. https://t.co/34sHHIvQDD

But you could just say, sorry, the heirs are on the hook for the taxes on the previous gains. And we're taxing investment income at higher levels too. Taken together, it could achieve the same effect of reducing wealth concentration.
A wealth tax has the advantage of producing revenue each year, even if the wealthy aren't selling their assets. Otherwise, those taxable gains just sit there. They can hold stocks until they die, at which point their heirs get them at a new starting point for tax purposes.
One element of Warren tax debate for progressives is whether they can tax the rich more effectively with another approach. Other options could be raising capital gains taxes and ending step-up in basis on inheritances, which also targets super-wealthy. https://t.co/c3qAFttyx3
. @ewarren's wealth tax is a break from tax policy in America, but wealth taxes themselves aren't a new concept. In fact, they're a big part of the tax code in Switzerland (home of Davos!). Can we learn anything from their experience? https://t.co/c3qAFttyx3
@imillhiser @DouthatNYT Yeah, the main dynamic in 2018 wasn’t “Democrats and Republicans debate single payer.” It was “Republicans attack single payer, Democrats ignore it and attack Republican plans.” Still haven’t seen what a sustained general election case for M4A really looks like on Dem side.
It’s still crazy that we started this presidential cycle with RNC finance chair Steve Wynn and RNC finance deputies Michael Cohen and Elliot Broidy https://t.co/U0nT2pfLo6
@DouthatNYT I was surprised too, my guess was the general election message would end up somewhere like “I’m for any plan that achieves X....”
@DouthatNYT I agree that it’s risky to lead with the least popular aspect in polls
A presidential race is different and plans get more scrutiny then. But it’s also likely to be a referendum on Trump first and foremost. Easy to imagine D’s win, assume they’re in clear on M4A, then find themselves surprised by negative response when they actually try to pass it.
Polling suggests potential vulnerability for D’s on Medicare For All over eliminating private insurance. But it’s not clear how much that would affect the presidential race. GOP ran a ton of ads on it in 2018 with little apparent effect. D’s just pivoted to attacking GOP plans.

@HotlineJosh I’ve said the same thing. But looking at a poll that says “moderate” doesn’t tell you “Schultzian centrist.” Political scientists have raised this objection for years, it isn’t a new complaint.
@HotlineJosh Was referring to primaries in the link — Trump did worst with “very conservative,” much better with “moderates.” 40 is hardly a small feat in a general either considering he was widely depicted as extremist, even within his party at times.
You might think of yourself as moderate if you favor incrementalist economic policy, but you also might think of yourself as a moderate if you favor legal drugs, gay marriage, a Muslim ban, and expanding Social Security benefits.
Moderates in polls do not mean “moderates” as we might imagine them in this case either. It often means voters with a mix of far left and far right views. Trump did very well with self-reported moderates partly for this reason. More on this here: https://t.co/41daLvlwbu https://t.co/Kg7im1m76Q

Something going on that originated from a shaky source that lots of influencers are mad about? Maybe that’s not the lane for journalists to drive into, at least not without reporting. But it’s pretty easy to come up with personal rules to avoid this issue without leaving Twitter.

@HotlineJosh @OriginalBad A lot of the Dem agonizing over whether to play in GA in 2020 on prez level is whether there's marginal value since it might only go Dem in a blowout where you're winning already. But a Sen. candidate could just put their boat in the water hoping for that blowout.
@HotlineJosh @OriginalBad Imagine making the decision as a candidate, though. If you think GA has a chance of being competitive in a truly bad year for Trump in 2020 -- and Perdue is the Trumpiest senator -- you could then see a path to victory. And there's certainly a plausible chance that happens.
@HotlineJosh @OriginalBad I agree Gov/Sen are different. But this gets back to the same issue: Why assume that 2016-level turnout in a midterm implies 2016-level turnout in a presidential contest? If anything, it might imply historic never-before-seen presidential turnout.
@OriginalBad @HotlineJosh Exactly, it doesn't take much imagination to look at sub-4% unemployment, no large-scale wars, and Mueller still holding his cards and then ask yourself "What are ways things could get worse?"
@HotlineJosh I'm sure a lot of people survived the 2006 midterms and thought "Well, at least THAT's the worst it can get!" It can always get worse!
@HotlineJosh I don't really get this premise, you could make a pretty good case that turnout stands to be more favorable in a presidential year and we have no reason to assume Trump's standing is improved by then.

We're all used to seeing "embattled president" "struggling president" "president in a funk" coverage. It's happened to every modern president, even the ones who ended up popular. We're overthinking what it means to be a president who's consistently around 40% approval.
I can't say this enough: The fundamental dynamic underlying all polling, and indeed all of our politics, is that the president is unpopular. With any previous president this would have been 100% obvious long ago, but the nature of Trump's 2016 win has obscured it somewhat. https://t.co/8v6SciaRgX

@nickconfessore Part of the reason it's easier to minimize that theme now is that Iraq and maybe foreign policy more broadly have both faded in relevance to primary voters and completely shifted in partisan lines as circumstances changed
@nickconfessore But I think in particular of this line from the JJ dinner: "I am running for President because I am sick and tired of Democrats thinking that the only way to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like George Bush Republicans."
@nickconfessore Yeah, he had a message that people were eager to graft their own expectations onto. But a big theme of the campaign was that Clinton-era D's flinched way too easily because they'd been conditioned to fear conservative backlash.

@NateSilver538 Ok, that makes more sense. Also they think HR 1 has a lot of their most popular ideas, so why not use it to get it in the spotlight.
@DavidZavac @NateSilver538 I could see the political case for making it the counteroffer, but the substantive policy is why it has no chance. The reason the wall funding is a bargaining chip D’s can contemplate is that it’s not actually a huge deal policywise in comparison to other immigration issues.
@NateSilver538 Unlike DREAM Act, that would never pass the Senate even if Trump endorsed it. The main reason DREAM is in the realm of imagination is that a large proportion of GOP Senators would actually *like* to pass it if they had the political cover to do so.

@aedwardslevy I was about to say...
@stevesingiser @jeffhauser @EsotericCD Third party is another big unknown. A center-right Kasich type could actually end up helping Trump in the right circumstances as well.
@jeffhauser @EsotericCD I'm still open to the idea there are candidates in the mix who could end up in a Clinton-esque position and lose in similar circumstances, but it seems both hard to predict and also mostly out of Trump's control
@EsotericCD Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest you were saying he was favored! Just that was one scenario we were discussing that I saw potential for.
@oldschool1990s Agree the nominee on the other side is probably the most relevant question mark
I remember a long conversation with @EsotericCD right after the election about how Trump would be favored to win in 2020. The big risk I saw for D's was suburban R's coming back home once they saw he was a "normal" president. Needless to say, that's not the timeline we live in.
A theory I'd like to see tested is whether pro-Trump R's talking up impeachment (not necessarily impeachment itself) is a big self-own. Amid all this talk of Overton Window, it seems to move discussion to "He has a Mt. Everest of scandals, but he's technically NOT GUILTY!" https://t.co/Ctbg2F9mSQ
@GreeterDan This is where you're getting to the initial point: You have to imagine sci-fi scenarios. And I don't think Trump has a brand that can capitalize on them the same way as prior presidents. He's much much much more divisive and the political and media environment has changed.
@EdAsante77 Yes, this is his best bet. But it's also looking very iffy too based on the midterms since MI/PA/MN/WI all looked good for D's. Even IA swung back to D's pretty far, despite gov loss.
Here's Gallup for Clinton. The pattern isn't "People hated Clinton, then GOP overreached with impeachment," though it may have affected the midterms. It's just nowhere near the same starting place as Trump. https://t.co/ed9DJJdF0K
It's important to stress this: The impeachment was not the "turnaround" for Clinton. Bill Clinton's approval ratings were great -- 50s and 60s -- even as he was admitting to an affair with Monica Lewinsky.  He had long ago rebounded from his low point ahead of the 1994 midterms.
Here's a remaining theory to test too that's pretty iffy. "Well, he'll ride a backlash to impeachment!" This is based on exactly one data point and it was a president who enjoying a big bump from Scenario 1: Improving economy. Who knows if it's true now?https://t.co/8Pkoo8CiLj
After that you get: "Sure he's unpopular now, but he was unpopular in 2016. He'll just make the D even more unpopular again." Maybe, but it's one hell of a bet to make off a race he barely won against a nominee with big problems and a split base before he started insulting her.
Mayb the best remaining theory: "Well, incumbents usually win." But 2018 looked pretty bad for incumbents. WH is different, but not clear it's as big an advantage anymore. We also don't know WHY incumbent WH's win entirely. It might be because they use midterms to course correct.
Then it was "Well, he doesn't need to be popular, he just needs his base. He's won over Trump-skeptical Republicans and the old Democratic coalition doesn't show up to the polls without Obama." The midterms showed that wasn't a good hand, even when his base shows up in droves.
The old thinking was: "Well, obviously people come around if the economy improves and they get a tax cut." This was the starting point of @davidfrum's 2017 feature imagining a total Trump victory.  But it did improve and it didn't happen and it doesn't look great moving forward.
The single biggest threat to Trump is the same in every poll. Historically bad approval, few people every changing their mind, and you have to come up with totally out-of-left-field sci-fi scenarios to imagine what would turn it around. https://t.co/f0TR46kAI9

@mattyglesias @JeffreyASachs I feel like I saw data that backed this split up at the time, but can't recall the exact polls and don't want to just rely on anecdotes. But this is probably a @KSoltisAnderson question.
@mattyglesias @JeffreyASachs I'm open to seeing otherwise, but this was a contradiction covering young R's in 2016 I often came across. I'd talk to campus Republicans who were more liberal on race/immigration than overall party and hated Trump, but same chapters were the epicenter of the Milo epidemic.
@mattyglesias @JeffreyASachs It would make sense that as parties become more polarized by age, and partisanship becomes much more associated with liberal attitudes on race than in the 90s, that a more Dem-leaning generation would head the same direction across the board
@mattyglesias @JeffreyASachs Pew address this, sure you could dig in further: "There are significant, if more modest, generational differences on these issues even among non-Hispanic whites."

As I keep pointing out, Graham has NOT changed his substantive views on almost any policy. He's mostly repackaged the same ideas in #MAGA terms, then shamelessly praises Trump to try and put them on his radar. It's humiliating and hasn't worked, but that's a separate issue. https://t.co/Cf2oJMWqHg

When I say consensus I mean the presser includes lead sponsor Bobby Scott, Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, chair of progressive caucus Mark Pocan, chair of Blue Dogs Stephanie Murphy. Schumer is also backing it.
@wspieler Per an expert working with House D's at a briefing today, they expect it to be the equivalent of $13 in purchasing power in 2024 vs today.
At D presser to introduce a $15 min wage bill, which could define the party consensus. Legislation would raise wage floor to $15 by 2024 and then automatically increase it based on changes to median wages.

@mdcohen @allahpundit @DouthatNYT @jbouie I think @jbouie had a good piece that summed up this divide better than I can waaaaay back in the Time Before. https://t.co/8P0MrJcvjb
@allahpundit @DouthatNYT There's not really a way a way to overcome that as long as it's the political dividing line.  Especially when -- again -- the actual policy demands are so unorganized and unclear. There's still not a mass movement version of @DouthatNYT.
@allahpundit @DouthatNYT There's a group of independents at least who bounced between Obama and Trump on these kinds of issues (or affect, at least). But maybe the biggest reason is that Trump turned them toward "...and big business is bad because immigrants steal your job and threaten your family."
@allahpundit But the other 2% is that the particular critique of capitalism is still mostly unfocused and only rarely tied to anything resembling policy specifics (as Carlson himself said)
@allahpundit "If they called a truce on cultural stuff" is kinda 98% of the ballgame here.
@allahpundit He's right there's a sentiment that Trump tapped into as well, but it almost never finds it's way into any organized demand or movement, mainly because the same group is so opposed to the ones (like AOC) who actually do organize
@allahpundit I am struggling to see this opening

@DavidMDrucker Yeah, all of this is likely downstream from the original problem, which is going into this fight with the least political capital of his presidency
The thing is the wall isn't even a pressure point that makes D's particularly uncomfortable, since it's not popular and not important as policy. Interior enforcement is more politically sensitive and hugely important policy, but now nobody is discussing it because of the wall. https://t.co/VMcIXRguG3

@robpollard45 @jbillinson It's also funny to take the limited traits of Lando from dialogue -- charismatic guy, lost a card game once -- and make it "Ok, this guy just plays cards ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT, it is his ONLY REASON FOR BEING"
@robpollard45 @jbillinson But by far the best part of Lando's character is his relationship with the robot, which is totally out of left field from the trilogy. Nobody's like "Ah yes Lando, rogue gambler with a romantic interest in droids."
@robpollard45 @jbillinson I get they were going for that arc, but I just didn't feel it at all. I love the concept of a bunch of scrappy survivor characters learning what differentiates them, but it didn't pan out in practice.

@tomtomorrow Yeah, I wasn’t expecting it to LOOK so good, especially with all the turmoil. The costumes, sets, aliens, action all look great and have a clear aesthetic.
Like “Han Solo” isn’t really Han Solo in that movie. But who needs him? Just call the same character Rogo Dashing and it works the same.
I finally watched Solo and it’s....good? I feel like the big mistake was just making it a Solo movie when the characters awkwardly resemble their counterparts, the fan service is 95% unnecessary, and “Star Wars but a heist movie” works just as fine with all new ones.

King's well-documented effort to link the GOP to white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups abroad was far more substantively serious than the NYT quote. It was flagrant, and thanks to outlets like @HuffPost and even conservative voices at points, regularly raised in conversation.
Let's be clear: The NYT quote is not what did King in, it's that leaders decided to act.  		Speaker Ryan could have announced similar action at any time while the below was going on. 		NRCC chair and many conservative voices were ready to back him up. 		https://t.co/QGfsjBIohr https://t.co/znoiGyVrv3
@RobGeorge It's made easier by the fact Trump World seems more concerned with punishing R's who broke with Trump over the Access Hollywood tape than over a Muslim ban.

@RobGeorge The thing is they were mostly in Steve King territory well before Trump showed up. Immigration reform had been abandoned, former backers were retreating to tough on borders talk, the 2016 primary was already going to be a race to the right on the issue, etc.

@JLB_credit_ @cjlemire It also came as King had a legitimate — if very uphill — challenge. So he’d take all the blame if King lost the R’s a seat, especially if D’s took the House by a small margin. In short, a rare act of political bravery that encouraged others to consider their own public stance.
@JLB_credit_ @cjlemire It was who made the statement, the content, and the context. The NRCC chair acting meant he was not getting support in his race and helped set off a flood of pent-up criticism on the right.
@beckytallent Becky, I’m trying to go by facts here. It was a live issue throughout the 2018 cycle dating all the way back to when we were discussing immigration legislation. Ryan made clear he cared about the relevant issues. What kept him from doing something like this?
@JLB_credit_ @cjlemire It was noted plenty *at the time* however that it went further than Ryan et al, who unlike Stivers could have announced they were planning this type of punitive action.
@JLB_credit_ @cjlemire This was a much bigger deal than lip service for DC insiders, as evidenced by the fact King nearly lost his race in an ultra-red rural district as a direct result.
@beckytallent Steve Stivers got there in October, well before these NYT quotes and after plenty of attention to his behavior. What am I missing here?
@cjlemire You’d be forgiven for assuming that was it, but the NRCC chair — the guy whose job it was to elect House Republicans in 2018 — managed to denounce him and white supremacy in clear terms right before the election when it was most damaging

The danger is actually greater now, because suddenly we’re in a Senate cycle where locking in your unpopular brand could easily cost your party the majority with this map.  Although that’s not his problem because he’s likely losing on that kind of election night himself.
You could apply this to almost anything Trump does, but that’s also why he’s in such a dangerous spot. We now know that having approval stuck around 40 is electoral poison, just like it was for other presidents, and he’s making no obvious effort to dig out of it. https://t.co/PjP9thG9hC

This is the kind of thing Trump said he'd do: Be ruthless, do things other politicians consider too politically dangerous or morally repugnant, and use that to get a deal. But it's rarely portrayed as a potential validation of his tactics, either by supporters or critics.
Amid talk of Trump's dealmaking skills and use of hostage tactics, not often mentioned that a DACA/TPS/wall deal would means Trump put upwards of millions of immigrants at direct risk of deportation via his actions and then successfully traded their security for his top priority.
You don't need to trust the media to notice tons of stuff he says directly contradicts previous stuff he said. It's pretty easy to ctrl-F it for yourself.
There's an essay to be written about how we got the first fully post-truth president even as it's never been easier to instantly track his shifting claims and statements, many of which are all on one easily searchable website

That doesn't mean declaring an emergency would pass muster or be good policy or politics. But there's vastly more evidence to bring to bear and, unlike border crossings that are massively down from historic high, the problem is getting more dangerous over time.
Rubio is onto something here, via @CNBC: “If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.” Compared to the wall, there would be tons of government studies and testimony from natsec officials backing up a crisis frame.

@WretchedEsq Yeah there’s that too. It’s also the impulse that leads to “The Democrat Party,” just basic disrespect by not using a preferred name. But there’s a different subtext to the racialized version.
@stahlscott @SeanMcElwee Yep. I’ve been to events where she was followed by pro-Confederate flag protestors with the most racist signs imaginable.
@SeanMcElwee I pointed this plenty out at the time too, it was extremely gross and a regular feature of comments and mentions every time there was a story on him.
@SeanMcElwee Yes, the Piyush thing is 100% real. This isn't false equivalence.

@matthewfdesmond Based on my mentions every time I ever mentioned him, tons of people
@KevinWGlass But it's always the same subtext -- you're somehow hiding something because you don't use the name on your birth certificate. And if there's race involved, it's because you want to alternately hide/emphasize your background depending on which name you prefer.
@KevinWGlass That race was weird because they did the same thing to Beto!
@mode7heaven I mean, it's all dumb.

@owillis Look, I can only speak for myself here. I make policy a major focus of my coverage. I also go out in the field and cover candidates and voters. And I do not think the other stuff is irrelevant to that coverage.
These kinds of personal differences -- biography, experience, character, the hated "electability" -- often are even more relevant in primaries, because partisan voters agree on so much already on policy. So whether they CAN achieve their policy goals becomes a bigger debate.
Sometimes people wish individual voters took a pure consequentialist view that lined up policies in a row and tried to determine the sum total of their impact. But it's usually more like virtue ethics: Which candidate embodies traits that will lead them to achieve X, Y, and Z.
A lot of criticism stems over confusion about what polling does. Only an idiot would tell you to read a poll now to learn who will win in November 2020. But they ARE valuable as snapshots of where voters heads are at a given moment. Which also relates to policy in big ways.
I'm for as much substantive coverage of policy as possible But polling -- yes, even early horserace polling -- is a very relevant part of that coverage. And voters don't just think of substance in terms of policy papers. https://t.co/rHjwScwya5

@npv708 Who knows what it costs on that end! But it looked pretty simple in the show at least, they could do it all with pretty tiny consumer tech.
Good question and my guess is it's a new federal entitlement. the CBO score on permanently digitizing patients instead of providing physical care would probably look good. Like REALLY good. https://t.co/Iv0Cs5l05g

@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller GOP did similar with ACA funding: Banked the Medicare savings for their own budgets and repeal plans, but also got political mileage from criticizing them.
@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller In that sense Trump may have done them a favor. They can bank the unpopular deductions, which eat into upper middle class in those districts, and then focus increases elsewhere. But again, depends on the agenda they pursue.
@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller I talked to most of the D's in those CA races, for example, none of them seemed at all defensive about criticizing Trump tax cuts on distribution. They DID seem uncomfortable with a gas tax, which is the furthest thing from that. https://t.co/isXdqWsedA
@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller I not only agree on this, I've written about it and reported on it in the context of the same districts.

@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller FWIW, the Buffett Rule sounds an awful lot like.....a giant new tax aimed at people making over $10m.
@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller His re-election campaign featured a carefully planned fight about "The Buffett Rule." Raising taxes on the rich is pretty clearly a D consensus position, specific proposals aside.
@HotlineJosh @JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @matthewamiller They did! That was literally Obama's 2008 platform! I see no indication they've moved to the right on this since then.
@JillDLawrence @DemFromCT @HotlineJosh @matthewamiller There was plenty of polling on this at the time too https://t.co/R8jNyUnRuh
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller Like I said, are they going to endorse it? Probably not! Are they scared someone is talking about it in another district somewhere? I'm pretty skeptical.
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller It's pretty hard to find races where a Democrat was actually on the defensive over whether they'd keep it's top rate cuts
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller Even then, I'm not sure how it plays depending on who the target is. In those same NJ/CA districts, candidates were just as comfortable attacking the Trump tax cuts for boosting the rich as they were basking in the backlash to SALT
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller On the latter, I 100% agree
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller Two separate issues. You said her comments were "politically damaging," which is very different than "Not many others are going to endorse her specific position."
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller I again keep saying this, but it's a near-universal D position. Is a 70% top rate on millionaires? Probably not! But then the issue is degree not concept.
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller Sure, other taxes are another story. But like I said, I'd want to see evidence of a backlash against taxing the rich before I assume it's this terrible gaffe.
@HotlineJosh @matthewamiller On people making over $10m? I mean, I'd like to see the polling there, but seemingly all D's were running on raising taxes on the rich. Just didn't hear that 70% number bandied about.
@matthewamiller @HotlineJosh Yeah, I'd have to see specific polling, but almost nothing polls better than taxing the rich. There's a reason Trump kept falsely saying he planned to do it.

@katherinemiller @EvanMcS Too late, tweet went viral
@EvanMcS This was a good properly workshopped announcement tweet
@ZachWahls @KevinWGlass @LPDonovan Right, I don't see the logical train that leads you back there.
@KevinWGlass @LPDonovan On the D side, I see a strong case that they have much better issues to talk about that risk much less backlash. But not sure anyone actually changes a 2020 vote because they fear....the president they don't like now might be removed if he wins?
@KevinWGlass @LPDonovan That argument doesn't work as well outside a midterms context, though. If their main complaint is chaos heading into 2020 and there's more chaos on the horizon, it seems likely they'd just want to remove the source rather than validate it.
@mckaycoppins Psyching D's out of actual impeachment makes some sense
@LPDonovan I guess, and I'm sure it makes for good fundraising emails. But given that his big problem is every group outside his base treats him as a dangerously abnormal president, I don't think constantly saying "Help, I'm about to be IMPEACHED!" exactly tells them otherwise.
@mckaycoppins Similarly, practically all our assumptions around shutdowns are guided around the shutdowns of the 90s. Who knows if they're still relevant to every situation! GOP sure did fine in 2014 after an unpopular shutdown.
@mckaycoppins As I get into next tweet, that was actual impeachment, which is nowhere near happening right now. But I think they may have overlearned that lesson and now act as if having your president and impeachment in the same sentence is a de facto positive.
I remember thinking the same thing in the Bush era too, when there was a similar "Will D's overreach and impeach???" fervor that Pelosi also tamped down without much problem. Actual impeachment is one thing, but I question whether stoking conversation around it helps incumbent.
I get why D's think impeachment is a political loser and midterm results are hard to argue with. But I've had a tougher time getting why the other side is dying to talk about it. Is the frame "Yeah he has issues, but not like IMPEACHMENT level issues" really that good?
It's a good thing the Republican Party spent the last several years methodically building up their credibility as guardians of civil discourse and respect for the office of the presidency, otherwise this week would look really silly

We just went through a midterm cycle where "I'm not paying attention to Trump tweets, I'm getting you better health care" was a frequent winning message. It's possible it works just as well against Trump himself too, but we don't know yet.

FWIW, I'd expect there to be a new consensus "adult in the room" within months that the same people can move onto instead. The concept of "adults in the room" is far more powerful than any one individual.
My sense is that most Trump-skeptical R's are desperate for him to give them even the mildest cover to treat him as a normal president. For a lot of them that cover was McMaster/Mattis/Kelly/Haley, and well, there you go. https://t.co/fGCQxUmrBS

Fun fact: Romney/GOP family drama goes back a looooong time. George Romney (Mitt's father) backed a primary rival to Ronna Romney (Ronna McDaniel's mother) in a 1994 Senate race. Mitt backed Ronna. https://t.co/okfInuOuTx https://t.co/v9H4zdUr5W

The weird thing is not much would change. The elite GOP consensus after 2012 was they needed to appeal to the groups Trump repels the most. He then rode a backlash to that approach. So maybe....he just gets nominated a second time? https://t.co/i8v20WJG9b

A lot of statements echo this, from Gardner: "I cannot and will not support someone for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women." What can Trump do to give him cover? Go back in time and erase the Access Hollywood tape?
To name just one example, read this statement by Cory Gardner -- the 2018 NRSC chair (!!!) -- in October 2016. It's not "I'm worried he won't cut taxes enough." It's that this is a profoundly immoral person. Not much room to walk back w/ dignity.  https://t.co/M8DfWnEpjO
But this choice is going to confront lots of R's, some of whom are up for possibly tough re-election bids like Cory Gardner and Susan Collins. Ben Sasse has to deal with it. Is Trump going to give them any fig leaf at all to say they changed their mind? https://t.co/FuQgsxzeXP
In some cases, people are tipping their hand. Mike Lee called on Trump to drop out in October 2016. Now he's full steam ahead. “I quite like him,” he said recently.  https://t.co/28mbz24uH9
The Romney op-ed raises a question: What do they do in 2020? Because Trump has made moves in their direction on policy, but there's no argument that passes the laugh test that the other issues have gone away somehow.
So one thing to keep an eye on beyond this Romney op-ed: Romney was one of many R's who denounced Trump in starkly moral terms in 2016. Many many many elected R's did not support him in the general on similar grounds.

@zachdcarter @pareene Hey I wrote a little about it just now https://t.co/sbHBH92PIi
@zachdcarter @pareene The way I would present a lot of these splits is different emphases. It’s not like Sanders is going to go “Woah now, we can’t put too many RULES on business!” or Warren go “Hey, let’s not get CRAZY with the safety net!” But they focus on different sides of the fence.
@mattyglesias Don’t think that’s quite right, party doesn’t seem to have coalesced around anyone really. It’s not like everyone’s going to endorse all of a sudden.
@ajtressler This single tweet is the only reporting I plan to do or have ever done on policy, take it or leave it
Also y’know, she could just win. There’s no obvious frontrunner, field could end up split a million ways, any number of WH ethics issues seem likely to pop this year, which she’s well positioned to address. If economy slides, that might play to strengths as well.
There’s a lot of speculation on how Warren is less formidable vs 2016, but she’s a rare candidate who can strongly influence a race even if she doesn’t win a la Sanders. Has a very specific issue profile that she could force other Ds to adopt.

Things that ARE important to immigration doves: Legal path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. 		Things that ARE important to immigration hawks: Less *legal* immigration, more deportations from inside the border. 		Ergo, hawks have to constantly keep Trump from a deal.
When you see old quotes of Democrats talking up a wall, this is one important underlying dynamic. It's easy to offer a wall for things they want because the wall Trump ran on isn't particularly important to either side on a policy level. https://t.co/ZoUscbo7Mu

Pelosi’s argument to D’s is effectively “you may want someone newer, but you need my experience to stand up to Trump.” You couldn’t ask for a better opportunity to showcase that than a WH-initiated shutdown that few expect Trump to get any meaningful concessions from.
Pelosi has a bunch of fights ahead that are going to expose divisions between left and center D’s as well as generational fights. The one thing that seems most likely to unite the party as she takes over is a shutdown.

@SethAMandel @TPCarney Which is generally the one I use. Further reading on it: https://t.co/9TEgM6KawY
@SethAMandel @TPCarney I didn’t see a link, all I’m referring to is the definition re: elites and outsiders vs “true” Americans
@TPCarney @SethAMandel If it’s the former, it isn’t Trump or a lot of right wing leaders considered populist. I don’t think that’s the best definition though.
@TPCarney @SethAMandel We’re getting into the initial debate though, which is how to define populism. Is it redistributive policies or is it the frame of one “authentic” type of American who’s been held down by a corrupt conspiracy at the top?
@trafficstatic @SethAMandel He started ACA with months of talks with Republicans, for example, but ended it with party line votes rather than backing down.
@trafficstatic @SethAMandel Yes and almost everything he achieved substantively came by dropping the naïveté about bipartisanship and playing hardball partisan politics. By 2012, his message vs Romney was pretty different than vs McCain.
@SethAMandel I think it’s fair to critique if he stayed true to it all the time in practice (he didn’t), but he made it a central part of his political message in a way that distinguishes him from more populist leaders.
@SethAMandel But I’m trying to distinguish politics — ie running against your opponent on disagreement — and the populist angle. I think there’s a significant difference without being so broad as to include ALL disagreement and attacks.
@SethAMandel One of the biggest critiques of him on the left is that he kept making a show of entering into long fruitless negotiations with R’s (ACA, deficit, immigration) rather than explicitly defining them as the enemy from the get-go and going to war.
@SethAMandel On a fundamental level, the message was a kind of anti-populism. The “problem in Washington” he was identifying was bickering and name calling. Again, this is about his overall rhetorical frame, not just what you think of his purity by those standards.
@SethAMandel This isn’t a moral judgement, it’s about the populist distinction. Most of what your describing is politics. 08 convention good example: Lots of brutal attacks on McCain. But always followed with: https://t.co/A1HDkNAzpa
@SethAMandel I know this is your signal event, but it doesn’t fit the model. His re-election message wasn’t “stop the dual loyalist conspiracy” no matter how much bad blood there was over the Iran talks. This was a political fight that got ugly.
@SethAMandel The establishment blob is also an argument supporters made more than him. His big applause line wasn’t “stop the blob that controls everything” it was a new kind of more civil productive politics, which seems absurdly naive now but really was his message!
@SethAMandel Like I said, it’s a spectrum! His 2012 campaign was MUCH more populist, especially its ads targeted to what we now would call Obama-Trump voters. But he also was a big proponent of liberal idea both sides are good faith actors, something he’s chastised left over since leaving.
@SethAMandel Not a coincidence the more populist wings of the party are arguing over Obama’s legacy the most right now, either!
@SethAMandel Obama 08 message is the perfect example of the opposite end of the spectrum — one of the most universal messages in recent political history. That it didn’t work out is another story.
@SethAMandel I think that usually narrows it down pretty well. It’s a spectrum, but you really notice the rhetorical difference between candidates who play up problems as a conspiracy by one faction versus ones who emphasize universal goals.
@daveweigel It was always funny on its face, because the 2013 version was “Democrats just want this as an election issue....which is why the GOP House didn’t even bother to produce a bill”

An environment in which a small group of bipartisan senators demand preapproval over AG, Sec Def, judges, etc is a lot more easy to envision than, say, senators changing parties altogether or blocking domestic legislation they support already on ideological grounds.
A realistic rebellion among R senators that addresses their specific issues with Trump these days probably wouldn't be that hard to engineer. It would just take a very small number forming an IDC-style coalition with a handful of Democrats on appointments alone.

@Noahpinion Just looking over my notes: "If somebody goes out and blows up a confederate statue or two, I'll get a dozen calls, but call me when they've done it 100 times, when they're issuing communiques and the cops cant get them"
@Noahpinion I actually had a long conversation with Bryan Burroughs last year about this exact Weathermen/antifa and alt-right parallel -- he saw common roots on antifa side but was pretty skeptical it would turn into similar tactics, especially with revolutionary ideology so out of fashion
@bohmbawerk1 Most of their leverage comes from being able to deny their own party a majority on key votes to get concessions. With D's in charge, any deals that involve R's at all almost surely won't need their votes.

@Yair_Rosenberg @chrislhayes @oneunderscore__ Yeah, that seems like a more understandable argument
@chrislhayes @oneunderscore__ To me the bigger part of the story is that it turns out Alice Walker is on another planet and somehow this has been in plain sight for years and years

@leegreenwood83 Yeah this isn’t even “Facebook, the company.” Nearly all kid stuff is Instagram for people my age as far as I can tell. And conversation like this, in my case, is Twitter.
Honestly the last useful thing that really makes me hesitate is being able to find contact info for anyone. But maybe there's a way to put that in another format, perhaps some kind of physical compendium delivered to everyone's house. Someone should work on that.
The last couple of services were "birthday reminders," which seems plenty possible to replicate, if annoying and certain private groups. But then I realized I could just recreate them as private listservs and it would probably be easier.
Basically, the main appeal was that all your friends are on doing friend-y stuff. Once that stops being the case and it's a very small pool of hyperengaged people, I'm not sure what service it's actually providing to me.
I wonder if the biggest danger to Facebook is that I rarely hear people say they stopped using it and then missed the experience. I cut down a ton in last few years and barely noticed the difference to the point I might finally feel comfortable deleting altogether.

You know who's not likely to correct Trump on this gap? Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Trump keeps promising big government benefits and surrounding himself with small government conservatives. He's either unable or unwilling to tell the policy difference, but result is the same.
@dznyc Yes, he was hardly alone on this.

@AdamSerwer @michaelbd Which again is why I don't think the news peg was a useful frame for discussing meritocracy.
@AdamSerwer @michaelbd But this gets to why this discussion is so incoherent in the first place. It's starting point is the elite of the elite of the elite of early 20th century America, it's endpoint seems to be the entire upper middle class of 21st century America.
@DouthatNYT @michaelbd There were a ton of economic, social, and historical trends that pushed power towards other groups and means of ascent, I don't think "the WASPs decided to let them" is a dominant cause
@DouthatNYT @michaelbd I think I need the book-length version to understand this part
@michaelbd I got to get back to actual work, but that's an interesting theory I'd read more about
@michaelbd This gets to what I think is the main source of misunderstanding of the @DouthatNYT column, which naturally happens to tons of columns: Pegging the longtime story you're interested in (the limits of today's meritocracy) to the news of the day that doesn't fit so easily.
@DouthatNYT @EsotericCD @michaelbd But again it gets back to the same issue: Maybe WASP, while a catchy headline, is not the actual best frame to discuss this phenomenon. Maybe we mean other things when talk about it, which I think is what your column was getting at.
@michaelbd If that's the case, maybe the ethnic tradition wasn't what was behind the impulse in the first place? Or were the new strivers the reason it declined? If it's the latter, then again, the columns should say so.
@michaelbd When, as you said too, there were massive cultural and political forces at work that affected the very same ruling families these columns are lionizing in much the same way within one generation.
@michaelbd The point is framing this argument as "We used to have these service-minded WASPs, then new people broke through and succeeded too, and now we have no culture of service" leaves itself open to that interpretation, intentional or not.
@michaelbd You're making my exact point! I think we are actually in agreement here.
@EsotericCD @michaelbd I agree! But if you're ascribing that to some kind of changing of the ethnic guard, rather than a generational shift that included the same WASP elites, then you're going to run into this problem.
@michaelbd John Fogerty wasn't writing "Fortunate Son" about those useless non-serving sons of recent immigrants. Most of what I see ascribed to "WASP culture" in these pieces is pining about broader cultural changes across generations.
@michaelbd Yes! To which I say the idea you need a mythical WASP culture to explain that is nuts!
Similarly, the subtext of a lot of John McCain's lionization in the next generation is that so many sons of the same privileged few who these WASP-pining columns praise *avoided* service. This WASP vs non-WASP frame is totally misguided for evaluating this kind of phenomenon.
It's great George H.W. Bush served his country and we honor his legacy. But we call them the Greatest Generation for a reason, Americans everywhere did. The idea you need a mythical WASP culture to explain selflessness is nuts. We honor Daniel Inouye too. https://t.co/m56H5WRLue
If you think non-WASP strivers who made huge achievements in the 19th and 20th century were less moral or praiseworthy, then say it. These stories all invoke bigoted early 20th century tropes against new money while dancing around the obvious follow-up. https://t.co/2Ubo74FgIK

@mikeduncan Bradley woulda won
@johnlray @jonfavs The branding is also an issue because of their prior reputation and clashes with various factions. Few on left would call Booker the most populist choice, and yet he’s pushing for guaranteed jobs and forcing corporations to pay workers for stock buybacks. Ton of big bills.
@johnlray @jonfavs But in a crowded primary, which issue you straight-up OWN and talk about the most matters too. Especially in cases where there’s wide agreement on a lot of ideas.
@johnlray It’s too complex to hash in one tweet, but as I was telling @jonfavs in the same thread I totally agree a D who registers as less “populist” to voters might end up with a near identical set of policy stances to Warren
@johnlray So for example Medicare For All polls pretty well on paper — even PPI found this to be the case in their poll — but it’s hard to say it was the driving issue in a lot of those races given other health care fights, taxes, immigration, Trump approval, etc
@johnlray I’m open to idea, but also want to see more data! But it’s also question of emphasis: If there’s 20 candidates would D voters gravitate to the one most associated with populism? Or are there other issues and traits they’d turn to first?
@jonfavs For that reason, it wouldn’t surprise me at all if a D wins the nomination while coopting a ton of Warren’s platform. In many ways that’s already happened, look how much she’s raised profile of ethics, antitrust, and corporate governance issues within party.
@jonfavs I’ve heard this at the individual anecdotal level, at least the style part
@DavidZavac @DouthatNYT Email in the profile!
@DouthatNYT Yep, also drain the swamp — her strongest issue — might become more appealing if there’s a Watergate-level descent into scandal in second term. Which seems super plausible!
So while there’s still plenty of room to pitch a winning 2020 coalition around rabble rousing populism, it might be less in line with the emerging coalition that seems to be forming so far. That’s something to watch moving forward.
But the biggest D gains in 2018 — with some exceptions — didn’t really come from those kinds of candidates or those kinds of voters. Instead it was suburban voters who were turned off by “divisiveness” and maybe less amenable to economic populism on substance as well.
After Trump won, this seemed like an obviously appealing path forward. If populism stole blue collar Dem voters, turn to populism to win them back only give them a more substantive version.
This gets to a way in which midterms may have hurt Warren. Her message is seen as a counter to Trump in part because it uses similar populist framing (obvsly VERY different substance): The reason you struggle is an elite that’s rigging the system against you, starting in DC.

@IAStartingLine That seems a lot more plausible a read
@baseballcrank Yes, it made sense as a strategy! But it;'s also totally incompatible with "D's reflexively are drawn to the most low, mean, nasty anti-Trump message." If so, where were the candidates? Even the safe-seat stars like AOC are focused on lefty goals far far far more than Trump.
@baseballcrank The closest was Tom Steyer's personal ads, but even his own youth-focused group minimized Trump as a strategy
@baseballcrank But not only do the national numbers not bear that out, the idea the anti-Trump ad themes were "there is no such thing as too far, too low or too mean when it comes to Trump" is wrong too. There were virtually none anywhere on personal scandals, Russia, impeachment, etc etc etc
@baseballcrank D's were the opposite in 2018 in many ways. They had a lot of "outsider" candidates who were running ads about why can't we just get along and be independent and drop the partisanship and such.
@baseballcrank I have always argued that was a huge (if understandable at the time) misread of the midterms. They had conventional candidates -- success! -- whose closing message was about Ebola-infected ISIS infiltrators.
Maybe it won't apply the same way to 2020, when D's have to choose someone to take on Trump directly. It's a different situation. But there is no sign the "base" punished anybody for not being Avenatti-like. Key elements on left AND right of D's are actively hostile to the idea.
By the way since I wrote that story on D's not mentioning Trump (and they won 40 seats), every midterm postmortem I've attended has featured D's bragging about how effective this tactic was, from candidates to super PAC directors

@james_roe They ask it all the time! The difference is the GOP has almost uniformly adopted a theory that minimizes deficits, either economically or politically, and doesn’t care. The story of AOC and others is folks on the left reaching similar conclusions.
Would recommend folks on the right read this. There’s a lot of criticism of AOC’s specific budget math (some of it totally deserved), but the real message she’s driving is a theory that deficits just aren’t a big impediment to spending. https://t.co/EwIhLqm9vF
@hoopstalkpty That’s another story — you could have up to several of those if they’re willing to burn the cash and risk humiliation
Tim Pawlenty had to drop out in 2012 because he didn’t have money to keep going. But Newt and Santorum hung around and made late runs because they each had one rich angel investor keeping them in the game. That’s less likely to fly with D’s who aren’t self funders.
Every take on “Woah, there’s gonna be 50 Democrats!” needs to factor this in. There’s going to be a much bigger taboo among D’s against candidates like Santorum, Newt, even Jeb, Rubio and Cruz, who relied on huge outside support from ultra-rich donors. https://t.co/TaRJDhnSe4

@DouthatNYT I’d say it’s a generational thing but we’re about the same age. I also come from the heart of the meritocracy that replaced whatever you’re writing about here so maybe I’m just totally missing the world it replaced beyond occasional legends about Ivy quotas from older relatives

@SeanMcElwee Yeah, as I wrote in the piece people were missing this erosion in part because people who identify in polls as R are pretty clearly fine with this setup and have been for a long time
@SeanMcElwee I think even in the narrow band of Twitter-famous Never Trump conservatives, there’s too much variety to define them as well

@marontheweb @postdiscipline @bayofarizona SALT and mortgage deduction is referenced here, not by name, that's what that last part about the CA-45 race is about
@SeanMcElwee For the piece all I went with was “People who regularly voted Republican in the past and don’t now,” which I think is more than just “swing voters.” Some of these areas were still GOP through prior blue waves, though obviously a lot of change is about new residents there too
@SeanMcElwee I think the lack of clear definitions is an issue itself, which is why I tried to avoid dwelling on the DC version that’s on social media and Sunday shows
But I also think about this quote by Kendra Horn, who won a huge upset in OK-5. Maybe in some places where voters have long gone Republican by habit, Trump’s misogyny and racism was a trigger to re-evaluate whether they agree with the GOP agenda, period. Kind of a synthesis. https://t.co/6cYT0KxKWw

@pareene This feels like a minor detail, but it is weirdly asserts anti-Bush films were box office poison by citing a hit Broadway show that aired on HBO and ignoring the highest grossing documentary ever made.
@jmartNYT They are not paying attention then!
"Never let an attack go unaddressed" is hardly some Trump innovation in politics. What makes him unique is the nature of the attacks themselves and the signature lack of any broader principle behind them.
This is obviously true, but more important is that the attacks themselves go straight to the darkest place, usually a gross stereotype. So black critics are dumb, Muslim critics are religious fanatics, Hispanic critics are loyal to Mexico, POW critics are losers, etc, etc etc. https://t.co/DHDUHfCF0n

@allahpundit Interesting, it's almost as if he keeps repackaging all his old ideas as #MAGA ones and assuming nobody will notice the difference
Rubio's version of nationalism isn't racial nationalism. Maybe this version isn't the same one as his? https://t.co/3s6NQLwWdp

@steveschale I was there last month and suffered mightily from this problem
@jonfavs I’m wondering how it looks if a large wing decides to move away from that and learns they also have a majority disproportionately built on voters mad about losing SALT. But needless to say that’s a problem far down the line.
@jonfavs He was just the opposite: they were  in peak meticulous everything-must-be-paid-for technocrat mode then
@jonfavs I’m thinking more what happens if promises come due. I can think of a very recent example of a party promising conflicting things on deficts, taxes, and health care and running into problems when they suddenly had power.
@jonfavs But it’s hard to interpret the attacks failing as a green light for those policies either. I don’t get sense D’s prepared base (and especially not these suburban voters) for what the tax picture might look like in any number of big policies. That’s a time bomb if they win WH.
@jonfavs Sure, that was the case in lots of places. One fun fact of the election was that they attacked anti-M4A candidates and pro-M4A candidates with the same message!
So to recap: A lefty running on single payer also ran on killing a modest Dem-passed gas tax increase for infrastructure AND in support of deductions for upper middle class (at worst) homeowners. This is not a coherent combination for policy. That could catch up to D’s some day.
Katie Porter’s victory over Rep Mimi Walters in #CA45 neatly encapsulates how hard it is to judge races in just left/right terms. She’s a legit progressive backed by Elizabeth Warren and supports single payer. But look at the ads she won with: https://t.co/x3Hh2PXl0V

@databyler @jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh I always thought the case for it was "Economy doing well, no disastrous wars = return o the mean." But it seems pretty clear from Tuesday results that erosion of support isn't at all to economic growth. So not sure what else he has to offer there.

Crystal City and National Landing both sound like the setting of some horrifying sci-fi dystopia
@jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh @databyler Which also raises the question: What are they offering them now? We know Trump pretty well at this point, I'm not sure what option he has that would start bringing them back. Opinion is very entrenched and he doesn't seem interested in shifting gears.
@jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh @databyler In fact, the nightmare scenario for D's was that a lot of those suburban voters thought Trump wouldn't win and would come back once he was "normalized" as president based on partisanship reasserting itself. Instead, opposite happened in a major way.
@jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh @databyler I do think @databyler raises an important point, which is it was not at all assumed in January 2017 that this R collapse in the suburbs would get worse.
@jpodhoretz @HotlineJosh @databyler Yeah, that's pretty key. Milwaukee and Detroit both rebounded on Tuesday and the turnout collapse there was a yooge prerequisite to D losses last time.

@PatrickRuffini @NickRiccardi That's what I'm saying, they have an amazing small donor magnet at the top of ticket -- and once again, doesn't seem to be filtering down even to 'similar' candidates. Why can't a Lou Barletta raise $30m from emails?
@NickRiccardi @PatrickRuffini I think it's just an out of power issue, Re; focus. D's were very good at this in 2006, for example, when Daily Kos style campaigning really blew up. I remember seeing lots of updates about otherwise obscure races.
@NickRiccardi @PatrickRuffini In R case, the really smart strategic move was on the large donor side, not grassroots. There was an extremely prescient plan to use 2010 wave to invest in lots of state races that normally dont get that much attention.
This is a good thread -- notably, D's were NOT good at this kind of local focus until this cycle, which is one reason they suffered catastrophic losses in 2010 and 2014. And just like now, the grumbling was about how voters and donors only cared about the presidency. https://t.co/UCtA0KNO2f

@sangerkatz @chrisjacobsHC "Confusion" is a pretty generous description of a case where we couldn't find anyone credibly saying it would provide comparable benefits at the time!
@chrisjacobsHC But there's no significant GOP policy wing that's working from that voter assumption. Donors want less spending and lower taxes. There are honest and knowledgable GOP health wonks, but they were ignored and they also don't work from the same universal coverage goal as D's.
@chrisjacobsHC The root problem is pretty simple. As a default, voters want cheaper and easier access to health care. They don't care that much about how they get it. To extent R's have won on health care, it's by convincing them D plans won't achieve that.
@chrisjacobsHC This wasn't a recent change either. LOTS of R's attacked high deductibles under Obamacare even as they worked on a replacement whose explicit purpose was to allow higher deductibles. It was mind-blowing to watch. https://t.co/0uBYDg4gnF
@chrisjacobsHC Ok, that was Trump, he always lies and exaggerates. But this is what every GOP swing campaign looked like in 2018 too: Of course, we'll protect people with pre-existing conditions, why wouldn't me? https://t.co/3PMna64lmO
@chrisjacobsHC But what did Trump's campaign sound like? Everyone is going to get covered, you're going to have lower deductibles, and the government will pay for it. He never really stopped making these promises either even as he brazenly abandoned them at every turn.
@chrisjacobsHC This op-ed by Rep. Jason Lewis is instructive. His argument is for following free market principles -- i.e. letting older and sicker people pay more and ideally scrapping pre-ex protections. This is a normal conservative goal on policy at least. https://t.co/G11iflpILz
. @chrisjacobsHC on how R's ended up losing a health care election: They promised swing voters they'd maintain Obamacare benefits AND promised base voters they'd repeal Obamacare without any clear policy to bridge the gap  https://t.co/kdxl3kC9TQ
The actual argument in the Jason Lewis piece is that R's would do better *because* AHCA would charge older customers more for health care. He thinks young voters would be super psyched to vote R as a result. That's one bold bet based on the results. https://t.co/G11iflpILz
The CBO estimated that a 64 year old making $26,500 a year would pay up to $16,100 a year for health care versus $1,700 under the ACA. Imagine *that* headline for 18 months? https://t.co/0pmjyCWLmN
I don't think R's realize just how bad this could have gotten if AHCA passed based on all available polling over two years and basically all of electoral history  https://t.co/G11iflpILz

Everyone looks great in victory, awful in defeat, but it speaks well of D strategy that they maxed out their potential House gains. Was once assumed they'd need a bigger national wave to get 35-40 seat range. Almost no "surprise" holds for R's.   https://t.co/HArxeHfh51
@Bencjacobs @EsotericCD That dynamic was pretty brutal to Hillary! How many voters could explain the details of emails or Benghazi? But having a consistent background of scandal and investigation — and there will be easier to explain examples — can be a problem.
@EsotericCD @Bencjacobs D’s are going to have to test this out carefully, but I don’t think it should be assumed irrelevant to all voters if there’s a real unified message over 2 years of general corruption
@EsotericCD @Bencjacobs I think that people are maybe sleeping on how things change when it’s a two-person race versus the midterms, where Trump’s brand on these things is still pretty removed from other Rs even as he drags them down
@Bencjacobs a veritable drizzle
It's not just that D's might find more stuff, they also can keep these stories in the news much longer. That epic NYT story on Trump's taxes doesn't have to be a 2-hour blip in the news cycle if D's can hold a whole series of hearings on it throughout the next year.

@EricLevitz To me the best overall case for D coalition staying durable is millennials who came of age D under Bush and Obama and are staying D under Trump right into their middle age. I'm sure that overlaps with some of these suburban issues, but agree they had an opening either way
@ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz Yes, that's my point! It was a giant backlash! They lost 35-40 seats!
@ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz It was all bad to them, yes!
@EricLevitz Right, you could have seen this in 2006 or 2008 too. Then a lot of those Democrats got wiped out when things reverted to the mean.
@LindaHirshman1 @ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz Yes, you're making my point for me. Lots of women who until recently voted for Republicans in their district.
@ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz Greg, I don't know what you're getting at, these were huge issues. But a lot of these people were happy voting for R's as recently as 2016.
@ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz But that's why I wonder how durable it is. Maybe the party looks like that forever, or maybe the next GOP leaders either don't sound that way or learn to use a dog whistle instead of an air horn
@ThePlumLineGS @EricLevitz yes
@EricLevitz Democrats have become more uniformly progressive, but the message in a lot of suburbs was "I'm a friendly independent and my opponent voted to take away your precious SALT deduction"
@EricLevitz I'm very very very skeptical they've durably realigned, at least based on what the races looked like in a lot of those until recently iconic R suburbs
@EricLevitz Yes, I'm guessing most of them don't have posters of Mitch McConnell on their wall while they pull the lever for D's like the more famous DC version. But they're also a real voting bloc that may have swung dozens of seats almost on their own.
@EricLevitz I was discussing with others, but this runs into a "No True Scotsman" fallacy. If millions of people voting for Republican House candidates as recently as 2016 switched their preference with massive electoral consequences, it's effectively pretty similar.
@petergodofsky @AlanMCole Like a lot of the story in NC is the first version
@petergodofsky @AlanMCole I’d also distinguish between suburbs shifting because they’re booming and lots of New Yorkers and Californians are showing up to work and those where existing population is changing minds quicker
@daveweigel Do you just have a search column for Waukesha open or what
@AlanMCole @RobGeorge I think the mistake was especially pronounced because national 2016 margin looked similarly close to 2012. But underneath the hood, the coalitions for each party had majorly shifted.
@RobGeorge I know it's so easy to joke about but it REALLY WAS. One of first things experts were mentioning when I checked in on the state.
@DouthatNYT Yes, because lots of them split their ticket in 2016 thinking they'd be checking the inevitable President Clinton. This time, they voted out the same R's they chose in 2016 even with turnout through the roof.
@AlanMCole @RobGeorge But most importantly, Democrats swept upwards of 40 seats with extremely high turnout *from Republicans* at the same time. This wasn't just lifelong liberals showing up and conservatives forgetting to vote, it was defections from typical R voters.
@AlanMCole @RobGeorge So in Wisconsin's case, a lot of his loss was powered by weak margins in......Waukesha County. Normally upscale suburban Republican central.
@AlanMCole @RobGeorge You could choose almost any seat Democrats won, it was overwhelmingly suburban revolts. Also some of the close races (like Scott Walker's) obscured the fact that the coalitions changed even if the topline numbers were similar.
It's interesting that they won a ton of seats, but not the way the specials might have indicated. R turnout was through the roof in midterms, so persuasion was as big as mobilization. https://t.co/KW8mby4WYV
@DanteAtkins That's where the "any opportunity" comes in. Most likely version of that: as soon as Democrats try to raise taxes by a single dollar and R's nominate someone who doesn't totally repel them
@AlanMCole It's the "No True Republican" fallacy.
Related to that, I'd fully expect a lot of these voters to leave the Democrats almost as soon as Trump is gone if given almost any opportunity.
Hey you know what's an actual thing and not just a few people on Twitter? Never Trump Republicans. Everyone just internalized the idea these suburban voters are Democrats so quickly that they missed how Republican they were recently.

Gillum and Abrams also may be misread in this context because of narrow losses. Florida has elected GOP govs since 1998 (!!!). Abrams overperformed vs early expectations in a tough state and likely helped flip GA-6 and nearly GA-7 as a result.
Notice how focused on the suburbs these victories were, which are not historically a bastion of tolerance. But under Trump, a lot of *white* voters chief objections are that they see him as promoting hate. It's possible having a candidate who implicitly counters that is a plus.
It's not just that four black candidates beat GOP incumbents. They also were four of the tougher races for Democrats. Race could not have been more front and center in Delgado's campaign, Allred is a civil rights lawyer, McBath is a civil rights activist.
To elaborate on this point, I think D's need to take seriously the idea that non-white candidates might be *especially* strong in the Trump era based on midterms. In NC, multiple black sheriffs also unseated GOP incumbents in key races. https://t.co/WPXHFovI5U
@NickRiccardi @RealFacelessMan @matthewjsinger I think the single biggest concern for D's should be preventing their next nominee from being turned into HRC. But I do think we need to acknowledge it wasn't some incredible feat of Trump branding that made her unpopular.

@TheLittleHummer We really don't know yet how it plays out in raw electoral effect
@jbarro Also you shouldn't assume NV is a blue state! They're definitely Trump-curious.
@jbarro We still don't know what PA/WI/MI/MN look like with candidates dropping $100m in them and campaigning constantly. D's clearly are far from DOA based on results, even IA had a rebound, but they're going to be crazy fights.
@jbarro You can totally win that way! But that gets back to the brutal slog part. And the 2018 preview of what the critical midwest/rust belt states look like with actual campaigns hardly suggests they're a lock to return to D's.
Basically, everyone is still playing on the 2016 map. And unless something fundamental changes -- which it can! -- that's going to be an absolutely brutal slog for both sides. And D"s have yet to find the obvious winning blueprint in these results. 	https://t.co/KJUvY5mzwh
But if I'm D's I'm worried about the same thing. That Trump might "freeze" the electorate, but in a way that makes winning back the WH hard. 		The odds of more popular vote/electoral college splits are high if D's can't quite break through sun belt yet while Trump holds OH/FL.
Not only that, he got to 40s/30s approval almost immediately and D's up 8-10 in generic with the economy going well, no disastrous wars, and scandals only doing limited damage. What if there's even a small slowdown in 2020?
There's serous concern for both parties going forward. 		If I'm R's these charts scare me: Job approval and generic ballot.

But the other leading theory of Trump -- that he's immune to all political gravity and lol nothing matters -- is also false. It turns out weak approval ratings translate into serious real world losses, just like they do for other presidents. https://t.co/KJUvY5mzwh
So some thoughts on the election (thread or whatever). 		One big one is that Trump was not some one-time fluke, as many D's argued. He may have won narrowly, but he also changed the electorate in fundamental ways and it's not going away. 		https://t.co/KJUvY5mzwh
It’s basically how we defined a wave at the start of the cycle. But it’s also a problem for them if the limits of that wave make it hard to ever control government! https://t.co/SCFbnWQhmC

Yes, Florida. But Scott Walker and Kris Kobach occupy unique spots in political mythology. You can argue Walker did more to grease the runway for Trump than anyone not named Mitch McConnell. Those are gigantic losses for R's if numbers hold.

NBC News calls it for Abby Finkenauer (D) in IA-01 over Rep. Rod Blum (R). This was a historic D area that swung R in 2014 and to Trump in 2016. 		Also if you're looking for rising stars, she's a charismatic 29-year old whose dad is a welder. I visited his house, nice place.

@DouthatNYT Like, I can’t think of a parallel to Avenatti in basically any race this year. Gillum is maybe closest in a major race just in terms of willingness to confront, but he’s really nowhere near that level and he’s not a political nihilist
@DouthatNYT Basically, if there were a demand for Dem partisan “burn it down” candidates now you think you’d see them running in the 1000+ races this year. But I see very few, lots of friendly veterans emphasizing independence instead.

One odd twist I saw in NC-2.		CLF ran an ad calling the Af-Am Democrat "shady" and accusing her of not paying taxes. 		That's normal for CLF. 		The surprise is her opponent condemned the CLF ad, defended her and even said he pays his taxes the same way. 		https://t.co/zj8fAggP3w
It's a sign of 2018 that Linda Coleman, a black woman with a long resume, has a serious shot at a conservative district.....and it's attracted almost no attention. There are too many other marquee names and race hasn't come up as much in this contest.   https://t.co/zj8fAggP3w
NC-2 also shows why D "enthusiasm" matters so much to the map. It's not just the turnout, it also helped attract a highly-qualified Democrat to run in a typically hopeless district. There are a lot of those races. https://t.co/zj8fAggP3w
The NC-2 race is the best illustration of how the size of the "national" wave matters. Lots of R gerrymanders are designed to withstand a national wave of 5-8 points. But if it gets higher, you could see lots of them flip all at once. https://t.co/zj8fAggP3w
The seat was basically considered safe until just two months ago -- when Rep. Holding's own internals showed him down against challenger Linda Coleman. Since then, $3m has poured in from outside groups. https://t.co/zj8fAggP3w

If Braun and Hawley win on Tuesday, which seems very possible, this would be a pretty similar situation.
One thing that reminds me of 2014 on the Senate side is that several R candidates were criticized for running meh campaigns -- but then won anyway when their party's base came home. Cotton and Tillis both fit this bill and Cotton's win was a blowout.
Frankly, you'd be crazy to see any parallels between the two. You should be ashamed of yourself.

@NickRiccardi @EdAsante77 Cruz's plan was to have the same turnout explosion, but focused on evangelicals, which Trump ended up getting anyway
@EdAsante77 @NickRiccardi The other factor is the Clinton campaign was built entirely to take on a conventional R. Trump blew up all their plans and I wonder how they would have done against someone else.
@NickRiccardi @DemFromCT In the scenario where his R's are getting blown out of the water, it's probably because he was actually successful in repealing Obamacare
@DCDave Nah, that's not the point of this analogy
@EdAsante77 We don't know. It's possible he might have overperformed Trump in a general a lot (obviously not a primary) by attracting more suburban voters skeptical of Clinton or voting third party/staying home in protest.
Before Trump, the suburbs were a huge source of concern for Democrats. John Judis wrote a whole essay in 2015 about how college-educated whites were trending R and could relegate D's to a perpetual minority. But R's chose someone who upended that coalition in favor of a new one.

When people talk about Trump in terms of “Promises made, promises kept” the key thing is that he made multiple contradictory claims on just about every big issue: Health care, immigration, taxes, debt, campaign finance, etc. You can choose your own adventure.

Romney's right in that this isn't appreciated enough as a key role. In countries without a free press, rumors and conspiracy spread like wildfire about what the government is "really" doing and there's no obvious reason to dismiss them given that the real answer is shrouded too.

@baseballcrank On paper, Trump has said a lot of what he's "supposed" to say about Pittsburgh. He's just also said 50 other things unprompted that are blatantly more relevant to his actual views.
@baseballcrank So a speechwriter might come up with a nice sensitive speech for another president, but you'd also trust that it's a sincere reflection of the president's views too. You'd have to be crazy to do that now.
@baseballcrank His point is incorrect, but it does point to one additional "sensitivity" layer: He's trained us to ignore every singe pre-written word that he recites, since he usually contradicts it immediately and they often have no bearing on policy either
@matthewjsinger Oh that'd happen too. "Eh, we'll call it a draw."
Based on past behavior, the most likely response would be a combo of some 4chan-led conspiracy theory about illegal voting and also we had some real losers leading the House, believe me, glad they're gone, not gonna listen to those guys again

It’s the opposite, the easiest thing to do would be to wait a few days until after the election — where he’s still definitely favored btw. Plenty of R’s paid a price for ditching Trump in October 2016. https://t.co/fi9iiKrISN
Finally important context is that King is not a backbencher or gadfly. He’s a huge state figure with a subcommittee chairmanship who presidential candidates line up to court. He chaired the 2016 Ted Cruz campaign. https://t.co/DfRlbyENwU
Would add that Stivers — the chair of the NRCC — is doing this as King faces at least a plausible challenge in his district. It’s his job to elect Republicans.
Stivers is also not messing around with “white supremacy” reference. It’s not easy for Republicans to use that phrase politically these days.
This is pretty significant: GOP leaders have been under pressure to rebuke King, who — even by Trump era standards— has gone way further in associating with far right and anti-Semitic movements this year https://t.co/Bd9kk7qEy3

Just so you’re not surprised when he inevitably weighs in on TV, Lindsey Graham is a longtime proponent of scrapping birthright citizenship even while being a dove on most other immigration issues. He’s pursued it via an amendment, though.
In the meantime there are plenty of actual immigration things he’s done that are actually on the ballot: Ending DACA and TPS status, proposing cuts to family immigration, building a wall, child separation and family detention, refugee policy, etc, etc, etc.
I’d maybe wait and see before taking Trump at his word about any plans days before an election. This time in 2016 he was promising a big lawsuit against his sexual harassment accusers and the New York Times.

@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold I think the main source of disagreement here is how he identified -- not with the pro-Trump alt right, I agree -- versus the specifics of the conspiracy he was fixated on, which I think had closer connections to a scary degree.  But appreciate talking it out.
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold Or take Richard Spencer. I saw him at CPAC last year, and CPAC quickly removed him -- the two are not the same thing at all. But some students at CPAC were walking up to him and taking selfies and trading memes. Because they inhabit a world with overlapping ideas and people.
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold More on that: https://t.co/EMU5VdHp8Q
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold I guess I think distinctions are real, but blurrier. For example I followed Trump’s reddit group through the election, which tried to keep out the latter group. But they kept breaking through or becoming indistinguishable, in part because they spoke such similar language.

@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold The clearest evidence of which was the harassment of Trump opponents by those same people all through 2016, especially Jewish critics on the right and left
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold Like "globalists have infiltrated government to replace us with new people" has become an argument elected R's will now make. I think it's pretty clear, whether they mean it or not, that it gets received by Gab world as a version of their ideas.
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold I think "beyond" is doing a lot of work here too, though As groups like ADL have warned, versions of the same rhetoric and conspiracy theories are cracking into the mainstream. Do you disagree that "Soros-funded Middle Eastern-infiltrated crime caravan" fits that bill?
@DavidAFrench @HashtagGriswold I guess I don't see how that addresses the specific issue of the Soros tweets.  They're not imagining the part where Trump spread these conspiracy theories in a heated political climate, even if I agree with you about not treating the radicalization process the same.
@DavidAFrench @AdamSerwer There's a policy debate over what to do about Central Americans seeking asylum, for example. But why did it take place in a conspiracy form that had strong echoes in the shooter's conspiracy?
@DavidAFrench @AdamSerwer So you might have missed some of this. But it's not just "the caravan." Trump's version of the "the caravan" was to label it a Soros-funded, Democratic-backed plot to funnel violent and "middle eastern" people through the border. Do you think THAT version was a problem?
@EWErickson @chucktodd So the argument seems to be.....the president's behavior is still just as dangerous, but it's no longer productive at this point to talk about it given how people respond?
@DavidAFrench @AdamSerwer At the very least, shouldn't it occasion some soul searching about whether he should have been spreading conspiracy theories demonizing refugees so similar to this guy's trigger? Instead of doubling down?
@DavidAFrench @AdamSerwer So it's clear he was a rabid and dangerous anti-semite long before. But if the immediate trigger was something that was shot into the news by the president in the most irresponsible way possible, doesn't it matter?
@HashtagGriswold @DavidAFrench Do you feel comfortable having these two things together, especially the former being elevated to the top election story and especially given how often Soros fits into the latter's version? I think it's pretty relevant.
@HashtagGriswold @DavidAFrench The other is "Jews, via a refugee welfare organization, are sending migrants to descend on our borders and kill people"
@EWErickson That's what I detected in your MTP interview: weariness. But I don't see how that changes the underlying point you were making.
@HashtagGriswold @DavidAFrench So let's plot it out. One is "George Soros is paying migrants, possibly accompanied by scary Middle Easterners, to descend on your borders on Democrats' behalf."
@DavidAFrench To give an example of the counterargument that's focused on this, here's @AdamSerwer. Nobody is arguing he was "pro-Trump" it's that their conspiracy theories overlapped to a dangerous degree and both demonized refugees. https://t.co/dMdXCymPRF
@DavidAFrench I agree these are both different scenarios and that direct culpability is not the language I'd use. But shouldn't your argument address the fact he acted on a baseless conspiracy that, minus the reference to Jews, the president elevated to his closing midterm message?

Perhaps the most important element of this is that anti-semites don't distinguish much between religious and secular Jews themselves. Hitler certainly didn't. My ancestors were poor rural ultra-orthodox and also relatively secular and integrated city dwellers. All perished.

We've seen this while he's been president too. The overall story of his approval ratings is stability, but Charlottesville marked a real low point. Now there's another deadly outbreak of hate and he's reminding everyone that he's the same president he was then.
Midterms aren't general elections, the GOP in 2018 isn't the GOP in 2016, and it's possible he has this right. But based on prior incidents, I wonder if he's seriously misjudging things by being the most inflammatory and wild Trump he can be for the closing days.
Trump is convinced the moral of 2016 is that he should go Full Trump all the time. But that wasn't quite his attitude at the time: His campaign convinced him to stay quiet the last two weeks and let it be about HRC. His polling was always worse when doing stuff like, well, this.

Reflexively checking his follower count when he should be working on something is the most personally relatable thing the president has ever done
@RachelBitecofer Their best option in that case is to lean in -- many of them were forced to commit themselves to him to win primaries to a degree that's unusual for a midterm cycle with an unpopular president
@RachelBitecofer ONE reason, not THE reason. But they're also related: Unlike prior presidents, he's happy to turn his base against any R he feels isn't sufficiently loyal and actively tries to make midterms a referendum on his presidency
@vplus He meant bombing a country, he was obsessed with the idea that the natural move for an unpopular presidents is to start "Wag The Dog" wars. Which, you know, is very reassuring to everyone now of course.

If there's one mistake everyone should avoid: it's "White House changes tune on pre-ex protections!" headlines. 		Their current position on pre-ex protections is both clear and unchanged from last year. The difference is lying about it prominently two weeks before elections.
Democrats have a more straightforward position: No discrimination of any kind based on pre-existing conditions. No denying coverage, no changing premiums, nada. This has its own tradeoffs, but it's 100% clear.
There are policy rationales and tradeoffs for the latter. WH wants to split younger healthier customers into cheaper plans. But the point is they think dropping pre-ex protections is the way to lower premiums, which also raises them for ppl who have chronic conditions.
This is obviously false, but the important part is that it's not a flip flop on an earlier policy. 		The White House is actively backing a GOP lawsuit to end pre-ex protections and its admin is aggressively promoting the use of plans that don't cover pre-ex conditions. https://t.co/zdAGkSgvid

Something I love doing is reviewing pundit takes from previous midterm elections (I'm fun at parties). One reason the size of '94 wave was such a shock was that Bill Clinton's approval surged at the last minute. He hit 48% in Gallup at this point, up from 39% a month earlier.

Until pretty recently, the default GOP playbook was to talk about topics seen as more politically favorable: Immigration, taxes, Nancy Pelosi, etc. It's only in the last couple of months single-payer and pre-ex have become a major messaging focus.
The shift isn't from R's saying they oppose pre-ex conditions to now saying they support them -- they were saying that last year even while trying to roll them back. The shift is talking about the subject at all after mostly abandoning the topic when repeal bills became toxic.

@senko @BrendanNyhan Someone like Jeb Bush criticizes the immigration system for not putting enough emphasis on skills too, but you don't see him calling American citizens the "worst of the worst" because of which green card they received
@senko @BrendanNyhan But he doesn't just go after the mechanism, he goes after the people -- he falsely claims they're "picked from a bin" because their countries choose the "worst of the worst" -- his words -- to send over. This is clearly demonizing the immigrants themselves.

On the other hand, as Romney points out, Trump did things like pass a business-friendly tax cut and install conservative judges that he supports. But he was promising to do both during the campaign too. That wasn’t why he was called out.
Romney’s own case was that Trump was a lying bully who demonized minorities and attacked women, cheated in business and refused to release tax returns to prove otherwise, was too close to Putin, would impose tariffs, wouldn’t addess the debt, etc. How many of those went away?

@DouthatNYT @jonathanchait The more complicated part is Trump ALSO took some actions to stabilize the market. It's almost as if he doesn't always have coherent policy ideas.
@DouthatNYT @jonathanchait This was largely the analysis I heard from both conservative-wonk and liberal-wonk land in 2017 too. You can't really "kill" Obamacare as long as subsidies rise in response to higher premiums, but you sure can send those premiums higher.
@DouthatNYT @jonathanchait The synthesis is that the markets proved resilient, but that the WH also caused a major and avoidable premium hike in 2018, that this year's "stable" premiums are a direct result of the earlier instability, and that they would be down more absent those actions
@Beragon polls
The point is, many Republicans in 2016 fully understood there was a connection between "the mob" and Trump's deliberate provocations. That connection is being made less and less even though he's president, anger is much worse, and he's actively stoking it the same way.
You can find out the names behind the quotes here. https://t.co/dkeXb9uTvs
"Tonight the seeds of division that Donald Trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly. Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen."
"...There isn’t violence at my events, there isn’t violence at Ted’s events, there isn’t violence at a Kasich event, there isn’t violence at a Sanders event, there isn't violence at a Clinton event. There’s only one presidential candidate who has violence at their events."
"I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment. When a candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates, and today is unlikely to be the last such instance."
So to expand on this point, here are a few quotes from Republicans you might know in 2016. This is before Trump had taken over the party but at a time when both left and right violence was a serious concern. https://t.co/36UphdklzX

This gets at something to keep an eye on in health care debates. US has one of the least generous (and most expensive) health plans in the developed world. But the Sanders plan would make it the MOST generous, well beyond countries like Canada often cited as models. https://t.co/BznbGRyBrd

@JeffRWLawyer In our own partisan politics, it's often about reassuring yourself as much as it is attacking the other side. "We'll do fine in that election, those millions of people marching are just paid protestors. Right? Right???"
@JeffRWLawyer Like I said, I agree there's a very serious anti-semitic obsessed with him, it echoes dangerous frames from previous anti-semites, and it's no coincidence they elevate him. But it's also an old trope to deligitimize partisan opposition by accusing protestors of being astroturf.
@joshnathankazis @JeffRWLawyer That seems more fair. I raised mostly because Trump wasn't the only one bringing up the Soros angle today.
@Kno So should you be on the lookout for Soros tropes that feed into anti-semitism? Sure, of course, and it's a real concern. But it's a mistake to assume that every, or even most, Republicans talking trash about Soros are deliberately feeding it.
@Kno Always fun to be Jewish and get lectured how I don't know what anti-semitism is. I've covered the alt-right's ties to Trump plenty and his use of their vocabulary, the nuance here is that this long predates their rise and extends far beyond Trump
@joshnathankazis @JeffRWLawyer This is where "vast majority" distinction matters too. Trump World raised much more specific concerns and the ADL was concerned. But Soros bashing itself existed long before Trump and exists far outside the alt-right orbit too for different reasons.
@JeffRWLawyer Also there's a big difference between his political role in America and his role abroad, where a lot of opposition is based on his work promoting democracy  and running up against autocratic movements and leaders
@JeffRWLawyer No, they picked him because he funds a bunch of liberal causes. Similarly, you hear lots of people denounce the Kochs on the other side and sometimes dismiss protests on the same basis. I got into a lot of arguments on this distinction covering the tea party.
@HatFurious Like I said, he figures very prominently in anti-semitic conspiracy theories. And Trump himself has touched on those alt-right circles much more than other R's. But "Soros Bad!" also comes up in basically every wing of the party.
@jonrosenberg It's my experience covering Republicans for a decade

@BLawrence42 I dunno? She was backed by Begich.
@ScottOverland That's the point. He won an election by becoming the de factor Republican candidate, but still caucused with D's and voted with them on most key issues.
The actual Democrat got 11% of the vote in her last election. The libertarian, who beat her in the primary in 2010, took 29%.
Murkowski is an extremely weird politician in that she's effectively a Republican who wins elections as the de facto Democrat in the race. The equivalent would be Joe Lieberman's last term.
(also we won't find that out now, still possible to vote no on final confirmation rather than cloture)
I guess we'll find out if the "they're all gonna vote the same way!" speculation is true or not

@ticketdust @RachelLarris @libbycwatson Right. You can give him your own grade on style points (even the moderator is confused following him), but the "plain text" reading is pretty clear
@RachelLarris @libbycwatson If it pleases the court to accept my broken thread in the record https://t.co/51mycTMb87
@libbycwatson I refer you again to the other quotes in there that I cited
@libbycwatson I'm not his speechwriter. But everything he says -- and his actual relationship to the Clinton scandals as a key participants -- supports the idea he's dumping on the Clinton response.
@libbycwatson "I know what can happen to a woman who comes forward" is referring to what Carville said/general Clinton treatment. So is "it can be worse" while defending Trump. He keeps coming back to it.
@libbycwatson He doesn't stop there, though, he keeps going on about the Clinton accusers and how respectfully he thinks Ford was treated in comparison. Again, the context is clear that he's saying it's a bad thing. I'm not defending the argument itself.
@jimthommo @libbycwatson no points w/o the meme
@libbycwatson If you think "Well at least we aren't JAMES CARVILLE" is a dumb argument to make, go ahead! But that's the argument he's making.
@libbycwatson (background on cat) https://t.co/b6lIdXjVwz
@libbycwatson He says that quote is degrading, cites Carville by name, then goes on about various recognizable conservative legends about how Clinton accusers were mistreated (this is where the moderator is confused about something on a cat)
@dankennedy_nu The tweet I was responding to interpreted that way! He subsequently said he reviewed it and interpreted it wrong.
@libbycwatson You're wrong, though. It's confusing, because it's an elaborate whataboutism case that smearing Clinton accusers is Bad, but respectfully calling Ford non-credible is Good, but he's not applying the quote to Ford.
@johniadarola Thanks for discussing -- he is still making an argument about her credibility, I agree
@dankennedy_nu Feel free to be offended! But the idea he's saying *Ford* is the one who's being dragged out with a hundred dollar bill doesn't fit the context of his remarks
@daveweigel It's a kind of elaborate whataboutism -- Well you were mean to our accusers then, so Trump isn't that bad, but also I disagree with him, but also our accusers were strong then and yours are weak now
@johniadarola I agree his line of thinking is confusing, but I don't see an interpretation in which he's applying the quote to Ford. He's arguing "Well, we're not doing THAT" and elaborates
@DLind Goldberg does immediately after he says it and Graham says it's James Carville, thought there's some crosstalk

@emeyerson Getting Trump's position on immigration is like nailing jello to a wall, of course. He's rhetorically bounced around on the idea of trying to retain high-skilled foreign grads.
@emeyerson Bannon brought it up in response to Trump complaining we turned away foreign students after they graduate.
Steve Bannon told Trump in 2015 that he didn’t like how many tech CEOs were Asian immigrants because “a country is more than an economy.” Trump disagreed, said he favored keeping students after they graduate. https://t.co/eHUAyJ5gfw
@amw_stanford That's one interpretation, and it's a strong case for going much further. But another is: "Look how much political backlash comes from even a plan that affects just one relatively small segment of the insurance market."
If you think Medicare For All is good politics and policy, by all means go for it. But "we're gonna get called socialist anyway" doesn't mean you're also insulated from how well those attacks stick and on what details.
FWIW, I don't think this logic generally works in practice. There's going to be more voter scrutiny of positions in a presidential contest (but more importantly, AFTER a presidential contest) even if the attack from the other side is similar. https://t.co/rN4VEJnyXk

@mlcusac Well, here's how the noted neoliberal Huffington Post put it today: "Bernie’s Dumb ‘Stop BEZOS’ Bill May Have Just Helped Amazon Workers Get A Raise"

@evale72 @amyewalter My sister flagged a tweet awhile back demanding the composer be jailed and forced to listen to his song continuously for a year
@amyewalter Thanks for putting it in my head AGAIN, Amy
These ads also keep tying it to Nancy Pelosi, who has mostly sidestepped these fights and says the 2019 agenda will be seemingly modest bills to lower premiums and prescription drug costs https://t.co/U8DVrLOqRo
@Cousycousy Yep, this was a counterargument I heard. Sometimes if you run on a bad idea, your voters demand you pass the bad idea!
This gets to a deeper argument from 2016 that will be key in 2020. Parts of the left argue that a clear effective message -- Amazon bad! Wages low! -- is more important than the policy details, which can be fixed when you're in power. But that doesn't make Stop BEZOS good policy.
We don't know yet how much of a factor the bill was in Amazon's wage hikes. But clearly Bezos is trying to get on Sanders' good side -- he even thanked him on Twitter. And now Amazon has a VERY strong motive to lobby for a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/cM4KMb9xxg
But Sanders supporters argued they were missing the point: Obviously the bill wouldn't become law. It's about sending a message to companies like Amazon that they need to change their practices and rallying voters behind it. https://t.co/cM4KMb9xxg
When Sanders proposed taxing companies for employees who get benefits, even progressives groaned. They said it was a disastrously dumb idea that would lead to discrimination against groups like single mothers. https://t.co/cM4KMb9xxg
Amazon raising wages is a huge business story. But it's also a story about Bernie Sanders, who was pilloried by experts for pushing the Stop BEZOS bill last month. His side is claiming vindication right now.  https://t.co/cM4KMb9xxg
