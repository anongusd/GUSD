GOP senators have been loading the courts with anti-choice judges, attacking our reproductive rights, and attempting to dismantle our health care. We need to flip the Senate.

This #WomensHistoryMonth, we have so much to celebrate — but pro-choice Democratic women's record-breaking victories in 2018 couldn't have happened without the women candidates, activists, leaders, and catalysts like Rep. Shirley Chisholm who paved the way. https://t.co/egUQJt7WPA

Republicans want to force health care providers to lie to their patients. 	They want to restrict &amp; cut off access to care.	They want to come between patients and doctors.

RT @Schriock1: Take a look at this thread to appreciate just how many victories our women had last night. A historic number of women who wi…
This election was historic. And this was only the beginning. The women we elected last night will change the face of power — and the over 42,000 women who have told us they want to run for office will ensure that this change lasts for decades to come!
There are still crucial races that have not been called, and we will be working closely with our candidates to ensure they have the resources they need so that every vote is counted.
Democrats flipped six state legislative chambers, broke up Republican supermajorities in four, and gained Democratic supermajorities in two. And Nevada elected the first majority-women state Assembly in U.S. history!
Let's look even further down the ballot. Over 260 of our state and local candidates have won their elections so far, including 20 who will serve in statewide offices. These women will be at the forefront of the everyday battles to defend women's rights and fight for families.
We tripled the number of pro-choice Democratic women governors in the United States, re-electing the only two incumbents and electing four who flipped seats. One of those will be the first Democratic Hispanic woman governor in U.S. history!
We defended nine of our pro-choice Democratic women incumbents in the Senate and helped @RosenforNevada flip a Nevada Senate seat from red to blue.
We also elected the first Native American women and Muslim women to serve in the House, the first Latinas from Texas, the first African American women from New England — and more historic firsts could be on the way. This Congress will look more like the communities it represents.
There will now be a record number of women serving in the House, with likely over 100 women serving together for the first time in our nation's history. Democratic women are the overwhelming majority of that number.
Democrats took back the House — and the majority of the candidates who flipped seats will be our pro-choice Democratic women. So far, 21 of our women have flipped their seats, and there are several races that haven't been called yet.
So you know that a lot of women won their elections last night. Let's take a moment to talk about what that means.

The toughest fights are what you run toward, not away from. And I'm ready to face these fights head-on. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/vO84T5s0bq
There aren't a lot of kids who go from reduced lunch to Executive Office of the President. I made it because my country and my community invested in me. I want to make sure every kid has the same opportunities that I did. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/GiJCcFuwL2
Families like mine are seeing their opportunities disappear. #TX23 needs a voice in Congress who will stand up for them and fight for affordable health care and good jobs and protect our rights. #GinaTakeover
A member of Congress can create and protect opportunities, or they can erase opportunities. They do that with their voting record, or with their silence. And when the most vulnerable in our community have been targeted, Rep. Will Hurd has too often been silent. #GinaTakeover
Our experiences will make us more effective representatives for our communities. I know where I came from. I know how I got here. I have a responsibility to help others get there too — and I know how to do it. #GinaTakeover
Representation MATTERS. There's a wave of women running this year — women of color, #LGBTQ women, veterans, immigrants, &amp; first-generation Americans — to make their voices heard. We decided that somebody’s not going to do for us that which we can do for ourselves. #GinaTakeover
I could also be the 1st woman to represent my district in Congress. Texas has 36 reps, but only 3 are women. I think that lack of representation is correlated w/ the fact that a woman who has a baby in TX is 5 times more likely to die than if she had the baby in CA. #GinaTakeover
If I win this election, I'll be the first	✅ Iraq War Veteran	✅ Openly #LGBTQ 	✅ Asian American	from Texas to serve in Congress. As incredible as it would be to be the first, I can't be the last. Those voices matter, and we need more of them in Congress. #GinaTakeover
And it's something Congress should remember about Dreamers. They were brought to this country to have a shot at the American dream, and they give back to their communities every day. Yet they live with needless fear and anxiety that they could lose everything. #GinaTakeover
Our country is stronger when those who are willing to serve our country have the opportunity to do so — something this administration should remember as it fights to make it more difficult for #LGBTQ Americans to serve in the military. #GinaTakeover
I served in the Air Force under "Don't Ask Don't Tell" &amp; lived in constant fear that someone would find out that I'm gay, and that I would lose everything I'd fought so hard for. I was ready to die for my country, and I had to live with this needless fear &amp; anxiety. #GinaTakeover
For the next 12 years, I built a career working in national security. I even served in the Executive Office under President Obama! But, as Trump hollowed out and attacked critical government institutions, I decided to do more to serve our country. #GinaTakeover
Because my country and community had given so much to me, I knew I wanted to give back and serve. I earned a four-year Air Force ROTC scholarship to attend college, entered the U.S. Air Force as an intelligence officer, and was then deployed to Iraq. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/nO2VIiOCy3
That has real life and death consequences. Too many families are just one medical emergency away from bankruptcy or years of financial hardship. We all need affordable, accessible, quality health care. This fight is personal to me. #GinaTakeover
My mom was diagnosed with colon cancer. Because she was a public employee, she had the health care coverage she needed to survive. But, too many Texans don't. We have the highest uninsured rate in the country. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/7FyfXCHN75
My mom raised me and my sister on her own. She worked multiple jobs and long hours, and for a time we lived in subsidized housing and relied on reduced lunch at school. My country and community invested in our family, and that gave us incredible opportunities. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/rtzbJVtcHo
I'm a first-generation American. My mom graduated from a top university in the Philippines, but she left her home 40 years ago to come to this country as a domestic helper. Like so many people, she humbled herself for an opportunity at the American dream. #GinaTakeover https://t.co/2K5DBf6FOn

Thank you to @emilyslist for having me today to celebrate Pride Month and for endorsing my campaign to change the face of Kansas politics! #ShariceTakeover
Progress is undefeated...but we have to fight for it. I hope you’ll join me and @emilyslist's other pro-choice Democratic women who are fighting for all of us! #ShariceTakeover
I’ve had to fight my whole life. Because of who I am, who I love, and where I started. But I haven’t let anything get in my way. #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/S3QyU9Pq70
I’ve had the odds stacked against me. I worked my way from Johnson County Community College to Cornell Law School. I worked in one of the country’s largest corporate law firms. And I worked in the highest levels of our federal government as a White House Fellow. #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/INPHjI2S5W
When you’re creating policy that affects everyone, everyone should have a say in that discussion. We see that truth now more than ever. That’s why diverse candidates are running - and winning - in more elections than ever before. #ShariceTakeover
We are a diverse group of hardworking people who are fighting to be heard and represented in our national discussion. I’m not running to be your voice - everyone has their own voice already. I want to listen to and amplify your experiences. #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/33kLzIdagp
I don’t look like your typical congressMAN but your typical congressman doesn’t look like America. Our country’s leadership is a homogeneous group of mostly wealthy, white men from the same backgrounds of privilege &amp; access. But America is so much more than that. #ShariceTakeover
Did you see this photo of Trump and congressional leaders discussing immigration policies? What do you notice? As a former White House Fellow, I learned that one new voice at the table can change the whole conversation. Representation matters. #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/S8NduVIUyC
Last year, I was arrested in an act of civil disobedience standing up for Dreamers. Now, I’m fighting to fix our broken immigration system and stop this administration’s cruel, inhumane, and ineffective immigration policies. #ShariceTakeover
I’m running for Congress to bring a new perspective to the table and to fight for everyone who has ever been left out or left behind. I’ve spent my career focused on bringing opportunity and equality to marginalized communities, and I’ll do the same in Congress. #ShariceTakeover
Systemic discrimination is built into society. Our new tax code rewards the rich @ the expense of everyone else. Our health care system neglects those who can’t afford high prices. Our society is set up to benefit wealthy people w/ access @ the expense of others. #ShariceTakeover
Systemic discrimination still exists in our society and our laws. Trump is trying to ban transgender troops from serving in the military. The #KSLeg passed a law allowing adoption agencies to legally discriminate against qualified LGBTQ families. #ShariceTakeover
I always planned to serve in the Army. My mom came w/me to enlist when I was 19. But back then, "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" was enforced. B/c I’m a lesbian, I knew that if I enlisted, I was committing to hiding my identity for the next 6 years. I couldn’t live a lie. #ShariceTakeover
I was raised by a single mom who served in the Army for 20 years. She is tough - she was literally a drill sergeant - and she is powerful. And she is compassionate, empathetic, and kind. For me, she encompasses all of the qualities that I admire. #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/cba2cdpXec
Hi! I'm @ShariceDavids &amp; I’m running for Congress in #KS03. When elected, I’ll be the first Native American woman in Congress &amp; the first openly #LGBTQ member of Congress from KS. I’m taking over the @emilyslist account for the next hour - thanks for joining me! #ShariceTakeover https://t.co/V4nCEXgpAp

Are you passionate about using email to help elect pro-choice Democratic women? We're looking for an Email Director to join our Digital Team! Help us make 2018 a historic cycle: https://t.co/VeSgcAc5bZ https://t.co/FCbD3bDIBB
Our pro-choice Democratic women know first-hand how Trump and the GOP's attacks on health care will hurt women and families. And they won't stop fighting for all of us.
When @BetsyforIL's son was 12, he had a life-threatening illness that put him in the hospital for 24 days. When she saw her GOP representative celebrating his vote to repeal the ACA with Trump, Betsy decided to run for his seat. https://t.co/biXvlGhIUm
Just before @KatieHill4CA and her husband Kenny were married, Kenny's lung collapsed. He recovered, but his care left them $200,000 in debt. “We have a moral duty to ensure that every American gets the care they need at a price they can afford." https://t.co/My5yo9y5yB
A serious childhood illness made it impossible for @tammybaldwin's grandparents to get health insurance for her. She refuses to play games with families' access to health insurance: "The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away people's health care." https://t.co/bZ23OeLATm
As a child, @LUnderwood630 was diagnosed with a heart condition. She was inspired by those who treated her to become a nurse. When her GOP rep voted for a bill that would have made it difficult for people like her with pre-existing conditions to get coverage, she decided to run. https://t.co/0CnoDzDrH8
When she was starting her small business, health insurance that included maternity coverage was too expensive for @Axne4Congress. "To afford our medical bills, we sold personal items on eBay because we didn’t want to go into debt or go bankrupt just because we had our son.” https://t.co/AWkS0iyE2X
As a child, @VMforCA10 went to the hospital with spinal meningitis. Because she didn't have health insurance, she was sent home to die. "What was one more immigrant, uninsured child to them?” Her access to care depended on one sympathetic doctor. https://t.co/Y85HZ4lIly
One of the the biggest issues facing us in 2018 is access to affordable health insurance. Trump and the GOP's sabotage of the Affordable Care Act is causing premium rates to skyrocket. But to our candidates, health care is more than a political football. It's personal.
