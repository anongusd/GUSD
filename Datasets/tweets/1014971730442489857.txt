#Trumpie #10 is: non-other than #VladimirPutin, shamed for manipulating another country‚Äôs elections and giving the US the objectively worst and weakest President in all its history (that includes #AndrewGarfield, who simply died after being elected). Shame Level: WellFuck/100.

in honor of #TrumpUK, #Trumpie #9 is: @BorisJohnson, shamed for lying about #Brexit to the voters in the referendum and not properly explaining or devising what exactly #Brexit will or even could look like. He‚Äôs also got that signature orange tinge... Shame Lvl: 102/100.

@realDonaldTrump has the power to reshape @Scotus for DECADES. It‚Äôs too much power to place in his tiny orange hands and @GOP should really know better by now! Get with the times and on the right side of history. Country should really come before Party. #ShameATrumpie #DumpTrump
