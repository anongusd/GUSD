Yes, I hope Judge Jackson throws the book at Paul Manafort. But that won't solve the enduring sentencing disparities that plague our criminal justice system. 		We should use this opportunity to draw attention to the systemic problem, rather than a single manifestation of it.
Judge Ellis tipped the scales away from justice with his absurdly lenient sentence for Paul Manafort. You *should* be outraged. 		However, if we want to move towards justice, we should focus more on systemic sentencing disparities and less on Judge Jackson's decision next week.

#BREAKING: Paul Manafort was just sentenced to 47 months (about 4 years) in prison. He faced a maximum of 24 years. 		This sends a horrible message that you can commit serious crimes against the US government, lie to prosecutors, and then get away with an incredibly lax sentence.
This is the ultimate reflection of Paul Manafort's white male privilege.		He committed crimes against the US govt and was still treated better than 99% of jail inmates. Yet, during his LAST chance to express remorse, he could only express remorse for losing his life of privilege. https://t.co/pVDskJaRDp
Per @KenDilanianNBC, Paul Manafort delivered a very short statement in which he did NOT apologize or express remorse ... but he did complain about solitary confinement and express how "humiliated and ashamed" he is. 		So he feels sorry for himself, but not sorry for his crimes.
This will be the first time Paul Manafort has spoken publicly since 2017... https://t.co/QoSSAf0ZKu

Why is Rudy Giuliani involved in talks about pardons?		Issuing pardons is a presidential power. Giuliani is Trump's *personal* lawyer. His involvement is basically an admission that Trump is making pardon decisions based on personal/self-interest, which is a clear abuse of power. https://t.co/QxAO10rVyv
@C_Stein082594 Often, yes. When I wrote the tweet, I was thinking more of Fox News' viewers.
@StacyJannis Oh, I'm not necessarily making a point about the Democratic debate. My comment was meant to be more general. 		(I agree with Perez's decision re. the debate. We can tolerate dissenting viewpoints without letting them dictate our own party's decision-making.)
@LarryMNC What team?
@StacyJannis And although I personally don't watch Fox News and would never recommend it to anyone, the unfortunate reality is that millions of people do watch it. As such, if we want to reach people with differing viewpoints, presenting our arguments on Fox is one way to do it.
@LarryMNC Where?
@LarryMNC Who is equating the two?
@StacyJannis I can't stand Fox News, either, but given that it's a fixture in our society, it must be dealt with. Disagreement is part of that, and presenting a well reasoned argument is the way to do it. The problem IMO is the tendency to attribute malevolence to those with whom we disagree.
RT @ScottMStedman: Debate is a good thing in a Democracy!!!
Tolerance is about the pursuit of truth; about being able to see the value of another person's perspective or truth.		No, it's not an excuse for bigotry. Viewpoints should only be tolerated to the extent that they don’t harm others (physically, psychologically, or emotionally.)
This is what tolerance looks like: an acknowledgement of differences, dissent, &amp; disagreement – and a decision to co-exist peacefully despite our differences, rather than destroy them or each other.		It's a fundamental pillar of democracy that should be commended, not condemned. https://t.co/R3IRglI58i

The WH National Security Council said today's EO removes "superfluous reporting requirements" that "distract ... from [the] primary mission."		i.e., the Trump admin doesn't want to take time away from killing people to report on the people they're killing.	https://t.co/ij5vqZoEb3
Since Trump took office, US drone policy has become less restrained, transparent, &amp; accountable. Among other things, the Trump admin has:		-Made it easier to target people in drone strikes	-Lowered the threshold for authorizing strikes	-Expanded the geographic scope of strikes https://t.co/LRx6p0Q4mh
Today's EO is even more troubling given that the # of drone strikes has increased sharply since Trump took office.		In the first 18 mos of Trump's presidency, the US carried out 176 strikes in Yemen, compared to 154 during Obama's entire 8 yrs in office.	https://t.co/ij5vqZoEb3

@Mattscharfstein Exactly. And our enemies also know that people gravitate toward (mis)information that confirms our preexisting beliefs &amp; political views, which is why it's so important to call out misinformation &amp; conspiracy theories when they're spreading among our allies &amp; like-minded people.
@multitain It's not intended to be disrespectful -- it's just the colloquial term used to refer to the tendency to find profound meaning in nonsense (or BS).
@thenewstorm That's another good study! A different one, but pretty closely related. (Incidentally, I actually wrote about that study in one of my articles a few months ago: https://t.co/6RUMxMa495)
@hey_leia Yes! This perfectly describes the cycle of regressive logic that characterizes conspiratorial thinking. Instead of responding to contradictory evidence by changing one's mind, conspiracy theorists tend to fold the new evidence into an ever-expanding conspiracy theory.
@Mattscharfstein Thank you! That's a huge compliment to me. I may sometimes tell people things that they don't want to hear, but I do it because I value the truth and evidence over retweets and likes. 		(And sometimes, the truth hurts. But it's still the truth, and it should still be told).

@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines He does. Laura is still around, using multiple accounts closely associated with Fraude's crew.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines For years I have devoted countless hours of my time to educate and advocate (never asked for a penny), and built my reputation off of my consistent record of providing accurate information. If you can't see the difference between me and a grifter, I don't know what to tell you.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines I'm not going after him, specifically. He is the leader of the group, which is why his name is used. His group includes Laura, Robin (kicked off Twitter), and Olga, among others, who have engaged in targeted harassment of me since April 2017.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines And you also have to consider that I have been dealing with attacks from this group for 2 years. I have gotten rape threats on my phone because of this group. Nothing they do is in good faith, so I act accordingly.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines But that's the thing: there were no questions asked. At least, not until AFTER they started by accusing us of grifting, falsely stating that we were using the money for a vacation, and spreading disinfo about me that was immediately picked up by Russian propaganda outlet RT.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines Furthermore, there is no GFM for a trip to Hawaii. There's a GFM for an investigativE research endeavor involving Tulsi Gabbard, a Rep. from Hawaii. And despite what some may (condescendingly) claim, Hawaii is not just a giant beach.
@Gavlar @AltUSPressSec @MandoAce @ManInTheHoody @sarahkendzior @OpWolverines They have targeted me for two years. This has nothing to do with a GFM. It's about dividing the left, which is why they go after large accounts. Ask yourself: what have they ever contributed? What effect has their presence had? It's about division, plain and simple.
@EthanObama That's true, but the bigger concern is that a Tulsi-Bernie coalition could badly damage the ultimate Democratic nominee.
For more info on Tulsi Gabbard's fake anti-war stance, here's my piece where I detail her record of taking $ from the defense industry, her refusal to rule out using torture, her fondness for war criminals, her support for drone strikes, and more.		 https://t.co/C2IpWqXc7T
#SundayMorning: Using another source to triangulate the findings, the hashtag (#)Tulsi2020 shows a high correlation with hashtags related to peace and ending "regime change wars," which has become Tulsi's go-to talking point (despite the fact that she's not really anti-war). 5/ https://t.co/uiVprtprck
@stephgerwilson She is definitely being amplified by some automated accounts, though she has a good deal of organic support, too. However, that organic support comes from some questionable sources in many instances.
@rcwhlr I think that's what they're aiming for. Her digital army is hostile to every Democratic candidate except for Bernie Sanders.

#SundayMorning: Looking at the hashtag (#)TulsiGabbard, there's a remarkably high correlation with the hashtag (#)Syria.

The "free speech" legislation being pushed on college campuses is based on a model bill developed by the right-wing Goldwater Institute. It not only forces colleges to let unwanted speakers onto campus, but actually prohibits peaceful protests when such speakers are talking.
This is chilling, given what "free speech" means to the right-wing crowd. As I wrote about recently, the right-wing "free speech" movement is being bankrolled by conservative billionaires who want to indoctrinate young people &amp; force their views where they aren't wanted. https://t.co/rBKuIvEwOF

@bernybelvedere This is the subject of what I'm working on for you, but a meta perspective looking at the problem more broadly. I think you'll like it.
@JessRui67343255 Nah. They do.
@bernybelvedere Yes, they are. And based on recent revelations, they're worse than I initially thought — and that's not an easy feat to achieve. TBH, I'm most disturbed that people ("allies") w/large platforms are loosely associating with them to achieve a common goal.
@Gbnf4life Yep. Still is.
This is sick..but it's also what I'd expect of a neo-Nazi/fascist, since they traffick in violence &amp; threats of violence. 		More disturbing to me is the fact that fellow progressives/allies are willing to overlook this violence because of an unspecified personal vendetta. https://t.co/7EO0ZmRroI
The account names below all belong to one troll. Coincidentally, when the so-called "Fraude Crew" (self-declared progressives/Dems/allies) posted my personal info a while back, I got rape threats on my phone for weeks afterwards.		It'd be wise to watch who you associate with. https://t.co/dyA4E9KKty
Here's the thing about doxxing, harassment, and threats: When your target is someone who deals with legitimately dangerous people (like neo-Nazis), your "game" isn't a game anymore. It's a threat of bodily harm.
@HoarseWisperer @deepknight @AltUSPressSec @Fraude_1 @brooklynmarie @TheLoyalO @propornot @StBridgetAthena @OpWolverines I didn't care either. Until the rape threats.
@HoarseWisperer @EggExodus @AltUSPressSec @Fraude_1 @brooklynmarie @TheLoyalO @propornot @StBridgetAthena @OpWolverines I subscribe to this approach as much as possible. But they seem to think it's a game when their doxxes result in rape threats (on my cell phone, for weeks) and threaten the livelihood of those of us who deal with legit dangerous people, like neo-Nazis. That's when I respond.

And on November 6, 2017, two days after the arrests &amp; detentions began, Trump took to Twitter to defend Mohammed bin Salman's brutal crackdown -- the one that Jared Kushner helped legitimize using intelligence he got from the President's Daily Brief. https://t.co/EkQ3ADFHli
After the visit and subsequent crackdown, Mohammed bin Salman bragged to UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and others that Jared Kushner was “in his pocket." https://t.co/FjhC1CrFhm
Jared Kushner helped legitimize MbS' crackdown on dissenters: "Just the appearance that Kushner [shared info &amp; names with MbS] would send a powerful message to the crown prince’s allies and enemies that his actions were backed by the U.S. government."		https://t.co/qVzXbUfgzy
A week after Kushner returned to the US, MbS launched a crackdown that involved arresting &amp; imprisoning those considered disloyal to the crown prince.		"The Saudi figures named in the President’s Daily Brief were among those rounded up; at least one was reportedly tortured." https://t.co/80juBzbKDb
In Oct 2017, a few months after MbS ousted his cousin, Jared Kushner made an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia to meet w/ MbS. 		MbS told confidants that Kushner discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince. 	https://t.co/He1vf4w3FD
In March 2018, it was reported that after Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman ousted his cousin, the President's Daily Brief started focusing on Saudi Arabia's political climate, including naming those opposed to MbS. Kushner took particular interest in this.	https://t.co/uNvthoHecq https://t.co/20FdsFhPGk
And this --&gt; Feb. 2018: @washingtonpost reported that Jared Kushner, who lacked full security clearance at the time, had "put in more requests for U.S. intelligence information than any White House staffer not working for the National Security Council." 		https://t.co/zbakS6EYeF
And as NYT reported in Feb. 2018, dozens of senior White House aides got security clearance with minimal vetting because no one was allowed to ask questions that might draw attention to problems with Jared Kushner's security clearance. https://t.co/t8HwrGIZmf
Today seems like a good day to remember that Jared Kushner initially reported *zero* meetings with foreign officials on his security clearance forms. 		He later admitted to at least 100 undisclosed contacts w/ foreign officials.		... and he still has top secret clearance.
Per @RepAdamSchiff, the House Intelligence Committee will be "working closely with the Oversight and Reform Committee" to investigate the White House's security clearance process in light of the revelation that Trump bypassed the process to get Jared Kushner top secret clearance. https://t.co/uSbYkmJvS4

@leahmcelrath @sarahkendzior @janicen Also, please stop telling me what to do. It's condescending. You started all of this by making an attribution that I never made, and then ran with it. I'm restating myself because you are still misrepresenting what I wrote.
@leahmcelrath @sarahkendzior @janicen Are you suggesting that Sarah is the only well known person with a large platform who meets that description? Because she's not. You are putting words in my mouth because Sarah is your friend. But please don't conflate your interpretation with what was actually stated.

@sarahkendzior @julian_moffit @leahmcelrath You weren't targeted with any accusations, Sarah. The level of intellectual dishonesty you are comfortable with is seriously disturbing.
@yesmarkvalley The psychology of conspiracy theories is fascinating. I end up writing about it a few times a year because it's always relevant, and after tonight, I'll be writing about it again!
@sarahkendzior @leahmcelrath @janicen Just to be clear on what *did* happen:		-I wrote a thread about conspiracy theories.	-Leah made a connection to Sarah.	-I told Leah that there are people in a DM group that spends a lot of time attacking me.	-I told Leah to ask Sarah about that group.		No cabals. No conspiracies.
@sarahkendzior @leahmcelrath @janicen Right, ok, except that never happened. But if it makes you feel better to say it did, go for it.
@leahmcelrath @sarahkendzior I did stop. Until you started (again) mischaracterizing what was said. And how am I smearing Sarah by asking her to stop twisting my words?
@sarahkendzior @leahmcelrath @janicen And as much as you may want to make this about you, it's not. Sorry.
@sarahkendzior @leahmcelrath @janicen As you can see if you read the thread, I never made that claim. I didn't even say such a DM group existed. Please don't mischaracterize what was actually said.
@leahmcelrath @janicen @sarahkendzior Anyone can read the thread and see that her interpretation is incorrect.
@leahmcelrath @janicen @sarahkendzior If you're worried about people being confused, don't add to it by mischaracterizing what was actually stated.
@leahmcelrath @janicen @sarahkendzior Where did I defame her? I didn't even write her name. You are making a lot of connections that I never made.
@leahmcelrath @janicen @sarahkendzior Not sure where you got that conspiracy theory from, but that's definitely not what I said. I told you to ask her about DM groups. I said I have screenshots from a DM group that has spent a great amount of time attacking me. Please don't misrepresent what I said.
@KillerMartinis @leahmcelrath Love you back :)
@leahmcelrath Seconded.
@MBTrumpwatcher @leahmcelrath That's a conspiracy theory.
@closeupmyeyes @leahmcelrath No. I'm concerned about conspiracy theories. As I stated in my thread. I'm not subtweeting anyone, but it's kind of interesting that I said "conspiracy theory" and some people made an implicit association with a specific person.
@leahmcelrath I've been called a conspiracy theorist by people on the right &amp; left. I've had stories written about me in Russian media; I've had an entire segment on RT about me. I know how it feels. But I know it's not true, &amp; it's not a reason to accept conspiracy theories in our midst.

@leahmcelrath Not just me.
Yes, this. There is a spectrum of conspiracy theories, and they share the same flawed epistemology that induces apathy, either through false hope or through excessive despair.		This isn't my opinion. We know this because it has been studied extensively. https://t.co/8SJvDl6EPh

@leahmcelrath Where did I say to "only trust me"? Please don't put words in my mouth. 		And I'm not saying that speculation is inherently bad. It's bad when presented as factual or when the certainty of speculation is overstated.		"I'm just asking questions" is the MO of conspiracy theorists.

@leahmcelrath I'm not sure where I've implied that anyone can't handle the truth...? My whole point is that we should be dealing in truth, not emotional appeals &amp; speculation. I trust my followers to recognize the gravity of the current situation based on facts, not hyperbole.
@leahmcelrath Yes, some of our institutions *have* failed. But that doesn't mean they *are* failed. Our institutions have failed over &amp; over throughout history, but they remain works in progress. That's my point here -- not that our institutions are perfect, but that they're fixable.
@leahmcelrath Validating people's feelings is one thing. There's no such thing as a "wrong" way to feel. But feelings aren't facts. And when feelings are treated as objective indicators of fact, that's a problem.
@leahmcelrath Echoing Mensch propaganda? What are you talking about? And I'm not subtweeting anyone. There are plenty of people promoting conspiratorial content, and it's concerning regardless of who it is coming from, but especially if it's coming from a trusted voice

That's why conspiracy theories are appealing; they reduce the mental discomfort associated w/ uncertainty.		That's also why they're dangerous; they provide a way to reduce mental distress by changing our perception of a problem w/o actually doing anything to solve the problem. 5/
Conspiracy theories serve a palliative function by allowing people to attribute external events/circumstances to some person or group, which produces a sense of control over one’s environment (b/c the risk is less random when it’s attributed to a powerful, nefarious actor). 4/
@DemWrite Yes, this. Exactly. There are bad people and policies within our institutions, but that doesn't mean our institutions have failed or can't be brought back to health. If people believe that everything is broken beyond repair, there's no motivation to try to fix things.
@DemWrite I've noticed an uptick in these type of doomsday predictions, and some of them are coming from well-known voices with large platforms. I think they have good intent, but they're going about it in a way that all-too-often leads people to tune out or give up entirely.
@AlSeever 100%. This is the solution to so many of our problems.
@MuellersHammer Great name for this phenomenon!
@Thecolours Things like: suggesting the Mueller investigation is just a show (and that the outcome is pre-determined) or that climate change denial is just a cover used by a global cabal of oligarchs who are secretly conspiring to hoard natural resources and let everyone else die.
@havjoul Thank you so much. I really appreciate that :)
It seems to me that doomsday-esque conspiracy theories are appealing because they offer simple answers to complex problems, which reduces uncertainty. The answers may not be good answers, but when it comes to mental distress, bad answers are better than no answers at all. 3/
Research on fear appeals (i.e., using fear to persuade people) shows that fear can be a motivating factor, but only when it's used in conjunction w/ solutions. On its own, fear all too often leads to a state of (behavioral) paralysis. That's the last thing we need right now. 2/
@charles_gaba 😂😂😂
The proliferation of doomsday-esque conspiracy theories and hair-on-fire punditry on the left is of concern. We're undoubtedly in a bad place, but everything is not broken (at least not beyond repair). 		Push back when you see people suggesting it's too late to reverse course.

@slhamlet Exactly. It's a threat to public health, and Twitter has a responsibility to do something if verified accounts use the platform to endanger others.
Speaking about previous barrier construction at the border, Trump tells reporters: "The walls they were building were so ugly that walls got a bad name."
Twitter should revoke the verified status of accounts that spread disinformation about vaccines. The checkmark conveys a sense of credibility &amp; legitimacy, thereby making others more likely to uncritically accept these false claims as true.		This is literally killing people. https://t.co/DClCEvhzB1
Speaking out the new bipartisan spending bill, Trump tells reporters he's "not happy with it" but then says: "I'm adding to it...moving things around. Taking [$] from far important areas" to fund the wall.		Those less important areas include the military &amp; disaster relief funds.

@VABVOX Yes, this. Exactly. They have left the global engagement office without any direction at all, and now they appear to have hired someone who is not equipped to direct it.
@VABVOX But is she prepared to direct the U.S. in combating information warfare? (Her predecessor in global engagement doesn't seem to think so).
@VABVOX Former dir of global engagement didn't give a great review: "Lea may be a great reporter and pilot. She has evidenced absolutely no knowledge of or experience with information warfare...Her appointment endangers our elections, our public discourse, and potentially our economy."
@jljacobson Yep. And they came through, in a big way, according to FEC filings. She broke a fundraising record in the last quarter of 2018 — and most of the $ came from out-of-state Kavanaugh apologists, not from her constituents in Maine. Selling out paid off 😒
@eligit We need new words to describe Republicans these days. Nothing seems adequate to describe the lying, hypocrisy, cravenness, shortsightedness, and selfishness of their actions.
Here's Susan Collins in September, saying Brett Kavanaugh would respect precedent by upholding Roe v. Wade, despite his entire career indicating he that wouldn't.

Trump pledges to end the HIV epidemic while standing in front of Mike Pence, whose anti-choice policies resulted in the worst HIV epidemic in Indiana state history. And in December, Trump ended an entire branch of HIV research b/c it used fetal tissue. #SOTU https://t.co/8F15vcMYEM
"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life," says Trump, who signed an order that resulted in children being ripped away from their parents and thrown into cages. #SOTU

7. But the GOP is no longer in the majority in the House, which means Democrats have subpoena power -- and they're using it.		Two House committees (Intelligence &amp; Financial Services) are launching a joint investigation into Deutsche Bank. 	https://t.co/ufFlH8ns5g
6. Since 2017, House Democrats (HFSC) have wanted to subpoena records pertaining to Deutsche Bank’s Russian money laundering activity &amp; its "unusual loans to Trump, his family, &amp; associates.'		Republicans refused to subpoena the records.		https://t.co/w6xLFR3XcX https://t.co/7gXfts4zce
5. Trump's loans from Deutsche Bank have been under investigation since at least 2017. Among other things, investigators want to know if Russia guaranteed any of those loans (which may explain why the bank continued to loan him so much money).		https://t.co/3wIXSVYaWg https://t.co/6edY1ICC7Z
4. Deutsche Bank has repeatedly come under scrutiny, including by the DOJ, for its role in Russian money laundering schemes.		The DOJ alleges that the bank used a system of "mirror trades" to launder money out of Russia &amp; help oligarchs evade sanctions.	https://t.co/WrYiE5ufNa https://t.co/Nu7T0YpqQG
3. As of his inauguration, Trump owed Deutsche Bank approx $364 million. It holds mortgages on many of his prized properties, including his DC hotel. Since he refused to divest from his companies, several of the loans are personally guaranteed by Trump.		https://t.co/tu9C6kVkSg
2. Even when no other banks would touch him b/c of his reputation for failing to repay debts, Deutsche Bank continued to loan huge sums of money to Trump.		Since 1998, the bank has led or participated in loans of at least $2.5 billion to Trump's companies.	https://t.co/vKoassL7KH
I have written and compiled a lot about Deutsche Bank over the past couple of years. Here are some highlights...		1. A month before the 2016 election, Jared Kushner's family business got a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank. And he didn't disclose it.		https://t.co/xjlNtiIbGA https://t.co/PwCgmODqrY
Exactly. This is the key question. When Deutsche Bank turned him down, did Trump seek a loan from someone else? If so, did they give it to him?		If so ... who is he indebted to? https://t.co/X1SyEaWkBp
So this raises a potentially explosive question: When Deutsche Bank turned him down, did Trump go elsewhere for the loan he wanted? 		And if so, who did he turn to and did they loan him the money? 		https://t.co/YXWJ36yM6L
Deutsche Bank declined Trump's loan request. Among the concerns was that if Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.		https://t.co/YXWJ36yM6L
(!!) During the 2016 campaign, Trump turned to longtime ally Deutsche Bank — one of the few banks still willing to lend money to him — and asked to borrow millions of dollars. 		Deutsche Bank said no, but the loan request was never disclosed until now.		https://t.co/L0LsdXX37W

@Yakno121 @AltUSPressSec Lockheed Martin &amp; Boeing were two of Tulsi Gabbard's largest donors in the 2016 cycle.

@vplus Yes — WH acknowledged afterwards that he had talked to Putin as one of many informal conversations on the sidelines of the summit. No details were given, and it was minimized as casual conversation.
What we *do* know: Putin just fired a warning shot at Trump to remind him that he has receipts from all of their encounters, and he's not afraid to use them.	 	i.e., Trump is compromised. None of us know what else Putin is holding over Trump's head. We just know there's more.		6/
Was Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria part of a deal he discussed with Putin at G-20? Did Trump make any promises about Venezuela during that meeting?		We have no idea. Trump didn't bring a note-taker, translator, or anyone from his administration to the meeting.		5/

Human trafficking and violence against women are, of course, serious problems... which is why misrepresenting them &amp; offering false solutions while allowing funding for VAWA grants to run out is so egregious -- and potentially deadly. 		https://t.co/33d1YflRjl
Trafficking experts say they've simply don't see cases like the ones described by Trump. That's just not how human trafficking works. 		The vast majority of trafficking cases would *not* be stopped by a wall, b/c they involve entry via fraudulent visas.	https://t.co/VXr6H8ckcm
Once again, Trump is exploiting the issue of human trafficking to make a false case for his wall.		Trafficking experts say Trump's depiction (of women being kidnapped, bound with duct tape, &amp; shoved into vehicles) comes from the movies, not real life.	https://t.co/HJuIxEjE6a
Trump is inventing stories about how traffickers smuggle women into the country, and he called them "ingenious" because they use such sophisticated strategies to kidnap and smuggle women into the US.		INGENIOUS ...HUMAN .. TRAFFICKERS.
Trump just thanked Republicans in the Senate for blocking two bills that would have reopened the government. And now he's talking about another damn "caravan" of migrants, calling it a "virtual invasion of our country -- a virtual invasion of drugs...of criminals."
@davidmweissman Yes, and that's important to remember. They've been spiraling out of control for years -- becoming increasingly authoritarian and using undemocratic means to maintain their death grip on power, despite consistently getting the minority of votes.		https://t.co/cwmtnB5OHr https://t.co/LbsBkH0brX
@sam_vinograd @MaxBoot Exactly. The State Dept "defended" the failure to impose sanctions by saying there is no mandatory deadline for doing so... but that's not really a valid defense. Why would they need a deadline for acting to punish a country for violating an international chemicals weapons law?
NEW: The Trump administration is violating federal law by failing to implement sanctions on Russia nearly 3 months after Russia was deemed in violation of a chemical weapons law in connection with the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. https://t.co/uYFsdkJowX
Memo to @AP: The Senate is controlled by Republicans. Democrats are the minority party. 		So how exactly did the party with the minority of votes "block" a bill? https://t.co/Vc7H4V0MAN
@AP Um, the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So how, pray tell, did the minority party block a bill?
@davidmweissman I hope more people will follow your lead, or at least vote against the party until they become a functional opposition party and stop acting like foot soldiers for a dictator.
@davidmweissman *a brain totally controlled BY its id. (Nothing to stop its most selfish impulses)
@davidmweissman Since they became the party of Trump, the GOP has become like a brain totally controlled its id. They've always had these impulses, but Trump gives them permission to act on them, totally free of any constraints or consequences.
The failure of the Republican-controlled Senate to pass a bill to reopen the government guarantees that 800,000 federal workers will miss their 2nd paycheck on Friday. 		https://t.co/lK19BC1sBs
#BREAKING: The GOP-controlled Senate just voted to block a Democrat-led bill to fund the government thru Feb 8th &amp; provide disaster aid. This came just after the GOP-controlled Senate failed to pass the GOP bill to end the government shutdown.

Also worth noting: When Deutsche Bank came up earlier in Mueller's Russia probe, Trump said that was his red line, and threatened to fire Mueller if he started looking at his financial history &amp; business deals. 		Trump can't fire Adam Schiff or Maxine Waters (committee chairs).
And then there's Wilbur Ross. When he was vice-chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, one of his first big moves was appointing Josef Ackermann as chairman. 		Ackerman is the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank.		https://t.co/4thjzu9eS3 https://t.co/PgLYehRxXN
Incidentally, VEB was also at the center of a Russian espionage operation. One of the spies involved in the operation was arrested in NYC in 2015. He was gathering economic intel for Russia. He pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy in March 2016.		https://t.co/a6ZEpIMUmp
Deutsche Bank has a “cooperation agreement” w/ Vnesheconombank (VEB), a Russian state-owned bank under US sanctions.		Jared Kushner met w/ VEB's then-chief exec Sergey Gorkov in Dec. 2016. 		He failed to disclose that, too.		https://t.co/5R2Jw0iREY https://t.co/jbLu8vlZqE
Trump isn't the only one who has (major) financial ties to Deutsche Bank. Jared Kushner's family business received a $285 million loan from Deutsche Bank just one month before the presidential election. 		And naturally, he failed to disclose it. 		https://t.co/3QhaLvAM5K https://t.co/pmgCD2woyv
Deutsche Bank is Trump's top lender. By a huge margin. 		-He owes more than $714 million in loans to at least 8 banks.	-More than half of that ($364 million) is from Deutsche Bank. 		https://t.co/NSuEubD6oi https://t.co/PFC1KwwQZn
Deutsche Bank is already under DOJ investigation for its role in laundering $ out of Russia &amp; helping oligarchs evade US-imposed sanctions 		It also loaned money to Trump at a time when he was in serious debt and no other banks would give him a dollar.	https://t.co/ufFlH8ns5g

@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady Good! I've studied &amp; written on unintended pregnancy, pregnancy prevention, maternal &amp; fetal health, and other reproductive health issues for years — and across time &amp; place, abortion rates fall &amp; pregnancy outcomes improve when effective prevention methods are more accessible.
@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady No, actually, the last time you accused me of dehumanization, the exact same situation unfolded: I refuted your baseless claim very easily, and you flailed around for the rest of the conversation.
@RAMRANTS @Shareblue (I'm an independent contractor.) And my dignity is intact, which is something you can't say. 		@TPUSA is known for exploiting ambitious attention seekers, paying them to humiliate themselves, and then profiting from the public auctioning off of their employees' dignity.
@RAMRANTS @LongscopeTV @JamieOGrady @giannajessen Yep, that's what I said. She can talk about anything she wants to. But her personal experience doesn't give her the right to control other women's bodies.
@RAMRANTS @LongscopeTV @JamieOGrady @giannajessen So that means she's unborn?
@RAMRANTS @petpatrolkitty @JamieOGrady How much does @TPUSA pay you to publicly sacrifice your dignity like this?
@RAMRANTS @LongscopeTV @JamieOGrady @giannajessen Unborn? Um, it definitely sounds like she was .... born. And of course she has a right to speak about her experience. But no, she doesn't have a right to use her experience to take autonomy away from other women.

@Simplybeautif71 @RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady Pro-forced-birth.
@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady But unlike you, Richard, I won't label you as "evil" for your blatantly hypocritical and narrow-minded perspective on the meaning of "pro-life."
@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady If we used your "logic", dr's would be mandated to obtain consent from fetuses to perform ultrasounds or other medical services -- including life-saving procedures -- on pregnant women. Since a fetus can't give consent, dr's couldn't perform life-saving surgeries. Very pro-life.
@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady I'm not pro-abortion. I'm pro-choice. I support the right of women to decide when &amp; if to give birth, &amp; I don't use pseudoscience to assign bodily autonomy to a fetus that doesn't have bodily autonomy. Want to reduce abortion? Support evidence based pregnancy prevention programs.
@RAMRANTS @JamieOGrady I'm "evil"? For suggesting that high school students not be coddled like children? 		And you kind of just made my point for me: The (all male) Covington students are telling women what to do with our bodies based solely on indoctrination, with no regard for women's autonomy.

And re. the Tulsi Gabbard/Bernie Sanders dynamic: Russian-linked accounts are already pushing for a Bernie-Tulsi 2020 ticket, likely with the goal of turning Bernie supporters into Tulsi defenders. The candidates are unlikely to join forces, but their supporters already are.
Tulsi Gabbard is not going to be the Democratic nominee. But she could very well blow up the primaries, shifting us away from a productive, issue-centered debate and towards a divisive, disinformation-fueled civil war that damages our ultimate nominee &amp; helps the GOP.
@eligit Agree, she's not viable as a candidate. But her chances of winning aren't what concern me. Her chances of being a chaos candidate are what concern me.
If you think Tulsi Gabbard hurt herself/her 2020 prospects by placing blame for the shutdown on Democrats, you're not paying attention.

During his speech, Trump talked about: 	-Migrant children	-Migrant women	-Drug dealers	-Traffickers	-Gang members	-"Dangerous criminal aliens"	-"Radical leftists"	-Democrats		He did not once mention the 800,000 federal employees who are going with their paychecks right now. 1/
So... that temporary protection Trump is "offering"? He's the one who took it away in the first place. https://t.co/Xx9go3FSzf
@AP um... Trump is the one who took away that protection in the first place.
Trump just finished speaking about what he refers to as the "humanitarian crisis" at the border. 		&lt;Quick thread on what he said, what he didn't say, what he lied about, and more.&gt;
A man who bragged about sexually assaulting women just said there's a humanitarian crisis at the border because "one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north."

@RoseFromPhila @SenGillibrand Gillibrand is not an opportunist. There are of valid criticisms, but that is not one. Her decision to speak out about Al Franken is entirely consistent with her past positions and statements as an advocate for survivors. It would be more unusual for her to have stayed silent.
@LisaTalmadge @LauriLinnea @Zula_Pup @tfrogdotcom @missmindylouwho Sorry but I'm not going to argue about whether or not Al Franken's behavior was ok. He answered the question himself. Take his word for it, not mine.
@LisaTalmadge @LauriLinnea @Zula_Pup @tfrogdotcom @missmindylouwho Yes. He said his behavior "crossed a line", and apologized for it. Those claiming he did nothing wrong are not listening to his own words.

@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko Deal.
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko If your concerns are in good faith, you should contact me directly instead of tweeting vague predictions that I can't address nor do anything to solve.
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko If you claim to *know* the project is flawed, why haven't you contacted me directly to tell me what part of the project you know is flawed?
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko It can only be interpreted as comparable if it is willfully misinterpreted or misrepresented. Asking for $ to conduct knowingly flawed research after spending more than a yrs-worth of $ on knowingly flawed research doesn't compare to not spending a penny while writing a proposal.
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko If you're not intending to compare that scenario to mine, you may want to clear things up with the folks who have replied to your tweet.
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko I debunked his "botnet" story, resulting in the article being retracted. He refused to acknowledge that his research was wrong.  He blocked me when I asked questions. And continued to ask for money for research that he *knew* was flawed. In no way is that a comparable scenario.
@Fraude_1 @lisa_jocko So... you're continuing the thread you said you wanted to put an end to a few hours ago, but just not tagging me? 		And FYI: Farb's research was (and is) flawed &amp; misleading. It wasn't a proposal or idea. It was more than a year of funded "research", with nothing to show for it.
@DMansini This describes what happened. He resigned because he chose to. 		This is not a rewrite; it's consistent with her entire career and with Franken's own account.
@DMansini @nodedog That's not what happened. Franken said himself he had chosen to resign, and he admitted to wrongdoing. Gillibrand doesn't have the power to force him out, even if she wanted to.
@nodedog Your memory is incorrect. He chose to resign after several dozen senators called on him to resign. He admitted to wrongdoing. Your focus on Gillibrand is misguided and your assertion is incorrect.
@DavidMasterson6 My understanding and perception: Roger Stone heard rumors of the allegations circulating in newsrooms and saw an opportunity to exploit them and divide the left amidst the #MeToo movement.
@pjcadams @Emolclause 1) How did she make it impossible for Franken not to resign? What about the dozens of others who called for him to resign?	2) Smeared? How?	3) Innocent? He admitted his behavior was wrong &amp; crossed a line.		This isn't about "points" — it's about principles.
@ThomasJefUnit99 She's saying "creates a pass" — ie, an excuse.
"If you create a pass because you love someone, or you like someone, or you admire someone, or they’re part of your team, that’s not okay." 	–Kirsten Gillibrand, on why she refused to let the sexual misconduct allegations against Al Franken slide simply because he's a fellow Dem. https://t.co/bNLgPmCwmV
"Al Franken was entitled to whatever process he wanted. If he wanted to stay and wait ... for an ethics hearing, he was entitled to whatever he wanted. His decision was to resign and my decision was not to remain silent." –Kirsten Gillibrand. 👏👏 https://t.co/y8byr3zTKk

And as I said yesterday: I've devoted 2 years and countless (unpaid) hours trying to make use of my research experience for a good cause. I am not going to suddenly decide to start grifting and put my (not-anon) reputation on the line for $5k.
@mikeldennis @kathygriffin Well, a candidate taking support from an agent of a foreign govt would violate campaign finance law.		That's not what's happening here. Here, a(nother) Russian network is boosting Tulsi Gabbard. Reasonable to ask why &amp; who is coordinating, regardless of candidate's involvement.
@AltUSPressSec @HuntWMD @JusticeGirl2950 @AviAhvee @FriendOfTheYeti @lisa_jocko @1weesel @KinCopenhagen @QueerCurmudgeon @kathygriffin @SpeakerPelosi If we announced a project in North Dakota, we'd be accused by some of trying to take a family vacay to Theodore Roosevelt National Park and White Butte.

@HuntWMD @JusticeGirl2950 @AviAhvee @FriendOfTheYeti @lisa_jocko @1weesel @AltUSPressSec @KinCopenhagen @QueerCurmudgeon @kathygriffin @SpeakerPelosi And because of my long-term interest/involvement in this research, I am committed to following up on the lines of inquiry we opened, some of which involve an element of trust-building and rapport.
@HuntWMD @JusticeGirl2950 @AviAhvee @FriendOfTheYeti @lisa_jocko @1weesel @AltUSPressSec @KinCopenhagen @QueerCurmudgeon @kathygriffin @SpeakerPelosi We've both independently spent a lot of (unpaid) hours &amp; done a lot of (unpaid) work to get to this point, and the project/methods were conceptualized by us, based on each of our skills/training/experience. Some of it is generalized; some would be nearly impossible to hand over.
@JusticeGirl2950 @AviAhvee @FriendOfTheYeti @lisa_jocko @1weesel @AltUSPressSec @KinCopenhagen @QueerCurmudgeon @kathygriffin @SpeakerPelosi If the proposal failed to specify the location and simply said, "focus groups in designated communities, &amp; assoc. travel costs," would that be better in your perspective? The organizing principle was not location; the organizing principles are person, issues, &amp; methods.
@AviAhvee @HoarseWisperer @FriendOfTheYeti @JusticeGirl2950 @lisa_jocko @1weesel @AltUSPressSec @KinCopenhagen @QueerCurmudgeon @kathygriffin @SpeakerPelosi I was present when the offer was made to set up a conference call; that offer is still on the table, as is my willingness to speak on the phone to address questions (many of which will be addressed in detail in our proposal once stakeholder feedback is complete &amp; incorporated).

@MarnieClevelan3 @AltUSPressSec @kathygriffin @LeanOnAndLead @realchrissyg Will be in touch (DM?) shortly. Thank you for reaching out :)
@radicalstates @SenGillibrand I'm not advocating for anyone to support Gillibrand nor am I backing her campaign. My point in discussing her is that she is not responsible for Al Franken's resignation, and blaming her for his actions/decision is wrong.
@adistantpeople @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec "Whatever his crimes are"...? Are you serious? He uses chemical weapons &amp; barrel bombs against his own people; systematically detains, tortures, &amp; murders his critics; targets civilian populations, journalists, &amp; doctors. How does a journalist working in the ME miss all of that?

@SimonWDC Good points! I should have specified a bit further re. "why it matters" — my brain was focused less on Cohen's role/criminal activity, and more on the potential mechanisms of action through which it could influence voters.
Why does it matter that Michael Cohen reportedly hired a firm to rig polls in favor of Trump? 		Because this type of astroturfing is a means of manufacturing consensus, or giving the illusion of online popularity in order to build real political support. https://t.co/3qqAzl1fwr

@GetFuktHoosier Some of this can certainly be investigated from home, which is what I have been doing for months &amp; will continue doing without asking for a dollar. But some of that research led to a line of inquiry that necessitates on the ground research if it is to be pursued.
@FriendOfTheYeti @EMinusZero @crowdrise No researcher can ever make promises about the outcome of a future project, and as such, we have not made promises of that nature. However, we've promised to document how the funds are used to conduct the research, to report our findings, &amp; to use it for the public interest.
@EMinusZero @FriendOfTheYeti @crowdrise I'd love to do a free crowdsourced thread and as always, I'd be happy to pitch in my time and effort. I have been looking into Tulsi's ties to various foreign and domestic entities for a while, and help is always appreciated.
@EMinusZero @AviAhvee @crowdrise .@AltUSPressSec has no control over the funds, as we understood it made people uncomfortable to consider donating to an anon account. The amount raised is viewable to the public, &amp; expenditures will be documented, with receipts, &amp; made viewable as well.
@GetFuktHoosier I've dedicated 2 years of my time to similar causes w/o ever asking for a dollar. Some of that unpaid research involved looking into Tulsi, which spawned the current research project that you have labeled a vacation fund. 		Do you really think I'd risk my reputation for $5k?
@JusticeGirl2950 @GetFuktHoosier @get_it_maggie There's no scam, &amp; I won't block you. We have a reason for wanting to conduct face to face ethnographic-style research, though most of the work on this project involves unpaid hours of research. All project docs (budget, expenditures, findings, etc) will be made publicly avail.
@EMinusZero @crowdrise You won't need many funds. Our accounting will be transparent, with independent (uninvolved) third parties overseeing expenditures. Happy to share the details as soon as the first dollar is spent.

@sandyknauer @Arbor95404 @GrnMtnBot Do you blame Chuck Schumer for privately calling on Al Franken to resign even before Gillibrand did? Do you blame the dozens of other senators who called on him to resign the same day Gillibrand did? Are their actions "knee jerk" &amp; "disqualifying", too?
@Slippy_Sally @CheephackOprah Oh you should be prepared to defend her awful record on LGBTQ issues, too, as well as her inexplicable defense of a war criminal, her involvement in a cult, her campaign funding schemes, her attempts to silence reporters, her ties to the defense industry ... and more.
@snarwani @JoeyDal_05 @TheEisaAli @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec And once again, all you have are tired, overused tropes and ad hominem attacks. You can call me a conspiracy theorist as much as you want, but it doesn't make it true — just as denying Russia's involvement in information operations against the US doesn't make it untrue.
@snarwani @TheEisaAli @TattersallLLC @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec I thought you liked Assad/Putin? But now calling someone pro-Assad/Putin is venomous? Strange. 		And this started when you &amp; your RT buddies came at me with your intellectually dishonest BS because apparently that's all you have to offer. It's sad, boring, &amp; frankly embarrassing.
@JoeyDal_05 @TheEisaAli @snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec ^That's^ what we call whataboutism. 		And what you call inconsequential may appear that way in isolation, but isn't so inconsequential when deployed as part of a broader, long-term, multifaceted operation. Hence why documenting each part is crucial to understanding the whole.
@INTHEL00P @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec As long as Russia is engaged in information operations targeting US citizens, institutions, &amp; society, any politician who cozies up to Russia is tacitly approving of the use of cyber &amp; psychological warfare to deceive Americans and undermine our way our life. Not a smear. A fact.
@TheEisaAli @TattersallLLC @snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec Your health (mental, physical) would be better if you dropped the preexisting set of demeaning beliefs that you carry with you. That goes for everyone in this thread. The amount of time you spend immersing yourselves in each other's negativity is truly astounding and sad.
@MaxBlumenthal @TheEisaAli @TattersallLLC @snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec Do you pretend to be dense for fun? Or is that real?
@TheEisaAli @snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec I was born in US. Before the war, most of my family in Syria was near Azaz. (Hence, "girl from the Syrian family", not "girl from Syria.")

Pro-tip: Don't make assessments based on a Twitter thread.
@snarwani @manifesto2000 @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec @TulsiGabbard @SDG2030 You should avoid assumptions; you're not good at them. I haven't been "groomed." My family is Syrian &amp; I was raised to give a damn about needless suffering &amp; death. And don't give me that crap about Russia repelling ISIS in Syria — est 90% of RU air strikes haven't targeted ISIS.
1. I literally never said any of that	2. Tulsi Gabbard's support for a war criminal who is actively slaughtering his own people is not a mere difference of viewpoint	3. Sorry you find me scary. I find it scary that you peddle disinformation &amp; deny Assad's use of chemical weapons https://t.co/q8iMzaEQRE
@snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec Could you point me to where I said any of the things you just asserted? (Hint: I didn't). 		Next time, try formulating a substantive point before approaching me. A good start: Don't put words in my mouth.
@manifesto2000 @snarwani @kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec @TulsiGabbard @SDG2030 If she knows the horrors of war, why'd she celebrate Putin's bombing of Syria in 2015?  And why does she deny Assad's involvement in war crimes?
@dancohen3000 I'm a busy person and don't have time for your silly games. If you're comfortable being an intellectually dishonest hack, then good for you. I prefer to maintain my dignity, but that's just a personal preference. 		FYI, our findings will be made publicly available, so stay tuned!
Exhibit 1,001 on the intellectual dishonesty of Kremlin propagandists: RT correspondent @dancohen3000 took one tweet of mine, making one point, using one source, on one day, and dishonestly claimed that this single tweet represents my "proof" of Tulsi Gabbard's ties to Putin. https://t.co/aO2F1Jsc0k
@dancohen3000 @NewKnowledgeAI 1. Not "my source". A source, of one point, on one day. Good researchers always triangulate, but I wouldn't expect you to know that. 	2. It's not hard to reverse engineer methodology. 	3. If you think my work is so shoddy, why are you obsessing over it?
@dancohen3000 @TulsiGabbard @NewKnowledgeAI I have zero ties to the Democratic Party besides my voter registration. You want to correct the record or are facts not a concern for you?
@dancohen3000 @TulsiGabbard @NewKnowledgeAI That's not my proof. That's literally one example of Russian propagandists pushing Tulsi-related content. Don't put words into my mouth or misrepresent my work please.

THIS. People want to blame everyone *other* than Al Franken for Al Franken's behavior &amp; subsequent resignation.		Enough with the conspiracy theories about GOP operatives &amp; "botnets"; enough with the hatred directed at Kirsten Gillibrand; &amp; for god's sake, enough with the excuses. https://t.co/NlnUOQRQa1
@MiladyMell @MattAsherS What conviction? What judgment? You are basing your opinion on mis/disinformation.
@NYStateSenate4 @dawn_macc How did Gillibrand push the Senate minority leader to take a position that he didn't want to? Citation/link for that? 		And I know some people think lesser of her. That's the problem. Demanding accountability for sexual misconduct allegations shouldn't be a bad thing.
@sandyknauer @Arbor95404 @GrnMtnBot The issue here isn't whether or not Al Franken's resignation was good or bad — the issue is that people are wrongly blaming Kirsten Gillibrand for Franken's behavior and subsequent decision to resign.
@NYStateSenate4 That's incorrect. Gillibrand isn't in charge of deciding whether there's a hearing. Franken was scheduled for an ethics investigation but decided to resign before it started. His choice to forgo the investigation; she didn't make him do that.
@TAW3343 Calling her an opportunist ignores her entire political career, and everything she has done to help survivors. The easy thing to do was stay quiet &amp; avoid the backlash. But she chose not to. You may not agree with that, but it's inaccurate to imply that she jumped on a bandwagon.
@TAW3343 You know Kirsten Gillibrand has been an advocate for her whole political career, right? Speaking out is exactly in line w/ her principles. She didn't "cash in" on anything — she decided to speak out despite the risks. And speaking tough truths to friends is part of being an ally.
One human trafficking expert said of Trump: “Either he’s watching action films or he’s watching some other type of movie that involves handcuffs and tape over people’s mouths.

@AviAhvee @CBJOHNSON143 @spookperson @aqualad08 @Zigmanfreud Yes, this. It's actually very common for people who have been sexually assaulted to have contact with the perpetrator after the assault. Just like in abusive relationships, you can't judge the degree of trauma by the response of the victim. Traumatic reactions vary greatly.

@LPeterP Kirsten Gillibrand was not the first to call for Al Franken's resignation. Chuck Schumer was the first; he did so privately. Gillibrand was the first to do so publicly, by a matter of minutes. 		Al Franken admitted his behavior was wrong. But Gillibrand is wrong for saying so?
Putting aside the fact that Kirsten Gillibrand wasn't the ringleader (and Schumer privately called for Al Franken's resignation before she did), are you really implying that lawmakers should stay silent on sexual assault to protect a seat? 		(FYI: A great woman filled his seat) https://t.co/q4nxYFbb2D
@IrishPatty54 @LPeterP Kirsten Gillibrand has devoted her career to advocating for sexual assault victims. This is in line with her entire political career. Your description of this as unscrupulous is demeaning and condescending.
@radicalstates @sandyknauer ... and then he resigned before waiting for an investigation to be carried out.
@radicalstates Al Franken admitted that his behavior "crossed a line." And as I've stated, saying it's wrong to blame Kirsten Gillibrand for Al Franken's resignation is not a statement about her as a candidate, or about her positions on other issues.
@yayafong My position has nothing to do with her chances as a candidate. I'm not backing Kirsten Gillibrand's campaign. I'm speaking out against those who are unfairly blaming her for Al Franken's resignation, b/c it speaks to a broader problem of blaming women for men's transgressions.
@trumpathetic @yayafong If holding a man accountable for allegations of sexual assault alienates voters, that's not a reason to be angry at Kirsten Gillibrand -- that's a reason to be worried about our society. And she was not alone in calling for his resignation, so why is she being held responsible?

Here's the thing: Al Franken resigned. He's gone. Blaming Kirsten Gillibrand is not going to bring him back. But you know what it will do? Unnecessarily create a rift among Democratic voters &amp; provide a perfect target for any bad actors looking to divide the left in 2020. 15/
@PhyddleDD @MattAsherS This is patently false.
@HoarseWisperer @MattAsherS I guess I lumped that in with "moral grounds", but yes: I don't think he resigned because another senator told him to.
@MattAsherS Exactly. All of the people blaming Kirsten Gillibrand for Franken's resignation are not even considering that maybe he resigned on his account because he thought it was the best thing to do for the future of the party, and the right thing to do on moral grounds.
@charles_gaba Exactly. I think he saw that, and I think he saw that he was changing the narrative in a way that could seriously damage Democrats' credibility in this area for a long time.
@charles_gaba Exactly. I've always assumed he considered the implications of not resigning. He's not a novice. He understands politics and cultural movements, and I think he saw that he would harm the Democratic Party by taking center stage in any future discussions of sexual assault.
@sandibachom @JackPosobiec @Cernovich By then, whispers about the accusation were already spreading in some newsrooms. Based on Stone's history, it appears as though he caught wind of the coming accusations and seized on them to 1) self-promote, and 2) divide the left over a really hot-button issue at a boiling point
@sandyknauer @StarinaJohnson @GarrettRuby How did she smear him?
@sandyknauer Excuse me? Did you just call me uninformed about right-wing disinformation operations -- the very thing I study and write about on a near-daily basis? 		I was asking what right-wing network you were referring to. You can disagree w/ me all you want, but don't call me uninformed.
@sandibachom No, I know how Roger Stone operates. He's a well-connected troll who is really good at finding divisive issues and exploiting them to his benefit. 		And let's say he was involved: So now Kirsten Gillibrand is responsible for his behavior, too?
I just hope those of you who are channeling your anger over Al Franken's resignation at Kirsten Gillibrand will consider the bigger picture. Do you think it's acceptable to encourage women to stay silent to protect men? Because that's what you're doing. 14/
RT @ilyseh: ALL OF THIS. It's amazing that women are simultaneously too weak to lead AND so all powerful that we can force a formidable man…
@sandyknauer @GrnMtnBot Yes. And I heard him admit that his own behavior was wrong and "crossed a line." 		Kirsten Gillibrand has dedicated her career to advocating for sexual assault victims. Writing her off as a "knee jerk reactionary" who wanted media attention is dismissive and condescending.
@sandyknauer 1. What "RW net" are you referring to?		2. I am a "real" victim. So please don't even try to go that route.
@GrnMtnBot @sandyknauer Al Franken called for an investigation and didn't stick around long enough to see it through. And that's Kirsten Gillibrand's fault ... how?
@sandyknauer @StarinaJohnson @GarrettRuby The truth is that Al Franken is a human being with his own agency. No one forced him to do anything. You are not being honest with yourself if you think the truth is that Kirsten Gillibrand is responsible for his resignation.
For those who like Al Franken and blame Kirsten Gillibrand for his resignation: Have you ever considered that Franken believed resigning was the right thing to do? That maybe he didn't want the Democratic Party to lose all credibility on matters related to sexual assault? 13/
Al Franken *admitted* to wrongdoing. He said his behavior "crossed a line." Yet Kirsten Gillibrand is receiving more anger for saying his behavior was wrong than the man who said it himself. If you don't see a problem with that, well, maybe that's because you're part of it. 12/
I was devastated when the accusations against Al Franken came out. But I was more devastated when I realized that so many self-declared progressives were willing to overlook those accusations to save a man's career -- and to ruin a woman's career for not overlooking them. 11/
The true test of our principles is whether we apply them to our friends just as we do our adversaries. Kirsten Gillibrand could have saved herself a lot of trouble by staying quiet about Al Franken. But that would have impeded her efforts to help survivors. So she spoke up. 10/
@sandyknauer How did she make it harder on everyone? How did her words make anything harder on anyone? 		Al Franken had the power to call for an investigation. He didn't. Why isn't that "unforgivable"? Why is Gillibrand the only one being punished?
@sandyknauer @GarrettRuby Where did I say that? Please point to the words that support your assertion. 		You know what's dangerous? Being so blinded by partisanship that you would be willing to compromise your principles just to protect someone on your "team".
Gillibrand knew she was taking a risk when she spoke out about Al Franken. Our culture reserves a special type of rage for women who report sexual violence, &amp; it extends to women who publicly stand with victims even when it means speaking hard truths to a colleague and friend. 9/
And for those who don't think the allegations against Al Franken (by 8 different women) were credible: Why are you lashing out at Kirsten Gillibrand? Why aren't you angry at Al Franken for resigning before an investigation? Perhaps because you know he resigned for good reason. 8/
Again, regardless of what you think of her candidacy, Gillibrand is a leading voice on sexual assault. Her call for Al Franken to resign was entirely consistent with her principles. You say you want principled leaders, but then you vilify Gillibrand for being too principled. 7/
And for many of those replying to this thread: Remember when Republicans attacked Christine Blasey Ford? Why, when it comes to our own, do you suddenly find it acceptable to shame the woman who spoke out about the problem?		You're not an ally if your support is conditional. 6/
Our culture doesn't like powerful women (2016? anyone?), so when a woman like Kirsten Gillibrand dares to wield any power, her motives are called into question; her courage portrayed as "opportunism"; her strength framed as ruthlessness; her conviction cast as selfishness. 5/
The message you're sending, whether intentional or not, is that women who speak out against men who are credibly accused of sexual assault should expect to be vilified, disparaged, and used as an example to warn others to stay silent -- or face the same consequences. 4/
We live in a society that minimizes sexual violence and punishes both victims &amp; those who stand with them. Men’s careers &amp; reputations are assigned more value than women’s lives. Think about the message you're sending by punishing Kirsten Gillibrand for Al Franken's behavior. 3/
Kirsten Gillibrand doesn't have the power to force another senator to resign. Al Franken chose to resign; he was not forced out by one senator's statement.		Or maybe you don't like the way the accusations were handled ... but Gillibrand isn't responsible for that, either. 2/
Whatever you think of Kirsten Gillibrand, she is not responsible for Al Franken's behavior nor his resignation. Chuck Schumer reportedly told him privately to resign before Gillibrand said anything. She was the 1st to publicly call for his resignation - by a matter of minutes. 1/

In December, Mueller filed a memo (link below) alleging that Paul Manafort lied to prosecutors about a $125,000 payment made in 2017 from Rebuilding America Now towards Manafort’s debt. So that's what is being referenced in today's filing. 4/		https://t.co/G2Znl0IGvG

This likely breaks an FEC rule requiring a 120-day cooling-off period before a campaign staffer can play a role in a super PAC supporting that campaign. Rebuilding America ran its 1st pro-Trump ad less than 50 days after McKay &amp; Gay joined the campaign. 2/	https://t.co/zt0IUo0XSw

@kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec Tulsi has visited Syria to meet with Assad personally. She also denied his involvement in using chemical weapons against his own people. And she opposes US involvement in Syria, but cheered on Russia's indiscriminate bombing of populated areas in Syria. And she's very anti-LGBTQ.
@kathygriffin @AltUSPressSec We set up the crowdfunding page as soon as she announced her candidacy b/c we've been worried about her for months.

@GageScavitti @leahmcelrath It takes integrity to admit when you've slipped up, and most people (myself included) have a lot of respect for this type of honest self-reflection :)
@leahmcelrath Yes, exactly. And it doesn't take away from the value of unique commentary/analysis to acknowledge that the source material was discovered by someone else.
@leahmcelrath I used the good old h/t earlier today to give a nod to someone who flagged a video clip that I used in an article. I cited her in the article, but since Twitter is its own little niche, I like to give the public nod. 		and agreed, it's just good etiquette &amp; a sign of respect.
I know this isn't always intentional, &amp; the nature of social media can make it hard to find the person who first "re-discovered" the material. But if you see an old video/tweet circulating, just consider that someone spent time finding it. It didn't just reappear on its own.
If someone spends time digging through old materials online and discovers a forgotten video or tweet from the past that suddenly takes on new importance in light of current events, it's kinda shitty to take that material, use it, &amp; not even give a nod to the person who found it.

If you recall, Democrats tried to get translator Marina Gross to testify about what was discussed during Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki. But once again, Republicans like Lindsey Graham shielded Trump &amp; put national security at risk in the process.		https://t.co/nxEWlTobZY
After Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where no other US officials were allowed in the room, Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said Trump &amp; Putin had reached “important verbal agreements" ... but US officials had no idea what those agreements were. https://t.co/A0fLApnX9g
Among the many implications of this: By keeping the content of his discussions with Putin a secret, Trump is putting the US at a huge strategic disadvantage. He's giving the Kremlin the opportunity to disclose what was discussed &amp; to frame it in a way that is favorable to Russia.
The US has "no detailed record, even in classified files, of Trump’s face-to-face interactions with [Putin] at five locations over the past two years."		But you know who does have a record of what was discussed? Russia... which gives Putin pretty clear leverage over Trump. https://t.co/oLCFE1BJea
Trump’s secrecy surrounding Putin “is not only unusual by historical standards, it is outrageous,” said Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state now at the Brookings Institution.		“It handicaps the US government ...[and] gives Putin much more scope to manipulate Trump.” https://t.co/dj0LEHaXpx
This is "part of a broader pattern by [Trump] of shielding his communications w/ Putin from public scrutiny &amp; preventing even high-ranking officials in his own administration from fully knowing what he has told one of the United States’ main adversaries."	https://t.co/S75fW94wVr
To keep his conversations with Putin a secret, Trump took the notes from his own interpreter and then instructed them not to discuss what transpired with members *of his own administration.*		He's hiding his discussions with Putin ... from his own administration. https://t.co/bMGWf3XfBt
NEW: Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations w/ Putin, including on at least 1 occasion taking possession of the notes of his own interpreter.		There is no record, even in classified files, of his meetings w/ Putin.	https://t.co/hSLqTndujw
When @CNN asked today if he was aware of the existence of this counterintelligence investigation (given his brief former role as CIA Director), Mike Pompeo refused to answer, saying the question wasn't "worthy of a response" ... https://t.co/BTwOmKh7xH
@DaveWeasel Yea the article was not very clear about this (I'm guessing because that information would be kept so closely guarded). But my understanding is that it's still active. Lawfare has a good take on things that also looks at it as an open investigation (https://t.co/wN4X7F7Kja).
@DaveWeasel It appears to be ongoing, merged with Mueller's investigation. Counterintelligence investigations are typically very long (years) &amp; quiet; the end result is often intelligence that we never hear about. (In this case, though, there is also a parallel criminal probe).

RT @juliawb: Informative thread, with receipts, as always. https://t.co/GaVhD2zStW
We don't know what data Manafort &amp; Gates passed to Kilimnik, but it's possible that it was data collected by Cambridge Analytica, under Steve Bannon's direction, which then made its way to Lyovochkin, the oligarch who Sam Patten worked for while working for Cambridge Analytica.

@katestarbird Absolutely agree. Paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, and similar symptoms of mental illnesses can drive people to seek out conspiracy theories/make them more appealing, and conspiracy theories can validate paranoid beliefs, delusions, etc. It's a cycle.
@katestarbird Yes exactly - the lizard people conspiracy is one of the more widespread conspiracies out there, from what I've seen, because it crosses over with so many other conspiracy communities. It's a pretty dominant theme among the Q-Anon crowd.
@katestarbird Yea I went to the guy's Facebook page and it was clear pretty quickly that he is not alone (in his FB network) in his beliefs. He also posted a lot of conspiratorial content from other platforms like reddit, where he fed off the conspiratorial beliefs of other Q-Anon fans.

Another key detail in tonight's @nytimes piece: At least some of the data Paul Manafort and Rick Gates passed along to Konstantin Kilimnik was **internal** campaign data developed by a private polling firm working for the Trump campaign. This wasn't clear earlier today. https://t.co/1R5Ci5MCM5
@danamo The long, messy way of saying "SO MANY CRIMINALS"
Per @nytimes (tonight), the polling data that Paul Manafort (and Rick Gates) gave to Konstantin Kilimnik ultimately went to Oleg Deripaska, a Putin ally to whom Manafort was deeply indebted. At one point, Manafort offered to give Deripaska private briefings on the campaign. https://t.co/ZV9xleJm0S
NEW: Both Paul Manafort &amp; Rick Gates sent polling data to Russian operative Konstantin Kilimnik in the Spring of 2016, as Trump clinched the nomination. Manafort then asked Gates to tell Kilimnik to pass the data to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. https://t.co/Aq2QB0qFUM

"That address should have come with a Surgeon General's warning. It was hazardous to the truth." -@Acosta commenting on tonight's #TrumpAddress.
Notably, despite Trump's claim that there is a "crisis" at the border that must be addressed immediately, he did not declare a national emergency tonight. He simply shifted responsibility back to Congress so he can go back to doing nothing.
Nancy Pelosi's response to the #TrumpAddress is on-point: "President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government."
As expected, Trump tried to make his case by using anecdotes and scare-stories without presenting any data or statistics whatsoever. 		We don't make policy based on isolated incidents &amp; personal stories; we make policies based on evidence. Trump has none.
Despite what Trump claims, Democrats have consistently said they're willing to fund border security measures. They're just not willing to fund an ineffective wall that no one wants.
Trump is fearmongering about drugs coming through the border, but most illicit drugs come through legal ports of entry. A wall won't stop any of that. 		https://t.co/8H1FsgfWC3
"1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted on the trek [to the border]," says the guy who bragged about sexually assaulting women.
&lt;pausing for the address&gt;
Here we go. #TrumpAddress has begun. I'll be adding to this thread throughout.
Trump's lies are propaganda. It's not about persuasion. It's about power -- the power to get all major news networks to disrupt regular programming for him; the power to reach millions of Americans to fearmonger about a manufactured crisis; the power to redefine reality. 7/
Our brains are not equipped to deal with lies when they come at us repeatedly in such a high volume. Repeated exposure to a claim, regardless of whether or not it's true, increases its acceptance as true b/c repetition leads to familiarity, and familiarity leads to acceptance. 6/
Emotions resonate more strongly than facts. And emotions guide our decision-making far more than most of us would like to acknowledge.		Fear is a very potent emotion, and it will influence how people receive Trump's speech AND how they receive attempts to fact-check it. 5/
A speech like this is not something that happens very often, and when it does, it is usually reserved for *actual* emergencies. Trump knows this. He is using the performative element of the address to tap into people's emotions (esp. fear). You can't fact-check emotions. 4/
First of all, Trump's words are only part of the performance he's putting on. When the president interrupts regular programming to deliver a special speech about an "emergency" and a "crisis" at the border, that sends a message and fosters a sense of importance and urgency. 3/
I'll start by saying that fact-checking is better than no fact-checking. But even the best, most thorough and timely fact-checking won't come close to undoing the damage of letting Trump interrupt regular evening programming to spread propaganda from the Oval Office. 2/
With a lot of attention focused on fact-checking ahead of the #TrumpAddress tonight, it's important to keep a few things in mind regarding the effectiveness of fact-checking when faced with the volume &amp; style of lies that Trump tells. 1/

If the shutdown drags on into February, **millions** of tenants who rely on HUD for assistance will be at risk of getting kicked out of their homes.		https://t.co/gGiaRuo0HW
95% of HUD employees are furloughed due to Trump's shutdown, so many routine activities have been put on hold -- including mandatory health &amp; safety inspections of HUD-funded properties for low-income Americans, the elderly, &amp; people with disabilities. https://t.co/gGiaRuo0HW
The Trump admin literally didn't know that payments from the federal program that covers many tenants in HUD-funded housing ended on Jan. 1. It can't be renewed b/c of the shutdown.		Now, countless low-income Americans are at risk of being evicted.	https://t.co/yT5D99b3eO
And re. his question about 2020: Of course it's important for Democratic candidates to consider weaknesses in 2016 strategy as we move into the next presidential election. Just as it's important to consider how those candidates may be targeted &amp; weakened by information warfare.
And intellectually dishonest Twitter users are still trying to:	1) setting up strawmen and then "winning" an argument that no one made, and	2) claim that the impact of Hillary Clinton's campaign decisions &amp; Russian information warfare are mutually exclusive.		this is sad. https://t.co/g1KwqfWHHZ
@lrozen Yes, definitely. I'm filing this under "looking for the data to be used" because even if Manafort's motives were more in the self-interest realm, I have to assume he knew the data would not just be discarded once it made it into the right hands.
So just to sum things up:	1) As campaign chairman, Paul Manafort met with and shared sensitive polling data with Russian operative Konstantin Kilimnik.	2) Manafort &amp; Kilimnik then discussed a "Ukrainian peace plan."	3) Manafort then lied about it.
Why would Paul Manafort share sensitive polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik -- a man who has been ID'd by Mueller as an operative with active ties to a "Russian intelligence service" -- if he wasn't looking for that data to be used? What other possible reason is there? 5/
CNN reported in Oct. 2017 that Russian Facebook ads were "highly sophisticated in their targeting of key demographic groups in areas of the states that turned out to be pivotal." 		You need data for that. The kind of data that Manafort allegedly shared. 4/	https://t.co/5meh1VYcqi https://t.co/Mw5SNGl3s7
Paul Manafort appears to have played an important role in the Trump campaign's last-minute decision to shift resources to Michigan and Wisconsin. 		The key question here is, did the campaign amplify its efforts with the help of foreign operatives? 3/ 		https://t.co/tsrhk5PTOI
Also: The Trump campaign relied heavily on highly targeted Facebook content to reach its desired audience, and it has been reported that the campaign suddenly shifted resources to Rust Belt states like Michigan, Wisconsin, &amp; Pennsylvania in the final weeks of the campaign. 2/
Russian Facebook ads specifically targeted battleground states including Wisconsin &amp; Michigan. Trump won both states by less than a 1% margin. Michigan was the closest race in the country, with Trump edging out Clinton by less than 11,000 votes out of 4.8 million ballots cast. 1/
One of the key questions investigators have been trying to answer is whether Russian operatives had help from the Trump campaign when deciding where to target during their 2016 influence operation. 		Manafort's court filing may have answered that question.	https://t.co/ZZF83YPYCs

@Blackamazon A girl can dream, right? 😐
@Blackamazon Yes, exactly. And with blinders on in terms of the historical context (e.g., saying the Russia probe has gone on for so long, w/ no mention that over the past 4 decades, the average special counsel investigation has lasted over 5 years -- &amp; most have NOT yielded criminal charges)
@tannenbaumr She also seems to be implying that journalism must bend to society's shortening attention span by failing to cover the full story, rather than finding new ways to cover the story without cutting corners.
RT @Blackamazon: @RVAwonk Sadly it’s where a lot of the discussions that have plagued journalism end : Journalism has decided that the prof…
@Blackamazon Yes, this. I am bothered by the notion that an editor believes it is her job to decide what is serious enough for the public to be informed of.
RT @tannenbaumr: @RVAwonk Best-case interpretation: She's saying journalism, in its current state, is ill-equipped to help people understan…
As new developments arise in the Russia probe, the question is not, "What is serious?" Rather, the question that editors and journalists should be asking is, "How do I convey the seriousness of this development in a way that makes it clear and accessible to the public?" 6/
The entire Russia investigation is serious. When I hear that an editor is having trouble figuring out what is "serious," I question whether she's actually considering what is serious, or if she's really just looking for what makes a clean, catchy headline/story. 5/
@guygavrielkay This, precisely. And it's very troubling to hear this coming from an editor at a major media platform.
RT @guygavrielkay: Acute comment from Caroline. In essence, a senior media figure is saying the media is — or has been — incapable of provi…
This style of framing (episodic) also fails to contextualize the Russia probe in terms of how it compares to other special counsel investigations. In this context, the Russia probe is still in its infancy, yet it has already yielded a slew of criminal charges &amp; convictions. 4/
In general, the Russia probe has been covered episodically, which makes it hard for the public to understand why things like Paul Manafort's work in Ukraine is relevant and related to the investigation into the Trump campaign's coordination with Russia. 3/
This is in contrast to thematic framing, which puts news in context, &amp; identifies trends, patterns, &amp; linkages. Rather than reporting on each development as an isolated event, this type of news frame ties things together &amp; explains the significance. 2/		https://t.co/BVgPtYvlZb
This comment by an @AP editor seems to speak more to the quality/style of reporting on the Russia probe than the probe itself. Much of the reporting in this area uses episodic framing -- i.e., focusing narrowly on specific individuals &amp; events, w/o contextualizing the news. 1/
This is deeply troubling coming from an @AP editor. 		Over the past 4 decades, special counsel investigations have averaged more than 5 years in duration. The Russia probe isn't even at the 2-year mark. 		As for the issue of what's serious: What part of this ISN'T serious? https://t.co/sssAbIyyk7

@tsteele93 @MattAsherS @RichardEngel I'm writing something on the topic now, so I'll have a piece to add to your reading list shortly :) Thanks for the discussion.

@MattAsherS @tsteele93 @RichardEngel Yes. Russian disinformation has changed the way the world sees Syria, which in turn has weakened support for military or humanitarian intervention. It has also silenced the voices of Syrians and replaced them with the regime's narrative.
@tsteele93 @RichardEngel UK &amp; France have a presence in Syria, &amp; at one point some of our other EU allies were ready to intervene -- but at that time, the US did not have the political will to intervene. And the disinfo campaign surrounding the refugee crisis has created a lot of hostility &amp; resistance.
@MattAsherS @tsteele93 @RichardEngel And we can avoid these types of incidents by abiding by standard rules of engagement. If I remember correctly, Russia breached the rules of engagement several times by failing to notify US forces of air operations and by flying their warplanes through no-fly zones.
@tsteele93 @RichardEngel In general, I agree that we shouldn't be the world's police force. But I also don't believe we should sit back and watch as a dictator, propped up by another dictator, tortures and massacres civilians as a means of maintaining power. There's a time for humanitarian intervention.
@tsteele93 @RichardEngel It's a complicated situation and I don't think there is a "right" answer. But withdrawing troops, esp like this, risks reigniting the worst of the fighting by fracturing the fragile alliances, which would then embolden extremists and exacerbate the humanitarian &amp; refugee crises.
@tsteele93 @RichardEngel I respect your opinion &amp; that you sought out info before making a judgment, but as a Syrian American, I can't accept the humanitarian consequences for Syrian civilians, nor can I accept handing the fate of the country over to a war criminal who slaughters his own people.

@PapaSwamp Ad hominem attacks aren't going to cut it here. You know as well as I do that the UN is one of countless entities that have condemned Trump's corrosive lies. Don't like the source? Ok. But you still can't credibly deny that the assertion is true.
As Chris Hedges wrote in "Losing Moses On The Freeway", eroding public trust is one of the key elements in the creation of an authoritarian state. 		Authoritarians like Trump don't maintain power by gaining your trust, but by establishing distrust &amp; seizing upon cynicism. 8/ https://t.co/eDpIPnok1p
And perhaps most importantly, Trump wields mis/disinformation as a weapon against the press, with the goal of delegitimizing one of the few institutions that can hold him accountable. He wants to be the arbiter of truth -- and among his loyal supporters, he is (see below). 7/ https://t.co/uvIxRF06V9
When Trump spreads mis/disinformation, he's not usually doing it with the expectation that his lies will be accepted as truth. He's doing it b/c he wants to erode the notion of truth and destroy our ability to distinguish between truth &amp; falsehoods -- to kill reality itself. 6/
And that's why Trump is so committed to undermining trust in the very notion of truth. If he can cast doubt on the existence of one objective truth, he can undermine the external mechanisms that we rely on to hold leaders accountable &amp; prevent abuses of power. 5/
The act of lying is bad enough. But selling the idea that truth doesn’t matter – or doesn’t even exist – is far more corrosive. Democracy rests upon a shared understanding of basic facts. We can't debate issues or hold leaders accountable w/o these agreed upon facts. 4/
The most dangerous implication of Trump's war on the truth is that when he spreads mis/disinformation, he's not necessarily doing it because he thinks people will believe his lies. Rather, he wants to make people doubt that one objective truth even exists. 3/
@EssexCanning For journalists working at major outlets, the US is a pretty safe place. But talk to independent &amp; local journalists who cover protests, extremism, natural disasters, etc. They face real risks every day. They may not be in a war zone, but danger manifests in many ways.
@EssexCanning Yep, the report looked at journalists who were detained or held hostage in 2018. The US did not rank at the top on these metrics. It did rank as #5 for journalists killed while doing their jobs. It's not mental; it's math.
Functional societies depend on shared, socially-mediated sources of knowledge &amp; truth. Our relationships, institutions, &amp; civilization are held together by a mutual assumption of trustworthiness in knowledge-generating mechanisms. Trump is intentionally eroding this. 2/
He's right, but Trump does more than perpetrate mis/disinformation. He intentionally undermines trust in shared sources of knowledge and information, which is the glue that holds societies together. 1/		https://t.co/eCRhFuJ8Pj

This is a crucial step towards reducing maternal health disparities, but ultimately we have to address the preexisting factors -- inequities in socioeconomic status, exposure to chronic stressors, unintended pregnancy, contraceptive access, etc. -- to fully address the problem. https://t.co/rBjPBjAyxH
@RitaPanahi You don't like the way the report operationalized journalist deaths. That doesn't make it flawed. It would be flawed if they arbitrarily changed their operational definition based on subjective concerns. 		Sorry you're tired. Next time, don't start something you can't finish.
@davidmweissman @RitaPanahi Yep. Among the worst of them, too!
@RitaPanahi As I stated, and as you would know if you read the report, it *did* include an assessment of journalists who were detained or held hostage in 2018... it just didn't include these figures as deaths. Because they aren't deaths.		Whatever you're trying to do here, it's not working.
An important factor to consider when interpreting the results of assessments like this: Whether or not you like the metric used, it provides a stable indicator over time. Thus, it indicates a change when the US suddenly becomes 1 of the top 5 deadliest countries for journalists.
@RitaPanahi @GarthGodsman @skennison Or just mathematically literate.
The Reporters Without Borders report looks at several metrics, including journalists who were killed, detained, or held hostage while working in 2018. By the numbers, the US is the 5th deadliest country for journalists. It's not a matter of opinion; it's a quantitative analysis. https://t.co/YAa7vVTJM1
@RitaPanahi Digging? I am quite literally explaining the metrics to you, because apparently you didn't read the report. Also, don't insult my intelligence by citing the Free Beacon. I read the original report; I don't need a shoddy breakdown to explain what I already read.
The report on the US being a dangerous place to be a journalist is based on murdered journalists, not "hurt feelings." There is a legitimate debate to have regarding the metric used to assess press freedom &amp; safety, but casually dismissing the problem is not the way to do it. https://t.co/lu2BRR1nOu
@RobertOvadia @RitaPanahi Being murdered is not a real form of oppression?
@RitaPanahi @pressfreedom Yes, journalists in prison is a massive problem. It is not, however, the metric used in this report. The metric here is murdered journalists, which I hope you agree is also a massive problem. Not sure why you're trying to minimize the issue of murdered journalists, but ok...
@philly_cheesest @RitaPanahi The personal grudge was based on their work ... as journalists.

@DeinosPro Good question. Probably not. But most service members wouldn't turn down a gift from their commander in chief, just out of respect.

@rosenbergerlm @RonaldKlain Aaah ok I see what you're saying. I interpreted his comment in the context of the broader push by Russia to amplify divisive immigration-related issues, incl. the wall.		And re both sides: Yes, this was def apparent just yesterday, as (#)TrumpResign was also a trending hashtag.
@rosenbergerlm @RonaldKlain When I see something like this, I do assume that at least part of the trend is due to the fact that it's a trending topic, period. But I also see this as a great chance for opportunists to amplify a divisive (already trending) topic. It can be both, yes?
@neeratanden Thank you so much, Neera! That means a lot to me! ❤️		I'm still working my way to fully recovered, but I am a whole lot better than I was a few days ago! It feels good to be back :) Thank you for your kind thoughts!
As of spring 2018:		-new applications to join the foreign service fell by half in the 1st yr of Trump's presidency	-8 of 9 senior leadership positions in the State Dept = unfilled	-50 ambassadorships = vacant	-16 of 22 asst secretary positions = vacant	https://t.co/4lJkuLnr1f
@grahamlampa Here's one breakdown of the numbers. It looks like we're looking at the same figures but I'm not seeing anything about a denominator of 5. 		https://t.co/VrIcdotqsS
John Feeley resigned from his post as US Amb. to Panama in January, after more than 30 years of service with the State Dept. He was considered a "star" diplomat.		Upon resigning, he said he couldn't faithfully carry out his duty under Trump's leadership.		https://t.co/kjdexOHapy
@HankStormdrain Not on this scale, and the vacancies have never lasted this long in such huge numbers. Some turnover is to be expected, but this is unprecedented. 		(I'm about to post another article in a second that hits on some of this, if you are interested in more info on the subject).
Victor Cha was poised to be nominated as the next US ambassador to South Korea but withdrew his name from consideration in January after the Trump administration started threatening to unleash a preemptive military strike on North Korea. 	https://t.co/p26Q6Y7qY4
@grahamlampa This is not correct. The figure is not referring to ambassadors -- it's referring to diplomats (and most diplomats are, in fact, career diplomats). There are hundreds of active diplomatic missions at any given point in time.
@AviAhvee Yes, Feeley was the first of 2018. This year's mass exodus was underway within the first 2 weeks of January.
Joseph Yun served for 30+ years as a diplomat before resigning from his post as the US Special Rep. for North Korea Policy in February. His departure came amid "widespread frustration" over Trump's utter disregard for the role of diplomacy. 		https://t.co/KJZJ5G3UsB
Richard Johnson was one of the State Dept's top nuclear experts before he resigned in May. Johnson had been in talks w/ key allies trying to save the Iran nuclear deal, but Trump disregarded all of that &amp; pulled out of the deal. Johnson resigned soon after	https://t.co/Yn8kUo6V2f
James Melville served as a diplomat for 30+ years before leaving his post as US Amb. to Estonia in June. At the time of his departure, Melville said Trump's disregard for longstanding alliances was the final straw for him.		https://t.co/Ff16cqgJJ8
About 60 percent of top-ranking career diplomats have fled the State Department since Trump took office. Brett McGurk is the most recent of these departures, but he won't be the last. 		https://t.co/xAhidu63OF
Brett McGurk, the top diplomat leading the anti-ISIS coalition, joins a growing list of senior diplomats who've fled their posts due to Trump's reckless approach to "foreign policy."		Other notable exits in 2018:	-Top diplomat, NK policy	-DoS top nuclear expert	-US Amb to Estonia
@Minervasbard @DeadBunnyFrank I can think of a few...!
THIS. It may not be surprising, but we should never stop being shocked by the frequent violation of norms, laws, &amp; decency that have come to define the Trump presidency. If we're not shocked, it's because we're accepting the violation of norms as the new norm. https://t.co/b07qBFaV2Q

@lrozen My reaction, too. There are layers of stories buried within this story. (And I'm guessing this is contributing greatly to Trump's angst).
White House officials have repeatedly and consistently claimed that they've cooperated fully with Mueller's probe. 		But per @CNN: "The White House counsel's office initially fought [Mueller's] request." Emmett Flood reportedly wanted to make sure "ground rules" were negotiated.

@leahmcelrath @Fraude_1 Agreed. I look at it as somewhat of a challenge that they know they're going to win. They're basically daring Trump, knowing he isn't going to do anything. And they also do seem like they're signaling something, possibly a nod towards what they know that we don't.
@leahmcelrath @Fraude_1 Yes, exactly this. They knew the world was watching, and they knew people were watching them, specifically. And they chose to do a bro-shake, knowing very well how it would be interpreted. Doesn't smell right.

So ... this also happened in March 2016.  The same month Manafort met with Assange. 		(Also the same month Podesta's emails were hacked, which is when WikiLeaks got the speeches that they discussed paying a reward for). https://t.co/cHELxzeMRZ
RT @NatSecGeek: NEW: Technical report shows Russian hacking began hours after #WikiLeaks mentioned a reward for Clinton info in March 2016…
zomg. "Hours before Russian hacking operations targeted Hillary Clinton’s campaign in the spring of 2016, WikiLeaks discussed offering a monetary reward for transcripts of her speeches at Goldman Sachs." 		Those speeches were included in the 1st day of the Podesta email leaks. https://t.co/Su4cup3DOW

Roger Stone was the one who convinced Trump to hire Paul Manafort. The idea of hiring Manafort to work unpaid? That was Roger Stone's idea. 		This took place at some point in March 2016. The same month Manafort met with Julian Assange.		https://t.co/3ZnJ2uWNUx
2/29/2016: Manafort pitches himself to Trump via Tom Barrack, writing in a memo "I really need to get to Trump."		March 2016:	-Manafort meets Barrack at Montage hotel in Beverly Hills; discussed joining Trump campaign	-Manafort secretly meets w/Assange	-Manafort hired (3/28/2016)
holy hell. Paul Manafort held secret talks w/ Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in late March 2016. 		The month before (2/29/2016), he reached out to Trump via Tom Barrack to pitch himself as campaign chair. He was hired in March. Unpaid.	https://t.co/MHsnDHpjOm

Flashback to Sept: Rudy Giuliani released a pair of statements after Paul Manafort signed a plea deal w/ Mueller.		-In 1st statement, Giuiani expressed confidence in Manafort telling the truth	-The revised statement, released minutes later, scrubbed the reference to truth-telling https://t.co/kjZvWUIqNS
@aswinn @AshaRangappa_ @ChrisCuomo Same. I had forgotten about the joint defense agreement, but Giuliani said somewhat recently that it's still in place (despite Manafort's plea deal). So that could be interesting...!
.@AshaRangappa_ just brought up a good point with @ChrisCuomo: Per Giuliani, Trump &amp; Manafort still have a joint defense agreement, which means they can share information to get their defenses in line. So if Manafort lied, did Trump'lawyers know (and/or conspire to lie)?

The court filing alleging that Paul Manafort lied to special counsel Mueller's team comes less than 12 hours after George Papadopoulos reported to jail .. for lying to special counsel Mueller's team. https://t.co/LTVcLSrUbK
"After signing the plea agreement, [Paul] Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel’s Office on a variety of subject matters, which constitute breaches of the agreement." https://t.co/QnkTnMufYh
#BREAKING: Special counsel Mueller just released a new court filing saying that Paul Manafort has lied repeatedly to investigators SINCE PLEADING GUILTY, breaking the terms of his plea agreement. Mueller is calling for Manafort to be sentenced immediately.

Trump tells Mississippi rally that the Second Amendment is "under siege" 		... by the GOP-controlled House, Senate, &amp; White House?
Trump to Mississippi rally: 'No one knows how many zeroes are in a trillion.'
"I'm not like other politicians.... am I a politician? I don't know. I ran one time and won! One time!" Trump tells the crowd at the rally for not-him.
Trump is back to his authoritarian fear-mongering beat in Mississippi tonight, calling the asylum seeking migrants "dangerous criminal aliens" who want to "violate our border" and take your healthcare and jobs.
Trump falsely tells the Mississippi rally crowd that Republicans will protect preexisting conditions even though Trump's own admin is fighting a legal battle to destroy protections for preexisting conditions.
