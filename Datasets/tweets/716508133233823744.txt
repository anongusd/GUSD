@CBSNews Am I watching Frumpy humiliate us on the world stage? He was tagging in Pompeo for tough questions. What a gift for the graveyard shift of reporters. Frumpy got his ass handed to him by Rocket Man AND Cohen. Looks like somebody gave him the "strokin your ego" version of hearing.

@wvjoe911 @LindaRi42590135 I am curious about the part of Oklahoma he represents, and the number of people there. I lived in OK for 5 years, so I also wonder about the percentage of people in his district that have electricity in their homes. It's been 15 years, but they aren't known for embracing change.
@TheRickWilson I guess we will see if Barr really likes his son in law or really hates him.
Financial crimes need to be dealt with in a way that does not allow  wealth to keep them out of jail perpetually with expensive lawyers, only so they can continue to commit crimes to cover up crimes in an endless cycle. It's ridiculous. Now Barr's daughter is in financial crimes. https://t.co/lwt5NpkcyN
