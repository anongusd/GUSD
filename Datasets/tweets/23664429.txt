China and Russia, Aligned More Closely, Seen As Chief Security Threat to U.S.	https://t.co/KTIVQFgwsC
Intel chiefs decline to answer virtually every question asked during threats hearing by Sen. Wyden, pleading instead to discuss Khashoggi's killing and the impact of a lack of a written record of Trump's private meetings with Putin in a classified setting.
Haspel dodges when pressed by Sen. Wyden if the CIA concluded MbS was responsible for the Khashoggi murder.
Sen. Wyden gets right to it, criticizes intel chiefs for barely mentioning in their threat assessment "the threat posed by Saudi Arabia to the rule of law around the world." Follows with Q on Khashoggi killing, which Haspel says she wants to discuss in classified setting.
Sen. Cotton asked intel chiefs to raise hands if they would use Huawei or ZTE products. None did, but Coats jumped in to say "these are not all yes or no answers" and asked for classified talk.		Quite a contrast when similar Q was asked re: Kaspersky, when no objection was raised
At Senate hearing on worldwide threats, FBI Director Wray, asked about the impact of the shutdown on his workforce, said it was "incredibly negative and painful for the 37,000 men and women of the FBI and their families."

This is the news so far from this event. Rogers disputes reporting he was ever asked to by @realDonaldTrump  to publicly deny that there was evidence of Russian collusion. https://t.co/4kvZzvz0GK
Rogers adds: "I have never had a discussion with the president about collusion." Asked if he had the conversation with former chief of staff Reince Preibus about collusion, Rogers adds: "I have never had a discussion about collusion" (with the WH, I think he means)
Adm. Rogers says reporting in May 2017 that he was asked by Trump to publicly deny there was any evidence of Russian collusion was false. He declines to comment whether the conversation was documented contemporaneously by another NSA official.		Story here:	https://t.co/llHymmFhYI
Rogers basically says the NYT op-ed backfired. "you weren't elected. Use your rights as a citizen. stand up for something ... don't attempt this resistance that just feeds the narrative that you can't trust the institutions anymore." Says that has bad implications for democracy.
This #haydensecrets event at @mvhaydencenter is a study in contrasts. @GenHayden is visibly enjoying the conversation about Trump's fitness, the Woodward book and the NYT op-ed. Adm. Rogers, new to the retirement media circuit, looks at times uncomfortable.
Rogers said he worried about impact the letter would have with rank-and-file still in the IC and could further degrade Trump's trust in intel. "Pouring gasoline on the fire is not going to reduce the flame. we have another fires burning right now ... guys, this is not helping."
Former NSA/CyberCom chief Rogers says he did not sign onto letter from former intel officials protesting @JohnBrennan clearance revocation because he was "not sure it is the most effective way to address a very valid concern." #haydensecrets

@TonyaJoRiley Totally different wings of DHS deal with cyber and immigration. Top-level attention was maybe distracted, but not sure the child separation stuff had a real impact on folks in the trenches of NPPD/NCCIC etc.
@sequinpants FBI called DNC repeatedly to try to tell them they had a problem. DNC staffer was skeptical it was really the FBI and was org was slow to awaken to the problem. Both sides could have handled the situation a lot better, and so far it seems like this time around they are doing so.

@JakeLaperruque Me neither. Speaks volumes
Rep. @justinamash, the most vocal 	Republican critic of FISA in the House, has been notably absent from the #ReleaseTheMemo movement.

This was all essentially covered by @charlie_savage here, which provided a roadmap to understand what Devin Nunes really wants.		https://t.co/fI0aEKGXnt
And if the White House-Nunes connection was still not evident, this just happened https://t.co/1XAbgDvTtK
And then this happened last night, in case the predetermined conclusion of the #ReleaseTheMemo campaign wasn‚Äôt already abundantly clear https://t.co/vSrPScTVb3
So here we are. And Nunes again won‚Äôt say whether he was working directly with the Trump White House to push a surveillance abuse story. https://t.co/K5RFMmXPRW
With a law now passed that many privacy advocates said made legitimate surveillance abuse MORE likely, Nunes was able to turn back to his obsession: Alleging that an unchecked Deep State had abused surveillance powers, but only against Team Trump.
With House Intelligence Democrats by his side, Nunes engineered passage of a FISA 702 renewal bill, blocking out a bill from the Judiciary Committee that added new transparency and oversight measures. 		It passed Congress and became law earlier this month.
Just kidding. First Nunes had to make sure that a warrantless FISA surveillance program that collects data on an unknown number of Americans was renewed.
But not really. Nunes still essentially had control over the House Intelligence Committee‚Äôs proceedings, and once he was cleared of wrongful leaking he was ready to resume his search of surveillance abuses against Trump.
Nunes then recused himself from the Russia investigation while a House panel probed whether he leaked classified information in pursuit of the unmasking scandal.
We later learned that Nunes‚Äô information about ‚Äúunmasking‚Äù was laundered to him by the White House, which he tried to conceal.
First, Nunes pushed an ‚Äúunmasking‚Äù narrative ‚Äî wholly unsubstantiated and since disavowed by the Trump Justice Department ‚Äî to retroactively explain Trump‚Äôs tweets alleging Obama spying abuses against his campaign.
Lost in the memo coverage is that Devin Nunes, long among the most strident defenders of FISA-enabled spying, has spent nearly a year trying to contort interpretations of classified surveillance orders to fit a political agenda.

These surveillance conspiracies obstructed more legitimate debate in 2017 over Sec. 702. To buy into them now for some last-minute Hail Mary to achieve a desired policy goal is not a good look.
Privacy advocates who are trying to legitimize the HPSCI "memo" to score anti-surveillance points on Section 702 or other unrelated issues are embarrassing themselves and being intellectually dishonest.

Dear Twitter: It has been fun covering the fight over 702 reauthorization, which essentially began in 2013 with the Snowden leaks and ramped up considerably last year. I hope my coverage was insightful. Apologies to any time I came up short.		See you in 2023.
By a vote of 65-34, the U.S. Senate just passed a bill to renew for six years Sec. 702 of FISA, which authorizes a foreign intelligence program that does not require individualized warrants and incidentally collects communications belonging to an unknown number of Americans.
Sen. Ted Cruz, who voted against cloture on Sec. 702 spying renewal on Tuesday, votes for the bill on final passage.
Enough senators have voted to renew the NSA's warrantless surveillance program for six years. It will now head to President Trump's desk. Despite his tweets of confusion last week, he is expected to sign it into law.

SEN. KENNEDY VOTES AYE. Dagger to Team Privacy that was aggressively trying to persuade him on the Senate floor. Vote stands at 59-38. (59-39 with McCain out.)
@JakeLaperruque @LizaGoitein Lot of uncertainty here. Senate aide told me it was Perdue, but I have him on my AYEs list. Others say Cochran, also have him on my AYEs. I do not have Sullivan but I missed a few ayes at the beginning.
@LizaGoitein Is it for sure Sen. Perdue?
You know it's a crazy vote when even C-SPAN doesn't know all the votes that are still outstanding. Am told by an observant Senate aide that Sen. Perdue has yet to vote in addition to McCaskill, Kennedy and McCain, but I have his name on my list. May have misheard it earlier.
UPDATE: We have reached the part of the lengthy still ongoing vote where multiple Senate aides have complained to me about not having dinner yet.
Kennedy and McCaskill hold all the cards right now. https://t.co/GcdS2Czt8R

@mmasnick @SarahStV_HRW @Ashkhen @Richardson_Mich Yep. Anyone have Booker?
UPDATE: Vote now stands at edge-of-your-seat 58-38; voting continues. 		With McCain out vote is effectively at 58-39. Each side needs two votes.
