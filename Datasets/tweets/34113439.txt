"Politicians who follow McConnell‚Äôs cynical lead may soon find themselves on the same downward trajectory as the fossil fuel industry they will do anything to support.‚Äù
"McConnell may think this is a savvy political move to hurt his opponents, but the fact is the American people overwhelmingly support the vision of the #GreenNewDeal."
"After all, McConnell is the person who jammed through a tax scam for billionaires on the backs of working class people and, just 24 hours ago, pushed to bailout uneconomical and dangerous coal plants."
‚ÄúMitch McConnell is once again playing games with the livelihoods of people across this country. Let‚Äôs be clear: McConnell does not care about tackling the climate crisis or inequity -- he cares about trying to distort reality for political purposes." #GreenNewDeal

"Trump‚Äôs obsession with a dangerous border wall isn‚Äôt solving his imaginary crisis on our border, but adding to the crisis he manufactured with this 35 day shutdown, putting hundreds of thousands of people out of work, upending vital govt services, &amp; damaging our national parks."
"Trump lost because the public and common sense are not on his side, but the damage done and threats made show he treats the American people, border communities, and asylum seekers as pawns in his political games."
"For more than a month, Donald Trump toyed with the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of American families, causing untold damage to the economy, our environment and American families in his attempt to get more funding for his destructive border wall." - @bruneski
