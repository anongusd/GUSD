Funniest line in the conversation is when Mike talks about being about 45 minutes out of Atlanta, and then inside the culture of Georgia.
What I appreciate about it is that it is a conversation between people who know and like each other, and don't see everything from one angle. Nor do they expect anyone else to subscribe to "one true way." They are realists, and as Mike puts it, "56 years out of apartheid."

5/6 Nope, it was: turn a good man into a pinata, and whack away with the knives. A politically savage act I'd not seen before in my lifetime.
4/6 Nevermind that he and Merrick Garland agreed in their judicial opinions 93% of the time, and the "but Garland" group could very nearly have seen this as the R version of Garland (had they wanted).
3/6 ..against a POTUS they didn't like, didn't support (even as the Office), and wanted to take down more than anything else. If they can't impeach POTUS, well, here's a good proxy, a sacrificial goat.
2/6 It was a premeditated series of acts to destroy a decent man, his reputation, and his professional life's work. It was a political op designed to smear a man in public with the aid of a complicit media, who wanted nothing more than to score points...
1/6 Summary of the #Kavanaugh confirmation process:  What I see in how the Ds dealt with him is deliberate cruelty, malice, and inhumanity. Far in excess of political gamesmanship over a vote.
@NateSilver538 At least some of the damage done to Kavanaugh, his reputation and relationships is irreparable. It was done - with malice - to a man known across the political and legal spectrum for his decency. There is no goodwill left when the jackals savage an innocent.

@rickhasen Strong, but myopic. Making the claim that "no one" who felt the impact of Judge Kavanaugh's anger could believe he would be impartial as a justice is patently false. I, for one, felt it &amp; have no such concerns. My Twitter feed has dozens of others similarly unaffected.

@unseen1_unseen What the Ds did with Ford's allegations was to smear a decent man, a decent human being, who has given his life to public service. The allegations merited a quiet, confidential investigation - but they sacrificed Ford's privacy, too. The only potential win was political. Gross.
.@jpodhoretz writes what has been stuck in the back of my mind, and what I've noticed that my progressive friends are oblivious to: Kavanaugh's comments were a "breach of judicial etiquette" but only a fool would abide by those when falsely accused of sexual assault/gang rape. https://t.co/WIFi70Dets

@Vet47Army @ConstantineKAG Even prostitutes have the right to choose who gets their services - so even if she did it with an Army battalion, that is IRRELEVANT to her allegations. Nor does the number of her hookups directly clear Kavanaugh. Unless one of them happened July 1, 1982.

@armandlaurin48 @perfectsliders @FBI The optics of Dr Ford saying she's "too busy" after she has *requested* an FBI investigation would be really, really bad. Not going to go that way.
@armandlaurin48 @perfectsliders @FBI I disagree. This is leading into his victory lap.
@armandlaurin48 @perfectsliders @FBI I get that. But the centrist Rs will have the cover they want, as will some red-state Ds. Lindsay Graham is right - takes at least 50 votes to get the confirmation through, and I believe it will happen on or before next weekend.
@armandlaurin48 @perfectsliders @FBI This: https://t.co/Xdn0k7Q3Fl
@armandlaurin48 @perfectsliders @FBI For those who are doing it purely as a political ploy, I don't care about them. Of course, there will be some add'l stupid allegations! I'm expecting someone to say BK sacrifices children to Molech by the time we're done. I'd *like* him cleared of Ford's allegations, if possible.
@JohnWHuber Agreeing to the up-to-one-week-and-only-current-allegations-in-question investigation is a smart thing. The FBI will be able to blow holes in accusations 2 &amp; 3, do complete interviews w/Ford &amp; those alleged present &amp; get it done w/o grandstanding. Ends up + for BK
@Fuctupmind But at that point, there will be no *legal* (potentially criminal) reason to oppose his confirmation. Just political ones that already existed. [yawn] I can live with that.		Just so we're clear, I believe #Kavanaugh is 100% innocent of the accusations.
@petrell01 @NateSilver538 Just saw (and reposted) a tweet with a letter from Montgomery County PD. The law in 1982 was that the alleged crimes were a misdemeanor and had a 1 yr statute of limitations. Also, the victim has to be the one who files the complaint. No criminal risk for anyone involved.
@perfectsliders @FBI I support it, even though I believe it will find nothing to prove Ford's claims. If anything, I expect it may find more to exonerate #Kavanaugh - which will be good for the country.

@RichSchneider6 @Herbert_L_Reed @steph93065 That does, yes. And, I never expected that the polygraph, taken as a political measure, would actually mimic what any LE would actually set up.
3rd thing that sticks out - #ChristineBlaseyFord occurs to me as (almost extraordinarily) naive, and alternately very educated and amazingly uninformed. In other words, she seems like a true academic. I've known a few people like her. They really do need help navigating life.
@mattdpearce What I got out of that was that her attorneys abused her trust, didn't do right by #Ford, and still may not have her best interests as their central focus. (Quelle surprise!)
@RichSchneider6 @Herbert_L_Reed @steph93065 Not if they were using their best professional judgment. But that doesn't mean that they might not, if the attorneys demanded it and their client consented. I don't believe her attys have been straight with her through this process. She's been abused by them as much as anyone.
.@ChuckGrassley - THANK YOU for having Ms. Mitchell do the questioning. She is clearly empathetic, firm, clear, and absolutely well-chosen. In my view, you are doing the right thing, both for #Ford and for #Kavanaugh. Whatever the pundits say, I thank you for choosing this route
Really disappointed in Chris Wallace @FoxNews. He's missed the whole point. Mitchell is both committed to well-being of victims (including #Ford), &amp; clear about how Ds &amp; her attorneys used her. She was *exactly* what Rs needed.
@KatiePavlich @jellen805 To be fair, she stepped through the looking glass in early July, and it has gotten only weirder and more bizarre as time has gone along. Her life is anything but normal - she's just getting through this, one day at a time.
@sbg1 He's already on record (under penalty of perjury) saying it didn't happen, no such party. How many times should he have to say that before it's accepted that that is his testimony?
@TheJordanRachel @tgd55 It's not uncommon for people to disassociate (?) when they are acutely uncomfortable.
Other thing that sticks out is that Ds seem to think, all evidence to the contrary, that the FBI is flawless in their investigations.
The thing that sticks out for me in the D questions of #Ford is that they are very focused on having her re-live &amp; re-experience that event in the present. They do her no good. If this is how they handle victims, we are better off that they don't currently practice law.
@Fat_Al_NYC @ChurchillZoe @NoahCRothman @GarrettHaake @dmataconis All I'm seeing is someone trying to clarify facts, and get to more. She's absolutely not being confrontational.
@imillhiser Who do you think a sex-crimes prosecutor goes after?
@karol I have no doubt she was assaulted. I also have no doubt that he wasn't the guy.
Oh, this is wrong! Feinstein is getting Ramirez' &amp; Swetnik's claims on the record, even though neither woman has been willing to work with the SJC. Trial by media/ordeal.
@amyklobuchar It's weird that 6 previously conducted FBI background checks showed absolutely no trace of any sexual misconduct, but we're asked to believe that a brand new one would absolutely show BK as a party frat animal.
@DeplorableChoir What you're expecting/demanding is unrealistic. Eyewitness testimony is *always* problematic. If 2/3 of a group of highly trained Army personnel can't accurately ID an interrogator after 30-40 minutes with them, it's dingbat to expect at 15yo to do better: https://t.co/Ue5rmYnn1d
Facts matter. Evidence matters. People matter - both victims and accused. Using faulty statistics to say that lying about assault is so rare, we don't really have to consider it in this case? That's dishonest and harmful to people &amp; society at large. #FactsMatter #Kavanaugh https://t.co/3VbaLU8W1H
@IonaItalia Only problem - Trump refers to those who immigrate *illegally* - not "all immigrants." Wish the Marshall people had kept that distinction instead of conflating it to "all" immigrants.
@ourrepublic76 @guypbenson @billpostmus There's no statute of limitations on Ford's allegations. But - may still not be prosecutable as a felony. The level of horseplay between the 2 drunk guys (per Ford) doesn't sound like they were serious about the attack. No exposed body parts? Scary, yes. Serious? Maybe.
@RDSUK @KatMcKinley @JohnCornyn @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe. I'm hoping that 1) Kavanaugh is confirmed, 2) Legal action taken for defamation where possible, 3) Feinstein &amp; more referred to Ethics Committee, censured at minimum, ideally expelled from Senate, and 4) Rs win the midterms - by a lot.

@codispiti @emzanotti The only way sex abuse &amp; crimes become socially unacceptable (ever &amp; always) is when victims give up their shame long enough to report it anyway.

@PattyMurray No, Senator. Feinstein's malfeasance in treating the allegations as serious, sitting on them for over 6 weeks, &amp; an accuser who's been reluctant to risk making her complaint formal (under penalty of perjury), have caused unnecessary delays. This is pure partisan hackery.

@PatriotPrimer @MisterB76428978 @drawandstrike Supposedly so. He wanted her to testify on Monday or else proceed to vote. Since she's not doing Monday (or any time), if he's consistent, he'll support the vote.
@Caliicoder3 I am fairly certain that it won't be wiped out, in part because I believe POTUS warned him up front it was likely to get ugly, and in part because there is nothing "there" to "get" him on. He and his family will get through this. The Ds don't have many arrows left in the quiver.

@ughimsotiredzzz Your comments are now bouncing all over the place. We're done on this.		Be well.
@ughimsotiredzzz I don't understand your question, unless you're back at Garland again? Garland is not the one suspended in the land of waiting for the Senate to confirm or deny. Kavanaugh is.
@DineshDSouza @JessieJaneDuff Of course they wouldn't. But this is a good faith gesture, and those *are* important, especially in these crazy times.
@ughimsotiredzzz Rewarding Senators for sitting on criminal allegations until after the hearings are over is unspeakably unprincipled. It is WRONG - and hurts everyone involved, except the partisans who did it.
@ughimsotiredzzz First step in any investigation is getting the allegations *on the record* - which hasn't happened yet. If she testifies and IF there's anything to investigate, then yes, investigate. But right now, her delay in going on the record is the kink in the hose.
@ughimsotiredzzz It's right up there with the joke about the guy asking for mercy from a judge on the basis he's an orphan - and the crime he's accused of is murdering his parents.
@ughimsotiredzzz See my tweets 19 &amp; 20. Politics was inserted by the Ds in what can only be described as "bad faith" &amp; partisan. They cannot now complain about "rushing" when they are the ones who suppressed investgating the allegations for weeks.
@ughimsotiredzzz I believe it is better for the USA to have a full Court. The delay with Garland was purely political, even if consistent w/precedent. McConnell was transparent about it. Garland didn't, however, have to endure character assassination or death threats. He still could join SCOTUS.
That is not good for the USA. It's not good for her citizenry. It makes a mockery of public service. And it must not be endured.		Absent any hard corroboration provided in a timely manner, Judge Kavanaugh must be confirmed. #IStandWithBrett  /22/end
Enduring attacks on their character, reputation, and family safety turns it into no-win territory quickly. And that will certainly discourage others in future from even considering accepting appointment to high office. /21
Rewarding them for their malfeasance is unconscionable - not just for this nominee but for all future nominees. Living in the "land of no time" is difficult enough for nominees; having the end of the process moved further and further out into "someday" land is abusive. /20
Hopefully, those involved will be subject to Senate ethics investigations, and expulsion from the SJC. 		But that the Ds did NOT do their duty on the SJC, and did NOT investigate timely should not be held against the nominee. They corrupted the process. /19
Assuming something happened when Ford was 15, I am truly sorry that she has been so ill-served by the SJC Ds. They did not treat her allegation seriously, nor investigate it timely. They failed to fulfill their duty as SJC members. /18
If the only corroboration Ford can muster fails - no one else remembers that specific party or any similar event with Kavanaugh and Ford, &amp; no one else remembers Kavanaugh ever behaving that way, then what there is is her word that it happened and his word that he never did. /17
He can point to these: no one else has ever accused him of anything like this; no other females (or males) of his acquaintance believe it's consistent for him to behave like that; and that's about it. This is why the burden of proof is - and must remain - on the accuser. /16
Assume for a moment that Judge Kavanaugh is telling the truth - that he never has behaved as accused, not once, not ever, nor did he ever come close. He can't "prove" that. There is no way to prove a negative. All he can use are indicators to show it's unlikely. /15
As a SCOTUS nominee, Judge Kavanaugh is all but isolated from his "normal" work, and peers. He, like all other SCOTUS nominees, is in a strange political landscape bounded only by the time limits of the process. Until it is over, one way or another, he and his family endure /14
Every nominee to high office, particularly SCOTUS, enters a crucible. They have, essentially, no privacy during the time the Senate is undergoing its confirmation process. They, their families and friends are under scrutiny most of us would not choose to tolerate or endure. /13
If she supports the SJC getting its job done, testifies under oath, then her testimony must be given serious consideration. 		For those who are saying, "What's the rush? We have to get it right!" - you're half right. We do need to get it right, and not just for this nominee. /12
Either Dr Ford is ready (after 30+ years) to testify, or she isn't. If she isn't, her allegation cannot be given any weight in considering Kavanaugh for SCOTUS. Without her testifying under penalty of perjury, it has no more weight than a random Facebook post.  /11
Aside: For the people who are issuing threats against Ford, her family, Kavanaugh, his family, or anyone else in this process, STOP. I hope law enforcement finds you, prosecutes you, and cages you for a very long time. /10
But - that isn't what we're seeing. It's a "Well, I might testify, but only when it works for me, and only if A, B, and C conditions are met." Please. Assuming something happened and it was horrific, drawing this process out will not help, will not heal. /9
Again, if there was concern for the well-being of the country, and getting SCOTUS confirmation done or nominee withdrawn, I'd expect to see something like, "I'll testify tomorrow, over the phone, not in public - but I want you to have the information ASAP" /8
I can't tell whether Ford or her lawyers are making the decisions about attempting to negotiate her testimony for the SJC. All I'll say is that those demands do not appear to be made in good faith. /7
Also, were Feinstein putting the good of the country first, she would want to eliminate an unfit candidate ASAP. No wasting time. 		However, if Feinstein didn't necessarily believe the allegations, she'd keep them as a political spoiler and drop it at the best time for the Ds. /6
Had Sen Feinstein been interested in the good of the country (full SCOTUS bench, no tie votes), she would have ensured an investigation got going as soon as she received Ford's letter. If BK did what he's accused of, he should not be confirmed. /5
Assuming Ford is telling what she believes is true, she has not been served well by Sen Feinstein, Rep Eshoo, or her lawyers. @HNIJohnMiller wrote a brilliant thread (https://t.co/UqVNcaONKC) how Ford might well have tried to be genuinely anonymous and gotten used by the Ds. /4
It goes exactly to fitness for the bench. Which is why allegations must be heard in a timely manner and evaluated. When an accuser is not willing to have those allegations heard timely - and not just willing, but *insistent* on timeliness - then that must be weighed in. /3
People who are confirmed go down in history. People who aren't confirmed also go down in history. Confirmation to SCOTUS is a big deal. Accusations of a serious crime (in this case, felony sex assault) against a nominee are also a big deal. /2
Anyone who will argue that a SCOTUS seat is "just a job promotion" when they discuss potential cost to Kavanaugh, and then argue it's "too important to get a lifetime appointment right" when they discuss the USA is being disingenuous. Very few people are considered for SCOTUS. /1
@HeatherEHeying Tawana Brawley was my first in-my-face moment of seeing that some women will, in fact, lie, lie, and lie some more, to achieve a personal objective. Regardless of the cost to those whom she lied about, and even black/white relations in this country.

@Kelly__Decker @NRO @xan_desanctis The problem I have w/ the accusation of "rushing" is that, had Sen Feinstein not sat on the allegations for 7 weeks, we'd have had time for an investigation, and this 11th hr drama would be resolved.

@Trumpsterfireus @gabrielmalor There are 5 "goods" at stake (varying importance &amp; in no order): (1) Having SCOTUS full on Oct 1; (2) Determining whether there is sufficient "there" in Ford's story to stop BK's confirmation; (3) Inflicting no greater dmg to BK &amp; family than req'd; (4) Honoring Ford's requests..
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher I'd be happy with either FBI or State of MD. I think if she shows up, and her story is compelling, she will get the investigation. If she doesn't show up, no. If she shows up &amp; waffles, probably not. At that point, no one "wins."

This only showed up since they completed this last go-round.
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher Btw, I think you're right, that Senators might not be the best investigators in this situation. But Senate has no authority to tell the FBI what to do - only WH/DOJ does, which in this case goes back to POTUS. And I think he's waiting to see whether Ford shows up &amp; speaks.
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher The only thing Ds are sitting on (that I've heard about) is Ford's unredacted letter. Even the FBI doesn't have the unredacted version. Chairman Grassley has made several requests for it - finally released a letter (cc'd to media). So far, to no avail.
@bixon032 @Bob35098589 @Stonewall_77 @SenFeinstein @maziehirono @DNC The FBI didn't say it was too old. Their responsibility is background checks for Exec Branch nominees - not criminal investigations of them, unless the Admin (not Senate) requests it. POTUS would have to request it of FBI. Or Ford could file criminal complaint in MD.
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher The more details investigators have, the more likely it is they can rule things in and rule other things out. Ford is handicapping it all by demanding investigation first *without* her full story. Doesn't work. /3
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher In any investigation, the first thing any law enforcement does is ask the victim what happened. And they go over it to get all the details they can get. And *then* they begin the rest of the investigation. Doesn't work to start w/half a statement by victim. /2
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher How is it that you see the Rs picking &amp; choosing? In hearing, Ds will emphasize what *they* want heard &amp; Rs don't control that. Right now, the Rs have nothing specific to investigate - no "when" &amp; no "where." They don't even have her full story. That's their starting place. /1
@whdjfkwyrbt @celldude @NumbersMuncher @jaketapper More to the point, if there was anything to connect Kavanaugh, he'd be a "person of interest" until they were ready to charge him with a crime. Nothing to stop the Committee from going forward unless/until he was charged.
@whdjfkwyrbt @celldude @NumbersMuncher @jaketapper Not a misdemeanor under MD law (as I read it). 2nd person involved, force used (to stifle scream). So probly felony sex offense, 3rd degree. No statute of limitations.
@andellis @clarepurpura @Gsusluvme @NumbersMuncher Well, it might help if the whole Committee got to hear her *whole* statement. Ds are the only ones with access to her unredacted letter, even though Chairman has requested it several times. That doesn't inspire confidence.

@SenGillibrand Senator, pls tell the truth. The AHJ is State of MD. No statute of limitations on her allegations. She can file any time. Hearings are real, even if Ds already pledged to vote No on confirmation. &amp; Even a SCOTUS justice can be impeached. She's not being silenced at all.
@andymac2272 @FDRLST And one other element, if it hasn't crossed yr Twitter yet - the Ds on the SJC haven't even shared the unredacted allegations with the Rs. So, yes, "farce." (See Grassley's letter to Ds on SJC.)
@davidmc1592 That is correct. Authority having jurisdiction is State of MD. No statute of limitations in MD on felony sex crimes (and her allegation is for that in 3rd degree, appx).
@andymac2272 @FDRLST "Debacle" also fits. Accuser more invested in protecting her skin than protecting USA from a man she sees as unfit. Ds more invested in playing politics than getting investigation started ASAP (7+ wks ago). Calls for "justice" exclude that for Kavanaugh. So, unfunny but "farce."
This is insanity. Justice requires both hearing &amp; healthy skepticism - but the Ds aren't even willing to share the actual allegations in full. AYKM??!!?? This is reason enough to skip the hearing &amp; proceed straight to up/down vote in full Senate! #ConfirmKavanaughNow https://t.co/ccNOC7zOq3
@andymac2272 @FDRLST Ideally, this would not have been handled the way it was. But, it was - and tribalism is on full display with cynicism already. "Who started it" doesn't matter; but ending this farce does. Cynicism &amp; sadness win. /end
@andymac2272 @FDRLST Unfortunately, I think we're already there, unless Ford shows up on Monday. That's what the political right needs to see, that she believes in her cause enough to show up. If that happens, there might be enough will to pursue an investigation. Without that, probably not. /1
@JaewooLVL @MidtownCoffee @pbconley @kaitlancollins Rape happens to both sexes. In any case, the only hope of justice being done (on earth) is to report the crime. That it's a Hail Mary, with little likelihood of success doesn't change that it's still the only path w/even a shred of hope.
@andymac2272 @FDRLST In an ideal world, yes. However, in this one, both the accuser &amp; the Ds have made justice secondary to politics, expecting that the only negative impact would land on Rs and Kavanaugh. Cynical &amp; unjust. Must not be rewarded.
@andymac2272 @FDRLST If Ford really wants justice &amp; a fair investigation, the State of MD has no statute of limitations on alleged felony sex crimes. It also has jurisdiction. She could pursue that even if Kavanaugh is confirmed to SCOTUS.

@JonathanTurley No one has a "right" to be believed. An accuser has a right to be heard. What they don't have is the right to hijack the Senate or SCOTUS, or smear another's reputation. There's no statute of limitations. If she wants a full investigation, she can file a criminal report

@SenBobCorker @ChuckGrassley Thank you for keeping process on track &amp; I hope you will vote promptly if Dr Ford chooses not to appear on Monday.

@WinterwoodGrace Agreed. I'm no lawyer, so take with a grain of salt, but summary of MD sex laws available here: https://t.co/uagGasTEKg
@VictorB123 @PoliticalSock MD has no statute of limitations on the alleged conduct, which is (from what I can tell from the statute summaries) to be (worst case) felony sexual offense - 3rd degree. https://t.co/uagGasTEKg
@WinterwoodGrace From what I understand of the case, she could have him charged with felony sex offense in the 3rd degree, it has no statute of limitations in MD. So - if she really wanted an investigation, that would be the logical place to start. #ChristineBlaseyFord

@RepBillFoster No. The claim is serious - serious enough to merit prompt action, which would have been to start investigating July 31st, not sitting on the claim for appx 7 weeks and THEN ask for delay for investigation. @SenFeinstein failed to put the USA ahead of D politics. Grant no delay.

@lizfones @mahoneysthename @Acosta Report facts, straight. Interview people in a way that elicits something more than sound bites. Be scrupulously honest. Serve the story/audience. Listen to his audience (&amp; prospective audience). Be professional. Represent opinion as just that, not fact.
@JDHornski @anniebeans59 @TweetingFollya @mahoneysthename @Acosta As for "this crowd" being "normal" - the usual norms got tossed out in the general campaign.  I encourage you to consider what @ScottAdamsSays - the movie you are watching is not the same one seen by those who support POTUS. He's got some tweets/video worth seeing. /end
@JDHornski @anniebeans59 @TweetingFollya @mahoneysthename @Acosta Acosta was in an environment actively managed by local PD &amp; US Secret Service. He could hardly be safer. 	In NK, Acosta didn't care what (international) protocol he stomped on, he wanted his way. Not just there/then, either. His behavior at WH is generally unprofessional. /1
@JDHornski @anniebeans59 @TweetingFollya @mahoneysthename @Acosta "Anger" (as beauty) is in the eye of the beholder.  We interpret facial expressions, tone, etc.  What we see (ex: corner of mouth turned up or down) is objective fact. What we make it mean is subjective &amp; interpretation.
@TweetingFollya @mahoneysthename @Acosta ;) You'd think so, right?		It's tacky (at minimum) to interfere with "a guy just doing his job." One might say rude.		And. As often as Acosta has interrupted and talked over others who were also "just doing their jobs" I'm fresh out of sympathy.		Weird, but there it is.
@JDHornski @mahoneysthename @Acosta I can't tell if he thinks he's better off for being actively disliked - or it's a badge of honor. In either case, I think he's underestimating the future cost of some of his choices.  		In that sense, I still feel for him. That's one big check. I don't envy him that pymt. /end
@JDHornski @mahoneysthename @Acosta I can appreciate that. Most people who know me in RL would tell you I can usually be counted upon to be empathetic. 		I commented because I was surprised to find my good will has about hit its limit w/Acosta. And if I've near my limit, he's much worse off than he may know. /1
@JDHornski @mahoneysthename @Acosta Saying "I find it hard to generate much sympathy" &lt;&gt; "justifying a 'screaming angry mob'". Making that distinction requires understanding that #WordsHaveMeaning and #FactsMatter. You might benefit from looking up "natural law of the harvest." Or not.

@Peter_Wehner I'd have a lot more appreciation for them if he'd (a) spoken them while in office, and (b) followed up &amp; demonstrated what he was talking about.  It's easy to say this from the bleachers when he isn't responsible for results on the scoreboard.
Portland is a beautiful city - at least physically.  But there's some rot in the city's character as to what it will justify and tolerate in the public square in the name of "protest."  In that sense, it is ugly.
To be clear, I AM NOT ADVOCATING VIOLENCE OR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.  I don't want anyone hurt, property damaged, or anything along those lines.  I am pointing out that when POTUS45 was elected, Portland was the scene of criminal behavior in the name of "protesting" the results.
This may be a better way to get to the image: https://t.co/ghkYa9CvIR
Contact information for the gallery:  Phone 971-266-4919. Address: 1000 E Burnside St, Portland, OR 97214. Facebook page: https://t.co/HOnErqziSG. And if you'd like to contact the US Secret Service: 202-406-5708.  The image is this: https://t.co/NO68JwJB0i
Conservatives and/or those who support DJT (not always the same people), are flagging it for the US Secret Service to take action, communicating their displeasure on FB and Twitter, and plugging up the gallery's voicemail.  In other words, there's some restraint. (Some)
In my view, the difference between conservatives and progressives is this: had the same type of image been posted featuring POTUS44, the gallery would likely already have been firebombed, protesters surrounded it, and general civic unrest would have followed.
A business named "One Grand Gallery" in Portland, OR has an image of POTUS with a knife at his throat, in imminent danger of his throat being slit. It's on the storefront glass, at a level easily visible to children. On its Facebook page, the owner mocks those who are upset by it

@michaelamoore97 @SouthernKeeks @JeffJentgen Logically, that makes sense. But if I recall correctly, the Constitution is specific about who it defines as a person entitled to the protections under it. And unless I've missed a change in terms, the definitions used would seem to exclude the unborn.

One more thing - I'm using the word "power" as distinct from "force." What people fear (rightly) is the use of force by those in power. Using the IRS, eg, to target political enemies? That's use of force. Asking the AG to work w/in law as written by Congress? Power.
Trump is the one who stayed sober at those galas &amp; celebrations. He listened more closely than it seemed. He's not just some joker w/ bank account. Anybody who thinks his $ won the election seriously underestimates him &amp; the American people.
There's yammering about how Trump doesn't know anything about gov't, or his supposed ignorance on a wide variety of topics. What they don't give him credit for is his understanding of people. Nothing happens w/o ppl. Understand what motivates ppl in key positions= power.
Interesting theory/POV re Trump. I'll add this: people who see Trump merely as "someone w/$$" or "reality TV star" have fallen for the facade. People in power who made that misjudgment are too shallow to hold power for any length of time. https://t.co/li8y1vrtgJ

So the war for @Jim_Jordan's political life will be won or lost in the media.  It's critical that he get the best support possible. If the media throws him off-balance, they win.  		I pray the truth comes out, and that he emerges victorious.
The major media will go after him.  Using people's memories of events 23+ years ago, hearsay, primary witnesses whose testimony could not survive cross-examination at trial, and a law firm associated with outrageous political smears.  The only place that works is social media.
The tactics worked against Roy Moore.  I think he was out of his depth with the national press - and that cost him.  The press claimed that scalp.		I think they're out for Jim Jordan's, too.		Because they believe they can, he's GOP, and he's helping shake up DC.
The tactics being used against Rep Jim Jordan are eerily similar to those used against Judge Roy Moore: 	- use the MSM to get a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations out there, 	- drown the target in negative press, and 	- who cares whether anyone actually gets justice.
It also "just so happens" that Perkins Coie is in the mix - which, after the Steele dossier disaster is not a good indicator for truth, justice, and the American way. Quite the contrary.
What bothers me about this story is that it's old and all but unverifiable. The prime suspect is dead. The records are destroyed (in accordance w/normal retention policies). And it just so happens that this story surfaces only when Jim Jordan is considered for House Speaker.

Note to business owners:  that restaurant manager is an example of someone who is less interested in serving your customers than in patting himself on the back.  My (free) advice: fire his ass and get someone in who *values* your customers.  All of them. /5 + end

Never mind that any restaurant patron was being harassed, or that other patrons who didn't want a protest with their dinner were impacted, the restaurant management "was happy" about it.   /3 https://t.co/yJ8PkO9BDB
From The Daily Caller, ‚ÄúWe are not upset the protesters came here and we are not upset even if it was any of our staffers [who tipped off] the protesters,‚Äù the MXDC Cocina Mexicana manager, who refused to give his name, told TheDCNF. ‚ÄúWe are happy about what happened.‚Äù /2

@ReaganBattalion The question is what was she referencing - my guess would be Stormy Daniels, because FLOTUS *chose* to visit the children - she didn't "have to."

@JennMGreenberg Ok I didn't get that, I missed it. In that case, we are in accord. Thank you for clarifying.
@JennMGreenberg The only sin identified as "unforgivable" in NT is sin against Holy Spirit. Theologians have different views about what that is/looks like.
@JennMGreenberg Vs 12 says what I said, "If a man does not repent ..." But accepting Jesus requires repentance. Else no forgiveness. But it's in the human's hands to choose.
@JennMGreenberg I cannot agree. Jesus died that *all* might have Life, it's up to the individual to "choose back" - or not, &amp; deal with consequences. Love &lt;&gt; support of every thing done, any more than a parent loves a child any less while correcting them, or allowing them to be prodigal.

I don't want you to lose your job @FoxNews on @TheFive.  But you may want to take some time to reflect how you can call out the President for his speech - and fail to call out Peter Fonda for promoting criminal behavior.  It's an ethical fail. /8 end
And if you're not willing to call out "your side" when someone on it advocates criminal behavior, what standing do you have to call out anyone?   /7
He was on the line of criminal solicitation, if not over it.  		Pretending that the facts are otherwise is a disservice to those who listen to you and trust your judgment.  They deserve better.  /6
Fonda advocated the kidnapping, assault, and molestation of a pre-teen.	He advocated the assault and intimidation of multiple women.		No, it was not "just unfortunate phrasing."  /5
Fonda didn't just mouth off, call names, or make a stupid or unfortunate joke. He was advocating for violent criminal behavior - and aiming it at a minor child and women with whom he disagreed politically.  /4
You wanted POTUS to condemn those who were there exercising their 1A rights, complete with city permits.  Not just those who engaged in violence.		But you're giving Peter Fonda an entirely different treatment. /3
Consider your outrage when POTUS failed to condemn everyone who showed up at the 'Unite the Right' Charlottesville, VA rally.  Not everyone who went was KKK or a white supremacist. Some were simply curious. Yet you wanted DJT to condemn all (except Antifa) who attended. /2

@realdanpotts @danieldarkko @ThomasWictor As noted elsewhere in this thread, jealousy. Add "otherism."  Jews have a distinct culture.

@CBHessick @AJDelgado13 Here's another of her tweets re appearance rates. Primary factor impacting appearance rates (per report linked in tweet) is whether claimant had (necessary) legal counsel. Reported rates for families are messy: https://t.co/6WHsPkjv1v

Fwiw, shuttering that program doesn't make sense to me.		I'll hunt down the 30% non-appearance nbr. I'm not sure of the specifics underlying it.
@CBHessick @AJDelgado13 30% don't return, if I have my nbrs right. That's not workable.		Also, I don't know anyone who *wants* to detain ppl, esp if all they want is to escape unlivable conditions.

@kkoth @PattyMurray Further, I did not characterize you in any way. That you ASSUME I don't know anything beyond what you've heard the Administration say is not just ignorant but rude. #MuteWorksToo
@kkoth @PattyMurray If the people voted into Congress cannot or will not treat their professional duty seriously *&amp; hold themselves accountable* for doing it well, fixing it when they goofed, they should be replaced. /2
@kkoth @PattyMurray You misunderstand. I support the separation of powers. That was true *long* before DJT was elected, and I don't "buy" anything just because some gov't official "says so." Congress' primary Constitutional role is that of author of legislation. /1
@steph93065 @Maganificent_NJ Less expensive than "free" public assistance programs for whole families. Problem would be adopted children, no DNA help there.
@NancyPelosi I'll know you're serious when you are willing to fix the law under this mess, and make it something that addresses concerns of both parties.
@RepBPhinneyNH The problem I have with the account of the woman being "forcefully" separated from her child is that it is 3rd hand. And the game of telephone included 2 people where legitimate concerns of bias are not unreasonable. I would bet nothing on the accuracy of that report.
@kkoth @PattyMurray The separations are neither 100% nor arbitrary, but until people deal with that reality there isn't likely to be a meeting of the minds anytime soon. Facts do matter.
@kkoth @PattyMurray You're free to hold that view &amp; you're not alone. Consider, too, that most of what is written abt POTUS is interpretation, or straight-up mind-reading by people w/animus. People who would deny to their deathbed that he has *any* virtue at all. Listen or not, you choose. Shalom.
@kkoth @PattyMurray The Feinstein bill opens a larger can of worms than the current law. Articles out on that. Rs have also proposed legislation (multiple options) - Sen Schumer has said no D will join, as he wants focus on DJT.  That is someone who does NOT place interests of children over party.
@kkoth @PattyMurray Kanefield is correct re legal custody. However, name me a jail or prison that says to a parent, "Sure, your kids can stay here with you while you await trial." Doesn't happen. 		Legal custody is not, never was, the issue. Coyotes claiming children as "theirs" yes, too often.
@kkoth @PattyMurray If you believe *any*one takes joy in separating families, that would be delusional. And that, btw, would be the result of rhetorical hyperbole on the part of Congress members &amp; media. This is an ugly situation w/out that.		The MSM may nearly all be trolls. Congress has no excuse.
@kkoth @PattyMurray The def'n of "unaccompanied alien child" is relevant. Children are not separated from parents who aren't charged with crimes.		Neither you nor I can fully appreciate the trauma. However, the parent made that child vulnerable to gov't action by failing to comply w/law.

@RealCandaceO @yaf ?!? Rather than warning ppl about XYZ or its founder, teach ppl to ask, "Am I a better person for being involved w/ XYZ?" Then trust them to be honest  &amp; decent enough to take right action after resolving that question. Imputing mal-intent is a progressive superpower.
@RealHBoots @JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO No, the translation of that is you're tweeting like a dishonest jerk, and I'm done wasting my time with you.
@RealHBoots @JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO First, you say gaslighting, now twisting words and justifying. (That's imputing mal-intent.) 		The only proper response to you at this point is a full Southern, "Bless your heart."
@RealHBoots @JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO No, I'm simplifying her phrasing to clarify her argument. If you choose not to see that, that's on you.
@RealHBoots @JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO She wrote, "the premise of [the movement] is ...". How in the name of PB&amp;J do you translate that to "those who've been assaulted are ..."???
@RealHBoots @JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO The fact that multiple people are looking at the same tweet &amp; seeing polar opposite (even though they have some common basis) should be a flashing communications red alert. Assigning mal-intent is what progressives do.
@MediaBuzzFNC Hollywood hates POTUS. De Niro gave their hate voice &amp; "made it ok."  		The president's comment was funny, &amp; possibly accurate. It may not have been dignified, but I have no issue w/that counterpunch.
@JamesHasson20 @RealCandaceO That isn't what Candace said. She's criticizing the MeToo movement politics, not the people who have been assaulted.
The initial tweet caught my eye ... But the embedded thread on how different societies have vegetarian/ carnivorous-based diets due to water availability was eye-opening. I hadn't ever done the math, &amp; it isn't that hard. Well worth the read. https://t.co/HjiJFpgQVf

It hasn't been "diplomacy as usual" - but so what?!?  The USA should be way more interested in the results than style points - if we truly value world peace.		Congratulations, Mr. President @POTUS! Excellent first steps! #TrumpKimSummit
If the price tag on that is a little grace extended to NK so that he can (rightly) see this agreement toward denuclearization as a *win-win* deal, I'm all for it.  It's the smartest play I've seen from any POTUS in my lifetime since Reagan. /4
Same goes with US (or NK) flags given higher placement.  Same message, same result: resentment and a lack of engagement.		POTUS is giving NK every reason to *want* to succeed.  This is the best offer they're going to get - ever - and Kim knows it.  /3
What would you have as the alternative?  NK flags alone?  US flags alone?  Either of those would suggest that the other is a "junior" player, and not as important.  "Hey, let's deal, you punk, and I got the thing you need" is not a winning approach anywhere. /2
For the people freaking out about NK and USA flag placement at the #TrumpKimSummit, please get a grip.	Kim Jong Un is a head of state.  So is POTUS.  When 2 heads of state meet, it's considered diplomatic courtesy to have flags placed equally.  /1

@JulieNeimark @BradSherman I'd have no issue if he'd said, "I believe he has obstructed justice" - everyone has their view.  My issue is w/, "there's clear evidence that ..."  Either there is, or not.  "Evidence" relying on interpretation of intent is neither clear nor compelling. Not absurd, just flabby.
@JulieNeimark @BradSherman Staying with the observable facts, either a person DID do X, or they didn't. "Try" is an interpretation. But it's one commonly asserted as "fact" - especially in social media.		Really would prefer public servants (&amp; media) stick with facts. We'd have so much less drama. /3/end
@JulieNeimark @BradSherman However, he's been repeatedly accused of thinking/believing that. Problem is none of us read minds or hearts. We know what ppl *say* and we can see what they *do.* That's about it. Anything else? We pretty much suck at.		But easy to accuse on Twitter of "He's trying to do X" /2
@JulieNeimark @BradSherman I think your recollection of DJT's words is imprecise - and I'm not trusting my own recollection, either. I'd have to see the video again. 		I don't believe that DJT actually thought that firing Comey would end the investigation; it didn't depend on FBI director (obviously). /1
@The_Tyler_Grant @LibertyHangout There are good reasons for mute &amp; block functions on Twitter &amp; I was happy to use them today.
@JulieNeimark @BradSherman I wouldn't call it a judicial system so much as "mob action." Problem is that public figures are libeled daily (or hourly), &amp; people with more time than clarity metastasize misinformation. Elected officials should do better than that. Professionalism would dictate so.
@BradSherman Your idea of "clear evidence" seems to diverge from the legal standard, as no criminal charges have been filed, nor John Doe indictments. I hope you never have the experience of being found guilty of a felony on social media w/o even a trial. #CourtsMatter #FactsMatter

@KyleKashuv I think phrase "social justice" was coined to distinguish between justice in the courts, i.e., "legal justice" &amp; that which was just in society but not (yet?) governed directly by law. However, phrase reflects socialist/communist value system, not capitalism/free market.

@JennMGreenberg I don't believe forgiveness requires reconciliation.

@SarahStricker @edenrebecca32 If we can't agree that people of good conscience stand on all sides of the issues involved, &amp; work together to reduce any chunk of this, we walk away to work only w/those on our side of the divide. Result: less energy, less innovation possible. Choose: be right vs reduce deaths
@SarahStricker @edenrebecca32 It gets lost when anti-gun side addresses all gun-related deaths as a result of gun possession. Then there is one cure: ban guns. In reality, dealing with death from poor gun safety can't be addressed the same as suicide, or as gang violence. Sound-bite solutions don't work.
If I had to pick one and only one from the choices above, I know which one I'd pick - and it wouldn't be the same as @AprilDRyan. But, then again, I don't work for CNN.
Or is it someone who doesn't, say, have pride in America (and, by extension, its culture) until a non-white is nominated for President?  Or is it someone who wants to "fundamentally transform" the culture into which s/he is born?

Thread. Most #Parkland commentary isn't worth reading. This is. A student looking for facts practiced solid journalism &amp; produced a report that damns @browardschools  for their casualness toward school safety. Please RT. @AGPamBondi this merits your attention. https://t.co/5n2QqEvrrO

@THEHermanCain @KyleKashuv The school district *must* address the conduct of its employee. Kyle is still a minor "in the care" of the school, and a teacher libelling &amp; bullying him, saying "something must be done" about Kyle is so far beyond the pale, the mind boggles.

@AleksJames54 @neontaster According to one version of events, they were occupying a table for approx 30 minutes &amp; not buying anything. They were asked to purchase something (anything) to keep their table and declined. Most city-based Starbucks have clear "no loitering" policy.
@chadfelixg He was twisted before &amp; since. Tried to connect with his peers one minute, vowed to be professional shooter the next. I don't believe he is entirely w/o conscience, but unlike most people, his is not consistently in the driver's seat. Personification of specific mental illness.
@joshdcaplan @bonniemurphy No. It's technically accurate. She said "declared" chemical weapons. She never addressed any "undeclared" CWs. It's called lying by telling a very specific truth. Bill Clinton redux.
@MDYankeefan1 @drawandstrike Yah. It depends on the Starbucks - and time of day. Pictures/vids seem like it was crowded enough that table space was at a premium. And 30 minutes is a *long* time for no purchase in a coffee shop. It would have taken *1* lousy cuppa coffee to not have this go like that.
@drawandstrike 2 black guys wait in a Starbucks, occupying table for appx 30 mins waiting for white friend to join. Mgr says "gotta buy something if you want to stay." Men declined. Asked to leave. Declined. Cops called, men taken out charged w/trespass. Friend arrives as arrest occurs.
@SarahStricker @KyleKashuv Sarah, weapons have no agency, no "will" to kill.  That originates with people. It's not word-play, it matters to recognize that weapons cannot arm themselves, &amp; discharge themselves.  It's all about the human being behind it. Think Timothy McVeigh and fertilizer.
@KyleKashuv This is a fun tweet. Also interesting that, according to science, guns are not listed as a cause of death. Homicide, yes. Suicide, yes. Accident, yes. But guns are considered by science as a "means," not a "cause." So, what you said.
@JeffKasky @KyleKashuv @cameron_kasky @Sarahchadwickk @MattxRed @NRA Mr. Kasky, your definition of "market" and "sell" are distinctly different from everything I learned about business marketing both in school and since.

@Elaines2cents "We grow the best of the best Dims in CA" ... You do!  You really, really do!  LOL
@jrsalzman I think you missed a couple of key words in the video, "*known* chemical weapons" were removed.  Susan Rice also said they'd removed 100% of Syria's "declared" CWs.  Weasel-wording, a la Bill Clinton.  Lying by being strictly accurate &amp; leading to opposite impression.

@camille_buccero @kathy_bonds @washingtonpost It's one thing to be good-humored in poking fun, but the press has been full on *nasty* w/this president, ever since he won the election.

@dcexaminer Isn't it great that private citizens can hold any opinion they choose?
@JesseKellyDC Only the "declared" chemical weapons. Susan Rice was very specific in her statement. A la Bill Clinton. When a gov't official is ultra-specific in their statements, it's usually because there's a desire to give a certain impression that's not supported by the facts.
@greta Kimmel only apologizes to mbrs of gay community offended by his comments - no one else. FLOTUS is a private person in a public job - any person who actually cared abt immigrants as people wouldn't troll her for her accent, not even as throwaway "joke." Kimmel fails Apology 101.
@KassyDillon Kimmel didn't apologize to FLOTUS. His statement is a cheeseburger minus the cheese - and the burger. Hannity doesn't need an apology, but FLOTUS is a very private person dealing with a very public role. She doesn't need a talk show host trolling her - and an apology would help.

@KyleKashuv Notice the weasel-wording, "*declared* chemical weapons" ... I.e., "we don't know anything about any *undeclared* chemical weapons, and we're just going to pretend for diplomacy's sake that there aren't any". So, technically, she's right. Just obfuscating.

This is the time for us to put up or shut up.  If you - or your friends - have any ideas that might make a difference, send 'em in.  This is our turn. We don't need a march, fund-raising, or a microphone w/a camera - just access to email.  #SaveStudentsLives. /end
The commission led by Betsy DeVos (partnering HHS, DOJ &amp; others) may lead to real solutions. What we can do is send constructive ideas on how to increase #SchoolSafety to: safety@ed.gov. /9
The failures of government at #Parkland were stark. The students have a lot of energy and want it to never happen again - &amp; that's commendable. The app created by @KyleKashuv and the passage of a couple of measures in Congress are the real victories, thus far.  /8
But what's obvious is that there is work to be done inside each school as a distinct community to disallow any kid from isolating him/herself. #CreateConnection  A kid unconnected w/people is a greater risk to him/herself. That's just common sense. /7
If it's something as simple as taking down the "gun free zone" signs painting a target on the school, &amp; allowing those weapons-trained staff who are prepared to carry concealed - and the concerns get worked out satisfactorily - then that's ok to that, too. #NoMoreGunFreeZones /6
If it's something as simple as changing lunchroom policy and requiring students to fill front-to-back and left-to-right (like military mess hall), so they have to figure out how to #connect w/other students they normally don't spend time with, ok. /5
That translates to, "find out what will make the biggest difference for the least disruption - and start there."  It's Business 101 (aka "common sense").  If it's requiring clear backpacks, ok. If it's school uniforms and #DressCodes, ok. /4
The "let's do something - anything!" touted in some circles is rank stupidity. If "anything" works, then let's all dance the hokey-pokey - because that certainly qualifies. #Stupid But if we're to make a *real* difference, then it makes sense to #Leverage our efforts. /3

18) If we, as citizens, don't take a hard look at the various gov't failures in this incident, and see what might be done to prevent future such failures, some might argue that we, too, will have allowed the next such tragedy. I'm not okay with that.
17) Unlike some mass shootings, Parkland provides a case study in how government can contribute to such incidents by sins of commission as well as sins of omission.
16) Did the mom have other community resources for guidance?  It seems clear, in retrospect, that she needed them. (Same seems to apply to Sandy Hook mom.) What did she need that she didn't have? Looking at it now, who can provide it?
15) Was the shooter's mom, juggling the responsibilities of a single parent of two boys, protecting her son from the future consequences of an involuntary admission for psych evaluation and possible treatment - rather than dealing with what the recommendation represented?
14) But then we get to the interesting - as in harder, more complex, and slipperier - pieces.  Do the shooter's classmates have any responsibility (as citizens of a community) allowing - or possibly promoting - the shooter's social isolation?
13) Thus, the tally so far is: shooter caused it; sheriff could be said to have promoted it and allowed it to happen. FBI also allowed it.
12) The sheriff owns a chunk of "allowing" this also. Whether it's 20+ prior trouble calls, or 40+ is irrelevant. If anyone is responsible for the safety and security of citizens and doesn't get there's a problem by the 6th such call, they need to be replaced.  Duh.
11) As for "allowing" this to happen, we can look at the FBI. Two prior notifications, no follow up - as any reasonable person would expect from a premier LE agency. Yes, call center, blah blah, but who's responsible for ensuring the call center performs as directed? Hint: FBI.
10) If a LEO enforces the law only when it serves monetary goals, the community is not a place where the "rule of law" applies. Except sometimes. For some people, and not others. Depending on the time of month or quarter. Or some other arbitrary criterion.
9) But he's not alone in having responsibility for the massacre.		It's easy to argue that the Broward County Sheriff promoted the general disrespect for law and order at the school by having a money-driven approach to law enforcement at the school.
8) So, using that as the lens or model, what do we see in the case of the #ParklandShooting ?  The person who caused it - no question - was the shooter. He brought the weapon to the school, and used it to kill and injure students and staff.
7) "I was in the car, I could see that she wasn't going to clear the intersection in time, but I didn't say anything to stop her. I just let it happen." (allowing).  (Another example might be voting "Present" in the Senate.)
6) Between causing it, and having zero control over a thing, are two other distinct levels of influence: promoting a thing to happen, and allowing a thing to happen. Ex: "I was a passenger in the car, and I told her to floor it, to try to go for it." (promoting) and ...
5) There's also the level of we are directly doing it, causing it to happen. Ex: "Yes, officer, I ran that red light. I was driving the car, and I chose to accelerate into the intersection even though I knew I might not make it before the light turned red."
4) There's the level of "stuff happens" - where it occurs as if we have no control. The sky is spitting out snowflakes, and we have no control, power, or influence over it. It'll happen regardless of what we do or say.
3) "Responsibility" can be defined as having the ability to take care of something within one's power or control. And in any situation, it can be argued that there are four levels of "control."
2) The emotional response is valid. The desire to stop any/all similar future incidents understandable - and rational. But what's needed is an examination of #WhatHappened - in reality - not in a fantasized recollection of events, and a sober evaluation of where things "broke."
1) Thread regarding responsibility in #ParklandSchoolShooting . After an event like the mass shooting in a Parkland high school, there's an intense response - a desire to make sure that it never, ever happens again.
@kachmar_susan @dangainor @pnjaban Exactly! Imo, that's why the situation in Charlottesville blew up. Had the "counter-protesters" not shown, there would have been a legal "demonstration" that could have been ignored by national media, etc, and no big thing. Ugly, but no big. Instead, it escalated.

@WeMeantWell This didn't start with DJT, even though it's gotten exponentially worse since he began his run for POTUS. I'd estimate it started during Clinton era, ratcheted up under Obama. This isn't likely to change until news outlets give up advocacy for straight news. No time soon.

@bansisharma A threat isn't real unless you're willing to follow through - and I suspect DJT is willing. But I would rather endure even a short round of trade wars than continue to be a doormat for other countries' benefit.

Those persons should not be denied the ability to defend themselves.		Others are not yet fully mature, or there's something "off" with their thinking.  Age is an easy thing to determine. Maturity or sanity, not so much.
Anyone defending their own life or their own home should not be barred from doing so - even if they're under 21. We've granted 18 yo's the choice to marry, parent, enlist, enter contracts, etc.  Some have, at that age, already served with distinction.

@GIJane4Trump @President1Trump @FBI He was sworn in Sept 28, 2017 - hasn't been on the job 6 months.  I think it's premature to fire him, even though I understand the impulse. But 6 months isn't even enough time to find all the trouble spots are inside the FBI. Especially not w/ all current Congressional hearings.

@Tex2WestSeattle @RobProvince @EWErickson An accidental firearms discharge in the vicinity of a school is ...how can I say this...unsafe handling of a firearm, but the school isn't the target. Same reasoning on suicides. Neither is acceptable &amp; the school is happenstance. /1
@Tex2WestSeattle @RobProvince @EWErickson I would only count the incidents where there was obvious mal-intent on the part of the shooter, during school hours with children or staff as intended targets. I wouldn't count suicides, accidental discharges, etc.

@benshapiro @DeplorableJon The kids was a social outcast. Article in thread shows him as ultimate outcast in that school, by both dress &amp; behavior. He had no connections with his peers. Then he gets kicked out (transferred to alternate school). Can anyone see how this could go wrong?
@Daver2956 @thedailybeast @PoliticalShort I don't see the policy changes identified in the article as relevant to what occurred today. The only change was for non-violent misdemeanors to be handled by the school. This kid was a social outcast, unconnected to his peers. And all the students knew it.

@Imperator_Rex3 Have been reading that Carter Page was working for the FBI to assist in laying trap for Russian SVK (3 people) for years. He barely gets done w/that gig, &amp; then the FBI suddenly, w/o notice to him, describes him as an agent of a foreign power. If so, then FISA 100% manufactured
@Imperator_Rex3 They're supposed to be. But the FBI didn't even follow its own procedures in preparing that FISA request. If they had done what they normally did to verify/validate every statement, it would never have been submitted. So - did the judge just think the FBI was having an "off" day?
@Imperator_Rex3 Maybe not? A full 25% of FISA warrant apps are said to go through "significant" revision before their final submission. And some are finally withheld (not filed).
@Imperator_Rex3 Have read elsewhere that 44's administration authorized more secret warrants than all previous presidents combined. Don't have source link. And wasn't surprised when I read it.  Obama acted as though he was indisputably right &amp; was therefore entitled to do any damn thing he chose

@cabbieBot @bansisharma There's that, and there's "I'll push every law right up to the breaking point" &amp; "I'm pushing so hard, I can't even see that I stepped WAY over the line, even in hindsight."

3/4 If the FBI did not verify the Steele dossier as it would normally have done before attaching it as substantiation for a FISA warrant, who knew? Who had to approve that? Because at least 3 layers of counter-intelligence in FBI **had to have known** it was bogus.
