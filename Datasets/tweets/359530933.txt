@cspanwj It's clear the President and McConnell need to be removed.
@purduewilly @cspanwj National defense. Do they? President doesn't think servicemen should see their Representatives apparently. He's a communist. Like I said.
@purduewilly @cspanwj Why? Republicans used to be conservative. The president already submitted his budget. Now he wants 5 bill more by holding federal workers hostage. Fuck him and anyone who looks like him. This is America. Put it to a vote. He's a communist.
@purduewilly @cspanwj It's the president and the Senate majority leader who are withholding funds. In fact it was passed last month but vetoed by you know who. As for Russia. He asked for their help. It's documented.
@purduewilly @cspanwj He's working for Putin. Doing everything he wants.  He shut his own government down. Believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies. All associates colluded with Russia. What else?
@purduewilly @cspanwj Nah the traitor is Trump. You knew that.
