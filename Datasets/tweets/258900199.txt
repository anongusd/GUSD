@openletterbot I voted against this rule and am a cosponsor of @RepRoKhanna's bill to end US involvement in the war in Yemen.
@openletterbot @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand I am fighting for an Oversight Cmte hearing &amp; investigation to hold Trump and his Admin accountable so that all these children are reunited with their families.

@clevenger_lucy Happy to say this bill passed yesterday. Hoping the Senate will pass and the President will sign it.
@openletterbot @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand The war in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis. I have called for the US to stop sending arms to the perpetrators of this violence. I agree we need to know what happened to Jamal Khashoggi and bring those responsible for his gruesome murder to justice.
@kilrwat @SenGillibrand @SenSchumer I agree that Whitaker must recuse himself from the Mueller investigation and I am also continuing to fight for legislation that will protect the Special Counsel from undue or political influence.
@JeffYNYC @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand No veteran who sacrificed so much for us, for this country, should be facing homelessness. I will continue to go all I can in Congress to support Vets and their transition to civilian life.
@SwindellNYC I agree. We need an economy that works #ForThePeople. Not just the fortunate few. We need to raise the minimum wage, invest in infrastructure which will bring good paying jobs, and ensure a social safety net that will help people get back on their feet.

Yes, good job Jeff.  Unlike our president, @USAGSessions is actually doing his job by not blatantly trying to obstruct justice &amp; violate the integrity of our judicial system. This Admin's standards are so low that that's actually praiseworthy https://t.co/5OckivR0AB
Releasing 42k pgs of docs HOURS before a confirmation hearing reeks of foul play. Adding Kavanaugh's thinly veiled stance against women's rights &amp; healthcare, plus his years working in partisan politics, &amp; we have a recipe for disaster that we cant allow to happen #StopKavanaugh
Happy #LaborDay! I hope you enjoy the last unofficial day of summer &amp; take a moment to remember why we celebrate today. Labor has done so much for this country ‚Äì workplace safety rules, 40 hr work week, min. wage - that is why I stand w/ the women and men of Labor &amp; always will.
Thanks to Dianna Campell (@RareAdvocates) for meeting w me yesterday. I know that together we can make treatment better for patients of rare diseases. Your story of surviving Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) is inspiring &amp; I'm humbled by your willingness to share it to get others help. https://t.co/wIn9fx5HDx
@Pushing911S I believe you are referring to the disgusting &amp; offense comments made by Carla Maloney, a local GOP official in Pennsylvania, not me. I wholeheartedly condemn her racist remarks &amp; fully support NFL players' right to protest.
It is shameful that so many children have still not be reunited with their families. The House @GOP needs to stop blocking action on the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act and start holding this Administration accountable for this inhumane situation it created. https://t.co/OiWX8t5mms

Getting ready to ring the @NYSE closing bell w/ fearless women leaders in honor of #WomensEqualityDay! Watch it live here: https://t.co/cPES3pZMiz https://t.co/Dkkn8D5R44
Today I joined with some of New York's most fearless women to speak out against #genderpricing and the #pinktax. The findings from my new report "Earn Less, Pay More" make it more obvious than ever that we need #ERANow: https://t.co/yjjUAxNArG https://t.co/tiOsnBlNSp
Joining fearless women leaders to release my new report on the #PinkTax https://t.co/l837sEyuvK
It‚Äôs really very simple:	To make the #PinkTax go away	We need to pass the #ERA	https://t.co/tRm0kcfe4l
The Trump Administration has made orphans out of hundreds of children w/ living, loving parents.  If we want to have any self-respect as a nation, we must not relent until these families are whole again. #ReuniteEveryChild https://t.co/FhswZjsuAc
At 2:30pm today I‚Äôll be joining with women leaders to release a new report on the #PinkTax! I‚Äôll be livestreaming the event via #Periscope, so tune in to hear our findings!
55 yrs ago MLK Jr. delivered a poignant &amp; visionary message of racial equality to the United States, starting w/ the simple words "I have a dream." In his honor, &amp; out of commitment to a better, more just America, we must keep moving forward towards Dr. King's dream.
Tomorrow at 4pm I‚Äôll be joining women leaders to ring the @NYSE closing bell in honor of #WomensEqualityDay, which commemorates the anniversary of women gaining the right to vote.
Well said, @RepCummings. https://t.co/CP86KDkDyI

Women pay more $$ for many goods &amp; services than men, yet get paid less. In order to stop these inequalities, we need to make women &amp; men equal in the eyes of the law. We need the #ERANow https://t.co/eQ7nAjLl6i
Had a great afternoon on the #LES chatting with neighbors during our #CongressOnYourCorner event. Keep an eye out for more dates in the near future https://t.co/eLbLv0UBCf
The @CFPB was created to PROTECT consumers, to HELP Americans. It is devastating to see this agency's principles and practices crumble into dust b/c of an Administration that will choose corporations over its own people 10 times out of 10. America deserves #ABetterDeal https://t.co/gkcgH7hCEr
Once again, we come face to face with #GUNviolence. Once again, thoughts &amp; prayers ring insultingly hollow. We need, need, need to take real, meaningful action to protect American citizens. #GunControlNow. https://t.co/JHL00Yn2Q1

Brett Kavanaugh is an unacceptable #SCOTUS nominee. Today I joined thousands of my fellow NYers in Foley Square for the @NARAL @MoveOn #UniteForJustice rally to make our opposition loud &amp; clear. The Senate must #StopKavanaugh. Too much is at stake. https://t.co/nGK9yRA1P5
This #WomensEqualityDay marks the 98th anniversary of the #19thAmendment. Let's celebrate the progress we've made and focus on the work still to be done. We still face unequal pay for equal work, workplace discrimination, &amp; sexual harassment &amp; assault. It's time for #ERANow. https://t.co/UepFfQpLu5

4 of the men put their trust in our legal system and tried to cross at the boarder &amp; seek asylum. 1 was afraid of violence at the boarder and tried to cross elsewhere. Didn't make a difference. All were detained.
ICE is promising to find out where these men's families are and give them updates. I'm horrified that they don't already have that information.
One man broke down when telling me about how his young daughter was ripped from his arms. This is inhumane and traumatizing.
All 5 of these men brought their families to the US to escape #gangviolence in their home countries. They came hoping for a better, safer life for their loved ones. Instead they were separated from their children &amp; have received no update on their children since being detained.

I‚Äôm strongly opposed to the #DoddFrankRollBack. 8M lost their jobs, 6M lost their homes, &amp; $15T+ in wealth was destroyed in the financial crisis. Our country can‚Äôt afford to go back to the days that led to that crisis. We need to put #ConsumersFirst https://t.co/FCzY6109PA

The #CARDAct saves consumers $12 BILLION/year. It‚Äôs an example of the impact that #consumersfirst laws can have on ppl‚Äôs lives &amp; I‚Äôm incredibly proud of it. We should be passing more bills that #protectconsumers, not rolling back #DoddFrank like the @GOP is trying to do today.
Credit card companies used to be able to raise interest rates if you made a late payment on a different card. That was a backdoor way to take more $ from people‚Äôs wallets. 9 years ago, we banned that in the #CARDAct. I'm proud to have authored this bill that puts #consumersfirst.
Did you know that credit card companies used to be able to hit you w a finance charge based not only on your current balance, but on last month‚Äôs balance too? That was one of the ways people used to get ripped off but we banned that in my #CARDAct 9 yrs ago &amp; put #consumersfirst

If we expect to change harassment culture, we need to practice what we preach. The CAA Reform Act would hold members of Congress accountable for sexual harassment. The House has already passed this bill. Now it's time for my colleagues in the Senate to do the same. #MeToo
NYC Council has stepped up &amp; delivered w/ their sexual harassment prevention package. Congress must do the same. We need to pass my Ending Secrecy About Workplace Sexual Harassment Act so that businesses have cause to end sexual harassment culture, not just sweep it under the rug
New York City now mandates that businesses w/ more than 14 employees undergo sexual harassment prevention training. Great job @TishJames for getting this into law!
Thank you @KeithPowersNYC for fighting to ensure that all employees are protected from sexual harassment, regardless of the size of their employer company.
Shoutout to @NYCSpeakerCoJo for your leadership. Passing your legislation to have all city agencies conduct semi-annual sexual harassment training for all employees was a win for our city.
Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination, and now thanks to @CarlinaRivera it is legally recognized as such under the NYC Human Rights Law. This is both fundamental and critical in order to make our city a safer &amp; better place.
