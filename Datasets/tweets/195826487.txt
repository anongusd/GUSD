RT @FareedZakaria: On GPS this Sunday @ 10am/1pm ET on CNN: @RichardHaass breaks down why the Trump/Kim summit failed https://t.co/YVYgo4sr…
calculation here makes no sense. To save $14M of $700B DoD budget ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ reducing US readiness, weakening US ties w Seoul &amp; Tokyo, which could encourage NK risk-taking, lead SK to drop sanctions vs NK or Japan to rethink its US dependence https://t.co/eKXcZ2ZgWL
Further evidence why Hanoi never should have happened. Personal chemistry, persuasion over-rated by ⁦@realDonaldTrump.⁩ Summits are to wrap up negotiations, not substitute for them, and their failure creates much more stress than a postponed meeting. https://t.co/OlCWcnDc2v
@JacksonDiehl Yes, the Helsinki accords included a human rights basket, but our commitment to stability in Europe did not depend on it-any more than our willingness to enter in SALT/START depended on internal reform. Similarly, domestic evolution was a bonus of containment, not a prerequisite.
disagree w my friend ⁦@JacksonDiehl⁩ here. during the Cold War US managed to curb the arms race and avoid a war w a rival USSR that harshly repressed its people. if US pursues an all-or-nothing foreign policy w NK or anyone it will end up w nothing https://t.co/NSpKZYwrZx
a 5th Hanoi takeaway:  If US insists on denuclearization, it will not reach agreement with NK, which sees nukes as essential for its security. US can, tho, reach a deal if it is willing to accept lesser outcomes. Either way, NK keeps nuclear weapons/ICBMs  https://t.co/gk7x2aO4Hq
Kim may have saved Trump from himself by overplaying his hand and asking for full sanctions relief up front. US should link any sanctions relief with receipt of full accounting of relevant NK sites, schedule for denuclearization, specific steps toward that end, and verification.
No deal better than a bad deal, and Potus right to walk. But this should not have happened. Busted summit is risk you run when too much faith placed in personal relations w leader like Kim, when summit inadequately prepared, and when president signaled he was confident of success
It is not wrong for a US president meeting with a tyrant in the cause of peace; what is wrong is to present Kim in glowing terms. It is jarring too to hear @realDonaldTrump use the phrase “special relationship” in Hanoi when until now it was reserved for the UK, our closest ally.
.@realDonaldTrump did not choose date of Hanoi summit to deflect attention from Michael Cohen, but danger is he will give away too much at summit for that purpose. Congress should have postponed Cohen testimony, and Potus should not be tweeting about Cohen from Hanoi.
@realDonaldTrump Only two problems with this optimism: 1) Kim has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons/missiles, which he sees as his country’s ultimate security guarantee; and 2) Kim has no desire to open up economically lest he lose control. He wants sanctions relief, something v different
Goal of NK denuclearization w/o accounting, timetable, &amp; verification meaningless; “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” code for ending US commitment to SK. Best to avoid all this and opt for limited steps by NK, limited sanctions relief, clear US/SK red lines
Years ago Pat Moynihan wrote of America defining deviancy down. Now it seems ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ is defining diplomacy down. No overt testing does not preclude NK carrying out covert tests and simulations and adding bombs, missiles to its arsenal.  https://t.co/4118I4id5A

@brazosrealist should not be military intervention to oust regime. other tools better. R2P would, tho, further delegitimize regime. there is a legit question about how best to get aid to those in need. and may be need for outside force to help restore order, rebuild Venezuela once regime gone

@realDonaldTrump Seriously doubt NK will become an eco powerhouse under its current leadership as little chance Kim will allow a market economy to emerge as would threaten his hold on power. More likely he will institute extremely limited reforms, benefit from sanctions relief, and keep his nukes
5 Rep sens (Gardner, Rubio, Cotton, Cornyn, Cruz) urging @SpeakerPelosi to invite Taiwan Pres Tsai to address Congress risk costly crisis for US, Taiwan as China Pres Xi, under pol pressure from slowing economy, could lash out vs Taiwan. Wiser to focus on US-Taipei eco, def ties.
Good #GreenNewDeal proponents calling for ambitious, comprehensive US energy/climate policy, but they are making it more difficult than it already is to forge needed climate consensus with unrealistic goals, calls on govt to create millions of jobs, introducing extraneous issues

.@realDonaldTrump claimed in SOTU that if he'd not been elected the US would be in a major war with North Korea. actually, that would be so only if US attacked NK if it refused to commit to total, verifiable denuclearization, something the Trump administration has not required.
Hard not to be struck by SOTU’s mixed signals on diplomacy: @realDonaldTrump justified “trying for peace” in Afghanistan and pursuing NK negotiations—but also withdrawal from INF Treaty and Iran nuclear deal.  And speaking of withdrawals, no mention of Paris climate pact or TPP.
Two most memorable foreign policy lines of SOTU—we’d be at war with No Korea if it were not for @realDonaldTrump and (referring to Iraq, Afghanistan) “great nations do not fight endless wars”—both tap into intervention fatigue/isolationism that Trump inherited and has reinforced.
@simon_schama Well deserved and then some
.@FaceTheNation reassuring on US troop presence in RoK, but not on Iran. @realDonaldTrump confuses his view that JCPOA a bad pact w intell judgment that Iran complying with it and justifies US presence in Iraq as aimed at Iran, both of which suggest US-Iran war real possibility.
There is a big difference betw ending the war in Afghanistan and ending the US military presence. This editorial conflates the two.  An orderly drawdown to a lower level and more modest role is one thing, a withdrawal (no matter how orderly) quite another. https://t.co/BWWXwpeqxk

@AAKing27 wrong.  there already has been a coup, one led by Maduro in replacing the National assembly with a new body and then winning a sham election. and if the government were to be ousted, the US and others should make aid contingent on restoring democracy.
2. Important Trump admin keep neighbors in lead and not turn Venezuela crisis into US-Maduro confrontation much less war. Should remove US diplomats if they are unsafe as rescuing them would be difficult and then some. Best to emphasize public and private diplomacy and eco tools.
1. Trump administration right to see Maduro govt in Venezuela as illegitimate and support opposition. should explore cutting off oil imports and refined product exports.  Should also make clear aid that would flow there post-govt change to incentivize military to turn on Maduro.
Speaking at @Davos, @SecPompeo called China's "state-centered economic model" a threat, alongside NK's nucs, Iran, and "radical Islamic terrorism." If this is US policy, decent US-China relations all but ruled out as China cannot be communist w/o large state role in its economy.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Sorry @LindseyGrahamSC, but a summit is not necessarily great news. Neither Singapore nor Helsinki advanced US national security. It all depends on how well a summit is prepared and handled and what @realDonaldTrump offers and demands in return.  Recent history hardly reassuring.
@NoahCRothman @realDonaldTrump To be sure, a detailed roadmap for denuclearization only has meaning if it is based on an accurate baseline of NK capabilities and then the ability to verify NK has taken promised steps toward that end and has not taken others that offset such steps.
If 2nd @realDonaldTrump-Kim Jong-un summit (unlike Singapore) is to add to stability, NK must agree to a detailed roadmap for its denuclearization and US to what it would do in the way of sanctions relief (but not troop withdrawals) in exchange for NK steps toward that end.

Years ago I wrote “The Reluctant Sheriff,” a book about Pres Bill Clinton’s hesitance to use military force. I later amended it to say it applied more to Barack Obama. It turns out the description applies best to @realDonaldTrump, who is dismantling America’s global footprint.
@realDonaldTrump One man’s resignation is another man’s retirement.  James Mattis was right to say that @realDonaldTrump has a right to a SecDef that shares his views-but Potus also has a need for a SecDef and a national security team that is both experienced and willing to speak truth to power.

A reputation for reliability is essential to deter foes, to convince friends not to appease strong neighbors or proliferate, and to persuade others to compromise in a negotiation. By abandoning Syrian Kurds @realDonaldTrump is further undermining the US reputation for reliability
@JackIsJohnHealy @realDonaldTrump I was. And it was amazing. But alas reality beckons
The biggest casualty of @realDonaldTrump presidency may well be this country’s reputation for reliability. The abandonment of the Kurds adds to a pattern of turning on allies, cozying up to foes, and breaking agreements. US influence along with order in the world will plummet.

it is a mystery to me why a 2nd referendum (now that we know what Brexit would entail) would be a betrayal of democracy (as PM May claims) when the initial referendum, taken without knowing what Brexit would entail and against a backdrop of misleading predictions, was legitimate.
@jwgop @Giants @dallascowboys NFC East living up to its reputation as NFC Least.  Worst division in @NFL this year and too many others.
Only 1 question re today’s 🏈 game:  were @Giants worse than the weather or vice versa?
Watching @Giants game, and @NFL challenge rule makes zero sense. There is no limit on the # of mistakes refs can make in a game; there should be no limit on challenges so long as a team pays price in lost timeouts or yards/downs for challenges that are rejected after review.
@realDonaldTrump Strategic patience toward NK was initially rejected by @realDonaldTrump only to be embraced post-Singapore. Makes no sense as NK will use time to increase/improve its nuclear/missile capabilities. There should be a sense of urgency to stop NK’s progress and then reduce the threat

@gideonrachman Believe “Disarray” is the word you are looking for

@realDonaldTrump 1) There was no European military in WW1 or 2 as in both wars Europeans fought Europeans. 2) much of what US spends on defense has nothing to do w Europe. 3) Yes, Germany should spend more on defense, but US spending on NATO a reflection of US self-interest, not aid to Europeans.
In an instant Europe has gone from being the most stable region in the world to anything but. Paris is burning, the Merkel era is ending, Italy is playing a dangerous game of chicken with the EU, Russia is carving up Ukraine, and the UK is consumed by Brexit. History is resuming.

@axios Time can heal. I was with Bob Dole when he lost to George HW Bush in New Hampshire, an outcome that effectively ended Dole's run for the White House and saved that of Bush. Dole was angry and bitter. This tribute 30 years later is the sort of thing that keeps me optimistic.
The @realDonaldTrump foreign policy is nothing if not inconsistent. We threaten China with new tariffs in 90 days and tell Putin he has 60 days to comply w the INF Treaty or we are out. Yet we allow N Korea to keep its nuclear weapons and allow MBS to literally get away w murder.
There is a pattern to the foreign policy of @realDonaldTrump. We have seen it w N Korea, NAFTA, and now China. He creates a sense of crisis, compromises, and both claims he accomplished more than he did and deserves credit for having defused the crisis that he largely created.
@realDonaldTrump Hilarious because unintended historical reference to Mao aside, @realDonaldTrump (as in case w N Korea denuclearization post Singapore) overselling what was accomplished w China at G-20.  Technology and non-tariff issues do not lend themselves to quick or easy resolution.
Yes, 41 was our greatest foreign policy Potus since Truman, and James Baker our most successful SecState since Kissinger, but the other reason 41’s admin did so well in the world was Brent Scowcroft, our best ever national security advisor who made the system work as designed
Lots of people are pointing out that George HW Bush was our best one term president. True but not nearly enough.  He was one of our best presidents, accomplishing more in four years than many others did in eight.

The G-20 in BA was the “avoidance summit”: US, China avoided escalating their trade war; MBS avoided being shunned despite his role in Khashoggi’s murder; Putin avoided any penalty for his latest Ukraine agression. And world leaders avoided doing much of anything for the world.
@barbaraslavin1 That was then; alas, now not so much.
My take on a president who left the country and the world better off than he found them.  We owe him our thanks.  May his well-deserved rest be peaceful.   https://t.co/QzBB4xd6Ks
It was not inevitable that the Cold War would end peacefully with a unified Germany in NATO, or Kuwait would be liberated but the coalition would resist going on to Baghdad. People make history, and George HW Bush made history. Better than that, it turned out better as a result.
.⁦@nytimes⁩ obit perpetuates myth that PM Thatcher steeled 41 to stand up to Saddam. He was all in from the outset. Her “Don’t go wobbly” comment came later as Bush admin worked to get UN backing to enforce sanctions, keeping int’l coalition intact https://t.co/3adTrwbShm
Truly saddened by the news of 41.  He was a good and decent man of character, a demanding but fair boss, and an underrated president who ended the Cold War peacefully on terms few thought possible and who forged an unprecedented international coalition to turn back aggression
more valuable than @realDonaldTrump meeting Putin at G-20 would be Potus meeting w Europeans to coordinate response to Russian aggression vs Ukraine. such a response should include intell/arms to ukraine, sanctions, NATO enhancements, and greater energy independence from russia

.@realDonaldTrump doesnt accept CIA’s judgment re the Khashoggi murder, ignores his own administration’s report on climate change, and rejects evidence of Russian interference in 2016 election. This anti-intelligence, anti-science bias when it doesnt suit him is truly dangerous.
@realDonaldTrump Timing may not be everything, but it can be a lot. While this statement by Potus would be unwelcome any day, it is especially unfortunate today given new Russian military action against Ukraine as it signals Putin he has little to worry about from a divided distracted West.
In wake of latest Russia military action vs Ukraine, US/Europe should 1) convene UN Security Council; 2) increase/accelerate strengthening of NATO; 3) explore introducing new sanctions vs Russia; 4) explore additional ways of assisting Ukraine w intelligence, military transfers.

@realDonaldTrump For some reason, concern over climate change/global warming has become an elite and mostly Democratic issue. those who resent elites and/or are Repubs feel compelled to deny it. This is tragic given its impact on us all and the urgent need to adopt policies to fight/adapt to it.
.@realDonaldTrump right that world is a dangerous place. What he fails to see is that many of his policies-turning blind eye to murders by MBS and Putin, leaving INF treaty, JCPOA, &amp; TPP, not challenging NK over not denuclearizing, denying climate change-are making things worse.
what is so off about the Trump statement about Saudi Arabia (beyond the pinched realism, incomplete take on Yemen, discounting of intelligence, etc) is the judgment that Saudi Arabia has been and is such a good US ally when the record suggests otherwise.  https://t.co/ocOxO6fT18

Turkey reportedly imprisons more of its journalists than any country in the world. It is rich as in Kafka-esque that we are depending on its president to provide the accurate accounting of the Saudi government’s murder of a journalist
Priorities for US policy RE Saudi should be 1) to limit use of US-supplied intel and arms in Yemen w aim of winding down war and 2) to discourage KSA start of conflict w Iran. Era of American blank check must end as MBS has shown himself too reckless to deserve such support
With Watergate, the coverup was worse than the crime. In the case of Jamal Khashoggi, the crime was worse. But both the crime and incompetent coverup should make everyone question the judgment of Saudi leadership— and worry given the country’s importance to the region and world

Asked on @60Minutes if climate change a hoax, @realDonaldTrump said “something’s changing and it will change back again.” He would not say it is man-made; said responding would cost $ and jobs. Wrong. Things will not go back, it is man-made, &amp; responding will create jobs &amp; save $
.@realDonaldTrump just claimed on @60Minutes that EU created to take advantage of the US on trade. Not exactly.  EU is heir to the European Coal and Steel Community, created to make sure France and Germany so knitted together that major war never again broke out in Europe.
Saudis have options re Khashoggi. They can continue denying it unless they cant. They can claim it was a rogue op and scapegoat a few. They can say he was a threat and deserved it. Bottom line: they are likely to judge Trump admin/others need them and move on-&amp; they may be right!
The truth will come out about what happened to Jamal Khashoggi. for now, impossible not to be dismayed by the commercial, amoral stance of @realDonaldTrump. Also, Saudis will not lightly buy bulk of their arms from others as arms sales tied to US ability to come to Saudi's aid
If the US continues to put its head in the sand when it comes to climate change, the only thing for sure is that there will be a lot more sand. Our policy of denial and inaction will rightly be condemned by future generations who will pay an enormous price https://t.co/7zVGqnbj1v

one other point. the USMCA, by promoting Mexican economic growth and employment, will do more to relieve immigration pressure on America's southern border than any wall. This, by the way, was the case with NAFTA as well.
USMCA is NAFTA plus TPP plus a few tweaks. Whatever...if @realDonaldTrump and the Congress are now prepared to embrace a pro-trade agenda, it is all to the good. Ideally, US participation in TPP by another name would be next; failing that, a US-Japan FTA would be second best.
The USMCA looks to be the trade pact formerly known as NAFTA plus 10-20%. Hope it becomes a precedent for TPP.  I suggest the US-Pacific Trade Agreement (USPTA).  What matters is that the US joins it; doing so would bolster our strategic position vis-a-vis China and our economy.

It is only a matter of time before NK links its willingness to denuclearize either to US denuclearization or withdrawal of all US forces from the peninsula.  ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ is being played and set up to take the blame for the failure of diplomacy https://t.co/IbWf797giO
.⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ may have found love, but Kim will not denuclearize b/c he sees nukes as essential for NK’s security. the conditions NK will set for denuclearization will be impossible to meet or too costly in terms of overall US interests to meet https://t.co/IbWf797giO
I am often a critic of @realDonaldTrump, but I thought his remarks friday were, in a word, presidential. Gracious re dr Ford, supportive but not over-the-top re Kavanaugh, deferential to senators, open to further investigation, and friendly to Pres Piñera https://t.co/wCwOsTABP0

US goods and services trade w Canada in slight surplus. Same for dairy trade; what is more, US dairy exports to Canada would be higher if US had joined TPP. @realDonaldTrump animosity toward Canada hard to explain unless tied to Canada’s refusal to sign on to 1-sided NAFTA 2.0
It is one thing for a nuclear and missile deal w NK to take years to implement; quite another for it to take years to negotiate. What needs to be done quickly is for NK to agree to a specific calendar of milestones, essential if we are to assess compliance https://t.co/codt3M6CBh
my thoughts on Potus UN speech for @NewYorker  "@realDonaldTrump channeled what seemed to be a mix of national-security adviser John Bolton and Howard Beale:  I reject all these threats to American sovereignty, and I’m not going to take this anymore."  https://t.co/Mnjpm4TrVw

my take for @axios on @realDonaldTrump UNGA speech depicting a US under siege, pushing back vs unfair trade pacts, but ignoring the need for multilateralism and the benefits of a world order that did so much for US security and prosperity for 70 years https://t.co/LSgA6TMIAE
.@realDonaldTrump said at UN "we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and are our friends." actually, foreign aid is a tool used to protect US security interests, fight terrorists, combat disease, help refugees, promote democracy, expand trade, and more.

@IngrahamAngle You are the one calling voters stupid, not me. UK Voters were, however, misled. More important, Brexit was put to a vote before it could be known what it would entail. When details are known, citizens should have a chance to accept or reject it given how consequential it is.
I do not understand why a 2nd Brexit referendum would be non-democratic when the first vote was taken amidst incomplete and often erroneous information. I also do not understand the lack of confidence by Brexit advocates: if it is such a good idea, it would surely win again
Latino America is mostly free of wars between countries. But it is plagued by violence within countries.  Governments (police forces, courts, prisons) are all too often too weak and too corrupt to take on gangs, cartels, etc. The statistics are staggering. https://t.co/OUA9FB46Bm
The EU will not support a soft, cherry picked, “have your cake and eat it” Brexit lest others be tempted to follow suit. This argues for a 2nd UK vote on Brexit in practice rather than Brexit in principle. This would be the more honest, democratic response https://t.co/MRQJNeleFD

China’s options on trade may be limited, but it has asymmetric options, including reducing purchases of US debt, increasing pressure on Taiwan, and easing up on sanctioning North Korea.  A trade war can easily widen in ways damaging to US national security https://t.co/OMBX3VA9JZ
read @realBobWoodward's Fear. It is Groundhog Day, as arguments made over and over on trade, allies, foreign policy have no impact. @realDonaldTrump admin is less ideological, which implies intellectual consistency, so much as anti-fact, anti-analysis, disinterested in history.
To paraphrase what is said about Brazil, that it has a great future and always will, denuclearization of NK is a worthy goal and always will be. In the meantime, the US needs a real-world policy to deal w NK’s nukes, ICBMS, artillery, and cyber tools. https://t.co/R8fsRpf2lO
This overt punishing of Palestinians absent any incentives will likely backfire. History—the 1973 war that followed the Arab loss in 1967, the intifadas, the Arab spring—shows that public humiliation tends to produce push-back and violence, not compromise https://t.co/cHlUxgxKMj

@barbaraslavin1 True, outsiders can make a difference, but this is often exaggerated. 95% of peacemaking must come from the protagonists themselves. That the US is no longer an honest broker in the Middle East is a sad truth but doesn’t alter the reality that few of the prerequisites exist
Conflicts only end-become ripe-when leaders on all sides are both willing and able to make significant compromises and see them thru. Sadat had Begin, Mandela had De Klerk. Such leadership is currently missing on both sides of Israel, Palestinian divide.   https://t.co/gjcGDFsw9y

2. Sovereignty involves obligations as well as rights. The govt of Venezuela has not met its obligations to its people or its neighbors plus it engineered a coup to keep itself in power. It is illegitimate and dangerous. Why do regional states need to maintain a hands-off policy?
1.  It is hard not to be struck by the reaction to my earlier tweet when i asked what would those who oppose a coup do. Why does R2P not apply? For all who condemn an intervention, how many more Venezuelans have to die or become refugees before you would support doing something?
@AmyJaffeenergy Agree 100%. But OAS useless given its requirement for consensus.  Real question is whether a regional coalition of the willing, led by local countries with US backing, would ever act.
@SevaUT Sovereignty should be respected ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL.  But what should happen when things are not equal, when a government fails to live up to its obligations to its citizens or neighbors? Sovereignty cannot only be about rights.  I discuss all this in “A World in Disarray.”

@realDonaldTrump This is further evidence of the over-personalization of foreign policy. Kim Jong-un has no intention of giving up NK's nuclear program no matter what his relationship w @realDonaldTrump. To the contrary, Kim sees his nuclear, ICBM programs as essential for his standing &amp; security
We learned after that aides of Nixon ignored some of his directives they thought unwise. Now we’ve learned in real time that aides around @realDonaldTrump are doing this. So has he-which makes it likely he will look to show he’s still in charge. The op-ed writer did us no favor.
In Woodward book, Egypt’s Sisi says “Donald. I’m worried about this investigation. Will you be around?” Now he, others are reading the anon op-ed. So we have uncertainty about @realDonaldTrump future combined w uncertainty over the present.  US cannot be effective in the world.

One additional thought RE the memorial service for John McCain: it was an important foreign policy statement to the world, that the America they had long known and admired still exists.  Acting in ways others respect and want to associate with is soft power at its most potent.

In Thursday night rally @realDonaldTrump confuses being diplomatic with diplomacy. No one expected or wanted him to be rude to Putin—just to press him hard on his interference with American democracy, on his annexation of Crimea, his indiscriminate use of force in Syria.
Watching @realDonaldTrump at his rallies you would conclude principal threats to this country are MS-13 or our media rather than Russia attacking US democracy and destabilizing parts of Europe or a NK increasing its nuclear and ICBM arsenal. This from the commander-in-chief
@realDonaldTrump As welcome as it is to receive remains of fallen soldiers, it does not offset the reality that NK continues to increase its nuclear material and ICBM numbers. "nice" letters and future meetings irrelevant unless the US prepared to get serious about constraining NK capabilities.

so Trump admin introduces tariffs that cost US exporters and trigger retaliation that hurts US companies/consumers and slows US eco growth-and then moves to bail out farmers hurt by the policy. would have been far better and cheaper not to have introduced tariffs in the 1st place
@realDonaldTrump this along w other recent tweets by @realDonaldTrump on trade reveal a frightening misunderstanding of the effects of tariffs and the significance (or lack of it) of trade deficits, and a refusal or inability to appreciate the economic and strategic costs to the US of a trade war
Trump admin unwilling to confront Iran on ground in region, so turning to sanctions, verbal support for regime change. But @realDonaldTrump threatening tweets bolster standing of lran’s leaders and make it hard for protesters to challenge regime lest they appear to do US bidding

@realDonaldTrump Actually no.  Most of what you list are not problems to be solved but conditions, situations, and challenges that at best can be managed...and then only if the US leads in concert with others, not if it acts alone, arbitrarily, and inconsistently.
US has long kept its distance from the ICC to shield its servicemen/diplomats from a prosecution that might be politicized and unfair, only to have Trump admin consider allowing russia to question/prosecute a former US ambassador and others in a setting sure to be loaded
It has been an awful week for the US. @realDonaldTrump did real damage to foreign relationships that have served this country well. Serious people are raising serious questions as to his motives. And too many who know better have said nothing or, worse yet, rushed to defend him.
The 7/17 @realDonaldTrump interview w @TuckerCarlson is extraordinary.  It is not just that the president throws Montenegro under the bus; he makes the US commitment to NATO conditional and makes clear his discomfort w Article 5 and collective security, the core of the alliance
In sum, Helsinki, where self-interest trumped the national interest, was a terrible end to a terrible week, one that began with @realDonaldTrump undermining NATO, the US-UK Special Relationship, and the EU.  By week’s end, America First resembled nothing so much as Russia First.
Helsinki was a worrisome and objectionable finale to a week that did much to undermine the foundations of U.S. foreign policy that have contributed so much to U.S. security, prosperity and influence for the better part of a century.  my take for @axios:  https://t.co/dxvFMSHx2X
Regardless of Helsinki 1:1, Mueller indictments signal Putin that US foreign policy and US-Russian relations are not 100% controlled by @realDonaldTrump and US govt knows a great deal about what Russian govt is up to and has options for responding to what Russia has done/might do
The purpose of foreign policy is not “to get along” w other countries. It is to shape the behavior of others in ways that are consistent w your interests and w international order. The measure of Helsinki is not whether Trump and Putin get along but how Russian behavior changes.
A normal Potus would arrive in Helsinki against a backdrop of US-European solidarity and would embrace the results of what we know about Russian interference in US elections as ammunition to make Russia pay for what it has done and to stop doing it.This is not a normal presidency
@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump right that US-Russia relations have never been worse, arguably as bad or worse as US-Soviet relations during much of Cold War.  But to attribute it to US investigation of Russian interference in US politics preposterous. It has all to do with Russia behavior.
International order for 4 centuries has been based on non-interference in the internal affairs of others and respect for sovereignty. Russia has violated this norm by seizing Crimea and by interfering in the 2016 US election. We must deal w Putin’s Russia as the rogue state it is
It is less that the liberal world order is unraveling so much as the liberal world order is being dismantled. What makes this unique history is that this order is being undone by its principal architect—the US—which is not putting forward an alternative https://t.co/D8xK3zuuHH
alliances rest on a foundation of common threat perceptions and reliability re the ability/will of members to honor their obligation to meet that threat. Nato’s foundation was shaky before @realDonaldTrump but largely b/c of him is now crumbling. Europe’s stability is in jeopardy
.@realDonaldTrump remarks at NATO and Sun interview coupled with US tariffs will cement his reputation as the Ugly American. Even if NATO members spend a bit more on defense the US will be weaker for it all as resistance to working with the US and following its lead will mount
@SteveRattner thanks for the vote of confidence chart-man. As I just responded to @realDonaldTrump, NK sees nuclear weapons as essential for its security and leverage and has no intention of given them up or submitting to the sort of intrusive verification regime that would be required.
@realDonaldTrump No contract emerged from Singapore, only a vague statement that included no definition of denuclearization. China is not the problem here; it is North Korea, which sees nuclear weapons as essential for security and leverage. Unrealistic for @realDonaldTrump to think otherwise.
if things were normal in the UK, now would be the time a pro-EU leader of the Labour Party would step up and facilitate the fall of an unraveling Tory government and call for an election that would be a de facto 2nd referendum on the self-inflicted wound that is Brexit.  alas.

A danger is @realDonaldTrump will claim he tried diplomacy and it failed b/c Kim betrayed him and now military force is called for. But a rushed summit and demands that NK denuclearize in short order or else is not a serious test of diplomacy. Need to explore interim/partial deal
US-NK cognitive dissonance. ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ will have to decide whether to keep claiming success and looking away, reintroduce threat of a war that would be of great risk and cost, or embrace real diplomacy and possibility of a partial deal w NK. https://t.co/J0HosiRrYV
There is a restaurant in NYC-Serendipity-where you can have dessert as the 1st course.  Singapore was the diplomatic equivalent.  Now US and NK are trying to build a timeline of reciprocal steps to as yet undefined denuclearization.  Spinach time.   https://t.co/J0HosiRrYV

.@realDonaldTrump correct that Germany should spend more on defense, but seems unable to understand that US derives considerable benefit from a Europe that is whole, free and prosperous.  a US at war with Europe over trade and divorced strategically will be poorer and weaker.
Truly offensive to see @realDonaldTrump mock @GeorgeHWBush given 41’s 1) life of public service; 2) commitment to volunteerism; 3) critical role in ending Cold War peacefully and on our terms and then leading world in liberating Kuwait, the 1st test of post-cold war era
@JohnJHarwood At a time there are so many outrageous developments that it is difficult to feel outrage, this clearly does the trick.  Will no one on the inside speak out or resign over this breach of faith to others than weakens this country in so many ways?
@JustinRaimondo Your might want to do your homework before you level charges.  If you look at my book “War of Necessity, War of Choice” you will see that I did not support the 2003 Iraq war.
So far principal results of Singapore summit have been to sow doubts about US commitment to its South Korean ally, to weaken sanctions on NK, and to raise questions about US seriousness given enormous gap between rhetoric of denuclearization and reality  https://t.co/57DqjnGWC3
Reports @realDonaldTrump planning to meet with Putin without staff present grounds for alarm given the stakes. Increases odds Potus will freelance and that there will be subsequent disagreement over what was said and agreed. Singapore hardly a reassuring precedent in this regard.
@realDonaldTrump NK testing suspension important, but hardly denuclearization, which remains far off and improbable.  Yes, we are not at war, which is obviously a good thing, but if war avoidance is the US policy aim, then we had better get used to living with NK nuclear weapons and missiles.
It is nearly half a century since Sen Mike Mansfield tried to reduce US forces in Europe.  He was defeated.  We then unilaterally cut our forces after the end of the Cold War. Now we are seeing the revival of Mansfieldism amidst a rising Russian threat.  https://t.co/f0bQn8Puxn
2. Again, NATO allies should spend more on defense. But threats of US doing less or rethinking NATO tie is not the way to bring it about.  Much better to focus on threats in area (Russia) and those outside (especially in Middle East and North Africa).   https://t.co/f0bQn8Puxn
1. To be sure, most NATO allies should spend more on defense. But at least as important as how much they spend is how they spend it.  Too much duplication, not enough specialization.  Whole should be more not  less than the sum of its parts.    https://t.co/f0bQn8Puxn

Recent reports @realDonaldTrump wants US out of WTO and possibly US troops out of Germany. All this after US leaves TPP, Paris climate pact, and JCPOA, and Potus discusses taking US troops out of S Korea.  America First appears to go hand in hand with the Withdrawal Doctrine.
@ronce @axios @realDonaldTrump The short answer is “no”.  Usually great powers lose their hold through exhaustion or the rise of a more powerful rival.  The abdication we are now seeing by the US is unprecedented.  This btw is the theme of the afterward to the paperback edition of “A World in Disarray”.
diplomacy was to be an alternative not just to war w NK but also to it maintaining/expanding its nuclear and missile capabilities. As feared, it looks as tho NK using diplomacy as a cover. Issue is whether @realDonaldTrump will continue to claim success and look away or respond.
@NazaninBoniadi @stevenacook And I heartily recommend the fantastic show Counterpart on Starz when you need a break from the disarray in this world.
.@axios report that @realDonaldTrump wants US out of WTO further evidence that 45th Potus is a disrupter in chief who fails to understand how the US benefits from a world of values, relationships, and institutions and how much US security and prosperity would suffer without them
@LordRickettsP Thank you peter.  We seem to be in a moment in which history is increasingly ignored or distorted.  As you know better than most, neither is a good thing.
.@realDonaldTrump truly has his history wrong here. EU (and EC before it) was not set up to take advantage of the US but rather to so integrate Europe that war on the continent on the scale of WWI or WWII would be unthinkable, something v much in the US national interest.

@VonniMediaMogul @_cingraham @realDonaldTrump I speak with members of the administration from time to time and of course would be willing to speak/meet with Potus if he were open to it.  I may disagree with him on many issues, but he is the only president we have right now and he has significant power and influence.

@rinsana it is not so much that NAFTA was conceived for the purpose of relieving pressure on our boarders but reduced emigration from mexico was a consequence of NAFTA as the Mexican economy expanded and there were more good jobs at home.
saddened to learn of the death of Charles Krauthammer. We did not always agree, but it was impossible not to respect him and admire the clarity of thought. His 1991 @ForeignAffairs article "The Unipolar Moment" was seminal and shaped debate over post-Cold War US foreign policy.
@Gil_Paris merci.  although i do worry about those who take what i said here literally.
just had a thought:  is it possible America not playing in the World Cup somehow related to the Trump administration's lack of enthusiasm for US participation in multilateral fora?
No successful immigration policy can begin at the border. Yes, we need comprehensive reform, but we also need trade and aid policies in Central America to reduce the poverty and help governments contend w violence so that people will not feel compelled to risk their lives to flee
WH advisors seem unaware China has options other than tariff hikes (including stopping debt purchases) to respond to US tariff hikes...plus trade is hardly the only issue on the US-China agenda.  NSC system invented to integrate US policy missing in action https://t.co/zI2CDcuPwz
The Trump admin has a strong case vs the UN Human Rights Council, which really is institutionalized hypocrisy. What weakens its case is its pattern of walking away from multilateral arrangements that deserve US participation, including the Paris accord, TPP, the JCPOA, etc.
@Brad_Setser @bradburst all of which (again) underscores the error US made by remaining outside TPP
@Brad_Setser @bradburst you could well be right.  but if china does what you say it will only widen the trade gap, which will lead the Trump administration to add new tariffs or find some other penalty...in which case china will find itself looking for new ways to retaliate. no one will win this war
on a happier note than my tweets about tariffs and summits, just learned today is #NationalMartiniDay. important not to ignore. so heading home before long for a Tanqueray 10, dry, on the rocks, with several olives thrown in for fiber.
another area where there are no rules re trade wars once they start is "germaneness."  before long china might run out of room to respond to US tariff hikes with tariff hikes of its own and instead suspend US debt purchases. this could cause markets to tumble and force rates up.
sobering statistic:  nearly 1 of every 100 people on the planet (68.5 million) is internally displaced (IDP), a refugee, or seeking asylum. nearly 2/3 (40 million) forcibly displaced within their own countries in situations where protections minimal.  https://t.co/eP05mniMx4

@DebraPS yes...but the administration has elected not to act according to the rulebook...which may well mean that others will feel less constrained to do so as well.  what is taking place is largely taking place outside the WTO.  we may well see non-trade based responses to tariffs.
there are no rules of war when it comes to trade wars. no rules as to proportionality, protection of non-combatants, legitimate types of weaponry, requirement for authority. the Trump administration seems to have ignored all this along w the potential retaliation and escalation.

If and when NK resists denuclearization, it is only a matter of time before @realDonaldTrump will say Kim Jung-un betrayed him...which is why the ultimate legacy of the Singapore Summit could still be a march toward war.  My latest from @ProSyn  https://t.co/eNFDI9aQsp
So if US had joined TPP 1) its dairy exports would have more access to Canada; 2) it would have more eco and strategic leverage vs China; 3) it would be exporting more to 11 countries, adding to US growth in the process.  Any chance @realDonaldTrump can be persuaded to revisit?
It is hard to avoid the irony: many in Trump admin rightfully criticized Obama admin for wanting JCPOA w Iran too much and agreeing to terms not sufficiently demanding--and now @realDonaldTrump went to Singapore wanting a "success" and signed a statement w NK even less demanding
@realDonaldTrump Exercises are not war games; that is a term used by North Korea to de-legitimize what we do to maintain deterrence and readiness. The costs are real but hardly a fortune, and are well worth it if they keep the peace and ensure we would prevail if NK ever were to invade the South.
.@realDonaldTrump claim there is no longer a NK nuclear threat patently false. The summit changed nothing. Worse yet, overselling the summit makes it harder to keep sanctions in place, further reducing pressure on NK to reduce (much less give up) its nuclear weapons and missiles
the conversation on @Varneyco in which my suggestion that @realDonaldTrump talked tougher in advance of the summit than he negotiated was received with a decided lack of enthusiasm:  https://t.co/jOduvK4tpW
"The good news is the Singapore summit initiated a diplomatic process. War seems much more distant than it did just months ago. The bad news is that "potential" is the operative word here, and we are off to an unbalanced start." my take for @axios   https://t.co/lBTJCcX9I5
.@realDonaldTrump to Kim Jung-un: "I said, look at that place, wouldn't that make a great condo? Think of it from a real estate perspective." US foreign policy has clearly changed; the containment doctrine has given way to the condominium doctrine.  Move aside George Kennan.
One of the downsides of portraying the summit as a success will be that it will be tougher to maintain any Chinese and Russian and even South Korean support for robust sanctions—all of which will make it even more difficult to get NK to make good on its promise to denuclearize
Unfortunate @realDonaldTrump spoke of US-RoK exercises as provocative war games.  Also troubling he spoke of removing US troops w/o reference to reducing NK conventional mil threat.  And suggestions he did not inform RoK govt in advance, if true, would be latest blow to an ally.
The Singapore summit statement is essentially aspirational:  no definitions of denuclearization, no timelines, no details as to verification. What is most troubling about all this is that the US gave up something tangible, namely, US-RoK military exercises, in exchange.
Just because something never happened before doesn’t make it historic. That requires its results be significant and enduring.  Smart point by @jmeacham on @Morning_Joe on Singapore summit.

2 WH staffers attack the leader of a democratically-elected ally w words better aimed at violent enemies, then a prominent actor does his bit to further coarsen our public space. There should be no place for the former in any administration, for the latter in any public setting.
Alliances are formed to enhance strength, not communicate weakness and division.  Attacks on leader of democratically-elected ally by WH staff (presumably at president’s behest) are thus ill-timed as well as appalling, short-sighted, and unprecedented.  https://t.co/C6QVVrjzIL
Amidst @realDonaldTrump, @larry_kudlow trashing of @JustinTrudeau, worth noting 1) US-Canada trade roughly in balance; 2) dairy miniscule % of the trade, 3) TPP would have increased US dairy access to Canada; 4) Canadian dairy program resembles nothing so much as US sugar program
@dandrezner If so it is a first.
The Charlevoix G7 communique is the standard mix of generalities, aspirations, contradictions, and avoidance.  Only on climate is it a G6 vs US. @realDonaldTrump’s 11th hour reneging on supporting it all about posturing and message sending, not policy.  https://t.co/jYWMF6FqEO
@hitsabouttime Thank you very much for this generous reaction
The unraveling of G-7 summit works in NK’s favor as @realDonaldTrump will not want to bust up 2 summits in a row lest people conclude he is the problem. Increases incentive for Kim to up his asks and limit his compromises and for Trump to do the opposite. Hardly the ideal context

Much of pres trump’s &amp; world’s focus on Singapore, but the more significant summit may be in Quebec.  NK constitutes a significant but narrow challenge, but the rupture in transatlantic ties is structural, constituting a systemic challenge to what has been a US-led world order.
@EmmanuelMacron La lune de miel est terminee.
As the strategist Prince might have said, the Group formally known as 7.  Sad, self-inflicted, costly and counter-productive but not surprising given a Potus and an administration inclined toward unilateralism and committed to America 1st and protectionism https://t.co/mEzFu3nrFm

in @realDonaldTrump we have a Potus who is both his own chief of staff and national security adviser. this is a formula for disaster, as it ensures policy will not be made in a careful, systematic way and that implementation will be uneven or worse.  https://t.co/qUSqlLNtS1

to be clear: @realDonaldTrump introduced tariffs that will 1) cost more jobs than saved &amp; raise prices to consumers; 2) cited national security grounds as basis even tho allies targeted; 3) did it outside the institution (WTO) the US helped create to avoid a 1920's-like trade war
.@realDonaldTrump pursuing not just America 1st but trade 1st foreign policy, one that will  undermine alliances and security on behalf of a flawed trade policy that will lose jobs and hurt consumers. Hard to exaggerate how misguided and costly this all is https://t.co/RvjQPsdCUy
latest policy on tariffs will be bad for US economy, foreign policy. Protectionism and American First will not save much less generate jobs but will further undermine the network of alliances and institutions US worked so hard over past 70 years to build. https://t.co/yFEuPCX1W2
@barbaraslavin1 or at least as the person who gets to write the headlines

good @realDonaldTrump overruled his national security advisor who had suggested the Libya precedent was what the US had in mind for the NK summit. This clarification increases the odds a summit will occur.  It also means the summit is not doomed to fail.  https://t.co/537SwKevEA
One other thought. If, as seems likely, it was reaching a level of nuclear and missile capability that gave NK the confidence to come to a summit rather than just pressure of sanctions and US threats, then NK rejection of US preconditions/demands for denuclearization predictable.
Wrong to simply describe NK’s latest statements as a “return to form”. It also reflects unrealistic US hopes/demands that NK agree to a demanding definition of denuclearization as a first step. All or nothing approach to diplomacy will likely yield nothing https://t.co/2w5V1YGZpq

"iatrogenic illness" refers to illness brought on by treatment, by what doctors and nurses do. The decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem absent a larger negotiation, w/o asking anything of Israel or involving the Palestinians, can best be understood as iatrogenic diplomacy
Sharp contrast between Israeli celebration of US embassy move and deadly violence at Gaza border. this contrast captures the starkly different lives and world views of Israelis and Palestinians. A tale of two realities that is on an increasingly destructive path for both sides.

“Repeal without Replace” is the thread that ties @realDonaldTrump foreign policy to his domestic policy. It risks doing to the world what it has done to health care here at home. Costs will go up while problems mount. It is a question of when not if a crisis results.

factually incorrect White House statement on Iran nuclear program either evidence of lack of rigorous national security process or (and much worse) the politicization of intelligence, ie, the deliberate misrepresentation of the facts in order to justify breaking up the JCPOA.
Nothing stated by Israel PM or WH contradicts that Iran in compliance w JCPOA and best US policy is to live with it, counter Iranian push for regional primacy, impose penalties for ballistic missile devt, and set stage for follow-on accord that extends JCPOA’s critical sub-limits
there is clear tension betw pressing China on trade and enlisting its help on N Korea--as well as betw blowing up the iran nuclear deal and pressing NK to give up its nukes. All this is evidence of a national security decision-making process that is either non-existent or flawed.

@realDonaldTrump Agree with @realDonaldTrump here. Lots of promise in Korean developments but 90% of life implementation.  Good news is how prospects for war have receded, but much has to be accomplished in order to normalize peninsula and diminish threat to US
Extraordinary dev’ts on Korean Peninsula, but-and there must be a but-unclear if NK sincere b/c of sanctions, China or a ploy to reduce sanctions, divide US from SK. Also unclear whether NK prepared to give up nukes or whether the nukes are what give NK the confidence to do this.
French Pres @EmmanuelMacron solidified his standing as leader of the West (to the extent there still is a West) by his call today before Congress for an updated liberal world order to meet regional, global challenges. His problem is a lack of partners in Europe and here in US.
Best outcome for US would be 1) US to remain in JCPOA; 2) reach consensus w friends/allies on how to deal with Iran regional push and missile development; 3) get Europeans to commit to follow-on pact that extends centrifuge, enriched uranium limits on Iran https://t.co/vuQReiwTHP

@realDonaldTrump The “mission accomplished” by Syria strikes was to impose a price for CW use. Useful but limited. No way to know if a deterrent effect; previous strike failed to achieve this. And nothing done to protect Syrian people vs non-CW attacks or to commit US to open-ended effort vs Isis
My analysis of the Syria strikes for @axios...warranted, punitive, limited in scope and narrow in purpose, but in the end much more about responding to CW use than about trying to accomplish anything in Syria, where US aims still both modest and unclear. https://t.co/4GDLeJj2CZ
The US strikes in were a legitimate but narrow response to Syrian CW use. There is no visible change in US policy toward Syria, ie, the US did not act to weaken the regime. Nor is there any more clarity re future US policy or presence in Syria.

TR advised to talk softly and carry a big stick.  @realDonaldTrump talks (and tweets) loudly but with an uncertain stick. National security in the nuclear age and at a time US commitments are greater than its capabilities is much too serious and dangerous to conduct on twitter
@realDonaldTrump Foreign policy by twitter is a dangerous game. We do not want to turn Syria into a game of chicken given limited US options in (and military forces near) Syria, Russian military assets there and in Europe as well as its nuclear forces, and the US need to keep focused on N Korea.
@realDonaldTrump Not clear 1) who will pay big price. Assad? Russia? Iran? 2) what constitutes a big price. And 3) how this squares w @realDonaldTrump desire to pull US out of Syria. First test for the new NSA.
I also wonder if those advising @realDonaldTrump on trade with China are familiar with Chinese history, Chinese negotiating style, and Chinese politics and economics alike. I say all this as confidence China will cave in to public US pressure is questionable at best.
1 more thing re tariffs. The confrontational @realDonaldTrump trade stance makes it more likely China will retaliate and less likely it will compromise. Xi also has domestic politics that make it hard for him to back down in face of public US pressure. Diplomacy has its virtues!
US tariffs by raising prices will cost more American jobs than they save, reduce disposable income, and add to inflation. What they wont do is protect lost US IP. Chinese tariffs hurt US exporters. And China has other tools including the option of slowing its purchases of US debt

I wonder if any of those advising @realDonaldTrump on trade have pointed out the US hand would be far stronger vis-a-vis China if it had joined TPP and was confronting China not unilaterally but in concert w Japan and 10 others who with US constitute 40% of global economy.
WH statement on China trade incoherent. How new US tariffs are relevant to past Chinese theft of intellectual property is a mystery. All new US tariffs will do is trigger new Chinese tariffs. US focus should be on protecting IP going forward, reducing asymmetrical chinese tariffs
Reports @realDonaldTrump doubling down on China tariffs will tank markets for 2 reasons: 1) a trade war looks more likely and 2) it underscores that this is a president who thrives on confrontation and turbulence, traits sure to unnerve markets that prefer comity and stability

The President wants to remove troops from places they they are needed (Syria) and introduce them to places they are not (the border with Mexico). As with what is happening on the trade front, hopes unmet that @realDonaldTrump would leave campaigning behind in favor of governing.
Outgoing NSA McMaster's farewell speech a tough statement on Russia; question as always is who he speaks for. He criticizes "some nations" that have looked the other way in face of hybrid Russian threats-which too often is a fair description of the administration he has served.

this administration cannot leave well enough alone. The economy was doing just fine, and now is at risk owing to real and threatened protectionism, too much stimulus (thanks to tax cuts and spending hikes) and exploding debt, all of which will cause upward pressure on rates.
Giving up on Syria would constitute a strategic victory for the regime, Iran and Russia—and an opportunity for Isis to recoup; it would also be a moral stain on the US, both for abandoning the Syrian Kurds and for ignoring the plight of the Syrian people https://t.co/O6OCgjArHh
As predicted, Russians responded in kind, which leaves matters “even” despite fact Russians 100% in the wrong and reality this relationship already suffers from too little diplo interaction.  Again, US response should target eco interests of Russian elite https://t.co/G8Otdjz00i

Decision to expel Russian “diplomats” less than optimal/creative as will likely lead to Moscow responding in kind. Better to choose asymmetrical response, ie, targeted economic and travel sanctions, increased public diplomacy vs Putin, etc so that costs fall mostly on Russia.

A national security advisor must be an honest broker, ensuring the Potus considers all points of view. Second, he is a counselor with his own views. Brent Scowcroft was the gold standard; the obvious question is whether John Bolton has the temperament and the judgment for the job
This administration inherited a strong economy and stood to benefit-but seems determined to kill the golden goose with protectionism that risks a trade war and, with the “help” of Republican majority in Congress, runaway spending, overly deep tax cuts, and debt increase.

Yes, there is promise in a US-North Korea summit, but the risks are more obvious, some of which stem from legit doubts about the North’s intentions, some from the administration’s near exclusive focus on the nuclear issue.  My take on it all for @axios  https://t.co/0ex9FYkwfX
@ianbremmer You left Ukraine off your list. The govt signed the Budapest accord, gave up its nukes in exchange for assurances from the US and others, and lost Crimea to Russia. All this along w Iraq and Libya adds up to the US having undermined its own nonproliferation policy.
It is smart to be skeptical and cautious-and critical that US coordinates closely with S. Korea and Japan. If talks “succeed” it must be on terms that protect our interests/alliances. And if talks fail it needs to be clear it was NK that acted in bad faith https://t.co/uYOgFyNWmt
Interesting that NK proposed summit, and even more interesting (if reports accurate) it signed onto testing freeze. What will be truly interesting tho is how NK defines denuclearization and what it is linked to. Promises to be a major test for US statecraft and US-RoK alliance
how proposed steel tariffs could kill 45,000 jobs in auto industry-a number equal to 1/3 the entire American steel workforce! (note: far more American jobs would be lost given higher prices for other products, retaliation vs US exports @BennSteil @CFR_org  https://t.co/3ovVDhsRnF
One of many reasons we need a serious policy process is that we are on verge of applying tariffs to steel imports from South Korea at a time US and SK need to coordinate closely on how to respond to diplomatic possibilities w North Korea. this is why NSC was created 70 years ago.
Truly a sad and bad day for the United States, as TPP comes into force without us while US deciding on which countries to apply unwarranted and ill-advised tariffs.  Abdication of 3/4 of a century of promoting a trade order that has served US eco and strategic interests.

Personal reasons aside, there are 2 reasons to resign a high-level govt job. You can disagree w a major decision and choose not to be associated with it, or you can disagree w a stream of decisions and judge it is the wrong place for you to be. Or (possibly for Gary Cohn) both.
@DCBorthwick Not necessarily.  A testing freeze is relatively easy to monitor and would be significant.  We could also put a production freeze on the agenda, although this would be far more difficult to monitor/verify.
Sorry to say this is spot on; Trumpism will endure long after Trump departs political scene.  The best antidote is a serious commitment to civics education, to reconnect young Americans with the DNA of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and founding fathers https://t.co/UzKtLwYAnI
This is significant.  Getting a freeze on NK testing should be the most critical near term aim; denuclearization a long-term goal.  US needs to decide what it would offer NK, ie, security assurances, adjustments to US-ROK exercises, reduced eco sanctions.  https://t.co/RjkjFlHlzE

The strength of the extremes in Italy, along with the strength of far right in both France and Germany, not to mention Brexit--all suggest that Trumpism will remain potent even after @realDonaldTrump leaves the Oval Office. New job-eliminating technologies will fuel it as well.

Yes, Trump’s Tariff Plan Leaves Blue-Collar Winners and Losers.  But not equally.  Far more jobs will be lost than preserved, especially once retaliation is factored in. And those same workers will be paying more for products they buy. So hardly a wash. https://t.co/B5acjn3kpz
The US should likewise agree to talks without preconditions; what matters in diplomacy is not where you start but where you end up.  The US also has option of stating at the 1st meeting that talks can only continue so long as NK observes a testing freeze https://t.co/VCMbVxxLJS

the lack of anything resembling a serious process around both the gun and tariff announcements makes painfully clear we have a White House in disarray at the same time we have a world in disarray. if you are not worried, you should be. the combination is nothing less than toxic.
The national security case for steel tariffs is preposterous (our ally Canada is #1 source of US steel imports) and dangerous, as it creates a "rationale" for protection that others will use, risking a trade regime that has helped allies, restrained foes, and boosted US economy
The tariff decision, done for national security, will weaken it, as will complicate US ties w Europe (needed on Iran, Russia, etc) and China (needed on N Korea). It will cost more jobs than it saves and add to inflationary pressures. a terrible call on both strategic, eco grounds

@realDonaldTrump This tweet by Potus also sets up a false choice between spending abroad and at home, between guns and butter.  We need both as national security requires a stable world and a strong country. The good news is we can have both if we are smart and willing to make some hard choices.

Imagine a spectrum, with normal politics at one end and then partisanship, polarization, and finally delegitimization at the other. Calling Democrats in Congress treasonous crosses over into delegitimization and makes needed compromise and governing difficult if not impossible.
Market falls create their own momentum. But there is also legitimate fear of rising rates owing to excessive tax cuts amidst a fast-growing economy and the need to finance ballooning debt. And there is a lack of confidence in administration’s ability to manage a financial crisis.

The memo is largely devoted to discrediting the decision to monitor Carter Page because some percentage of the intelligence came from a source deemed to be prejudiced. The memo fails to discredit the substance of the case or deal with other justifications for monitoring Page.

Democrats should not reject what Trump tabled on immigration because of the ugly rhetoric. A path to citizenship for Dreamers is essential, and a more skills-based visa policy is in the national interest.  worth the $ for a wall and accepting some limits on family unification.
So it appears US will have to get along without an ambassador to South Korea for a second year as @VictorDCha out of contention, reportedly for opposing a limited preventive military strike on NK.  The diplomatic dimension of national security continues to get short shrift
Immigration by far the most substantial part of #Sotu. Dreamers, limited family unification, skills-based entry priority, wall-together there is basis for a compromise policy
President embraced “beautiful clean coal” but no mention of climate change; embraced tax cuts but no mention of national debt; embraced human rights in North Korea and Iran but no mention of repression in Russia, Philippines and Turkey.  A selective state of the union/world.
The Potus rightly criticizes Iran and North Korea for their repression of their citizens...but never gets around to criticizing Russia, Turkey, Philippines for much the same thing.  Selective criticism by definition cannot have the power or impact of consistent principled policy
One thing to require that foreign aid go to friends—something very different to define friends as those who support us on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital
just once it would be nice to hear this president acknowledge all that immigrants have done over the centuries to make this country great and portray immigration as something other than a security threat, which on balance it is not

#Davos shows that @EmmanuelMacron and others in Europe have a vision for global efforts to meet common challenges but not the capacity--and @realDonaldTrump's America has the capacity to lead but no longer embraces the vision. The result is bad for Europe, the US, and the world.
Potus #davos speech will have little if any impact. Defined America 1st in narrow eco terms rather than making case for US leadership in global efforts. And focused on narrow trade concerns rather than making case for massive effort to retrain workers whose jobs disappearing.
Potus has opened the door by a crack to join what he normally describes as the “terrible” TPP.  USTR should be pressed by Congress, media, the core 11 countries that have joined to detail what changes US desires.
Potus using #Davos stage to make the case for American eco strength.  Fair enough.  Danger is his policies on trade could trigger inflation, retaliation, and slow growth.

the world is in greater disarray at a time the US government is in mounting disarray.  It is as they say no coincidence.

@NickKristof Israel’s true friends should fight the trends undermining the potential for a 2 state solution. The Trump administration sees itself as a friend of Israel but has done nothing to halt the drift; in fact, it has contributed to it w its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital
@NickKristof But given the demographics that would mean the end of Israel’s Jewish character.  That is precisely why Israel cannot have it all and oppose a Palestinian State.

worrisome gap has opened across Atlantic over iran. Trump admin should keep nuclear issue on back burner and avoid any moves re JCPOA while events in iran unfold. what would help would be joint US-EU threat of new sanctions linked to human rights if regime cracks down violently.
I understand the case for reducing aid to Pakistan given the sanctuary it gives the Taliban and terrorists. But the mix of Pakistan's internal weakness, terrorists, and its nuclear arsenal makes for a real threat. We also need a policy to lower the odds it becomes a failed state.

In last 24 hours Trump has threatened to 1) cut aid to nuclear-armed, terrorist-laden Pakistan; 2) cut aid to miffed Palestinians after he alters US Jerusalem policy, and 3) boasted his nuclear button is bigger than Kim Jung-un's. This is our commander-in-chief. Think about it.

foreign aid is a national security tool designed to bank goodwill with and build capacity of friends so that when we call on them to work with us they are more willing and able to do so. aid is an investment for the long term, not a switch to be turned on and off in anger.
What makes Trump admin think it can act unilaterally on Jerusalem and threaten other governments and UN when US criticized for it-and then expect others to work with the US at the UN to pressure N Korea or Iran? Is nobody thinking strategically about relationships or priorities?

The risk of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital is not that it will derail the peace process as there is no peace process w any real prospects. The risk is that it will increase tensions &amp; lead to violence at a time there is more than enough tension &amp; violence in the world
@LynnSherr This shift of US policy toward Jerusalem has no upside but great potential downside. It is unilateral, it puts the most controversial issue center stage, it offers nothing to Palestinians, it undermines US standing as a fair mediator, &amp; it could well incite violence.
True, holding off US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital did not result in peace. The lack of progress can be chalked up to Israeli &amp; Palestinian behavior alike. But equally clear is that changing US policy toward Jerusalem now will likely make the situation much worse.
A dismal week for US diplomacy: First we boycott the UN conference on migration at a time 1 of every 100 people in the world is uprooted; then we change US policy re Jerusalem in a way that could well introduce yet another source of violence in Middle East https://t.co/bGYoBEaLF8

you would be forgiven for thinking this Pres had enough on his plate overseas, what with N Korea, S China Sea, Ukraine, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, etc, but you would be wrong. for no good reason the plan this week is to add the status of Jerusalem to the mix. baffling.
first few minutes of @Giants game making clear that benching eli critical to the team's turnaround.  a questionable decision (only justifiable if they had started their untested rookie qb) handled terribly.  this team needs a reboot, starting from the top.
Listening to @GrahamBlog on @FaceTheNation reinforces my sense that the Trump administration is seriously contemplating a preventive attack on NK. Too many observers discount this prospect by making the error of confusing what they see as desirable w what is increasingly possible
@wendyranderson Thank you Wendy. Much and truly appreciated. We are proud of the @CFR_org Women &amp; Foreign Policy program (now approaching its 15th anniversary) as well as the growing number of women (such as you) who are members of our organization or who are part of our extraordinary staff.
I wonder if the tour guides at the US Capitol will continue to describe the Senate as "the world's greatest deliberative body."  If so, one can only hope that in the aftermath of the rushed vote on tax cuts they are regularly challenged by their fellow citizens who are visiting.
We have come a long ways as a country only to have taxation w/o deliberation. There is an argument for reducing the corporate tax rate; there is no argument for increasing the debt by $1 trillion. To the contrary, the eco, national security considerations argue against doing so.
US just moved closer to using mil force vs NK (in this case, versus oil imports) which would move us closer to war. Here is US UN amb Nikki Haley on 11/29: China must cut off the oil from N. Korea. China can do this on its own, or we can take the oil situation into our own hands.
public spat over retweets of anti-Muslim videos between the President &amp; British PM further underscores just how unspecial the US-UK relationship has become...all part of a larger trend of an american foreign policy that places little value on alliances
hard to exaggerate difference between how George W. Bush visited a mosque post-9/11 to make it clear US problem was w terrorists not Muslims--&amp; how this president retweets material (some bogus) that incites anger at all Muslims rather than just violent or hate-filled individuals.

Potus claims to have established a new framework for trade in Asia when the reality is that the US has placed itself outside the best available framework for trade in the region. The country will pay an enormous economic, strategic price as a result.
Potus rejects "freeze 4 freeze" w NK and also calls for denuclearization, which NK rejects. so the question remains whether this administration is prepared to accept lesser diplomatic outcomes as an alternative to war or an unconstrained NK arsenal.

@realDonaldTrump What @realDonaldTrump seems unable to understand is that foreign policy is NOT about personal relationships but national interest. US goal should not be to be friends with leader of NK or any country but to persuade others it is in their interest to take US interests into account
@realDonaldTrump Aim should not be to have "good relationship" w Russia but rather for Russian govt to act w greater restraint at home &amp; abroad. Confronting Putin when he violates basic global norms, as he did in interfering in US election, is an essential part of US policy.
Just when I think my capacity to be surprised has been exhausted, Pres Trump declares that he accepts Putin's word (over CIA's) that he never interfered in our election &amp; worries the Russian leader feels insulted by charge to contrary

Potus right to reject imposing US way of life on others but to let it shine as eg-except his attacks on media, courts have tarnished our eg.
RT @OnPointRadio: We're talking about President Trump's first UN address LIVE with @yochidreazen and  @RichardHaass https://t.co/v0rIPrOIZh
Hard to argue with what Potus said re Venezuela; real question is what US, neighbors prepared to do in way of sanctions, help for opposition
Threats vs N Korea, ridiculing its leader more likely to persuade NK to increase its nuclear weapons &amp; missiles than limit them/give them up
Hope/trust someone doing a count on how often Potus using the word "sovereignty" in his UNGA address...well into double figures already
Potus speech v tough vs Pakistan; not explicitly named, but put on notice that those providing sanctuary to Taliban supporting terrorism
Potus UN speech resurrects "axis of evil" with only change that it has shrunk from 3 to 2: Iraq has fallen off but North Korea, Iran remain
Doesn't help for Potus to challenge UN to act vs North Korea and use the pronoun "they" rather than "we"
Hope respect for Ukraine's sovereignty leads Trump administration to provide lethal defensive articles to Ukraine &amp; keep sanctions vs Russia
Listening to Potus, you would think American sovereignty on life support-when in fact it is alive &amp; well at UN (given US veto) &amp; beyond
There is argument for shooting down NK missiles being tested so threat to US territory doesn't materialize  https://t.co/GHLaBWQH3d

@pammymack81 great to hear.  Thank you....and hope she gets an A!
managing NK would require deterrence &amp; defense; attacking could be preemptive (vs missile to be launched) or preventive strike vs facilities
sanctions no answer to N Korea given limits to what China, Russia will do. choice will narrow to managing threat or attacking it in some way

Congress should act to protect Dreamers. Book of Ezekiel (children should not pay for "sins" of parents) should be required reading
SecDef Mattis wording suggests US possibly moving toward preemptive strategy: only attack NK if launch vs US or ally judged to be imminent
@realDonaldTrump That is well and good up to a point, but where is the diplomatic dimension? National security includes but extends beyond the military.
@realDonaldTrump 1 million plus American jobs tied to exports to China. Not to mention that China largest foreign holder of US debt. Eco war would be costly

@djrothkopf Military action not only option but is an option that warrants consideration given risks &amp; costs of living w improving NK nuc/missile force
N Korea's 6th nuc test shows greater yield/smaller size. So much for efficacy of UN votes, eco sanctions, Chinese pressure, American bluster
A secstate can opt to reduce special envoys or go slow on senior appointments but makes no sense to do both. Diplomacy requires diplomats.
NK warhead, missile advances means US fast approaching choice betw managing threat thru defense/deterrence or undertaking preventive strike
Pulling out of US-S Korea trade pact a truly bad idea. Would weaken alliance when need to coord vs N Korea a must.  https://t.co/wZLGwOVnef

Deterrence rests on assumption of rationality. NK's missile launch over Japan raises new ?s here, increasing odds of US preventive strike
N Korea missile test over Japan will stimulate missile defense buildup as well as intensify consideration of preventive military action
@JadePinkSameera Thanks for the (mostly) positive review. Appreciate too your taking the time to read the book. Alas, disarray has increased since i wrote it

@heidilegg @kwyzner I discuss considerations surrounding preventive &amp; preemptive strikes in some detail in "A World in Disarray," pp 238-244.
@heidilegg preventive strikes r vs a gathering threat, ie, attacking NK now. Preemptive strikes r taken when an adversary is readying an actual attack
NK showing greater sense of urgency developing its missile capabilities than US is in advancing comprehensive diplomatic initiative/response
pundits confusing preventive (vs gathering threat) &amp; preemptive (vs imminent threat) strikes. only latter has broad legal/diplomatic backing
any new China sanctions need to be blended w consultations on peninsula scenarios &amp; diplomatic initiative that outlines acceptable deal w NK

Truth is Fidel Castro passed from political scene years ago with Cold War's end and his subsequent stepping away from office
Fully expect reactions to death of Fidel Castro to mirror reactions to his life and to his policies on the island and beyond
Latest rupture between illiberal Turkey of Erdogan &amp; EU could end up causing new security woes in both Europe and Syria
Political disarray in South Korea will likely make it far more difficult for US to carry out much-needed tougher policy toward North Korea

Soon joining @Morning_Joe to discuss foreign pol side of debate: russia, mosul, iran, syria. but not N Korea or climate change or much else
Defining feature of american democracy is legitimacy of vote &amp; peaceful transfer of power. World will note that this is no longer a given
@LincolnMitchell fair point.  Climate change missing from all three debates
So much for foreign policy.  Inconclusive exchanges on iraq &amp; syria.  Nothing re china,  N Korea, Ukraine,  Venezuela, pakistan or much else
US had/has options in Syria between doing nothing &amp; ousting Assad. can do many things to protect civilians &amp; provide them places to live
Couldnt follow trump argument re mosul...was he suggesting not retaking it (&amp; allowing Isis to keep it) as iran would benefit?
Supporting allies is not a favor to others or an act of charity; it is an exercise in US self-interest &amp; national security
Focus on how much allies "pay up" for defense exaggerates cost to US, underestimates how US benefits from stability &amp; lack of nuclear spread

Soon to join @Morning_Joe. Don't have to wonder what topic will be. one and only one I expect.
To paraphrase the thane in Shakespeare's Macbeth, nothing became this debate so much as its ending.
Frustrating/disappointing exchange re Syria, as not clear what either candidate would do beyond what Obama administration mostly not doing
Alas, Russia, Syria, &amp; Iran not targeting Isis so much as Sunni rebels who oppose Assad regime.
Debate nearly 2/3 over, &amp; little raised so far to help us evaluate the next commander in chief.  Hope someone asks re N Korea, Syria, China
Much bigger than any threat from Muslims coming in is radicalization of those here. argues for not alienating community &amp; its leaders
.@packers hold ball for 9 min &amp; score TD; @Giants for less than 2 min &amp; punt. Almost enough to make me look forward to start of debate
Busy doing my own debate prep.  Watching first half hour of @giants game. Alas, so far closer to @packers game
Dueling history metaphors. Will tonite be a Richard Nixon Checkers moment? A "Have you no shame?" Joseph Welch moment? We'll know soon enuf
POTUS 43 arguably tried to do too much in world, POTUS 44 too little. #debate2016 may be next to last chance to get better fix on 45.
Also hope candidates asked in #debate2016 their plans for Syria given Russian/Iran presence, unfolding humanitarian/strategic disaster
next POTUS may well face N Korea w nuc warheads on ICBMs able 2 reach US. hope candidates asked in #debate2016 what they plan 2 do about it
@JasonBordoff @RNephewCGEP @Alan_Krueger simple: watch @Giants 830-9; tape game; watch debate; watch game if Giants still in it after 30 min

Good to see specific national security questions (Syria, N Korea) asked.  Good also to see specific follow-ups.
Noteworthy that both VP candidates (unlike Obama administration) favor safe zones in Syria. Next Pres will have opportunity to do just that
Government by referenda a bad idea-but its use will grow if public loses confidence in representative democracy https://t.co/rNhAx91SJa

Inability of Gary Johnson to name 1 world leader he admires, among other things, points to need for US HSs/colleges to teach global literacy

Shimon Peres' vision of regional integration, focus on technology was important voice competing w nationalism/parochialism. Will be missed.
@dansenor Shimon Peres was all that &amp; more. My point simply that many in Israel were more willing to take risks 4 peace under Begin &amp; Rabin.
Shimon Peres great if tragic: never fully bonded w Israeli people, who didn't quite trust his peacemaking, lack of mil experience, erudition
expect non-americans, 96% of world's population, would have found lack of debate focus on world challenges unsettling given unique US role
Would not have predicted debate would come &amp; go with candidates not being asked what they would do about Syria &amp; Aleppo in particular
NAFTA has cost some US jobs, created others, added to US GDP, &amp; created jobs in Mexico, reducing emigration to US. https://t.co/nRa24pB3Xz
Will join @Morning_Joe soon. My sense is HRC gained more from debate than many around table saying. But this election cycle tough to predict
Foreign policy &amp; national security counted for little in tonight's debate.  More about domestic issues and even more debate style.
Debate more than half over, and national security has yet to surface. We are electing next commander in chief, so hope it comes up soon
If debt such a big issue, which it is, would be good to hear candidates discuss entitlements, the biggest driver of existing &amp; future debt
Sad to see golf getting politicized.  Ought to be something that brings Americans together.
TPP would have little effect on US market, which is largely open. But would reduce tariffs around the world. US would be net beneficiary.
Trade pacts have been overall good for US jobs. Biggest challenge is not trade or offshoring but technology/innovation that eliminates jobs

given its global role, US has far more to lose from erosion of sovereign immunity than anyone else; #JASTA veto by POTUS should be upheld
those in congress contemplating overriding veto of S2040-#JASTA-should rethink as will boomerang vs American soldiers, officials, diplomats
amidst all the bad news, a bright spot: today the govt of Colombia &amp; the FARC will sign a pact to end the country's long costy civil war
V sad to hear re Arnold Palmer, one of my 1st heroes. As was said of Ben bradlee, women wanted 2 be with him, men wanted to be him
Watching @60Minutes. What worries me re Russian nukes is that Putin faces fewer internal constraints than Khrushchev during Missile Crisis
To blame UN 4 Syria is, to paraphrase Richard Holbrooke, to blame Madison Sq Garden for Knicks. UN reflects not steers gt power politics
.@60Minutes wrong. In 1990, Jordan King Hussein did not warn Bush 41 to stay out of Iraq. He sided w Saddam &amp; urged US to stay out of Kuwait
The UN is never more than the consensus among the major powers allows it to be. As a result, the UN is now feckless https://t.co/VcV6UXO6aB
biggest ? re Syria is whether Turkey's Erdogan will rethink his opposition 2 Assad &amp; make deal w Russia/Iran &amp; put squeeze on rebels, Kurds
Syrian war not winding down; Russia &amp; Iran standing by Assad while he remains unacceptable to rebels &amp; their backers https://t.co/NbV2AftUnj

Too bad CINC forum never asked HRC &amp; DJT if prepared to tolerate a N Korea w nuc-tipped missiles that could reach US-&amp; if not, then what?
N Korea emerging as most critical test of willingness of China, NK's lifeline, to act as responsible power.  Thus far it has failed to do so

Predict big debate over "government by referendum" post #Brexit. Founding Fathers (who favored representative govt) would not have approved.
Anti-establishment, populist, nationalist views leading to #Brexit parallels rise of Sanders &amp; Trump in US &amp; suggests Nov outcome uncertain
pro-EU stance could fuel Sinn Fein push 4 vote for its stated goal of unity w Ireland. NI stability could be another casualty of #Brexit
Scotland voted heavily against #Brexit. question of when not if a new referendum is put forward &amp; passes, as people will choose EU over UK
If as seems likely #Brexit wins, US will also be a big loser as a weaker UK &amp; a weaker Europe works vs US eco, strategic interests
@GerardAraud absolutely.  US interests would suffer from a poorer, less influential UK &amp; from the prospect of UK, EU unraveling.

question never addressed in Obama's final #SOTU: is world a safer, more stable place today as opposed to 8 years ago? difficult to argue yes
