7/ Dems also picked up 4 AG seats in CO, MI, NV and WI, giving us a majority 27 of the nation’s 51 attorney general offices going into 2020. Just about every legal challenge that has kept Trump in check was brought by one or more state AG office. https://t.co/DmfDOEgs0B
@JodyAlford17 YES! Here is some data on all redistricting challenges brought by the courts and by citizen passed initiatives.	https://t.co/KdrKwLwY7c https://t.co/KRg60trlCO
6/ Newly elected Democratic Secretaries of State in AZ, MI, and CO are poised to have huge impacts on voting rights in those states. 		Expanded voting rights in AZ and MI, in particular, can make a HUGE difference in the 2020 election. #tuesdaythoughts		https://t.co/rx5eBwDKwc
5/ Little discussed are the effects that having a divided state government will have in red &amp; swing states like KS, MI, and WI when it comes time to redistrict for the 2020 election.		Plus: MO and UT passed initiatives taking redistricting out of the hands of state legislatures.
4/ In 2018, Republicans lost four trifectas and Democrats gained six. States that were previously a divided government and became a Democratic trifecta are CO, IL, ME, NM, NY and NV.		KS, MI, WI, and NH were previously Republican trifectas and are now divided governments.
3/ In addition, Democrats netted 300 legislative seats and 7 governorships. Democrats now have full control in 14 states, which will make this year's redistricting efforts more equitable. #tuesdaythoughts #tuesdaymotivation https://t.co/5l1fTd4GF0

@MY_KINDA_SEX_ED @ChelseaClinton Absolutely. I'm one of those people, which is why I encourage everyone who can get the shot to do so: so people like you and I benefit from herd immunity.
@Berndt_LVS @davidmweissman It's a great question!		The CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months of age get the flu shot. Exceptions include people who have compromised immune systems or for whom the flu shot is otherwise contraindicated. https://t.co/OZRIH3ttrl
@opiejeanne @randomlettering In addition to 80k people dying, nearly 1 million people were hospitalized with the flu and 22.7 million took a day off work or school to visit the doctor. That's billions in lost productivity and revenue.
@RichardGillam7 @TReagan15 You can get a free shot at your county health department. Their only ulterior motive is to keep you from dying or infecting others.		Medicare Part B covers the cost of flu shots and most state Medicaid agencies cover the cost of flu shots, too.

Had he just paid Stormy himself, Mr. Trump would have been out of pocket $130,000. Instead, Weisselberg authorized a reimbursement of twice that much, characterized in Mr. Trump’s records as "legal fees", to cover the income tax hit Mr. Cohen would take + $60,000 bonus. https://t.co/EEeaPi4NOW

What did Republicans who voted against that bill say? Did they believe the bill protected Medicaid participants, older Americans, and Americans with pre-existing conditions? 15/

Happily, he has a backup plan to balance the nation’s books on the backs of elderly and poor Mainers, by cutting social security and Medicaid.
