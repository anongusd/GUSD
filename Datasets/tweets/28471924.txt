Q4: What are some ways you can help others who have experienced a crisis on the farm such as flooding, fire, etc? #agchat
@SimAngus2 😱
I think this is important. Having a plan is a good start, but you HAVE to practice and train or else it all goes out the window when there’s a crisis! #agchat https://t.co/BJD48oXACz
@VHsweetpotatoes I was on a bad scene once and the training really kicked in. It’s important to practice and have a plan. I didn’t know the person, so I’m not sure how I would have reacted otherwise. Also hope to never find out. #agchat
@AKientzy Luckily most states have Good Samaritan laws! #agchat
@SimAngus2 You use what you have I guess! Lol

@RedThreadFarms I agree - I learn so much from engaging and reading all the tweets in #AgChat and other great Twitter chats!
Q8 Do you know who to call for help? Besides 911 - who else can you call? Do you have neighbours that would assist you in an emergency on your farm? Do you discuss your farm emergency plan with other members in your local area? #AgChat https://t.co/sJiI5XS7vX
