Democrats must articulate a path forward. Over 20 House Dems joined my resolution calling for an end to 68-year Korean War. We need a consistent vision of restraint and human rights for foreign policy, and a team who can implement those principles through skillful diplomacy.
Consider if @SecDef19 were involved instead of Bolton who killed the progress Perry achieved. Perry was able to negotiate successfully with NK without promising to remove all sanctions. He skillfully focused instead on a peace declaration and assuring NK of no regime change.
Bolton discussed in April 2018 the Libya model for N. Korea, referring to Gaddafi denuclearizing and then being toppled. Trump threatens military action in Venezuela &amp; abandoned Iran deal. These inconsistent and hawkish actions are obstacles for needed confidence building with NK
Despite S. Korea's Pres. Moon Jae-in creating perfect conditions for a breakthrough, Trump leaves Hanoi with no progress. I was rooting for him to succeed for the sake of our nation. But I'm not shocked that Trump - with John Bolton at his side - has failed.

@MaxBoot I am open to a serious discussion. I always affiliated neocon with Bush/Rumsfeld/Cheney...Happy to discuss intervention versus non intervention. I followed you and if you follow back, I can DM. Thanks for the civil back and forth.
@michaeldweiss I appreciate the civil back and forth. I do apologize for the McCarthy analogy a few weeks back and admit I was wrong on that. Your work on Russian interference is serious and I look forward to engaging on that.
@michaeldweiss @NuritBaytch Bosnia was at the peak of our power post the Cold War, and we probably overlearned the lesson from that relatively successful intervention.
@PeterCorless @yottapoint @MaxBoot I think the key is to build a regional coalition or international coalition to prevent genocide. The Kerry framework of working with regional partners to try to get Assad to limit chemical weapons was such an effort that ultimately got UN support.
@michaeldweiss I just did and happy to get together for a conversation to exchange views.
@michaeldweiss @TaurusBone Not a misprint. Just that it could have been better phrased which I take responsibility for. But my point is 21st century.
@TomPaineToday @michaeldweiss Stand corrected! I forgot. You are right
@michaeldweiss Evil dictator.
@TomPaineToday @michaeldweiss Only gone once for record. And we should engage on Fox in my opinion.
@michaeldweiss I would welcome a civil exchange. We share a similar concern for Russian interference and Putin‚Äôs nefarious tactics. I am for greater restraint in foreign interventions and for building and international order through cooperation, diplomacy, &amp; the spread of technology and art.
@yottapoint @MaxBoot They are obviously not the same. Assad was a heinous dictator who killed and expelled millions. But my point is our efforts didn‚Äôt improve the situation. Worth a longer discussion not on twitter
@MaxBoot I appreciate your honesty. I ran the nation‚Äôs first anti Iraq war primary against a Democrat. So I have tried to be consistent. https://t.co/dxvqZ0LjLL
@michaeldweiss Where I do agree with you is on the serious threat of Russian interference. I am working on an oped on what more Silicon Valley can do to guard against this threat. We do have to be clear eyed about Putin‚Äôs disinformation campaigns and his brutal violation of human rights.
@michaeldweiss Saddam was an event dictator. But removing him strengthened Iran. Assad is a murderous dictator. But our feeble arming of the opposition was ineffectual. Instead, we should have focused on regional ceasefires and preventing the chemical attacks. Libya turned into chaos.
@michaeldweiss I would define neoconservatism as a belief that one can promote democracy through military force. The history of that and arming insurgents has not been a success. My belief is to speak out for our values but be cautious in intervention, particularly unilateral.
@michaeldweiss I believe Maduro is an authoritarian dictator who has violated human rights and has a failed policy. I do not think our intervention is likely to make the situation better. It may lead to more chaos and bloodshed. I rather we engage the Pope/Vatican to negotiate new elections.
@michaeldweiss It could have been better worded. I meant 21st century. I have been pretty clear about that in all my public statements. But I take the criticism that could have been better worded and clarified.
@MaxBoot Anyway, I could have phrased the century point better and would welcome a debate on these issues. I read your columns. We come from different perspectives. But I appreciate your honest engagement.
@MaxBoot Our main competition is China. Do you see them fighting wars around the world? We would be far better off investing in our own innovative capabilities...
@MaxBoot But John Q Adams warned that if we seek to intervene we would often make matters worse. Our interventions have led to chaos and more bloodshed. Especially in the Middle East, our FP should be first do no harm.
@MaxBoot There is a reason Dean, Obama, and Bernie had so much traction compared to those you cite. And we still haven‚Äôt learned from our mistake. Look I think Saddam, Assad, Maduro are dictators with awful human rights records. They contradict every American value.
@MaxBoot I think the war in Iraq was one of the greatest mistakes in American history. To paraphrase Napoleon, it was worse than a crime. It was a blunder. That vote in my opinion should be disqualifying in seeking the Presidency, and many political careers were tarnished by it.
@PeterCorless @MaxBoot It would have read better saying for this century. But my public statements are pretty clear that I am taking about the post Iraq era of American foreign policy
@MaxBoot Do you defend Iraq? Do you defend Afghan expansion? Do you defend our role in Libya? Do you defend our feeble attempts to arm the opposition in Syria? Do you see these as blunders now?
@MaxBoot I meant the 21st century. Not sure if it was through the edits. But I have been consistent of talking about the neocon thinking that led to the Iraq blunder and what followed.
@MaxBoot It means this century ‚Äî21st. Iraq, Libya, expansion in Afghanistan to take on the Taliban, Yemen. The belief that America should use force to topple regimes as opposed to heeding the advice of John Q Adams. Do you defend any of the above interventions?
The truth is that Americans on both sides of the aisle support @BernieSanders‚Äô platform:		üè• 70% support Medicare for all	üéì 60% support debt-free public college	‚òÄÔ∏è 81% support the Green New Deal	üìà 55% support raising the minimum wage to $15/hr		#BernieTownHall #SandersTownHall

Environmental policy is economic policy, because confronting the climate crisis requires large-scale solutions.		Retrofitting buildings, upgrading and expanding public transportation, and building a massive clean energy system would create millions of jobs across this country.

3/6) Obama refused to send lethal arms to Ukraine--Trump sent them. Reagan worked with Gorbachev to negotiate the unprecedented Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty--Trump unilaterally withdrew and pledged to build more "usable" nuclear weapons.
2/6) Despite the serious Russia investigation, I was among those who hoped for diplomatic progress on issues of mutual interest to our nations. But now the reality is that, despite his rhetoric, Trump is substantively more hawkish on Russia than Obama or even Reagan.
1/6) I am alarmed that President Trump is withdrawing from the INF treaty with Russia. This action plunges us back into a nuclear arms race and endangers our troops, allies, &amp; the world, while wasting taxpayer dollars to prepare for a nuclear war that must never be fought.

This bill isn‚Äôt perfect. No legislation is. But it speaks to the injustice people perceive ‚Äîthat the market isn‚Äôt properly rewarding work. The bill can be further tweaked so corporations pay a decent wage &amp; instead of just compensating those with fancy titles or degrees.
A lot of Americans are struggling. They read about trillion dollar valuations and they don‚Äôt get it. When they are working hard, why can‚Äôt they have a part ‚Äîa small part ‚Äîof that success. We can provide new opportunities for their kids. But we also have to do something for them.
Right now many Americans can‚Äôt pay the bills. They are struggling under tough working conditions. I met someone today who said an extra $3,000 a year would be like Christmas for her. Another person talked about having two miscarriages at work b/c of conditions.
Is that the whole answer ‚Äîbad corporate actors. No, absolutely not. No one is suggesting that. We need to prepare folks for new jobs and invest in communities left behind. We need to offer better pathways to high skill, high wage work. But that‚Äôs long term...
Here‚Äôs the point. We have had stagnant wages for four decades. It‚Äôs partly why Trump was elected. He‚Äôs blaming immigrants and foreign nations. Certainly, blaming the corporate structure seems more appropriate.
Also, you could exempt employers from the tax if they hit a threshold livable wage ‚Äîsay $15/hr. That‚Äôs the equivalent of $5 day that Ford paid in 1914. If that were the case, it would be cheaper to raise the wage than pay tax.
Obviously the bill would need a very strong anti discrimination provision to address concerns. Bigger issue is incentivizing automation. But in the short run you are getting help to workers who are struggling.
I have proposed a massive EITC and obviously raising the minimum wage would help. But a bill like this can through public pressure incentivize more companies to do what Henry Ford did in 1914 in doubling wages.

@KerriCondley @SteveSchmidtSES @Ocasio2018 Thanks. Civil disagreement on issues (please see our back and forth) is different than divisiveness.
I‚Äôm so horrified to hear the news about the shooting at the Capital Gazette offices in Annapolis, MD. My heart is with the staff, their families, and the first responders on the scene.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich @genebsperling @LHSummers @econjared @IndivarD I‚Äôd welcome an honest debate about economic policy anytime with you! I appreciate your civility. I believe we can reconcile progresive economic policies with my district (Silicon Valley) which produces more wealth than some nations! Look fwd to hearing...
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich @genebsperling @LHSummers @econjared @IndivarD The bottom line is the Dems have a far better shot of getting to 3-4 percent growth by reducing health care costs, investing in human capital, and increasing consumer demand. We also will reduce deficits by ending interventionism and tax breaks for the rich.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich @genebsperling @LHSummers @econjared @IndivarD A Medicare for all plan will allow people to opt into a Medicare plan of their choice and reduces the pharma, insurance, and hospital costs. It‚Äôs pro growth!
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich @genebsperling @LHSummers @econjared @IndivarD In terms of Medicare for All, it would cost $32 trillion. The current healthcare system costs $49 trillion. So there would be a saving of $17 trillion in lower premiums, cheaper drugs, &amp; less hospital costs. The problem with American healthcare is the rising costs!

I support TechHire and Obama‚Äôs effort to help bring the jobs of the future to communities across America. Trump is selling the past. We can sell the future.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich @genebsperling @LHSummers @econjared @IndivarD I agree with you that we need government that is efficient and works. That‚Äôs why I have said to involve private industry in apprenticeships for the jobs of the future and in credentializing. Let‚Äôs get tech to places across America that are left behind.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown @RBReich In terms of subsidized employment, even folks like @genebsperling @LHSummers are for it in places left behind. Germany &amp; Denmark have done it. It gets people a job and they can get a credential in a high growth area. It was part of the stimulus that worked! @econjared @IndivarD
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown You can make college tuition free partly with a small financial transaction tax on speculation (its done largely by computers). Also @RBReich talks about a fund which you can pay back into if you get a high paying job post college.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown We spent over $2 trillion on unnecessary wars. Let‚Äôs get out of Afghanistan. We shouldn‚Äôt have been in Iraq. We don‚Äôt need $81 billion in new defense spending. Invest that instead in creating tech institutes across America, in making college tuition free.
@SteveSchmidtSES @SherrodBrown and I have a proposal that would give every working family making up to $75,000 a raise of up to $6,000 to $8,000. At a time when 81 percent of Americans have seen income stagnate, that would do more for growth than tax cuts to investors and executives.
@SteveSchmidtSES McKinsey &amp; Bain both have reports saying the constraint on our economic growth is income inequality because we lack consumer demand. Put simply, people aren‚Äôt making enough to buy things. So what we need instead of tax cuts for the investor class is to expand the EITC.
@SteveSchmidtSES 1/1) Thanks for engaging @SteveSchmidtSES with civility. Happy to debate you on economic policy on MSNBC or in a policy forum in a civil way.	What do you think? Here‚Äôs my response on twitter in the meantime.

No family should ever be forced to choose between putting food on the table or paying for their child to go to get an education. This is the 21st century. Education is a basic human right!
Across the globe, America is ranked 14th in education, 50th in health care efficiency, and 1st in military spending. 		Meanwhile, an average family makes less money today than they were in the year 2000. 		It‚Äôs time to get our priorities straight!

Five years ago, Walmart refused to pay their workers a living wage, and as a result, cost taxpayers $6.2 billion for expenses like food stamps and housing assistance. Now, they‚Äôre giving shareholders a $20 billion raise. https://t.co/znGhA9Fp4v
I'm proud of the millions of people who fought to #KeepFamiliesTogether. It's proof that we can make change if we work together. But this is no time for complacency! The Trump Administration's stance on immigration is still appalling and immoral, and we have more work to do.
2018 must be the year that we push for real criminal justice reform:	‚úîÔ∏è End the cash bail system	‚úîÔ∏è Stop mass incarceration	‚úîÔ∏è Legalize marijuana 	‚úîÔ∏è Replace the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù with harm reduction and rehabilitation
There are too many areas across this country which are filled with knowledge and talent but have not seen the gains of America‚Äôs tech-driven innovation. Our vision for prosperity must include every community, from Appalachia to the Bay Area.
Trump's executive order will still result in humans being locked behind bars. I'm glad these children will no longer be torn from their parents' arms, but this is "solution" doesn't come close to fixing the problem. We demand more! https://t.co/zf97aVuXox
I'm so inspired by the work that groups like @UnitedWeDream do to #KeepFamiliesTogether. Trump's reversal is proof that we can win, but we can't let up now. Please support their efforts so we can put an end to this barbaric treatment of immigrants. https://t.co/y16yiBLFBW
Let's be clear: putting human beings into cages is still cruel and unconstitutional. Trump's announcement doesn't change that. We need real, humane immigration reform, where people are given a pathway to citizenship, not a prison cell for seeking asylum.
Never forget: Betsy DeVos once said that schools should report children to ICE and have them locked up or taken from their families. It‚Äôs obscene.  EVERY child in this country should have a right to an education, regardless of their immigration status.  https://t.co/jlPVNbaShm
While tirelessly-working families can barely make ends meet, powerful corporations exploit our tax rules. Some pay no taxes at all; others get massive refunds. If a family making $45,000 is required to pay taxes, so should massive multi-billion dollar companies.

Why is universal healthcare too expensive for the United States, when every other industrialized country on earth can guarantee healthcare to every person?

Legalizing recreational marijuana across the United States would raise $7 billion in taxes per year. The Republicans who say that America is ‚Äúbroke‚Äù when talking about healthcare and education should get behind the #MarijuanaJusticeAct.

Citizens United allows billionaires and corporations to buy elections. It is an awful decision, and one that must be repealed.
It‚Äôs a national disgrace that millions of Americans lack access to affordable housing, food, and healthcare. Instead of giving more tax breaks to the billionaire class, we should focus on ending extreme poverty in America.

@BurgSkeletal @ActifyMG @KyleKulinski I appreciate that. When JD endorsed I committed to all the platform principles but not to endorse the slate.  Respect you think I made the wrong call here. But I do want to evaluate each campaign individually.
@adrielhampton @JoeCrowleyNY Actually the quote was given months ago. I visited Crowley district for an event months ago. It‚Äôs a matter of public record. Respect your disagreement. Just want to get facts out.
@michaelshure @7_deuce I won‚Äôt always get the balance right. But hope folks might appreciate my trying to be true to my ideals and still work to bring change within Congress. Ultimately it‚Äôs for every person to decide whether I succeeded or not.
@michaelshure @7_deuce Perhaps, they will think I made the wrong call. And I certainly would never compromise my ideals on a vote or in a platform. I‚Äôm the only sitting incumbent who has said primary challenges are a good thing. My sense is building a coalition for progressive policies is complex...
Prescription drug prices aren‚Äôt higher in America because people in other countries pay less. They are higher because of extended patent protections, lack of government oversight and bargaining power, and a lack of competition.
@michaelshure @7_deuce My goal has been to get the Dem caucus to support 1) no more bad wars, 2) a real jobs plan, 3) higher wages thru EITC. Crowley has helped. Ms. Octavio is inspiring and has a bolder progressive vision. I can see why people are drawn to her. I just ask they see my considerations.

@mattmungan @PettersonAdam @nickolaslangley @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley My goal is to build support for progressive legislation in the House and Joe was helpful. That‚Äôs why the statement was true. But I also have said Ms. Ocasio is running an inspiring campaign on bold issues.
@kburton40 @ActifyMG @KyleKulinski @Ocasio2018 I supported Bernie in 2016 and called for him to run in 2020. I have praised Ms. Ocasio‚Äôs campaign since I saw the viral video. Saying that Joe helped me build support for progressive legislation I did with Barbara Lee is being honest abt why I supported him.
@ActifyMG @KyleKulinski I didn‚Äôt know much about her candidacy. Her inspiring video went viral a few weeks ago. I think she‚Äôs a terrific candidate. Joe has been helpful in my progressive legislative ideas. I have been transparent of my decision. Lesson learned
@KenAull Fair enough. In the future I will be more diligent on researching all the candidates and soliciting input. A year ago no one would have cared who I endorsed! I get there is a responsibility.
@Mikeyseuro @PettersonAdam @efonekpo @kbanis14 @sa311816 @whitmire2018 @JoeCrowleyNY @Ocasio2018 I hope folks will look at my ideals and policy beliefs. To end our military interventionism. To have a real jobs plan. To raise wages. How to build a coalition to get there is something I‚Äôm learning ‚Äîthe balance between being in the system and critiquing it. Learning experience
@PettersonAdam @Mikeyseuro @efonekpo @kbanis14 @sa311816 @whitmire2018 @JoeCrowleyNY @Ocasio2018 I get the criticism. I accept it and that people were let down. I have tried to answer honestly. I am a policy nerd at heart. I want support for my jobs bill, EITC expansion, FP. Joe has been helpful on that this term.
@ryangrim Ha! Humor is the saving grace in politics.
@KenAull I have tried to be transparent. Joe was helpful on building support for Medicare for All and legalizing marijuana. I didn‚Äôt know much about his opponent. She has run an inspiring race.
@PettersonAdam @efonekpo @kbanis14 @sa311816 @whitmire2018 @JoeCrowleyNY @Ocasio2018 Well I did endorse Bernie. Disagreed with her foreign policy and supported Bernie on Medicare for all
A new poll finds that few Americans believe that these steel and aluminum tariffs will help the economy and 59 percent believe it will lead to even higher prices for materials.		You can‚Äôt fool the American people: nobody wins a trade war.

@TherealdoctorA @jaydesh7 @KyleKulinski No check our FEC or open secrets. He sent check. We never cashed.
@HumanistReport I have great respect for @HumanistReport.  He explained to me why folks were let down by this decision in the progressive community. I apologize. I will learn from this for future endorsements. Hope over the years to earn people‚Äôs trust based on my FP &amp; economic positions.
@jaydesh7 @KyleKulinski I appreciate that. Just for the record we never accepted any money from him.
@KyleKulinski Sorry on this. Hope folks will judge me on the totality of the record. I have tremendous respect for you, so apologize for letting you down on this.
Starting a trade war with our allies will only make a financial crisis even more likely. If we really want to help American workers we should be raising their wages and making sure that everyone has basic healthcare, education, and a meaningful career.
@sa311816 @whitmire2018 @JoeCrowleyNY @Ocasio2018 I am not opposed to the primary challenge at all, and have said that these types of challenges make the party stronger! I have explained my reason for giving a quote for Crowley.
We can afford Medicare for all.		We can afford debt-free public colleges and universities.		We can afford to provide job opportunities for every American. 		We can afford to fix our crumbling infrastructure.		We just choose to spend that money on our military interventions.

@TheWayWithAnoa @justicedems @Ocasio2018 1) My point is that Pocan, Waters, &amp; I provided a quote supporting Crowley‚Äôs work with progressives. I stand by that statement as he has engaged on building support for Medicare for All &amp; getting support for Barbara and my bill on legalization.

@leahmcelrath @jjz1600 Restraint should be an obvious position given the blunders of our recent wars. They have cost us over $5.6 trillion, and terrorism has spread around the world since 2001. Isn‚Äôt it time we realize that these interventions have not made us safer and are hurting our credibility?
@leahmcelrath @jjz1600 John Q Adams said we should offer our prayers and hopes to those who love freedom and human rights around the world.  But we should be wary of military intervention, lest we be seen not as a liberating force but as a dictatorial force. He advocated restraint
@leahmcelrath @jjz1600 We should look to prosecute Assad for war crimes, and we should engage with regional players &amp; with the UN when international action is required. We don‚Äôt have the credibility to undertake military interventions with only a few allies when our own homeland hasn‚Äôt been attacked.
@leahmcelrath @jjz1600 The Iraq war was a strategic blunder. As was the call for regime change in Libya, in Syria, in Ukraine. Assad is a war criminal. But we need regional cease fires in the region. When taking military action, we should have Congressional authorization unless imminent threat.
@leahmcelrath @jjz1600 In a situation of crimes against humanity, we should assemble an international coalition and seek to prosecute for war crimes. Military action should be a last resort, debated in Congress, and in a humanitarian context, through a multilateral effort.

We should engage in humanitarian aid, supporting education, &amp; advocating for our values. We should engage economically and culturally...

There were 26 debates during the last presidential election, but how much time was spent on systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, and militarism?		Almost none.		The #PoorPeoplesCampaign is breaking the silence.	https://t.co/yp6mUPHbnz

The new estimated death toll from Hurricane Maria underscores the catastrophic damage that‚Äôs been done to Puerto Rico. We must do more to help our fellow Americans recover with public investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
Illinois has just become the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. At a time when women are under attack, it‚Äôs important than we codify equal rights for women into our constitution. We are now only one state away.

Today‚Äôs Supreme Court decision wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúreligious liberty.‚Äù It was about allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans just because of who they love and identify as. We must continue to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance.
This shouldn‚Äôt be happening in a country with as much wealth as the United States. I will keep fighting to guarantee healthcare to every American from the day they are born. https://t.co/9DxmTOvjtW
Amazon claims that they deserve huge tax breaks and subsidies because they are ‚Äújob creators.‚Äù		There‚Äôs just one problem: Warehouse workers in communities with Amazon fulfillment centers actually earn 10 percent less than in other areas of the country.		https://t.co/Qbu4tVTvoW
I'm glad that @KeithEllison is asking these important questions. The innovation and prosperity of Silicon Valley must include safe workplaces and the ability for every worker to organize unions free from intimidation. https://t.co/5uJszYPsZT
The next time an executive at Mcdonalds or Walmart says that they can‚Äôt afford to pay their workers more, ask them why their CEOs are paid over 1000 times as much as the median employee.
The birthrate is at record lows because many millennials are drowning in debt and having children is simply too expensive in this country. We must push for Medicare for all, paid family leave and affordable childcare for every American. https://t.co/CXUVz9m7si
Proud to endorse @AndrewGillum for Governor of Florida. He‚Äôs an unapologetic progressive! He wants to give every teacher a pay raise, legalize marijuana, have corporations pay tax on overseas earning, and pass common sense gun laws. He represents the next gen of Dem leaders.
Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit coupled with a $15 per hour federal minimum wage will finally give the American people the raises they deserve. https://t.co/yQCBN5pxZB
Extraordinarily proud of the grassrooots and progressive campaign that @CathyGlasson is running! https://t.co/lTGLuHTG8h
Some of the same members of Congress who say that Medicare for all is too expensive had no problem voting for yet another massive increase in military spending. We have to start putting American lives over barrels of oil and fighter jets.
Last week, the House approved $717 billion in defense spending to ‚Äúrebuild our military,‚Äù even though we already spend more than the next seven countries combined. Instead, we should focus on rebuilding our infrastructure, our schools and our healthcare system. https://t.co/HRS0QJCeCU
Arkansas‚Äôs banning of medication abortion could leave only ONE clinic in Little Rock to serve the entire state. If that‚Äôs not an undue burden, then what is? The Supreme Court made a huge a mistake by not taking up this case. https://t.co/zwouVrqhaR
Purdue Pharma knew that OxyContin pills were being crushed and snorted and stolen from pharmacies.		They continued to promote the drug as less addictive.		The executives in charge should be held fully accountable for fueling the deadly opioid crisis.		https://t.co/2ThloXyvVf
For #PrideMonth, we honor Harvey Milk, Marsha P. Johnson and all those who fought so tirelessly for LGBTQ+ rights. All the progress this country has made is due to their hard work.
The economy has recovered, but the question is: for who? Millions of Americans are still unable to save enough to cover basic emergencies. That‚Äôs why we need to expand the EITC, push for a $15/hour federal minimum wage, and make it easier for every worker to join a union. https://t.co/28pgkMSwbD
Happy #PrideMonth! Today and everyday we should celebrate the accomplishments of LGBTQ+ Americans and continue fighting for equal rights and an end to discrimination.

A teacher, in tears, shared she had over $210,000 in student debt &amp; on her salary couldn‚Äôt live in Fremont. Saez concludes that a standout kindergarten teacher is worth $320,000 b/c of an increase in a student‚Äôs lifetime earning. Pay teachers more! https://t.co/eVsXC7y5xX

These heavy rains and catastrophic flood events will only become more costly and more deadly over time. Instead of waiting until after a major storm to react, we have to be proactive and build an infrastructure that is resilient for years to come. https://t.co/QJiZTnHDAx
When 81 percent of this country hasn‚Äôt had a raise for the past 15 years, do we need to have more policies favoring corporations and executives? NO! We have to push for strong unions to make sure everyone is fairly represented in the workplace.

Dems are the party of the future. Republicans are for clinging to the past. That‚Äôs the message. All our policies ‚Äî jobs for all, health care for all, no more bad wars, gun safety, investing in education, tackling climate change, is about positioning America for the 2030/40s.

When one child can do their homework at home &amp; another has to go to the library &amp; wait for a computer because their family can‚Äôt afford the internet, that is like ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù for the digital age. Let's end the digital divide with a public option for high-speed internet.
Trump‚Äôs suggestion that immigration courts and judges should be eliminated is dangerous, unconstitutional, and a violation of international law. Everyone must be afforded the right to due process.
The tech industry has accomplished so much, but the question is: who is being left out? Economic opportunity is far too often determined by geography &amp; race. Tech companies must do better at making sure the prosperity of our tech-driven future is accessible to every American.
The Democratic governor of Louisiana just signed one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country. A clear violation of Roe vs. Wade. We should be the party that unequivocally protects women‚Äôs reproductive health. https://t.co/PG43TXD4f0
How would corporate tax breaks ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù to the middle and working class when median employees at many companies already have to work over 1000 years to make what the CEO earns in just one? We have to invest directly in the workers. https://t.co/7okGC8BM67
@ThatchThompson @PeterHamby What would you like to see Democrats do?
We need to capture the imagination of Americans away from Trump. One possibility is to talk about bringing the future &amp; new jobs to communities left behind. Trump‚Äôs nostalgia then would be like black and white TV. @PeterHamby  https://t.co/XFZeGjiAjO
Ripping children away from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border won‚Äôt discourage immigration. It will only destroy families who are seeking asylum and traumatize children. We should be helping these families, not separating them. #EndFamilySeparation

After Hurricane Maria, Trump kept saying that ‚ÄúWe have done a great job in Puerto Rico.‚Äù		The longest blackout in U.S. history.		Over 4,600 people dead.		One of the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history		This is not a great job. It‚Äôs an absolute disaster.
These are the stories of some of the #4645boricuas who lost their lives after Hurricane Maria. Most of these deaths were entirely preventable. Our government has failed Puerto Rico. https://t.co/ocBIGWY9Jz
The last time the federal minimum wage was raised in 2007, it didn't include tipped workers. The wage for these workers has remained at $2.13 since 1991.		Employees shouldn‚Äôt have to depend on tips to make ends meet. 		We must #RaiseTheWage to $15/hour for EVERY employee.
@wizgicianbrb @KateAronoff Companies would be limited to 15 employees. Many would be subsidies for union apprenticeships and wrap around services for the unemployed.
In 1975, Reginald Jones made $500,000 at G.E., 36 times the average worker. Today, the top 200 CEOs have a median pay of $17.5 million, 275 times workers. Does anyone believe today‚Äôs top CEOs are SO much more talented than Reginald Jones? Give me a break. https://t.co/2UJtp7j50h
@zapradon @KateAronoff This is not a compromise as much as a plan to provide job opportunities and choice both in the public sector and private sector (especially union jobs). I admire very much Hamilton and Darrity‚Äôs work.
@wizgicianbrb @KateAronoff I wanted to have a program that also includes many unions for private sector jobs including electricians, painters, drywallers, and also for those in small business. I support the federal public option but feel we have to provide a choice for work in the private sector also.
@mucha_carlos @RaulACarrillo @DarrickHamilton Thanks. We limit it to 15 employees and I wanted to include private unions (electricians, painters, glazers) and also small businesses. I admire Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity‚Äôs work.

President Trump has claimed repeatedly that ‚Äúnobody cares about DACA more than him.‚Äù If he really cared about the welfare of these young immigrants, why does he keep using them as bargaining chips for his costly and completely unnecessary wall?
It‚Äôs totally unacceptable for the United States to be involved in torture, whether directly or through our allies. We need a full, transparent investigation into the role that UAE played in these prisons and if Americans were involved in these war crimes. https://t.co/E0cDtd5iGn
Unions are the counterweight to corporate power. That‚Äôs why billionaires, conservative think tanks, and corporations are using Janus vs. AFSCME to destroy the right of American workers to organize for living wages and better working conditions. We can‚Äôt let them win.
Scott‚Äôs story happens all too often in America. You go to an in-network hospital, but then if a surgeon or anesthesiologist is out of network, you are left with a huge medical bill. Our healthcare system is broken. Medicare for all is the solution. https://t.co/TM0CUMITJE

@B_S_runrunrun @A1exCunningham @NomikiKonst @TheYoungTurks Please look at all the bills I have cosponsored on withholding federal funding unless drastic reforms on police brutality.
In 1980, Pell Grants covered 77 percent of the cost of a four-year public college degree. Today, they cover less than a third, forcing many students to take out loans to cover the difference. Let's end this problem by fighting for debt-free public college in every community.
@banditelli @NomikiKonst @TheYoungTurks Pelosi will be speaker if we win the house. The challenge for progressives is to rally around a more progressive successor in the future for the leadership team. Marc Pocan? Keith Ellison?

The unemployment rate might be only 3.9 percent but a new survey from the St. Louis Fed finds that 4 in 10 Americans are unable to cover an unexpected expense of $400 or more without borrowing. That's why I'm pushing for a massive expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
