RT @HousingReporter: Positive home sales trend continues http://bit.ly/5zRqAR
put the property on a self directed IRA, rent it out and you have just made passive income
take that same amount of money you put in the bank, buy a foreclosed property from the bank at about a 50% discount
take a real good look because at these numbers because that is what you can expect to retire on, unless you plan today
you put your hard earned money in these banks get back maybe 2% interest
So every house that goes into foreclosure you multiply the the amount x7 and you will get the real picture on the banking
Just know that the banks do not have money to loan, for every dollar they loan they must have 7 dollars in reserve

By thought,the thing you want is brought to you;by action you receive it.
Man must not only think, but his personal action must supplement his thought.

See what you want and get a clear mental picture of it as you wish it to look when you get it!!!
You must form a clear and definite mental picture of what you want.
The Creative power within us makes us into the image of that to which we give our attention.
Thought is the only power which can produce tangible Riches.
No one is kept in poverty by a shortness in the supply of Riches; there is more than enough for all.
If what you are doing makes you unhappy, and you keep doing it, you will never be happy!!!
At different periods the tide of opportunity  sets in different directions, we must adjust and take  action!!
Once these laws are learned and obeyed by any person,they will get rich with mathematical certainty
There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring Riches;
Ordinary people require a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness
"If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?"
To the men and women who have served and are currently serving around the world: Thank You.

Do all that you can @TheResident #you have my Vote Lori
The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living "Is Rich"
Put poverty behind you, and put all that pertains to it behind you, Get Rich; that is the best way you can help the poor
If anybody in your town can get rich, so can you;If anybody in your state can get rich, So CAN YOU!!!
Desire is possibility seeking expression, or function seeking performance.
The Desire for riches is really, The desire for a richer,fuller, and more abundant life
