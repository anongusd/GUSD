Did you know		Under Obama there was a North Korean missle launch on average every 24 days		Under Trump there hasn‚Äôt been a missile launch in 457 days		One of these men deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, the other should be investigated for selling our country out to the Iranian regime
This last year @RealCandaceO and I were not allowed to speak at @DePaulU and @Cornell because of our conservative beliefs		Thanks to Trump and the new executive order around free speech these intolerant islands of totalitarianism will have to reform their policies or lose money!
Allan Jacob Anaya is why we need to fully fund ICE and FINISH THE WALL		He is responsible for the death of Tennessee mother Shirra Branum in 2017		He was driving drunk		This was his FOURTH DUI but local sheriffs refused to cooperate with ICE		How many more Americans have to die?
How could Democrats not think there is a crisis on the Southern Border?		Last year alone, 521,000 illegal aliens were apprehended		Around 2,000 arrests of illegals are happening EVERY SINGLE DAY		The U.S. can‚Äôt sustain this lawlessness		It‚Äôs time to Finish The WALL!
Socialist fail:		Ocasio-Cortez Hit With Complaint Alleging She Laundered Money To Boyfriend		The socialist from New York not only killed 25,000 jobs for her constituents she is now accused of breaking the law		Where is the media?		ü§î
President Trump is the first leader in American history to be attacked by the media for actually doing what he said he was going to do
This man is saving western civilization		He loves his country with all of his heart, fighting hourly to save it from evil within and outside America		He relentlessly fights for our citizens, borders, and values		Without him, we would be lost		God Bless Donald Trump https://t.co/gKQ1aQqPfZ
Today our amazing President committed to signing an executive order that would withhold funding from all college and universities that don't abide by the first amendment		Trump again fights for freedoms that no other has before him!		We at @TPUSA FULLY APPROVE!		God Bless Trump
Planned Parenthood has been caught:		Aiding and abetting sex traffickers		Selling body parts of aborted babies 		Covering up sexual abuse of minors 		Why are we still giving them $500 MILLION dollars in taxpayer money each year?		ü§î

Harvard/Harris Poll: 		3-in-4 Voters Favor ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô Immigration, Trade, War Platform from Candidates		Trump‚Äôs agenda is resonating with voters all across the country		He will convincingly win re-election!
After two years of baseless witch hunts and expensive investigations the only thing we know for certain is that Obama promised Russia flexibility after his election and Hillary sold our uranium in exchange for cash to her foundation 		The Democrats colluded with Russia
Fact:		31% of women &amp; 17% of men making the dangerous journey to the United States‚Äô Southern Border are sexually assaulted		Democrats fight so hard to put the interests of illegal immigrants over American citizens		I wonder why they don‚Äôt care about this vicious statistic?		ü§î
.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs economy: Median income for Hispanic households grew by 3.7% in 2017 and continues to rise. 3.7% is more than DOUBLE the increase seen by all households		Obama economy: Hispanic incomes stayed stagnant		Which President is better for the Hispanic community?		ü§î
Facts:		Since President Trump took office almost 5 million jobs have been created		The economy added 304,000 jobs in January		Jobless claims sunk 23,000		For the 1st time in 10+ years wage growth broke 3% in 2018		Why would anyone vote for a Democrat to reverse all of this?		ü§î
Why is no asking questions about Schiff and his staff having contact with Michael Cohen prior to his testimony?		How long did they meet? What did they discuss? Was this legal?		Isn‚Äôt this witness tampering?		Lots of questions that need answers!!
Horrible week for Democrats:		All 6 of their Senators running for President voted against protecting newborn babies who survive abortions		Their ‚Äústar witness‚Äù told multiple lies in front of Congress and further perjured himself		Trump continues to climb in the polls
Why did @BernieSanders hire an illegal alien as a press secretary for his campaign for President of the UNITED STATES?		Democrats are flaunting their lawlessness		Maybe the real reason they want to abolish ICE is to keep them from deporting members of their campaign staff		ü§î
It is totally unfair to women athletes to have men who think they are women compete against them		Where are the feminists on this?		The International Olympic Committee just said they will allow men who think they are women compete against biological women		This is a disgrace
I believe we should have an investigation into every multimillionaire in Congress who has accumulated that wealth on a Congressional salary using our tax dollars
Did you know:		ICE just discovered 67 illegal aliens, including 6 unaccompanied teens, in deplorable conditions in a shed in NM		This is a emergency!
This one is for you @JussieSmollett https://t.co/T97BGhJVFo

Did you know:		A panel of federal judges dismissed ALL 83 ethics complaints leveled against JUSTICE Kavanaugh		The Democrat hit job against an honorable man failed miserably

BREAKING:		17 states give @realDonaldTrump 50% or higher ratings for 2018‚Äîup from 12 states in 2017		17 states give him 40-49% approval		Imagine having Democrats &amp; media working against you 24/7 and still finding a way to win for America		Thank you, Mr. President. Keep fighting
Imagine a country where there was so little actual racism, hate, and random violence to where someone has to fake a hate crime just to try and incriminate Conservatives		That‚Äôs the state of American politics today
I remember thousands of people wearing Obama shirts &amp; hats after his election in 2008		I do NOT remember constantly hearing about those people being:		Attacked		Verbally abused		&amp; Denied service		For supporting the President		The Left hates the idea that there are other ideas
The two choices for the future of America has never been more clear		Only one side supports post birth abortion of newborns		Only one side openly stands against Israel		Only one side embraces socialism		Only one side hates America		Only one side has ruined our inner cities
For all the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù attacking Trump I‚Äôm trying to remember if Obama ever got North Korea to suspend missile tests or travel 40+ hours (twice) to broker peace  the pundits thought was impossible or get our hostages back?		ü§î
This is Riley Heath		He goes to Princeton		He was assaulted by a socialist on campus last month		You can see the scar on the face		He reported this to police and the university &amp; nothing was done		Another crime of violence against conservative Trump supporters		RT this injustice! https://t.co/EhmxtHJlGd
So tired of hearing the question:		‚ÄúHow and when did the Democrats get so radical?‚Äù		Answer:		They have always been this way		Trump successfully made their radicalism and hatred of our country and values come out in bright colors		They haven‚Äôt changed, they have been revealed
If Republicans had Obama‚Äôs former lawyer testify when he was trying to dismantle nuclear proliferation the media would be outraged		Oh wait, Obama didn‚Äôt do anything to correct or fix North Korea in fact he made things worse and now Trump is fixing it
Michael Cohen hearing so far:		Cohen admitted there is no evidence of Russian collusion		Cohen also admitted he colluded with Democrat Reps. Adam Schiff &amp; Elijah Cummings before his testimony		This hearing is nothing more than a Democrat hit job against a successful President
Democrats holding a hearing with convicted liar Michael Cohen while @realDonaldTrump is in Vietnam negotiating peace with North Korea tells you everything you need to know about the left		They would rather see America fail than see Donald Trump succeed.
Wait a minute, Michael Cohen is going to jail for lying to Congress and now we are supposed to believe what he is about to say in front of Congress?		ü§î
Biological males who think they are girls should not be allowed to compete in sports against actual biological girls
The same Democrats that are screaming about mothers being separated from their kids at the border seem perfectly fine with babies being killed in case of a botched abortion
‚ÄúUnplanned‚Äù a new movie about a abortion doctor who leaves Planned Parenthood with regrets and realization got a ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating		Essentially, it is easier in some states to get an abortion under the age of 18 without permission from your parents than to see a movie about abortion
I‚Äôm seriously wondering how anyone with a moral compass could support ending a child‚Äôs life if the baby survives an abortion
I‚Äôm so confused how liberals can march in the streets to make sure hardend murderers don‚Äôt get the death penalty yet seem perfectly fine with newborn children being killed if they survive an abortion
This is your daily reminder that every Democrat Senator running for President didn‚Äôt vote for protections of newborn children who survive abortions

Wait a minute, the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù who never made any progress getting our hostages back, denuclearizing North Korea, or even setting up a a meeting are now challenging @realDonaldTrump who has brought us closer to permanent peace than any other President since the Korean War?		ü§î

In order to get rich in a capitalist country you must have a good idea, work hard, treat people well, and create value 		In order to get rich in a socialist country you have to be well connected, know the right politicians, and lie your way to the top
One of the greatest threats to America is the fact that our school system is not teaching the next generation morals, American exceptionalism, free enterprise, the constitution, the dangers of socialism, or the value of hard work

RT @DonaldJTrumpJr: I think @RepLeeZeldin is talking about you, Rashida ‚ÄúDual Loyalty‚Äù Tlaib and you, Ilhan ‚ÄúIsrael has hypnotized the worl‚Ä¶
Pelosi is losing the shutdown and she knows that if Trump gets a chance to present the facts center stage during the State of the Union she will have more defections within her own party and continue to lose favor with the American people - @realDonaldTrump give the speech!
Fact:		According to NAS the cost of each illegal border-crosser is is $74,722		If a Wall stopped anywhere between 160,000-200,000 illegals, meaning if it were only 9-12% effective‚Äîit would save the taxpayer 12 to 15 BILLION dollars		The Wall pays for itself‚Äîbuild it NOW
Hypocrisy:		The same Democrats who shut the government down in 2018 over DACA protections are now refusing to reopen the government when the President offers DACA protections		Democrats don‚Äôt care about people, they only care about power
If Mueller is able to debunk a fake story in 24 hours or less then they should be ready to release a statement that President Trump did not collude with Russia		Time to end this investigation!
CNN has STILL not deleted this tweet slandering a 16 year old minor https://t.co/dw883ZcMLs
The media hates @realDonaldTrump so much they happily and intentionally tried to publicly destroy a 15 year old kid for doing absolutely nothing wrong		Don‚Äôt let them get away with this
I hope Covington parents are preparing to sue the media for hundreds of millions of dollars		Sue for slander, for attacking minors, and intentionally trying to destroy lives		Go after them all
Every member of Congress should forego their paycheck until the government is reopened
Hey @cnn do you still stand with @Bakari_Sellers for calling for a 15 year old to be punched in the face?
With the 150 BILLION dollars  Barack Obama and Democrats gave to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, we could have funded the wall 30 times over		But Democrats would rather fund our enemies than keep America safe
Convington High School is now closed due to threats from intolerant leftists		The left will go after anyone, of any age, just to destroy Trump		Just when you think the left can‚Äôt get any more vile or sinister...

How could anyone still trust the media after this weekend?		Fake ‚Äúbombshell‚Äù built on lies with anonymous sources that was debunked by the special counsel		The attempted public lynching of high school kids on lies just because they wrote Trump hats		Journalism is dead.
Hey @kathygriffin and @Alyssa_Milano looking for your apology to the MAGA kids who have now been vindicated		You seek the ruin lives - like Trump and Kavanaugh		We will win, you will lose		The hateful mob left must be defeated
Just like they did with Justice Kavanaugh, the left has created a fake narrative to bully the Covington Catholic high schoolers for doing nothing wrong		Make no mistake, Democrats are bullies		They will attack anyone at any time, for anything if they disagree with you
Democrats are holding our government hostage over $5.7 Billion out of a $4.4 Trillion budget		For a family‚Äôs household budget, that would be $57 out of $44,070		Imagine a wife refusing to pay a family's bills for weeks because she refused to pay for a $57 fence at their home		ü§î
Just spoke to MAGA hat kid Nick on the phone - he is total hero and has been maligned by the media 		He is in good spirits and plans to FIGHT these lies by the media		I told him we are with him 100%!		Media will divide us and destroy us no longer!!

On Friday a "bombshell report" was debunked and media scrambled for credibility 		On Saturday Trump offers a plan that Democrats once supported only to have them reject it before hearing the details		On Sunday the media runs with a FAKE story trying to ruin high school kids lives
I just watched the unedited video of the high school kids at the March - they did nothing wrong, and I correct an earlier tweet		The left intentionally misreported the facts (typical) to destroy these kids lives to blame it on Trump		Media made this a top story to wreck lives

Today marked the single biggest group to ever attempt illegal crossing		376 line cutting foreign citizens were apprehended trying to cross the border		However as soon as they were arrested by border patrol they declared asylum - many will enter US		We have a crisis on our border!
New York City just unveiled a free health care plan for 600,000 NYC residents, including 300,000 illegal immigrants who avoid paying tax		This is following a 44% increase in property taxes on New Yorkers		Americans shouldn‚Äôt be forced to subsidize foreign citizens here illegally
This debunked fake story was not just covered by the media - it was repeated endlessly by pundits to stir up conversation about ‚Äúimpeachment‚Äù and ‚Äúindictment‚Äù		Makes you think what else might be totally false that is being reported as fact		ü§î
Attacks against @benshapiro intellectually lazy and intentional hit jobs		Easy to see what he was saying when you watch the full clip		The left fears Ben‚Äôs reach, power, and following - evidenced by how far they are reaching to attack him

Incredible to see the media coverup of #MarchForLife - when a handful of leftist protest anything, especially Trump, it makes headline news		This is the most pro life generation in history, and it‚Äôs only becoming more pro life - the media can‚Äôt cover it up much longer
Trump should do the State of the Union from the southern border surrounded by border patrol, Angel families, and ICE agents working hard to keep our country safe		He should invite Nancy Pelosi to join. She can fly commercial like the rest of us and see the border crisis firsthand

Tough week for Democrats:		You got exposed getting drunk on the beach with lobbyists in Puerto Rico during the shutdown		Ruth Bader Ginsberg continues to miss oral arguments		Support for wall jumps double digits in just days		Your taxpayer funded excursion overseas got cancelled
While it is maddening that Democrats won‚Äôt fund any additional money for border security, it is infuriating that Republicans didn‚Äôt move on the issue of the wall while GOP controlled the house		If the GOP house &amp; Senate would have financed the wall they would have kept the house
Yesterday @AOC said she will ‚Äúrun train‚Äù on the Progressive agenda		‚ÄúRun train‚Äù is a graphic term that means to ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù someone		I assume she didn‚Äôt mean this and was joking, however if a Republican dared say this even kiddingly they would be forced to resign

How the media will report Trump forbidding Pelosi to use government aircraft for a taxpayer funded excursion during a shutdown:		Trump prevents elderly woman from going on much needed vacation
Pelosi was on the tarmac right when our amazing President cancelled her trip overseas		Nancy should be negotiating for secure borders not traveling overseas while 800,000 Americans are without pay!		Keep fighting Mr President, we are with you!
If Nancy Pelosi wants to travel overseas why doesn‚Äôt she get her 109 lobbyist friends who funded the Democrat excursion to Puerto Rico to finance it?
The media won‚Äôt report this:		According to an ABC poll, support for the Wall is rising daily		Up from 34 to 42% during the shutdown		Up 13 for college educated		Up 11 among independents		Opposition is down from 63 to 54% and strongly opposed is down from 52 to 38
We should use this government shutdown as a chance to shrink government permanently		Privatize the TSA	Privatize the FAA air traffic controllers	Abolish the IRS	Remove ‚Äúnon essential‚Äù workers		If workers aren‚Äôt essential they shouldn‚Äôt be working in government in the first place
Democrats hate Trump much more than they love America
Nancy Pelosi wants Trump to postpone his State of the Union address due to a government shutdown yet she didn‚Äôt postpone her luxury vacation to Hawaii when the government was shutdown		ü§î

President Trump should tell Pelosi she can watch the state of the Union: on TV while he delivers it from the White House in front of an audience of veterans and angel moms		Constitution says the President will deliver the state of the union - it doesn‚Äôt say where		RT if you agree
The same Democrats attacking Trump for serving fast food in the White House were just getting drunk on the beach in Puerto Rico alongside lobbyists during a government shutdown
The Washington Post had one of their lead reporters do an entire investigation into the calorie count and cost of Trump serving fast food, yet they did little investigation into 30 congressional Democrats getting drunk on the beach with 109 lobbyists during a government shutdown
Facts about men in America:		97% of all military casualties since 1992 are men		94% of all industrial deaths are men		Men are victims of 76% of all homicides		80% of all suicides are men		Men die on average 5 years earlier than women		‚ÄúBoys will be boys‚Äù
Since January 1st in Chicago: 		Shot &amp; Killed: 12	Shot &amp; Wounded: 58	Total Shot: 70	Total Homicides: 14		Toughest gun law in the country, and 2019 is already on pace to be yet another bloody, deadly, horriric year - all run by Democrats
Imagine if the media cared about the corruption at the FBI and DOJ as much as they cared about Trump serving fast food to Clemson‚Äôs football team
One of two recent Presidents did nothing when Putin invaded Crimea, asked Russia for more flexibility until after the election, let Assad cross a red line, had his Secretary of State sell our Uranium to Russia, and allowed Putin to build a pipeline to Germany		The other is Trump

The TSA should be defunded &amp; privatized		In 2015, they failed 95% of undercover tests from DHS agents		That number was down to roughly 80% in 2017		That means 80-95% of the the flights we get on could be compromised		Why are we spending 7.6 billion per year for failure?
Democrats just announced they are disbanding the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism		...To create a new committee to investigate President Trump		Democrats hate our President so much they would rather put our country in blatant danger than see him succeed
If Democrats were so concerned about ending the government shutdown, they would spend their weekends working in Washington D.C.		Not in Puerto Rico with 109 lobbyists on the beach getting drunk watching Hamilton
Only in America would you not be allowed to ask people living in your country whether they are citizens or not
Anyone else notice that Russia stories against Trump always conveniently come up as soon as he begins winning on other issues?		This is a fake character assault against a successful President designed to destroy his Presidency and everyone around him
No one accused Obama of being a Russian agent after he asked for ‚Äúmore flexibility‚Äù until after the the election, or when Obama ignored Putin‚Äôs invasion into Crimea, or when Assad used chemical gas in Syria and Obama‚Äôs red line was crossed
Do the Math: 		Trump‚Äôs wall is $5 billion, illegals cost $165 billion a year
GREAT AGAIN:		Prior to 2018, unemployment has only been below 4% 5 times since 1970		Under Donald Trump, in 2018, unemployment dipped below 4% 7 TIMES‚Äîin ONE year!		What exactly are the Democrats resisting?		ü§î

Did you know:		Chuck Schumer		Barack Obama		Hillary Clinton		Joe Biden		Dianne Feinstein		‚Ä¶ ALL voted to spend billions on a ‚ÄúSecure Fence‚Äù in 2006		Why are they opposed to an upgraded steel barrier now?		ü§î
It is a national disgrace our FBI investigated PRESIDENT Trump for being a ‚ÄúRussian agent‚Äù while refusing to investigate Hillary selling our uranium for cash to Russia or investigating Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on a tarmac secretly or Obama illegally spying on Trump
Make no mistake, if 30 Republicans got drunk on the beach with 109 lobbyists in Puerto Rico watching broadway plays during a government shutdown, it would be the number one story in the world and the media would be screaming for resignations
Strange how liberals keep smashing and destroying Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, yet nothing has happened to Kevin Spacey's or Bill Cosby's star		ü§î
Make no mistake, the ultimate goal of the Democrats is to allow illegal foreign nationals to vote in our elections		They are losing their base and need millions of new voters, because they represent foreign interests more than the average American
If Trump was really controlled by Russia, why did he strengthen NATO, undercut Russia‚Äôs gas pipeline to Germany, arm the citizens of Ukraine, strike in Syria against Putin‚Äôs wishes, refuse to acknowledge the annexation of Crimea, &amp; close a record number of Russian consualtes?		ü§î
Liberal logic:		We need socialism in America to help all those people coming across the border escaping horrible socialist countries
Fact: 		From 2012-2015, Veteran‚Äôs Affairs added 39,454 employees to their payroll 		Only 3,591 were doctors.  		Maybe this is why so many Veterans died waiting for care under Obama? 		ü§î
Kevin Brandon Aragon Luna was arrested and deported at the end of November by ICE for being a part of a terrorist organization, after illegally crossing into the country through the Southern Border		Terrorists are coming across the border		Not having a wall is a security crisis

Sick:		A statue honoring Saudi Arabia has been placed on the ground zero World Trade Center site		The country that funded, planned, and orchestrated 9/11 now has a statue honoring their evil ways just feet from where 3,000 Americans died		This is a national disgrace
Right now 30 Democrats are vacationing on the beach alongside 109 lobbyists while Trump is still in DC trying to broker a deal to build a wall and reopen the government		The Democrat party is vacationing on the beach while our amazing President fights like hell to save America
Planned Parenthood spent $30 million to help the Democrats win back the house		Yet we still give them $500 million in taxpayer funding each year		If they have that kind of cash and engage in that blatant partisan activity, why am I forced to fund them with my money?		ü§î

Privatize the TSA and make the shutdown of their program permanent		They are an unbelievably incompetent, slow, wasteful, useless, ineffective, and bureaucratic nightmare - like all government programs
It‚Äôs amazing how hard the Democrats fight to keep the government closed just to advocate for illegals who broke our laws
Fact:		4,000 illegals are in Texas prisons for sexual assault		62% of those assaults are against children, including American children		A Wall would stop this.		But Chuck and Nancy think $5.7 Billion is too high a price to protect our children from violent criminals and rapists
Fact: 95% of Border Patrol agents say WALLS WORK!		...So why in the hell would we listen to Chuck and Nancy when they say they don‚Äôt?		@realDonaldTrump‚Äîdon‚Äôt give in.

If illegals were likely to vote for Trump and Republicans the wall would be built, totally financed, and anyone who would dare oppose it would be called a racist
In 2018, @RealDonaldTrump:		Created almost 4 million jobs		Achieved lowest ever unemployment		Gained 400,000+ manufacturing jobs		Achieved highest EVER median household income		‚Ä¶ And Democrats think he should be impeached		Is it because they can't beat his record in 2020?		ü§î
Did you know: 		That when polled 95% of active front-line border patrol agents said YES to wanting a wall when surveyed?
Did you know:		Last year ICE saved 900 kids from human trafficking last year		Democrats went to abolish the number one protector of children
Democrats hate Trump more than they love America
President Trump is winning this shutdown fight		Democrats have no message, and are refusing to open government because they are fighting for foreign nationals that want to flow endlessly into our country		Stand your ground President Trump, we have your back!
I believe immigration is the number one issue facing our country		Failure to secure our southern border as well as resist any form of amnesty is the defining issue of our generation		Democrats know if they are successful in granting citizenship to millions of illegals they win

4 prominent Democrat senators voted for a wall in 2006		Their names? 		Barack Obama 	Hillary Clinton 	Chuck Schumer	Joe Biden 		Most Democrats have supported border security their entire time in office... until President Trump took office		What changed?
The government is shut down because we are fighting with our own country to protect our own country		If Democrats don‚Äôt agree to keep America safe, then Republicans shouldn‚Äôt put our future at stake.		Keep the shutdown going until we agree that America should always come first
Barack Obama: 		Voted for the Secure Fence Act Of 2006 		Has a 10 foot wall around his house 		Used walls to keep veterans out of the WWII memorial during his Obamacare shutdown 		How can Democrats now say a wall is immoral?		ü§î

Americans deserve a secure border but Democrats would rather:		Vote against Kate‚Äôs Law		Vote for Sanctuary Cities		Obstruct construction of the wall		Loosen vetting on refugees		Vote against the deportation of violent illegals		Abolish ICE		Democrats always put America last

A federal judge for the DC Circuit just called Hillary Clinton‚Äôs handling of her email server ‚Äúone of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency‚Äù		When will the special counsel investigate this?		ü§î
Heartbreaking:		Pierce Corcoran, 22 year old patriot, was killed by an illegal alien in a head on collision crash who previously had an ICE hold against him		If we had a wall, and deported illegals put on ICE lists, he and thousands others would be alive		Democrats are to blame
To be fair, the next time a Democrat is elected President a special counsel should be immediately formed made up of 100% Republicans for the sole purpose of finding ANY crime they or anyone they have ever met has committed with the goal of impeachment		Sound fair?
Who else hasn‚Äôt forgotten and wants to see a list of the members of Congress who used taxpayer dollars to settle and hide sexual misconduct cases?		ü§î

Hey ‚Å¶@AOC‚Å© - you just said there is ‚Äúno question‚Äù the President is a racist		Does this look like a racist?

We should cut ALL funding to countries that burn the American flag and use the savings to build the wall
GREAT AGAIN:		Holiday sales were strongest they have been in 6 years, up 5.1% from last year		Americans are finally confident in our economy again thanks to President Trump
Illegals should not be counted in the census		Basic projections show that California gets an extra 9 electoral votes because of counting illegals 		This disenfranchises Montana, Wyoming, and North Dakota, COMBINED! 		This is true foreign interference in our election
The media is covering up the fact Officer Singh was murdered by an illegal foreign national		When are we going to start getting smart and deporting foreign nationals that have repeatedly broke our laws?		How many more Americans have to be killed by illegals before we get tough?
The media keeps saying that the GOP was "mocking" @AOC dance video		I haven't seen one example of that or one piece of evidence of anyone in leadership or in office mock her		However, I have seen people be critical of her inability to make a coherent argument &amp; her horrific ideas
WOW!		#SAS2018 was proof that the Conservative movement is full of thousands of young, hungry FIGHTERS working to protect America from the left's radical ideas		If you want to keep America the greatest country in the history of the earth..

GREAT AGAIN:		In December, the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos, aged 16 and up, was 4.4%, down from 4.5% in November - tying its record low of 4.4% set in October of this year		Lowest ever unemployment thanks to @realDonaldTrump
Epic fail:		Chicago's top gun grabber alderman was busted and arrested with 23 of HIS OWN GUNS		The left is trying to strong arm banks and credit card companies to enforce its ideals like gun control.¬†¬†Yet their leader in Chicago was busted with 23 guns and corruption charges.
Fact:		A new Harvard study has found that 80% of all voters say we need a secure border, including 86% of Democrats!		Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are fighting against the will of the American people by keeping the government shutdown and our borders wide open		BUILD THE WALL!

The left would rather have Obama‚Äôs legacy:		8 years of war		Lowest economic growth ever		Record food stamp enrollment		Highest ever health insurance costs		...Than Trump‚Äôs:		Korean peace		ISIS defeated		Booming economy		Record breaking stock markets		Lowest EVER unemployment		ü§î
Every day and twice on Friday @AOC should hold a press conference		She is constantly wrong, yet never in doubt		She touts ideas that are so fallacious and foolish it shows how extreme the Democrats have become		Please Congresswoman, keep talking, you are doing the Lords work
Did you know:		Democrats won 73/100 of the wealthiest house districts in the midterms		Hillary won 8/10 of the wealthiest counties in 2016		Democrats pretend to be the party of working people yet they are actually catering to the interests of the 1% and elites

An illegal alien in Sanctuary State California last week was let free from prison and:		Stole a truck		Robbed a grocery store		Murdered an American		Drove the wrong way at 100 MPH and wrecked multiple vehicles		A wall would have prevented this horrible crime from happening
Did you know: 		Robert Mueller prevented 9/11 families from suing Saudi Arabia for damages? 		Saudi knew about 9/11 before it happened, financed it, lied about it, and failed to cover it up 		Why did Robert Mueller prevent 9/11 victims families from suing them? 		ü§î
Why Democrats need illegals:		For every 770,000 illegals who filled out the 2010 census in a leftist state, the Democrats got another vote in the electoral college		Foreign nationals should NOT be counted in the census. It rewards law breaking and gives Democrats a upper hand!
Did you know:		Since 1972, the government has spent over 6 billion dollars on ‚Äúsound walls‚Äù along highways to protect neighborhoods from traffic noise		If we can spend 6 billion on keeping our homes quiet, why can't we spend 6 billion to keep our country safe		ü§î

Breaking:		Suspicious package sent to the great Senator Susan Collins house		All this because we courageously stood up to the mob and voted for Justice Kavanaugh		The left will attack, smear, threaten, and assault anyone they disagree with it
College admissions should be based on intellect, merit, work ethic, grades, test scores, leadership, and character - NOT skin color		End affirmative action. It is a racist practice that judges people on the color of their skin not their character or intelligence
At Harvard they gave Elizabeth Warren a professor spot because she is 1/1024th Native American		She is a fraud who used affirmative action to get into a position of influence and power		Harvard should be equally ashamed for rewarding these lies and falsehoods
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 85 years old		Stephen Breyer is 80 years old		If Republicans VOTE in November, we will see one if not TWO more Supreme Court nominations from President Trump		4 years, 4 Justices. Let‚Äôs do this
Liberal logic:		Kanye West, a black man, supporting the GOP because black unemployment is at an all time low is called a mentally unstable racist by the media		But when Taylor Swift supports a old man over a HIGHLY QUALIFIED Republican woman, she‚Äôs called a feminist icon		ü§î
How do we know Justice Kavanaugh is absolutely innocent of everything he‚Äôs been accused of?		If the sealed FBI report contained any incriminating evidence, Dianne Feinstein would have leaked it by now
If the Republican agenda was actually to ‚Äúenshrine white male power‚Äù as the New York Times reported, then why do more:		African-Americans	Hispanics	Asian-Americans	Women	&amp; Teenagers		Have more jobs than EVER before in our country‚Äôs history under a Republican government?		ü§î
Thank you so much Candace		I can‚Äôt wait for the world to see what you have planned coming out next week. It will change the game forever https://t.co/Rn5an9iDht
Obama oversaw creation of ISIS 	Trump destroyed ISIS 		Obama wrecked the economy 	Trump saved the economy 		Obama got us close to war with Korea	Trump ended the Korean War		Obama traded terrorists for hostages	Trump has brought home a record number of hostages		We are great again
China is America‚Äôs top enemy		They steal our intellectual property, manipulate their currency, hack our cyber-grid, and constantly lie on the world stage https://t.co/3rnZ5WcahJ
Democrats are not afraid Trump will fail, they are terrified he will succeed		His success means the end of the Democrat party forever changing the landscape of American politics
GREAT AGAIN:		Unemployment has NEVER been this low for a non-wartime president		Not only has President Trump achieved peace around the world:		- ISIS destroyed	- Korean Peninsula denuclearizing	- Russians &amp; Chinese weakened		He‚Äôs bringing jobs, not mobs like the Democrats
Did you know:		The Senate has unanimously passed S. Res. 610, calling for the declassification and release of tens of thousands of pages of documents about Saudi Arabia &amp; the terrorist attacks of 9/11		This should be accelerated given recent murder of Washington Post journalist
GREAT AGAIN:		Last month, the U.S. added 230 THOUSAND new jobs! 50,000 more than what was projected for September		Highest growth since February and LOWEST unemployment since 1969!
Obama traded 5 terrorists for a traitor		Obama gave billions in cash to Iran who wants us dead		Trump gives up nothing and brings American prisoners home from North Korea and a pastor home from Turkey		Trump cancelled the Iran deal and moved the embassy		America is back.
President Clinton - record black imprisonment		President Obama - record black welfare		President Trump - record black employment

This last week in one picture https://t.co/qSQtrgv7Au
There are 3.6 million black kids in poverty, single motherhood rate in black community is 73%, &amp; our cities are suffering under Democrat mob rule		Yet all the Democrats can focus on is bringing in millions of more illegals to America to get them dependent on government for votes
Did you know:		Cory Booker has taken nearly $400,000 from the pharmaceutical lobby while regularly voting against lower drug prices		‚Ä¶And then he campaigns on the platform that drug and healthcare prices are too high		The Left doesn‚Äôt care about people they only care about power
Taylor Swift endorses Bredesen in Tennessee Senate race and days later he is down 14 points in the polls		Kanye West praises Trump and black approval now at an all time high, at 38% for a Republican President		Tell me again who is the more powerful cultural icon?		ü§î
The left says they want blacks represented everywhere but for some reason are always really bothered by black conservatives
Net worth before running for President:		Trump family: $4.5 billion	Obama - $3 million	Clinton - $480,000		Today:		Trump family: $3 billion ‚¨áÔ∏è	Obama - $40 million ‚¨ÜÔ∏è	Clinton - $100 million ‚¨ÜÔ∏è		But Trump is the guy trying to steal your money?		ü§î

This week Democrats saw Brett Kavanugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, Kanye West give Trump a hug, black unemployment hit the lowest level EVER, every Senate race tilt towards Republicans dramatically, and in return Democrats responded by rioting and calling Kanye a "dumb negro"
Mob Tactics of the Left have been defeated: 		They failed with Trump	They failed with Kavanaugh	They failed with Kanye		All they do is scare away moderates and fire up the GOP Base.
#MAGA https://t.co/aKnTufIJOJ
Don‚Äôt forget - Kanye West had a year and half of political silence until he tweeted the famous words		‚ÄúI love the way Candace Owens thinks‚Äù		@RealCandaceO is playing a historic role in helping change the conversation and give blacks permission to defect from the Democrat party
We love our President 	We love Kanye West		#MAGA https://t.co/hU1AsvRv2W
The left has said the nastiest things about Kanye West the last few days		Why?		Because he says black people don‚Äôt have to be Democrats		He dares challenge the status quo in defiance of the elites		CNN calls him a ‚Äútoken negro‚Äù		The true racists are liberals who want control
A Liberal shot Steve Scalise	A liberal mauled Rand Paul	A liberal gang ran @RealCandaceO and I out of a restaurant		Here is former AG Holder saying ‚ÄúWhen they go low, we kick them‚Äù		The left is outwardly calling for political violence daily		This man used to be Attorney General https://t.co/WD4XtcIDZz

New study: 		Illegal immigration cost US taxpayers over $135 billion last year 		Illegal immigration is not only destabilizing the rule of law, destroying our culture, but also bankrupting America
The transformation of the Republican Party into the party of @realDonaldTrump is for the better in every regard		We are a party of results. A party that fights. A party that puts America first and a party that WINS		#MAGA
Not all black people have to be Democrats
STAT OF THE DAY: 		140 Democrats refused to vote ‚ÄòYES‚Äô on a resolution condemning voting by illegal immigrants in our elections		Democrats want illegals to vote in elections. They need illegals because they have turned their back on the American people https://t.co/sWbgDg00Dr
Hey @DePaulU - why are you so afraid of allowing @RealCandaceO and I to come on campus?		The left hates the idea there are other ideas		They DENIED us because they say we say ‚Äúpotentially violent‚Äù things		Hey DePaul, your fascism is showing https://t.co/bn4IBadkbz
Democrats 2018 platform:		Bring back ISIS	Keep North Korea Nuclear	Raise your taxes	War with Russia	Let‚Äôs crash the stock market	Get back on welfare	Abolish ICE	Sympathy for MS13	All these new jobs need to go	Illegals over citizens	There are no genders
I don‚Äôt think what people say or do in high school or college should be held against them, with a few obvious exceptions		Your tweet demonstrates exactly why the media circus you and your network perpetuated against Justice Kavanaugh was filled with hypocrisy and foolishness. https://t.co/iadEk6TVfW
Voter fraud is real:		An internal audit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles released Monday shows about 1,500 customers may have been improperly registered to vote most of whom are illegals.		Illegals should be deported, not given the opportunity to vote
This moment might have saved Kavanaugh. I love the new Lindsey Graham. Strong and fights! He understands all the left wants is POWER and will do anything to attain it. 		We must stand and FIGHT! https://t.co/Qdwhj0IfS4
Never been more proud of @RealCandaceO		Tonight she took on a all black crowd of 300+ skeptics full of disagreement and energy		She could have easily marginalized her beliefs or moderated her positions		Instead, she stood strong for @realDonaldTrump and won over the room!
Obama donated zero of his salary, is taking a full pension of $400,000 a year, full secret service detail, and Michelle Obama had a staff of 23 people		Trump donates his entire salary, will reject his pension, and Melania has a staff of 4 people
Here it is. A reporter for VICE tells the world that her reporting shows that the protesters were indeed PAID!		This hit job against Kavanaugh was an astroturf campaign designed to smear a good man. 		We won, America won, THEY LOST! 		RT to show the truth https://t.co/tEhsHRWGDY
Annual cost of illegal immigration by state:		CA.. $21.8 Billion 	NY.. $9.5 Billion 	TX.. $8.9 Billion 	FL.. $5.5 Billion	IL.. $4.6 Billion	NJ.. $3.5 Billion 	AZ.. $2.6 Billion 	GA. $2.4 Billion		Annual national cost over $84 billion		Illegals are a financial drain on our country
The Democrats would much rather see Trump fail than America succeed
Imagine you‚Äôre a sitting President:		You pick your successor, weaponize the FBI, DOJ, &amp; IRS against the opponent. You control 90% of the media. You have 2X the ad budget. You collude with foreign powers against the challenger, &amp; you lose to a billionaire you claim is beneath you
We do NOT live in a democracy, we live in a constitutional republic with democratically held elections		In a democracy, 51% of the people can take 100% of your rights		In a republic, the rights of all are equally protected		In a democracy, the mob rules

Hey @taylorswift13 -		You just endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee senate race with a ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn, a woman, is against women		You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about		Your career has never recovered since Kanye ended it
If the Republican Party continues to fight as hard and as smart as Lindsey Graham has the last two weeks, we will grow our majority in the house and attain 60 seats in the Senate
There are only two genders

After watching this Kavanaugh circus for the last 6 weeks I do not understand how any rational voter could support a Democrat at any level for any office		They will do anything to get back into power, and use the demagogue, lying, smear tactics to stir up their mob
The left is obsessed with race	The @nytimes should be embarrassed to run a piece that uses the term ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù		This is highly racist rhetoric. Switch ‚Äúwhite‚Äù with ‚Äúblack‚Äù and it would be rightfully considered fringe racist ideology https://t.co/HVsYKiXflR

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH!!!!!
The more the angry mob of Democrats interrupt voting for a Supreme Court Justice the more seats we will win in November		They are the party of the mob. Their leaders stay silent as their base attacks decent people		Never. Let. Them. Take. Power.
Do you notice how many wins the Republican Party achieves under President Trump?		ü§î
The unrest is only beginning		The left will target all of us. Their mob and gang will only grow more fierce and nasty		They cannot win on ideas. They refuse to have honest debate or deal ethically		Today is a victory against the sinister leftist mob		Many more battles to come
You mad? https://t.co/5u7w4c3PrQ
The irony of this Kavanaugh circus is the Democrats thought by elevating these 35 year allegations they would block a nominee, energize their base, &amp; win back the Senate		Instead they galvanized the GOP base, got Kavanaugh confirmed, and will lose Senate seats because of this
Special shoutout to Mitch McConnell, Lindsay Graham, Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, &amp; yes even Jeff Flake (if he does what he says he‚Äôs going to do)		They held the line, withstood insane harassment, &amp; are going to confirm Kavanaugh		I never thought I would send a tweet like this
The Republican Party is the party of @realDonaldTrump 		We are now a party that fights 	We are now a party that punches back twice as hard	We are now a party that is united against the lies of the left	We are now a party that stands up to the mob	We are now a party that WINS
RT @DonaldJTrumpJr: Trump supporters - The fight isn‚Äôt over. You better believe that Democrats are going to do everything in their power to‚Ä¶
Imagine being a Democrat:		You historically lost the 2016 election		Every prediction about Trump failing has been hilariously wrong		Two strong conservatives are now on the Supreme Court		And your attempt to destroy Kavanaugh ended up uniting and energizing Republicans		Must suck
We did it		Despite millions of dollars hastily spent to destroy a man‚Äôs life and reputation the Senate will rightfully confirm the most vetted nominee in history. 		Do not allow Democrats to EVER take power.
THANK YOU SENATOR COLLINS!!!!!
We are one vote away from thwarting Democrat mob rule and stopping the most pernicious, aggressive, and unethical character attack in the history of the US Senate		Senator Collins, please do the right thing and vote for Judge Kavanaugh. This is bigger than just the Supreme Court
Lisa Murkowski, you represent a state that Trump won by 15 points		You campaigned on conservative values &amp; putting strong judges on the court		You have an obligation to confirm Kavanaugh		If not, we the grassroots will launch a primary that will end your career
If Mitch McConnell brings Kavanaugh across the finish line he deserves to be Senate Majority leader heading into 2019		He will have kept a slim majority intact despite the most aggressive offensive against an honorable the left has ever launched		Go Mitch Go.
Meanwhile in real news:		Unemployment hits a 49 year low of 3.7%  as the economy adds 134,000 jobs in September alone		This is the strongest economy in American history
Mitch McConnell rightfully calls for a vote on Kavanaugh Saturday		We stand with Kavanaugh	Trump stands with Kavanaugh 	The base stands with him	His classmates stand with him 	Law clerks stand with him 	Everyone who has worked with him stands by him		Will the Senate GOP?
The Left CANNOT defend their attack on due process and the rule of law		When I visited @CUBoulder recently, I was told "I looked like a rapist" because I said Judge Kavanaugh is innocent until PROVEN guilty		When leftists can‚Äôt win, they defame and attack!		RT https://t.co/sx1fGs13cQ
Kavanaugh has now passed 7 FBI background checks with sterling records		Served honorably in the White House &amp; as a circuit court judge		Hundreds of women attest to his conduct and professionalism		Hired more women clerks than men		He is the most vetted Supreme Court nominee ever
Did you know:		According to widely respected academic studies false allegations of rape and sexual assault are five times as common as false accusations of any other type of crime
If you think the left has reached peak insanity, just wait until next week when we have a swearing in ceremony for Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh with President Trump
Can we take a moment today to say a prayer for this incredible man and his family?		They are true victims of the sinister left. May god bless them as they enter the final chapter of what truly must be hell for them		May god be with them and their family https://t.co/BcNovIsdHK
Not only we will now have a 5-4 majority on the court, a lifetime appointment on the bench with a judge that has an exceptional record, the Democrats also reinvigorated the conservative base in a way that just might allow Republicans to maintain their majorities defying history
Enough of this ridiculous mob circus against Kavanaugh		FBI report came up totally clean		It‚Äôs not as if a clean FBI report would convince Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh anyway		Call the vote. Hold the line. 	Confirm Kavanaugh!!

The people most upset about the Kavanaugh injustice are women		They see their sons, their fathers, husbands, and uncles in a wrongly accused man that has had his reputation and family destroyed on baseless 35 year old claims that are political driven		Confirm him.
Did you know:		in 1992 Sen. Hirono of Hawaii, who doesn‚Äôt believe in presumed innocence and is leading the witch hunt against Kavanaugh because ‚Äúwomen need to be believed‚Äù refused to believe a woman who accused her mentor, Senator Daniel Inouye (D) of rape		I wonder why?		ü§î
Fact:		Dr. Ford said under oath she never coached or aided anyone to take a polygraph		A FBI interview with her ex-boyfriend directly contradicts this. He swears he saw her coach a mutual friend on how to pass a polygraph years ago. 		Perjury?		ü§î
Why due process matters:		Dr. Ford‚Äôs story it totally falling apart. She can‚Äôt remember the time, place, neighborhood, year, month, floor, or any supporting details		The ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù she presented all contradict her narrative &amp; exonerate Kavanaugh		Believe facts. Believe evidence
Under penalty of perjury Dr. Ford‚Äôs boyfriend says the following:		-Ford never mentioned sexual assault 	- Ford never mentioned Kavanaugh	- Ford not scared of confined spaces	- Ford not scared of flying	- Ford knew how to beat polygraph	- Ford cheated on him/committed fraud
This should scare EVERY American		@SenBooker is for MOB RULE and says it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter if Kavanaugh is innocent or guilty‚Äù		Democrats are abandoning due process &amp; the rule of law to OBSTRUCT the confirmation of a GREAT conservative judge		End the witch hunt #ConfirmKavanaughNOW https://t.co/68TTFWQCKt

Jared Kushner, who I am honored to call a friend, has been notching up major victory after victory		Securing the olympics, World Cup, finalizing the trade deal, pushing prison reform, and urban revitalization just a few accomplishments to name		A total patriot and very smart! https://t.co/UXPKkOxnRK
The forgotten victims of the entire Kavanaugh witch hunt so far:		His daughters - 13 year old Margaret &amp; 10 year old Elizabeth		His Wife of 14 years, Ashley		The American people who are being denied a fair &amp; just confirmation process for an over-qualified Supreme Court justice
Beto O'Rourke has been flagged for Campaign Finance Violations, 'for accepting ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù and ‚Äúimpermissible‚Äù donations from individuals from outside of the country'		Foreign meddling!
Really incredible to see members of the DC political culture lecture Kavanaugh about excessive drinking given what I have witnessed firsthand over the past 5 years		Those in glass houses shouldn‚Äôt throw stones
According to USA Today, of the 5 biggest states:		California ranks #1 for Poverty		Texas ranks #1 for prosperity &amp; growth		One has been run by Democrats for years and the other has elected Republicans since the 90‚Äôs - which do you think is a better model for America?		ü§î
If the FBI can quickly investigate a supreme court nominee‚Äôs life from 35 years ago why can‚Äôt they investigate the crimes of Bill and Hillary Clinton?		ü§î

The newest Democrat star - ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù O‚Äô Rourke has said:		Illegals immigrants are only needed to work cotton gins		Police are the equivalent of modern day Jim Crow		Nothing is more American than kneeling for &amp; burning the U.S. flag		He must be defeated.
Economists predict 1.3 million Americans will leave Blue states like California for Red states like Texas in the next 3 years because of high taxes		Over the past decade, 3.5 million have relocated from high-tax to low-tax states		The left destroys everything it touches
Liberals have: feelings and emotion 		Conservatives have: logic, history, perspective, science, reason, facts, math, principles, ethics, values, dialogue &amp; common sense
If you want to understand what the Left is doing right now, read Saul Alinsky‚Äôs Rules For Radicals.		What we are seeing right now is Rule #13 in action: ‚ÄúPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.‚Äù		The Left doesn't care about women, they care about winning
The left is terrified of other ideas		They quickly cut off Kanye West last night on SNL during his pro-Trump monologue		Kanye alongside the great @RealCandaceO have started a cultural revolution that will break the back of the Democrat party as we know it		Cannot be stopped
Saying someone must think a certain way based solely on skin color is the textbook definition of racism
.@realDonaldTrump please order the FBI to investigate Keith Ellison. Ranking Democrat Congressman and deputy charity of the DNC		We have 911 calls and serious evidence alleging he beat his girlfriend		A FBI investigation is needed into this sitting member of Congress
RT @RealCandaceO: Kanye West is one of the bravest man in Hollywood right now. He was booed off stage last night for openly supporting Trum‚Ä¶
Hey @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins if you don‚Äôt vote to confirm Kavanaugh you will legitimize the public character destruction from the sinister left. 		You can‚Äôt watch this and believe the left cares about anything except power. Sick. 		Never let Democrats near power. Ever. https://t.co/WBGO8c6czv
I've never seen such ANGRY protesters fighting AGAINST the right to due process!		When the Left can't win on ideas, they resort to DESTROYING good people‚Äôs reputations and ATTACKING the character of anyone who dares to stand up for him		End the sham.	Confirm Kavanaugh now!		RT https://t.co/9VzzSi7UcE
Do the Democrats realize the dangerous precedent they have now set?		All high school records and experiences are now open to investigation and examination		We no longer care how far people have grown over the years, instead it‚Äôs what they did when they were 15
It is a sad day in America where the FBI is forced to investigate a 35 year old allegation against an honorable man with no evidence or witnesses yet they won‚Äôt investigate the Clinton‚Äôs for the tarmac meeting, selling out our uranium for cash, or unethical dealings
I have a donor willing to give $50,000 for verifiable information to who leaked Dr. Ford‚Äôs info and violated her confidentiality		This could have &amp; should have been done privately protecting her name &amp; Kavanaugh‚Äôs reputation		Reputations &amp; victim‚Äôs wishes should be protected		RT
This hit job by the Democrats will create a new generation of Andrew Breitbart warriors		Andrew was a Democrat before they tried to smear the great Clarence Thomas.		Countless new voters and activists have risen up to oppose the sinister left this week		Watch and RT! https://t.co/bIyjepiDLb
Breaking:		Blasey Ford's best friend to tell FBI she has no knowledge of Kavanaugh or party		Democrats will ruin a man‚Äôs family, destroy his career, and reputation   with zero evidence and witnesses pushing back.
I predicted this earlier. Feinstein and the Democrats had Dr Ford info weeks head of time. Booker, Harris and others were also likely involved. 		Democrats don‚Äôt care about truth or victims. They just care about power		Watch and RT! https://t.co/fuFFNao5YQ
Hey Democrats		You really want an FBI investigation into this circus?		How about finding out whose funding this hit job? Dr. Ford‚Äôs phone records? Bank accounts? Who she met with during the month of August? What Senators knew about this beforehand?		Be careful what you wish for
This is happening by the millions. Mark my words, the conservative base has awoken https://t.co/E81oHipYAd
The left will do anything to destroy you. 		They will lie, steal, cheat and destroy conservatives		I tried to have a reasonable conversation today		Instead I was verbally assailed by leftists		Don‚Äôt let them take power		RT https://t.co/6OsiySRfvD
By smearing and demeaning an innocent man based on a 35 year allegation, the Democrats have awoken the conservative base in a way they could never plan for, anticipate, or imagine.
I hope every Republican takes careful note of what happened yesterday		The only way to thwart the sinister left is to punch back twice as hard. You cannot give them the benefit of the doubt or believe they will be decent		They will destroy families, marriages, and people		Fight.
How can @SenBlumenthal sit here and lecture us on Judge Kavanaugh's credibility? 		Yesterday he said if you lie once, you don't deserve to ever be believed. 		Pretty ironic coming from a man who has lied FOR YEARS about serving in Vietnam ü§î
Liberal tolerance https://t.co/CibbiAYmVk
Corey Booker, who has admitted to sexual assault, is lecturing us on why Kavanaugh shouldn‚Äôt be on the Supreme Court because of a 35 year old debunked allegation from high school with zero evidence or witnesses
Democrats massive attack has backfired historically		Not only have they failed to thwart Kavanaugh, they have fired up the conservative base in a way I have never seen before		The righteous indignation to never allow Democrats near power will result in turnout like 2016
Midterms are nearly a month away, never forget it‚Äôs Democrats: 		Who are ruining a man's life &amp; threatening his family to retain power 		Who are exploiting fake allegations for political gain		Who promised to do ANYTHING to stop Kavanaugh		It's the only promise they've kept
This a horribly racist statement. If you replaced ‚Äúwhite‚Äù with ‚Äúblack‚Äù you would be banned from Twitter and your career over. https://t.co/V6kh4yLhFO
Brett Kavanaugh did EXACTLY what he needed to do today!		He called out the sinister left on their evil tactics &amp; stood tall in the face of these vicious, calculated attacks by Senator Feinstein &amp; the Democrat Party		The American people see through this sham #ConfirmKavanaughNow https://t.co/bJkvn2jwLN
If you think the left is unhinged, unethical, and out of control, just wait until a week from today where Brett Kavanaugh is officially on the Supreme Court
There is far more evidence that Dianne Feinstein leaked a confidential unsubstantiated allegation, hid it from Kavanaugh, back-channeled with Dr Ford, and unethically sprang it at the last minute than Kavanaugh committing a horrible sexual assault 35 years ago
Every American NEEDS to see this!		@LindseyGrahamSC was a WARRIOR for truth today!		He totally EXPOSED the Democrat‚Äôs sinister con job to DESTROY a good man		CONFIRM KAVANAUGH NOW https://t.co/Qdwhj0IfS4
Just a reminder:		Senator Coons said Kavanaugh should have to prove his innocence. Which is one of the most outrageous statements a US senator on the judiciary committee can make		You cannot prove a negative. 		Innocent until proven guilty.
Fact: 		Dianne Feinstein held onto this allegation for 6 weeks while advising Dr. Ford to hire counsel		She had a private meeting August 20th with Kavanaugh and didn‚Äôt mention it		In 31 hours of testimony she didn‚Äôt mention it once		She should be utterly ashamed
OH MY LINDSEY GRAHAM
Judge Kavanaugh FACTS: 		 -6 cleared FBI background investigations 	 -34+ hours of sworn testimony 	 -1,200+ written questions; more than all other SCOTUS nominees combined 	 -3 interviews with the Committee under penalty of felony categorically denying all accusations 		 CONFIRM
‚ÄúSomeone is not telling the truth‚Äù		Brian Williams, on MSNBC		Yes Brian, most likely you. 		Where you there? 		ü§î https://t.co/2rdmlTBopQ
Just when you think the left cannot sink any further - what goes around, comes around. https://t.co/paPCJ4ITbD
I hope everyone is watching this and starting to realize how sinister the left is		They do not care abou families. They do not care about decency. They do not care about truth. 		They care about power		God bless Brett Kavanaugh		Confirm this honorable man.
Kavanaugh exuding rightful indignation		This is exactly what he needed to do. 		He sounds like a man who is being wrongfully accused		CONFIRM KAVANAUGH!
Kavanaugh needs to fight like the great Clarence Thomas did. The left will never stop unless you thwart their attacks. 		Stand your ground, tell the truth, do not back down. https://t.co/m9JwtIbJ5i
I cannot overstate how important this moment is in American history		Either we will abide by the presumption of innocence and honor a man who has an impeccable 35 years of service or capitulate to a inconsistent decade old politically motivated allegation		Do not let the left win
I believe Corey Booker should have due process and is innocent until proven guilty against the groping allegations pressed towards him		Does he afford the same to Kavanaugh?		ü§î
What did Sheila Jackson Lee hand to Dr. Ford‚Äôs attorney?		Watch this!		There is something else going on here https://t.co/h1a5Au1MB4
Dr Ford doesn‚Äôt know who paid for her polygraph		A a likely expensive procedure at an offsite location, near an airport, done secretly, without knowing who paid for it		Who is paying for her lawyers? Who is paying for all of this?		There is something else going on here
He fights. https://t.co/GjPQyZFNB7
Question for Dr Ford:		Why would two men this morning admit to committing this assault and clearing Kavanaugh?		How can you be certain this was Brett Kavanaugh?
The precedent of elevating 30 year old unsubstantiated allegations from high school will set us on a never ending witch hunt attacking good people for things they cannot remember, cannot substantiate, cannot disprove, and forever discredit them despite a life of service
If Democrats really cared about the victims they would believe Keith Ellison‚Äôs ex-girlfriend who has 911 calls as evidence		If Democrats really cared about the victims they wouldn‚Äôt have smeared Juanita Broderick, Paula Jones, or Jennifer Flowers		It‚Äôs about politics, not victims
Hey Dianne Feinstein - quit the sob story		YOU held onto this fake accusation private for 6 weeks because you didn‚Äôt think it was relevant		YOU betrayed Dr Ford‚Äôs wishes to remain private		YOU  didn‚Äôt ask Kavanaugh about this ONCE despite 31 hours of testimony		Con job.
Questions for Dr Ford:		Why didn‚Äôt you tell anyone about your accusations for 30 yrs?		Why bring your accusation to politicians not law enforcement?		Why has your story changed multiple times with zero witnesses?		Why try and destroy a career in front of the country 35 yrs later?
We now have two men ADMITTING they were the ones who assaulted Dr. Ford NOT Kavanaugh		Why is the media not covering this wall to wall? Who would admit to something like this unless true with a guilty conscious?		This is a game changer &amp; clears Kavanaugh ahead of hearing
BREAKING:		"Two men have come forward to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to say that they are the ones who actually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford during a house party in 1982 &amp; NOT Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh"		Kavanaugh‚Äôs name being cleared	GOP, DONT CAVE!
Brace yourselves:		Radical leftism is about to reach peak insanity over the next 48 hours		We could end up with a confirmed Supreme Court Justice in defiance of the left‚Äôs targeted campaign to destroy this honorable man and his family		Stand for truth. Confirm Kavanaugh
You know your case against Kavanaugh is starting to fall apart when even the New York Times passes on all your fake accusations and stories
Believe women? 	Believe men?		I believe evidence. Facts. Truth. 		The pernicious idea you must automatically believe all women no matter what is so destructive to the rightful tradition of cross examination and presumption of innocence		This is tribal. This is must be stopped.
Brett Kavanaugh went through:		31 hours of public testimony	Dozens of hours of closed-door testimony	1300+ written questions &amp; responses to Senators		NOT ONCE did this allegation come up. What the Left is doing is truly sinister		This is about destroying a good man for politics
This press conference is exactly why we fought so hard to elect @realDonaldTrump 		Strong, decisive, clear, confident, with an American first vision		He should do this many times a week. He is his own best advocate.
"Socialism is not exactly riding high" - @realDonaldTrump 		We do not deserve a President this incredible
It is my opinion that this latest fiction story from the ‚ÄúCreepy Porn Lawyer‚Äù actually helps Kavanaugh		The accusation is so outrageous, so improbable, so disgusting with zero evidence, zero witnesses, &amp; no one ever mentioning it despite 6 FBI background checks - fabricated!
Brett Kavanaugh has:		Spent his entire life in public service		Had 6 FBI vets into his background &amp; was confirmed to the 2nd highest court in the US with ZERO accusations		Yet all this comes out days before the Democrats risk losing the court for a generation		ü§î
Wait a minute, if the horrendous crime of ‚Äúgang rape‚Äù actually occurred 10 times one summer 35 years ago, why didn‚Äôt anyone call the police, tell adults, and why would women keep going back to the parties?		ü§î
By executive order the President should demand the release of a list of every member of Congress who ever used taxpayer dollars to settle sexual harassment complaints

If the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh we do not deserve to be in control of Congress		This is an upstanding honorable man who is being perniciously attacked by the left on fake allegations from HIGH SCHOOL!		If the GOP caves, we will get blown away in the midterms
One of the most disgusting and evil descriptions of our time is when people say ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler‚Äù 		This cheapens the evil of Hitler and turns a blind eye to the horrors of the Holocaust 		We must never forget the great evil of the 20th century and never allow it to happen again https://t.co/Vjy64Ctw6Y
If Republicans fail to confirm Kavanaugh they will have given the sinister left a victory that will inspire countless attacks against conservatives nationwide		This is a last ditch effort with no evidence, changing story, zero witnesses, and FROM HIGH SCHOOL		Can‚Äôt let them win
Mitch McConnell rightfully calls for a vote on Kavanaugh Friday morning		We stand with Kavanaugh	Trump stands with Kavanaugh 	The base stands with him	His classmates stand with him 	Law clerks stand with him 	Everyone who has worked with him stands by him		Will the Senate GOP?

Imagine the meltdown the left would have if the FBI decided to declare Kavanaugh completely of innocent of all allegations without even talking to him		You know, how they did with Hillary
The tolerant left just drove Ted Cruz out of a restaurant with protestors		The tolerant left also assaulted Rand Paul while he was mowing his lawn, shot and almost killed Steve Scalise, drove @RealCandaceO &amp; I out of a restaurant, sent fake Anthrax to @DonaldJTrumpJr and his kids
You ever hear of Democrat privilege?		It means you can commit crimes without going to jail &amp; do anything without consequences		Like Ted Kennedy killing a girl	Like Keith Ellison beating his girlfriend	Like Hillary selling out America for cash	Like Kerry violating Logan act
The attacks against Kavanaugh WILL NOT STOP until we punch back twice as hard		Flashback to the GREAT Justice Thomas who courageously stood against the mob in the face of baseless slanderous attacks		We stand by you Kavanaugh. Don‚Äôt waver. I hope the Senate GOP does too		RT! https://t.co/oXwBy78YAl
The sooner conservatives realize that the left will do absolutely anything to win: lie, cheat, steal, slander, falsify, attack, demagogue, insult, protest, malign, fabricate, and organize - the sooner we will realize they will not give us our country back - we must fight for it.

The Democrats pretend Republicans are the party of the rich, yet Hillary won 70% of the wealthiest counties in America
Mitch McConnell just drew a line in the sand against these baseless character attacks by the sinister left		Love this Mitch! 		Please fight this hard on the wall, repealing Obamacare, cutting spending, slashing regulatory state, deporting illegals, and rooting out corruption!!

Democrats say every woman has a right to be believed: 		Unless you're raped by Bill Clinton 	Beaten by Keith Ellison 	Groped by Corey Booker 	Or Killed by Ted Kennedy
Judge Kavanaugh: Decades old high school misconduct allegation with zero facts, zero witnesses, and decades of silence 		Democrats demand he resign		Rep Keith Ellison and deputy chair of DNC: 911 calls that prove he beat his girlfriend recently		Democrats completely silent
If Kavanaugh‚Äòs accuser had no political agenda why did she take her complaint to politicians not law enforcement?		ü§î
They tried slandering him as a extremist	They tried painting him as a racist	They tried disrupting his hearings	They tried calling for delays	They tried protesting Senate offices		Now they bring up 35 yr old accusations to destroy a sterling man		The left will do anything to win
Dianne Feinstein did not want Bill Clinton impeached over allegations supported by DNA evidence 		However, she does want Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation vote delayed over an unsupported allegation and stays silent on Keith Ellison‚Äôs documented abuse		Politically motivated hack
Senate Republicans:		DO NOT CAVE!		If you were up for this nomination I bet many of you would have plenty of these fake accusations come up. Stand by our guy. Do not waver. Do not give the sinister left the victory they so desire		Confirm. Kavanaugh.

Breaking: 		Kavanaugh says he has calendars from 1982 that exonerate him and show his accuser's story doesn't match up at all.		I am so impressed he has 35 year old high school calendars		This is definitely the type of guy we need on the Supreme Court
Facts:		Dr. Ford has zero evidence, zero witnesses, zero people she told over 30 years, and the one person she said that was a the party just broke silence saying:		She never once met Kavanaugh 	The party never happened 	Allegations were a shock to her	Offers no support of Ford
"Experts" said Trump would lose in historic fashion (Huge win)		'Experts" said Trump will start war with N. Korea (Close to peace)		"Experts" said tax cut will ruin economy (Record growth)		"Experts" said Trump would be horrible for black community (lowest ever unemployment)
I cannot wait for SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Kavanaugh to rule with courage, clarity, and conviction for the next 40 years		Only thing stopping him is a few Republican Senators putting themselves over the country 		Confirm Kavanaugh to save the rule of law as we know it
Socialism can be summed up in a single sentence:		Hate the man that is better off than you are

Trump should nominate Hillary to the Supreme Court so we can finally have the FBI investigate her
Of course the Democrats want the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh:		Knowing them they will have a DNC law firm pay for a fake dossier against Kavanaugh, lie to a judge to get a fake warrant all to then have top level agents sabotage the investigation and lie about it under oath
It is rare I go out of my way to compliment Senate Republican Leadership		But if Kavanaugh is indeed confirmed Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley deserve endless praise and to be forever in the history books for overcoming this insane hit job by the sinister left

Last week, ICE arrested 16 illegal aliens in New York as part of Operation SOAR (Sex Offender Alien Removal)		Among those arrested:		Illegal Aliens accused of having sex with children under the age of 11, 16, and 13		Why do Democrats put Illegal Aliens over American children?		ü§î

What does Dr. Ford want a FBI investigation into?		The fact she can‚Äôt remember the date or time or place this happened? The fact there were zero witnesses? The fact it‚Äôs 35 yrs old? The fact her story keeps changing? The fact she told no one for 30 years?		This is a delay tactic

Hey Professor Ford, if you really wanted an FBI investigation into this alleged incident why didn‚Äôt you mention this ONCE in the last 35 years?		ü§î

If Democrats truly found these allegations so disturbing why did they wait till the week of the vote to come out with them?		Answer: 		They didn't want Kavanaugh to have the ability to clear this up during his hearings. They wanted a delay, chaos, and to sabotage him.

Protestors that continually interupt Senate confirmation hearings should be arrested and never be allowed back		#LockThemUp
Do you notice that Diane Feinstein doesn't take any of her time to denounce the protests or screaming happening in the room? Instead she uses her time to praise Al Sharpton (tax fraud) who most likely helped organize the paid chaos happening in the room.
Do you ever notice how conservatives never interrupt confirmation hearings by trying to prevent them from happening?		Democrats are intolerant people who cannot stand the idea other ideas exist.
How can Democrats oppose Kavanaugh with such conviction when they didn‚Äôt even take the time or courtesy to meet with him?		ü§î

Today a judge dismissed all of the charges against the Muslim terrorists who were training kids to shoot up schools despite a dead kid being found on the property and plans to attack a hospital		Meanwhile Paul Manafort faces 80 years in prison for tax fraud		What a sick disgrace
Trump just cut $200 million in aid to the Palestinians		This is absolutely wonderful. They are a terror proxy determined to destroy Israel and America		The Palestinian Authority gives cash to killers by sending the families of terrorists monthly checks when they kill Jews - sick!
If a Republican DOJ and FBI leaked info to the press and used those same press stories to justify getting FISA warrants to spy on Obama or Hillary campaign, people would be in prison by now and the media would be declaring it worse than Watergate

Heart-wrenching tweet from the beautiful Mollie Tibbetts	She was a godly, Christian, peaceful, innocent, victim of a crime of an illegal alien animal 	I am sick to my stomach over this. https://t.co/2P14z5RfxC
Did you know:		There are 42,034 illegals in federal prison		Democrats fight very hard for illegals, like Christian Rivera who murdered Mollie Tibbetts		Democrats are the party of crime and illegals		 They cannot be trusted with power
Mollie Tibbetts was brutally murdered by an illegal alien		The media will quickly move past this tragedy as it doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative		Similar to how we will never hear about the ISIS school shooting training compound in New Mexico again.
Mollie Tibbett‚Äôs family should sue the @ACLU by preventing ICE from doing their jobs to find illegal aliens like Christian Rivera		The ACLU fights very hard every day to keep these criminals in America. And Mollie is now dead at the hands of another illegal alien criminal
Beautiful Molly Tibbetts was brutally killed by an illegal alien		He should have been deported. He shouldn‚Äôt never have been allowed in America		Democrats want to have more people like the illegal animal Christian Rivera in America - they fight hard for people like him

Democrats now want to abolish ICE		Did you know, ICE has been instrumental in arresting, convicting, &amp; deporting child sex traffickers?		Democrats care much more about foreign nationals illegally in America than they do US citizens

A ‚Äúfetus‚Äù  in the womb has: 		‚Ä¢ quarts of a different blood type	‚Ä¢ separate heartbeat	‚Ä¢ separate brain activity 	‚Ä¢ unique DNA	‚Ä¢ different race	‚Ä¢ different gender		We didn‚Äôt know most of this when roe VS Wade was decided 		#MarchForScience
There are only two genders 		Race is a made up concept 		A fetus is a human life 		It is debated our contribution to rising global temperatures 		Men are better at some things than women, women are better at other things than men 		This is all science. 		#marchforscience
The concept of race is totally made up. It is not rooted in genetics or science 		Yet the left wants us to allow people into college based on race 		Support groups that are race based: Black Lives Matter etc 		Why is the left so obsessed with something not rooted in science? ü§î
Trump is the worst ‚ÄúRussian puppet ever‚Äù		Directly defies Russian wishes in Syria		Expels Russian diplomats 		Puts sanctions on Russia 		Expands missle defense capabilities near Crimea 		Strengthens NATO against Russian aggression
You are a moron. War Powers Act of 1973 clearly allows a President 60 days to use military force until having to go in front of Congress. Every President has used this authority constitutionally over the past 40 years, including Obama where you stayed selectively silent. https://t.co/4aGlmfmAx1
Assad is an animal. 		War is a horrible horrible thing, but if not America, then who else will prevent evil dictators like him from using these weapons against civilians?

Comey under oath March 2017: 		"In regards to the President's tweets about him being wiretapped I have no information that supports those tweets as we have looked carefully inside the FBI"		This would be called perjury. 		Comey knew about the wiretapping, and denied it.

Instead of patrolling the borders of other countries, our troops rightfully should be placed on the southern border and defend America 		Love that Trump is issuing an order to secure our southern border!!

If illegal immigrants tended to vote Republican, the Democrats would be calling for mass deportations and demanding a wall be built

If gun control worked, Chicago wouldn't have had 625 gun deaths last year. Almost all of them were with handguns, not "assault rifles"		We have a systemic culture problem in America that is a result of failing public schools and government programs that keep people poor

Odds of winning the Powerball lottery: 1 in 292,000,000		Odds of being killed by a gun in school since 1999: 1 in 614,000,000		Schools are also MUCH safer than they were in the 1990‚Äôs		Use facts, not emotions when trying to make major policy decisions

I never thought the fact that men and women are different would be something people would disagree with 		You can thank our infected colleges for this nonsense
Wait, the same government that had police officers stand and do nothing now want to take our guns away from us?
If a police officer sits idly by while murder is being committed they should go to prison 		Blood is on their hands
I'm so sick of lawful, patriotic, and ethical @NRA members getting blamed for the actions of a lunatic while our own government failed to protect our kids
Why is it the NRA's fault that the FBI did nothing, the local police did nothing, and the Sheriff Deputies stood and did nothing while kids were killed?

The FBI was notified twice 		Florida authorities visited him over 30 times 		Three Sheriff deputies stood and did nothing for minutes while killing ensued 		And this is the government that now wants to keep us safe?
I don‚Äôt have enough faith to be an atheist 		Atheism is rooted in hubris, and as the world adds more atheists the moral fiber of our civilization will continue to decay 		And the more atheists there are in the world, the bigger government will grow 		Atheism must be defeated https://t.co/2JZtmPXs6N
I cannot say enough good things about @jordanbpeterson 		He speaks truth so clearly and courageously 		He has opened my eyes in so many ways
Media seems focused on the @NRA influence in politics 		It is strange I don't hear the media ever mentioning labor unions or Planned Parenthood spending tens of millions of dollars to buy Democrats
Conservatives should not give money to higher education or their alma mater with a few exceptions 		Do not give your hard earned resources to the very institutions committed to advancing ideas that will destroy America
We should defund all foreign "aid" to countries that burn the US Flag

Once you give up your freedom, don‚Äôt expect to get it back
The balance between the appearance of security &amp; the reality of freedom has always been at the center of our political debate		If history is any guide we must be extremely careful in curbing freedom just because we believe it will make us safer		Be careful giving up your freedom
After a year of baseless witch hunts and expensive investigations the only thing we know for certain is that Obama promised Russia flexibility after his election and Hillary sold our uranium in exchange for cash to her foundation 		The Democrats colluded with Russia

The 2nd amendment is not for hunting.

One of the most disgusting and evil descriptions of our time is when people say ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler‚Äù 		This cheapens the evil of Hitler and turns a blind eye to the horrors of the Holocaust 		We must never forget the great evil of the 20th century and never allow it to happen again https://t.co/O6sDs9CS7D
We defend our President, members of Congress, our governors, sporting events, factories, airports, train stations, banks, jewelry stores, courts, celebrities, and athletes with guns 		Why won‚Äôt we defend our schools the same way? ü§î
Cops were sent to Cruz‚Äôs house 36 times, FBI was warned twice, and he was expelled from school, but somehow this is the @NRA at fault and a gun issue? ü§î
Do automobile companies get blamed for the tens of thousands of car deaths each year? 		Do liquor companies get blamed for the thousands of DUI‚Äôs each year? 		Does the @ACLU get blamed for the rise in ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù? 		Why then do we blame the @NRA for protecting our rights? ü§î
The cities with the most gun murders are also the ones with the strictest gun laws and also happen to be run by Democrat city councils with Democrat mayors
The AR in AR-15 doesn't stand for "assault rifle" 		That is a made up term by anti-freedom advocates that have no idea what they are talking about
A vast majority of gun deaths in America are with handguns, and 2/3 of gun deaths are death via suicide (still tragic, yet we are only country that counts that as a "gun" death) 		Deaths by gun in 2016: 		Handguns: 7,105	Rifles: 374	Shotguns: 262	Other guns: 186
If gun control worked, Chicago wouldn't have had 625 gun deaths last year. Almost all of them were with handguns, not "assault rifles"		We have a systemic culture problem in America that is a result of failing public schools and government programs that keep people poor

In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. The Obama administration prosecuted only 44 of them
It is incredible how little celebs and the media actually know about guns or the second amendment 		The misinformation is astonishing
