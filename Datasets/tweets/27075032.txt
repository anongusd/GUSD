It‚Äôs just funny because quite a few people are saying Trump listens to Coulter and takes her so seriously when in fact you could argue that he‚Äôs actually ignored her for more than a year or so.
Seeing a lot of journalists/pundits ascribe way more power to Coulter than she has. It was likely the confluence of pro-Trump media (Limbaugh, Drudge, Foxxers, etc) on this issue, not one actor alone, that allowed things to reach a tipping point and maybe influence POTUS.
If @AnnCoulter alone had so much influence over Trump, a border wall would have happened a while ago. She‚Äôs been blistering in her critique of him over lack of wall for a LONG TIME. What was a bit diff this time was other prominent pro-Trump media joined her w/harsh criticism.

‚Äî@jonathanvswan: "Look I'm always grateful for good faith criticism. Advice, suggestions, how I could be a better reporter...But I think a lot of the criticism is phony &amp; some of the ppl who criticize me...they are quite insistent on aggregating my reporting when it's negative."

That said, does it really matter if Hannity is on the stage or not? Probably not. He's delivering a get out the vote message for Republican voters and his broadcast is likely reaching more viewers than the Trump rally will.
Hannity is at the Trump rally revving up the crowd as he does his show. He's not on the main stage, but on a set of his own.

I remember back in 2013 when Fox announced its new "breaking news division" and said Shep Smith would interrupt programming to cover breaking news "at a moment's notice." What happened to that concept? If 12 Mueller indictments didn't qualify, what does? https://t.co/7occaZmruc https://t.co/NaF9qqGfPm
Of note: CNN and MSNBC covering Mueller indictments with reporters and legal experts. Fox? That network is covering this big breaking news with pundits.
Over on Fox, commentators repeatedly noting Russia's meddling in election happened under Obama, and Rachel Campos Duffy points out, "There is still no evidence that Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians."
