I won swimsuit and onstage question prelims at Miss Georgia. My onstage question was “Why do you believe now is the time to advocate for female empowerment? My answer is below. 💖💖💖 https://t.co/mPcQnu3aVg
I went from being scared of wearing a swimsuit in public to winning four SS prelims out of five Miss Georgias. Guess what, Gretchen? Swimsuit empowered me. To be strong, to be a hard worker, to be dedicated and disciplined, to be healthy, and to be CONFIDENT IN WHO I AM. ❤️✨ https://t.co/PQgVTha1Sn

I danced my HEART out &amp; got to be Carmen once again. 💃🏻 At first, performing as a fiery, strong, passionate woman like Carmen simply felt like acting out a role. Slowly but surely, over 3 years, I finally learned to personify Carmen in every essence. I love &amp; will miss her. https://t.co/ibcCirszNG
I checked in to my final Miss GA after years of hard work. I prayed God would use me to inspire. God wouldn’t use me to inspire by victory, but by showing grace in defeat. He knew I was strong enough to be an example that so many women facing rejection need. And it was an honor. https://t.co/J2ljdEJD35
I took a Miss Georgia headshot with a plain white camisole top, straight hair, and no earrings. That may seem silly and simple, but, in a world full of sparkly gowns, curls, and big jewelry, it isn’t. This was about being raw, real, and authentic. BROOKE, with no embellishments. https://t.co/G2FXiZJCdL
And community service. People always say that Miss America should be able to “get down on the floor with children” as if that’s some special, rare quality. To me, that’s just normal. As a dance instructor, volunteer, and human...it’s always been for the kids. I hope I inspired❤️ https://t.co/TMfHkq23tO

As we approach 2019, I like to reflect back on the year I’ve had and what I’ve learned. What’s the most important lesson you learned in 2018?		Mine is threefold: Trust the Lord, be patient with yourself, and never take those you love or the time you have with them for granted. 💛
@JJFurb @JerryDunleavy I only say this because I have seen God do things in my life and the lives of those close to me that only God could do. I pray that He blesses your life, too. 😊🙏🏼		“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Hebrews 11:1
I don’t deserve God’s unending grace, but He freely gives it, anyway.		I don’t deserve God’s unlimited forgiveness, but He continues to forgive me, anyway.		I don’t deserve God’s guidance when I’ve so often failed to listen...yet He keeps on guiding me, anyway.		That’s love. ❤️

A close friend of mine lost a loved one this Christmas weekend after they took their own life. The holidays really can be difficult for a lot of people, and it’s okay not to be okay. Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255. Call it, please, and know that you are loved.
@juanita_granger ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If you have any prayer requests for yourself or those you know, please message me. God bless you all, and I wish you the happiest of holidays and a wonderful New Year. ❤️💚
I hope those of you who wish this year had been better - financially, spiritually, physically, etc. - find renewed hope in the promise of a New Year, fresh start, and the Lord’s promise of answered prayers for the faithful. It is never too late for God. Don’t give up on yourself.
I hope those of you full of sorrow this Christmas for loved ones no longer here can find peace and happiness in memories they left behind and comfort in knowing that those we love are never truly gone. Though they have left this earth, their spirit lives on in the Lord’s kingdom.
I also pray that, if you do not yet know Christ as your savior and God as your Father, you’ll take time this holiday season to reflect on His word and understand how much we all need Him and His grace. I pray that you will find hope, strength, and a new beginning in His love.
Jesus suffered more than we can ever imagine, but he did so, not unafriad, but unwaveringly in his faith and his love for us. His sacrifice was given so that we may be forgiven for our sins and become closer to the Lord, as his children, saved by Jesus Christ’s flesh and blood.
First, I hope that you remember the real reason for the season. I hope that you realize how much God loves each and everyone one of us, to have sent His son to live among us and to die on the cross so that we might be saved. His forgiveness, mercy, grace, and love are endless.
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. - John 1:14		Merry Christmas to you all. Here’s a thread on what I hope for you this Christmas:

I don’t think a single person in the state wanted to see them go. This was all about a nasty power grab by Gretchen. These people have changed my life more than they’ll ever understand, and I am forever grateful to them and to have competed in their last Miss Georgia Pageant.
I found out today that the entire board of directors of the Miss Georgia Organziation has been forced to resign. This is heartbreaking and disgusting. These are such incredible people who volunteered years and years of their lives to women competing in Miss Georgia.

If you don’t like pageants, don’t watch. If seeing women who have worked tirelessly to be poised, in shape, well-spoken, educated, and elegant makes you uncomfortable, turn the channel. But don’t bash something that has changed the lives of women all over the world. 👑👑👑
Before pageantry, I had no idea what I wanted. It was PAGEANTS that helped me find my voice and gain the confidence (and money) I needed to go to college and pursue a career in politics. It empowered me. It emboldened me. It taught me to embrace both my femininity AND strength.
How about we praise women that pursue their dreams, whatever they are, through hard work and determination? Beautiful, bright, intelligent, passionate women committed to being role models while proving women can be glamorous AND go to law school AND change the world all at once?
Reading the comments on articles about pageants makes me want to throw up. Y’all want to act like you’re all about women empowerment - until women want to celebrate being able to have brains AND beauty at the same time. Then suddenly we’re backwards thinking. Seriously?

So if you’re in a relationship with someone that hurts you, and you express those feelings and end up finding yourself taking the blame and apologizing for feeling the way you feel, please please stop blaming yourself and recognize that you deserve honesty and openness. ❤️
But being forced to suppress your emotions - or literally being told flat out that your emotions are wrong and you shouldn’t be feeling them and that YOU are the problem, not the person that CAUSED your negative emotion(s) - is one hundred percent emotional abuse, full stop.
Narcissistic and dismissive behavior very easily leads to emotional abuse, but it’s a kind of abuse that is so so easy to disguise because it’s literally founded upon the idea of NOT TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS - so it sounds crazy to label it as “emotional.”
I honestly don’t think we talk enough about the fact that men who don’t believe that feelings/emotions should be acknowledged or addressed are some of the most toxic people you can try to have a relationship with.
