Acting AG Whitaker must appear before @HouseJudiciary.

We will hold the Administration accountable for these actions, and as Chairman of @HouseJudiciary, I intend to use all means necessary to get to the bottom of this injustice.
Prior to the new Congress, @HouseJudiciary put officials on notice that we will investigate the family separation policy and the longstanding damage it has had on families. https://t.co/ku7GN1KS6l
At the end of the 115th Congress, @JudiciaryGOP scheduled its only oversight hearing with @DHSgov. Again, @SecNielsen denied the existence of a family separation policy, making it clear that DHS was either incompetent, or grossly negligent, in the implementation of this policy.
After the visit, I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which prohibits the cruel policy of separating children from their parents. Over 190 @HouseDemocrats supported the bill. Unsurprisingly, @HouseGOP refused to bring it up for a vote. https://t.co/VroomF9mQZ

You can be sure that, beginning in January, this Committee intends to do its job, in a fair, but firm, manner. The time for zero accountability is over, and we are determined to ensure that @DHSgov‚Äôs policies and practices are aligned with the laws and values of the nation.
We must also conduct much-needed oversight over the disastrous family separation policy. Not only was the policy abhorrent, it is clear that DHS was either incompetent, or grossly negligent, in its implementation, which only compounded the trauma inflicted on innocent children.
The Administration‚Äôs dangerous and chaotic policies have caused desperate people to use desperate means to find protection for themselves and for their children.
The fact that U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection does not conduct a full medical examination of people it holds in its custody is outrageous and is a policy that should be changed today.
As we move into the next Congress, I want to put you and your department on notice: the time for accountability has arrived.

4. The #NunesMemo shows that House Republicans are now part and parcel to an organized effort to obstruct the Special Counsel's investigation.
3. The #NunesMemo provides no credible basis whatsoever for removing Rod Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General.
2. Christopher Steele is a recognized expert on Russia and organized crime. The #NunesMemo does not provide a single shred of evidence that any aspect of the Steele dossier is false or inaccurate in any way.
1. The FISA court found probable cause to believe that Carter Page is an agent of a foreign power. Nothing in the #NunesMemo rules out the possibility that considerable evidence beyond the Steele dossier helped the court reach that conclusion.

We urge our Republican colleagues to finally put country above party and work with us to protect the institutions at the core of our democracy. #NunesMemo
Republicans, for their part, have done nothing to hold a reckless Administration accountable for its actions. At the very least, they should have the courage to join us in protecting Special Counsel Mueller from political interference until this investigation is complete.
These institutions were in place long before @realDonaldTrump became president, and they will continue to exist long after he leaves ‚Äì though not before President Trump makes his best attempt to irrevocably damage them. #NunesMemo
Instead of cooperating with a legitimate and serious investigation, President Trump has decided to attack and undermine the institutions and personnel dedicated to upholding the rule of law.
With the release of #NunesMemo‚Äîa deliberately misleading document that politicizes and distorts highly classified info in order to discredit our intel and law enforcement agencies‚ÄîTrump has successfully added Republicans as accessories to his continuing obstruction of justice.
House Republicans have put the President‚Äôs self-interest and their own political objectives above the needs of the country. #NunesMemo
Releasing these Nunes talking points‚Äîlikely prepared in coordination with the Trump White House‚Äîconstitutes a deliberate and active complicity in the Administration‚Äôs attempts to undermine the Special Counsel and the FBI.
This Republican campaign is a betrayal of the American people. #NunesMemo
House Republicans are now accomplices to a shocking campaign to obstruct the work of the Special Counsel, to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the Justice Department and the FBI, and to bury the fact that a foreign adversary interfered with our last election.
President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to allow the release of Chairman Nunes‚Äô Republican talking points is part of a coordinated propaganda effort to discredit, disable and defeat the Russia investigation.

@HouseJudiciary @FBI @realDonaldTrump "When @realDonaldTrump says, ‚Äúthe @FBI person really reports directly to the @POTUS,‚Äù it is your job to tell him that the Director of the FBI has reported to the Attorney General since the founding of the Bureau, and that Presidents should not comment on pending cases."
@HouseJudiciary @FBI "In this moment, Director Wray, your responsibility is not only to defend the @FBI, but to push back against @realDonaldTrump when he is so clearly wrong ‚Äî both on the facts and as a matter of principle."

Resolutions of Inquiry r nothing more than simple request for info from Exec Branch.  If GOP votes "no" they don't want the truth.  Simple. https://t.co/Cn2nlyeWKh
So on #Trumprussia or biz conflicts etc, GOP must decide:  will they vote 4 the truth or complicity?  Either way, they are #ontherecord. https://t.co/Cn2nlyeWKh
Why r Resolutions of Inquiry important? B/c GOP can't avoid a vote, either in committee or on the floor. Other types of bills they can duck.

My statement from our press conference earlier today on #Trumprussia #ResolutionofInquiry 		https://t.co/jSoMo9JXPF
GOPers, no matter the time we get 2 vote on #Trumprussia #ResolutionofInquiry today, the eyes of the nation will be upon you. #ontherecord
On bright side, today's Jud Comm markup is a window into nuts/bolts of lawmaking. &amp; the huge power that the majority party has 2 set agenda.
My GOP friends have heard loud &amp; clear from constituents 2 #DoYourJob.  On #ResolutionofInquiry will they vote for truth or complicity?
No matter any delays tactics, the members of Jud Comm will vote and be put on the record re: #Trumprussia today.  #ResolutionofInquiry
RT @RepBarbaraLee: The people demand answers! @HouseGOP must stop concealing Trump‚Äôs conflicts of interests &amp; support @RepJerryNadler‚Äôs #Re‚Ä¶
Continuing w/ amendments on the King substitute amendment 2 the underlying health care bill.  This 1 re important issue of elder abuse.
If you are just tuning in, the Committee hasn't yet considered the #ResolutionofInquiry.  GOP chose to do other things 1st.
Another note 2 my GOP colleagues:  our #ResolutionofInquiry = a simple request 4 info on #Trumprussia etc.  Should be no reason 2 oppose.
Just got word from @HouseGOP calling floor votes @ 1:45pm EST.  Now wondering whether Jud Comm leadership will try 2 delay until after that.
Just a quick note 2 my GOP friends on the Committee:  I'm delivering over 800k sigs today I received supporting our #ResolutionofInquiry .
RT @Public_Citizen: Right now @RepJerryNadler is calling out committee chair for scheduling the #ResolutionofInquiry last even though many‚Ä¶
I'm not offering my 2 amendments on the health care bill so as to save time &amp; get to the #ResolutionofInquiry #HR111 as soon as possible.
What's happening now?  We r now discussing Mr. Conyers' amendment 2 Mr. King's substitute amendment on the underlying health care bill.
RT @RepSwalwell: Search for the truth around #TrumpRussia questions continues in @HouseJudiciary Committee. I'm w/ @RepJerryNadler's Resolu‚Ä¶
As a counter 2 any delay tactics on our #ResolutionofInquiry let's grow # of witnesses.  Here's the link:  https://t.co/edw8Fn5XUK Please RT
Again, here is the link to watch live:	https://t.co/edw8Fn5XUK	#ResolutionofInquiry
Taking bets on whether GOP Jud Comm leader pushes #ResolutionofInquiry #HR111 until after lunch break 2 try 2 further reduce eyes on them.
Now another health care bill.
@davidcicilline asks the Chair if we can take up our #ResolutionofInquiry now.  @BobGoodlatte6 says no.
RT @BrianLehrer: Inquiry demands DOJ to turn over documents to the House "if there is a criminal or counter intel investigation going on,"‚Ä¶
But no matter any delay tactics, be assured:  There will be a debate/vote today on our #ResolutionofInquiry.
Those who want 2 bury our #ResolutionofInquiry want u to get bored &amp; turn away from watching so they can vote without your witnessing.
Committee is taking up a # of items today, beyond our #ResolutionofInquiry.  Mostly health care items.  Chair has chosen 2 take those 1st.
Here again is the link to watch House Judiciary Committee action (# of agenda items up b4 #ResolutionofInquiry)	https://t.co/edw8Fn5XUK
I sense GOP thinks it best 2 try to bury our reso by doing  late as possible today.  But America won't tire, be distracted by these tactics.
We just voted on procedure for a panel 4 tomorrow's hearing.  Now, Chairman is beginning w/ a GOP bill re: health care/med malpractice.
Here we go!  Gaveling in.
