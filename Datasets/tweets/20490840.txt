What’s are you guys up to today?
Have a great weekend everyone!
I never had the honor of meeting John McCain, but I respect what he did for our country.  Senator McMain will be missed.
I will be supporting @RonDeSantisFL for Florida Governor, I believe he is the right man for the job. I also support @ScottforFlorida for senate, make sure you vote and keep FL Red!
I recently visited @Orlando_Nissan and it was one of the worst experiences me and my team had from the staff to the tactics they used to sell their vehicles. Stay away!
FL make sure you register to vote if you want to VOTE during the primaries this August. Very important! https://t.co/EHZzImYh8f

Will be watching the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump give his #SOTU don’t miss it!
While I applaud Senator Rubio for swift action the ultimate responsibility always lies at the head and it would have just been great to have such oversight that this never would have happened in the 1st place!
