Because it's, well, very incorrect to say that states want to modernize systems that they'll later want to "un-modernize."		They want to modernize essential technology like voter registration databases. They want to *move away from* nonessential technology like DREs.
A top House GOP appropriator opposes giving states more election security $$.		Tom Graves referenced HAVA: "Are we to spend another $4 billion to modernize things we want to un-modernize again?"		Seems like he doesn't know what states want the new $$ for.		https://t.co/yd4x6IHJfS

The EAC chair rotates between commissioners of the two parties.		Tom Hicks, a Democrat, had been chairman for the past year.		The other Republican besides McCormick is Don Palmer, who was just confirmed to the commission.		McCormick previously served as chair in 2015-2016.
@MikeIsaac de-kek-ko, send tweet
@JessicaHuseman Some more of Jessica's reporting about McCormick's conduct as an EAC commissioner. https://t.co/NP6vq6Qzh2
McCormick has never retracted this extraordinary statement, and in fact, according to @JessicaHuseman's excellent reporting, she has continued telling local Republican officials that "Russian intervention should not be a subject of concern."		https://t.co/udLkV9UVbx https://t.co/vJdGL420Ru
"This declassified report was not about the November elections," McCormick said at the time. "It was about politics."
In a remarkable attack on a fellow executive-branch official, McCormick described then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson as "delusional or naive" for citing UN agreements in his pitch to states about the critical infrastructure designation. https://t.co/gWUsUaAmfM

(This seems like a step back from yesterday's tweets, where he indicated that he didn't want to sign the EO banning Chinese telecoms that his staff has prepared. Given that the grounds for the EO are security, he seems to be giving himself an out.)
Missed this earlier. Trump on blocking Chinese telecoms:		"I don't want to use artificial blocking. We want to have great 5G. ... I don't want to block out anybody if we can help it. Now, if there's going to be a security reason or something, then we have no choice." https://t.co/jEculd3p8J

So you end up in the situation we're in now, where states and cities see BMDs as the best of both worlds, security and accessibility.		Which means trusting that your barcode actually contains your vote choices — something that most experts say simply cannot be guaranteed.
But many people with disabilities can't vote on plain paper ballots, and they need to be able to vote.		Election security experts encourage precincts to buy mostly paper machines, with a few BMDs for accessibility.		But some disability-rights advocates say that's discriminatory.
A hacker who compromises a BMD may be able to trick the machine into spitting out a piece of paper that has one set of votes contained in the barcode — which is actually tallied — and another set of votes contained in the text that voters check.
.@jhalderm added, "We simply don't know whether BMDs can generate a paper trail that's sufficiently hard for attackers to manipulate. They're a relatively new and untested technology."
BMDs are popular b/c they appear to combine the security of paper systems w/ the accessibility of electronic ones.		But as @mattblaze told me, relying on barcodes "basically turns the system into one that has all of the well-known problems that paperless...voting machines have."
From Pennsylvania to Georgia, states racing to ditch their paperless voting machines are switching to a controversial alternative: ballot-marking devices, which rely on barcodes that experts say are vulnerable to hackers.		My new story: https://t.co/lgKFIo8zhC

Large companies, some of whom are represented on the task force's working groups, devote significant attention to supply chain risk.		What the task force will have to figure out is, how do we get the rest of the private sector to do the same?		All it takes is one weak link...
The task force, announced last year at a DHS cyber summit, is part of the government's attempt to understand the risks of the technology used in critical sectors like telecommunications, energy, and IT.
Scoop: I got the schedule for upcoming meetings of DHS's supply chain task force.		The four working groups will hold kickoff meetings later this month (plus I have the list of their industry co-chairs), while the full task force will meet on March 11.		🔒 https://t.co/ZIy6Hj3ahz

Gingrich got back to me after this story was published. Writing from Seoul, where he's getting a 5G briefing from Samsung, he told me he was "deeply concerned" about Huawei and "actively urging the government at every level to move as rapidly as possible" before MWC.
From my scoop on Trump's forthcoming telecom EO:		At one point, @SecPompeo planned to attend #MWC19 to show allies how seriously the U.S. takes supply chain security. @newtgingrich called him and pressed him on the admin's 5G security plans.		https://t.co/QiHjxIR9rz

@BradSchweer I know I'm right. I read Playbook every day and saw that story. :)
@BradSchweer show me in that article where kelly and ferrante are named
@BradSchweer not references to them specifically
Not sure where Gohmert got his information from, but he was definitely reading from something as he spoke.
1. Jordan Kelly left the NSC in January. She now works at a consulting firm.		2. Anthony's last name is spelled "Ferrante."		3. Ferrante doesn't have a security firm. He works at the same consulting firm as Kelly.		Be careful trusting sites that make glaring mistakes like this. https://t.co/WYI80bXt2P
Since NSC Cyber is kind of my world, I thought I'd correct the relevant part of the article in case anyone following me works for Gohmert or other lawmakers tempted to credulously cite this report.
Happened to be listening to  Whitaker HJC hearing when Gohmert suggested that two former NSC cyber staffers might be deep-state plants.		I was confused — how did he even know who they were? — so I Googled &amp; found a right-wing article about Schiff trying to hire NSCers.		So...

But right now, it’s discussions with industry and really trying to understand the threat better.”
US raising 5G security concerns "at the highest diplomatic levels," @robstrayer said today at @CSIS, making sure foreign govts are "aware of ... what is at stake."		But US itself is still "trying to understand the full range of options," said @CostelloJK.		https://t.co/dawQwlDrek

@MikeTheRedleg @PepiSouthern @swin24 no
@brfreed @swin24 I was just responding to the point about replacing these guys
@PepiSouthern @swin24 yes, but next after Fairfax and Herring is the Republican state House speaker, so to prevent it from getting there, VA Dems would want Northam or his successor to appoint someone to fill the LtGov and AG spots
@JaredRizzi i do, every day, it's unsafe for me to even walk to work anymore
@JaredRizzi jared they're the same thing
@ditzkoff that was a close one. well, it wasn't a close one, but now it's a close one. but it was close to not being a close one.
@swin24 True, but with both chambers controlled by Republicans, how hard will it be to get replacements confirmed?
Worth noting that Leader McConnell is using the same "I did something that I regret, but now I'm a voice for racial justice" argument as Northam and Herring https://t.co/BwztWtwlFR

Someone's checking all of Kirk Cox's yearbooks and scrapbooks and Runescape guild Geocities pages, right?
@Sil_Lai @yashar Correction: Yancey is the delegate who won the tied race. Kirk Cox is the House speaker who would become governor.
@byrdinator strong endorse
@Sil_Lai @yashar Well, Yancey could still become governor if there are allegations or photos. He's not required to resign if that happens. But yes, that's the order.

Stats from DHS shared at this weekend's conference:		* 43 states have used at least one DHS election security service; 27 have used 2; 14 have used 3+; three have used 6+		* 143 cyber hygiene scans, 25 threat hunts, 36 RVAs, 23 resilience reviews		https://t.co/stJ8w451YJ

More of my new reporting from this weekend's NASS and NASED conferences:		* @mastersonmv is "very optimistic" that all states will be using paper ballots by 2020: https://t.co/zBhiUcJj0c		* He also says DHS and vendors have a "productive relationship": https://t.co/bU7bUkFb7Z
When @DelbertHosemann said MS didn't want federal money, @AlexPadilla4CA basically replied, That's great for you, but not everyone can afford to protect their systems without it.		"I would caution any state [not] to ... prevent other states benefiting from federal dollars.”
Also at NASS conf, secretaries of state like @VermontSOS, @KathyBoockvar, &amp; @JenaGriswold told Hill staffers that they needed more federal election security $$ pronto.		@amyklobuchar staffer told them to call their MoCs and apply pressure to get it done.		https://t.co/mW79JzJkyX
A new version of the Secure Elections Act is coming very soon, a SSCI staffer told secs of state this wknd.		Draft text expected "within the next few weeks."		But it's likely to be almost identical to a version criticized by election integrity activists.		https://t.co/mft3FLm3m6

@KimZetter Right. Maybe he'll get wins around the edges. Consider me skeptical but hopeful that he'll get wins where they matter most (e.g. where FB's bottom line is at stake).
@hacks4pancakes @KimZetter I have no doubt that EFF, Access Now, etc. will continue to assail FB for its mistakes no matter who it hires.
@HowellONeill @alexstamos @KimZetter Agreed.
@KimZetter If that is an accurate description of the conflict (and I think it is), I can't fathom how anyone could think that Nate and not *FB as an institution* would prevail.
@KimZetter I believe they want to make FB better, not help corrupt their former colleagues. I also believe Tim's right that this is mostly "wishful thinking" at a company like FB.
@alexstamos @KimZetter So do I! But I also want his arguments to win out, and Facebook's behavior doesn't provide evidence that that happens often.
@KimZetter My sense of Tim's point is that they won't, which seems correct to me.

Pennsylvania has already directed its counties to migrate to paper ballots, but today's report bolsters that plan and provides fresh recommendations across a wide range of areas, including protecting the state's voter registration database and training local election officials.
The commission also asked Congress to help Pennsylvania fund this massive project, but it warned the governor and the state legislature that they shouldn't wait for federal help.

Zuckerberg is merging the messaging technology underpinning Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram *and* requiring all three to use end-to-end encryption: https://t.co/exbUqypfvd
@malloryconlon LUNA
Lawson's staff are searching for records but have not dropped their exemption claims, according to docs that Susan shared with me. Unclear what they will eventually turn over.		But this dispute highlights a major grey area when it comes to transparency around election security.
.@SEGreenhalgh, who filed the records request, said her organization, @fixelections, is prepared to sue if Lawson's office doesn't fully comply with the law.		But it's unclear how a judge would interpret that law.		And secretaries in states with similar laws are surely watching.
Lawson's office gave me several explanations: NASS is a private organization; the emails contain trade secrets and copyrighted material; and many of the emails are marked classified or confidential.
Connie Lawson, IN's chief election official, was president of NASS during a critical period of state–federal relations and election security preparations for the midterms.		Her office says her comms w/ NASS are exempt from a public records request.
Scoop: Indiana's secretary of state is refusing to release her communications with NASS, hiding documents that could shed light on her and NASS's role in killing the Secure Elections Act and secretaries' relationship with voting vendors: https://t.co/BD6uELJka6

@bobmcmillan @gregotto @JohnHultquist @HowellONeill @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton Yes. It's edible material ensconced in dough that has been cooked to a bread-like consistency and form.
@ChuckWendig that should be self-evident
@selenalarson @kateconger @HowellONeill @gregotto @dellcam @foxbeacon @WilliamTurton selena we had such a good thing going here
@gregotto @JohnHultquist @HowellONeill @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton Greg is right

@HowellONeill @selenalarson @gregotto @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton you should be used to it given how often it occurs
@ChuckWendig send me a photo of it
@selenalarson @gregotto @HowellONeill @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton why do you say "sadly"
@ChuckWendig no. terrarium.
@dellcam @WilliamTurton @kateconger @sfkale @obsidiansec you are making up arbitrary rules, and plus you can eat a calzone without a knife and fork if you want to
@ChuckWendig leave me alone
@BryanDisagrees @kateconger @sfkale @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton no, a bun is sandwich bread, it is 1,000% closer to a piece of, say, wheat bread than to dumpling dough
@ChuckWendig i'm not getting in the terrarium
@Pianomover @kateconger @WilliamTurton no
@ChuckWendig first of all, what terrarium		second of all, you specifically said you'd preserve my life until the time of the slaughter, which is threatening in a way that a generic "i want to help save your life" is not
@BryanDisagrees @kateconger @sfkale @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton they are not sandwiches as their dough takes a different form from the dough (bread) used to ensconce sandwich ingredients
@kateconger @dalykyle @WilliamTurton i did not
@WilliamTurton @kateconger @sfkale @obsidiansec @dellcam very coherent argument will i am convinced
@HowellONeill @gregotto @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton greg don't listen to him
@ChuckWendig no, the threat is from the person promising to preserve me for that moment
@kateconger @sfkale @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton IT'S ENSCONCED HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS
@dalykyle @kateconger @WilliamTurton kyle, thank you
@obsidiansec @sfkale @kateconger @dellcam @WilliamTurton submarine sandwiches can be served on a variety of types of bread
@sfkale @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton a calzone is a sandwich
@gregotto @dellcam @foxbeacon @kateconger @WilliamTurton Greg....thank you. As a reward, I will not tweet that photo of you eating ice cream.
@ChuckWendig you want me to experience a slaughtering		that's a threat!
@ChuckWendig well I don't
@sfkale @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton in fact my argument is airtight and very perfect
@BryanDisagrees @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton @pbump i did not do that		i remain un-owned
@HowellONeill @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton pat your wife can see this
@ChuckWendig you're going to FORCE me to survive to a hellish moment, that's a threat
@sfkale @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton if they started life conceptually in their current form, they wouldn't be sandwiches, but they were created as transformations of standard sandwiches, so they retain their gastronomical taxonomy
@kateconger @BryanDisagrees @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton @pbump i've lost the thread here
@ChuckWendig yes, and that's what makes it threatening
@sfkale @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton they are, but only by virtue of their having been transformed from a standard "sandwich" state
@Pianomover @kateconger @WilliamTurton po' boy		lobster roll		cheesesteak
@ChuckWendig chuck, that's a threat
@sfkale @kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton no, the cheese/meat/sauce is not ensconced
@alneuhauser @dellcam @kateconger @WilliamTurton alan, thank you
@kateconger @obsidiansec @dellcam @WilliamTurton it's an edible substance ensconced — "sandwiched," one might say — in bread		that's a sandwich
@foxbeacon @dellcam @kateconger @WilliamTurton what
@obsidiansec @kateconger @dellcam @WilliamTurton a sandwich
@dellcam @kateconger @WilliamTurton that looks great
@Steee_ve @ChuckWendig but some will be alive at the moment before it happens

@DoryceS Enjoy!
@brian_nov those will be Aquaman books in 20 years though
@KeithChu this I know
@NSlayton @admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks I am sorry we disagree about a movie. We will get through this.
@KeithChu Keith are you retweeting yourself
@NSlayton @admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks also I'm instantly suspicious of anyone who enjoyed Aquaman https://t.co/Y8FMHfrxWr
@NSlayton @admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks The fact is that most movies are forgettable. And that's fine! They're supposed to entertain for a little while and then recede into the past. New movies are made. Not everything can be Star Wars or James Bond where it goes on forever.
@brian_nov @admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks true
@NSlayton @admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks You literally just saw Aquaman! Talk to me in 10 years.
If the reason it's remembered is because of its technical prowess and not because its content still resonates with people, that's a forgettable movie in the social/cultural context.
@admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks It definitely *was* a major movie 10 years ago, and it absolutely changed moviemaking. But it's no longer part of the public consciousness. This conversation started with me comparing it to Aquaman in terms of its forgettability.
Probably just a coincidence that the tabloid with which the president allegedly engaged in an illegal conspiracy to influence the election is now going after one of the president's top enemies. https://t.co/1DEXTiLPxY
@admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks What metric are you using for impact?
@admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks I suspect the spectacle is all that virtually everyone remembers about the movie, if they remember anything at all. And that's my point.
@TSMaddocks @eleventhirtyate Forbes should pick a better term than "event movie" then
@admiraljello @eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks It's not, though. I'm sure the rides are fun. But people aren't there for the story. Avatar is not a cultural phenomenon.
@eleventhirtyate @TSMaddocks Exactly. Sure it made a lot of money, but it sounds like an eminently forgettable film. Avatar outgrossed Star Wars but no one remembers a single character name from Avatar.
@eleventhirtyate Like, who calls Aquaman a major film alongside The Last Jedi and Infinity War?
@eleventhirtyate Lol Aquaman

@Harry4naris this began in 2016
How does a supply chain cyberattack on the U.S. energy sector actually work? This WSJ story provides great examples.		"Russian government hackers likely remain inside some systems, undetected and awaiting further orders."		https://t.co/nE2LKtGOgQ https://t.co/l8E2pkFSy6
@archstreetllc Without getting into these quibbles, even the least of these examples is more than what the feds are doing in election security, which was my original point.
@archstreetllc Here's another: https://t.co/zCD2uWMRUd
@archstreetllc The SEC is a financial regulator and issued guidance about a cybersecurity-related regulatory requirement. I'd say that counts.
@archstreetllc https://t.co/poiddJbnk4
@archstreetllc (I am not taking a position. I am reporting.)
@archstreetllc There are absolutely basic financial services regulations. I'm not sure what you're talking about there.
@swin24 you're making me hate the media
@archstreetllc The difference being, as I said, that it sets basic uniform standards in other sectors and chooses not to do so here.
@ASankin wow, v creative
@archstreetllc that delegation is qualitatively and quantitatively different in election security though
@ASankin aaron...pls
The commission has just approved the amended recommendations. Three commission members dissented, including Lee.
@archstreetllc Executed, yes. But the policies and regulatory guardrails come from the feds, unlike with election security.
@archstreetllc NRC, FERC, DOE, TSA, DOT, DoD — lots of federal oversight and regulation of these sectors
@archstreetllc elections are far and away the most disproportionate vis-a-vis state vs. federal regulatory appetite
@archstreetllc not sure I agree; see e.g. grid, nuclear, transportation, DIB
@nationaljournal @BrendanBordelon "washington's meddling"
The federal government can do a lot to improve election security, but it's choosing to defer to the states on a lot of the work, even though it clearly has power under Article 1 Section 4 Clause 1.		So it's up to the states, where cybersecurity fluency is even more lacking.
This commission was created b/c GA's voting machines are so insecure that even the state govt could no longer ignore the problem.		But it's rejecting almost every suggestion from the only member with actual cybersecurity expertise.		Microcosm of election security in America.
The past hour in a nutshell: "In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. Next suggestion, Doctor Lee."
Lee offers another amendment — this one making it clear that only some commission members recommend using BMDs (current language makes it sound unanimous) — and this amendment fails too.
The commission votes 8-5 not to adopt Lee's language about the expert consensus on paper ballots.
Lee's point is that support for paper ballots is widespread, not just his pet position, and should be reflected as such in the commission's recommendations to the state legislature.
Sorry, the lawyer is Ryan Germany, general counsel for the Georgia Secretary of State. He is not the commission's lawyer. The chair was referring to him as "counsel."
Lawyer for commission agrees w/ this suggestion, saying it lets Lee say what he wants to say without getting bogged down in detailed edits.		Lee isn't having it. "I strongly object to his characterization of what I want to do," he says of the lawyer.
Lee proposes adding language to the recs noting that cyber experts and the public overwhelming support paper ballots (not BMDs).		Chair proposes instead adding Lee's text as his personal view at the end of the document, significantly watering down its effect.
@AshCrossan @DanielKennedyDK @heathdwilliams @Whataburger reasonable
@Steee_ve @JaredRizzi @ChuckWendig see this sounds dirty
@DanielKennedyDK @AshCrossan @heathdwilliams @Whataburger omfg
@JaredRizzi @ChuckWendig Why
@JaredRizzi @Steee_ve should we?
The commission's lone cyber expert, Dr. Wenke Lee, has proposed almost all of the amendments to the recommendations so far, and the commission has rejected most of them.
@Steee_ve @JaredRizzi yep
@JaredRizzi @Steee_ve jared i have anxiety okay i don't like meeting new people
@Steee_ve @JaredRizzi i keep trusting him, which is really my first mistake
@JaredRizzi @Steee_ve @ChuckWendig now see why
@Steee_ve @JaredRizzi as long as we don't tag him in
(The amendment passes. They are still tweaking the language of the draft recommendations, which AFAIK are not public yet.)
@JaredRizzi man, don't these two tweets just sum up the whole world
@JaredRizzi a loss for humanity and decency today
At GA commission mtg, lone cyber expert proposes amendment to recs adding language endorsing NIST standards.		Chair, unfamiliar with NIST, asks: "Have they ever done anything controversial?"		[laughter]		"I'm just trying to figure out who I'm fixing to endorse. It sounds legit."

@vote_Mfg_QA Voting security experts believe that these RFIs should be more granular than they are, even if they're not as specific as RFPs. Vendors could have included this information but simply chose not to.
@stphnfwlr I don't see any reason why a vendor couldn't put these things in their proposals. But if state lawmakers want to require them, that seems fine too.
@lachlan @NoahShachtman is this the war on christmas
@EMfys_Nest @nicolecieux this seems untrue
@nicolecieux @EMfys_Nest i'm uncertain
@EMfys_Nest @nicolecieux i don't know about this
@stphnfwlr It would be strange not to publish information about, say, vulnerability disclosure programs. The whole point of those programs is to publicize them.		Experts also highlighted several instances of unnecessary secrecy in these proposals.
@nicolecieux hmmm
@stphnfwlr Strange that they didn't commit to those things in writing.

@sparksjls this is not inconsistent if he expects mexico to pay in cash or via paypal
@cwarzel This is awesome. Congratulations Charlie.
Meanwhile, Brian Kemp, who's moving from secretary of state (top election official) to governor, has named the former top lobbyist for giant voting vendor ES&amp;S as his new deputy chief of staff.		But surely that won't affect how the state treats ES&amp;S.		https://t.co/SS1pEQCOtz
The vast majority of public comments at this commission meeting have been passionate pleas for paper-based voting systems.		One county election official argued for electronic voting, but cited only minor logistical problems with paper that can be solved. No mention of security.
Georgia's voting security commission is meeting right now before issuing recommendations for the state's new voting equipment.		But in today's @MorningCybersec, experts told me that the vendor proposals GA has received are full of problems.		https://t.co/T9MheYGx8B https://t.co/C6zEfUYhkq

Pakistan uses the Taliban to destabilize Afghanistan so it can maintain leverage in the region, the same way it uses Kashmiri militants to check India. Does Trump know this?
The Taliban, with which Trump wants to negotiate, is a Pakistani proxy force. The ISI funds it, Pakistani madrassas train its fighters, and Islamabad gives it sanctuary in the tribal regions. So in a sense, Pakistan is already in Afghanistan — and that's the problem. https://t.co/k7LNk9CfEP
