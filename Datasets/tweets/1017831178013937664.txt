@Pancho2504 @RepCohen @realDonaldTrump My issue is that I earned my Purple Heart on the battlefield.  @RepCohen referred to the tough questioning Peter Strzok received from Republicans as equal to Veterans have went through on the battlefield and in hospital beds recovering.

@Pancho2504 @RepCohen @realDonaldTrump I joined Twitter so that my voice would get through to @RepCohen.  Looks like it did.  He blocked me 1 hour and 30 min after I created my Twitter account.
@SP11_11_2018 The deep state’s reactions affirmed everything for me.
@SP11_11_2018 I didn’t trust any politician anymore.  Wasn’t sure about Trump.  Now I am.
@SP11_11_2018 Trust the plan 😉

@SP11_11_2018 Been unplugged for awhile.  Just catching up.
@KatrinaRulz @RepCohen @realDonaldTrump Good argument.  Pathetic actually.
@Roberta19687524 @RepCohen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/M967XTdvZa
@SP11_11_2018 Yes I did!  😁
@KatrinaRulz @RepCohen @realDonaldTrump Actually I joined Twitter today after failed attempts to email and phone @RepCohen.  Apparently he only takes email from people in his district.  I prefer to not be on social media but extreme situations call for extreme measures.
@RepCohen @realDonaldTrump And I just got blocked by @RepCohen.  I guess he doesn’t care about my opinion either.
@RepCohen @RepCohen your point was to compare the hardship of testifying before Congressional committee to that of the rigors of combat.  As a Purple Heart Recipient and 2x Iraq Veteran your original statement and subsequent apology only disgusts me and I hope you are removed from office.

@RepCohen @realDonaldTrump Before I listen to another thing you ever say, please explain to me why FBI Agent Peter Strzok deserves a Purple Heart?  Do you know what is required in order to be awarded the Purple Heart?  I do!  I was awarded the Purple Heart.  I am disgusted by your lack of understanding.
