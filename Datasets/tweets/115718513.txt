The implications of today will play out for the rest of Trump's term. 	1) Democrats will be more emboldened to call his bluff.	2) Republicans will be more wary to follow him into battle.	3) His base will see him in a way they haven't before.
800,000 federal workers will get repaid, but there will be no backpay for the 1 million + contractors.
This shutdown posed a modern-era test for the American economy - how long can the government demand people continue coming to work without pay? The answer appears to be roughly 3 weeks.

Trump has knocked the entire #G7Summit back on its heels. The schedule changes because of him. All the questions are about him. Every decision or lack of decision is due to him. He‚Äôs managed to transplant his disruptive approach to the world stage.
One thing Trump has done by lobbing Twitter grenades before arriving at the G7 is make his intentions very clear. In that respect, this isn‚Äôt really a festive atmosphere but there are also no illusions about where people stand. Sober and serious.
Trump and Conte were last to arrive for the ‚Äúfamily photo‚Äù at the G7. Trudeau had purposefully saved Trump a spot at center of the group, in between he and Merkel. Trump and Merkel lingered to talk after the others departed. She gestured with her hands.
European Council president Tusk at #G7Summit: ‚ÄúI see a lot of speculation about G6 plus 1 or G7 minus 1 or G7 plus 1. But let‚Äôs leave 7 as it is. It‚Äôs a lucky number.‚Äù
OMG DSP
Hours before he leaves (?) for the G7, Trump threatens multiple US allies with undisclosed tariffs and trade barriers. https://t.co/qDyQVxKj5J
Speaking with Canadian officials, it‚Äôs clear they take these insults from Trump very personally. They aren‚Äôt used to the New York City town hall rough and tumble stuff. They don‚Äôt shake these things off like US lawmakers do. Trudeau is now in a tough spot.
New #G7Summit update:	- Trump is leaving early	- Trudeau is trying to keep wheels of summit from falling off 	- Macron appears to be chomping for piece of POTUS 	- Much is the schedule appears fluid because of Trump‚Äôs tweets
Senior Canadian official says Trump is expected to leave #G7Summit before lunch on Saturday, hours before everyone else. Unclear why or when this decision was made.

Mnuchin at hearing, in response to Hensarling question:	"We‚Äôre monitoring the stock markets. They are functioning very well. And we continue to believe in the long term impacts of the stock market."
Mnuchin, in written opening statement to House committee, doesn't mention market volatility.
Trump's team has little experience leading economic crisis response. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin spent most of last year on the tax cut plan. Fed chair Jay Powell (picked by Mnuchin) has been at helm one day. https://t.co/ISxc0H3VIH

Trump threatens Donnelly. Says if he doesn't back tax cuts "We will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe."
Corporate America has been pretty cautious so far today, but a 20% rate with eliminated deductions means some companies would pay MUCH MORE.
