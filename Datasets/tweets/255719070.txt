Watching guy from debate commish explain why ok to orchestrate"undecided voters" for debate and cut off their mics post-question. Funny.
If Ryan was talking to Akhmedinajad, would he get all upset about being interrupted?
Joe was so mean to poor young Paul. @badspin
Martha asks about abortion. Whoa.
I'm sorry, but I'm just laughing when Ryan explains there is snow in the winter. Fighting season!
Ryan's really smart but he has  no idea what he's talking about when he talks about Afghanistan. He did meet that soldier though.
Ryan says you shouldn't negotiate with enemy when "they're shooting at us." Um, then when do you negotiate with an enemy at war?
Ryan  talking about "devastating cuts" to military of $1 trillion. Biden FINALLY points out that was part of GOP deal that Ryan voted for.

Romney is a good man, says Ryan.
Now Ryan is talking about Romney the Night Visitor bringing gifts to people in trouble. This has what to do with what?
Ryan talks about preventing a debt crisis? he was one of the GOP who CREATED the debt crisis.
RT @fstonenyt: Biden interrupts an absolute lie from Ryan that unemployment is going up around the nation.
Finally, the Dems mention the 47 percent. "I've had it up to here," says Biden. Trashes the Norquist pledge.
Because they are not insane. RT @GregMitch: Joe knows most Americans don't want to go to war against Iran.
Finally, Biden points out that Obama has talked to Netanyahu -- a lot.
Biden: This is a bunch of stuff.
Oh my goodness. Biden interrupts.
Biden: How are we going to prevent war if there is nothing more they want to do than we've already done?
RT @DavidCornDC: Okay, this ain't going to move any polls. Drinks? #vpdebate
Ryan says we should have had sanctions earlier. Like under Bush?
How effective would a strike be? Ryan ignores the question and goes back into history. Or at least his Cat-in-the-Hat version.
RT @feliciasonmez: 'Oh gosh, yes,' Ryan says when asked whether US should have apologized for troops urinating on Taliban corpses
Ryan says we should have known al Qaeda was a threat on this 9/11. Really? And the first 9/11?
Biden: Malarkey. Not a single thing he said was accurate. Ryan cut embassy security. Romney attacked before he knew the facts.
Hope Biden says something instead of just smiling.
Ryan starts off with a lie -- that it took president two weeks to acknowledge Benghazi was a terrorist attack.

Obama started to push back on board, and then let it go as if it wasn't important.
Obama needs to hit back at Romney on the board. He just misrepresented it completely.
RT @SteveRattner: Obamacare will bend cost curve -- but more needs to be done.
I see lots of people are wondering why Lehrer is so passive about some obvious whoppers from Romney. I am too.
So far, Romney people are happy. Obama people are nervous. Is anyone's mind being change? I doubt it.

Obama should be doing this more powerfully, more crisply. He keeps fumbling.
The don't borrow money from China line is a good one. It's nonsense, but it's powerful.
What is Obama afraid of. Ask him: List the exemptions.
RT @joanwalsh: Make him lay out the deductions he would close!
Note Romney does not say he will not reduce taxes on the rich, but that he will not reduce the TAX RATE. Is that the same thing?
Romney: You can't say my tax cut won't add to the deficit if I say it won't. So there!
Romney is doing the incredulous smile and soft-eyed look routine. Does that work?
Finally Obama asks the loophole question, or at least brings it up.
Romney: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. How exactly does that happen?
Which exemptions will you cut Mr. Romney? Obvious question. Someone has to ask it.
Has Romney ever actually said how we achieve "energy independence"?
