Well done Michael Cohen, Rid Congress of Morans in 2020, vote blue. https://t.co/Tp4IyWoRBh
Republican congressmen and women must have a head full of mush. The only reason they bring up the 2nd Amendment is not to keep guns in the hands mentally ill, felons or individuals accused of spousal abuse but to keep lining their pockets with Russian laundered money. Vote blue.
If 45 had Cohen threaten schools and colleges about SATs and grades, America will see that 45 has a very low IQ. https://t.co/S7v43wd36D
Resign Gaetz. https://t.co/cbaDgfto1f
Matt Gaetz, you talk about the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, you support the biggest liar in US history. Your comments are bordered on witness tampering. As a congressman, do the right thing and resign or face prison time. https://t.co/daORZsLG46
All the Republicans are having a melt down because they have failed to do their job again. They are afraid to do their job because Russia will stop lining their pockets with laundered money. Vote blue America, we need term limits. Rid America of Russian sympathizers. https://t.co/zScaJKhGlm
Rep. Carol Miller, you were right when you stated the testimony of Cohen was a shame. Republicans have failed to ask any questions about 45 and his illegal actions, since Republicans spent over 700 million on phony Benghazi investigations &amp; now failed to find the truth about 45.
But in 14 months since 45 was elected by Russia we have had 23 indictments. Republicans need to pull their heads out of the ground and stand up for the people who elected them. Vote blue to rid the dead beats in congress and protect America.
Republicans need to see that they have failed to do their jobs, they wasted 4 years on Benghazi investigation, 0 indictments, 2 more years on Clinton email investigation, 0 indictments, Republicans have taken Russian funding laundered through the NRA and used for their campaigns.
Representative Hice from Georgia, if you are saying that having Cohen testifying is a joke, let me ask you this, during the Obama years Republicans brought the Benghazi attack up 10 times with no one indicted or arrested. Two years under 45, Republicans have failed America. https://t.co/njHaAau5R2
Gaetz broke the law by tampering with a Federal witness. https://t.co/fURq5gWJjR
Today, Representative Mark Green states that a liar, is not creditable so my question is why are Republicans standing up for a known liar, 45 has lied over 8000 times to his base and the the rest of the American citizens. Double standards Mr. Green. Vote blue in 2020.
Jim Jordan is still trying to get Hilary Clinton instead of getting to the truth for the American people. Vote blue in 2020 to rid congress of the corrupt Russian sympathizers. America deserves the truth and Jordan you lie and make up trash that discredits this great nation.

A presidential veto can happen when McConnell puts a bill on the floor and it passes the Senate, the bill is then signed or vetoed by the president. The vetoed bill then goes to the House and voted on, it needs a 2/3 majority vote to pass. Once passed it goes to Senate for a vote
Mitch must go, Mitch must go, Mitch must go.

45 is first president since 2002 not to visit a hospital or troops on Christmas, and he says he cares for America, he is a coward and a cheat, who was elected by the Russians to steal territory from other countries.
45 you are lying again to the American public, we have drug Lord's coming to America on private jets and regular flights. We have more illegals coming in vehicles that cross at legal entries. Wall is not necessary, we need more x-ray equipment and heat

Manchin vote Yes for sexual predator. A shameful day in our history, Republicans put another sexual predator in the Supreme Court
Senator Grassley just stated that Democrats brought these allegations of sexual assault just to stop Kavanaugh. Vote blue in every state to show Republicans that sexual assaults are real and very traumatic. Men must respect women and women have right to have their voices heard.
No politicians should ever put party over sexual assault including 45, he has been accussed by 19 women of sexual assault and still no FBI investigation. Lock him up. https://t.co/zN61Nrp7s7
To all the women out there, as an EMT I have seen the physical results of a rape, sexual assault and the brutality of domestic violence but I have no idea of the mental anguish that goes along with it. I watched  Dr. Ford tell her story and watched Republicans today. I am sorry.
Anyone who chooses a sexual predator is sick in the head, they need to ride along with police or on an ambulance and see the butality than sexual assault victim feel and go through. As a health care employee I will always support a victim. Vote blue. https://t.co/73sZbOx3Ok

Democrat Manchin and Republicans have told the American women their voice does not mean anything that they care about. We have to vote blue to get our country back.
I want to know why the Republicans voted yes when the Bar association, 1700+ law professors, 650+ judges came out and stated Kavanaugh was not fit for the seat of Supreme Court Judge?
Congrats Brian on the birth of your baby. I pray to God that America vote to take this great country back from sexual predators and they are jailed. https://t.co/nrDyw39iw2

There is no way that this congress, 100 men and women,  have read 1000 pages of information one at a time. Grassley says Democrats are bias, Grassley and McConnell both came out and said they were going to confirm Kavanaugh prior to hearing and WH controlled FBI investigation.

Republican idiots just stated Kavanaugh was very honest knowing he lied. Vote blue.
America has to vote blue. https://t.co/p02WN2q0Xo
Republicans congressman need to pull their heads out of their rears. Hatch just said that Kavanaugh is the most qualified person for the Supreme Court ever after 1700+ law professors and 650+ judges have come out and stated he is unfit. Hatch is unfit to represent America.

Republicans don't care about the women who are not Republicans or Democrats or Independents, they are victims of sexual assault who want their tragedies heard. So why did Republicans cheat them out of a full investigation. White house says it was up to the Republicans, not true. https://t.co/B3yfqOYW4j
Republicans are scared of Beto, cheating, do not register online, go to court house to register or have someone pick up registration forms, time is at the essence. https://t.co/3LSoQkPCMB
All women who have been sexually assaulted and bullied need to stand up, let the bullies know you are someone special and you have the right to have your voice heard. FBI investigation was a narrow scope controlled by White House lawyer. Sham. Vote blue. https://t.co/aIhlSB6WZi

I what all Americans to know the people who feel they have been stepped on, sexually assaulted or raped have the right to to stand up and be heard, have the right to be believed without going through this trauma again, vote blue to get our country back from the bullies.

Republicans congress shows America and the world they are corrupt.
Republicans do not care about men, women and children who have been sexually assaulted, when Republicans cause this country to become a godless country. A sham FBI investigation. Vote to save this country.
McConnell, I can see why people say you are the worst  Senate Leader ever, I say you are a moran, 650 federal judges says Kavanaugh is not fit to be in that position. You prevented the FBI from doing their job, how dare you cheat the American public. Call your congressman, vote.
Republican congress and the White House failed the American citizens again, when they put hand cuffs on the FBI when they failed to do a complete investigation. I want to say sorry to all the people who have been sexually assaulted because we now know. McConnell just lied on TV.
Republicans don't care about the American citizens, look at healthcare, kidnapping children, a small % of pay raises that Americans don't get because taxes chew up the extra money, tariffs are forcing Americans to pay more in consumer goods, and they will step on women . https://t.co/uzoRIjrKp3

We need to stand up against these bullies, boycott States where these bullies represent, we need to protect our mom's, sisters, daughters and granddaughters. Republicans have taken Russian blood money to turn their heads and allow the mentally ill people to get weapons to kill.

Republicans are mocking women who come out and tell their story about being sexually assaulted or raped. 45 used a rally in Mississippi last night to mock Dr. Ford, this is why 45 needs to be removed from office. Dr. Ford please sue Kavanaugh and every congressman who  votes yes.

Republican senators are idiots, everybody knows that the FBI finds the truth period, they do not conclude results, they find the truth
He is not worthy of the seat on the US Supreme Court. He has lied and we need a FBI investigation to find the truth. I believe the women, where is Mark Judge? His books tell the stories. https://t.co/QYBC9979mj
It is the same Republican senators at both hearings. They still want to step on women and keep them beneath them. Must vote to get a working Congress who works for the American people. https://t.co/rmvnh5h40n
Senator Graham just flipped out at the hearing telling everyone that the women were lying and the Democrats put on a sham. Americans need to vote to get a dead beat Congress out and get a working Congress who works for the people, and not themselves or Russia. Graham proved it.
Kavanaugh needs to be disbarred, he should be locked up.
Now I understand why the Republicans are pushing for the vote, they received a letter from a couple of women telling them about Kavanaugh behavior. The letter was received a couple of weeks ago I do believe. Republicans have lied to the American public again. Vote, vote, vote.
Could of fooled me, why did you say you expected a different result than, I believe you are lying 45. https://t.co/4MrcvAQzKN
We need a FBI investigation https://t.co/TT2BIifHRB
Why are they having this hearing tomorrow after several elderly Republican men came out today and stated they have already made up their minds. Senator Graham, 45's golf partner, he says that a sexual assult victim is scamming. Do a FBI investigation Senator, what are you hiding?
He is accussed of sexual assult, rape, having an affair we two women while wife was pregnant and after she had the baby and he calls a lawyer who caught him in the lies a third rate lawyer. https://t.co/ip4y5N8UEA

45 has meet with numerous communist dictators and he stated today he is going to meet with North Korean leader again but he has not meet with our troops overseas yet. He is no Commander in Chief in my book, draft dodger and coward to me.
If the Democrats win the Senate and the House, accused sexual predator Kavanaugh can be impeached if he lies to congress, we need a FBI investigation.

What moran wants to do away with TSA checkpoints at 150 airports but Republicans want to spend millions on a southern border wall that will get blown up by drug pins.
@grammaTam52 Waiting for a trump pardon.
@thehill Sarah lied to the American public again, Trump said he does not drink so why lie.

@thehill Lying is not going to help trump
@tonyschwartz Space
@CNN Russian Sympathizers stick together
trump needs to be impeached for obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Giuliani is trying to find a good insane assylum.
Trump businesses still but China steel, products made in Indonesia, and he brings immigrants from other countries to work his hotels and golf courses. https://t.co/zvFpXreJ4D
@stonecold2050 @grannynannynews Worst Administration in the history of the United States.
Will trump and Russian Republican congress ever stand up for America or will they continue taking Russian money from the National Russian Association known as the NRA. https://t.co/CCgHIjHlIP

@FoxNews DNA must be used to identify the body, hope North Korea does send Americans home. We had Americans killed on South Korea soil also, are they coming home too.
@BrianGoudy4 @OkCallMeAL You need to relook at the facts, the FBI came out a week before the election and claimed they were reopening the email case while Russia flooded the internet with false information. The FBI knew trump had an affair with Daniels but they failed to break that news - FBI helped who?
@NYwonk @OkCallMeAL @Maggyw519 @GOP Nunes and Jordan should have been impeached. Nunes and Jordan for obstruction of justice and Jordan should resign because he allowed wrestlers to be sexually assaulted and did nothing, like he does in Congress, nothing, and he wants to be Speaker, we want a working Congress.
@hoowitterhooo @OkCallMeAL Cohen came out today and stated trump knew about the June 2016 trump tower meeting with Russians because trump Jr told his dad prior to the meeting. Jr lied to Congress and Muller so Jr should be jailed too. trump's House of cards are falling. Vote 2018 and change Congress.
Is trump supporters going to pay the 12 billion dollars to the farmers because Congress is not going to pass it because the Republicans say it is a bail out. Vote blue 2018 to rid the tariffs hurting this country.

@sahilkapur Vote blue in 2018, time to impeach a sexual predator. God says in Galatians 6:7, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap". It is time for christians to stand up with God and condemn hatred and sexual misconduct.
@UncleBlueWave @grannynannynews It was probably Melania, after the release of trump talking to Cohen about paying off porn star. God says your sins will find you out. God will destroy Satin.
@realDonaldTrump What kind of Russian elected president would commit treason and break federal law to hide an affair with a playmate.
@amvetsupport trump is a coward and a bully, who is a sexual predator by his own words, who only cares to line his pockets with money. He is willing to destroy America to fill his pockets. I agree with his cabinet, he is a moran.
@crystalline_02 If people are tired of Congress failing the American people we have to get out and vote, failing to vote keeps the worst Congress contuning to fail the American people. Vote blue.

@politico Two years after the election, which trump won with Russian support, still trying to get Hillary Clinton who won the popular vote, I think trump would like to forget he lost the popular vote and won because of Russian help.
@realDonaldTrump If you did nothing wrong, why are all your administration people going to jail, your time is coming. Keep America safe, keep Russia out of America.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why are you buying foreign products instead of American products, why are you using immigrants instead of Americans in your hotels and golf courses. Vote 2018 to make America safe from Russian Sympathizers.

@realDonaldTrump That is why you were briefed after the election, but since you colluted with Russia because of one reason or another,  you will not stand up to a murderous dictator. Guilty of treason.
@pdp504 @Hell_HasCome Putin is worse than any MS-13 gang member who is the most violate gang we have here in the USA. If trump would stop going after American citizens, stop lying to America and clean up the gangs, remove weapons off the street  and keeping Putin, a murderous dictator, out of the USA

@ralphpartydog @JanzforCongress @LisaSwarm @DevinNunes Remember that a vote in November for any Republican is a vote for Russian aggression.

@GenWashington64 @Billbrowder @kyleparkernet Why are the Republicans in Congress not allowing or putting bills on the congressional floor for discussion and passing bills to prevent Russia from taking over America. We no longer have a president willing to stand up for American freedom. Time to impeach traitors to America.

@thehill Trump thought so, he sleep with her.
Trump is going against his security advisors and allowing a spy company to reopen it's doors to continue spying on America. Trump received $500 million for his Indonesia projects to put Chinese workers back to work in China. He needs to be impeached now, he is destroying America.
@AC360 Colonel says Trump is a Putin puppet
Giuliani has told the American public that the leader of North Korea got on his hands and knees and begged Trump to continue the summit. White house must not what the summit to happen. Moran's.

@MSNBC Take blood money from NRA
@xavierdreyman @jaketapper I saw some A10 Warthogs in action and believe me the destruction they do in seconds is amazing.

@jimdeguzman59 @ImpeachTrump45 @realDonaldTrump Than you should have vote to clean out Congress, Ryan and McConnell will go down in history as the worst leaders in Congress, under their leadership this Congress has workless and past less bills then any other Congress in history.
@ImpeachTrump45 @realDonaldTrump Lock him up. He is a traitor. Impeach him. Vote 2018 to clean out Congress. Term limits are a must.
@thehill When you grope a woman again her will, you are the animal.
@MSNBC Muller can't indict but the grand jury can and so can Congress. With 19 people charged, in my opinion, Trump should be impeached  for witness tampering, obstruction, and possibly treason.
This is the 22 ND school shooting this year. Vote 2018 to remove individuals receiving blood money from the NRA. We have to protect our children and teachers from senseless killings.  "Texas high school shooter in custody, reports say" Sante Fe High School https://t.co/3uNNFBYToD

@CindyDPishere @Ally_oopsy @exoticgamora My daughter was born with a clift palette and clift lip due to contaminated water.
@exoticgamora Yes contaminated ground water by aircraft fuel leaking into the ground water. Wurtsmith AFB closed in Michigan.
Republicans are screaming about Mueller's investigation goes over a year. Why did they not complain about the Benghazi investigation, which lasted over 2 1/2 year and cost the tax payers 7.8 million dollars. Do the Republican Congress have something to hide. Vote 2018.
@WhiteHouse By stealing and hurting Americans, by killing men, women and children, by helping Russia and China destroy America. No thanks.
Hurts American families but wants to help Chinese families in China. Vote 2018 https://t.co/LrKTwLEuxy
@thehill Impeachment is a better reward for "fabricating" Donald.
@thehill Needs to be impeached, Senate says Russia interfered with United States elections to get Trump elected. Facts proved Trump is false president.
@MSNBC @KenDilanianNBC Collusion America, the term of collusion is a secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others. Congress what is your meaning of collusion, let the American citizens know so the can vote in 2018.
@Gina660 @thehill Communist puppets. God says you can't serve him and money. Satin, God will destroy you.
@beckyexpress @thehill They meet with Russia to destroy America. God forgive them.
@OceanSolitudeME @thehill Lock them up. Impeach Trump. Vote 2018 and change Congress to get the job done.
@thehill Lock them up for destroying America.
@MSNBC @KenDilanianNBC I don't hear individuals shouting lock them up for the crimes they committed. This is America, not a Russian country or a Chinese country. The leadership of this country has brought disgrace to America for  unnecessary corruption, lies and failures of Congress to get the job done
@realDonaldTrump These men and women who died protecting citizens has paid the ultimate price for a job they love. We need to promise their families they will never be forgotten. Stand up for the Blue. God bless them all.
@jaketapper Trump gets 500 million from China to drop sanctions against ZTE
Trump must be looking at himself in a mirror. https://t.co/PUBgiT0GGT
@realDonaldTrump Will be know as a murderer of men, women and children  to keep an unnecessary campaign promise.
@CNNPolitics Our prayers are with you Melania
@adamdavidson @SCMP_News Impeach him

@Lolo61667 @MSNBC White House is crooked
@realDonaldTrump Trump is a Russia/Chinese puppet. Vote 2018 to drain the swamp.
@MarkW1026 @Justatoy2 @WhiteHouse Republicans screamed and hollered and spent millions on Benghazi trails, will they say anything about the murders committed in Jerusalem today.
@shrekthepunk @funder @IvankaTrump So many men, women and children killed, their blood was shed unnecessarily. Was it for blood money?
@CenterBeautiful @peplamb He will be judged by God on judgement day.
@JaySmit43567534 @mansa_Musa404 @realDonaldTrump No one should die a unnecessary death.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics has said that the House of Representatives worked 110 days in 2016, 145 days in 2017 and they are planning to work only 121 days. Vote in 2018 to change this.
Vote 2018. Choose for America.

All shooters who have a mental illness, the victims blood on Trump.

@Ben_H_Wilson @RealDaveLogan @Votebase @realDonaldTrump Our own Congress funds terriorist countries. Trump was trying to build a Trump tower in a terriorist country.
@Ben_H_Wilson @Votebase @realDonaldTrump According to trumps own cabinet people, Iran was following the treaty.
@keithlyons @BlakePenland @peplamb When God judges you on judgement day and throws you in hell, you will wish you knew God personally.
@peplamb Yes we worship God, but we don't lie, we do not belittle people, we don't show hatred to other, we show love for all people. Yes we worship God, my Lord and Savior.
@DetroiterKen @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Vote 2018
@realDonaldTrump Not according to some

@GenMhayden @jaketapper I am with you General
@BernieSanders Go Bernie
@MSNBC Democrats and Republicans both own guns. Owning guns is not the issue, keeping them out of the hands of the mentally Ill,  felons and individuals of domestic abuse. Stand up Congress and due your job. Protect Americans, give up your blood money.
@CNNPolitics You deserve better Melania. Dump Trump.
@MSNBC Vote 2018, Trump may get impeached.
He is destroying America https://t.co/3a3HNoSaaU
@PauleyP Good Luck Pauley
He is destroying America https://t.co/3a3HNoSaaU
@NewDay @ChrisCuomo I do believe that 60% of Americans believes that Trump lies on a daily basis.
@MSNBC Now who is lying Rudy
@CNN We have more then one hospital with blood all over the floor due to shootings and stabbings.
@thehill Your own lawyer, Giuliani stated you were guilty, Mr. Trump. Just admit it and move on. Congress needs to impeach Trump and start building America's reputation again.
@MooringTroy @MSNBC President Pinocchio speaks again. He throws his lawyer under the bus.
@stormdk24 @MSNBC @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr Congress has not done their job since McConnell and Ryan has been the majority leaders of Congress. Impeach them or vote them out in 2018.
@MSNBC Trump really believes Americans are stupid and he can say anything he wants. He needs to be impeached. Vote 2018.
@thehill What is new, not one communication person or aid for Trump has told the truth about anything. Vote 2018 to impeach.
@WillieGeist @MSNBC @DonnyDeutsch Cohen says Gulini has no clue, has dementia set in?
@WillieGeist @MSNBC @DonnyDeutsch Trying to blow smoke, they believe Americans don't care how we are perceived by other nations.
@NewDay @CNNPolitics @Scaramucci He is lying to America, that is what he is doing, foreign leaders think he is a joke. Can't be trusted.
@thehill Is Trump really that ignorant, no wonder he is going broke.
@CNNPolitics She knew if she was close to Trump as she says she is. Did another Trump aid lie to America to protect the president again?
@thehill Melania Trump does not deserve this humiliation, she  deserves better.
@TrisResists @PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse @SnowBiAuthor @WomanResistorNC @KidCasteel @OliviaResists @DeadpoolResists @TrinityResists @DonnaNoble10th @exoticgamora Confess your sins and God is faithful and just to forgive your sins, Mr. Trump.
@ukwildcatfan194 @sbarkley @MSNBC He stated Trump supported his comments.
@MSNBC About the exact time frame for an impeachment hearing.
@patriciaa92358 @SenWarren @riotwomennn @PhilipsLight @RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Prez, why do we still have manufacturing jobs in Mexico, thought you said they were coming home. Why are your companies still buying oversea goods an selling them here in America. Use this phrase" Buy America", it helps support our economy.
@rishio95 @thehill Let America see all the texts, not hear say.
@MSNBC Congress needs to stand up to Ryan, get a back bone Congress. If they do not want to do their job vote everyone out.
@MrFilmkritik Trump has 19 women who has accused him of sexual assault or had affairs with him. Where is the justice for them. Vote 2018.
@sahluwal Time for the spineless Congress to start impeachment proceedings against a man who has confessed assaulting women over the years just because he is rich and powerful. Republicans are bailing from Congress because they do not want to do their job. Vote in November to protect USA.
@washingtonpost Will America be trusted when Trump is done?
@RepDanKildee @RepJoeKennedy With Pruitt as EPA Sec, people will die before Congress passes the laws to help America.
@realamericadrew @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @EmmanuelMacron @WhiteHouse Looks like the no's have it.
@MichaelSinger48 @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @EmmanuelMacron @WhiteHouse She seems to care for others. Good heart.
@TouchOfStupid @DianeSymons @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @EmmanuelMacron @WhiteHouse I feel sorry for Melania because she has to hear all the bad things her husband has said and done to other women. She will not leave because of Barron.
@mindy965 @libbyannehess @atensnut @kragsdale73 Both should have been jailed. Trump still has not been tried and a Republican  Congress impeached Bill Clinton but refuses to do what is right. Money buys you freedom, I guess that is why you cannot serve both God and money.
@coller_marianne @thehill If Trump was a true Christian, you would not hear the hatred coming from his mouth. He would not be lying everyday, he would actually confess his sins. He would ask America to forgive  him for letting this country down. He would reach out to all Americans.
@thehill Vote 2018 to hire people that will do their job.
@thehill He hires the best crooked people, he needs to resign.
@SenatorIsakson @jaketapper @ChrisCoons Senator Isakson, you need to run for President. You are a great person, as a Democrate I would support you.
@politico Mr. Trump, just to let you know that you lied to America again today. It was a 10 to 10 tie to accept Pompeo and Dem Senator Chris Coons of Delaware changed his vote because Senator Isakson, Republican from Georgia was giving a eulogy. Trump stop living to America. Vote 2018.
@thehill He lies every day, christians need to stand up with God and fight Satan.
@politico Impeach him for failing to do his job
@thehill Caught in another lie Mr. Trump
@StJude Go St. Jude
@coconutwireles2 @CNNPolitics Americans stand up and vote in 2018.
@thehill Colorado teachers, come to any of the other 49 states, you will be welcomed.
@thehill I have spent 20 years defending my country. I love my country and my flag. Vote in 2018 to change Congress for the better. The term collusion is "secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others. I believe this took place in Trump tower.
@SenFeinstein Americans need to vote  in November. This is your country, stand up and vote.
@ProudResister @lilfair Guilty, guilty, guilty.
@ProudResister @lilfair Spent 20 years combating communist aggression and we have a president who is inviting it to our country. God  help this country. Americans vote 2018 to change this country.
@thehill Good for her.

@ForeverLogical @mamasden @realDonaldTrump It going to happen when you do not know what you are doing.
@realDonaldTrump Why are the elderly not receiving their portion and since the rich are receiving the biggest tax cuts, how is the national deficit going to get paid since it is going to grow by billions.
@rendog1977 @GunsmithA @MinnPatriot @realDonaldTrump The people he chooses are not fit for the job.
@realDonaldTrump @dr_dot Republicans are in charge of the House and Senate. They can do their job if they want.
