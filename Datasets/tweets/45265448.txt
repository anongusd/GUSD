If you're wondering how conservatives feel about that White House meeting =&gt; https://t.co/Rz6pQjK7Lh
Trump wants to merge Toomey/Manchin background check bill with narrow Fix NICS Act to "create something that's beautiful."
Trump says going thru court to take away guns from dangerous ppl "would have taken a while... take the guns first, go through due process second."
BIG: Trump urges House GOP leaders to keep a concealed carry bill separate from background checks bill, warning that otherwise the latter will never pass.
Trump says Toomey/Manchin background bill doesn't raise the age requirement to buy rifles because they're "afraid of the NRA."
Trump says law enforcement should have taken away the Parkland shooter's guns, whether they had the right to or not.
After @ChrisMurphyCT says it's gonna take Trump to bring R's to the table on gun reform, Trump says "I like that responsibility."
Suggests changing the bill title to "the US Background Check Bill, or whatever." https://t.co/E8QY7q5tAs
Trump wants to use Fix NICS Act as the single vehicle for all ideas to address gun violence instead of having "15 different bills."
Trump says he's going to ban bump stocks through exec order, tells lawmakers they can "focus on other things" in their legislative efforts.
Press will get to stay in the guns/school safety meeting between Trump &amp; bipartisan lawmakers for "an extended period of time," per pool.

RT @thehill: Congress threatens action against airlines during heated House hearing https://t.co/eccIHER2o7 https://t.co/YLG8vONio6
The bills seeming to gain the most steam in Congress would've targeted those 2 areas.. but now there's not as much incentive to pass them.
Every airline at today's #unitedhearing agreed to simplify their contract of carriage &amp; promised not to remove passengers after boarding.
Munoz added: ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do what we said, than we should be able to stand up to whatever [Congress] might offer to us.‚Äù
United CEO Munoz tells reporters: "The sense in the room was get your collect stuff together and you can avoid us, which I think is fair."
Lawmakers warn airlines: Shape up or else... more takeaways from today's tense &amp; lengthy #unitedhearing: https://t.co/6T7enf3zbb
@Gardner_LM @farenthold I prefer the tacos &amp; nachos lunchables because I am a savage
What I've learned from this #unitedhearing: which airline that each lawmaker prefers to fly.
Going on 4 hours at this #unitedhearing... if we were stuck on a tarmac for that long, at least we'd be entitled to food &amp; water
Rep. Woodall jokes: you know it's a bad when you're getting lectured on customer service by members of Congress.
.@RepSires says soon airlines are gonna start charging to use the restrooms... United promises that will never happen.
Airlines agree to shorten their customer service contracts in House hearing: https://t.co/GP8CwrNDsd
Airlines (minus @SouthwestAir) also coming under fire in this hearing for charging baggage fees &amp; change fees
.@Rep_Hunter sorta going IN on the airlines.. half-jokingly asks: "Why do you hate the American people?"
Chairman @RepBillShuster blames all the "damn lawsuits" for super long contract of carriages.. calls for tort reform.
United, Alaska, American &amp; Southwest promise to shorten their "contract of carriage." Alaska even agrees to get it down to one-page.
Del. @EleanorNorton says airlines might think they're testifying in front of Congress, but really looking at their customer base.
Alaska Airlines admits "contract of carriage" too long, says it would be open to streamlining it &amp; making more clear
Lawmakers cheered when American Airlines said it's getting rid of DCA's "dreaded gate 35X."
Southwest says #United incident spurred them to stop overbooking flights.. predicts denied boardings will go down 80% under new policy
Southwest Airlines: "Never rest on your laurels, or else you'll get a thorn up your ass."
Alaska Airlines touting their customer service awards.. says their smaller size allows them to be "nibble" in this area
Oscar Munoz: "We will work incredibly hard not to re-earn your business, necessarily... but your trust."
United CEO Oscar Munoz apologizes to David Dao, and apologizes for his initial response to the dragging incident.
Shuster warns airlines if changes not made by next hearing "you won't like the outcome." Told me same thing yestrdy: https://t.co/Z8zf9BKHNt
.@RepPeterDeFazio says he's collecting ideas for how to prod, push or legislate airlines into improving customer service policies.
.@RepBillShuster "This won't be a pleasant hearing for the witnesses today... but this needs to be constructive."
.@RepBillShuster (United, Southwest, American &amp; Alaska are testifying today)
,@RepBillShuster: "We invited all the major air carriers... you are the brave few to be here with us" at the hearing today.
