@realDonaldTrump Can anyone explain how wall construction is not defense spending? Is defense funding specified (x dollars for salaries, y for equipment and parts, z for logistics)? If it's just listed as general defense funding, then there's no reasonable conflict here.
@BillShedd @realDonaldTrump You mean how the wall was funded by congress in last presidency, but wasn't spent on the wall?

@NateMFNelson @KatiePavlich @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Very true. But @SenateMajLdr  would probably have to bring more legislation to correct legal system. Crackdown on illegal is just a choice to enforce existing law.
Maybe not the time as I just signed up, but how does @realDonaldTrump  not show up in top 5 on suggested people to follow when a person lists politics as an interest. Algorithms don't do that, unless someone specifically sets them to.
@Thomas1774Paine Probably too late, but special elections are horrible ideas, especially if you believe the other side may cheat. (And they do, all the time)
