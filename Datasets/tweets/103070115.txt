@realDonaldTrump Everytime I read a tweet it makes me vomit
@realDonaldTrump Stop sending us your old news - we need new lies to keep us going down the rabbit hole. Bye
@GOP @realDonaldTrump No
@realDonaldTrump Do you realize you are the problem- worst PRESIDENT ever - I am very sorry I voted for you- Your continued ignorance is costing lives and has created the most volitable period in our history as a country.  We are losing 100"s of thousands of dollars in 401k"s- please go home.

@MilesRolfe @BillOReilly No - but I can not condone hatred- I proudly served in the military- fighting for our freedom- you can continue to spew your opinions to justify your position
@BillOReilly Bill, As a conservative Republican, my issue is not with the positive direction of the country, but with the continued and blatant disregard and disrespect for the values that we hold dear to our country and heart. So, therefore I have denounced my  Republican party affiliation.
