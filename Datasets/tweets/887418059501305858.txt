"Here we are concerned with the narcissistic reproduction of the self image of one black man and another white man – the balance weighs the future of our democratic process. And neither of them have the capacity nor the compassion to deal with this in a serious fashion."
"We don’t have to wait to see what another black man could do in an alternate universe. This universe is quite competent in revealing that."
“Kanye, we as African American people cannot stand idly by while you give cover to a man who has proved to be a white supremacist, who has no interest in African American people.”
"We are already dealing with alternative universes. They are called black and white, among many others -- differences of applying justice. "
"You speak about the 13th amendment. Why don’t you watch Ava DuVernay’s '13th' and understand the historic legacy against which that 13th amendment unfolds, and the degree to which mass incarceration against African American and Latinx and other poor peoples has occurred."
