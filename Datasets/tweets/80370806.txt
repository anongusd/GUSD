This isn‚Äôt the 1st time Trump has tried to take away women‚Äôs rights.  He‚Äôs nominated anti-choice, anti-woman judges. He‚Äôs laying the groundwork to overturn Roe.

The domestic #GagRule will disproportionately affect poorer women &amp; women of color - not wealthy ppl with private insurance. Of the 4 million people #TitleX serves, 2/3 live under the poverty level &amp; nearly half lack insurance. https://t.co/ddarnHAYiN
The US has one of the highest cancer rates in the world &amp; the worst maternal mortality rate. Trump is trying to withhold basic preventive healthcare - breast &amp; cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control, STI tests - from millions of Americans.
DHHS released its new regulations for #TitleX programs. This "Domestic Gag Rule" proposal from Trump is unethical, dangerous &amp; a direct attack on the millions of Americans who rely on @PPFA for medical care. @PPFA serves 41% of Title X patients. https://t.co/M9KPBdouiJ

While today is a day to celebrate our past Presidents &amp; all they have done for our great nation, it is also a day to strengthen our resolve to elect someone worthy of the office. Trump has weakened our gov &amp; insulted the diverse communities that make up this country.
It‚Äôs also holding people back from running for office. 4% would slash my interest rates in half.

6/ Too many of our representatives are still bought and owned by the NRA. Our children are still growing up in a country where too many have become immune to the school shootings on the news. We have a long way to go as parents, as activists, as legislators, as Americans.
5/ But our babies are still going to school scared. Our children still suffer from PTSD. No laws have been passed banning assault weapons or bump stocks. No laws have been passed instituting universal background checks.
4/ The Democratic House majority has put #guncontrol back on the agenda for the first time in 8 yrs - hearings on gun safety have begun. NY has passed the #RedFlagBill - the 1st gun control bill since the Sandy Hook massacre.
3/ While I have hope, the reality is that in the 20 yrs since the #Columbine massacre, more than 150,000 children have experienced a school schooling, &amp; nothing has really changed.
2/ I have watched in awe as the survivors built the @AMarch4OurLives movement. I have watched in awe as parents like Linda Beigle Shulman &amp; Michael Shulman have become vocal activists working to make sure that their son Scott, who died a hero, didn‚Äôt also die in vain.

4/ Extreme is manufacturing a crisis, holding 800,000 federal workers hostage, and demanding a medieval solution to a 21st century problem. @RepPeteKing doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of the word ‚Äúextreme.‚Äù #EndTheShutdown
3/ Extreme is offering temporary protections for Dreamers &amp; TPS recipients in exchange for a wall, when it was the President who took away their protections in the first place @RepPeteKing.
2/ Extreme is demanding that American taxpayers pay for the President‚Äôs vanity project after he repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for it @RepPeteKing.

Speaker @NancyPelosi today on the #TrumpShutdown: ‚ÄúWe did not come to a conclusion bc we do not agree that a wall is anything that should be part of America.‚Äù Of course Trump is more worried about looking ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù for working w Dems than the nearly 1 million fed employees wo pay https://t.co/baO9lSvCUt

2/3 As we close the door on 2018, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about these kids. As I get my babies ready for bed, I think of the children who are cold &amp; sleeping on cement floors, who are vomiting out of fear. What our admin is doing is nothing more than state-sanctioned child abuse.
1/3 Parents are fleeing desperate situations to save their children &amp; this admin is taking their babies. One worker at a detention center has been convicted of sexual assault, another has been charged. Workers are beating children. 2 have died. Many are sick. All are terrified.

Because of @realDonaldTrump, nearly 90% of Homeland Security staff will go without pay, state and local law enforcement training programs have halted, and Defense Secretary General Mattis has resigned. What happened to being the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù President?
3) I‚Äôve had enough of the greed, corruption, and games in Washington. #NY02, what priorities do you want our government to focus on in 2019?
2) It‚Äôs clear who King fights for: the banks &amp; special interests that fund his campaigns, not for working Long Islanders. While King refuses to hold Trump accountable for shutting down the Gov, nearly 1 million federal employees are w/o a paycheck. https://t.co/tGQKAYKJDj
To recap @RepPeteKing‚Äôs priorities for ‚Äò18: 1) Voted to waste $5.7B of American tax $ on a border wall.	2. Voted to take maternity coverage away from 13M American women.	3. Voted to leave 74K ppl in our district w/o health insurance.	4. Voted to roll back Dodd-Frank regulations.

When he was asked to attend a town hall, Peter King said he would not succumb to mob rule. This isn‚Äôt mob rule ‚Äî this is what democracy looks like. https://t.co/5cOOfKS64L
Teachers are already social workers and guidance counselors. Asking them to carry a gun is crazy.
Our taxes have consistently gone up in the 25 years Peter King has been in office and our wages have been stagnant.
I am sick and tired of tax cuts going to millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hard-working Long Islanders.
Every conversation I have with my neighbors turns into a healthcare horror story. Parents have to call 65 different doctors to find someone who will take their insurance.
We spend more money on healthcare than the rest of the developed world. Do we value the lives of Americans or do we value the profits of corporate executives?

Peter King has already fought to deprive LGBTQ+ Long Islanders the right to marry who they love. Peter King has already proven incapable of standing up to a reckless Trump administration with complete disregard for the Constitution.
All eyes are on the Senate, and rightfully so, but here‚Äôs the terrifying truth: everything we are afraid of a 5-4 conservative Supreme Court doing, @RepPeteKing has already done. Peter King has already fought to take away my daughter's rights.
I refuse to let my daughter grow up in a world where she doesnt have the right to control her own body. If Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, we could lose Roe forever. Our rights, our bodies, our lives are on the line in this fight. Let‚Äôs turn our anger into action. https://t.co/9ZTSS9BqcZ
This is a generational moment. The rights of women, workers, LGBTQ+ people, Americans w/ pre-existing conditions‚Äîthe rights of our kids &amp; our grandkids‚Äîare all on the chopping block if the Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh. #StopKavanaugh

@rebeccapronsky @womensmarch Wow! Thank you so much, Rebecca!
5/ Americans are suffering at the hands of Republicans in Washington. 	 	We can stop them. But I can‚Äôt do it without you. Will you pitch in $3 to make this Peter King‚Äôs last term?	 	Long Island deserves better. Let‚Äôs be better, together. https://t.co/eF4ciDUHNi
4/ This isn‚Äôt just an issue here in #NY02. Working families across this country are seeing premiums rise &amp; wondering how they‚Äôll be able to pay for them. Mothers are choosing between groceries &amp; co-pays. Parents are working multiple jobs to make ends meet. https://t.co/7VQAs5okSF
3/ I got into this race because of Peter King voting to rip #healthcare away from 74,000 Long Islanders. I believe in this race because I know what I‚Äôll do in Congress: I‚Äôll vote to expand healthcare. I‚Äôll vote for #MedicareForAll. 	https://t.co/WkUVbfQaYa
2/ Because of Republican #ACA sabotage, the Center for American Progress estimates the projected increases are $610 for a 40-year-old individual; $2,430 for a family of four; and $1,210 for a 55-year-old couple. @amprog https://t.co/vIpA6AXEbc
Over the past two years, the @GOP has worked tirelessly to destroy our #healthcare ‚Äì and now our families are paying the price. My family‚Äôs premium will skyrocket $2,430. We can‚Äôt afford another Peter King term. Let‚Äôs make this his last. @RepPeteKing &lt;THREAD&gt;
We‚Äôll be knocking on doors and calling voters on Sunday, July 29, to let them know that there are only 100 days left until the November 6th election!

If we eliminated the inefficient tax subsidies that benefit the wealthy, we would raise revenue, reduce the deficit, &amp; allow our government to better invest in infrastructure, affordable housing, education and training, and research &amp; development, which would promote innovation.
Cutting taxes for the wealthy hurts our economy ‚Äì it worsens income inequality and shrinks the middle class, it increases the deficit and reduces national savings, which means less capital is available for investment in our economy. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/lKyaX2Wdjh

6/ Almost one year ago, @RepPeteKing voted to rip healthcare away from his constituents. He voted to create more stories like Kathryn‚Äôs. He voted so more mothers had to choose between their bills and their babies. I am done with this status quo. Are you?
5/ This is America. This is the year 2018. We are better than this. 	 	The saddest part? Kathryn‚Äôs story is not unique. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for Congress. https://t.co/lLqlqpLDN0
4/ ‚ÄúIf access to healthcare was our first obstacle, affordability was our second,‚Äù Kathryn says. She spent the next year deciding what bills to pay. ‚ÄúNo one should have to choose between paying their rent or between keeping their child alive.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
3/ While she waited for answers, Kathryn slept on the floor next to her child, praying that she would be OK. With each new call to a doctor, access wa. ‚ÄúWe have no availability for 6 months,‚Äù they‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúThe doctor is no longer participating with your insurance,‚Äù they‚Äôd say.
2/ Kathryn‚Äôs daughter suffered a mental health crisis. She didn‚Äôt meet the criteria for in-patient admission. She had to seek out-patient care. Kathryn, like any mother would, called dozens of psychiatrists, from Great Neck to Montauk.
I want to tell you about my friend Kathryn.		&lt;THREAD&gt; https://t.co/LRVAG29Vn8
We need to expand investment in Medicare &amp; Medicaid, not restrict money through block grants. Pete King voted to cut funding when he voted to repeal Obamacare. That's not leadership. I will fight to protect and expand funding and will work towards a #MedicareForAll system.
As nursing home populations rise, we must ensure residents get the care they need, and nurses &amp; aids get the support they deserve. Inadequate funding &amp; low pay leads to burnout and turnover, which hurts patients.	https://t.co/m8lT4pMvNR

‚ÄúMost women wait until their children have moved out before they even think about whether they want to run,‚Äù Shirley says. ‚ÄúSo we miss out on this essential voice. When people are in the thick of it, with children, it‚Äôs a different perspective.‚Äù 4/4
Half of our congressional reps are millionaires -- and it's no wonder why. Running for office isn't an option for everyday Americans when you have to give up your salary for a year and still cover sky high expenses like childcare. We need to level the playing field. 3/
