If Trump knowingly told Cohen to lie to Congress--lying to Congress is its own crime, similar to perjury--he did something pretty darn close to what Barr has previously said was obstruction.
The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions.
