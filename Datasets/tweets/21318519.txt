In sum, so grateful for @34ST and @underthebutton and @dailypenn. Had the most fun 4 years working there. I hope student publications like these keep flourishing for another 50 years.
Also! I used the @34ST connection to cold email @doree (she had been an editor) which, several years later, indirectly led to a job at @BuzzFeed. Also made a lot of friends there I‚Äôd never have met otherwise - too many to @ mention here!
Then @juliarubin encouraged me to apply to be an editor - when I got that position as a freshman it was the most exciting thing in my life. Then we started @underthebutton, which was my first taste building a publication from scratch. I got to work with the best people doing it.
I discovered @34ST the summer before I went to college and spent the whole summer reading the then-barely-functional website. I showed up to the Thursday meetings every week freshman year, and became friends with @rayalabi when we walked to them together.

It‚Äôs great to see that Patch has figured out a business model (they are profitable now) of steady,  thoughtful growth
There are also local newspapers, and community message boards, serving different but overlapping purposes.
I thought of online local media in two main buckets: multi-city platforms like Patch, and indie neighborhood blogs
This was in 2010, and AOL had recently bought Patch.
