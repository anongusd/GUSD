@Soundtechdez What neat trips do you have this year?
@Soundtechdez That whole HMS team knows how to do it on the 1.5s.
Don't expect Jeff Gordon to put up with losing much longer. He is going to charge from the rear to a top-10 today. #boldprediction
Recent history tells us that the big dogs win this race. Bet on favorites, not longshots, in Vegas. My (pretend) money is on Kenseth.
@JdSkunks @Marlins The Nats have a lot of aces, but that doesn't mean much in March. (See the 2010-2011 Phils)
@JdSkunks @Marlins Tough to handicap that NL East this year. With Fernandez as a midseason boost, they've got as good a chance as anyone.
@Soundtechdez Yep all it is at this point is a guess. Who keeps cool enough to win today's big trophy?
@Soundtechdez Haha. Well, let's put him in the Chase now. I'll be beyond shocked if he goes winless again. It's up to him from there.
Logano, Keselowski, Smoke, and Jimmie will be alive at Homestead. Just have a strong feeling Smoke wins it this year. #LetsGoRacin #NASCAR
So much has been done in 14 years. So much still to do. Just hope this opens the eyes of the other tracks too. #GetWellSoonRowdy #NASCAR

No matter what happens in that room, Gary Patterson should win coach of the year.
Over a Badger team that's no joke with a strong O-line and an excellent running back.
1. Florida State 2. Alabama 3. Oregon 4. Ohio State. Third string QB and a suicide in the same week and they won 59-0. Stylish enough?

@SportsRecall I say yes. Plate race or mile and a half. The 10 team's mile and a half program was strong in 2014.
I think the Red Sox could be quickly on their way to American League favorite status.
I have no idea if there's mutual interest between the M's and the Puyallup native, though. And Seattle has to want to shell out the money.
LeBron went home. So did Russell Martin. We see a definite trend. I hope the #Mariners can work something out with Jon Lester to get him.
Great. Shelby Miller, who has great numbers against the Rockies, got traded to Atlanta, who dominates the Rockies. #HotStove
Gone are the days of needing to finish 36th to clinch the championship. Truly an even playing field. I see KH winning the race today.

@HTC_Kelli Way to represent the Houston Texans on national tv. Nice job.
Antonio Smith should be suspended. Sorry, Ninja gotta clean up his act.
I expect the interim tag to be removed by season's end. The Phillies really want this guy at the helm.
Spokane's own Ryne Sanberg is now in the win column as a manager. The next step is getting the interim tag removed, which should come soon.
@RoxBBFan57 Braun is Jewish. Remember his claim all along that the drug tester made an error in handling.
@RoxBBFan57 After the initial positive test, he tried to get player support by telling players that the drug tester was anti-Semite.
@xxSkedz24xx I meant the A-Rod circus. But I would want that too if that were my team. Real Bush League.
@xxSkedz24xx I agree. Should have been ejected. Should be suspended. Neither will happen. But don't tell me you want this to keep going on.

@DJ_Eezie I'm excited for my guy Jhoulys Chacin. First Opening Day start and he deserves it. Milwaukee is always tough, but I like our odds.
Well, beat the drum, and hold the phone, the sun came out today! #Centerfield #OpeningNight
The Astros will win their AL debut 6-4 and finish 65-97. H-Town's great fans are gonna be rocking tomorrow night.. You can bet on that.
@DJ_Eezie Every year in every sport, there is always one competitive team that the "experts" gave no chance to in the preseason.
@DJ_Eezie True. The Astros need to play hard for one another all season to have a respectable record. It can only take them so far, though.
@DJ_Eezie My prediction is the Astros win their AL debut 6-4.
@DJ_Eezie I thought so at first, but the Astros have a nice park, great fans and probably won't be on ESPN for the rest of the year. So OK.

#TexansFriday prediction. The Texans will go defense in the first round at pick 27.
@DJ_Eezie You swept us in Colorado last year. But not this year. We're making it OUR HOUSE again.
@DJ_Eezie I hope the Lakers miss out but I'm thinking they sneak in. And OKC is destined to play Houston and the beard in Round 1.
@DJ_Eezie I was surprised that the starter was taken out so early, but your manager is apparently a genius, because Westmoreland was great.
@DJ_Eezie AL WC: BAL over DET. TB, CHW and TEX win divisions. NL WC: MIL over ARZ. SF, CIN, WAS win divisions.
@DJ_Eezie I hope the Braves prove me wrong to play in October. By the way, lots to watch last night, but I did catch some Gamecock baseball.
@DJ_Eezie Thanks for the faith, but it's all around pitching. Maybe the best offense in the league and we lose 98 games. What's that say?
@DJ_Eezie In that case, you're about 20 wins ahead of me. My WC games: BAL over DET because CHW wins Central, and MIL over ARZ.
@ESPNNASCAR @55MarkMartin @dennyhamlin I think he takes it to victory lane AT LEAST once. Maybe twice. Great opportunity for a future HOFer.
@DJ_Eezie @Rockies @Braves Can the Braves handle the expectations? If the answer is yes, they can win 95 games or maybe more.
The Rox will finish ahead of SD. The Dodgers, Blue Jays, Angels, and Yankees miss playoffs. Tigers lose WC game. #BoldMLBPredictions.
I think a ten win improvement from last year is a perfectly realistic expectation for the Rockies. 74-88 is my prediction.
Travis d'Arnaud and Wil Myers win Rookie of The Year in their respective leagues.
Nats beat the Rays in WS. Madden and Bochy are managers. Cain and Verlander Cy Young. Went out on a limb for MVP's...Markakis and Werth.
Best finish in NASCAR in a long time. Now that everyone gets two weeks to digest the mayhem? #BringOnMartinsville #NASCAR
Everyone wants to see Denver extend that win streak. But the monkey on my team's back will lead us to victory. #THUNDERUP #FANNIGHT

@benmaller That's all going to change this year. Davidson is the cinderella of 2013.

I was definitely expecting a deal for Ed Reed today. Surprised the Texans did all that for him and then he leaves with nothing.
Just like #LilLilEY has been hustling around all day. Almost as fast as @EYJr hitting an inside the parker.
Ed Reed has a Super Bowl ring and will have a lot in the tank knowing his playing days are numbered. #GoGetHim #Texans #BullsOnParade
I'm a little late, but now to catch up with the ladies of @TexansCheer #HeyYall #HTCSocialClub
The Broncos might be about to become much more formidable with Wes Welker, but I won't be worried. Peyton won't win come playoff time.
@DJ_Eezie I picked Carl Edwards to win it all. Looked horrible after Speedweeks, not so bad now. Kyle Busch will dominate at Bristol. #bold
And now that Glover Quin is gone, I'll still be a Quin fan when he plays for Detroit. #Lions #Texans
Therefore, I do not root for Mario Williams. He criticized my Texans. I root for Jacoby, whether Texans fans like it or not, and now Casey.
I always root for players after they leave my teams, provided they weren't a distraction to the team and they don't criticize the team.

#Madden25Arian Arian Foster is deserving of the cover. He can prove that there is no such thing as the Madden Curse.
The nastiness of NFL Free Agency has hit the Texans early. "Mr. Everything," #83 Kevin Walter had to be released. Damn you, salary cap!
@KDTrey5 Is MSG the toughest atmosphere you've ever played in?
#ESPNYourTurn The other three will make the chase but Truex Jr. won't. I'm rooting for him to win a race, but too much competition in 2013.
I picked "Cousin Carl" Edwards to win the Sprint Cup. Glad he won today, because I looked like an idiot after the Daytona 500.
@RoxBBFan57 But as far as the offense goes, we have too much talent to get shut down as much as we do.
Can't tell much from spring training pitching, in my opinion. We'll have to wait on that. #Rockies #BringBackRocktober
Wanna see smart, passionate Rox baseball in spring training. Watch the errors, stay healthy. The "O" is there. W-L not important.

@RoxBB57 Yeah. Not so much, anymore. I've come to terms with the fact that Lebron is a better basketball player than KD.

Tonight is finally the night that #MegaWatt will be officially recognized as the best defensive player in football. #NFLHonors @JJWatt
@DJ_Eezie I agree with that, but I think KD can handle the spotlight a lot better. And that tech on KD last night was SOFT.
@DJ_Eezie Did KD come up huge last night or what? He has so much maturity and poise for a 24 year old. Russ lacks a lot of that.
@DJ_Eezie I don't have a favorite because I root for the underdog who is up front at the end. I like Kahne/Biff cuz were both from WA state.

Tough pill to swallow with the #Texans. More injuries to deal with. That's how the game works. The good thing is we get to play again Sun.
@CollegeGameDay The Gators are the most overrated team. Ahead of Oregon?
Should have been an interception by Kenny Cain. Instead we gotta fight. #TCU

@toyotaracing @AntronBrown Seriously? Gotta have pink on this one.

@alannarizzo Tomorrow. O's win tonight. Game 5's across the board.
@msroxrock We gotta go into next season with belief. Anything can happen. Long year. 2007 Devil Rays: MLB worst 66-96. 2008 Rays: AL champs.
@MLBFanCave @SFGiants have the better shot because of experience, a great pitching staff all around, and more power hitters.
Another thought on Tracy: The Rockies should have made the playoffs in 2010. The players faded down the stretch. Hardly the skipper's fault.
RT @JstyleP: Thank you skip for giving me an opportunity ... It was an honor to play for you..
RT @ROOTSPORTS_DG: No classier man in sports than Jim Tracy...
I look on http://t.co/YJGwBPB6 at the comments below the Tracy article. So NOW we blame upper management? It was their fault all along.

@blakebomber @msroxrock If Giambi plays again. He wouldn't play a lot, though.
@blakebomber @msroxrock Didn't mean that in a bad way. Just haven't seen that happen in a while.
@blakebomber I will change my stance: A fresh, young manager would be okay.
@blakebomber @msroxrock Giambi would be an unprecendented hire. Then again, maybe we need that to fix this.
@blakebomber I agree with that completely. Have you heard names rumored?
@blakebomber Yes.
@blakebomber It takes talent. Luck and effort don't put a ring on your finger.
@blakebomber You're right. Just trying to believe in next year's team.
@blakebomber You're starting to change my mind. I'm just worried a new manager with a new system would slow progress down.
@blakebomber You got a point there.
@blakebomber They have no star players. We could have been fairly close to .500 with Todd, Cuddy, Jorge, Jhoulys, Giambino all year I think.
@blakebomber Because I think we're close to contending.
@blakebomber He's a smart baseball man. Been around a long time. Got a positive attitude with young players. You wanna start over?
@msroxrock If they trade Cuddy I'm alright with that. I think Dex should be a part of the future.
@blakebomber A little harsh. Tracy's not a bad manager.
@msroxrock Interesting idea. Next year, maybe some of the veterans can stay healthy in 13 to lead this very young team on the field.
@blakebomber Your thoughts on the manager situation? #Rox

@msroxrock I understand 98 losses doesn't cut it. I understand your thinking. Tracy hasn't had much success ever. I might be alone here.
Big football game today. #TCU #IowaSt #FearTheFrog Time for Trevone Boykin to step up.
@msroxrock I like Tracy's intelligence. He had to deal with all the injuries and practically no pitching. I wanna keep the chemistry we got.

@JoshReeves77 Haha I read right over your profile where it says developmental. So no big league ARCA? At least not yet? #SponsorJosh
RT @chryspeterson: C'mon, #ROCKIES, REFUSE TO LOSE!!!
@MLBFanCave @MLB Tulo. I was close when they were in Pittsburgh but no cigar.
RT @blakebomber: Lead off double and #Rockies don't score. #Marlins get a 2-run double from their pitcher. #soundsaboutright
@PatrickBWayne Sounds like it to me. This is absolute garbage right now.
The 2013 Cup cars for @TeamChevy look better than Dodge, Ford and Toyota combined. #ChevyRunsDeep
Who's ready to lose 100 games and have the #1 pick in 2013? #Rockies
@BillFergusonJr Pit crew members ARE athletes. There were a lot of sports backgrounds at All-Star week, like a former college Football RB.
RT @YourRaceCar: @FlagofCaution Hey Flag! Fans can help sponsor @Tbayne21 and have their name or pic on the @YourRaceCar #60 in the Bris ...
Actually that or the white one like @Pagequeen1 has. GO THUNDER!
SPOILER ALERT: Profile pic I chose was a #Thunder picture. #teamisone Thanks to @Pagequeen1 for all her help.
I'm not very tech-savvy but I will do my best to FINALLY have a profile pic up tonight.
RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Good omen for #Thunder? The last 4 NBA titles have been won by either the Lakers or the team that beat the Lakers
@YourRaceCar Any time. When I first heard about this, I pounced because it looked like the coolest opportunity ever.
If you've never heard of @YourRaceCar,  for a relatively cheap price you can get your name on @Tbayne21 #60 NNS car Aug 24 at @BMSupdates

RT @tinastullracing: I love when celebrities that tweet also engage with those that follow. #thatsWhyTwittersCool
Wanna thank @cityofokc. They are really unsung heroes. They are trying to let the best NBA fans have fun AND be safe at the Peake.
@TeamJHarden Even though it would have probably been LA fans anyway.
@TeamJHarden I really hope the police are right that it had nothing to do with the game. The NBA's best fans don't need a bad rep.
@blakebomber Yeah, that's true especially since Al Leiter. But our guys can hit the ball a long way, as Cuddy and Tulo have showed.
@blakebomber Yeah, I'll go with you. I'm just hoping the right bet involves 7 or 8 runs at least. But I'm probably in over my head again.
@blakebomber Yeah I'm thinkin you're right, unfortunately.
@blakebomber I'm ready! I'll go Rockies 10-3. We will finally get good pitching AND 9 INNINGS of offense tonight. Notice I said 9 not 1
@chryspeterson @ROOTSPORTS_TR You would be a good first member.
@chryspeterson @ROOTSPORTS_TR  What we need to do is get the O rolling for all 9 innings so the pitching doesn't have to be perfect to win.
@Pagequeen1 Hey there. I was wondering how you get a Thunder profile pic. I'm not very techsmart+ I'm kinda sick of the generic blue pic.
#spursbig3suckstoo #letsgothunder #bestfans
Our big three is the best in basketball because they are clutch unlike some teams and one is even a sixth man. #JH #KD #russ #heatsuck
The #Rockies have a big inning once in a while so they get complacent. It's called KEEP THE THROTTLE DOWN! You are taught that as a kid.
Can't complain too much about the #Rockies loss last night. When someone hits a 462 ft GS you just got beat. We have to claw away, though.
For those of us who can't help out financially, WE MUST SPREAD THE WORD! @JoshReeves77 wants to race in the NSCS! Let's get him help!
#sponsorjosh @JoshReeves77 #gottaloveadreamer

Almost time for #oldmanmoyer to get the #Rockies off this losing streak.

@HoustonTexans I like em all. #Texans #SuperBowl #ouryear
@TeamJHarden #ThunderUp
When I said the #Rockies were bad, I really meant struggling. I meant to say struggling but had to say bad so I fit my point in 140 or less.
I have had my question about Moyer answered. Starting in 50th different ballpark tonight.
RT @TroyRenck: RT @SeverinoMLB With his start tonight at Marlins Park, Jamie Moyer will have made an appearance in 50 different ballpark ...
@TroyRenck @SeverinoMLB I was wondering what record he would break tonight. Now I have my answer.
Ok, more like struggling team. I saw a feature on The Rundown today about the logistics of expansion and relocation.
I wanna thank the #Rockies fans for showing up and always being top 10 in MLB attendance so they never have to consider moving the bad team.
The #Rockies are a frustrating bunch right now. Old man Moyer on the bump tonight. First game at Marlins Park. What record(s) will he break?
RT @JohnVassNascar: Retweet this to have a winning chance of winning a winning chance of winning!! Ready,,,,,, go!!!
The Lakeshow can pack it in now. Tonight shows a 100% chance of THUNDER!
The #Rockies are now the last place #Rockies. Good job, guys. #NOT
@TedBullardJr @TMSFanCrew30 Haha yeah I figured. Not much, thanks.
@Pagequeen1 Hey Debbi, thanks for the link. My grandparents were in town May 1-18. That + late east coast starts = little chatting.
RT @MLBFanCave: RT if you're watching @espn Sunday Night Baseball. @Cardinals @Dodgers #MLBFC
It's bordering on painful to be a #Rockies fan right now. #wewillgetthere #gorox #ouryear #patience
@NASCARonSPEED I'll take smoke. @tonystewart will continue his hot streak that dates back to Chase race 1.
@AshleyAllgaier They should let the pit crew go out for every driver intro throughout the season. It makes it more fun in my opinion.
@Buster_ESPN Humber should have been ejected.
RT @RWestbrookFans: What Mike Brown says to Kobe Bryant. Lol http://t.co/vnKpF9HU
No reason for Humber to throw at LaHair's head. Samardzija was not throwing at Konerko. Humber should have been tossed.
