It took another 95 years‚Äî3 generations of African American voters‚Äîbefore congress would enforce equal voting rights for African Americans. 		Learn more about poll taxes, which remained in effect until the 1960s: https://t.co/39a56Fkh3M #APeoplesJourney #VoteHistory
SCOTUS upheld these measures. 		In Mississippi, fewer than 9,000 of the 147,000 voting-age African Americans were registered after 1890. In Louisiana, where more than 130,000 black voters had been registered in 1896, the number had plummeted to 1,342 by 1904. #VoteHistory https://t.co/nJ7mZ8gpuQ
In 1869, Congress passed the 15th Amendment, granting African American men the right to vote. 		Soon, the former Confederate states enacted laws &amp; social practices effectively disenfranchising African Americans for the next 100 years. #APeoplesJourney #ANationsStory #VoteHistory https://t.co/hIQ5NLUwjK
The ballot was also a means for the exclusion of African Americans to participate in American democracy. 		Enforced poll taxes, literacy tests, &amp; more kept African American voters disfranchised.

The Mandingo is also recognized as a backhanded compliment. The reinforcement of the stereotype of the Mandingo as animalistic and brutish, gave legal authority over white mobs and militias to torture and kill them for the safety of the public. #APeoplesJourney
One of the stereotypes depicted in these films was that of the "Mandingo." The Mandingo stereotype reappeared to the present as stylized super-studs. Conjured by enslavers &amp; auctioneers to promote the strength, sexual power, &amp; agility of muscular young Black men. #APeoplesJourney https://t.co/SR1oc0zBW0
Films like Shaft (1971), Superfly, Blacula (1972), &amp; Cleopatra Jones (1973) are among the estimated 150 blaxploitation films produced during the period.

Through the mid-1900s the policies of racial segregation defined not only the images shown on American movie screens but how and where we went to the movies. AAs were required to sit in the balcony or attend separate late-night screenings or visit black theaters. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/yGCCJHByR8
But these ‚Äúrace movies‚Äù depicted a wide range of characters and experiences, from middle-class families to gangsters and cowboys. The industry provided vital opportunities for AA actors, directors, and screenwriters, including some with crossover success in Hollywood. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/VsYBmqI398
From the 1910s through the 1940s an independent industry dedicated to producing films for black audiences thrived in segregated America. At the time, black actors rarely appeared on the Hollywood screen except in musical or servant roles. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/9Pj7dGhvOX
This practice catered to white prejudices and posed dilemmas for black artists who could only succeed by playing stereotypes. Within the black community, actors and activists debated the merits of accepting these parts. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/VXEREdKVC2
During the segregation era, Hollywood films reflected and perpetrated the discriminatory treatment of black people in American society. Few movies featured black actors in leading roles, and most showed black characters only as servants. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/joaFzdPpXl

Oscar Micheaux was the most successful black independent filmmaker of the race movie era. Between 1919 and 1948, Micheaux wrote, directed, and produced approximately 40 films. #AAFilmFest https://t.co/qiheXlr6OO
Meanwhile, independent AA filmmakers catered to black audiences &amp; brought more positive and diverse images of AA life to the silver screen.

The history of African Americans in film dates back to the silent era and encompasses all aspects of moviemaking, on screen &amp; BTS.

Congress received numerous documents and letters supporting Tubman's claim. In 1890, two years after Davis died, a law was passed under which Tubman was eligible to receive a war veteran widow‚Äôs pension of $8 a month. #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/fU42Q5tyX8
Tubman appealed to the federal government for help in 1865 and again in 1867, during this time she was having trouble making ends meet and lived in poverty with her husband Nelson Davis, a Civil War veteran. #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/mQUSjfObt6
Harriet Tubman served as a cook, spy, scout, and nurse during the Civil War. However, because her wartime services were not documented, it would take her 34 years to receive compensation. #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/lhB2mQaGI9
Today, many are discussing income disparity in the U.S. for #BlackWomensEqualPayDay. Black women fighting for equal pay has a long history, as seen in the story of Harriet Tubman's fight for compensation for her Civil War service. #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/xKAYD11Obf

For 25 years, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" dominated daytime TV. Watched by millions in over 150 countries, it was the highest-rated talk show in history. 		Winfrey brought a wide range of topics into America's living rooms that before had rarely aired on daytime TV. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/Yelo65vKTo
@LauraScharphorn Hi Laura, timed passes are required for entry to the Museum.
An instant hit on ‚ÄúA.M. Chicago,‚Äù in 1985, the show was renamed "The Oprah Winfrey Show."		The following year, it launched in national syndication. 		In 1986, @Oprah Winfrey became the first African American woman to host a nationally syndicated show. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/0HgG3kbVHo
After 5 years of co-hosting "People Are Talking" in Baltimore, Winfrey learned that WLS-TV, the ABC affiliate in Chicago, was looking for a new host for its morning talk show. She auditioned for the job, and on January 1, 1984, she made her debut on "A.M. Chicago." #WatchingOprah https://t.co/53xoMCk82i
In 1976, Oprah Winfrey left Nashville to accept a job at WJZ-TV in Baltimore. She agreed to co-host a new daytime talk show, "People Are Talking." There she discovered the talk show format was a better match for her personality and talents. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/P4vkRJsTUk
Winfrey got her first broadcasting job at age 17, as a senior in Nashville, hired to read the news on WVOL-AM radio station. She transferred to TV in 1974 as a reporter for WLAC-TV, where she became the first woman to co-anchor the television news in Nashville. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/aBGVFGhDqW
The fight for equality eventually created opportunities for African Americans in front of the camera. Winfrey grew up witnessing pioneering African American women on television, such as "The NFL Today" announcer Jayne Kennedy and "Star Trek"'s Nichelle Nichols. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/x1wDMnN955
From an early age, Winfrey took to the stage in church, and in high school, participating in speech and drama. She competed in National Forensic League tournaments and beauty pageants, winning several titles to include Miss Black Tennessee and Miss Fire Prevention. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/0wwODdxMZF
Born in 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi, @Oprah Winfrey came of age during an era of profound change in American society. As she watched TV coverage of the civil rights and women's liberation movements, Winfrey would be shaped by this sense of possibility. #WatchingOprah https://t.co/FflOUhnCSO

The Emancipation Proclamation committed the nation to ending slavery. By the end of the war, more than 186K African Americans joined the U.S. armed forces. Of these, an estimated 93,542 black soldiers were former slaves who understood firsthand the nation‚Äôs fight for freedom. https://t.co/C8pkyEKWr6
America‚Äôs promise of freedom is filled with contradiction. Perhaps no people understood this more than the roughly four million enslaved African Americans living in the U.S. before 1863. By 1862, Abraham Lincoln realized that to restore the Union, slavery must end. #ANationsStory https://t.co/b0G40ftQFO
Slavery was deeply woven into the fabric of the United States and challenged the meaning of democracy. Enslaved people‚Äôs work formed an economic engine for the country. Bought and sold as property, enslaved people were valued at an estimated $2.7 billion in 1860. #ANationsStory https://t.co/KnnjzAGkAa
Slavery and its expansion into the western territories divided the nation. Republican Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election with less than 40% of the popular vote &amp; without winning southern states. News of his victory prompted a secession movement across the South. #ANationsStory https://t.co/6Yp6vydaDx
Today in 1861, the Civil War began when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, S.C. Nearly 200,000 black men served as Union soldiers during the war. Neither side predicted that African Americans would transform the war into a battle for freedom. #ANationsStory https://t.co/q6tr8Lo419

In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) launched The Poor People's Campaign ‚Äî a national, multiethnic, multicultural movement to demand equal access to economic opportunities and security for all people. #CityOfHope1968 #MLK50 https://t.co/cOgywvOJVs
Local organizations grew into national networks. The number of black soldiers in Vietnam supporting Black Power increased dramatically. Polls revealed that some white Americans expressed support for King's goals, but many remained unmoved. #MLK50 https://t.co/OdWbZM8zK0
King's death energized the Black Power Movement. Black Americans felt even more distrustful of white institutions and America's political system. Membership in the Black Panther Party and other Black Power groups surged. #MLK50 https://t.co/STDjl0eA3W
Responses to King's death varied. Black Americans were devasted, pained, angered. Violence erupted in more than 125 American cities across 29 states. Nearly 50,000 federal troops occupied America's urban areas. Thirty-nine people were killed and 3,500 injured. #MLK50 https://t.co/nOeWSMMyIG
The assassination of King diminished the hopes for racial equality for many black Americans. White Americans respected him more than other black leaders, but his Vietnam War opposition infuriated many. Some black activists were frustrated by his focus on nonviolence. #MLK50 https://t.co/AkbW4gyweU

Tonight we're hosting a discussion on Tubman‚Äôs continuing legacy and the role of Black women in today‚Äôs political landscape, to explore why an intersectional vision of social justice is vital for us all.		Watch the full story: https://t.co/lOEW9mnMB8 #HarrietsDaughters https://t.co/HsLOYdQ3fW
What can we learn from Harriet Tubman's refusal to adhere to the limits placed on her race and gender by society? How has her legacy inspired and informed Black women who came after her? #HarrietsDaughters #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/i9JxG29tXw
However, despite her years of duty and commitment to American democracy, Tubman was not rightfully compensated for her years as a Union spy, nurse or cook‚Äîan example of the inequality faced by African American women on the basis of both race and gender. #HarrietsDaughters https://t.co/C3BL5McC8M
During the Civil War, Tubman served as a spy, nurse and cook for Union Army. Under the command of Colonel James Montgomery, Tubman led 150 black Union soldiers in the Combahee Ferry Raid. She is the first woman to have led a major military operation in the U.S. #HarrietsDaughers https://t.co/8X7fuHeVfI
Harriet Tubman's legacy extends far beyond the Civil War and The Underground Railroad. Her bravery and tenacity continues to inspire generations of courageous women. Born Araminta Ross, Tubman escaped the bonds of slavery as a young woman in the early 1800s. #HarrietsDaughters https://t.co/6TGsEjJCPe

In 2011, the state of Alabama formally apologized to Taylor for her treatment by the state‚Äôs legal system.		Learn more on our NEW BLOG: Recy Taylor, Rosa Parks, and the Struggle for Racial Justice: https://t.co/SNdJORRm2N #HiddenHerstory #CAAMALens https://t.co/TvtaMjTrjg
The NAACP and other civil rights groups created the Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor to keep pressure on local officials. 		However, no one was tried for the assault. The two all-white male juries refused to indict the accused. #HiddenHerstory #CAAMALens https://t.co/JpoNthUM0G
The Alabama NAACP sent one of its best staff members, Rosa Parks, to seek justice for Taylor. In the 1940s, black women like Parks organized to fight sexual assaults.		These women became part of the foundation of the Civil Rights Movement. #HiddenHerstory #CAAMALens https://t.co/BXZbF8bNwv
In September 1944, after an evening church service in Abbeville, Alabama, Recy Taylor was kidnapped by a group of white men. The young mother was raped and beaten at gunpoint, blindfolded, and left by the road. #HiddenHerstory #CAAMALens https://t.co/VrJjSd246c

In 1944, Recy Taylor challenged the Alabama legal system to bring six white men, who kidnapped and raped her at gunpoint, to justice. The case was a landmark campaign against sexual assaults on black women, as a form of racial intimidation. #HiddenHerstory https://t.co/C9IDKN4RuH
