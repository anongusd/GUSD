Look is a Christian , calling for Murderering other people #hypocrite Thou shalt not kill . https://t.co/pE2xs9trBJ
You chose religion over God .
Every time you cover for the #Catholicchurch and what they have done to children.... You showed just what kind of Christian you are #fake
The Catholic Church consist of Hypocrites Rapest and Liars ...... Just like many of the other religions.
God doesn't tell his followers to cover up rape against little children ...... God loves the little children .
Catholic priests have been covering up the #rape of little children since the late 1800s . #Fact look it up
So thanks for nothing you f****** slave master. And I hope you get everything you deserve.
Religions suck and I serve no man but God
I'm sorry I have seen too many innocent bodies to cry for you ...... You will find no tears here . Shalom
You've had many of chances to change but instead you chose to hate ...... You reap what you sow..... good riddance to bad rubbish .
It's my belief , that even you know , that you will burn in hell .
The #HebrewIsraelites have murdered no one. Fact 		The #KKK has murdered Millions . Fact
They don't mind that you know the #truth they just hate when you say it and expose their #lies Amen
Hey man since we know Jesus is not a white man....... Now all of the blue , his color doesn't matter anymore .
Black people make up half the country all we see is a white Jesus even though we know Jesus isn't White ....... And you're not supposed to make any engraving images . Wow #Hypocrites #liers blind leaders of the blind.
Even if I die I go to be with my father. Yahudah
How many black communities are they pushing dirty water into ...... Why even call yourself a Christian Nation.
How many of your vaccines of course autism little babies.
We don't deal in fake facts . Amen
Even the citizens in Israel say that they are not the original Jews of the Bible , so tell me why you hate me again ???? Because I speak truth ....
Benjamin Netanyahu is Russian #fact look it up
#Khazar so called Jews , who are originally from Ukraine in parts of Poland . took over the land with the help of the #Europeans and ran a most of the original folks out of there and took it over As A Nation State . #Wakeup they're imposters .
The White media can lie on the Hebrew Israelites all they want , it's in God's hands now . #Shalom brother
We are not murderers God fights our battles .
No stress , we don't have to do anything it's in the hands of the #mosthigh God
400 years are up , all we have to do is sit back and watch the hands of the #mosthigh
They hate #blackmen using the internet . They don't want you to #communicate.
You attacked our accounts , you've stifled our followers , and you still cannot stop the truth ..... Praise the most high Yahudah .
That's why #lynching went on so long the White media found black folks they wanted to demonize
Everyone knows White media hates black men that are not gay are white washed ...... Tell the truth and shame the devil.
If you look at #history every time #blackpeople have stuck together , they have won .
Divide and conquer is there only weapon against #blackpeople .
Every time a black man gets to the top the attack him.
They hate black empowerment . That's why they attack All Our #Stars
These #whitesupremacist can try whatever they want , the most high #God as always King in the corner of #blackpeople look at all they have done to us and we are still here . #BringitOn
The KKK = murderers
But they will call #BlackPeople who #peacefully protest terrorist . This is America !
The #KKK #whitesupremacist are #terrorists but America just let them murder people Time After Time .
When you #empower your people he will try to bring you as a #hategroup just for telling the truth .
They hate Black #Empowerment don't you get it if you're not empowered you have nothing and you will never get anything .
Hey remember when the FBI set in Congress in front of the whole world and admit it 2 helping murder Dr . Martin Luther King.https://t.co/iAAIs0VXay.	Martin Luther King Jr., American minister ..... These people are not Christians #wakeup for God's sake . https://t.co/z2qKxUssrb
These white supremacist hate when you tell the truth about the #Bible that's why they don't want you to have all the #Books of the Bible .
We know you hate us because our skin is dark and beautiful same color is #yahushua/Jesus
The #whitesupremacist think the only reason blacks need religion is to learn how to serve their masters . You will never be my God ! You're just a lying , murdering , rapist #fact
They're angry because we no longer let religion Paris down but build us up .
They hate seeing black men use religion to empower black people .
You're just angry because you've never seen the #HebrewIsraelite attack anyone and the #KKK has murdered Millions .
Hey these #whitesupremacist you're mad that people know how to read now .
Hey we know you've hacked our pages , we know you watch us , we know you hate us because we're black men with the audacity to tell the truth #againstallodds . I am a black man I am #Israel I am #Israelite . Fact
Dear America , why are you attacking #BlackMen ? I no I no , you don't want those #BlackMen telling the truth .
Isn't it  ironic that all these #immigrants migrating to all these places , it's all because of #American and the destruction it's caused .

@don58536367 @Kit_Kat_923 @TalbertSwan Tell the truth and shame the devil.
So when I teach my children about Yeshua , I teach them about the Black God who saved the world ...... Then they turned around and enslave amd people right up until this very date.

@don58536367 @Kit_Kat_923 @TalbertSwan And here's another fun fact the King James version isn't even the whole Bible #fact the Roman Catholic Church also took books out in Swiss words around #fact and then they gave you what they thought you should have #fact
@don58536367 @Kit_Kat_923 @TalbertSwan And here's another fun fact his name was never Jesus , the Roman Catholic Church created that character #fact his name is yahushua #fact
@don58536367 @Kit_Kat_923 @TalbertSwan And besides no one said the color of Jesus matter. But it is a fact that he is a black . Black like #ShaquilleO'Neal black ......  hearing facts about Jesus doesn't hurt me never has . but then again I'm not some greedy racist who wants everything for them self.
@don58536367 @Kit_Kat_923 @TalbertSwan So funny how #Jesus color does it matter now that everyone knows he's not the White man they showed us for generations ....... Now he's color just doesn't matter. Jesus was black , Jesus was black , and that's a #fact and so were the Jews . So Ha
