@amgallarza Yes, and that's been done. And that's all great. But, again, my point goes to a larger  military effort to evacuate ahead of Irma.
@amgallarza lol obvi when they're given orders. my point is instead of massive rescue missions, they could do precautionary evacuations.
Always curious at what point military planes go in to take people out of harms way?
