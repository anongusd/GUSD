Lagarde on #MeToo"Pushing the women at all levels of society, politics, and the private sector is critically important. These women once they're there, have to carry the flag and they have to protect, cover, enhance and be the spokesperson as well - which they don't always do"
Lagarde on #MeToo: "There has to be ownership by men and women both that this simply cannot happen. It has to be talked about, and it has to be raised at the highest level at all tables." #WITW
2/2 .."Open and safe conversations about the real challenges and the real barriers are really hard to have in a coporate context but they're so important." #WITW
Trudeau on how he's going to change the fact that less than 10% of Canada's senior corporate roles are held by women:"Its about maintaining a progression t/o all levels of business &amp; politics and thats something that requires constant engagement and mostly constant listening..1/2

"Once a woman has contributed to a company, if she goes away for a period of her life, it should be made easier for her to come back - there should be programs in place to help her adjust to that world that she has left for a little while." - Lagarde on maternity leave #WITW
Trudeau: "Over the past 40 years, women entering the workforce have added a third to Canada's GDP --  proper empowerment of women in the workforce is essential to create the growth and benefits that we need in our society. " #WITW
@Lagarde on the #MeToo movement: "I more than welcome these movements and I think they have been contaminated properly in advanced societies. It has to be talked about and raised at the highest level at all tables." #WITW
Lagarde: "Women are more affected and will be more affected by AI in the workplace. 11% of women‚Äôs jobs will be completely removed or significantly affected compared to the 9% of men's jobs that will be affected." #WITW
Trudeau: "Proper empowerment of women in the workforce is essential to the kind of growth and benefits we need in our society." #WITW
