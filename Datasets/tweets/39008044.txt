There are more than enough potential Democrats to win‚Äîand win big‚Äîif they turn out. There is no need for the Democrats to go chasing Trump voters. Doing so would probably do more to alienate the Democratic base and drive down turnout than gain new voters. https://t.co/uPTBMgHxCU https://t.co/X41zQtjYEI
Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúbase‚Äù is shrinking. This should help Democrats, as young voters, who strongly oppose Trump, replace an older and much whiter cohort. During 2018 midterms, we saw nearly 70% of the vote in favor of Dems among those 30 and younger. @MrMikeBlake https://t.co/uPTBMgHxCU https://t.co/xwv1edIu18
Trumps ongoing little border wall stunt shows he has no intention of even trying to reach beyond his base either. This is a very limited strategy. Trump is a weak president and the Dems should not pretend otherwise. @RepGraceMeng @TeamKCP @harrisonjaime https://t.co/uPTBMgHxCU https://t.co/OSmMKwXC58
The Democratic candidate also stands to benefit from four years of demographic changes. Latinos, Asians and other groups that vote Democratic should also make up a larger proportion of voters in 2020. @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @KeithEllison @TomPerez https://t.co/uPTBMgHxCU
Democrats have debated what strategy to employ to take back the White House in 2020. My take is that employing a strategy based on winning back Trump voters is a fool‚Äôs errand. The Dems should focus on turning out the base. The reasons are straightforward. https://t.co/uPTBMgpWLm
