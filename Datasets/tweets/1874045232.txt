@_Makada_ You profoundly ignorant girl. While it‚Äôs true that certain Northern states abolished slavery early on, the US was one of the last Western states to abolish slavery all the way in 1865, with only Cuba and Brazil left. Read a fucking book or at least Google fact check.
@_Makada_ You‚Äôre an ignorant idiot if you don‚Äôt realize that the many things that disadvantage black people are because of slavery and discrimination. Even now black people are paid less, less likely to get hired or get a loan, schools in black neighborhoods are poorly funded, etc.
@RagingGayCons What I see here and in the comments is an immense lack of introspection and empathy that allows so many to be blind to the suffering of others and the way to contribute to it.
