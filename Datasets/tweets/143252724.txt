@KFANRosen this was better than the super bowl @WWE https://t.co/Y6Y0e5pdMz
@KingRicochet you guys stole the entire super bowl. the wrestling was better than the game.
@CNN the wrestling on Halftime heat was better @WWE
sorry @ScorpioSky I need to use your quote "That is by far the worst Super Bowl Game I have ever seen" @WWE that wrestling match stoled the entire show.
@CoryBooker question for you and it concerns both parties. why is it when someone makes campaign promises and then when elected not keep them ?

@NWSTwinCities someone call Siberia you gave us the wrong cold :) j/k
@ITregillis this reminds me of the cold of 1996. https://t.co/s95Wpa8GcH
@NWSTwinCities i'm i seeing this right that sections of northwestern mn could be in the -60 to -80 below wind chill range ?
@jzulgad If we want to be like the 87 and 91 teams that won the world series we need a Bryce Harper or what not to do it.
@WCCOShaffer weather channel was trying to say that it could be as cold as 1996 which they showed the all time state record in tower of -60. I guess some could be broken. wonder what is colder a Polar or Siberian ?
@WCCOShaffer what you make of this ? https://t.co/FytuWD5mer
@WCCOShaffer 50 below WC must be frostbite in 5 minutes on exposed skin.

@LaVelleNeal Congrats to the Bears. love how the lions shut out packers. @PAOnTheMic I know this is hard on you. we just need to pass more and not run the middle so much. including coaches.
@LaVelleNeal what i don't get is since we won the world series in 87 &amp; 91 why is upper management not doing the same thing they did then ?
@mauroranallo I have the same as you anxiety/depression also autism. I know the holidays really bring mental health at times to dangerous levels. it's great to have friends being able to support us
@duluthnews I fight my mental health every day.
@PWInsidercom @WWE 50/50 split on the wrestling/promos, if doing a cage match, FCA, Street Fight. there must be blood (needs to be old school requirement for the stipulations, also cut down on the commercials (way too many)

My solution to Kickers in the future for the Vikings: https://t.co/SgeKxhPVsI
@NFL @packers @Vikings maybe use the NCAA overtime rules (just a thought)

@PAOnTheMic @MeatSauce1 @PaulCharchian @BMileskiKFAN @DanBarreiroKFAN Please believe me on this regarding kickers check @AFLcomau from Australia and see how thier kicks would work.
@wyomingpd The kickers I see in the @AFL we should get someone from there.
@chasetheplains I like the way how the NCAA handle thier overtime rules.
@TimMcNiff1 I like the way NCAA handles thier overtimes. these ties during regular season in NFL is idiotic.

reason why I am skipping doing the National Anthem this year is because next year being 2019 and Hendrix made history at Woodstock on 8/18/1969 and on 8/22/2019 I will be doing the Anthem in honor of 50th Anniversary
i have my new song lineup ready for the week of 27-31.

@tomemmer just wondering do you include McLeod County and also miss you at the fair my friend :)
@PAOnTheMic Concerned about you my friend. Hope you OK. I know with Teddy's injury I know you are emotional.

@BMileskiKFAN I received a email from common last night stating that I can do Walk Away after Rouser. So that is the deal.
@BMileskiKFAN I'll train for it in the back room. I just remembered it last night. however the deal is Rouser first then Walk Away
@BMileskiKFAN I'll train for it in the back room today so rouser first then walk away on Thursday.
@Fusticated @PAOnTheMic check my tweets it is in there.
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 Wish you could come to this on the 12th: http://t.co/V2QaXrcIy4
@marklevinshow you would do a better job than Pat Robertson.
Tuesday: I am at the fair from 658am to 406pm again via Metro Mobility.
@PAOnTheMic good. I guess you heard of what happened today during common.
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 a few times.
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 being at the fair for 38 years since 1977. I know the in's &amp; out's of it. I had to swear at them that he came back
@TerrenceMann this is the other song I did: https://t.co/K2nDEF0wEm
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 of his mind. so me &amp; jeff checked both sides for the rest of the show and then I spoke with common after.
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 thing was said about him from Paul allen or Common and then sat in common's chair. I knew the guy was drunk out of
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 side while tenna &amp; common were talking and stood behind them and started talking with common I guess about some
@TerrenceMann @bbhunter78 I drunk with a blue &amp; white plaid shirt, Tan shorts, Hispanic, with sunglasses climbed thru the window by the sale
@bbhunter78 @TerrenceMann Falcon Heights :) lol
@TerrenceMann Did you see the scary incident as well like I did ?
thanks for saving my life 2 years ago and thanks for letting me go in back this week.
Do not Shut Me Up. especially with my friends at @KFAN1003  involved in a scary deal today.
not right. come on you guys. I have sensory and audiotory processing. I have helped for 15 years and I have been at the fair for 38 years
Listen I have nothing against the state fair &amp; kfan but not letting me speak to the police on what I saw and a detailed description was
ether wednesday, thursday or friday: I am begging @KFAN1003 to let me talk about Autism in a segment from a personal view.
I'll do maybe the Rouser next year. but I am a UCLA Bruin Fan. U of M Rouser I would need time to practice on so No. sorry @BMileskiKFAN
Friday: Kashmir: Led Zeppelin &amp; Dueling Mouth Guitar.
Thursday: Walk Away by James Gang. (maybe Steppenwolf: The Pusher)
Wednesday: Stranglehold by Ted Nugent
@KFAN1003 @BMileskiKFAN actually tomorrow I also have a major announcement. It is based on what happened today. me &amp; common talked after.
@BMileskiKFAN by the way. I do not know the U of M Rouser. (which is very true).
@BMileskiKFAN I know but I am a UCLA Bruin fan. If I can do both that is fine.
@BMileskiKFAN I already have Walk Away by James Gang.
@wccokingjohn missed it. how did it go ?
@KFAN1003 The autism I have is for real. The mouth guitar is no bit, If you want to know about Autism. I will gladly talk on air. thanks.
Tuesday: Deep Purple: Black Night
@bbhunter78 Black Night, Stranglehold, Walk Away, &amp; Kashmir
@jgkfan I know more of what happened during Common than many are saying. I have autism and I am very good with detail.

@HulkHogan Happy Birthday My Friend :)
@RikiRachtman @deesnider @Delta Just joking on this but guess delta never liked you hosting headbangers ball :) lol j/k.
@jclong I agree. that is what I am trying to say.
@jclong the fans will react.
@jclong My question now is this is it wise for stewart to race at Watkins ? it may bring too much pressure on nascar and not certain what
@jclong also to on the vid I noticed ward almost got hit by the 45 at first
@jclong I understand. I have seen world of outlaws for many years so I do understand.
@jclong it was insane.
@brydertna I studied the video as well. that was full front wheel not rear wheel.
@CBSNews easy answer no.
@ESPNStatsInfo I hope it goes 20 or more :)
@jclong I saw the video on youtube. It was front wheel full force. but kevin ward jr. also should have not walked toward middle of track.
@NewsBreaker @jim_utter I agree with everyone else @NASCAR we plead to you do not let Stewart race tomarrow cause of this.
