@JeremyPoxon @elliemail Hate muffins and so boycotting is easy.  Hate people who exploit others labour and then bitch about having to actually pay a living wage.  In the US,  the biggest welfare freeloaders are Walmart and Amazon. The pay is so crap that the workers survive on food stamps.
@mzgreen66 Yeah, it's all serious stuff.  Pastafarians have been known to secretly assist in producing these quality instructional memes to fight against the Fake News. NO COLLISION!!! So beware of the Devil's doorbell and the man who loves his own flesh more than you. #MAGA
@JaneCaro @ItsBouquet Jane, you're a woman, independent, opinionated and dislike the temporary PM. I think that ticks all the boxes in the definition of a thug.
@senatemajldr Heading the news, Senate Leader McConnell finally admits to the Senate that: 		Republicans can only win rigged elections.		This stunning revelation was wrapped up in a word salad condemning HR1. Strip out the hyperbole and dog whistles and this is what remains.
Amazing how Trump speak is entering our speech. My granddaughter was pretending to sleep and her friend called her out by saying: "That's #FakeSnooze!‚Äù

@JillWineBanks @Mimirocah1 @teotakuu @RabbiJill @JoyceWhiteVance @SRuhle @mayawiley @NicolleDWallace @BarbMcQuade @maddow Hi Jill, just letting you know that even we in Australia treasure your excellent commentary. It helps us know that our wonderful ally is in good hands regardless of the 77 monkeys trying to type out the complete works of Shakespeare.

Hilarious. But he doesn't know as much about my cat as I do. Check mate pilgrim. https://t.co/9QQRn9OFu0
@vanOnselenP They should bring back Abbott. He was the best PM ever, just ask him. No cuts to SBS, ABC, pensions. Debt reduction. Balanced budget. And cigar smokin'Joe. What was there not to like?
@JillWineBanks @politico Well deserved. Facts rather than alternative facts. Real discussions rather than flying monkey rants. Skillful interlocutors who are protective of their institution rather than sycophantic talking heads. And Jill I enjoy your sober and precise explanations. They're a real tonic.
@vanbadham @cmclymer I'll be a bit more presumptuous and suggest that the overwhelming majority of illegals in the US are Canadian citizens.

@XiJingpingReal gave @realDonaldTrump the best seller "How to Woo". Turns out it's Vol2 of the Beijing phone directory. Xi wants to help Trump find a suitable candidate to fill the COS. 	#notmeforCOS #Trump #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide #MAGA
#notmeforCOS	Hey Jamie at least I had the courtesy of letting @realDonaldTrump that while he's thumbing through the phone directory with the ubiquitous robocall to find a new COS who will actually work for him, I'm not in the race for consideration. #MAGA #Trump2020 #Trump https://t.co/qHObQC5uPD

I regretfully have to decline @realDonaldTrump kind offer to be COS. I'm touched that he reached out to me, being 468,466,723rd in legal succession to the job. There's a fellow I spoke to from an Indian call centre who's interested. He'll even fix your pc as a sweetner. #MAGA
Eureka I have sussed out the real identity of the NYT op ed. David Dennison. He's the most senior Trump admin official, known liar and prone to being an anonymous source. How's that  @realDonaldTrump	#Resistance

@larissawaters Larissa I have always admired your steadfast advocacy. Despite the sad circumstance, please accept my heartfelt thanks for your help.
@DavidpHearn The picture was staged on the island of Lemnos for propaganda gasp. See the female Turkish sniper of Gallipoli story for wild propaganda.
@LittleBertie01 Well said Cat.  Families like ours bear the physical and emotional cost of troop deployments and foreign policy chest beating.
@19_Gina_86 Being free to sprout your bs doesn't mean a right to be listened 2. Have a pop tart and chill out.
Freedom of speech is to hear thing that you hate. Yassmin Abdel-Magied you rock. Talk more,  much more.
