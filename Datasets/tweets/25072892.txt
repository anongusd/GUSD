@cenkuygur The primaries are irrelevant. As soon as the nominee is selected, you go ALL IN no matter what. Like, I can't stand Bernie and will fight him in the 2020 primaries if he runs...but if he somehow became the Dem nominee, I'd campaign for him enthusiastically in the general.

9/ And btw, the VAST majority of her supporters know/accept that she's not running again. Really, she's not. This book is not about that.
8/ Hillary has more than earned the right to say whatever the hell she wants. She doesn't owe anyone shit at this point.
