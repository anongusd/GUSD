@krassenstein Because that's not how the Constitution says the president is to be elected
@ray_kins That is interesting as well. Which calls into question the fluidity of the 'goal of feminism' and where it currently stands. The goal was once defined by the sufferage movement. Before that, it was to bring attention to the confining role of women in a patriarchal society.
@ray_kins So the question is: What is the goal of modern feminism? Is it to release women from their traditional roles, or is it, as you said, to remove gender based expectations from societal norms? I would say the former while you would, obviously say the latter. Not that either is wrong
@krassenstein I see what you did there, nice!
@ray_kins Is it a choice? The reason she's 'choosing' that role is because she was indoctrinated her entire life into that role by her mother. If one makes a choice, and the choice is the one they were indoctrinated into choosing, doesn't the initial perception of choice become a fallacy?
I have never had respect for @realDonaldTrump. When I was 8 years old, I saw him on TV saying misogynistic things. Then I heard he had been involved in a legal battle due to racial discrimination in his buildings. Everything I have learned about him since abhors and disgusts me.
