Hello everyone everywhere,  let us be mindful and helpful call and check on people in this weather and make sure everyone is safe and have what they need to survive. Love people and tell you love them.
Have a WHOLE program and choose from HBCU band directors,  choir directors, etc., 	You'd gain more viewers 	*I think* if we see regular raw talent( and not autotune)  making it on all platforms. Okay y'all I may not know what im talking about, or how to convey it. See ya lata ♥️
Choose the participants by them sending a video of their talents. Then the record labels or other artists can compete to develope or sign them like on American Idol or the Voice. I'm just saying. Instead of partying the nite before,* which ain't nothing wrong with it*
@RecordingAcad, have yall ever thought of a" Before the Grammys " show, on the day before( that Saturday) An entire show of untapped, unsigned, unheard of gifted and talented. That in my opinion would be *as the kids today *, DOPE.😃☺♥️😍😎
@MeghanMcCain Happy Birthday to you Queen, ♥️♥️♥️😍😎♥️♥️♥️
RT @DennysDiner: Valentine’s Day is fast approaching and our Super Slampler is here to sweep you off your feet! Head to Denny’s to dine on…

BTW, help us get the UNCF started back up on a national level. It may be, and I could be wrong. You have friends that can assist us, I appreciate you all and thanks for even reading my tweets. 😍😎♥️ Sometimes you have to let people know this is NOT alright.😍😎♥️
I bet when other ethnicities are celebrated , you won't ask us to participate,  hopefully I'm proven wrong on this one. This is on me, and IMO of course,  Have a Great Day. 😎😍	Sincerely Johnetta Parrish 	@RevDrBarber @BlackAmericaWeb @rolandsmartin
I know it ain't my show, but ummmm Motown is a part of BLACK history sooooo what we doing here??? February is to recognize us and our accomplishments. Black history is everyday and this month is to celebrate us.
@RecordingAcad 😲, 	Who's doing tributes to Motown again?? I love Jennifer Lopez ♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😎. Now I was watching my you tube timeline,  and there are no black entertainers that could participate or did y'all even ask???
@KissColumbia @jamalhbryant @RickandSasha So happy. Now maybe we can help others, with one strong college fund foundation. Remember the UNCF??? 	"A mind is a Terrible thing to waste." Lou Rawls use to host it. It was similar to Jerry Lewis telethon for kids. Maybe we set a date to have that again. ♥️😍😎

I heard a College professor say, getting a degree is not only to help you gain employment, but it shows the employer that you were tenacious,  you hung in there for 2 yrs., 4 yrs., or 6-8 yrs. 😍😎 That shows stability. That was a profound statement.
We also have tax season upon us, that we can donate a portion to help those institutions and organizations of your choice. Education is very important for our children and our communities.

Interpretation and Communication is everything. 💕💓💓😍😎	I love PEOPLE, period.
Let's humble ourselves and love those that seem unlovable. Those that you KNOW don't care about you. 	Love them even IF from a distance and protect your energy peace mind body and soul. Love yourself first then that same love energy will multiply and come out.😍

Let's STOP the Violence, and tearing each other down. Let's learn each other,  you may find a friend. If you don't communicate you'll never know. KNOW and love yourself first. Then Charity spreads abroad. To thine ownself be true.
Let us be mindful of our elderly, and our youngsters.	Let's look out for those who can't look out for themselves. Take care of each other, STOP bring mean and unconcerned. Show compassion to another, however whether on social media or in your everyday life.😍

@JoyAnnReid This referee and the adults KNEW exactly what they were doing. What if the kid had lost the match?? Then what, would his teammates STILL be his friends?? SMH at this, Everything(almost) hangs on race whether anyone admits it or NOT. IMO of course 😎
@JoyAnnReid IMO this child lost, his teammates lost, and the adults in this room failed teaching a life lesson. The referee should NOT referee ever again. Truly he's not fair and balanced plus he's been disciplined before for his racist outbursts.
@ChuckGrassley @RepMaxineWaters @KamalaHarris @CapehartJ  @Bakari_Sellers @donlemon @RepAlGreen @rolandsmartin @SenBooker @jamalhbryant @AP 	A wall won't STOP the drugs, what yall think???
@ChuckGrassley #2, who's bringing it in then?? I don't know but yall know. If you don't some of your colleagues do. Anyway who am I,  but a lil old lady taxpayer, who has no healthcare, like millions of others. GOP oughta be ashamed. @BlackAmericaWeb @RevDrBarber @tedlieu @Sifill_LDF
@ChuckGrassley As a you tuber viewer, a wall won't STOP drugs from coming in, legalization of cannabis everywhere  will take the ????? Out, IMO of course. As POC don't have the boats, airplanes, helicopters nor enough money to pay anybody to look the other way. #1
@TMZ #3, I'm asking the question plus thrown race in there because this referee has racist history and IMO of course threw his test paper away.	@rolandsmartin @BlackAmericaWeb 	@RevDrBarber @hbcus @stephenasmith 	What y'all think??? Any questions? Any comments? @TKKIRKLAND
@TMZ #2, Stay with me. (... then went and grabbed scissors to cut his hair)	What if he lost the match, his hair gone, would his teammates  STILL be his friends??? Also this is almost a WHITE dominated sport is why I'm asking this question *as Calvin did*
@TMZ The young black man, had his hair up,it's not like it was flipping and flopping all over the place. This youngster won the match, but still lost. He got a quick lesson in White privilege ( his teammates were angry WITH him at first, against the ref, then went .#1
@TMZ Calvin M. Explained racism and I'm paraphrasing,  that ref took his preconceived notions + his power= his decision in this match. Plus He had already had issues that called for him to be suspended,  so I'm not understanding why he's still a ref, period.
@TMZ He's most definitely racist. Are we talking the cut hair issue???

@wino911 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I'll say this respectfully, the GOP didn't and wouldn't work with President Barack Obama for 8 yrs, and he surely could not have did this nor any offenses without approval from this and that complicit Congress.

Maybe get doctors, nurses, CNAs administrators, barbers, beautitians, lawyers,  massages(we ALL can use these, maybe we'll calm down and not be so angry😎) biz owners to donate supplies and those occupations listed above to ...#3
Our local Recreation centers ( specified areas with security of course), our schools( locker room areas for showers) when our kids are on vacations, empty bldgs w/utilities on, etc.,.	ALL with supervision and security. #2
Y'all I had an idea to get more homeless persons off the streets. Sometimes our city missions and soup kitchens are over burdened. 	I thought as a taxpayer, why not use our local fire depts., (details to be worked out,😎), #1

@maggieNYT @GovHowardDean #2 and can't do or say. If (and he hasn't  🙂) he isn't listening to sound legal advice wash your hands and help restore this great nation back to where it was and needs to be. Right now Americans are more divided than ever in history. End on the healthy side of it.😍😎❤
@maggieNYT @GovHowardDean Trump's defenders mostly ALWAYS say, " Trump's been like this ", or "let Trump be Trump", or "What do you expect "???? I expect and hold those around him accountable to the constitutional laws they swore to. And he needs to be told what he can #1

@GOP @PressSec Would you promote this candidate based on his recent actions, not even past indiscretions?? How he interacted with his future employers(senators), would be a no no and he'd be a no hire and yall know it. No fortune 500 company would hire the likes of him.
@GOP @PressSec Then YOUR nominee can in for the interview on 11 and took it to 15 , lol like Matt on SNL. All of you should be ashamed.  A job interview turned into an uncivil case real quick. Would you hire this candidate or would you give this candidate the promotion???

They all oughta want the candidate to be a person who is not easily broken down,  as Kavanaugh was yesterday. Heck give his seat to Dr. Ford.  She was honest, answered their questions,  him on the other 	hsnd so flipping fly and dismissive. SMH 	Shame on GOP
The dems hasn't given FBI reason to investigate him. Pull his license then bet that'll stop it. Why are they rushing. Scalia seat was vacant 400 days, what's a few more days???? Lindsey Graham is protesting too danggone much. https://t.co/Rdv9eHrhvN
@SenGillibrand And some of these male senators with wives, daughters,  and other females in their families,  y'all can stand with the women, against Judge Kavanaugh.  I appreciate the @ABAesq abacalling for an investigation. 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎❤💗💗💕💕
@SenGillibrand I personally dont wanna hear any #Metoo #metoo, after some of these GOP females leave office. You write a book I won't be reading it or buying it. You have a protest movement of any kind don't call me. This is where you make a difference NOW.

@lizcjourney @blonde_han @JRubinBlogger I don't know who she is, and I've been in this voting thingy a loooooong, time. My point is I've NEVER seen GOP like this. I have lived thru reagan,nixon,2 bushes, and I'd pick them over this we're dealing with as Americans now. No harm no foul. Just IMO one voice, one VOTE
@blonde_han @JRubinBlogger We KNOW that the men are lying, so I want to hold out until AFTER the hearings. I'm a woman and watching these males run around like fools. I have questions,  as anyone else should. It looks like they are setting it up in favor of the males to win, WHY????
@blonde_han @JRubinBlogger We shouldn't let these angry males make decisions with us not free, to make decisions and ask questions of this man. Why would any female think it's far fetched for these women to come out just now. If YOU don't agree, be quiet and watch those women speak.
@blonde_han @JRubinBlogger If no evidence,  let the FBI tell us its a nothing burger. This GOP is out to destroy our rights as women, destroy Americans "home of the free, land of the brave" freedoms as we know them. Women of all ethnicities should stand together. We don't know these women's struggles.

Then a woman 2nd, I guess. 	Me I'm a Black 63 yr. old Sister that can/will speak up for all  women and human rights. I'm a regular everyday American, that the tax scam didn't help. Y'all are cutting benefit programs I paid into.
Why?? @PressSec , you're  a woman and a mother and you mean to tell me you agree with them taking away programs that WE benefit from, you feel great about that, @PressSec ??? History won't remember YOU well, if you dont represent better. But you're a Gop-er 1st huh?
I know you all are on your way to the Carolinas,  I hope to help citizens instead of golfing. But back to my convo, these men have been allowed without a single @GOP female to speak up about womens rights, womens healthcare, etc., @NationalNOW @democracynow
