@Polymathically So in the 1500s the conquistadors brought disease to the Mexican region.  This disease killed many indigenous.  In an effort to replace the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the Spanish brought slaves from Africa. Hence my blood. Also explains my heavy influence of Spanish DNA.

@AsurionCares This is ridiculous.  This is my third or fourth attempt to resolve.  Collectively a full work day of wasted time.  Current hold time is now two hours and 29 minutes.
@AsurionCares I‚Äôve been trying to get a refund of the duplicate billing since November.  I keep getting promised that it will be done but nada.  The transactions occurred in October. The carrier is ATT.
@AsurionCares The first replacement was a dud and had to be returned.  The second replacement phone was a working refurb.
@AsurionCares The problem was that I was charged the $225 deductible each time a phone was sent.  So I was charged $450 total for replacing one phone.  The error by @AsurionCares was to bill me twice.  The second billboard by was a duplicate as I only received one functioning replacement.
@AsurionCares Taylor.  In October I requested a replacement phone for my daughter.  The phone was sent.  But it was defective so after trying to make it work it was sent back and @AsurionCares sent a second replacement.  That one worked. We swapped out with bad phone and sent back.

@justinlmark Okay, one last one but this is it.....   China has made US businesses hundreds of billions of dollars.  In fact, Trump himself has saved tens of millions if not more buying steel from China. Buying from China a business can hire 10 people.  Made in US a business can hire three.
@justinlmark Did you get the part about the $100 backpack?		Anyway, gonna hit the gym. Great chatting with you.  Let's do it again sometime.
@justinlmark It's why macroeconomic models work today and become useless tomorrow. The levers are constantly changing and the amount of influence attributed to each lever changes over time.
@justinlmark Ours used to be innovation but we got drunk and fat on our success and other countries now eat our lunch. More equitable trade policies should be explored and they are a continuous process. But the simple supply and demand curve works in high school econ but not in the real world
@justinlmark Justin, ever take a macroeconomics class. If you have you understand that in a globally interdependent economy the rules of supply and demand do not work that way... particularly when you insert self interest. Each country must decide its role in the puzzle.
@justinlmark So I can profit. So our sales team can pay rent, car, food.  So our seamstresses can do the same.  So the people working at the port can do the same.  So the truck driver, shipping supplies employees, on and on can all make a reasonable living. Yes.
@justinlmark How many people will pay over $100 for a backpack?  Especially when the China made backpacks sell for $25-$45.  But if I could I would do it in a heartbeat!
@justinlmark The problem is cost.  A US made backpack made in Fountain Valley, CA costs around $35 to make ! Then add my 35% gross profit margin and then add that resellers like Walmart, etc. require at least a 50% profit margin.  So the backpack I make in the US must sell for well over $100!
@justinlmark I knew that one would come up.  I make product in the US for my clients that require US made.  I would LOVE to make ALL my products here.  It's a pain in the ass dealing for China or Hong Kong or Vietnam. Can't tell you how many times they screw things up.
@justinlmark Open your eyes.  Their corrupt on both sides. President to me is a figurehead. Until his nonsense affects my family.  Then it's personal.
@justinlmark And finally, this man's trade policies are literally taking money from my kid's college fund.
@justinlmark - at least those that made a promise before God to honor their spouse. I teach my children to be good human beings and kind to each other and to understand the other in order to resolve conflict. Again, fail.
@justinlmark I'm a husband, father and business owner. Party doesn't matter if the person is doing what's best for me, my family and my business.  This guy is failing on all three fronts.  I am loyal to my spouse and believe men should be
@justinlmark of encouraging our kids in school, helping with homework and setting the right example. Take that phone away from the kids and show them how to write code to make up their own game. That's what my folks did to us and three out of three of us graduated with UCLA degrees. It works.
@justinlmark but I couldn't exist without them.   Now if you are talking about high tech/high paying jobs being taken, those folks are not crawling under the barbed wire.  They are being recruited straight out of India and China by US tech companies because our parents do a shitty job
@justinlmark I employ seamstresses. Despite seeking U.S. born seamstresses, none ever take the job. It's a decent pay at $15/hour. But none will do the work. So I hire foreign born citizens or those naturalized and able to work. They have few options due to language issues and education
@justinlmark By the way, this argument has been made for decades... the job argument. And study and study has found that by and large, the jobs being taken are those that U.S. born are unwilling to do. It's the type of job beneath most Americans but that still must be done.
@justinlmark I thought we were talking the wall.  There was a technique we learned in school when a debate was going the wrong direction. It was to change the topic. I bit on your bait...don't switch it on me. It reflects poorly on you.
@justinlmark 7/  to increase the deficit that the worst democrat. So, yes, a wall is a bad idea as it is wasteful when there are solutions with greater efficacy.
@justinlmark 6/  there is nowhere to hide with a solid technology solution. Let's work smarter, not harder and make better use of our money. In my day Republicans were about being fiscally responsible. Bring back Ronald Reagan because this guy has done more
@justinlmark 5/ It's so much more effective to use technology to monitor the area. Due to the size and tough terrain, something along the lines of geofencing would provide better surveillance. With the exception of spaces close to populations,
@justinlmark 4/ As a businessperson you quickly learn to put the money where it is most effective. The problem with government spending is that it's like monopoly money. It's never real to politicians. I would be Trump would choose differently if the money was coming from his personal biz.
@justinlmark 3/ The effect is fewer opportunities so fewer people coming over. The $5 billion is much better spent on squashing the businesses that hire undocumented than giving it to Trump's cronies to build a wall at $250/hour.
@justinlmark 2/ The people are coming in at a fraction of the rate they came in years and decades ago.  This is largely due to enforcement of businesses.  The IRS can spot fraudulent tax IDs and launch investigations of businesses more easily. In addition, raids occur more regularly.
@justinlmark 1/ Contrary to what's said, the drugs, coming in by the ton, are not being sneaked in on the backs of people.   They come in by boat, tunnel and truck. So that's not going to do ANYTHING to stop the flow.
@justinlmark 3/2  hand. So, to answer your question, his policies have been a fuckin' nightmare for my business.  Any more questions?
@justinlmark 2/2 will rise to 25% by summer. I definitely can't pass that on and it will kill a very large part of my business.  My business does business worldwide out of California.  I'll have to set up shop in another country to accept my inventory if the tariffs continue to get out of...
@justinlmark 1/2 1.  Last week Trump's battle with the Chinese cost me an additional 10% in tariffs at the port to bring in my shipments. That's 10% straight out of my bottom line because my customers will likely not bear an increase of that much.  And according to the freight forwarder it

had spent the prior three years living in a fraternity house and loved me my keg parties. After graduation I lived on the beach with two housemates. We held weekly parties and suddenly had some money to afford the good stuff. Was hired but OPM gal was not impressed by my antics.
This whole Ford/Kavanaugh issue brought to mind the uncomfortable meeting I had nearly 30 years ago with folks from the Office of Personnel Management as I was getting approved for a role with U.S. Treasury. I had just graduated from UCLA,

@yanju007 I‚Äôm not sure FBI will advance the case. Work through it yourself.  Think about what you would do if you were the lead investigator and the evidence you are likely to find. No physical evidence. No video. No audio.
@limbertqc I think initially.  But I also think that over decades, working so closely with smart cogent people ultimately moves both towards center than extreme.
@sally_elder I agree.  I think that‚Äôs a Trump thing.  I think Trump told him to ‚Äúman up‚Äù and hold firm and not agree.  He has to comply to keep his nomination.   My thoughts.
I didn‚Äôt like the cheekiness targeted at dems. Would prefer the professional tone. Obviously a little POTUS coaching at half time.

@CocktailShaking I agree. I am sure a more perfect candidate could be found.
@trenchtown208 That, while half joking, might actually be the strongest support. Although I was pretty straight during two a days.
@CocktailShaking I agree on the politics.  I vehemently disagree on the win at all costs strategy, if that is the strategy.  Again, only two people know the truth.  The rest of us are spectators.  And that‚Äôs the problem.  If it was me I would be at my wits endknowing that there is no way to prove
@ClaraIlena 2/2 Don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I‚Äôm not saying he is innocent.  I am just saying he doesn‚Äôt sound guilty to me.
@ClaraIlena 1/2 That‚Äôs a different argument.  That‚Äôs politics. I put myself in the shoes of someone being falsely accused and there is nothing more I could do than he is to protect my name.  How do you prove that something did not happen?
@CocktailShaking Honestly, it‚Äôs your filter.  When I listened to Dr Ford I was sold.  But listening to him i also consider it credible.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I have never experienced what women go through every day that I give benefit of doubt.
@EnderHates Nothing will change.  Just two lives forever changed in negative way.  It is unfortunate for them.  If there is a winner it is the rest of us as this has created dialogue between parents and children.  Has for me and my oldest in HS.
Dr. Ford was so believable. Kavanaugh is also. Truly will become he said/she said and come down to personal biases/preferences.  No winner here.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all selling!  Well then buy!‚Äù -- my conversation with my wife today regarding Bitcoin.
Hey @MeridioRE   I am fascinated by tokenization and fractional ownership.  I have a 1-4 income property in Los Angeles County with roughly 50% equity.  Would consider making a case study so I can use results  in a future blockchain book. Let me know.
So imagine that you wanted to invest in a large commercial building but didn‚Äôt have a large budget.  Then some savvy RE investor decided to sell stakes in his high rise by selling security coins. So you bought partial coins like you would Bitcoin. That just seems too easy.
