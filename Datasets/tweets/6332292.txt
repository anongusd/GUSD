@CahnEmily It's certainly improving in that regard (new parkland, lots of breweries). And there's convenient ferry and subway service to Manhattan. It actually takes me less time to get to my office in the East Village from LIC than it does from the Upper East Side

@FlyingHighRyan Also from an academic point of view, it’s arguably a field in aviation that has the biggest original research potential. And it’s largely research friendly, compared to many other fields where a lot of things are confidential.

@FlyingHighRyan Similar penalty too, but they're able to lift closer to 390000 lbs vs. 380000 lbs https://t.co/41MZNrTpch
I missed this! The 787-10 is already doing some international hops. UAL807 will still be the longest flight to date. https://t.co/yZOl2C7klS
@robpegoraro Lots of blocked space, especially compared to the aft (which just has empty seats). Wonder if it's a center of gravity issue?
Some of today's WX aspects are better than standard, performance-wise (the temperature is lower, so lower density altitude). Meanwhile, the winds headed westbound are definitely not calm. So this is an approximation, but still a good illustration of how the 787-10 can do it. 5/
Let's look at the -10's performance. At 6,000 nm on a standard day (sea level, altimeter 29.92, temperature 15ºC) with no wind, the -10's max OEW + payload (no fuel) is a little more than 380,000 lbs (with shorter range, the -10 can haul 425,000 lbs), so 11% payload hit. 4/ https://t.co/LvQt5YD1Uk
@the_mad_birds @FlyingHighRyan It's filed as a -10 in the GDS and with the FAA
United ferried in the plane (N14001) from LAX overnight for it to run the PEK route today. 3/
I also believe this is the first time that United has flown the 787-10 in international revenue service. That's not supposed to start until the spring, when it operates a number of European routes (and TLV) out of EWR. Anyway, follow along here: https://t.co/XRMtaGIsNK		2/
Some cool 787-10 news. United will be flying it as UAL807 from IAD to PEK, a flight of 6,014 nm. The 787-10 can do that with a bit of a weight restriction, and today's load is less than full.		My understanding is that this is the longest revenue 78X flight to date. 1/

FAA Confirmation (1:46 CST): The controllers are back on position and the airspace is back to full capacity. It will likely take some time to work through the delays. Please contact the airlines for specific flight information, including the number of delays and cancellations.
Ground stops are lifted at DFW and DAL, though DFW is still reporting 60-minute departure delays.
Just got another update from the FAA, as of 1:27 CST:		- DFW DPS is clearing the remaining smoke from the building.	-FAA expects TRACON to be open within 30 minutes	- After TRACON reopens, ground stop will be gradually lifted as the airspace gets back to full volume
Traffic appears to be moving again around Dallas — unclear if the TRACON reopened or if TRACON controllers are using contingency radar from the Tower. 		Key point: TRACON and Tower = Two separate facilities, but both happen to be at DFW. Wouldn't take long to relocate.
@ShaquilleAKhan yup
Lots of aircraft waiting to depart from runways 18L and 17R at DFW https://t.co/HQ6HTtx980

@WandrMe Did some research. It seems like two things are being conflated here -- 14 CFR 21 which deals with STCs and aircraft modifications and InFO 13010, which is the PED guidance. Likely their issue has to do with possibility of projectiles in an emergency https://t.co/Q8zihbuMqA
@AcesHighAFC Definitely a thought, but that would require renegotiation of CPAs to fund such a program. Regionals don't have enough of a margin to afford something like that. And so long as the US3 keep hiring ~1,000 a year, I think an 8-10 years lock would be hard to stomach, even w/training
@AcesHighAFC And on the flip side you have folks who go to ERAU/UND/Purdue/other powerhouse aviation universities and who do graduate but don't get their ratings via the school's 141 program and go to the local Part 61 outfit instead. Same ineligibility.
@AcesHighAFC Perhaps over time! That said, Part 141 isn't a silver bullet and they might need to start making concessions to folks who obtain their ratings via Part 61 too

@MickiMaynard He was a little wobbly but seemed stabilized until that gust or windshear got him right at touchdown and absolutely did the right thing to hit the TOGA button. My thinking is that the other option would be a nosegear collapse and loss of directional control
As Micki says, this is absolutely a scenario that pilots train for, and is safe. https://t.co/52hFMG7YnQ
@MickiMaynard Yes — this was perfectly safe! Just incredible to witness

@AirlineFlyer It's something
An early 1980s concept for a larger 767: The 767-X. It's a section of 757 fuselage piggybacking at the aft of a 767, a concept nicknamed the Hunchback of Mukilteo. Long story short, this morphed into the 777 we know today.		Photos: Boeing https://t.co/KyCqaUBtyD

2. Data protection: Pilot unions care about safety, but have long feared that FOQA could result in disciplinary action against individual pilots. FOQA data is trended at anonymized at the large guys. But it's hard to anonymize at an airline with a handful of aircraft &amp; pilots
I can see two challenges for Part 135 operators and FOQA. 		1. Cost: It costs time and money to set up a FOQA system. Part 135 folks don't have the deepest pockets. But you can't put a price tag on someone's life, can you?		(con't)
FOQA is a powerful safety assurance tool. It involves what's known as a QAR -- a quick access recorder -- which is basically a black box flight data recorder that airlines have access to the data from. Airlines are able to analyze unsafe trends and proactively fix problems.
This is a really important set of safety recommendations.		NTSB is recommending that Part 135 operators (generally smaller outfits operating for hire) implement a flight data monitoring program. That's popularly known as FOQA, or flight operations quality assurance. (1/2) https://t.co/1ih2ik05mU

Re-upping this from my thread earlier. It was someone at the FAA Command Center in Warrenton, Va., who decided to code the situation at into LGA as staffing-related. A lot of this stuff had been going on before today. What was eye-popping was that it said staffing. https://t.co/IRtLUTzPam
I think over the past 35 days, Americans have gotten an opportunity to learn about the U.S. air transportation system and how much it depends on the U.S. government. Sure, "deregulation" happened in 1978, but aviation in the U.S. is still very heavily regulated.
@CahnEmily whoops, made plans for Tuesday night
The FAA still does not have a permanent administrator. @WSJ reported that Steve Dickson, formerly of Delta, was Trump's pick. But Dickson was never nominated in the 115th or 116th Congress. Deputy admin. Daniel  Elwell continues to serve as acting admin. https://t.co/JEuiUYOjRe

Sometimes ground delays/ground stops are what's required for controllers to meet those type of restrictions. Too many planes too close together and airspace (and airports) will be over capacity.
Some of these are departure-related, some of them are arrival-related. For LGA, here's what N90 is requesting: 20 miles between planes from the north, 15 miles between planes from the south and 15 miles between planes from the west. https://t.co/qeLlVGt2Mf

@patjchile Embry-Riddle
Airlines really do collaborate with the FAA on these sorts of things. Airlines have direct lines to the FAA Command Center, and there are daily conference calls that allow airlines and FAA planners to determine best course of action. Collaboration is what makes everything work.
Some airlines are putting out statements noting minimal disruption from today's air traffic control situation. Given what we know, I agree with those statements.		That said, controllers work in shifts, and unclear what staffing impact will be later in the day.

An enroute center "shutting down" is a big deal. In 2014, a contractor set fire to the basement of Chicago ARTCC (ZAU), and the airspace *was* shut down for weeks. https://t.co/T7BZ4e74Tg
The ground stop at LGA has been lifted. Average delays for inbound flights is 86 minutes. Delays get much, much worse at LGA for a summer thunderstorm or winter snowstorm https://t.co/VWPdbY5kgD
This @washingtonpost headline is a correct assessment of what is happening https://t.co/cT3V45gNko
@jackgillum that would be baad
Airspace around Washington is *not* shut down.		That's not correct.		There is a staffing issue at Washington Center (ZDC) in Warrenton, Va. That center handles enroute traffic between New Jersey and the Carolinas. 		There's also weather playing a role.		Airspace is open. https://t.co/mVbSUovlrV
RT @FAANews: #FAA Statement: Staffing Update https://t.co/CMVcyTNSz5
Today's staffing issues are not being caused by the men and women at LaGuardia tower. There are other enroute facilities that sequence aircraft into LGA that are reporting shortages.
This is correct https://t.co/YyHC0I6ubr
Also, no, controllers are not going to strike or do a formal sickout. That's illegal. And most controllers know what happened the last time that happened (https://t.co/RstRHgC44A)
RT @ShimonPro: FAA: We have experienced a slight increase in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities affecting New York and Florid…
@jackgillum Can't say for sure, but it's definitely possible
If you're scheduled to fly out of LGA today, there's a good chance you'll fly out of LGA today. (But as they say, check with your airline.)
It's a ground stop. So flights destined for LGA are being held at their departure airports until the ground stop is lifted. It's not a situation that's causing planes already in the air to divert. LGA is open for business and safe. https://t.co/tidKch68zR
4. As others have said quite eloquently, controllers are safety professionals. Safety is their job. If people are not showing up to work, the system will continue to move (albeit with some ground stop/"halts"). Things will just move a little slower, and that's for safety. /end
3. What's impactful about what happened with LGA just now is the fact that the FAA command center, which is staffed by both union (NATCA) and FAA managers, coded the ground stop as staffing-related. That's a big deal and designed to send a message
2. Flow programs (expect departure clearance time — EDCTs) as well as ground stops are generally not uncommon. Flights get "halted" for weather quite a bit
Regarding the situation at LGA:		1. If you follow the national airspace system closely, as I do, you know that there have been a number of seemingly inexplicable delays/ground stops since the shutdown started

Yesterday's @qz obsession email about air traffic control is an excellent overview https://t.co/3hAOtuqO1D
MilAir is probably one of the biggest examples of the legislative branch using executive branch resources. Another is agency support for constituent casework. 		On the flip side, the SOTU is one of the biggest examples of executive branch using legislative branch resources.
Also, CODELs rely heavily on State Department resources on the ground in these countries, especially embassies. Trump wouldn't refuse consular services to Pelosi, but he could cancel any other support required from DOS for the trips.
So I'm not sure a president can just arbitrarily cancel a speaker's CODEL. He can certainly cancel her request for milair (military aircraft), which is a DOD asset under POTUS' control. If Cap Police/House SAA have security concerns w/commercial air it effectively cancels CODEL.

This is nicely illustrated by James Reason's safety space concept. It's fundamental for any organization designing a safety management system (SMS). There will be a lot of talk about UAS SMS in the coming years, for sure. /end thread https://t.co/6j2dxCW9y0
The challenge for authorities like UK CAA and US FAA is to find the balance between creating a regulatory environment that prevents situations like Gatwick (and things like that still unconfirmed 737 collision last week) and creating a positive economic environment for it.
UAS will be an important part of lots of airspace systems in the future. They're not going away (been seeing some tweets like that this morning)...
In short, it ruins it for good actors in the UAS community. Politically, there could be desire for more regulations, or maybe that necessary waiver will be harder to obtain.
When UAS operators behave the way the individual(s) at Gatwick are behaving today, it's an affront to the lawful operators who spend time, money and resources to legally use UAVs to and see the benefits from it. It's a setback to the entire community.
@WandrMe @united That switched to a 788 yesterday and will be operated by a 787 for the foreseeable future. I assume it's part of UA getting the EWR 787 base started up

Officially, Anchorage Tower is closed by NOTAM until tomorrow at 2000z (3 p.m. EST/11 a.m. local), but these can and do get canceled early https://t.co/lIWzfZ66s7

@HowardSlutsken @AirlineFlyer @AirCanada Here are the restrictions on the current Jepp chart — deals with speed restrictions and turns vs. outright bans on certain taxiways https://t.co/9sRIwAAbr5
@HowardSlutsken @AirlineFlyer @AirCanada Restrictions stem from the taxiways, not necessarily the terminals
@HowardSlutsken @AirlineFlyer @AirCanada Not 100% on this but I think that might get tricky because Rouge has a different flight attendant union than mainline does. Could be seen as "taking away flying" from mainline
@AirlineFlyer @AirCanada Looked into this more. Forget about the weight issue, wingspan is going to be the issue here.		764 is the largest aircraft allowed into LGA. Wingspan: 170'4"		788/789 wingspan: 197'3"	333 wingspan: 197'10" 	(Wow, those are close!)
@AirlineFlyer @AirCanada If the pavement loading for the 787/A330 is kosher for LGA (more money on the former than the latter) then that, I'd say

On the topic of LaGuardia, hearing that the first concourse of the new terminal B is set to open in December, before the holiday rush. It's unclear exactly which airlines are going to move there. My guess is that's being negotiated with @PANYNJ as we speak.
@apoure25 @jonostrower Oh yes
@apoure25 @jonostrower Uhh, more like everyone left at LSC is now googling rentals/homes in Orlando after today's news
@HAbbott4 I don't, because DCA is essentially walking distance from National Landing so that's where I think all the action will be. It's also hard to compete against United on transcon at IAD
@AirlineFlyer @alex_nieves @WandrMe @PANYNJ They have but I'm sure they'll make exceptions for a high yield opportunity like this
@AirlineFlyer @WandrMe AS/DL could use A321neo (when DL gets 'em)/738/73G
@AirlineFlyer @WandrMe @PANYNJ No, not really. It can barely do DEN on a hot day there.
@WandrMe @PANYNJ Exactly, since Cuomo effectively controls half of the Port he can make it happen, especially with the amount sway that Amazon has over him right now with this project
@PANYNJ Also look for AS to exercise its rights (conditional on the perimeter rule) to take back some of its LGA slots leased to WN and to start nonstop SEA service. (BG: https://t.co/BsD3EM4qRr)		Expect something similar to play out at DCA, where AS &amp; others already have exceptions.
With today's announcement about part of HQ2 moving to Long Island City, look for Delta to pressure @PANYNJ to lift LaGuardia's 1,500-mile perimeter rule, with the NY side of the Port OK'ing it. (1/2)

@e_russell @Dulles_Airport @WandrMe That's true. And with some markets geography comes into play. For instance, how many people from BOS will fly 413 miles in the opposite direction to IAD in order to get to Europe? EWR also in the wrong direction but half the distance/flying time.
@e_russell @Dulles_Airport It would fit the model of pushing connections to IAD and making EWR more of an O&amp;D operation. EWR-BOS has a bunch of mainline frequencies, sometimes even of 739s
United's 777-300ER (same length as the A-market -300, 242'4") seats 2 more than its 777-200A, 366 vs. 364. It's 10-across in the back but generally lower density because the Polaris cabin seats 60 and stretches almost to door 3. https://t.co/1AVTTisWOo

Will be interesting to see which metal is used for these EWR routes, which would be Summer '19 leisure routes. My guess will be 763/764, though it's possible the EWR 787 base could be online by April, in time for this flying.
@e_russell The replies also revealed 'em :)

You can watch a live feed of the Gulfstream reportedly carrying Post Malone here. They're a couple minutes out, according to air traffic control https://t.co/VxnbWS2pTK
3/Planes are designed for occupants to survive the actual impact. Post-impact fires are the bigger risk.
2/	- These types of landings happen, and people are usually able to walk away from them	- Risk is if the wing, which contains fuel, becomes compromised on the landing. Sparks from the aircraft contacting the runway could ignite the fuel
1/Regarding the Gulfstream IV that reportedly has Post Malone on board (not confirmed):		- The Gulfstream IV has tail-mounted engines. That makes a fire less likely 	- The runway they will land is 11,800 feet long. They'll try to hold the plane low and slow to bleed off speed

UA, AA both have GEnx. HA's order is for GEnx. Avianca leases their planes from a U.S.-based lessor and thus has to follow U.S. airworthiness directives, like this one. https://t.co/RlSWBqUag6
ETOPS = regulations generally for 2-engine planes (though it covers larger planes now too) dealing w/how far a plane can fly from a suitable diversion airport. In this case, the 787s with RR engines could go 330 minutes (5.5 hours) on a single engine from a suitable airport.
The FAA's AD is out for Rolls Royce Trent 1000-equipped 787s, which is about 25 percent of the fleet.		It strips 330 minute ETOPS down to 140 minute ETOPS. You can still do transatlantic hops with 140, but not much else the 787 was designed for with its range. https://t.co/ecMDICSLLY

Congress is delegated the power to impose tariffs in the Constitution’s enumerated powers clause (Article I Section 8), which they later delegated to the president. But should they yank it back there probably wouldn’t be a constitutional issue.
This would probably mean that Congress would pass a law revoking Trump's authority, he'd veto it and Congress would override it. Seems like no one wants this so 2/3 for override seems like a possibility. https://t.co/98UxTUQxBn

Trump says airline pilots carry guns now. That's true, some do, under the federal flight deck officer program run by TSA. My understanding is that the guns have only been fired by accident.

@marinafang about a common @ethanklapper topic :P
@AirlineFlyer here's my takedown https://t.co/BVNQb8jBGD
This is quite timely, because Shuster is by far the no. 1 proponent of ATC privatization in Congress. Trump's signature aviation initiative just got dealt a huge blow. https://t.co/ukIuUGEDtv
CRM is a massive success and has saved countless lives. https://t.co/lDRmG2fJdQ
@MEPFuller you know it
Also, when you look at OZ214, you see it likewise was a training/CRM issue. Which is exclusively was in the purview of the Korean authorities. https://t.co/5o8CVlDHiu
Good question. We're talking U.S.-flagged carriers operating under Part 121 and 135. Part 129 (foreign flagged) doesn't count, because most regulation lies with the foreign government, not something within WH/DOT/FAA purview. https://t.co/5o8CVlDHiu
9/The WH did mention the new enhanced security measures for international flights into the U.S., which the Trump admin can take credit for.		But when it comes to other facets of aviation safety, Trump's record....isn't really there yet https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
8/But Trump hasn't nominated a permanent successor for Huerta. The Trump administration has known about this vacancy date since Huerta announced in December of 2016 he would serve out his full term. The WH declined to comment when asked about a timetable https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
7/Meanwhile, the last day in office for FAA Administrator Michael Huerta is Saturday (5-year term). Huerta was nominated by Obama. His deputy, Daniel Elwell, is a Trump appointee and will be acting administrator.... https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
6/Trump rolled it out with much fanfare in June, then the Senate killed the idea about 2 weeks later. It's dead for now. https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
5/Trump's primary aviation initiative is ATC privatization, which has been controversial for years. Airlines love it, general aviation hates it (it will cost $ to use ATC) and the ATC union is warm to it (though some individual members hate it) https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
4/In 2010, the Democratic Congress passed and President Obama signed the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010. Most notably, it requires a minimum of 1,500 hours if you want to fly a commercial jet https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
3/That was the crash of Colgan Air 3407 in Buffalo. 50 people died (49 on the plane and 1 on the ground). Congress actually did act after that crash... https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
2/No one died on a commercial airplane **globally** in 2017. The safest year ever **globally**. But no one has died on a commercial plane in the U.S. since February 2009 https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
1/I looked into Trump's tweet this morning about airline safety, and there are a couple of things to note... https://t.co/rC6v4oKdqA
CNN thinks Northwest Airlines is alive and well. Also United tulip 757s and American 727s. https://t.co/64CCFeos9j
