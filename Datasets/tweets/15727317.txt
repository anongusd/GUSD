And this isn’t to say the DC region isn’t already pretty bad with inequality. But could get much worse.
Fed govt can’t just relocate somewhere else. But region needs to be affordable so that public workers can live here. Otherwise what happens?
Companies like Amazon exacerbate inequality, make cost of living impossible for people who have to then move. But what happens if the DC region becomes even worse? Fed govt employees don’t get paid a lot. And they need to live here bc the fed govt has to be located here. (1/x)

The FBI agents also remembered Hill saying something. But Hill said she had clearly said something else. That was also used to discredit her, as if she was dissembling.
Hill talked to the FBI before her testimony. She gave far more detail in her testimony about what Thomas did. That made the FBI look like they had done a sloppy job interviewing her. So they decided to throw her under the bus and suggest that she was embellishing her story now.
People are pinning a lot of their hopes on the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. But it might not have the outcome you expect: In 1991, Anita Hill's FBI interview ended up being used against her by the GOP. https://t.co/2w5HCC1xCd

@MEPFuller @The_H_Train @DohaMadani What? The office temp here is definitely more Cuomo. And I’m saying that as someone who thinks 76 is too hot.
The federal workers I talked to said they couldn’t remember anything like this happening. Usually, flag lowering is standard. You are told a start and end date. That’s it. Nothing like the drama yesterday.
A USDA employee who sent out the order to lower the flag, and then sent out the cancellation notice, got such backlash from employees that she had to email again to clarify it wasn’t her making the decision.
One postal worker told me it was really embarrassing for them: "In small towns when you lower the flag people want to know why and use it as a signal to lower their own. It put us all in a bad position to explain why we would be putting our flags back up"
Trump’s flag drama created serious confusion across the fed gov’t. Places like post offices, national parks got 3 emails yesterday: Lower the flag, don’t lower the flag, okay lower the flag. https://t.co/Mz06O9glMV
