This kind of coordinated system has a track record of success with other complex crime and we should be applying it to mass shootings.
Whether it was Parkland or most recently Aurora, when law enforcement doesn’t coordinate and laws are not enforced, people who shouldn’t have guns fall through the cracks.
We have many levels of law enforcement and thousands of laws across this country that work every day to prevent gun violence, but we can do better.
We could create another law that does nothing but infringe on law-abiding citizens’ Second Amendment right or we could create a system that could have stopped the last mass shooting and might stop the next.
I joined several of my colleagues in introducing the Mass Violence Prevention Act to combat mass shootings as the federal government has done with terrorism, drug trafficking, and child exploitation.

Instead, we should be spurring innovation through public-private partnerships and the committee should be focused on how we’re going to make the investments in infrastructure that we need with fewer dollars going into the Highway Trust Fund.
We don’t have to propose impractical ideas, like eliminating air travel or mandating electrical vehicles and public transportation in parts of the country where it doesn’t make sense.

Instead of Speaker Pelosi’s $1 offer for a wall, abolishing ICE, and weaker border security, President Trump and Republicans have secured $22.5 billion dollars to secure our border, including ➡️ https://t.co/bQ6bJBBPHJ
This bill ensures the federal government doesn’t shut down, federal workers are paid, and our border will be more secure than it was yesterday.
Despite Speaker Pelosi promising no wall, there will be 55 miles of new border structure along parts of our southern border, nearly $1.4B in funding to build border structures, 1,200 more border agents &amp; significant investments in surveillance technology because of this bill.
Last Congress, I voted time and time again for significantly more funding for a border structure, but each time, Democrats and Republicans let the perfect become the enemy of the good and because of that, we now must face the realities of a divided Congress.
Yesterday, I voted for the compromise border security and funding bill that passed Congress and President Trump is expected to sign.

The House &amp; Senate both voted to provide back pay for all federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the government shutdown as soon as the shutdown is over. I urge the Democrats to come to the table &amp; negotiate with President Trump to reopen the govt.
Both sides know border structures work and they need to set politics aside and negotiate a deal with President Trump that reopens the government and strengthens border security. Refusing to compromise is not the way to govern and will do nothing to open the government.
President Trump has made the case for a border structure and has demonstrated a willingness to compromise on what that looks like. Many Democrats voted to fund these border structures. https://t.co/b7b69xq2vv

Learn more about the bill here: 		https://t.co/dI3zGXRfrP
By repealing these outdated provisions that unfairly penalize public servants in Illinois, we can provide some certainty to retirees while helping to recruit future teachers, firefighters, and police officers.
This bill ensures that a teacher who spends his or her summers working a second job or a police officer who changes careers after years of service will not face a possible 40 percent reduction in their Social Security benefits.
These two titles of the Social Security Act unfairly reduce or eliminate Social Security benefits for millions of Americans who have devoted much of their careers to public service.
This week, I introduced the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, which eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO).
This year, I had the privilege of nominating 15 accomplished young men and women from Illinois to our nation’s service academies. I applaud these students for their decision to serve and wish them the best of luck.		https://t.co/TGCYiYIF5I

Despite this bill having the four pillars of policies negotiated by President Trump and Democrats, many in Congress let politics get in the way of governing today.
This bill has the support of the president, immediate funding for the border wall, a solution for DACA recipients, merit-based legal immigration reforms, and measures to prevent the separation of families.
I’m disappointed in Republicans and Democrats who instead of voting for a bill that has solutions to the immigration problems we all continue to talk about, they voted to solve nothing and keep the status quo.

Today marks the beginning of a new year &amp; a new tax code. Under this tax code, the American people keep more of what they earn, American businesses can compete &amp; grow, &amp; America's economy can win globally. Wishing you &amp; our country a prosperous New Year! https://t.co/gFI6h2VLUZ

As we count down to 2018, let's review this year. Below is 2017 by the numbers. Click here to check out some of the most memorable moments from this year: https://t.co/tFSqvaeGfF https://t.co/V1klOOs8Im
A new year with a new tax code means Americans at every income level will see their tax rates reduced. Most taxpayers should see a difference starting with their February paychecks when less money is sent to Washington. Learn more: https://t.co/raoEXLDOIG. https://t.co/vpIP9xnsxz
The House passed 477 bills this year. Click here for highlights: https://t.co/tFSqvaeGfF https://t.co/ieRphDot9M
Our new tax code doubles the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 per child and expands it to allow more families to benefit from it. Learn more about the advantages our new tax code provides families here: https://t.co/raoEXLDOIG. https://t.co/hsq9TYMy2p
Getting rid of special interest loopholes means more Americans get to keep more of what they earn. Roughly 9 out of 10 taxpayers will be able to pay taxes using a simple postcard. Learn more --&gt; https://t.co/raoEXLmdk6 https://t.co/WxAx7wzGL9
RT @AmericaNewsroom: LISTEN: @RodneyDavis spoke with @RickLeventhal about making tax cuts permanent https://t.co/TwxPzd1CGQ
I’ll be joining @AmericaNewsroom in just a few minutes to discuss tax cuts &amp; how I want to make them permanent for working Americans. Be sure to tune in!
Many will see bigger paychecks come Feb because Washington will withhold less. These companies &amp; others have already announced more employee investments: 	@Boeing 	@WellsFargo 	@FifthThird 	@ATT 	@comcast 	@PNC 	@WeAreSinclair @BankofAmerica 	@Aflac 	@Nelnet	@oceanfirstbank https://t.co/YdVqwKMAxM
137 economists agree, "As a result of sitting idly by while the rest of the world took steps to lower their corporate rates, we lowered our own workers' wages by thousands of dollars a year.” The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act changes that. https://t.co/tA64i0cxB6 https://t.co/y0n14128jd
To simplify &amp; double the standard deduction (75% of #IL13 takes), we get rid of many special interest loopholes but keep deductions many middle-income Americans rely on. Click here for a list —&gt; https://t.co/raoEXLDOIG https://t.co/JB7ZHn825i
Giving is the reason for the season. Our new tax code continues and expands the charitable tax deduction. Learn more here: https://t.co/raoEXLmdk6 https://t.co/HV0o4s0WxE

137 economists agree #TaxReform will lead to “more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.” AT&amp;T, Boeing, Comcast, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bancorp, all announced investments in their workforce before the bill was signed. https://t.co/9oq4gvB1pk

10 days from a New Year and a new tax code. Counting down some of the most important aspects of #taxreform. Starting with doubling the standard deduction, meaning the first $12k of a single filer and $24k of a couple’s income is tax free. https://t.co/HDSSPzNeog

Neo Nazis in #Charlottesville are not only racist &amp; wrong but they are offensive to those who sacrificed to never see that flag again 4/15
Went to Normandy in July. Locals still fly Stars&amp;Stripes as thx to the thousands who perished on those beaches &amp;saved world from Nazism 3/15
Stayed in what used to be East Berlin. US &amp; leadership made reunification possible. Real vision &amp;leadership mattered then &amp; matters now 2/15
https://t.co/krd470E5cR
Back from Germany to see terrible white supremacists carrying Nazi flags in VA. They’d be arrested there. Free speech protects here.1/15
Racism we've seen in Charlottesville is immoral &amp; wrong. Hate &amp; vitriol that led to the loss of an innocent life &amp; many injured must stop.

RT @wdws1400: PODCAST: tonight's one hour @RodneyDavis tele-town hall: https://t.co/2Cpzqz1PqD https://t.co/2bt9hv0jyS
Thanks to everyone for tuning in and for asking so many great questions. It's an honor to serve as your representative in Washington.
"We want to make the tax process as simple as possible and allow people to give more to charity at the same time."
"Let's continue to work on making our tax code fairer, flatter, and simpler. It's an issue that we have to address to help all Americans."
The final question tonight comes from Susan in Plainview about tax reform.
"We have a lot of roads that need repair, and we need to make those investments."
Barbara from Staunton has a question regarding infrastructure.
"Continue to be an advocate (for bipartisanship). Rep's and Dem's do get along in DC, &amp; most of what we vote on is truly bipartisan."
Vanessa had a questions about encouraging bipartisanship in today's political climate.
"I will work with the administration on enforcement of trade deals,but we can't pretend deals like NAFTA haven't been good for our economy."
"Trade is crucial to us selling our hometown products overseas. We must have incentives to have global trade opportunities to keep our jobs.
Terri called in with a question about NAFTA and trade issues.
"Coal has a valid and appropriate place in our national energy portfolio, and we'll fight to have those opportunities in the future."
"We'd love to see coal and clean coal technology continue be part of our energy portfolio.These are the energy investments we need to make."
Alan from Springfield has a question about coal jobs in Illinois.
"I'm proud to have sponsored HR 795, which allows companies to help graduates pay off student loan debt."  https://t.co/kMouR9WjEG
"We've seen the staggering student loans that many families face. We must do more than just address the cost of college..."
Patrick from Calhoun County has a question about job opportunities for college graduates.
"I want those who commit the worst crimes to have the longest sentences. I want people to get the help they need over longer sentences."
"Atty General Sessions and I will disagree on the best ways to reform the criminal justice system."
"Criminal justice reform is something I've been talking about during my entire tenure in Congress. We must reform our mandatory minimums."
David from Edwardsville has a question about criminal justice reform.
"We need to ensure we have the educational resources and workforce to ensure these companies can continue to grow."
"We've seen what investment from companies like ADM have done to the Macon County economy."
Alan has a question regarding supporting local jobs.
"I hope we get bipartisanship in regard to fixing a broken tax code... I would like to see a revenue neutral tax reform plan."
"We have been stuck in an anemic economic growth rate... I want to see us grow our economy even more."
"I believe we need to be able to lower tax rates for middle class Americans and put more money in their pockets &amp; close loopholes."
Pamela from Normal called to ask about tax cuts.
"Let's make sure we stop interference, not just in elections, but in any aspect of the US... our economy, cyber attack, &amp; national defense."
"Any interference from any country needs to be investigated and stopped. Which is why you are seeing 3 investigations into Russian's role."
The next caller is Maria, who is asking about foreign influence in elections.
"I want to make our public education system stronger. Last Congress we did just that by reforming "No Child Left Behind" on bipartisan vote.
"I've never been a fan of vouchers proposed... They would not be beneficial to many of the schools in our district due to logistics issues."
Kenneth called to ask about school funding.
"I've always stood up and said I want to support pre-existing conditions."
"I've supported a bill that protects those with pre-existing conditions. The bill we passed has multiple layers of protection."
Evan called in with a question about healthcare and pre-existing conditions.
"The truth is that most bills that pass Congress pass with large bipartisan margins."
"I've seen our country come together in the midst of tragedies... If you just watched cable news, you'd think rep's and dem's don't talk."
"I've been ranked as one of the most moderate Congressman. I've got a reputation of working in a bipartisan way."
The next question comes from Doug in Springfield, who asks about alleviating the division between the political parties.
"It's a major issue we want to tackle. If you have any ideas on updating the tax code, please pass them along to my office."
"It contains many pages of loopholes that both parties talk about eliminating, and that's what we have the opportunity to do."
"Taxes are a major issue that we must address. We have a broken tax code that is way too onerous."
The first question of the evening comes from Stanley, who asks about tax relief at the federal level.
