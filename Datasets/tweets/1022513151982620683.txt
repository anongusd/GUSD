Addie - your dad didn‚Äôt leave you. He was driven away by your mother and her four plus years of lies. The truth will prevail. I pray that you‚Äôll understand when you know the TRUTH! #ParentalAlienation
Love you Addie - sorry that what‚Äôs happened to you has happened - no child should ever be coached to reject a parent - the truth will prevail in due time - xoxo
One day Addie - it will all make sense. Daddy LOVES YOU! https://t.co/aKNIVucjLp
To any human being who uses a child as a weapon - FUCK YOU.
You‚Äôre not the only one Addie. In due time, you will know the truth. https://t.co/HAtyG2ytj1

Still no answer from Ralph Silvestri of columbus Ohio. All I asked him is if he‚Äôs ok with a child being mentally abused.
@fatherscontact So fucken true,,,,,,
Why is the word TRUTH - such a hard thing for people to get.  Are we that f-cked up as a society? Addie - you will know the TRUTH one day. Daddy loves you!

@madncmoms Courtney Cook - sorry Addie - this is who your ‚ÄúMom‚Äù really is. She‚Äôs used you like a pawn for 4 years. Love you - you will know the truth one day. https://t.co/uVrD6WMaf9
That‚Äôs you lying Courtney Cook - this tweet is for you. https://t.co/hKapSoGOCf
When they call to tell you that they will talk to you later - and you don‚Äôt get a chance to actually talk - well that‚Äôs alienation - as she‚Äôs being coached - kinda of like when her ‚Äúmom‚Äù took video of Addie and coached her to say she doesn‚Äôt want to talk.......
So now my daughter calls to tell me that she has to have dinner and she will call me Wednesday. That‚Äôs now the 6 or 7th time this has happened. #ParentalAlienation you will know the truth one day Addie.
RT @EndPASNow: Got to love strangers who judge you without ever meeting you, solely based on the lies the #alienator has fed them. I guess‚Ä¶
@EndPASNow Well said. See Addie - you will know the truth one day.
