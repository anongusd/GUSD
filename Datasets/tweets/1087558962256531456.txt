@cnni @jaketapper How many prisoners have been mistreated or have died in US prisons? Is Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. responsible for each abuse under their watch? You present a very narrow-minded view of systems of incarceration.
@cnni @jaketapper To suggest every head of government in every country should be held responsible for and be knowledgeable of every crime committed within their country's prison system suggests most world leaders, even those you like, are just as evil and guilty as Kim Jong-un.

"Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man."		"The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking."		-Martin Heidegger
"A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies." - Friedrich Nietzsche		Which one are you? I'll wager both.		#politicians #political #politics #quote #quotes
I'm working on a psychoanalysis and deconstruction of Don DeLillo's postmodern novel "White Noise." My focus: failure to repress death anxiety; quest for symbolic immortality; mimetic behaviors; instability of meaning inherent in postmodern ecosystems; how these work together.
The past and the future are illusory constructs of the mind. The present slips by too quickly for real-time interpretation. The only things left for language are ideas. Share yours and respect those of others.
