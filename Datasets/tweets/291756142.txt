These types of grants have historically gone to higher population areas of the country. I am glad that the Trump Administration is working to fund these important projects in more rural areas, such as Wyoming. Thank you @SecElaineChao.
The WYDOT project will add about 5.5 miles of passing lanes and 2 truck parking areas, along with dedicated short-range communication roadside radios.

I specifically appreciate the changes to allow small businesses that in the same association to join together to offer retirement plans for their employees. But Congress should still push for legislation that would expand that option even further.

Our local papers play a vital role in the state and shouldn’t have to struggle to survive because of these tariffs that were being pushed by one company.
It is a relief that the U.S. International Trade Commission has ended tariffs on imports from Canada that were hurting our newspapers in Wyoming and the communities they serve. https://t.co/VSyJtUqV10
His dedication to his country and its defense was unmatched. He was passionate throughout his long years of service to the people of Arizona. Diana and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife Cindy and the entire McCain family as we mourn the passing of an American hero.
Senator John McCain was a true patriot who dedicated his life to serving his country, his constituents and his family with honor. He rightfully earned his maverick moniker with his iron strength of will to stand up and fight for what he believed was right.

As more workers participate in the “gig economy,” they shouldn’t be forced to choose between flexibility &amp; retirement security. Congress should help them save for retirement by allowing a new type of pension plan called open MEPs. Learn more in my op-ed. https://t.co/m2brf9g6DZ

“I know you have been told by some that we should do away with the tax cuts in order to reduce the deficit. That’s like trying to pull a game out in the fourth quarter by punting on third down.” Ronald Reagan said that in 1982. (1/3) https://t.co/EegfTjaH5r

And #TaxReform lowers individual tax rates so people can keep more of their hard-earned money. And this (lengthy) list shows just some of the benefits people will see under the new bill.
#TaxReform continues and expands the deduction for charitable contributions people give to their local church, charity, or community organization.
Under new #TaxReform businesses offering leave for employees to care for sick child, check on elderly parent or take maternity or paternity leave would receive tax credit based on those employees’ wages.
Billions of barrels of oil will be made accessible by opening non-wilderness area of ANWR for responsible energy development thanks to #TaxReform and efforts of @lisamurkowski.
Tuition waivers for graduate students will remain tax free under new #TaxReform.
New #TaxReform keeps current deductions for student loan interest.
Homeowners mortgage-interest rate deduction still available under new #TaxReform on mortgages up to $750,000.
You can still deduct state property, income and sales taxes up to $10,000 under new #TaxReform.
Under new #TaxReform taxpayers with kids can claim an up to $2,000 credit for each qualifying child under 17. That’s double what it was.
#TaxReform means no more penalties for folks who decide not to buy Affordable Care Act insurance because they can’t afford it.
#TaxReform allows taxpayers to deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income.
