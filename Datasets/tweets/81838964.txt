A new term has entered our lexicon: Post Natal Abortion. The term is synonymous with Infanticide. The definition is to intentionally cause death to a baby which has been born alive. Although the practice is not new, it was officially sanctioned by the Democrats on 2/25/2019.
Democrats Support Post-Natal Abortions.
Will the Medicare for all include coverage for Post-Natal Abortions?
@MoveOn Post Natal Abortions
@K_JeanPierre @MoveOn Like Killing the Unborn?
I can see it now: the image of a beautiful newborn baby dying on a cold stainless steel table--along with the 2020 Democrat Presidential Candidate's smiling face. The caption will read, "We don't always kill newborn babies, but when we do we prefer nice big healthy ones".
Now we know that Democrats are Murderous Socialists. What new?
If Democrats continue to say and do openly as they are now, there'll be a lot of Republican Opposition Research workers unemployed next election cycle. There will simply be no need to dig up more dirt. The Democrats are giving it to us for free.
If a woman plans on aborting her baby, should she be allowed to smoke, drink and do drugs while she is pregnant? Is there any logical reason to restrict her?
How long before our people start have Abortion Parties in lieu of Baby Showers?
@maziehirono Translation: if you want to kill your baby, Democrats will support you.

@WendyGoude5 @WalshFreedom Did I say "if"?
The Democrats are harmless--unless Republicans help them. They Control only one half of one of the three branches of Government. In the meantime, they are exposing themselves as the Socialists they truly are. Additionally, they show they hold nothing precious--even human life.
@SenSchumer Can the Democrats in the House of Representatives Override the Republican Senate and President?
@CNanceAnnouncer @WalshFreedom If they feel froggy, let em jump.
@WalshFreedom If the Democrats in the House of Representatives wishes to Impeach Trump, they can. Our Constitution lists that as the sole remedy for a bad President. Afterwards, they will need a 2/3 vote in the Senate to oust him. The ball is in the Democrats' court.
How long before Democrats move the age for legally aborted babies to two-years old? Will they next limit lifespans to 72? Is the real reason for this simply population control to save precious resources? Will the bodies of the dead be recycled as nutritional supplements?

I retired from business after many years. In that time I worked for some really great and talented leaders. The most successful people I worked for were either Liberal Arts majors or those who never quite completed college. Those with higher degrees usually worked for a boss.
@stclairashley @DavidMartinezx Knowledge is as beneficial as you make it. College was meant to teach a person how to learn, think systematically and communicate effectively. A College Education is not job training. If you want job training, go to a vocational school, professional school or get it via OJT.

The 2020 Presidential Election will prove to be the most interesting and important in the history of our Republic. This time Americans will get a straight up or down vote on whether or not we are to become a Socialist Nation. I wonder if Democrats will accept their repudiation.
@mitchellvii All my Prayers.
The Democrats' talk of impeaching Trump is nothing but political noise. They know the Republican controlled Senate will not convict and remove him. Let em talk--it's all they can do. The Democrats don't control enough of our Government to actually do anything.

The Battle the Left is fighting is against God. They know this and they know they can't win. That's the reason for their anger. I can hear them screaming between the lines they speak aloud: "What do you want with us, Son of God, have you come to torment us before our time"?

@McAllisterDen Women soldiers bring some unique problems to combat units. I've witnessed it first-hand. The average woman is not as tough or strong as their male enemies. And, interjecting unavoidable sexual relationships into combat units in battle creates extra stress and internal conflict.
@SoCal1956 Please elaborate.
Would you prefer that your daughters were warriors or mothers?
@McAllisterDen Men are the Protectors of women. As such, it is wrong to place women in harm's way. Scoring political points against feminists is not a good reason to do that which is illogical. It's time to return to traditional values--not destroy what few vestiges of it that still remain.
Which poses the graver danger to the United States: Bovine Flatulence or the Noxious Hot Air coming out of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?

@mitchellvii Depends on who counts the votes.
It's a darn shame for the President to call the Media the "Enemy of the People". He should call them the "Protectors of the Republic". And, I will insist that he does--when the Media stops being the "Enemy of the People" and returns to its role of "Protectors of the Republic".
A Socialist by any other name is still a Socialist. Like maybe: Democrat, Liberal, or...say Progressive.

This is the official breakdown of all Gun Deaths in the United States, by cause.  https://t.co/Yxz8oTTbNb
Twenty-five Percent of Gun Killings are Committed by Gangs. Sixty Percent of Gun Deaths are Suicides. The Remaining Fifteen Percent of Guns Deaths or about 2,200 are the Results of All Other Causes Including Accidents. This is Nothing Compared to the Impression Liberals Give.
Two-thirds of all Gun Deaths in the United States are Suicides.
Can the Democrats convince you they are not Socialists by 2020?
Can the Democrats lie their way out of embracing Socialism by the 2020? They are apparently scared to death by the direction Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have led the party. It's not because they oppose the positions of either, they just don't want us to know it.

@KirstenPowers Please elaborate.
@Appminarchy Just remembering the reason for the season. We celebrate President's Day because it's George Washington's Birthday.
It's not Political Correctness that should entice us to treat others kindly; Social Justice is not the reason to treat others fairly. Why then should we be kind and fair? Because we should Treat Others as We Wish to Be Treated. Is this Principle the law? Yes, it's God's Law.
As we celebrate what's now called President's Day, remember it's really George Washington's Birthday. George Washington would laugh out loud at Political Correctness, Social Justice and Hate Crimes. The Founders and Patriots Secured a Republic for us--not a Nanny State.
@HillaryClinton George Washington would laugh at you.
@TheeMaMaBear If you are saying what I think you're saying it's akin to "an eye for any eye and a tooth for a tooth". That's fine but just be consistent. If that's fair for you it's fair for us all. By the way, that's probably closer to practical Human Nature than Political Correctness.
@WalshFreedom The 25th Amendment has provisions for Removing the President only for Mental or Physical Disability.
Things were terrible for my mother when we were growing up on the farm. She had to stay in the house while Dad got to play with the Snakes, Bees, Briars and the Fires. Mom had to stay in the warm and comfort while Dad got to go out and play in the Snow and Rain with the Cows.

The Mainstream Media doesn't want to tell you what happened; they want to tell you how to think. When I was a boy on the farm, we used the Newspaper for wiping our behinds out in the Outhouse. Apparently, that's what the News is still worth today.
What's different about the Jusse Smollett story? The Mainstream Media got caught promoting a story because they liked the Narrative--regardless of the Facts. It's likely the Rule rather than the Exception. This is One More Reason to Question every story the MSM reports on.

@gaujamesgau However, we must continue to inform the people.
Do you think the Victims in the Illinois Shooting wished they had a gun to defend themselves? Do you think the outcome would have been different if those five people had been armed? Do you think disarming law abiding Citizens will make us safer? Will Democrats take our guns?
Has anybody heard the Mainstream Media Report on the fact that the Illinois Shooter was a Convicted Felon; the Gun used was not an Assault Rifle and Illinois' Extremely Strict Gun Laws could not stop this Shooting?

@funder If the 25th Amendment is enacted and the President Challenges it, the matter goes before the Senate for a vote. There it takes a two-thirds margin to be sustained. Do you think the Republican Senate is going to remove President Trump? Even if that happens, we get President Pence.
Trump holds the winning hand to build the wall through the Emergency Declaration. McConnell will quash any Legislative Attempt to stifle the President. The newly seated Conservatives on the Federal and Supreme Courts will uphold Trump's actions as Constitutional and Lawful.
Remember all those Conservatives Trump and McConnell have seated on the Federal Courts? Remember two new Conservatives who are setting on the Supreme Court? Those who Support Illegal Invaders storming our Homeland will find it quite difficult to stop Trump in these new Courts.

Did you think Trump would risk an Emergency Declaration without Mitch McConnell promising to keep the wolves away? Do you think his Legal Advisers did not assure him the Courts will rule in his favor? Why have Liberals been crying about losing the Supreme Court?
Why is Trump so confident his Emergency Declaration will stand? Mitch McConnell and Brett Kavanaugh. If they be for you, who can stand against you?
Does Mitch McConnell decide which bills the Senate Votes on? Does McConnell Support Trump's Emergency Declaration? Will McConnell risk losing this fight? Any other questions?
When you hear people talk about Congress overriding Trump's Emergency Declaration, remember that will never happen. How do I know? McConnell supports Trump and will simply not bring it up for a vote. Move on to the New Lineup on the Supreme Court.

@annagalland Our constitution Guarantees your right to peaceably assemble.
@TheMarkPantano O ye of little faith.
Democrats think they know what is best for us, regardless of what we want. Our wants are simple: we want to be Self-sufficient; we want to decide what is good and right and do it; and finally, we want the Government off our backs. In the United States we control the Government.
@WalshFreedom We are taking notes for next election.
The Democrat Party is a National Emergency. We need to eradicate every one of them from our Government. They are a danger to the nation; they give aid and comfort to the enemy and they are Intentionally undermining  our National Security.
@WalshFreedom National Emergency Declarations are part of the Federal Code--123 Separate Laws.
We will remember in 2020 about the Democrats threatening to confiscate weapons through a National Emergency Declaration.

Americans are not Citizens of the World. That Concept is incompatible with Americanism--and is a Special Kind of Treason.
Democrats, why do you think we began our country with a Declaration of Independence? We didn't just declare Independence from from England, we declared our Independence from all--the Government included. The United States is especially Independent from Globalist Organizations.
The Democrats biggest failure is to first acknowledge what it means to be Americans. Americans are Independent, Moral and Patriotic. We don't need the Government to provide for us. We know what is right and we do it. And, we love our country just the way it was Founded.

@Acosta On for Physical and Mental Disabilities. Read it.
The real reason that the Democrats are so angry about Trump declaring a National Emergency to build the wall is because the law is on his side. There are 123 separate Federal Statutes which address the subject. There are numerous precedents currently in force. The fight is on.
Democrats want to make a Federal law against lynching. Lynching is a terrible crime because it ends with the victim dying; that's the definition of Murder. Every state has laws against murder, with penalties ranging from many years in prison to Death. This is Pure Race Baiting.
Are the Democrats Making Race Relations Better or Worse with their Constant Race Baiting, Questionable News Stories and Bringing up Old Grievances?
We are experiencing Runaway Political Correctness and Social Justice. The Mainstream Media pushed Jusse Smollett's story without a shred of credible evidence--because it fit the narrative they want to promote. The Liberal Elites in the Media and Politics are Fomenting a Race War.
Will you voluntarily give up your guns to the next Democrat President?
Regardless of what the Mainstream Media says, things are working in favor of Republicans for the next election. Democrats are openly exposing themselves as the Radical Socialists they are. From Killing the Amazon deal in NYC, the Green New Deal to Pelosi's promised Gun Grab.

Why did Trump tell the Democrats that he would sign the bill to keep the Government open, and an Emergency Declaration at the same time? Now, the Democrats in the House of Representatives know that the only way to stop the Emergency Declaration is fund the wall. Just Desserts.
It appears that Senate Democrats are Chicken to Vote on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez' New Green Deal that they Publicly Supported. If they Vote for it or Against it, they Lose. Democrats Need to Be Careful What they Support.

According to Mitch McConnell, Trump is going to sign the pittance for the wall--and a National Emergency Declaration. Trump will likely put the men, supplies and equipment in place with the money allocated by Congress and finish it with transferred funds. The fight is on.
@TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats Background checks are already the Federal Law.
@J_Sykes2016 I'm sure they'll try.
New York's declining population is a great forewarning for us to observe. First, it gives us a clear idea of what Liberals really will do if they get their hands on power. It also tells us Liberals must implement their plan nationwide to deny us the chance to move away from them.

Maybe New York Will Build a Wall to Keep it's People From Leaving the State. I Predict the Exodus Will Continue Until New York Drops it's Stupid and Punitive Policies.
What's the chance that Nancy Pelosi is trying to Impeach Trump and Pence and Install herself as President?
Trump should immediately Veto the Spending Bill sent to him and announce the building of the wall. There simply not enough in the bill to justify it.
@TheDemCoalition Is the Battle of the Border fully completed?
Patriots, This is not a time to be chickenhearted. The Democrats are becoming so angry because the United States is not "falling into their hands like an overripe fruit" that there is likely nothing they would not do. But first, they would have to disarm us. Keep your guns close.

@funder That would be a decision Congress would make. The 25th Amendment applies to Disability and is the only grounds they would have to remove a President.

If you want to know who in our country plans on Subduing us, just look at who wants to disarm us. The biggest Battle ever fought on American Shores will be the Unsuccessful Attempt to disarm us. If you don't have guns, buy them now. If you don't have stores of ammo, buy it now.
What happens when millions of armed Americans unite and refuse to accept Socialism? Do you think our would-be rulers will not respond in kind? What we're talking about is a gigantic Civil War. There will be literally millions on both sides killed if Socialists try to subdue us.

Legalized Murder. In 2017 we had 880,000 Abortions in the United States. The same year we executed only 23 Criminals throughout the entire country. Those executed were given years to appeal their sentences--at taxpayers' expense. Those aborted received no hearings nor appeals.
The Democrats change the meaning of words all the time. The "Middle Class" is not poor, they are between the Poor and the Rich--hence the name. The Middle Class are mainly Professionals, Business Owners and Farmers; they are also predominantly Republican.

Democrats are gambling big on 2020. If Trump's Supporters feel spurned over the Democrats stymying the Border Wall construction, Katy-Bar the Doors. Trump's Supporters' indignation will make the 2016 election look like a walk in the park. Democrats are in a lose/lose situation.
Trump Says Shutdown Deal is Unacceptable and he'll Probably Go With an Emergency Declaration. https://t.co/c61ujZtMgQ
@PetzMom The Death Penalty is not the be all and do all for Republicans as Abortion is to Democrats. It's just a tool to have in the most extreme cases. If Democrats would Trade an  Abortion Ban for an end of the Death Penalty, Republicans would make it happen today.
If a Government Shutdown is Intolerable, Build Us a Wall.
@funder @realDonaldTrump If a Government Shutdown is Intolerable Build Us a Wall.
Democrats know a populace which eats less meat will be physically weaker and easier to control. Democrats are planning a massive power grab and want a weak and feminized male populace-- which would be easier to subdue. Don't go Vegan, Don't trust Democrats and Never be Disarmed.
Vikings Were Stronger Because they Are More Meat.   https://t.co/6S6Mch0u8a
Do Democrats now want to even tell us what we should eat? There seems to be a movement among them to say we should stop eating meat. If Democrats are permitted to gain real Power, they will tell us what to eat, how to have sex and who to worship. Sounds like Freedom to me.
@AJCGlobal All Crimes Are Hate Crimes.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Are aborted babies alive?
@PetzMom Would you agree to end all Abortion, if we would end the Death Penalty? We could probably enact that today.
Democrats have officially become the party of Racists, Anit-Semitists and Socialists. It good to know the enemy in time for the next election.
If Reducing Abortions to 23 to match the Number of Death Penalty Executions in unacceptable, how about Increasing Death Penalties to 882,000 to match the Number of Abortions? How about meeting in the middle: 441,000 of each?
Would you agree to Eliminate all Death Penalties in Exchange for Eliminating all Abortions?
@marklutchman We wore it all the time when I was in the Army.
Liberals believe that executing 23 of the most vicious criminals--after many years of appeals and time for Repentance is Equivalent to 882,000 Abortions. The Unborn get no representation in court, no appeals and have committed no crimes. This is  the essentials of Liberalism.
Whenever a person wants to argue the Death Penalty is Equivalent to Abortion, here's a few facts. In 2017 there were 23 Executions in the United States. That same year there were 882,000 Abortions. If they honestly feel the two are equivalent, how about we Limit Abortions to 23?
@PetzMom In 2017 there were 23 Death Penalty Executions and 882 Thousand Abortions.
@PetzMom The Death Penalty applies only for the people who choose to commit the most unspeakable crimes. The Unborn are the most innocent in our Society. This one Comparison by you shows your mindset.
@PetzMom Liberalism is everything is relative. Morals and Gender. Especially the war on God. The wholesale slaughter of the Unborn. The trying to make what is good bad and bad good. The unwillingness to use the usual name for people. The hate for our country.
@PetzMom What do you call Liberal?
@PetzMom Liberalism is Democrats and all their crazy ideas.
@PetzMom I agree. It seems to me that all this Liberal stuff is killing the nation. I see so many young people who don't have parents, don't have a clue about families and don't even know what sex they are. I act as a Traditional Male Role Model and I am almost attacked by hangers-on.

@PetzMom Ideology is the most important thing. We've had Liberals and RINOs since Reagan and it just keeps getting worse. We need to stop all this Globalism, Political Correctness and Social Justice and return to the Republic as Established by the Founders and Patriots.
@TheDemCoalition It's the direction of the country--not the amount of work the President does that matters. Trump has staff to implement his ideas.
@PetzMom Democrats wouldn't be so giddy about the New Green Deal if it didn't give them orgasms.

If you can't see where the Democratic Party wants to take our country after their giddiness over the New Green Deal, you're just not paying attention. Our choices are clear and frightening: go with the Democrats and watch the demise of our country--or stay the course with Trump.

@HuffPost If Trump works one hour per week, it's for the benefit of the Citizens of the United States. That's a million times more than all the Democrats do in an entire year.
@PetzMom Since Trump is the only person interested in building a wall, electing Trump is synonymous with a Border Wall. If our choices are a less than perfect President who will stop Illegal Immigration or a Socialist President who will Destroy our country, it's not a choice at all.
@Appminarchy Winning.
@Appminarchy What's your idea?
We should use California as a test state for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez' Green New Deal. We would immediately stop all air service, park all cars and of course, kill all cows. No organization worth it's salt adopts a new idea without a pilot project first. New York would be next.
How many corporations will be willing to provide products, services and jobs if their probability of profit is limited by the government? Very few. Consequences: Fewer Jobs, Fewer Products and Higher Prices--and one more thing, the government will collect a lot less in taxes.

In a world devoid of right and wrong, all that's left is power. Whomever is in power at the moment can decide and enforce their ideas of morality. This principle is the basis of Humanism, Socialism and Secularism. In this system the only rule that can exist: Do What Thou Wilt.
If there is no absolute right or wrong, boiling and eating your neighbor is as virtuous as giving him something to eat.

If you believe there is no hereafter; if you believe that individuals determine morality, what reason is there do anything other than what pops into your mind at the moment? If God's law is tyranny, if tradition is bondage, what should inhibit any action?
If you're a nauseating liberal and you don't toe the line to the nth degree, the rest will hate and destroy you. Don't believe me? Ask Howard Schultz. Some are boycotting Starbucks--the World Capital of Liberalism. Just one notch to the right is intolerable to Liberals.

Remember the 80/20 Rule? Always present. Twenty percent of people produce eighty percent of the goods, services and wealth. The twenty percent do so because they are driven to attain 'their goals'. These people won't comply with their Socialist Overlords. Result: Mass Starvation.
Why Socialism will never work peacefully: I'm not going to work if I don't do what I want and get what I want out of it. There's enough of us who will refuse to sublimate into good Socialists that we will doom the great plan. Result: Forced Labor, Rationed Food and Mass Death.
It seems to me that Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists lack hope. I believe this is the reason for their anger, hate and desire to cause human agony. A short study of Socialism will convince any rational person that unimaginable carnage awaits the plans they make.
Have we become a nation of wimps? Will the young men today be a net gain or net loss in the event of SHTF. It's hubris to think that disaster will never arrive. We should require  two years of military service for all healthy men when they reach age eighteen--no exceptions.

If businesses want to ban MAGA hats, fine. If they want to ban American Flags, Billionaires or Fur Trappers, more power to them. A private business is private property, and the proprietor should serve whomever he wants and exclude whomever he wants. I'm glad we got that settled.

What Republicans don't understand is that the Northam Controversy is just one huge mistake. Republicans are obviously mistaken; Democrats cannot be racists. Bill Clinton is not a Toxic Male Predator who preys on helpless women. Silly Republicans--Democrats don't abandon Liberals.
The Democrats will circle the wagons and fight to the death to save Northam. I hope I'm wrong, but I've never observed Character, Integrity or Fairness from the Democrats.
My Guess is the Democrats will find a way to justify Northam's Blackface Photo. What do you think?
@MoveOn @RalphNortham I bet the Democrats Ultimately give Northam a Pass.
Are Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists Principled, Like They Say, Or Just Power-Grabbers? Will Democrats Force the Resignation of Ralph Northam, Like They Did Michael Ertle For Blackface? Will Democrats Pull Out All Stops to Defend Northam?
Should Republicans Force Virginia Governor Ralph Northam to Resign After Blackface Photos Surface--Like Democrats Did to Michael Ertle, Florida Secretary of State?

Jesus taught if you make a charitable donation, do so in private. He said God knows what you have done anonymously and respects it. If however, you announce it publicly, that Publicity will be your only reward.
Is it racist to restrict voting to only Legal Citizens?
Jesus was not a Social Justice Warrior. He taught us to obey all of God's laws, not just charitable giving. If you want to quote and immulate Jesus, great. Jesus said, "I came into the world to do the will of Him who sent me"; and "Not one Jot or Tittle shall pass from the law".

254 Pounds of Fentanyl is enough to kill millions of Americans, and should be considered a Weapon of Mass Destruction. If this Seizure at our southern border doesn't qualify as a National Security Emergency, what does? Trump should begin to build a Solid Concrete Wall Tomorrow.

What does a woman gain by aborting her baby? Money; it costs a lot to raise a child. Time; it takes a lot of time and attention to care for a child. Beauty; carrying a baby can ruin a woman's figure. What does an abortion cost? Only the life of a child. Small price to pay.
@chuckwoolery I'd pay you what you're worth, but you wouldn't work for that.

If the Democrats are successful in installing one of their new Socialists as President, they will in turn force Armed Resistance. The free People of the United States are not going to sheepishly lie down and be killed. Patriots, today is the day to replenish your ammunition.
What caused the Revolutionary War? It was an attempt to disarm Americans. At that time there were hundreds of thousands of armed Patriots. Today we have many millions of Patriots who are very well-armed. It was impossible to disarm America then, and it's still impossible today.
It seems to me that the qualifications for Democratic Presidential Candidates these days are: Protect the killing of babies right up to the moment of birth; destroy our constitution and republic; and of course, continue the all-out war on God and Christians. Nothing really new.
@KamalaHarris All Crimes Are Hate Crimes.
Nancy Pelosi said she and the Democrats are doing the lord's work. They're allowing the killing of babies right up to the moment of birth and removing all references to God. I don't deny they're doing god's work, I just wonder which god she's referring to. Sounds like Baal to me.
Trump still has at least two years as President. It looks like he'll be replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg any day now--and possibly one more Supreme Court justice. With this new lineup on the Supreme Court, it's like having President Trump in office for the next twenty-five years.
@FuturesCoRyan @DavidLimbaugh Our Brand New Supreme Court Will Fix That For Us.
The Democrats are colluding with the richest people in our country to confiscate the wealth of Middle America. Their plan is to have only two classes--not three as we now have. They will reduce the middle class to the ranks of the poor and make themselves the Overlords of all.

Socialism kills the incentive for productivity because there no economic reward. So eventually Socialistic Economies run out of money and go broke. At that point, it either dies or turns to drastic actions such as forced labor, rationing food and killing off the unproductive.

Do you want to be successful? Do these first: Stay single or stay married; avoid drugs and alcohol like the plague they are and practice frugality. This is the Magic Formula for Success. Very Simple; but Very Effective.
My Humble Suggestion: Federal Workers Should Prepare for SHTF. Don't Spend All Your Backpay on Fun Stuff. Buy a Couple of Fifty Pound Bags of Beans. You Can Get them for Around Ten Dollars at Sam's and other Wholesale Clubs.
@K_JeanPierre Trump won. A few days earlier Trump Found Seven Billion Dollars Already Appropriated to the Executive Department and his Staff has Developed a Plan to Build his Wall via a National Emergency Declaration.

Another Cause of Global Poverty: Socialism. Don't Believe Me; Do Your Own Research. It Appears there's a Positive Correlation Between Poverty and the Extent to Which Socialist Policies Have Been Enacted.
Capitalism doesn't cause poverty. Broken Homes, Mental Illness, Drug and Alcohol Abuse are the Major Factors. My work experience in Education and Civic Service has proven this over the past thirty plus years.
Another failure of Socialism: There is no wealth to share if you disincentivise accumulation of riches. If we all get the same pay, everybody will produce at the ever-decreasing level of productivity. Why should anybody work harder than anyone else if they get no bigger return?
@JosephNSanberg Trouble is; there's nothing to share if you disincentivise the accumulation of wealth.
@Tazmajick Absolutely.
Socialism has proven to be so unpopular that it can only persist if all dissenters are murdered. Do your own research! Socialism is well documented to have initiated more human caused death than any other determinant.

@IggsO54 @HuffPost No Legal Precedent. That's sufficient to get the New Supreme Court to take the case, probably without an injunction in the meantime.
The Dilemma for Democrats is if Trump is Successful Using an Emergency Declaration to Build his Wall, They Will Have Absolutely No Input. If the Democrats Negotiate with Trump They Will be Able, at Least, to Have a Voice in the Discussion. Either Way, Trump Will Build his Wall.
@IggsO54 @HuffPost We have to wait and see. My money is on Trump.
@IggsO54 @HuffPost Yogi Berra said: Predicting is hard; especially about the Future. Nobody knows the outcome at this point, but the legal authority appears to favor Trump.
@IggsO54 @HuffPost The courts have either sided with the President or declined to hear cases challenging Presidential Authority in National Emergencies-- in every instance. There's no legal precedent for the courts limiting the President's Emergency Powers.
Because of the vague laguage in Federal Law, it's not likely Congress or the Courts could stop Trump from using Emergency Powers to Build Wall.  https://t.co/KbJMQHcjnH

Trump says plainly on live TV: Appropriate the money for the Wall or I'll implement the National Emergency in three weeks.
@IggsO54 @HuffPost Just postulation. Trump can't be stopped with a court order in a National Emergency. The process will be for a court review after the Emergency had ended. Trump has been getting legal advice and planning his implementation while the rest of us were arguing about the Shutdown.
Does anybody else think it's eerie how Trump calmly and magnanimously capitulated to Nancy Pelosi on live TV? Did Trump lose, like the Mainstream Media is saying--or did he win and have no reason to continue the fight? Trump has his 7 Billion and is preparing to build his wall.

Is Trump as radical as the Democrats say he is? Will Trump die knowing he publicly lost a major Confrontation? Will Trump spare any effort to nullify the notion that a woman beat him?
My analysis of Trump's actions today. Trump has worked behind the scenes and now has 7 Billion Dollars to Build the Wall. Trump will negotiate hard for Congressional Authorization to build the wall, but will be adamant that he will proceed regardless of the next Spending Bill.
@SpeakerPelosi We should follow the rule of Socialism, "Let 'em All Eat Gruel".

@TitaniaMcGrath Our Founders said that our Republic was intended for a Pious People. They absolutely believed in Free Speech; but, they also believed our People should follow the Principles laid down for us in the Bible. As hard as people try, our Constitution cannot be divorced from the Bible.
Conservatives lean more towards the "Rugged Individualism" of the Pioneers in our History. Our concerns are for the "Pursuit of Happiness" of the Individual Dampered by the Teachings of the Bible and Constitution. Liberals want a Dependent Populace without Moral Groundings.
Trump has nothing to gain and everything to lose by caving on the Battle for the Border Wall.
How Foolish; Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists think they can block the Border Wall with Twitter Tweets and acting Snarky about the State of the Union Address. Trump uses Twitter to communicate directly with his Base, but he is not Influenced by Others' Tweets.
The Left's wants you to believe they are warm and fuzzy and wouldn't harm a fly. Yet, their legacy is the death of Millions of Unborn Americans. Why would a group so heartless as to kill the most innocent among the Human Population object to doing the same to Political Opponents?
We are indeed two Nations. One believes the Bible and Constitution mean what they say. The other believes there is no absolute truth, right or morality. This is the source of the division in our Country. One is God-fearing and the other leans Atheistic. One builds--one destroys.

Democrats are Frantic; Republicans are Resolved. Since Republicans will get the blame for the Government Shutdown, there's no incentive to settle without achieving our objectives. As the months and years roll by, the Democrats will totally Capitulate to Reopen the Government.
@KamalaHarris Choices have a way of creating consequences.

There Can Be No Justice Without Order. Free Men Are Not Equal and Equal  Men Are Not Free. We Should Not Seek to Make Everyone Equal, but Rather  to Make Everyone Equally Free.
Those who cry for Social Justice and encourage lawlessness and  chaos set the system up for failure. We are either a "Nation of Laws" or  we will live at the "Whim of the Tyrant". Oliver Wendell Holmes said,  "Don't Come into My Court Expecting Justice, this is a Court of Law".

@DavidZwisohn Would you call our Founders Nazis? I only want what to Conserve the Republic they secured for us.
How are the Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists unlike King George III and his army of Redcoat Soldiers? They are sparing no efforts to rid us of Self-rule, Liberty and Economic Freedom. If the attacks persist against our Republic, the response will be in kind.
Trump was elected because we will not be pushed one more inch to the left. The next steps are armed resistance and Civil War.
To the Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists I ask: how is what you are advocating unlike Socialism in other countries? How can you put your ideas into effect when you will be opposed by armed masses? Are you willing to do what other Socialist Regimes have done?
The causes of poverty in the United States can be summed up in two words: bad choices. The options poor people choose: quitting school, unstable relationships, drugs and alcohol. If you truly want to escape poverty, emulate the Successful.
Democrats thought their Blue Wave would give them the House of Representatives and the Senate. By winning only the House, they have gained no power except to investigate and prevent the passage of bills. I say, "Have at it". We hope the Shutdown lasts until the next election.

Remember; There Are Only Two Religions: God Became Man and Man Becomes God. The First Seeks to Know and Do the Will of God. The Second Seeks the Power of God For Themselves. The Bible Tells Us: It's Not God's Will that Any Should Perish, but that All Should Come to Repentance.

@DaveLarsonFBR Our Constitution Guarantees You the Unabridged Right to Think and Say that. If we were ruled by men instead of our Constitution, your freedom of speech would be in accordance with the ruler's Whim.
@MoveOn Only a Fool goes to a Gunfight Armed only with a Knife.
Social Justice Warriors say they seek Justice; and, unless they repent they will get their wish. Remember; only God can dispense Justice. Man will dispense only Retribution, Vengeance and Retaliation. Our country was devised to Administer the Laws which were inspired by God.
Which man is just? The Bible tells us, "We Are Justified by Grace". Grace is not giving us what we deserve--which is Death and Hell. Any man who says he will dispense Justice without giving his testimony of a Christian Rebirth is a Charlatan--and a danger to the entire County.
Who gets to decide what Justice is? In the United States, we don't dispense Justice; we rule according to our laws, which are encted only after enduring all the Checks and Balances in Our Constitution. Remember the Bible tells us, "Don't Expect Justice from an Unjust Man".
@krassenstein @KamalaHarris Will Harris Get the White Male Vote?
Those who cry for Social Justice and also encourage lawlessness and chaos set the system up for failure. We are either a "Nation of Laws" or we will live at the "Whim of the Tyrant". Oliver Wendell Holmes said, "Don't Come into My Court Expecting Justice, this is a Court of Law".
There Can be No Justice Without Order.
@KirstenPowers There Can be No Justice Without Order.
@VonnyOsborn Keep up the Prepping. It's our responsibility to not only prep for ourselves and our families, but also to encourage others to do the same.
@VonnyOsborn I'm a man of hope. I don't know what the future holds, but I have prepared for the Worst. I'd admonish others to do the same.
@DaveLarsonFBR You're free to that interpretation if you choose. The good thing about our country, currently, is you can say and believe whatever you wish. Liberals are trying to change that with Political Correctness, Hate Crime Laws and  the Censorship of the Christian Religion.
If "Make America Great Again" is Offensive to You, it is Likely Because You Believe that the Secularization of Our Country has Been a Net Improvement. If You Think Countless Broken Homes, the Massacre of Millions of Babies and Rampant Hopelessness is Good, You're a Scary Person.
America is Great Because She is Good; If She Ceases to be Good, She Will Also Cease to be Great.
@EdKrassen Because Christians are commanded to be patriotic and support their country. What idea is more supportive of our country than to return to a time when America was great?
Remember the old saying, "A stitch in time saves nine"? That's my goal in warning about the move to Socialism by the Democratic Party. I'm a prepper--I look ahead and plan for ways to survive disasters. I'd much prefer to alert our citizens in time and avoid a Bloody Civil War.

Democrats Are Crying About the Shutdown and Crying for Trump to Reopen the Government. Have You Noticed that Few Conservatives Care? This Shutdown is Literally Killing the Democrats. Just Imagine if Liberals Shut 20 Percent of Our Churches Down. Government is Their Religion.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hostage-taking is a good negotiation tactic.

@EdKrassen All We Ask is Give Pence a Chance.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Democrats holding the House means nothing. They can do nothing of substance without the Senate and President Agreeing.
@funder You're probably right. I'd say Trump will keep the Government Shut Down Until the Next Election.
@TheDemocrats The House can do nothing of substance without the Senate and President Agreeing.
@MoveOn Taxed Enough Already.
Poor Nancy Pelosi. She's sitting in the Speaker's Office and yet she can't do anything. Trump won't let her fly on any of his airplanes; she can't raise taxes or spend another quadrillion dollars on social engineering. She can't even get drunk on liquor paid for by taxpayers.
I just figured this out--Trump is a Genius. As long as the government shutdown lasts, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in the House can actually achieve nothing of substance. I wouldn't be surprised if Trump plans to keep the Government shut down until the next election.
@funder Why hurry? The Democrats in the House can do nothing of substance without the Senate and President Agreeing. However, the President and Senate can continue to seat Constitutional Constructionist Judges on the Federal Bench..
@MoveOn The Next President Should be Pro America.
@MikeLevinCA @Joni_Looking Democrats in the House can do nothing of substance without the Senate and President Agreeing. The months or years while the shutdown continues, the President and Senate can concentrate on seating Constitutional Constructionist Judges on the Federal bench.
@krassenstein Let it play out in accordance with the law.
Just Remember; Nancy Pelosi Can Do Nothing of Substance Without the Senate and President Agreeing. However, the President and Senate Can Spend the Months or Years of this Government Shutdown Seating Constitutional Constructionist Judges on the Federal Bench.

There are two major groups of people in the United States. The first is Conservatives and the second is Liberals. Conservatives' ideas are simple: conserve the Republic secured for us by the Founders. Liberals want us to become a Socialist Nation. It's your choice; choose now.

@funder Trump's Supporters' Number One Option Would be for the Government to Never Reopen.
One Thing We Learn About the Democrats From Recent Actions is that We Are in a War for the Preservation of Our Republic. Democrats Make Two Things Perfectly Clear: First, They Are Willing to Destroy Our Country and Rebuild it in a Socialist Form; and, We Must Defeat Them or Die.
@funder Tell us how.
@TheDemocrats Did Democrats Pass a Bill the President Will Sign?
@TomPerez Where is it Prescribed that the President has to Sign any bill into law?
So Democrats Prefer the Government Shutdown to Relief for the Dreamers and Allowing Federal Workers to be Paid. No Wonder Trump's Approval Ratings With Latinos Has Risen So Sharply Lately. Democrats Show Their Hand--They Value Political Gain Over Truly Helping People.
Do the Federal Workers Want the Democrats to Continue to Use Them as Pawns in this Battle for the Border Wall? If They Are Suffering as Much as We Are Told, I Would Doubt it. Either Their Suffering is Exaggerated, The Democrats Are Heartless--Or Both.
@KamalaHarris If the Government Shutdown is Intolerable Build Us a Wall.
Pelosi is Playing 2020 Presidential Politics. Her Goal is to Make Trump Sell Out his Base So the Democrats Can Win.
The Only Offer Nancy Pelosi Will Take at this Moment is a Full Capitulation by Trump. Her Goal is Obviously to Demasculate Trump and Make him Renege on his Promises to the American People. Trump Will Out-maneuver her, but We Must Be Prepared for a Very Long Shutdown.
I Suggest that Trump tells Congress and the Senate to go ahead and take a long vacation, and that he's in no hurry to fund the Government. Hopefully the Shutdown will last until the next election.
@Marnijanewood @nembotavy_0101 How many people were murdered?

With all this talk and new accusations about the wrongdoings of Trump, let me repeat what a great lawyer once said: It's not the seriousness of the charges which should concern us, but rather the nature of the evidence.
@krassenstein If people bring up accusations they can't support with evidence, they deserve to be ridiculed.
@KamalaHarris If people would leave the high cost of living areas, they would fare better. Taxes and regulations in big cities increases cost of living dramatically. It also Contributes greatly to crime and the decline of morality.
Democrats you should just give in now--before you make any more federal workers miss out on their pay. Conservatives are not giving in, now or ever. This time we will get a Wall. This time we will stop Illegal Immigration; and this time we will win.
What does a woman gain by aborting her baby? Money; it's costly to raise a child. Freedom; raising a child keeps a person from thinking and doing only for herself. Beauty; carrying a baby wrecks a woman's figure. What does it cost? Just the life of a child. Small price to pay.
@krassenstein The Job of the Secretary of Defense is to Administer the President's Agenda. If he works contrary to the President, he is insubordinate and should be fired.

Conservatives Look to the Bible as the Universal Absolute Moral Guide. Conservatives Look to Our Constitution as the Absolute Political Guide in the United States. We Know What is Right and Wrong and We Never Doubt That. Liberals Have No Absolute Moral or Political Guide.
Patriots, I Wish to Give You Some Powerful Talking Points. When You Communicating With Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Socialists Ask Them How They Know They Are Right. They Most Likely Won't Answer Because it Will Force Them to Abandon Moral Relativism. Try it Please.
@krassenstein How do you know you're right?
Progressives Believe There Can Be No Absolute Right or Wrong. If That is True, They Have No Logical Argument That Their Point of View is Superior to Any Other. As Such, They Prove Themselves to Be Both Liars and Illogical. Why Should We Place Any Trust in Them?

TRUMP READYING APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE RUTH BADER GINSBURG   https://t.co/aFD6tmE8zh
Democrats Are Powerless to Thwart Any of Trump's Appointments. It Looks Like he Soon Will Get to Name Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Replacement. It Will Be More Exciting Than the Super Bowl to Watch Democrats Squirm Knowing One More Hater of Our Country is Supplanted by a True Patriot.
@DavidLimbaugh @KurtSchlichter If McConnell Repeats his Last Performance, it Matters Nil What the Democrats Do or Say.
What Democrats Will Never Understand is that Trump is Just the Figurehead of Our Movement. When Trump is No Longer President, the Citizen Deployment to Restore Our Constitutional Republic Will Live On. Trump was Just the Catalyst which Finally United Us Under One Banner.
@KamalaHarris But Nobody Said Millions of People Could Invade Our Southern Border. You Liberals Always Omit the Part About Coming Into Our Country "Legaly".
@politicoroger Since it's not possible, who will Trump Appoint to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
The Government Shut Down--The Democrats Had a Calf. Funny; Seems Nobody Really Noticed.
Did Anybody Notice the Government is Shut Down? Somebody Said it is Just a Distinction Without a Difference. I Guess it is.
Democrats, You Need a Little Civics Lesson: You Can Pass Bills All Day Long, but They Don't Become Laws Until the Senate and President Approve Them. It's Like Playing Solitaire; It Feels Like You're Winning, but You're Only Beating Yourself.
@SenSchumer Can you Enact that bill into law without approval by the Senate and President?
TRUMP IS QUIETLY PREPARING TO APPOINT RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S REPLACEMENT   https://t.co/IDoq7FmVhH
If the Democrats Won't Negotiate in Good Faith, Trump Must Move Ahead to Secure the Border Without Their Input.
@FFantasy_Champ God Gave You Free Will Like Everybody Else. There's One Unforgivable Sin; Do You Know What it is and How it Applies? It's Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit--and it's Committed When a Person Says That God's Work is Evil.

So Let's Get this Straight. The Federal Government Recruits Many Thousands of Kids Directly from High School and Trains them to Safely Use Guns, Tanks and Even Rockets Each Year. But, it is Not Possible to Train Teachers to Safely Use Guns. Who's Zooming Who?
@Trekwolf164 They're Drunk With Power--or Foolishness. I Doubt They Can Restrain Themselves.

Obviously Mexico is a Failed Nation: It Can't Provide for its Own People or Even Enforce its Own Laws. I Propose the Annexation of Mexico by the United States. Annexation Seems to be the Surest Method of Fixing the Problems On and Below Our Southern Border.
High Tech Border Security is Temporary and Would Operate at the Whim of Those in Power. A Wall is Not Only the Most Effective Method to Curtail Illegal Invaders, it is Permanent. That is the Real Reason Democrats Oppose the Wall.
If the Government Shutdown is Intolerable, Build Us a Wall.

Which Single Line-Item of Socialism Would Destroy Our Republic: Nationalization of Private Businesses. Which Line-Item Comes First in the Democratic Socialists of America's Own Manifesto: Nationalization of Private Businesses. This Group has Overtaken the Democrat Party.
I Propose that Trump Compromise with Democrats: They Get the High-tech Border Security they Say they Want and Trump Gets the Full Border-Length Impenetrable Wall he Says he Wants.
If We Reroute Foreign Aid Dollars into an Impenetrable Wall and High Tech Border Security, We Can Do Both and Still Save Money.

MOST LIKELY CAUSES OF SHTF--ARE YOU PREPARED?	https://t.co/65wc82DJkE
If Democrats Can Pick and Choose Which Laws They'll Obey, Like  Immigration Laws, Why Can't All the People in the United States Do the  Same? Can I Choose to Ignore the Laws Requiring Me to Pay Federal Taxes?  Democrats are the Party that Wants Everybody Treated Fairly, Right?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If the Country Goes Broke, How is Anybody Gonna Get Paid?
We Can Consider the Current Government Shutdown as a Practice Run for the Eventual SHTF. I Propose We Continue the Shutdown So All Americans Can Assess their Ability to Persevere Using Only their Survival Skills. We are After All, the Land of the Free and the  Home of the Brave.
We Should Never Forget the Democrats Seek Power--Not Fairness, Not Environmental Sustainability and Not Social Justice as they Claim. They Know We Must Give them Great Power to Enact their Ideas. And, it's Power they Desire. Where Will they Stop Once that Power is in their Hands?
@BreitbartNews @MsAvaArmstrong All People should be treated with compassion--period. Countries have laws and laws were made to be obeyed. We have Immigration laws-- duly passed by Congress and enacted by the President. Do we get to pick and choose which laws we obey in the United States?
Unlike all other countries, the rights we take for granted in the United States come directly to us from God. No Government gave us our rights, and no Government can take those rights away. We can only abandon our God-given rights by abandoning God.  https://t.co/EJFIAUMctA

@HawksNe54023420 @nursektaylor Students need to learn all that and more. The Problem is not just what is being taught, it's the way that it's taught: through Political Correctness and a Socialist point of view.
@KamalaHarris Why do they live hand-to-mouth? Responsible People plan ahead.
@Alex32528674 @TheDemocrats What job?
@Feisty_FL @nursektaylor @ninarzep Who'd want to work for someone like that.
@Alex32528674 @TheDemocrats Not Really. We Are Okay With Nothing Getting Done. It Beats Enacting Liberal Foolishness.
Sometimes Liberals Say Things that Make Sense. Today I Heard Van Jones Say that the People on the Right Today Are Not So Much Conservatives as they Are Anti-Liberals. I Believe he Hit on a Kernal of Truth.
@Cernovich @AngryCDNMom Our Country is a Land of Great Opportunity.
@KamalaHarris Maybe you should build us a wall so they can get back to work. I know of no contractors who get paid for work they don't do. Are you advocating we spend public money for work which was not actually done?
@KurtSchlichter That's what is unique about Our Country. God gave us our Constitutional Republic and He alone can take it away. The More our Country strays from Serving God, the closer we get to Losing our Gift of Liberty and Self Government.
@Freya_Cerridwen @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The Good thing about our Constitution is it Guarantees you the right to think, to say and to do whatever you please.
@Freya_Cerridwen @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I thought you wanted to Reopen the Government. My bad.
@Freya_Cerridwen @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Time to Tell your Congressional Delegation to Build the Wall.
@WayneDupreeShow The Government which Governs Least Governs Best.
@TheDemocrats Can the Democrats in the House of Representatives Override the Republican Senate and President?
@KamalaHarris The Problem is it Grows Government, Costs too Much and is Terribly Inefficient.

@TChris67 @quickslanding @UPYOURS555 Tell them on next election day.
@TChris67 @marklutchman I agree you should speak your mind.
@marklutchman @TChris67 Don't be like Liberals. Facebook is a Private Entity and the Freedom of Speech Clause says, "Congress Shall Make No Law Abridging the Freedom of Speech". If you don't like What Facebook Does, Don't Patronize them. Facebook is not Congress.
@WeAreOne_Q We're Okay with the Shutdown. The Government which Governs Least Governs Best.
@KurtSchlichter C. Dove Read the Declaration of Independence.
Hey Democrats! Why Don't You Threaten that You'll Keep the Government Shut Down Permanently? You'll Get a Lot of Bipartisan Support on that Suggestion.
@CNN Nearly Everybody Knows that Globalism is Dead. Long Live the Sovereign Nation.
It Seems Liberals' Concept of "Kingdom Come" is the Global Socialist Government They Want to Foist Upon All Mankind.
Shutting Down the Government Disproportionately Gripes Liberals Much More than it Does Conservatives. Many Conservatives See the Federal Government for What it is--the Problem Instead of the Solution. To Many Liberals, Government is their God and their Idea of Kingdom Come.
@tamaraholder The Second Amendment was put into place to protect the Citizenry against the Government.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Conservatives would like to see the Federal Government Shut Down Until it Learns to Live within the Tenth Admendment. The Government which Governs Least Governs Best.
@BreitbartNews This is Primarily why Kasich will never win the Republican Nomination for President.

@TitaniaMcGrath @BruceFo57208316 That's Exactly what I Say.

Does it Seem to You that Feminists Hate Both the Women they are and the Men they Want to Be?
@old_frenchy It still doesn't guarantee the Democrats a Win if we can count on Trump to Veto Stupid Bills.
How Can the Democrats in the House of Representatives Override the Republican Senate and President? It Seems to Me that the Best they Can Hope for is Increased Gridlock. That Appeals to Conservatives Much More than to Liberals. The Government Which Governs Least Governs Best.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump The People in the Red States Sent Our Senators and Congressmen to Washington to Represent Usas Well--and Along With Trump they are Doing that Moderately Well. Do You Think the Democrats in the House Can Override the Republican Senate and President?

Free Men Are Not Equal, and Equal Men Are Not Free. The Same Goes for All People--Both Men and Women. The Cost of Equality is Your Freedom. Is that a Price You Are Willing to Pay?

Liberals are the Most Generous People in the Whole World--as Long as They're Spending Other People's Money.
@KirstenPowers See it Bigger. It's Cheap and has a Space for Everything.
What would Democrats want to change in the United States so badly they would risk destroying the country? My guess is Freedom of Religion, Free Enterprise and Limits on Government. What do you think?
@RepAdamSchiff How reckless of the parents to March their kid all those miles. They should have known it would weaken them greatly.
Why would Democrats want Socialism in the United States when it is known by everyone that it would Destroy the Country? Do you think it is because Deep Down that's what they really want?
@charliekirk11 @magakid24 @BernieSanders Don't you think the Democrats know what Socialism will do to our Country? That's why they want Socialism--to Destroy the United States.
No Wonder the Liberals are Having a "Proverbial Calf", Globalism, Political Correctness and ObamaCare are Dead. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee,  Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the  time?

@MsAvaArmstrong Good Idea.
@freedom_moates The Democrats are Looking for a Few More Liberals--Try them Kasich.
@MoveOn @RepJayapal But you'll get it.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn You have no idea of what you speak. A Gentleman Farmer Doesn't Derive his Living from the Farm, he Uses it for Leisure.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn If Liberals lived by the words of our mothers when I was a child the world would be a better place: Sticks and Stones Will Break My Bones, but Words Will Never Hurt Me.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn There's a difference between Hate and Distrust.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn I'm a Legal Citizen.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn There is none as blind as he who will not see
@Noshness321 @MoveOn Did you know that the States own the US Highways? The Feds just rent them.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn I don't fully trust anything the Federal Government does--especially the Military Industrial Complex.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn I doubt Trump will lose more than he gains. I'm relatively new in Supporting Trump--I had to be sure he was Dedicated to America First, and it seems he is.
Should the United States Leave the United Nations?
@Noshness321 @MoveOn Good. Government is the Enemy of Conservatives and the God of Liberals.
I Propose We Now Call the Illegals Breeching Our Borders for What They Truly Are: "Illegal Invaders".
@TylerBlackwell4 @MandyM2S @shamapoo @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump Depends on whether those you speak of are Legal Citizens or Illegal Invaders.
@Noshness321 @MoveOn Why should the President sign a Bill he doesn't agree with? This time you're on the Losing Side. Trump's Supporters would like to see the Federal Government Shutdown Forever. The Threat of a Continued Shutdown is no Threat to Us.
@MsAvaArmstrong The Downfall of Our Society Began When School Prayer was Outlawed. I'm Old Enough to Remember. We Should Remember that if We Deny God, He Will in Turn Deny Us.
I Don't Know that the Democrats Should Adopt the Term "Illegal Aliens First", but I Do Know They Certainly Should Adopt "America Last" as Part of Their Official Slogan.
@NRA @ramacero Can House Democrats Overrule the Republican Senate and President?

If a Government Shutdown is Intolerable, Fund the Wall.
@MoveOn The Shutdown Ends When the Wall is Funded. You Have to Decide Whether You Want to Fund the Wall or Open the Government. This is in the Hands of Liberals Who Can End the Shutdown Quite Quickly.

What the Democrats want for the United States is what they have in Venezuela. Check them out and if that's what you want for yourself, vote Democratic.
If a Country can no longer provide a Safe and Productive Home for their Citizens, let them Apply to Congress for Statehood. What do you say about that, Mexico?
Do Liberals think Crazy, Evil Maniacal Trump will let them Intimidate him into Backing Down in the Battle for the Wall?
Liberals want to work for the Government and manipulate it through politics. Do they not know that politics affects Government jobs?
@katyjb88 @SusanJustSusan Did your husband know that politics affects Government jobs when he started?

@MandyM2S @shamapoo @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump The Trouble with Progressives and Liberals is they Think Government is the Solution, when in Fact it is the Problem. We want to Starve the Federal Government back to the Tenth Admendment.
When People Talk about Our Country, what do they mean? Our Country is the People, the Land and Our Constitution.
@MandyM2S @shamapoo @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump You Mean Something like God, Sovereignty for our Country...the Constitution?
@WilGuilfoyle @shamapoo @silentblue1978 @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump I don't Defend or Support Trump--I'm as appalled by him as anybody else. I Support Good Ideas regardless of Source.
If the 800,000 Affected Federal Employees are Unable to Live Without Getting Paid, they Should Contact Schumer and Pelosi and Demand the Wall be Built. Like Everybody Else, they Have to Choose a Side that Works for Them.
@silentblue1978 @shamapoo @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump If they are hungry, lket them Demand the Wall be built.
@shamapoo @silentblue1978 @MoveOn @realDonaldTrump Conservatives are prepared for SHTF because we know the Government would like to starve us.
