RT @eScarry: Oh god, Michael Cohen just said Charlottesville, the media's favorite word, was instrumental in turning him against Trump.
WRONG! The ONLY evidence that paying "hush money" to a porn star was a crime is Cohen's own testimony. Privileged info can't be used to establish the crime. https://t.co/aXt6XfMYoL

Cohen was convicted of a slew of serious felonies. Prosecutors could have gotten him to do ANYTHING. It's not vengeance for missing the joy of working in the White House. #BringBackTreyGowdy https://t.co/B9FiLSHVaK

I'm coming up on @MarkSimoneNY!
Why hasn‚Äôt anyone noticed that if people in the campaign were calling Wikileaks, it is because they did NOT have direct access to Russian Intelligence?
GOP might want to drop the argument that WORKING IN TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE is some sort of Xanadu, the absence of which caused Cohen to declare war on the president.  This was a plea bargain, idiots.
These Elliot Ness's after an alleged campaign finance violation zzzzzzzzzzzzzz sure don't mind that Cohen is abrogating attorney-client privilege with his testimony.
Wait! What?  Cohen says Trump is a racist?  Did he call NYC "Hymie town"?
Good grief! THIS is what the Southern District's office wrote for Michael Cohen? "Never in a million years did I imagine... that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance ..."

LITTLE-KNOWN LITERARY FACT: "The Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes" had to be edited for space.  Lost was the scene where court haberdasher Newt Gingrich said, ‚ÄúSir, you look splendid!"
Trump voters have fallen into 2 factions:  The Tell the Truth faction and the Kiss the Emperor‚Äôs Ass camp.  Newt and I have picked different camps.
The great thing about Newt is, you can always count on him to tell truth to power.
To those who would attack Newt, please remember that just as collusion is not a crime, kissing the emperor‚Äôs ass violates no federal law.
Newt seems to believe that you have to run for office to comment on public affairs. The constitution doesn‚Äôt just give free speech to disgraced politicians.  It also affords speech rights to another category called ‚Äúcitizens.‚Äù
Poor Newt.   At least Rudy got a job.
RIDDLE OF THE DAY: How do you break Newt Gingrich‚Äôs nose?  (ANSWER: Kick Donald Trump in the ass.)
Newt‚Äôs right -- I‚Äôm just selling books.  But at least I don‚Äôt have to kiss Trump‚Äôs ass to do so.
Newt Gingrich claims I'm in "fantasyland" for criticizing the president for breaking his central campaign promise. It has now come to my attention that Trump HAS built the full border wall &amp;  it's working BEAUTIFULLY.  That is why Trump is sailing to re-election!

Don't build a big beautiful wall with NO AMNESTY, and you are DEAD, President Trump.  That's why the Dems are frantically trying to get you to break it.
The hatred for Bush 1 for breaking his promise was for a ONE-TIME promise - not a campaign slogan said EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR 18 MONTHS.
"[P]eople stood 10 and 20 at a time to sign Perot petitions, Michael Banger, 32, wrote his name with a great flourish. Like so many of the signers, he had a look of satisfaction bordering on pride. Or was it revenge? 'Read MY lips," he said. "No more politicians.'"
"Campaign speeches are all fabrication," said Harold Klein, 68, in Miami Beach. "Bush and his read my lips. We've been lied to for so long."		https://t.co/8TyOTyjlQu
I ask Perot petition signers, 'Where does he stand?' They say, 'It doesn't matter to me that he has no position, because then he's not going to lie to me.'		https://t.co/8TyOTyjlQu
"some of Mr. Bush's political advisers had argued that everyone knew all along that the promise would have to be broken, and that therefore actually breaking it would be politically manageable. They even argued that Mr. Bush might be portrayed as politically courageous"
Bill Bennett: "I said his pledge wasn't just a campaign promise. It WAS the campaign. You can't take the definition of yourself and flip it. I've found that the American people don't have to agree with you. What they want is a straight line, being true to your word."
"I think a lot of us didn't have a sense of just how serious a pledge George Bush had broken," said Peter D. Hart, a longtime Democratic poll taker ...		https://t.co/8TyOTyjlQu
"I'm disgusted with all politicians," said Ron Purkhiser, a 50-year-old welder in Akron, Ohio. "They say one thing, then they go ahead and do the opposite. 'Read my lips: No new taxes.' Yeah, right."
"If so strong a commitment by the President of the United States cannot be trusted, many people seem to think, then no politician or his word is good."
"In interviews with 100s of voters .. the slogan,.. was uttered time and again by voters angered not so much that their taxes had increased as by their belief that Mr. Bush had lied to them, breaking not a routine promise but a sacred compact."
"many Americans have seized on one catch phrase as a symbol of their disgust, repeating it over and over like a sarcastic mantra, 'Read my lips: No new taxes.'"
The left got Bush 1 to break his promise, "Read My Lips - No New Taxes!" &amp; never shut up about it, crushing him in the next election. 		https://t.co/GgTCGF9ZLk

Pro Tip #2: Even if the S. Ct rules that Obama's (unconstitutional) executive order granting DACA amnesty was constitutional, the next president can issue his own executive order reversing it.
Pro Tip: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES is not below the S. Ct.  You don't have to wait for a co-equal branch to rule before revoking DACA, @realDonaldTrump.
Even the press is more interested in the Wall than in this "Whither Syria?" exegesis Trump is giving us.
