@jasonroyceboyd their responsibility to work, like any tax credit it just puts a few more bucks in their pocket.		If your inclination is to see all democratic led policies as a goverment sanctioned giveaway, that's too bad because it's hardly that. Like, not even close.
@jasonroyceboyd skyrocket. 		So if I were picking my battles to defeat socialism and whatever else you perceive to be the enemy I just don't see this as being the one I'd hang my hat on. 		It's a decent bill that aims to help middle class and "hardworking" Americans. It doesn't relieve them of
@jasonroyceboyd It's an acknowledgement that a growing number of the population rent and pay an extraordinary amount to do so in order to be closer to jobs etc. And despite all the progress with the economy &amp; "great jobs numbers" wages continue to be stagnant while rent and the cost of living...
@jasonroyceboyd and no one complains. For the majority of people who rent, esp young people, seniors, vets and new families, it's time we provide some sort of relief in an increasingly unaffordable housing market. 		Lastly, this isn't even the most progressive or social liberally solution.
@jasonroyceboyd First, I never used the words "a couple million" -- that's your bias to make your point. 		Second, the bill doesn't propose to "pay people's rent" as you say, it provides tax credits for those whose rent is &gt;30% of their income. 		Third, we give tax credits &amp; breaks to homeowners
@shondarhimes So excited for the warmth of other suns -- one of my favorite books and a fascinating look at America's great migration movement. GO SHONDA!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
@jasonroyceboyd Perhaps we can use the billions of extra dollars we spend on defense or the millions we spend at Trump resorts and golf courses. There's always money that's not really the issue. It's a matter of standing up for our values.
POTUS is really out here dictating corporate policy positions for the #NFL and infringing on first amendment rights. #AmericaFirst except when you're black, a pro-athlete, and standing up for racial justice. Got it. https://t.co/JSYNuO5mOZ

Correlation between #MentalHealth and carceral state cannot be understated. While numbers of mental health hospitalizations plummeted in the 90s and 2000s, the number of people with mental health illness who were incarcerated skyrocketed. #AmericanJails
Probation is a huge feeder of the carceral state. @adamjohnfoss offers an idea: probation officers should be probation "liaisons", helping individuals to stay out of prison. #AmericanJails #CNN https://t.co/ivLUGm89Jo

Recently there has been growing acceptance [...] that for black women in America, an inescapable atmosphere of societal &amp; systemic racism can create a kind of toxic physiological stress, resulting in conditions that lead directly to higher rates of infant &amp; maternal death @NYTmag
Especially alarming is that black mothers in the U.S. die at 3 to 4 times the rate of white mothers -- a ever widening racial disparity in women's health. #maternalhealth #maternaljustice #publichealth #equity #blackmamasmatter 		https://t.co/0ZoxoLDp5o

Thread below on the push out of black and brown youth, esp girls of color, in school. Learn more about this national issue &amp; see what's happening locally in Boston with Councilor @AyannaPressley &amp; @MoniqueWMorris of @NBWJInstitute.  #SchoolDiscipline #SchooltoPrison #bospoli https://t.co/KCtVlta2Rx
W know too much to turn back now. We cannot allow discriminatory practices or a scaling back of policies prevent us from making schools safe learning spaces for all students, particularly youth and girls of color.  #SchoolDiscipline #Disparities #Equity #LetKidsLearn
Last month @AyannaPressley and @NBWJInstitute released gender-informed and culturally responsive policy recommendations aimed at improving policies in Boston area schools. You can check them out here: https://t.co/kLFNF9VFkQ https://t.co/YauprMA1v2
Skin color, race and gender are inextricably linked to school discipline for youth and girls of color. You can read more about it here: https://t.co/r2vUIAKnri
We get calls all of the time that argue that black students are suspended more often because they misbehave more than white students. Or that the problems start at home and should therefore be taken care of in the home. But that is simply not true. https://t.co/jnt7ofLUVC
We know that suspension from school can reinforce bad behavior and serve as a catalyst for dropping out altogether -- further bolstering pathways to confinement. #SchooltoPrisonPipeline 	https://t.co/fbiBtzylgL
The result of such harsh disciplinary actions in Boston has resulted in 3,341 days of missed school for girls of color. Black girls missed 29x more school days than white girls in 2015-2016. https://t.co/9pXholfBdm
Seemingly gender and race “neutral” policies like dress codes can be discriminatory to students of color, particularly girls. And behavior like “acting out” and subsequently punished is often linked to childhood trauma and abuse.
Our work has shown that the numbers don't lie. In #Boston, compared to their white counterparts,		- Hispanic girls are suspended 3x as often	- Black girls are suspended 5 times more often 	- AND Native Americans girls are suspended 10x more often from school. https://t.co/5IUIOuJVFc
This is discerning because some of the most rewarding work I've engaged in has been through @AyannaPressley and her partnership with @MoniqueWMorris &amp; @NBWJInstitute to reform exclusionary discipline practices in Boston schools that have disparate impacts on girls of color.
This tool provides much needed insight on information we already know anecdotally -- that black students continue to be expelled and suspended from school more frequently than their white peers.
Yesterday, the federal govt released new data on disciplinary practices at more than 96,000 US schools. 	https://t.co/0XrANfOju3
NEW: Under Obama, the @usedgov began investigations into &gt; 1,500 complaints related to racial discrimination in #SchoolDiscipline. Now, Betsy DeVos plans to close 65 cases (including this one).  		https://t.co/z6eS4G2bDd
Meeks case is not unusual. It's how the system was built to work.		Mass surveillance (i.e., parole and probation) shouldn't be just another pathway to prison. Let's study up and get to work. We must find alternatives to incarceration. #MeekFree https://t.co/7YQPIDYSMV
