@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SenateDems Show us just one ( 1 ) scientist who was not paid with Democrat money for his/her report.
@realDonaldTrump Not only innocent babies, but also U.S. Citizens who are guaranteed all the Rights, Privileges and Protections of Both the U.S. and State Constitutions. For example:  The Right to due process of Law before Capital Punishment.
@SenatorCantwell Every person deserves the Right to make their own #healthcare choices.  However, once separation between mother and infant has occurred, the infant is automatically a U.S. Citizen with all the Rights and privileges guaranteed by the jurisdiction of its birth.
@realDonaldTrump To me, this means Democrats support, fund, and defend the capital punishment of U.S. Citizens without due process of law.  A blatant disregard for the protection of the Bill of Rights.
@COSProject @tedcruz What limits are proposed by the COS vs the limits proposed in the Bill?  	Will limits hinder moving from one branch to another in order to skirt the limits?	Will retirement pay be changed to reflect the change in potential longevity of a seat?	How will the transition be funded?
@tedcruz Even though I fully support the El Chapo Bill, I am curious.  What standard of judgement will be established to determine the origin of future forfeitures?  The $100.00 a 20 year old puts in his pocket for selling wild poppy may be eligible for a State's general fund.
@kimguilfoyle @DailyCaller When Bernie Sanders took his Oath of office he knew, at that time, he would never support protect or defend Article IV, section 4, in the Constitution of the United States.  That, defines Perjury under 18 USC 1621
@tedcruz Because communism and socialism are what Democrats crave to become, however we have a constitution that guarantees a republic to every state.  Democrats loathe that sentence in the Constitution.

I fully support using the existing border wall as a foundation for a solar farm.  Individuals should be offered perks to invest in the farm by purchasing at least 1 panel.
@KamalaHarris However, Ms. Harris, it is a reality, and it is a way of life in this country.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with teaching our children to fear a justice system which operates with an obvious double standard.  In some cases, a triple standard.

@realDonaldTrump  I find it ironic the opposition to border security is willing to protect our borders with the same style fence that couldn't stop the western allies.	Under the guise of securing freedom, 2,499 young Americans gave their lives proving a Normandy fence is fallible
@Cernovich I think it was Jesse Ventura's it said a minimum wage just doesn't make sense unless you have a maximum wage.

@RepDLamborn Here's a thought.  If an infant is separate and alive from the mother, then the infant is guaranteed all the Rights and Privileges as a Citizen by Jus Soli.  Capital punishment of a Citizen requires a trial by jury.  Does it not?
@davidharsanyi @seanmdav At the end of the day, all that matters is what paperwork public officials sign.  In a funny kind of way, I believe it's a citizen's civic duty to read every Bill before it's voted on, and report their opposition or support to their representative.
@mitchellvii @hollybodx Here's a thought.  Once the baby is separated from the mother, and it's alive, the baby has been guaranteed all the Rights and Privileges as a Citizen by Jus Soli

@charliekirk11 Because it's a Pay to Play scheme?
It takes a "max" of 20 years to influence an entire Nation.  A key ingredient in its accomplishment is division. Our government keeps people divided thru race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, and immigration status.  Think about it.
@RepAdamSchiff If Nancy and Chuck owned up to their Oath of Office and provided for the Common Defense of "Our" country instead of stalling for monetary benefit, maybe there wouldn't be a shut down.
@realDonaldTrump Stay your course C in C.  Let's hear more on the solar idea?
@realDonaldTrump Nancy and Chuck both demonstrate a pay-to-play behavior.  They would not be on any trip unless there was money going in their pocket.  Their finances should be investigated.
@henryrodgersdc It would be a really good idea if everybody ridge the funding portion on the Medicare for all bill.  Raising minimum wage so they can stick a 10% increase on payroll deductions just doesn't appeal to me

@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS Fidelity Before Integrity
