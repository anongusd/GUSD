On the eve of the special counsel's report, the Democrats' 'Russian collusion' narrative is fading for one reason: because there was no collusion. It was a political conspiracy theory. To say the case "fell apart" would be kind‚Äîbecause there never was a case from the beginning.

Schiff has been reciting this line for almost two years, conveniently omitting key info every time. Reason why is simple: when you look at all the facts, you find no real evidence supporting "Russian collusion" exists.

Listen to what lead Democrats, including Adam Schiff, are starting to tell you. They‚Äôre now declining to say they'll accept the Mueller report if the report finds no collusion.	 	Their message is shifting. The "Russian collusion" narrative is falling apart, and they know it.
Andy McCabe‚Äôs interview last night only furthered what anyone who has been truly investigating already knew: senior Intel officials were bent on retaliating against President Trump for personal reasons, and they were willing to throw out any rule or break any protocol to do it
Adam Schiff and Democrats continue Sunday after Sunday making claims that they all know are NOT true. Papadopoulos and Flynn were not colluding with Russia. Schiff knows, Intel community knows, and FBI knows.		Enough. Declassify the documents. Let Americans see the truth.

This conference agreement is hardly a serious attempt to secure our border or stop the flow of illegal immigration. It kicks the can down the road yet again, failing to address the critical priorities outlined by Border Patrol Chiefs.		Congress is not doing its job.
A blatant Democrat contradiction: they claim "walls won't work," and advocate for "staffing and technology." 		THEN: they push for limiting ICE space, making it harder to detain criminals.		They are supporting open borders and disguising it as "smart policy." Let's be honest.
With the report of Adam Schiff meeting with Fusion GPS's Glenn Simpson last summer, we now have more evidence of Schiff directly contacting people trying to interfere in our election than we ever did on candidate Trump.		Double standard. The collusion investigation is a sham.
Democrats now want a hard cap on the number of beds at ICE detention facilities. How is that a serious or defensible position? They are openly trying to hamstring law enforcement and make it easier for thousands of migrants (some with criminal records) to be released into the US.
Deeply saddened by the passing of Walter Jones‚Äîa beloved colleague and friend who had a profound impact on all through his graciousness, character, and committed Christian faith. God be with and keep his family. We will miss him.
Some are asking for my two cents on the Green New Deal. Here it is: our ‚Äúshared wealth‚Äù would be literally about two cents if we tried this.
If Adam Schiff and Democrats are truly interested in transparency, how about we declassify documents so Americans can see the full truth. Let's start with the docs on George Papadopoulos. 		Schiff knows, I know, and the FBI knows that Papadopoulos was not part of any collusion.
Nancy Pelosi didn't even wait for negotiations before declaring "no wall money." 		The "conference committee" spent more time watching the Super Bowl then they have actually meeting. 		Do we really think this conference will result in a serious compromise to secure our border?
So after nearly two years of investigations, zero evidence of collusion, and plenty of debunked conspiracy theories‚Äîincluding from Chairman Schiff himself‚ÄîCongressional Democrats now want to EXPAND the Russia probe. 		Seriously. https://t.co/5hSvlMm8gK

Third trimester abortions have historically been opposed by +80% of the country. This isn't a partisan issue.		Last night, when @POTUS stood up against late-term abortion and defended the sanctity of life, he wasn't speaking for the GOP. He was speaking on behalf of Americans.
Disappointed so many Democrats seemed to have super glue on their seats last night. Many of them could barely applaud for record low unemployment numbers--or even for an ICE agent fighting sex trafficking.
What a powerful SOTU address from @POTUS, from honoring the greatest generation to reminding us as Americans to embrace the opportunities ahead.		Democrats now have a choice: are they more interested in attacking this President, or working together for America‚Äôs people?
There is zero indication Acting AG Whitaker will decline to appear before the Judiciary Committee or fully answer their questions... yet the Democrats are readying a subpoena anyway. This is purely political and a far cry from the careful use of subpoena authority Dems promised. https://t.co/U2y2wuYVn0
Over 2+ years working with Congress POTUS has made multiple reasonable offers to build the wall and secure our country. Democrats continue to reject every single one.		It‚Äôs clear he has no choice but to use his national emergency option to take action and make America safe again.
Border Patrol Agents and Chiefs are the premier border enforcement experts. It‚Äôs their recommendations on how to stop drugs and curtail human trafficking that we should be taking and using. 		Giving them the money, the laws, and the support to do their jobs should be bipartisan.
Economy booming, unemployment at record lows, taxes cut, military rebuilt, embassy in Jerusalem, American hostages home, North Korea negotiating, a renegotiated NAFTA + new trade deals in the works...		And pundits want to criticize the President‚Äôs schedule? Give me a break.
Remember: Adam Schiff (and many on the left) repeatedly said GOP memo detailing FISA abuse was wrong. 		Transcripts from FBI/DOJ witnesses not only prove Schiff statements false, but confirm FISA abuse. FBI knew there was NO collusion for months yet continued the investigation.
.@realdonaldtrump: holding dozens of meetings to find a border security compromise		"Conference committee:" 1 meeting in 7 days, with 0 additional meetings currently scheduled		And people wonder why POTUS is being forced toward executive action. Why isn't conference working 24/7?
Democrats applaud Obama for secretly going around Congress and sending $1.8 billion to Iran, yet they threaten to sue POTUS for using executive action to protect American families. Blatant politics. 		They didn't negotiate during the shutdown and are hardly pretending to now.
Amazing. Hardly 24 hours in to conference talks and Speaker Pelosi announces "no wall money" in a bill. This is a total and open refusal to even negotiate on something fundamental to a secure border.		Stop pretending Democrats are negotiating. Democrats aren't even pretending.
Democrats insisted for a month they were ready to negotiate on border security when government reopened. It‚Äôs been nearly a week and we have yet to see even one Dem compromise counteroffer to the multiple proposals from POTUS. This is not a negotiation‚Äîone side isn‚Äôt negotiating.
At least Senator Harris is honest. I remember a former President once telling us: "if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it."		That didn't work out well. And neither would "Medicare for All." https://t.co/09V1xQzCn2
Don‚Äôt confuse indictments with collusion. Yes, if someone lies under oath, they should be held accountable. But bottom line: it‚Äôs been 20+ months, and we have seen ZERO evidence of any Russian collusion. These Mueller moves have nothing to do with POTUS.		There was no collusion.
The notion that our southern border needs ZERO additional physical barriers is counter-intuitive and not based in reality. 		POTUS wants technology and personnel too. Parts of a wall = a common sense PART of the solution. End the political grandstanding. Let's find a compromise.

.@POTUS has said that border barrier construction will commence within weeks. The next 3 weeks will determine whether Congress will do its job and define the construction process. Compromise is important, but not required, to secure our border and protect American families.
Democrats have been saying for weeks they‚Äôll negotiate on wall funding when the government is open. POTUS is now giving them yet ANOTHER opportunity to come to the table. Americans will be able to judge for themselves whether Democrats are truly serious about securing our border.
Democrats decry federal workers not getting paid in one breath and then cancel votes to leave town early in another. Ridiculous‚Äîthe shutdown is 33 days old. Where is the sense of urgency? There is zero reason anyone in Congress should go home until this is resolved. Period.

Speaker Pelosi invited President Trump to give the SOTU on 1/3, when the shutdown was 2 weeks in, and then tried to reverse her own invitation by making up a "security" excuse when both DHS and Secret Service say they're fully ready.		POTUS is exactly right. SOTU should proceed.
The politically motivated attacks on Covington Catholic students have been appalling to watch. All over a grossly mischaracterized story. 		Very clear there is a double standard for conservatives. Wear a MAGA hat, and your side of the story doesn't matter. Dangerous and wrong.
The Democrats‚Äô answer to every single offer from President Trump continues to be ‚Äúno,‚Äù without any effort to compromise or meet in the middle. They are not negotiating. They‚Äôve become the party of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù and not ‚Äúreason.‚Äù
Grateful for Dr. King‚Äôs legacy of fighting for equality and valuing the content of one‚Äôs character above all. And may we always remember perhaps one of the greatest principles he stood for: ‚Äúthe time is always right to do what is right.‚Äù
Democrats have made it extremely clear this shutdown is all about opposing Trump for them. It‚Äôs time to pursue other options. 10 USC 274/284 would allow for fence construction without national emergency. Protect our communities, build the wall, and forget unreasonable Democrats.
This is the latest and most significant step yet of POTUS showing his willingness to negotiate and compromise with Democrats on the issue of wall funding. At this point, if Democrats refuse to come to the table, it will show they are not at all serious about solving this impasse.
Today‚Äôs development only underscores the need for the special counsel to wrap this investigation up immediately. The constant secrecy and breathless speculation helps no one. It‚Äôs been 20 months‚Äîenough is enough. Wrap it up. Show us what you have.
To all the pro-life activists marching in D.C. today--THANK YOU for speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves. Our cause of protecting innocent life is always one worth fighting for.
First it was Hawaii. Then it was Puerto Rico. Then it was using military aircraft to fly overseas... all while the government is shut down.		Bravo to POTUS. The Speaker (and all members) should stay in Washington until Democrats can compromise and secure our southern border. https://t.co/XQE1lJ2qmc

Every member of Congress should have to stay in Washington, DC and work--without receiving a paycheck--until we reach an agreement on wall funding. No excuses.		If Democrats are ready to take border security seriously, there's a compromise to be had.
House Democrats just rejected an invitation from President Trump to come to the White House for a bipartisan discussion on border security solutions.		And they expect voters to believe they're serious about negotiating to find a compromise? Americans aren't buying it.

Every year the US government pays billions of dollars to people in error. Possible compromise: an amendment allowing recovered money to be spent on border barriers. It wouldn‚Äôt appropriate even ONE new dollar, allowing Democrats to keep their promises while securing our borders.
Democrats were at $0 for wall funding 3 weeks ago. Today? They're still at $0. 		The notion that negotiations have stalled is a myth because Dems have not negotiated to start with. When Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get serious about compromising, we can solve this impasse.
The NYT piece on the FBI investigating Trump was intended to absolve FBI leadership. It actually does the opposite. It reveals FBI chose to investigate POTUS to retaliate against him for firing Comey. They NEVER had any real evidence but opened an investigation anyway. Unreal.
For Congress to be out for the weekend on recess right now makes zero sense. The government is shut down. Our southern border remains vulnerable. Why shouldn‚Äôt Congress stay in DC and continue negotiating until we get the job done?
Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate in good faith or appropriate any money for border barriers. If they won‚Äôt compromise, POTUS should use asset forfeiture money or other discretionary fees to start construction. If not, he should declare a national emergency. It's time.
There's a false narrative going around that wall negotiations between Republicans and Democrats are going nowhere. 		It's false because Democrats are not negotiating. At all. Their position is: NO areas of the border need ANY wall funding. No attempt at compromise whatsoever.

One of the biggest misdirection tactics you're seeing from the left: they're pretending President Trump is ONLY asking for a wall. This is not true. The WH has requested more personnel, technology, etc.--all things we need too. Wall funding is a necessary PART of the solution.
Democrats' position in this shutdown is neither reasonable nor sustainable. Holding government funding hostage because you oppose money for parts of a border wall at $5 billion (that's less than 1/10th of 1% of the budget) is not reasonable. Americans expect compromise.

There are glaring examples of bias all over this. Right here, page 421, the report says Strzok was so biased that the IG "did not have confidence" Strzok's handling of the Weiner laptop (at the end of the Clinton investigation) was "free from bias." That's a big deal. https://t.co/SEdY7bfIWJ
The notion that the IG "found no bias" at the FBI/DOJ is wrong and a serious misreading of the findings. Read the report. IG found Peter Strzok's conduct to be so biased, he called it "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and DOJ." 		That is blistering language in IG speak.
If Director Wray truly believes there isn't a serious problem of bias at the FBI, after today's news, then he clearly hasn't read the report. 		This press conference underscores that he is not taking this as seriously as the American people. https://t.co/eMazpkOsLo

The path forward should be clear: it's time for an independent, third party investigator to look at the facts, pursue the evidence, and present what happened. AG Sessions should nominate a special counsel to find the truth for the American public.
But it‚Äôs important to remember the big picture: McCabe was a critical figure in both the Clinton email investigation and the "Russian collusion" investigation. These revelations on McCabe raise serious concerns about the decisions of FBI and DOJ leadership in both 2016 and 2017.

Republicans did not pay for the dossier. The dossier was not created until Democrats took over the Fusion GPS contract. That talking point has been debunked many times now.		Also, "salacious and unverified" are not my words. They are Director James Comey's words. https://t.co/BSWDwVJG13
I want the American people to see the Democrat memo. I believe they will. But this has to go through a process and sourcing methodology has to be fixed, just like it was with the original memo.
The FBI and DOJ not only used a "salacious and unverified" political dossier to spy on political opponents, they failed to be upfront with the FISA Court about where that dossier came from. That's unacceptable. Period.
Remember what we know: the DNC and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier. The FBI and DOJ then took that "salacious and unverified" document and used it to get a secret warrant from a secret court to spy on Americans, in the context of a political campaign.
Democrats keep complaining about their counter-memo not being released. But if it was so critical, why have 75% of House Dems not even read their own memo? 		Perhaps even they know: this memo was written in panic as a misdirection from the disturbing information we already know.
Remember: We've won many conservative victories, just within the last year. Taxes are lower. Needless regulations being slashed in record numbers. Constitutionally conservative judges are being confirmed to the courts.		We lost the spending battle. But we will see better days. https://t.co/JhRqy7IR1p

The creator of the dossier, Christopher Steele, even told DOJ official Bruce Ohr that he (Steele) was "desperate that Donald Trump not get elected president"--and yet NONE of that information was shared with the FISA judge, and the dossier was still used.
Not only that‚Äîsenior FBI and DOJ officials knew about the Fusion GPS dossier's political origins and connections to Democrats, and they EXCLUDED that information from their FISA application. They didn't tell a judge that their information was unverified political oppo research.
So, there it is. The FBI took an unverified political dossier, paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, and they used it as a central piece in their request to get a warrant for spying on American citizens and political opponents in the Trump campaign.
As the positive #TaxReform news continues to roll in, it's important to remember the key principle in play here:		Americans do far more for the economy, job creation, and wage growth than government ever will.
More incredible news! @thermofisher, a company with a huge #NC11 presence, is investing $50 million in response to the new tax cuts--including a bonus of $500 for each of the company's 68,000 eligible non-executive employees.		https://t.co/F9h5NTnTnQ
Outstanding. America is on the comeback trail! https://t.co/nNchBonYBm
Last point: If you remember anything from this news cycle, remember: your right as an American to privacy from your government spying on you is critical. It is foundational to who we are as a Republic. Never take that right for granted, no matter the political party you belong to
If any Department of Justice, Republican or Democrat, put their thumb on the scale for the sake of politics--it would undermine the very fabric of who we are as a nation. Americans deserve the truth, one way or the other.
I know we live in a hyper-partisan environment, and I know it can be easy to disregard any inquiry like this as party politics. I understand that.		But this is so far above politics, folks. Lady Justice wears a blindfold. Her scale is supposed to be balanced.
So the bottom line is this: if, in 2016, the DOJ and FBI used an unverified, Clinton/DNC paid-for dossier to spy on American citizens (and political opponents) in the Trump campaign, that is as wrong as it gets.		If that happened, Americans deserve to know about it. Period.
We've asked repeatedly for information from the FBI, both privately and publicly. We've openly told FBI and DOJ officials--if we're wrong, tell us! Tell us what was in the FISA application. Let us see the document. But we've been stonewalled for almost a year.
Now, from what we've already known for months, it sure looks like that's exactly what happened: that the FBI used that very dossier to get a warrant. @Jim_Jordan asked the FBI about it 2 months ago. I asked too. We asked for the FISA application, and the FBI wouldn't show us.
Quite simply: This infamous "Russian Dossier" was unverified political opposition research paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC. If the Department of Justice used information like that as a key part of getting a surveillance warrant, it would be a HUGE problem
Now, pause: we know about the Peter Strzok/Lisa Page texts, the "missing" texts, the McCabe concerns, etc. But this is about more. Focus on the dossier here--the political opposition research project put together by Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS, and the DNC by extension.
So, take that principle, and look at what happened in this case. The DOJ spied on Carter Page, an American citizen. Red flag. Carter Page was also part of the Trump campaign. Double red flag. It should automatically raise questions.
Remember, in general, the DOJ and FBI spying on American citizens should automatically be met with MAJOR skepticism. That's what the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect against. When those American citizens are ALSO political opponents? It should raise even more red flags.
What this issue is all about: whether the Department of Justice and FBI, under President Obama, abused their surveillance authority against American citizens and political opponents. Put another way: was the Obama DOJ weaponized to spy on the Trump campaign?
THREAD: Because through all the "memo" news and headlines, it's critical to remember why this issue is important and why it should matter to everyday Americans
So, to review: the first problem with the memo was "material omission of facts"--and now they want names redacted? 		Why not just give Americans the facts? Be fully transparent with them. Let them be the judge. https://t.co/u3MAcyM7kP
This onslaught of "crumbs" is getting way out of hand https://t.co/XqMV9t2Qed
So the FBI is worried about omissions? Ok then--let's put all the documents out there. Tell Americans the full story. 		I don't think they want that either, though--they've been stonewalling Congress for a year. It's time for full transparency. #ReleaseTheMemo https://t.co/lXZjS09UcR

I've read the counter-memo from Intel Dems. It contains several factual errors and sourcing issues--when these are fixed, I believe the memo should be made public to all Americans.		But let's be clear: nothing in this memo suggests ANY factual inaccuracies in the original memo.

Bottom line: tell us the truth. Tell us the truth about what happened with the Clinton investigation, the 2016 election, and leading up to this "collusion" investigation. All of it. Americans deserve the truth.
This is not party politics. This is not partisan bickering. This is an issue that gets at the very heart of who we are as a nation. If any officials at the FBI were engaged in this kind of behavior, we need to know.
And remember, this doesn't even address a host of other questions! The dossier. The Carter Page FISA application (that they still won't show us). The 5 months of mysteriously "missing" Page/Strzok texts. The FBI communicating with Fusion GPS/DNC-hired Christopher Steele. Come on.
Folks, this stinks to high heaven. If this is anything what it looks like--the FBI changing course on investigation, putting their thumb on the scale to undermine Donald Trump and essentially help Hillary Clinton--that is as wrong as it gets. This demands further investigation.
Think about how important that is. We have a text from Peter Strzok talking about the pressure to end the Clinton investigation, and then--within 48 hours--documents suggesting Peter Strzok changed Dir. Comey's letter from criminal charges to just "carelessness." That's major.
Now take that letter change, and go back to Peter Strzok. We have email documentation that suggests the "gross negligence" claim in Director Comey's exoneration letter was changed to "extremely careless" between May 4, 2016 and May 6, 2016... by none other than Peter Strzok.
Remember, "gross negligence" under the "reasonable person standard" is a crime. "Extreme carelessness" is not, however. That change is hugely significant. Had Dir. Comey called Hillary "grossly negligent" in his letter, he would've essentially been saying she committed a crime.
Now pause, and circle to FBI Director Comey. Remember Director Comey's exoneration letter? The letter from 2016 that, at first, called Hillary Clinton "grossly negligent" but was mysteriously changed to "extremely careless"? That change is massively important.
So we have Peter Strzok, the deputy of FBI counter-intelligence and lead Clinton investigator, who we already know blasted Trump in text messages, talking about the need to end the Clinton investigation... right after he knew Hillary would be running against Trump. Major problem.
We have a text from May 4, 2016 where Peter Strzok says: ‚ÄúNow the pressure really starts to finish MYE‚Ä¶‚Äù (or 'Mid-Year Exam,' the FBI‚Äôs code name for the Clinton investigation.) May 4, 2016 is important--because it's when Ted Cruz dropped out. That day, Trump was the nominee.
But there's more. We now have a text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, FBI agents, directly talking about the pressure to finish the Hillary Clinton investigation--a text which occurred right after Donald J. Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee
We have all these anti-Trump texts in 2016 from Peter Strzok, talking about an "insurance policy" in case Trump gets elected President. We have texts from Strzok to Lisa Page saying "We can't take the risk" Trump wins the Presidency. By itself, that's a huge problem.
Remember the key figure here: Peter Strzok, the former deputy of counter-intelligence at the FBI. Guy who ran the 2016 Clinton investigation, who interviewed key witnesses including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Hillary Clinton. Former Mueller team member. Strzok is the guy here

Bonus question: Why won't the FBI answer any of these?

4. Why did Bruce Ohr, an Obama DOJ lawyer, meet with Fusion GPS Founder Glenn Simpson right after the 2016 election?
3. Did the FBI take the Clinton paid-for dossier to the FISA Court in 2016 and use it to spy on the Trump campaign? We‚Äôve asked for the FISA application, and they won‚Äôt tell us.
2. Why did intelligence officials wait 2 months after the election (Jan 6, 2017) to brief President-elect Trump on the dossier? Why brief him on a document that James Comey later admitted was "salacious and unverified?" Did they need that briefing to legitimize the dossier?
