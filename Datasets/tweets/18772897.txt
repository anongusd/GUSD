This on the importance of beating Trump in the WSJ/NBC poll runs counter to everything candidates, operatives and voters are saying so far. And/but: Ppl who say they are "strong Dem" far more likely than Dem leaners to say beating Trump is most important. https://t.co/qytInCxIxF
Big split here btw "strong Dems" - likely ppl showing up to early 2020 stops - &amp; "lean Dems." 		Strong Dem: 51% agrees on issues, 45% beat Trump 	Lean Dem: 70% agrees, 27% beat Trump 		The electorate is not Twitter or just ppl at events a year before IA 		https://t.co/qytInCxIxF
37% of Republicans want to see a 2020 primary challenge to Trump. 		Sounds high? 		41% of Democrats wanted to see a primary challenge to Obama in 2012, and 66% wanted to see a primary challenge to Bill Clinton in 1996. Neither got one. Both won. 		https://t.co/qytInCxIxF

A Biden campaign would test whether the Democratic Party has passed by the 76-year-old. Just yesterday he had to walk-back calling Mike Pence "decent." During the same Omaha appearance, 20 of the 23 people he referenced by name were born by 1961.  		https://t.co/KZ8JKaMpiY

TJ Cox pulls ahead in #CA21, putting Democrats on the verge of winning 40 seats in the House https://t.co/PFbxtdmS4r
12% of voters this year were aged 18-29, but 37% of nonvoters were 18-29. Nonvoters also half as likely to have a college degree and far more likely to earn less than $50,0000 https://t.co/ujCZnlY2EQ
In the lowest-turnout congressional district, CA-21, fewer than one-fourth as many people voted (~109,000 and counting) as did in the highest-turnout district, Montana's at-large seat (489,000 votes). https://t.co/ujCZnlY2EQ
