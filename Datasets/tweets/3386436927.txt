.@SMorganAZ with advice for working on a campaign: "Save as much as you can. You don't want to have to make a decision about what to do to pay the rent right when a campaign ends."		@OnBackground follows up: "If you're looking for financial stability, be a finance director."
.@Ja_Bresler on losing a race: "Losing is brutal. But if this is the career you've chosen, you have to get back up and get at it again."
.@TimLimDC: "Right now, on the presidential campaigns - one of the first hires is now in digital. If you're really interested in getting involved in campaigns, go join a firm working with the campaigns. Each campaign has an agency on board doing fundraising and digital work."
.@SMorganAZ on advice for college students looking to work on campaigns: "Being nimble, especially when you start on campaigns and you see the holes that need to be filled, is really important."
.@OnBackground on interviewing to get onto a campaign: "Everyone's going to tell the campaign what they should be doing. The last thing you want to hear from someone looking to be hired by you is strategy suggestions. Don't give input until you're there."
.@Ja_Bresler: "You want to go to a place where you have a defined job. On campaigns, you should be asking about the infrastructure. If a campaign doesn't have any, you should be concerned."

Maria Otero on what it means to have American values: "It means promoting democracy and promoting human rights. We as a society are understanding more and more what it means to have every citizen be able to exercise their own god-given rights." #FutureOfDiplomacy
Victoria Nuland on institutions and hope: "We have worked to strengthen institutions. We have lots of tools we can use to serve as incentives for better governance. But ultimately, the country and the people have to fight for those changes." #FutureOfDiplomacy
RT @arenda: My wonderful student @alana_rivaille shaking hands with @HillaryClinton as she arrived at the @georgetownsfs earlier today for‚Ä¶
Maria Otero's take: "Promoting democracy and human rights are at the core of issues we'd want to tackle in a country. You have to address these issues differently depending on what part of the world you're in, but equity and women's rights come first." #FutureOfDiplomacy
Our first student question is about universalism in promoting values: "How do you balance recognition and respect fo the uniqueness of others around the world with values we see as universal like gender equality and freedom?" #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@Jacobson_RS: "This international system is what we have, but it's also what we designed because it's beneficial for us. Our backing out of it is a bad thing for our own national interests." #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@EricSchwartzRI: "Power is shifting from west to east. So, is transactional diplomacy our best tool to sustain power? Or do we achieve our power through more of a values based approach where the US has the capacity to exercise leadership?" #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@Jacobson_RS "Sanctions can't be your only policy. If all you're thinking about is 'how can we punish them' or 'how can we sanction them', you're going to miss out on important opportunities." #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@EricSchwartzRI: "Our policies have to have consistency and integrity of character. Sometimes you'll have to sacrifice a relationship to preserve the credibility of your policy that values are important." #FutureOfDiplomacy
Maria Otero on values: "When you think of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it's a statement of rights that individuals have and our policy needs to take from it. We should find a way to reach those most vulnerable in countries that we interact with." #FutureOfDiplomacy

Happening now: our second panel of The #FutureOfDiplomacy about Values in U.S. Foreign Policy with moderator @MelanneVerveer and panelists Victoria Nunland, Maria Otero, @EricSchwartzRI, and @Jacobson_RS https://t.co/l0x4XAuJnW
.@LindaT_G: "How do we get our story out to everyday Americans? My family didn't even know what i was doing until I became an ambassador. Diplomats get killed in the line of duty. They sacrifice so much - and the everyday American does not realize that." #FutureOfDiiplomacy
.@AmbJDN: "If you can't explain a policy, it's probably not a good policy." #FutureOfDiplomacy
Barbara Bodine on a student question about Yemen: "The only way that we're going to solve the crisis is through diplomacy. When we are the most effective, we are the least visible. I would say diplomacy has just not yet succeeded, but a solution will be found." #FutureOfDiplomacy
Barbara Bodine's take: "New actors emerging are cities and states - they're just starting to define for themselves what their role is going to be. Though, I do firmly believe that the nation-state and the diplomat are at the core of diplomacy." #FutureOfDiplomacy
A closing question from @MeehanBM: "What are non-governmental alliances that the State Department should be looking at? How do we engage with these actors and bring them in so the State Department is ahead of the curve?" #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@UzraZeya on migration: "The driving force of displacement is violent conflict. We need to support local solutions on the ground. I have to give credit to @HillaryClinton - on every international visit, you made time to talk to people on the ground." #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@AmbJDN answers: "I think we're pretty well equipped. We need to deal with the fact that China has become such a powerful and dynamic country, and there's no turning that back. The opportunities for collaboration with China are very large." #FutureOfDiplomacy
.@MeehanBM asks @AmbJDN: "In the past, the US has tried to find a balance between cooperation and competition with China. Do you feel that the State Department is prepared to meet the challenge of engaging with China? Do we understand China's view of the world? #FutureOfDiplomacy

.@LeahDaughtry's closing thoughts: "The thing that will separate you, that will help our country be better, is to build relationships with each other. They will save you when you don't know what to do, and they will help you be better people." #GUPageturners
.@ycaraway on the upcoming presidential election: "I want to make sure that every single person in this room is going to get involved. Pick a candidate, and work for that candidate. If your candidate isn't the nominee, then you go support the nominee" #GUPageturners
.@ycaraway and @IamMinyon on being a person of color: "If there's an organization you want to be in and they won't let you in, go start your own organization. But give yourself some time to think about who you want to be." #GUPageturners
.@LeahDaughtry on a question about the African-American vote: "What we have to ask ourselves is, what are we demanding from the system? Far too often we elect people and then have no contact with them. If your elected official doesn't know your name, change that." #GUPageturners
.@LeahDaughtry answering a question on the term "woman of color": "There's strength in numbers. Honor what your particular experience is in this country. But there are times where there is some commonality in our experience, and it helps for us to band together." #GUPageturners
Responding to a student question, @IamMinyon discusses how to make one's voice heard as a woman of color: "If you have the courage to stand up and speak your truth, no matter what you sound like, people will listen. I always start by saying 'with all due respect'." #GUPageturners
.@donnabrazile discusses the high expectations many had throughout her career: "You didn't want to fail them, they were so important. But they had faith in us. That's what we're trying to pass onto this new generation. We have faith in you." #GUPageturners
.@IamMinyon on Rev. Jackson's Michigan win: "We really didn't know the impact that these states had on a presidential campaign. We didn't really understand what was happening. It got serious -- it went from dismissing him to 'what does Jesse what'?" #GUPageturners
.@LeahDaughtry on the impact of Rev. Jackson: "Because of him, winning took on a different meaning -- we registered millions of people to vote, every major city in America had a black mayor. He is the reason why the Democratic party was forced to change its rules." #GUPageturners
.@ycaraway discusses first getting involved in politics: "I was 14. A friend asked me to work on Bobby Kennedy's campaign. I was a good organizer, I could ask people for money, I could do all the things needed on a campaign. It became my job and my passion." #GUPageturners
.@donnabrazile: "It was important that the (Dukakis) campaign reflected the diversity of our country. We turned a conference room into an office where everyone could come and have a seat at the table. We decided that it was for colored girls, we shall not be moved" #GUPageturners
.@CapehartJ starts off by asking our panelists: "Why do you proactively and insistently call yourselves 'the colored girls'?" #GUPageturners

Thank you @usmayors and @GUGlobalCities for co-sponsoring our third annual @Georgetown Mayors Forum with us! We loved hearing from @MayorBowser, @MayorEBKautz, and Mayor @nanwhaley on innovation, infrastructure, and inclusion last night! #GUPolitics https://t.co/11uBusETUD
.@nanwhaley's take: people often don't understand why someone would want to be a mayor. "It's correlated to how people feel about their community. People have no understanding of what [being a mayor] is until you're there" #MayorsAtGU
.@MayorEBKautz responds by discussing how individuals often misunderstand who owns property. "We have no authority on property except for land-use. So, what we do is put in place land-use zoning. But people think government owns all the properties." #MayorsAtGU
Professor @SheilaRFoster with the last question: "What do you feel most misunderstood about?" #MayorsAtGU
.@nanwhaley's response: "I'm a big fan of the collective impact model. How do you empower everyone in a city to drive a result? We had success with this with the opioid epidemic -- over 60 organizations came to the table to help solve this issue." #MayorsAtGU

.@MayorEBKautz on cities: "All of us have the same issues -- they're just to different degrees. You do have to talk to people, whether it's in a city my size, one @MayorBowser's size, or one @nanwhaley's size." #MayorsAtGU
.@MayorBowser "I value the input of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions. We continue to rely on our commissioners and give them tools they need. In our administration, we have tried to increase transparency and are always looking for ways for people to get involved." #MayorsAtGU
.@SheilaRFoster asks about reinvesting in low income communities.		@nanwhaley: "Opportunity zones are exciting, folks can invest in them. With any tool that is new, a mayor wants to see if there's an opportunity to increase investment." #MayorsAtGU

.@PAniskoff's take: "I think redistricting policies could make an influence. They'd place people into moderate districts and cause more people to run on moderate platforms. It's my hope that that will create more concrete change." #GUPolitics
Response from @ahrferrier: "We need to be committed to building relationships across the aisle and to being fair and reasonable. Sometimes it's not about finding the big, huge change, but rather starting small and allowing that to build trust." #GUPolitics
Question from a @McCourtSchool student: "What structural changes are required in our system to encourage concrete bipartisan efforts?" #GUPolitics
"Whether it was Obama or George W. Bush, there was trust, reverence for our Constitution, and a duty to our country, and we need that," says @capehartj
.@paniskoff: "Dilute the crazy &amp; get more people involved. The more ppl. who care &amp; are involved--in marching, in organizing their neighbors--dilutes the crazy. Ppl. who have never been involved in politics are starting to &amp; that's a silver lining in what we're seeing right now."
Exec. Director @MoElleithee's question for our Fellows: "Given the polarization of our politics and using the current shutdown as an example, how do we get the train back on the tracks?" #GUPolitics
.@RosLehtinen on her discussion group: "We're going to talk about hot topics every week and, as a group, analyze whether the U.S. made the right decisions in foreign policy." #GUPolitics
"A lot of people think they know what journalism and opinion writing are, but they don't, by and large. My discussion group will examine everything from news and literacy, to outside influences, identity politics, and more." - @capehartj
.@paniskoff: I'm here to talk about risk-taking--especially when you're young. My discussion group will be on the tools, successes, and failures of advocacy, and I'm excited to hear from students about what the future of advocacy might look like." #GUPolitics

.@MoElleithee concluded our conversation: "this book won't make you think differently about Trump, but it will make you understand things more. That is what makes Major a good, fair journalist." Thank you to @MajorCBS for joining us this evening! #GUPageturners #MrTrumpsWildRide https://t.co/tsvGS05rTs
When a student asked about Trump's relationship with the press, @MajorCBS was frank: "You can call me anything you want. That's the risk I take as a journalist. My obligation is to ask questions and get answers. It's up to the public to decide how they feel about the aftermath."
"Trump was building on Obama's brand: they were bigger than their parties, they toppled the intentions of their parties, they locked themselves into a constituency," -@MajorCBS responding to a student who asked where Trump got the ability to deeply engage his base. #GUPageturners
In a response to .@MoElleithee's question about President Trump's relationship to power, @MajorCBS referenced a conversation with Newt Gingrich in his book, #MrTrumpsWildRide: "Trump always wins because he doesn't count losses. Everything is a victory to him." #GUPageturners
In a response to a question about his experience with Trump supporters across the US, @MajorCBS recalls one man from Illinois who told him: "he understands everyone coast to coast, not coast and coast... He has made us seen in American politics." #GUPageturners #MrTrumpsWildRide https://t.co/Fg4vHK0V1J
"There is a room in the Eisenhower building dubbed the 'crying room.' Staffers don't go there to laugh. It is chaotic, but that doesn't mean his powers have been ebbed. This chaos has masked everything that has gone on." @MajorCBS  on his new book, Mr. Trump's Wild Ride
"Win where you can." -@MajorCBS's bumper sticker response to what drives President Trump everyday in the White House. #GUPageturners #MrTrumpsWildRide
When asked to summarize the first year and a half of the Trump presidency, White House correspondent @MajorCBS put it simply: "more has been done than you think." #GUPageturners

Our latest #GUPolitics Forum event featured @RepJoeKennedy! Thank you for joining us for an insightful conversation on health care and the health of our democracy! #KennedyAtGU https://t.co/w4em3xTIg0
Tonight, @MajorCBS will speak at #GUPolitics to discuss his new book, 'Mr. Trump's Wild Ride,' in a conversation moderated by Executive Director @MoElleithee. Learn more here! https://t.co/2L5BHWEVS7 #GUPageturners https://t.co/Q7YQp4aUDI
Thank you to everyone who came out to #KennedyAtGU tonight! We loved hearing about the future of the Democratic Party and American democracy from @RepJoeKennedy. Also, thank you to our cosponsor, @GUCollegeDems! We hope to see you all at our future forums.
"Persona matters. Passion matters. Emotion matters." @RepJoeKennedy says about the presidential election in 2020. He goes on to say, "The biggest challenge the Democrats have is not policy, but credibility." #KennedyAtGU
A student from Massachusetts asked about the opioid crisis and how it's being addressed. @RepJoeKennedy answered, "You can't say you're doing one thing, then cut a trillion dollars out, and think that you're maintaining the integrity of that program." #KennedyAtGU
.@RepJoeKennedy also said that Democrats should not back down when fighting for things such as civil rights, campaign finance reform, and climate change prevention. #KennedyAtGU
A student asks @RepJoeKennedy about potential passive bipartisanship by the Democrats. He responds, "Your ally today can be your adversary tomorrow, and your ally again the next day," emphasizing that it's important to find "areas of overlap" when you can. #KennedyAtGU

RT @GUCollegeDems: Students are lining up to ask @RepJoeKennedy questions! #KennedyatGU https://t.co/mkx3vyxcg6
.@MoElleithee asks if there are areas where a Democratic House can work with a Republican Senate and the Trump Administration. Some of the issues mentioned by @RepJoeKennedy are healthcare, mental and behavioral health, infrastructure, and workers' pensions. #KennedyAtGU
.@RepJoeKennedy on the topic of healthcare: "It turns out healthcare is really complicated, and no one thinks about it until you really need it. And when you need it, whether it's for your child, your parent, or yourself, it becomes all you think about." #KennedyAtGU
"We are a country that does not believe you have to choose and that can still be a bright light" where all people can have a seat at the table and have their voice heard, says @RepJoeKennedy. #KennedyAtGU
.@MoElleithee asked if American democracy is healthy, and @RepJoeKennedy responds saying that it's working - but not healthy. Though, "every single one of us has a chance and obligation to fix it and make our democracy healthier." #KennedyAtGU
We‚Äôre so excited to kick off our conversation with @RepJoeKennedy tonight on the health of our democracy! #KennedyAtGU https://t.co/DaWSy8pHn1

Closing remarks from @seanspicer: "If you want to understand how to have the dialogue, you first have to understand the problem: there has to be a level of respect in our civil discourse, and a desire to engage with people we disagree with" #SpicerAtGU

Another student asks @seanspicer about his thoughts on Melissa McCarthy. "She's a very talented actor. I've never actually engaged with her, but I shook her hand a few years ago. She definitely had some good material to work with." #SpicerAtGU
Our first student question is regarding a website rating journalists' credibility and @seanspicer's opinion on it . @seanspicer says he is fine with it, and discusses the importance of free speech. #SpicerAtGU
.@seanspicer on moving forward: "If we can't listen to someone and be willing to stand up for them, we've lost what makes this country great" #SpicerAtGU
"The role of the staff in a private setting is to recommend what to do [to the boss]. If you grow to a point where you feel uncomfortable, it is on you to resign" 		-@seanspicer on being a spokesperson when you may not agree with what you are being told to say #SpicerAtGU
.@MoElleithee: "Is the press the enemy of the people?"		@seanspicer: "No. Every industry has good people and bad people - I think the better strategy is to call out the bad and praise the good. We need a fair and free press." #SpicerAtGU
.@MoElleithee: "How has social media affected the work of a press secretary?" 		@seanspicer: "There is less of a filter when putting information out. But I don't think most major policies can be explained in 280 characters" #SpicerAtGU
Speaking about his experience working as a press secretary: "If it's a private entity, you serve them unequivocly. When you work for a public official, you are ultimately serving the American people" -- @seanspicer #SpicerAtGU
.@MoElleithee asking @seanspicer about what drew him to the communications side of politics #SpicerAtGU 		@seanspicer: "I loved that daily battle." He discusses the excitement of different things happening with the press every day, vs on the legislative side where it is slower.
"I took a government class, and found a sense of passion and inspiration" -- @seanspicer #SpicerAtGU

Thanks to former White House Chief of Staff @Reince for coming to @Georgetown tonight! It was great having you here. 		#PriebusAtGU
How do you think the Democrats are going to respond in terms of a candidate, more traditional or less, in 2020?		.@Reince: "My guess is we don't know who this candidate will be in 2020. If I had to guess it's no one we know about right now"		#PriebusAtGU
RT @SecretsBedard: @Reince in @GUPolitics event tonite said Wisconsin conservatives "should worry." Compares fall elections to 2010 wave. '‚Ä¶
Student Advisory Board Member @CRKovach asked if there is a blue wave in Wisconsin and should Republicans worry?		@Reince: "Yeah I do, I think they should worry. I don't think it will be an easy year."		#PriebusAtGU
RT @GUStudentCntrs: Thanks for stopping by @Reince ! @GUPolitics #iop https://t.co/L0K8sD3tgE
Has this President changed the way that the White House connects with the people?		.@Reince: "I think in terms of the way he uses Twitter and social media"		#PriebusAtGU
.@Reince: "I think that the amount of pure product that this President has pushed out of the White House is way more than what President Clinton was able to do"		#PriebusAtGU
"What I try to explain to people is [...] the decisions are pretty darn good decisions" 		@Reince on the policies of President Trump		#PriebusAtGU
.@Reince: "I think President Trump has returned to the idea that workers are worth fighting for"		#PriebusAtGU
.@Reince: "I think President Trump is extremely unique in his own brand. I have never seen a candidate take as many hits as he has."		#PriebusAtGU
.@Reince: "It is a fact of life that you cannot grow the party by pushing people out the door"		#PriebusAtGU
.@KMWalsh_GOP turns the conversation to how much McCain-Feingold and then Citizens United affected the RNC's work. 		@Reince: "It's so important to understand campaign finance in party politics"		#PriebusAtGU
.@Reince: "I started in Republican party politics when I was in high school. Big nerd alert."		#PriebusAtGU
.@MoElleithee: "I wrote a lot of press releases attacking our guest [@reince] when I was at the DNC. But I always had a healthy respect for him."		#PriebusAtGU

"Whatever difficulty you might have or insecurity you might feel, you are probably wrong...it really is about confidence." - Lea Berman in response to a student asking about being a woman in the workplace. #GUPageTurners
"I wish I was more confident earlier during my time there...especially being a woman you kind of think I should suck it up, be nice..." - Lea Berman  #GUPageTurners
"Was there a moment for either of you that made you stop and think about how this is all bigger than you?" - @KateBennett_DC #GUPageTurners
"It pays to make an effort with people, to not meet anger with anger." - Lea Berman #GUPageTurners
Lea credits White House resident staff for teaching her about traditions, expectations of discretion, and how some of them have worked there for generations. #GUPageTurners
Jeremy shares anecdote: after government shut down, the staff had come back. President Obama welcomes everyone back and makes a joke about how Jeremy running everything was iffy. Jeremy responds "now that everyone else is back, maybe I can work on that website" #GUPageTurners
.@KateBennett_DC asks Jeremy about his relationship with President Obama. 		"There was something everyday with the President...it was a very joking relationship." - Jeremy #GUPageTurners
Lea talks about how much she learned about how to talk and be outgoing. She was not normally so social. #GUPageTurners
"We tended to be more accommodating and more patient" because they know that they are representing the First Lady and President. #GUPageTurners
Lea rarely invoked the First Lady's name calling it "the nuclear option" but Jeremy used it often. #GUPageTurners
.@KateBennett_DC do most of the residence staff stay on across administrations? Lea and Jeremy "Yes." #GUPageTurners
Lea Berman points out that Republican and Democratic administrations attracted different types of entertainers requiring unique preparation for each. #GUPageTurners
.@KateBennett_DC asks about the increased stress with high level celebrities. "We had to keep reminding their management team there is no budget for this." - Jeremy Bernard #GUPageTurners
Lea Berman talks about making sure that everyone had a great experience at the White House because it is such a once in a lifetime and emotional moment for many. #GUPageTurners

"In most cases in your life, the opposite of woe is to giddyup and work a little harder." - @GovofCO #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on improving rural public education in Colorado: ‚Äú20-35% of our kids slip through the cracks. For kids who are at risk, I think we could provide longer school days and longer school years. And urban areas have to subsidize the rural areas." #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on lobbying and the role of money in politics: "Lobbying is every bit as bad as you think, but it‚Äôs also a necessary evil. Lobbyists are often the only ones who know all the deep facts on complicated issues." #HickenlooperatGU
‚ÄúWe as Americans have to start thinking outside of ‚ÄòRepublican‚Äô and ‚ÄòDemocrat,‚Äô start thinking about issues we care about, and organize around those.‚Äù - @GovofCO #HickenlooperatGU
‚ÄúBackground checks are so basic, and I think the tide is turning [that way].‚Äù - @GovofCO on gun control #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on CO's creative economy: ‚ÄúWe have this thing called Take Note Colorado. It's the vision that in the next 7 years any kid that wants to learn music will have access to an instrument and a teacher. That‚Äôs the kind of thing that continues to make creative energy.‚Äù
"Hickenlooper-Kasich is way too long for a bumper sticker."- @GovofCO on recent 2020 rumors #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on the unity ticket: "I believe in the symbolism of it‚Ä¶ but in terms of real political possibilities it won‚Äôt happen. If someone‚Äôs serious about running for president, most money comes from those supporting not just a candidate but a view or a party." #HickenlooperatGU
‚ÄúAmerican democracy is the best form of government tested yet, but also one of the most fragile forms, and it relies on people caring about the issues.‚Äù - @GovofCO #HickenlooperatGU
What can DC learn from Colorado? "Washington is a victim of the histrionics of modern campaign attack ads‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre depressing the product category of democracy. Those attack ads make people tune out." - @GovofCO #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on the civility of Denver politics: "Collaborative tax has helped us build cultural institutions that are part of the reason a lot of young people want to live in Denver." #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on Colorado‚Äôs productive state government: ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a level of collaboration that goes back in Colorado‚Äôs history‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs part of our western US heritage.‚Äù #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on campaigning for Mayor: ‚ÄúI refused to run negative ads, and I ran on the notion that a small business person can bring common sense to government.‚Äù #HickenlooperatGU
@GovofCO on his path to politics: "I was the last person anyone would have anticipated running for office.‚Äù #HickenlooperatGU
So excited to be joined tonight by @GovofCO and @JFKucinich for a discussion of the "possibility of politics." Join us in the Healey Family Student Center now, or follow along on twitter! #HickenlooperatGU

Come discuss the politics of executive power with #GUPolitics Fellow @NadeamElshami (and Georgetown Cupcakes) today at 4PM! https://t.co/r2Sqt1KXlb https://t.co/qcURZyB4xm
"Your country needs you right now." https://t.co/vW6ASmVP4q
"I get why you may be discouraged by going into public service," @SallyQYates admits. "But if we lose the pipeline of bright, talented young students going into government service, that's a problem that will go beyond the current administration." #SallyAtGU
Another question: "Is the citizenship question unconstitutional?"		@SallyQYates: "It's clearly not a good idea ‚Äî the Census Bureau said this is not good policy."		#SallyAtGU
Question from the audience: "Would it be an impeachable offense for the President to fire Mueller?"		@SallyQYates: "I think it would be a huge problem for our country...and I think that has been messaged to him." 		#SallyAtGU
"Criminal justice reform is one of the few issues out there that has true bipartisan support ‚Äî from the Koch brothers on the right to the ACLU on the left." -@SallyQYates #SallyAtGU
.@mattapuzzo being frank: "Are you running for something?"		@SallyQYates: "I don't really see that. Running for office is something I've never really felt drawn too. But my husband wants me to."		#SallyAtGU
"Since Watergate, there has been a time-honored norm that the White House stays away from criminal investigations. But we see daily interference by this White House. Damage is done when public faith is lost in these institutions."		#SallyAtGU
"You don't congratulate a man for not robbing a bank," @SallyQYates chuckles, explaining that she doesn't deserve congratulations for her institutional resistance. #SallyAtGU
"You knew you were going to be fired, right?" -@mattapuzzo 		"I knew there was a decent chance, yeah." -@SallyQYates 		#SallyAtGU
.@mattapuzzo asks: "Why not punt or just resign?"		@SallyQYates responds: "If there's a reasonable legal argument, the department will make that argument. But advancing an argument that is not grounded in truth is not reasonable. And its not something the DoJ should ever do."
"That's why I made the decision not to defend it." #SallyAtGU https://t.co/E8xu12VgdT
"To defend this, we would have to advance an argument that the travel ban had nothing to do with religion. And I didn't believe that to be the truth." -@SallyQYates #SallyAtGU
"We were trying to figure out who was in and who was out, as well as the legal challenges to it ‚Äî which started being filed immediately." -@SallyQYates
"I was literally read it on my iPad from the news," @SallyQYates reveals about the first full weekend of the Trump presidency. "We had not been included in any sort of process."
.@mattapuzzo opens by asking @SallyQYates about the travel ban controversy early in the Trump presidency: "it's supposed to be a quiet time."

RT @StormyRuru: ‚ÄúThat arc only bends towards justice when you pull it that way.‚Äù - @EricHolder #HolderAtGU @GUPolitics
"How are you going to decide whether or not to run for office in the future?" @MoElleithee tactfully asks. @EricHolder responds: "It's an extremely personal decision, whether or not my family is up to the rigors of a national campaign. And what we think I'd bring to the country."
"You're going to see movement in ways we haven't seen before. Young people are out there ‚Äî and when they see hundreds of thousands of people as a consequence, we'll start to see movement. That's the power we have as individual citizens." #HolderAtGU https://t.co/KVDzaw9tnV
Our SAB member @StormyRuru asks: what can us students (not lawyers!) do about this issue starting today! @EricHolder responds: let your representatives know! #HolderAtGU
RT @christianmesaa: I could listen to @EricHolder talk about the Gill v Whitford case for the next few hours #HolderAtGU @GUPolitics
When asked about the importance Citizens United on the outcome of election: "There's not much you can do about a Supreme Court decision. We have to live with that system to an extent." -@EricHolder
"As the Attorney-General, you gotta run the Justice Department. You gotta look at the President and have the ability to say 'no'." -@EricHolder on the AG-POTUS relationship #HolderAtGU
"This is about the American people have their voices heard and their votes count ‚Äî at the state level and the federal level." -@EricHolder, laying out the underlying principles of the @DemRedistrict
Is taking this partisan approach on this just adding to the polarization of redistricting? @EricHolder says: "We have limited amounts of time. You wouldn't have the necessary power, focus ... this is a partisan attempt at good government." #HolderAtGU
"I'm looking for fairly drawn districts that will probably result in more competitive races" #HolderAtGU
.@MoElleithee pushes back, arguing that Democrats gerrymandered in Illinois and Maryland. @EricHolder responds: "Let's just make this a fair fight. Give us a fair fight, we'll have a Democratic congress and state legislatures." #HolderAtGU
"We are trying to focus on state legislative seats, governorships ‚Äî the thought is to elect people who will be at the table in 2021 for the redistricting done after the 2020 census," @EricHolder asserts, on the importance of the upcoming elections. "We have to elect Democrats."
"This has an impact on our day to day lives," @EricHolder argues. "We need to make people understand that it's through gerrymandering that makes representatives more susceptible to special interest groups."

On reforming the redistricting process: "The best of all possible worlds: support citizen-driven creation of non-partisan commissions. Right now, politicians are picking their voters rather than citizens choosing who their representatives are." -@EricHolder
"We're in court in a lot of places saying the system we have in place is really inconsistent with our founding documents. We're cheapening their right to vote." -@EricHolder on his litigation strategy to roll back gerrymandering
RT @StormyRuru: One day I‚Äôll get used to how amazing these moments are. Today is not that day. @GUPolitics #HolderAtGU https://t.co/wxnT1eO‚Ä¶
How does redistricting affect government? "What you're worried about is getting primaried, so there's no incentive for people to talk to others across the aisle. It's seen as weakness." #HolderAtGU
"When the President and I talked about our post-presidential lives, a lot of the issue we faced...came down to inappropriate districting and redistricting. And for me, it just made sense ‚Äî it was consistent with the work I did as AG" -@EricHolder #HolderAtGU

Thank you to our moderator, panelists, and attendees for a fantastic discussion on infrastructure policy! #GUPolitics
Panelist @kwdedrick offers her thoughts: "transportation has always been very regional and hasn't been very partisan, traditionally speaking, since it's based on the specific needs of an area, but afraid it is becoming more that way."
Moderator @MarkCarlRom brings up rural and urban areas. "Are these conversations becoming more intense as the political divide grows?"
Panelists @MartinkoSteve, @kwdedrick, and @MSargent83 highlight policy discourse regarding privacy issues, alternative fuel, and vehicle tax credits. #GUPolitics

@kayleighmcenany on the RNC and her role in the Republican party: "We stand with the president unequivocally. My job is Republican unity, and Republican unity means standing behind the president." #GUPageturners
On the two party system: "I think the two party system is here to stay, but you will see the parties dramatically change and cater to the movements of the people.‚Äù - @kayleighmcenany #GUPageturners

*@kayleighmcenany on civil discourse: ‚ÄúEngagement with an alternative ideology made me stronger and made me better. It forces you to articulate your point of view, and that‚Äôs what an effective advocate should be able to do.‚Äù #GUPageturners
Did you believe Donald Trump would win the presidential election? ‚ÄúI had moments of doubt, I won‚Äôt deny it. But I believed in the hidden Trump voter.‚Äù - @kayleighmcenany #GUPageturners
@kayleighmcenany on how we can bring new perspectives to college campuses:  ‚ÄúAll issues have a human face to them‚Ä¶ talk to people, call local residents, pick up the phone, make a documentary. Show another side to an issue that‚Äôs otherwise academic or theoretical.‚Äù #GUPageturners

What is a lobbyist? "A communicator and an educator." - @MsCEAntelo
‚ÄúEvery client I‚Äôve gotten has been based on a relationship or [occasionally] branding.‚Äù - @MsCEAntelo on business development #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo on why she enjoys lobbying: "I love the strategy that goes into it... being able to pull in third party validators, and the media, and the messaging, and the Hill... There's never a day that's the same.‚Äù #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo on the biggest misconceptions about lobbying: ‚ÄúThe biggest misconception is that it‚Äôs all a money game, and that you can buy influence.‚Äù #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo: ‚ÄúFor every issue in Congress, there‚Äôs not just two sides. There can be six different perspectives on every possible situation.‚Äù #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo on lobbying: "For a lobbyist to do their job well they have to be constantly taking in information." #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo on the partnerships and communications between SeaWorld, AZA, and the HSUS: "For the very first time there was a conversation happening with an animal rights group to make incremental change.‚Äù #Lobbying101
@MsCEAntelo on how to succeed in lobbying: "I think you have to be able to have the difficult conversations." #Lobbying101

(On mayors sharing creative solutions): ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no patent on amazing ideas‚Äù @LydiaMihalik
Is there room for partisan political games at the local level? Definitely not, according to our millennial mayors panel with the Georgetown Global Cities Initiative @GeorgetownSCS @usmayors
@LydiaMihalik on being mayor when the federal gov drops the ball: ‚Äúour job is to just get it done, to communicate to the state, the louder our voices the better our representation of our residents‚Äù
‚ÄúMy family‚Äôs is a typical immigranf story, so I got a firsthand view of what politics in a big city is like‚Äù -@FrancisSuarez

That's a wrap! Thanks for following along #EYGUTaxReform, co-sponsored by @EY_Tax!
Final question from @JoePerticone: % odds this becomes law?	@tony4ny: 100%	@CathyKochEY: 95%	@GroverNorquist: Somewhere in between!	#EYGUTaxReform
Student question: What's the @GOP comms strategy on tax reform? @tony4ny says the keys are the middle class, business investment opportunities, and job creation.
Student question: Why repeal the medical expense deduction when it helps vulnerable people? @CathyKochEY says that provision isn't in the Senate bill because people spoke up. #EYGUTaxReform
How do you make tax reform pay for itself? @tony4ny says it needs to be combined with deregulation and trade renegotiation. #EYGUTaxReform
On to student Q+A: talking about how the tax bill impacts students - an important topic here at GU Politics! #EYGUTaxReform

"To kill 'better' because you want 'much better' leaves you with the worst possible thing." -@GroverNorquist on Republican opposition to the bill in the Senate. #EYGUTaxReform
"It's going to pass." A hot take from @GroverNorquist on the tax bill's prospects in the Senate! #EYGUTaxReform
.@CathyKochEY responds to @tony4ny: the @taxfoundation says it will increase the deficit by about $1 trillion over 10 years. Which is it? #EYGUTaxReform
The last few quarters have seen about 3 percent GDP growth - @tony4ny says that tax reform will help sustain that. #EYGUTaxReform
Prediction for biggest winners from tax reform? Unemployed people, who @GroverNorquist believes will become employed. #EYGUTaxReform
Theme emerging early in #EYGUTaxReform from @CathyKochEY and @tony4ny: Tax reform is an opportunity for bipartisanship. Both sides think we need it.
"Not all politics is polarizing, and not all politics is partisan." -@tony4ny on the lessons he learned as a GU Politics Fellow last spring! #EYGUTaxReform

Thank you @davidlitt and @jenniefayDC for a wonderful event!	‚ÄúThere are a few moments when you realize that America is a better place tonight than it was this morning, and you got to be a part of that. Those are my favorite memories." - David Litt #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: "Most of my job in the White House was to write good stuff that didn‚Äôt cause a major incident. And that‚Äôs harder than it sounds.‚Äù #GUPageturners
@davidlitt on being the youngest person in the room: ‚ÄúThe one thing you can bring to the table when you‚Äôre young is working really, really hard. Then people will value your perspective. You also need to have some humility.‚Äù #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: "I think for a President every speech has to be about America, and every speech has to be about Americans, not just the policy." #GUPageturners
@davidlitt on how to write for different people: "What are the ideas people really care about? What are the stories that appeal to them? What are the things they can speak about that no one else can?‚Äù #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: "I'm a long term optimist." #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: ‚ÄúEvery speechwriter I know reads a lot - we‚Äôre the kind of people who will read the back of a cereal box just because it‚Äôs written down. So read all sorts of stuff. Also, find reasons to write argumentatively, not just analytically." #GUPageturners
@jenniefayDC: "What‚Äôs it like to write jokes for the President of the United States?"	@davidlitt: "Writing jokes for a President is unique because you‚Äôre trying to be both careful and take risks. It‚Äôs hard, but rewarding.‚Äù #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: ‚ÄúOne great piece of life advice: If you have a chance to go to your own going-away party without actually going away, I highly recommend it.‚Äù #GUPageturners
@davidlitt on careers in politics: "For anyone thinking of going into politics, I would definitely recommend doing field on a campaign... you get to see the outcomes of politics rather than just the process." #GUPageturners
@davidlitt: "The moment I knew my life had suddenly changed, Obama said to his organizers:  "You typify that most American of qualities; that when faced with impossible odds the people who love this country can change it." And I felt like he was talking to me.‚Äù #GUPageturners

A BIG thank you to our panelists @jrpsaki &amp; @mikedubke, moderator @SteveScully, and to everyone who joined us for our 1st event of the year!
"The time that comes to mind is when I had something to say and spoke up--even before I had the job!" answers @mikedubke
"Sometimes things work out and sometimes they fail. Those moments stick out to me. They show me that I cared." - @jrpsaki
"To all of these students--I want you to know that if you get invested in what you're working on, it means that you care," - @jrpsaki
"I just want to sit and think about it!" exclaims @mikedubke to audience laughter. #GUPolitics
"Was there one day or moment that you take away from your WH experience?" asks @SteveScully to panelists @jrpsaki and @mikedubke
"There is a place for nuance and consideration regarding several issues [within this 140 character world]," says @mikedubke
"It's not just how you're communicating," @jrpsaki points out. "You're in charge of coalition-building. You need an echo chamber of people."
RT @christianmesaa: Another stellar event with @GUPolitics! Thanks to @jrpsaki and @mikedubke for coming out and talking about Communicatin‚Ä¶
.@mikedubke continues, "...his speaking style and cadence was different. Everything about him was different."
"The way that @realDonaldTrump spoke during the 2016 pres campaign allowed him to differentiate himself from Clinton," says @mikedubke
.@jrpsaki "Communications can become too tactical, too targeted, and you finally lose the thread of what you're talking about"

"The president writes a number of his own tweets, while some are suggested to him," says @mikedubke
"One of the key goals in this role is to help policy teams know that you are positioning their policies in the best light." - @jrpsaki
.@jrpsaki "The WH briefing is part of who we are as a country. It shows we value the freedom of the press."
.@jrpsaki: "The reason the [White House] briefing has to stay around is that it's part of who we are as a country." #GUPolitics
