Bottom line, this shutdown should never have happened, and politicians should never intentionally harm the American people with a shutdown as leverage for political gain.

I will keep fighting for the Medicare and Social Security benefits our seniors have earned!
These bills will give seniors  more time to navigate the complicated Medicare enrollment process, help cut down on Medicare fraud, and expand programs that help seniors stay in their homes as long as  possible while still receiving the highest quality care.
After a lifetime of work and paying into Medicare, our seniors deserve the highest standard of health care coverage to live a healthy and full life in retirement. Last week, I supported three bills that passed the House and will help us achieve that goal!
Today we remember the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Our nation  was tested by hatred and violence. We responded with heroism, hope, and  national unity. I want to thank all those in our communities who held  remembrances today, embracing that unity in our region. https://t.co/HOBq6rLw7C

I am proud to partner with Republican @RepGusBilirakis on a new bill, the Protection for Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Act, which will force the VA to take action and get veterans the care they have earned and deserve. We must not repeat the inaction we saw with Agent Orange!
That says a lot about his selfless sacrifice to serve our nation. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. He will be missed for generations to come.
I will always remember the conversations we had sitting next to each other flying coach, and the sage advice he gave me as a new member of Congress. He sacrificed a tremendous amount as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and refused to leave until many more POW’s were released.
I am saddened by the loss of a national hero and patriot, Senator John McCain. He was a man of character, a maverick, and often put country above party.
Did you know that nearly 15% of all new jobs in the U.S. are created by #startups? During #StartupWeek, let’s recognize how much they mean to our community!
These provisions will help us track and identify all the negative health impacts associated with exposure so we can ensure our servicemembers and veterans get they care they need!

I am deeply concerned about carelessly getting involved in another war or repeatedly turning to military action as the only means of responding. The President's authority for initiating military action is limited and long term action must be approved by Congress.
Last night's targeted strike on Syria's chemical warfare infrastructure by the U.S., Britain, and France was meant to hinder their capacity to do it again.
The use of chemical warfare is horrific, illegal, and should be held to account by the international community. I condemn the Assad regime's inhumane chemical attack.

After the 2013 Mountain Fire, I worked with first responders to introduce this bipartisan bill to give local governments the resources they need to recover, rebuild, prevent future fires, and keep communities safe.
Today the House passed my bipartisan Wildfire Prevention Act, a huge win for our district!
Californians – you can still enroll in health insurance through Covered California! Open Enrollment to pick a health care plan for you &amp; your family is happening right now. Call 800-300-1506 or visit https://t.co/QoEyBkiwhy before Jan 31, 2018 to learn about your options for 2018
Congress must put partisanship aside and pass a bipartisan bill that truly protects our seniors and prioritizes middle-class families to stimulate our economy.
Today I voted against the tax plan that forces $100B in cuts to Medicare over the next 4 years and increase taxes on tens of millions of middle-class families. It gives 83% of the tax breaks to the wealthiest 1% and explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion.
We must get answers for our vets exposed to burn pits. That's why 22 of my colleagues and I signed a bipartisan letter urging leaders of the House Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing to examine the use of burn pits and the health risks associated with exposure. https://t.co/CWZp0enuxH
I joined 118 of my colleagues in asking the @FCC to delay the vote on #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/LPsb3yqa9z
We should modernize our tax code to help hardworking families &amp; small businesses spark the economy. Yet the current plan only further burdens middle-class families to benefit the wealthiest. Let's start over, pass bipartisan tax reform, &amp; give real tax cuts to all Americans. https://t.co/761j92dcM6

Confirmed by @USCBO: the current tax proposal will trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year alone and over $100 billion in the next 4 years, all to give massive tax cuts to the wealthy. https://t.co/zWtS0SqNhk
Millions of middle-class families will see a tax increase under the current tax proposal. Retweet if you oppose raising taxes on millions of hardworking Americans.
It does all this while giving tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and big corporations that ship jobs overseas. This is unacceptable; we must protect Medicare, middle class families, seniors, and veterans. 3/3
Unfortunately, the current plan double taxes families in my district, raises taxes on 38 million middle class families, cuts Medicare up to $100 billion within four years, and makes it harder for veterans who are unemployed or homeless to get help. 2/3
I do want to simplify our tax code and I do want tax reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students. 1/3
