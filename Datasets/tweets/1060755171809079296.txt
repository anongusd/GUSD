@jkl620 @PaulTenorio They have 9; two players (Campos and Adams) are likely to get GCs soon, and of those left, Hasler, Edwards, and Collier will likely spend time outside of Chicago (either as loans to USL or as a transfer).
@FireTransfers @SkywayWilly I think he's deciding whether he wants to stay here or go back to Germany.
@SkywayWilly @FireTransfers And Niko's rather unlikely, I think. He's gone after this year so I doubt he'd want to go through the trouble.

RT @DLoesch: Don’t petition the government to do what your church SHOULD do instead.
@brian_gendo Campos definitely (they're waiting for him I guess). Adams, Basti, and MAYBE Niko could get one. Outside of that, Collier is already certified to go on loan; Adams will probably join him. Hasler is on the "Possible Trade" block.

@ihate_everyone2 And it works extremely well for them.
@ihate_everyone2 I think on the EC, the feds can do something as long as states agree (Amendment time basically). Obviously it can't disenfranchise every state but four or five.
@JesseKellyDC Here in Manatee County we have a bad one.
@ihate_everyone2 They can, but only two states don't follow the total PV
@ihate_everyone2 No, the House doesn't vote that way. The votes are given to whoever wins, all of them. Of course you have rogue electors but a lot of districts don't vote the way the state does.
@ihate_everyone2 No, the Senate votes still exist and go the way of the state as a whole. Proportional just means the districts vote for themselves as well. (Well, the one definition I'm supportive of)
@ihate_everyone2 Proportional would still leave it with the states, and would make everyone's vote count (which anyone in IL for example outside of Chicago can tell you it doesn't). Swing States would undoubtedly still exist as always, too. It's just that now the districts are in play.
@ihate_everyone2 I want to adhere to the Constitution. But there are things that I think need to be done so that we don't have a handful of areas deciding on who runs the nation.
@ihate_everyone2 I don't mind seeing that
@ihate_everyone2 Idk, since it makes the candidates actually focus on the districts and people who're going to be voting for them and puts power into the hands of everyone and the states. Not just a couple of them.
@ihate_everyone2 The EC needs work (proportional would be better imo) but yeah... Let's have only a handful of cities control everything. That's gonna end well and definitely won't create a high chance for a potential conflict.

Typical preseason game. Hopefully #cf97 gets some players in soon to help.	Kinda worth noting: Collier and Reynolds are the only players not yet to play this offseason. Reynolds had an injury after the US Camp.
With that said, positives:	-Dax looks good as per usual	-Djordje; just, Djordje. Maybe because he's been training for weeks longer than anyone else, but he's been undoubtedly the best player by miles.	-Ousted looking decent; not too much to go on, but he already beats Bava.	#cf97

@GayPatriot You know, the more I see that field the more I understand an Independent bid by Schultz...
@epsteinnoahh @ChicagoFireSoc1 No; just Twitter updates, sadly.
@aggierican @velvetsugar76 A tattoo of a dog?
@ChicagoFire Will the game be watchable online?
@RantyAmyCurtis @Patriot_Musket @physicsgeek @OrdyPackard @TMZ Find it funny that this happened in Chicago... Yeah that's totally a major MAGA city.
@douglawson81 @ChicagoFire @_moadams @DaxMcCarty11 @jeremiahgutjahr He's there, just not in those photos.
@mrs_pinky85 Yeah, it's doubtful he'll cost Trump unless NeverTrump ends up being MASSIVE compared to 2016 (unlikely). My guess is if Democrats nominate Harris, Trump cruises; if they nominate Biden, then it'll get interesting.
@mrs_pinky85 I think Schultz stands a better chance than Perot, honestly... Enough to win the thing outright? Nope. Enough to send it to the House? More likely. Enough to influence it to the point that he costs one candidate the race? DEFINITELY.
@Dawnsfire @_wintergirl93 @aurora_g96 Sounds about right!
@theone20152016 @FreedomRecon I was told I'd be done with homework after my high school closed...
@GentlemanRascal It was taken during a porno; they figured that it'd be the perfect ending if there were fireworks going off.
@RantyAmyCurtis Yeah, I'm not holding hope on Harris. I'm more worried about 2024 with her. With Bernie in play, the field's gonna be so split on the far left it'll be hard for Biden NOT to win. (And I expect he knows this)
@Folsom23 When they get back from Spain they'll have some I imagine.
@OrdyPackard "Seven Ways 'Learn to Code' is a Toxic Tag! Number three will shock you!"
@Howardspolitics @AG_Conservative Kasich's not getting that many votes from GOPers no matter what- ESPECIALLY if the choice is Trump or Harris (as many will ultimately view it). Also, it's easy to imagine Kasich joining Schultz's ticket (similar to Trump and Pence). He's running as a centrist, so.
@AG_Conservative Perhaps their best Moderate choice is Biden.		That's kinda saying a lot, though, isn't it?
@AndreaNRuth @AsheSchow "Are we playing David and Goliath?"
@FireTransfers Minnesota's putting together a damn good team, honestly...
Katai officially listed as a DP on the Fire's roster page. #cf97 (No international tag but I think that's more of a minor oversight on the page than anything indicative)
@JGrytheFireGuy Trialists are likelier when they get back, I think.
You know he isn't in charge anymore right? https://t.co/DFT6wNCIGX
Schultz running would be... Erm. Massive. IDK if it hurts Dems as much as many think (probably hurts both equally) but it'd definitely raise the stakes for the Democratic nominee to make his/her name known. Biden may be happy with this idea, honestly... https://t.co/x3O34tArm8
@toodrunk2flux Not way too high, honestly. He didn't cost us games, so he's better than many others. Granted he didn't PLAY any, but there's a whole mess of people that didn't play for the Fire.

@JHolmsted So- I just thought of this...		If you constantly claim "It's just a bunch of cells" then aren't you calling it a living being? I mean, a single-celled organism is a very real thing that lives. So... How is a multi-celled organism not?
@Firetalk97 Still go after them if they can. Moreno is unlikely as @fireconf has pointed out. The other one... No clue who he is, so.
@mchastain81 @SFGate The emu revolution has begun...
@ChiFireEyedBoy Where'd you see that?
My guess on the first and second lineups currently. Only Reynolds and Del Grecco aren't included.	#cf97 STILL needs a RB, LB, additional depth at CB, another striker wouldn't hurt since Collier's certainly going on loan, and a GK. https://t.co/k7xtX3TIRj
#cf97 Updated	-Official players (Per Tyrus on Reddit, Del Grecco has been waived)	-Unknown players		Fire are up to 24 official players. 10 or 11 internationals (NDG) which'll be 9 or 10 when Campos gets his GC. https://t.co/HKyQO3FpAt
Also- looks like Ebenezer Ackon isn't going to be joining the squad. He's currently trialing/practicing with San Antonio FC, which wouldn't make sense if he was still on the club's mind (Indy and Lansing more likely due to affiliation). #cf97
The Fire have announced an average of a player every day since Preseason started. Who's coming tomorrow? #cf97
@meninred97 Yeah, those two hurt. But there are other ways to win that battle...
@meninred97 A GK, a true RB, a true LB, and some more depth across the board.		This could be a good year!
!!!! #cf97	https://t.co/X6ndpzTlgI
@Firetalk97 Minus Frankowski; he's in the snow with his family.
And yet, you want to expand it into more of everyone's lives- making it there regardless and making it even more of a force on day-to-day life.		You could start to do this by ending the personal income tax and working from there. But we all know nobody in Washington wants that... https://t.co/0X9wWl7bIC
@mchastain81 If Biden runs that's probably 40% of the base right away...
@FireConf Good for him. He deserves it.
Roster now at 21, 22 with Reynolds. #cf97 https://t.co/M13McPDojS
@AveDeFuego29 @JoshuaNorgaard We were down anyways tbf
@ShirleyNoMates Bava?		Also, probably gonna see Campos on the right; and I can guarantee Del Grecco won't be starting. He may be in Lansing or Indy already...
@VixenRogue @ProperOpinion Note to self: never cuddle future girlfriend on couch...
@GayPatriot Oh God your celebration is gonna be something...
@OrdyPackard I don't feel sorry anymore for openly partisan journalists losing their jobs...
@hboulware Libertarians also seem to be going to bad candidates again too...
@ihate_everyone2 The ultimate sign of respect
Worth mentioning, Moreno is also a striker and I think that's where he'll be. So he's probably pushing Collier to Indy for the season bar injury. #cf97 	Now on to the backline! 8 spots remaining... https://t.co/iLPyN2JzLV
@AlexisinNH Who isn't?
@meninred97 @AveDeFuego29 @Cmartinezz1221 Yes but needs development. Will spend the season in Lansing no doubt.
@JoshuaNorgaard @JosiahTMcElroy @meninred97 Collier
@meninred97 It's Corrales.
@MIkesfootballs1 @Jiggly_333 And not on the club, waived on August 9
@Jiggly_333 Reynolds is between Adams and Lillard; Amando Moreno is next to them; Martinez is behind Niko and Marcelo is in front of him.
#cf97 In case anyone missed it (IDK why it was deleted, but this was posted earlier by the Fire). https://t.co/eASPQyNqz4
One DP slot will be open for 2020, it seems: #cf97	Niko's contract is up, alongside Basti's; Katai has an option and, per Tyrus, isn't going to be a DP next year.	https://t.co/qAXEaEiGgX
@Anish20221020 Close, mostly due to full backs and GK
@eGehrig16 Good luck over there!
@VixenRogue Gilmore at least got some memes from it...
@PhiloFiles @LadyJessMacBeth I know I don't.		I mean, what? https://t.co/uLorgFEPdE
@FireTransfers @ChicagoFire Gut feeling says we'll have a few more soon.
@Toyota_Tech701 @samstejskal Hector Moreno is one; the other is the big question mark...
@christiancastro @AveDeFuego29 The Waiver Draftee. He's likely going to sign simply for depth, and he has a GC which makes him more valuable.
@SoonerManInAZ @Mellecon Sadly.
#cf97 is up to 20 official players, 1 unofficial, and 5 in camp. (Amando Moreno being likely to sign)	In terms of internationals, they have 11 official and 1 in camp.		Also- per Tyrus, Kapp has reached an agreement; they're just seeing if a trade comes in.
@SoonerManInAZ @Mellecon I wish the media actually did its job. As someone who wants to go into politics, this makes me extremely unnerved for a number of reasons...
@Mellecon The more the media does, the more I'm willing to say Trump is 100% right on them being an enemy of the people.		I'm not necessarily there on voting FOR him, but damn they're trying their hardest...
#cf97 Updated:	-Returning Players	-Reportedly Signed Players	-Officially Signed Players	-Those in Camp/Draftees		Hopefully we get a list of trialists soon. https://t.co/XGgYlffjuk

@eGehrig16 @meninred97 @ChicagoFire No, we mean the WHOLE jersey being flag-themed.
@meninred97 @ChicagoFire @eGehrig16 If you could incorporate the city (and perhaps the Illinois flag) it'd be the best jersey in the league.
@meninred97 @ChicagoFire Ironically, back in 2017 I was wearing a shirt with this logo; @eGehrig16 saw it and I told him we needed a jersey like it. https://t.co/vTe5GwqMBo
@meninred97 God damn. That is good...
@meninred97 @MotorolaUS They live on in our hearts.

@ihate_everyone2 Shit, I make that as a cashier at a grocery store and I don't even get full time...
@Chuck_De_Jager @RobProvince @EsotericCD How did the "OK" and "3" sign go from just that to white supremacist? FFS, by that logic ANYTHING can be white supremacist.		Oh wait, who am I talking about.
@JoshuaNorgaard @irishoutsider @ThirstyPoet @Eclipse_74 @ChicagoFire Maybe. But money talks. I imagine MLS saw how much it raked in and opted to let it go. The marketing is, obviously, not good, but they clearly don't care.
@JoshuaNorgaard @irishoutsider @ThirstyPoet @Eclipse_74 @ChicagoFire MLS probably makes some good money off of it.
Again... Is nobody going to mention the fact that countless non-trans people can't legally join the military due to mental or physical illnesses? FFS I can't because of Autism. Understandably, I might add.	This isn't just "OMG TRANS PEOPLE" this is actually a common thing... https://t.co/UCUOzzBvQE
@brian_gendo Campos is likelier to get his GC. Hasler, NDG, and Collier are likeliest to be cut/waived, but a loan for the later two are likelier. Adams is in a "let's see" situation I think; I saw something about a GC awhile back but IDR where or when. If he doesn't, he'll go on loan.
@Gormogons Honestly... I say abolish federal aid for everything and let the states do what they want with it.
Is nobody going to mention the fact that Autism is not allowed either? No? OK. https://t.co/lgvQ5TZyu4
@Gormogons See @StephenLHall
@ScotsFyre @chadfelixg I like the article.		My honest thought- keep an eye on Bernie. If he runs, the far left is extremely split. If he doesn't? Biden has an easier time honestly.
@ScotsFyre @chadfelixg Worth noting with the amount of candidates we're going to have a 2016 situation; many will cancel each other out.
@AveDeFuego29 A starting LB, another RB depending on Hasler and Campos, two starting caliber CBs, and some more depth there, and a pure 10. 5 players at least.
@Mellecon They've never watched basketball...

@Jiggly_333 @ShirleyNoMates ATM, I doubt it. You figure the current configuration, it's either Campos or Hasler- and Campos seems likelier (seems like Hasler became more of a depth player towards the end).
@JHolmsted See my conversation with @ian_mckelvey.	If they weren't wearing those hats, they wouldn't be in this mess... (Should we ask those idiots if they have the same view on women's skirts?)
For those wondering, @CristianJM18 is in Chicago per his IG story. #cf97

@Jiggly_333 @ShirleyNoMates Campos on the right and Edwards on the left; Hasler, Herber, or Collier start on the right opposite of Katai.
@ian_mckelvey They did something wrong- they wore a hat in public... FFS, what a load of crap.

@FireTransfers @JoshuaNorgaard @FireEngine97 You're good.	IDK. I think he wants to come to Chicago, or just MLS in general. But IDK if the Fire are interested in him at all. My guess is he's not on their radar, and they're trying to get someone else.
@FireTransfers @JoshuaNorgaard @FireEngine97 I know a guy who knows guys (it ain't hard to figure out who honestly) but when I asked he said it doesn't seem like the Fire are interested.	Kronholm, however... I think he's interested in Chicago.
@FireTransfers @JoshuaNorgaard @FireEngine97 Not exactly lol

@LadyJessMacBeth The idea of having a seemingly infinite amount of money is a smaller but similar comparison. For us, it's amazing to think about and makes our minds go numb just imagining having that in our pocket. It's just unfathomable and seems to make no sense whatsoever.
@LadyJessMacBeth Imagine, all our knowledge today, of the universe, humans, the sea, everything. Imagine going back and just describing a part (including pictures) to an average person in Jerusalem in the days of Jesus. And imagine that person.	It's overwhelming and far-out concept.

@PolitiBunny Senate GOP agrees
@FreedomRecon So no sex for me then...
@PolitiBunny @hboulware Well Constitutionally ignorant is infinitely better than rabid pro-death...
@PolitiBunny And if Pence said "OH SHIT" and knew he was done too, he'd step down and Trump would appoint someone else

@Firetalk97 One pure fullback (Corrales who can play on both sides), plus two additional players who can play one side each.
@Jiggly_333 @FireTransfers @Firetalk97 When I played my coach opted to put me at RB for some reason in the last 20 minutes of a game (we were losing 6-0 so it wasn't major). I was so bad there he said "Don go back to striker!"
@mrs_pinky85 What's this about a young person winning a seat?! :(
@Bmac0507 Damn, that's brilliant...
Worth noting that- again- many "Revelations" about Trump ultimately fall flat, and there's honestly no reason to expect different. But if this is just part of what Mueller has (BIG if) then I think it's safe to say Trump is a one termer...
Now if this is true, then Trump being impeached and removed from office are ten times likelier. Telling a lawyer to lie to Congress isn't exactly something that'll make all of the GOP back him nonstop.	But looking ahead- IDK if that'd be a good thing for Democrats in 2020... https://t.co/nfKh5Sj7pf
When your solution for paying for it is to continually rob people (you're not going to just go after the 1% with this, and you know it) and call it "For the greater good" then yeah- it's pretty radical... https://t.co/hUEIHVBJRM
@mchastain81 This what you're looking for? https://t.co/Iu5kivcIMU
And full back- only one per side and one who can play both sides ATM. #cf97
If ALL of the above players signed, #cf97 would be at 28 players total, including 14 internationals, 2 or 3 DPs, 4 HGs, and 1 GA.	Goalkeeper still needs addressing regardless of who all signs- currently only 2 at all on this list.
#cf97 UPDATE (removed Kappelhof and Polster entirely)	This is the official list of players, players who're currently in negotiations, and reportedly signed or done-deal transfers/signings. We'll get trialists later, and I'll update this when we get word on who all is in camp. https://t.co/LJCjkDZp2Y

@LadyJessMacBeth He who fails to yeet history shall be doomed to repeat it.
I mean, we all know he's getting loaned. But the fact that it's so early is... Not a good sign for him, probably... #cf97
Kind of minor, but Nicolas Del Grecco is still listed as loaned out on the Fire's roster page, even though last year's loans have been taken off (Collier and Campos). Is there a chance he doesn't even play in preseason? #cf97
@ProperOpinion She came up with this didn't she?
RT @RantyAmyCurtis: If you want hard work to pay off, don’t tax my income at 70%. https://t.co/pKYIWJFND3
@FireTransfers Maybe. My guess is Frankowski is done and done, just needs the final signature from that team.
@jessejfisher Hasler is probably being shopped, Collier and Del Grecco are on their way to Indy/Lansing (maybe Adams too), and Campos (and maybe some more) are hoping to get their GCs (Adams may be there again, or maybe someone else like Basti).
@FireTransfers I think it was a case of "Racing thinks the deal is done, just waiting" being reported down there while Chicago was also pursuing someone else (Frankowski) who makes this deal unlikely.
@FireTransfers If #cf97 doesn't reach the foreign quota. It'll be decided today or tomorrow.

@Frayed_Nets @ChicagoFire $68,254.20		Like I said, they probably just didn't see his play in 2018 as a good indicator of how he'd play in the future. Wasn't financial, just pay related.
@velvetsugar76 @Patriot_Musket @_wintergirl93 No, that'd be a herring.
@Frayed_Nets @ChicagoFire He wasn't great in his outings, and he's been somewhat injury prone. It just wasn't a good mix. He has promise but, it just didn't match with Veljko apparently.

@JHolmsted @RorschachsRules I think it ultimately depends on the limits themselves and the role government plays. Here I think it's two in Senate, three in House. Basically Cruz's amendment. It's also fairly limited so.
@JHolmsted @RorschachsRules Living here I know they work well. I went into it in a post a week or so ago.	But since I'd also like to be in Congress I'd be lying if I said there was no selfishness involved
@RorschachsRules @JHolmsted Adding on to that it gets harder to unseat them due to party politics unless they pull a King move...
@LibertyJen Germany (mainly the Alps/Bavaria), Ireland, Netherlands, Australia, Hokkaido, Israel, and I guess Greece and Italy would be the ones I'd love to see. The mountains, history, etc. It'd be too good to pass up for me.
@_wintergirl93 Why is she shocked he's denying it? That's all the media have been hyped up on since he won...
@LibertyJen That's always humorous.
@LibertyJen I honestly don't mind. Mostly because when I'm President Aurelios Pizza will be the go-to
@Jiggly_333 Not this year. Frankowski and Ojeda were above him. I think they were in the "if he wants to ok" camp, not the "immediately sign him" one.
@Jiggly_333 He wasn't really a Fire target...
@jessejfisher @AveDeFuego29 @FireEngine97 Adams	Campos (GC likely)	Collier	NDG	Basti	Niko	Katai	Marcelo	Edwards	Hasler (?)		Frankowski would be #11, with Urena (possibly) being #12.
@AveDeFuego29 @PaulTenorio @FireConf Thanks! I'm planning on doing that once we get a yes or no on Polster and Kapp, that way we have a fresh start if you will.
#cf97 Updated (Frankowski not added, will only add once he's official, only including Reynolds and Gutjahr due to the history of @PaulTenorio and @FireConf)		Preseason begins in a week, so I expect some trialists to join this list. And maybe a few player announcements? https://t.co/FoffQ8SnZK
@FireTransfers Forrest did good in college- we'll see what the kid can do at this level...
Mark Forest to #cf97
Grant Stoneman to #cf97
Ebenezer Ackon to #cf97
@imnotnumber4 Idk if he's going to sign, though
@jessejfisher @AveDeFuego29 @FireEngine97 Loanees still count against the slots. They would've needed to offload an international or two that they didn't want to.
@FireTransfers Comsia and Stoneman would be interesting picks, IMO. Stoneman has Chicago ties and like you said, Comsia may be the best (I don't know so I'm going off what you say).
@FireTransfers I wouldn't mind that as long as none of them end up occupying an international roster slot.
@FireTransfers Maybe- but who's available that would be capable of filling in Campbell's shoes?
Beyond that- this team is honestly in very good shape. The offense and midfield is extremely good and has plenty of decent depth. Maybe a pure striker for additional depth- but even then, it'd be an addition to a good group. #cf97
#cf97 needs as it stands (factoring in Frankowski, Gutjahr, Moreno, and Reynolds)	Starting GK	Starting RB	Starting LCB	One or two depth CBs	Starting LB		Campos, Corrales, and Edwards can provide depth at LB and RB; # of CBs will probably depend on one dude's play (Lillard)
@FireTransfers Swap! Swap! Swap!
@Anish20221020 @MLS_Buzz Ojeda was likely being held up because of Frankowski.
@JGrytheFireGuy Considering I don't think Hasler makes it through preseason? Definitely not him
@g_malcs @Toyota_Tech701 @FireConf @TransfersMLS @magee18 Possible
Honestly kinda expected it to be him...	With him and Frankowski, I think it's safe to say the Fire will have a good offense in depth and on the field. Defense now please... #cf97 https://t.co/GFkuAkdQ8p
@imnotnumber4 @Toyota_Tech701 @FireConf @TransfersMLS @magee18 Yup, but it seems like they've already signed him. (At least that's how I took NRods statement)
@JoshuaNorgaard @douglawson81 Martinez isn't an international; Campos is likely to get his Green Card, according to TyrusRose; Hasler, Collier, and NDG are all likely going out on loan/being transfered/traded, and there's a very good chance Urena isn't signing (see pinned tweet). That takes it to 7 INTs.
@JoshuaNorgaard Definitely. Worth noting, Frankowski can play RWB too. I wouldn't mind seeing Ojeda brought in as well- but that's highly unlikely, of course
@JGrytheFireGuy He's not bad, but he's definitely a better attacking player IMO. With that said, if he can develop, I can see him being a damn fine RB/RW/CAM in the future (ironically similar to Frankowski in a way).
@Toyota_Tech701 @FireConf @TransfersMLS CB: Hector Moreno	Three Attacking Players: Ojeda and Frankowski probably; unknown on the third	GK: Unknown (Is @magee18 coming out of retirement?)	Then you have the unknown Red Bull.
@JGrytheFireGuy My guess is they're going to hope for Edwards/Campos if they can't find anyone.
@JGrytheFireGuy Unless they bring Kapp back, Marcelo's probably the RCB for now. If they can get Hector Moreno then they'll need some more depth, but the back line will be impressive.
@FireConf The offense is deadly now. Just need a new GK, RB, LB, and a CB, along with some depth along there (and more depth up top). This could be a good season.
@mchastain81 @BruceTheGay Why did someone draw that?!
@SaintRPh How are so many bears on that tree?	WHY are that many on that tree?
@FireTransfers Thanks! I'm wondering how to keep this going in the season- I'll figure something out later.
@vtrainstuopys @thanson1990 @ChicagoFireSoc1 Lol no worries
@thanson1990 @ChicagoFireSoc1 Definitely- ironically, the reverse is in place for Raheem Edwards. The Fire site lists him as a domestic, but mls lists him as an international.
@vtrainstuopys @thanson1990 @ChicagoFireSoc1 Tenorio?		(He didn't link Chicago and Plata, AFAIK; this is more speculation from @ChicagoFireSoc1 which is interesting speculation, albeit unlikely)
@jessejfisher @AveDeFuego29 @FireEngine97 IDK if they'd want to do that. Ojeda could cost more than it's worth, honestly (as someone said on Reddit, he has many similarities to Martinez without the international tag). Ojeda would lock the Fire's international situation for some time, making it hard to sign anyone.
@lifebythecreek Castro's highest in a poll at the national and state level was 2% in a national poll in December.		I'm not gonna put money on him right now...
@FireTransfers IIRC, I saw something else saying 1.3 million Euros ($1.49 million USD); I think it also said he'd make a million a year, so he'd be a high-level TAM player similar to Katai.
@thanson1990 @ChicagoFireSoc1 According to the MLS roster page, Plata isn't an international- so that isn't what would hold it up.
@RobProvince I like this idea that because a chunk are VISA overstays, a wall (which would help stop more than just illegal immigration) is completely pointless...
@JHolmsted @ScotsFyre They're trying to beat the GOP record in 2016...		Considering four have gotten in and only one is above 3% in most polls, I think we're nowhere near the end of the tunnel...
@MLS_Buzz Attacking player #3, perhaps? #cf97	@FireConf @PaulTenorio @samstejskal
@AveDeFuego29 @FireEngine97 Honestly, this might be (and probably is) what kept Ojeda waiting- and may end that saga. Doubtful they're going to get both.
@FireEngine97 Per @PaulTenorio the deal between Frankowski and the Fire is done. The transfer just needs approval from Jagiellonia (who I totally didn't have to google to remember how to spell their name...).
@ian_mckelvey @RobProvince Ffs.		Of all people, Israel would probably be beaten up worse than anything if the parents came in contact with him...
@ian_mckelvey Please tell me you're joking
@FreedomRecon The looming catastrophe that's been going on since... Well, since before I was even a thought in my parent's heads!
@JohnEkdahl That felon law seems to have everyone concerned- I'm hopeful too.
@LadyJessMacBeth Why did you share that?!
@moxiemom The dog bed
@moxiemom Is that a box or a bed?
@JohnEkdahl In all seriousness though WTF happened with the polls? I get they might be off, but that off?!

@FireTransfers Technically, I think he was traded- the Fire were rumored to have paid $500k IIRC. I know traded, itself, isn't the best in context; but I just use it as a basic thing since everyone knows what it means.
Also: Frankowski and Ojeda aren't included ATM due to, well- Chicago, but since Gutjahr and Reynolds seem fairly certain and have reliable sources I think it's safe to add them to the "Officially Added" list. #cf97
#cf97 Updated		Notes:	-Hasler has been linked elsewhere and per Reddit he isn't happy in Chicago, expect him to be somewhere else soon	-Saprissa are apparently interested in Urena, who hasn't actually signed with the club	-Martinez is unknown, but currently in Panama https://t.co/G6ivgFI3k2
@FireConf Frankowski and Ojeda, plus one more now?
@_JustinEllis @moxiemom His election is what's making me question WTF is up with polling even more than 2016... How do you get the actual thing so flipping wrong?!?!
@FireTransfers Maybe.
@FireTransfers Wonder what the odds of the Fire actually picking anyone are- or if they'll trade them too, which I wouldn't be too upset about if we can get some solid proven depth.
@Jiggly_333 Well it's definitely not for a draft pick in the 2nd.
@ihate_everyone2 I- erm...
@TheDanSanto Any idea who the person is?
@FireTransfers @meninred97 @DjoMihailovic I don't think that'll stop them.
@_spell @samstejskal @meninred97 Erm... lol
@FireTransfers @meninred97 @DjoMihailovic Djordje being a backup to Katai wouldn't be too big honestly. Katai tired last year- he didn't miss a single game...
@meninred97 That would be me- Panionios in Greece (sp?). But I also saw someone say @samstejskal said he was also a Cincinnati target, IDK how true that is.
@meninred97 If Frankowski AND Ojeda sign, I can guarantee Hasler won't be a Fire player anymore. Collier, Del Grecco, and Hasler are all likely to be loaned out or sold if true. (Regardless of Ojeda and Frankowski, honestly)
@FireTransfers @meninred97 Yeesh... Hopefully he does good there, then.
@meninred97 Yup. Question is- if true what would this mean for Ojeda?
@meninred97 He's not bad- went into the shortlist for Poland's World Cup team.
@FireTransfers If this is true- this would explain the Allocation Money... #cf97		Still, Ojeda also seeming likely to join.
@FireConf Who could the dude be?

@samstejskal Thanks!
@SoccerInsider Honest question for you, @samstejskal, @SoccerByIves, and anyone who may have an answer:	With Philadelphia having no picks, do they still get an actual table at the draft?
@chadfelixg I'd like that. Unfortunately the big two don't, the big three third parties aren't interested in it, and none of the others are capable of doing it.	Hey @RMConservative this is your moment...
Adding onto that- Mihailovic and Marcelo are the only ones currently under contract through next year. #cf97
Just throwing this out there:	Per info I've been able to gather (from @FireConf's posts and Fire statements), #cf97 will have three players out of contract at year's end. Hasler, Nikolic, and Basti.
@ScotsFyre I've been watching it since 2016 just to see how crazy it can get.	I can drink in August so... Just gotta survive until then.
Politics and soccer I guess? And being a single Autistic weirdo.		Meh, not bad. https://t.co/5w4mZe0hwp
@LtDan61350 @ahan_jain10 They haven't updated it I think. Also worth noting Campos is apparently close to getting a green card
@moxiemom https://t.co/pkDqUuT0b8
@kaijubushi @moxiemom But how many has he eaten?
@SoccerByIves Chicago... What're you expecting?
@Jiggly_333 @FireConf I haven't seen him play, but if he's good enough to be invited to the US Youth National Team camps he must have something positive. It'll be interesting to see if he's going to be a more long-term investment, with Indy and Lansing, or an immediate bench player/starter.
@Jiggly_333 @FireConf A LB currently with the US U-19 team.
@FireEngine97 @ChanceKev @TrueMartyParty I think they'll be loaned out immediately once they're announced. But Hasler is what's keeping Ojeda I think.
@FireEngine97 @ChanceKev @TrueMartyParty No clue.
@FireEngine97 @ChanceKev @TrueMartyParty I think Collier's going to Indy, Del Grecco probably to Lansing
@ChanceKev @TrueMartyParty Reynolds, Mendoza, we have quite a few honestly. I wish I could say they're ready right away, but.	And right now we still have Campos and Edwards regardless. They're unlikely to leave, so we have it on both flanks. And are younger
@TrueMartyParty @ChanceKev I think that's closer to the truth, it's not like Racing seems interested in keeping him. The Fire likely want to cut it now before they have a scramble.
@ChanceKev @TrueMartyParty Hasler hasn't really been that great... And there are people other than Gutman in the system. We're likely going to see at least one sign, maybe two.
@FireTransfers Reynolds was already fairly certain honestly
@TrueMartyParty Hasler likely the guy.
@moxiemom https://t.co/btkSSF4WT6
@moxiemom Why do people think Scott would run? He'll be in his mid 70s by 2024
@Jiggly_333 Though you know what- now that I say that, I just thought. I live like a mile away from that sort of environment. IMG would be a perfect example of what to do.	What if the clubs actually did something like IMG? Schools with heavy focuses on soccer, sponsored by the clubs.
@Jiggly_333 That'd make sense, but still wouldn't allow kids to go where they'd like which is kinda needed.		IDK, honestly. So many people complain, but the reasons to go to college and the soccer itself... IDK if there's really a way to work those things out while keeping college relevant.
@Jiggly_333 What would be a way to change that? The only thing I can think of is have college-level teams sponsored by clubs.

@LadyJessMacBeth As long as she's breathing and willing to date a weird Autistic dude I'm happy.
@ArchiJake @IndyEleven @lansingignite IIRC- the Fire did have a PDL team before didn't they?
@LadyJessMacBeth Can you bring an Irish girl back?
@AveDeFuego29 @IowaFireFans The most credible source is a guy on Reddit (he's been talked about a bunch) who said it was, indeed, Moreno.
@FireTransfers @AveDeFuego29 @IowaFireFans Apparently Kronholm isn't in the Fire's plans.
@FireTransfers @IowaFireFans @AveDeFuego29 I imagine there are- these are the guys who're deep in negotiation. If it gets too close, pull the trigger on other moves type of thing (likely in league)
@ArchiJake @IndyEleven @lansingignite I think it's a little different now since the PDL is incorporated into USL; there could be one in the future, maybe.
@StephenLHall @LadyJessMacBeth How would you know this?
Also said a team is currently looking for a replacement for the leaving player; this is what's holding up that specific negotiation, not sure which one it is though. #cf97 Full podcast here: (Nelson at 52:08)	https://t.co/rnmSBwT0wc
Of note from @ExtraTimeRadio's interview with NRod:	-In talks with a goalkeeper, expected decision before preseason camp	-In talks with a world class CB; needs a decision by the end of the month (Moreno?)	-In talks with an attacking player who isn't a 10 (probably Ojeda)	#cf97
Of note: Collier played for Indy last year, and somehow I expect will be there again. Del Grecco I expect will spend the season in Lansing. #cf97
#cf97 @IndyEleven (USL Championship) and @lansingignite (USL League One) are apparently the new Chicago Fire affiliates.

@vtrainstuopys @FireTransfers I think they'd save that for Del Grecco if it is the case (@FireConf any idea). Sanchez has enough upside that you could keep him and just wait out his contract.	Del Grecco, on the other hand... WHY he was signed, the world may never know.
@FireTransfers @vtrainstuopys I think Sanchez is interesting to a team that has a desire for a future potential GK, yeah. But the offputing part is his $130k salary. For comparison, Zack Steffen made $145k... Considering Sanchez still needs a lot of work, that might be what dooms any trades just involving him
@vtrainstuopys @FireTransfers I posted this awhile back, but on Reddit a guy (who always seems to be right) was saying Kapp just doesn't care- about much of anything. To the point that he's pretty lazy, and apparently late for a lot of stuff (at least according to him).
@FireTransfers @vtrainstuopys Kappelhof, Hasler, and probably Campos are the ones who'd likely attract any amount of attention within MLS (alongside Niko). Sanchez, Cleveland, Del Grecco, and Collier aren't going to another MLS side.		If a trade happens in the first round, I expect it'll be Kapp.
@FireTransfers @vtrainstuopys Williams is highly touted as well, and most mock drafts I've seen have him being drafted by the Fire too.
@FireTransfers @vtrainstuopys Definitely. Question of him stepping on immediately is major- but with him not counting against the cap and not being an international? It's worth the risk (plus they're going to trade into the first again I imagine, so they'll have a few picks).
@vtrainstuopys I don't think Andre Blake is in the mix, but Dayne St. Clair is highly touted. Beyond him, it's anyone's guess honestly...
@AveDeFuego29 I'm wondering if the Rangers offered him a first team contract or more of a reserve contract.	The Fire's offer isn't that good, apparently. Hopefully they opt to up it big time.

@OwenGoal Didn't say thar. I'd love to see it like that but it's not the way they've done things in the past. I expect that'll change soon, though.
@OwenGoal It's honestly not that shocking given Fire history. 5 pre-Nelson, 4 in his time (likely to grow with Reynolds and Gutjahr and maybe some more). And Fire picks weren't as common from Pineda to NRod. (14 from 2011-2015 vs 16 in just 3 years)
The candidates who best have the opportunity to top Trump aren't dumb enough to try and take on an incumbent President, and most of them are young enough they can wait for 2024. (Cruz, Haley, DeSantis, Rubio, etc.)
No. You want to primary Trump- go ahead. But if you want to actually stop him, embracing the guy who helped stop the guy who could beat him from winning and has the appeal of a dead mouse to any of Trump's base or Conservatives in general isn't the way to do it. https://t.co/50OXdWBxxL

@thefunnymuggle @Bmac0507 Nikki Haley would rock
@ArchiJake Hard to disagree with that- I'm hoping the money he invests is partially in scouting.		Still, we'll see what happens at the draft. I'm wondering if there'll be a flurry of trades before then...
@N1ckels5 @ArchiJake Yup. (If only he had a twitter)
@ArchiJake I'm not sure about this offseason. With Mansuetto, we'll have a team that actually has an owner willing to spend...	Right now, NRod has a major chance to prove he can do it when given actual money. I'm hoping he takes it- Ojeda is a major step in the right direction.
@ArchiJake If Reddit's right, they're talking with a left footed CB. This would probably mean Kapp's days are done. #cf97
@ArchiJake I don't think we're losing 90% of our roster... And him leaving doesn't do much. RB was still in need of being addressed, and now it just goes into the major spot.
@ArchiJake Maybe
@ArchiJake He may be going to Greece.	https://t.co/PIgfLTDnjN
#cf97 has 2 RB, 2 LB, 5 CB. Corrales is the only pure full back (and a CB) and NDG, Lillard, and Marcelo are the only pure CBs.	With the wings addressed, the Fire NEED to address the backline... Kapp, Polster, and Gutman seem good as gone, too.
Assuming Ojeda signs and Hasler leaves, #cf97 has 8 potential wingers (three who started out at other positions). They had 5 at the end in 2017 (not counting Goossens and Calistri), so they've DEFINITELY addressed the winger depth issue we had back then. Now for defense...
@Gormogons @ihate_everyone2 Dammit, Puter!

@IowaFireFans I'm looking forward to Ojeda- cautiously...
@ihate_everyone2 Part of the reason he won the nomination was because of the Romney's of the party. Sophisticated but never does anything to actually limit the government or advance Conservative ideals. Most Conservatives have gotten tired of that, ya know...
@back_ttys I don't think they're going to understand the consequences of this...		People like saying we're close to a civil war. If that becomes a major Democratic pushing point, we're not going to be close to one anymore. It'll literally be here...
@ihate_everyone2 Plus we've had a drunk as POTUS (who is on the $50), a shit load of liars, racists, and sexists (both by modern non-SJW standards). And how many womanizers other than JFK?
#cf97 Hasler to Greece?	https://t.co/PcyJkMNLKV
@meninred97 I wouldn't call him a vet- he's only been in the league since 2016 and made a grand total of 27 appearances since signing.		Depth is likely the only reason they're being signed, which I actually like. Considering in 2017 we had what, two wingers? Yeah, it's good to have depth...
@meninred97 Urena and Martinez- eh. I'm not sold, though I kinda expect both to sign and play somewhat as super subs.		But I expect we'll get more soon...

@VerumVulnero1 IDK, if Democrats opt for "Can beat Trump" over "Will give us Liberal paradise" then I can see Biden winning. Beto would be the guy I expect to keep his momentum, simply because he fits the Democrat's needs somewhat (young and not from a blue state). It'll be annoying, though...
@VerumVulnero1 I think it'll end up depending on who all gets in. In a race that could end up with over 30 people, it wouldn't be shocking if the name recognition gets Biden or Sanders the win.

@Frayed_Nets @OwenGoal @TrueMartyParty @jeychaner @ChicagoFire @MLS @SoundersFC @JonnyCampbell16 Probably.
@Frayed_Nets @OwenGoal @TrueMartyParty @jeychaner @ChicagoFire @MLS @SoundersFC @JonnyCampbell16 I think they exercise his option. So they're not negotiating until after next year.
@velvetsugar76 @unTayIored Makes sense
@Patriot_Musket @LadyJessMacBeth Yeah I'm positive this will work out well... I'm even more terrified to ask a girl out now.
@Anish20221020 Hell maybe?		I mean, there's a lot of upside- but if history has proven anything, one thing is never put a ton of stock in what a player COULD be in a few years. I'm happy they're getting him on a loan, and have the option to buy (albeit for a LOT of money).
@EricMertz_KC You can drop hints, kinda like putting a puzzle together.
@EricMertz_KC @ihate_everyone2 With their penis/breasts cut off over the ocean
@RonNehring I wish people learned that in 2016
@Firetalk97 Especially since one of them isn't even with the team anymore...
#cf97 updated		Took out the potential players- too many to keep up with; for that, go to @FireTransfers as they have a pretty good list of rumors.		With Marcelo added, the Fire currently have 18 players, 10 being international roster slot players, 3 DPs, and at least one TAM guy. https://t.co/YliJDz0lFN
@vjmfilms @GayPatriot That's offensive! #NotAllLutherans

@moxiemom https://t.co/wIaTj6xEMQ
@TrueMartyParty Honestly... Not the worst move for the Fire honestly. Good guy, hopefully he gets a ton of luck in Holland again.
@Sousa7474 @Efried97 Fire are waiting for him to get a bit bigger. With Gutman out and keeper a major priority, that may be changing.
@meninred97 @FireTransfers Sadly that might be needed...
@meninred97 @FireTransfers With MDL likely out and Urena in an unknown state, the draft may be required for striker depth.
@moxiemom @FatherSchultz Confirmation name? What's that? (I was confirmed a Lutheran so we didn't get names)
@FireTransfers @meninred97 Alessandrini for rights to MDL, Collier, Hasler, Del Grecco, and $750k in allocation with LA paying half of the salary
@hboulware https://t.co/qB5rJKAzvb
@hboulware Kids are fair game then?
@josh_hammer What're they arresting him for?
@BusyLittlestBee Also kind of a major difference:	You could walk around the wall, albeit it would've taken a hell of a long time. With a wall along the border it would be a LOT harder
@hboulware You remember that time I posted the kidney stone and abortion comparison? They're taking the "can't get dumber" thing as a challenge...
@hboulware My mom had two. She'd be happy to slap anyone who compared miscarriages and abortion...
@FireConf And LB became a top priority....
@Anish20221020 Still need to offload more than just Collier
@jwhiting360 Still need to get rid of 2-4 people.
In other words:	In order for #cf97 to be capable of MAYBE getting Ochoa, they'd need to offload several players and not sign MDL and Urena, as well as any other possible international. All US players or green card holders from now forward...
So assuming both Marcelo AND Ojeda sign, #cf97 will have a major issue. 11 players occupying 8 international slots. Adams, Campos, Collier, Hasler, Basti, Niko, Katai, Edwards, and Del Grecco. MDL and Urena would also occupy slots.

@TheRogue_Elf You think that makes you safe? 3:}
@TheRogue_Elf When I take over, you will be unemployed.
"OMG HE CALLED SOLDIERS HEROES!!!!"	-Soldiers willing to die for their country to defend it from all enemies	-Soldiers tend to be BIG on helping others (@JesseKellyDC would know best about this, but every vet I've had tends to donate if we're raising for charity)	How aren't they? https://t.co/psTbFcbYCN
@PolitiBunny What even is the purpose of that tweet? "OMG TRUMP CALLED SOLDIERS HEROES, HE'S FANBOYING!!!!!!"	Erm... Most all soldiers are heroes (some aren't but that's because they're dishonorable).
@PaulTenorio @MLSTransfers Hearing anything involving Chicago
@TheRogue_Elf You look like you're about to ask me if I've returned my taxes yet.		JK- looks good, dude.
@sarahmquinlan @MrJoshPerry Let's be honest here:	He's very clearly dealing with the undead, as they can't be killed.		Setting up torture chambers and trying to shew them off is the only way he can really deal with such monstrosities.
@nomorenightowl That is... Highly concerning...
@FireTransfers I imagine SOMETHING gets done involving the Fire, just not sure if it'll be a "Fire trade Collier/Hasler" type affair (two players likeliest to leave IMO) or "Fire acquire" type affair.	Add in the potential for draft picks, I think something will occur.
#cf97 interesting note: since Pauno and NRod took over, the Fire have exercised options on a player 24 times (not including this offseason's options). Of those 24 times, 6 players (1/4) were no longer with the club by the opening of the season. (2 mutual, 3 trades, 1 waive)
@jwhiting360 @N1ckels5 Per @FireConf he's pretty much a guarantee. I imagine after getting knocked out he's going to be signing soon.
#cf97 Update	-Removed Angeles and Las as there hasn't been any real indication the Fire are interested ATM (correct me if I'm wrong on either)	-May be updating this again tomorrow afternoon...		Also, Carlos de Pena is not a Free Agent; he plays for Club Nacional in Uruguay. https://t.co/BWNH3A6TbF
@douglawson81 @OwenGoal @SkywayWilly @JoshuaNorgaard @samstejskal Are you talking about Carlos de Pena?
Also, can people stop using "Impeachment" and "Removed from Office" interchangeably?	-Impeachments are carried by the House and are basically just saying "Hey Senate, maybe this guy should be removed"	-Removals actually have a real non-political impact
Ironically, if Trump and Pence left, it'd likely be Nancy Pelosi as POTUS... So in other words, the older and less likable Hillary Clinton. Even then, if the Cabinet were ruled null (how?), the Senate GOP would block a lot of appointees by Pelosi. https://t.co/joo8rRrtpa

@hboulware @NaughtyDerek Say Something I'm Giving Up On You	Pizza	Pizza	A Noah's Ark set when I was a kid. Cost something like $100 and we didn't have anywhere near that money. Parents managed to get it, though.
@VixenRogue I remember some in the Libertarian debate back in 2016 said that. I don't remember which dude's exactly, though.
@Mellecon @chadfelixg Shockingly some people made gay jokes back then. People make jokes about everything...
@_wintergirl93 Nah, looks fine to the polar bear. https://t.co/BkkwUbPldt

You're blaming Trump for something that hasn't even been linked to him... https://t.co/oZcclypR6x
@FireConf Looking forward to seeing them in Fire red next year.		Hopefully...
#cf97 Cagliari also in the running. https://t.co/zuQP9YSk6i
@NatttGeo @Mellecon Ironically, the only things there that taxes would be required for are fire fighting and police. And you can fund those via a voluntary tax such as a sales tax.

@ihate_everyone2 Ah
@ihate_everyone2 What's happening
@BrentCochran1 What's happening now?
@TheRogue_Elf With an extremely large field, that may ultimately happen. Democrats will have at least 20 major and 4 or 5 notable minor candidates. If she can get a plurality, she's going to win.
With Avenatti out, the list is down to about 40 candidates now... https://t.co/HOrlovfREf

@capeandcowell @StevenWC_ I disagree- death is too swift and painless...
@WGrrrl @AG_Conservative Yup.	Accords and deals are useless when the countries involved have no intention of actually following the rules, and the rules only hamper countries who need to be helped.
@WGrrrl @AG_Conservative I'm not talking about China- I'm talking about nations like Bolivia, Benin, Togo, Tonga, Timor-Leste, etc. Countries where they're trying to get off their feet and the economic situation makes the whole "Climate Change" thing almost impossible to do.
So... Bets on how long this Tweet stays up? https://t.co/L6e2xvKRfv
I'll say this on Bush's death:	An American hero, a patriot, and a man I hope to look up to in the future.	I'm honestly happy for him, despite what the family is going through, I know he's probably happy right now being able to hold his wife again.
@EdB_Ohio @libresister @AG_Conservative Well, that's kinda passed too TBF... lol
@AG_Conservative I'm trying to figure out how people are going to tell a developing nation "You have to stop doing what you're doing because of the climate changing" and expect the people there to actually care AND listen...
@EdB_Ohio @libresister @AG_Conservative Keep in mind, these are the same people who said the tax plans would kill people, net neutrality would kill people, etc.		Climate change ain't that far off from the whole "We're all gonna die!" thing being a part of major dialogue.
@EdB_Ohio @libresister @AG_Conservative No, it's becoming fairly common now sadly.
@SaintRPh I remember a story about a gal who gave her bf a bj at the Smallworld ride at Disney. You know, that place with a ton of small animatronic children singing mercilessly...		People will do it or jerk it anywhere...
@JohnEkdahl What'd he say?

@MarkBCooper84 He does- I just haven't updated it, and I'm too lazy to do so. I'll do it when he signs.

@JHolmsted I feel like there's an action for people to do in order to relieve sexual tension.
@JohnEkdahl I feel like 2020 is going to feature 30 candidates.		That's one damn big field...
#cf97 Updated with today's options. https://t.co/QgonL5IjSJ
@meninred97 Gutman will likely start, but if he goes down? That's likely why he's staying. Nothing more than depth.
@meninred97 With Vincent out, he's the only LB. Edwards will likely be more of an attacking player, too.
@SkywayWilly @JoelBiden No, 27 players at the start I think.
Expanding on this:	If Johnson gets his option declined, only one 1st rounder will be left with the club (Adams). #cf97 has drafted 25 players in the 1st round throughout it's history, and now only one will be left on the squad. https://t.co/T2XLSpfoo3
@LadyJessMacBeth I think you might bleed if it irritates your eyes enough that you constantly scratch at them.	Beyond that, nope.
@ChanceKev @JonnyCampbell16 No, he put it on his IG story
#cf97 more to come (ignore Indiana State University thing, I'm too lazy to fix that) https://t.co/VVDq8nW6iv
Sad news. @JonnyCampbell16 has had his option declined, as announced on his IG story.	Wish he would've had it picked up. #cf97
@APLMom Sad thing- Schatz is likely a VP candidate for an older and/or more moderate POTUS nominee. Swallwell is, of course, running and could be up for a Cabinet position and/or VP.

@FireTransfers Gah- sorry, I hate mistakes like that; I'd fix it but I'm just too damn lazy to do anything about it.
#cf97 Two (three) new updated lists:	-All current players	-Potential players (and a key for them featuring their current team)		Angeles, Las, &amp; Sierakowski are honestly "rounding it out" players; I wanted 8 total so they're included. BUT- I do somewhat think all three could join. https://t.co/pnI4iHf1NB
@colton_goza @JerryDunleavy @RobProvince Erm... You know what, I'm not even shocked.
@CaptYonah What's he on about now?
@JerryDunleavy @RobProvince What was he talking about?
@FireTransfers A USL side probably. He did ok there.
@FireTransfers Maybe he's being traded?
@NSHCoffee @GayPatriot @popup82 It better not be suing me. My lawyer is a platypus, so that about sums everything up about my chances.		Sue the banana industry; they're to blame somehow, right?
@BridgetPhetasy @GayPatriot And stop taking taxes...
@NSHCoffee @GayPatriot @popup82 Polar bears are dead, they're just all Coca Cola employees dressed like them to improve their sales campaigns.
@ihate_everyone2 Also- aren't these the same people saying we should accept potentially millions of refugees? If the world wasn't mean and nasty, they'd have no need to be refugees running from anything. There'd be no conflict for them to worry about...
@ihate_everyone2 Other noteworthy things done in other nations:	-Women are beaten, raped, and killed for things most American women do daily	-Religions are prosecuted if they don't fit the government's established one (or lack thereof)	-Slavery is still quite common in some parts of the world
@FireTransfers Erm, thanks but no thanks... Can we have the third kit from awhile back, or one of the other candidates for the third kit? https://t.co/1aM5FM3rTI
@FireTransfers @Anish20221020 See pinned tweet
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol Yeah, I see no way this can go wrong...
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol The US has been at war for almost all of it's history in one way or another. We REALLY need to stop and not get into another one with a damn super power that has over 2 million soldiers, nukes, and is the size of our country...
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol Imagine how many soldiers who's fathers fought in Vietnam would say "Let's go back to East Asia and fight a pointless war again for purely ideological reasons with little impact on our nation."
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol China's only potential change can come from themselves. The US getting involved would just do one thing: send our soldiers to die in a pointless war that likely ends up bringing about a much worse regime.
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol The US are the police of the world in his eyes. Sadly, this isn't an uncommon view...
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol Agreed (very few countries I'd disagree with on that). If China wants to screw themselves over, they can do it.
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol China definitely needs a change on top- but we definitely don't need to attack them... It'd be suicide, honestly, since they control most of our debt.
@ihate_everyone2 @BillKristol Who'd he say we should invade?
@ian_mckelvey That too.
@ian_mckelvey So let me see if I get this straight:	A man puts countless hours into starting, running, and growing a business, but because reason, he must share the wealth he earned himself against his will?		Erm... I feel like there's a term for that...
@ArthurBoreman @Emily30Red So this guy was trying to do something good, got killed, and he's the bad guy...
@FireTransfers @FCDallas I think Lindley was just, well, Lindley. He didn't want to sign, and that doesn't seem to be a view held by Gutman.		And yeah, it would definitely be awesome to have both on the left.
@FireTransfers @FCDallas Mix of a hunch and some evidence; he fills a very obvious need with Vincent out, plus he's been training with the Fire for awhile. It makes sense that they're going to try and get him to sign. And I don't think he's going to say no.
@FireTransfers @FCDallas On the bright side, I'd say it's very likely Gutman is joining. So... One bright spot to look forward to, ATM.
@FireTransfers @FCDallas Worth noting: I've found a link for Casillas, but nothing for Beto. I'm hoping that one isn't true, but it wouldn't shock me...
@FireTransfers @FCDallas See my latest tweets...
And here's an article too: #cf97	https://t.co/a0RRhNlZZs
#cf97 Potentially noteworthy news on the Casillas front...		But, Beto is 36 and not anywhere near a prime player. Ugh. https://t.co/byfXwckxcl
@FireTransfers @FCDallas It's gonna be a long offseason, I fear...
@ShirleyNoMates @TransfersMLS More likely Bastis, would fit more where Joao played than Kapp. He's 6'4" so LCB would make sense.

@Patriot_Musket @molratty This dude's running for President...
@PolitiBunny @aggierican Wonder how this affects his Presidential campaign.
@FireTransfers @ChanceKev The later part is likely regardless. If he ends up returning, the odds of him being exposed are pretty good (same as last year).
@Jiggly_333 @OwenGoal Sanchez makes about $132k, Polster makes about $124k. Ellis makes $150k at DC, and Adams makes $125k. Actually, none of them actually make less than him per MLS Players Union.
@ChanceKev Lucho is in the same boat as Movsisyan. Unlikely that he'll be in Fire colors next year.
@ChanceKev Kapp is most likely leaving, but MDL is still kinda up in the air. They have his option, and next year is the final one of his contract.
@FreedomRecon @TheRogue_Elf @TMIWITW Not well enough to have a lady friend, but yes.
@TheRogue_Elf @FreedomRecon @TMIWITW Dude... Go. Otherwise there's a great chance SHE'LL be the nutcracker...

@MarcACaputo Essentially, you're a Trump/GOP hack.
@unTayIored Idk. Honestly, this is confusing... I think neither did. If the first said yes and did it, he wouldn't have gone to the second. Ugh. I just got off work, I don't need more brain usage...
@unTayIored If you're going off the Biblical point, the second.
@FireNationCHI Vincent: seems like he wanted to try something else; I think Dax said he gave it a shot, didn't want to continue.	Dean: sadly, his injuries ended his career, and he just wasn't going to re-sign with anyone, too much of a risk.	Long story short- it wasn't the FO's fault this time.
@hboulware Three dumb arguments in favor of abortion.		I'd say how many more are there, but I think some would take that as a challenge...
@ScotsFyre @MatlockFletcher Southeasterners forced into political bullshit because of Democrats, unite!
@SaintRPh If any dude can do that, I'll be impressed. I'm not gonna watch them do it- but I'll be impressed.
@roachman61 @hboulware Comparing clipping nails to an abortion...		I think you've officially heard the dumbest argument. I don't think that comic comes close...
@roachman61 @hboulware Please tell me your professor was talking about removing the stone... For the love of all that is Holy... PLEASE tell me it was the stone, not the living baby she was talking about...
@EricVldw @hboulware ?
@hboulware The first time I saw this, I think said "What in the absolute fuck is this?!"		Of all the arguments... "A kidney stone is the same as a living organism..." IDK how dumber it can get...
@JustEric @hboulware TBF- this wasn't Democrats I think; it was an Irishman in support of that referendum back in April I think. Still... Wouldn't be shocking to see them make a similar comparison...
@WildWoodward @hboulware That's not my comic (I wouldn't dream of making such an idiotic comparison)- I'm pointing just out how dumb it is.
@xchixm @hboulware Here it is... https://t.co/Zdtmlmz3ka
