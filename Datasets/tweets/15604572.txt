@FairDistrictsPA  If you‚Äôre not working to give people power to control the legislature, you‚Äôre reinforcing the status quo. https://t.co/TBMObdAfDI
Again, we endorsed your movement, when it was about getting the power to draw the maps out of the hands of legislators.		If that power is off the table, as it is with Folmer, then you‚Äôll never have fair districts, you‚Äôll have transparent acts of gerrymandering.
So, the bill now gives away:	1) the independence of the commission	2) the power to decide the final map	3) specific recourse to the PA Supreme Court, the only remedy that has actually worked to produce fair districts, thus far.
‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù is a novel idea, but it means nothing without power. ‚ÄúPublic hearings‚Äù are just opportunities for expression without power.
@FairDistrictsPA: We were  w/you when it was about bringing the power to draw districts to the people. Folmer am. gives that power back to office holders.	This bill now leans heavily on the myth that public decisions are made in public for the public good. #SB22

Even the @PASenateGOP has recognized that the #PABudget requires recurring revenues, and has worked on some compromises.		But the @PAHouse GOP will drag the fight out well into the next fiscal year, damaging #PA's credit, and crushing the public's trust.
As we have seen in the past few #PABudget cycles, the @PAHouseGOP will STARVE the public programs our communities rely on: schools, healthcare, social services... While they reject compromise, draft gimmicks, and straight-up lie. All to extract public wealth for the very few.

Every time you hear the @PAGOP say there's a "spending problem," in the #PABudget, that really means they have don't believe in investing in the people of #PA. They care more about protecting the assets of their campaign contributors than the health and well being of our people.
#PABudget must increase funding to help families fighting just to get by in #PA.		#PABudget must invest in people and planet over profits for the few.
@SenScottWagner and his cohort of bought/paid-for candidates will tell you we live in a time of scarcity, so we have to cut the #PABudget. 		But we know the truth: they believe in scarcity for the many as they extract wealth for the very few.
The #PABudget says a lot about our priorities as a commonwealth, it‚Äôs time to invest in #PA communities, instead of extracting wealth for the investor class.
@PAGOP should stop using #PAbudget as a tool to extract wealth for the very few, and start building toward a #PA that works for all of us.
