Dr. James Anderson came home to MS in 1961.		Poor folks needed healthcare across the state. He built a mobile clinic in a bus.		Then LBJ sent $ &amp; Doc built permanent clinics.		Then the VRA passed &amp; he built a political machine to take over county govts to keep the clinics funded.
My son chose to draw Istanbul’s Blue Mosque for his first grade class.		I asked why.		He said “We all had to pick one of the buildings to draw and no one in my class wanted to draw a mosque.

A reporter pointed out last week that our campaign is one of only three for governor of Maryland to ever have garnered more than one million votes.		Sometimes coming in third in history only gets you second in the race.		Still, I deeply appreciate all who supported our campaign.
So @BernieSanders raised $4,000,000 from 330,000 donors in ONE day.  		That’s &gt; 2X the previous first day high.		At approximately $12 the average donation is &lt; 1/2 the famous $27 dollar average donation from 2016. 		Bernie is proving again you can go bigger w/ smaller donations.
RT @hardball: Bernie announces his 2020 run. @SusanPage, @JoeCrowleyNY, @BenJealous join #Hardball.
Long live the memory of Dr. James Anderson!		In Mississippi he was doctor to:	MLK, SNCC &amp; legions of organizers. 		He also built heath clinics throughout the Delta and a powerful political machine whose legacy continues.		Grateful to have known him well.		https://t.co/4OOKS5ME0x

@Mr_Ankrum As a dad with two kids in public schools, yes. Sometimes unarmed guards can help. As for armed ones? No. Never.
@zebraheadphones @CitizenApp What I do at my office is help build social impact businesses &amp; strong social entrepreneurs. I’ve been involved w/ Citizen for 3 years. Download it. You’ll see. It’s certainly no cure all. But it is a powerful tool and increases safety, accountability, and in time trust.
In short we have asked @CitizenApp to come to Baltimore because it gives us us a powerful, free tool to stay safe and help make our city stronger.		Please download it at the App Store or at GooglePlay.  		It will help keep you, your loved ones, and all of us safer.
He entered the subway with his mom &amp; was taken by a man wanted for child sex abuse. Police began a search in Brooklyn. In Manhattan, a Citizen user saw the child on the app &amp; recognized him in the man’s office. That user called police.  The 4 year old was reunited with his mom.
In October, a @CitizenApp user found this little boy who was missing And called the police. It turned out he had been taken by an accused sexual predator. https://t.co/9ZeWcjjnFa
The big surprise has been how @CitizenApp has helped neighbors find many missing persons. 		Last summer, a user found a 103-year old man reported missing in a wheelchair under a bridge where he could have easily died of exposure.
In fact, FDNY requires all their EMTs and firefighters to use it. 		ER nurses use Citizen like a radar for the ER room. 		Local media in NYC use Citizen to cover some public safety threat every day.
I have been involved with Citizen for the past 3 years. The app started in NYC. This is what I’ve seen &amp; heard from NYers:		Students use Citizen to stay safe on their way to school.		Parents use it to make sure their kids are safe. 		Teachers, EMTs, and employers love it.
.@CitizenApp let’s you take control of your safety in 3 ways:		1. It sends you alerts for ongoing incidents in your immediate vicinity.		2. When you are near an incident in the app you can livestream it to inform neighbors		3. You can also alert friends if you are ever in danger
Citizen is a new free app that sends real-time safety alerts directly to your phone.		Before Citizen, when a 911 call was made, only first responders got notified. The public, usually, did not understand what was going on.		Now, Citizen notifies everyone of impt. emergency calls.
Like everyone who lives and works in Baltimore, I would like to be safer. And I would like to have more tools to help make our city safer. 		That’s why I—and many of our neighbors—have asked @CitizenApp to open in Baltimore.
Some blame politicians. Some blame the police. Some blame the prosecutors. Some blame the judges. Some blame “all these young people with nothing better to do”. 		I am tired of the blame game. 		It doesn’t make us safer.
We must do all we can to make our beloved Baltimore safer.		2 days ago: Brunch. A friend frets over gunshots heard night before. 		Last Friday: Shooting at Douglass H.S.		2 weeks ago: A buddy calls. 3 staff carjacked. One @ 9am. One @ 10am. One @ 1pm. Right. Outside. His. Office.

When Northam finally steps down... this will be the first time a governor who has donned blackface... is replaced by a governor who is black.
Q: What’s worse?		That Northam knew he was in the photo but wanted us to believe that he couldn’t remember whether he put black shoe polish on his face or donned a Klan hood. 		OR		Now having said he was in the photo he wants us to believe we actually wasn’t. 		A: Just Quit.
Candor would have led him to tell us which one he was.  He failed. 		5/5
Courage would have motivated him during the years since, not to mention during his long tenure in public service, to come forward disclose the error of his ways and apologize. He failed. 	4/5
Character would have driven not to do this in the first place. He failed. 		3/5
Beyond the inherent racism reflected in his “Coonman” incident, he has shown a profound failure of character, courage and candor.		2/5
Governor Northam should resign. 		Period. 		We would not accept such behavior from a Republican. 		How can we from a Democrat? 	1/5
It is outrageous that an American President, even this one would address the nation during a govt shutdown and not mention one word of concern about our federal public employees whose families are suffering because they’ve not been paid in weeks.
He talks about a wall on the border. His real goal is to cut a deep divide through our nation.  Every politician who stays silent is his accomplice.
Just watched @realDonaldTrump talk about the border. What lies. What terribly racist lies.
Today marks another revolution around the sun for me and I’m feeling blessed! Proud to share this day with @RepCummings &amp; @MartinOMalley. Please join me in wishing a happy birthday to two good men from the great state of Maryland! https://t.co/rgVGEIuGjU
Today is the 20th day of the government shutdown. I am outraged on behalf of all the 800k employees, including those in Maryland, who are being unfairly left to bear the brunt and continue to work without pay. Americans deserve better. Time to end the shutdown.
Hope your year is off to a great start. I’m really excited about this new year and looking forward to being part of the change we want to see and need. We are all in this together.
Congrats to the most diverse new Congress ever! I’m excited for the change &amp; ideas from our new leadership; and let’s support Maryland’s own Rep. Cummings as he demands accountability from Pres. Trump and his administration.
Happy New Year! May this year bring joy, prosperity, and love for you, your family, and friends.
Wishing you all a healthy, happy, and peaceful holiday season and a happy new year. https://t.co/sNVc1KOvvd
Thank you all again from the bottom of my heart for all of your support. Words cannot describe enough how much your involvement mattered to me &amp; this movement. We’ve only just begun. 2019 is going to be even better. Looking forward to continuing this work together w/ all of you.

Our state needs to reflect the values we hold. 		I'm proud this week to have released two plans that will ensure Marylanders feel their government has their back, whether it's facing down discrimination at work or making their voices heard in Annapolis.		https://t.co/JCBTkJWu5H
It's time that we finally fully fund our schools, keep the broken promise on the casino money, raise teacher pay, and ensure that every Maryland kid gets the great education they deserve! https://t.co/SyoCREkldk

We will never stop working for the systemic change necessary to create a more just America and a more equal Maryland. November is coming and Maryland is ready to vote for that change.
Generations of Marylanders will be harmed by this new court's reckless conservative ideology. The people of our state and our nation will not forget who ignored their voices and refused to stand in opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, including Larry Hogan.
This new, more conservative court will put Roe v. Wade in jeopardy, further rig our economy in favor of the billionaires and giant corporations, strip away voting rights, and tear apart the ACA.
It was a clear repudiation of a country calling out for gender equality and cultural change.
Today is a deeply frustrating and unsettling moment in our nation's history – a day when the voices of tens of millions of Americans, and survivors of sexual assault, were ignored so that one party could further politicize the highest court in our land. 	https://t.co/O5bNTNrecn

We shouldn’t have to be a victim of sexual violence to understand it is an epidemic which must be addressed.		Every survivor deserves to know their claim will be taken seriously, and our leaders &amp; courts will treat them fairly.		I believe #ChristineBlaseyFord 		I #BelieveSurviors
To #BelieveSurviors is not to betray anyone. False accusations occur at similar rates with every crime. Yet sexual assault remains underreported... and in the case of #Kavanaugh the investigation was far from complete. 3/
I’ve said before, it will take men to end sexism, white people to end racism, and straight people to end homophobia.		We should all be outraged that partisan political games are taking priority over ethics, the wellbeing of the country, and the legitimacy of our Supreme Court. 2/
Today, the Senate GOP &amp; #Manchin sent a message to every sexual assault survivor that their voice - and their trauma - does not matter.		To victimizers that sexual misconduct is alright, as long as you don’t leave evidence.		To survivors that to report is to be victimized twice.

It took @LarryHogan two years to declare a state of emergency on the opioid epidemic despite spending months campaigning on this specific issue. Maryland needs a governor who will finally take on #BigPharma. https://t.co/wSRMF8DHps
.@LarryHogan’s campaign is funded by #BigPharma and mine is funded over 97% by individual donors committed to bringing down the cost of pharmaceutical drugs and end the opioid crisis. I’m the only candidate with a real plan to do so. #MDGovDebate  	https://t.co/vJWOa72msy
Despite his promises, data released by the Maryland Department of Health show that opioid deaths continue to spike under @LarryHogan. According to the data, fentanyl overdose deaths have increased by more than 750% and overall opioid overdose deaths have more than doubled. #MDGov
Yet Hogan failed to keep that promise for over two years, waiting until March 2017 to declare a state of emergency and take the crisis seriously. Thousands of Marylanders died in the meantime. #MDGovDebate
Before taking office as governor, @LarryHogan promised in no uncertain terms that he would immediately declare a state of emergency to fight the opioid crisis once he was sworn in. #MDGovDebate
The first plan I announced in my bid for governor was to take on the opioid epidemic and finally treat it as an public health emergency. #MDGovDebate 		https://t.co/TMYPjEmueC
.@LarryHogan says he never mocked a bump stock ban, but here are the facts (again) when Democrats introduced a bump stock ban, Hogan said "I don’t think anyone in the history of our state has ever been killed with a bump stock.” #MDGovDebate https://t.co/kz1wo2Gef5
My criminal justice reform plan works to invest in common sense crime-reduction programs and fix the correctional officers shortage which is why I'm supported by @AFSCMEMaryland. https://t.co/JJ1mF9Bun2
Even when we exclude Baltimore City, the other 23 counties have seen a 34% increase in murders while Hogan has been governor. That is unacceptable.
.@LarryHogan is the last person who should have credibility making claims about violent crime. Violent crime has increased by nearly 15% since 2014, including a 50% increase in murders.
Mass shootings have become far too ubiquitous. We need courageous leaders who can push forward faster to keep our families safe. I'm proud to be a @MomsDemand Gun Sense Candidate and to receive an F from the @NRA. https://t.co/O1KbksJ83v
.@LarryHogan just said "wages are up across the board", but what we know is  the average worker nationwide has taken home $5,300 in inflation-adjusted wage growth. In that same time, the average worker in Virginia has taken home $8,500; The average Maryland worker? $473. https://t.co/wS9Ke5LBGg
Let's fact check @LarryHogan's statements on the economy. 		Under Larry Hogan, Maryland is in the bottom of the region for job growth, while the nation created jobs 8 times faster and Virginia twice as fast as Maryland. #MDGOVdebate
For the past five years, I’ve worked as a venture capitalist investing in small businesses and helping them grow. I know that our state could do so much more to help struggling entrepreneurs, and I’ve put several plans on the table to do so. #MDGovDebate https://t.co/slBNYvPNT1

Yet Hogan failed to keep that promise for over two years, waiting until March 2017 to declare a state of emergency and take the crisis seriously. Thousands of Marylanders died in the meantime.
Before taking office as governor, @LarryHogan promised in no uncertain terms that he would immediately declare a state of emergency to fight the opioid crisis once he was sworn in.
Even when factoring out Baltimore City, the other 23 counties have seen a 34% increase in murders while Hogan has been governor. That is unacceptable.
.@LarryHogan is the last person who should have credibility making claims about violent crime. Violent crime has increased by nearly 15% since 2014, including a 50% increase in murders.
My criminal justice plan is about making families safer. I'm proud to have the support of @AFSCMEMaryland that represents thousands of correctional officers who have suffered under @LarryHogan's chronic disinvestment in public safety. See my full plan at https://t.co/3ivCF8hlEa
I'm proud to stand by the families, students, and parents who stand against the @NRA and stand for common-sense gun control. https://t.co/UiDghoMIS6
What the shootings at the @capgaznews and Great Mills made clear is that there is no excuse for taking money or support from the @NRA. @LarryHogan has taken THOUSANDS from the NRA for this cycle and had an A- rating from the NRA.
Here are the facts. https://t.co/a3GrOKF1wa
.@LarryHogan just said "wages are up across the board", but what we know is  the average worker nationwide has taken home $5,300 in inflation-adjusted wage growth. In that same time, the average worker in Virginia has taken home $8,500; The average Maryland worker? $473
Under Larry Hogan, Maryland is in the bottom of the region for job growth, while the nation created jobs 8 times faster and Virginia twice as fast as Maryland. #MDGOVdebate
Incredible supporters braving the rain to join @SusanWTurnbull at the debate site this morning! 		Thanks for representing this morning and showing what this movement of Marylanders from across our state looks like! https://t.co/nYNuIewh3V

Tonight is the debate between @LarryHogan &amp; myself. 		Education is the most important issue. 		And we have to set the record straight on why our schools have fallen in the rankings.		Why the promise on the casino money hasn’t been kept.		Why our teachers continue to be underpaid. https://t.co/V8iC88yD5t

How can we increase safety &amp; cut incarceration?		-Admit the “war on drugs” failed		-Focus on arresting killers, rapists, &amp; burglars		-Send addicts to rehab		-Help victims get counseling		-Ensure every inmate can read &amp; learn a trade		-Create. More. Jobs. https://t.co/881GrInC2L
Doing nothing has a cost. 		My opponent has proven that. 		Since he was elected:	—Our schools have fallen from 1st to 6th		—Healthcare premiums are up 130+%		—We are dead last in job &amp; income growth		Does he have a plan? No		Do we? Yes		See ours @ https://t.co/B2sEEpPtIh

A 13 year old white girl on the Eastern Shore told me she buried three classmates in 12 months who became addicted to pills.		A 8 year old black boy in Baltimore told me he had “seen too many dead men”.		We must be bold... and build a better Maryland for all our kids!
Big problems call for bold solutions.		Old white men are dying from suicide &amp; young black men are dying from homicide at sky high rates.		Opiates are devastating every community.		It’s time to come together across every line used to divide us &amp; build a better future for everyone.

My grandma helped train Barbara Mikulski. 		She also trained me. 		You know what she taught me?		“If you invest more on the front end, you pay less on the back end”		If you invest more in education, you pay less in incarceration. 		And schools always cost less than prisons! https://t.co/AjFE4QrYRl
