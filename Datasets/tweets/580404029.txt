@FoxNews @RonDeSantisFL Even if Trump is responsible for the good position of our economy it doesn't add up to the terrible things he's done in other areas of the presidency.
@WhstleBlower @JimY55140867 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump is your president yes but not your emperor and I'm within my right to oppose a politician I dislike. It would not be a lie for me to say that he spreads untruths daily.
@WhstleBlower @FoxNews Another point to be made is that I'm a Christian but even if I wasn't it is okay for people in this country not to be seeking out God.
@WhstleBlower @JimY55140867 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Unfounded, you must live in a conservative bubble with no contaminated "liberal" air.
@WhstleBlower @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Final point is Obama is not on an apology tour, I don't know maybe that is something @rushlimbaugh put in your ear.
@WhstleBlower @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Practically in this case suggests it happens often not every time. Citizens die under every president, Obama did get many people covered and I'm well aware it was not near as helpful as it should have been but he didn't leave millions uninsured in an instant.
@WhstleBlower @JimY55140867 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It is the case, you are a few clicks from figuring it out for yourself. The hypocrisy is that Obama went on a few vacations (much fewer) and there was outrage on the right.  He may not take a check but he does not foot the bill for his personal travel.
@WhstleBlower @FoxNews You say I'm deceived, but you are willfully deceived. Though there's no way I'm swaying your opinion so I shall just carry on.
@JimY55140867 @FoxNews Are you unaware that his vacationing has just about exceeded the cost of President Obama's entire 8 years? Fact check it I'll wait.

@Trumpssxruples @crk_flyer40 @BizarroMarx @ReaganBattalion Well I appreciate the correction.
@crk_flyer40 @BizarroMarx @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion You aren't wrong but that is no democracy. I'm talking about real democracies with some socialist ideals.
@BizarroMarx @crk_flyer40 @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion Yes we help them militarily it is no secret but to say that only we drive innovation is stupid.
@crk_flyer40 @Trumpssxruples @BizarroMarx @ReaganBattalion A flat tax is what I myself would like to see. I know the wealthy worked for it, I'm not wanting to take 91% of their money because that is just absurd.
@crk_flyer40 @BizarroMarx @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion I was expecting to see Venezuela in this debate eventually. Such a common talking point it gets old fast.
@BizarroMarx @crk_flyer40 @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion You make it sound like these countries are on their death throes. Many of them are very wealthy nations.
@BizarroMarx @crk_flyer40 @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion Borrowed time? You can't be serious.
@crk_flyer40 @Trumpssxruples @ReaganBattalion You make a fair point. I'm no financial expert I'll be frank about that but if other countries are achieving this why can't the greatest country in the world achieve it? Democracy infused with socialism works more often than not.
@ReaganBattalion Other developed countries have high taxes but they don't complain because the system works to everyone's advantage. Granted they are much smaller countries but it is possible I believe to pay for all these social programs through a higher tax rate across the board.

@ItsJesah I really wish that worldwide the esports industry was as well received as China and Korea. People eat breathe and sleep esports there.
@ItsJesah In the US I've already seen it on TV. I guess it has taken longer for Australia to receive it. But honestly I love watching it online because you can't see others reactions watching an event on TV. If TV producers found a way to have some sort of live reaction that would be cool.
