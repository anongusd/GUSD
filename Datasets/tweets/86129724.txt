This Bolton clip is revealing: https://t.co/eAqjQURqie
At the highest level of the party, the presidency, the GOP is led by a personality-driven, self-described nationalist who has engaged with autocrats and lashed out at global institutions. Yet at all other levels, the party is mostly a cast of bewildered and often quiet hawks...
that even the people he has hired to be his spokespeople on these issues (Bolton, Pompeo, Haley, Tillerson, etc.) frequently struggle to defend his nationalist &amp; spontaneous approach or illuminate it for the public or the global community. Or, they even distance themselves...
Bolton TV hits today underscore a reality for POTUS since Day 1. His worldview and foreign-policy style (stewing together militaristic rhetoric, noninterventionist "American first" instincts, personality-driven diplomacy, and a lack of focus on human rights) is so unorthodox...
This issue is a test of Sen. Paul's commitment to his beliefs. He has long argued against overreach by exec branch, but has also become a friend of Trump.		Pres. Trump has warned Senate Rs to not break with him. Will watch to see if Paul pays a price.	https://t.co/b7f6ei5zVb

Notable that Trump took time to address the increasingly vigorous Left in American politics, which was led in '18 by @AOC and others, and stoked by Sanders in '16. A look ahead, perhaps, to political battles to come as business-friendly leaders in both parties face challenges.
Trump knocks socialism, as Sen. Sanders sits and looks ahead with a cool stare
Trump will meet w/ Kim Jong Un on Feb. 27 in Vietnam
Interesting that Pres. Trump calls out El Paso... hometown of one of his possible 2020 challengers, @BetoORourke
This speech started as Buzz Aldrin, "U-S-A! U-S-A!"	A few nods toward bipartisanship. 	Now, it has echoes of "American carnage." 	This is a president looking at divided gov't and saying....	I'm not changing.
RT @maggieNYT: Worth remembering any time anyone pretends Miller or Bannon or anyone else is pulling the strings here - as well as anytime…
If you're looking for a presidential pivot, recall that this tone and language on immigration is exactly what President Trump sounded like when he first launched his bid in 2015, almost four years ago. 		That was before Miller, before Bannon.		This is who he is.
Democrats groan as the president talks about the caravan. Speaker Pelosi glances over at them with an agreeing look but briefly raises her hand to keep order.
Here comes the Stephen Miller section. I'm reading the text of the speech and it's... very Stephen Miller/Sessions/Bannon-esque.
Speaker Pelosi is looking at her copy of the speech in the same way a longtime teacher looks at late homework.
The cheers and big smiles on the GOP side are a reminder that even with the Senate GOP rebukes and various frustrations, the Republican Party is still very much the party of Trump.

Statement from Jay Sekulow, Counsel to the President: “The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress.”
Giuliani declined to discuss the indictment's mention of a Trump campaign official being directed to contact Stone and said he wanted to "go back and read that again, and then get back to you."
Giuliani added, “They do have some alleged false statements and I don’t want to minimize that. That’s not right, you shouldn’t do that. But there is no evidence of anything else but false statements. The president is safe here."
“Another false statement case? God almighty,” Giuliani tells WashPost, when asked about what the indictment reveals about the Mueller probe. “I thought they were taking all this time with Stone to try to develop something on him, not to have a lot about ‘I don’t remember this.'"
Giuliani on phone with @washingtonpost... asked if he's spoken to POTUS. Giuliani has. Won't describe president's reaction, other than to say the president is not nervous about the Stone indictment.
Several vets of TrumpWorld, who know Stone, have a contrarian view of today's news, based on some calls this AM. One called it Stone's 'best day" even, calling him a "martyr from the Mueller probe." If he doesn't go to prison, "will go on tour." Others, of course, are dispirited.

VP Pence to @HallieJackson this morn re: POTUS/declaring a national emergency so he can start building a border wall without congressional approval: “It’s something that he’s looking at and considering”
7 a.m. ET @Morning_Joe
6. While VP Pence's pitch today signaled the admin's possible action, so did voices on right who have POTUS's ear. Trump confidant Sean Hannity said, “I’m guessing he’s going to declare a national emergency." https://t.co/9PJ7imlAei
5. The only caveat to all of this is that WH knows GOP holding together is critical. That's why POTUS and VP are phoning mbrs. That's in part why there is a speech to nation and trip to border. Direct msg to skittish Rs that this is the line, this is a crisis, so hold on tight.
4. My top Trump admin sources say they see little downside to going "all out" now on the wall. Rallies their voters, tests Dems' mettle, and gives POTUS a chance to be seen as fighting on his signature issue ahead of a likely rough year of probes and battles w/ House Dems
3. Instead of trying to negotiate to reopen the gov't with a wall-less bill, the admin spent Monday continuing to make its case of a border crisis to reporters and need for $5.7B. VP and @SecNielsen briefed. Laying foundation ahead of POTUS's Tues. speech to nation.
2. POTUS, encouraged by friends on right, increasingly sees a nat'l emergency declaration as a way to rattle empowered Dems and show his core voters he's going to the brink for wall
Pay close attention to what this administration is doing... 		1. Weekend talks with Democrats were futile. Dems there frustrated that Rs didn't have budget numbers ready and OMB had to rush to compile them. Mtgs. instead focused on admin's bleak presentation on border situation

Last thought.. A contrarian view from John Brabender, a Pence ally. He says shutdown is partly theater &amp; Trump could still move to center.		“It’s de facto playing to the base so he can get it done and move on. He can’t get reelected with only his base but he needs the symbolism."
Steve Moore, who's a Powell critic and friend of many in WH, told me he expects Fed knocks to continue into 2019. A base play of sorts: “Most blue-collar workers don’t pay attn to the Fed, but they get that Trump is fighting for them and trying to get them a bigger paycheck.”
A few tidbits from notebook... Gingrich said he respects Mattis but Trump is doing the right thing to get the Cabinet more in line with the president's own worldview. Expects more of this + says Trump's FP moves reveal a new assertiveness on policy even as process is criticized.
They also said the shutdown has been instructive and revealing. You don't see Trump huddling with Ryan or McConnell. It's a tight inner circle (Pence, Kushner, etc.) and his own reactive navigation of the political minefield he faces... wants to rally base ahead of tough year
During the course of reporting my latest story, WH officials + top Trump aides described Trump as deliberately playing to the base but also unbound from both convention &amp; party. After 2 year run w/ GOP control, said focus is on core voters &amp; core instincts, not moving to center.

At this point, most senior Democrats tell me that they have Trump on the ropes. They said he owns the shutdown and he doesn’t have leverage. They feel he’s so keen to get wall so his base sticks with him. No wall, weakened Trump, in their view.  https://t.co/HuSIzBhFzI
All that said, both Dems AND Rs working on this privately acknowledge that the major question isn't "what will Schumer do?" but "what would Trump accept and sign?" And no one is really sure. They just know he wants to fight, rally his base.
The reason why it can't be $2.1B? Per plugged-in Dems, Schumer's hands are tied. He feels he's already out on a limb with the Left with $1.6B offer for border security for a POTUS loathed by base and WH is mistaken to think brinkmanship will somehow change the political reality

Takeaway of Trump's remarks so far: flippant, brutal even, toward Republicans who broke with him, and offering a few vague overtures to Pelosi and Dems. 		"The Democrats will come to us with a plan" on infrastructure, etc., "and we'll negotiate."

Trump is now musing about Oprah Winfrey, who he says may not like him that much. He shrugs a bit, then keeps talking.

“There are those who are surprised by my candor, in part b/c we haven’t seen a	statewide candidate who is as aggressive... But I also hear a lot of quiet ‘thank yous,’ ... it is a good thing, in their mind, to have someone saying these things.” Abrams to me, mo's ago, on GA Dems
@NPRinskeep Most Dems across the country feel most vulnerable on the tax issue, but that hasn't stopped them from focusing on health care and other pillar Dem issues in the closing swing... most Dems also *not* running as "big gov" Dems. It's more "I'll protect you and your coverage/rights."
Over recent months, Abrams's campaign has been part of a broader movement of similar Dem contenders who have eschewed milquetoast moderate appeals in the South (Gillum, Beto, etc.)... Tuesday is a test for all, and that approach. Will have implications for 2020 across the board.
Abrams was paying close attn to the political winds. Ossoff had lost the special and Doug Jones had just won in Alabama. “Jon wasn’t able to boost turnout in areas that I think we can," she said. Stoking prog turnout + demographic changes + Trump, to her, = a fighting chance.
Sitting at The Pullman in ATL, Abrams (over an iced tea) said moving twd the center "hasn’t worked in Georgia in the last few decades," so now was the time to "build a coalition of voters with white progressives" plus "communities of color," with black, Latino, and Asian voters.

Why Miller continues to matter, even as he avoids spotlight: He has access to Trump and stokes him on immigration. CoS Kelly is mostly non-ideological and as former DHS head, shares hawkish instincts on border. Sec. Nielsen isn't countering Miller, either. He has lots of runway.

What Trump did tonight is finally finish the rhetorical journey. He acknowledged what he's been the whole time: a nationalist, one of many in the world. He frames politics in transactional and deeply nationalistic terms, focused on perceived threats to his concept of the nation.
But it became clear over time that Trump's aversion to "nationalism" and "populism" wasn't an aversion to those *ideas* and what fueled them, but to the *people* associated w/ them. Identity-wise, he didn't want to be see as a Bannonite, a Buchananite, or part of a movement.
Trump used to wave me off in 2015-16 whenever I'd bring up the term "nationalism" or "populism." He hated them. Told me Trump the brand was bigger than those words and about "common sense." Never wanted to talk ideology... see this Aug. 2015 intvw, for ex. https://t.co/XxqPpuEXNl

Sen. Paul and Sen. Graham are known as the president's friends, golfing buddies, allies.		But they aren't top of mind right now at WH.		Sources there elated about Sen. Collins. A woman from Maine, closing the case on nat'l TV, weeks ahead of midterms.
Sen. Collins: "Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Thank you, Mr. President." 		Republicans applaud in the chamber.
Here we go... Sen. Collins now turning to the allegations. 		"I cannot abandon them" she says about her beliefs in "presumption of innocence" and "fairness."		"We must always remember that is when passions are most inflamed, that fairness is most in jeopardy."
Unless this Collins speech takes a strong turn, some kind of M. Night-level twist, it's hard to see how she votes "no." Line after line is a defense of Kavanaugh's record.

Even w/ Murkowski on board with Flake, McConnell could still bring it to a floor vote. He has that option, could see how they react. But Mitch M. is not a big risk taker. The kind of guy who knows answers to every Q he asks. So, the vote looks to be delayed, pending probe.
RT @LACaldwellDC: NEWS: Murkowski, entering the Capitol “on the way to talk to her colleagues,” said she supports @JeffFlake proposal for a…
The possible week delay adds the variable of the president's fury with Flake and the stalled process. Whatever Trump says/does could complicate the fragile whip count. “Somebody has got to explain this to Trump, I guess that will be my job!” Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters.
Flake is a complicated figure. His friends say he's trying to protect GOP and the Court by making sure the FBI box is checked, and they think if Kavanaugh emerges fine from that, he may even win over some red state Ds.. but other Rs argue Flake knows he's all but dooming the nom
Now, McConnell has to figure out whether he can somehow get Collins and Murkowski to agree to a vote soon. But top sources say that's unlikely. So the next week becomes another pressure cooker as both sides debate/bicker over the scope over whatever steps are taken by the FBI.
(thread) We're watching history unfold, in a raw and urgent way. A retiring Republican senator dramatically changes the trajectory of a Supreme Court nomination as his sometime foil/POTUS looks on from 1600. A majority leader instantly cornered and facing the Q: plow fwd or not?

CORKER in intvw w/ WashPost just now: “I have very warm feelings about Judge Kavanaugh as we move to this hearing... And, like I would guess at least half of our caucus is doing, I am going to be watching every word of the hearing in order to make a final determination.”

Spoke to more than a dozen House Rs here at the Capitol. Very few had any criticism of the president's handling of the coming storm or his tweets on P.R. Most offered hearty praise. A revealing snapshot of the GOP.

McGahn, at times, has gone for days if not weeks of not engaging at length w/ POTUS. Clashes over Russia probe / DOJ left him burned, but still there.  He and Trump actually enjoy each other's company (unlike many admin officials who rarely click w/ Trump), but damage was done.
So, when Grassley and others express sadness, it's because a chaotic DC and a chaotic GOP are losing a conventional and trusty legal hand who helped keep Congress and WH united on at least one core issue, all while surviving Trump's moments of rage or pique. A rare skill.  /end
McGahn's goals and McConnell's goals and ideologies intertwined. Both wanted to get judges confirmed and feed Trump the successes he craves. And both wanted judicial confirmations to bolster their reps/legacies--McGahn's among DC lawyer community, McConnell for history books.
As McGahn's relationship with Trump has frayed, it has strengthened with GOP on Hill. They couldn't stand Bannon's theatrics and found others in WH tone deaf politically or disengaged. McGahn shared their conservative agenda, spoke their language. McConnell has kept him close.
The NYT story that highlighted McGahn's hours of interviews with Mueller was seen by McGahn and his friends as a problem--not the fact that he sat with Mueller, but how Trump would react. The headline is reality for POTUS. "Beginning of the end," as one McGahn ally put it to me.
McGahn takes immense pride on judicial work &amp; has increasingly devoted his energies there + to lower profile reg work. Avoids Russia convos like the plague inside and outside WH. Has fully cooperated with Mueller but groused repeatedly about Cobb/Dowd decision to have him do so.
Flood is widely seen as likely replacement and was personally recruited by McGahn to join the WH back in the spring. Flood has built a rapport w/ POTUS, to McGahn's relief. But no decision finalized yet. Flood knows impeachment, shares McGahn worldview on exec priv.

RT @AP: BREAKING: New York state investigators have issued a subpoena to Michael Cohen as part of Trump Foundation probe.
Giuliani adds that Trump legal team is looking into its options re Cohen tapes and whether they can release audio of some of his conversations with reporters about the payment since they believe they can use Cohen’s own words to counter his latest claims.
Giuliani, calling Post from golf course in Scotland, says he has spoken with POTUS today and deliberated over what it all means—Manafort, Cohen, etc. Says, optimistically, they believe Mueller “might be at the end now. He has to be winding down. What else is there? Near the end.”

The exit of a WH speechwriter linked to a white nationalist event comes as the GOP is all but silent on race. https://t.co/zQvwECVCnm
Based on my reporting today, there is a mix of reactions inside West Wing &amp; Trump circle. Some close to POTUS said Beattie had to go as CNN made an inquiry or else risk white nationalist headlines. Others tell me Beattie didn't deserve to be let go simply b/c he was on a panel.
NEWS: WH speechwriter Darren Beattie resisted push for him to resign amid scrutiny of panel alongside white nationalist, per 3 people familiar. WH then fired him. Departure first reported by @KFILE. 	https://t.co/PFLukwV3qd
And who else, if anyone, in the Trump administration has associated with Peter Brimelow in last 2 years? If a 2016 panel with Brimelow is a bridge too far for this speechwriter, Beattie, then it's worth asking if Brimelow has had meetings or chats w/ others in the admin.
This story raises many questions. What kind of vetting is being done of staffers in terms of links to extreme events/groups? How did Kelly and POTUS respond when told of this development?
Beattie is essentially unknown by the public. But the Duke academic worked w/ Vince Haley and in part with Miller, who oversees policy and speechwriting. He made $84,000 a year (https://t.co/7yrT0ToAgy). This was not some intern.
Thread: This story is worthy of more attention. A future WH aide, Darren Beattie, appeared on a panel w/ Peter Brimelow in 2016 and is now gone from the West Wing. Yet this isn't reported until Aug. 2018. Brimelow is a well-known white nationalist, as described by SPLC &amp; others.

But the GOP is transformed. Ayers works for Trump. Bachmann is gone, but her right-wing immigration views (her best pal in House was Steve King) dominate the party. 		Pawlenty may feel burned tonight, but it's just a version of what he went thru in 2011. And the fire rages. /end
Pawlenty's comeback bid in MN was encouraged by GOP leaders and donors because it looked like not only a way to win the governor's mansion, but a way to reassure themselves that someone like him could still be a player. Mild-mannered, Sam's Club pitch but loved by C-Suite types.
What Trump saw, and Bachmann saw, and Santorum saw, to an extent, was that in the modern GOP, being a "Sam's Club Republican" is not enough. You cannot respond to economic anxieties with a policy program. Voters want visceral political campaigns, solidarity in grievance.
A few years later, sitting on a plane with Trump, I bring up Santorum and Pawlenty, and the flashes of populism in the party from 2012 cycle. Trump quickly dismisses the conversation and calls his brand of politics "common sense," not some ideological project.
Pawlenty, of course, goes on to drop out. Bachmann wins the Ames straw poll that summer but eventually fades. Months later, Rick Santorum, back from political winter, takes up many working-class talking points that are similar to T-Paw's and gives Romney a real race.
Pawlenty details his whole plan, his path to the nom. Sounds doable. Yet his delivery and his presentation are mild. It's the opposite style of Bachmann, who is roaring anti-establishment. And it's the opposite of a birtherism advocate from NYC making headlines at the time.
Pawlenty is confident but skittish about the rise of Bachmann. He's preaching his own version of populism (https://t.co/vgriGuk5bt), "Sam's Club conservatism" that's embraced by Brooks and Salam and Douthat. He tells us that's the GOP future: winning over the working class.
A scene immediately comes to mind tonight as MN GOV primary results roll in, with Pawlenty finished. The scene: spring 2011. Pawlenty a GOP WH favorite. Nick Ayers, the wunderkind, on board. Donors mostly going to Romney, but many like TPaw. He meets with me and a few reporters.

Davis said Cohen would not be speaking publicly in the coming days to offer any additional information about his relationship with David Pecker, when asked tonight about Cohen and Pecker by the WashPost
When asked if the Cohen team would release more recordings of Trump in the coming weeks, Davis said he would not comment on that but acknowledged “there are a lot of other tapes.”
Lanny Davis to Wash Post: “At some point, after listening to Giuliani, it became necessary to rebut false statements. We were not going to let Michael become a punching bag.”
On phone w/ Lanny Davis. Cohen decided, working with Davis, to release the tape “following extensive discussions” with his lawyers about the timing and consequence of doing so, Davis says. “Quite a discussion, I can say that.”

KAVANAUGH continues to rise in the SCOTUS search process, even as some Rs gripe about various rulings, Bush ties. He met privately with VP Pence on Wed. at the VP residence, per 2 Rs briefed on the mtg. And that meeting went well, they said.
One day before he resigned, Scott Pruitt showed up at the White House for the July 4 party and fireworks. https://t.co/MQAyNL1zbO
Scott Pruitt steps down as EPA head after ethics, management scandals https://t.co/gg7el36jXi
LANNY DAVIS statement: “As an attorney, I have talked to Michael many times in the last two weeks. Then I read his words published on July 2, and I recognized his sincerity.  Michael Cohen deserves to tell his side of the story - subject, of course, to the advice of counsel.”
Former Virginia AG Ken Cuccinelli, who’s tight w/ national con. leaders, tells me Kavaugh “looks, walks, and quacks like John Roberts… the Bush lives loudly in Kavanaugh”
RT @maggieNYT: NEWS -  @LannyDavis, the Clinton-era White House official, tells me he's been retained by @MichaelCohen212 as he prepares fo…
Wash Post obtained the statement, which has not yet been released publicly, this afternoon. Signatures still being collected by conservative organizers... notable to see Paul on it, since he spoke w/ POTUS earlier this week. He has concerns about Kavanaugh, per associates
SCOTUS news: Sen. Rand Paul and his top adviser Doug Stafford have signed a statement urging POTUS to pick Sen. Lee. Former Sen. DeMint has signed the letter as well, among other conservatives, coordinated in part by FreedomWorks
WH officials tells me Kelly rarely goes to rallies, but is on the plane to Montana as Pruitt news unfolds. Says Kelly has been key in the long exit of the EPA administrator. Never a big fan.
The tide had fully turned against Pruitt even among House Rs who know him well. Earlier today, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told me Pruitt was "beyond the pale" in his various missteps, but was going to leave the decision to Trump.
Interesting timing re: Pruitt. Just days ago, some WH officials had told me POTUS was maybe going to hold off on any move until after SCOTUS announcement
BREAKING NEWS... 	https://t.co/K5HYZ9MriZ
Chief of staff Kelly and new deputy chief Bill Shine are traveling with the president today, per Trump official

When I asked a prominent Trump ally about Sen. Lee / SCOTUS, they said this article is floating around the WH, as evidence that he's a long shot. https://t.co/Qdt2kuWZyr
Announcement still planned for Monday, but WH sources say the president could certainly tease something at his rally tonight or on Twitter in the coming days. Monday's certainly still the plan, but don't bet it all on Monday, they say
Where things stand: Kavanaugh remains the leading candidate... but he's also facing intense scrutiny https://t.co/UysDGzkuQ6
Something to pay attn to: Right wing criticism of Kavanaugh (not conservative enough on health care, abortion dissents) isn't seen as a big prob by some Trump confidants. Why? That same criticism could reassure Collins, Murkowski about Kavanaugh.
Don't count out Coney Barrett. But there is a sense among some Trump associates that she could be this round's Hardiman. A runner up, seen as a future SCOTUS pick in years to come.
POTUS also asking his broader circle about Kethledge, but pretty generally. "You know him?" Trying to gauge what his rep is. Still learning about him. But having *not* worked in Bush WH is in Keth's favor, sources say
POTUS was asking friends and associates about Kavanaugh on July 4. Asking about him generally and about his Bush ties, per multiple people familiar with his convos at WH festivities
back on the SCOTUS search beat today. The top 3 contenders as of 9:30 a.m., per GOP and WH sources: Kavanaugh, Kethledge, Coney Barrett

not surprising, but finalists for SCOTUS have been given paperwork (background, finances) this week from the WH to fill out. person directly involved tells me process is moving "fast" and WH wants as much info, ASAP, from the short list
From Feb. 2018: WH counsel Don McGahn participates in Judge Coney Barrett's investiture event at Notre Dame Law School. Which key red state Democrat lives close to Notre Dame and went there, too? Sen. Joe Donnelly. https://t.co/QwDK55ynGV
Sen. Todd Young is a big booster of Judge Coney Barrett. Would likely play an informal "sherpa" or key supporter role on Cap Hill, should she be nominated, per people involved in talks
Another point: Kavanaugh has a lot of support internally at WH and in GOP. But the Bush connection hovers over his chances. POTUS mulling that. Still, he’s seen as ready for a confirmation battle and mostly acceptable to all key blocs, tho Sen Paul and others have concerns.
Couple points from a source breakfast this AM: POTUS liked Kethledge, who has written a book on leadership and solitude, beyond his judicial work. One of the people profiled in that book? Mattis. Who’s having lunch today with POTUS? Mattis.

Political map for SCOTUS fight could soon expand... adviser to Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative nonprofit that spent more than $10m to boost Gorsuch, tells Post that the group is now considering pressure campaigns against Sens. McCaskill and B. Nelson
What are Paul's concerns? Friends of his tell me it's Kav's decisions on health care/ACA constitutionality + his work in W.'s White House. Paul World so far has been mum about all of this.
something to watch: Sen. Rand Paul has some reservations about Kavanaugh, per a few of his friends plus a WH aide. He has voiced these privately in recent days, but not publicly, the people said. Waiting to see what POTUS does... Paul was unavail for comment.
bit of news: WH counsel Don McGahn spoke w/ Sen. Mike Lee last Thursday, per several ppl fam with the call. Described as friendly, talking thru SCOTUS process and POTUS outlook. Lee has said he's open to it, but not seen as a front-runner. WH and Lee office declined comment.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh is at or near top of SCOTUS list, per several people close to President Trump. But oppo research for possible hearings already moving fast.
