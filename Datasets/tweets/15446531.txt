@AdamSerwer @conor64 And I’m saying that before I opine on Yet Another Campus Controversy I’d like to see coverage that’s a little clearer on what exactly is happening.
@AdamSerwer @conor64 I’m a little unclear on the factual background here — is this just a case of Weinstein offered him a lot of money so he took the job or is there some bigger argument he’s advancing in this case?
@MattBruenig This obviously doesn’t *need* to be a starkly polarized debate and most people probably fall somewhere between either of two stylized poles, but I think there’s a meaningful argument along this axis of debate.
tl;dr one side sees the impulse to praise representational gains as a means of bolstering the legitimacy of an unjust system, while the other side sees the impulse to deride those gains as reflecting an indifference to real and important forms of injustice

Of course on some level you can easily say “both” but tensions around this issue arise over and over again, and it obviously manifests in the specific question of whether electing a woman is a very important statement or electing Bernie Sanders is a very important statement.
This is the thing Bernie and the liberal identitarians are disagreeing about without quite joining the argument squarely — is it a big problem that corporate executives and directors are so overwhelmingly white and male or is the problem really just that they’re rich? https://t.co/1j1WJuNP2n

A much more fair critique of the Green New Deal is not that you *can’t* substantially improve transit in the USA it’s that on this subject (and many others) the GND doesn’t really have much of substance to say.
And of course New York, like every large American city, could improve its bus service with proof-of-payment fare collection, rationalized routes, some dedicated bus lanes, etc.
It would really not be that hard for NYC to improve circumferential transit (which is what you’d need to go between the two slices of AOC’s district) if doing so was a political priority. https://t.co/SsIxPmQctY

But instead it is very frequently *the exact same people* who argue that political correctness is out of control who are throwing the first stone when someone steps out of line on Israel.
I wish Jewish people who are on the center or right politically and are very bothered by this sort of thing would try harder to engage sympathetically with speech-policing efforts that don’t speak as directly to their personal concerns.
My take is that though people sometimes take it too far the “PC” impulse is mostly good, its critics mostly wrong, and it’s reasonable for Jewish people to want Israel to be discussed in a way that bends over backward to cater to their sensitivities about anti-Semitism.
I would like everyone to try to develop internally coherent thinking about whether “politically correct” speech-policing is a huge problem and whether Ilhan Omar’s strident rhetoric about Israel needs to be policed more stringently.

tl;dr Communism is a bad economic system, but in narrow culture war terms the problem with the Soviet command economy is it encouraged *too much* beef consumption not too little.
This reflected a too-low fixed price of beef, which also led to systematic beef shortage in Soviet markets despite the actual quantity of beef being produced and consumed being relatively high.
The main upshot of this paper is that due to the absence of market prices, the ratio of beef to milk consumed in the USSR was way out of whack with tons of dairy simply going to waste rather than being consumed in any form.
Here, per a USDA-commissioned study I found.		In the early eighties, the Soviets were eating less beef than Americans but more than most Europeans.		https://t.co/oUyUlBbIWM https://t.co/aIheTTSPk0

My recollection (and yours may differ) is that it did not — that in fact McCain was routinely held up as an example of an unusually honor-bound and widely respected politician.

It’s especially perverse because everything related to the Stormy Daniels payoff is pretty well-documented at this point and doesn’t especially hinge on Cohen being an honest person.
Cohen has implicated Trump in a specific violation of campaign finance law, but knocked down a key Steele Dossier claim and purported to debunk charges about a love child and domestic violence — not sure it makes sense on net for Republicans to attack his credibility so much.
If Republicans approached this hearing with a more open mind they might have noticed that Cohen is actually defending Trump from a number of charges.

To understand the historically contingent process through which academic disciplines are categorized, however, would require a social science background which I definitely lack.
I learned to do logic as a philosophy major, which I guess is humanities, but both of the logic courses I took were cross-listed in math so actually it’s STEM.

We have started to see some signs that Democrats are coming around to the view that Republicans were right about this — which in any other context would be seen as a form of Democrats moving toward the center.
Deficit-financed Medicare expansion was the centerpiece of George W. Bush’s health care policy.
The Kemp-Roth tax cut was almost 40 years ago!
It’s strange to me how often I see the idea that deficits don’t matter framed as a new idea on the left rather than the longstanding cornerstone of Republican Party economic policy.
Even among Democrats, climate change takes a back seat to health care, education, and the needs of the poor as a priority. https://t.co/eeegE7vq2T
There is an elite perception that climate change is a potential crossover issue and linking it to health care etc. alienates potential center-right supporters, but the mass opinion landscape is very different.

This is not particularly new (IIRC Rorty was writing about it decades ago) but Twitter as a medium has really brought it to full flower.

The significance of all these Senator-candidates saying they don’t want to eliminate filibusters is that *they will be senators no matter who becomes president* and it’s the senate that decides on this.

There are competing “Bernie’s ideas are dangerous” and “Bernie’s ideas are unrealistic” out there from center-left people. 		To me it seems like the second criticism is right and because it’s right the first one is wrong.

Paris is not, I think, actually spending less money on transit projects than New York. 		Rather with their more cost-effective construction it makes sense to tackle more projects and build a lot of stuff.
The MTA says it needs $6 billion to extend the Second Avenue Subway from 96th Street to 125th Street (a bit under 3km) and that we need to understand that NYC is an old and densely populated city.
RER E extension project fearing an 8km tunnel through Paris plus 47km on track upgrades west of La Défense  is coming in at 3.8 billion euros. 		https://t.co/d4YHSvTcSK

In regional economic development, as in the NBA, an influx of skilled immigrant workers is the key to reversing decline in post-industrial cities.
I’m really enjoying the Bucks bandwagon.
It seems unlikely that many people will base their primary votes on foreign policy, but the range of views on national security issues within each party is wider and the institutional constraints on the president are less restrictive.

It’s fascinating to me that many people who personally lived through the riots and domestic terrorism of 1968-1980 describe the political landscape of *today* as scary, chaotic, and full of crazy extremists.

Consequently something like Warren’s plan to use a wealth tax to finance universal child care or Booker’s plan to use estate taxes for baby bonds both helps the vast majority of white families while *also* narrowing racial economic gaps.
In fact I believe Robert Smith at #470 is both the only African-American on the Bloomberg list of the world’s 500 richest people.
I think the extent to which taxing the rich to finance Almost Anything You Want for All serves to narrow racial gaps is underrated. 		Very few African-Americans on the billionaires lists and none near the top.

Similarly, an executive officeholder can at least partially undermine a social service program's efficacy through inattention or maladministration but it's generally impossible to conjure an effective one up from scratch.
There are a lot of asymmetries in the political system and it is, for example, a lot easier to unilaterally refrain from vigorously enforcing the rules on the books than it is to call tough new rules into being.
