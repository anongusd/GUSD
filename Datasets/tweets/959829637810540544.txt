@TomiLahren Wow, what a heartfelt message. All alone again this year too, huh?  Don’t worry we will still pray for you.
@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Looks who talking there Olive Oyl!!! https://t.co/7KrRr8fFA0
@charliekirk11 Why don’t you support vigorous back ground checks on gun purchasing?  Those senseless murders of police officers would be tremendously reduced or eliminated altogether, period!
@clovis1931 @JulieReichwein1 @AOL We need to start censuring Democrats and the mainstream media.  We need to pass a law that would make it illegal for Democrats/MSM from speaking against border security.

@RealJamesWoods @FBI Seems a lot perverted you found some article about a drag kid.  Where you searching the Internet? You actually have that “sexual predator” look about you.
@NancyJKoch @TeaBoots @pelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS Nice teeth Nancy!!! https://t.co/JvtMmshGat
@DanCrenshawTX Actually that is something for YOU to think about.  While it pains me to say this, Republicans have f.. up and allowed the Dems to have the upper hand here.  @realDonaldTrump took ownership. Almost a million fed workers are not being paid and the majority are blaming Republicans
@RyanAFournier Hahahahahahhaa!! https://t.co/mLi3j8REO5
@Tweets4MAGA So your argument is that only legal residents and US citizens follow the law and never cause automobile accidents? I offer my sincere condolences, but to link this incident to a “border wall” is preposterous!  Using your son’s death this way is disgusting. https://t.co/fqrgIikP0S

@RyanAFournier What is he willing to compromise?  Do tell?
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They are neither striking or boycotting.  They are asking their employers to pay them for the work they performed.  That is federal law.
@realDonaldTrump Usurpation?  He was the Director if he FBI!!
@JesseRyanUSA How in the world do they justify enforcing other laws while they are trying to save the lives of heroine addicts? They should immediately suspend all law enforcement while they are irresponsibly protecting the lives of people at risk of heroine overdose.
@RealRachelTalks @RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump does not like anything Obama has done or believes in. Are you sure you want to take that position?
@RyanAFournier When was the last time you said something nice about someone or positive???
@RyanAFournier Why do you have so much hate in your heart.  Good god man!  You need to go to church once in a while.
@RyanAFournier @Kyeboy40 Would you praise or admonish a mom for risking her life by running into her burning home and pulling to safety her 4 year old and 6 year old children?
@DailyCaller It’s an emergency that needs immediate attention.  If the Democrats do not come back and do their jobs he is going to be forced to declare a state of emergency.  If they do find the wall then their will not be a crisis anymore.  Simple as that.
@AnnCoulter Whoa whoa.  Jared is a genius!  He is doing the job of 6 people and has the most intelligence.  @realDonaldTrump would not have allowed just any dummy marry Ivanka.  Trump knows what he is doing. He is manipulating the Dems and they are falling for his trap.
@VP You the @realDonaldTrump inherited such a mess. You need to get Congress to start impeachment process of Obama now!  Finally end this #DemocratShutdown !
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You can open the government now and still get the wall another way.  The current gutless Republicans are changing the party and basically ending it for good.  We are being blamed for this shutdown.  Just open the government and save a little face.
@JohnCornyn I believe in the wall and border security, but why is @senatemajldr not voting on opening the government.  He could vote to open immediately.  Just have @realDonaldTrump build it on his own using executive orders?
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Do you have any new talking points?  You do know that their are hundreds of other people in Congress, Senate and White House???  I mean, either you are incredibly ignorant or you harbor some unhealthy hate for certain people.  I am inclined to think the former.
@LT47415009 @DFBHarvard @BreitbartNews Me too. I just don’t see the relevance of chastising some one who post an instagram photo of having dental work.  Seems very trivial.  A lot more important issues like the national security emergency at the southern border!
@DailyCaller Since when to McCarthy turn on the republicans?  We certainly are not white supremacist, but we are definitely ardent defenders of our race.  @SteveScalise is a leader of the white race. @SteveKingIA is also.  Time to back off McCarthy!!
@SenFeinstein You should pass a bill to restore decency and honor to the Congress/Senate!
@CassandraRules Hey tough guy.  You seem a bit intimidated by the young males and small children.  WTF?
@KaseyMayer_ MANUFACTURED CRISIS!!!
@LT47415009 @DFBHarvard No, it was meant for @DFBHarvard
@DFBHarvard @LT47415009 @BreitbartNews Why does it bother you so much?
@Barnes_Law @Cernovich So what’s your point Bobbie?  His dental work is somehow offensive to the conservative movement??
@AnnCoulter Exactly.  The real threat is Mexico.   Bring all the troops home from the Middle East and send them all to the southern border.  If the Dems will not support a wall, then the military can stand shoulder to shoulder at the border and defend against the invasion!
@Sniper64286433 @LT47415009 So original...prick!  Must be so proud of yourself.  How did you think of such a witty response so quickly.
@Sniper64286433 @LT47415009 Any of you SOB’s rejoicing in someone’s poor health can go FYS!  That is the most despicable, vile psychopathic stance to take.  You may not agree with her politics, but she is a human being worthy of respect!  Shame on you!!!!
@richglickstein @sendavidperdue @chrislhayes is not a Constituent.  He is Deep state MSM!  Big difference.  He deserves to be put in his place!
@ATX_Cat4 @marybwhiteside @FilpoShelley @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer The country is more worried about animal immigration straight through our Open borders.

@Cincytive @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The Marines are military... duh. Go back to to one of them ivy leave schools.  You ain’t learnt nothing have you?
@NancyEllenT @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Haven’t you watched the news?   @realDonaldTrump, @PressSec @SecNielsen and many others have given you the truth.  The southern border is being over taken by rapist, MS-13 gang, drugs child murderers!!!  We must...#BuildTheWallNow !
@NancyEllenT @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The majority of them have already told @realDonaldTrump they support him and are okay with not getting pay.  They see it as their civic duty.  The rest of them are Dems and don’t deserve to get paid.
@CFWard57 @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The majority of welfare goes to illegal aliens.  Cutting those programs would help reduce the waste.  Allow real hard working and deserving Americans keep their own money and not give it to the Them!
@JohnCornyn Them dirty Mexicans are bringing diseases including cancer to this country.  Please build the wall.  @realDonaldTrump has spoke with thousands of citizens that are fed up with democrats obstruction of border security. We are under attack. Please stay the course!!  #BuildOurWall
@DailyCaller https://t.co/Cl9TwiuogO
@KamalaHarris So tell pettyolsi and stupmer to open the government.  Stop playing politics with innocent people’s lives.  Our country is inder attack.  This is the worst national security threat in modern history. How many deaths, rapes and drug crimes need to occur before we declare war!
@jetrotter @LT47415009 Welcome aboard.  We can really use your support and talents. We need many folks supporting the party.  We can use you to get more votes for our cause.  You watch however the Dems will try and say you are like an Uncle Tom.  We got your back.
@FeagleyTammy @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Look as patriots of this country, we all make sacrifices.  @realDonaldTrump has heard from many thousands of federal employees that have no problem going without pay.  They know he is resolved to keep us safe.  They support his efforts. https://t.co/SdfWprPPXh
@SpeakerPelosi @CaliforniaEPA Why are you not willing to compromise?  You and Schumer are holding our government and country hostage because you hate America!  You are for open borders and illegal immigrants.  You are soft on crime.  Time to give into @realDonaldTrump and open our government. #BuildOurWall !
@JohnCornyn The democRATS should have two years pay withheld and that money should be used to fund the wall!!!  #BuildThatWallNOW

@SusanMarch7 @nyalb13 @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Do you live near our southern border?  The threat is real!  What if your daughter is raped, or son is mugged, or forced to get hooked on drugs.  They don’t care their are animals!!  Thank God @realDonaldTrump is our Leader!
@joncoopertweets As a former Coastie, I can attest to there resolve.  Make no mistake.  They will stand firm with their commander-in-chief!  The know the security crisis at our southern borders better than anyone.  Giving up a few months of income is nothing.  They will be fine!  #BuildOurWallNOW
@nyalb13 @SusanMarch7 @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The deal is our country is under attack.  The leftist snowflakes seem fine with our country being attacked because they know they will get more votes in 2020 (illegal of course).  National security is way more important than Schumer and Nancy trying to open our borders!!!
@SusanMarch7 @VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Ha!  You think Fox News changed his mind?  Look, had has been operating 5 - 10 moves ahead of everyone from day one. He knows more about border security than anyone. He knew the DemocRats would renig on there promise and hold people hostages trying to make him give in.  #WallNow
@thehill @joncoopertweets The Coast Guard motto, Semper Paratus (always ready) have no problem not getting paid.  They will stand with the @realDonaldTrump to the very end.  They will make do until the DemocRats give into TRUMP and save the country from the invasion at the southern border!
@RashidaTlaib No one, I mean no one should be bad mouthing the President.  You work for him.  If you cannot take his leadership style and his superior intelligence you need to step down. You must apologize now!  I thought only US citizens can hold office in government.  If not, should be.

@VP @POTUS Please do not give in Mr Pence.  The 800,000 federal employees are paid too much anyway.  You should just leave those agencies closed for good.  The Democrats are trying to make @realDonaldTrump look foolish.  Send the Marines down to the border to fight the invasion until wall!
@SenWarren And then allow the thousands of illegal thugs, rapist and MS-13 gang members to just walk across our open borders. What would the Cherokee think of letting just anyone come take their land? Time to give up this ridiculous fight and give @realDonaldTrump the money he is demanding!
@SenThomTillis @ChrisCoons @LindseyGrahamSC @CoryBooker Sounds like you have abandoned your party and @realDonaldTrump    Sounds like you think he is guilty and you need to protect Mueller.  Wtf?  You work for us.  You must protect Mr Trump at all cost.  Your term is up 2020.  You had better watch yourself or we will vote you out!
@JohnCornyn How long are you going to allow the democrats to hold our country hostage. It’s time for you take control and demand they fund the wall!
@krassenstein Thank God Obama is no longer President!  @realDonaldTrump has finally restored faith in the presidency and confidence the US government is working for us forgotten middle-class.  Obama just wanted all of our money to make himself rich.  Thanks for supporting our gracious leader!
@Semaphore89 @LT47415009 In a way it is immoral.  It is immoral in the sense them liberals see illegal immigrants as their ticket to win in 2020.  Our country should not be giving false ideas to this terrorist, rapist and gangs that when they get here as long as they vote democrats there safe. #WallsWork
@SenWarren @ChrisVanHollen Not unless you Dems have caved on your grandstanding in order to hurt our @POTUS    You must stop resisting and start governing.  #BuildTheWall2019 !
@NBCNews @MalcolmNance The networks should be shutdown and closed for good if they attempt such treason. He is the President of the US!
@ForeverScape @unStunned @OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Tell that to the 4,000 terrorist that were apprehended at our border.  Maybe our strong border patrol are keeping those stats down, by the crime could be eliminated with the wall!
@unStunned @OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Exaggerating a tad yes, but @SecNielsen and @PressSec both have given the numbers.  There were almost 4 thousand known or suspected terrorist that crossed the Southern border illegally and apprehended.  There is no telling how many slipped through undetected. #BuildOurWall
@sendavidperdue @mitchellvii He should resign immediately.  He has disgraced the commander in chief.
@waltshaub @CarolLeonnig Trump knows more about the security of this country including the generals and even John Bolton. We are tired of being the worlds police.  Time to bring our troops home!  No more endless wars.  Let Russia have Syria!
@DanaPerino The liberals cannot accept that @realDonaldTrump won fare and squire!  He had the most votes of any other president in history!  No other president have had a more successful campaign.  He is a winner!!! He is winning for us!
@unStunned @OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Didn’t you read and hear the statistics?  Their are millions of criminals, terrorist and rapist that cross the border every day.  Our country is under attack.  @realDonaldTrump must build the wall!!! You must get on bored!!!
@ulricson @LT47415009 @gatewaypundit I agree.  Good riddance to congress. The smaller the government the better.  All we need is a strong president like Trump and a few cabinet members.  Get rid of the Congress and senate.
@krassenstein @TomiLahren @foxnation Why are you still allowed to post on Twitter?  It’s clear the Tommi is totally right to show what a racist @SenWarren is.
@JulieReichwein1 The mooch could do a lot better than that me thinks.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Thank you sir for advocating for us.  We are under attack by the dark, lazy mooches.  You respect us and know this country belongs to us. We must stand united!!!  👌🏻
@cheseth @JulieReichwein1 @POTUS The facts speak for themselves.  I mean look at what’s happening in North Carolina, Florida, and Kansas.  The crooked libs will stop at nothing to stifle the majority of Americans.
@cheseth @JulieReichwein1 @POTUS The problem with no term limits is the liberals tend to cheat and steal from the voters.  They will gather all the illegal votes, double voting and many illegal means to keep their people in power.
@NBCNews @maggieNYT This bothers me.  I love women, but the dangers facing the CIA is a little too much for women to handle.  There are certainly positions women can SERVE in at the CIA, but we need to keep the conservative model.  Many supportive roles and housekeeping positions.

@ObjectiveVoters @RyanAFournier Republicans have been absolute on their attempt to control illegal immigrants that brings the rapist, drugs, and the worst people.
@RyanAFournier No they are against it because they want voters to try and steal our democracy.  They also know it gives them an excuse to tax our citizens and take our money.
@alley167 @TeaBoots We should round up all the illegal immigrants already here and all of them crossing the border and make them build the wall. We will not pay them either.  Once they build it, then we send them back to their country.  We could #BuildTheWalNow for a fraction of the cost.
@justicetime @SL1733 @RashidaTlaib Terrorist!!
