Warren ad-libs from her prepared remarks to mention the #GreenNewDeal to applause. #FITN #2020
Warren's talk of using a "ultra-millionaire" tax to cover the cost of her universal child care plan brings several in the crowd to their feet. #FITN #2020
Warren told a story about her aunt calling her one night "long distance." What's the age cutoff where voters even know what that means?
Warren's focus in this speech to NH Dems is her childcare plan, tying her own difficulties finding care for her children. She notes that a lack of options almost derailed her career twice. "Without childcare, I was a goner. Today I am a United States Senator." #FITN #2020
@ewarren has her biography up front in this speech to NH Dems: "I grew up out in Oklahoma, on the ragged edge of the middle class in one of those paycheck-to-paycheck families. . . . " #FITN #2020
Representative Annie Kuster to @ewarren in front of nearly 1,000 Democrats in attendance here: "If you win this room, you go on to win." Lots of Warren support in the crowd. #FITN #2020
Potential and current #2020 candidates who bought ads in the 100 Club Dinner program: Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Hickenlooper, Sanders, Tim Ryan, Swalwell. #FITN

@mimms I'm available.
"Your Dad is a serial killer!" Tonight on 20/20
LEGO MOVIE 2 doesn't look good.
Booker really likes aphorisms.
Booker calls detaining children at the border "moral vandalism."
"People think we are going to win this by demonizing each other," Booker says.
"I'm not in this race to tear people down," Booker says. (Does that include @realDonaldTrump?)
"My work speaks for me," Booker says with regard to authenticity. McCain follows up by referencing "Spartacus." "It's a tear-down culture," Booker laments.
McCain point blank asks Booker if he's a grandstanding phony.
Behar asks Booker how he is different from other presidential candidates. He responds by saying that he doesn't want the Dem Party to be defined by "what we're against." (He said same in The Atlantic.)
"I'm running to restore our sense of common purpose," Booker says, continuing his unity, lets-work-together theme.
Here comes Cory
This Maybelline product helps you avoid "raccoon eyes." (That sounds bad.)
"I'm a high school principal who drives a sensible Japanese import and takes TRULICITY."
Joy Behar is pro-Kaepernick, anti-Maroon 5.

Asked about Trump winning Indiana, Buttigieg gives him credit for “showing up.”
Buttigieg says Democrats should consider advocating for the abolishment of the Electoral College.
“When I came out, Mike Pence was governor of Indiana.”
Buttigieg, who is openly gay, says his politics are informed by knowing one vote on SCOTUS allowed him to marry his partner.
Buttigieg says he’s living a “middle class lifestyle” in middle America.
It’s BOOT-UH-JEGE, btw.
Buttigieg says DNC has learned from 2016, now more open to “fresh voices.”
He says #2020 should be about “fresh choices.”
“We’ve got to get back to talking about freedom” as a party, he says. His theme: Freedom, democracy, security.
