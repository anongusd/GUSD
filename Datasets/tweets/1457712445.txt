@judous I'm not sure what you saw as "fake" but there are endless accounts of real assault. And there were plenty before the election too!
@judous Here's where you're wrong. It's not about YOU. It's about the system that devalues POC. I don't dispute that you've worked hard
@judous BECAUSE of white privilege. A Trump presidency, increased racism and racist assaults would not affect you the way they affect me
@judous My point is that although many Trump voters weren't racist, the possibility of increased racism didn't deter them. That's the issue
@judous The point is that white privilege isn't something you choose to enact. It doesn't reflect your character. It's societal
@judous I'm not sure that you understand that part. Because Trump supporters are coming under flack now, but POC and others will always
@judous That's a fair view. But my point is that my experience of these things is separate from the media. It's part of my daily life.
Someone just called me an SJW "social justice warrior" as an insult because that's "divisive politics"- not sure how to take that.
