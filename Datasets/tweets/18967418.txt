Cory Booker is speaking now. As he began, he said Jesse Jackson, who is also here was “the first person I ever voted for.”
She praised the work @staceyabrams has been doing to register voters since 2014. Stacey got huge cheers from the crowd.
Hillary Clinton made an impassioned call for voting rights in Selma and suggested the VRA being gutted factored into her 2016 loss.
Hillary says she’s eager to get to Cory Booker’s speech: “I’ve heard Cory preach.” She’s doing her southern accent today.

Sherrod Brown’s wife, Connie Schultz, has a novel coming out soon. I just asked her if there will be a character based on him and she said, “No. Very deliberately, no.”
@stuloeser Yes, not whatever that is. I’ve driven older Toyotas and thought they were fine by these new radars are just terribly executed
Part of the issue is that the car’s radar is awful. It blasts off random and jarring warning alarms for things like gradual uphills, paint or road texture alongside the car, and traffic in adjacent lanes. The gas tank is also on the awkward side and the keys have a quiet beep.
This car is so bad I actually started searching to see if I was somehow using it wrong. Turns out newer Corollas have something called “dynamic radar cruise control.” This basically does not work at all. Do not drive new Corollas

Why would Buzzfeed need to make a new report or declare it a scoop at all if they were merely reporting what Cohen had already said in the allocution. It’s obvious goal post moving and face saving.
So, I am watching MSNBC declare Cohen’s testimony “backs up” the controversial Buzzfeed story. In addition to the other obvious issues, there’s the question of Cohen’s allocution where he similarly said Trump implied what he wanted.

Cory Booker 'less concerned' with labeling Trump a racist than focusing on his 'racist policies' https://t.co/JLwYmxAfno
I should also note that the story says he “added” those points after bringing up blackface. He actually made the brief reference to the scandal in between those two other points that are sort of mashed up in that one quote
This is what he said about extending grace and reconciliation they’re two different segments of the remarks and quite different from that quote. https://t.co/FY1OMxqFVC
This article in the root includes this quote from Booker that just ... is not what he said in this exchange. https://t.co/T2JkupYszl https://t.co/m85LzXWhBw
Now, that’s a relatively small point, but there’s also at least one inaccurate quote purportedly from this exchange that’s made the rounds.
Some folks will undoubtedly still take issue with his comments about being empathetic towards whites with questions about racist incidents, but the context was different than what you may have heard
He brought up the blackface scandal as he said we need to have better conversations about race that include “grace,” “reconciliation,” and “truth telling.” https://t.co/QOXfYBFTVm
And for those who don’t want to watch a video at all. Here’s parts of a rough transcript. He was actually answering a question about how Democrats can regain support with deteriorating race relations. He was not asked to react to the blackface scandal. https://t.co/tk74IjpjlN
Here’s the video of the Iowa event where he referenced the blackface scandal. For those who don’t want to go as deep down the rabbit hole as I have, his comments are about 47 minutes in. https://t.co/g0CR5QwP8g
So, I asked Cory Booker about the controversy over his reference to the Virginia blackface scandal. He told me he felt his language was mischaracterized. This made me look into it fully and it does seem there was some inaccurate coverage.

Trump has taken to touting the lack of nuclear testing a s a victory. It’s a good thing but important to note other administrations saw stretches without tests as well.

This, my friends, is the way we live now.
So, yeah, I am pretty sure a decent portion of the NY/DC political sphere watched part of a video of someone taking a dump today. Welcome to 2019!
Suddenly, through the sound of what I shall politely term a babbling brook in the background, it became abundantly clear this person had indeed posted a live video of themselves going to the bathroom on this political person's FB page.
I begin watching this and start suspecting that what I am seeing might have been a person who accidentally turned on FB live while attempting to look at their phone on the toilet.
A friend of a political person I know just tagged them in a Facebook live video. This video then showed up on their page.
Here is a thread. I rarely thread, but this is worth it.
Oh my god. You guys.
@Scientz351 The Yankees with Keuchel added to this rotation would be easy favorites in my book — Oh, also if someone not named Aaron Boone was managing.
@SalilParikh I like Andujar a lot! While I think the Yankees are being cheap and not making a maximum effort I do think Machado and Harper are not necessarily the evidence of it. More about passing on rotation improvements beyond Paxton.

@AndroidPolitic Tons of different aspects of the campaign. Couple scenes in this in Bernie's book as well as "Shattered."
Among other things, what's stupid about this is the Yankees make more in ticket sales and merchandise when they win a championship so I am not even sure this is the best path to profits -- particularly since it isn't under the luxury threshold.
The strategy is *trying* to win -- while not making a maximum push — while also trying to save Hal Steinbrenner money. To pretend anything else is happening is utter denial.
This Arenado situation glaringly exposes the fallacy of supposedly waiting for future FA markets. The lines about needing to pay Judge and others also don't add up since they're over the luxury tax threshold and can afford it.
It is abundantly clear, particularly through the Yankees passing on Kikuchi and Keuchel, that their strategy is simply to field a pretty good team that has a shot at a series rather than spending more to have a nearly guaranteed dynasty.
Remember when the Yankees' grand strategy was supposedly passing on Machado to wait for Arenado? Now Arenado's locked up. Fans really need to call bull on Yankees management.

@DPLennon I know I’m being rude and I apologize for that. I just can tell they’re trying to pull one over on fans.

@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon You can say what you’d like about Harper or Machado. But there’s literally no intelligent argument against the Yanks getting Keuchel. Rotation was admittedly main weakness for offseason. Does Paxton make it awesome?
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon We lost early and badly in playoffs. We lost players too. Didi, Robertson. The WAR analysis on the additions and subtractions isn’t great. And the rotation is real shaky. Love CC but safe to assume he will lose a step from last year.
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon To me, it doesn’t make sense to be over at all without making a serious run for it. Hopefully they’ll surprise us, particularly with Keuchel. Have a good weekend!
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon You know they’re over the threshold this year right? https://t.co/Npyy6xt9By
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon You just said I couldn’t name one. You don’t seem to understand the team’s revenue. I think you have a lot to learn about baseball. Have a good weekend
@Matt_Cheney @illaduff @DPLennon And bottom line is, it’s not your fantasy team or cash strapped at all. They could spend now and in the future. They built dynasties for decades by spending and making the most all with pretty healthy margins
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon Dallas Keuchel. Pat Corbin. We could easily have either plus Paxton. Come on.
@Matt_Cheney @illaduff @DPLennon Half the time they didn’t spend before we heard it was cause they were waiting for this year. Now it’s another. That young core won’t be around or cheap forever if not a run now, when?
@Matt_Cheney @illaduff @DPLennon There’s an argument for not signing Harper and Machado. There’s no real argument for not doing more to shore up the rotation. Paxton is good but we need one more starter and ones better than him have been available
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon And the Yankees were one of the top teams last year but not championship level. They are not one of the leaders when you compare revenue to payroll. https://t.co/3KK4rtM1hr
@MikeDesorbo1 @DPLennon Instead they went over the luxury cap for a team with a shaky rotation that is looking like a Wild Card slot that could win it all if were very lucky
@MikeDesorbo1 @DPLennon They have the money to put together a team that would be overwhelming favorites for 3-4 years at least
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon Also what’s the point of spending anything to be middle of the pack. Got to put real cash on the table and make a WS push at some point. If not with this core, when? Get woke my friends
@illaduff @Matt_Cheney @DPLennon The teams revenues in 2017 were over $600 million. Those numbers get even higher with championships. They absolutely can afford higher payroll, luxury tax, and payments on the stadium while making a dynasty push for a few years
@MaraGay At least you know you’ll never have to run into him at Junior’s

@ShipwreckJoe @YankeeSource I’m continually amazed by how many fans and media are pretending this obvious truth isn’t there
@YankeeSource Takes a great manager to take a rotation with holes to a championship. Girardi did it once. Boone seems to need all the help he can get.
@YankeeSource Yeah he’s a big part of why “solid” isn’t enough and I want to see them with the greatest team possible. This team was historically great hitting wise and the coming bullpen is incredible. Still, the starting rotation has obvious glaring issues.
@YankeeSource And even if they did that by say adding Manny and Keuchel along with the other moves, Boone is a massive liability. Canning Joe and being cheap may end up squandering this awesome core
@YankeeSource It’s a contender and maybe even upgraded but this was. A squad that failed to win the division and washed out early and ugly in playoffs. They could have built up into being a clear favorite
@YankeeSource Any hope for Keuchel or another pitcher or is this really the weak offseason of my nightmares?

@spiderstumbled @YankeesPR Personally, Machado + Keuchel would have been my ideal moves. Maybe more than we’d need and “overpriced” on the back end, but would seem to be a lock for a championship
@spiderstumbled @YankeesPR There can be arguments for not picking those two up but there’s no justification for not doing more about starting pitching.
I went to a lot of games last year and was fairly excited. Have far less interest this time. @YankeesPR Starting to look like cheap Hal is about to preside over only the second decade without a Yankee championship.
Yankees still *could* pull it out with this lineup but the starting rotation is thin and almost every bet they’ve made needs to pan out. Why not really go for it?
And even if the Yankees made all the right moves, Boone is a huge liability. They are taking a moment and young core where championships should be slam dunks and squandering it.
Paxton is a meaningful improvement but less that half what starting rotation needed. Ottavino is good but there were losses in bullpen. The rest of the offseason was questionable pieces filling in for Didi. All of this while ignoring major stars.
Also so much credulity among the NY sports media. So little questioning of lines about “additions” heavily based on re-signing people that were there last year with no mention of losses.
It’s painful to watch cheap Hal Steinbrenner and @yankeespr pretend this has been a solid offseason. Now the line is that we’re waiting for next season’s free agent class after years of being told it was this one. Literally no excuse not to sign Keuchel.

McManus was just holding court. Totally together and elegant after who knows how drinks. I bought him one to thank him for having me. Told him it was the best damn political event I’d ever covered. Remains true to this day. That man threw one hell of a breakfast. RIP
@JackCookeInNY He’s the best. This was a (not very) blind item
We get to the last bar and it’s late afternoon. Folks have been drinking for a full work day. Cops, nightlife characters, politicians, and a stray reporter. There’s Jim McManus at the bar in impeccable brown tweed.
At some point we broke off from the parade and went to some bar that had a mechanical bull. Then there was one more bar. I don’t even think calls were made. These McManus club guys were just running a circuit.
So yeah there I am marching with the Council, a drunk detective, and a bar bouncer who played a wild man on SVU and looked the part. We marched for a while. There was a flask.
I remember a lot of the members who were used to me covering their pressers and other events were kind of surprised to see me. I specifically remember @pfvjr asking me what the heck I was doing there and seeming pretty amused by it.
Next thing I know one of the guys flashes a god detective’s shield and we are in the middle of the parade. In fact, we’re not just in the parade, we’re drunkenly marching right with the Council members contingent.
We eat, drink, and next thing I know my source is grabbing me and saying we’ve got to go to the parade with some of the other club members. We’re teetering over to fifth avenue and hit a police blockade.
I get to the McManus breakfast and it’s at this TGI Fridays in Midtown. It was like a two story TGI Fridays. They had a buffet. All the mayoral candidates were there, the whole Council, packed house. Guinness was flowing. It was before 8.
I had this source that I met from my gossip page days. He was a legendary  barman who once played a lunatic on Law &amp; Order SVU. He was also apparently treasurer of the McManus Democrats. He got me into the party and told me to meet him in midtown at like 5 am. We pre gamed.
Say what you will about Tammany Hall and New York’s old political club system, but the McManus Democrats throw one hell of a party on St Patrick’s Day. It’s a breakfast. A very boozy breakfast.
I’m going to leave out names to protect some folks, but also because my memory of this isn’t 100% It was St. Patrick’s Day

Apparently, the light has three settings, “for hire,” “on duty,” and “off duty.” Only one of these settings means the cab is open for you.

And one would think the last controversy would have led Rep. Omar to get fully up to speed on how to discuss this more sensitively. Israel can be criticized aggressively without offensive allusions.
There is an Israel lobby, but US support is due to many factors including politics, religion, and regional strategic interests. Any critic of the Israeli government who says it’s all about money is speaking both inaccurately and in line with gross stereotypes.

Their words, even in Herring’s careful apology, show the troubling roots of blackface beyond its dark history. This is a behavior a person doesn’t engage in if they have true respect for black people as fellow human beings.
I immediately thought of these words when I heard Herring’s admission. Hikind did blackface to play “some of these basketball players.” Herring and his friends were largely unspecified “rappers we listened to.” The dehumanization is apparent. They saw stereotypes not people. https://t.co/AL1rsqDCgN

You do not forget these things when you see them. The issues went far beyond the widely publicized instances of abuse.
I was in high school at the time in the same Brooklyn precinct where Louima was brutalized. There was one incident where cops tossed my classmate through a window. They joked about Louima and covered their badges. They arrested my black friends who spoke up and refused to take me
Diallo's killing was part of a wave of police violence from 1999-2000 that sparked widespread protests in New York including the attack on Abner Louima and the shooting of Patrick Dorismond.
Just realized that today is the 20th anniversary of the killing of Amadou Diallo, who was shot at over 41 times by police as he stood in his doorway. This was a key moment in spurring some of the current conversations we are having about policing and he should not be forgotten.

Even little kids know something is wrong with blackface and that it’s dehumanizing. The question is what they’re taught about it by the people around them.
I distinctly remember being confused by one and asking my mother what that character was and whether they were not a person. She explained that people had racist views at the time and sometimes drew in that style and it wasn’t OK.
When I was a little kid I used to love Tintin comics. For those who don’t know them, many were published in the 30s and feature some pretty horrifically offensive portrayals of black people drawn in the racist style of the time.

So, sometimes this website isn’t awful! I have connected with a few great people and have a couple of leads. Any other reporters who might be into working on something like this should get at me!
@amanimartin I don’t think it worked out w that place but I am trying to find a new one to bug!
@ElaheIzadi @lizzieohreally @alisonstewart I’ll DM you! People have already sent me some very cool ideas!
@lizzieohreally @alisonstewart People are connecting me with amazing stuff! I think this worked! there’s a great online gogo radio station if you’re into that sort of thing
So now I turn to you Twitter! I’d love to connect with a DC educator and help any way I can!
I responded that I was wary of doing that since they never actually connected me with tutoring opportunities and that I’d much prefer to volunteer with that. They never answered!
My wife and I both gave our info to a group looking for that. We didn’t ever hear from them! They just got back to us and asked if we would volunteer to canvas and sign more people up!
Even if it can’t be a media program, I am so down to help with tutoring and mentoring. I had a kind of weird experience trying to do this too!
I also approached another school with a journalism program and offered to help in any way I could. No response! I was sad about that.
The gist was we’d have the kids put together an online magazine. I really love this idea and would love to partner with the right public school in DC on it. Some of my colleagues graciously offered to help and even get the kids a newsroom tour.
One thing that I really hope I can address is the lack of diversity in media. I was talking to a public high school with mainly minority students about doing a media program there. The administrator kind of ghosted me but I have a whole plan written up and would love to do it!
I don’t want to live like that! I have been trying to find opportunities to do some work in the community and having a surprisingly tough time. Going to put some of this out here in the Twittersphere in hopes I can connect with someone. My DMs are open and email is in bio.
There’s the fairly wealthy largely white political world but it is pretty walled off from the rest of the city which is extremely racially and economically diverse.
At some point in the next couple of days it will be my two year anniversary of moving to DC. I really like it here! But one thing that bugs me is how there are really two distinct cities here.

@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Yanks had highest payroll in 96, 99, 2000, and 2009. Those were enjoyable too, but sure. they should definitely save up now
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR He’s average but him AND Paxton would have made for an OK upgrade. Plus hard to say he is overpaid. The market defines value and he got it.
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR No flexibility matters if they never build by spending on a star and the more average folks around in a given year.
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR What happens when they have to pay Judge and the others real money? Probably will regret not fully building around them now. “Smart” spending mediocrity with higher profit margins than ever is so dumb. What was point of all rebuilding if never to push
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR They built a core. Corbin or a trade would have been great. Corbin will be overpaid in final years. Why do I care? Yanks can afford it. They can also afford rebuilding years *after* wins. This is, as you point out, 100 win wild card team on par to maybe do slightly better
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Yeah team looked so good in the playoffs.
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR Do they improve a couple games from last year? Maybe. Could be easy particularly cause Boone crapped all April. Doesn’t matter. I care about championships as we all should w these kids. Do you think this is a clear shot at a Series? I bet not.
@BDayspring @YankeesPR Anyway the owners are real lucky to have brainwashed fans like you cheering for them to save as they rake in more of our cash. You also must love the “value” they get exploiting minor leaguers.
@BDayspring @YankeesPR They could have worked around it chose to get under the cap — and for what if not making a real push now?
@BDayspring @morningmoneyben @YankeesPR A mild upgrade as CC almost certainly trends down and team wasn’t close w last year’s lineup
@BDayspring @YankeesPR Team doesn’t need to be shrewd. Needs to win. So many fans convinced talking about “value” makes then sound smart. It’s the opposite. https://t.co/iA07dDp49y
@BDayspring @YankeesPR You’re acting like the team doesn’t have money. So dumb. Winning championships typically tends to mean taking on contracts that look bad in latter years. Team can still work around that.

Starting to see and hear more and more rumblings of Democrats frustrated with the leadership’s strategy here. https://t.co/CG08Z2c57Q
Neither side said really said anything new tonight.
Chuck and Nancy continue to frame this as a fight over, as Schumer put it tonight, a “30 foot wall.” Seems like they’re playing into Trump’s hands considering the fact that, even if he gets all the money he wants, there will be no wall
It’s interesting that the Democrats couldn’t settle on a single person to articulate their response to Trump.
Even if the trade deal is approved and does indeed lead to additional revenue, which is far from guaranteed, Congress would still need to appropriate those funds for a barrier on the border
I have asked Trump how the new trade deal would cause Mexico to pay for the wall. He didn’t really answer. This is likely because the trade deal hasn’t been approved by Congress and couldn’t pay for the wall even if it is passed. https://t.co/x9PmH6y6q3
According to the White House, the proposal from homeland security calls for $5.7 billion to “fund 234 miles” of a steel barrier. This is not really a border wall.

@YankeeSource As good as Machado is, we’ve already seen what happens when Yankees have a historically great lineup and a thin rotation. CC is a rockstar but unlikely he’ll be better than last year.
@YankeeSource The Yankees seem to be overestimating a lot of things including resigning existing players, only losing a few, and signing minor additions. Without Machado and another starter this offseason was weak.
@Marty2634 @PiperPerabo Haven’t watched those since I covered Hollywood. I like watching movies and TV itself not awards shows. The Beverly Hilton is a very nice hotel though. You should go if you ever have a chance.
@Marty2634 @PiperPerabo I would assume it’s a record low in modern history but can’t say for sure. I’ll try to find that out for you! Hard to say what will happen next. Things are always fluid over there. It was good he did a solid solo press conference last week.
I didn’t tweet a year end list of my own stories that I liked. You’re welcome for that too.
I won about $300 at slots and roulette tonight, which was very cool.
I was about to tweet about some esoteric media crap, but then I thought better of it. You’re welcome.
@Marty2634 @PiperPerabo Maybe so! It’s a real obstacle but polling shows openness. For example, I think Michelle Obama would win easily in almost any field if she ran.
@Marty2634 @PiperPerabo I’m from Brooklyn. I curse more than I should. Can’t bring myself to get too worked up over an F bomb. I thought it was quite interesting when Trump said Pelosi told him she isn’t looking to impeach.
@Marty2634 Let me know what you think! I always love going on there and it was great to meet @PiperPerabo

This is nonsense. A concrete wall was never realistic and Trump himself has already backed away from it repeatedly. https://t.co/6qoCtxEbL3
This was really masterful interviewing. https://t.co/HJi6VGhk1v
@EricDKoch I get the many reasons established media are reluctant to confront these real issues but why bother even writing the analysis in that case?
Almost every thousand plus word article about “millennials” would be far better if it was a single sentence: This generation is poor and facing higher barriers to stability
There is a whole world of content about “millennials” that analyzes behavioral changes that have taken place because of high housing costs, student debt, and rising permalancing that killed savings without focusing on those factors.

@mattbai I’m in this camp too— and for me it includes outspending philly
@EricDKoch In the meantime, I get enraged every time I read something suggesting the Yankees are smartly saving cash.
@EricDKoch Signing one of the big boys plus a pitching trade would be amazing. Maybe Cashman and lil’ Steinbrenner will prove me wrong and get it done. Offseason is long.
@EricDKoch Paxton is nice and they got a good deal. I know there’s no real aces without a trade and they don’t control that. If they can’t trade Paxton plus is what would make sense to me. Either with Corbin or Kikuchi
@EricDKoch I like Manny best, but him *or* Harper plus real pitching upgrades makes sense to me. Both would be nice but pitching almost comes first. That’s why I’ll have limited excitement even if they get Manny.
@mattbai @Yankees Joe Girardi *might* have won with last year’s roster.
@mattbai @Yankees And then of course there’s Boone, who badly hurt whatever chance we had last year and the next one
@mattbai @Yankees If anything, this current team is status quo or worse. CC is older. Didi is out. Robertson and Britton could they leave. Are they going to try to win next year or not? We won’t have this core forever and the farm system was cleared a bit.
@mattbai @Yankees I definitely agree Corbin wasn’t “worth” what he got. But he would have been the best non-trade improvement towards a Series. If they make no irrational deals or trades are they trying to win a championship?
I'm supposed to be excited about an older Troy Tulowitzki and more JA Happ? This team is so close to greatness. We can all see what it needs and they have the cash.
@howardmegdal Local media is way too kind about letting the Lil' Steinbrenners suggest fans benefit from them saving. They're making cash no matter what. Probably less than they could by investing in a Series win. George would be raging at everyone.
@mattbai @Yankees Plus the Yankees are so, so far from unprofitability. They can do a few bad deals and still easily afford to dump the guys and sign new names when they go wrong. What matters is winning, which btw means a lot of revenue.
@mattbai @Yankees Ellsbury was an especially dumb deal. I wouldn't put A Rod in the same league. There is no one in the group of Corbin, Bryce, Manny, or Kikuchi who'd be as bad to sign as Ellsbury.
@howardmegdal Fair. I also think fantasy has fans stupidly buying media coverage that applauds teams for being "smart" and spendthrift.
This isn't your fantasy team. It's not in danger of ever going bust. Yankees fans should only care about the team making real improvements to pitching and the infield that will bring a World Series.
@howardmegdal Like the Mets lower the bar? Or they falsely make fans worry about a team going broke?
The Pat Corbin situation is a great example of this. Was the deal a discount? No. Would it involve paying a lot for Corbin when he's too old? Yup. Should I as a Yankee fan care about any of this? Hell no.
I'm always stunned when I see brianwashed baseball fans bragging about how team ownership saved money on a deal. Why should any fan care if an owner managed to make themselves extra cash? This is especially true for the Yankees, which are the richest team.

@EricKleefeld @joshtpm Ah NYT was off, but that’s basically the point, Crowley wasn’t a real machine. Jeffries does over ten times those numbers in non competitive races
@LPDonovan Not the least apt typo
@EricKleefeld @joshtpm Did you mean Crowley. He actually got less than 12k against her. He is evidence the notion of a “Queens machine” wasn’t all it was cracked up to be at all. Those Jeffries numbers about show just how dramatically different he is.
@joshtpm That was actually a typo! I meant to say “machine pol” apparently my phone autocorrects pol to lol, which tells you a bit about me
@EricKleefeld @joshtpm The parties from individual boroughs have been reputed to have machines but their power seems to be one the wane, for example, the challenges Seddio is facing in BK
@EricKleefeld @joshtpm In my experience, there is no party machine there. Individual pols either have one of their own or not. I’ve reported on some firsthand. Rangel had a big turnout machine. Espaillat and Ydanis have one in WaHi. Jeffries has his. The DSA is a huge presence in North BK and Queens.
@EricKleefeld @joshtpm No. He got over 166,000 votes in his last race. That’s about 20 percent of the district even though it was not remotely competitive. Also the notion of a “New York Democratic machine” is not how this works at all.
This would be a much heavier lift than a Crowley or say Engel. It’s an ambitious target to pick!
The district is also far different. Gentrification and some of the new blood it brings in makes ripe turf for progressive canvassing. Jeffries’ district has undergone this but there remains far more of a unified community. It’s majority black with over 100k seniors
But Jeffries is a far different situation. He really has a network of allies he’s put in real work for in recent years and they have the combined power to put boots on the ground https://t.co/n8QSgikCMb
While Crowley had a rep as a machine lol, a big factor behind Ocasio-Cortez’s upset was the fact she had a machine on the ground (in large part thanks to DSA and Justice Dems) and he really didn’t. https://t.co/8qpby6iysX
It’s natural that Ocasio-Cortez would want to replicate her upset win and build a base of likeminded allies in DC but Jeffries is a far trickier target than Joe Crowley
This report that @Ocasio2018 is eyeing backing a primary challenge to @RepJeffries is quite interesting https://t.co/ZEdAU1tPDu

@alyssabereznak I mean, a lot of the gossip folks I know would have chased stories about harassment and abuse. Many did! But I think people were more scared to talk and didn’t necessarily see they could or should back then
@alyssabereznak I mean everyone had heard about Harvey and a lot of reporters chased him. The thing I heard about Rose wasn’t told to me as harassment. More like so gross! Bet I would have heard a far different version in the current culture
@noboa Jinx!
Tried very hard to confirm all this! I am so much happier now that my reporting energies are focused on folks who control our society rather than ones who are merely prominent. But boy do I sometimes wish politics reporting has blind items. The things we could hint at!
And then there was a great tale about photos of a closeted top actor and a super producer he was involved with that were suppressed by a powerful agent. That one was delicious.
Other fun blind items I remember that were lost in the Daily’s demise include an actor who gave his celebrity gal pal an STD from his cheating with guys and girls, a major producer who went on a long Coke bender in *i think* a Shrek themed hotel suite
It wasn’t even relayed to me as that he was harassing folks sort of that he was a weird oblivious old guy who was walking around noticeably please. Of course, now I realize this was a warning sign of much bigger problems.
The Rose thing *seemed* fairly innocuous at the time — that he took Viagra and staffers regularly couldn’t help but notice its long lasting effect on him during work hours
This is a very smart piece on blind items and #MeToo from @alyssabereznak. Back in my gossip days I’m pretty sure we ran blind items on Weinstein and we *definitely* ran one on Charlie Rose that I now realize was quite sinister https://t.co/b2wvrlwJju

@recycleman1969 He has been very accessible of late doing interviews, taking questions in the Oval, at the helicopter line, and doing interviews. This is the one setting he’s avoided
Martha Kumar is the best authority on this topic. Here she is with her handwritten notes tracking Trump’s questions. One thing is clear, Trump is engaging much more with press of late. Martha says 30% of his media interviews have come since Labor Day. https://t.co/I5PK7sGtb2
The inimitable Martha Kumar, who tracks presidential engagements with the press disagrees with me on this slightly. She counts President’s October 1 Rose Garden appearance as a press conference since that was 77 minutes long. However, it was not announced and scheduled.
This is the president’s first planned, open press conference at the White House since February 2017. It is only the second one he’s held with the White House press corps since taking office.

@brianvan Yeah not saying they shouldn’t have it just seems doable to have more crossings or less time of Brooklyn totally shut down. Also, particularly given the disruptions, more regular people should be able to participate
This is particularly true since so many of the participants are professional runners and it’s actually not easy for everyone in the city who wants to run to get slots.

It's worth noting that the president has been much more engaged in recent weeks with the formal conference in NYC and multiple Q and A sessions with reporters. This is a good thing and should be acknowledged as such. It allows the people to know more about the White House.

Cory Booker cautioned Democrats against “sedentary agitation” and staying home “watching Rachel.” “It’s time to yell, to rise up, to speak up. It’s time for you not to wait for hope, but to be the hope,” Booker said.
Cory Booker in Iowa: “We’re not defined by a president who mocks a hero in Dr. Blasey Ford. We’re not be going to be defined by a president who doesn’t believe women. We’re going to be defined when this state says not only do we believe women, we elect women.”
Cory Booker said America won’t be “defined” by Trump, but instead “by how we respond.”

Cory Booker is on stage at the Iowa Dems’ fall gala. He began by saying he knows there are “a lot of folks” who are “upset” and “angry” after Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

@thebeatsalive Thanks for reading. I wanted to share the story of his kindness.
I don’t know if this is an entirely happy story, but I don’t think it’s all sad. We should all be so lucky to have a friend like Larry in our lives.
As he walked back to Anna’s apartment, the last thing Larry said to me was, “The worst thing is there’s no one there to greet me when I get home.” My heart broke for him.
Larry told me he had to come by because he “still had a lot of food” at her place. I’m pretty sure that wasn’t it. “We were together for years. Like husband and wife,” he said.
I saw Larry today and he told me that Anna had died. The light was him. He was still keeping watch at her house and he was back again today.
Then we found out that Anna had a heart attack. It was supposedly a mild one, but she’s 94 so we were worried. Then last night the light was back on. It seemed like a miracle.
The other night we noticed Anna’s light wasn’t on. Usually one of them was up watching TV late into the night.
Larry explained that they worked together at the Library of Congress and became close friends. She was older than him. He’s been caring for her all those years she was inside the apartment.
I never met Anna even though she lived basically next door. She hadn’t left her apartment in years. She wasn’t doing very well. Larry took care of her.
When we got to talking that night Larry explained that he wasn’t actually my neighbor. He lived a block or so away but came each night to see his friend, Anna. “She’s my 94-year-old sweetheart,” he said.
One night Larry and I got to talking on the stoop. He looks like a guy who stepped straight out of Brooklyn in the 50s but I never did learn where he was from beyond seeing he had an Orioles jacket he clearly loved.
I have a dog. I would see Larry around all the time on our walks. I assumed he lived in my building.
It’s not really about my neighbor. It’s about her friend. For privacy’s sake, let’s call them Anna and Larry.
I’d like to share a story about my neighbors. I think the world could use it tonight.

AFTER the massive outcry over child separation, Trump issued an executive order and the DOJ sought to modify Flores. They could have done this beforehand. That’s the ultimate proof the ruling didn’t cause the separations and Trump’s policy did.
In fact, federal judges have recently ruled the Trump administration is “100 percent” responsible for immigrant children being taken from their parents. https://t.co/3ZZQ7Y69Ao
Flores sets a limit on how long children can be held with parents so some conservatives suggested it’s responsible for separations. However, that ruling was in place before child separation policy began. The separations only started on this scale when Trump enacted the policy.
The game Rush is playing here is conflating the 1997 Flores agreement with the zero tolerance policy the Trump administration began in April.
I am driving around the Midwest listening to Rush Limbaugh’s “week in review.” Rush is actually telling his listeners the ACLU is responsible for child separation at the border. He’s blasting “leftists” who “really believe” Trump created “the law.”

Any parking sign that can get someone towed should be posted by city employees over a defined area and with adequate notice, not by random neighbors who have decided they need a lot of space to move.
And then these signs will say something ill defined like no parking for “four spaces.” This is so nebulous and just makes you need to stay away from a wide berth. Definitely my biggest DC transit pet peeve apart from needing to swipe cards when you leave the Metro
The signs are supposedly required to be posted with one week’s notice. Can’t say I’ve ever seen this. Currently one near my house that was put up the day before it takes effect. A friend got towed over something like this. I am narrowly avoiding it now.

The @DCPoliceDept confirmed to me that the white supremacists who showed up to protest in Lafayette Park today are all out of the district.
I am back home now and getting ready to file a piece. I didn’t see a single white supremacist. Their presence was utterly dwarfed by counterprotesters.
@portdauphin Not saying the city shouldn’t have done it just a shame to see a small group take so much energy that could be used elsewhere
Here’s a video of the police horses https://t.co/Vsdd0EpOnq
The police are bringing out a lot of cops on horseback. I assume this may be the escort to try to get the white supremacists through this crowd.
The streets outside Lafayette Park are filled with counter protesters. I can’t tell if police have even attempted to bring the white supremacists out yet.
@portdauphin I’m not criticizing the responders in any way
Here’s some sense of the scene by the White House. “This is where they’ve got to bring them out,” one protester said. MPD and Secret Service are here. https://t.co/yg1o0Ansbt
Protesters are throwing projectiles and flares near the White House on 17th and Penn. Some seem to believe the white supremacists are about to exit through here. Some are chanting “Stop throwing shit!” And warning that it’s “just cops” behind the fence at the moment.
Walking through a largely deserted downtown DC. Amazing how many resources and attention have been wasted on a very small group of racists.

I would say all will right itself in the playoffs but Aaron Boone is terrible and has cost the Yankees many wins. #FireAaronBoone #BringBackGirardi
Meanwhile, this year’s Red Sox squad is a fine team that might be mistaken for great due to scheduling quirks and Yankee injuries.
This year’s Yankees are an otherwise excellent team that just can’t seem to beat the Orioles or, last week, the Sox.

@RSWinNYC @Yankees Tonight was kind of a bust in every way but I am pretty happy. People are amazing including @PaulONeillYES who gave me his autograph during his dinner break
@CynthiaWeston6 The Stadium staff went above and beyond. They really are amazing people
@RonWaxman @gloritare @Beyonce It may or may not have been at the Legends Club Bar
And the Yankees are the greatest.
@joanneccharles I just know not to get between a woman and her Beyoncé show
I saw many times tonight that there are nice people in this world who will help and lot and be kind when you’re in the midst of turmoil
A shout-out should also go to my awesome cabbie Singh who waited for me outside the stadium, took me back and forth from Manhattan, and followed this whole tale with great amusement
The moral of the story is that I love my wife very much and my wife loves Beyoncé very, very, very much.
My wife is happy now and waiting for her sister to arrive. She gave me a very stern warning about making sure to be on the early train to be back in time for @Beyonce
“You think this is a f—ing joke but this is very, very serious!” my wife said while also laughing. https://t.co/GrZi6kxyXQ
I am now going to call my wife. Let’s see if she still wants to keep me.
Here is a selfie I took with Awesome Security Hero Richard at Yankee Stadium. The other Awesome Security Hero was Ray. They were amazing! The @Yankees are the greatest at every level. https://t.co/5d1Z8MoCxA
I haven’t called my wife yet. I am tweeting first. I’ve earned this.
I GOT THE CARD!!!
As I walked into the stadium, my wife called. She has been reading these tweets. “Call me as soon as you get the card,” she said. She was not amused.
@kathmandu4 @Beyonce We’ll see if I get the card! We’re pulling up now.
@FrankieDrevan I worded that all very carefully because I foresaw that exact issue.	They were just totally unable to work with Ticketmaster.
I hopped in a cab and am approaching Yankee Stadium as we soeak. I am going back for the third time tonight. I will get my wife to this damned @beyonce show.
Awesome Security Hero had my card. The key to Beyoncé had been found. He promised to leave it with someone who will be at Yankee Stadium all night.
While I am on the phone pleading with Amex to help get my wife to Beyoncé, I got another call. It was Awesome Security Hero!
These @beyonce fans are very, very serious you know.
Both @Ticketmaster and @AmericanExpress were being useless. I have already paid for these tickets. They were our Beyoncé tickets. Yet I feared they would be lost. My wife would never forgive me.
When I returned to where I was staying, I called my wife. I had to fess up. She was so very mad. I promised to fix it and frantically called Ticketmaster.
Despondent, soaked and completely lacking cell battery I left the Bronx a second time and headed back to Manhattan without the card.
I should note waiting till tomorrow to find the card was not an option. The Beyoncé show in DC is tomorrow night but my wife wants to be there many, many hours early. Did I mention she really loves Beyoncé?
At the lobby a man I shall call Awesome Security Hero searched around for my card. He had no luck but took my phone number and said he’d be there till midnight and would let me know if it turned up.
I met a nice woman who told me the only open entrance was this lobby where they might be able to help. During the course of all this I walked around the entire stadium. I was drenched.
I feel to Yankee Stadium and the skies have completely opened. I begin walking around the stadium in search of an open door or staff. It was all locked up.
En route back to the stadium this dude totally lost it in the 4 train. He screamed at some women and had to be chased off. It was a wild trip.
I realized I lost the vital Beyoncé card only after getting back to Manhattan from the game in the Bronx. It was still before 9. I rushed back to Yankee Stadium.
The Yankee game got rained out. It was a sloppy mess at the stadium and somehow I misplaced my credit card— the one true card that is physically needed 200 miles away to get my wife to @beyonce tomorrow
I ended up getting offered some very cool Yankees tickets I could not pass up tonight. Hatched a crazy plan to go to NYC see the game and take a super early train to be back in DC in time to get my wife her Beyoncé tickets. This plan went terribly wrong.
So they are very, very specific that you must have the original ticket buyer with their original card to get @beyonce tickets. My wife and her sister need me and my card to go@to the show.
Also Ticketmaster is bad. A big part of this story is how @Ticketmaster is bad.
My wife and her sister are going to see @Beyonce in DC tomorrow. I helped get the tickets. @beyonce has some really, really intense ticket procedures
My wife really, really, really loves @Beyoncé. Her sister also really loves Beyoncé. Like a lot.
I am going to tell you all a story about an odyssey involving me, my wife @gloritare, the Yankees, extreme weather, one crazy subway person, and a pair of @Beyonce tickets
@marybeth37_ @PaulONeillYES Yeah totally made up for the trip from DC. He was very nice to me!
Thanks to Paul for making an otherwise bad night pretty awesome
I went all the way to New York to see a Yankees rainout, but I did get to meet @PaulONeillYES

In a presser or briefing, when they ignore or don’t answer a question, it’s blatant. When reporters are shouting in an informal setting, we get situations like this. https://t.co/aLWISC2Avk
However, Trump’s informal engagements with the press are no substitute for a real briefing or conference. It’s often a smaller group of reporters and he can dodge questions while pretending he didn’t hear as we saw this week.
This is true. Trump regularly engages in unconventional settings like pool sprays and the walk to his helicopter. He does this more than Obama did. https://t.co/2DOSwK34Kg
Good questions have still come in spite of all this including some from conservative outlets, but it’s well worth noting what’s going on here
And that is how the White House tries to cater to Trump’s desire to avoid tough questions.
Within these short White House briefings, you will almost always see questions from multiple conservative outlets (Newsmax, Daily Caller) and three different parts of Fox News (including Fox News Radio and Fox News Business)
Briefings have now become quite rare— often just one a week. And the briefings we do have are only about 20 minutes each. Spicer regularly went over 49 minutes. In Obama admin, it was often over an hour.
Firstly, Trump has not had a full press conference with the WH press corps on US soil since February 2017. The administration prefers these 4 question joint pressers where they pick the questioners. One is often a conservative outlet or Fox.
This great story details how Trump enjoyed a “friendly” interview was upset by a “tough” question and wanted one that was “easier.” There are a few ways the White House tries to shield Trump from tough questions. 	https://t.co/gotPBvrfox
