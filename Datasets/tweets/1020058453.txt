What does justice for Yazidi women look like? The answer is a lot more complicated than debating whether the women who married ISIS fighters should come home or not https://t.co/eseDUVwhlj

That makes it impossible to know whether a result is negative because, indeed, the victim was not drugged — or because of shortcomings in the test, or the amount of time that passed before it was performed. https://t.co/Hc8widflvh
And some labs rely entirely on a type of drug screen so notoriously fallible that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recommends that it should never be used in drug-facilitated sexual assault cases
Other labs test only blood — even though evidence of drugs last much longer in urine — or don’t have the resources to test sexual assault cases at all.
A review of thousands of pages of lab manuals from every state across the country shows that testing equipment in some labs isn’t sensitive enough to detect substances at low concentrations, even though drugs break down quickly in the body.
But because of the reverence with which scientific tests are often treated, negative results can shatter victims’ credibility, allowing defense attorneys to cast doubt on everything they say, and even leading prosecutors to abandon cases altogether.
No national standards exist for the range of drugs labs should test for, the types of screens they use, or the amount of drugs in the system that should count as a positive result — rendering the outcomes wildly unreliable and hard to interpret.

A million questions remain, but the mystery of Masters’ death marks entry into uncharted territory and raises the question: How can you ever know – really know – that anything you see on a screen is true? https://t.co/uyDrv0qAft
Now both imprisoned in the Philippines, Woody and Islam have created such a swirl of claims and counterclaims, impersonation, manipulation, suspicion, and fear since Master’s death that the whole truth about her killing may never be known.
Masters’ younger brother is convinced that Woody, along with a friend and fellow hacker named Mir Islam, plotted to kill his sister because she was demanding to return to the US from the Philippines, and knew too much about the men’s “drug and money laundering.”
Master’s relationship with her boyfriend at the time of her death, a 21-year-old American hacker named Troy Woody, began with a lie – Woody sent her Snapchat messages pretending to be rapper Mac Miller. From there, the deception only grew more dangerous.
In December, the body of Tomi Masters was found in a box dumped in a river in the Philippines. The truth of just how the 23-year-old from Indiana got there lies somewhere in a tangled web of drugs, deception, and cryptocurrency. https://t.co/uyDrv0qAft

When her relatives found out about the photos, they immediately stood with her. https://t.co/PQdg3TIXF2 https://t.co/9T66s0zBbj
The bigger battle was coming out of hiding herself. When we first spoke to A., she was determined to identify herself. What followed revealed the crossroads at which women find themselves when they want to “do the right thing” but must be cautioned against being too brave. https://t.co/AmVqIm3WKj
A. wanted to become one of the only Pakistani women to speak openly about her nudes being leaked online, but at the request of her family due to concerns over her safety, she has reluctantly chosen to remain anonymous.
The same Google Drive that contained her photos contained clickable folders with nearly 5,000 women and girls arranged alphabetically, under their real names. Each filled with dozens of images. Some were clothed, several were naked, most of them were stolen.
When A. was 17, she found her nude photographs on an alphabetized Google Drive. In Pakistan, her story could be seen as a cautionary tale.		But instead of being fearful, A. began reaching out to the other women affected by the image-based sexual abuse. https://t.co/PQdg3TIXF2

That censorship is far from isolated and particularly impacts girls. A recent survey of high school student journalists found that more than half of girls had avoided covering certain topics in anticipation of a negative reaction by the school, compared to 27% of boys.
Last year in Utah, high school administrators shut down the student newspaper's website and social media accounts after it broke the news that a teacher was fired for "hugging and other uninvited touching" and for sending inappropriate text messages to a student.
But students, First Amendment lawyers, and some politicians see censorship as a growing problem that teaches students not to value free speech at a time when the president of the United States is openly hostile toward the press.
School officials say they’re right to censor controversial articles to guard against stories that might spark campus fights, defamation allegations, or, in extreme circumstances, suicide attempts.
“#MeToo has landed on colleges and high school campuses in a big way."		As student journalists have attempted to report on peers accused of sexual assault and misconduct, they’ve run into pushback from administrations, sparking a First Amendment fight. https://t.co/57M80r7WxR

"The failure to solve fatal shootings of black and Hispanic victims appears to account for the entire decline in murder clearance rates."		Here are 5 things to know about cities' failure to arrest shooters		https://t.co/fjvKpmtB88
@teamtrace The overwhelming number of unsolved shootings means that violence goes unchecked in these already traumatized neighborhoods, which has consequences for everyone in the community. 		https://t.co/bDyUK8hL7Q
@teamtrace The detectives tasked with solving these shootings in most cities are overburdened with cases. And some police departments are so understaffed that a large share of shootings receive only a cursory effort, or don’t get passed to a detective at all. https://t.co/0GxpN6zi3F
@teamtrace The odds of an arrest are even lower if the victims are people of color. When a black or Hispanic person is fatally shot, the likelihood that local detectives will catch the culprit is 35 percent — 18 percentage points less than when the victim is white.
@teamtrace In the cities we examined, homicides and assaults carried out with guns lead to arrests around half as often as the same crime with another weapon or physical force.
Only a fraction of shootings in US cities are ever solved. Our investigation with @teamtrace revealed overworked detectives are letting promising leads go cold while families wait in vain for justice. 		https://t.co/bDyUK8hL7Q
