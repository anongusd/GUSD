Agents told us that 80‚Äì90% of the detainees are refugee families, not drug dealers or criminals. We did not find a national security emergency at the border, but we did find a humanitarian crisis. This is what I learned on our trip: 	https://t.co/mW1Ik7heBV
In addition to Elana being separated from her daughters, we saw dozens of women and children in holding cells, sleeping side by side on benches and cement floors with no room to walk between their bodies, no windows, and no place for the children to play.
Her older daughter was withdrawn. It was easy to see how conflicted she was, her feelings of abandonment when she told us that her mother had missed her 5th birthday the week before, and her struggle to reconcile the attachment she had formed to her foster family.
Elana described how much of a toll being separated from her little girls has had on her, but she didn‚Äôt have to. We could see it in her face, in her tears, and in the way she and her younger daughter clung to each other.
With a lot of luck and the assistance of pro bono lawyers, she was released and reunited with the girls after four months, just a few hours before we met her.
No reason was given for this separation, as Elana has no criminal record and has never been accused of child endangerment. Yet, it took days for her to make contact with her daughters through a social worker.
So, in October, Elana walked across the border with her daughters and requested asylum. Despite the Trump administration‚Äôs claim that it reversed its family separation policy in June, Elana‚Äôs daughters were taken from her and placed in foster care.
Under our current immigration laws, asylum is the only legal path of entry for Elana. A visa application could take decades, leaving her a terrible choice: raising her American daughters amidst dangers in Guatemala or trying to reenter the U.S. illegally with the girls.
Elana is from Guatemala, but her daughters were born here in the U.S. and are American citizens. Elana had returned to Guatemala for family reasons but found conditions too harsh to raise her girls. Fearing for their safety, she decided to return to the U.S..
On a recent trip to our border, agents told us about refugees walking up to their cars and knocking on car windows to request asylum. We met one of those refugees. Her name is Elana and she was separated from her children. This is her story.  #EndFamilySeparation (Thread) https://t.co/c51OqZGbJY

Q: What are your thoughts on the GND and why won‚Äôt you sign on right now? 		A: I‚Äôm committed to working on this issue &amp; eager to see how the GND evolves. I‚Äôm concerned about the ‚Äújust transition plan‚Äù for families in our district and low-income seniors this plan might impact.
I am very proud of my F from the NRA. We must pass common sense gun legislation.
Q: What will you do to support unions? 		A: It is beyond dispute that unions built our middle class. We need to support the rights of our unions and their right to collective bargain.
Q: Can we overturn this fake national emergency? 		A: We sent a letter to the President asking for him share the evidence with the @HouseJudiciary. I‚Äôve also cosponsored legislation to undo this declaration. This declaration was a gross abuse of power.
Q: What can we do about #GunViolence? 		A: If there is a national emergency in this country right now it is gun violence. It is our obligation to work on and pass common sense gun legislation. This is a true public health crisis.
A: We also need to invest in vocational education and making sure that there are various viable pathways to employment for our students. 2/2
Q: What are we going to do about student loans? 		A: We need to work on policy that addresses the issues contributing to this crisis, like predatory lending, high interest rates, and more. We need to make ed. affordable and accessible. 1/2
Q: What are your thoughts on healthcare reform especially medicare for all? 		A: We need to figure out a pathway to universal healthcare and I am committed to working on this incredibly important issue.
Q: What are your thoughts on DACA and immigration reform? 		A: We need to reform our broken immigration system ‚Äî we must do that with humane and rational policy. We cannot continue to demonize our immigration system.
Q: How has this diverse Congress impacted the way things are done? 		A: When you bring diverse voices to the table that is when you are able to make decisions that are more reflective of the country.
Q: What was it like to set up an office in such a short amount of time? 		A: It‚Äôs like running a small business. You have to take charge of building out a team that will help you serve your constituents, in DC and in the district.

I am very concerned about the impact of the digital divide on communities in my district, and the disparities between communities, schools, and consumers in access to the internet and at what speed. Equal access to online content must be upheld. #NetNeutrality
Internet access is also critical to free speech and fair elections, as digital communications tools have served as a launching pad for organizing citizens and voters.
Blocking, slowing down, or discriminating against lawful internet content hinders the ability of businesses and innovators to create new and profitable digital products and services, and for our communities and consumers to access them.
As a member of Congress, I intend to be a strong supporter of #NetNeutrality, and I look forward to supporting legislation to preserve and protect net neutrality and Internet freedom. A free and open internet is important to all of us. [Thread] https://t.co/XyyyHaS3hM
