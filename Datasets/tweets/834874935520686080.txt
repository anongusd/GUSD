@MedicinalNova @LaidbackManner @BernieSanders I agree completely. But the issue lies in the performance of teachers. Why excel without incentives? Higher wages, equal better teachers. But to get better wages, competition must take hold. By tax dollars following students, the schools are incentivized to get better teachers.

@marcorubio @POTUS Way better tweet than bible qoutes, man. I agree with this.
If he extends a middle-of-the-road act, say between RAC and DREAM, it would have to be met with a wide dial up of immigration policies. I'm still unsure about this wall stuff, but the compromise should include strong control of immigration. #PoliticiansAreGoofs #GameOfVotes https://t.co/I6JdmA6RkE
@DanielCates14 @MrBeardedTruth @EdPoginy @world_concerned @BernieSanders I agree. People need self-reflection. They need to seek their own moral stance. Test, speak to, and rearrange these thoughts until they are solid. Not to be fed by things like twitter. Haha.
@DanielCates14 @MrBeardedTruth @EdPoginy @world_concerned @BernieSanders Dude, I was talking about this with a friend the other day. People need a hierarchy of ideas. Rooted in a moral and philosophical stance. Find each other's roots, and if they're reasonable there is not reason they cannot coincide.
@DanielCates14 @MrBeardedTruth @EdPoginy @world_concerned @BernieSanders @AOC Certainly. But we cannot allow difficulty burden our attempts. We, as citizens, share a moral obligation to our society. And it is this that should bind us in disagreement. Divided we fall, man. Thanks for the convo!
@DanielCates14 @MrBeardedTruth @EdPoginy @world_concerned @BernieSanders @AOC Rigging the laws is akin treason. Which should be swiftly deslt with. Do not peg me as a zealot. I back maximum freedom for all. The rich, and the poor, alike. As long as it works within our laws, and does not impede on others rights, I am okay with it.
"The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs" (Emerson, 1841).  Ne te quaesiveris extra. #SelfReliance #Qoute #Emerson
@MrBeardedTruth @DanielCates14 @EdPoginy @world_concerned @BernieSanders @AOC Whether you deem it "truth" or not is irrelevant. Using the government as a bludgeon to redistribute money is immoral. This is akin to thievary. We must work to find more suitsbke answers to appease inner values we all share. Not to cast the aside, for comfort.
@98maryanne @BernieSanders What's your statistics for this? From my vantage point private sector intervention on public funded institutions raise the performance every time.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders I can understand that. But if your purpose is to maximize choice and freedom then you would have to allow it. Admittingly though I have wondered the same things. Maybe you could come up with a good measure to balance! That'd be awesome! Thanks for the dialectic, by the way!
@DanielCates14 @EdPoginy @world_concerned @MrBeardedTruth @BernieSanders Both parties have continued to fail us. Our system is fractured due to the arbitrary red and blue. People interest me. People with ideas. Not red, blues, dems, republicans, crips, bloods, any gang group. Let individuality reign.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders Thus, I drive my daughter 30 minutes away. I am a waiter. I am nowhere near rich. And i jad to go through a number of hoops to get her there, as opposed to being able to choose and have the public funding follow her.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders This certainly would be an addressable problem in rural areas but for instance, I live in South Florida. My county has 138 elementary schools, 43 middle schools, 33 high schools according to local stats. I know the ones within walking distance are consistently F schools.
@world_concerned @BernieSanders Which in itself is basically the voucher system I have proposed. And they finns carry the best education system in the world.
@world_concerned @BernieSanders According to the Finnish National Agency for Education, "The funding for upper secondary education and vocational education and training is based on the number of students reported by the schools as well as on the unit prices set by the Ministry of Education".
@MedicinalNova @LaidbackManner @BernieSanders The United states spends more on education than any other country according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It's not the money. We cannot just keep expecting tax money, and wasting it.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders Yes, and this would free that up. You could take your child to the best school. Any school. Anywhere within the state. Still tax backed. Funding better schools for all students.
@shoelessjoe255 @world_concerned @BernieSanders That's conjecture though, dude. You can't make that claim. Nothing he said is evident of that. Perhaps prager-u is a racist site, or whatever (I can't say). But nothing HE has said could back that.
@shoelessjoe255 @world_concerned @BernieSanders Cool. Sorry, I'm a med undergrad. Terms go straight to biology in my head. Ha.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders https://t.co/pEwdIyfxSj
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders The tax already allocated, would be more than enough to implement this. Teachers and children will have more choice of schools.
@world_concerned @drewpnf @EdPoginy @BernieSanders Tax dollars following a student will incentivize schools to raise performances, to get more students, and schools that cannot keep up will fail, and the money liquidated will go to better schools. Which in turn will raise the salaries to get better teachers. To get more students.
@shoelessjoe255 @world_concerned @BernieSanders I didn'r watch the video. I only noticed it said culture. And I don't think it's a jump to say that a unified culture helps a country move forward. And perhaps not a nationalistic style but just a general patriotism. But I don't think racial and cultural mixing is bad at all.
@shoelessjoe255 @world_concerned @BernieSanders You said homogeneous. Biologically? Or just as term? I may have taken what you said incorrectly, if you meant some CULTURES are wack, then I agree. But I thought you were getting racial.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders That's exactly my vantage point!
@watt4prez @BernieSanders You know... I  don't know, man. I feel like if you talked to the dude he would hear it out. But at the current moment this would not be his political agenda.
@shoelessjoe255 @world_concerned @BernieSanders C'mon, man. That's not needed. I'm sure you're trolling, and that's dope or whatever. But you couldn't possibly find a rational backing for that statement.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders You would have to offer better wages to get better teachers. Better teachers, equals higher scores, which in turn causes an influx of students, and their voucher cash. Inturn allowing you to pay higher than the competitor. Which brings more, and better teachers. Rinse. Repeat.
@MedicinalNova @LaidbackManner @BernieSanders Our system already does this. With private schools. Who out perform yearly. Because public schools will stay open regardless of failure. They have a never ending stream of tax dollars. But apply those dollars to vouchers for all. All schools level. Only performance counts.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders So other schools will offer more money. And eventually the markers give teachers of choice as well.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders It doesn't follow though. Schools start closing around you, and you want your school to survive. How are these parents chosing these schools? By grades. Thus it would only be lucrative to hire the top performing teachers here. You wont have this idea alone.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders I can dig that!
@watt4prez @BernieSanders Effectively making the career a more prestigious. And effectively raising the pay. Or at least if logic follows. Then again, I am no economist. We're only a tweetin'.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders At the risk of sounding calloused, the closing of poor performing schools will also cause an expansion of better performing schools. Which will require teachers, and a funnel of money into the remaining institutions. Only the teachers who are proven competent will make it.
@LaidbackManner @BernieSanders Well, no. I certainly wouldn't want that. But what I propose wouldn't cause this. The confusion may lay in the terminology (my fault). I don't believe the "voucher" in my terms mean the same as the mainstream lotto-style term.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders No worries! I definitely get your skepticism.
@watt4prez @BernieSanders Ah! Now this has always been my inner worry. See my worry is this. Big cities will lose poor performing schools, which would be great. Better schools would conquer, and overall better quality teachers, and education. But smaller towns, with 1 school per. May fail. As a town...
@watt4prez @BernieSanders Oh! And also check whether it is a "lotto" system. My proposal would apply to reworking every student as a voucher recipient. Allowing maximum choice of school. I guess I should of emphasized. 😅
@watt4prez @BernieSanders By the way. I appreciate the dialectic, man. Thanks!
@watt4prez @BernieSanders I did see this, as well. But I didn't see any studies, or backed data. Did you find a source?
@watt4prez @BernieSanders https://t.co/pEwdIyfxSj		I agree 100%. This is a popular one I have seen floating about. From what I can tell, it is reviewed. Though, if you know of refutation please post it, man! Thanks!
@BernieSanders Privatize education, or work out a voucher system. It's amazing how much money can be moved via competition. But don't get the government involved because these cats play a tough game. Let's fix things the right way, man.

@MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Fuck these people.
@jordanbpeterson Exactly.
@jordanbpeterson The win would balance.
@jordanbpeterson All in all. An action like that would throw a wrench in both the Democrat and Republican mind. Perhaps even short circuiting both just long enough to set the political bar back to neutral. Like a rip in space time.
@jordanbpeterson And then by relinquishing such a powerful position. It would serve to remind, that though an allegation is not proof of guilt, the existence of one is taken seriously.
@jordanbpeterson By winning his seat on the SCOTUS, it shows the "believe all women no matter what" crowd that due process is still alive and well. And the allegation of a crime is not the same as the actuality of one.
@jordanbpeterson But it does pose an interesting position. Kavanaugh, along with the newly gained power of SCOTUS, has  a large amount of stock in social politics. If he decided to give up his position, it would be a blow to the entire conversation. Both to the right and the left.
@jordanbpeterson An act of that magnitude would probably fix a lot of social unrest. I doubt it would happen, but the idea is interesting.
