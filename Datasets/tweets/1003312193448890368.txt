@nowthisnews @AOC As a taxpayer in US, AOC is green in knowlege &amp; definitely talking about lawmakers in Congress, all 535 senators &amp; representatives. Economic inequality is the result of laws passed by Congress for decades giving tax breaks, credits, deductions, etc to individuals &amp; corporations.
@nowthisnews @AOC If AOC wants to create more equality, and I surely do, then she should take away these deductions. It is Congress who writes &amp; passes tax laws that decide the economic winners and losers. Dems had super majority in 2009-2010, perfect time to pass tax laws laws to ensure equality.
@nowthisnews @AOC But it is really the lobbyists that write the laws. That is why the laws are so complicated, very long with hundreds of pages and contains loopholes that no one knows about because no one and I mean no one reads the bill. Never let a lobbyist write a bill, make it short &amp; simple.

@RDunnmanagement @RobHerring @cindy_long @OANN @realDonaldTrump Walls work, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be everywhere. Congress has given billions of dollars to other countries just to build walls! Walls will funnel illegals to areas of border agents. Just today tractor-trailer crossed with enough fentanyl to kill 58 million people.
The U.S. last year legally brought in 1.7million legal immigrants which I think is far too many. This country is getting crowded. I remember when we capped immigration at 250k. I‚Äôm happy w/250k. However we need time to adjust to those already here and need a pause of few yrs. https://t.co/McOnHolA6y

@fitsumbelay @guypbenson That budget that was supposedly balanced. Really. You call using the balances in all the trust funds legitamate? No, not at all.
@fitsumbelay @guypbenson O'care promised u could keep your plan, doctor, costs would drop $2,500. None of that happened.

@spiritof1972 @RMConservative @POTUS The upcoming spending bills submitted by Congress increases spending 16% over Trump's request.

What a self-serving class of elitist bullies! DEPORT!
@SenateDems @SenatorDurbin The irony is lost on you, Senator Durbin. If we didn't have illegals, then the market would dictate better conditions in meat packing plants.  Your open border policies ensure they don't.
@RMConservative Why would Mulvaney get to make this decision?
@RepMarkMeadows @freedomcaucus As a NC conservative, what have you done to get funding for the border wall $25B. The Dems, the GOP have no problem funding billions in discretionary funding &amp; your group has voted in favor of omnibus bills. I will not vote in 2018 period. @POTUS
That is @POTUS job! In fact, I  agree w/Bernie Sanders &amp; Tucker Carlson that "charge backs" to businesses that pay their workers so cheaply that taxpayers are paying for their welfare benefits: food stamps, medicaid, housing assistance. End all taxpayer costs to these invaders. https://t.co/iUzFA38TRM
@realDonaldTrump So the fake Republican leaders are meeting w/Trump this am. Will Trump again let these anti-MAGA roll him again on funding the wall &amp; real positive changes to immigration? Or will he stand his ground &amp; refuse to sign the bill. Almost half his 1st term w/zero done

@SenatorCollins Senator Collins, maybe you could use your position to see that pharm CEOs annual salaries of $20m, $30m, $40m could be used for better use such as research and development. That would be the best way to help John McCain and his family and future elders, possibly in the Senate.
@SpeakerRyan So many misguided people on this thread. Senators that worked w/McCain said he never saw a war he didn't like. The military will be the first to tell you that a lot of ppl get rich from war. Never mind our sons and daughters lose their lives, are forever disabled &amp; in great pain.

Goodlatte should propose a stand-alone bill funding the Wall, no DACA. Just one item. I tweeted to Rep Tenney that there are too many fake Republicans to get the job done. The first bill would have kept DACA alive forever. Bill 2 was mere fake anything, garbage.

@slpng_giants ProPublica is a leftist organizarion. I certainly don't believe them. Also the UMs have been trained on what to do, to say and how to act. Mexico &amp; one C.A. country run TV ads advising how to game the US system. One UM was wailing, "where is mommy, where is daddy". Not Spanish.

@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz As a conservative, I do not want to end the filibuster rule to get Ryan's immigration bill passed, which is a piece of crap. I'm glad I'm not the only one calling to deploy the military, not NG. DMZ has 28,000 troops on a 150 mile border. Deploy military to southern border.
@realDonaldTrump As a conservative and your supporter, I do not want to end the filibuster rule to get Ryan's immigration bill passed, which is a piece of crap. I'm glad I'm not the only one calling to deploy the military, not NG. DMZ has 28,000 troops on a 150 mile border. Deploy military now.
@realDonaldTrump If Paul Ryan was already gone, we would have a better chance of getting a good immigration bill. Any bill Ryan writes needs to be voted down. Thankful Ryan got called out for lying: his talking points was different from the actual bill. Love L Dobbs show, he tells it like it is.
@RealSaavedra I can think of two neoconservatives now in Congress; namely, Lindsey Graham, John McCain who loves war, so much one senator they haven't seen a war they didn't like.
@seanhannity Per last report there are over 55m able-bodied workers out of the workforce. The taxpayer burden for illegal alien crisis is beyond ludicrous; it needs to end now. Cut off $$ and jobs. VP Pence hired Marc Short, liaison between WH and lawmakers, represents Koch Bros. FIRE HIM.
@RepMarkMeadows I agree. Congress should keep working for the people, by the people, and of the people. And members need to be reminded of that and their oath. If Ryan was already gone, maybe we could get this done. Too many amnesties already. Build the wall and stop the insanity.
@reallyruth @ChicagoPhotoSho @GenecoInheritor @adamdavidson Please refer to me the bill or video or conservative media. I would like to read that. Paul Ryan wants to get everything done before he leaves Congress end of year. I would have to hear this from Trump's mouth before I believe he supported this. Ryan only works for his donors.
@edwardharris251 @thehill No, of course not. IMO Trump is the best thing since Reagan. Didn't care for the last four presidents.
@IntrepidKeith @realDonaldTrump The RINOs are retiring; and we will see who wins the elections. I will be voting for the most conservative, most fiscal candidate, and it will not be for a RINO candidate.
@SteveKingIA Thank you as we have given amnesty far too many times. We have been lied to, always promising border security and never fulfilling that promise. The truth be known illegals cost taxpayers at least 1/4 of a trillion dollars each year. Add in billions for refugees.$22 trillion debt
@LHarasiuk @thehill And Mexico is on the receiving end of many millions of dollars each year from this country. This needs to stop, especially since there is no accountability.  I doubt there is any accountability from any country.
@realDonaldTrump Once the RINOs are gone after this election, maybe we can get a real immigration bill, like the original Goodlatte bill.
@realDonaldTrump Sean Hannity just called out Paul Ryan on his "talking points" being different that what is actually in the bill.  In other words, Ryan lying on the floor. I don't think there is anyone who doesn't already know he is a liar. Hang him up by his toes would be too good for him.

@reallyruth @adamdavidson @ChicagoPhotoSho Obama took $800 million from Medicare to give to Obamacare. This year 2018 will be the first year more SS benefits will be paid out than revenue coming in. And they are not cutting anytime soon. Those already retired and near retirement will not be cut. Talked about for years.
@bernie_langer @adamdavidson Not true. Due to liberal education, we have workers who are not qualified. Some graduates have useless degrees. Currently there are 55+ million able-bodies workers without a job. Obama increased welfare by 33%; maybe all these people are on welfare; maybe they should take a job.
