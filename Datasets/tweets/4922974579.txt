@realDonaldTrump It is most important, Mr. President, that our trade difficulties be liberally negotiated and amity restored between our nations. Tensions between the U.S. and the Russian-Chinese alliance are at unhealthy levels.

@SenSanders I respect you Sanders but I simply disagree on this point. A great nation must have sovereignty to include relative control over who enters our land. And realistically, the more destitute immigrants we take in, the less help there is for impoverished citizens.

The blockade of Russia will fail as it did for Napoleon. Let not American power and prestige fail with it https://t.co/AeoG6CxK3a

@realDonaldTrump It's imperative that we end the Cold War: the habitual scathing enmity between Russia and the United States and also the seeking of regime change in the surviving Marxist states. Russia has hydrogen bombs as does North Korea; And the pretenses for these wars are dangerous facades https://t.co/pN67mnP4yJ

I plan to make my decision over many months regarding who to back in our Democratic primary, but I must say the overwhelming sense and fairness of Gabbard's social media posts, as well as her fleeing the fixed Democratic party of 2016 for Sanders, distinguishes her. https://t.co/6bIlJmTkfS
@AmbJohnBolton That said John: however vehemently we disagree on certain matters, I appreciate your having this debate on social media rather than just taking actions behind closed doors without consulting the public. Let's debate amiably
@AmbJohnBolton From the perspective of governance, John: nothing is more important than ending the Cold War, which is constituted of both of the proxy wars with Russia which have brutalized the people of Syria etc. and also this attempt to crush Marxist states like North Korea, and Venezuela! https://t.co/dIZzw13p74

I so strongly agree with this video submitted to Twitter by Senator Sanders that I've taken the unusual step of keeping in amiable and productive contact with Iranian moderates like @HassanRouhani … The U.S.A. must not abuse our European allies so, for one thing https://t.co/7ybwsXk8x5

@SenSanders Yes my friend Bernie: I quite agree. Iran is a non-nuclear state willing to abide by an agreement acceptable to most of the world. I'm in touch with them; And I'm appalled at the strong-armed imperialism some Americans are advocating, weakening our reputation

@SpeakerPelosi I'm dying but can't go to the hospital because I would only be barbarized and rejected due to my disability.

@SenSchumer Currently, impoverished women and even more women with disabilities are routinely pressured and even coerced into abortions under the façade of psychiatry and social work. If women want abortions for personal reasons or due to rape or incest, that's a horse of a different color. https://t.co/YsLDdBvGPC
@realDonaldTrump The truly democratic position on abortion is that all American women should be given assurances that if they give birth to a child, that child won't go hungry or want for shelter or education! If they've a drive to abortion for personal reasons, they should be permitted liberally https://t.co/pGpHFOiSd9

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I was disgusted at the way Clinton was pilloried and distracted from his duties by the Lewinsky scandal. Similarly, I cannot condone this all consuming inquisition into your affairs, especially considering that global security depends on improved Russian relations. https://t.co/qIU0j8Douv
@realDonaldTrump Yes, just to say it again: It was, on the whole: an historic and unifying speech. Keep up the hard work, Mr. President
@SenBobCorker We have the highest incarceration rate on Earth and I've seen injustice and fraudulent criminal justice practices in person. Citizens on probation also don't have the rights granted the serfs at the close of the middle ages. Considering how many are African Americans it's slavery
@SenBobCorker Yes good Senator Corker. But may I with respect suggest to you that the difference between slavery and our sky-high rates of citizen incarceration and corrective control is negligible.
@VP Mr. Vice President, As an independent citizen I've no objection to building the literal wall, even with extra-legislative defense funds. But I have disdain for fear mongering whether it's regarding African American citizens or caravans in Mexico. We are a great and vast power.

At the SOTU, Trump warned us in ignorant and melodramatic fashion that 'America will never be a socialist country.' But today's American markets are as corrupt as they are centrally planned. We've but proposed a modicum of social and economic justice
If the United States had pursued a policy of truly free markets, our lives might be at times brutal but they would at least be meritocratic. But the reality is that what happens in our markets is just as pre-planned as Stalin era socialism. Justice! Reform! https://t.co/FPPdHCoWER

It would be tragic to see Elizabeth Warren: one of the more meritorious Democratic 2020 candidates, forced out of the running due to spurious accusations stemming from her liberal identification with her minority Native American heritage https://t.co/yI8co18Euy
@CBSNews This is political correctness run amok. D.N.A. tests do show one's heritage, Native American and other wise. Those Native American leaders who say scientific logic shall not prevent their shaming Warren are not being genuine
@AmbJohnBolton @VP America's sanctions are powerful because we earned trust largely under the near socialist F.D.R. but also following. These sanctions are a sacred trust from the world that we're to use as a last resort. You throw them around like childrens' toys, wearing away their moral force. https://t.co/4p6MCvegvI
@AmbJohnBolton @VP I've been listening to your ilk plotting a Venezuelan coup on mindless cable shows since the first days of Chavez's election... plotting the subversion of Venezuelan democracy and the repeat of Vietnam. Now you pretend it's over this election. Obvious poppy-cock!
@AmbJohnBolton @VP Bolton You speak without credibility. The 'international financial circle' includes cities like Paris and London, where influential citizenries are sick of tyranny and imperialism emanating from our shores. Your proposed Venezuelan coup is nothing short of villainy, John. Repent https://t.co/j4rbGX96i8

@realDonaldTrump I thought your tone, Donald, signaled a desire for the bi-partisan cooperation that's needed if America is to be great again before 2020. But in your inaugural speech etc. you spurned us Democrats and now you need to show that you truly understand shared governance.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, It was an eloquent and powerful speech, as far a speech can go under the present circumstances. We marginalized and 'forgotten Americans' have these past decades watched the investor class grow ever richer while we work 2 and 3 jobs if we've the privilege of employment
@SenSanders Bernie, honored Senator; I couldn't agree more about thinking big. Regarding public medicine, I'm completely with you. Citizens shouldn't be dying while fat cats grow richer, even on them. But as for free university; I feel we need to feed the people first.

America's autistic citizens exist in segregated bondage, secured by two chains of oppression: that spontaneous prejudice we encounter when frequenting local malls and lunch counters, and the formalized eugenics of the government, where our second class status is plain to read. https://t.co/j1gJgP6O23

Our United States, which claims to be a nation of freedom and equity, has segregated and in horrible truth enslaved we autistics under the deceitful pretense of psychiatry. But we live a civil rights struggle as the African Americans of past decades did, and we shall triumph! https://t.co/plQoXOjYk1

@WhiteHouse @kimguilfoyle Mr. President, In today's United States the top 3 individuals own as much wealth as the bottom 50% and the top tenth of a percent as much wealth as the bottom 90%.

@SecPompeo @jguaido We Americans have a sordid, almost sinister history of trying to install puppet governments in South America. Our C.I.A. used to manipulate the clouds around Cuba to sabotage their sugar cane crops. Right wing animosity toward Venezuela's socialist state is ugly and long standing
@TulsiGabbard It's imperative that we end the Cold War but this won't come easily. Regarding Russia, there is a habit of enmity that dominates press and state alike. Then there are the right-wing hawks seeking regime change in the remaining Marxist states, even at the price of nuclear war
@TulsiGabbard Yes Tulsi! At the U.N. General Assembly of 2017 with the Korean peninsula on the verge of nuclear war, Trump explicitly threatened the nuclear annihilation of every North Korean man, woman, and child. Fortune put us on a better path but the instance showed us about Trump

@SenWarren Taxing the uber wealthy may be the best way to raise money to aid the working poor as well as the destitute, but it's not the only way. Government land holdings are vast, and our vast leviathan of a defense budget only increases the chance of war. It's simply unconscionable, Liz! https://t.co/3jEFpJ1o1J
@SenWarren It's true, Elizabeth! I know from personal experience. I was raised in a wealthy family but have come into dire poverty. We eat one meal a day so our children can have books and medicine. We curse our tenuous, afflicted existences and wish we were German or Canadian.

@SenWarren Yes, Elizabeth, Let's insist the "top 0.1% pay their fair share – &amp; start rebuilding our middle class."

@Scavino45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thanks for sharing Dan; As an American deeply concerned with the plight of the American poor, I'm supportive of the President's proposed see-thru partition. The less that we're awash in new arrivals, the more help can be focused on the American poor.
Mr. President, To continue the de-isolation of North Korea is to defuse this potentially tragic scenario. Let us relax sanctions enforcement to foster peaceful sentiment in Pyongyang. https://t.co/d156qxpYrB

@realDonaldTrump @SecondLady @VP President Trump, It's nice for you and Pence to lay that wreath, just as it was benevolent of you to sign the First Step Act. King gave his life not only for African Americans but for other marginalized Americans, like the poor and the disabled. Follow his noble example, Donald https://t.co/BiChDD7dqE
@SpeakerPelosi Thank you Speaker Pelosi! Martin Luther King was an effective and passionate advocate not only for his own oppressed race but for the poor, or those of us who don't fit into the American machine. He'd be appalled to see how the affluent, including moderate Democrats, abandoned us https://t.co/Qp2DaKRWeF

@CNNPolitics The interrogation of Buzzfeed's Pulitzer Prize winning team we just saw on the air was not thoughtful nor appropriate. Policemen tend right-wing; Liberals shouldn't look to Mueller for salvation or even impartiality. Remember Comey's letter and simultaneous silence on Russia.

If I've come to support Trump's wall, it's because I believe that prosperous America will be more ready to help our nation's destitute, diseased and addicted if that population is not interspersed and confused with foreign newcomers. This is my thinking and rationale. https://t.co/L9hyyIF8wp
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, You are sagacious in proposing this Southern border wall which amid other benefits would curtail the dilution of our citizenship. But I do exhort you to aid we citizens who wrestle with demons such as poverty, addiction, and disease... "forgotten Americans" sir https://t.co/9yFYYOp2Pj
@realDonaldTrump Your wall, Mr. President, is vital for our national security and also to prevent random and opportunistic foreign populations from entering our nation and then being amnestied, causing the dilution of our citizenship. Perhaps the military could build this wall, bypassing politics https://t.co/8BwirEKuB2
@realDonaldTrump We cannot have this perpetual and sizeable influx of illicit immigrants, year after year, followed by perpetual amnesties and birth right citizenships until our borders and citizenships would become farces.

From his teaching that man cannot worship two masters, wealth and God, to his pointing out the widow donating the greatest sum, the few small coins she had etc. Christ makes it very clear that we are not to separate ourselves by degrees of affluence nor to banish the impoverished https://t.co/wvYddvL6iC
Many in our divided U.S.A. claim to be saved and guided by Christ. I would posit that although it is not the only path to know Christ's mind, a study of the New Testament is key.

@realDonaldTrump In all frankness, Mr. President, I don't believe that most of the opposition to your proposed strategically placed see-through barrier has to do with the proposal itself, but rather with the divisions and animus in our nation. Democrats and Republicans can barely shake hands, sir

@realDonaldTrump Glad you all are eating so well. But you know, there are countless American children (who are heir to generations of American citizenry and military service) who are not. They're going hungry and the Freedom Caucus is out to take what bread is left off their table. Help them, sir

@realDonaldTrump President Trump's withdraw of U.S. forces from Syria is a most positive development.

In Bernie Sanders and I two passionate liberal hearts were joined. I won't comment upon the much gossiped upon nature of his initial attraction but it was our shared vision for a new American regime that joined us: Our shared passion about issues like the Citizens' United Ruling! https://t.co/2BtqSSQNGC
Provoked in part by a dispute with the local powers regarding an unjust ambulance bill I locked the doors of my small estate and wrote essays calling for a new and more just American regime, simultaneously indicting toxic policies upheld by right and left alike. Sanders concurred https://t.co/Mhy3UVN2ef

"The present curriculum: I put my fist in 'em." - Rage Against the Machine , in a lyric that means more than its inventor. This world's leading nation deserves far better than the governance we now receive which in many instances is grotesque injustice, in others simple madness! https://t.co/kVrFRSsQih
When I encountered Bernie Sanders and his nascent 'Presidential campaign' it was little more than an ideological nod to an understanding that the status quo and the agenda first championed by Clinton was as dysfunctional as it was injust. I helped inspire Sanders and our movement https://t.co/XTC3pQv1mi

"The obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas" - the late Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy .

Thomas Jefferson's ghost is not too displeased to see Generals and Kelly and Mattis taking their leave of America's halls of power not from any malevolent turn; But of the fathers, Jefferson was most alive to the fragile nature of democracy and wished to guard it against generals https://t.co/Jdfr9J59d9
Thomas Jefferson was as fretful to guard the hard birthed Republic against military as he was against financial elites. He would not approve of the unnatural Leviathan that is our 'defense budget,' nor of Trump's use of generals as advisers or crutches depending on whom you ask. https://t.co/J1IPRQPjVi
Both sides, Schumer and Pelosi, and Trump are culpable for sending police officers to work without pay and etc. But if either side is especially culpable it's actually my Democrats who often don't realize they need to include the feelings of working class whites in their equation https://t.co/WmhUPf45Xc

Matters in Syria will be less anarchic if the U.S. exits, considering that our foe Assad has won the war. This is the decision that's best for the Syrian people, not to mention the American people who fund all this war. Mattis has been successful as a warrior, not a policy-maker. https://t.co/hBrXbkZJBu
@realDonaldTrump Well over a decade later, from airport security to the renewed civil liberties erosions inherent to ‘The Patriot Act...’ We have normalized hardships upon the disabled and racially stigmatized. We are fearing fear itself
@realDonaldTrump America’s disabled citizens are gravely challenged by the airline’s frivolous shoe and belt removal policy and as a result often cannot travel for the holidays.
General Mattis may resign with good repute but frankly it was not our founding father’s intent that Generals make the decision of war and peace. Jefferson in particular will roll less with Kelly and Mattis gone
The honorable General Mattis obviously objects, but Trump is humane to throw in the towel regarding Syria. The war to make Syria any thing but an Assad ruled Russian protectorate is a vain cause mired in altogether too much human suffering
I commend President Trump on this defeat of ISIS in Syria and equally so on the decision to keep our troops out of danger while setting the scene for improved relations with Russia, which is best for the world despite all the talking heads determined to prolong the Cold War. https://t.co/az8uc54zrG
@realDonaldTrump Those in Congress and the Pentagon who oppose our honorable President in his resolve to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria want the soldiers there not to combat terrorism but to be a check upon Russia. We should rather take advantage of communism's downfall to thaw Russian relations https://t.co/gBtZp6JrAk

Trump's removal of our U.S. soldiers from Syria is for the best. The Cold War can only be ended if we can cease the proxy struggles with Russia, and instead form an alliance of sorts with our old foe. The Syrian people should not be pawns in a U.S. struggle with Russia. https://t.co/COYq5e0vsw
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, With this issue the heads and hearts wrestle across the nation. Your job is to address the issue with sagacity, even if that means seeming slightly cold. Sunday school morality does not befit the ruler of a nation, though neither does a genuinely draconian turn.
@realDonaldTrump I believe that America is great in her people; But I also believe that purveyors of perverse and reactionary public policy have too often sold voters candidates and legislation that are not nearly as great and benevolent as our nation itself... regarding a wide variety of issues. https://t.co/yRS2xsOQuq
Trump and his scandals are only the most recent phenomena coming from the Republican Party. Previously, they brought us a gratuitous war against a ruler who had expressed willingness to allow U.N. arms inspectors full access, followed by the banking crisis and great recession. https://t.co/h3eQ3gYwMw

@SenSanders Bernie Sanders tells us that he hasn't decided whether to run for President. I would remind Senator Sanders that he declared Revolution and put forth a vision for which he asked us to sacrifice. The Presidency is required to fulfill that vision; He owes it to us followers to run! https://t.co/ULiAqvM4z1
An historic moment. The Senate has seen the confusion and potential travesty of its abdication of those difficult decisions involving war and peace. In this vote, they've signaled they are wielding those powers the Constitution if not the courts reserve as their primary province. https://t.co/CAmVTO8jJa

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Despite our ideological differences, I commend you for all your hard work and service to the American people!

@People4Bernie @BernieSanders Beautiful words from a beautiful man.
@BetoORourke "Still fighting for a more perfect union..." That's certainly my case.

When the state seeks to manage conflicts with foreign states through an official policy of seeking uncontested military dominance, what example does this set for private citizens? We all have a duty to proceed with care of our fellow and to consider the sword but a necessary evil https://t.co/yLRamyJ9fj
With my family before me, I'll give thanks for the feast. Certainly, there are things I'm grateful for... But the three vices of tyranny, plutocracy, and hyper-militarism are pervasive in American life today. I respectfully petition the government for redress of these grievances. https://t.co/d7Ed9Oz0oV
Concerning guns and gun rights, what I have to say is that the issue is complex and difficult for one such as I, who has such a wariness of government tyranny but is also sensitive to the suffering of gun violence victims.

@VP Trump's initial reaction to the North Korean conundrum: his threat at the U.N. general assembly of 2017 to annihilate all North Korean civilians and soldiers alike by nuclear detonation, was a dangerous over-reaction. Things are now on a better path I have faith. https://t.co/ndndGLyOGU

To answer the question posed by this Microsoft News article, giving money to the poor is a better solution to poverty than some condescending 'graduation' program. Condescension prevents abundant resources from reaching the poor. https://t.co/ebrPfOtw3k
@Ocasio2018 @justicedems As for money in politics, I share Sanders' conviction that we are plagued by a plutocratic billionaire class. At any rate, I've always believed in speaking the truth potently even if it burns my tongue, not in hoarding money to flood the market of ideas with repetitious ads.
@Ocasio2018 @justicedems I would beseech you Alexandria to read my revolutionary essays and 'statements' on https://t.co/ucOvyhkoNQ under 'seannelson ,' or to pore through my Twitter feed.

@Ocasio2018 @justicedems Dear Alexandria, I was a close adviser and muse to Senator Sanders during his presidential bid and have considered running for Congress. But my vision is global in scope and I've found that by sharing essays and correspondence with leaders foreign and domestic, I have influence.
@JZarif @BarhamSalih May I give you a blessing from America as you pursue peace and security in your region. I have read the words of @HassanRouhani and I read mostly sense. What I hear from your regime's critics sounds like the criminalization of diplomacy, in essence. https://t.co/jDH6KN2zfH
@Scaramucci I don't know what to tell you Anthony except that I respect you and hope you've heard of me: you probably have. But when I play games, I enjoy the nuances and the sociality. As for politics, even there I try for profundity over shallow victory.
@WhiteHouse The U.S. has the highest percentage of population imprisoned on Earth, 5 times the rate of China. It's impossible to believe that Americans are far more criminal than not only the Chinese but every one else, so we must accept  that much of this imprisonment is wrongful and remedy

@DanRather Yes, I read it too Dan, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that such an elaborate assassination carried out in a nation's embassy came from the top. But the American press has been trying to unseat this prince with poisonous gossip about youth: he over-reacted.

@Scaramucci I haven't ultimately decided who to vote for, but it's very likely Bernie Sanders will get my primary and general ballot.

@Scaramucci The question itself is a bit absurd. We shouldn't be campaigning non-stop nor should the primary goal of public servants be re-election. A President can so abuse his powers as to make his re-election much more likely; Democracy itself depends on leaving re-election up to fate.

@jeremycorbyn Yes, in both our nations the deprivation of the poor is as you so aptly phrased it 'a political choice.' We are nations of vast resources and opulent consumption.

Senator Sanders doesn't put necessarily put it on bill-boards, but although he does plan to tax the wealthy to achieve his egalitarian vision for America he has another intended source of funds: the unaudited Pentagon budget which absurdly surpasses the next 12 nations combined. https://t.co/ULth2hYCvW

The fact that so many Democrats are ready to support Beto O'Rourke in 2020 affirms my theory that the American people are so frustrated with how their governmental authorities operate that they'll open the gates of power to virtually any silver-tongued newcomer.

@The_NewArab The Saudis are on thin ice with the U.S.A. due to their premeditated murder of a man who had become a U.S. journalist. If they raise prices it will show bin Salman has more hubris than sagacity. Yet if we Americans were wise, we'd make peace with Iran and increase global supply.

@nytimes As we were in the 60s, these United States are sharply divided by generation. The older generations look askance upon homosexuals and view foreign policy through a cold war lens. The youth support gay marriage and want better relations with former adversaries like Russia and Cuba
@PutinRF_Eng So glad President Putin that you could make this Peace Forum. In the great wars of the 20th century, my nation was usually not the aggressor... and played a dutiful role. But I worry that our oversized military is a provocation to foreign nations, including historic allies. https://t.co/RKnMnp3F4l

I agree with Professor Chomsky on more pressing issues such as whether we should be seeking peace with or reason to confront Iran, but Chomsky's dismissal of the recent scientific discovery that Neanderthals were likely linguistic and did interbreed with modern humans, is hubris. https://t.co/G8YfLu2uZi
Obama posits that periods of egalitarian progress are typically followed by periods of "conservative retrenchment."

@SecPompeo @jdickerson @FaceTheNation Secretary Pompeo, I'm satisfied with how your administration is disposing with the North Korean quagmire. However, I feel our approach to the Iranian situation puts day-light between us and our democratic allies, and erodes our credibility when it comes to drawing up treaties. https://t.co/bLPuFdpqHs
@The_NewArab This is why as an American citizen, I've been remonstrating with our officials for peace with Iran, a position I first took as an Obama adviser. American right wingers have no right to drive up the price of oil when Iran can be handled in a civilized, international fashion!
@NewYorker What a shame! It's no accident civil rights protesters went to lunch counters. Basic to citizenship is the right to be served at public businesses. L.B.G.T. rights must be further established and protected.

@TitusDurojaye I recommend "the Story of Civilization" by Will and Ariel Durant. It's a ten volume set which educates the reader upon the great civilizations that have come to pass, in a lively entertaining manner. But you read what you want.

The rhetoric and conduct of the said Donald J Trump is to half the nation racist, and ethically repugnant, while half the nation have embraced him as their leader.

@CBRhino1 Your first bulleted point is reasonable and persuasive as far as it goes. But your second is dubious. 'The Man' rules in America. We extract work even from mothers with infants. Those without children or jobs typically die. It's simply barbaric.
@CBRhino1 Thank you Chris. But as an unabashed liberal, I'll point out to you social welfare spending has long been dwarfed by the unaudited Pentagon budget, which surpasses the next 12 nations combined.

For marginalized American citizens, for example psych patients, there are obstacles on the path to voting. Discouragement and coercion are common, as is a need for education: to know the meaning of the questions being decided. Many overcome https://t.co/3xP9H3MAMD
@charliekirk11 Charlie, We have to care for our own citizens, and that means the citizenship must be guarded from new arrivals. Like you said, citizenship is supposed to mean some thing. After all, misery cannot be removed from the world, but it can be from a limited citizenship. https://t.co/iUhk0IbyV9
@RandPaul Correct Senator Paul. The Constitution is very clear on this matter! You want judicial activism? Look no further than those rulings enabling the executive branch to assume war powers explicitly and imperatively reserved for Congress by our Constitution, for good reason.
@cnalive I'd have to remonstrate with the priest that although many forms and practicioners of magic are pernicious, there is positive magic in this world. For an example, one only need look to Christ himself: healing diseases, cursing fig trees. It could certainly seem like witchcraft. https://t.co/2mRMo5iTGn
@MSNBC This utilization of the military for domestic purposes at best skirts a critical line meant to protect democracy from militarism. As for the caravan, one can only pity the poor wretches, living human souls used as human footballs by the right.

@FLOTUS Hello Melania. I agree with you that this is a noble cause. Thanks for backing it. I can tell you I was once addicted to opioids but am now on an opioid replacement patch. Opioids are euphoric but addictive...  a dangerous muse
@PutinRF_Eng Although I some times disagree with him regarding tone and policy, I'm glad Trump is persevering with thawing Russian relations after Helsinki and all the press flak he took.

On immigration, I diverge from both political parties and take a third view. The U.S.A. has largely empty territories and wildernesses and there is a moral calling to accept refugees... but crossing America's border illicitly shouldn't confer citizenship. That's sacred. https://t.co/tx0bLeEISg
@BarackObama "There is another kind of violence..."

Political violence is not to be practiced or condoned. But, as Senator Robert Kennedy said: "There is another kind of violence..." The violence of poverty is the alienation of the "unalienable rights." In this wealthy nation, citizens should not suffer so! https://t.co/YdPFPqNGg3
I know about political violence. As a leader in the Sanders movement I was coerced and received myriad death threats: some times veiled as internet ads, some times naked. I have never called for violence and when using my freedom of speech I have been careful with my words. https://t.co/oYANubtGIr
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President for your strong and unequivocal condemnation of political violence in our great nation! Like many political citizens from the Koch brothers to Soros, I've lived these last years with death threats. Nooses and dead-birds have been left on my property.

@WhiteHouse I grew up in an American home and went to American public schools. I also lived in Swedish homes and went to three different high schools, which easily surpassed ours in most ways imaginable. They have no homelessness: whereas here it's common to see people living in tiny tents.
@WhiteHouse I've lived in socialist Sweden. Their high schools are much nicer than ours: more like universities. They have no poverty, and far fewer citizens locked up etc..  That said, I identify as an independent liberal, not a socialist.  I know the value of private, competitive industry. https://t.co/7AA2mH3wDD

President Trump's vindictiveness toward the Mayor of San Juan has no end! When she protested that 16,000 aid workers were insufficient for a population of 3.3 million without power or infra-structure, he vowed to oppose Puerto Rican state-hood as long as she was in office. https://t.co/9rKOAdxggC
@WhiteHouse President Trump's vindictiveness toward the Mayor of San Juan has no end!

@WhiteHouse In what Ocasio-Cortez calls this "wealthy and moral America," we are going to make it a priority that all citizens have medical, dental, and mental health care. In other words, we are going to be a modern civilization...  not a menagerie of bi-pedal beasts clawing each other! https://t.co/WMBhvEWMN3
@NewYorker This might make sense to you at your prestigious magazine; It doesn't make sense to the common man. There are different races which have genetic differences. Warren was questioned and proved her ancestry. I don't get the Kafkaesque pseudo-reality here.
@cnni @drsanjaygupta @andersoncooper Anthony Bourdain was a great adventurer: one who pushed forward into the unknown where most pull back; Such adventurers are known to take their own lives. For example Meriwether Lewis and Captain Fitzroy of Darwin's ship 'The Beagle' https://t.co/myuWBrXdtu
Bourdain, whose passion for animal parts and the culinary arts was fervent, was also a cultural genius who understood what was going on in the wider world, and how a given region tied in. People will continue to watch his show for generations. https://t.co/GVtFMSRelH

Trump's animus against the 'lower' social classes that propelled him to power is confusing. A disabled and insecure American, the aid for the poor the Democrats gives me makes a life of art and philosophy possible and is appreciated.  Trump's stinginess is malignant. https://t.co/pxvdtoMDoi
Even the best pendulum can swing too far, and this either will be or is the case with the 'me too' movement. What starts as women reclaiming their human dignity ends with politically driven accusations etc..  Given time, the universe has a way of balancing things. #HeToo
@realDonaldTrump I'd like to thank you, Mr. President, for using the unique soap-box you've built to champion the 'he too' movement. It's good to encourage women to think of their sons, as even the best pendulum can swing too far.

@realDonaldTrump Yes, Donald, Comedy can be a beautiful art. But as a fellow political veteran, we've both seen it wielded by the narrow minded as a cynical political weapon. As for Kanye, I think it's great he's participating in our civic life. I am of course more liberal than either of you.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Kelly Anne Conway for pushing back against the excesses of the Me Too movement. We must grant a level of consideration to human rights and this includes the rights of sexual assault survivors. But we must realize that for every Anita Hill there is an Emmett Till! https://t.co/j62GN1waux

I suspect a thorough investigation would find some thing in the claims against Kavanaugh, but I simply see these incidents as indiscretions of youth, a youth who was more importantly a scholar. It should be noted that Kavanaugh has sent many female law clerks to the high court. https://t.co/5g25MR8XRq

@BillKristol From my perspective Bill, it looks too much like a pseudo-criminal investigation. The charges are ancient and, regardless, it's the responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent. Flake abdicated that serious responsibility in favor of a mediocre political 'compromise.'
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, The Senate's action of referring Kavanaugh to a 7th F.B.I. investigation represents a serious abdication of responsibilities. This is not supposed to be a police state. It is the proper responsibility of the Senate not the F.B.I. to advise and consent to nominees. https://t.co/fdUcyOhBID
To be clear, I'm a liberal who campaigned for Sanders then Clinton in 2016. Kavanaugh is not the judge I would nominate to the Supreme Court... though I can see his merits. Personally, I believe in putting politics aside between elections, but I can respect those who do not. https://t.co/AnK2kp54P2
As the U.N.'s recent report on American poverty makes clear, we tolerate such poverty and following human degradation as is rarely found in the industrialized world. There are many paths to the mitigation of poverty in the U.S.... but the leadership must find the will. https://t.co/fJHmGFis4t
North Korea has refrained from nuclear and ballistic missile testing, and has repatriated U.S. hostages and the remains of our soldiers.  This massive change in behavior deserves an easing of sanctions...  as Russia and China, U.N. Security Council members, have called for. https://t.co/7osyh0QTOa
The Lewinsky affair dominated the public press, and distracted a sitting president from critical issues such as North Korea, which was neglected. Kavanaugh believes, and I agree, that presidents should not be distracted by such matters. Presidents are leaders, not saints. https://t.co/0i4RkzOd2v
Kavanaugh is often critiqued for his belief that a sitting President should not be distracted with civil and criminal litigation. But the matters that a President must contend with are so weighty and ponderous that such distractions can surely wait till after time of office. https://t.co/pwEo8ErAx5
@dcexaminer @DanDePetris We are all human beings with libidos; We all have human rights; We all participate in power structures.

@dcexaminer @DanDePetris Flake allowed himself to be cornered in an elevator and viciously harangued, then caved to the most mediocre of political requests...  that the Senate hand over its investigate duties, its powers, to the police. This is not supposed to be a police state, you know. https://t.co/J1X6ZSEWBj
The activists who cornered Senator Flake in the elevator today, while claiming abuse, were themselves abusive. A civil man, Flake was trying to let them speak their piece, but they wanted a vulgar display of power... and to vilify both Flake and Kavanaugh. https://t.co/l3FIIKBYyT
@Shazam61389751 @realDonaldTrump Regarding the accusers other than Ford, I'd point out to you that the Democrats didn't even mention them in today's hearing, perhaps not thinking them credible enough.

@senatemajldr Thank you Leader McConnell for this strong defense of Judge Kavanaugh. Like you and many Americans, I listened attentively to both he and Dr. Ford. I found Kavanaugh to be more credible, and I believe we are witnessing character assassination in its vilest form. https://t.co/Sb8jCRFm1k
@senorrinhatch Gender aside, we are all human, with human rights that must be weighed. For every Anita Hill, there is an Emmett Till.
