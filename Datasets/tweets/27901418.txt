Don't touch that dial. Republican response upcoming.
Good speechifying and good politics to open with reminder that Iraq war over & end with SEAL mission that killed OBL.
"It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts, no handouts and no copouts."  best POTUS line so far
While every one jumps up and down around them, The Supremes are sitting so still it looks like they are painted into the scene.
"The state of our union is getting stronger"
Great moment when POTUS embraces Rep. Gabby Giffords..kind of a victory hug.
Pop the popcorn or get out the hummus and carrots. POTUS is in The House. It's State of the Union time.
Good news: Capt gave us a gate to go to to board new plane or at least one w/out crack. Bad news :we r a surprise to the gate attendants

Coming full circle. GOP begins with "scrap" the bill. POTUS closes w/ long statement saying, basically, no  "baby steps"
mich. dem john dingell says gop idea to start over is  "bogus talk. partisan talk"  not feelin' the optomism.
ny dem charlie rangel "thank you mr. president for saving the best for last"
it's like that old saying on the hill . "everything that needs to be said, has been. but not everyone has said it"
another burst of health care optomism -sen. tom harkin  we "may be closer together than people really think..."
and potus doesn't like that paper on table,designed to show how big bill is..said "these are the kinds of political things we do."
if  volume of paper on the tables at HC event is in any way related to how long this will take - they should have brought jammies.
john mccain speaks then POTUS slams him  "we're not campaigning here. the election's over"  they do not seem happy with each other.
gop complain dems talkiing more at HC summit  POTUS says he alternating sides fairly and doesn't count his own time cuz "I'm President"
max baucus (d-mont) says gop and dems are closer than we think on HC agreement...offcially becoming the most optomistic guy in washington
potus, response to GOP call not to jam through a dem. healthcare plan. Potus sidesteps..says he doesn't want to talk "process."
oh dear lamar alexander says if pres. won't scrub current hcare  plan, vow not to jam through..nothing else today will mean anything.  whoa
