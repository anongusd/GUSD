French Jews are facing anti-Semitism from the far-right, far-left, and among an extremist minority within Muslim communities. The focal point for all three? A warped view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. https://t.co/mVajW2T68r
ICYMI: On this week's AJC Passport we spoke with acclaimed author @YKleinHalevi about his latest book, Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor.
Tomorrow is the start of the first-ever AJC Global Forum in Israel! With over 2,400 people attending, we‚Äôre proud that our signature annual event will be the largest-ever American Jewish advocacy event to take place in the capital of the Jewish state. #ThisYearInJerusalem https://t.co/AHyRLnsJ3F

2 years ago, we had an idea to hold our annual Global Forum in #Jerusalem for the first time, to coincide with the 70th anniv. of #IsraelüáÆüá±. We expected 4-500 to attend. The Global Forum is now here &amp; 2,400+ are registered! We couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled. #ThisYearInJerusalem https://t.co/V1pcRdIfu1
We mourn the passing of our dear friend, Per Ahlmark. Former Swedish Deputy Prime Minister &amp; Member of Parliament, he was a lifelong friend of #Israel, relentless foe of anti-Semitism, &amp; champion of democracy &amp; liberal values. AJC honored him in 2004 with our Jan Karski Award.
In advance of AJC Global Forum 2018 in Jerusalem, a Times of Israel op-ed by our President John Shapiro details how AJC has stood in solidarity with the Jewish state ever since its rebirth 70 years ago. #ThisYearInJerusalem https://t.co/fCiBl8Bq1T
What can Israeli Jews learn from American Judaism? Quite a bit, says @YKleinHalevi. Hear him discuss his vision for the future of Judaism in Israel on this week's AJC Passport.
Congratulations to our friend Kenneth L. Marcus, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate today as the next Assistant U.S. Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. We look forward to working with him to combat all types of hate, including anti-Semitism.
In 1967, amid deafening silence from the UN &amp; media, a once-thriving Jewish community in Libya came to an end, after a wave of pogroms. Jews had lived there for 2,000 yrs, predating the Arab conquest &amp; occupation by centuries. No Jew remains in Libya today https://t.co/Vdq14mtv8G
Does achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians require ignoring the past? On the latest AJC Passport, @YKleinHalevi argues that understanding history is essential for peace.

Do Palestinians understand Israel's national narrative? No, says author Yossi Klein Halevi. Listen to AJC Passport to hear him explain why understanding the story of the Jewish state is essential for achieving peace.
Thank you @kmitsotakis for meeting with @ajcaccess and @HellenicLeaders in Athens. We look forward to hearing from you at AJC Global Forum in Israel! #ThisYearInJerusalem https://t.co/qDTsHGi92L
Palestinian strategy: 1) Threaten lives of athletes who compete against #Israel. 2) Set fire to Israeli nature reserves &amp; fields that produce food for Israelis &amp; Palestinians alike. 3) Fire mortar shells at kindergartens. 4) Send women &amp; kids into harm‚Äôs way. A pathway to peace?

Argentina shows a complete absence of cojones in bowing to Palestinian pressure and skipping soccer game against Israel. The beautiful game got a little uglier and peace looks further away today.
Robert Kennedy was assassinated 50 years ago today. As Attorney General, he addressed @AJCGlobal in 1964 on the need for the U.S. to embrace both the law &amp; the spirit of civil rights. Well worth reading his full speech: 	https://t.co/Nn1CozRvye https://t.co/JBq0SbVPts

51 yrs ago, #Israel fought a war for survival against Arab nations bent on its destruction. It miraculously won. To this day, the Six-Day War, as it came to be known, shapes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, says AJC CEO David Harris: https://t.co/qVLiuZZGr0
OTD 50 yrs ago, AJC‚Äôs David Harris was in Gene McCarthy HQ in SF, when Robert Kennedy was assassinated in LA. A journalist asked Harris, ‚Äúas a supporter of Kennedy‚Äôs rival,‚Äù his reaction. The reply: ‚ÄúWhat an obscene question! I‚Äôm anguished like every American should be.‚Äù
AJC Global Forum is coming to Israel for the first time in our 112-year history! Six days from now, more than 2,100 attendees will hear from heads of state, Israeli leaders, and policymakers from across the globe. #ThisYearInJerusalem https://t.co/W2NYwe2sFD
The core issue in 1967 was whether Palestinians and the wider Arab world would accept the Jewish people‚Äôs right to a state of their own. It remains the core issue today, writes AJC CEO David Harris. https://t.co/twoFKNWlhc
We‚Äôre sure that he means ‚ÄúIsrael is a malignant cancerous tumor‚Äù in the most moderate way possible. https://t.co/Ifrc3vdWs1

The U.S.-Israel relationship is too important to be politicized. Support for the Jewish state must remain a pillar of both parties and Israel‚Äôs friends should seek to bolster bipartisan support at every turn.
In a world too often defined by hypocrisy, double standards &amp; expediency, it‚Äôs inspiring to see the principle, courage &amp; honesty of the US Ambassdor to the UN, @nikkihaley. She‚Äôs giving the UN Security Council a much-needed lesson in moral clarity on Israel-related issues. Bravo!
The administration‚Äôs policy of separating undocumented children from their parents is cruel. A society that upholds family values, and recognizes the contributions immigrants have made and continue to make to American life, must find a better way to secure the border.

OTD 25 yrs ago, 5 Turkish Muslim women were burned to death in #Solingen, #Germany. It was a racist attack. AJC‚Äôs David Harris flew to Germany to be at the funeral. When asked why, he said: ‚ÄúIf people are targeted solely because of their faith or ethnicity, we‚Äôre all in danger.‚Äù
27 rockets were fired from Hamas-run #Gaza at #Israel. One hit a kindergarten. Luckily, no one was inside. Will we again hear about Gaza‚Äôs ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù? Will we again be subject to calls for ‚Äúrestraint by both sides‚Äù? Will we again see 1-sided, anti-Israel UN resolutions?

Europe ‚Äì and the rest of the world ‚Äì need to recognize that anti-Semitism is simply being repackaged. 4/

Prosecutors and judges in Europe have ruled that an arson attack on a synagogue is not anti-Semitic because the perpetrator was motivated by anti-Israel sentiments. 2/

Congratulations to Ambassador Felix Klein, a long-time friend of AJC who was just appointed Germany‚Äôs special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism.
Last Monday, PM Netanyahu announced a deal to resolve the crisis facing Israel‚Äôs asylum seekers. By Tuesday it was canceled. @AmirTibon explains what happened on AJC Passport:	https://t.co/FPxnNAlBkG
Syria, w/ Iran‚Äôs support, again uses chemical weapons against its own citizens. Just imagine what #Syria &amp; #Iran would do against #Israel. Meanwhile, Hamas flies the Nazi flag &amp; calls for Israel‚Äôs annihilation. This is Israel‚Äôs reality. It‚Äôs high time for the world to wake up.
Ronald Lauder says he was unaware of Secure America Now‚Äôs virulent anti-Muslim campaign, but offered support because of its opposition to Iran nuke deal. We‚Äôre glad to hear it. No serious Jewish leader should be involved in any effort to demonize or stigmatize an entire faith.
Are the protests on Gaza‚Äôs border with Israel just Hamas‚Äôs latest cynical use of human shields? Listen to our conversation with @AmbDennisRoss on this week‚Äôs AJC Passport to find out:	https://t.co/FPxnNAlBkG
It was a dramatic week for the asylum seekers in Israel, as a deal to keep them in Israel or send them to another developed country was first announced and then quickly canceled. @AmirTibon joined us for the latest episode of AJC Passport to explain:	https://t.co/FPxnNAlBkG
#OTD in 1994, #Rwanda genocide began, resulting in 800,000 deaths. Shamefully, int‚Äôl community, inc. US, did not intervene to try to stop the killings.

Another bloody Kishinev pogrom in 1905, which left 19 Jews dead, galvanized a group of American Jews to organize and help Russian Jewry. In 1906, they founded the American Jewish Committee (AJC) to advocate for the defense of Jews everywhere. https://t.co/oXrDigGAJg
Pogroms in Kishinev played a pivotal role in Jewish &amp; AJC history. Following the 1903 pogrom, Hebrew poet Chaim Bialik interviewed survivors. He wrote an epic poem, ‚ÄòIn the City of Slaughter,‚Äô which led to the first Jewish self-defense forces in Russia.  https://t.co/vypz8LFSi3
