@702_JRS1 @SeanAstin @Alyssa_Milano Wrong. I am an American human...what are you?
@scnjedi @dave_spirit2001 @scottEweinberg Did you just call free-thinking LGBTQ+, Black and Hispanic Americans "cows"?
@Cernovich I always precede my criticism of the bad things Muslims do with the word "extreme." You paint with a broad brush, as you say Christians do to Muslims.
@702_JRS1 @SeanAstin @Alyssa_Milano No, she's Left...and wrong (as are you)
@SeanAstin People have Tweeted that MAGA means financial prosperity and freedom for Blacks and Hispanics. And that is true.	But you wouldn't know because you blocked them even though they were cool to you outside that library in Houston in 2008 when you were stumping for Hillary.
@RyanAFournier Trump supporters are among the most sophisticated, honorable, kindest, and most prosperous American ppl in the country. Our ideals are gonna live forever.

Hey #MAGA, #MAGA2018, #MAGA2020 - @jtmbls is going around spreading fake news about good Americans. Block and report her. 	#Trump2020 #TrumpTrain #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
@jtmbls @ArchDeacon69 @cm_merlin @SpicyFiles I have a better idea - how about we report you for spreading the fake news you say you are against?
@smalltownandrew Does this mean he will now leave the US?
@Lizreynolds5 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Good. But Ford didn‚Äôt file a complaint. She went to her Congress person and trusted them not to leak her name. They did. They don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs lives they destroy or what principles they have to comprise for power gains. Same for major media.
@Lizreynolds5 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Another one that thinks they know the news. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Yeah, Garland. Not giving him a hearing was an idea that Leftists supported when Biden said it was Ok but when an R says it. I think we are being more than fair and impartial.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr No, I believe in being fair. Just you ought be and instead of making these arguments to you, you should make them to your fellow Leftists that say there is nothing to see in Keith Ellison‚Äôs case.
@Lizreynolds5 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr I get my info from the Truth. And what‚Äôs wrong with Fox News? They tell the Truth that Leftists can‚Äôt stand to here. Anyone that says Fox News is bad isn‚Äôt think clearly. 	What would you do if your son or husband was accused of sexual assault with no evidence or corroboration?
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr 6 FBI investigations have been done. No matter how many times you deflect that, it‚Äôs the Truth. The Best Investigation Organization in the World found nothing. Now they‚Äôre find something based on a decades-old accusation with no evidence or corroboration?
@Lizreynolds5 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr If it was your son being accused how Kavanaugh is being accused, how pissed would you be?
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr O geez. His reasons for no investigation are jacked. Kavanaugh and family have received death threats over this.	Fox News; blah blah blah. 	I don‚Äôt care about a Leftist that‚Äôs Ok with Black Conservatives being called names or told their not really ‚ÄúBlack.‚Äù And neither should you
@Lizreynolds5 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Yes, it is. They‚Äôve offered her to testify in private and all kinds off accommodations and still are. And having no evidence, or corroboration, of a decades-old accusation doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs telling the truth. Fair minded ppl know that. This hearing is more than fair.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr And it is, by the committee. You wanting to waste tax payer money, which is a lot of money out of the pockets of poor minority families, on an FBI investigation is another sign that justice and truth is not your concern. You want to stop a Trump-nominated SCOTUS pick. Period.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr That should have been handled by the local authorities. There‚Äôs no way the FBI can do a fair investigation with no evidence, place, time &amp; no corroboration. Your calls for the FBI to investigate is not about fairness or justice. It‚Äôs about derailing a Trump SCOTUS nominee.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Congressional hearings are not trials.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr There‚Äôs nothing to suggest Kavanaugh paid his debts off illegally.  FBI would have found that out by now.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr An FBI investigation with no idea exactly when, where this allegedly happened along with zero corroboration is unlikely to produce any different result if you think a Congressional hearing is worthless.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr They have given Ford plenty of chances and are accommodating her more than most. Besides, testifying in front of the committee IS investigating it.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Since is when is buying sports tickets a crime? Geez, you got nothing. Time to accept it or feel the pain when Kavanaugh is approved...and when Trump is re-elected.
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs transparency. Something you guys claim to champion. If there‚Äôs something amiss, it would have been found already. 	You‚Äôre gonna lose this, so you might as well accept it now.

@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Ds hands months to bring this forward. Attempts to delay this past midterms shows this is about stopping a Trump nominee rather than justice for an alleged sexual victim. Rs are being more than Constitutional than Ds. That my standpoint. #ConfirmKavanaghNow
@BL_St1 @cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr Committee has turned over more docs on Kavanaugh than any other nominee. Committee also includes many Ds that seem to be calling the shots. FBI has investigated BK 6 times. Since you think they‚Äôre that good, they would‚Äôve found something by now.
@washingtonpost Fake news.
@wwjoehd @MitziVictorius @TonySwanson @caracal @PolicyCandy @mrsaugustyn @megynkelly No, more like if there‚Äôs no evidence or corroboration then there is serious doubt this even happened. That‚Äôs what fair-minded ppl think, not mob mentality ppl like those who hung Blacks accused of whistling at white women.
@TonySwanson @wwjoehd @caracal @PolicyCandy @mrsaugustyn @megynkelly Don‚Äôt let them discriminate against you based on your gender. That‚Äôs what they do when they start that ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù stuff. Can‚Äôt argue facts, so they play the Gender Card.
@megynkelly @guypbenson Right.
@SenSchumer One extra day gives those paid protesters time to organize, get bail money together, etc. Sad that you have drum up faux outrage to get your way. But it‚Äôll fail, just like every dirty trick you keep trying with Prez Trump has failed.
@lexlight14 @Nunchuck_ninja @brownsugar7878 @WalshFreedom So? They should move ahead. Ford‚Äôs story has changed more than once, she cannot remember key details &amp; NONE of the witnesses she says were there can corroborate her story. The media can play that word game and call her accusation ‚Äúcredible,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not. #ConfirmKavanaghNow
@lexlight14 @Nunchuck_ninja @brownsugar7878 @WalshFreedom Prep? He‚Äôs been ready since Day One. Everyone is waiting on her to show up. They sat on this for months. She‚Äôs had way more time to prep then Kavanaugh has. #ConfirmKavanaghNow
@cfitztyler @Lifeforceforall @WalshFreedom @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassely @SenateMajLdr How the Hell are they are not reflecting a fair and Constitutional (capital C) process when they‚Äôve bent over backward to accommodate Ford? O that‚Äôs right you think questioning her is ‚Äúbullying.‚Äù You think Mueller wanting to question Prez Trump is bullying, too, then, right?
@lexlight14 @Nunchuck_ninja @brownsugar7878 @WalshFreedom While death threats are bad, accusers have a responsibility to come forward and have their accusations questioned and examined. Not doing so is how Blacks were unjustly jailed and killed in the past.
@CalebJHull @KyleKashuv He‚Äôs a Leftist like Ellison. The MSM gives them a pass while trying to destroy Kavanaugh despite no evidence or any corroboration of Ford‚Äôs story. #ConfirmKavanaghNow

@Me75327714 @dave_spirit2001 @BreitbartNews That‚Äôs bullshit. Deregulation and tax cuts have helped ppl including Blacks tremendously and Obama didn‚Äôt do that.

@FoxNews @realmarcoosuna And it‚Äôs backfired badly especially since @ananavarro was caught with an old Tweet saying the same thing. Many Independents will look at that and say ‚ÄúYou know, I think I‚Äôm voting for Trump in 2020.‚Äù

@Joy_EH @DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA Because Carla said I was a "whiney white guy" and hated Blacks (among other ppl) so I provided examples where I helped ppl who were not white.
@David_Quinones @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Yes, it did. Just this week, in fact.
@Joy_EH @DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA That's right. It meant something to them, and their families. One life at a time. And it is not white saving, it is Human Saving Other Humans. Color makes no difference when you help one another.
@Nicoletwit3365 @casslin @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Ok, then you will renounce all those who kept blaming GWB all during the 8 years of Obama's Presidency? You need to quit throwing shade on our Prez, who is working his butt off to make sure ALL Americans are taken care of, including Blacks.
@Nicoletwit3365 @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Still on the table, but many, even Conservatives, think it is too extreme.
@casslin @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC A year and a half into Trump's Presidency is not "inherited." It's Trump. And what I'll tell those ppl you mentioned is thank God every day you have means to support yourself. Because I've been there and I'd rather be shoveling coal than starving again.  #truth
@Joy_EH @yousparkypants @Karm4Chameleon @khoward7117 @ABC Powerline is run by attorneys, some of who are Liberal as heck. But if you don't trust them, maybe you'll like the Trump-hating WaPo better - https://t.co/vD19Mw6stw
@Joy_EH @DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA News outside of the US is not impartial and is controlled by ppl who are jealous/hate the US. If you trust them, you probably hate the US as well.
@DigiCarla @Joy_EH @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA Nonsense. I saved a neighborhood that included Blacks from being evicted, helped a little Black kid w/cancer have a final b-day party, helped a Black family harrassed by an HOA, lift up strong women everyday, and find justice for Blacks/Hispanics. Check your humanism. You're lost
@DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA @FoxNews I think @ShepNewsTeam would take issue with that...
@Joy_EH @DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA As I said, I worked in news and know they suppress and distort info. And when you look at what is happening, not what they tell you is happening, but what is really happening, it lines up more with Fox than the rest.
@Nicoletwit3365 @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Focusing on mental illness, trying to get funding for more resources officers (well-trained ones), and more security for our schools.
@CarlaCreative1 @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC My comment is #Truth!
@Joy_EH @yousparkypants @Karm4Chameleon @khoward7117 @ABC Powerline is not alt right and the Dems still blocked sensible gun legislation. #truth
@casslin @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Those are jobs that Blacks/Hispanics could have if not taken by ppl who shouldn't be here. A job is a job. You make money from it. Want the big jobs? Get educated or learn how to climb. Black unemployment is at historic lows after Prez Obama let it get to its highest point ever.
@peterelliott71 @andieleaandie @themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Ooo, the "gun lobby." üôÑPeople who think we just want to own guns because the "gun lobby" told us to do so know nothing about us. Whether it is schools or on the street, you have a crime issue and your gun ban hasn't solved it.
@r_hawk82 @yousparkypants @themetrobolist @khoward7117 @ABC Careful there, sir. She likes to block and report ppl she does not agree with...
@Ch3ckMypedigree @andieleaandie @themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Not true. In fact, watching Fox News makes one smarter. I suggest you watch it every day. And download the app, too, so you can listen at work, play, etc. You'll be glad you did.
@DigiCarla @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC @NRA I worked in the news business and can say, with confidence, that Fox News tells the Truth more than CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and MSNBC combined. (And I'm not an NRA member...)
@themetrobolist @yousparkypants @andieleaandie @PhilippeGagne00 @khoward7117 @ABC Well, they are not. Their lives are, so that is why we support 2nd A, etc. so we can save their lives.
@David_Quinones @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Really? Well, I'll just tell that to those Hispanic kids who are looking forward to a good Christmas since their dad (who I know well) just got a nice paying job after being unemployed for months. #MAGA is for ppl who really care about others. Get on board or get left behind...
@themetrobolist @andieleaandie @yousparkypants @PhilippeGagne00 @khoward7117 @ABC Which is why we need to have more trained resource officers (not scared idiots like those in Florida under that Leftist sheriff) and security measures like vestibules, key card locks, fences, interior room locks, cameras, etc.
@themetrobolist @andieleaandie @DeepStateVoter @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC We're talking about saving lives and this is encompassed in that convo. #dontbedaft
@Education4Libs Hello fellow Twitter follower! Are you following this person - @yousparkypants? She likes to block and report ppl who don't agree with her. Just FYI.
@themetrobolist @andieleaandie @DeepStateVoter @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC This is on topic.
@PhilippeGagne00 @andieleaandie @themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Which is why they strap it on like a vest so no one can see. Evil finds a way. So blaming law-abiding citizens or gun organizations is not very smart. If guns were banned, lots of Black &amp; Hispanics kids would be vulnerable. Sorry you want to see that happen...are you racist?
@thoen88 @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC American and proud Texan. Enjoy being in the Block Zone with Rod Serling!
@themetrobolist @JeffLee49107864 @andieleaandie @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Some early reports are that a resource officer shot at the shooter and may have prevented more from dying. Your comment may have been said too early...

@yousparkypants @Matatoto @GargoylesGirl @khoward7117 @ABC I deal with ISDs every day. Four of them. And I know putting resources officers, well-trained ones, in place, helps protect them.

@themetrobolist @katy77539 @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Sorry, but former US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has already let the cat out of the bag on that one.
@themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Working with leaders to secure schools IS doing something. Don't be daft...
@yousparkypants @Karm4Chameleon @khoward7117 @ABC I don't need to take time to reply. He is trying to get funding to put more resource officers, etc. on school campuses, but too many Leftists scream "We don't want our schools to be prisons!" so they block it. 2nd A isn't going anywhere. Securing schools is a solution.
@yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC And it is not Prez Trump or his supporter's fault.
@themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Addressing the opioid crisis is a start. And he said this in Feb. - "We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health."
@Karm4Chameleon @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Well, if you are not celebrating Blacks/Hispanics having more jobs thanks to Prez Trump, what would call it?
@GargoylesGirl @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC I am free. Much more so than when I was a Liberal.
@Kush6969 @HousecatHere @laura_tarnowski @ABC Congrats! You are one of the lucky ones.
@yousparkypants @themetrobolist @khoward7117 @ABC Wrong. Ignoring warning signs, bullying, mental illness, and a society that refuses to realize they are not as smart as they think they are &amp; should look to something else other than "logic &amp; reason" because that hasn't done squat but add to the misery on Earth is The Reason.
@themetrobolist @yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC I know. And it has nothing to do with Prez Trump or his supporters.
@HousecatHere @laura_tarnowski @ABC Yeah...in between the constant barrage of Stormy Daniels/Russia false narratives so no one really knows about it...
@CBinVAN @ABC Talk like that is what got Prez Trump elected in the first place. But keep talking...he'll be re-elected again in 2020 and then Pence after that...
@yousparkypants @khoward7117 @ABC Lives are being saved. Black/Hispanic unemployment at historic lows, about to get NK to denuclearize, got China to cave on tariffs, securing borders (which saves Black/Hispanic jobs)...Yes, #MAGA does save lives of ppl who might've died otherwise. Not supporting that is evil.
@MuseAndDig @Strandjunker @ABC If you are going to try and play mental gymnastics, at least don't fall down and hit the crossbars, as you did in your post.
@tj_lsudad @ABC Trump supporters are the ones who have helped unemployment get low, including for Blacks and Hispanics, since we elected him. Guess you want them to fail, which is pretty much racist. And don't be thanking Obama, either. He hasn't got squat to do with it.
@FOX26Houston Coaches can be bullies, too.
@0H0UR1 Yes, coaches can be bullies, too. Not just other students.
@washingtonpost King James on playing basketball: Brilliant	King James on Politics: Not brilliant
#MAGA https://t.co/5mVdBmMPWa
@0H0UR1 They can say what they want. When prayer, Godly values were championed in schools and society, these things didn‚Äôt happen a lot in the USA. There were still problems but not like this.
@DustyInArizona Guessing is not your strong point.
@in_pubs @WalshFreedom I think this looney has some - https://t.co/l6yWi5EmUG
@tedlieu @NRA Ok, here is a solution - fund having more trained armed guards at schools. Doesn't make them a prison. Makes them safer. Seen this implemented in some schools after Sandy Hook and there's been no problem. Blaming NRA and law-abiding citizens will never work.
@RandyStiefer @Oooooo_Donna @thehill That's is because they want the Big One to fall - the USA. If ppl in those countries began to jail/kill ppl, we'd step in and stop it. But without us being able to stop it, they would start. Better hope we never do away with the 2nd A. It's probably keeping you safe
@RandyStiefer @Oooooo_Donna @thehill Many in our military would not follow those orders. Besides, ever seen "Red Dawn"? That is what will happen on a much larger scale and the govt. knows it.
@RandyStiefer @Oooooo_Donna @thehill It isn't "rednecks." It is responsible, law-abiding citizens &amp; they will fight. Not because they like killing, but because they know govt will kill/jail ppl at will once that happens. Australia /England govts waiting for US to give up guns for this to happen.
@Oooooo_Donna @RandyStiefer @thehill You try to confiscate guns here, and you will have a Civil War unlike anything you have ever seen. Don't like innocents getting killed? Well, that'll happen for sure if you implement that here. Fair-minded ppl know the Problem isn't law-abiding citizens or the gun themselves.
@Oooooo_Donna @thehill I have talked to him, in person. He doesn't talk to ppl any different than what I have seen Leftists do. They just say that because he is an R President and not a D.
@RandyStiefer @Oooooo_Donna @thehill Australia, England, blah. Heard it all before. We are not them and their policies will not work here. Stop using them as a way of "winning" an argument. Besides, their murder rate is up, despite what the Leftists at Snopes say.
@Oooooo_Donna @thehill I'd love to jump in a time machine &amp; go back to the 1970s, but it's not happening. This is today's world. You can ban bump stocks or even AR-15s, but you won't stop this that way. Solution is a combo of trained guards/respect of Godly values/ban bad meds. And stop bullying.
@Oooooo_Donna @thehill One grown up.	ISDs are a part of my life. Deal w/four of them almost daily. I know some implemented security measures after Sandy Hook in bonds that included more resource officers along with secure entryways, key cards, etc. 2nd A is not going anywhere.This is the best solution.
@Oooooo_Donna @thehill Get your head out of your rear. Having armed guards at schools, which some already have, does NOT make schools a darn prison! It makes them safer and two recent instances prove having an armed guard SAVES lives. You want a solution? There it is. We're not England or Australia.
@Oooooo_Donna @thehill Yes, he is...and so are you. Anyone who is against having armed guards in high schools, which has proven to work, digs the graves for more dead students. Stop blaming the NRA and get behind securing our schools. Otherwise, you are part of The Problem.
@thehill Sorry, but you are - https://t.co/Ejh4YutNel

@BlueSea1964 Unfortunately, we are gonna hear more from them over this Santa Fe High School shooting, and more ppl saying "F thoughts and prayers!", too. I don't care what anyone says - My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and friends and I pray for their healing.
O, good Lord! Santa Fe High School is close to home. There are those that believe and will accept my thoughts and prayers for healing and comfort. To those screaming "the NRA are killers!" or "$%^&amp; thoughts and prayers!" - Sit down and shut up! You are not solving a darn thing.
@bokauffmann @Branko1231 @Philfandan @thehill @foxandfriends @piersmorgan Not true. He was interviewed by @chucktodd on his plane during the campaign. Also, during R debates in Houston, he answered all kinds of questions, including from Hispanic media. Acosta doesn‚Äôt want to interview Prez. He wants to abuse him &amp; Prez is right to refuse him. #truth
@LauraLoomer @jack Once upon a time, video cassettes ruled. Now DVDs do. It will be the same with Facebook/Twitter.
@johnlegend Babies become grown ups like us all &amp; become responsible for their own choices. And the Prez didn‚Äôt mean animals like a dog or a cat. Ppl have for a long time used the term ‚Äúanimals‚Äù to describe despicable ppl. Fair-minded ppl know and understand that.
@Bart150 How does this, even if true (and that‚Äôs suspect), mean ppl shouldn‚Äôt be outraged? Should a poor Black or Hispanic family think it‚Äôs okay to throw away $3 M over an investigation that has produced ZERO evidence our Prez colluded with Russians, the intent of the investigation?
@EllyDavis @washingtonpost Yes, it does. I saw for myself that Leftists are liars.
@keithboykin Fighting a war so Blacks could be free. Defeated Fascism, Nazism &amp; Communism. Sending food, clothing, goods to ppl all over. Not to mention the goodness ppl show each other everyday in the US that goes unreported. We don‚Äôt need to atone for sins.
@EllyDavis @washingtonpost I‚Äôve looked into ‚Äò73 case and there is nothing that says he‚Äôs a racist. Plus, I‚Äôve met the man and discussed race issues. Go back to your planet and stop listening to the dishonest reporting of CNN, MSNBC, WaPo and NY Times.

@sjserafin7 @scorpeo92 @MollyJongFast @MatthewBetley @jaketapper So they are people, &amp; what difference does that make? Charles Manson was a human. I bet you‚Äôve called him an animal.

@charliekirk11 Well, not some of the cities. Afraid they‚Äôve turned Blue.
@HotShot_78 Because they want to cover up the fact that Paddock was out to kill Trump supporters and they don't want them to get any sympathy from Independents and BlueDog Democrats (and probably Blacks/Hispanics, too) who will then vote for Rs this November and for Prez in 2020.
@CB618444 @KamalaHarris @DineshDSouza @Scaramucci @JesseBWatters @RuthieRedSox @MTReserved @phil4gop @USAloveGOD @Goz_1911 @DropTheTidePod @Real_PeachyKeen Leftists like Harris &amp; unfortunately a lot of college students do not give a darn about these ppl. They think Americans deserved this because we are a "bad country" that is "racist" &amp; all that. They don't want a CIA Dir. that is tough because they want the terrorists to kill us.
@CBSNews You mean like Missouri Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal who threatened to assassinate Prez Trump on social media and is still employed? And any word on those who called Sen. McCain a racist for saying "that one" to Obama in the 2008 Presidential debates?
@thehill This article speaks the Truth Leftists don't want to hear. But it would be better for Leftists to accept it now. That way it will be less painful in Nov. when they wake up and see the Rs kept the Senate and House.
@RealCandaceO @TheDemocrats @RepMaxineWaters I know. Look at the looneys they put up on TV - Stormy Daniels, her nutty lawyer Avenatti, Adam Schiff, 99% of CNN and MSNBC anchors and commentators...They just throw stuff to the wall, hoping it'll stick and can convince low info ppl to vote Trump out. It won't work!
@CBSNews @PressSec I've got a "q" for these Leftists now trying to play morally superior with this - Did you cheer on the Left when they called war hero Sen. McCain a racist when he referred to Obama as "that one" in the 2008 debates? If you haven't apologized or renounced that, then STFU!
@SendingTo714 @thehill Sounds like you are afraid of a bunch of woke Black Americans showing up, wearing #MAGA hats saying they are breaking free of the chains of the Democrat Party (which is what's happening...). https://t.co/DHNIJxoEuq
@Liz_Wheeler @SandraTXAS Days? Heck, they forgot about it within seconds!
@SendingTo714 @thehill Put down your copy of "Mein Kampf" and stop making excuses to deny minorities the chance to make extra money because George Soros and the Solitaire Network may bus in fake/paid rioters.
@thehill Then they are stupid. The money you get from a political convention far outweighs any feelings toward a political party. Besides, a lot of minorities benefit when a convention comes to town. Turning down the GOP convention is really racist.
@wgnamerica Bring the show back!
@jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill You‚Äôll get more truth there than you will at CNN.
@Brick11579 @Glammytami @kwilli1046 Right. He let Hillary jabber on about ‚Äúwhat difference does it make‚Äù when he should have shut her down or at least comeback with something good to that remark but he said nothing worth spit.
@kwilli1046 I hear he‚Äôs holding off to make a bigger impact on the Nov. election. But even if true, I don‚Äôt think an election should dictate law and order. Do your dang job and screw the election!
@AngelLight2U @Thom44810402 I found a gif about Avenatti - https://t.co/J7hYGfnv0s
@therealroseanne Have Kayne West move in on the other side.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump They hate Prez and won‚Äôt credit him with anything good. But fair minded folks know better.
@R_Love317 @jeff_teeple @thehill Yes, all CNN does anymore is either ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù or ‚ÄúStormy Daniels.‚Äù They are worthless as a news network.
@HoustonChron But I thought guns were the problem, not mental illness. That‚Äôs what those Parkland kids said (except for @KyleKashuv, but the Left is trying to silence him, so maybe you didn‚Äôt know that) #solidairenetwork
@jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill  https://t.co/X8KVhJ0rNL
@jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill Flynn is about to be cleared, Manafort deal pre-Trump, Cohen is big bunch of nothing. Stormy Daniels? Pu-Leeze. Trump is getting exonerated by Mueller and re-elected in 2020. See you at the next Inauguration!
@jazzyjamputi @jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill It‚Äôs real. https://t.co/giL2q10dDn
@jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill I don‚Äôt see them in handcuffs. Just a lot of insinuation and false facts on CNN/MSNBC. Perhaps you should watch Fox more. In fact, download the app and listen 24/7. You‚Äôll be glad you did. üôÇ
@jazzyjamputi @jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill So then you agree those wishing for Prez Trump to be assassinated are wrong and are willing to call them out?
@jeff_teeple @R_Love317 @thehill He‚Äôs right. So if you are Ok with one family being dissed but not another, that means you are practicing fake humanism.
@thehill Yep. Just like Prez Trump does.
@ResistanceAma @WalshFreedom Has George paid you yet? If not, better get a lawyer...
@DocEgonSpengler @cindymccain @kellysadler45 Not saying Sadler was right, but just wondering, but did you cheer on the Left when they said Sen. McCain was racist when he referred to Obama as ‚Äúthat one‚Äù in the 2008 debates?  And how about those war heroes (includ. Blacks) who support Prez? How will history remember them?
@jaketapper Funny thing is the ppl on here saying this is disgusting are mostly the same ones who said McCain was racist for saying ‚Äúthat one‚Äù to Obama in 2008 debates. #hypocrites
@WalshFreedom I'm sorry, but there are POWs who support Prez Trump who've been called racists, etc. No one says jack about them. But if someone says Boo about McCain, they are deemed un-American. Sorry, but McCain's RINOism has made him less sympathetic even if he did suffer as a POW.
@alysonsilverma1 @One4TrueFacts @SenJohnMcCain @NoKoolAidNow What makes Trump supporters so "low"? That they call out a former POW for being petty? I know some POWs who support Trump and have been called racists and other horrible names...you got anything to say about that or are you Ok with this?
@LibbyHitchcock @thehill You tell me. It's a sweltering 89 degrees here in Texas, my home state.
@LibbyHitchcock @thehill That Trump is a far better man than Avanatti could ever hope to be. And so are his supporters, unlike you.
@abc13houston BS. This is CYA at its finest. They knew and covered for him for years, allowing him to destroy women's lives. NBC is a whorehouse where women are used for cheap thrills then discarded.
@marklevinshow How the heck is he still allowed to vote?
@LibbyHitchcock @thehill Avenatti is a scumbag who doesn't pay his bills...and he is Sham Wowing you Trump haters - 	https://t.co/NR3q8NIBr9
@panfyre @Vms253 @thehill Well, maybe you shouldn't be trying to shame Christians while putting a scumbag like Avenatti on a pedestal. That doesn't make that "Reason and Logic" Crowd look very smart. Avenatti doesn't appear to pay his bills. And that hurts a lot of minorities - https://t.co/NR3q8NIBr9
@thehill It is amazing to me how Trump haters really think this Sham Wow fool is an "upstanding gentleman." If anyone thinks this lowlife is gonna take down Prez Trump, you really need to get your head examined. - https://t.co/NR3q8NIBr9
@Trumpty_Dumptee @Stewie0 @KrisAshtonWrite @charlieamter @clarke442 @w2spw2_23 Good Lord, if you idiot Trump haters don‚Äôt see what Prez was saying, then YOU need to go bang your head somewhere. O by the way - https://t.co/pewNihaAUu
Avenatti is nothing but a Sham Wow lawyer. Talks up a bunch of BS Leftists eat up, while making $ for himself. Leftists are fools for thinking this guy is gonna take down Prez. #MAGA2018 https://t.co/NR3q8NIBr9
From a CNN analyst...#MAGA https://t.co/1c8zG1yxqx
@therealroseanne Ok. How about born again Christians who aren‚Äôt liars, cheaters, sexual predators, etc? Check out Clint Eastwood‚Äôs ‚ÄúGran Torino‚Äù and see how he handled the Christian character. That‚Äôs how it ought to be done.
@TheRightDefense @TheSteveKon @JRubinBlogger @NBCNewsWorld Some Leftists would.
@FoxNews @TT45Pac I wonder how the Left will spin this to say ‚ÄúThanks, Obama!‚Äù Or try to discredit Prez, saying he had nothing to do with it. If anyone says that, just tell them to shut up &amp; enjoy Prez Trump until 1/20/25...and keep quiet or we‚Äôll remove term limits so he can be Prez for Life!
@lillimere @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Another example of the fake humanism of the Left. Keep these ppl away from little children.
@1withu4ever And she would‚Äôve hidden ole Bill‚Äôs escapades, too. Just because he‚Äôs old doesn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt try something with some poor young woman who would‚Äôve been powerless against them.

@NatGeoChannel They are not, no matter how much you keep saying it.
@michaelnorth @GovMikeHuckabee Ok, let‚Äôs say James Wood did exactly the same thing as Rosie. You gonna call it stupid for him to be arrested/convicted? I bet not. #Hypocrite
@PattyArquette @GovMikeHuckabee Considering the lies told by the party you support, you shouldn‚Äôt throw stones, even if Sarah Sanders did lie.
@GovMikeHuckabee @TheTruth_789 If Sleepy Sessions would get off his tail and act like an AG, she would get convicted. I hear he‚Äôs holding up to make a big impact on Nov. election, but even that‚Äôs crap. The law should not be enforced based on a darn election.
@snuf @Koalaburger @thehill He had everything to do with it. He‚Äôs gonna be re-elected and then if you fools don‚Äôt quit yapping, we‚Äôre gonna remove term limits so he can President for Life!!!! https://t.co/K8nFVSYbbS

@Joshua_Reber You watch happens when IG drops his report.
@Grim1_86 @lisalove1107 @ImmoralReport @JRubinBlogger Not everyone gets those. Manson didn‚Äôt. Rev. Jim Jones didn‚Äôt. Being a normal person does not mean your high on life. Means you see things rationally through your experiences. Which is why I know Prez will be re-elected. Just like I knew Obama would win back in March 2008.
@Grim1_86 @lisalove1107 @ImmoralReport @JRubinBlogger If don‚Äôt know how to get a natural high on life, that‚Äôs one of many things you are missing. #MAGA2018 #MAGA2020
@MZHemingway I hope the report will be released early in the week and not dumped on a Friday, so the Leftist‚Äôs news can have an excuse to ignore it/downplay it. Hit ‚Äòem hard by surprise.
@SeviRegis1 @redsteeze @CillizzaCNN @brianstelter But it‚Äôs what they do. PR folk are basically paid to lie. It doesn‚Äôt have to say that in the job description in order for it to be true.

@thehill They are trying to whip a successful Black man into ‚Äúbehaving‚Äù and keep him in Leftist chains. Kayne has broken free and more Blacks will follow because he spoke the Truth (which is NOT the twisted message the media is trying to apply to him)

@reddiamond2go If you are saying totally following a pol party is wrong, I do agree. It‚Äôs just right now Rs seem more interested in individual rights than some Ds, Who seem hell bent on taking them, thinking this will be a utopia when it‚Äôll be more like Jonestown in Guyana.
@snuf @Koalaburger @thehill No, it‚Äôs not Ok. But when women are throwing themselves at you, this can happen. But consensual is not rape. But yes, he‚Äôs about to get Jong to denuclearize. That saves a lot of ppl from horrible death. Not to mention animals, plants. That alone is worth celebrating.
@wmtudor @washingtonpost ‚Äúa sense of humility. None one of which we have seen during 16 months of deceit, subterfuge, and an appalling expression of vanity and pride.‚Äù		Yeah, from dishonest reporting from the MSM. Turn off CNN, stop reading WaPo/NY Times &amp; find your own answers. I did &amp; am happy.
@washingtonpost O please. Fake news and idiotic opinions. There is ZERO panic in the White House. You guys are gonna be real disappointed when IG report comes out and Mueller‚Äôs whole investigation collapses.
@thehill Neil Cavato, although very good when it comes to exposing Leftist BS, is a never Trumper.
@thehill Leftists are mad Blacks are leaving the Plantation. Just like Rev. Jim Jones was mad ppl left his compound in Guyana.
@reddiamond2go I know we are not in peace. That‚Äôs the way it always has been and always will be because Human Nature won‚Äôt allow it, no matter how ‚Äúsmart‚Äù humans pretend to get.
@JasonWhitesid12 @CBSNews The only thing  I ‚Äúspew‚Äù is the Truth. And here‚Äôs a few more Truth nuggets for ya- A. Prez will get Nobel Peace Prize B. Blacks are gonna switch to him C. He‚Äôll appoint more Supreme Ct. Justices D. IG report will end Mueller witch hunt. E. He‚Äôll win in a landslide in ‚Äò20. #truth
@snuf @Koalaburger @thehill Not happy with it but A: That was 2005 when he was a celeb. B. Not sexual assault because he said women were willing (and with celebs, they can be) C. Sleep is more important than dealing with yahoos on Twitter, therefore delayed response. D. The man‚Äôs saving the world. Be happy.
@jim_rsv @thehill That Scripture is more appropriately applied to Leftists, who were in charge &amp; almost ruined the US. Cohen paid w/own $, retainer $ already given to him. Not campaign $. No crime. Rich ppl have Attorney‚Äôs on retainers for such things. Many Leftists Hwood ppl do.
@JasonWhitesid12 @CBSNews Yes, and it doesn‚Äôt apply here. Enjoy Prez Trump until Jan. 20, 2025 because not only is this Stormy/Mueller BS not gonna get him unseated as Prez, he‚Äôs getting re-elected. You heard it here first.
@Grim1_86 @lisalove1107 @ImmoralReport @JRubinBlogger #IGReport will drop and this whole fake Russia collusion (now replaced by Stormy Daniels) BS will end another failed Leftist plan. You keep saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna get him!‚Äù And then all you have a big ole nothingburger with nothing cheese. Enjoy watching Trump be re-elected in 2020.

@snuf @Koalaburger @thehill Ooo, you are as scary as a cream puffüôÑ. I went out in 2016 and met the man himself in person. He is a true leader. Evidentially, all you did was sit in your poop and let the Leftist media feed you their lies. And your mentality shows you don‚Äôt have enough smarts to realize it.
@JasonWhitesid12 @CBSNews That moment when realize Avenatti Sham-Wowed you... https://t.co/a10OkvLf8t
@smalltownandrew @gaye_gallops @POTUS Leftist are Ok with sex with animals just like they are Ok with sex with little kids. They are diseased and sick minded.
@marc_strydom @CBSNews That guy made sure Blacks and their families were safe after 9-11. Stuff that Nazi shit, loser.
@CBSNews Giuliani is gaming the media. Cohen‚Äôs office was raided so he knows what they have. And don‚Äôt have. Retainer deal is legit. No campaign funds used, thus no crime. Also, he knows Comey is about to get torched by upcoming IG report. Then whole Mueller thing collapses.
@jim_rsv @thehill They were dealing with her back in 2011, way before Prez decided to run. Avenatti is nothing but a Sham-Wow salesman. No crime, no impeachment and no damn Russia collusion. Enjoy Prez Trump until 1/20/25.
@raymysterio305 @mimi2vde @reedlterry1 I just followed you, too!
@TheIndyFilm @Independent He‚Äôs shocked because the ones who expelled him have done worse than he did (just haven‚Äôt been exposed yet)
@THR Mandy Moore? So are Americans going to be portrayed as barbarians picking on those poor Japanese soldiers over that Pearl Harbor thing that Leftists like Moore thinks we deserved?
@thehill No, it‚Äôs smart. He is getting ahead of the story. They raided Cohen‚Äôs office. Giuliani knows what they have &amp; don‚Äôt have. It was retainer $, so nothing illegal. Plus, he knows Comey‚Äôs butt is about to get torched by IG‚Äôs report. Then whole Mueller witch hunt falls apart.
@EvaSofie21 @elizajane007 @THR  https://t.co/auGZyGlSTx

@EvaSofie21 @elizajane007 @THR Yeah, just like Meryl Streep ignored women‚Äôs lives being destroyed by Harvey Weinstein, right?
@THR Great. Now do Meryl Streep.
Kayne is woke! #OffendMeIn3Words
RT @therealroseanne: get your churches and synogogues/temples to volunteer to help get old ppl registered to vote and take them to polls.
@RealCandaceO Leftists are mad because Blacks are leaving their Plantation for real freedom! This is what Prez Trump promised, not no dang white supremacy garbage!
@Joshua_Reber Mueller will have nothing on Prez.
@reddiamond2go Very few ppl would disagree that financial independence = freedom. But I do agree about how the Red Congress has been doing for the most part.
@reddiamond2go No, that‚Äôs just Truth. Fair minded ppl will look at it objectively. That‚Äôs just reality. After what I‚Äôve seen the past few years, there is plenty of Blue hate. The Last part is right on.
@reddiamond2go We = fair minded ppl. 	A majority voted for a Black Prez. But when you have financial independence, you choose your neighbors. Or choose to have none at all. It‚Äôs freedom.
@sgarza0866 @KB0824KB @HoustonChron No. Human. And American.
@reddiamond2go We think that they should be free and have the financial independence so no man, including white ppl, can tell them who, what, how to think like Leftists do.
@sgarza0866 @KB0824KB @HoustonChron Yes, I do. His efforts are saving every man, woman, child, animal and plant on Earth. That includes little Black kids. So, yes, that should be celebrated.
@FoxNews @DineshDSouza Yes! Making Nobel Peace Prizes great again!
@abc13houston White Christian Trump supporter? Nope!!!! Sorry, Leftists. No false narrative this time.
@ABC Get that Nobel Peace Prize ready for our Prez, Donald Trump! Not only is he making America great again, he‚Äôs making the world safe again! Deal with it, Leftist haters (who want the world to burn.)
@sgarza0866 @KB0824KB @HoustonChron It‚Äôs not Kayne that‚Äôs stupid. It‚Äôs you.
@profblmkelley Yeah, except he meant mental slavery that Leftists keep Blacks in with lies such as ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúwhite ppl are a part of systematic racism.‚Äù Kayne is getting Blacks woke &amp; Leftists twisting of the facts won‚Äôt stop it or Prez Trump!
@HoustonChron Wrong, Hearst-led Chron. He said it ‚Äúsounds like a choice.‚Äù And then explained it is mental slavery that Blacks choose to remain in with chains such as ‚Äúwhite ppl have a system designed to keep Blacks down‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù He‚Äôs right &amp; Blacks are getting woke to your lies!
@Independent Piers is wrong on this like he is on 2ndA. They are the same.
@reddiamond2go They should be free to do as they please. But understand what the Blue Pill does and what the Red Pill does.
#IfSlaveryWereAChoice then fair minded Black folks would get up and leave the Democratic Plantation and tell their Leftist masters to go to Hell. #truth Since mental slavery is a choice (which is what Kayne was talking about) I‚Äôd recommend they do it.
@thehill ‚ÄúGrow a pair‚Äù from the most overly sensitive pack of whiner babies who still can‚Äôt accept America rejected their ‚Äúqueen‚Äù for a real leader who is getting things done. Screw You! Wolf sucked and so does Leftist comedy, which is nothing but hate nowadays.
@iZairois @thecjpearson @kanyewest Why is it every time a Conservative makes a point it‚Äôs ‚ÄúO, you got it from Fox News!‚Äù?Fox has got more diversity than the other networks together.

@BlaxbyChambliss @NathanKor @RealWendyBelle @chancetherapper @kanyewest Ending the wars is happening now. The rest has been tried by one civilization or another throughout history and has never successfully worked. That is the simple reason we don‚Äôt support them - they don‚Äôt work. But, legalizing weed has a good chance of happening by 2020.
@BlaxbyChambliss @NathanKor @RealWendyBelle @chancetherapper @kanyewest You asked about policies &amp; I shared some. Independence is found through financial freedom. Same for everyone, regardless of who they are. It‚Äôs not about saying someone is smart, dumb, etc. It‚Äôs about  enlightenment. Liberals offer victimhood mentality that leads to poverty.#truth
@BlaxbyChambliss @NathanKor @RealWendyBelle @chancetherapper @kanyewest If creating policies/cutting regulations to get unemployment for Blacks to historic lows (not to mention more money in their pockets thanks to tax cuts) isn‚Äôt enough reason then stay on the Democratic Plantation, which has helped to kill Blacks in Chicago like Kayne said.
@bradanderson052 @ABC Yeah, it is. Deal wit it, loser. Idiots like you want the world to burn.
@GreenSpringRise @ABC They wouldn't be talking if it weren't for Prez Trump. Why don't ppl like you just get the F off Twitter and go hate by yourself in the corner? Jeez...
@Mike504ever @ABC Aw, what's the matter, Mike from New Orleans? Gotta block like a bitch because you can't handle the Truth? Enjoy President Trump until Jan. 2025, loser.
@thehill The Leftist advocates got to him and told him to post something quick about Prez being a racist or else! But Kayne is laughing in their face. Career out of hate? Man, it is ignorance like this that will result in them losing...again.
@Mike504ever @ABC Yeah, let's blow up the world instead, right? Man, get lost.
@dcexaminer I thought we were an embarrassment to the world and that world leaders had nothing but contempt for Prez Trump? Did CNN, MSNBC, CBS News, ABC News, etc. lie?
@Scornpaul @missrubypugslee @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend *Leftist
@Scornpaul @missrubypugslee @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend He‚Äôs getting it because Keftist in politics and media want the ‚Äúgood ole days‚Äù of Obama to continue under Crooked Hillary but got slapped when he legitimately won. Those days are not coming back. Ever.
@peaceforourmind @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend And getting more under Prez Trump. You wanna give it back, break little Black kids‚Äô hearts cause ‚ÄúHate Trump‚Äù is your message? And you insinuate I‚Äôm ignorant...
@Scornpaul @missrubypugslee @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend So why does running a country means he has to shut up and take it? And America is prospering, but Libs hate that because their whole platform is "give away free stuff, get re-elected, do nothing, repeat"
@chancetherapper Said at the wrongest time? Who told you that shit? Ppl are dying there due to Democratic policies. There is no wrong time to say Blacks don't have to be Democrats. It is the damn Truth.Sounds like you are getting scared of what others think, the thing Kayne is calling ppl out for
@Scornpaul @missrubypugslee @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend Same could be said for NY Times, WaPo, &amp; other media. If they are going to attack him, he should be able to fire right back at them. What rule says because he's Prez means he has to "shut up &amp; take it"? If he was Liberal &amp; Tweeted the way he does, they'd all love him for it.
@Kcbblondie @ShawnnBEAM @johnlegend  https://t.co/iCKJje1dtC
@Scornpaul @jeffromcclellan @johnlegend No, he is getting it lower after Obama let it get too high. And if Prez hated Blacks, he'd sign an executive order to stop it. Why hasn't he? Because he loves Blacks more than half-white Obama did.
@jeffromcclellan @johnlegend Deregulation has led to an increase of jobs, which has helped many Blacks get jobs, more money, independence, etc. A lot of little Black kids probably appreciate the new toys their parents were able to get them thanks to Prez Trump's work. Sorry to see you don't.
@ShawnnBEAM @Kcbblondie @johnlegend Sounds like you are trying to shut my free speech down over my gender. Not very SJW of you to do that. As far as Charlottesville, he was talking about non-Nazis who didn't want history to be erased. Turn off CNN, MSNBC and turn on Fox. At least then you'd be somewhat informed.
@MissPlacedAnger @Jeannie_Hartley @johnlegend Trump celebrates fake news? https://t.co/Nbe0PSMefi
@MissPlacedAnger @Jeannie_Hartley @johnlegend When you have real proof (not Lisa Bloom-funded accusers) that Prez actually did something, then come back and show it. Until then, enjoy Prez Trump for the next 6 years, especially when he wins the Black vote in 2020!
@Kcbblondie @ShawnnBEAM @johnlegend Just like a typical Leftist, always trying to shut down free speech. Including that of free Blacks. #realracist
@jeffromcclellan @johnlegend Please explain how Black unemployment getting lower under Trump than it was under fake cool Obama is "white"? Sounds like you want Black unemployment to go up so you can justify your hatred toward them having real success. You mad bro because Blacks are leaving your "plantation"?
@Jeannie_Hartley @MissPlacedAnger @johnlegend The fact you are not celebrating Black unemployment getting lower under Trump than it was under fake cool Obama shows us that YOU are a true racist. Blacks are leaving your Plantation and your whips and chains won't stop them! #loser
@MissPlacedAnger @Jeannie_Hartley @johnlegend Because we rejected Hillary "super predator" Clinton and her rapist husband. And how has our nation gone backwards? You are a classic example of misused intelligence.
@Kcbblondie @ShawnnBEAM @johnlegend Sounds like you two want Black unemployment to go up so you can justify your hatred toward our Prez. Blacks are leaving your Plantation and there isn't diddly squat you can do about it. Enjoy President Trump for the next 6 years!
@johnlegend It's gotten lower under him. After Obama let it get pretty high (which I don't understand why guys like you are "thankful" for that). Our Prez deserves some credit and it is time for you and other haters to start showing some damn respect.
@JohnAnd39202205 @thehill Play mental gymnastics all you want. They didn't lie &amp; this is another attempt to make Black Conservatives look like liars, scum of the Earth, etc. when it's simply an untruth. They do it to Dr. Carson, Larry Elder, Wayne Dupree and now Kayne. Libs hate Blacks who are really free
@thehill Inaccurate? They were NOT paid by Trump campaign. They were reimbursed for flights. Another attempt by the racist Leftist media to discredit Blacks who won‚Äôt stay in chains on their plantation.  #fakenews
@abc13houston I owned one of those and he‚Äôs right.
@CNN You are a disgrace to real journalism.
@kanyewest Looks like the monoliths from ‚Äú2001.‚Äù
@NBCNews @NBCNewsWorld The Trump Administration was able to get this to happen. They also got China to help. Trump has probably saved every human, animal &amp; plant on this planet, all haters think about is muh Stormy Daniels, Cohen, Mueller...Blah! Get woke like Ye or be quiet!
@rgreen89 @jbu_23 @neverforgetjosh @uga_scott @2ndamendment19 @TheJordanRachel @kanyewest @johnlegend Not just personal anecdotes. It is looking past the hype &amp; see what is really happening. The media will manipulate and lie for an agenda. I know. I worked in media once. But, if you want a larger sample, be patient. You will see Prez is no dummy or a racist.
@rgreen89 @jbu_23 @neverforgetjosh @uga_scott @2ndamendment19 @TheJordanRachel @kanyewest @johnlegend I did ignore what ppl said &amp; went out in 2016 to find my own answers. I was afforded the opportunity to meet, in person, Prez Trump. We asked him about race, the Wall, etc. His answers showed love for ppl. It isn't that my "tactics" don't work. U just don't seem to want to listen
@rgreen89 @jbu_23 @neverforgetjosh @uga_scott @2ndamendment19 @TheJordanRachel @kanyewest @johnlegend No. Ellis brought up CP5, a common trick used by Trump haters to "prove" he's a racist. Ok, he put out a full-page ad after they confessed. Yes, they later recanted but to say he would not have done it if they were white is "derailing." Accept it - Prez isn't racist. He's cool.
@rgreen89 @jbu_23 @neverforgetjosh @uga_scott @2ndamendment19 @TheJordanRachel @kanyewest @johnlegend Well, since he reguirgitated the same old talking points about "Trump's a racist" that can be debunked through proper research, then, no, it is not the same thing. It is presenting facts to counter a lie. #truth

@DerekSykes17 @Shyempress @lethal5point7 @kanyewest That is not what Leftists say about minority Conservatives and you know it.
@DerekSykes17 @Shyempress @lethal5point7 @kanyewest Spreading the Truth is not a lecture. If you are not hating on your father, that is great. That is how it should be. But others on the Left do. 9 times out of 10, when ppl on the Left call one of us a "racist," they are either projecting or their arguments simply hold no water.
@DerekSykes17 @Shyempress @lethal5point7 @kanyewest Why? We are called the "Right" continually. And yes, Black/Hispanic Conservatives are treated like scum by Leftist-minded ppl. You can play ostrich all you want, but it happens. And it is bigoted, racist, disgusting and should be called out.
@greta @SharylAttkisson They don‚Äôt want The Truth to be found out.
@GeraldoRivera He‚Äôll get beat by the Rockets in the Finals.
@AP Man, hate to hear of this but if he‚Äôs guilty, it needed to happen.
@Shyempress @lethal5point7 @kanyewest You mean like Black/Hispanic Conservatives feel when they are called names/treated worse by the Left? I think ppl on the Left better check their humanity 'cos the way out of those struggles you mentioned is independence w/financial freedom like our Prez is trying to show them.
@0H0UR @realDonaldTrump Yep. About to go on a road trip in a month and this doesn't help.
@WORLDSTAR @bycycle Ye
@kanyewest It is just that his opinion spreads a false message, that our Prez and supporters are racist dirtbags, and that is not true for a majority of us. He needs to meet with Prez like you did. He might find out his opinion is incorrect.
@UnmaskedGotti @USASport24 @NFL @NFLDraft @greggrosenthal They are saying America is a bad place &amp; is racist. While racism exists here, it exists everywhere, unfortunately. Protesting social injustice is good. But not when it is directed at America. There's too much good here &amp; it overcomes the racism.Protest is fine, just not at üá∫üá∏
Hey #MAGA, I don't know about you, but I am loving these Kayne West moments. It is like a dream I don't want to wake up from... 		#MAGA2018	#MAGA2020	#kaynewest 	#TrumpTrain
@thehill I agree. Because Mueller will not find anything on Prez worth anything. And the Left will turn on Mueller just like they have Kayne.
@kanyewest John Legend doesn't understand...our Prez is not a racist. He should meet with him like you did. But good comeback, bro!
@therealroseanne Trump Hotel, of course!
@UnmaskedGotti @USASport24 @NFL @NFLDraft @greggrosenthal That "bringing awareness to social injustice" is crap. It insults Black and Hispanic LEOS/Military, not just white ppl. They died, too, for this country, under that flag. Stop supporting a racist protest disguised as a "good thing." It's a slap in the face to good ppl.
@NFL @NFLDraft @greggrosenthal My biggest question is who cares? If you guys don‚Äôt stop players from disrespecting America with their kneeling protest, then enjoy losing more of your audience, and money.

@thehill Prez is NOT going to fire Mueller. What will happen instead is the IG will release his report, and then Mueller will come out and say "We got nothing on Trump," and then the Left will turn on him like they are now doing to Kayne.

@KimKardashian This is what they do to us Prez supporters. They say we're nuts, racist &amp; all kinds of terrible things. That is not true.

@thehill It was 10 points, so his lead is evaporating.
@kanyewest Yes! Love conquers ALL!
@thehill I do not agree in any sense that Kim Jong Un is honorable. But that said, in the context of diplomacy, I can see why Prez said it. But make no mistake...Prez Trump will destroy Rocket Man's a s s if he steps out of line...and Un knows it.

Hey @Cernovich, @JackPosobiec - @trackresponse is doxing Conservatives. #block #Report
Hey @__0HOUR1_, @johncardillo, @TrumpTrain45Pac, @RepublicanWall,@vilevillainess - this person - @trackresponse is doxing Conservatives.
@JailTheTrumps It's just you and your hatred toward your white brothers and sisters. #truth
@Reuters I thought Lib Hollywood was üá∫üá∏‚Äôs moral compass? Proof that HWood blue checks aren‚Äôt all that. Reject them, painfully.
@Iwent2ivyleague @CBSNews @foxandfriends @FoxNews They did. And it still doesn‚Äôt mean shit as far as getting Prez out of office. He‚Äôs gonna be re-elected &amp; u Lib fools can stuff it. #loser
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins Now go take your knee, the rest of us good folk are going live in prosperity and peace while u fools waller in misery. #muted #racist
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins You gonna tell a little black kid ‚ÄúNaw, you can‚Äôt have more money! You gots to hate Trump!‚Äù  A loser like you probably would, U SOB racist.
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins Our Prez is working his ass off so Black families can have a better life with tax reform, etc. You stand against that, you‚Äôre racist.
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins Plus, it stirs up hatred toward good white ppl, many of whom like McNair, have done many good things for black ppl like Texans Black GM.
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúsocial injustice.‚Äù If it were, then where‚Äôs the solutions?U can‚Äôt even pinpoint the cause.
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins I understand completely. Ppl like yourself want the US Constitution/Bill of Rights removed so you can kill/jail Ppl in Right at will.
@keepkneeling @kprosco @DeAndreHopkins Well, the narrative keeps changing. Kaep said it was against America. Now it‚Äôs being ‚Äúprettied up‚Äù with ‚Äúsocial injustice.‚Äù It‚Äôs disrespect
@1withu4ever Haters gonna Hate. Shake the dust off your feet like Bible says.
@luqmannation1 @dave_spirit2001 @WhitlockJason Hey I see your friend made the news. Did you encourage him? https://t.co/2Hm8MjN9N9
@luqmannation1 @dave_spirit2001 @WhitlockJason The fact that he used MLK quotes about unity, Love &amp; you used ones to justify hate toward whites shows who the real racist in this thread is
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren After a Twitter vacation, 1) us being ‚Äúobtuse‚Äù is your own ignorant opinion 2) I‚Äôm a human not a bot. #theend #youaremuted
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 8.  Overall, stop promoting hatred toward whites. Like Blacks, they are here to stay. So you better get with it or you‚Äôll destroy yourself.
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 7. Stop standing by haters like Jemele Hill, Sharpton, etc. America has rejected these fools for a reason. They are charltans.
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 6.  White people died, maimed in Civil War to set Blacks free. Also signed Civil Rights/Fair Housing Act. They are not the damned enemy.
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 5.  Shaun King is not Black. If you seriously believe he is, there‚Äôs no hope for you for those kids you claim to love. Give up BLM today.
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 4. More whites die from heroin. You mad? I bet not.
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 3. Whites are affected more by hopelessness. Doesn‚Äôt affect u,but do you whites protesting against you over it? No. https://t.co/BlhtDwxcs0
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren 2. Cops are not killing more blacks than whites https://t.co/GIEfXqPrOm
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @Luvthe1970s @stanscott53 @Thomas1774Paine @TomiLahren This guy‚Äôs trying to give a message of hope &amp; you respond with BS.	1. Discipline deal is due to fatherlessness. Can‚Äôt blame whites for that
@MikeSilver Yes. And I do it as good as you.
@TheSpaceHamster @TrumpDog1 @Luvthe1970s @Savy2Smooth @VikingTy @TheCarterEffect @JennyVrentas @SInow When you guys apologize to the Black and Hispanics you've called "coons/sellouts" for supporting Trump, then you can talk 2 me about winning
@TrumpDog1 @Luvthe1970s @Savy2Smooth @VikingTy @TheSpaceHamster @TheCarterEffect @JennyVrentas @SInow I've read this whole thread and Spirit wins by miles. The fact you proudly say you support Obama alone shows you are a goddamn idiot. https://t.co/QjZ9Ob7kjg
@DavidCabal12 @Headerop1 @Luvthe1970s @DoleenR @thehill  https://t.co/ryoyfCbrh2
@Headerop1 @DavidCabal12 @Luvthe1970s @DoleenR @thehill Truth doesn't belong to ppl. It just IS. Not "Trumpkin" stuff, just...well...the truth.
@Headerop1 @DavidCabal12 @Luvthe1970s @DoleenR @thehill Sounds like you can't stand to hear the truth.
@Crutnacker To expose truth, all sides must be presented. Otherwise, you are just selling lies. Much like Leftists' channels are doing now...
@teenagesleuth @MichaelCohen212 Why delete it? Is it because it destroys the false "Trump is a Nazi" narrative you promote?
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill Victim? No, blessed when persecuted. Also believe in what I'm fighting for...unlike Strangio https://t.co/BEtY3wVMsH
@foxandfriends He disrespected the memory of minority 1st responders who died on 9-11 including blacks like 11yr-old Rodney Dickens,who was on Flight 77
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill 2-The Orlando shooting when it is CLEAR the culprit is radical Islam. They don't call them the "Anti-Christian Liberties Union" for nothing.
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill That was '77. This is today. My perspective is right on. ACLU has lawyers like Chase Strangio who said Christians are responsible for 1/2
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill 2- They want to take away Christians Right to Reject and tell them to shut up. They won't, just like u guys say Kaepernick shouldn't.
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill Yes, they are. I guarantee you if an LGBT wanted a caked baked at a Muslim bakery and were told No, the ACLU would defend the Muslim. 1/2
@SensibleTravel1 @Luvthe1970s @thehill They are. They want to do away with Religious Freedom (i.e. destroy Christians) https://t.co/GuIoOnoK8u
@steve_sbert66 @Luvthe1970s @ABCPolitics @SadiqKhan Well, it looks like u respect ppl that abuse women, gays and little children more than real üá∫üá∏. Get over to France with wimp Macron!!!
@EBHOMES @Luvthe1970s @OrlandCa1 @politico Man, he's right. Memorial Day is not a day to call "Happy." Stop being an ass and show respect like your relatives did.
@ChrisEdelson Man, you are a pussy Lib who can't take the truth. You think you got President Trump? You haven't got shit. #loser
@V_of_Europe  https://t.co/ZykQH9IkUg
@GayPatriot EGAD!
@VanityFair @MarkRuffalo @MarkRuffalo needs to find what he sought at that Swaggart concert years ago...it still can be found, just by seeking.
@usweekly White privileged
@NBCNews No, it is Obama's fault.
@NBCNightlyNews The Fresno Killer said "Allahu Akbar!"
@alexschmidt @Luvthe1970s @Brash_1 Are you nuts? White ppl have done more to help minorities than anyone in history. Vice is for losers. Delete your account!
@HuffingtonPost This story has been debunked, Liberals. Just like your "Russians stole the election from Hillary" BS narrative. You lost. Hope it hurts.
@BuzzFeed The fact that Liberals refer to Waters as a hero shows they have a low standard of integrity. #rejectaLibtoday
@abc13houston White, middle aged Christians? (The Lib press is hoping so...)
@ildfluer @Independent @indy100 No, he didn't. But if that upsets you, then talk about Bill Clinton the same way or STFU....Green Egg loser.
@ildfluer @Independent @indy100 No. He went to school as did a lot of Liberals 4 times and was medically covered a fifth. Legal and legit.
@shreec can't stop #MAGA.
@shreec Going against President Trump isn't üá∫üá∏. Spicer schooled you.
@shreec The only thing you are "resisting" is good things for all Americans. If Obama was that great, wouldn't have lost House, Senate &amp; WH.
@shreec Trump is still President. And your 15 minutes of shame are up. BTW - a real warrior doesn't block ppl on Twitter. #loser
@ildfluer @Independent @indy100 President Trump didnt dodge the draft like Bill Clinton did.
@AnthonyBenton7 @Independent Nope ( as false narrative collapses)
@paulruk @Independent https://t.co/D01IzwokKI
@Independent If true, just goes to prove Bannon is not the President.
@Independent Deport them, too.
@Independent @indy100 Completely different situation. Disingenuous headline.
@WayneDupreeShow How many amendments will it take to make it a good plan?
@foxandfriends @FoxNews Even if she didn't do it, how can you sleep Ok knowing your daughter died that way? She is a psycho either way.
@Independent Fake outrage. Carson is righteous. His critics are ignorant.
@geeksabre Renouncing Liberalism and turn Conservative. Stop believing "fascists" lies. It's true humanism.
@geeksabre @carlreiner I am the cure for a disease called Liberalism.
@OMETA16 @carlreiner Yes he did, especially during the SOTU. Did you boo that Navy Seal widow?
@geeksabre @carlreiner Naw, BS. A career writer should know how to spell the names of countries, even unfamiliar ones.
@mutantmutt @ABC Fake news.
@Tuna_Ghost @ABC HA HA. Fake movements die young.
@voguemagazine @lenadunham Having this nut tell us how to be normal is like having Jared Fogle tell us how to raise kids.
@ABC It is a fake movement. The real Americans have won and thought-controlling Left can't stand to see their Harmful policies get nixedüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@RT_America @RT_com The Truth slipped out. Mika's dad was N'tl Security Adv. to Carter. Said it's easier to kill 1M ppl then control them.
@greta Straight up new &amp; no idealogical garbage. Worked for decades. ABC/CBS/NBC News actually used to be respected.
@ConanOBrien @realDonaldTrump Tell them 2tear down the wall on their South border &amp; b compassionate 2those coming across like they tell us 2
@ObamaIsPres When the Rs keep House/Senate in '18 &amp; Pres. Trump defeats Dems in '20 u will know I speak the Truth. Til then, enjoy deception
@NBCNews Difference is the Tea Party is real ppl with a real cause. This is fake protesters paid by Soros who have a fake cause. #epicfail
@ObamaIsPres I'm in the business of spreading the word &amp; am more in tune w/ the ppl's mood than u. In 6 months, "Resistance" will be history
@ObamaIsPres I know by looking at comments from ppl on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, newspaper comments, etc. "Resistance" is 100% üí©
@ObamaIsPres It's reasonable 4 Prez to take a good amount of 90 M that didn't vote 4 HRC &amp; it's right 2 take those who accept. üá∫üá∏ is w/Prez.
@ObamaIsPres @Charlie11309066 Since I'm nice, I'll share w/ u the # of times "Christians" have bombed abor. clinics https://t.co/N0WbOec0WV
@ObamaIsPres @JackAdams12345 @J2Niece @politico @POLITICO_Steve U r not in the majority. SO, yes please shut up. I ask kindly...this time.
@ObamaIsPres @thehill BS. If the Am. ppl thought Libs were fit to lead, HRC would've won, and u wouldn't have lost so many House/Sen. seats
@ObamaIsPres No, ur not. 62 Mil + 90 Mil reg. voters that didn't vote + mils of HRC voters that accept results.Ur in the minority #dealwitit
@GayPatriot You mean you haven't been "Jesus shocked" yet? Well, Pence better bust a move!
@Independent She is going to spirit cook a child to cast out the "Trump demons"...
@lecristintin @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @FBI Freedom of speech doesn't apply to advocating violence like you did.
@lecristintin @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @FBI Good, 'cos you have nowhere to hide. You threatened the President and should go to jail.
Hey, @JamesOKeefeIII, @BrentBozell @MarkDice, @BlissTabitha, @AllenWest - This girl says she doesn't care if we call the FBI/SS over this - https://t.co/QLYhGs63XQ
@wilw Hey, could you block me, too? Only real Americans get blocked by Wil "I can't really act and ruined Star Trek" Wheaton. Thanks.
@windrunner537 @ChazBono @DanielleMuscato I am supporting an American, unlike you...loser.
@lecristintin @realDonaldTrump @SecretService You are really disgusting and arrogant. We'll see how you like that when they put you in jail.
@lecristintin @realDonaldTrump @SecretService I am calling on the Secret Service and the @FBI to look into your threat on our President.
@NoConversions I'm confident he'll last that long.
@windrunner537 @ChazBono @DanielleMuscato Not judging. Ascertaining. Big difference.
@lecristintin @realDonaldTrump Hmm, does the @SecretService know about what you are looking forward to?
@windrunner537 @ChazBono @DanielleMuscato He'll make it great again by getting rid of un-Americans...like yourself.
@NoConversions Followers? That's all you got? Enjoy being in pain for the next 8 years as Trump destroys your Lib fantasies.
@Str84NOH8 And by the way, Liberals kill animals and hate vegans.
@Str84NOH8 It's perfectly clear. You claim to like facts, but ignore then, therefore, you are not credible and a loser. Pretty simple.
@micblank Here is his response before you blocked him. He's right, too. https://t.co/EH6iyCz7CG
Congratulations to @RealBenCarson ! He will do an outstanding job!
@AkaMotherto3 @drrcreed Screw 3 followers. Discredit my Tweet or get the fuck off Twitter, loser. I hope 1/20/2017 is painful for u.
@Str84NOH8 For someone that claims to love facts, you do not deal with them very well. Recount, threatening electors, 2 M voters = Epic fail
@AkaMotherto3 @drrcreed For someone that supports a Lib Party that enslaves blacks/abuses children, u have no right 2 play moral superiority
@ErickFernandez @realDonaldTrump @DanielleMuscato Its a good thing he did, too. It incites war, one they'll lose badly if they "go there."
@ChazBono @DanielleMuscato Her voice is that of sore losers. Trump is going run over Libs in next 8 yrs. Get ready. #RESIST? Bullshit!
@DanielleMuscato If u believed in all that, you'd be calling out Obama and his minions on doing these very things. Ur a hypocrite loser.
@DanielleMuscato If u care about that, then let's C U call out child/women abuse on Dems side.Instead, crickets from u, therefore, hypocrite
@ErickFernandez @JMKTV U talk like this is a bad thing.He should be able to block whoever he wants.If u don't like it, take it up with @jack
#BoycottHamilton F all of you anti-Trump A-holes. HRC lost, Trump won. The End. Hope it hurts #Liberalsareintolerantbigots
@TheColourdragon Ha ha Fuck you. HRC lost so enjoy President Trump until Jan. 20, 2025, when he turns if over to Eric or maybe Ivanka.
@johnlegend Beyonce is boycotted.
@JumpVote Say, @Luvthe1970s was defending u and took some knocks doing so. Maybe consider unblocking him?
Get out and vote Trump if you truly love America. #ElectionFinalThoughts
@utopiadisytopia @Luvthe1970s @IamFran13 @AlrightyThen2 @wikileaks No, they are right on target. You are an intellectual lightweight. #TRUTH
#HillaryForPrision Misspelled or not, it has a nice ring to it...
@Luvthe1970s @bpt326 @oooobear  HRC is NOT for LGBTQ. That is her "public" position. You have voted foolishly. https://t.co/GpXcz6i1aa
@KingSarcasmo @realDonaldTrump For someone who demands evidence, you sure do ignore a lot of it. #uraomarmateenfan
@KingSarcasmo @Birdistheword44 @MelanieHannah What does OBI mean? Own Blacks Indefinitely?
@KingSarcasmo @Luvthe1970s @Ezinger44 This is Twitter, not school. Do ur own damn research &amp; discover the Truth, even if it's painful.

@burrovago The only dumbfuckery is from assholes like u. U r responsible for the evil in this world, Libtard shithead. Now go fuck yourself.
@LauraJSilverman Poor choice of words https://t.co/SxqtfldTq6
@chuckwoolery They are too busy trying to make Trump look like he is cahoots with the Russians.
@VanityFair Woody wants to keep molesting little children while Hollywood glorifies him.
@burrovago Here is something that is not a "monomyth" - U can't stand losing + judging by your Twitter feed, you have, badly. #bitchslapped
@johntylertweets Don't think you will get away with what you did. Justice is coming down on your sorry ass.
Being gay is a choice. #lovewins
Not a good day today.
Cheaters never win
If I'm nice to you and you fuck me over, your fucking toast.
I don't play when it comes to threats.
There are some motherfuckers out there that don't deserve shit.
Gotta say...bitches think they own me. They don't.
