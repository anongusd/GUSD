Interesting (possible) fact #4 from Manafort trial. Defense counsel asserted in a question that Gates defrauded Manafort of millions but offered no detail. Distraction for the jury? Or more to it?
Interesting Fact #3:  Sp Agent FINCEN, Paula Liss testified that she checked computer databases &amp; 4 multiple years neither Paul Manafort nor wife filed required FBAR reports admitting  financial interest or signature authority over foreign accounts.  2010,11,12,13,14.  Five years
Interesting fact #2: Rick Gates testified that he and Manafort communicated very frequently with Manafort by ‘email, Phone, and text’ see # 1.  They didn’t socialize.  Was one of these guys uncomfortable with the other ? Who had the problem?	This sounds like trust issues.
Interesting Fact #1 from #ManafortTrial : Rick Gates testified that he was with Manafort from 2006-2016, met him as an intern. But that the two men didn’t ‘socialize’.  So how do you go for a decade working hand in hand and stay arms length?

The President's former national security adviser is expected at US District Court shortly. The expectation is also that he will enter a guilty plea on a single false statement count. Unknown: whether there was a deal to bring narrow charge in exchange for witness cooperation.

Comey gave the key memo to law school professor to disseminate bc giving directly to media would be like feeding seagulls at the beach.
Comey used intermediary to distribute memo info about Trump request: thought it very important to get  it out.
On Trump room clearing: why would u kick the attorney general, the President's chief of staff out of a room ..( that was significant)
Why Comey wrote memos:  I was alone (w/DJT) gut feel : this is going  importantant to this organization (FBI) that I make a record of this.
comey told POTUS three times he was not under investigation.	1st time volunteered, didnt want him to think i was briefing to hang over him.
on being asked why he didnt stop the conversation over letting Michael Flynn investigaiton go : i was so stunned by the conversation
Comey on why he was uneasy about Trump loyalty requests: FBI director should be about  about the facts and the law, not patronage
