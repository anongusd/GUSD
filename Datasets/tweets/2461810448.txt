Donald Trump holding federal workers and key parts of the federal government hostage to extort more than $5 billion from Congress to build his border wall is *NOT* a national emergency.

It takes courage on a scale Trump will never understand to come forward with a story as personal as this. Dr. Blasey Ford should not be attacked, demanded, or dismissed by Trump, his Republican allies, or anyone else.
Before Trump opened his mouth (or his Twitter app), he should have done some research.		Only about one-third of all sexual assaults are reported to police. Victims cite fear of retaliation or fear that the police will do nothing to help as reasons not to come forward.

The #GOPFarmBill is just as terrible as the GOP Tax Scam.		It harms farmers; it takes away food and SNAP benefits from millions including children, veterans and active duty service members – while enriching the already ultra-wealthy.		This special interest agenda has got to stop.

Over $400 billion in corporate share buybacks have been reported thus far.		Meanwhile, workers are getting laid off — oh, and Republicans are looking to destroy Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security while also taking food away from vulnerable children.		Talk about priorities.
