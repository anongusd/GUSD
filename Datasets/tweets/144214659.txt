@saurabhtop About som ras, I can say it's still present in Himalayas but humans today don't have strength to find it,moreover it was not harmful to body
@saurabhtop We Hindus don't have alcohol and meat in our culture but today almost most of us do nd credit goes to Muslim rulers and britisher
@saurabhtop Punjab sarra barbaad hua in nashe ke Karan, government has to take step if something is harmful for society and alcohol is ?
@saurabhtop Every one in this govt is responsible for it's act, because they r representing common people and Swati opening gives a wrong message
@saurabhtop If they will ban shrab, then even media will cry foul and I am sure whether modi do or not but yogi will, it will be before Dec 18 I can bet
@saurabhtop Just a small step of banning illegal cattle selling and Congress had gone so low that they kill the cow on road and hurted nearly 1crore
@saurabhtop All the problems in society are mostly due to alcohol,so if it can be banned then it's not a problem even Bihar and Gujarat are dry states
@saurabhtop They had to lead the society most of the reforms had brought by women, moreover if a men minister could have done yogi would have done same
@saurabhtop whats wrong? She is a woman minister and she cant owe to support liquor as it is not Indian culture, already the society  is so messed up?
