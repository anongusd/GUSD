America‚Äôs infrastructure needs to be fixed. I applaud @POTUS for moving forward with a comprehensive infrastructure proposal. And I look forward to working with my colleagues on the @Transport Committee to deliver on @realDonaldTrump promise to rebuild America‚Äôs infrastructure.
@POTUS signed spending bill that increases funding for our military and war fighters. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump for his leadership on such an important issue.
The passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act is a huge win for our men and women in uniform.  After years of underfunding and budget uncertainty, we are finally able to deliver on our promise to fully fund our military and get them the resources they need to do their job.
