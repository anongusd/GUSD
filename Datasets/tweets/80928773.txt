More Life Lessons from RBG: "Don‚Äôt give way to emotions that drain your energy and do you no good. like anger, like jealousy. Be patient." And if you work in a collegial setting like a lawyer or judge, it's "very important is to have a sense of humor." That's all, folks.
RBG, A Love Story: Asked for advice to her younger self, she thinks of Marty: "Find a life partner you love. and you hold each other up. and i was blessed many times over in that way."
Liu: What's changed since you first joined the bench? RBG: I use the computer a whole lot more.
"Goodwin was with me" during Bush v. Gore, a very difficult time, RBG observes. "I forgot about that case," Justice Liu quips.
Attn @JLo Trademark Staff: "My chief justice calls me J-Liu," the California jurist tells his former boss, one-upping the Notorious RBG.
"My fear about the decision has been borne out": RBG criticizes the sweep of Roe v. Wade, which voided abortion regulations nationwide rather than just the restrictive Texas law at issue. It gave the winners everything but shocked the losers into a years' long resistance.
RBG: I showed an opinion upholding the Family Medical Leave Act to Marty. He said, "Ruth did you write this?" Nope: it was Rehnquist. "As long as one lives one can learn," she says again.
Liu: How did you ever get C.J. Rehnquist to join your 7-1 opinion opening @VMI1839 to women? RBG: "As long as one lives one can learn," noting that WHR had dissented from the women's rights cases she argued in the 1970s.
Can any justice do more pushups than you? Justice Liu asks RBG, after discussing her famous workout. "Justice Gorsuch," she replies, observing that he commutes by bicycle to the Supreme Court and is in great shape. And maybe, she adds, Chief Justice Roberts.

@ERAUSANOW @MiraSorvino @SenatorCardin @WinstonLaw @WMurphyLaw @LauraLDunnEsq What if the ERA would not have passed 2/3 of Congress without a ratification deadline? I don't know the answer--maybe nobody does--but courts are reluctant to intrude on prerogatives of other branches and might consider that question relevant under the scenario you suggest.
@ERAUSANOW @MiraSorvino @SenatorCardin The Art. V amendment process presupposes assent from a 2/3 supermajority of Congress. So would the question presented be whether the same Congress that has authority to propose an amendment to the states lacks authority to limit the time for states to act on the proposal?

@MiraSorvino The ratification deadline expired in 1982. But measures have been introduced to eliminate the deadline, including this resolution by @SenatorCardin. You'd likely need Congress to pass something like this even if 3/4 of states ratify the ERA. https://t.co/icOqGhSHQs
