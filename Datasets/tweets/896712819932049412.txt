@MsAvaArmstrong Just remember that you are üíØ percent wrong!
@AndyCalisto @MrTommyCampbell @realDonaldTrump In every continent huh? Lol
@SeanHeath18 @NancyPelosi if stating facts is whining, then you are more clueless than I thought. However after seeing your profile it explain why of your erratic comments and behavior. You are a troll not a citizen, continue watching fox and friends they have the facts. Lol #alternativefacts good life
@SeanHeath18 @NancyPelosi Complaining? Who complaint? Lol not only you are clueless you don‚Äôt know how to read either.
@SeanHeath18 @NancyPelosi Probably I don‚Äôt have all the info but im sure I‚Äôm not as clueless as you are. What‚Äôs up with the bye Felicia what are you 5. Lol
@SeanHeath18 @NancyPelosi And now you have not idea what you are talking about. Only spreading lies it‚Äôs insulting to my intelligence. Good bye
@SeanHeath18 @NancyPelosi Because is not a path to it.
@TobbieJargo @NancyPelosi 689 thousand daca students and workers. Coming from nothing. What‚Äôs your point, homeless should go to work and college? They have better benefits for it than daca recipients.
@blore_g @liz_cook1333 @SecNielsen @SteveScalise @DHSgov @POTUS @USNationalGuard @JohnCornyn @RepMcSally Actually the majority of people on USA disagree with trump. Do your research.
@Carpentersfor45 @travelingpoett @renato_mariotti @realDonaldTrump Asking for asylum is a legal channel.
@MamaNeedCupcake @SenFeinstein If they don‚Äôt qualify for asylum they send them back as a voluntary removal process.  Here is more info if you would like to know. I believe is better to inform yourself instead of believe what ignorant people say. https://t.co/N8LRtqSPCo
@ccake_jt @ChrisBehner1 @SenFeinstein ‚ÄúUnaccompanied minors‚Äù clue word #clueless
@HuffPost And all of them laugh! Laugh! Like is ok to be call fake. Sorry we all know how he is, but if all of you continue to celebrate his insults then you all deserve them.
@cdanford07 @Sissy60034906 @tedcruz @BetoORourke And that‚Äôs when you make the biggest mistake. You just used the word rewarded. Bye
@BobbieTravis11 @PattyMurray What?
@FakeNewsGazette @SenGillibrand I don‚Äôt get your point?
@themanfromghent @SenGillibrand Wrong!!!! A bipartisan bill was offered to trump the beginning of this year with money for the wall and the end of lottery visa trump didn‚Äôt accepted it and wanted more changes, changes that not even republicans agreed. He is the one who never wanted to help a BIPARTISAN bill.
@afinngirl @thueso1324 @SenGillibrand When presented trump had a meltdown and wanted more, he wanted to shape the whole immigration system he didn‚Äôt wanted to compromise or sign ‚Äúwhatever you give him‚Äù... so who killed daca TRUMP did my love. Read please you have a brain put it to use.
@afinngirl @thueso1324 @SenGillibrand A bipartisan bill was reach a few days later with money for the wall wich democrats oppose but compromise. With the end of visa lottery which democrats oppose but compromise and with a path to citizenship for daca recipients (bipartisan).....
@afinngirl @thueso1324 @SenGillibrand Let me see if I can dummy this for you. September 2017 trump ENDED daca. However he gave 6 months delay for a bipartisan bill his words ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sign anything even if I don‚Äôt like it‚Äù he presented his points of interest the wall, visa lottery, daca....
@cameronFTL @RossPalombo @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @WPLGLocal10 Really wich part was the joke? The money for the wall?, the bipartisan collaboration? Or the cease of lottery visas? Please clarify
@Dw33by @adelsonthompso1 @ABC You need votes if you gave a bill to vote for! Trump killed the proposal before it got to the senate.
@WaterBuffalo6 @PattyMurray How?
@BobbieTravis11 @PattyMurray Actually democrats agreed to the money for the wall. But he wanted to change the whole immigration system. Sorry but inform yourself
@DeleteThisPod @realDonaldTrump Besides he ended it. They aren‚Äôt accepting new applications, he can‚Äôt keep track of his own mandate. Lol
@icondreams @TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump What?!?!? What!! https://t.co/ep8vLNyMZo
@SenatorBrittain @realDonaldTrump You are a pos who is taking such a tragedy and commercializing it to fit how you feel about immigration. You are not an American, because WE Americans stand together when we need to. WE Americans don‚Äôt use others pain as leverage. Kids died yesterday as&amp;$@hole you disgust me
@KBaker540 @marcorubio @POTUS Wow the grade of misinformation in your tweet it‚Äôs just blowing my mind.
@BruceBrownSwiss @anthonydipaolo @marcorubio You do t need a wall, a wall is not going to stop ilegal immigration. Read the stats please I beg you!!!!
@scm491 @felixrm1971 @marcorubio After that trump presented a deal which it‚Äôs outrageous, not only for what entitled, but because it will change the whole immigration system. He knows dems are not going to settle for it, shitnot even republicans are. He set this to fail and now he is pointing fingers.
@scm491 @felixrm1971 @marcorubio Are you kidding!! Let me explain you how this went.. trump in camera said bring me anything I‚Äôll sign it. They brought him a bipartisan deal he finish up asking for more and calling shit holes to other nations. 1-1
@CandeLand4 @JoyAnnReid @krn7777 It‚Äôs not a path to citizenship for daca. The end
@PepmintPatty @JustaFan18 @JoyAnnReid Daca recipients don‚Äôt have a green card. The rest of your statement it‚Äôs completely correct
@greeneyes1773 @OoToxicxRaveroO @realDonaldTrump Because 2 wrongs make one right. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@MAW1212 @_RobertHoover @WPLGLocal10 I‚Äôm sorry but if you are violent towards another person you get handcuff period, battery it is against the law, furthermore a crime. It is very unfortunate the kid is paying for poor parenting, hopefully this teaches them, and hopefully the teacher file charges.
@MAW1212 @_RobertHoover @WPLGLocal10 Ooo baby not only I reproduce I raise great children, respectful, smart, dedicated, goal seekers... they would never disrespect an adult let alone be aggressive to one. That‚Äôs parenting 101, perhaps you should not reproduce, since you don‚Äôt even know the basic of respect.
@MAW1212 @_RobertHoover @WPLGLocal10 And that‚Äôs why we have this growing society. ‚ÄúNo necessity to be handcuffed‚Äù bs!! Scare the crap of him maybe that will turn him up. Since evidently parents are not parenting and babying their kids.
@Sugar7868 @WPLGLocal10 What are they doing to the kid?
@realDonaldTrump No Sr. You are using daca for your agenda. You sent a bill knowing it‚Äôs completely against what they want, so you can finger point later. While daca recipients are waiting for you to treat them with ‚Äúheart‚Äù   What happened to I‚Äôll sign anything even if I‚Äôm not in love with it
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Classic, when they don‚Äôt have any more argument and can‚Äôt win. They start insulting thinking that they‚Äôll win that way. Not knowing that insulting others make them look worst than the other.
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Lol. And there it goes the insult
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump My argument is simple he lied as usual. He said he will approve anything they throw his ways and he will take the heat. When they show him the bill he backtracked and said the bill was a pos. He didn‚Äôt approved it, bottom line he cause the #TrumpShudown
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump He didn‚Äôt approve it. What happen are you out of arguments. Because you are all over the place. Trying to prove undocumented can vote. lol trying to give me a lecture of how my government works. Lol get it together.
@Immokalee69 @PatrickAlanKel2 @AlAddictSupport @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Taking from fox and friends. Lmao. Really?
@Immokalee69 @PatrickAlanKel2 @AlAddictSupport @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Then if you don‚Äôt have time to inform yourself, stop tweeting stupidity. And that article it‚Äôs from 2015. Lol
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Bipartisan bill presented to trump at the begging of the month. The one which started the holecraziness about the shithole countries. Yes that one! Go google it. Do your job.
@Immokalee69 @PatrickAlanKel2 @AlAddictSupport @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump I understand now you listen to fox and friends. lol.
@Immokalee69 @PatrickAlanKel2 @AlAddictSupport @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/us7k5gk8o5
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump you just showed me you are brainwashed, who only hears and believes what Fox News reports. I read, I actually informed myself, I look for the info. That‚Äôs my duty as a citizen, be informed. Nothing to do with liberals. Everything to do with been an American. Do your homework
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding now. Please tell me you are kidding. You know you are a waste of time. Look the info yourself, be a good American citizen. Good bye
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Bottom line he lied. The bill offered almost 3 billions in border security. Finish with visa lottery. Limit chain migration and legalized daca. All that was exactly what he asked, and he rejected it. He lied and broke promises once again. #TrumpShutDown
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Please I beg you. Readdddddddd!!!!
@RepRWilliams @Robiwanobi And all of you hold daca hostages to get what you want. So who‚Äôs winning here. The solution it‚Äôs at the top of your fingers.
@CongCulberson @SenateDems No you didn‚Äôt do your job. Neither trump did. It‚Äôs time for a change, stop whining and point Ginger‚Äôs to who really shut down the government. #trumpshutdown
@GOPChairwoman Lol. You are funny, talking about standing up.
@PatrickAlanKel2 @AlAddictSupport @TheRoseWaterFDN @Immokalee69 @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Now that‚Äôs ridiculous! Good bye.
@Immokalee69 @Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump They put not one but two legislations. One even founded the starting of the stupid wall. Not even republicans know what the big baby wants. However, he said he will sign anything why he didn‚Äôt sign any of those bills #TrumpShutDown
@Jaykay4728 @TheRoseWaterFDN @Immokalee69 @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúI will sign anything you put in front of me, even if I don‚Äôt love it‚Äù another broken promise
@AlAddictSupport @PatrickAlanKel2 @TheRoseWaterFDN @Immokalee69 @People4Bernie @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump If they were looking for votes, daca wouldn‚Äôt be a dead bill in the senate for 10 years. None of the currently 5 bills in Congress offers an express citizenship in order to vote in the next elections. Do your homework.
@marcorubio Good at least someone is doing something. Because you are not, you don‚Äôt stand for one thing.
@Oliverstwister @realDonaldTrump Tell your military families that it weren‚Äôt the Democrats who shut down.
@ImNoAngelBaby @ABC You are that kind of human been aren‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm really trying hard not to call you names but you are putting it very hard.
@ttvi_6 @NancyPelosi They are not the typical hun. Go check the bills they have in senate, for daca.
@ttvi_6 @NancyPelosi Baby, First residency ( green cards) not able to vote. Then naturalization (citezinship) able to vote. However you don‚Äôt know how long they would have to wait in order to become citizens. Furthermore, daca votes are out of the question for 2020 and 2024.
@ourvoteswin @RevDrBarber @JoyAnnReid You insult others, and citate events that happened 150 years apart but I‚Äôm the idiot. Lol it‚Äôs fine hun I know is too much for you to handle.
@ttvi_6 @NancyPelosi You are joking right?
@2nd_doi @Lovedrea @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump So... wall is there where is daca? Your argument it‚Äôs not valid anymore. Next...
@JamesPCorney @NancyPelosi You still don‚Äôt answer my question lol #AlternativeFacts #stupidisstupid
@2nd_doi @Lovedrea @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump They presented it the founds to start the stupid wall. Read more
@terri_lamke @SenateDems @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Do you really think a wall is going to stop illegal immigration?
@ushadrons @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Thank you!!! Someone is thinking!!!
@budparker @NancyPelosi Ok please tell me you are joking. Really tell me you are joking!!!
@Flgrl28 @NancyPelosi Please I beg you to read daca regulations. Please!
@tread08 @NancyPelosi You can‚Äôt be in welfare if you are on daca.
@JamesPCorney @NancyPelosi How does it cost you?
@CynthiaLockwo13 @NancyPelosi This were kids for god sake! What is wrong with you people.
@ttvi_6 @NancyPelosi Assuming the bill they would pass offers a path to citizenship, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to vote on the next elections, perhaps some will vote in 2024.
@jrgoy @NancyPelosi Nop.
@CjonesCar @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump They have to pass a federal background check every 2 years. One, misdemeanor and bye bye daca. This people are squeaky clean. Of course they also have to be working, studying or both, and prove it to the feds before they renew.
@ourvoteswin @RevDrBarber @JoyAnnReid And in those times you‚Äôll be the one who oppress the black community because you are white. Which is the same you are doing to young Americans not born but raised in my country. Born in USA doesn‚Äôt make you American. Love for USA makes you American.
@realDonaldTrump If this was the tax bill, you wouldn‚Äôt be giving up so fast would you? Of course not, the tax bill was convenient for you. Daca it is not, you couldn‚Äôt keep your promise not even 5 days.
@realDonaldTrump That wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdaca meeting‚Äù that was an immigration meeting. Daca wasn‚Äôt the only las discuss in that meeting. Your wall, lottery visa, and what not was discuss. And that have nothing to do with the daca deal.
@KING_KNOWLEDGE @WPLGLocal10 I absolutely agree with you. But citizenship should come in a congress law form. While they are discussing, and alleging the same old excuses (border security) and now the wall. All this daca beneficiaries are waiting, and losing status.
@fader_jacob @Sarrahi15 @WPLGLocal10 I don‚Äôt see the sarcasm on it. Just hate.
@JordanDeLaGarz1 @WPLGLocal10 It‚Äôs true. However, he ended the renewal in October. We are going 3 months and he is backpedaling. You know how many have lost their status in 3 months? And if congress passes something, they way is looking is not to promising.
@marcorubio So you are saying a citizen mother can not reunite with her children in a legal way here in the USA? https://t.co/GtTKBJBjxx
@bribohan @AnswersNeeded12 @BGoochman @curiouswoman3 @SenWarren You really don‚Äôt understand one thing American children can apply for federal founds to go to college while undocumented can‚Äôt, American kids have a lot more opportunities to get into college than undocumented. So what are you talking about.
@CNN Cmon cnn that‚Äôs not news, that is obvious. What it make me question why Florida still votes for him...
@ABC putting more peopplw into Medicaid is a huge mistake legal or not legal.
@AnswersNeeded12 @bribohan @BGoochman @curiouswoman3 @SenWarren Don‚Äôt even waist your time. This person is a troll who made an account only to spread hate and lies. To miss inform people, and then call the news fake, when actually she/he is fake lol. #troll #nolife
@bribohan @BGoochman @curiouswoman3 @SenWarren Scholarships Are not paid by taxpayers sweety. They are earned! And then you cited breitbart no wonder you are so misinformed. And to finish you look at my followers and think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs important or make you popular. Lmao #peopleisstupid
@thumperalpha @SenWarren Then stop winning and start pushing for an immigration reform which make illegals pay for taxes Work legally no benefits. That will increase our economy wouldn‚Äôt it?
@alvarado_marc @SenWarren FYI daca ended. Do you read?
@littlejenlittle @SenWarren @USCIS @ICEgov Because as daca tps is pure bla bla bla. Nothing done for the past 6 years almost.
@HappyPreppers @SenWarren #alternativefacts if that‚Äôs true then why not to give them the way to do it right. Stop whining about the same troll and look for solutions. Btw daca students pay out of pocket for college. Stu
@HappyPreppers @SenWarren Actually daca is not an school permit. Such thing doesn‚Äôt exist. Lol
@bribohan @curiouswoman3 @MsJetB_77 @BGoochman @SenWarren Again with your lies. Giving wrong information to the public should be ilegal  #alternativefacts
@bribohan @BGoochman @curiouswoman3 @SenWarren College is not free for daca students. So please stu #liers #alternativefacts
@MiamiHerald @DavidJNeal @MiamiHerald video shows a woman committing battery, resisting arrest and a cop punching her in reaction.
@WPLGLocal10 @DerekShore Moron gets drunk. Act up, disturb, resist arrest, battery against an officer. Gets punched by the police and is a whole drama cmon!
@stofan_vince @SenWarren That‚Äôs the problem the republicans put the dream act to rest until next year. Again and again
@loushiffer @nowthisnews @Chuckw12 Maybe it can be taken from the presidential vacations and weekends golf getaway.
@FoxNews @POTUS How‚Äôs the left exploring it?
@cinnamongirl107 @bella_tuscany @ForThePeople9 @RandySTG @nowthisnews No better answer than this one.
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump I have friends who are doing that in Puerto Rico.
@ChooseToBFree Americans don't want to work. They feel entitled to be care for, because they are Americans. Take away the help and watch them work.
@NetworksManager Why you want to spread lies and scare people like this? #fake
@CollinRugg That's not what she said. She ask to be donated to other places who needed more than her library.
@submx8ch @RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Those post don't have nothing to do with the discussion, totally out of topic. Not worth my attention. Have a nice night.
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 And no I'm not a "liberal" at all. I'm a well educated well informed citizen that is my duty. You choose to be stupid. Goodbye.
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Oh now are all illegal aliens again no daca anymore. hunny you can't win you have no argument, when you try to troll me about my language.
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Here let me help you, from the NILC. https://t.co/yiuEXMdnQW (aren't you stupid like about right now!)
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Second daca recipients can't get any governmental help because they are no residents!! Read the article I left you. (Don't you feel stupid)
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 You were talking about all illegals no only daca. The article you post is about all illegals as well (don't you feel stupid)
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Btw the article you post it doesn't talk about welfare at all. Have you read it?
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Here read this. Is from a credible source. https://t.co/kubapZK6nl
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 You talked about coming lleve and daca. No about all illegals immigrants. Not the same
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 I already read that. However answer me how they apply with out a ss number. Explain me that.
@WesMart64768481 Yeah sure. Here to 15-20 years. However it will be legal migration. Isn't that what you all want.
@RogerRamJet1776 @RealJamesWoods @jstines3 Wrong! We don't pay for their college. They are not aloud to apply for fafsa because they are not legal. Inform yourself
@ArthurCSchaper Yes they can. And many do, a big diffeeence from our born citizens who stay home collecting disability benefits for ADHD. #TruthHurts
@maxger31 @NIVIsa4031 @Ms_Erika74 @AmericanHotLips @SparkleSoup45 @DonnaWR8 @ChristieC733 @TheTrumpLady @GaetaSusan @FemalesForTrump @jojoh888 @LVNancy That's a big lie. Read! Please do !
@cmdoctora Speak for yourself. You don't represent all Florida.
@FAIRImmigration Amnesty is a pardon given with out anything in return. Succeed is not an amnesty, is a merit base program
@BrianShawkey @CNN From Spanish parents. Born here but rise in Spain and Belgium. Lmao. Ironic or what!!!!
@Did_it_MyWay @SamiamFM @CNN And the guy was rise in Spain! How ironic is that!
@ABC An no one make any noice about this 5 years ago. #alternativefacts https://t.co/kQwYbFTFhZ
@marvc88 @BressePaula @ABC https://t.co/kQwYbFTFhZ
@angelavansoest @NancyPelosi Make the line and they will
@R3CK_415 @ABC @CNN @HillaryClinton Are you kidding?
@ABC Cmon now!We could see it during his campaign telling others Americans to bean another citizen because he was protesting. Wasn't the press
@Lisa_K_73 People like you divide us even more. But you call yourself a patriot and proud American. Sad
@DudeAsInCool @FoxNews "Left wingers believe in freedom of speech" what?
@asamjulian @DonaldJTrumpJr Even when I'm not ok with kneeling and I see it very disrespectful. It is they right. So.. is not case in there
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford You don't get it do you? It's a waste of time trying to explain you over and over the same thing. So I quit trying to make you less ignorant
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Darling. Do you understand you are talking about two different things right? You are talking about a general amnesty and that's not the deal
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford And... they are not saying to legalize the 11 M. They are talking only about 800K. That's the number of daca recipients.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford You are right. I was counting the people
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford About amnesty. You are absolutely wrong. Read the dream act. Get informed. You talking non sense
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford So as per you is only the fact they jump a fence. Even when the majority of our illegals have never jump the fence, they overstay visas
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford So, if you give me to choose heck yes I want them to have a path to citizenship instead of alouding an stranger in my country. Common sense
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford However, dreamers pass thru a background check every two years. They have to maintain themselves clean and productive.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford And I can go on and on. Be careful I'm not saying all the illegals are good people. Is everything in every culture
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Or perhaps you remember this guy. An immigrant who did it the "right way" who "wait in line" and killed hundreds of Americans. https://t.co/kgyLERCiTH
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Or maybe like this fellow American citizen. https://t.co/IlLwGZvRJz
@miamijj48 I notice that when people like you have no more argument, start calling names to others and that is a sign of lack of intelligence #dotard
@miamijj48 What would you do if you wouldn't start calling names to others.Maybe you would have an intelligent conversation or maybe you get informed.
@FoxNews @POTUS Amazing! After almost a year this guy continue to talk about Clinton. You won so be the winner and stop worrying about the looser.
@HuffPost I'm NOT ok with the kneeling issue. However, is not place for the president to say who have a job in the NFL. Read your job description
@miamijj48 Yeah yeah sure hun! Whatever it makes you happy #stupidityisfree
@fitter_knitter @HuffPost You know, you have a point. Why the anthem is play in every sport? If is not the USA team playing against another country it shouldn't play.
@miamijj48 Believe me you don't know about cuban, communism, and miami more than I do. Been in key Biscayne doesn't make you an expert.
@FoxNews @POTUS That sound very socialist to me.
@CNN Are we still rallying? Dude you won the presidency, you are done rallying. Start been the president.
@susansapienza @Annemarieowen10 @saralloveless1 @SenatorLankford That's even scarier
@FoxNews @RepJasonLewis It's call democracy.We all have the right to speak up and to voice our views. Instead to classify people as liberal, left cause they protest
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford While you have 800k daca holders ready to be citizens, who have proven they are American too. Who have pledge the flag, who we invest into.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Third. I just don't understand why would you prefer someone who doesn't know my country, it culture, language, to immigrate here.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Second what instant citizens. Daca had been in line for at least 18 years. And this is not a total amnesty it would be partial.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford First. That's not what you said in your post. You talked about those who become citizens, no those who immigrate here. Two different things
@saralloveless1 @Annemarieowen10 @susansapienza @SenatorLankford Oh! Thanks!
@DHuddlestonKY @CNN I never like mc Cain but after the latest, he seems to me becoming a patriot more and more.
@philosogran I can show you picture of whites killing illegals too. That doesn't mean all whites are bad does it?
@MooreSenate Daca ended
@emeraldrobinson bye two costumers. please tell rosita who care for your child that her services will be requested else were. Care for your own child
@THEHermanCain I understand the statement. However I believe is not right to say. And I'm pro legalizing daca recipients.
@miamijj48 What do you want to start a war with Cuba over a kid? Elian today in days have a better life in Cuba than you and I in United States.
@miamijj48 Second. Elian had a father in Cuba who claimed him. His family wouldn't allowed the police to take him and they had to use force
@miamijj48 First you can't compare. Cubans have a very different law than the rest of the immigrants. They are never illegal.
@GartrellLinda They are not accepting any more new applications for daca. Do you even listen to yourself?  And the approval is for those who are renewing
@Annemarieowen10 @susansapienza @SenatorLankford Sorry what is a bot?
@susansapienza @SenatorLankford It's sickening how people only see their part and that's it. Last time I check the worst crimes were comit√©s by Americans.
@susansapienza @SenatorLankford What about illegals victim of Americans? What about those Americans who muggle them in the country to leave them to die.
@Mikes_idea @SenatorLankford Who told you they are not going to pay. They had to pay for daca around $600 every two years, no counting lawyer fees. You are assuming
@ronakpatel924 @JerryCrowe2 @SenatorLankford She is absolutely right. Thank you ronak
@janey1792 @SenatorLankford Maybe they can apply for fafsa and go to college for free, serve tables while studying so they can pay a rent. Maybe, I don't know.
@MarcieDreyer @SenatorLankford @officialOKGOP How this is about political parties. Wait, you are Texan never mind.
@okienailor @SenatorLankford Refreshing.
@simplylorilee @Annemarieowen10 @theJulieAWard @SenatorLankford Look I know how to use my google search too. Please this is a post about daca recipients not the 11mill undocumented https://t.co/LfqU0bVmXn
@CNN By 3% still the president with the lowest approval record.
@FoxNews By 2%? He is still the president with the worst approval ratings in our history.
@Kellmaho84 @abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi I really dont care if you are or not ok with how is to immigrate "legally" you have no idea of the struggle so your opinion is irrelevant.
@Kellmaho84 @abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Actually hun. You are wrong. The enforcement have started way before the elected officials.
@Kellmaho84 @abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Fourth. trump wants to even put it harder to immigrate to United States. Taking away the family sponsors visa. Read people!!
@Kellmaho84 @abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Third it takes years to even be consider for a visa. If you are looking for something better for your kids how you will wait 10 years.
@Kellmaho84 @abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi Second is not only money. Just take your time and read the requirements for a work visa. It's almost imposible to get one
@abernathy_paige @TheTechnista @FoxNews @NancyPelosi First millions don't make it legally. That's a lie
@Wardminny10 @MiamiHerald How is that article "liberal"
@MiamiHerald Now everybody is liberal. Even when the newspaper is just trying to inform the population with out bias.
@BauguessChris @tg201115 @FoxNews Copy paste?
@FoxNews I don't understand why would you give a visa to an stranger outside my country instead of someone who is rise American. And swore my flag.
@lucindajonesV01 @FoxNews Give me the year and I tell you. Immigration laws didn't exist until 1880 or so. And they were very easy. Pay a sum of taxes and stay lol
@TEXASDENNY @FoxNews that was 1775 and 1785 right? Well guess what it didn't exist immigration laws at that time so they didn't came legally or the right way.
@BauguessChris @tg201115 @FoxNews Who said that? Absolutely no, however we do can take care of those who are here and want to work. As we also can take care of the youths
@Navyvet30yrs @FoxNews If you are talking about our ancestors. Well no they didn't came legally. And about Europe, esp√≠an have something call arraigo law
@spruett2758 @TheRealMaddog58 @kwilli1046 A legal way because of an amnesty. #stfu
@DacaDefend @supernurse962 @TheRealMaddog58 @kwilli1046 The detail is that she was a resident when she came. Watch the video.
@VivaEderos @ThinkLogic0215 @TheRealMaddog58 Watch the video again and listen when she says she was a resident!
@Defending_DACA @AdrianJacksonn @TheRealMaddog58 Thank you!! Someone have common sense
@Bonny07153714 @EmirSandoval @TheRealMaddog58 She was resident when she came. She said it
@jus1_kimberely @TheRealMaddog58 Did you watch the video?
@adjunctprofessr @TheRealMaddog58 This is a big fat lie. Did you hear her say she was a resident when she came here. Or you just didn't watch the video.
@TheRealMaddog58 Third. Come on now this lady is not even in the age parameters of daca. Again @FoxNews #FakeNews stop spreading lies please!
@TheRealMaddog58 Second she became a citizen at 18 years old because she was a resident no a daca holder
@TheRealMaddog58 First she is not and never was a daca person. She said she was a resident when she came.
@Derrekschmidt1 @TheRealMaddog58 @wemustceasefire Agree with defend daca. However this lady is to old to be a former daca recipient
@TheRealMaddog58 She have not age to be a former daca recipient. #alternativefacts
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy You are exhausting and a coward who hide behind a computer to spread stupidity and non sense. I'm not waistline my time with you.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Are you going to answer my question. Or you want me to repeat it.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Mexico is not my country. Furthermore, I do not know their immigration laws that's why is irrelevant to me. And completely out of topic.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Apparently you don't know how to read. Let me answer to you as I would answer to a five years old.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Unlike you, I already answer your question.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy No it's not. You just hiding behind my own words. Lol
@MoveOn @UNITEDWEDREAM Like hey go get your citizenship while you are getting milk and bread. #thehelliswrongwithpeople
@MoveOn @UNITEDWEDREAM It just surprises me how often people say "how come they haven't apply for citizenship" aren't they aware of their own immigration laws?
@Kathy73942403 @MoveOn @AmericasVoice Because is not path to citizenship for them. That's why they are fighting hun.
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Mexico it's not even my country it is irrelevant to me, However you won't answer a question that involves your country. Interesting.
@FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse I love how people say California should leave the union because they are not America. But that statement is the most un-American.
@liberty_grl @FoxNews @POTUS @WhiteHouse How patriotic
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Why would you prefer an stranger coming into my country, instead of giving the opportunity to someone rise as an American?
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Let me ask you another question instead.
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi And in case you say CNN is fake news. Here from the horse mouth. https://t.co/5HGSkm25d4
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Let me help you with a little fact cheat sheet. https://t.co/j86cQlB8gy
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Let me ask you something. Do you know they paid their own college out of pocket because they don't apply for fafsa or any help.
@syreline1999 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy I absolutely agree with you. Congress needs to do their job and pass a law, stop talking and more doing.
@teri_barna @airforcepam @Halle2017 @Only1SalesDiva @RockStarTrump @NancyPelosi Ok? The point?
@teri_barna @airforcepam @Halle2017 @Only1SalesDiva @RockStarTrump @NancyPelosi Agree!!! Congress should start acting and stop talking. Dream act has been in the back burner for 17years.
@PhilipH29013797 @Halle2017 @airforcepam @Only1SalesDiva @RockStarTrump @NancyPelosi Thanks for the spam.

@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Why are you complaining. Makes no sense
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy My dear follow citizen daca recipients have a social security number. Pay taxes and are fighting for a path to citizenship.
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy And this one is good for thoughts. https://t.co/D19FvlYbIt
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy They pay taxes too look! https://t.co/NH2cvyJtDx
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Look this one is from a really reliable source https://t.co/indRQc3Br3
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy https://t.co/SOSljlbga9
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy You want me to find you what you need in google. Here!
@syreline1999 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy So you are telling me you prefer to bring an unknown person to my country, instead of legalize those who are been rise here?
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Again enlighten me. What dreamers or daca recipients gets free?
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Please enlighten me with examples of free? Since you know so much
@syreline1999 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Go back where? Do you have an idea what the ban of 10 years mean to even apply to come back. The hell are you talking about?
@edbarber101658 @LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Really living on your dollarYou know they are contributing to social security retirement million of dollars and they won't be able to retire
@lwlovitt @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Another who believes all dreamers are from Mexico. God people really!!
@bigmook1967 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Because is not path. Why do you think they are complaining?
@syreline1999 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy I don't agree with legalizing 11million. But the dreamers should have a path to become legalize.
@Hilemarka @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy You would understand the frustration if you actually read about how many years of empty promises. Funny your comment been a Christian.
@eeffww123 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy That's the stupidest comment I have read. lol
@greglands @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Apply to what????
@MountWeatherEOC @lgsawyer @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Actually dreamers don't coat you a penny. They are paying you and contribute to social security for a retirement they can't get.
@LindaWilburn12 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Again if you would take the time to research how many times they heard the same crap over and over you'll understand the frustration.
@kimba060764 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy You know I understand why your interpretation but you have to know the whole story to understand why the frustration, 17 years of promises
@LindaWilburn12 @edbarber101658 @FoxNews @RCamposDuffy College free? They don't want to be citizens? Why the f they are fighting for then? Common sense people
@FoxNews @RCamposDuffy Pelosi is a liar who plays with others dreams. And only promise stuff to later break it. Less promises more doing pelosi.
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Then leave. Lol simple isn't it?
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi And he goes and blocks me, you are welcome for the tip. Lmao #stupidityisfree
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Don't take it personal hun. If you don't like my comments then you can block me. Why you haven't yet (you liked it) #fullwordsplease
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi you don't give a flying color about truth and reality why would I believe you give a flying color what twitter can translate. #poorthing
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Not even tweeter can translate your slang. You are the people trump was talking about in 2005 #stupidityisfree
@Dav4Davis @Pimp_Magnet @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi I can be a retar. But you are an ignorant. Read the info dummy
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi #alternativefacts
@kachninja Oh you are going to love this one. A dreamer paying her taxes and she is not even brown!	https://t.co/1XFc4kTrig
@kachninja https://t.co/OFccJ2KjDt
@kachninja Let me help you with more
@kachninja Look more info!	https://t.co/jJj9aTixt2
@kachninja Information morons, oh! You probably have no idea what that is. Do your duty as a citizen and inform yourselves.
@kachninja https://t.co/SD0v00scPy
@Pimp_Magnet @CharlesRBruce1 @Rambobiggs @NancyPelosi Of course you do. Remember when you retire who actually also help to pay for that.
@Pimp_Magnet @CharlesRBruce1 @Rambobiggs @NancyPelosi I have never said they are better than us. I said from many born Americans. Apparently you are one of them. Thank you for adding to my count
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi Illegal immigration. Dreamers pay for your retirement keep searching.
@WARDOG_133 @Will922000 @Rambobiggs @NancyPelosi A dead? I'm sure you meant a deal. Look for the video where she said it.
@loondale @deborahjuanita4 Breaking news: Daca ended like two weeks ago. Get informed
@Halle2017 @airforcepam @Only1SalesDiva @RockStarTrump @NancyPelosi I don't know what you are talking about but in my state they have no benefits. Sorry
@CharlesRBruce1 @Rambobiggs @Pimp_Magnet @NancyPelosi But because I know many dreamers who are a hell of a lot better people and patriots than a born American.
@CharlesRBruce1 @Rambobiggs @Pimp_Magnet @NancyPelosi I'm not a liberal, I'm an American citizen who support daca not only because is the right thing to do
@Pimp_Magnet @Dav4Davis @Rambobiggs @kachninja @NancyPelosi You really have no idea what you are talking about. #stupidityisfree
@Will922000 @Rambobiggs @NancyPelosi I'm sorry she is a lier!!! She said last week she had a deal to paaa the dream act with trump. And next day trump said it wasn't such deal.
@TonyaWhitley95 @Rambobiggs @NancyPelosi You are absolutely right. Don't pay attention to the people who chooses to be miss informed or simple make up lies to encourage hate.
@ARsRcool Aren't you the first one to tell them you don't belong here, but gets offended because they wave their country of origin. Make up your mind
@ARsRcool Make them citizens and they will wave the American flag.
@CindyTindell Any human would understand that not been used, and or lied to is not a demand is a right.
@marcorubio Pretty words, Shame that they are only that...words
@Ryan__Lockhart @HuffPost Wrong She is a Liar, and she publicly lied about getting in a deal with daca. Something trump refuse right next day. That's the real reason
@xbrazzemalx @LiaS814 @HuffPost Wrong. All of them are using daca for their convenience.
@kaceyjordan4 @MColeen75 @jalapenogxrl Apparently non of you knows how to read tweets.
@MColeen75 @jalapenogxrl I don't believe any of themI'm informing the lady why daca recipients were so upset at her. If you read the tweets you'll see for yourself.
@BreitbartNews Besides is fact first Illegal are less propende to be delinquents. Second. Dreamers can't have a crime or they will be deported.
@BreitbartNews This is just so stupid! What about the illegals who got killed by whites or American citizens or black Americans . Should we generalized?
@jalapenogxrl Read more. She lied last week saying she got a deal with trump next day trump said it wasn't any deal. That's why she is getting shout out.
@MrDane1982 You are so far from the truth, sad you are making about the sexiest
@ChadPergram She said she got a deal on the dream act for trump to come out the next day and said is not deal. She lied,and played with people
@fit_mama_j @JessicaBurress4 @FoxNews @KellyannePolls Amazing answer.
@JustWntTRUTH @TallyJazz @FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS You are talking about pears and apples
@nbcbayarea They have to pass the dream act since 2001, they have 16 years making excuses and lying to them. What you expect? Words but no action
@Lrihendry You are so wrong in every single of your statements. That I don't even know where to start. So I won't. Continue to be an ignorant.
@CNN However, a reporter gets fired because she "decapitated" trump as a joke, and trump made a fuzz about it. Double standards.
@GiveMeSprinkles Hard when you are twitting hatred stuff. Talking thru both sides of your mouth.
@jensets @skydancing8 @realDonaldTrump So no deportation and no path to citizenship. So.. what's your solution then?
@Delmas716 @NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump Im not making any assumption. That's why I wanted to clarify.
@ABC I'm confused https://t.co/WOlTatDSUI
@Danniirenephoto @CNN How the ... is your money!!!???
@_NestorRuiz @UNITEDWEDREAM I don't understand. How is a target?
@Delmas716 @NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump Excuse me?
@bwtovich @realDonaldTrump @gerardamo2 No I haven't seen it. However are you going to judge 800 thousand young Americans for what a few did? That's not very bright is it?
@CharlotteLaws @Merma_bixies @realDonaldTrump I just don't know if is worthy to continue to try to educate people. Is like they like to be misinformed. The worst part is that they spread
@Phillip_H_Davis @SanMateogirl11 @LVNancy @realDonaldTrump @ChristieC733 @steph93065 @carrieksada @SandraTXAS @phil200269 @TheMeemStreams @Jason67Patriot @crusher614 @AmericanHotLips @SpecialKMB1969 They are taxpayers #anothermoron
@NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump Four. You need to get informed, before you start talking about others with out the correct info. You know you can even use google.
@NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump Third. A citizen can apply governmental help in order to pay for college. Dreamers can't because they can't get any governmental help.
@NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump Second. If you are a dreamer is not free college.many States make them pay out of state fees regardless of how long they lived in it.
@NightShiftNews @realDonaldTrump First is not path to citizenship for dreamers. That's why they are on the streets trying to senate finally pass a law.
@jensets @skydancing8 @realDonaldTrump What? What kind of comparison is that. #clueless
@barelypolitix By 3%. Lol. #alternativefacts
@wakeuppatriots1 @CNN Is actually not a federal crime is a misdemeanor. And I'm not a liberal I just read and inform myself, like a good American citizen would do
@AdrieMejia @CNN Tell the kids in the ghetto to go to college and get prepared. If undocumented youths with everything against them could do it, well...
@FoxNews You should at least take the time to put the latest chart of the storm as this one is not accurate.
@FLGovScott @wsvn I guess we can thanks the state for been a non fault state. Always side with the employer = money.
@FLGovScott @wsvn We will be away from our family, and when is true we choose this career to help, is not fun when your employer obligates you or be fired
@FLGovScott @wsvn Dear governor, I'm working today from 5pm until the storm clear as all the staff at the hospital I work for.
@connielucashill @FoxNews Still uphold my statement. Thanks anyways.
@connielucashill @FoxNews Again they would do anything for ratings, turning everything political and trying to kiss trump a**
@nowthisnews Thank you!
@combatcook3381 @tmengd @nowthisnews @NancyPelosi He was!
@MarshallBuford1 @nowthisnews Really? Why do you think they are fastening. #stupiditsfree
@TomThorsen2 @nowthisnews @NancyPelosi They are playing with the same bs for 10 years. "We will talk about undocumented after we secure our borders" never happens. Stfu
@charles18522581 @nowthisnews @NancyPelosi What open borders. Did you even listen to his speech?
@FoxNews Wow really you would do anything for ratings. #gross #alternativefacts #FakeNews
@nynole55 @FoxNews Did you read the comment?
@HuffPost Who the heck is she, I just google her and she is a blogger from Philippines parents. @FoxNews you'll find anybody to get some ratings #smh
@Vine_da_Great @xtinajodie @HuffPost You just don't go and get your papers. money is not the only issue.
@ScottSpeaksStuf @feb101957 @HuffPost Actually you are wrong in all of what you say. But also is worthless explaining you the economic, labor force, etc of our infrastructure
@TheMarkRomano Actually you are wayyyyy wrong.
@chuckwoolery Because... nvm. Go check the dream act bill. Which congress failed to pass for the past 5-7 years.
@ChristopherHull Then make them stay in line for 15 years to become a citizen. Like rac bill says. But at least give them that opportunity.
@MalcolmOakley @nowthisnews Congress fail to step up when obama asked to pass a law. What does it make you think congress would act different now? #dreamact
@PatrickTHardin1 @nowthisnews Be careful they could be the ones who take care of you and yours.
@RebekahWorsham And calls everybody who disagree snowflakes and liberals. How sad, I'm glad you are part of the minority, you aren't a real American #sad
@RebekahWorsham Classic person who talk non sense based in no facts and when someone nicely try to give them another view, she insults
@nettatrends44 @Lc2015Nancy @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson I don't know what you are talking about. But Americans citizens can apply for fafsa and other grants. While daca holders can't. #read
@nettatrends44 @Lc2015Nancy @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson That's bs! Most of them work to pay that tuition out of pocket. Maybe Americans youth can learn something from the daca holders.
@Lc2015Nancy @cons13738656 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Let me ask you Nancy. In your brilliant comment, how they would become legal? What law they can apply in order to do so?
@Read_N_Learn @FoxNews @POTUS Now you have hard workers and American youths not in paper preparing for the future and you give them the back. #notsmart
@Read_N_Learn @FoxNews @POTUS That's the problem American has been counted first and still choose the easier way.
@Sarah82890 @BradSmi @RepGutierrez How come, young undocumented under daca are working and studying like nothing. But Americans born here can't? #CommonSense
@Sarah82890 @BradSmi @RepGutierrez They can work legally, they have a work permit. And Most Americans are in welfare because they want to and because is easier
@RobGuid @BradSmi Read then you'll understand
@INTJutsu How can they open 700k jobs if is only 800k daca holders? Are you telling me 90% of daca holder works for zuckerberg? Lol #alternativefacts
@RobinEnochs @AngeloJohnGage Careful, don't get sick and be treated by a daca holder. #stupidty
@sam317777 @daherr10 @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump The best part is that those kids will finish in wellfear and/or dcf because of the absence of the parent. Lol
@DiversityGoys @ricknajera @daherr10 @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/DLTM2q1OFs
@Sarah82890 @MonicaLogallmon @BradSmi Again with the same comment. They can work legally!! Go get a book üòî
@javega72 @BradSmi @RepGutierrez Opportunity for black Americans? Lol. No sense.
@val_wonders @BradSmi @RepGutierrez Part of a gang = you loose daca and get deported. However I'll be curious how do you know the legal status of members of a gang?
@Sarah82890 @BradSmi @RepGutierrez Dreamers can work legally hun
@RobGuid @BradSmi Go get them dreamers are not taking them away from anybody. They have the willing to prepare and to for it. It's not handle for them.
@MaryPatriotNews That's what they are fighting for a path to citizenship. Or what you think they are protesting for? #commonsense
@MaryPatriotNews I love how people see it so simple. Wait let me go to the market and get my citizenship. It's not path to citizenship for #daca
@AngieB205 @ABC I've never insulted you. I just advice you to get a book so you know what you are talking about I didn't know knowledge was an insult to you
@KJVBAPTIST @t4d09 @AlexaLo45996613 @ABC Let's put your kids in jail for your dui! Should we? That's what you are proposing so since you are so American u should serve as example
@MediaOfTheLame @Bluntnun @ABC They didn't their parents did so that card doesn't play in here baby
@AngieB205 @ABC Hey happy. Go get a book! You need it
@JanHale19 @ABC @Cassand29017794 Not only children young adults who have been in USA since they are toddlers. this is their country the only one they know
@SilviaxLej @CharlieIntenn Are you for real?
@itbtthteiem @ndn They pay in state fees which is hundred of dollars per semester. So comparing the citizens have way to easy to go to college
@itbtthteiem @ndn However this "illegals" have nothing of this. They actually work to pay out of pocket in order to get an education.
@itbtthteiem @ndn Well Americans citizens have scholarships, FAFSA, governmental help, and so on to go to college many of them don't pay one penny
RT @AdamParkhomenko: Seeing the photos out of Charlottesville tonight reminds me of this from @ava's documentary. https://t.co/n6Y6NOZvCe
