Here are SW border apprehension numbers for FY18: https://t.co/fN8cUCY9zG
Not saying that it’s not news that there has been, DHS says, a 110% increase in people claiming to be family when they are not. But for the Washington Examiner to not include a tiny bit of context on total figures is irresponsible and lazy. Total apprehension numbers are online.
Fwiw I asked the DHS spox about this and confirmed that it’s not the policy to just release ANY migrant traveling with a kid, and that maybe it wasn’t written as clearly as it could’ve been. (Again, ANY in all caps, underlined and bolded)
DHS itself is spreading the untrue statement that people can bring kids to the border, claim they’re their own and get released, even though that’s not the policy and they acknowledge they do, in fact, detect and separate fraudulent families.
DHS email also said that "Aliens know that if they bring ANY minor with them they will be apprehended by Border Patrol and released into the interior of the United States,” with ANY bolded and underlined. Notably this is not true. Fraudulent families aren’t released.
Washington Examiner publishing a DHS spox email here with zero added context. For reference, this is 507 illegitimate family units of ~64k family units apprehended by Border Patrol in this period		That’s 0.8% of the total (less if you include family units at ports of entry) https://t.co/nMqASxYO7S

As I said, I realize this sounds like a drama queen thing, and I know it wasn’t a big deal. My point is to say it gets exhausting. These dumb small things are exhausting.
The guy didn’t, thank god. I left and it was fine, and I felt dumb for being scared. I’m sure he was a perfectly nice guy and I knew what he did wasn’t wrong. But doesn’t it suck to feel like you have to be on guard? Just in case someone isn’t?
I went to get my suitcase at the front desk so I could change into plane clothes and leave. And I had to walk back by the bar to this bathroom that felt kind of secluded. I feel dumb saying it, but I got kind of scared. I was worried he would follow me.
I realize that picking up someone’s tab is a quasi-nice thing to do. But people who do that probably want something. You to talk to them, for example. The polite thing to do would be to say thanks, but I felt very aware of being alone. So I didn’t even make eye contact.
This was fine, whatever, I didn’t think about it. Then, when I went to pay, the bartender kind of sheepishly told me that the man had picked up my tab. I asked why and he said the guy said I made him laugh. (By…reading a book at a bar? Ok.)
A man came up behind me to order something and then touched me on the shoulder and said “you’re not supposed to use technology while you eat!” I did not particularly appreciate being touched but did one of those friendly laughs. He went away.
I have a story that’s going to sound like me being a drama queen to a lot of people, from the other day. Going to share it anyway. So, I was traveling for work and having dinner at a hotel bar before going to the airport. I was reading on my kindle and having a burger. Pleasant!

Jonathan White of HHS, who notably is a licensed social worker: "There’s no question that separation of children from parents entails significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child.” https://t.co/3PLpmbSXue
The official coordinating family reunifications says he and others warned over past year that separating immigrant families could cause serious trauma for kids https://t.co/3PLpmbSXue
Vote Jeff! https://t.co/8zgDYGJGKa
HHS official Jonathan White said he raised concerns about family separation, was told there was no policy that would result in family separation. He said that separation of children from their parents entails potential for trauma.
Sen Blumenthal asked who was responsible for family separations. Silence, until DOJ official said Sessions issued the zero tolerance memo.
GOP senators sometimes seem to be trying very hard to get government officials to give a really simplistic answer for why people come here illegally (like “it’s the Flores agreement! It’s DACA!”). Often officials tell them it’s a complicated array of push and pull factors.
HHS’s Jonathan White talked about the level of danger in Central America and said that’s why some parents agree to leave their children in the US when deported. Tone felt different from ICE official Albence who has framed it as the parents as successfully completing smuggling act
Hirono asked officials gift if they’d send their kids to family immigrant detention centers. ICE’s Albence didn’t really answer; USCIS’s Higgins said it’s difficult to put herself in a position of someone who would take child on dangerous journey where they could be harmed

HHS’s Jonathan White says as of when he left ORR a few weeks before zero tolerance began, he was told US policy was not to separate families. BUT said there had been in discussions for more than a year of policies that could result in separation of children from parents.
Annnnd Cornyn is using the oversight hearing on family separations to talk about Abolish ICE
Leahy pressing officials on why some govt. couldn’t match some parents with kids. 		CBP says they put family in reports 		ICE says they know where ppl in ICE custody are but not if they’re out		HHS says there “remain a few” kids in custody w/ parent location unknown

Grassley calls for ending limits on how long kids can be detained with their parents. Also says they don't want to see families kept in federal custody indefinitely or for long periods of time. His argument is detained cases move more quickly.
Grassley says he’s “disturbed” by the allegations that some parents signed away their ability to reunite with their kids without understanding.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley called the “zero tolerance” policy “well-intentioned” but said it had “unintended consequences” like separating families. 		Unintended, eh?
