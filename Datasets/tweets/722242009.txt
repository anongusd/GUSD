@RobBurl And while you're here, Rob, can you please explain BBC's rules on impartiality and how these do not apply to @afneil? I am honestly baffled and it would be really helpful if could illuminate. Thank you
@RobBurl There's an outstanding editorial complaint regarding your interview of Banks on Marr.
@hugorifkind @afneil Good to hear. But both these people worked in office. Very different being an employee to a freelance columnist . If it’s not true, it’s a simple matter for @afneil to rebut
@zelo_street @spectator Lol...
@RobertCPalmer13 Wow. I didn’t know this. Where is this cited?
New report in NYTimes today that FBI launched counterintelligence op into Trump after he fired Comey. His associates - &amp; their connections to Russia - must all be under scrutiny. Why won’t govt answer @DamianCollins’ committee qs on what our intel services are doing?? https://t.co/TWbJACC7bC
Or what about this? "The idea that Andrew is not responsible for content at the Spectator is...laughably false." "The editors were frankly a little scared of Andrew." Any comment, @afneil? You've said you had NOTHING to do with content. Yet, these 2 people are calling you a liar https://t.co/vt3szR5BcC
'...he shapes the agenda by his contempt for anyone and anything that challenges his right-wing, ultra-capitalist world-view. He wishes the Spectator was the Economist and that Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. He has drained the magazine of gentleness and joy.'

"He was raising Spectator matters which are not my responsibility," says the Spectator's chairman. You sure about that, @afneil? Because ex-Spectator employees have started getting in touch...&amp; that's not what they're saying. https://t.co/fmBy6cCjHE
Within minutes of posting this, this is misogynistic bile I get. It's you @afneil who did this. &amp; @BBC who sanctioned it &amp; protected him. And I'm sick of it. It's not just me, it's all women doing any job in public life, inc #BBCwomen 	https://t.co/YrltTOGbQ6
Andrew Neil describes Owen Jones questions about his relationship with the Spectator as ‘smears &amp; lies’. Smears &amp; lies is what you directed at me, @afneil. These were facts. The BBC has rules on presenter impartiality. What is baffling is why they don’t apply to Neil https://t.co/SBmCq59TLT
@katzy @guardian He put them in a trust shortly afterwards. The most likely explanation to both of these is coincidence...but @parmca's refusal to answer repeated press inquiries &amp; @facebook's refusal to say who knew what when is...problematic
@fascinatorfun @lindarich48 @facebook @nick_clegg All good questions. You can drive a truck through the holes in Facebook's new transparency rules. They just don't work.

So this was the basis of the guilty plea. I’ve got to say this does not smell good. There seems to be no intention to actually hand over @profcarroll’s data. Was pleading guilty just easiest way of getting off hook &amp; not answering qs in open court? https://t.co/OdpbfOBMDf
Judge fines Cambridge Analytica £15,000 plus costs. A piddling amount. But, it's important because these laws mean nothing if they're not enforced. Much bigger question is:they've pleaded guilty so are they now finally going to hand over the data? Or is this just another ruse?

Here’s what I don’t understand. In any other UK election, if criminality uncovered, the result would be set aside. The referendum only election to lack that legislation. Farage is spouting bollocks. But he’s NEVER challenged on it. It’s not the democratic will. It’s a crime. https://t.co/wcc3zkpOWR

Adding this because it’s clear that @EmilyThornberry does understand the issues. As defence secretary she was ahead of the curve. It makes the front bench silence on this is even more disturbing. https://t.co/pWhwBekUF4
@FromSteveHowell @_tony_c_ I'm sure Milne is perfectly capable of writing to me. And political opinion can be a threat to national security. It's why the Mueller in the US is trying to unravel the Trump adminstration's links to Russia.
@0Calamity Rant away. That's a very good round-up. The point is that Milne is pro-Putin &amp; the Tories (&amp; new Labour figures) have been financially reliant on Russian oligarchs. One does not cancel out the other.
@organic58 I didn't, actually. Someone pointed that out and it's very interesting. He obviously understands the issues and the implications yet nonetheless almost the entire front bench has been silent on the issue of foreign interference in referendum. Are you not curious why ?

I salute you sir. For your indefatigability https://t.co/2pRr2BBkGZ
@jk_rowling It also underscores how little reporting it has done on the mass criminality, dark money, foreign interference &amp; ongoing investigations. There is no way any news organisation that has done its job could - or should - write ‘will of the people’

...and to the heroic @shahmiruk for explaining the depth of British corruption. And the great @ProfessorShaw for explaining why the US takes this seriously. And we don't. And huge thanks to @peterjukes &amp; @SRAColegrave for organising.
But there are people who care. Deeply. Who can see what is going on in Britain. And are deeply troubled by it. 👏👏👏Thank you so much to special guests @DamianCollins @DavidLammy &amp; @Billbrowder last night for explaining to a brilliant audience why Britain needs a Mueller inquiry
Is this all just a big coincidence? Who knows? Certainly no-one in Britain. Because here there is a blanket of total silence over it all. I mean why would anyone want to know why Farage's aide would plead guilty to "advertising money laundering services" on the dark web? https://t.co/XLERt2BCeZ
But that's not all. Because on July 22, the day after, and the same day of DNC leaks, Nigel Farage's chief aide &amp; UKIP's main fundraiser is busted by federal agents for money laundering, wire fraud, blackmail &amp; extortion 	https://t.co/2HwBODRiqa
Mess-up the thread so trying again. Because things happened after that dinner at the Republican convention, July 18-21. One day later, Wikileaks released the DNC emails hacked by Russia. And, then, on Aug 4, Jones &amp; Stone started trailing the next set of leaks... https://t.co/Tvjcx9Inxd
Last night, @DamianCollins &amp; @DavidLammy &amp; @Billbrowder came together to make a powerful &amp; passionate cross-party call: for Britain to have its own Mueller-style inquiry. Here's why. This chilling "institutional silence" cannot go on, says Lammy. https://t.co/Ojo26DRFI6
@brexit_sham @Nigel_Farage Yes. That Ted Malloch. But back to the meeting with the man who asked Jerome Corsi to get Assange's emails. And Jerome Corsi's boss. Days later, Wikileaks released the DNC emails. And on same day @Nigel_farage's chief aide was busted for money laundering..	https://t.co/2HwBODRiqa
Farage's version of what happened at that dinner and how it came about is completely at odds with two accounts told to @ObserverUK. Farage said he bumped into Stone "by chance". Not true say the team of film-makers trailing Stone at the time...		https://t.co/m7UegsNnEM
On Sunday, @ObserverUK set out key new details about a key meeting @nigel_farage had on a key date with key people. Dinner with Roger Stone, days before Wikileaks released the DNC emails. Also present: Jerome Corsi's boss, Alex Jones 	https://t.co/HkOzQ4AWit
This looks very significant. The email was sent from InfoWars' Jerome Corsi to Malloch, an American academic, who is based in London. Where does @nigel_farage fit in? Well, he's right in the middle of this tight little web... https://t.co/PckScOYga2
NEW: Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation about to explode on @nigel_farage's doorstep. A leak from a draft legal doc indicates his associate Ted Malloch was told by key Trump advisor, Roger Stone, to "get to Assange" &amp; "get the pending Wikileaks" emails		https://t.co/FfGR51tyFy

.@DamianCollins on the docs: "Clearly huge public interest about issues that are fundamental to the way Facebook works" And he throws it back at Facebook. Suggests onus should be on Facebook to withdraw anti-SLAPP petition to the US judge &amp; let docs be published
Great question from @aliya__ram: "I'd to talk about anti-trust. There are eight countries represented here. Could we have a show of hands how many of you think that Facebook should be broken up?"
Bob Zimmer, Canada MP: "Facebook still don't get it. Question is if they are pretending to not get it."
.@damiancollins asked if he "violated legal norms" by seizing the docs. Collins says committee followed established procedure, believed docs contained vital info of public interest, &amp; that Facebook had failed repeatedly to answer its qs. "The buck stops with zuck"
CNN @hadasgold: "How did you know Mr Kramer was in the country?" @DamianCollins: "We learned he was in the country. And we'd obviously been following the case."
This goes to the nub of the whole thing	@DamianCollins: "Hugely disrespectful of Zuck not to show up. Facebook should tell the court to seal the docs. What does Facebook have to hide? "
Canadian Bob Zimmer: We represent 400 million. Let that sink in. We need to hear from the CEO. He made the decisions. There were so many questions that were not answered."
Press conference: @damiancollins "We're not yet ready to publish the seized documents because we need to go through them properly/redact etc. I promise you we will publish them. Very soon. Certainly within the next week."
Lord Allan: "We can't turn the internet off."	@DamianCollins: "The internet is not Facebook." 	Final words. Hearing over. Pretty much sums it up.
Canadian MP: "What's being described here sounds like corporate fraud. Perhaps the simplest form of regulation would be to break Facebook up. Will Zuck talk anti-trust?"	Lord Allan: "It depends on the problem we are trying to solve"	MP: "What if the problem is Facebook?"

Mueller's indictments show this was exactly when the Kremlin set up troll factory to target US voters. Why wasn't this disclosed to congress?? What else isn't it telling us? https://t.co/x2yzsb1fPo
Astonishing answer from Lord Allan giving his opinion on what may or may not have been of consequence or affected the result of the US election.
"Who at Facebook suggested you come today?" Lord Allan: "I volunteered."	"Really?So you've read all the answers given in parliament and all the times, Facebook said 'I'll write to you with that answer.' Yet how many times have you said today, 'I'll with to you with that answer'?"
Lord Allan: "The people I work with are decent and sincere and I don't recognise this description of the idea that people at the company are operating some vast conspiracy."

Paul Farrelly: "Has Facebook ever taken advice on possible RICO offences?"	Lord Allan: "Not that I'm aware of"
Paul Farrelly MP: "I've read the summary of these documents and the thought I have is RICO. Racketeering. What do you say to that?"

Final bit of "context": @Guardian &amp; @CNN joined forces and filed brief to try &amp; get these docs unsealed in public interest. That had nothing to do with merits or otherwise of Six4Three's claim.
...and remember, @Facebook, MPs have asked you questions about who knew what when re Cambridge Analytica scandal multiple times. And you've failed to answer. These docs go to older decisions. But same issue. So yes, worrying about "parliamentary privilege" is probably wise https://t.co/LOm3OSFdA3
And this is interesting. Facebook saying "We got a whole load of shit for sharing users' data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal...&amp; these guys had an app that relied upon users' data!" Nail on head, Facebook. It's how these decisions were made that goes to heart of issue... https://t.co/YZy75RlBXO
But this is fair enough. It is important that "claims made in a commercial case are not taken at face value". Quite so. That's presumably why Parliament wished to see the underlying evidence. Which it now has https://t.co/IoUku45csT
The "context", says Facebook, is that this is some "bikini app". The problem with this as a line of argument for Facebook is that this has bugger all to do with why Parliament has seized the docs. The "context" is actually Mark Zuckerberg's refusal to answer MPs questions https://t.co/BpbDu2r1zL
...So let's examine. Firstly, note this is from Richard Allan. He's the ex-MP turned lobbyist who is facing MPs questions on Tuesday. He's sent this to @DamianCollins (&amp; me) to explain the "context" https://t.co/56eyMfJ1vf

Dog needs to be walked..so ending this here. But this is where it all began. My first article on Farage. These questions still not answered. The timing of Farage's visit to Assange &amp; the Vault 7 leak minutes later... just so strange. 	https://t.co/RKokxJF1qf
And see this. From the Roger Stone film-makers. Farage refused to let them film. But here's what he says about Alex Jones did next. What Roger Stone did next. They talked about Wikileaks. About upcoming leaks. They appeared to have inside info. https://t.co/5rwcUMi3gL
What did Alex Jones know? It's his friend &amp; InfoWars correspondent, Jerome Corsi who is negotiating plea deal with Mueller. Watch Farage &amp; Jones chat Russia &amp; more here. "You're the guy," Jones tells Farage. He was critical to Trump's victory, he says	https://t.co/SRPitp6lGe
Remember, it's Wikileaks that is key. And who knew what when. Also remember: there are so many threads in Mueller's investigation that lead through London	https://t.co/fRWQ6SUFsF
@sarah_donaldson Ha! I know...I thought I might do it for the 2 year anniversary. (V soon)
But! The weirdness does not stop there. Oh no. Here's where we reported in June that Andy Wigmore (Farage key associate) sent confidential legal docs relating to George Cottrell including his federal indictment...to the Russian embassy. What the..?!*?!		https://t.co/OCCMOjw70M
The whole George Cottrell story is extraordinarily weird. Nigel Farage's aide &amp; UKIP fundraiser is arrested for money-laundering. On day DNC leaks drop. And hours after meeting Roger Stone &amp; Alex Jones in Cleveland. Read this by @nicohines on "Posh George"	https://t.co/2HwBODRiqa
2) Federal agents arrested Nigel Farage's aide as he stepped off flight by Nigel Farage's side in Chicago. For money laundering, wire fraud, blackmail &amp; more.  Here's Arron Banks (&amp; Isabel Oakeshott's) report in Bad Boys of Brexit. https://t.co/aJUN3If9Fl
One day later, 2 extraordinary things happened:	1) Wikileaks releases the DNC emails throwing the Democratic convention into turmoil..	https://t.co/wkFhLCH4Xw
But that is not what happened, the film-makers tell me. The dinner was planned in advance. They travelled with Stone to it &amp; met Farage there. Who insisted they could not film. Now, notice the dates: this was during Republican convention, July 18-21, 2016 https://t.co/8XmFyInW6v
Farage's spokesman says here: “Nigel met Roger Stone in a restaurant in Cleveland during the RNC purely by chance. They subsequently met each other in a hotel in Washington during Trump’s inauguration, again without planning and by chance.”	https://t.co/ZW0jLgYA8i
And here's where it gets interesting. One of the film-makers behind Get Me Roger Stone told me about a dinner Roger Stone had in July 2016  with Nigel Farage and Alex Jones. There's a lot of fascinating things about this dinner... https://t.co/oKmPDnSeNe
You need to understand who Roger Stone is. He worked for Nixon &amp; has played a role in almost every political scandal since. What he &amp; his associates knew when is one of the focuses of Mueller's investigation into Trump-Russia. And indictments are coming...	https://t.co/UWz68Cr7EX
In Britain, Nigel Farage is that bloke off the telly. The tweed coat. The good lunches. The pint. But it's time to re-evaluate. And here's where to start. With Roger Stone. A central point of the Mueller investigation. This documentary is amazing. Watch it	https://t.co/0V1gjXpyHD

But THIS caught my eye. November 18. The day LeaveEU launched its press campaign. The same day @arron_banks &amp; @andywigmore went to Russian embassy &amp; were intro-ed to gold &amp; diamond deals.

@newswatchbbc @JohntNeal @SamiraAhmedUK Grand.

To be clear, what is is amazing about this is that all of us @arron_banks watchers had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA about the involvement any company called Ural Properties. The own goalness of this is off the scales. Chapeau, Arron. And thank you

Watch this. Very very strong words from Elizabeth Denham, UK Information Commissioner, as landmark report on data in politics published (&amp; US goes to the polls). Forget the word "data". It's "power". This is abuse of power. By parties across the spectrum. Politicians MUST now act https://t.co/7r8iu1Dq2D
@andywigmore Ah! So I'm leading you by the nose? Is that it?
10/ So that's 9 investigations into crimes committed in EURef or suspected crimes involving National Crime Agency (x2), Met police (x3), ICO (x3). Note this Sunday @observerUK &amp; @openDemocracy published new stories about new allegations, new crimes 		https://t.co/0QAKRX0psF
9/ Have I finished? No, I have not. And nor has the ICO. Its investigation into UKIP &amp; Cambridge Analytica is ongoing. UKIP has refused to co-operate &amp; appealed to high court. Which dismissed it. (This is the invoice that @observerUK established @arron_banks paid for) https://t.co/NET6XCHB4J
8/ Important to be equal opportunities about this. I'm always being asked why I'm not investigating Remain. Well, I didn't know of any crimes. But here's one, new today: Lib Dems fined for selling the personal data of 100,000 members to the Remain campaign	https://t.co/brgvEa7tsM
7/ And then there's dear @darrengrimes_, the head of BeLeave, who's ALSO been fined £20,000 &amp; referred to the Met police. Note, Vote Leave/BeLeave's crimes are believed to be biggest UK electoral fraud of modern times. And it only made no.7 on the list....	https://t.co/DmX6DIGk4u
6/ To recap: that's FIVE official investigations into @arron_banks &amp; @nigel_farage's LeaveEU campaign. But then there's Vote Leave...the official campaign headed by @BorisJohnson &amp; @michaelgove who have ALSO been fined £61,000 &amp; referred to the Met police	https://t.co/SFHQ4uWoKV
5/ But that's not the end of it. No. Not even into @arron_banks. There's a FIFTH investigation: into possible business deals brokered by Russian embassy. The DCMS committee has said it "understands" this is also being investigated by NCA https://t.co/aq4HuJdQq3
4/ So, that's the NCA, the Met Police &amp; the ICO who are all investigating Banks...AND the FCA. So many acronyms, @arron_banks! This is a new investigation reported this weekend by the Financial Conduct Authority which regulates the insurance industry	 https://t.co/Fcu8SSvJX7
3/ The investigation into Banks' finances is by the NCA which investigates "serious" or "organised" crimes. But in May LeaveEU was also fined £70,000 &amp; referred to Met police who are investigating criminal offences related to illegal overspending 	https://t.co/y7eGsxhFnv
2/ And then there's last week's news. That the National Crime Agency is investigating Banks on suspicion of committing "multiple criminal offences". Huge question mark over funding of LeaveEU campaign &amp; whether it was "permissible" or from foreign sources	https://t.co/p4Hdg6YOpF
1/ So many crimes to choose from! But let's start with latest. Banks fined £135,000 today for breaking data protection laws. Note: potentially much bigger news to come. Really explosive stuff hidden here: that Banks used insurance data for @nigel_farage's LeaveEU campaign https://t.co/1ayJhMAcsr

Journalists reporting on @ICOnews report in parliament this morning waking up to @buzzfeeduk story about @Arron_banks. Suggest you read this thread first. Is there a bigger story being deliberately buried? https://t.co/6eH0LEThXa
Particularly given we know that @arron_banks has not just Eldon &amp; GoSkippy data but also from millions of car owners &amp; others across UK. I found he had mine just because I once used @moneysupermarket price comparison website	https://t.co/yRmMuZpV5m
This is the news story that @arron_banks is desperate to avoid. Buzzfeed writes only about  LeaveEU using Eldon insurance data. What's much bigger &amp; much more explosive &amp; not even mentioned here as possibility is that this data abuse happened the other way around.
And there's a MUCH bigger story which @buzzfeedUK has not even mentioned. Did @arron_banks weaponise his customers' insurance data to target EUref voters with @Nigel_Farage lies &amp; propaganda?? Parliament heard evidence that he did. Why not even mentioned here??? https://t.co/cWASXcT24f
So this is designed to take sting out of news when Elizabeth Denham announces it in Parliament this morning &amp; pre-frame the news to journalists &amp; news orgs. Suggest it is treated with care.
For months @arron_banks leaked shit about me @DamianCollins &amp; others to @alex_wickham at @guido. Wickham moved to @buzzfeed as detailed by @zelo_street. Banks had promised new dirt y’day but went quiet it appears now after receiving ICO endorsement notice		https://t.co/t1dHtkakWq
But this leak has come from @arron_banks. Buzzfeed has no other details from ICO report out this morning. Only that which relates to Banks. So this is @arron_banks’ PR machine in operation dropping spoiler ahead of report &amp; looks to me like @buzzfeeduk doing his dirty work
Note: @arron_banks confessed to these crimes in interview I did with him 18 months ago but he said ‘nobody cares’. Both @podehaye &amp; I separately reported him to @ICO. 	https://t.co/kTk7bAwMeT
Last week @arron_banks referred to NCA, today he’ll be found guilty of data crimes, leak suggests. I’m interested in the leak, tho. Has it come direct from Banks? He used to channel his ‘leaks’ through Guido but looks like Buzzfeed now his outlet of choice	https://t.co/BOLKE3GW7F

Part of the problem of the continuing bad &amp; inadequate coverage of story has been due to Westminster bubble mentality. Really important to bear in mind @arron_banks &amp; @nigel_farage have multiple relationships that link to what's going on in Mueller's inquiry. https://t.co/u41NQL4rht
This is an excellent new article on @Arron_banks in the @FT . Builds on important work previously by @cynthiao but also has fascinating new details. Bravo @RKWinvisibleman 	https://t.co/HF4YuGI8Wh
The @bbc gave him a platform to spread those smears &amp; amplify this distraction story to millions. It also allowed him to attach those smears to new story. Note, these are NEW sources. NEW emails. NEW allegations. But #Marr didn't know enough to challenge	https://t.co/0QAKRX0psF
...but then nothing happened. Until this week. And so, facing possible scrutiny again, he devises black PR campaign.  #Marr inexplicably didn't ask the questions but @skynews at least tried. He's always sought to portray me as a lone "lunatic". This is next step up
Banks has harrassed both me &amp; @peterjukes relentlessly since. He's reported us twice to the police. It's extreme behaviour. What can we learn from this? My observation is that when this story broke, he knew it was very very serious &amp; he was very worried...
We took decision before publication to inform them of course of action. And we got them a lawyer. This was not our source. It was somebody we thought may need possible protection from Banks. End of. This is not the story. This - parliament's report - is the story. https://t.co/aC5VFOvWM8
We have chain of title and can prove with documentary evidence that emails were legitimately obtained. But there was a person who we feared would be mis-identified as source &amp; potentially face retribution from Banks. And so it turns out
But Banks is desperate. He's dodged the press but parliament has the truth. 	He's announced he has police report from source. And that he intends to publish emails I sent this individual. To be clear: the individual he is referring to was NOT @peterjukes or my source. https://t.co/wQqUzCqoCa
Instead, Banks used the opportunity to accuse me (&amp; by extension @peterjukes) of "blackmail" "bullying" &amp; "stealing emails". Parliament has established that Banks is not a credible witness. That he has misled the committee. It calls Wigmore is a "self-confessed liar" https://t.co/WORaRKOFSB
#Marr had only limited time but it's why the decision to stage live interview on magazine show felt so wrong. Parliament has established his account of his relationship published in his memoir is a fabrication ("Oleg" btw is in fact Alexander Udod expelled post-Skripal) https://t.co/IIKzWgId69
Instead of responding to simple public interest qs about their r'ship with Russian ambassador &amp; why he introduced them to potential business deals, they repeatedly spread lies about @peterjukes &amp; myself. Having dodged questions on #Marr, they have now promised more smears today https://t.co/c2MIDRTbVp
1/Banks &amp; Wigmore have not been held to account for these lies. They were belligerent to MPs &amp; walked out of parliament. This is their interim report. Says they was contacted by '3 individuals' who had emails containing info about Banks &amp; Wigmore's relations with Russian embassy https://t.co/DVPXjJ7t9F
The @bbc gave Banks this platform &amp; headline without asking a single question about what parliament has established are lies he told about his relationship with Russia. And now I hear he plans to launch another personal attack on me today in relation to this story. A few notes https://t.co/INvWbZ6GmE
@brexit_sham @peterjukes Was this interview yesterday? iTV?
Gosh https://t.co/ZqLVWaF1Yd
Missed this from Leaver-turned-Remainer Peter Oborne. Fascinating thought experiment: what if this scandal was about @jeremycorbyn &amp; Russia?  (Sigh. Still can't understand why #Marr failed to ask a single question today)	  https://t.co/4hAH00ehf7
@Phillip_Blond I agree. But the last few minutes was a total car crash. And that’s what this thread is about
Thank you @skynews. Exemplary behaviour. Contacted me immediately to give me right to reply &amp; gave me prominent slot to rebut allegations &amp; frame context of these smears. I’m amazed @bbc hasn’t been in touch to offer similar
This is great. #digitalsleuths tracking influence operations involving Russian ambassador to London (@arron_banks’ mate &amp; focus of Mueller inquiries) https://t.co/4Lnqfpf0cZ
#Marr wasn't sufficiently up to speed to challenge him or rebut his lies. What's more, we now have dozens of headlines "No Russian money in Brexit" when - extraordinarily - Marr failed to ask a single question about his r'ship with Russian government		https://t.co/ztTQ2dJCd5
There is no excuse for this. It was obvious he would try &amp; do so. And it matters not because of reputational damage to me. But because it enabled @arron_banks to evade proper scrutiny. Once again. It just amplified his lies to a much bigger audience		https://t.co/zBFeRHEZVn
This is a man who has repeatedly smeared, bullied &amp; threatened me. Being given a platform by the @bbc to do so again on live TV to an audience of millions	https://t.co/OgSRpd39Un
So what happens when #Marr asks him about these? Banks falsely claims this was reported to the electoral commission. Not according to witnesses &amp; documentary evidence seen by @ObserverUK. And, then - perfect pivot - uses interview to smear me &amp; try to discredit our investigation
We revealed internal whistleblowers from Eldon insurance had turned over hundreds of emails &amp; eye-witness accounts. The allegations are hugely serious. Illegal campaign co-ordination. Illegal over-spending. We put these &amp; other allegations to Banks &amp; he refused to respond https://t.co/j79FnynZhr
Our story today - &amp; another separate but overlapping investigation published by @openDemocracy - revealed multiple new potential criminal offences that may have been committed. They would also put @arron_banks in contempt, for lying of parliament.
The new investigation by the NCA is just one @arron_banks is facing. The Met is investigating possible criminal offences regarding spending returns. And ICO is investigating whether Eldon insurance data was used by LeaveEU political purposes . This is from @commonsCMS report https://t.co/UtYDl40jUK
I believe it is important to keep asking Bank questions. But framing, context &amp; format is crucial. Banks's PR chose live Sunday magazine show as his preferred format on morning he knew he would be facing significant new allegations from @ObserverUK	https://t.co/0QAKRX0psF
Did you watch #Marr today? Then please read this short thread on critical errors I believe @bbc made here, why it matters &amp; why it's given @Arron_banks a prominent platform to deceive the public again https://t.co/dlQvrV4cFh

This is performance art. It's why we have regulators. To investigate. 	#Marr
Where's @peterpomeranzev? Can we talk about the Russian political technologists &amp; politics as theatre? #Marr
#Marr points out the bank statements proves nothing. Now up: whataboutery! The Remain campaign! Blah blah
Remember the Electoral Commission has spent a year looking at these accounts. But...they're not allowed on #Marr because that would be inappropriate
This is so pointless	#Marr
Here he comes...oh! excellent, first up: an advert for his insurance business. 	#Marr
Talking of @arron_banks' PR man. Here's what parliament had to say about him	#Marr. It found both Arron &amp; Andy to be wholly unreliable witnesses https://t.co/Xg83F6Iddk
So, essentially Julia is working here as an @arron_banks mouthpiece. Note @afneil picked up all the Guido stuff too.
The "correction" meme that Hartley-Brewer references was put out by Guido who channels dirt on me that comes directly from @arron_banks. Note, that everything we 'corrected' was due to legal pushback from AIQ - but was later confirmed to be true by the ICO's interim report

Important point re #Marr interview with Banks. He refused to answer ANY questions @observerUK put to him Friday. He refused to answer MPs questions &amp; walked out of parliament. I think he should be questioned. But remember: #Marr is the outlet his PR chose https://t.co/2vbWwOLuWh

@MeirionTweets @CathyJenkins101 @BBCNewsnight @johnsweeneyroar @maitlis It's not going to be trial by television though. Not in time available, in that slot. I think there's definitely case to be made for interviewing him, but I think this way, this format, problematic...
@SarahRosemary3 ugh
@MeirionTweets @BBCNewsnight @johnsweeneyroar @maitlis Hi Meirion, but why do we have to do with Marr? It's not that he's not up to the job of a robust interview, obviously, but the format - a Sunday morning magazine show - just seems wrong. As you say, no space for a proper reported package or context
@mrmartinbath Well, yes..definitely an argument. Why does he get to pick &amp; choose? And as above...he refused to answer MPs questions. Walked out of parliament..
@DrDanBerwick Yes, I agree. Marr has many great strengths as a journalist but he's had a really bad run with this story. Hasn't seemed to understand it &amp; programme (which probably has nothing to do with him) has made crass errors in its treatment of it. A lot of baggage...
@Ohdearodells Yes. Really important point. He refused to answer MPs questions. Should why should we allow him to pick &amp; chose only the platforms he wants? He won't answer our democratically elected representatives. But he's chosen our taxpayer funded broadcaster to be his megaphone...
@d_v_b_tw I think there has certainly been serious issues with BBC coverage. And, it would be so much more palatable if they could admit mistakes rather than always respond so defensively. (Also hate Twitter rudeness of senior execs &amp; presenters toward people who pay their wages)
@tachompso But, we aren't going to get those answers in ten minutes on a Sunday morning magazine show. Banks has had two years to give those answers. And he hasn't...so probing isn't actually going to get anywhere. In that sense, it's purely performative
@MissSarrah I don't know about that. There's so much attention on him &amp; this interview. It's a really unenviable job. But the format only allows so much time so I think it's going to probably inevitably feel a bit shallow?
@KimDriver11 Yes. Agree
@eyejosh I don't agree with that, actually, Joshua. But I think the media is in unchartered waters &amp;  that's why this needs proper ethical discussion. We have to talk about Banks, Brexit &amp; dodgy donations. But it's now a criminal inquiry. It's an extraordinary situation...
@IslaArundel Yes, that's what I worry about. But...Banks is also innocent unless proven guilty and is now a figure of prominent national interest. It's what makes this so uniquely tortuous. We need to talk about these issues. But they are now matters of a criminal investigation
So, I don't think the Marr show is the right format for this interview. And its uncomfortable history with this story makes it even more problematic. I also worry about amplifying his propaganda, eg his smears of the Electoral Commission &amp; the head of the parliamentary inquiry
Ok. Shall we have a heated (but polite) debate? How should the media treat figures like Banks? (Or Bannon?)

The political fall-out depends upon 2 things: 1) The press 2) Parliament. Your role as @BBC political editor gives you pivotal role in both. It's hugely premature to second-guess impact in place of reporting the story. Whether you can see it or not, you are steering the reaction

@tom_watson Thanks. I think it's because disinformation works. It takes an existing prejudice - women are crazy! - and then amplifies it.

Apologies. The government’s response to @commoncms interim report is embargoed until midnight. Sorry for the spoiler.
Can you ask her about her fitness to be the newly-appointed chair of FCO-run Wilton Park given the failings in oversight while at Vote Leave? The foreign secretary @BorisJohnson had ultimate say in this decision. Was this a quid pro quo?
The £ to BeLeave never went to the campaign. It was funnelled directly to AIQ. @shahmiruk has given evidence about how the overspending scheme was directed by Vote Leave's lawyers. Did she direct them? Did she oversee in her role of chair?
Sorry, got your handle wrong @Jo_Coburn. To continue: we know from @VickerySec's work that @GiselaStuart also employed AIQ on ChangeBritain. This is the firm that has now been banned by ICO from working in UK and has been accused by Canadian parliament of lying.
Can you please ask her about @michaelgove &amp; @borisjohnson's involvement in the decision to give BeLeave £625,000 in the biggest overspending scandal in modern British history? Can you please ask her about her relationship with AIQ, the Canadian firm at the centre of this all?

We know they were involved in day-to-day decisions. Can you ask her specifically about Johnson/Gove role in this?
@nnimrodd @RobBurl @GiselaStuart @afneil @ObserverUK Finally, can you ask her about her relationship with @BorisJohnson and his role in her new position as chair at FCO-run Wilton Park. She failed in her duties of chair of Vote Leave - criminal offences committed under her watch. What makes her fit to chair Wilton Park?
@nnimrodd @RobBurl @GiselaStuart @afneil Note, AIQ was the first firm banned from processing UK citizens' data under GDPR. This is the firm that's at the heart of four different Leave campaigns. @GiselaStuart right in the middle of this but has refused to answer any of @ObserverUK's questions about it.
@nnimrodd @RobBurl @GiselaStuart Also, you doubled down last week on @afneil's tweeting of my "mistakes" about AIQ. ICO has now confirmed our reporting. I would be grateful if you could ask @GiselaStuart about her relationship with the firm because she also employed them to work for her on ChangeBritain

@janinegibson It’s quite  incredible that story Buzzfeed (&amp; Private Eye) broke of massive electoral fraud involving Theresa May’s top advisors &amp; ministers in her govt is STILL not being reported on. Canadian govt’s inquiry ignored. No 10’s attempts to smear whistleblower ignored. Weird, no?
@janinegibson Yes. For eg this great Buzzfeed scoop wasn’t followed up by most outlets (inc Buzzfeed) &amp; even after investigation opened was trashed by r/w outlets like Guido. Yet it involves millions of £ funnelled offshore &amp; govt ministers with massive implications 		https://t.co/0c4cliCZBQ
RT @JolyonMaugham: Never gets old. https://t.co/n9R36ohbPB
Met police cite ‘political sensitivities’ for failing to investigate electoral crimes - money &amp; data funnelled offshore - &amp; still no explanation from govt to parliament on its calls for investigation into foreign interference. 		https://t.co/N3W7nthwJU
Yet as @OliverBullough points out in brilliant new book Moneyland, Britain invented offshore. We enabled despots around the world &amp; now it’s come home to bite us on the arse. @ObserverUK’s 2 stories from yesterday raise serious questions of govt cover-up	https://t.co/TYeIaR0zlo
What’s striking is how everything @anneapplebaum says about corruption in Malta &amp; Slovakia applies to UK too. Flows of offshore money, complicit politicians, discrediting of news sources. The difference perhaps is that people can’t believe such corruption could be possible here https://t.co/FVUi4tA5mY
Thought provoking from @anneapplebaum who sees the murder of journalists as symptom of deeper structural changes in the flow of money, power &amp; information. Daphne &amp; Khashoggi as canaries in the coal mine of globalised corruption..		https://t.co/mVuteEOt3D
Finally, I took what action I believed was necessary to protect sources. One of them took his own separate parallel legal action for same purpose and same reasons. All media partners, I believe, would now agree that they are glad they did not break agreement &amp; publish first.

FYI no British news outlet has reported on Canadian parliament’s ongoing attempts to get at truth about AIQ. This, remember, is the story you originally broke. 	https://t.co/ZoFZWgxCmr
But I’m sure that both Buzzfeed reporters who hounded me over a correction the Observer published to my article on AIQ have had a good read of interim ICO findings. Which confirmed our reporting. Here’s a link boys		https://t.co/wJcZYSCJsk
So be it. It’s not like there’s much actual news around...oh. Buzzfeed missed &amp; dismissed the CA story, so you know...But it was way out ahead with Vote Leave overspending. It broke the story first back in Aug 16. Not sure why no interest now		https://t.co/0c4cliCZBQ
Buzzfeed has now responded to say it stands by the article and doesn’t wish to enter into correspondence on any of the points. Nobody has returned my calls.
The piece contained multiple claims presented as facts, that I contend are provably incorrect or inaccurate. Instead of getting into a Twitter fight, I followed normal due process and wrote &amp; asked Buzzfeed to correct.
And the angle.. https://t.co/qU2kb4jYVv
I was, well, a bit wary. This exchange is from the early hours of Aug 1. The tweet that prompted it has since been deleted. https://t.co/b5vlf9ulGO
A week ago, Buzzfeed published a story about which quoted anonymous sources. The reporter did not talk to me. Instead he sent a list of questions a few hours before publication.

I’m going to row back from ‘arrogant’. Felt defensive &amp; unhelpful
BBC coverage of Vote Leave scandal was firstly absent, then wrong &amp; ultimately bad. It’s a subject of critical public interest. And there has been no acknowledgement or reflection. It failed the public. And reactions of senior execs to criticism on here felt arrogant &amp; unhelpful

Also warns what China is doing with the mass harvesting of data &amp; scoring of its citizens is ‘like an episode of Black Mirror. In fact I think it was an episode of Black Mirror’. ‘A dystopian future is taking shape before our eyes’

The unreflecting bro-ness is Silicon Valley is one of the reasons we are in the mess we are in. And the assault on journalism &amp; journalists by the likes of Breitbart -ex-editor &amp; right-hand man to Steve Bannon below - should terrify us all https://t.co/o8d5E17KGw
There are bigger issues, bros. Much much bigger. And being a bro, without reflecting on your bro-ness, makes you as much a part of the problem, not the solution
And what this conference has rightly identified is the absolutely foundational &amp; key role the media plays in creating the world we have found ourselves. It’s the first session up this morning for a reason https://t.co/VfAgd70gGD
Most at threat from this worldwide assault on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of course are the most vulnerable: women, children, minorities, the disabled. https://t.co/ASfIqP8d3p
But then being a woman in journalism is like being a woman in public life. A woman in politics. I’m off to Oxford to hear someone who knows this more than most - @HillaryClinton. But she - rightly - is going to be focusing on the worldwide threat to human rights.
The constant belittling attacks. The entirely different metrics used to judge your behaviour &amp; work. A gender pay gap of up to nearly 30% at some news orgs. The hours spent composing letters/listicles ‘12 Key Facts Your Crude Hit Job Got Wrong’.

@podehaye @rossjanderson @cgseife @DavidErdos @profcarroll @RaviNa1k Interesting! Well done...
Nice try, Theresa. But we now know that "people's vote" was corrupted by criminal acts overseen by ministers in your own cabinet. We don't trust you. Because you broke the law. And we see this for what it is: the actions of a complicit government desperate to cover up its crimes https://t.co/nrHdwJHu6P
Another interesting legal challenge from @GoodLawProject.

And it’s notable to UK because this same campaign featured both data firms that worked on Brexit: Cambridge Analytica &amp; AIQ. And yet we have no idea if any of this is being investigated or not. We know info has been handed to NCA. We don’t know if they’re pursuing it.

The Sun is right. Robinson is the intolerable face of the new fascism. He’s funded by foreign interests to incite violence &amp; racial hatred in UK. This is a threat to our national interest &amp; national security. &amp; it’s Bannon. The same Bannon who played major covert role in Brexit
And here’s the high-priced US publicist who’s shilling for Robinson. It’s Bannon’s publicist. Bannon’s long-term PR Alexandra Peate is the head of this firm. And look at the clients. https://t.co/HjGTZAcujA
A re-cap. Bannon has new donors - US-based dark money Middle East Forum for one - but team now pushing Robinson was deeply involved in Brexit. Bannon opened @BreitbartLondon specifically to support @Nigel_Farage. He was VP of Cambridge Analytica. He’s up to his eyes in Brexit..

@78SoylentGreen @LabourAgainstAS You know far more about this subject. And I completely defer to your expertise. I’d hate to damage the story - hence why I’ve deleted. The bigger point about disinfo targeting both sides stands..but this evidently was a poor eg. No offence intended.
It was anti-semitism online that alerted me to these wider forces... And that's why what's happening now matters. Because it's leaked out. Off the web. Into real life. Permission has been given. Read this by @Freedland	https://t.co/xVtaB8g8gi
@ReachEd Probably. And @GuidoFawkes will get another brilliant scoop.
So, when I say disinformation plays a role in amplifying hate &amp; stoking divisions this is what I mean. This is literally what led me down this rabbit hole. And Google &amp; Facebook will still not acknowledge it. So please be clear where I am on this subject &amp; why I think it matters https://t.co/u5v9A54j6M
The tech giants have played a crucial role in fanning flames of anti-semitism &amp; racism. And still haven't been held to account. Google changed its algorithm - eventually - in response to this series of articles..but never explained how this had happened..		https://t.co/4SRjSLiDzs
We have no idea how long Google was serving up violent anti-semitic hate when people were searching for terms like "jews" &amp; "holocaust" but it seems probable it was throughout 2016. Google refused to acknowledge it had a problem. And this was the beginning of this entire story.. https://t.co/rLptT6QpRh

@gemrosenblatt I really wasn't wanting in any way to diminish! Agh! Trying to make the point that disinfo is on left &amp; right..but didn't realise the disinfo alert was disinfo!!
@MollyMEP Yes! Exactly...
@GuidoFawkes Or this. The larger point @GuidoFawkes &amp; one I thought you might be interested in is that disinfo is not the preserve of the Brexity right. But this was probably not a good example. But sure. Bash away. https://t.co/PLuTPChOre

@DPJHodges @MurdacrSheWrote @DaWibbler Yes, Dan. And this entire investigation into Cambridge Analytica/Facebook &amp; all the rest started with anti-semitic hate being propagated by Google. Which they eventually - six articles later - took action over. 		https://t.co/SzXKCq3Zxb
@mePadraigReidy See my reply above. I'm not an expert on this. I defer to your knowledge of it
@DPJHodges I defer to your expertise, Dan. It doesn't have to be Russian. But glad someone's checked it out.
@mePadraigReidy Don't want to deflect from the seriousness of issues. So perhaps a mistake to highlight this. But idea has not gone mainstream yet that disinfo (&amp;esp Russian disnfo) is not about pushing a particular line, it's about ripping apart social consensus &amp; pushing views to the extremes
@mePadraigReidy I had to google that, Padraig. If it's no, it's no. I have absolutely no interest in getting involved in this debate so perhaps wrong to highlight. But I've seen how trolls massively amplify arguments on right, so it would make sense to me that it's also happening on left too
@DPJHodges I didn't, Dan. Thanks for letting me know. I looked at the links &amp; thought it bore further investigation by someone. I'm interested in the way that divisive issues are amplified by disinfo agents...but perhaps that is not the case here?

@alexhern And look. Just this on another thread but it is a serious offence. (This was an SCL shareholder incidentally). If you think of number of different ads &amp; number of times served it’s a really big deal https://t.co/I1svF84TRQ
@LLocock @veritasta @SLATUKIP @hugorifkind @facebook @markjenk Here. For eg. This was an SCL shareholder - Roger Gabb. He placed ad without imprint during the EURref &amp; was found guilty of an offence &amp; fined https://t.co/QXV1sgPDwI
@alexhern Right. Fair. Though the text for the ones you picked out had absolutely nothing about Vote Leave on it or who had placed the ad..hence not an imprint.

You know with phone hacking, there was the ‘Milly Dowler moment’. Could this be a Jo Cox moment? Official Vote Leave campaign puts out fake ‘Breaking News’ ad after she’s murdered.

@veritasta @hugorifkind @mrjamesob @sturdyAlex Wow. And look: that’s the ‘breaking news’
@ScottJFaulds Was that during ref period?
@alexhern Right. Tho it’s out by a factor of 10. What do you mean by red herring here?
@Otto_English Yeah, but that dossier was also just bollocks. The EC looked into it
@alexhern Right. There’s also a massive gap between number of ads Facebook has released &amp; said they were served to. And Dom Cummings’ stated figures. Which also begs question if they were served by other pages/accounts
Sorry, that’s @brexit_sham.
Right adding to this because @veritasta points out that according to info released these had a frame or were on VL page. but £50 million ones had nothing. Biggest mystery tho is from @brexitshsam who points out Dom Cummings’ figures suggest these are only a fraction of ads served
@veritasta @hugorifkind @facebook @markjenk But I found the page saying they required imprints last night..

And Manveen reveals he was actually paying Lesotho's PM while in exile	https://t.co/q9y9DC33w8 https://t.co/3jpVIys4St
And this. Another lawyer. Another lawbreaker. Another politician who had a formal, official role with Vote Leave who has not been questioned and who is now the minister responsible for Brexit, a result that he helped Vote Leave to achieve -through illegal means. https://t.co/yyVdssgewG
And this! Why has @BorisJohnson not been asked about this? Why has he not been asked about his role in Vote Leave's illegal campaign finances? He is pushing through a result that he not only knows was obtained illegally but which he was complicit in. Where is the outrage? https://t.co/Ug7lOVDTDg
Right. Enough. @giselastuart has a PhD in law. She lectured in law. She was chair of Vote Leave that campaigned for sovereignty of British laws. 		So, why did you break them @GiselaStuart?

So confused by @DominicRaab’s incisive legal mind here. So these laws (which you &amp; fellow ministers broke), these laws don’t matter? What matters is British laws for British people. Except for these ones. Is that it?

LeaveEU is intimately tied to Trump. And its attacks on the press are Trumpist attacks on our democracy. You just can't have a democracy without a free press.

@piersmorgan Ugh. Piers. Just because you got trounced in the viewing figures by a re-run of Have I Got News For You doesn't mean you need to take it out on everyone else.
@josierourke @mrJamesGraham I'm saying no such thing. I'm saying that it risks misleading people over a crucial historic vote. Because it can't be anything other than misleading. Because we don't yet know the facts. I don't think it's worth it. That you do is you freely expressing your opinion.
@piersmorgan 4) "Both sides lied" is the worst kind of false equivalence. This was an overspend of nearly £1 million in a tight race with a total budget of only £7 million. Why would you condone lawbreaking? Oh..
@piersmorgan 1) We don't know how it affected the result but campaigns spend money for a reason. 2) This isn't about lying, it's about breaking the law. 3) I suggested your paper hacked a dead girl's phone under your editorship. As I acknowledged, I meant to saying "living celebrities".
@piersmorgan Mate, we found out last week that Vote Leave broke the law. That BeLeave broke the law. We found out previously that LeaveEU broke the law. Multiple other potential offences still under investigation. Sorry. You were saying? Democracy?
@josierourke @mrJamesGraham Expression here means to mislead people. It can't be otherwise. Because we don't know the facts. I think it's critical that people have the facts about what happened in the referendum. And James can't express these because we don't know what they are yet
@RalfLittle All good points but Benedict Cumberbatch is filming as Dominic Cummings now &amp; dialogue, character, motivation already written. I hope he can explain Dom's masterplan to create overspending vehicle &amp; (potentially illegal) co-ordination of 4+ campaigns because I'd love someone to
@DanRebellato Yes, sorry, James! And yes.. right &amp; good to defend him. But these are crimes that have not yet been tried. We're still trying to do the journalism. The authorities are still investigating. This has been a two-year struggle to find the truth &amp; we are still not there...
@josierourke @mrJamesGraham Yes, Josie. But crimes were committed, you see. And they haven't yet been tried. And we don't yet know the truth of what happened. So as good as James' re-drafting process is, and as great a writer as he is, I don't see how what he writes can be based on facts. Do you see?
@DanRebellato Alex is a fantastic writer. But we don't have the facts yet. We've been fighting to uncover them for two years &amp; what we now have is a crime scene. I should have picked my words more carefully because I think Alex is a victim in this.
@bopanc @theblueposts @GMcegg GRU is military intel. They're the ones behind attack on US democracy. This is part of same effort. To destabilize truth. It's a military manoeuvre by a hostile foreign power.

@RalfLittle Yes. You’re quite right. And I retweeted him saying as much. And I know he’s a great writer. But it doesn’t matter how good his research is. He can’t have the facts because we don’t know the facts. That’s what journalists &amp; the authorities are desperately trying to find out.

Also remember: Vote Leave took taxpayers’ money. It’s a fraud on us, the British people. And this is an overspend of 10% of the entire campaign budget. Gavin Millar QC described it as of ‘a scale &amp; seriousness’ not seen in modern times
The ‘other related offences’ are very serious potential criminal offences including deleting evidence &amp; obstructing the course of justice. A potential prison sentence.

It's astonishing that BBC is seeking to defend this. If it was left up to the BBC, we still would not know the truth about Cambridge Analytica &amp; Facebook! How can it defend that??
They were walked through 2 folders of evidence by a leading QC. It's the same evidence was given to the Electoral Commission. Who has - we know now - found Vote Leave guilty in its preliminary report.

The problem is that the BBC is so big that if it's not covering it, it's not news. That's why it matters. And that's why, in a highly partisan news landscape, its public service role is so important. But this is not a partisan issue. It's about the rule of law.
And this here yesterday by @Freedland. This isn't Remoanerism. It's really really serious questions about why BBC is failing to do basic journalism. https://t.co/sTiTJX7ULS
The second major piece in two days in BBC's abject failure to cover this story. The Observer is tiny with almost no resources. The BBC is huge with enormous resources. Its journalists are paid fantastical sums. And yet they continue to ignore this story. Just what is going on?? https://t.co/R057Bqs3pn
