2019 in a nutshell	Ran into a Dem senator walking out of the Capitol — he was  shaking his head in disbelief after a reporter cornered him to ask why he was one of only three Democrats who shook Trump’s hand.		“He’s the president of the United States! I’m gonna shake his hand!’
Detailed, even gruesome, descriptions of the violence perpetuated on native-born Americans by undocumented immigrants are Stephen Miller trademark -- and he has been huddling with Trump over the past few days poring over speech drafts.
The sound of one side clapping.
"the gates and guards" thing seems like a shot at Pelosi, no?
He's really hitting the fact-check part of the speech now
The speaker is reading.
Lotta chit-chat between Pence and Pelosi. Not.

Frosty readout of China talks from Lighthizer &amp; Co. — which seems to include a pointed reminder to Trump who wants a quickie deal: Talks focused commodity purchases but also Trump’s ahem ‘commitment’ to addressing trade deficit and structural issues.
