R3. Una subvenci√≥n en bloque es una cantidad fija de dinero que el gobierno federal otorga a estados para ofrecer beneficios.

Looking ahead, policymakers can set a new course and pursue true tax reform that in fact prioritizes people with low or modest incomes; raises revenue to meet national needs; and strengthens the integrity of the tax code: https://t.co/suN1Uznw78
Overall, in 2025, households in the bottom 60% will receive average tax cuts worth 1% of their after-tax income ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt count the harm that many of them will face from increased health costs. https://t.co/JITNTIE8gw
6. It adds $1.9 trillion to deficits from 2018 to 2027. That raises the pressure on policymakers down the road to squeeze or cut critical economic security programs and investments that have widely shared benefits.
5. It ends‚ÄØthe Child Tax Credit for 1 million children ‚Äî who are overwhelmingly ‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù who were brought to the US by their immigrant parents. https://t.co/sTh7l2bWU7
4. It erodes the value of the Earned income tax credit. For working families, this means the maximum EITC will increase more slowly: https://t.co/suN1Uznw78
3. The CBO expects the law to leave millions more people uninsured or facing higher premiums, because it repealed the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs requirement that most people enroll in health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. https://t.co/1GEWWw2PJJ
2. It retains, and even, creates new incentives for companies to shift profits and investment offshore, and that risks weakening workers‚Äô wages: https://t.co/bjeddg2j0a https://t.co/BZCWPt8pBM
1. It puts workers‚Äô wages and workplace standards at risk through its 20% deduction for pass-throughs: https://t.co/eGb4WGThUY https://t.co/TwRa4YCraF
Here‚Äôs six ways that the 2017 tax law may in fact hurt many low- and moderate-income households. https://t.co/suN1Uznw78 https://t.co/29zGByu5Bv
Here‚Äôs a prime example: the law increased the maximum Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child, but it denied that full increase to millions of children in low-income working families: https://t.co/WfgzK6gOFQ https://t.co/TqmhCSF9xV
The lowest-income 60% of Americans saw their share of the nation‚Äôs household income fall by roughly the same amount as the top 1% gained.  	 	The 2017 tax law could have focused on helping those facing the steepest challenges in this economy, but it largely left them behind. https://t.co/ohqLiaF9Ws
Since 1979, the real incomes of working-class Americans ‚Äîthe racially and geographically diverse set of people commonly defined as workers without a bachelor‚Äôs degree ‚Äî have been virtually stagnant: https://t.co/ZRM81SnKLT https://t.co/jNYd7CQj9Y

4. Implementing complex new restrictions will increase administrative costs for states. Creating that administrative system could cost #Kentucky over $180 million in the first 6 months alone. https://t.co/Q9BuK81t1w
3. Taking away #Medicaid coverage from people who don‚Äôt meet a work requirement won‚Äôt promote work -- in fact, the effect will be just the opposite. https://t.co/Q9BuK81t1w
2. Losing #Medicaid coverage will worsen health. Of the health impacts of Kentucky‚Äôs waiver, the brief states, ‚ÄúMany of the disenrolled will become sicker, and some could die prematurely.‚Äù https://t.co/Q9BuK81t1w
1. #Medicaid eligibility restrictions will cause tens of thousands to lose access to health coverage. Or as the brief finds, "The large majority of both working &amp; non-working beneficiaries who lose Medicaid will lose their health coverage altogether.‚Äù https://t.co/Q9BuK81t1w
With the Trump Admin re-approving Kentucky‚Äòs #Medicaid waiver that takes coverage away from people not meeting work requirements, a group of health care providers &amp; advocates has filed a brief to explain the harm of this policy: https://t.co/Q9BuK81t1w		Here are their 5 lessons:

@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro You can read @AvivaAronDine's full testimony here on the actions of the Trump Administration to sabotage the ACA: https://t.co/XkL6v9AjVK
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro Arkansas' Medicaid work requirement has "a coverage loss rate so high it‚Äôs nearly certain that working people &amp; people who were supposed to be exempt from the new rules are losing coverage due to complex and burdensome reporting requirements. "
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "The same proposal would also raise the ACA‚Äôs limits on consumers‚Äô total out-of-pocket costs; that provision of the ACA protects people with employer plans too. 		These cost increases are entirely at HHS‚Äôs discretion; they are not required by any statute."
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "The 2017 ACA repeal bills sharply cut financial assistance for marketplace consumers. Now, HHS appears to be looking for ways to advance this objective by administrative action as well." - @AvivaAronDine
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "Higher ACA premiums also mean that the federal government will spend more on premium tax credits. 		That‚Äôs important, because those additional federal dollars could instead be spent on making ACA coverage more affordable for healthy &amp; sick people..."
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "Troubling but unsurprising new research finds that the plans are being marketed with a lot of fine print &amp; without clear warnings ‚Äì sometimes without any warnings at all ‚Äì about what they don‚Äôt cover." - @AvivaAronDine
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "These plans can &amp; do deny coverage or charge higher premiums based on health status; exclude essential health benefits such as maternity care, substance use treatment, or prescription drugs; &amp; impose annual limits on coverage." - @AvivaAronDine
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "First, where the 2017 repeal bills ended or weakened various protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the Administration‚Äôs short-term plans rule stands up a parallel insurance market that isn‚Äôt subject to these protections." - @AvivaAronDine
@AvivaAronDine @AppropsDems @rosadelauro "Pres. Trump has been clear from the start of his presidency that his goal is to repeal the ACA. With legislative repeal off the table for now, the Admin has sought to achieve a version of repeal through the courts, declining to defend the ACA in the Texas v. Azar lawsuit."

Nationally, 33% of families with children living in metropolitan areas live in high-poverty neighborhoods. See how your area ranks here: https://t.co/znV5G6nARS https://t.co/pMP4yWB85M
Giving low-income families the option of living in wealthier neighborhoods with better schools and less crime leads to better outcomes. Their children are more likely to go to college and find better-paying jobs.
That's even with plenty of affordable apartments available in higher income neighborhoods. This has long-term consequences for families and their children.

Important thread on Trump Administration‚Äôs new proposed SNAP rule: https://t.co/1ppX78wLYJ
The proposed #SNAP rule changes released today would take basic food assistance away from hundreds of thousands of the nation's poorest people. Read the full @GreensteinCBPP statement: https://t.co/uVPHJtfgJm
Taking away these essential food benefits from those who are unemployed won't address the inequities in the labor market or the challenges that so many workers face: https://t.co/trfBXOupDq
Childless adults using #SNAP are very poor. Restricting states' ability would especially harm workers who face disadvantages in the labor market: https://t.co/trfBXOupDq

Operating within the reasonable 2019 funding levels of last year‚Äôs agreement, lawmakers have worked in bipartisan fashion to complete the 2019 appropriations bills. A retreat to CRs would jeopardize much of this productive effort: https://t.co/kjG0wxaoNz
Another option is a full-year CR which has its own serious disadvantages. Congress was already working on a bipartisan basis to craft bills for 2019 needs and full-year CR would halt that progress: https://t.co/kjG0wxaoNz
One option is a partial-year continuing resolution (CR) which would keep agencies operating at current funding levels, irrespective of whether their needs had increased or shrunk: https://t.co/kjG0wxaoNz

While the ACA remains the law of the land, this decision and the same devastating consequences are supported by the Trump Administration &amp; Congressional Republicans as a matter of policy: https://t.co/7L3fXfLYJX
Like Judge O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs decision, last year‚Äôs repeal bills would:	üöëEnd nationwide pre-existing conditions protections	üöëEnd other critical consumer protections	üöëEnd the ACA‚Äôs #Medicaid expansion	üöëCause millions of people to lose coverage	üöëDestabilize health care markets
But last year‚Äôs ACA repeal bills would have had much the same devastating consequences as the decision itself, &amp; the responses to the ruling are a reminder that the Admin &amp; many congressional Republicans still support these outcomes as a matter of policy.
Moreover, as legal experts with opposing views on the ACA have explained, the legal reasoning behind the decision is extraordinarily weak: https://t.co/7L3fXfLYJX
Fortunately, Judge O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs ruling does not alter health care for now; even the White House acknowledges that the ACA remains the law of the land pending certain appeal: https://t.co/7L3fXfLYJX

@hamiltonproj @GreensteinCBPP "People get kicked off programs because public programs are bad at protecting people who should be exempted.

You can read more about these vulnerable populations, and the Kentucky proposal here: https://t.co/EXOkxyST7l
Older Americans:  More than 8.5 million Americans age 50-64 get health coverage through Medicaid. But, older Americans face particular challenges in meeting work requirements, with losing care likely to lead to severe health outcomes: https://t.co/5h7Bkyt0m4 https://t.co/4IglLO0WdX
American Indians and Alaska Natives: Medicaid is an important source of coverage &amp; care for these populations -- &amp; these people face high unemployment &amp; persistent health disparities. These policies would take that care away: https://t.co/baYiPhYjTf
People with substance abuse disorders: People with substance abuse disorders are at a high risk of losing coverage and access to treatment under these policies: https://t.co/g0v2nQ8ZV3
People with mental health conditions: Many people with a mental illness that keeps them working would be at risk of losing coverage: https://t.co/OX6ZHwAMiB https://t.co/LFkTLN04dr
People experiencing homelessness: These people are more likely to have a disability than the general population, but they have a harder time proving it. Under these policies, these people will face major barriers to work: https://t.co/QTd3hFTC3y https://t.co/aVfATFed4t
Children: When parents have health insurance, their children are more likely to be insured. If the parents lose their health care due to these policies, their children may follow suit: https://t.co/Bs8YXiwl2H https://t.co/oRB6WHY9Z0
Women: Nearly 40 million women get their health care though #Medicaid. Policies that take Medicaid away would harm many women who are caregivers for children or other family members, worked in low-wage jobs, or have disabilities: https://t.co/iT4cGy4uzY https://t.co/WNklnalnKo
People with disabilities &amp; serious illnesses: Nearly three-fifths of all non-elderly adult Medicaid enrollees (almost 5 million people) do not receive disability insurance &amp; would therefore be subject to these requirements: https://t.co/uxlbpb5bcn https://t.co/WqcN2QAWdL
Rural residents &amp; communities: Rural populations depend heavily on Medicaid &amp; would be at risk for coverage losses, reductions in access to care, &amp; hospital closures: https://t.co/5RD9vN2V83 https://t.co/hGG7FkTOYG
Low-wage workers: For people with low-wage jobs, such as food services, construction, or retail, work hours often fluctuate from month to month, leaving them short of the required minimum in some months even as they exceed it in others: https://t.co/VBkwumuplM https://t.co/uVO9WLXhW0

The impact would be particularly harsh on pregnant &amp; postpartum women &amp; children, as forgoing health care &amp; food assistance could have serious negative consequences for them in both the near &amp; long term: https://t.co/DA0n6ODK5E
This almost certainly would convince many families to forgo much-needed benefits that they are currently eligible for including food assistance, health care, &amp; tax credits: https://t.co/DA0n6ODK5E
The changes also would mean that some people seeking to come into the U.S. lawfully to join family could be kept out if anyone in their family has received, or if immigration officials consider them likely to receive, any of these benefits in the future: https://t.co/DA0n6ODK5E

You can read our full overview of this matter here: https://t.co/Uphlm97bzW
Policymakers cannot have it both ways: support for dismantling these protections in whole or in part is not compatible with support for ‚Äúmaintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions.‚Äù https://t.co/Uphlm97bzW

Afterwards, several leading congressional Republicans said they did support the ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions. 		But their statements ignore the Admin's and the Republican's own multiple efforts last year to end/weaken these protections in their ACA repeal bills.
Instead of defending the ACA's core protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, the Trump Administration instead urged the court to invalidate these protections. https://t.co/Uphlm97bzW

@deancbpp @GOPoversight The #2018FarmBill represents a missed opportunity. Rather than promote work, strengthen program integrity, and support the needs of low-income households, it would move us in the wrong direction by threatening our progress in recent years. - @deancbpp
@deancbpp @GOPoversight "Millions of families would be at risk of losing benefits due to bureaucratic errors. Any clerical slip-up by workers or caseworkers could mean lost benefits." - @deancbpp
@deancbpp @GOPoversight The #2018FarmBill includes several significant benefit cuts, including one that end eligibility to some 400,000 working households.  - @deancbpp
@deancbpp @GOPoversight "Unfortunately, the #2018FarmBill that the House will likely consider next week would reduce SNAP‚Äôs effectiveness.		It would cause more than 1 million low-income households with more than 2 million people to lose their benefits or have them reduced."
@deancbpp @GOPoversight "Errors are not the same as fraud.  Many conflate the two. Fraud is intentional activity that breaks federal and/or state laws, but program stakeholders ‚Äî particularly recipients and states ‚Äî also may inadvertently err in ways that could affect benefit amounts." - @deancbpp
@deancbpp @GOPoversight "USDA and states have mandated some of the most rigorous program integrity standards and systems of any federal program." - @deancbpp

16/ Stay tuned for here for analysis later today explaining what to look for in Farm Bill.
15/ House Ag Chairman Conaway‚Äôs proposal likely to include damaging SNAP cuts, with $ saved channeled to pay for expensive, untested new work requirements that are unlikely to be effective ‚Äì except at creating vast new bureaucracy to administer them.
14/ Understanding the drawbacks of work requirements is important now, because Congress is set to start debate on Farm Bill and SNAP work requirements soon.
13/ To help those who struggle to succeed in today‚Äôs labor market takes real investments in job training, child care and other areas.‚ÄØ Despite rhetoric in EO, these investments are noticeably absent in Trump budget. https://t.co/wamVBbUXiS
12/‚ÄØRequirements often hurt people with serious health conditions; hurt workers who can‚Äôt get enough hours some months or find themselves between jobs; &amp;hurt children when their families can‚Äôt get food assistance or their parents can‚Äôt get health care or can‚Äôt pay the rent.
11/‚ÄØEvidence‚ÄØshows that such requirements have few long-term positive effects on employment &amp; often result in families losing help they need:‚ÄØhttps://t.co/nDNjEzJa3h
10/ The EO‚Äôs main policy prescription is to take basic assistance such as Medicaid, food assistance, and housing away from people who are not working or in job training or other employment programs.
9/ The Administration also cites faulty studies to claim that work requirements work.‚ÄØ https://t.co/BbjqoujG1d &amp; https://t.co/XxWKOr4C3e
8/ But Administration seems to miss the point.‚ÄØ There are strong incentives to work ‚Äì and those out of work are generally very poor and have serious barriers to employment.  Taking away basic food assistance or health care won‚Äôt help them overcome those barriers.
7/ Contrary to statements by the President, our assistance programs and tax credits have strong incentives to work.‚ÄØ In fact, the White House fact sheet cites the Center‚Äôs analysis showing that work pays. https://t.co/cQF6uHLzV9
6/ Those who aren‚Äôt working often have physical or mental health conditions that limit their ability to work, or are caregivers for family members.‚ÄØ Others have very low skills or live in disadvantaged communities with few job opportunities. https://t.co/dQxc2THvfw
5/ Why do these workers and their families need assistance? B/c they work unstable jobs with low wages, unsteady hours, &amp; no sick leave or health insurance.‚ÄØ Examples of these jobs are home health workers, cashiers, and laborers. More here: https://t.co/5hAirP0wrr
4/ Most working-age Medicaid recipients (not receiving disability benefits) also work: https://t.co/bnBnutsOzZ‚ÄØ It is true of housing recipients too: https://t.co/bk0fWxpUwb
3/ Most working-age adults who receive assistance are working or between jobs.‚ÄØ 80% of SNAP households w/ a working-age adult (not receiving disability benefits) are currently working or work in the year before or after SNAP receipt: https://t.co/o23au7vEKd
2/ Basic assistance programs have long-term positive effects as well ‚Äì improving children‚Äôs long-term health and education: https://t.co/w9sGIOvAd3 https://t.co/xvY8yMUr7J
1/ Yesterday's executive order (EO) &amp; ‚Äúfact‚Äù sheet mischaracterize programs that provide basic assistance to struggling families. ‚ÄØThese programs lift millions of Americans out of poverty.
