@RealKDT23 @KingScienceYT I have made over 50 animations and u have made like 3, and they're bad ... HOW THE FUCK do you expect to be where I am. And you act like you don't use reference picture, where you CLEARLY HAVE DONE SEVERAL TIMES, and they still are trash drawings.
@RealKDT23 @KingScienceYT I completely forgot about u, along with the hundreds of dm's that I have gotten from other random people who want to collab with me. Ur not special bro, accept it, urdelusional. The only reason why I am where I am and u are were u are is simply because you are bad at what u do.
@RealKDT23 @KingScienceYT You are just mad salty because I never responded to ur untalented BORING UNFUNNY ASS OVER 2 YEARS AGO when you dm'd me because I saw then that your content was SO BAD that it wasn't even worth the little exposure you could have offered me seeing tht u had more subs at the time.
@RealKDT23 @KingScienceYT more talent in their pinky than in my entire body* Anyway homie, do whatever you want, that right there is an example of a sad ass nigga trying to tear down another black man. I'm just done with his sorry ass. You will never get another second of my attention.
@RealKDT23 @KingScienceYT This nigga think I don't want to "get caught" cause I finally decided to block him everywhere cause I'm tired of seeing his delusional ass 😂. I know artists with more drawing talent in their pinky in my body who uses refpictures ALL THE TIME. I don't give a shit about u

If you make art from a place of wanting to imitate, wanting to be rich or famous, no matter how many resources you have or how many co-signs you get, it will be hollow. But if it comes from ur soul, even if all you have are the most basic tools, you can create something special.

Doing hard physical labor is also very therapeutic. After you finish and are in pain and feel like you're about to die, I promise you'll be way too tired to care about that person that didn't text you back, or that thing someone said to piss you off.
Procrastinating on something? Go do something that's physically hard for you, something you think you might not be able to do, maybe run a couple miles. After you finish, you'll realize that you are capable of more than you think. All of a sudden that task you gotta do seems easy

You ever wonder why you still follow certain people? Y'all dont care about each other, y'all don't talk, they wouldnt lend you $10 if you needed it. But still, unfollowing them feels weird if they happen to you back, esp if you've been aquainted for a while.
