@TezlynFigaro The thing to remember is that HC only got those votes because her and the DNC rigged it so he came out on bottom.
@Slate Uh, depends in weather you differentiate predator and pedophile. I mean, do you kill people for their thoughts or actions?  But anyone who puts hands or hurt on a child deserves worse than I could type on here with out getting my account banned. Something with salt and a razor.
@charliekirk11 I mean every one of them has been doing this, oddly for... like almost 80 years now, figure it out.

@V0lgaR @ggreenwald And I'll bet YOUR bottom dollar that when they reopen the Epstein case trump will be indicted or at least implied as a coconspirator.
@V0lgaR @ggreenwald There's no projection there buddy,  he's friendly with one of the biggest names in pederastery, he's talked about how 'sexy' his daughter is, from the time she was born till the time she became an adult. He degrades and molested women, he walked in on pageant kids..
@Progressive that moment when you switch off of progressive, save $150 a month, then a week later @Progressive steals $600 from me and "can't" return it for over a week.
@luvmesum20 Egg and banana pancakes made at home.
@officialJim0 fucking bummer man, this is the second time a fan page followed me, and I got excited thinking JIM followed ME.
@ggreenwald Yeah but he also explained in gratiating detail, trump is a dirt slimy bitch. My question is why nobody asked about him raping teenagers, walking in on pageant girls and shit, the gross and palpable desire he has for his own daughter.
@realDailyWire @JoeBiden Joe is a predator.  https://t.co/BErrn3XB38

@KellyScaletta @Aloysius_Funk @ArronJohnson @wikileaks You're not wrong, but I ask you to name anyone that isn't dishonest or one sided in their reporting, the campaign demands open honesty and integrity.  I have some ideas on how we can fix this,  some are rather reasonable, like lie detection live on @YouTube, some less so like #AI
@KellyScaletta @Aloysius_Funk @ArronJohnson @wikileaks I mean like everyone else on earth, yes about some things and no about others, some was obvious, some wasn't. You can easily tell his statements about the Trump's as people were accurate I mean, the guy literally looked right into the camera and called him out twice.
@SenSanders Vote #Franks2024 for full dismantling of the DEA, public hearings for the officers proper moral refocusing if the law and prison system, health and safety standards for the chemicals used on our foods and in our water, blah blah something #honesty over everything.
@SenSanders All drugs, #safe #clean places to do them, but you gotta talk to a #therapist while you get high.  Also @SenSanders Bernie you need more than decriminalization for the stoner vote, stoners are more discerning in their politics than most. Watch me....#WeedLover #smokeweedeveryday

@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 I'm sorry for rambling, but I'm tired of this melancholy in every aspect of life. This thing needs a shot of life into the most lifeless area of our lives, big politics and business lobbies/ts you can't #lie about who pays your #Bills  when you keep hearing your #parents voices.
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 All gone with the #mushrooms , you become who you think you could be at both your #best and #worst, and and the ability to perceive #time changes in a way that is #indescribable without you having tried it, and even then its #noteasy.  To know everything you know at once #shudder
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 What's more important? Discussing your #passion or fighting a #Dragon   where's the trillions of dollars lost by the #Bush administration? Something something #PatriotAct, adverts, #brainwashing. All encompassing, manipulative, #music decisions, above and behind the scenes....
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 If you can't hold on to your ideals and composure  when the world melts into a teacup....or you are the grass, are you crab grass or are you Kentucky Blue?
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 If you can't hold down your own #mind how can we #trust you with running the nation. So many of these #politicians talk a lot of finely weaved spiders silk about policy this and who lies where. But nobody stands up for anything, and a battle like this forces ones mind to adapt.
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 Entheogenic battles of the mind, a live debate with uncensored unrestricted full maximum level clearance and data collection. While participants are on 3-19 g of psychadelic mushrooms, even straight jacketed if it made anyone feel safer. And just get bombarded with questions.
@JP_Obienugh @charliekirk11 Yeah, but the whole rest of his testimony, and the moments you could tell the changes between from lies and truth here and there....absolutely paint a solid picture of the kind of person trump is...I'd say the same thing I tell everyone, #vote #Franks2024 #mushroomfights.
@krassenstein It looks like today,  was, and is, as is most days a victory and defeat for honesty and due process.

@GenX_Aussie @ClintEastwoodLA Granted I did bait the trap but hey its Clint Eastwood calling out Jim carrey in the giant psychic minefield that is Twitter. About the president. Donald trump. You grab anyone who died before the year 1997 and told them our current situation they would probably have a breakdown.
@GenX_Aussie @ClintEastwoodLA People think someone does a thing like this on a whim, they're a jerk, or angry, or left, or right, blue, red, Navy vs. Electric blue, Crimson v. Mauve, thinking someone is racist because they argue is silly. You projected a shit ton in your posts at me.

Every major race since, he's lost, trump proves it.
@GenX_Aussie @ClintEastwoodLA So let's really get into the meat of this, this tweet by the magnamously prolific actor Clint Eastwood responding to a months old picture with such ire is because he can't read and or comprehend "quotation" anymore.
@GenX_Aussie @ClintEastwoodLA 1. Turn of phrase	2. Learn what a quote is	3. Who's angry? U mad bro? Some people can use words and not get angry, apparently mr. Eastwood isn't one eh?	4. You couldn't annoy me if you tried, I've been being an asshole to strangers om the internet since before 3G.

Hot pockets and mac and cheese while watching television,  being fed a false narrative of life and the world...I remember watching the news every day as a kid being just aghast that these kinds of things(gang violence, drugs, racism, war, etc.) And then finding out our gov't
We didn't need, and for politics we had no business being in.		I grew up alone more often than not either watching myself or at my grandmother's while my mom worked two jobs and my dad sucked dick in prison. I spent the important formative years of my life alone eating..
The times of hippies, heroin,  the crack epidemic, shitty families filled with alcoholism and neglect, govt poisoning the water and food around us, the people in charge profiting off of and encouraging it, while sending our sons and daughters to fight in wars for resources...
But what we need are competent, compassionate leaders...and that's something we haven't had for a long time. 	So let this stand as my message to you and the rest of the world, here I am... a damaged only child born to a single mother and a dead beat dad, both who grew up in...
The right thing to do, this vs. That, Red, vs. Blue, then vs. now, them vs. You.		We all know what's right and wrong it's not hard if you actually thinkabout it and not just say whatever comes to the surface first... @davidhogg111 said something about a compassionate leader...

@FDRLST @TomFitton It's not a mental disorder though it's a side effect of the chemical poisoning the gov't has been instituting for the past 60 years. Bisphenol A and Atrazine...any trans person who thinks otherwise needs to ask themselves "how is it that my group is magically safe from the con?"

@lognsmed @brokencongress @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril America's 1984 is much more macabre than  Orson welles'.  Instead of being punished for thought crimes they make us punish ourselves. You punish yourself by being so angry at an actor, or at a stranger on the internet. We punish ourselves by allowing too much evil in the world.
@lognsmed @brokencongress @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril Is made from a synthetic estrogen compound and that shot was used in almost everything for a time.  This gender dysmorphia shit didn't used to exist, and people didn't get cancer at the rates they are, and there weren't as many aspies...remember truth is stranger than fiction.
@lognsmed @brokencongress @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril Trans isn't real its genetic poisoning and manipulation perpetrated by the upper echelons of power, they know atrazine caused hermaphrodition in less complex organisms and used it to increase the moral and sexual discord in america. On top of that the 'weird palstic' I linked

@lognsmed @WorkDimensions @Yokobaby @Beverfab @ReignOfApril It really is you, yoooouu came on Twitter and wanted to bad mouth someone instead of aiming up, the fact that a few off handed comments i made before work were able to occupy your thoughts all day show you don't have the ability or capacity to have a conversation with meaning.
@lognsmed @WorkDimensions @Yokobaby @Beverfab @ReignOfApril You mean like you did of bendy there? Remember you were the one with the weak source of a third hand opinion, and the assumption that a role he played in a movie was his personal attack at trans people. You've spent all day blowing this up while I had a great day at work.
@brokencongress @lognsmed @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril And the links were to documented poisons the USDA and us govt have been putting in our water and food for about 50 years that's proven to cause all kinds of cancer,  abd another they used to package the food.

@lognsmed @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril So 1. No trans or queer in any form person knows the struggle of slavery the death the rape the loss of family the way people like you and me trivialize their plight by bitching on the internet.

@lognsmed @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril I'm developmentally disabled you presumptuous ass, so I'll use whatever words I want regardless because this is America. (Topical humor)   check this out everyone in the world is fucked up one way or another, everyone knows something you don't remember that.
@lognsmed @brokencongress @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril If you were born in the 50s they'd have killed you in broad daylight, and by they I mean sometimes your family.	 There are bigger issues in the world than weather or not you feel sad because someone made fun of you.
@lognsmed @brokencongress @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril It's called a caricature,  everyone in that movie is one... you think straight white males want to be targeted as bigots as a whole for the rest of eternity? No that's why  they're stopping, and if you think otherwise, just remember...
@Yokobaby @Beverfab @lognsmed @ReignOfApril 100%  he is, and he definitely shouldn't be vilified for things other people did.		The thing with everyone being problematic is there's a difference between being problematic because you hold a different opinion vs. Being problematic for its sake.
@brokencongress @Yokobaby @lognsmed @ReignOfApril But that clip that person shared was exactly what most in the media trans people are like, sexually ambiguous and confused assholes trying to make people feel bad for not wanting to touch their plastic and cut up body parts.
@brokencongress @Yokobaby @lognsmed @ReignOfApril It's not insensitive, its comedy of all these maladjusted, misinformed, soft children with no concept of history or actual hardship keep getting offended by everything, bad nearly unimaginable shit is going to happen.		Watching that clip(idk if all is in more of the movie or not)
@lognsmed @Yokobaby @ReignOfApril Mhm no, you didn't, you linked a clip from zoolander, that was it.		 Also, don't ever equate the half-assed suffering of trans people or retards to slavery, it makes you look foolish and uninformed.

To the point.
@MumGooner @rickygervais Or you're not with the other parent,  you're going to face challenges that you will fail, and that's fine, but you can't WANT to fail like so many of these parents now a days seem to want to.

and now it's about money or drugs, or violence or saying gang 25 times in a YouTube video. The point of a song like this one is the fact anyone can watch it and take away many different things.  It's a conversation starter.
.. etc. Music has always been a tool for explaining the world.. thing is back in the day people talked about  love, aspirations,  life, their dead friends and how much they missed them good ass nights...
It does not have too much vulgarity in it. Which means radio play maybe, which means people WILL hear it, will look it up see the video etc. Now we can use this  to relate to one another more and make a  better existence with our choices knowing the consequences of our actions .
But more importantly it was commentary on just black violence period. He's trying to tell his people to stop killing each other and even portraying it in a negative light it's still gotta have a catchy jingle so people will hear it. Because black man gotta make his money.

@decencyadvocate @TheLuisMReyes @jordanbpeterson That would depend o  how the A.I. was created, what it used for processing, and how advanced any if at all, sensory input and nuance the A.I. is capable of.
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson By manifesting in your mind the best good you can think of, to contemplate a more humane version of yourself, supposedly is  what god is. The perfect ideal without ideology?
@TheLuisMReyes That's why it's better to be men than gods.
@decencyadvocate @TheLuisMReyes @jordanbpeterson I mean I gotta do and be the best possible  so president Austin can have something to be in charge of when the time comes
@decencyadvocate @TheLuisMReyes @jordanbpeterson Definitely,  if you can imagine as well and as polished as possible it brings new depth and breadth to your capacity for compassion.  At least anecdotally from a former social awkward forever alone type to the badass bearded savior of America that I am today.

@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson Can't be more than human? Maybe, idk, but true people who take enthogeins are under the impression to varying degrees that being lit af on 5-20 dried grams of psilocibe makes us devine, even if only for an instant or two.
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson They doubt kill us for killing the planet
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson Sonethj Sonethj like the newest mass effect game, an A.I. that can determine the fluctuating importance of ethos and logos,  but to make sure that it doesn't go crazy wed need thousands of iterations of this a.i. put into baby minds so they can experience t by w full show so ..
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson I'd say a biological ai made by humans would be as flawed as we currently are. 		I know he his is woohoo AF right know, but I think we could make a computer based ai work but we'd need to do nazi level une try helical stuff, like implant the a.i. in a non intrusive manner....
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson Just a little longer, though this time without taking time away from the next generation.
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson Exactly so, which is why I believe T. McKenna stoned ape theory and believe after John Hopkins is done with their studies on then we can hopefully see a resurgence in not filling our bodies with side effect riddled medicines...maybe continue evolutionary progress and avoid death
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson That's supposed to be the point though right? Were so special because we can contemplate time/duration and our mortality. That's what makes us human.
@Nemosdrowning @John83067612 @jordanbpeterson Learning how to observationly influence more than watching ice crystals form?

Haha https://t.co/GqdbDqNkPM
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson While says the AI has to be computer based? Why not a semi symbiotic relationship with a plant or animal. Why it always gotta be machines? Why not elves?
@TheLuisMReyes @decencyadvocate @jordanbpeterson That was written poorly most, in purpose.

@kezdugdale @mandrews2000 You probably didn't,  but the brainwashing in our society makes people argue ideas they don't necessarily believe... for reasons they've never even thought about.

@thehill Of Society then I demand our society doesn't allow our government to poison us in literally almost every aspect of life. #food #water #soda #pop #entertainment #etcadnauseam
@thehill I'm sure they won't,  but I didn't cooperate in their crimes,  I shall not continue to pay for the crimes of fat-cat politician's check signers or the media industries lies, and if I'm to live a good ass life, have a good ass wife.  Have some kids and be a productive member...
@thehill Or the people who sprayed radioactive mist in st. Louis, or the people they are depicting in that new @gringomovie pieces of shit all of them.
@thehill Now I'm serious here, if /when I become president and I find out that *insert names here* were culpable in the systemic poisoning and running down of our society that we bring back old form death penalty...like the guy who decided to put atrazine in the water supply.
@thehill Can I encourage #America to persue the death penalty against corrupt politicians and poisonous corporate interests?		#FlintTown #atrazine

@owlice @tedlieu Most if not all my claims will be proven true or false with @IBMWatson and the alphabet groups, and people's consent to file through their phones to find what really happened over the last 90 ish years or so. A lifetime as it were of the American government. Who actually killed..
@owlice @tedlieu All properly curated and colore d to trick the simple and brainwash the mediocre...there's never been a left or right, just people in charge we've never seen, and the puppets they pick, plus or minus a few dozen wildcards
@owlice @tedlieu Honestly with their track record and the things they've done from owning slaves,harboring nazis, revamping Japanese, sars blankets, the Indians, the Indians, and even almost all other societies at one point or another, especially though our own.mk ultra, crack, media, commercials
@CNNPolitics Why don't they have to have these "debates" about all the laws they pass? And while were waiting for this what are they signing while nobody's watching?

@jemelehill So have some!.
@jemelehill Why not do both teach women to be proud and strong, and to know they are beautiful, teach men to be proud and strong, and to know men and women are beautiful.	It's an obvious gap in compassion, don't teach your kids hate and there won't be any, they are sponges for your morals...
RT @ananavarro: Matt Lauer lost his job.	Charlie Rose lost his job.	Mark Halperin lost his job.	Glenn Thrush lost his job.	Billy Bush lost…
@SandersMedia @realDonaldTrump @FBI @CIA @NSAGov I know I want to be president because of the good people around me, everyday people that struggle and persevere instead of people that cause the struggle.
@SandersMedia @realDonaldTrump @FBI @CIA @NSAGov Right? Maybe if they'd sent him to a school with a well rounded well funded curriculum exposing him to art military knowledge, history etc. All in proper proportions he wouldn't be so eager to start a war.
@VladiBarrosa @TheGoodGodAbove He sent me, if he's real, if not in doing it because its the right thing to do, we need moderate, sane people in charge of this nation, not crazy racists or chronic victims.
@TheGoodGodAbove Hey, damn right, instead look through my post history and share of of that, tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone.  #Franks2024
@janeyhen16 @Independent No joke, my whole life I've been atheist and child free, after meeting my GF and some on the fly suspending of disbelief I prayed and it were answered. So I told my mom if I make it in the oval office then I'll give her a grandbaby. If this love of mine proves true and strong.
@SandersMedia Omg that's horrible what happened?
@SandersMedia I mean really you org.for the protection of our rights and liberties are gonna let this old racist orange be in charge of our nation, not that @HillaryClinton was any better, you've all failed with your ivy degrees and rich friends and influence. you all fail at life and love.
@SandersMedia Definetly, see @realDonaldTrump  was told that by his dad, and listened, probably because of American society back in the day. Or maybe his dad beat him and or his mom idk, but the @FBI @CIA  and @NSAGov  probably do. They could also tell us, because ya know decency. Them: ....
@SandersMedia Damn new phone... he's like that because when he was a kid people were like that, there's still a lot of them left, and just because they hate doesn't mean we should hate them. I'm sure his parents failed him in scores of ways just like the rest of us.
@SandersMedia And see this is what I'm talking about communicating with people in a real way, understanding, completely on such a level that  you don't get angry when people forget in different ways, we're all just human. Even that asshat @realDonaldTrump @donasure he's racist and bigoted....
@janeyhen16 @Independent Nowhere, ever, not by anyone that meant it....till now vote #Franks2024 it's for a healthy and happy America,  also I promised my mom.
@SandersMedia The book was good, even just with the few pages I read it was a smooth read, payday I'm getting me a copy.
@SandersMedia So once I've amassed millions of followers like so many before me, I'll start the trek... I'll save up and accept donations so I might travel the nation, on foot and talk to people,  like I am now. Find out what drives them, make honest and reasonable promises. Never sellout.
@SandersMedia That's my big plan, it's so simple EVERY CHILD IN EARTH KNOWS IT, be nice, talk with intention, honestly... don't be an ass, never shoot a man in the balls, respect women, for without them We perish.
@SandersMedia Fuggin A man, while I know that line, my A.D.D would prevent such a dramatic off the cuff quote..but I see the merit in the run with affluent right off. It's part of why I'm running in #Franks2024 because with how my birthday falls I'll  be the youngest president possible...
@SandersMedia Minus the using Marilyn Monroe as a living sex doll part
@SandersMedia I look at it plainly and simply, the president should not be rich, should not be a psycho/sociopath, Should actually love his wife,  and be able to talk to people or a person like they matter,  not like their a tv trope to insult or belittle.
@SandersMedia That's been my goal since I was like 8-10 and watched Clinton every night on the news talk about togetherness while bombing people and getting bjs in the oval office. That's not the ki d of shit the president, the moral bastion of America should be doing.
@SandersMedia I think the problem  is a lot of people, myself included though to a lesser extent..can't get off the red/blue wagon. I'm running as independent to the fullest. Figure 7 years is enough time to convince people through conversation, that I'm the man for the job.
@Independent I would, as a person without hate in their heart, it's easy...   #KimJongUn #kimjyou stop with the missile shit, keep your people alive until I'm president I'll fly over there personally, shake your hand and till a field with you as we plant food for your people.  HOW ABOUT THAT?
@SandersMedia Wouldn't that be some shit? If we could get people all around the world to block him? It's a horrid idea we wouldn't be able to keep an eye on him, but that feeling of an empty Twitter, 0 followers, and all the people he follows blocked him. His need for attn would drive him mad.
@unclehernie That's an excellent way to put it.
@SandersMedia Right? Like man, if literally anyone else in the world were as big of a hypocrite they'd be martyred in the streets.
@unclehernie Wait what what, you're a minister and believe in seperation of church and state?
@SandersMedia @SenJeffMerkley Hey there Randy, what kind of dog kids ya got?  Me and my lady have ourselves an Australian sheppard, a Basset hound, and a Beagle.
@saradani Honestly he sucked just as bad just differently,  everyone remembered him fondly because of movie cameos and the sax,  never mind the bombings and lies.
@SenJeffMerkley As a nobody with no ties to any organisation or any involvement with any bad business practices or anything of a suspect nature... but I'll be ignored because why,  I'm honest?  Or because I don't wanna be rich,  but happy?  End the apathy,  vote #Franks2024  for humanity.

@TheGoodGodAbove .. President? I know when I get elected in #Franks2024 I will be the most honest President, since Abe.
@TheGoodGodAbove @realDonaldTrump Donnie were you're parents to you as a CHILD? Honestly now, did they instill you with love or morals? A sense of pride and or justice? American ideals? Disregard all this left right B.S. can you honestly tell me you as want to be the one known as the openly evil.
@TheGoodGodAbove It really does guy, stop having babies because your told to and only when in an honest and happy relationship. Dammit.		Don't let the president be a racist or hatemonger, I don't blame them, they're old, and the world worked mostly one way during they're lifetimes. It's different
@SutherlandInst Honestly this kind of thing is why I want to be President,we live in a world where people don't think critically anymore... I remember when I was small,  journalists actually went after corruption and injustice, whenever our laws failed. If the news is a lie where's the truth?
@TheGoodGodAbove Thankfully, @TheGoodGodAbove , @jesus , and my mother gave me infinite love and just the right amount of neglect.
@SenJeffMerkley Deal, on the flip side, let's stop farming poppy/opium in the middle East and killing our own people? Maybe? Yes is the answer I'm looking for.

There's no magic answer in 140 or 280 chrs. It'll be a process that take a years, but yet I g to stop it is just going to hurt us in the long run.
@neiltyson No, it's just salt licks and headlights that don't rub you over
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro As of right now o got a shit minimum care bones healthcare, hardly pays for anything, and if have to potentially miss work to go to the doctor, and the not have enough money  to pay the bill because I had to miss work for that one day.
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro And feasible. I'm not going to try and tell you or anyone else that I have all or even any answers, but I can say boy d a doubt I'm more empathic and understanding than most. If you come to me with the truth of a matter I can help determine the best route forward.
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro And that's amazing for you,  but not everyone has access to that kind of support, we have to take care of the people here and now in order to be  able to care of future generations.  There are people smarter than me out there that with approval and support cab make UHC real...
@ceilidh_2855 @13isGodsend True that, if you can't tell a person is bipolar or manic depressive after being around or with them for more than a few months ... there's something on that list you need to have checked out.
@GeoffreyWeiss @benshapiro Taking up one day and being sick, shouldn't put you in the poor house.
@GeoffreyWeiss @benshapiro Healthcare becomes a non concern and we move to other problems like education,  societal failings,  space travel.  Etc.
@GeoffreyWeiss @benshapiro It's really simple gut the companies and agencies and organizations that have been proven to squander and hoard their donations to pay it forward, do good did others for them not for yourself
@GeoffreyWeiss @benshapiro They're already there,  Obama care aka affordable care act formerely of Romneycare was a small step in the right direction, there are people out there smarter than me trying to get this done.  I'm just a guy that realises empathy is more important that a (D) or(R) next to my name
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro But you also need to pull the weeds and rocks,  till the soil,  grow some food.  Nothing real Ever happens In and  instant.
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro We can definitely afford it just need to stop spending on so MUCH military soebdibg,just a bit of redistribution of funds. I bem I've Trump said skmeeth ing about draibib g the swanp....good idea
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro 100% and I agree, your kids should be able to be raised without the fear homelessness because they get sick.
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro We're capable of harsh evils and phenominal goods. It's a matter of intent. Everyone is okay with murder as long as it's not here, if we had better health care we'd have better mental care. It would be less likely. We could stop lying to each other about everything we can and ...
@TheeJohnnyquest @benshapiro Realistically we're humanity man,  we best the nazis and we dropped nukes on Japan, we've done good and bad chugging the fat cat ceos and retired families from generations past selling opioid to everyone and their brother, mother, sister,  us into, the neighbor kid and almost me
@benshapiro He still cries somewhere.
@benshapiro You know because like life,  is important.  But so is not having to live poorly even if we're poor.  I'm poor because I pay my God damn taxes and and do have billions of other Americans throughout history gave their lives and families up, their sanity,  christ would cry and cry.
@benshapiro How about universal basic healthcare for all American citizens,  adjust for that and environmental preservation and renewal.
@TheGoodGodAbove @Pontifex if he was real you might maybe help me with becoming the first non politician president in what maybe 80 years or more? (Start off I'm a Dudeist: the dude abides)
