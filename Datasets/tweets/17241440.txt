Chemo (and surgery) will save my life. Radio is saving *me*.
Ok, sure...I crash hard at 3pm. Still, the excitement of breaking news, landing a solid live interview, anchoring an extra hour, or hosting a show solo nourishes me, reminds me who I am, and that breast cancer is NOT my identity.
Folks ask me why/how I keep working in between treatments. When that little red ‚Äúon air‚Äù light goes on, I‚Äôm on. 	It‚Äôs my normal. It‚Äôs empowering. It‚Äôs an energy that feeds on itself.

Day Two: I habitually check for FB on my phone; I‚Äôd already removed the app, but muscle memory is strong, resulting in my mindlessly and unintentionally opening Waze every 15-20 minutes.  I suspended my FB account.
I gave up both Facebook and drinking alcohol for Lent. 	Guess which is harder: 		*40 Days without FB*	Day One: Ash Wednesday. I logged in long enough to express my grief as Hank Dietle‚Äôs Tavern burned. I vowed to not peek again. By noon I had an eye twitch (not a joke).
