@tariqnasheed I can c the #ADOS movement going a couple ways moving fwd. I just hope it doesnt implode from ego about whos getting more recognition. The focus should be the agenda and not whos getting mainstream shine. Many of our ancestors laid the groundwork, its up 2 us to carry the torch.
@Raunchy_Rae @la_de_da_da @Freeyourmindkid All this slander because #ADOS is gaining mainstream traction. Im not sure the motives I have some theories though. 1/ They want to discredit it bcz they want a Dem so bad in office in 2020. 2/ They want #ADOS to stay at the bottom of barrel as a whole....

@ACSawyerJustice @_ZEROSYSTEM @tariqnasheed The tweet clearly said Shea Butter Twitter Feminist, not all black women. Then stated how the white feminist feel. Where did it blame anyone black?But you responded anyway?
@brianklaas Do we really think those are the "hitmen" that actually did it? Or just rounded up men already in prison. Or even more heinous took people off the street that oppose MBS? Not far fetched.
@naima @tariqnasheed Did you have the same vitriol for Eminem when he joked about Diddy putting a hit out on Pac, then said he was just kidding?
@diesegame @BeardedOne18 @theblackdetour A bunch of slogans.
@MaximusPhD @rolandsmartin @DineshDSouza Nah this is going to be a waste of time. Dinesh is paid 2 be a mouthpiece for White Supremacy. He's going 2 slander and use inflammatory statements against the Clintons and any opposition to Conservativism. Then deflect when he can't prove a point. If you're nt gettin paid no pnt

@rolandsmartin @Jbthegreatest45 @bcwatson1980 @cameron86790770 If he would've said he was a Black Man he would've contradicted his previous statement about race being a social construct (Man-made). Regardless, it was a weak posture and it back fired.

@rhonefraser @tariqnasheed @rolandsmartin But you called him out by name? That makes sense.
@realDonaldTrump If @NancyPelosi bites on this. Only reason hes saying this is because she's an easy target. Like when he labeled her a MS-13 sympathizer.
@LeonardPittsJr1 @rolandsmartin You're joking right? All these brothers &amp; sisters died under a Democratic administration. And none of the perpetrators were convicted.

@DLOliver Sir or Ma'am in reference to a THOROUGH investigation there are evidence found but nothing was done. https://t.co/XRpk0sDlTv
@DLOliver @HarryO1975 Travel/Muslim Ban, rolling back laws to criminalize marijuana users, taking the KKK off the domestic terrorist list, labeling Black Identity Extremists. We know all of these things aren't right and have been challenged. But that Administration  did it with no apology.
@DLOliver @HarryO1975 Sir or Ma'am, I stated a thorough investigation. I'm aware that Obama Admin. can't just bring charges to whomever they want. Also, I didn't say voting was NOT important. I simply clarified the original tweet. Just like the Trump administration sets an agenda for the DOJ ex...
@HarryO1975 Once again it was in relation to voting. It was making a comparison to voting now and voting under the Obama Admin. Where he signed off on the "Blue Lives Matter" Law.  You're interpreting the original tweet to an outside entity helping or protecting you physically.
@BreitbartVideo https://t.co/Bpcfsu6NFO
@HarryO1975 Brother respectfully,  he's referring to policies not protecting unarmed Black Americans and indictments on these race soldiers. Specifically Dept. of Justice under Eric Holder not investigating thoroughly in Ferguson PD. Read all his tweets its in relation to voting.
@yookc Tom Brady's trainer Alex Guerrero?
@Monae_Kel When you say mobilize you mean back the candidate with money that will specifically push their agenda. As oppose to no candidate having specific policies/agendas for Native Black Americans when they get in office. Instead of the vague POC phrase.

@BougieBlackGurl in the same. And to say that one Black victim is greater than another Black victim is really sick. While there is a war going on you’re sitting here debating which deaths didn’t get more media coverage? Which only creates circular diatribe of futility. @Mr_Hopkins8 just stated...
@BougieBlackGurl Everything Black is centered around protecting males? Well it’s doing a horrible job by your logic. And to say a black woman’s/girl’s death didn’t matter because it wasn’t publicized alot is asinine. BW &amp; BM deaths as the result of racial injustice or prejudice are tragedies ...

@FoxNews @Scaramucci @POTUS These minions are so shook, funny he will never be loyal to you tho. https://t.co/BHSKkC0yvy
@FoxNews @LawrenceBJones3 So does that mean the American citizens in #PuertoRico 🇨🇺?
@IntrospectGavel @PMGWorks @DrUmarJohnson You’re trolling at this point &amp; that’s cool. Imma leave you with a prediction: Slim is going to come out the hearing and say he was stripped out of his license. But in actuality he never had it. Then he’s going to say I’m still going to “Saaaave Liiives!!!” But mfs with sense kno
@IntrospectGavel @PMGWorks @DrUmarJohnson here is my opinion on your child/patient etc...that would be fine. Nobody would be trippin if the info is helpful. But on top of the school shit and saying he #1 this and that.  Shit lame
@IntrospectGavel @PMGWorks @DrUmarJohnson Didn’t he tell everyone to call to check his credentials on the TV1 appearance? Young Pharaoh broke that down. Once again, the license is on trial and him telling the truth. Which leads into what else hasn’t he been honest about? If he would’ve said I’m not licensed but....
@LoSetley @AprilDRyan Obama with white hands and Hill with “Man hands”....like the #meme tho https://t.co/5H0JgT9J4b
@espn @GoodmanESPN @Lavarbigballer has to be saying this for a reason. But I seriously doubt Luke has lost the team. This can’t be going over well with team officials.
@rolandsmartin @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos Who let you in the back door? How’s the auditions coming? https://t.co/So0snglwKZ

@_ST3V3N_W @FoxNews @SebGorka Perfect comparison
@SaNeter7 @YouTube Sa, you should've let Brother Reggie speak on it. Put out what you need to get those TV operating.
@TalibKweli @diabolichiphop Reflection Eternal @HiTek is the one best hip-hop albums of all time. People need to go revisit that album.
@IntrospectGavel @DrUmarJohnson Only thing on trial is the Prince of Pan-Seared Steak practicing clinical psychology with no license. That's it and that's all.
