Fact https://t.co/paE0CAJYav
Yes. This is concerning, but it is not unexpected. The Dems have moved from entertaining anti-Semitism and anti-Israel voices, to fully embracing them as the party's future. Let us not forget how the 2012/16 Party leaders booed Israel and God. https://t.co/fl0fXH3Bng https://t.co/Rd4aclWEQJ
