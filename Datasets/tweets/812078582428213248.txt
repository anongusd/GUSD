I want to continue to work to promote common sense reforms in the party‚Äînamely, a coordinated turnout apparatus and a higher standard of cyber security. Finally, I want to continue to collect and analyze data to help local officials and future candidates to be more effective.
It has been an honor to serve on the Alabama Democratic Executive Committee. I want to use my platform here in this new year to recruit top-notch candidates for local offices and to engage and involve more young people in local Democratic organizations.
If 2018 has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that life and politics can be very unpredictable. While I am certain that I do not know what 2019 holds, I have made a few resolutions for myself and I would like to share some of these aspirations with my family and friends.

The choices in all of these races is very clear. #ALDems up and down the ticket are more competent, qualified, innovative, and ethical than the Republican incumbents.
For AG, we can elect the Republican incumbent who was appointed by Robert Bentley has been leading a shady effort to gut Alabama‚Äôs ethics laws, or @JoeSiegelman, a young attorney who is very well regarded in the legal community and is the son of a former governor.
For Public service commission, we can re-elect the politicians who gave Alabama the second highest utility rates in the nation, or two women, @electkaripowell and @IAmCaraMcClure, who will partner to advocate for lower prices.
For the associate justice of the Supreme Court, we can elect the head attorney for Mike Hubbard, or a fighter for the rule of law, @SmalleyWesson
For Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, we can elect a longtime ally of Roy Moore who attended a celebration for the founder of the KKK, or a highly regarded Birmingham Judge, @BobVanceJr
For state auditor, we can re-elect the man who said Roy Moore‚Äôs alleged pedophilia was biblical, or a woman who will be a brick wall against corruption, @VoteMirandaJ
For Secretary of State we can re-elect the man who presided over the universally criticized implementation of AL voter ID law, in which dozens of DMV offices were closed in majority-minority areas, or choose a woman who will protect the fundamental right to vote @heathermilam
For Lieutenant Governor, we have a choice between another run-of-the-mill career politician, and a brilliant pastor from the Shoals, @willboydforAL
The choice is clear Alabama	For governor, AL has a choice between a woman who is nothing if not complicit to Montgomery corruption and scandal, and an innovator who led Tuscaloosa to rise up from the rubble of a tornado into the fastest growing big city in Alabama, @WaltMaddox

President Trump is totally confident in his support for a tax cut for the rich, but he can‚Äôt decide whether or not he wants to peruse policy changes to save kids lives.
The President of the United States can‚Äôt even decide whether or not he supports common-sense measures that have overwhelming bipartisan public support and that would have saved many if not all of these young lives.
Mayors can limit access to weapons of war within their cities. Instead of acting, however, so many in these leadership positions remain silent.
It takes more than congress to allow the NRA‚Äôs obstructionist methods to succeed. State legislatures and governors have the power to initiate assault weapons bans and universal background checks. County commissions have the power to tax ammunition at a much higher rate.

The Republicans have lumped in repealing the ‚Äúcadillac‚Äù tax with #CHIP. Ironically, the republicans who support repealing the fiscally responsible Cadillac tax are fewer than those who support #CHIP.
80% of Americans say #CHIP extension should be a priority for congress. Unfortunately, the Republicans want to throw in special interest giveways instead of fixing the problem. We need a clean CHIP reauthorization now.
65% of Americans say dreamers should be a top priority for congress. Unfortunately, rather than passing a clean bill that fixes the mess created by the president, Republicans want to load it with special interest giveaways. #DreamActNow
