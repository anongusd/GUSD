Hard to believe there is a written law that #discriminates against #grandparents! Yet, there it is! And we live it!		#PArentalRights	#EqualRights		We want the right to protect our #kids !
@TheDCPCPolice Hey, we have 50. Nobody believes that grandparents who adopt are discriminated against. Including PA lawyers, politicians and other who read the law. We are proof. We live it! Keep on keeping on!
@AARPBlackCom We need help fighting a discriminatory PA law that denies grandparents parental rights after adoption. AARP ready to help?
We fight for #PArentalRights because we are denied by law!	People can read the law and tell us their thoughts. Ok.	We live it! 	We are denied and our #kids suffer due to it!		#EqualRights 	#Constitution 	#EqualityForAll 	#Trauma
@GovernorTomWolf When will PA remove discrimination on grandparents written into PA law? #PA23s5326

Please search "PA title 23 section 5326" and learn for yourself that it is clearly discriminatory!		It is not a protection of any grandparent rights!		If you think it does, we will show you proof otherwise!	We live it!		#EqualRights	#PArentalRights
@AmericaDialogue Pennsylvania Title 23 Section 5326 	Effect of Adoption. 	Not an #adoption law, but a #custody law affecting adoption.
It's not about #race #color #religion #LGBTQ+ #sex #gender #disability #age nor #NationalOrigin to be discriminated by the written law! 		Just being a #grandparent is enough for Pennsylvania!		#EqualRights		And it is enforced in 49 states! Thanks #UCCJEA !

@TNRWJohn For so many others, the lack of resources may be the cause of separation. The separation of a child from a loving parent is hard on the parent and destructive to the child! Laws and money are against far too many in this battle!
@TNRWJohn For us..If separation includes discrimination, yes. The cost to fight the law certainly is resource intensive. Having a plan to fight it is in the works, but time is not kind and the speed of the courts is against protecting kids!
@TNRWJohn Let me be fair and include our followers that support us! Thank you for being good people and turning the odds in our favor for #ParentalRights!
We can attest to this with #RAD ! The range of affects is dramatic, but can be reduced and managed. We hope eliminated over time!	"Most obvious changes were in the brain regions that help balance emotions and impulses, as well as self-centered thinking."	https://t.co/M4fgJFPXZz

@naturalised_TX @TNRWJohn Depending on judge and jurisdiction it may not even take custody, just a simple 2 min contact that could construe things against a person. Especially when you have a judge out to get you. And understood the defamation. Use caution is what I am saying!
@naturalised_TX @TNRWJohn Yes. If he has custody and the son writes a letter it is ex parte and the letter can even be construed as coerced and used against him.

Morning @OcchealthRN are you a victim of forced custody by PA23s5326? Our goal is to fight this law as discriminatory.
@TNRWJohn Unfortunately the UCCJEA holds each state as equal to uphold another states injustice without due diligence nor a clause for a state to reject an injustice. And understood! No other state has a law like PA.
@TNRWJohn Don't go to Pocotello Idaho where it is illegal to not smile! Jail would be.nearly routine when we didn't have our kids!
@TNRWJohn It would not surprise us if they had traffickers lined up at the courthouse steps with a pocket full of "genuine concern"
@TNRWJohn Before 2010 the intent was clear. Protect rights of a grandparent who's child was deceased when another grandparent adopts. After that who knows intent. But Act21of2018 lets anyone with a "genuine concern" and no proof or notification of kin to take custody.
Custody laws are primarily written for divorce. PA forces shared custody of an adopted child with people unrelated to you or the child. Only when you are the grandparent! Predetermined unfit #parentting to make choices who should be in their life!
@TNRWJohn It gets worse when the system applies "Full Faith and Credit" and you are forced by Pennsylvania injustice while never being a resident of the "Commonwealth"
The USPS is the one gov agency that is cash positive. Actually was lucrative until the other gov hands started grabbing! https://t.co/jy95QrzjrT

@JeniceArmstrong While PA continues to discriminate against parental rights with PA23s5326 and @SenBobCasey pulls the wool over the rest of the U.S. eyes. Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act. At least @realDonaldTrump is standing for what he believes.
@jbaernews Is he opposed to PA's discriminating laws? I guess there are priorities! #PA23s5326 #PArentalRights
Who in their right mind thinks it is OK to discriminate against grandparents raising children? #SundayThoughts
@PastorPamm What is your stance? #ParentalRights or discriminate against grandparents and retain biased PA23s5326

@dharrislawprof We are on the edge of being criminals due to PA laws discriminating adoptive grandparents! The court gives #rights as a #parent yet predetermines that we're unfit! We can't protect or raise a #kid nor move w/o PA gov intervention! In 49 states! Thanks #UCCJEA !

Very confusing @GovernorTomWolf ! Please eliminate #discrimination in your own state law? Remove #grandparents from #PA23s5326 and grant #equality to #parent ! Together with @PaSenateDems and @PASenateGOP  you can do it! It is certainly nonpartisan! https://t.co/zPMGLvZpBm

Much thanks to @AmericaDialogue @GranddadSpirit @parentnotavisit for the Re-Tweets and Follows as we start our journey to gain our #ParentalRights !
Please @GovernorTomWolf remove 'grandparents and great-grandparents' from Custody Law #PA23s5326 and give all #adoptive #parents the same #ParentalRights as everyone else in Pennsylvania and 49 other states! We #love our #kids and deserve the #freedom to #parent #LetUsParent
Great article @AdoptUSKids ! It is so difficult to #discipline a child of #trauma ! One thing to add. Help the child understand their #feelings that cause bad behaviors. Then you have a means to dialog and find #resolution ! #ParentalRights #Abuse #EqualRights #Love https://t.co/m1iAmPyboq
#Biased state laws must be upheld by 49 states thanks to the lack of due diligence by @uniformlaws in the #UCCJEA . Why wouldn't you have a clause to allow states to refuse another state's laws that infringe on basic #ParentalRights ? #PA23s5326 excludes #adoptive #grandparents
@AmericaDialogue It"s horrifying as a #parent to see a recovering 2YO go from #independent #happy and caring to a #violent uncontrollable wreck. Even incapable of everyday tasks like dressing themselves due to a single forced #custody event with a past #abuser. #ParentalRights #ProtectFamiles
@AmericaDialogue Emotional, mental, and physical #abuse result in #trauma #disorders . The #OpioidCrisis has created a new generation of abuse. In many of our cases, #PA23s5326 allows others to continue their abuse after #adoption . Too many judges are ignorant of #childrens needs and triggers.
Many children with #trauma #disorders are not treated early enough! It is easy to control a small child being aggressive and #violent . When they grow to inflict serious pain is when most search for #treatment . Treatment is never too early! #RAD #PTSD #Adoption https://t.co/9KaefaKDlC
Fact: Moving closer to a person with shared custody is #ChildAbduction if your child's new home is across state lines. Thanks @uniformlaws #UCCJEA
