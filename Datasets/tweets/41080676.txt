@Ted_Howze Thank you for taking part in our representative democracy.
If it does happen, look for it happen quickly before the Dems realize this one is slipping through their fingers. Fareed also benefits from having top flight campaign and comms experts on his team. Quite a fight, but doable for the Republicans.
**Addendum** #CA24 - This Central Coast seat is regarded as marginally safe Dem and held by @carbajalsalud. Elections here have been close in recent cycles and @JustinFareed is in a great place to compete as Carbajal isn't quite in sync with the needs of the 24th. Fareed is.

Okay... that's it. I have coffee and bacon that requires my attention. 		/endrant
#AD80 ‚Äì Honestly, @LorenaSGonzalez Fletcher comes up with some of the worst ideas in the California Legislature. Vote for anyone else. Also because it would upset @nathanfletcher.
#AD73 ‚Äì Safe Republican seat, with incumbent @BillBroughCA seeking another term. However, I‚Äôd give my support to Mission Viejo Mayor @edsachs if I were in this district. Ed's a good guy.
#AD72 ‚Äì The seat being vacated by Travis Allen and his button-less dress shirts. These guys all seem to have issues‚Ä¶
Fortunately for him Scotto has small business experience and time in local government working for him and is a great campaigner.
#AD66 ‚Äì This South Bay LA seat needs to be a GOP pickup to deny the Democrats a supermajority in the lower chamber. @frank_scotto will advance to November along with incumbent Dem @AMuratsuchi , and that should be another huge fight.
Credit to her for that. Worth bearing in mind again the dynamics of the #CA39 and #SD29 overlap. TONS of GOTV from all sides at work. Not sure how this one turns out, but I‚Äôm supporting my friend Alex.
#AD65 ‚Äì My Assembly seat, and another closely watched swing district. Incumbent Dem Sharon @QuirkSilva2018 being challenged by GOP‚Äôs @alexandria_dr Coronado. By her own admission, SQS is far "less liberal this term" than her first, and is working the 65th hard.
#AD60 ‚Äì Swing district with but one Democrat and Republican, so a dress rehearsal for the fall, with its wildly different background than June will have. So who knows‚Ä¶ But one to watch.
of charges against Garcia (amazing how that happened‚Ä¶), her critics are calling her unfit for office. My friends in the trades tell me they are consolidating behind KDL ally @FrineMedrano for this seat.
#AD58 ‚Äì Another #MeToo case in this safe Dem seat. A fascinating proxy war between Speaker @Rendon63rd backing incumbent @AsmGarcia, and the building &amp; construction trades working hard to unseat her. Although the Assembly‚Äôs investigation could not "substantiate" the most serious
I believe Phil is secure for re-election. We‚Äôll see how November shapes up though with the overlapping contests.
#AD55 ‚Äì A shared district among LA and OC, occupying much of the same turf as battlegrounds #CA39 and #SD29, but Republican @PhillipChenCA sees to his district‚Äôs needs well and has been good at his job.
#AD42 ‚Äì ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù @ChadMayes wants another term. LOL. Anyone but Chad should get your vote.
#AD40 ‚Äì Currently held by Republican @MarcSteinorth, Democrat and San Bernardino County James @SupervisorRamos will pick this seat up. Could be close come November, but I doubt it.
#AD38 ‚Äì Any voter of moral conscience and decent character in this district will vote for Democrat Christy Smith @Christyfor38 over Republican @DanteAcostaSCV. #MeToo
#AD36 ‚Äì #SteveFox v @TomLackey36 Redux. Lackey for the win, I think. Who would go work for Fox anyway? Ugh.
#AD32 ‚Äì I've been watching this one several cycles now. NPP numbers nearly match the GOP‚Äôs here and could swing to outperform a Democrat in the right circumstances. This one has continually dangled out of reach of being a GOP pickup, but so far Dem @rudysalasjr has held on.
A friend, brother in liberty, and comrade in @RLCCA before I left the party, he has my unqualified endorsement, support and would do us all proud in the Assembly. Please support Matt. https://t.co/DuGx9ycDR5
#AD02 ‚Äì At this glorious point in our shared political history, there aren‚Äôt many people left in the @CAGOP organization or umbrella left for me to trust, but Matt @heath4freedom would leading among them.
#SD34 ‚Äì Dems have had this East LBC/Central OC district in their sights since Republican @JanetNguyenCA was elected. And with @GerrieSchipske pushed out of the way, #TomUmberg (who doesn't seem to be on Twitter) is looking to make it a battle. But we remember Tom, right OC?
(Very) outside chance, but with some perfect storm factors, Republican #RitaTopalian could end up looking very strong.
#SD32 ‚Äì Will be interesting to see what happens to former Sen @MrTonyMendoza, attempting to get elected again to the seat he resigned from just a few months ago. His departure under the glare of #MeToo set off a race with plenty of contenders.
That said, if the recall is successful, my support is going without hesitation to my friend and Fullerton Councilman @BruceWWhitaker. He‚Äôs been a great Mayor and member of my city council, and is a liberty minded Republican who would serve us well in Sacramento.
If you wanted a Republican in this seat, Republicans, you should have fought harder in 2016. This is a bullshit attempt at a do over. I GET that, and would have less issue if that's simply what this recall was portrayed as. (#bringyourhate)
It would make far more sense to have recalled the aforementioned Republican Senator Cannella since HE is the one who belongs to the supposedly anti-tax GOP. @JoshNewmanCA never made a promise to me never to vote for a tax increase.
In my view, a POLICY DISAGREEMENT is insufficient cause to remove a sitting officeholder before the end of her/his term. You want to recall a Democrat for voting in favor of a tax hike? That‚Äôs what Democrats do. They vote for tax hikes! It's in their DNA!
#SD29 ‚Äì The Newman Recall seat. My senate seat. Okay (if you don't hate me yet... deep breath‚Ä¶). I didn‚Äôt like the looks of this recall from the beginning, and I still don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why unlike many of my friends I will be voting NO on the recall.
#SD20 ‚Äì I know Republican Matt @munson91762 and he‚Äôs a good guy, worthy of your support and vote if you find yourself in this Inland Empire senate district.
#SD18 ‚Äì @SenateHertzberg gets another term but with a lot less hugs to go around. Seriously, the surviving #MeToo legislators ought to start a caucus (wait.... ewww).
#SD14 ‚Äì Another seat that looks like it ought to be tough for the GOP to hold on to, but @SenAndyVidak has been doing well by his district and working hard for their interests.
#SD12 ‚Äì Pro-tax hike Republican Senator @AnthonyCannella is termed out (and running for supervisor, remember that Stanislaus County). Voter stats show it as a tough seat for Republicans, but a Johnny @Vote4Tacherra is giving it a good run and might keep it in the GOP column.
#CA50 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt vote for @Rep_Hunter  I mean, come on.
Honestly thinking Dem @ApplegateCA49 is looking like the man to beat, for now. I'm seeing tons of grassroots backing behind him on that side.
#CA49 ‚Äì If I had to rank them, I‚Äôd see this as the Dems best odds for a pick up. Republican @DianeHarkey is running a strong campaign. I‚Äôd be far, FAR less enthused (like, not at all) about @RockyChavez4CA.
necks in this way. So honestly, I would have no issue if you just voted for Libertarian @brandonreiser. Oh, also the best odds in OC I think for a Dem shutout. Thanks again Prop 14, I guess.
to @ScottRBaugh, although I have every reason to believe I‚Äôd more or less like his voting record. And like Dana, Scott was also a supporter of mine as he was Assembly GOP Leader way back when I ran for Assembly in 2000. Distasteful to see good people at each others
#CA48 ‚Äì Sigh... @DanaRohrabacher has been a friend for many years and strong supporter in '00 and '02, and despite some real facepalming moments and some genuine disagreements on some policies, I‚Äôm feeling hard pressed to abandon my backing of him to give my support
#CA45 ‚Äì Another race in OC that will be watched closely. Looks like Democrat @katieporteroc has some big Dem backing and is poised to make this a race if she makes the top two with Republican @MimiWaltersCA. Still advantage -&gt; Mimi.
#CA43 ‚Äì This is ‚ÄúMad‚Äù @MaxineWaters‚Äô district. Obviously, she‚Äôs not going to lose here. So why mention this race? To caution you to vote for anyone but raving lunatic #OmarNavarro (who doesn't seem to be on Twitter anymore). Dude is seriously off it.
And yes, he too has adopted more Trump style talk than I am comfortable with, but I am hoping that‚Äôs just a campaign ploy.
(except to say that #MAGA loving, Trump humper @PhilLiberatore is a trash human being who thinks its fine to campaign in a cemetery on Memorial Day). I will say then that my friend &amp; county Supervisor @NelsonforOC IS getting my vote and I look forward to Shawn being in Congress.
#CA39 ‚Äì My home district, split among LA, OC &amp; SB counties and one of the several that all eyes will be on come Tuesday night. For a crazy moment or two I considered running myself. I could go on for hours about why one candidate or another isn‚Äôt getting my vote, but I won‚Äôt...
#CA34 ‚Äì Heavily Dem and favoring incumbent @JimmyGomezCA , but if you find yourself in this district, vote Libertarian @angela4congress.
#CA25 ‚Äì Have you been watching the Dem side of this fight? It‚Äôs gotten pretty ugly from what I‚Äôve seen, all the better for incumbent Republican @SteveKnight25. Could still be a nail biter come the fall, but I see a narrow win for Knight.
So the other option is to deny Republicans the majority. A more realistic outcome, and I hope this is precisely what happens. (Hence my not giving a shit about who‚Äôs at the top of the ticket for Republicans to drive turnout).
#CA23 ‚Äì So‚Ä¶ There are two ways to prevent House @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy from becoming Speaker. One is to deny him the chance to return to the House. Given this district, this is rather unlikely.
#CA21 ‚Äì Another big target for Dems as this cycle began was @RepDavidValadao. But again, he fits his district well. He‚Äôs also drawn only one opponent so June may be a good indicator for November. He's probably good.
#CA10 ‚Äì One of the ‚ÄúPelosi 7‚Äù targeted seats in California for the DCCC. Fortunately, @JeffDenham is the right kind of Republican for this district, and I see him making it to November and finishing well. Won't be easy, but doable.
#CA08 ‚Äì I really do like Tim Donnelly @PatriotNotPol and @TimDonnellysGun. He is a true patriot. But again, you embrace too much of the #MAGA and I‚Äôm done. So while I have some disagreements with @RepPaulCook, he‚Äôs who‚Äôd I‚Äôd choose here.
Instead, the entire @CAGOP establishment sold us out, and‚Ä¶ you know how that ended.
#CA04 ‚Äì Early talk was the Dems might have gone in strong against @tommcclintock. Seems that fizzled and Tom is likely safe. Honestly‚Ä¶ I just like to mention this race because it gives me an excuse to remind people that this guy should have been governor back in the '03 recall.
#BOEDist 2 ‚Äì Honestly, vote for anyone but San Francisco Supervisor @MaliaCohen. Straight up nanny statist right there. It‚Äôs a Dem seat so go with @SenatorGalgiani if you like.
Go with my fellow former GOP-turned NPP @StevePoizner, attempting a comeback to this post.
#CAInsuranceCommish ‚Äì Remember SB 562? The CA single-payer health care bill? That was @RicardoLara4CA ‚Ä¶ the state senator and leading Dem in this race. You want that guy running the CA Dept of Insurance? Of course not.
#CAAttyGen ‚Äì I would like to think I live in a world where CA Dems would choose @CA_DaveJones over @XavierBecerra ‚Ä¶ because AG Becerra is simply awful. (No, a Republican won‚Äôt matter here).
#CATreasurer ‚Äì Democrat @fionama is going to be difficult to defeat, but GOP candidate Jack @guerrero_cpa is not only qualified but great on the stump, despite adopting a bit too much Trumpish talk for my comfort. Still, he‚Äôs an @RLCCA friend and I‚Äôll give him my support.
#CALtGov ‚Äì All I can say is please don‚Äôt reward perennial run and lose candidate David Hernandez with your vote. The guy has literally run for office at every level of government multiple times and lost. There are serious candidates even if they have zero chance.
another office before 2024. A definite GOP shutout come November. Prime example of Prop 14's unintended (?) consequences.
#CASen ‚Äì No one beats @DianneFeinstein. Sure, @kdeleon is making a good show of it, and may end up exceeding his own expectations in fall, but look for Feinstein to carry through for another term, with KDL the expected successor in waiting if he doesn‚Äôt find
Republicans can lose the House for all I care, they need a good ass kicking anyway. Besides, it‚Äôs the Senate that is far more important for them to hold onto. And in that matter California will be totally irrelevant (see next tweets)...
(and Allen seems content to ride the #MAGA crazy train off the cliff). I‚Äôm also not sold on the logic that Cox needs to be in the top two to boost GOP turnout downticket for the congressional races.
Either of the Republicans could make top 2 and get crushed (@JoinTravisAllen) or make it interesting and still lose (@TheRealJohnHCox). My vote will be going to Libertarian Nickolas Wildstar @therealqball since neither Republican is a suitable option to me.
#CAGov ‚Äì Here‚Äôs a simple fact, the next Governor is going to be @GavinNewsom. The only question is who is going to lose to him in November. One of the other Dems might make the top two‚Ä¶ and either lose badly or make it interesting.
(with apologies to my non-political followers, I promise it will be over soon!)
We‚Äôre closing in fast on the 2018 #CAPrimaryElection, so I thought I‚Äôd offer some thoughts on how some of these races will turn out, and my own opinions on who I think ought to be voted for‚Ä¶ or NOT voted for. So if you haven‚Äôt yet voted here you go.

@53rdBroadway I'm quite sure the law the judiciary is acting upon had to have come from some sort of official entity. Law which is leaving the parents in this case with no choice but to watch their child die.
@53rdBroadway It's not my tax money, but if it were I'd certainly want it going to fight at every possibility for a child's life instead of to protect a government from it's own bad decision making.
@mertonia A ward of the court while both his parents are still alive and capable of performing their roles as parents? What cause does the court have to exercise such a role in those circumstances?
Less than six weeks away now from the #CaliforniaPrimary  on June 5. Holy crap that was fast... #Election2018
@53rdBroadway Forgive me... I didn't realize it was NHS' role to also put a proper price tag on the life of a child.
@mertonia Courts are bound to follow the law, correct? Or at least an interpretation of it. The government makes and executes those laws. How nothing in the law could have been changed to protect parents' rights after what happened to Charlie Gard last year is astounding.
The UK government is expending far more resources and power to protect a hospital than is has to protect the parents' right to seek any and all remedies to save their child's life.
