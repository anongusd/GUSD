@PeaEye1 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Schumer did not reject it. He was the one who came up with this idea.
@kat_pep_kat They were suppressing the vote for native Americans in North Dakota, only because the voter ID laws need a physical address not a P.O. Box #
@GOP @realDonaldTrump and @GOP will come to realize that elections have consequences
@GOP Yes he voted for 700 miles of wall, but didn’t come out with this absurd number of $5 Billion, and may I remind you there could have been a deal between the Dems. &amp; Trump only if he provided deal for the DACA children, BUT NO, he had to have it his way. @realDonaldTrump pt1

@forthepatrie @thehill So I wouldn’t say you cake legally.
@forthepatrie @thehill Your ancestors came from Britain/Europe if you’re white. I’m on Hispanic origin, my roots go down with the Aztec empire. Your roots go back from Europe. My people were massacred by the Spanish, like how the Native American population was dedicated by white Europeans

@forthepatrie @thehill That’s why I said 2nd class non citizens
So honestly @forthepatrie, if you really think walls work, think again, the Great Wall of China FAILED, the Trojans built a wall fortress around the city and FAILED, ultimately walls aren’t a good strategy, what are we playing Lord of the Rings with protective forts. I think not
@forthepatrie @thehill Haven’t you heard about the Trojan Horse from the Trojan War. The Wall didn’t prevent from the enemy coming in.
@forthepatrie @thehill Dude the Great Wall of China was so GREAT, that the monguls invaded it. Tell me do walls work in history.
@forthepatrie @thehill Because he can easily manage the DHS, &amp; tell his agents to knock it off and start treating these humans as humans. Not 2nd class non citizens

If anyone is a “anti-intellect “it be for the people whom voted for Obama but have Rush Limbaugh as their profile picture. Because it makes sense Rush Limbaugh loves Obama. it also makes sense that the new tax bill gives corporations permanent tax ductions than the individual tax https://t.co/ohdMsZzyca
@smcosta1969 You don't even know my IQ or my degree of education.
@smcosta1969 He's not coming back just like how Reagan's not coming back but he came back in terms of Donald Trump. What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm going to pull a Donald Trump move but copy Barack Obama.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters It's all happening consecutive for your information
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro I rather deal with them than you.
@smcosta1969 And thank you for sharing me. whether you agree with me or not you're giving me your attention. And if you haven't noticed but that's what Donald Trump did to win his presidency and that's what I am going to do as well
@smcosta1969 I am the anti-trump. You know who that is "Obama." And who is going to do a Donald Trump move. With his ego and wanting to make America great again. Wanting it to be like Reagan again. Meanwhile I'm wanting it to be like Obama again. Just know history repeats itself
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters I could honestly care less about the criticism that you have against me. Because one you have no evidence and two you're just another person from Twitter. I do this with five other people on a daily basis.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Yawn all you like. You are considered an "adult" but haven't figured out that history repeats itself 😏 #burn cause you know it's true.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro Nobody needs a lesson from a hypocritical centrist person like you. You are worse than Hillary and trump combined. You are the super Centrist. Super Moderate red Foreman d*******
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro This is my campaign not yours. You're not the one running for office are you. So stop trying to make yourself look good when you can't even get the facts straight
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro I don't need your speculation about how I am going to be running my campaign
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro You suck at being an independent
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro If you were to have taken a basic economic class you would understand everything is for self interest. Politics is self interest. Donald Trump is self interest. Paul Ryan self interest. Mitch McConnell more self interested. You. Are the most centrist person self interested of all
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Red foreman went through the age of McCarthyism.	He'd would not vote for Trump, because the history of McCarthyism which you unusually forgot
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters You obviously lack sense of knowledge of history and of political history
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters If red foreman bought it in 2016 he would've voted for Gary Johnson not Donald Trump
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters I think you briefly forgot about your American history about the age of McCarthyism. A time of when you were accused of communicating with the Russians your bank accounts will be frozen &amp; your life and career would end
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters First of all red foreman would have not voted for a person who told Russia to investigate Hillary Clinton's emails. I don't think you get that 70 show. I don't think you get history. In the late 50s and 60s people were accusing other people of communicating with Russians.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters What's the matter you can't take the insults. Is the person with Rush Limbaugh's face as their profile picture feelings being hurt. Are you political feelings hurt. You republican/independent snowflake
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters This is why I'm doing it on Twitter. Right now there's no one judging me. And if anyone's going to judge me like how they judge Donald Trump well I think will be at the same level of exchanging insults.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro @ReLOmarNavarro idk you. But your friend @smcosta1969 is such a hypocrite. Voted Obama, but praises Limbaugh. That's more like...this person doesn't know what he really is 😏
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters You're blind by your own ego ... Tell him how much of a dumbass he is RED FOREMAN https://t.co/8p0hkotkF8
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Your close minded on the fact that you votws for Obama but you have Rush as your profile pic. Do I have to remember that Rush Limbaugh was criticizing of Obama as not being  born in the United States what more hypocrisy examples do u want
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters And you're probably the biggest hypocrite on Twitter for having voted for Obama and having Rush Limbaugh as your fucking profile picture
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters You can't even keep your facts straight
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro And if you think impeachment is not going to happen. Well I can tell you this Richard Milhouse Nixon was impeached for an offense that was way more less than criminalizing of Trumps scadal
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro Well don't you think that Democrats are going to do partyline vote to do impeachment if they win both houses. Just like how the Republicans voted party line for the GOP SCAM tax bill
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @RealOmarNavarro Since you called me a party line person vote. I hope you know that Republicans are going to have a tough time with the 2018 midterms elections. And if the Democrats win the House of Representatives and the Senate

@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Debating is the same thing as arguing. And if you haven't  caught the FYI from that then you've been missing a lot from those presidential and congressional debates. Only a man knows that debating is arguing
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters First of all you got to get your facts straight. I'm not a Hillary or bust Person.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Twitter is the place of freedom of speech. So we can debate all you want. I'm willing to debate all I want. Because like I said debating with Republicans or an independent like you is just practice for my debate prep
He tries to attack me 😏 doesn't even put a dent on my ego 😏 https://t.co/7LFsC01dUe
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Who votes for Obama and then has Rush Limbaugh's face as the  Twitter. Profile picture. Limbaugh claimed that Obama wasn't even born in the US. The fact that you have them as your profile picture explains so much about you
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters If you want to debate me do not change the topic from tax bill to criticizing me because my parents are being the same as a child
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters I serve my country the day of the 2016 election and at the end of it the outcome of it became the most disastrous part in American history. And the fact you could take me on my points. Well your points, weren't as specific and we're all over the place
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters And do not tell me that you bought it for Ross Perot in 1992. You literally gave Bill Clinton the election by voting for Ross Perot and not voting for George Bush. 🇺🇸😏 you voted for a man who did not have a chance at the presidency. Because he flaked on debating
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters I'm a salesman for a living.  And I want to be a politician in the near future.  Obviously the these rebuttals are just preparing me for the future for when I'm in the real debate stage
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters It's not fair that the freaking corporate taxes are permanent but the individual taxes are not
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters People who get 80 to 85 percent of their income taking away it's because they make a shit ton of money and they need to pay their fair share of taxes
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters Yet you have Rush Limbaugh as your profile picture you dumbass, and you probably see you voted for Obama when Rush Limbaugh criticizes Obama saying that he's not even born from this country. You my friend are in embarrassment to be called an American citizen.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters I guess it doesn't matter when you don't have any major legislation passed in 2017. If you think the tax bill is going to help you , just ask your company how payroll is going for them 😏
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters You and the Republicans are just blind from this tax bill. Ignoring the fact that it's going to add more to the deficit. What ever happened to you republican deficit hawks
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters You Republicans are so delusional. You think this is going to double the economy. I'm going to hold you and the Republican establishment accountable for the economy in the next in coming years. All of the Deregulation I blame it on you.
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters OK first of all I know that my paycheck is going to be bigger. What Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are saying, is that the super rich people are going to get more of a benefit then common people from this tax bill
@smcosta1969 @RepMaxineWaters @smcosta1969 you are that political turd just like @Steven_K_Bannon

2. The Democrats need to unite to defeat the Republicans in the 2018 midterm election @TheDemCoalition @DNC @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @ChrisMurphyCT @elizabethforma  @TulsiPress @GOP @HouseGOP @dscc @TheDemocrats @DemGovs @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
As Trump and the Republicans are being divided by the right wing leader Steve Bannon. I see a chance of opportunity for the Democrats to unite defeat the GOP in the 2018 midterm election. If the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate they will proceed to impeachment.1
