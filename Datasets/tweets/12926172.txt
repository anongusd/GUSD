@tagesspiegel (Meanwhile, if the SPD votes *for* a grand coalition, none of this matters and Germany finally gets a new government)
@tagesspiegel Merkel has said repeatedly that she does not want to lead a minority government, given how unstable it is. Should she say no, or should the Bundestag not give her a majority, then the decision to call new elections would once again go back to Steinmeier.
@tagesspiegel At that point, Steinmeier as president could suggest a chancellor (Merkel) to the German Bundestag and call for a vote -- should she receive a majority of votes in the Bundestag (355 of 709), she could still be voted chancellor of a minority government
@tagesspiegel For non-German speakers: first, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier would likely sit down with the heads of all parties to discuss whether there are any other possible options for a majority government (not really, unless something massively changes)

4. Germany (Sept/Oct 2017), where the anti-immigrant Alternative fur Deutchland (AfD) is expected to win its first seats in the Bundestag.
3. France (April 23/May 7, 2017): Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Front, who leads the country's current president in polling
2. The Netherlands (March 15, 2017): Geert Wilders, head of the anti-Muslim Freedom Party, could win the country's parliamentary elections.
1. Austria (Dec. 4, 2016), where the Austrian Freedom Party could very well win the presidency
While we're at it, another quick list for y'all: of the next places we're likely to see a surge of right-wing populism win elections:
Marine Le Pen, head of France's far-right party, congratulates Trump https://t.co/1sy4a876vj

9. That's all I've got for the moment. I'm sure there are more that we'll think of in the coming days.
8. That the party with the biggest post-Election Day internal reckoning on the horizon was the GOP, not the Democrats.
7. That the Democrats' Electoral College firewall was going to hold for cycles, even decades, to come.
6. That more money and more ads on TV means you're going to win.
5. That massive party divisions -- and the lack of support of the party establishment -- can keep a candidate from winning.
4. That a candidate's extensive ground game will pull them over the finish line in a close race.
3. That increasingly data-driven campaigns with significant investments in analytics are the best way to win.
2. That the candidate leading in virtually all national polling is going to win the election.
1. Let's just start a running list of basic assumptions about politics that we were wrong about. There are a lot.

Regardless of their vote preference, 9/10 of #walmartmoms in Columbus think @HillaryClinton will win in November.
All 10 #walmartmoms say they're planning to watch first debate on 9/26; many say it's "very important" to their decision in the race
One #walmartmoms participant on Clinton email scandal: "If anybody else did that, they would have lost their job"
Things #walmartmoms have heard in the news recently: Muslim ban, immigration, Clinton ahead in polls, Khan family
Of 10 #walmartmoms in Columbus tonight, 3 say they would vote for Trump, 2 for Clinton, 5 for "other"
What sport would HRC be good at? One woman at #walmartmoms says golf -- "because I find her boring"
What Olympic sport would Trump be good at? #walmartmoms say swimming (he's tan), fencing (won't mess up his hair), diving (not a team sport)
Still, one woman said of Trump: "He's that one guy you‚Äôd have to explain to your friends before he got there" #walmartmoms
