A majority of Virginians say abortion in the third trimester should be legal if the woman's health is at risk https://t.co/gGaaAZYYDO https://t.co/igc4aasc1M
Virginians most likely to say abortion is at least a very important issue include white evangelical Christians (79%) Republicans (78%) and women (64%). By comparison, 44% of Democrats and 51% of men say the issue is similarly important to them. https://t.co/cbMvaXtkwh

Dad forbid me to take glitter art projects into his car, much less into our home. When I was in college in '04 he bought a used car that I bought from him in '15. There's a lil spec of glitter on the drivers' seat that is from the previous owner, which totally delights me.
This article alone was worth my $15 monthly NYT digital subscription. "Researchers and zookeepers sometimes mix glitter with animal feed to track animals (polar bears; elephants; domestic cats) via sparkly feces."
Heaven is in NJ "There were neon sparkles so pink you have only seen them in dreams, and rainbow hues that were simultaneously lilac and mint and all the colors of a fire. On one shelf, hundreds of jars of iridescent white fairly glowed. The prettiest shade was slightly violet."
We have New Jersey to thank for glitter "Most of the glitter that adorns America‚Äôs name brand products is made in one of two places: The first is in New Jersey, but the second, however, is also in New Jersey."
The tiny, shiny, decorative particles of glitter we are familiar with today are popularly believed to have originated on a farm in New Jersey in the 1930s, when a German immigrant invented a machine to cut scrap material into extremely small pieces. https://t.co/DQonK9il6G

People who say NPR or newspapers are one of their top two news sources are among the least likely to believe false claims by Trump, averaging 16 percent and 17 percent, respectively.
Americans who count MSNBC and CNN as one of their top two news sources are somewhat more likely to reject Trump‚Äôs falsehoods but are also more likely to believe false statements made by Democrats. On avg, 44% of MSNBC viewers and 40%of CNN viewers believe false Democratic claims.
Among adults who say Fox News is one of their top two sources for political news, 33 percent believe in Trump‚Äôs false claims tested in the poll, on average, compared with 21 percent of those who say Fox is not a main news source.

@altperson10 @LaurenMoffat15 @chelseahandler And also if you look at the exit polling of all House races from yesterday -- white women split 49/49 Dem/Rep. In 2014 , they voted for Reps by a 14 point margin, in 2010 by a 19 point margin. (In 2006, they split the vote.) But they are not historically Democratic voters.

White women tend to vote for Republicans. This year they split their vote 49-49. In 2014, white women voted for Republicans by 14 points, in 2010 by 19 points (though, they pretty much split their vote evenly in 2006). In 2002, they favored Republicans by 15 points.
56% of independent women voted for Democratic candidates, 39% for Republicans.		In 2014, 50% voted for Republicans, 46% for Democrats
The last time women voted for Democrats anywhere near a margin that high was in 1982 when the margin was 17 percentage points
