@AM_Hoffman Not expensive to you. But the min. wage worker who can't afford a 2 BR apt ANYWHERE in the US, let alone a kid?
@AM_Hoffman Saying you're naive is a personal attack? LMAO. Sorry, it's an observation.
@AM_Hoffman I don't KNOW indiv. med. circumstance that make a late term pregnancy unviable. Not my business, not yours, either.
@AM_Hoffman Not even close.
@AM_Hoffman Yes, because everyone can afford birth control. You are woefully naive.
@AM_Hoffman I don't presume to know what the circumstances of a women's pregnancy holds. And we're talking about the US here.
@AM_Hoffman What's outrageous is for you to presume you know every circumstance that results in such a difficult decision.
@AM_Hoffman Late term usually = severe unsurvivable birth defects. You want to force women to carry an unviable fetus to term?
@AM_Hoffman You actually believe in science? Then you should be all for universal access to birth control.
@AM_Hoffman You believe women just have abortions for the fun of it, don't you?
@AM_Hoffman Access to free or low cost birth control helps lower abortion rates. It's our humanitarian duty to provide it.

@CaliAzona @CapitaLiszt No one is taking aways guns for home protection. You have plenty of choices.
@CaliAzona @CapitaLiszt Yes, studies show it's often a split second choice, no going back w/a gun. Guns make violence more deadly.
@CaliAzona @CapitaLiszt I work to change root causes. Access 2healthcare, hand up, not hand out, education, closing loopholes. U?
