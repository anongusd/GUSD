@AbbyMartin @EmpireFiles How close is that camp to Iranian footholds, and where are you getting your civilian numbers?
@RyanDivish Did the Mariners really turn down Sito from Philadelphia (per Rosenthal)? Could have ended up with Sito and Sheffield?
@ByBobDutton @RyanDivish @GregJohnsMLB Miss you on Seattle beat
@SenSanders No. Poor and rich both get health care on any plan. Obama care screwed middle class. Add this to high min wage and child care and I have a continual decision to go to my 6 figure job, or stay home and use assistance to provide for fam of 4. Broken
@AOC @mtracey Iran today openly discusses their desire to wipe out Israel. Looking at one Congressperson here as an example of inclusion ignores the current grave danger

@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN @AOC And your opinions are based on what @AOC has done, which is?? And I’ll wait
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN @AOC @CNN @FoxNews all exploit the public’s unwillingness to research to peddle agendas. Look at my tweets today. Calling everyone out, but I’m a right wing asshole cause I don’t agree with you?
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN @AOC A persons sex does not make them a good politician just as much as a persons $$ doesn’t. Read.. Study before you shout opinions
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN @AOC My shit that says I want journalists to cover not make the news? Read my tweets today? Like the one where I called @POTUS dangerous
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN You NoWallEver are responding to a tweet about neutral journalism by calling the poster an asshole. Look up irony if reading is still an option for you
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN And there’s you’re intelligent rebuttal. @AOC talked about intellectual deficiencies in the Republican parry. You just backed up a point I made earlier today. #Bully #RiseAbove
@BuckeyeGurl99 @CNN Nope. Fox = CNN. Neither are news anymore. It’s why I follow every Congress person. I do the work. But just like a Dem to make an accusation
@AOC @snopes Is the 430 credit score real?
@DrJillStein Uh Maduro is a psychpath
@realDonaldTrump You realize you’re establishing a policy where the best way to US negotiations is to threaten nuclear war
@RealCandaceO @businessinsider Where you lost me is If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great.. No. Don’t condone racism as long as it stays in one’s borders. Racism ALWAYS wrong
@POTUS is like that girl in high school who lacks self-confidence to the point where she surrounds herself with sillier world leaders so she doesn’t look so bad. @RT_Erdogan Putin, Lil Kim.. #UsingYou
@realDonaldTrump In Little Kim @POTUS has finally found a friend with a worse toupee
@realDonaldTrump Umm. He’s a crazy dictator. Thou shalt not negotiate with terrorists. Channel Reagan
@CNN Does CNN actually cover news anymore, or is it just a DOC mouthpiece?
@DSilvermint That’s a whole routine. Gotta pivot after a couple of punchlines. What even are emergency tomatoes? But I won’t be able to make a salad! It’ll be just greens!
@AOC @ZephyrTeachout Law is a business. Has 0 to do with inequalities and everything to do with a poorly designed system
@AOC @ZephyrTeachout It’s guilty till innocent for everyone due to the DA being a political position. Ask anyone ever charged falsely.
@peteholmes @HBO Going through a divorce. Wife cheated/moved on. Crashing is my life. You’re unfunny ass making it gives me hope 😀
@AOC Debate issues in good faith? I haven’t seen either side exercise good faith in over 10 years. Intellectually bankrupt shows this. #RiseAbove
@AOC @RepRaskin Hey was making wild acquisitions the attacked Whittaker’s character, and asked innocuous known questions without giving Whittaker a chance to respond to accusations. #Bully
@RyanDivish TMobile. Put a dollar in the jar
@ndrew_lawrence @AOC No, Tucker read a quote about the group wanting to eliminate air travel and the cool hair guy backed off it. #FactsPlease

@joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump No @joshscampbell @realDonaldTrump is saying that the hearings were less fact-finding and more circus. The fact that @CNN continues to add to the narrative validates fake news concerns.

@KamChancellor How’s that helping? Your voice is heard in a locker room of what’s going to be a young team. Be part of the answer, not the problem!
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday I do not subscribe to labels? One of our duties is to properly diagnose. A differentiator between BPD and something like AntiSocial is remorse. The BPD patient doesn’t hate the world. He/She isn’t overly angry. More scared and dramatic
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Always an option that the abused can leave. You and I both know some can’t. Our job is to recognize and help those trapped there, but to help couples that are working through issues
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Not at all. No one condones the symptomology. I am saying that it’s not bad practice to acknowledge scars, and teach couples how to work through them as a unit
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday I Hate You Don’t Leave me is a book on BPD
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Oh. See lack of remorse isn’t trauma or BPD. It’s antisocial behavior. That’s 100% my point Antisocial = Abusive as does narcissism. There is a group of individuals legitimately dealing with trust issue and loss that are being mislabeled as abusers. Clinicians suggest leaving
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Impossible. You can’t recreate that fragility that angst that type of trust issue in therapy or in a lab. You can DBT to death, but there will always be issues. DBT teaches you to navigate through those WHEN they occur, nor if
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Read I hate you, Don’t leave me. Next answer how someone hurt in a serious relationship can hope to adequately address those issues outside of the next serious relationship
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday I hope people see this. Great example of what I’m talking about. Quick to judge. Quick to label. So no one with BPD should be married? Kill those families?
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Humans = Plants = We are one with nature? CARR? That you? Never mind. Adds context to the perspective
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Not our job to determine whether a couple should be married or in a relationship. Take your opinion out of the solution.
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday No patient that has suffered a traumatic loss can learn how to navigate in his/her current relationship with that thought process. Just break up families. That’s a shame
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Shame on you. A psychologist answers to the desire of his/her clients. It’s not your job to determine what he/she should do. It’s your job to help them process their feelings/intentions/desires. You are letting your opinion dictate therapeutic outcomes
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday This reaction helps increase the divorce rate. Seems counterproductive to what should be the goal for MFTs
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday That requires behavioral conditioning and often times a relationship with a partner that understands fragility and is patient. Psychology is doing a disservice to label this type of symptomology as abuse
@Damselflycreek @PsychToday Fearing loss does not equate to abuse. There is no desire or intent to control. In fact, the opposite condition is occurring. There is no way out of learning how not to fear loss then to learn how to trust again

@GeoffBakerTIMES Finds it invalid. To date hasn't happened. So agreement still valid. Mediation process process described in Sec 8. Hansen wants time?
@GeoffBakerTIMES Okay see I just read the MOU. Be nice if the journalist kept us informed, but whatever.Sec 16 states only way to sever contract is if court
@GeoffBakerTIMES Or ask the Times sports business columnist to do that please, cause I'm curious? He'll frame it to the council as a question from a reader
@GeoffBakerTIMES We're all SO dumb Geoff? Teach us. Or ask the city that question. Or read the terms of the MOU and tell us how exclusivity not violated
@GeoffBakerTIMES Not a lawyer, but a journalist right? Investigate. I'm a reader. Tell me how negotiating with a 2nd party doesn't violate exclusivity
@GeoffBakerTIMES What about asking city council about the issue? What about verifying terms of MOU have been violated. If I were a journalist I'd smell story
@GeoffBakerTIMES Also by Burgess quote evidence that RFP wasn't negotiated in good faith, which violates civic ordinance. Hanson hired PR. Guess his play
@GeoffBakerTIMES There's a signed agreement and Burgess is on record. Clear evidence that exclusivity has been violated.
@GeoffBakerTIMES Trust your citizens. Put it to a vote. No turn out, and it's on us. Remember though. Thousands tired of crooked council and slanted coverage
@GeoffBakerTIMES Hanson has exclusivity with SEA till 12/03. How does MOU with OVG not bring a lawsuit
@GeoffBakerTIMES How does $40M over 39 years fix traffic now?
@GeoffBakerTIMES I think most feel if this were up for a vote public would pick other proposal. Council not listening to constituents. Where is that story
@GeoffBakerTIMES Not worth it to Hanson to show all cards if city isn't open to plan. Bet he'd provide investors/spec if it changed the game
@GeoffBakerTIMES You reported city said SODO to late, due to where they are with OVG. Are you now saying city open to negotiating if Hanson play all cards

@OfficialJLD He called out Whit Supremacy. Even CNN reported it. Watch how media is covering this tragedy and see if you don't throw up in you mouth

@RepSpeier @POTUS No he called out White Supremacy. Are you intentionally misleading the public or just lazy

@MNTwinsfan44 But you keep paying Ervin 😏
@MNTwinsfan44 Okay. Glad we're making the deal. Goslav is your #3 rated prospect. Romero is 11-6 in AA in your games that don't matter. And there's Jose
@jameswhite1235 @TNT_Mariners Who knows? Boog just got Alonso. A 35 year old Santana is owed $30M for 2 years. Twins need C. Think Martlette and Altavala. That type
@MNTwinsfan44 @TNT_Mariners Spent this past year in MN and 30 in SEA. Oddly know both organizations you guys better with gonsales, Romero and Jay or.. 35 year old Ervin
@TNT_Mariners I do. 36 at the end of that deal each year at that salary is worse for them. Club control = bad over 40
@vulsara @AntiTrumpReport @MARKCUBAN45 Lol. Good analysis. See Cuban. Bunch a get a rope. No logic

@acsymonds @TNT_Mariners Now tell me about avg mph, ext vel, projection angle and why that formula finds good pitchers. Now where are Ms on there
@acsymonds @TNT_Mariners Haha. No I'm not. Been following baseball for 40 years. Tell me the problems with WAR before you start getting huffy, or explain mul regress
@TNT_Mariners Whatever it takes this year. He's better then what we have. Just don't touch Lewis
@acsymonds @TNT_Mariners E Santana is a legit #3. If Felix is out for awhile we need that. Or else it's Pax and crap
@acsymonds @TNT_Mariners Or we won't win this year. Easy call
@acsymonds @TNT_Mariners He gives up 3.24 runs every nine innings. Gonzalez gives up 5. So does Rameriez and Moore. We need pitchers who give up less then we score
@TNT_Mariners My argument is he IS an August trade candidate and the only one in the top 20 the Ms can get in their $$. He's also better then our crap
@Mariners problem is all of Jerry's SPs give up 4-5 RPG. Not their fault. Its who they are. Puts to much pressure on O. Find a SP with stuff
@keithellison @FDRLST @SenJohnMcCain This is how you win wars. This is how you become strong. Quit crying. Let @POTUS and Gens do their job
@keithellison @FDRLST Note what Dems are complaining about. @SenJohnMcCain complains that @POTUS, spurned by Kelly questioning Gens. Whah
@TNT_Mariners Mariners were 12.5 back on August 20, 1995. Will be 13.5 back if they get game 2. Correa's out. HOU 3-7 in last 10. Faded last year
@LookoutLanding Limited damage? Gave up 5 runs like he does every start
@dannyoneil Valencia can play OF. Heredia is hitting .225 and Hanniger has had 1 good month (see Chris Shelton)
@PacNorthwestBro ? Let's go get Erasmo. Marco Gonzalez 4 top 50 guy. Who are you loling at? Jerry made those deals. Good teams add veteran arms at 0 cost
@TNT_Mariners Twins are. He's making $15M and has been pitching like garbage since June. But Jerry knows him. He's a #3 here. Not a bad salary 4 that
@StoneLarry @stonejordan07 Hehe. Manny at SS. Segura at 2B. Cano at DH. Dream

@MarinersPR There's a Dipito deal. Two 28 year old AAAA guys. Beware of the PTBNL. Was Tyler Pike last time
@cougsgo Alonso 1B Valencia LF Heredia down
@cougsgo Think they both play. Cruz has neck issues. Hanniger is out, and let's be honest didn't adjust after league caught up to him.

@Chihuahua1900 @PJSenser @SenJohnMcCain McCains playing politics. Implying Trump is behind failures in Afghanistan? Makes no sense. Just dogpiling on Trump cause it's popular
@Chihuahua1900 @PJSenser @SenJohnMcCain More Generals in the White House than at any point since the 50s. McCain knows this, and understands Kelly's role
@Chihuahua1900 @PJSenser @SenJohnMcCain Has shown he'll speak up if he disagrees
@Chihuahua1900 @PJSenser @SenJohnMcCain Kelly wants a change he's earned the right to call for it. So has Mathis. Not my job to question. Assume that's who setting policy. Kelly
