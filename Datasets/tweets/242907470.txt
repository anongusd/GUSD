Cohen is a disgraced (and apparently disbarred) lawyer -- but a more effective one in this setting than the GOP members questioning him.
Cohen tells GOP members that they are now doing what he did for 10 years -- protecting Trump -- and that they will come to regret it.
In normal times, attacking witness as tax cheat, convicted liar, bully, narcissist, etc. would destroy his credibility. With Cohen, it bolsters sense of how well he fit in with Trump Org. Weren't those qualities key to his 10-yr tenure with president?
Trump "once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a shithole. This was when Barack Obama was president." -- Cohen

Trump is repeatedly responding to the idea of congressional oversight with threats of retaliation — counterinvestigations against a party not in the White House not responsible for running the federal government.
He does bring the bully to the bully pulpit.

The 10-year-old girl meant does the president know that her skin is brown. The racial unease in the United States had become so pervasive that even the granddaughter of the president’s own lawyer felt vulnerable. (5 of 5).
But then Dowd’s granddaughter asked whether Trump “knows about us.” Dowd said that Trump knows that his lawyer has a big family and loves children. But Dowd had failed to catch the meaning in his granddaughter’s question and she repeated it: “Does he know about us.” (4 of 5)
The children began asking him what it was like to be lawyer to the president. Dowd, a big Trump fan, sang the president’s praises while splashing in the pool with his grandchildren. (3 of 5)
Dowd is a devoted father of adopted children of mixed race who now have children of their own. Dowd came home after lunch with Trump last year and found two of his grandchildren swimming in the pool. (2 of 5)
