I thought #LatinAmÃ©rica was better than #Africa interms of resisisting #US/#EU manipulations and exploitation until i found this map. It is time for #LatinAmerica and #Africa to form a block and speak as one. #Russia or #China are not very different from them. #Maduro take note. https://t.co/exBtzwvJCb
#USA give #Maduro a break. Venezuelans will talk and solve their problems as the brothers and sisters they are. Don't push #Maduro to start killing Venezuelans like the French stooge and dictator in Cameroon #PaulBiya, killing #Ambazonians for fun in your eyes and that of the #UN https://t.co/oQBek205rv
@jorge478 @jlcastanedaj @US Oh No. Cameroon has enough crude oil my brother. Just do your findings. Ask why France keeps support dictator #paulBiya to kill #Ambazonians (who own this oil) for standing up against France, just like #Maduro is against #USA from stealing Venezuelan oil.
Everyone in the @US is after or against Maduro. Yes he is not the square peg. But why focus only on him when others like #PaulBiya of Cameroon is doing even worst things than Maduro? Oh God! give #Africa back the leadership of the world. https://t.co/JG5bvFpTTW
@antonioguterres @UN @AminaJMohammed Go to Cameroon

@lsrael trained and arm his army #BIR. He uses the army to holocaust his people. @Isreal pretends that she is against hate speech and holocaust. Your trained and sponsored #BIRs killed her. Her child weeps for her at her age. @Israel will never see #peace
@USA is cutting military aid to dictator @paulBiya. Sorry @USA. You are just opening the race 4 your enermies and competitors @Russia, @China and @Iran. Double standed @Israel will keep training and equipping the @BIR and @GP. @USA you know what to do to stop Biya. Intervene now
@Israel, one of the most @racist and @homophobic countries on earth MUST apologise to @BritishSCameroonians for coniving with aging dictator @paulbiya alias @Hitler to sponsor terrorism in the land of their birth. Every @BSCamerianian killed by your @BIRS must be accounted for.
Hippocracy is when @Israel condemns the hate speech of minister @Momo on @Jews but train and arm the @BIR to protect aging dictator @PaulBiya and his ministers @AtangaNji, @FameNdongo, @OkaliaBilai, @IsaTchiroma etc to perpetrate and execute  hate and kill minority @SCameroons.
@Israel is responsable for all the killings in @Cameroon. You train and arm the @BIR which dictator @PaulBiya is using to kill @SCameroonians like @Hitler killed @Jews. You made @Cameroon to apologise for minister @Momo hate speech on @Jews. You 2 MUST apologise to @SCameroonians https://t.co/ZqOj80i9ta
@paulBiya. I really want to understand humanity Oh GOD! help me please. Life means nothing to some people. They use the @military to kill everyone who dare ask for their right. The worst is that the @UN which we all look to is helpless and hopeless. Dear God your people need you.
@RonaleeCarey Interesting. It needs wider publicity. Am sure the next office break will give us an App.
@Lenin President @Lenin great move. @Ecuador MUST collaborate with @China, @Japan etc to revolutionarise her technological sector. Stop depending on the @US. USA will only exploit Ecuador for her benefit. Not normal that Ecuadorians buy cars, cellphones etc to expensive in the 21stC.
@RonaleeCarey Congrats @RonaleeCarey. It feels so good to know about a determined/committed humanitarian like you. Your efforts of putting smiles on the faces of refugees worldwide is a virtue i really wish to appreciate. Following you for while now, I really have hope as one.  FÃ©licitations !
USA @Mimimefo is in prison because she reported the truth aboout the killers ( Biya's soldiers ) of yours beloved Wesco. I will see if you will side with @PaulBiya or with @Mimi and the truth. For how long will @PaulBiya commit all these attrocities for @God sake. A wicked world.
@UN @UN_GP_RtoP So the @UN knows and fear genocide when it doesn't concern Africans. There is active genocide is @BritishSouthernCameroons where  @PR_Paul_BIYA is killing Anglophones and even missionaries @TraumanWesco but you say nothing. African lifes don't even matter. But GOD will safe us.
Dictador @PaulBiya has become some powerful that he can bite the finger that feeds him. @USA gave him guns directly or inditectly via @Israel. He used the guns to comit genocide in Southern Cameroons. @USA stayed quiet. Now @PR_Paul_BIYA is so drunk. Even Americana are not safe. https://t.co/kvLGnTFlDE
What can @PR_Paul_BIYA do without the army? Only God knows what he did to these guys in uniform. Anglophones are used to it. Francophones may start feeling it just if they remain courageous. https://t.co/xMAzk7md2v
They prefer @dogs and @cats to human beings. That is why they enforce and and ensure that pets are not killed. But they cannot ensure and enforce laws that ptotect humans in the @UN. Paul Biya therefore has all the powers to kill as he likes. Just see for yourselves. https://t.co/dqpz2YkKqj
@JoshuaOsih Coward. Why did you participate in the election when you knew the institutions are not democratic and will never be with Biya? Since 20years you started fighting to democratise the system with no sucess you think you will suceed barely months to the local elections? Sorry for you
@PaulBiya. The most powerful and notorious president in the globe. Even almighty @USA, @UK, @Germany etc fear this devil. No doubt they decided to romance with him than take very strong stands with his @currupt, @fruadulent, @tribalistic and @blood sucking gov't.
I have no one pity for @francophones. Everything @PaulBiya is doing to them today they deserve it. I remember how they encouraged him to kill @anglophones because of their boldness and determination for change. Today they are crying about @Biya. Scew them well dictator @Biya.
RT @LesBrow01135002: I had no doubt that the @Doula march was just a propaganda. If anglophones defied the militarily and marched on @Septeâ€¦
I had no doubt that the @Doula march was just a propaganda. If anglophones defied the militarily and marched on @September22nd and @October1st 2017 why not francophones? Remain with your @PaulBiya and stop complaining. Anglophones are gone.
@francophones "let those calling for protest lead the line with their @wives and @children we will be behind". See! They are fighting for you complaining about @Biya regime. These people are not poor nor suffering like u. So the choice is for you to make. Stay @home if you like.
RT @ayah4justice: Babessi - Ndop		See what is happening in the English speaking regions of Cameroon. This is babessi; October 11 2018. 		Thâ€¦
@AkereMuna Another Francophone as president? Oh Anglophones. Why not Kampto giving up for you? Wait for an Osih, Cabral, Matomba and Ndifor coalition for an Anglophone president to solve the Anglophone problem you exploited to go to the position you occupy now.
Terrible. https://t.co/k0JSDHFv0q
@JoshuaOsih When will you visit latin America?
@ClaudeBush6 Even @Bush senior too sir..
@JoshuaOsih People are grieved about army brutality and the lies of Tchiroma, Owona Nguinea, Heve Nkom, Obama and V4 TV  about these killings. Yet you and your party careless. No official denounciation. How different then are you from Biya and them?
RT @nganang: Anglophones being rounded up in Mbengwi today. Indiscriminately as we can see. Many will end up being executed. Please share.â€¦
This is good from a reputable Statesman. But i think the rhetoric should change from pleas to to action. King Biya likes it when world leaders talk like this because there are just empty speeches that will have no impact at the end of the day. https://t.co/zATceRG8EL
Who can really predict the end of the Southern Cameroon crisis? For the election in October i can predict because Francophones are uncomfortable but happy with the Biya mafia.
@Paul Biya the Adolf Hitla of Africa supported strongly by the poorest country in @Europe #ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·# and Isreal. Even the almighty UN can't stop him because of his bribery tactics. If only he had nuclear weapons!!!! https://t.co/8VdTIIH8t4
RT @CNNPolitics: The US military continues to support Cameroon's military despite the US ambassador to that country accusing Cameroonian trâ€¦
@CNNPolitics @CNN you have just launch a war against French Cameroonians. Just like their corrupt and tyrannic government, they hate the truth. The US ambassador was rubbished by Francophones is a local TV Afrique Media just for a speaking against the genocide coordinated by Biya.
