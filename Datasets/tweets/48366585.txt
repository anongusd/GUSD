F/O Stephen Browning of ALPA's Air Traffic Services group specializing in commercial space integration, is presenting ALPA's white paper on commercial space integration. https://t.co/XIGyL7QB6B https://t.co/2HwJPLKjSo
As the president of ALPA, I’m confident that the aerospace industry can work together to achieve the high level of safety that Americans expect and demand from U.S. air transportation. -@ALPAPresident
It’s an exciting time to be part of the aerospace industry. As a #pilot who loves to fly, I’m eager to see where the future takes us.  -@ALPAPresident
There’s no doubt that many of our young people who are thinking about their future careers are thinking about space travel. Let me tell you that no one is more committed than ALPA to the future of the #piloting profession—be it in aircraft or spacecraft! -@ALPAPresident
I feel especially pleased to participate in this conference hosted by two prestigious educational institutions—@ERAUWorldwide and @UTAustin. -@ALPAPresident
As John Glenn is reported to have said, “The most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science, math, and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel.” -@ALPAPresident
New opportunity is coming fast—whether it’s NASA’s plans this year to launch American astronauts again from U.S. soil, @VirginGalactic’s space tourism operations, or the continued development of @BlueOrigin’s rocket—the New Glenn. -@ALPAPresident
I mentioned that we have the advantage of time as our industries work together on safe integration, and we do—but there is urgency to our effort today.  -@ALPAPresident
Commercial airline and space operators need to better understand each other’s operations. -@ALPAPresident
We’ve testified before Congress about our support for safely integrating commercial space operations into the national airspace and underscored that safety must remain the highest priority for the FAA as we go forward. -@ALPAPresident
ALPA is fully committed to fostering the constructive dialogue and creating the solutions that will meet both industries’ goals. -@ALPAPresident
As the U.S. airline industry works to meet future passenger and shipper demand...and while spaceflight operations also increase, the aerospace industry must jointly create policies, regulations, and procedures to share resources efficiently and safely. -@ALPAPresident
Commercial space flight is not new, but it’s changing and changing fast—we have new types of operations, increased frequency, and more spaceports in operation with more being proposed. -@ALPAPresident
Our work through CAST is just one example of ALPA’s nearly 88 years of collaboration. And the safety programs and technologies that ALPA has helped develop and implement for commercial aviation have already gone into space––literally. -@ALPAPresident
We believe a risk-predictive approach will be essential for our industries as we work to integrate spaceflight operations into the national airspace. -@ALPAPresident
These programs bring “all” stakeholders to the table, along with the FAA, to identify solutions that are consensus-based. -@ALPAPresident
At ALPA, we make a conscious choice to focus on our commonalities, not our differences. -@ALPAPresident
Unity and collaboration is what we do as an organization. In fact, it’s our greatest strength. But it takes will. -@ALPAPresident
ALPA has decades of experience with collaboration—and the powerful results it can generate. -@ALPAPresident
We think it’s important to share the best practices we’ve learned in commercial aviation, many of which were learned as a result of accidents and loss of life.... We don’t have to do that with commercial space integration—we have time to collaborate. -@ALPAPresident
Based on these principles, ALPA has taken the lead in bringing commercial space and commercial aviation community representatives together. -@ALPAPresident
Stakeholder collaboration, planning, and analysis that informs new policies, procedures, and regulations must begin now. -@ALPAPresident
We cannot afford to add “unquantified” risk to the safety of the national airspace system. -@ALPAPresident
Spacecraft and their operations must meet the same level safety as other airspace users. The FAA must be given the adequate resources to achieve this goal. And we can’t stop the FAA’s ability to perform this work, as we did with the recent government shutdown. -@ALPAPresident
In the long-term, ALPA supports integration, rather than segregation, of space operations into the mainstream national airspace system. -@ALPAPresident
The U.S. national airspace system is a national resource to be managed to benefit all Americans. -@ALPAPresident
The future growth and success of both commercial aviation and space operations depend on safe and efficient access to the same shared public resource—the national airspace system. -@ALPAPresident
If you want success, we don't compete on safety--we collaborate on it. -@ALPAPresident
With #commercialspace, we have the chance to do this right. -@ALPAPresident
That’s the good news that frames the importance of our being here today. We have time and and opportunity to ensure we safely integrate commercial space operations with commercial aviation—something I firmly believe we can do. -@ALPAPresident
So, whether it’s flying KC-130s, as I did in the Marines, or in my 33 years flying an Airbus at FedEx, more time...means more opportunity to gather, analyze, and respond to data.  -@ALPAPresident
Safe flying means a strong aviation industry, and a strong aviation industry contributes to a solid economy. -@ALPAPresident
It’s embodied in the very fabric of that remarkable safety record I just mentioned––a safety record that has helped make commercial aviation a significant economic driver in the United States. -@ALPAPresident
This same risk-predictive, data-driven approach holds true for airline #pilots on every individual flight...as well as for the air transportation system across this great country.  -@ALPAPresident
Our position at ALPA is that the most important safety feature on any aircraft is a well-trained, experienced, well-rested flight crew. #TrainedForLife -@ALPAPresident
The United States identified a risk and addressed it with the lifesaving #pilot qualification, experience, and training requirements that were implemented in 2010 and maintained in the #FAAReauthorization of 2018. -@ALPAPresident
That law also led to improved flight and duty limits for #pilots at passenger airlines here in the United States. -@ALPAPresident
The set of FAA regulations that resulted from the law’s passage improved the training #pilots receive in important areas including updating #pilot certificate and type-rating requirements. -@ALPAPresident
We’re talking synergy here on a massive scale folks or...as we Marines like to call it, a #ForceMultiplier  -@ALPAPresident.
We essentially completed the circle. Putting the finishing touches on a system consisting of multiple moving parts elegantly coming together to create a risk-predictive model where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. -@ALPAPresident
The FAA reviewed the four accidents along with others. They found that shortcomings in airline #pilot experience, qualification, and training had been factors in all of them. -@ALPAPresident
The nation’s lawmakers responded to the tragedies by passing the Airline Safety and FAA Extension Act of 2010. -@ALPAPresident
When four fatal airline accidents occurred in the United States over a six-year period culminating with Colgan 3407 in 2009, Congress acted to make flying safer. -@ALPAPresident
RT @spacechelle: First keynote of today’s conference is from Captain Joe DePete, President of @WeAreALPA. Great to see such a cross section…
So, how has the United States accomplished this phenomenal level of aviation safety? By collecting and analyzing data. Using a data-driven approach to identify risk and address it. -@ALPAPresident
We want, both in commercial aviation—and commercial space—to continue to change the way we see the world and our universe. I feel certain that everyone in this room is committed to that as well. -@ALPAPresident
Airline #pilots are rooting for your success for many reasons, including because what you learn will transfer to commercial aviation. -@ALPAPresident
I’m here to tell you that the national airspace these vehicles travel through is extremely safe. It’s safe because we made it that way. Rules written in blood. -@ALPAPresident
The commercial spacecraft that many of you design--and spaceflights that you conduct--transit the U.S. national airspace as a first step in climbing to orbit. -@ALPAPresident
Due to what we have already learned…we have the incredible opportunity....to do it right the first time! -@ALPAPresident
The challenges are certainly great, but the opportunities are far greater. And opportunity is where we want to focus. -@ALPAPresident
You are living in a remarkable time in history, the possibilities of harnessing technology, particularly aerospace technology, for the benefit of all humankind is becoming more and more a reality.  -@ALPAPresident
When I think about commercial space, I don’t see a new entrant. What I see is the evolution of humankind. The only thing new about commercial space is its ever-expanding capabilities. -@ALPAPresident
I’m truly excited about commercial space. For me, it harkens back to when, as a little boy, I sat in front of the TV, transfixed on the black&amp; white images of our first foray into the beyond. To me, spaceflight represented everything that made America exceptional. -@ALPAPresident https://t.co/ZgKpKpp8jN
Because those early #pilots were often pushed to fly when it wasn’t safe, the idea of “Schedule with Safety” meant sheer survival. As a result, safety became ALPA’s founding principle. -@ALPAPresident
In fact, the motto of our Association is “Schedule with Safety.” We often say that “safety is in our DNA.” -@ALPAPresident
The Air Line Pilots Association was founded on safety…for more than 88 years, safety has been among ALPA’s central priorities. -@ALPAPresident

By pooling our resources, we are able to continue supporting our pilots during negotiations and mergers, and providing the same levels of service in all other aspects of their professional careers. -ALPA VP Capt. Randy Helling #ALPABOD2018
We have also been able to provide support for our ALPA airlines that need it most.
"The finances of your union are on solid ground." - ALPA VP Capt. Randy Helling #ALPABOD2018
We are hearing the finance report from ALPA VP Finance/Treasurer Capt. Randy Helling
You either support the vision – or you support division. It’s that simple. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
Today, ALPA is the largest airline #pilots’ union in the world. But we can only maintain this status by working together. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
The foundation for all our success is teamwork. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
As a union, our members look out for each other. That’s why we created the ALPA Emergency Relief Fund, or #Pilots for Pilots. The fund provides grants to help ALPA families recovering from widespread disasters. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
The committee also offers services to help regional #pilots find work at other ALPA carriers, whether their airlines are downsizing, or they simply want to transition to larger carriers. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
Membership volunteers also work with the Education Committee to attend conferences and events, like @WomenInAviation, @OBAPEXCELLENCE, @NGPA2, and @EAA #AirVenture -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
ALPA’s Leadership Committee helps #pilot reps prepare for their elected offices with Leadership Training Conferences. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018

Our union makes contact with thousands of students in the United States and Canada each year...and we’ve been doing this for more than 30 years. - ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
Another way we preserve and grow the union is the work of ALPA’s Professional Development Group, which was created in 2009. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
Our union represents 61,129 pilots at 34 airlines in the United States and Canada. That’s nearly 8,000 more members than we had in 2008. -ALPA VP Capt. Bill Couette #ALPABOD2018
We're hearing reports from ALPA VP Administration/Secretary Capt. Bill Couette. #ALPABOD2018
We must remain ever vigilant, watching for threats, understanding and managing risks, taking advantage of opportunities, and advocating on behalf of the entire airline industry. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
We must be prepared for the challenges that loom on the horizon. The nature of our work doesn’t allow for complacency. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
In closing, I am humbled by what I see daily from our #pilots and staff. Their experience, expertise, and enthusiasm fuel our advocacy efforts, add strength to our resolve, and give voice to our commitment to a safe and secure air transportation system—now and for the future.
We are #pilot-partisan. We were the most bipartisan labor PAC in the country the last cycle. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018 #BackThePAC
ALPA-PAC continues to stand strong and support elected officials who protect professional #pilots. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018 #BackThePAC
The Aviation #Jumpseat group, led by Capt. Rich Odbert, which is tasked with defending #pilot-in-command authority over flight-deck access, has truly been hard at work since becoming the ASO’s fourth pillar in late 2017. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
For a number of years our Canadian members have had a similar peer support model that has worked well for them, as have our three largest MECs here in the U.S., and now we are very close to providing this service for all ALPA members. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
The first class of volunteers was trained at the Air Safety Forum, and in addition to serving at their own MECs, have volunteered to help their fellow #pilots at other MECs when the toll-free 24/7 PPS hotline is officially launched very soon. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
The newest #pilot Assistance program is the #Pilot Peer Support program...I think that helping our fellow #pilots is the true purpose of this union, and perhaps the best thing we can do. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
Our #pilot volunteers—led by First Officer John Taylor—continue their invaluable work that is truly at the personal core of this union—helping their fellow aviators who may be struggling, privately or professionally. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
The nomination is a valuable testament to the groundbreaking importance of these risk-based programs to flight crews and the flying public and of ALPA’s involvement in both. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
On the security side, our Association’s work under the leadership of Capt. Wolfgang Koch marches forward. The Known Crewmember and @TSA #PreCheck programs were nominated earlier this year for the 2017 #CollierTrophy -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
In April of this year, ALPA was part of a group that received the @AviationWeek Laureate award for our work with both the Commercial Aviation Safety Team and the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing System. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
...to ensure that airline #pilots, the chief users of the airspace, have a voice and are heard as issues arise that affect how we operate, both now and in years to come. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
We are always willing to bring our safety expertise and experience to industry meetings—like we do on the Drone Advisory Committee...
Thanks to you and your efforts giving ALPA a strong voice, the recent #FAAReauthorization requires the establishment of training requirements for all drone operators and permits the agency to fully regulate all #UAS—including those flown by modelers and hobbyists. #ALPABOD2018
As you are aware, the commercial #space industry is expanding rapidly, and the use of #UAS has grown at an unprecedented rate. To be clear, we welcome new technologies and advancements to safely integrate into the skies we all share. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
As we look forward, the sky is no longer the limit when it comes to the Association’s influence, as new entrants are accessing our national airspace. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
We have made progress elsewhere on this initiative as well, in collaboration with @PHMSA_DOT , our Dangerous Goods subject-matter experts have been instrumental in developing the #CheckTheBox education campaign. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018 #Hazmatt
ALPA continues to advocate for the harmonization of U.S. hazardous materials regulations with the international standards set forth by ICAO in 2016, and we were successful in advocating for this to be included in the recent FAA reauthorization. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
Despite how others falsely draw the conclusion that those rules are affecting future #pilot supply - we know the facts. We acknowledge the barriers to entering the profession, but are active in the many discussions on improving access. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
Despite how others falsely draw the conclusion that those rules are affecting future #pilot supply - we know the facts. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete #ALPABOD2018
Bar none—we are the best at what we do, and our members should always remember that...we are the ones who are out there, every day and night, flying the line and ensuring the safety and security of the passengers and cargo entrusted to our care. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
every one of these #pilot volunteers is a shining example of our Association’s credibility and expertise, continuing a tradition that extends over 87 years. -ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete

I am proud to coordinate and direct the efforts of more than 425 safety representatives from Canada and the United States who are the heart and soul of the ASO—the largest nongovernmental aviation safety organization in the world. - ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
Together, we keep our passengers flying, and get our cargo to its destinations—safely and securely. And because we are organized, speaking together, with one voice, we are stronger together than we could ever be alone. - ALPA 1st VP Capt. Joe DePete
This week, let us resolve to protect the future of our profession, maintain the safety of our skies, and advance the interests of our members in all that we do. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
...they'll be back. They'll try to weaken safety and, by doing so, jeopardize our passengers, cargo, and crews. But because of you, I’m confident that we will meet these challenges. ALPA’s defense will hold strong to protect public safety and our #pilots interests. #ALPABOD2018
We know, for example, that on issues like maintaining two #pilots in the cockpit and maintaining first officer qualification requirements, our opponents will not give up
The scale of your accomplishments is staggering. And it’s only because of your commitment to this union. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Since 2015, for example, we’ve reached more than 35,000 elementary, middle, and high school students through school visits and community events. 35,000 students! #ALPABOD2018
We will not relent [on ME3] and will continue to hold our government’s feet to the fire on this issue. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Because #safety is such an essential part of everything we do, we’ve undertaken a major overhaul of our Air Safety Organization website, and we’ve unveiled ALPA’s #pilot Peer Support program as a resource for MECs that don’t already have such programs. #ALPABOD2018
In addition, ALPA is underscoring the value of having two fully qualified and trained #pilots on the flight deck to the Canadian traveling and shipping public and to Members of Parliament. #TrainedForLife #ALPABOD2018 https://t.co/K3De1RpELX
We’re also keeping up the pressure for the Canadian government to issue long-awaited flight- and duty-time regulations. We have new action for our Canadian members to take in this fight. Stop by the Government Affairs table in the registration area today to learn how you can help
Likewise, we’ll continue our drive to require the installation of hardened flight deck doors on cargo airliners and secondary barriers on cargo and existing passenger aircraft. #ALPABOD2018
But make no mistake: We will never let up on our commitment to leveling the playing field and protecting our jobs against foreign airlines seeking to game the system. #ALPABOD2018
Despite passing language in the U.S. House to ensure that flag-of-convenience airlines aren’t allowed to threaten the U.S. airline industry, this America first provision was not included in the final #FAAReauthorization -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
We have much to be proud of, but there is much more work to be done in the halls of Congress. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
...required additional mental health screenings for #pilots, permitted cameras in the cockpit, and weakened foreign ownership and #cabotage laws. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Your granite line of defense also came through in what isn’t in this bill. We prevented proposals from being included that would have changed labor laws,..
Because of your action, we beat back anti-safety measures and took a tremendous step forward in advancing our #pilot-partisan agenda with the newly enacted, five-year FAA reauthorization bill. #ALPABOD2018
Members raised their collective voice in the corridors of Congress and sent our message in more than 100K e-mails, letters, and visits to lawmakers urging them to hold the line on safety. This, along with your social media posts, shattered every ALPA advocacy engagement record.
This year, ALPA #pilots in the United States stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the line of scrimmage when the going got tough against profit-motivated special interests. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
That’s why we’re having great success in our mission to represent all U.S. and Canadian airline #pilots. Since 2015, our organizing and growth have meant we’ve added more than 10k members...This incredible number is a tribute to each of you. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Other airline #pilots see our accomplishments—your accomplishments—and want to become part of ALPA. #ALPABOD2018
This was a tough fight, but the determination of the @WestJetALPA made certain that the @FlySwoop flying would be done by their #pilots. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Not long after @WestJetALPA joined ALPA, the #pilots faced an impending strike or lockout under the Canada Labour Code timeline. #ALPABOD2018
We’re also seeing progress at some non-wholly owned airlines, such as @XJTALPA , where ALPA #pilots just ratified a new contract. But there’s more work to be done at other properties like Air Wisconsin, whose contract is more than a decade old. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
For ALPA’s fee-for-departure #pilot groups, the bargaining environment has improved at some wholly owned companies. These airlines now recognize the value of offering #pilots the pay, benefits, and career growth they merit and seek. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
.@F9ALPA #pilots should know that ALPA will continue to press on every front to gain the contract that they’ve earned. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Look, we get it, @FlyFrontier have a huge cost advantage. They don’t want to let it go. But they’re not going to have it on our backs. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll @F9ALPA #ALPABOD2018
.@FlyFrontier management has refused to recognize the realities of the market. While they delay, the market keeps moving.  -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Backed by a 2 million-dollar MCF grant, the @F9ALPA #pilots have bargained hard for more than two years for a fair deal. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
But despite this progress—and this new pattern—we still have one #pilot group working under a bankruptcy-era contract. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Thanks to their hard work, they’ve narrowed the gap for all of us and given us a stronger pattern in the next round of bargaining. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
The @SpiritMEC_ALPA and @JetBlueALPA contracts this year were huge—and would not have happened without the grit and determination of their #pilots. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
In the mainline segment of our industry, we’ve almost completed this bargaining cycle—except for Frontier. We’re starting the next round with United already at the table. And the Delta #pilots are gearing up to follow. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
We’ve signed major new contracts at 15 of our #pilot groups. We’ve also negotiated dozens of side agreements that advance our members’ goals. I feel extremely proud of your success in collective bargaining—and I know you do, too. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Thanks to your commitment, our contracts are getting stronger with each negotiation. Now, I know this trend doesn’t hold for every individual in this room—and we’re working to move every member in the right direction. #ALPABOD2018
I believe our success warrants closer review, even as we acknowledge that our work is never done. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
With your toughness and determination, we’ve delivered impressive results. Together, we’ve attained a truly remarkable record. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Thanks to your dedication and commitment, our union’s team stands more than 61,000 strong. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
You work to create an insurmountable defense when our contracts, our profession, or the safety of our industry are in jeopardy. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
Together, all of us in this room form the granite line that makes the right play possible to deliver on the strategic plan. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018
At ALPA, our members are the quarterback. Through you they set the strategic plan that determines the game-day calls for this union. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ALPABOD2018

"All of our procedures are centered around defending the cockpit doors...a lot of these cargo aircraft do not have cockpit doors." -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
We urge this subcommittee to maintain its oversight and leadership. ALPA stands ready to continue to work with the airline industry to help ensure that all sectors of commercial #aviation are protected from external and internal threats. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
The Horizon Air incident near #SeaTac reminds us that while rare, insider threats exist in both passenger and cargo flight operations. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Since then, ALPA has been pleased with the @TSA’s efforts to seek the perspective of those of us on the front lines of #aviation security. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
The United States made a quantum leap in #aviation security when the @TSA adopted a risk-based approach to modernize the one-size-fits-all security that was in place on 9/11. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
We’re also pleased that the #FAAReauthorization included Congressman @RepJohnKatko’s legislation that strengthens SIDA security protocols and requires a systemwide risk assessment of airport access control points and airport perimeter security. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
This good progress for passenger flights only makes more profound the security inadequacy of flying a cargo flight without a cockpit door, let alone a secondary barrier and a cockpit door. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Airline #pilots are equally focused on securing passenger airline operations. We’re pleased that the #FAAReauthorization approved by the House and pending in the Senate requires secondary cockpit barriers on new passenger airliners. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
For example, because of regulatory inequity, cargo operations are more susceptible to insider threats, making them a more desirable target for those with malicious intent.  -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
However, an ever-changing threat means we can never rest. We can and we must do more. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Thanks to the leadership of this subcommittee and the work across our industry, we’ve made progress in addressing these types of security threats in both passenger and cargo operations. - ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Security incidents involving insiders are rare. - ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Insiders include aircrew members, technicians, ground handlers, vendors, as well as law enforcement and security personnel. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
An “insider” in #aviation is someone with authorization and unescorted access to secured airport areas such as the security identification display area known as the “SIDA.”
For decades, ALPA #pilots have demonstrated our commitment to #aviation security. Our members are highly vetted and trained professionals who are proud of our contributions to securing our industry. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
"ALPA appreciates Chairman @RepJohnKatko’s and Ranking Member @RepBonnie’s leadership and the subcommittee’s interest in reducing the threat posed by anyone with intent to harm while working inside the air transportation system." -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll

To date, two collisions between recreational #UAS and manned aircraft have occurred in North America this year—we must allow @FAANews to carry out this critical safety mission through regulation of all #UAS users in the national airspace. #FAAReauthorization
The provision also mandates recreational drone users to pass an aeronautical knowledge and safety test and enables @FAANews to impose critical standards for identifying all #UAS owners.
The House of Representatives’ recently passed #FAAReauthorization allows @FAANews to regulate all #UAS, when necessary, for the safety and security of the National Airspace System.

“I am also confident that we will find many other ways to work together that can yield tangible safety benefits.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“I know that there are many good reasons that the aviation community is considered the zenith of safety, and that ALPA will help get the Check the Box Safety Awareness Initiative off the ground.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“As PHMSA Administrator, I’ve encountered few groups more receptive to that observation than ALPA.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“Joint effort and collaboration are necessary links in the safety chain. If they are weak, the chain will fail, and preventable incidents will occur.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“When the subject is safety, I firmly believe that improvement on the status quo requires that all stakeholders shoulder the responsibility together.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“To do that, we must rely on more powerful things than regulation: Collaboration… Communication… Innovation… Teamwork.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“Regulation is a core function of PHMSA; but regulation alone will never result in reaching the goal of zero incidents. Such a maximum goal will never be achieved by setting and enforcing minimum standards.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“I would like to close with one very important point: we need your help. Progress in pursuing the last tiny fraction of safety is unlikely to come through more perfect rulemaking, or better enforcement, or any other regulatory function.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“This important new safety initiative would not have become a reality if not for ALPA, and their absolute commitment to improving safety.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“Through Check the Box, we hope to achieve greater public and industry awareness of common household items that are classified as hazardous materials.” -Administrator Skip Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“In many cases, people shipping dangerous goods are unaware that their package is going to be onboard an aircraft – which makes it unlikely that they will have packaged or prepared it as safely as they should have for that leg of its journey.” -Administrator Elliott of @PHMSA_DOT
“Cruising altitude certainly is not the place to discover that you are transporting dangerous goods. Shipping dangerous goods without proper designation, packaging, and handling instructions puts people’s lives at risk.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“The lack of industry and public awareness on the rules governing the shipment of lithium batteries poses additional risk across multiple transportation modes, and particularly to shipment of batteries on commercial airliners.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“This hazard is increasing exponentially with global lithium battery production capacity set to double by 2021.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“As you are aware, lithium batteries are among the items all too commonly shipped without designation as a dangerous good.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“Closing the undeclared hazardous materials gap is a matter of some urgency.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“One of the many good recommendations that emerged…was the need to quickly provide greater industry and public awareness about the hazards associated with undeclared and improperly packaged hazardous materials.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“How pilots relate to the inescapable risks of their job is a big part of the reason why. And so, we in the broader hazmat safety business would be foolish not to look to organizations like yours for guidance and leadership.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
but airline safety is one of the very few enterprises with a safety record that exceeds the others.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“There are a number of very safe transportation enterprises – such as pipeline and rail – where the risk is also heightened by the addition of hazardous materials...
“One of @PHMSA_DOT’s most consistent and important messages is that achieving zero incidents is not impossible--our success lies at a very thin margin. But airline safety performance illustrates that an even higher safety success rate can be attained.”
But when any incident can result in tragedy, “very good” is just a gentle way of saying “not quite good enough.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“Overall, the safety of operations under @PHMSA_DOT’s purview is very good, delivering energy and other hazardous materials…without incident more than 99.999% of the time.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“That leadership and dedication is why @PHMSA_DOT, as the only U.S. Safety agency charged with maintaining hazardous materials safety across all transportation modes, wants very much to work closely with and learn from organizations like yours.” -Administrator Skip Elliot
“Airline transportation professionals are clear leaders in the pursuit of both safety awareness and innovation in general, and more specifically when it includes the risks associated with transporting hazardous materials.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“I can tell you that as a confessed safety zealot, I have discovered more than a few kindred spirits among the pilot community.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“It seems counter-intuitive that hurtling through the air at several hundred miles per hour, tens of thousands of feet high, in a pressurized tube, is the safest mode of transportation.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT #ASF64
“It makes perfect sense that a Safety Administrator should gravitate toward pilots.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“Safety is just as relevant for the engineer at the throttle of a freight train pulling 200 rail cars as it is for the pilot at the controls of an airliner carrying 200 passengers.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
“I want to express that it has been a genuine pleasure to work with so many dedicated professionals on improving PHMSA-ALPA collaboration and addressing the risks posed by the shipment of undeclared dangerous goods.” -Administrator Skip Elliot of @PHMSA_DOT
We have much work to do, but that challenge is what brings us all here today. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Urgent action is required to safeguard air transportation from the threat. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
On another pressing aviation safety issue, in 2017 the FAA received 1,082 reports of hazardous material events, and 479 involved undeclared #HazMat. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
ALPA is urging lawmakers to heed the will of the American public and put safety as the highest priority by keeping two well-qualified, trained, and experienced #pilots in airliner cockpits. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
And we’re going to hear from one of our Senate champions on this issue later this morning. But the fight is not over. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll (CC: @SenDuckworth)
We’ve also stopped forward progress of a proposal in the Senate to weaken these safety regulations. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
After a lengthy fight, ALPA ensured that the recently passed House #FAAReauthorization bill does not include any changes to the current requirements. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Since these requirements were put in place in 2010, there has not been a single #pilot qualification–related fatality on a U.S. passenger airline. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #TrainedForLife #ASF64
ALPA’s #TrainedForLife campaign tells the story of how current #pilot qualification, experience, and training requirements have made flying safer. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Americans “strongly oppose” lowering existing requirements for airline #pilots and making flying less safe. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Americans also clearly understand that #aviation #safety is at stake should Congress allow any reduction in first officer qualification, experience, and training requirements. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #TrainedForLife #ASF64
It’s crystal clear that the flying public simply will not accept the lower level of #safety that would result from taking #pilots out of the cockpit. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
80 percent of Americans agree that two #pilots working together is best suited to handling an emergency in the cockpit, troubleshooting systems, and dealing with the unexpected. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #TrainedForLife
The survey we commissioned shows clearly that the majority of Americans “strongly oppose” legislation that would eliminate a #pilot from cargo airlines. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Despite these clear examples of how two #pilots in the cockpit make such a tremendous safety difference, some are attempting to remove them. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Of course, there are many examples with which everyone in this room is familiar––from the high-profile “Miracle on the Hudson” in 2009 and the #SW1380 safe landing this April, to this year’s ALPA Superior Airmanship Award recipients. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Flying will always be safest with two fully qualified, adequately trained, and well-rested #pilots at the controls in the event of an emergency. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64 #KeepFlyingSafe
You’ll learn that airline #pilots must exercise their judgment many times on a single flight, and it’s this experienced judgment that makes the safety difference. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
#ASF64 is your opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of what’s required to operate even the most advanced airliners in the world. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Some are actually arguing that flying would be safer without #pilots. Nothing could be further from the truth. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64
Save a buck or save a life, that’s the choice. There’s no question where the Air Line #pilots Association stands, and there’s now no question where the American public stands either. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64
The American public understands that air travel is the safest means of transportation, and according to the survey results, they aren’t willing to jeopardize their lives—or the lives of others—just to maybe save a buck. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64
The newly released results from a public opinion poll that was commissioned by ALPA show that Americans overwhelmingly understand…that you don’t make flying safer by removing #pilots from the cockpit. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64
I’ve flown aircraft with a complement of three pilots, two pilots, and one #pilot. I can tell you that flight operations with one #pilot are by far the least safe. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF64
Whether it’s a fire in the cargo compartment, a medical emergency, or a disruptive passenger on the aircraft, the list of possible—yet unpredictable—events is nearly endless. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
But airline #pilots must also be able to safely manage the unexpected. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
We routinely perform the expected—talk with air traffic control, check the current weather and forecasts, and observe how engines and systems are performing. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Also, as many in this room understand, airline #pilots must be able to control an aircraft in a dynamic and changing environment. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
One principle is that the most important safety assets on any airliner—cargo or passenger—are two adequately rested, fully qualified, and well-trained #pilots. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
Over more than eight decades, ALPA has learned certain basic principles about aviation safety. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
As a result, “Schedule with Safety” is ALPA’s founding principle, but it’s also our future goal. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
As many of you know, in the early days of commercial flight, working as an airline #pilot was dangerous--While they were outstanding aviators, more than half of ALPA’s founders died in airline accidents. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
I’m keenly aware that ALPA’s commitment to safety is shared by many others. Because of the collaboration fostered during this forum and events like it, air travel has become—and remains—the world’s safest mode of transportation. -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
"We’re here today to recommit ourselves to maintaining the unparalleled safety record our industry has experienced—and redoubling our efforts to keep flying safe and secure for years to come." -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll
I know I speak for every ALPA member when I say that we feel deeply proud to be airline pilots. We respect the trust that the world’s passengers and cargo shippers place in us on every flight.

When we're making decisions, we should not be making them 5000 miles away from where the decision needs to be made. -Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
There has to be someone at the controls making those decisions. -Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
The captain is there to make an ethical acceptance of risk for the passengers, the people below. -Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
Ethics is not a technical restriction--this is a moral and ethical decision to make. -Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
We need to start to give our pilots and crew decision support to give them less decisions to make. Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
Is automation actually helping us make decisions? -Capt. McCullins of @Airbus #ALPAHFConf2018
I ask aerospace engineers, why are we trying to take the pilot out of the control loop? Why not give the #pilot the control loop and automate everything else. -Dr. Pritchett of @Penn_State #ALPAHFConf2018
"Automation will force #pilots to be managers. If you don't monitor the automation closely, it will make the same mistake over and over again." -Dr. Pritchett of @Penn_State #ALPAHFConf2018
"Automation forces pilots to make decisions about the decisions that the AI is going to make--it's unfair." -Dr. Pritchett of @Penn_State
Interacting with touch displays is very cross-generational--it's not just new pilots, but also mid-career pilots as well. -Mark Nikolic of @BoeingAirplanes #ALPAHFConf2018
Shayne Daku from @UNDAerospace: All but 3 of our training craft are glass panel instruments. #ALPAHFConf2018

"We have nine fleets across @Delta airlines, and CRM transcends all that." - Capt. Piroumian, Training Coordinator CC:@Delta_MEC_Comm  #ALPAHFConf2018
We need to expose our #pilots to the unexpected. -Capt. Hogeman, Director of Flight Training Support for @united #ALPAHFConf2018
When #pilots come to work every day, they want to fly a perfect flight. - Capt. Hogeman, @united  #ALPAHFConf2018
Capt. Piroumian: How do we take these soft skills and incorporate them into procedures? How do we quantify CRM? Observations of flight deck behaviors and train using that as a standard. #ALPAHFConf2018
Deciding what you need to pay attention to is based on technical training. It relies on a lot of systems, knowledge, and operational expertise. -Dr. Holder, @Honeywell_Aero #ALPAHFConf2018
Situational awareness isn't something #pilots do--it's the result of what they do. -Dr. Barbara Holder of @Honeywell_Aero #ALPAHFConf2018
"Concerns with merging the training of the technical and non-technical skills is having objective and measurable performance standards." Capt. McKenney #ALPAHFConf2018
"CRM has evolved today to define a set of skills that supports pilot technical and decision-making flying capabilities." - Capt. McKenney #ALPAHFConf2018
"Crew resource management has evolved and matured over the years since CRM training began in the late 1970’s." Capt. McKenney #ALPAHFConf2018
In addition to technical skills, pilots require additional human capabilities to manage the variability, complexity, and handling of unknown or unexpected situations associated with flying the airplane in real world operations. -Capt. McKenney of ALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
"A fully qualified pilot requires a high degree of expertise in both motor skills and cognition in order to safely operate the aircraft in the airspace system." - Capt. Dave McKenney, Director of Pilot Training at ALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
Our next panel is about Beyond Crew Resource Management. We'll have Dr. Barbara Holder, Technology Fellow at @Honeywell_Aero, Capt. Rob Piroumian, Training Coordinator at @Delta Human Factors Working Group, and Capt. Chuck Hogerman, Director of Flight Training Support at @United
"Make sure, when you're hunting for [information], it's easily accessible--that is the higher priority...Make sure you're listening to the #pilots...who are giving you valuable feedback." - Dr. Kanki of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018
You can't have a programmer making the design decision [for flight deck information systems]...it has to be from #pilot feedback and input. - Dr. Barbara Kanki of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018

"We have the opportunity to discuss the problems created by our headlong rush into further automation and digitization on the flight deck and demonstrate ways to better access content and reduce distractions." -Capt. Moynihan, @AlaskaMECALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
Going digital has relieved the pilot from the manual task of revising changes. While this is a great time saver, it creates a large opportunity to miss important changes. - Capt. Moynihan, @AlaskaMECALPA #ALPAHFConf2018

Step 1 for airlines is to understand the expertise and data they already have in a disciplined, systematic way. - Capt. Giullian, @JetBlueALPA
It's the humans who make the system work for humans' sake. We better design the system to be human centered to best support the humans in their work. -Dr. Barshi of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018
#Pilots intervene in various ways on 100% of flights! - Dr. Barshi of @NASAAmes
Functional complexity failure is a failure due to the complexity of the design - Dr. Barshi of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018
Full Automation won't work because only takes one human out of the process...it doesn't take the other humans, from the maintainers and trainers, out of the process. - Dr. Barshi of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018

"Human centered procedures need to take cognitive biases into account." -Capt. Berman, @UnitedPilots #ALPAHFConf2018
Capt. Berman, @unitedpilots: Human centered procedures include: minimize workflow, present salient info, procedures &amp; displays should have antidote to cognitive biases, accept that #pilots are human and build in safeguards, and keeping pilots mentally engaged #ALPAHFConf2018
There are multiple cognitive challenges when piloting a plane. - Capt. Dan Berman, @UnitedPilots #ALPAHFConf2018
Capt. Dan Berman of @UnitedPilots: Open communication on the flight deck is extremely important in air safety. #ALPAHFConf2018
If the role of human resilience isn't clear in your operating philosophies, then it will fall apart in your policies and procedures. - Capt. Guillian, @JetBlueALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
In implementing these human centered operating principles, the common theme was extreme discipline at every step of the way. -Capt. Guillian, @JetBlueALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
Scenarios work better when you don't make them too complicated. -Capt. Guillian @JetBlueALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
Human centered operating principles started with the #pilots and moved to tech, dispatchers, ground ops, and the other parts of @JetBlue - Capt. Guillian, @JetBlueALPA
The mental muscle that #pilots use to monitor the flight path during autopiloting is built during manual handling, so we began to encourage manual handling. - Capt. Guillian of @JetBlueALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
On this panel, we have Capt. Steve Guillian of @JetBlueALPA, Capt. Ben Berman of @UnitedPilots and Dr. Immanuel Barshi of @NASAAmes #ALPAHFConf2018

"The #Section744 attempt to force taxpayers to pay for research without any benefit to the public safety or security is a corporate giveaway and doesn't belong in the #FAAReauthorization." - ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #TrainedForLife #ALPAHFConf2018
ICYMI: "Calling for this type of research [in #Section744] isn't the role of government...if a business case exists to remove and remotely position a pilot...industry, not taxpayers should be paying for it." -ALPA Pres. Capt. Tim Canoll #TrainedForLife #FAAReauthorization
We're moving to our first networking break at #ALPAHFConf2018. We'll be back after a short break.
"How can current training programs be changed to take resilience as a focus?" - Mike Michaelis of @AlliedPilots. "We need to make training move beyond checking off boxes on a checklist." - Shawn Pruchnicki of @OhioState
We're losing opportunities to connect with other #pilots to share stories and experience. - Capt. Donaldson of @AlaskaMECALPA #ALPAHFConf2018
Pilots need opportunities to explore, but the #pilot needs to have the desire to expand. This will help with resilience. -Lou Nemeth of @CAE_Inc
Variance in flight simulator operators is similar to variance in real-world situation. - Mr. Shawn Pruchnicki of @OhioState #ALPAHFConf2018
"There's a lot of value in studying what went right." - Capt. Donaldson of @AlaskaMECALPA #ALPAHFConf2018 CC:@AlaskaAir
"We should be trying to grow expertise...expertise that they can apply when the unexpected does indeed happen...so they can be truly resilient." Mr. Shawn Pruchnicki of @OhioState Aviation #ALPAHFConf2018

for the use of their airports. Such actions would represent a promising development. However, the UAE’s actions will serve as the true test of its commitment to fair competition. ALPA will closely watch how the UAE delivers on these commitments.”
“The UAE has committed to a freeze on any additional fifth-freedom passenger flights to the United States. It has also pledged to employ international accounting, auditing, and disclosure standards. The agreement will also require Emirates and Etihad Airways to pay customary fee
and regardless of the need to make a profit. As a result, U.S. airlines that follow the rules have competed at a severe disadvantage, and the jobs of hardworking U.S. airline employees have been at risk.
The UAE has been violating this agreement by providing massive subsidies to Emirates and Etihad Airways, its state-owned airlines. The subsidies have allowed these foreign airlines to do business internationally with enormous economic advantages over U.S. airlines
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll: "We applaud @realDonaldTrump administration for taking important steps to bring the United Arab Emirates into compliance with the U.S. Air Transport Agreement and its requirement that our companies maintain a fair and equal opportunity to compete.

.@FAANews #Reauthorization also defends fair competition for U.S. workers by addressing flag-of-convenience schemes that allow foreign airlines to avoid labor, tax, and safety laws by basing different pieces of their business in different countries,
Thank you @RepPeterDeFazio for amendment allowing @FAANews to regulate UAS flown by hobbyists to enhance the safety of all who operate in the national airspace, including planes carrying passengers and cargo.
The bill also "mandates secondary cockpit barriers on new passenger airliners; prescribes the automatic acceptance of voluntary safety reports; and supports the authorization of pilot assistance programs."
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll on @FAANews Reauthorization: “The measure maintains life-saving F/O qualification, training, and experience requirements; improves the safe transport by air of lithium batteries."
We applaud U.S. House @FAANews Reauthorization passage maintaining pilot training requirements integral to air safety and the advancement of fair competition for U.S. skies. #HR4 #FAAReauthorization #onelevelofsafety https://t.co/3bFlxw2F87

"The [drone] industry wants a lot of things...but we have to focus on the challenges to doing these things safely...As long as the @FAANews and the industry keep coordinating at the very high level they are right now, they're gonna get there."
"We're firm believers that reducing the number of hours or training will not solve the problem of attracting #pilots to the job."
"If the vehicle is intended to fly or has the capability to fly into our national airspace...then the development of procedures, certification and operation of that vehicle must be very much aligned with what we do today in manned aviation."

"Let’s make the same commitment today not to go backwards. Not to settle for less. Not to find shortcuts or work-arounds. Let’s continue to do the hard work of making air travel the safest mode of transportation in the world."--ALPA Capt. Tim Canoll #KeepFlyingSafe
It happened because…we came together, petitioned our government and passed life-saving measures to #KeepFlyingSafe.
"Together, we’ve done something very meaningful: we’ve saved lives and we’ve made our industry stronger in the process. We all know this didn’t happen by accident. We know it wasn’t easy."--Capt. Tim Canoll
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll: "Lawmakers must also fund the Small Community Air Service Development Program in its entirety."
ALPA is doing more than ever to inspire the next generation of airline pilots.
Hundreds of ALPA pilots volunteer to visit primary and secondary schools each year and participate in community events to encourage students to look into becoming a pilot.
"We applaud a measure introduced in Congress last year to create an FAA Women in Aviation Advisory Board to inspire more women to join our profession."--Capt. Tim Canoll
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll: "Six percent is the percentage of airline #pilots who are women. Only eight percent are Hispanic or Latino, and less than two percent are African American or Asian." @AeroClubDC
Our industry can also do more to reach out to new audiences and encourage them to consider an airline #pilot or aviation career.
Our union stands ready to assist others in breaking down barriers that may impede them from pursuing careers in aviation, while maintaining the highest standards of safety.
"We applaud the @USDOT and @SecElaineChao’s commitment to making it easier for our #veterans to work in the best industry in the world."--Capt. Tim Canoll at @AeroClubDC
https://t.co/1WwUuadEP4
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll: "Take it from me, U.S. airline workers can go up against any foreign airline, as long as the competition is fair."
ALPA's Capt. Tim Canoll: "ALPA is hopeful because the @realDonaldTrump administration recently took initial steps to end such unfair trade practices and allow American workers to compete on a level playing field."
ALPA will never let up in our fight against the atypical business models and foreign government subsidies that both threaten our airlines’ ability to compete as well as our careers.
ALPA president Capt. Tim Canoll at @AeroclubDC: "One-time bonuses are no substitute for long-term contract improvements that pilots can count on as they pay for school and raise their families."
"ALPA #pilots take tremendous pride in the contribution to the safety of air transportation that we’ve made, along with many other stakeholders, including each of you in this room."--Capt. Canoll
"We must also must ensure the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems. We know from recent close calls that UAS pose a serious risk—and it’s growing." --Capt. Canoll
ALPA is working with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to advance a four-part solution to safeguard air transportation.
Capt. Canoll: "Safety is inextricably linked with the success and growth of U.S. air transportation. Safety must be as much a part of the future of the U.S. airline industry as it has been a part of its past." @AeroClubDC
Capt. Canoll: "The good news is that we currently have more fully qualified pilots in the United States than there are commercial positions available."
"No one is more committed than we are to ensuring we have enough qualified and experienced pilots to keep the aviation industry strong and competitive."--Capt. Canoll
Capt. Canoll: "None of us would want to go to a surgeon who has only some of the qualifications and training needed to safely perform a potentially risky procedure. The same holds true for airline #pilots."
"Take it from us, your #pilots, experience saves lives."--Capt. Tim Canoll @AeroClubDC
Capt. Tim Canoll: "We’re not willing to gamble with our passengers’ safety to run some policy experiment pulled from a white paper or a power point presentation."
Capt. Tim Canoll: "There are those who believe that we can reduce training hours and keep flying safe. We simply don’t agree." #KeepFlyingSafe

RT @PAndersonC12: Met with @RepVisclosky staff today to discuss provisions included in #HR2997 which will #KeepFlyingSafe @WeAreALPA @afa_c…
The provisions of #HR2997 #keepflyingsafe. As currently drafted, the Senate bill reduces safety.
#HR2997 keeps open reliever airports that are used in emergencies when crossing the Pacific.
#HR2997 allows for safety data that is voluntarily reported by employees to be put to use more quickly to prevent #aviation accidents.
#HR2997 also includes a mandate for secondary cockpit barriers to prevent unlawful breaches into the cockpit.
The House bill protects pilot training standards. This is another reason ALPA supports #HR2997.
Before implementing stricter training standards, more than 1,100 people lost their lives in #aviation accidents.
Since stricter training standards were required in a 2010 FAA bill, there have been zero fatalities on U.S. passenger airliners.
The Senate FAA bill (S. 1405) includes a provision to weaken #pilot training standards, against ALPA’s priority to #keepflyingsafe.
Protecting the service and safety of rural air transportation is a top priority of ALPA.
#HR2997 retains and reaffirms the EAS program, as well as continues other programs to support small communities
Under #HR2997, all existing unions, bargaining structures, collective bargaining agreements, and fed. employee benefits carry over.
With respect to labor rights of ATO employees, #HR2997 does not change the union election &amp; organizing rules.
#HR2997 increases labor protections for workers in many ways, protecting against unfair competition from flags-of-convenience airlines.
#HR2997 protects the collective bargaining rights of every employee potentially affected by a structural change at the @FAANews.
ALPA,@NATCA &amp; @afa_cwa have endorsed #HR2997 because it is in the best interests of #aviation safety. https://t.co/mU5wdX6akj

#Pilots should be vigilant. Airport lighting &amp; other nighttime visual aids should be used in low ambient light conditions. #eclipseQandA

ALPA to @NASA: What can #pilots expect during the #eclipse? #eclipseQandA #eclipse2017 #solareclipse2017 #eclipse11
This @NASA interactive map will give #pilots an idea of how flights may be affected by the #eclipse. #eclipseQandA https://t.co/olxcm0xAvS
.@NASA : For any location, the #eclipse will last several hrs, but the period of #totaleclipse (#totality) will be 2–3 mins. #eclipseQandA
ALPA to @NASA: How long will the #eclipse last? #eclipseQandA #eclipse2017
For passenger/crew safety, #NASA &amp; ALPA advise flight crews not to make any maneuvers to assist in viewing the #eclipse. #eclipseQandA
.@NASA even briefly looking at the sun during any phase of #partialeclipse could cause permanent damage to your eyes. #eclipseQandA
At any level of partial #eclipse, one must use #eclipseglasses certified by ISO 12312-2 or with #14 welders glass or darker. #eclipseQandA
.@NASA: The *only* time it’s safe to look at the #sun during the #eclipse is during the 2–3 min period of totality. #eclipseQandA
ALPA: How/when can passengers &amp; crew safely look at the #sun during the #eclipse? #eclipseQandA #eclipse2017 #solareclipse2017

“Thank you to all who joined us today. ALPA appreciates your strong support of aviation safety.” -Capt. Tim Canoll
Capt. Tim Canoll: “ALPA is pleased that the House version of the FAA reauthorization supports pilot assistance programs.” #ASF63
Capt. Tim Canoll: “The de facto self-certification of any critical safety component risks the safety of the entire system.” #ASF63
“The current rule for the adoption &amp; implementation of Canadian Fatigue Risk Management Systems is wholly inadequate.” -Capt. Tim Canoll
Capt. Tim Canoll: ALPA will also call for a single implementation structure for all Canadian carriers that fly commercial operations.
“Likewise, ALPA will provide strong comments on the newly released Canadian flight-time/duty-time rules.” -Capt. Tim Canoll
Capt. Canoll: ALPA will continue to fight for science-based flight and duty-time limits and minimum rest requirements for cargo pilots.
(2/2) But more must be done, including ensuring that shipping containers can adequately contain a lithium battery fire.
Capt. Canoll: The House version of the bill requires the U.S. to meet international standards for transporting lithium batteries (1/2)
Capt. Canoll: In 2015, our industry experienced appx. 1,200 hazmat incidents, many of which involved undeclared hazmat shipments.
ALPA looks forward to working with Congress to ensure this reauthorization does even more to protect passengers and cargo. #ASF63
We must innovate screening technology, secure SIDA access for cargo areas, &amp; address supernumeraries on cargo aircraft. -Capt. Canoll
ALPA supports the mandating of secondary cockpit barriers for new aircraft in the House Reauthorization bill. -Capt. Canoll #ASF63
“ALPA supports this plan, which will force our international partners to raise their aviation security standards.” -Capt. Tim Canoll
ALPA applauded when Dept. of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly’s announced a phased, proactive plan to improve aviation security.
Chairman Shuster’s proposal provides a safe structure to achieve the necessary goals in restructuring our ATC system. -Capt. Canoll
ALPA supports the goal of providing predictable, long-term funding for modernization in restructuring U.S. air traffic control system.
One thing will never change: ALPA’s position that any ATC restructure must be focused on safety. -Capt. Tim Canoll
I’m proud to be a member of the @FAANews Drone Advisory Committee. My fellow members agree that safety is the top priority. -Capt. Canoll
It’s unacceptable to wait for an accident before we do more to address the air transport risks posed by unsafe use of UAS. -Capt. Canoll
“We know from FAA data that UAS are often found far too close to airliners carrying passengers and cargo.” -Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF63
We recognize the innovative value of unmanned aircraft systems, but we must treat them as aircraft in the airspace. -Capt. Canoll #ASF63
ALPA applauds the House bill for protecting voluntary safety reporting data to address threats before accidents occur. -Capt. Canoll
Capt. Tim Canoll: “One of our industry’s strongest tools is voluntary, non-punitive safety reporting programs.” #ASF63 #KeepFlyingSafe
ALPA will block any effort to erode the rules that have led to the safest time in history for U.S. airline passengers &amp; cargo shippers.
@FAANews reauthorization bill is currently on the floor of the House. We urge lawmakers to keep their commitment to safety. -Capt. Canoll
Capt. Canoll: The House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee has taken a strong stand for safety by upholding rules in its bill.
The amendment to the FAA reauthorization will weaken the pilot training, qualification, and experience requirements. -Capt. Tim Canoll
Capt. Canoll: “We were extremely disappointed by the Senate Commerce Committee’s amendment to its version of the @FAANews reauthorization.”
Capt. Canoll: Special-interest groups try to deny it, but the zero-U.S. passenger airline-accident-fatality record speaks for itself.
The action of Congress in 2010, &amp; resulting FAA actions in 2013, have greatly contributed to the current level of safety. -Capt. Canoll
“Airline passengers want and deserve safe air transportation across the U.S., including in rural and smaller communities.” -Capt. Canoll
Capt. Canoll: Despite these numbers, special interests seek to lower workforce costs, lining their own pockets at the expense of safety.
Numbers don’t lie: Since current pilot qualification requirements were passed, airline fatalities went from 1,100 to zero. -Capt. Canoll
“We are all here united in a single purpose: making air transportation safer. -Capt. Tim Canoll #ASF63 #KeepFlyingSafe

ALPA is proposing better training for handlers to know how to identify, properly package &amp; route hazmat. -Capt. Tim Canoll #keepflyingsafe
.@faanews finds appx. two packages per day of undeclared hazmat shipped on cargo and passenger aircraft.
To reduce hazardous materials threat, Congress must better understand the scope of the problem. -Capt. Tim Canoll #keepflyingsafe
We must focus on actually enforcing rules for hazardous materials. Doing nothing is not an option. -Capt. Tim Canoll #keepflyingsafe
Capt. Tim Canoll: Top priority in @faanews bill to protect existing safety regs, especially minimum F/O qualifications. #keepflyingsafe
Capt. Tim Canoll: ALPA’s No. 1 priority is to #keepflyingsafe. Safety must never come second to the greed of regional airlines.
Airspace safety depends on well-trained, qualified pilots in both seats of the cockpit. -Capt. Tim Canoll #keepflyingsafe
