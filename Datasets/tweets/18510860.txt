16/16 And if you do need to find a good rehab facility, here are seven tips: https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/WkDmitHJQr
15/ Read the full investigation here: https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh
14/ Listen to Mother Jones reporter @julia_lurie talk about her investigation on this week's episode of the @MoJoPodcast: ‚ÄúThe more I called around, the more I connected with parents and people who had been through this. And it just sounded hellish.‚Äù https://t.co/3yXdQZJsvD
13/ As for Brianne, she was sober as of last December‚Äîand planning to attend Georgia Highlands College in the fall.
12/ While legislators are catching up on regulating the industry, some rehabs are taking action. The industry‚Äôs main trade group recently revised its code of ethics to prohibit members from ‚Äúbuying and selling‚Ä¶ patient leads.‚Äù
11/ Despite the depth of the problem, raising the standard of care‚Äîand providing addiction medications and trained medical staffers‚Äîwould drive many rehabs out of business.
10/ As addiction and overdose rates soar, the demand for treatment, the white face of addiction, and recent laws requiring insurers to cover substance use services have all resulted in a surge in rehab spending and private investment. https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/5XlQPcJ99W
Jay Inslee says he‚Äôll make ‚Äúdefeating climate change our nation‚Äôs number 1 priority.‚Äù https://t.co/t9JqtMUyxj
Arkansas regulators voted last Wednesday to relax restrictions on the controversial weedkiller dicamba, despite testimony from top scientists and scores of concerned citizens who urged them to reject the move in a public hearing. https://t.co/5nYj2cpwxA
9/ A quick aside: While experts say the practices described here are widespread, there are responsible treatment providers‚Äînot all facilities named engage in all practices we describe. Still, it‚Äôs nearly impossible for users to tell ethical, evidence-based rehabs from others.
8/ Rehabs and their brokers often market directly to addicts‚Äîor appeal to desperate parents on Facebook. Here‚Äôs a 2016 screenshot we obtained between two rehab marketers: https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/UseUCxi8eh
7/ One broker we talked to, Peter, says he is paid $5,000 to $12,000 for each client admitted to treatment, which breaks down to about $500 an hour. (Peter‚Äôs name has been changed.) https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/JaE395080E
6/ For example, the amounts billed to Brianne‚Äôs insurance seemed outlandish: $3,000 for a routine drug test and, in one case, $22,000 in rehab charges in a single day. Here‚Äôs what private insurance claims for opioid users looked like between 2011 and 2015: https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/BrbO2e6cMc
President Donald Trump just lashed out at Michael Cohen, accusing his former longtime attorney of committing perjury during his explosive testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform earlier this week. https://t.co/Q6AqKKFGYD
5/ For rehab owners and brokers who make money each time a patient is admitted, relapses can be a profit center.
4/ Brianne became a part of what‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúFlorida shuffle,‚Äù a cycle wherein recovering users are wooed aggressively by rehabs and freelance ‚Äúpatient brokers‚Äù in an effort to fill beds and collect insurance money.
3/ She took him up on the offer‚Äîand between 2016 and 2018, went in and out of rehab dozens of times, often in places that were setting her up for failure. 		Many rehab centers don‚Äôt offer FDA-approved addiction medication or employ any doctors. https://t.co/uMCW06XxRh https://t.co/HOVqyLAhCi
2/ First, meet Brianne, a 22-year-old former softball star caught in the addiction-rehab cycle. She was addicted to heroin and had committed to sobering up. Then, in 2017 a man offered her a deal too good to refuse: go to rehab, and get paid $1,000 per week.

11/ Parents of the Parkland victims took a stand against gun lobbyists‚Äîand have been an indomitable force ever since. https://t.co/SCt9zugS6s

9/ After the march, we met leaders @JaclynCorin, @MattxRed, and @Alex_King737: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what our age is. Most of the things we say are facts or stories, and those don‚Äôt have age limits.‚Äù https://t.co/SBuomuKgEa
8/ The movement inspired other teens to speak up as well, such as @daniellejohnsxn, a student at Newtown High School who traveled to DC‚Äôs rally. 		Sandy Hook rocked Danielle‚Äôs childhood. Now, she‚Äôs an advocate for gun control (and angry as hell): https://t.co/0TRkd4vNZ1

5/ Thanks to the students‚Äô activism, Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed gun control and school security measures into law in March. It was the first time in decades new gun restrictions had passed in the state. https://t.co/1VXyTm5XfO
4/ Too young to vote themselves, the Parkland survivors urged others to support candidates with strong gun control policies. https://t.co/xRnwgKl4sC
3/ At a CNN town hall in February last year, the teenagers confronted politicians about NRA money flooding politics. 		This is worth rewatching: https://t.co/4vQL5nta5k
2/ Days after the tragedy, students across the country spoke out, demanding action against gun violence and calling ‚ÄúBS‚Äù on lawmakers‚Äô response to the shooting. ‚ÄúTo every politician who is taking money from the NRA,‚Äù said @Emma4Change, ‚Äúshame on you.‚Äù https://t.co/c2asSJ8MBP
1/ It‚Äôs been a year since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.		Parkland survivors demanded action‚Äîand gave America the conversation about guns it desperately needed to have. Here‚Äôs a look at how much they've accomplished.
