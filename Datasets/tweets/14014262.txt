@mbaratz @DanishDhamani Very cool! Just downloaded :)
Been on hold for ten minutes. 5-10 more to go.
Rep: "..... Oh..... You can mail it in!"	Me: "..... um.... Can't I just upload the image to your site or app?"	Rep: "They are afraid someone will steal the information."	Me: ".....um..."	Rep: "Let me transfer you to someone in the general banking department." (less cheery voice).
Waited on hold for 14 minutes, then the rep suggests: "You can fax it in!" (said in a cheery voice)	Me: "I don't own a fax machine; it's 2019."	Rep: "You can fax it from your office!" (still cheery)	Me: "I work for a remote company. There is no office; I work from home."
Just tried to apply for an @Ally savings account using my phone. I need to upload another verification file, but the site maxed out at two and won't let me do more. So I call, excited to be a part of this "friendly" online bank. .....

@jtriest Happy to be a part. Potential topic: challenges of being in the kippa crowd on the startup road.
@jtriest It's fun and impressive. Also, as I'm currently delayed in an airport - love the content, wish there was more.
@United so far full work day (8 hrs) of delays this month and NO cust service response (credit, miles, etc). Plat aint what it used to be.
Dear @United, no matter how many times I try to get home to my family, flight delays. So far LAX-IAD 120min delayed and no options.

Bracing for an #epic week - a Friday meeting really inspired me to think bigger about @loop88tweets.
Tomorrow morning first day back @WeWork DC in six weeks.
@drdresay We (@loop88tweets) are in active fundraising more - so I am interested in the model, but would need to understand more.

@pakman Gokul's last comment was a real jab at Google: come to Facebook, we can get individuals + track what they do, here or elsewhere.
