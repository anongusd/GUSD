LSC member says developer has to understand why community upset. People always try to give Austin what they want w/o asking what it needs
Developer says low offer is due to high cost to renovate. Prepared to invest $20M to turn into health center
CPS lawyer says offer for Emmet was $75,000. Residents in audience gasp &amp; one yells "Thieves!" Much lower than smaller school got in Austin
Resident says his gut &amp; experience tells him this is a done deal &amp; meeting just to say engaged community. How much will CPS make? he asks
Another resident says untrue that no community input. Had Emmet redevelopment committee that met many times w/ developer, working on CBA
Community member says "clearly this is a neighborhood CPS doesn't care about." Adds "the days are over when you can just come in &amp; build"
Speaker says if there was only one bid for closed school, maybe process needs to be rethought. Likens it to "uncontested election"
Truss says "we need to press the reset button" on repurposing Emmet b/c Austin community has been "disrespected in terms of process"
Austin resident Dwayne Truss says community was supposed to have say in what happened w/ shuttered schools "and that didn't happen at all"
Hospital worker says all that's being proposed for health center already exists in Austin. Community needs grocery store, affordable housing
2nd speaker says not anti-development but wants to see stronger process when projects like this come to community so residents have voice
Dentist who works across from closed Emmet school says news of project scant: "Why isn't this getting out to the community?" he asks
Taliaferro says this is opportunity to turnaround blighted school. Can this reduce crime on W Side? Absolutely, he says, if it provides jobs
.@chris29thward says Austin hasn't seen real development in community in a decade &amp; benefits of this proposed project 'immensely great'
There will be time for community questions/feedback at end of mtg, but unclear what happens if there's opposition bc there was only 1 bidder
Alderman was getting comm input when #CPS took over process &amp; put Emmet up for sale. Technically this mtg optional https://t.co/xXlkTyM8Py

Hyman says need to create balance between what higher ed has been traditionally &amp; what needs to be. Shift is happening nationally
Hyman says will be hard to sustain outcomes if state budget crisis not resolved. Will be hard to keep absorbing cuts
Hyman recommends dual enrollment for HSers. Says @ChiCityColleges now has 3,000 students in dual credit classes
Now on to questions for @Chancellor_CCC
Hyman says for now her passion rests w/ helping students at @ChiCityColleges
Hyman says after she leaves @ChiCityColleges she's going to take a vacation, then will embark on new journey (tho won't say what that is)
Hyman says colleges in Michigan, NY, Florida do reverse transfers, like City Colleges (giving associate degrees to students who transfer)
Hyman addresses Crain's story on how dead students given degrees. She says just a handful got 'out of respect.' Don't count in grad rate
Hyman says can't let 'cynicism get the best of us' in response 2 critique that higher-skill programs going to N Side https://t.co/7cxvH00gIM
Hyman says same for colleges. Can't afford to build seven stellar nursing, manufacturing or transportation programs all over city
Hyman says in 'a perfect world' there would be a Fortune 500 company in every neighborhood... But that's not case
Hyman says you can't make big changes without 'a few storms' (headlines announcing her departure in a year said tenure was 'stormy')
Hyman says City Colleges not planning any layoffs in coming school year's budget. Says w/o reinvention plan, this wouldn't be possible
Hyman says Hercules 'had it easy' because his challenges didn't include labor negotiations
Hyman says they expect to have 2,000+ Star Scholars at City Colleges this fall
Hyman points to increase in degrees awarded and grad rate for full-time students as successes (tho full-time make up small % of enrollment)
Hyman says we have to stop being afraid of 'corporate takeover' of education. Need to welcome people w business background, like her, to ed
Hyman says City Colleges needed more diverse administration, including diversity of thought/experience. Need to include education &amp; business
Hyman says City Colleges needed clear goals, this marked cultural shift. Says low grad rate was due to lack of clear paths, too few supports
Hyman says it wasn't until she dropped out of HS, was homeless for a time that she realized importance of education
Hyman says she's walked 24 blocks from her old home in Henry Horner homes to City Colleges district office
Hyman says thousands of students are in better place thanks to reinvention plan

And that's a wrap on the School Policy Forum questions
.@JennyNagaoka says shouldn't just be about measuring where kids got to, but guiding adults as they offer these experiences #CSPF16
Q: How do you measure this? How know if having impact? @CamilleFarring says part is kids' behaviors (attendance, turn in work). Also surveys
Morales of @MikvaChallenge says movement, games, engagement thats part of younger grades informs their work, wishes was part of whole system
Norwood of @YMCAChicago says have 2 look at where students are &amp; where came from 2 help them best take advantage of job shadow/college visit
Morales of @MikvaChallenge says its disservice not 2 bring soft skills into school day. Not fair students choose between after-school &amp; work
Morales of @MikvaChallenge says budget problems never going to go away. Will always have funding issues in CPS. #CSPF16
Khan of @embarcchicago says need to think about prioritizing time in school day we have. Think about including 'community days' in calendar
Q: What can be done during tough budget times, especially as CPS faces big cuts? #CSPF16
Khan says when @embarcchicago paired New Trier &amp; CPS students had them do city navigation challenge that both found hard #CSPF16
Khan of @embarcchicago says when pairing disadvantaged/wealthier students can't be a 'pity party.' Need to meet on neutral ground #CSPF16
Norwood of @YMCAChicago says have to prepare students so they're ready to be in new spaces. Teach about code-switching #CSPF16
Khan: Can't just say let's take our kids places. Have 2 train partners on being welcoming, have 2 train students on social/emotional skills
Morales says being trained at @MikvaChallenge to better talk w/ youth about race &amp; class so can be more explicit about inequities #CSPF16
Morales says they have to give @MikvaChallenge students 'real talk' that adults may not be ready for them. Have to train adults too #CSPF16
Khan says many adults also isolated. Asks them to see opening their doors not as 'charity' but as way to connect w/ students #CSPF16
Khan of @embarcchicago says their work requires many businesses, restaurants, entrepreneurs to open their doors to students #CSPF16
Norwood of @YMCAChicago says they ask parents about their concerns &amp; use that to shape their programming #CSPF16
Now moving on to questions. Q: How are you engaging parents, community members? How broaden circle? #CSPF16
.@CamilleFarring says should look at lack of experiences as 'deficit in opportunity' not deficit in youth #CSPF16
Morales says if bring together youth in panels can raise empathy. Hear from one another &amp; create 'mini culture shocks' to boost discourse
Morales says we need to give teens choices, let their interests be part of school curriculum. #CSPF16
Morales says we blame youth for laziness, apathy but we forget that as adults we haven't invited them to decision-making process #CSPF16
Morales of @MikvaChallenge says many youth of color don't see themselves as part of larger Chi story. Don't see people who look like them
Khan says schools need to build in time for field trips &amp; exposing students to experiences. Need to rethink schedules #CSPF16
Khan says @embarcchicago started small but now works w/ 10 schools. Isolation &amp; lack of access to experiences is part of cycle of poverty
Khan says Harper HS teachers started to take students on trips to restaurants, businesses. Saw scores go up #CSPF16
Khan says at Harper HS many students had never been outside a 4 block radius of home, had never seen lake or Millennium Park #CSPF16
Khan of @embarcchicago used to teach at Harper HS. Says there he realized what violence &amp; poverty looks like in everyday life #CSPF16
Norwood of @YMCAChicago says often Chi students don't realize people from their neighborhoods doing great things, excelling at work #CSPF16
Norwood of @YMCAChicago says their programming for middle schoolers pairs 1st gen college-goers w/ suburban students to encourage reflection
Now hearing panel w/ Imran Khan, CEO of @embarcchicago, Michelle Morales Chi ED @MikvaChallenge &amp; LaDawn Norwood of @YMCAChicago #CSPF16
Role of adults is to provide those developmental experiences to youth in supportive environment says @CamilleFarring
.@CamilleFarring says youth need to be able to see path forward to future, what might do for work. But can't always connect dots w/o help
.@CamilleFarring says youth need opportunities to contribute to family, community, work &amp; then reflect. Critical to adolescent development.
.@CamilleFarring says youth learn from action &amp; reflection. Literature shows exposure to new things can lead to stable identity as adult
Also important considerations: youth mindset, self-regulation, interconnected identities, values, having agency. Success not just 1 thing
.@JennyNagaoka says definition of success for youth also includes being happy, being part of community. More than just school
.@JennyNagaoka says when she started researching for 2015 report realized "success" not just about getting through college or having a job.

Why should schools move away from suspensions? NYC student activists weigh in via @patrick_wall @ChalkbeatNY https://t.co/bqCscbxjQ4
Comer: All you do w/ charters is create another layer in system. Leaves behind some kids &amp; takes money from public schools.
Comer: The public school still represents the idea that everyone has the chance to interact w/ the mainstream. Has to be the ideal.
Kotlowitz: With privatization trend over last 10 years, charters, is this good for education? Comer: I don't think so.
Comer: Need to test for accountability purposes but should be focusing on child development. Tests shouldn't be used the way we use them now
Comer: But it's like teaching someone to climb Everest. Not everyone can do that
Q from audience: Is grit teachable? Comer: My parents and those in neighborhood taught grit. It's encouragement of children despite the odds
Comer: Students are protesting &amp; they should be. How you support children and families is something we should be concerned about
Comer says things better &amp; worse than when he was a kid. His 1st day on campus at college was thrown out of restaurant b/c he is black
Comer: It's not about test scores at all. That will come if create school that lets you learn how 2 interact w others, feel good about self
Kotlowitz: Concept of grit your thoughts? Comer: Don't think its that simple. About having supportive people around you, restoring community
Kotlowitz: Big struggle here in Chicago is violence, makes ed difficult. Disrupts whats going on. How deal w/ that? https://t.co/SekFEfEROQ
Comer: You need schools that are run in way that everyone feels like they belong ie morning exercises that let kids express themselves.
Kotlowitz: In CPS, schools sometimes have just one social worker who's there infrequently &amp; has lots of paperwork
Comer: Also schools need to link up w/ social service agencies that focus on what kids really need
Comer: Having team trickles down to how school is run &amp; how kids behave. Integrate basic social &amp; academic skills &amp; arts. Creates buy in
Comer: You have to understand what's going on w/ the kids. Create a school planning &amp; management team that looks at this collaboratively.
Kotlowitz: What does that culture look like in schools? Comer: You help teachers understand that bad behavior isn't just 'bad kids.'
Comer: But schools can grapple w issues. It's about creating right atmosphere, engaging parents. Can't be 2 focused on individual behavior
Kotlowitz: what are we not doing in schools that we should? Comer: don't think it's schools that need 2 change. Can't do it all w/ one piece
Comer says there's been two generations of downward mobility, economy has changed. Takes more than academics to prepare students
Kotlowitz says w/ 10+ years of school reform, schools are anything but transcendent, esp in areas like South/West Side. Where go wrong?
