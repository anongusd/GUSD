Out S.Sudanese went to kenya to get Education, They pay universities fees , Rent Houses , get treatment from kenya Hospitals it is kenya who is benifiting , there is No need for Kenya  Police to arrest them Illegally B/C our people have Valid papers &amp; UNHCR Documents .
South Sudanese people have no Bussiness in kenya Why Kenyan Police is targetting them ? And it is Kenyan who are doing Bussiness  in South Sudan , Our people deserve protection .. they are not Criminals , they done deserve such kind of mistreatment from kenya police ..
Our message to Government of Kenya they have to respect our people let them not forget that there is more then 979,000 Kenyan who are working in South Sudan &amp; most of them they done have work permit , Valid Visas even they Enter S.Sudan Ilegally but we treat them as our brothers.
What happen to South Sudanese people in kenya need to me Condenmed Strongly , Kenyan Police Targetted South Sudanese who are living in kenya , They arrested them ilegally  including those who have Valid Visas Police took their documents ...
