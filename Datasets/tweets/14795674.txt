@t10nbaum Thanks!
@t10nbaum Yep.  As part of the initial hiring documents, that might make sense.
@t10nbaum if employer denies it is a fact question.  but if you can get past MTD employee can extract a settlement
@t10nbaum Need to be done in writing and countersigned if employer wants a record.
@t10nbaum That could be.
@t10nbaum Yep. It's a nationwide trend, and a great idea in my book.  No good can come of looking at someone's FB page outside of discovery

wow.  intense. RT @jonhyman: @yalechk @dbchrattorney OH has mgr and sup personal liab for discrim - so removal isvery hard #EEOChat
it has to be a qualified disability for ADA, can't imagine a qualified disability that causes employee to lash out against women #EEOChat
@ProactiveStats  P brought class claim for age discrim under NJ LAD only to avoid removal, D's removed, expect P will seek a remand #EEOChat
I just saw that in a case RT @dbchrattorney in NJ, all plaintiff atty bring only state ct claims so removal usually not possible #EEOChat
agreed RT @dbchrattorney: @CarlaIrwin if there is an at-will disclaimer, that would not suffice either I don't believe #EEOChat
RT @ProactiveStats @dbchrattorney: Equal Opportunity Bullying is not illegal harassment.  http://tinyurl.com/4nxqcof #EEOChat

@CarlaIrwin that system is already quite effective in the FLSA arena #EEOChat
@CarlaIrwin that would be my guess #EEOChat
@ProactiveStats  pro-business tilt of the court will find a way to not permit the class #EEOChat
Too much and not practical RT @ProactiveStats: Is having a policy banning employee dating/relationships the way to go?  too much? #EEOChat
Speculating that they will not RT @ProactiveStats: What do you think @yalechk - Dukes v WalMart at SCOTUS - allow the class or no? #EEOChat
it all comes down to specifically documenting poor performance and following the company's written policies #EEOChat
Agreed  RT @lancehouston:  bad performance history would have made a difference, but still not dispostive of the retaliation claim. #EEOChat
@CarlaIrwin @PhilipMiles  yes, very good points #EEOChat
@ProactiveStats yes.  which means that these types of cases could be a real mess to defend #EEOChat
@ProactiveStats this seems like an extension of the common law principle that you can't do indirectly what you can't do directly  #EEOChat
@ProactiveStats The law on retaliation, in ever scenario (whistleblower, Title VII) is very clear #EEOChat
@CarlaIrwin also a good point #EEOChat
@PhilipMiles good point #EEOChat
It seems to me that this ruling is based on a very particular , very unusual set of facts @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat
What about scenarios with same-sex couples? I wonder if you wouldn't open the door to disparate treatment issues @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat
I think doing so could create more problems than it would solve @ProactiveStats #EEOChat
and given the facts, I can't say I am surprised by the results  @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat
yes RT @ProactiveStats: one of the key issues was what American Stainless knew about Thompson/Regalado relationship and when #EEOChat

Thank YOU!  This was fun :) RT @ACIEmployment: Thank you everyone for participating  in our survey and in discussion #EEOChat  #ACIsurveys
@jonhyman Love your blawg on Gina btw :)
It's true.  I am such a nerd! RT @ProactiveStats: 9. @yalechk loves evidentiary rules :) #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
I am glad you exist @ProactiveStats because I do not want to have to do the econ/stats, but love seeing the results!  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
We have offices in DC and Virginia :) RT @HamptonCM @ProactiveStats I am the only non-lawyer, do you all have my back?  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Run to your lawyer and ask for help! RT @ProactiveStats: HA! RT @HamptonCM: @ProactiveStats  RUN! :) #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Dodd Frank gives 30% bounty--FCA like incentive to whistleblow @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
you should be!  i am too! @HamptonCM  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
the penalties get you, not the damages RT @ProactiveStats: wage and hour is an easy area for accidental violations! #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Convince your employees that you want to do the right thing so they'll report in first RT @HamptonCM: @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
False Claims Act already made healthcare a boom industry for whistleblower cases RT @ProactiveStats @HamptonCM  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
yes! RT @HamptonCM: @ProactiveStats outreach incentives 30% for EEs to report even before using internal resources #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Have good policies and procedures, which are regularly followed (and document that you follow them) #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Financial industry! RT @ProactiveStats: Are we going to see a concentration of whistleblower claims..... #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Time to develop rock-solid compliance plans  RT @HamptonCM: @yalechk whistle blower rules just expanded #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
The Dodd Frank act is full employment for lawyers RT @HamptonCM: @yalechk whistle blower rules just expanded #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Yes, especially in whistleblower context RT @ProactiveStats: Can we expect to see an increase in retaliation claims? #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Not enough to keep tourists from lining up outside of 5th ave store RT @ProactiveStats: Refusing to hire...  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
A tribunal with no evidentiary rules is a scary thing RT @andyarnold At least then subject to rules of civ pro & evidence @jonhyman #EEOChat
Yes!  I love evidentiary rules.  RT @andyarnold: At least then subject to rules of civ pro & evidence. Appealable. RT @jonhyman #EEOChat
Depends how "juicy" the facts I think RT @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Challenge is to get corporate lawyers to stop using arbitration provisions! RT @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
It is a concern, but yes, secondary RT @ProactiveStats: I know @HamptonCM  publicity aspects #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Yes!  A smart judge is always your best bet. RT @jonhyman: Instead of Arb clauses, I like jury trial waivers #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
agreed.  a real gamble that you will like the final result RT @jonhyman: Could not agree more with @gourmetlawyer #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
and finality RT @HamptonCM: @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
arbitrators more likely to "split the baby" RT @ACIEmployment: Do employers face an uphill battle in arbitration? #acisurveys # eeochat
Society needs plaintiffs and management lawyers alike :) RT @FLSALawyer: @yalechk certainly none of my clients fall within that definition.
I would never imply that they do!   @FLSALawyer: @yalechk certainly none of my clients fall within that definition.
Some arbitrators like some judges dont understand e-discovery and require very burdensome productions  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
I think many complainants know they don't have viable causes & are simply trying to get by in the recession @FLSALawyer #EEOChat #ACIsurvey
Would love to see decision in Huber @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Under $5k RT @FLSALawyer: @yalechk what do you define nominal as? #EEOChat #ACIsurvey
YES.  e-discovery settles cases RT @ProactiveStats: Are companies opting to settle rather than litigate b/c of cost #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
So many employers would rather settle these out for nominal fees than defend RT @HamptonCM  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Exactly.  RT @ProactiveStats: Agreed @yalechk - esp. in light of ADA AA, where focus is on accommodation  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Most interesting metric to me though is number of charges (or threatened charges) that are simply settled out #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Personally I think it's easier for aging working to prevail on ADA than ADEA #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Some think Gross has not had any appreciable difference in ADEA cases  http://bit.ly/9RaNln RT @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Yes.  I suspect many charges are simply being settled RT @GourmetLawyer @HamptonCM  #acisurveys #eeochat
Aging lawyers also have more health problems RT @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Both on ADA and ADEA front RT @ProactiveStats: The aging population is going to present a lot of challenges  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
I am very sympathetic to their situation, to be honest, i think ADEA violations ARE out there RT @HamptonCM:  #acisurveys #eeochat
Okay, so we understood surveys the same RT @jonhyman: @yalechk Rate of growth slowing - number of claims still rising #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
They are running out of options and have no choice but to sue--they can't get hired anywhere @ACIEmployment  #acisurveys #eeochat
ADEA will be a continuing issue, aging baby-boomers disproportionately hit my recession @ACIEmployment  #acisurveys #eeochat
and i think plaintiffs lawyers will bring both discrimination claims and pay equity claims @HamptonCM  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Other surveys are showing recession had disparate impact on women and minorities @HamptonCM: @ProactiveStats   #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Are you talking rate of growth?  Fulbright also found discrimination claims were on the rise @jonhyman #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
and therefore risk remains outstanding @yalechk: State agencies do not have resources .... @ProactiveStats:  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
State agencies do not have resources to quickly determine complaints  @ProactiveStats:  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Much easier to make a claim under many state laws (like NY Human Relations Law) RT @ProactiveStats #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Dramatic .  And state wage payment increase risk even more RT @HamptonCM: @ACIEmployment  #acisurveys #eeochat
So easy to extract a settlement from employer if no in-house legal dept able to defend these claims  RT @HamptonCM #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
No easy way to dispose of in summary manner RT @HamptonCM: @HamptonCM  I see accommodation as big #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Yes.  I think that is in large part because it is fact-sensitive RT @HamptonCM: @HamptonCM  I see accommodation as big #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Agreed.  HR professionals are rightfully worried about the new ADA EOs RT @HamptonCM: @yalechk   #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
I have seen a big increase myself, especially using state and local discrimination laws @HamptonCM @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
Do you agree that the volume of discrimination litigation will continue to increase? @HamptonCM @ProactiveStats  #EEOChat #ACIsurveys
The survey results are very interesting for management-side lawyers @ProactiveStats  #ACIsurveys #EEOChat

@Scobleizer Just because FB CAN do what it has w/r/t privacy doesn't mean it should-FB's profit motivation makes sense for FB but not for me
@Scobleizer FB is the only true supplier in its market---it should know better than to enforce a contract of adhesion onto all w/profiles
@steigerlaw  Ethics, anyone?  That behavior should not be tolerated of any party
@princeboucher  While they are obviously (and rightfully) trying to monetize their assets, I think the opt-out method is problematic
@princeboucher  And FB is, at this moment, a contract of adhesion--there are no reasonable alternatives.
@princeboucher I think that FB's new settings are very much like the old, mis-guided Beacon
@princeboucher I am very worried about the new FB  privacy settings.  It is absurd that they can make your info public as the default.
