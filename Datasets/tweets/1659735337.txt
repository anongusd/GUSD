You really should try reading a book or something sometimes and stop watching Fox News! It’s ok I’m sure you’ll have a long illustrious career at Walmart etc! Have fun supporting your fake Russian President!
@con_american @CNN What she’s saying worked for years in America and would work again the only ones against it are the super rich who would have to pay more taxes
@con_american @CNN She’s actually pretty well educated with degrees in economics and foreign relations, what was your major?
@skynnergoin @ScottDungan1 @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr All I did was respond with a accurate answer to a post....but according to you and sky I’m a douche,moron etc etc lmao like I really care what y’all think your both completely out of touch with reality!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Y’all make a assumption that I’m a liberal and I’m not! I’m sure you think I like Hillary as well guess what I don’t like her either!! There plenty of democrats,liberals and definitely republicans I want nothing to do with as well!
@ScottDungan1 @Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr Congressman Cummings said they will be open a investigation into that and has requested information from the Whitehorse regarding security clearances of individuals, finally some oversight like there’s supposed to be!
@markken26158113 @richardkerris @paulkent @senatemajldr They’re high paying job that pay the same or better than with a degree they just require manual labor and hours most are willing to do or perform!
@markken26158113 @richardkerris @paulkent @senatemajldr I agree wages should go up but I managed to do it so could others if they want it bad enough did I like it no was I exhausted yes but was it worth it to provide a good life for my family and kids YES ABSOLUTELY!
@ScottDungan1 @Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr Yeah that’s what he’s saying 🤔I don’t know where they get this shit lmao must be nice to live in a fantasy world where everything is however you say it is would definitely make life easier!
@Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Aww the two trump lovers are liking each other’s posts bet y’all are playing footsies with each other too...don’t forget to be safe guys!
@ScottDungan1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr Skylink says everything is a commie agenda etc but has yet to explain how he defined commie, I don’t think he know he’s just grabbed that and applies it to any and everything he dislikes!
@ScottDungan1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr They’re right and we’re brainwashed idiots according to them it’s a inflection of themselves they’re trying to project their own weakness and falsities onto anyone who disagrees with them or has a differing opinion or viewpoint!
@ScottDungan1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr It’s the only thing they’ve got hard to argue with facts! So they spin,deflect and attack the individual instead of the issue! Trump 101 same thing he does!
@ScottDungan1 @skynnergoin @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr Scott walk away lmao I should have done the same but didn’t 🤦‍♂️ they’re just like trump illogical and out of touch with reality there’s no changing it!
@Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Says the believers of alternative facts lmao whenever they can’t disprove a real fact same old song and dance.....
@Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr As usual when you can’t dispute something that’s factual then its the old deflect by attacking the person not the facts and calling them names lol you and all the trumppers are just like him! Ron White said it best “you can’t fix stupid”
@ScottDungan1 @Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr He’s talking to me trying to discredit accurate statistics that were posted! He’s a idiot don’t waste your time!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr For the rich and corporations!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr No I actually read and form my own opinions based on facts and my interpretations! A more accurate phrase it’s I’m realistic if you think he republicans care about middle class your sorely mistaken! They’re all politicians and all have done some stupid shit but republicans are
@Skylinksteve1 @skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Bullshit that’s on bush! Eight years of him and Wall Street for bundling junk! Which is why there were laws passed to prevent that happening again which trump repealed as soon as taking office!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Deflecting as usual can’t accept the facts only alternative facts....
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr They’ve varied and he’s done nothing it s the same it’s been growing since before he took office!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr There’s no justification there that’s why you say that! He’s a hypocrite and pathological liar simple as that!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Going=young damn autocorrect
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr My kids are grown lol but I’m going at heart does that count?😉
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr I had kids 15 yrs ago lmao 😂 nice try though they’re from 2016
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Latest reports shows jobs decreased in 2018
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Well he inherited a recession caused by bush and the republicans so the first few years yes but the growth has been steady and constant since! Statistics don’t lie and aren’t alternative facts....
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr No he didn’t 154 out of 365 days think about that! Remember trump blasting Obama over golf? Remember him saying “ I’ll be working and won’t ever have time to play golf” he’s a conman world class at that! George Carlin said it best “ it’s all lies and bullshit folks”!

@skynnergoin @Skylinksteve1 @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr They don’t have to worry about a medical emergency bankrupting them like average American because insurance won’t even cover so much! And they all say they have no issue being seen and treated when they need to especially pertaining to quality of health procedures not cosmetic
@skynnergoin @Skylinksteve1 @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Yes I have friends from England too both say they would wish our system on anyone!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr What about Liam they’re not currently president lol there’s proof out there look the real estate history and transactions! Don’t worry it’ll come out you’ll see! Especially once the house gets his taxes!
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Umm it’s public record and was requested under freedom of information act! You realize in November he’s played golf 154 times that we know of all on his own property in less than two years in office?!? Obama golf 306 in 8yrs for comparison 🤷‍♂️
@skynnergoin @OhMilkSteak @Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Congress didn’t commit to the American people that they would! Trump did and hasn’t! And I’d be open to Congress doing it too! Why is it always but what about so and so why isn’t it ever the main question of why hasn’t trump done what he said he would?
@skynnergoin @Skylinksteve1 @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Who gets surgery first is based on need and not who can pay so the sickest people get served first etc kinda makes sense when you think about it!
@skynnergoin @Skylinksteve1 @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr They have no problem being seen when they need to and don’t have to worry about getting unexpected huge bills afterwards! Our system sucks!
@skynnergoin @Skylinksteve1 @OhMilkSteak @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Actually if you talk to people in England and Canada they’re not waiting for anything that’s life saving etc the only wait would be for elective surgery! Were already paying for it but not getting it as it is! It works for all these other countries and costs far less then ours!
@realDonaldTrump  where’s this fabled 10% middle class tax cut we’re getting it’s been @90days thought it was going to happen right after midterms! Dems won’t stop middle class cuts so can’t blame them! https://t.co/fVfG5mIpyB
@DeplorableKings @renato_mariotti Along with gerrymandering PA and NC voting districts.....
@1HappyWifey1 @renato_mariotti He can’t say do it legally when he’s trying to take the legal avenues they have to do it away!That will just increase illegal immigration because they’re left no option to achieve it legally!It’s a big catch 22 and he knows it so does miller!#AmericaisImmigration #meltingpot
@1HappyWifey1 @renato_mariotti But your wrong he is against people coming into the country legally which is why he keeps trying to severely reduce and limit legal immigration laws! He has also not followed law at the border and isn’t allowing people to claim asylum like our laws state they can!
@RaymondTori @renato_mariotti He can’t use funds desigagnated for the military for anything else without congressional approval!you don’t have wait 36 days to declare a national emergency or crisis this is a joke!complete abuse of power by declaring a emergency that’s not real to further political goal!
@ScottDungan1 @PamHesse @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr Your wasting your time! There is no way use reason or logic with people who are the antithesis of unreasonable/illogical only thing that might and it’s a big might work is if he’s actually indicated etc and found guilty! Even then they’ll defend him most likely🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️.......

@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Also they’re not allowing people to do it legally they’re legally allowed to apply for asylum under US law and trump is doing everything he can to prevent them from legally applying and following the law!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr That’s hard to do when they’re trying to make major changes to legal immigration that severely reduces all ways to do it legally! There were major changes in the “compromise” he just offered it wasn’t just DACA and tps it also severely limited and charged legal immigration too!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Our country has always been a safe haven for the people wanting a better life  it’s the American dream to so many and many have had that dream become reality our diversity is what makes us better and stronger! It’s what America has always been about! A lighthouse in the storm!
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Nah he’s too busy massaging the back of your throat and getting rim jobs from you! You shouldn’t have done such a good job!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Give us your tired your poor your weary! No problem when it was Irish Paul Ryan actually tried to increase Irish immigration before leaving office! We are a nation of immigrants a melting pot you take that away and it’s not America
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Poor countries with majority of the population that is not white.
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr No show us who he is loud and clear
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Real estate mogul who had how many bankruptcies leaving small businesses etc holding the bag! How many did he not pay or had to sue to get just pay for work done? Do some research! How about the dodging inheritance tax scam
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Nope he’s been that way all his life there’s reported tapes of him say racist things on apprentice! How about the Central Park four front page add in the eighties? Everyone who actually knows him in NY says he’s a bigot and racist among other things and not all there!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Who decided the merits accepted? Who benefits from that certainly not the poor or ethnic majority countries! Example travel ban did not include Saudi Arabia when how many 9/11 terrorist were from there but included counties that no known terrorist had come from!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr In less than a year when there a minimum three years to gain citizenship
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You mean the one Melania’s parents just recently received citizenship through?
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr They want to severely limit the immigration from ethnic countries which is the same thing
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Hey you’ll be at the right level won’t have to wear knee pads
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Commie this commie that define commie to you!

@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr And what do you define commie as just curious?
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Maybe he’ll let you be one of his midget clown entourage!
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Cool you pay for it! The majority of Americans don’t want their tax dollars spent on a wall!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr They’re trying to severely curtail and limit legal immigration! That’s one the goals haven’t you heard what they’ve proposed?
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr He’s said it along with many other racist things! I mean are we just supposed to ignore the things he says?

@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr A lot do and government worker are qualified to those jobs right?!? Some of those may be here legally you don’t know they’re not! And for anyone who supports trump to say anything about talking out their ass is a complete oxymoron!

He said it but guess what he Nordic countries have it much better then here they don’t want to have to worry about expensive health insurance, medical bills etc
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Districts as the courts have ruled repeatedly and constantly try to oppress the minority votes of citizens! They don’t want black or brown people voting since most won’t vote for them which is why they do these things!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Bullshit you have to be a citizen to vote and show id along with being registered!  And most Democrats say they’re against open border! Remember the voter fraud commission trump started then ended and we never heard anything else about wonder why?! Republicans gerrymander the
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Don’t think trump has a chance in hell of reelection!
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr So rather bad brown me are all the problems in our country!?!  What’s it supposed to be like? Most illegals come on a visa and overstay not cross the border illegal! They say ignorance is bliss y’all must have blissful lives!
@Skylinksteve1 @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr haha sure picking tomatoes right?How about you ask trump why 90+percent of the people working in his clubs are on work visas or illegals!Because you can pay them less then a American will do the same job for and don’t have to treat them as well either!! Government should be open!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr I do trumps a pos lying conman don’t like Hillary either didn’t vote for either one! Refused vote for anyone I didn’t like picking the lesser of two evils isn’t a good choice either way!

@PamHesse @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr They’ve provided 8bills he’s one that’s junk! McConnell needs to allow votes and then he can veto if they’re not veto proof that’s how it’s supposed to work!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Temporary concessions that he took away to begin with along with permanent major changes to legal immigration is not going to work nor is that negotiating!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr No 5 billion this year for one year and changing permanently legal immigration no thanks!The wall will still cost over 25 billion total! Open borders is bs they’re not worried about Canada oh yeah they’re white up there!And they’ve actually caught terrorist trying to enter fromCN
@USMCVet4Trump @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Nope your wrong stop drinking the Trumpaide! That or your lying too you do support a pathological liar! So 1.6 billion for border security doesn’t have border funding? The original amount requested before Trump got his feeling hurt my Coulter,Limbaugh etc!! Last added billion 2.3
@skynnergoin @ElisaDoucet3 @ScottDungan1 @senatemajldr Inspecting facilities that process or food!!

@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr 2 With help from Russia according to our intelligence agencies!yes he talked about how Mexico would pay not the middle class so much for the great deal maker! He’s alienated us with our allies and kissed up to how many dictators and authoritarians?!? He’s doesn’t understand how
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr 1He wasn’t interested in actually doing something about it till the house switched or he would have!!

@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You can’t claim to be for security out the right side of your mouth and then command things that put it at risk out the left that’s hypocrisy!! He said he would be “proud to shut down the government” and obviously is regardless of increased national security risk its causing!!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Suddenly it is now and he’s full of shit!! Right now due to shutdown national security is at risk and he’s not concerned and reopening the government it’s about ego and his campaign promise to his base!! Open the rest of government then debate and compromise on border security!!!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr No it’s  not a waste because it’s his responsibility to veto them not Mitch’s to withhold! Mitch knows that most likely they’d have a veto proof vote and that’s exactly why he will not allow the vote!! Southern border wasn’t a issue. Last two years while republicans controlled?!
@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Obama didn’t promise Mexico would pay and then take the federal workers hostage to try and extort the tax payers into paying for it because he lied! And he was offered 25 billion for DACA a year ago and turned it down! House has sent multiple bills McConnell shouldbringto floor!!

@shimjelly @powersj_tx @GOP American citizens private property away against their will!

Because there’s better technology
@shimjelly @powersj_tx @GOP But that’s not what they’re doing because it’s pretty hard to transport tons of product through desert wilderness!! The majority comes through points of entry which is why better technology and more agents are needed! Not a wall that’s ineffective,a waste of money and takes

@USMCVet4Trump @milliebro @GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Mitch is abdicating his duty of office! It’s not his job his job is to bring bills for vote then trump can veto if he wants but he knows they’ll be veto proof so he won’t allow vote that will open government against trumps wishes!

@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Cohens story has only changed once he stopped lying for trump! And they seized all the documents, recordings and emails from Cohens office under a search warrant that is also being used to verify and prove these things hence the audio recording of trump that is so incriminating!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein To hide what they did and the denials until it came to light and couldn’t be denied any longer show intent and that they knew full well it was wrong and illegal when they committed the actions now they’re going to have to answer for them!!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein So is trump and his friend jefferey Epstein what’s your point?!?! Bottom line is if you don’t want to be held accountable for breaking the law don’t break it!! Don’t want to be held accountable for perjury then don’t lie! It’s really that easy and simple! And the way they tried
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein There’s a audio recording of him and trump talking about it he made before any of this or the investigations started!! No was impeached by the house! That’s not a pass! Your in denial!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Doesn’t make it untrue it just shows your inability to understand the facts and blind allegiance to Trump!!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein You keep saying my interpretation this is what they’ve stated due to evidence and lawyers reviewing it! It’s not my opinion it’s what lawyers have said that know the law and do this for a living! Your president committed felonies with Cohen as accessory is that simple! Denying it
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein In the court records he gave polling numbers to a Russian intelligence person as trumps campaign manager! All illegal activities uncovered by special counsel are illegal and punishable in court whether directly tied to Russia! Don’t want to do the time don’t commit crimes!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Your opinion isn’t the same a the laws definition it was and its illegal! And he has the right and duty to investigate all other crimes uncovered in the course of investigation! Not look the other way since it’s not directly tied to Russia and Manafort has proven the. Russia ties

@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein And suborning perjury is if you coach them on there testimony or try to alter it or keep them from testimony! Dude he broke the law it’s not the first time either it is what it is there no changing it now! Trumps no saint why do you think NY is also investigating him? And pence
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein She signed a NDA with David Dennison not Donald trump read the entire nda from work it specifies who the other party is your agreeing not to discuss and they most likely sign after you! No witnesss signature that you signed yourself? I personally would never sign one but that me!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein I’ve explained it to you in detail and you either won’t accept it or are not intelligent to understand the law which it’s it?!? You’ll see eventually everything is going to be crystal clear when mueller finishes! We’ll know exactly what did and didn’t happen and what was illegal
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein It’s not perjury unless he’s lying if he’s telling the truth then it’s not illegal!Just like there’s no perjury trap trump can’t be charged with perjury unless he willfully lies under oath orspecial counsel!Which he does constantly that’s whythey wouldn’t let him talk to mueller
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein No that’s lawyers interpretation! They broke the law simple why do you find that so hard to accept!?!? So you want the $500 bet? Are you a lawyer?!? And no he’s being prosecuted for lying to Congress about trump during the campaign and also plead guilty to violating campaign law
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein $500? How confident are you that your correct?!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein And I promise you it is illegal! Want bet on it! $500 that it was a violation the way they did it!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein That has nothing to do with what he did they broke federal campaign laws! Just because someone else breaks the laws doesn’t excuse to justify you or I breaking them!
@KnightBLKRifle @mikewickett @GOP @realDonaldTrump Correct autocorrect changed it and I didn’t catch it!🤦‍♂️
@blue_whiteand @KnightBLKRifle @mikewickett @GOP @realDonaldTrump Correct autocorrect changed it and I didn’t even catch it! 🤦‍♂️
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein And lawyer client confidentiality does not apply when crime is committed! He never signed the NDA therefore the contract of the NDA was never finalized legally! He did to himself trying to hide it and broke the law simple as that!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Multiple times when he said he knew nothing about the payments to the women or enquirer to hush them up! There’s a recording Cohen made before he said this multiple times where they’re discussing the payments he was aware and lied to the American people about them repeatedly!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Doesn’t matter is he used campaign funds legally it is classified as a campaign donation because of the way they did it trying to hide it from reporting like the law requires! Read the laws it was illegal and both women’s payments constitute a federal felony committed!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein It was against the law they did it through a shell company which means it was considered a in kind campaign donation!It was also much larger than the maximum allowable donation!What they did violates federal campaign finance laws!Multiple times it’s a minimum of 2 felonies!

@chloehanks59 @nightOwlbookLvr @DevinNunes More agents, drone surveillance, infrared cameras, better technology at ports of entry where 90%+ of drugs come in the country is what will make the most difference and they’re willing to fund them.
@chloehanks59 @nightOwlbookLvr @DevinNunes The majority do NOT want the wall funded with taxpayers money! And they’ve sent multiple bills to McConnell who refuses to bring them to the floor for a vote!

@AdamSerwer That is one of the most upsetting,disturbing anddisrespectful things I’ve seen in quite sometime!This is NOT how you make America great!Trump is emboldening hatred,division and discord as this clearly demonstrates!The chaperones who allowed this as well as kids should be ashamed
@AustinScottGA08 @HouseGOP @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS You mean like McConnell is denying the right to vote on the bills to reopen the government that will pass and already have?!?? What a hypocritical thing to say but not the least surprising coming from republicans!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why not have McConnell bring the bills he’s been sitting on for a week and reopen the government! That would be a great start and show good faith to start negotiations as well as helping all the people out of work and not getting paid be able to pay their bills! Ransom is wrong!

@WhiteHouse @GOP @realDonaldTrump Ok so make the first step reopening our government and let the workers get back to work! Then negotiating can begin as you’ve been told numerous times! Extortion isn’t a good look or way to get what you want!
@LindseyGrahamSC They already have protection from the courts and the Supreme Court has indicated they are not going to take up the case to change that so what is he offering? Nothing how about a path to citizenship, maybe one that takes less than a year like Melania’s parents sonhow received!

@noshedsparry @chanley55 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Look I’ve enjoyed talking to you and I get on Twitter throughout the day but it’s not my primary life focus and shouldn’t be yours either. We have different opinions and are both entitled to them. Again have a nice weekend!
@noshedsparry @chanley55 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump In legal ease if they wanted to say it was made up or untruthful they would have stated that specifically and they didn’t. This was saying the information buzz feed reported didn’t come from them or their documents or records
@noshedsparry @chanley55 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Of the special counsel office information
@noshedsparry @chanley55 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump From office of SDNY he’s saying that the info didn’t come from his office and the characterization of the info are not an accurate description of information from his office. He in no way said it was made up or that there was no truth at all just it’s not a accurate reflection
@noshedsparry @chanley55 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump They didnt say made up they said that the description of specific statements to special counsel were not accurate and the characterization of documents and testimony obtained by “his”office were not accurate regarding congressional testimony.

@rkduet45 @Royaldame1 @DanimalHarris @halljrer @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi I do watch multiple credible news stations but Fox isn’t credible so I don’t watch them! My information is diverse and watching Fox for entertainment is one thing but not for accurate and factual new reporting! We all have a right to our opinions not trying to say you don’t!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein Hope I explained it I tried to in detail to answe your question Miguel.
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/7 been publicly known hence the only reason to do what he did was to purposely try to hide them and what they were for from the public right before  the election due to the negative publicity he would have gotten that could have effected people voting for him.
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/6 to keep information out of the public that could have effected the results of a federal election they were running in. See the difference? Big difference in the two! The only reason he didn’t do it legal was he would have had to disclose the payments and they would have
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/5 Obama’s fine was for failing to report donations by a deadline. They did report 100% of donations but were late in reporting some which was why they were fined rightly so. They didn’t try to hide donations,fail to report donations or use what is classified as a donation
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/4 paid them directly himself then he would have been 100% legal in his actions and there wouldn’t be any issues aside from moral standpoint which isn’t breaking any laws. He could have done it legally and chose not to and took a illegal route IDK why he did that but he did!
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/3 the payment per say isn’t what is he issue it’s how and who paid in the attempt to hide it is where he ran afoul of the law. As well as illegal to pay monies in a attempt to affect the election in either direction is also not legal! But if he’d has them sign NDA in 2014 and
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/2 which is why it was done week before not years before which is also against federal election laws. If he’s paid himself and declared it in his finance declaration then he would have done nothing wrong as far as it being a donation because it wouldn’t have been in then.
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein 1/1 No it would be private if he’d initially paid himself being that someone else did it’s consider in kind donation subject to campaign finance laws. Completely different circumstances than what Obama paid a fine for! He hide it in a attempt to keep it from affecting election

He’d be clear
@MiguelAGonzle15 @SharonLaurel @SenFeinstein No it violates campaign finance laws due the fact that Cohen paid them and was reimbursed its considered a donation which is illegal! It’s also illegal to use said donation to suppress information that could influence elsection results! There are a minimum of two federal felonies

@Dan_Brush1 @SenSchumer Why didn’t the republicans fund the wall while they controlled house and senate?!? Why did it not become a crisis until Democrats were controlling the house?!? Because they knew it was a inefficient waste of money and he would have had to call them the bad guys over not funding!
@Dan_Brush1 @SenSchumer Big difference between selected areas of fencing and the entire border let’s make sure to include facts not alternative facts! Trumps the one talking about bypassing the constitution And abusing power to get something the majority of Americans have made clear they do NOT want!
@Dan_Brush1 @SenSchumer Fact Trump has lied more than any other president in history! He continues to lie without regard or remorse the the American people daily about any and everything! Just because you repeat something doesn’t make it true! His lies have been proven multiple times by multiple sources
@Dan_Brush1 @SenSchumer Umm Trump has played golf more in two years than Obama did in eight years! He’s golced through @25% of his terms!Not misinformation actual true facts that have legitimate data to back them! Not alternative facts or the truth isn’t the truth like the trump administration prefers!

@GOP @PressSec If gop wanted him to have his wall you would have made it happen the two years that you controlled the senate and house but obviously it wasn’t a priority like your tax scam etc was! If y’all cared about border security why didn’t you address it first or before you lost the house

@StrikeNational @caborradaileho1 @SenatorDurbin As long as tax payers aren’t footing the bill I don’t care to be honest, but we both know no one else is going to pick up the tab either so it’s a mute argument....
@GOP @KellyannePolls Here’s the thing when your administration lies all the time no one can believe its facts or figures! And when has Trump or anyone in his administration ever exhibited courtesy or dignity?!?
@GOP @KellyannePolls #trailerparkbarbie she lies just as much as her boss!
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne You have to act like a hero to be one! Hero’s don’t lie,cheat and steal which is all you’ve done all your life! Such a embarrassment for our country can’t wait for Mueller and all the other investigations to take you down!! #trumpcrimefamily
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Was really telling when none of the GOP clapped after Nancy Pelosi quoted Ronald Reagan at her speech today too! Purely partisan and in no way interested in what’s best for our country! Wasn’t the same people who were complaining about Trump not getting clapped for?!? #GOPsucks
@GOP @realDonaldTrump So you support taking American citizens land against their will to build a wall that they don’t want and then on top of it making them (American citizens) pick up the bill and pay for the wall! Sounds like a free country to me how about y’all?!? #MexicoWillPayForTheWall
@SenatorDurbin McConnell swore a oath the American people and our Constitution! Not Trump he need to do his job and put the bills on the floor and let them get voted on! What he’s doing is gross dereliction of his duty and the oaths he swore a member of the US Senate! Stop being Trumps minion!
@SenatorDurbin No one has a issue with him building his wall as long as it’s not with taxpayers money! He campaigned on Mexico paying for the wall so if he wants to keep his promise then he needs to get them to pay for it! Not shift the cost to the USA because he was lying during his campaign!
WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY READING THIS IS SCARY CAN SOMEONE PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! #25thThe45th #25thamendmemt. 36 wackiest lines from Donald Trump's totally bizarre Cabinet meeting - CNN Politics https://t.co/rFxNslmx5q

@realDonaldTrump Well you better get on the phone with Mexico and get them to pay for it like you promised! Habla Espanol senor!

@Banzai187 @antoniosc79 @brmilo96 Shit=shut
@Banzai187 @antoniosc79 @brmilo96 This is his third shutdown by the way! According to him when Obama was in office “any shit down is the fault of the top person in charge the president” Trump said the same at the time “he should be fired” it’s ok friend I’d be upset to if I’d allowed him to con me too🙂
@Banzai187 @antoniosc79 @brmilo96 15 lies per day average to the American people,trade wars, crashing economy, lost world respect, violation of constitutional emoluments clause and I’m sure I’m missing more than a few! Oh and “who’s going the pay for the wall....MEXICO” I’m not a hypocrite just realistic....
@iamIVANGVICTOR @CNN Because they live in the real world and not in a fantasy world inside his head! What pint of view is that? His changes from hour to hour, day to day depending on what lies he’s spewing out of his mouth! #IdiotInChief #nationalembarassment #ImpeachtrumpsavetheUSA #liarinchief
@antoniosc79 @brmilo96 @Banzai187 Then maybe they should direct their ire at the person and party who is responsible for them not getting their checks! Trump owns this shutdown along with all the republicans that enable him and refuse to acknowledge the fact that he is destroying our country! #ImpeachTrump
@CNN I hope they stick to this 100% on this!Our citizens and country are depending on them and their oversight which is in dire need of after the house GOP abdication of their oaths,responsibilities and principals over the last two years!

@CNN McConnell swore a oath to the American people and our constitution not to Trump and needs to stop with partisan politics and do his job! He’s allowing the executive branch to control the senate and failing to be a co-equal branch of government like our constitution provides!
@CNN Because McConnell will not being anything to the floor that isn’t exactly what Trump wants he’s being subservient instead of doing the job he swore a oath to do! He’s afraid it might get enough votes to be veto proof and then Trump will attack him personally for it!

@GOP An average of 15 lies per day in the year 2018 from President Trump! He promised to release his tax returns if elected how about keeping that promise? No promises made were kept everything he says is a lie or complete fabrication from the fantasy world he lives in! #impeachtrump

@realDonaldTrump More lies you can’t stop can you?!? There has been no new wall built out of your wall you campaigned on your lying when you say otherwise! You haven’t even spent the all the money you were already given for border security previous years but want more! #liarinchief #trumpresign
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN He had inseminated since he did it himself and kept track of which sire line he would use to breed them.
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN He checked them with his hand up there ass about shoulder deep to be clear just so you’ll know how he checked them 🙄 never took part in that left it to him but he could tell in less than a minute or so if they were successfully breed or not, and he knew exactly which numbers
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN Well if I never saw any go to slaughter then there’s your answer. He did AI breeding and checked for conception himself in intervals after breeding all confirmed pregnant were recorded by their identifying number and kept on a list. So there was a record of all pregnant cows.
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN Never said none were pregnant if you actually read what was written I said I helped deliver calves which would indicate they were pregnant would it not? But I never saw any sent to slaughter while I worked there and only saw one die that was old.
@Reuters To each their own I personally don’t find it appealing but I’m sure there’s plenty who do....good for her for being completely comfortable and confident in herself! Best wishes for success!
@SenSchumer Congratulations
@realDonaldTrump Just wait until the investigations start showing the American people all the shady things your administration has done in the last two years that the republicans refused to investigate! Tick tock tick tock you think you look bad now you ain’t seen nothing yet old man 😂😂😂

@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN Just what I saw on one man’s farm in my time there can’t say what takes place in the thousands of others nationwide. But he was very much insistent that his cattle be treated as well as possible and I did what he asked while working there.
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN He absolutely had to I remember him and I helping deliver many a calf where cow was having difficulty delivering some multiple years on same cow but he didn’t ship her off unless it was unavoidable.
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN For years he would treat them and took care of his cattle well. Not saying he never sent them to slaughter house just was rare and not during my time there that I can recall. Probably different on larger operations or with younger operators he preferred to not send them unless
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN We had very few injuries and treated any mastitis and there were a few prolapse issues on a couple cattle but I can’t recall any being sent to the slaughter house for it. Can only remember having one dead cow there too. Was a 200 head farm run by a old man who had been doing it
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN Maybe some farmer do things differently the one I worked for did anyways...
@JoeHeim @washingtonpost @LibertyU Blind faith in a man from a supposed man of god.....why am I not surprised look at how much his father and himself have enriched themselves personally in the name of their god! He’s a fraud just like his father and Trump #birdsoffeatherflocktogeher
@SimcoeIs @Cole1971Ger @CNN Worked on a diary farmans I’ve never heard of this, the calf are kept and raised females for milking males sold off for 4h or individuals to raise for beef.
@realDonaldTrump They’ve given you two pick one and you’ve got a deal! See it’s that easy, getting everything you want while holding hard working Americans pay hostage it’s making a deal it’s extortion for all intents! Should have took the 25billion for daca when you had the chance! #nowallnoway
@realDonaldTrump The only thing that’s been proven if that everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie! You repeatedly lie to the American people about any and everything with no remorse or restraint! That’s what has and is continually being proven over and over again!

@RDodolak @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @VP Negotiations aren’t your going to give me everything I want or I’m going to hold hard working American federal workers paychecks hostage that’s not negotiating it’s more along the lines of extortion!

@Anne03181 @RDodolak @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @VP Correction they added it at the last minute after trump changed the already agreed upon terms because of Fox News and others criticism.

@GOP @DonaldJTrumpJr How has he helped? He’s not a public office holder or anything else all he does is run trumps business as a figurehead and help violate the emoluments clause! But I can see where that would be considered great by the GOP just like the tax plan for the rich that’s added trillions

He’s so against immigration but hires 90%+ immigrants to work at his properties some legal some not it’s all a con he’s perfectly fine with having them here
@IsleofAvolon @dscranester @SenatorDurbin No it was trump who walked away from a full 30 billion and tried to renegotiate and add additional terms as stated. The White House said no too to a full finding offer in exchange for daca which is 100%  caused by them....
@dscranester @IsleofAvolon @SenatorDurbin Nothing to hash out I’ve got no issue with providing he details and giving 100% of the picture others want to only spout what benefits their point of view! Right is right wrong is wrong regardless of what the political party perpetrating it is I just call it as I see it!
@dscranester @IsleofAvolon @SenatorDurbin Said no because he also wanted to severely limit legal immigration as well as  make major changes to the entire legal immigration system let’s not leave those important details out! Like I said earlier he was offered 30 billion for DACA straight trade and he said no and balked
@dscranester @SenatorDurbin They tried that earlier this year offered the full 30 billion for DACA and its was a no trump said no! Stephen Miller/Trump then wanted to cut legal immigration 50% among other thing in addition the the wall.....
@jefferyclark @cridings1 @SenatorDurbin Ummm Paul Ryan should have brought the CR to the floor for a vote which would have passed most likely but didn’t in his trying to appease trump

@realDonaldTrump How’s that going to happen? You couldn’t even get GM to not close a plant 😂 this is just another tantrum from the toddler in chief #trumpshutdown #democratoversightis coming
@realDonaldTrump Finish? You haven’t even started it yet Stop lying about everything!
@realDonaldTrump Do now your going to default on your trade agreement with them? Is anything you do ever real or true?
@realDonaldTrump And what happened to Mexico paying for it? Oh yeah just another one of your many lies!
@realDonaldTrump Your the only obstruction this country needs to change #resignorimpeach
@realDonaldTrump This coming from the person who employs @90% immigrants at his properties and as we know employs known illegal immigrants in NJ as well as others I’m sure.....why not hire all Americans at Crap a lago and the others Goober?
@realDonaldTrump Let’s see you played a part in violating military rules....blatantly lied to them about the amount AND the frequency of their pay raises to try and make yourself look good...and you lie about everything but aren’t about bringing hats right? Please you know y’all have them out!!!
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpPutinspuppet
@realDonaldTrump Your the only foreign actor! #Trump=Putinspuppet
@realDonaldTrump “Mexico is going to pay for it” and no they’ve said they would give funding for increases agents etc just not a wall! Just more of your lies and propaganda which you endlessly spew 🤮, you calling anyone or thing stupid is hilarious 😂 #TrumpsShutdown #jokeofapresident
@joe_nca @Quapante54 @spiritdancer17 @realDonaldTrump No it’s about a monument to himself and fleecing the government out of money for big business and him getting kickbacks
@realDonaldTrump The two years thru controlled all three branches either because it’s a waste of money and won’t work!!
@realDonaldTrump Have you realized that you said Mexico was going to pay for it and that the taxpayers shouldn’t have to? That it’s wrong to hold the government hostage to make it pay for your campaign promise that was a blatant lie all along!  And news flash the republicans didn’t fund it

@realDonaldTrump And the president doesn’t award contracts goober! They are bid on by approved contractors! LMAO You sure your not made of wood?We already know you have no heart!!
@realDonaldTrump YOU ARE LYING!!!🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
@realDonaldTrump You didn’t have to be there if you’d not acted like a spoiled child you wouldn’t be! You had the full 25 billion offered earlier this year and you walked away like a dummy!! Now your not getting any of it!!
@realDonaldTrump Define most productive, if you mean screwing the American people than ok I’ll buy that one!
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan This just in Vladimir Putin has given his word that his country wil now be a “real democracy” is he says it he must be telling the truth🙄
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump Never pass the senate so what’s the point
@realDonaldTrump Wake up people it’s not to keep people out it’s a monument to himself!! Not to mention it’ll also keep anyone from leaving unless allowed to leave....
@realDonaldTrump Quality healthcare provided by the government to all citizens should be a much higher priority than a wall! You know like all the other first world countries provide for their citizens!!! Only here does someone run the risk of losing everything they’ve worked all their life for..
@dsftrinity @realDonaldTrump What happened to Mexico paying? I could care less if there’s a wall built....as long as the U.S ( taxpayers) aren’t the ones getting stuck paying for it.....
@realDonaldTrump Trump is going to ruin our country and stockmarket just like he has all his businesses don’t be surprised when it happens it’s happening now!! I mean he bankrupted a casino for fucks sake!!! How is that even possible??!!
@realDonaldTrump So your willing to let all those hardworking government employees go without pay during the holidays to improve your political career and odds of reelection? Doesn’t get anymore selfish than that! Who cares about the people and their hardships as long as Trump looks good!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe it’ll help you or your family once they’re convicted!😂😂
@realDonaldTrump Never in the history of our country has a president been more unethical or dishonest than the current one today!! Thank you to the real news organizations that are working to make sure that Americans know!!
@realDonaldTrump Let’s see how serious republicans are about protecting pre existing conditions of Americans now........
@realDonaldTrump You said Tuesday on national television that you would be the one responsible for the shutdown! I believe you said you’d be proud of it as well!!! Can’t blame it on them when you went on national tv and said you owned the shutdown should it take place! #Trumpshutdown2018
@realDonaldTrump You calling someone else a hippocrite is amusing especially coming from a hippocritical pathological liar who lives in his own little fantasy world! How’s the weather in Trumpland today comrade Trump?
@realDonaldTrump Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
@realDonaldTrump Fun fact just because you say it doesn’t make it true! Wonder how many recordings he has/had of you talking to him about this and how to hide it etc etc so it wouldn’t affect the election.....
@realDonaldTrump That was their money we owed them and repayed how many decades later, can your large brain not comprehend that!?!? Then again your used to taking people’s money more so than repaying it based on bankruptcy history....
@realDonaldTrump A private transaction huh one that you said never took place!! Everyone can see it definitely did take place and you were clearly lying when you said it didn’t!!! It also very clearly violated campaign law and contribution law as well but you already knew that why else hide it!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP @cindyhydesmith I bet Senator Mcain is rolling in his grave about how you’ve becomes Trumps stooge! I have respect for Mcain for his service to myself and our country for so many years as well as his morals! You SUCK! Senator Graham! #birdsoffeatherflocktogether
