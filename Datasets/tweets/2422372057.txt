Today‚Äôs testimony from mining executives raised congressional awareness of the nation‚Äôs increasing reliance on foreign sources of #minerals and #metals. https://t.co/7BuQ9ssV1E
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. is now import-dependent for 50 key metals and minerals ‚Äì and completely dependent for 20 others. Less than half of the minerals U.S. manufacturers need are sourced domestically, despite the nation‚Äôs abundant mineral endowment.
Rep. Hice: "We have a bureaucratic mess compared to other countries in the world. The issue therefore is what is necessary in order to get around or to change or alter the mess we have in this country in such a way that we can compete."
*Hint: permitting delays* See example-https://t.co/OOJcy5lAPE

NMA‚Äôs Katie Sweeney: ‚ÄúWithdrawing massive acreage of mineral-rich federal land threatens supplies of minerals and metals that are important to the nation‚Äôs economy and encouraged streamlining the permitting process to allow timely access to these valuable resources.‚Äù
Before the @NatResource, NMA‚Äôs Katie Sweeney warned against ‚Äúunwise and unwarranted mineral withdrawals‚Äù that ignore the vast sectors of the American economy that depend upon a reliable and secure supply chain of minerals and metals. https://t.co/n7zexVrZMo
Did you know? In 2012 &amp; 2013, the U.S. ranked last w/ Papua New Guinea (out of 25 mining countries) in permitting delays. Although in 2014, the U.S. improved its overall ranking, the 7 to 10 year permitting timelines still presented the greatest risk to mining projects in the US.
"Navigating the #permitting process has become increasingly costly and cumbersome over time, as federal and state agencies with various land management and regulatory responsibilities in #mineral exploration and development projects often work at cross purposes to one another."
‚ÄúSourcing raw materials domestically keeps costs down, creates both direct and indirect jobs, reduces the holistic impact of mining by minimizing transportation costs, and keeps the dollars invested in American infrastructure in the United States.‚Äù #mining #minerals
