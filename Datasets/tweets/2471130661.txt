@bwcorb @MorningBriefing I'm for expanding opportunity and feeding poor people ahead of giving cocaine to monkeys
@bwcorb @MorningBriefing My point is scientists need to be scientists and make rational arguments defending priorities. In a world of finite resources you have to convince people why giving cocaine to monkeys is more important than giving disability benefits to someone who can't buy groceries.
@bwcorb @MorningBriefing Actually, yes, I've been very critical of defense spending. Scientists tend to make very unscientific and emotional arguments in defense of their research. My "agenda" is to allocate dollars on the basis of merit while considering competing priorities https://t.co/ycO9qGQJBX
@dalepoak @MorningBriefing Pelosi and Trump want to make it dirty again. A Harvard study found that earmarks hurt districts and reduce local investment by 15 percent. Why should we help members hurt their own communities? https://t.co/XXG2XRhCyU
@bwcorb @MorningBriefing Telling taxpayers they can't question federal priorities because they're not smart enough to "understand" the science doesn't help the cause of research

@bwcorb @MorningBriefing Appreciate the back and forth as well. There was a very well developed replace component we worked on before the ACA was formally introduced. https://t.co/vAPmcJkorY
@bwcorb @MorningBriefing A lot of messaging and I was in the middle of it. I don't disagree that there could be an incremental strategy here. I'm saying there's a different standard of seriousness and lower bar being applied to #GND. GOP never came out with something as grandiose and half-baked
@bwcorb Yes, ACA votes were MORE realistic because they signaled intent to repeal and replace which the GOP nearly did in both the House and Senate, failing by just one vote. Is the proposal to ban airplanes one vote short?
@MorningBriefing "Soylent Green" opening to our #GND segment proves why he's the best. #GND highlights the radical leftward shift of the Democratic Party better than any GOP ad ever could. https://t.co/umurDGOEog
@bwcorb ACA repeal votes were more realistic but they obviously didn't work which proves my point. GOP should have been more unified around an inspiring and achievable plan. #GND is postmodern fact-free alarmism that collapses under its own weight.
An enterprising Senate Republican needs to turn the #GreenNewDeal into legislation tomorrow and force a vote on the whole package and each part. Who's ready to call leg counsel? @BenSasse @marcorubio @senatemajldr @jameslankford @SenatorTimScott @tedcruz

Sorry @CoryBooker, in the American system there is no such thing as her truth or his truth. It's about pursuing the truth. The accused always deserves the presumption of innocence. Undermining this system denies everyone, including victims, justice.
@KimStrassel The FBI line of questioning was disingenuous, nonsensical and 100 percent designed to create the appearance of evasion on the part of Kavanaugh. He was wise to not lend it credibility.
@CHueyBurns Fair question. The Dem line of questioning is a based on a false premise that is designed to create the appearance of a pattern of evasion on Kavanaugh's part. He doesn't want to legitimize that. It's like asking the House to veto a bill passed by the Senate. It's nonsensical

Ivanka's refutation of her dad's textbook racism is helpful but will he apologize for his remark about the judge? HRC won't let it go

excellent column Glenn. Let's hope Obama extends the same courtesy to @RepPaulRyan and other conservatives in DC https://t.co/uqlHW24ItG
@chiproytx you're willing to embrace a grand bargain that defunds Planned Parenthood but funds Obamacare and the Iran deal.  I respect that
@chiproytx your willingness to change your demand is the answer.  In a pluralistic society you don't get everything you want
@chiproytx How in good conscience can you fund Obamacare?  Why is that now okay?  Have you joined the surrender caucus?

@chiproytx and why doesn't a far more effective tactician and fighter agree with you? http://t.co/AJscW3QRdP
@chiproytx That doesn't answer her question.  How do you persuade 60 and then 67 to agree with you? How do you move the consciences of 14?

@SenTedCruz is a Bush family runaway.  They gave him his start.
Very nuanced point by @marcorubio - the Establishment truly did line up against him but he's more interested in the future than the past

@ar20org precisely. Coburn would use that term.  110 percent in favor of fighting but there's no shame in regrouping when bullets run out
@ar20org totally agree.  We'd be better off channeling this energy into term limits movement.  Careerism controls DC more than ideology
@ar20org True.  Every day we spend on DHS fight rather than cutting spending hurts us in 2016.  Problem is we're not fighting hard enough
@ar20org Amen to that - conservatives have by far the best ideas.  Sadly we need a new POTUS to overturn many of his orders
@ar20org go read your Federalist Papers.  You're using leftist talking points and undermining the tea party.
@ar20org and why sacrifice our founders' vision for the Senate and minority rights so Obama can veto it?  We'd lose a lot and gain nothing
@ar20org that's at odds with our founders and 230 years of conservative/tea party thought.  Why help a future Dem majority push its agenda?
