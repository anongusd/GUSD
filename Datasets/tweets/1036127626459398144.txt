@DanCrenshawTX The original Pledge, without "under God" stuffed in there?
@dcexaminer @ChrisCuomo @MichaelCohen212 Congratulations for finding this one and pulling it out of the drawer, Chris. @MichaelCohen212, any feedback?
@thehill @LindseyGrahamSC, as @RepCummings says, you're better than this. Don't be like the boss. He's not your boss.
@DanCrenshawTX I recognize that the process takes time, many talks, and incremental steps. I lose faith when our leader returns from one meeting and announces that the problem has been solved. It reduces his credibility. He lies. Often.
@CuomoPrimeTime I don't know how these guys can face themselves in the mirror each morning

@spectatorindex Woohoo. First American city is San Francisco, at #20
@RepPressley This was an excellent point in a great line of questioning.
@MeetThePress @RepCummings God bless Elijah Cummings
@nytimes That was news to me about @RepCummings and @MarkMeadows being BFFs, though
@EricHolder At least Cohen hasn't lied 8,700 times in the past two years
@MeetThePress @Mimirocah1 It qualifies as a continuation of the illegal campaign donation that began with the $130K payment - payments continued for a year after he became president. From his trust, maybe, but he has full rights to the assets of the trust.
@SethAMandel Are you saying they're idiots? I didn't quite hear you.
@MeetThePress @NunbergSam Good. I repeat: good
@spectatorindex Quite a bit of opportunity for improvement there. The US must've been #131 or #132 in terms of trust in politicians
@RepJerryNadler Now comes the hard part
@MeetThePress @kasie I was really touched by the closing statements of both @michaelcohen212 and @RepCummings , as well as Cummings' retort after @RepRashida's &amp; @MarkMeadows' stmts about racism that he knows more about race than anyone, being the son of sharecroppers - who were essentially slaves

@washingtonpost Enjoy your sophomoric nicknames, Cheeto Man
@RomancingNope @washingtonpost * s/b navigating with message or tailoring your message
@RomancingNope @washingtonpost Just that it's hard to be all things to all people - navigating your message to appeal to all. And that 20% of the population that's gun-toting and rural is actually more like 40%, with 60% of the electoral votes...that's why we have POTUS. Maybe 5% of the pop in CA - 10% at most
@RomancingNope @washingtonpost Because 40 million people is a lot harder to reach out to than the 1.3 million in New Hampshire. And the diversity not in terms of pierced everythings (I'm one of those) but in terms of the pierced everythings on the coast vs. the gun-toting rebels in the northeast. That kind.

@BrennanCenter @MrWalterShapiro Frankly, I would say that trump's ascendancy did more to sour voters - especially Democratic voters - on self-funded candidates, but more importantly, candidates from the private sector with no government experience or, prior to their campaigns, government interest.
@Reuters I have mixed feelings about this. In Scandanavia, she would be sent to prison for a period of time, but focus would be on reeducating her on the rules and expectations of British society. Disenfrancising her all but guarantees her life will be spent with ISIS.

@nytimes It never occurred to me that priests cannot form close friendships with anyone - with women for the fear of falling in love and with men for the fear of acting on homosexual desires. It adds a whole new level of repression and loneliness to that life.
@dwhis72 @Reuters I suppose so. We have these stereotypes - shooters are white males, and if it's someone being fired, he's likely older and stressed about getting another job. Last non-white shooter I remember is the south asian psychiatrist at an army base years ago.

@washingtonpost Eloquent statement of the dilemma faced by LGBTQI people in today's society. The Republicans' tent is apparently not big enough to house them, regardless of whether their political beliefs fall on the right side of the divide.

@IssyAsianah @davidhogg111 This is shameful, especially in a so-called advanced society
@PeteSouza A perfect example of that propensity to lie was his declaration that there was an agreement with China to eliminate tariffs, made shortly after meeting with China. The stock market loved it. One day later, it emerged that he'd created that out of whole cloth and it crashed.
@PeteSouza Yipes indeed. I didn't know all that stuff, but I'm hardly surprised. It's good that someone put it out there in black and white, though. This behavior is not new. This is who Donald Trump is. A liar and a sociopath.

@erinruberry Dinner is served!
@SenatorTimScott That means not just refraining from engaging in harmful stereotypes and demeaning behavior, but actually speaking out and voting against behavior that demeans or treats other groups inequally.
@NBCNews The analogy makes no sense. First, it's use of a wall as a barrier that's medieval, not the wall itself. Second, wheels were made after walls, not before. Third, wheels are not a mechanism in and of themselves to repel people. Jeebus. Hammers predate wheels, but still relevant
@DanCrenshawTX That alternate universe was reality two weeks ago, and Congress passed a set of bills to end the shutdown that were, after consideration, rejected by POTUS, contrary to his promise. Also, the shutdown predates the change in leadership--could have resolved in December.
@Lin_Manuel You have 2.7 million friends, Lin-Manuel. That's a lot of weddings!
@SenatorTimScott I admire your willingness to speak out. I just wish that willingness held with respect to unequal treatment of women, LGBTQ, and immigrant communities.

@BrewBusBrett @PreetBharara Today's episode was a fascinating and balanced look at the geopolitical outlook for the world, but also for the US, in 2019 and beyond. Very well reasoned and well-articulated.

@tonyposnanski Have they checked under the bed for those lost Americans? Sometimes they hide there.		The tweet makes no sense. Unsurprisingly.
@hardball His quote was truncated. His actual position is, "The Buck stops with everybody but me"
@maziehirono @SenMajLdr has completely abdicated his responsibility and is shockingly derelict in his duties. He can and should bring up a funding bill for a vote - preferably one that can survive a veto. He's not supposed to be POTUS's lapdog.
@Lin_Manuel I loved that show :-)

@ChrisMurphyCT His response during this emergency is deplorable.
@SenatorCardin @senatemajldr Thank you, @senatorcardin. I would "like" this a dozen times if I could. The appropriate solution is for the Senate to confer and pass a veto-proof bill (or bills) and reconcile it/them with the House.
@ConnieSchultz Yay, Biscuit! I know how scary it is to lose your dog, especially in bad weather. Glad you got her back.
@kaitlancollins @maggieNYT And the Pope isn't Catholic
@PreetBharara What he really said was, "The buck stops with everyone *but me*"
@DanLamothe @maggieNYT That's a helluva lot of 2020 votes he's throwing away...in the states where he needs them. Enjoy the meal you've cooked up for yourself, big man.

@jrfendernyc @StevieVanZandt My favorite (I think) Springsteen concert was during the Ghost of Tom Joad tour in 1995. Just sat in the darkness and wept at the raw emotion. Prelude to Springsteen on Broadway.
@StevieVanZandt I would've been 15 in 1975...
@StevieVanZandt For me, it was a Day on the Green (huge arena) concert around 1975 in Oakland, CA. If I recall correctly, it was Peter Frampton, Santana, and Fleetwood Mac.
@ConnieSchultz The big-name papers are doing well. If half the people who subscribe to them also subscribed to their hometown papers, this crisis would be largely alleviated. Please consider it.

@NicholsUprising @IronStache As a 50-year resident of California, I was apprehensive when Jerry Brown became governor. His term as Governor Moonbeam was an abject failure--except for his romance with Linda Ronstadt--and his term as Oakland mayor wasn't much better, but he's been absolutely terrific this time
@latimes At least he doesn't have the liability of having voted to repeal/replace Obamacare. With that record, he should win his primary.
@springsteen @Target Ordered online from my one remaining independent local store, https://t.co/9xVUZNeDuM
@ezraklein @davidfrum A couple years ago, we in California set up a non-partisan group to do the redistricting. This state is so blue (with far northern and eastern exceptions) that it doesn't really make a difference, but it definitely would help in WI.
@EnglishViceCane @nytimes lol!
@JeffreyToobin @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @NewYorker Yay! I've long believed that this is where the malfeasance will be found...selling condos to rich Russians, etc.
@Acosta Jeez louise...good point...this race isn't won yet. Has he checked among the groundskeepers? Maybe someone there wants to be chief of staff.
@nytimes Isn't this Mulvaney's third job in the administration. I predict he won't last long and that he'll leave the administration rather than moving into a fourth job.
@IronStache Gotta work on redistricting
@PreetBharara Too bad; you'd be a perfect fit
@IronStache This one will be settled in the courts. It's shameful that Republicans would stoop to this level, but I guess they have no shame.

@NateSilver538 If he could've survived until the Cohen bump he might have gained more momentum, but the domestic assault allegation on top of all the "it wasn't my fault - you should see the other guy" events in which he was involved just doomed him. I was a fan. Until I wasn't.
@TVietor08 If you said "rubs it on his eyeballs", that would account for the white semicircles under his eyes

@washingtonpost This is just scary. Broadcasting Fox is bad enough...the idea of broadcasting The Truth as America Sees It sounds like Russia or North Korea. Rex Tillerson was right; trump is a fucking moron.
@PreetBharara Seems to me this could be a very big deal for Half Scoop (Junior) and the SIL with if the Russia meeting is touched on in any way...and even if his testimony with respect to the meeting hasn't been proven false, this contaminates his entire stream of testimony. Bummer, Trump(s)

@WSJ I can't agree with this. My first job was the one at which I had longest tenure. One of my retirement funds there is a 5-star whose YTD return has been in the double digits. I wouldn't want those funds to be automatically transferred to my next employer's funds.

@lisamurkowski .@lisamurkowski - please take a stand on the investigation by the FBI of  Judge Cavenaugh's alleged attempted rape of Dr. Ford. How would you  feel if your 15 year old daughter or granddaughter were put in that  position? Would you hold the 17-year-old responsible?

@PreetBharara @Jeopardy Preet Banana? Preet Bourarough? Preet Nowhere?
@ChuckGrassley @ChuckGrassley - An FBI investigation into the credibility of these claims is the way to go. Dr. Ford favors that approach. A hearing before the Judiciary Committee is a political show, not an independent search for truth.
@nytimesbooks @nytimes Scottie! Never one to hold back.
@eorden It's outrageous that Donald Trump would order such a thing. Any action that can be taken to prevent it should be.
@PreetBharara @cafedotcom @pineapplemedia @PreetBharara, you're getting to be an old man!
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump do your job and direct the FBI to investigate Prof. Ford's allegation
@CBSThisMorning @KamalaHarris .@realDonaldTrump should be compelled to direct the FBI to investigate this matter.

@washingtonpost The notion of having this woman testify in front of 11 @SenateGOP is outrageous; she should be allowed to provide any info the FBI needs to investigate further, then be allowed to get on with her life She was not looking for and does not want her moment in the spotlight

@MichaelAvenatti @chrisgeidner Lesson learned, @MichaelAvenatti. Their loss if you refuse to appear on his show/their network in the future.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews It's just lowbrow misinformation, @MichaelAvenatti. They're preaching to their choir. Not even worth getting pissed off over. As they say, forgive them; they know not what they do.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson I love it! I don't believe I've ever watched a pornographic movie, but I love Stormy and I love you, Michael. Keep fighting the good fight.

@Amy_Siskind @SenSasse @SenSasse pays lip service to ideas that aren't in lockstep with the conservative agenda, but when push comes to shove, he votes Republican.
@nytimes Now where have I seen that kind of step before? Hmm...
@krassenstein Unfortunately, there's no third senator who might be nudged to vote No, and we're SOL unless we can come up with one.
@washingtonpost Excellent question. I've been inspired by the Republicans who left the party because of Trump's populism. It would be nice if they came forward and said, "what he just said? I agree with it. This transcends party."
@Ben_Alpers .@BarackObama did not attack @realDonaldTrump. He merely said he's a symptom of what's wrong in politics - not the cause.
