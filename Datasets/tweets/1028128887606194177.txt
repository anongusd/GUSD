@angrypooka @Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Okay
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC I'm talking policy. Nothing he has done is explicitly racist policy. That would be illegal.	And please stop insulting me.
@angrypooka @Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Correct. In law, it is not a muslim ban.
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Islam is not a race.	Yeah, he's transphobic. That's not racism.	National origin is not a race.
@Galadriel1010 @JordanUhl @AOC The government isn't paying for it though. The people are. And all other countries with single payer systems are much smaller than the US in population
@RyanAFournier It would be really, really, really bad if that happened.
@Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC But it is not a muslim ban.		And islam is not a race. It's a religion.
@Gaga_In_Fla @Anfini00 @thor_benson @charliekirk11 @AOC Already have lol
@angrypooka @Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC It's not a muslim ban ahahaha
@angrypooka @Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC That's not policy.
@babecolate @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC National Origin isn't a race. "American" isn't a race. "Chinese" isn't a race. "Syrian" isn't a race.
@babecolate @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Judaism is an ethnic religion. It is linked to the ethnic group that are the Jews. Islam is a univeral religion, meaning it doesn't pertain to just one race or ethnic group.
@leftistkevo @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC And the question was what President did the most for african americans, not who was least racist
@leftistkevo @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC There's a tradeoff. Good outweighs bad.
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Yeah. You cannot blame him directly though.
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Side note: David Duke needs a swift kick to the nuts
@angrypooka @Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC By your definition, I guess not
@Galadriel1010 @JordanUhl @AOC Universal healthcare costs 20-30 trillion over 10 years
@Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Yes
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Thats what about-ism. Nice try
@A_Smart_Liberal @Eddy120876 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Sorry, that was rude. Looking into these two cases as we speak
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Ok. First off Synagogue shooter was not a Trump fan. Secondly, unless Trump directly told these pieces of garbage to kill innocents, he is largely not to blame. Thirdly, we can all agree that the people who murdered these people on the basis of race are scum.
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Go check vox if you're confused
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC You don't know her.

@itsJesseGreen @refinedmess @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Thank you
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Yes. Someone can be bigoted in one way and not in the other. It is possible.
@Gmen814Sanchez @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Hurr durr democrats r racist
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Dude sick
@GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC It was a good puppet show though 😢
@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC No, if I hear Trump say the n word I will want him impeached for being a racist. Keep in mind he shouldn't have even gotten into office for his numerous sexual assault allegations
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Hey man, don't call me despicable. You don't know me
@Rosentic_xo @GlorfiedGirl @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Thanks

@angrypooka @GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Charged. Emphasis on charged.
@refinedmess @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC White perspective? Excuse me?		That's a little racist m8
@babecolate @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC 4. A shitty thing to do, but not necessarily based on race.	5. Cite sources	2/2
@babecolate @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Okay. So racism, in this context, applies to more general groups. Black, white, asian, etc. So:	1. Religion and national origin is not race. This includes Islam.	2. A terrible thing to do. Not necessarily based on race. Or at least not Trump directly.	1/2
@GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Thank you. Vox is not the worst site in the world but it is biased.
@angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Exactly.
@thor_benson @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC What? Vox has a well documented liberal slant, a slant I sometimes agree with. I'm a liberal. But when trying to prove whether someone's a racist or not, I'd like a neutral source.
@angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Yeah, the guy's an idiot. Doesn't mean he has racist policy.
@GlorfiedGirl @Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Vice ain't so bad. Their documentaries are cool
@angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Yeah, but I'm talking about the present. Not the past. Trump was probably racially biased in the 70s, but what is he doing now?
@Eddy120876 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC Okay
@Hoosier_Legend @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC I wouldn't go that far. Ever heard of Honest Abe? Or Harry Truman? Or Lyndon Johnson? Or BaRaCk ObAmA
@Rosentic_xo @angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC No, Fox News is essentially conservative propaganda. I'm aware of that.
@rsayre @itsJesseGreen @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC I doubt it. It's a great PR move either way. Plus Kanye was pushing for it
@angrypooka @Cleversea23 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC If you think Vox is a reputable news source, you're something else

@JordanUhl @AOC Ok but the problem is is that the programs she is proposing cost way more than the space force
@o0bomb0o @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC "Evidence? Uhh google it!"	*runs away*
@Eddy120876 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC What?
@mattf0292 @thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC I don't call it fake news. I'm just calling it dubious. The orange has not been racist as president. Just because he did spooky shit in the past doesn't mean in the moment he's racist. Islamophobic, sure. Xenophobic, sure. But not racist. I'm not going there yet.
@thor_benson @Anfini00 @charliekirk11 @AOC That's not an explanation, that's a redirection. Nice try.

@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder Yeah
@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder It would be impractical. It takes 6 months to get to Mars. All us earthlings would have to do is lob a nuke or two at it and problem solved.
@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder In reality the sheer distance between Mars and Earth is going to cause a massive cultural shift. Unless there's a way to get internet in the Valles Marineris, we're looking at 2 civilizations. But it ends there. Mars has way less resources than Earth. Mars men can't build nukes
@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder I have to disagree.		As for literal Martian men, if you mean	People living on Mars--Uhh I haven't played Infinite Warfare yet	As for aliens	We legit need some fuckin Halo-style space force. And people on different planets so if shit hits the fan here we can survive as a species
@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder Yeah. 	That's my main reason for wanting a global union. Not as much of "lol globalism lol multiculturalism" but like what the fuck are we gonna do when aliens show up. And the statistical reality is they are indeed out there and pose a serious threat. Not conspiracy theory stuff
@SgtKOnyx @SWolf167 @scrowder UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS!!!!!
Merry motherhecking christmas
@SWolf167 @scrowder Yeah but it would be sick
@elizabethlasche @KevinSpacey No problem.	I wouldn't necessarily call it gossip. The Anthony Rapp case was a big part of the beginning of the #MeToo movement. I'd say as crucial as Cosby, Weinstein and Louis CK in terms of big name actors getting exposed
@elizabethlasche @KevinSpacey Anthony Rapp	Will Little	Ari Behn	Roberto Cavazos	Tony Montana	Harry Dreyfuss	And other young men or children at the time of each assault.	Spacey is currently being brought to court for the Will Little case.

@realDonaldTrump Exciting stuff!

@elizabethlasche @KevinSpacey Here's what he did--	He molested children.	Then when people called him out for it, he said he was gay. As if that is relevant at all.	He's scum.

i.e. vote for Democrats that oppose socialism, support the 2nd amendment and free speech, and don't use their x-y-z identity as a talking point	Vote for Republicans that prioritize the environment and speak out against Trump-ian rhetoric.
It's annoying but I'm gonna tell you who to vote for.		Vote for moderate Republicans/Democrats.		We need middle-ground pushback against the Trump administration and the Regressive Left. Trump is a problem in himself and identity-politics left is turning scarily mainstream.
