This @HardballChris interview with Giuliani is very good. Matthews pushing him hard on words v. actions.
So here's the big takeaway: Matters little if Trump held his base tonight. He needs to make up 6 points in 30 days. Did this do it? No.
Conway clarifies -- "I meant unless someone in my household needs me."  OK.  Sure. @maddow @MSNBC @BWilliams
I think Trump's campaign manager just said she might quit.  Now she's back on to clarify.  @maddow
What did Conway mean when she said, "I am with the campaign to the bitter end ... unless ... "?  Unless what?
