@kherman Is time running out?
@mgroppe A @NYTimes correction that Ron Howard and fans of "The Music Man" will appreciate, too.
"Globalists" is the neo-Nazi term for Jewish domination of world finance and media. It is the "n word" of the neo-Nazis. No American politician should be able to use it without paying a huge political price. Words matter. We should never use Nazi code words in political discourse
The fallacy that "the Jews" are "globalists" who control the United States, control the media, control Hollywood, control world banking is widespread around the globe. Every American, every fair-minded human, must speak up when any of these lies are uttered.
It is up to each of us to rebut the global libels against the Jewish people. At a recent discussion in Beijing, a scholar condemned "the Jews" when criticizing Bibi Netanyahu. I strongly objected and noted Israeli PM is not "the Jews" any more than Saudi prince is "the Muslims."
