@bomba_chica @DanCrenshawTX @lokibeat The section also caps the # of asylum grants &amp; makes it so no court or immigration judge can review a DHS decision to deport an asylum seeker, which means Sec. Nielsen could just deport anyone she wants and no one could make sure her determination complied with the law.
@bomba_chica @DanCrenshawTX @lokibeat It is inhumane/a violation of international law to codify the ability to more quickly remove from the country minors seeking asylum and fleeing violence. The change would also limit asylum grants only to those DHS deems ‚Äúin the national interest,‚Äù not the applicant‚Äôs interest.
@bomba_chica @DanCrenshawTX @lokibeat Division L, all the way at the end (pages 1278 to 1301); the section doesn‚Äôt change international law, it violates it. International law forbids the kind of policy outlined in Division L because it is inhumane.
@DanCrenshawTX If goal is to limit immigration between ports of entry, then a high # of apprehensions is a success metric. BP agents effectively stopping entries, no need for a wall. And the undocumented population in the US has been steadily declining, indicating the status quo is effective.

@hereslooknaukid What do you mean by "all of this?" My argument? McCain/Graham's argument?
Bush's war was the direct catalyst for the creation of ISIL. American strength is not the solution to Iraqi extremism, it is the root cause.
In going to war w/Iraq &amp; toppling Saddam Hussein, Bush vacated a secular Sunni power structure in favor of a religious extremist one: ISIL
Bush deposed a secular Sunni Ba'athist govt in 03, increasing Shia (pro-Iranian) influence and forcing Sunnis to search for power elsewhere.
4) The senators fault Obama's withdrawal for creating ISIS. Wrong. http://t.co/fCazPQqqaE

The one thing ISIS needs to develop from a loosely organized extremist faction into an established Islamic State is American "strength."
To diffuse ISIS, we must take away its usefulness to Iraqi/Syrian/global communities who might see in it protection &amp; not radical extremism.
ISIS wants power. They will get it when unified opposition to US-led occupation supplements their ranks w/jihadists &amp; coffers w/oil money.
The kind of "strength" GOP hawks call for only makes extremism more popular, fueling discontent that is the lifeblood of insurgency.

Toothless support for a project that'd cause unprecedented enviro damage in exchange for 50 jobs is why #HR3 is #StuckintheSenate #5of43
In light of that, #HR3 has at most an indirect role in producing ~50 perm. jobs. Not the kind of "jobs bill" the American people need.
In essence, #HR3 is more ceremony than action, voicing support for a project that currently lives or dies by Presidential permit. #Keystone
Also, whether Congress has any authority to act on the pipeline is an issue that'd certainly require judicial review: http://t.co/xWX2X602rj
We must weigh those 50 new permanent jobs against the negative environmental impact of a significant increase in global carbon emissions.
These jobs would be created over a two-year period, after which 50 permanent jobs would remain. #HR3 #KeystoneXL
#HR3 is the closest we've yet come to a "jobs bill," in that a @StateDept analysis determined the project would create 1,950 temporary jobs.
Fifth on @SpeakerBoehner's list is a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline, H.R. 3, the Northern Route Approval Act http://t.co/iVGGW7b27i
A bill repealing Obamacare is not a "jobs bill," which is probably why it's #StuckintheSenate #HR45 #4of43
#HR45 is a "jobs bill" because taking away affordable coverage from 23.7M-28.4M Americans creates jobs? (http://t.co/UTcQticKua)
#HR45 is a "jobs bill" because allowing lifetime limits on coverage creates jobs?
#HR45 is a "jobs bill" because allowing insurance companies to arbitrarily withdraw coverage creates jobs?
#HR45 is a "jobs bill" because preventing those under 26 from being covered under their parent‚Äôs health plan creates jobs?
#HR45 is a "jobs bill" because limiting and denying benefits to children under 19 due to a pre-existing condition creates jobs?
H.R. 45 is a bill to Repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: https://t.co/jTRNTMLXBO #StuckintheSenate
Because it is a thinly-veiled attack on wage-earners, #HR1406 is #StuckintheSenate #3of43
Perhaps @SpeakerBoehner is hoping most people are simply taking his word for fact, because it is impudent to call #HR1406 a "jobs bill."
Not only is #HR1406 not a "jobs bill," it directly conflicts with workers' rights and burdens wage-earning middle class families.
Instead of seeing extra wages earned at 1.5x their normal rate, these workers would receive CT they may never actually use. #HR1406
Under #HR1406, not only would employers get to pay their workers less, but they'd be able to dictate when this Comp Time could be taken.
In effect, #HR1406 allows employers to give workers "Compensatory Time" in lieu of Overtime Pay &amp; making it legal to work without being paid
Third, we explore H.R. 1406, the Working Families Flexibility Act: https://t.co/Mr3Q79rqjJ
Because #HR624 (CISPA) has no discernable relationship to job creation and likely violates the 4th Amendment, it's rightly #StuckintheSenate
From the Electronic Frontier Foundation, on how this "jobs bill" would nullify any right to privacy you now enjoy: https://t.co/QdqtUXmizV
In effect, CISPA allows private companies to share your private information with the government or other 3rd parties. #HR624
CISPA is predominantly a Security bill aimed at staving off cyber attacks, and has only a specious relationship to job creation. #HR624
Next up on @SpeakerBoehner's "jobs bill" list is H.R. 624, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA. #StuckintheSenate
It is also anti-reformative, bad policy, and so perhaps rightly it remains #StuckintheSenate #HR890 #1of43
H.R. 890 is not a "jobs bill" as much as an election-year cudgel to engage and distract the GOP base.
In effect, GOP-sponsored #HR890 makes it easier for TANF recipients working unpaid jobs to get federal $ and not earn their own.
Right now, state programs are judged on work participation rate (WPR), which does not necessitate paid work and ignores productive outcomes.
The purpose of waivers on TANF's work req. is to give states the authority to test more effective assistance to needy families. #HR890
H.R. 890 prevents waivers for TANF work requirements, a political posture that denigrates the poor #StuckInTheSenate http://t.co/NtJE7arU32

I shouldn't waste my breath; this is just the latest attempt to spin Obamacare as a detriment in the face of overwhelming positive evidence.
House Rs' bill will not encourage employers to increase hours. It will just put affordable health care out of reach for millions more.
Defining full-time work as 30+ hours enables workers to obtain insurance. Employers are to blame for unnecessary cuts to hours worked.
A law removing language from the #ACA about 30 hour workweeks would do nothing to prevent lost hours and everything to deny health coverage.
It's clear many if not most in Congress never learned about bad policy and unintended consequences.

@cheprin something about limiting negative impact of having to "unwind" 1000s of marriages if ruling is reversed.
Here's your normal reminder that twitter is a godawful forum for political debate, or any (civil) debate for that matter. Just don't.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm well, that was illuminating. Thanks both of you.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm that's certainly true. But I'm arguing for what I feel would enhance our judiciary. Different points altogether
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm where's your empirical proof for that assertion?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale you're saying in order to "prove" that judicial tenure needs reform, I need to solve partisanship in Congress.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale ...and do nothing but sit and say "you're wrong" yourself. I get that.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale it's a lot easier to win an argument when you expect your opponent to account for every possible related matter...
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale you're correct. It is my opinion and my conjecture that it is problematic.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale that's a whole different conversation, and not at issue here.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm separate problem, separate solution, not at issue here.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale surely we shouldn't preserve one problematic policy merely because "the senate is just so frustrating, why bother?"
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale that's independent of my argument, and would require an independent solution
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm so they can join your argument against me? I'm a loose constructionist.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm that's a problem in the Senate; there are plenty of qualified jurists.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm No. I argue we have no way of knowing if limited tenure would greater mirror values than does the status quo.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Just because you don't find it compelling doesn't mean others won't. I'm not the only person who holds this opinion.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale I believed you attacked my intelligence and dropped a few F-bombs. Gently nudging?
@tylerhower @Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Miers and Bork weren't confirmed by the Senate. How does that have to do with tenure length?
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm Thats not "evidence." You cant say status quo is better than an alternative just because it's reality vs. conjecture.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale You're advocating for the status quo.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Ok. I think we found who *really* likes the sound of their own voice. If you have no stake, you're just making noise.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale same reason you are?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale In my "proposal" there would be no re-appointment. Only one-time terms of 10-15 years for example.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Why are you both so vehemently opposed to ending life tenure?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale It's just my opinion. There is no way of knowing what the effect would be if not put into practice.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm Defining a set term would introduce a level of ethical restraint that is lacking.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm Life tenure has failed in preventing politics from being brought into the judiciary. (Bush v Gore, Citizens United)
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale I'm doing no such thing. That's your inference, but I'm not claiming a victory. Just trying to argue my position.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm We all know that's not the case.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale So you agree. BY DESIGN, there was ambiguity in crafting the Constitution.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale It's fucking twitter. It's a thought exercise.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Do you always get this angry during intellectual dispute? Argue my idea, not me.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm And restricting terms would better serve the republic by making this evolution more timely to a changing society.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale The Constitution was written ambiguously in order to preserve long-term applicability. Do you disagree?
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm And I'd expect better than to fall back on the "this is how it's always been, therefore it MUST be right" argument.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm How are you not making an argument? You're opposing mine, which is, in essence, an argument.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale I never took you for a strict constructionist.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Maybe. I doubt it. Especially when "multiple" is two vs. one.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm I missed the part where you introduced empirical evidence for your argument, or is that just for me?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Excuse me. Ambiguous was the word I meant to use. I'm not talking about unenforceability due to vagueness.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale Please clarify my inconsistency. I don't see it.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale You attempt at a "you didn't go to law school, therefore you're ignorant" argument was sad. I was simply rebutting.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale I think the issue is, you don't know what I'm suggesting, based on multiple mischaracterizations of my argument.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale How is it any different from how political judicial appointments are in the current status quo?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale It's not inconsistent to promote democratic values and point out we are not a pure Democracy.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm I'm saying there's a third way here that avoids unlimited tenure AND political pressures.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm See every statement I've made so far, and catch up to the fact that this is not my argument.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale I've taken classes from legal scholars at the University of Chicago who would disagree.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale And I'm saying APPOINT- not elect- but to limited terms.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale That's a simplistic and naive take, and I think you know that. We're a federal republic, not a democracy.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale That's not what I'm suggesting at all, and I've already stated as much.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm Absolutely not. I would prefer term-limited appointments instead of indefinite ones.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm I'm arguing that more rapid turnover in those who interpret will better reflect the development of cultural needs.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm ...such that any one individual may interpret differently and be validated based on cogent argument.
@BeaAnneDale @Pschlarm Nine people "control" what interpretation is made. The Constitution and most laws are intentionally vague...
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale What is the benefit of life tenure, and how does it compensate for the demonstrated detriments?
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale ... as a bulwark against tyranny of the majority. I think YOUR argument doesn't make sense.
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale As a branch of a democratic republic, their effect should promote the tenets of democracy, specifically...
@Pschlarm @BeaAnneDale yes, Dougie?
@BeaAnneDale it is not democratic to have the same handful of ideologues controlling an entire third of our federal government for decades
@BeaAnneDale same ideal can be achieved by a fixed definite term of say 10 yrs, while also preventing overstayed welcomes/promoting variety
@BeaAnneDale life tenure is designed to prevent judges from being influenced by the political pressure of the electorate...

Please Read Timothy Egan's "Good Poor Bad Poor" NYT Op-ed if you want a sense of this Congress' holiday spirit: http://t.co/wqOnMPzxyF
These actions have nothing to do w/bringing federal spending into line, &amp; everything to do with a view that poor people are morally inferior
"Congress has let unemployment benefits expire for 1.3 million people, beginning just a few days after Christmas."
"The House, refuge of the shrunken-heart caucus, has passed a measure to eliminate food aid for four million Americans, starting next year."
"Making the poor out to be lazy...does not make them less poor. It only makes the person saying such a thing feel superior." -Timothy Egan
@SenRandPaul No, Senator, in Washington, "bipartisan deal" is a synonym for "screwing the poor."
I am full of life, and of love. I am compassionate, faithful, sensible, and kind. I invent ways of doing good. Can you say the same, Phil?
@stuckonsmile I'm sorry. Catholic family?

Blame belongs not only to those actively opposed, but also those who are complacent &amp; content with doing nothing to prevent future disaster.
We need to hold every single opponent to gun control personally responsible for the violent deaths of our children and loved ones.
If we continue on this path of inertia and inaction, the blood of the next classroom full of children murdered will be on OUR hands.
As much as victims' families need support, families of future victims need proactive action even more.
If preventing ONE more 6yo child from being shot at school would mean melting down &amp; destroying every gun in America, it would be worth it.
It is now the norm to greet childrens' bullet-riddled bodies with a shrug, a few platitudes, and inaction. That sickens me.
We cannot allow this if we are to call ourselves a civilization.
Every time someone proclaims their right to own an inanimate metal propellant, think of mutilated 6 &amp; 7 year old bodies on a classroom floor
Look at their photos and read their names. Cry, get angry, but do not ignore. These are people who could have been saved by gun control.
As we approach a year since these children and educators were violently murdered, nothing has been done to prevent history from repeating.

@CraigDanAdams &amp; if its his youth, then social pressure led him to feel like he couldn't just love with a man. He had to qualify that love.

@DazzleLeeMurphy @CraigDanAdams I agree he didnt have to say anything; but now he did, it's not his private life. He chose to make it public

@CraigDanAdams the phrasing/coverage frames the issue as if same-sex relationships are an exception instead of the norm &amp; that's problematic
@CraigDanAdams and why "of course?" Implies that it would be a shock or disappointment if he weren't, which stigmatizes same-sex attraction.

Ideological gridlock wont end until the media frees itself from its role as a conduit for the manufactured farce some seek to make reality.
How quickly the narrative shifts from reality to absurdity when the "news" is simply talking points &amp; attacks portrayed as irrefutable fact.
Instead of the media acting as a check on ideology and extremism, it only mainstreams a warped reality dreamt up by partisan influencers.
Media outlets have figured out that parroting the most divisive words and events generate more views than rigorous investigative journalism.
Firmly convinced that the problem is not hyper partisanship, but rather a dearth of fact based reporting in favor of media sensationalism.

@me4scotus It's really dumb. Maybe because they have twice as many options? Or b/c I can't satisfy their thirst for poon?
@me4scotus that's pansexuality.
@me4scotus I also have the totally irrational fear that if I dated a bi guy, he'd be much more likely to cheat on me/leave me than a gay one

@Pschlarm @adammc123 Fact is, his popularity drops when voters are reminded (by the media) that he is a non-monogamous sexual being.
@Pschlarm @adammc123 If the focus of Weiner's supposed unsuitability were on his lying and not self-important slut shaming, I'd agree w/you.

@adammc123 Media fascination with distracting non-issues is reprehensible, but Weiner is also a scumbag, not to mention handling it horribly
@adammc123 &amp; doubling down with apologies with this renewed interest in his personal life only reinforces the media shaming him/his actions
@adammc123 His problem is that he lied about it to begin with, and now everyone knows he's full of shit.
@adammc123 If it were me I'd be like, "yea thats me, so what? Take your judgment elsewhere." In this age, lying gets caught.

@Aubs89 Well he has a record. A relatively unflattering one. I'd rather that be the focus rather than pictures of his penis.
And if you need to count on voters disregarding policy altogether, should you be elected into any kind of public office? I hope not.
That seems like a more important problem to solve for the best interest of New Yorkers. Who needs voters to ignore policy with their vote?
Someone deliberately planned for this mayoral race to be about distracting personal issues. Lets find out who, &amp; why they want a distraction
It all boggles the mind.
Voters implicitly forgave Weiner by supporting his current run. Now support erodes after they're reminded of something they knew already?
And one more thing, stop acting like the reemergence of Weiner's "scandal" is a surprise. Of course it reemerged, he's a public figure again
There needs to be room for serious policy debate about the needs of our society and how to address them, not endless character attacks.
Every character devoted to Weiner sexts is a distraction, and an example of the failure of our media to inform us about issues that matter.
I don't condone Weiner's behavior, but I'm not above it, and refuse to participate in public shaming of sexuality in any form.

Calling an interest rate hike that will only get worse with time a "Smarter Solution for Students" would be humorous if it werent so harmful
Let your 81 Senators and 221 Reps know that their disregard for the already-grim economic prospects of today's students won't be tolerated.
A vote for H.R. 1911 is a vote against students, and a pointed blow that only worsens the already outsized effect of this recession on youth
Any way it's spun, any bill that doesnt continue student loan interest rates at &lt;3.4% is a bill that increases student debt/govt profit.

JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO PARENT DOESN'T MEAN MY CHILDREN SHOULD BE FORCED TO PRACTICE YOUR RELIGION.
"What's gay. daddy?" It's when two boys or two girls love each other, like your mom and I love each other.
"Why do we have a Christmas tree at home, but a Holiday Tree at school?" B/c kids at school practice all diff. religions, &amp; it's only fair.
How many unconstitutional conservative laws are based on the idea that parents shouldn't be expected to explain things to their children?

@BrittonDale One of those pesky implied rights that a strict constructionist would laugh at! Scalia's jurisprudence is often inconsistent.
We are not a police state. We Americans place great value in individualism. That right to the self will expire with these kinds of rulings.
If, as this Court believes, there is no right to keep private our most basic selfhood, our DNA, a Const'l right to privacy must not exist.
Claiming the compulsory seizure of DNA as a necessity for identification holds uncomfortable Orwellian implications.
This may be one of the few times that I agree wholeheartedly with Justice Scalia.
This ruling could set a very dangerous precedent in an era that will be defined by challenges to individual privacy.
This is the danger of an evermore politically motivated Court: significant rollback of basic Constitutional rights protections. #SCOTUS #DNA

"IRS workers saw this &amp; tried, in a small way, to impose a sense of order. For that, the‚Äôll likely be ushered into bureaucratic oblivion."
NYer: "It‚Äôs what society chooses not to punish that tells us most about the prevailing ethical standards of the time."
"IG report [will ID] these orgs. Which'll look like "social welfare" &amp; which'll look like political activists seeking anonymity/tax breaks?"
NYer: "Rather IRS employees thought that these groups might be doing explicit politics‚Äîwhich would disqualify them for 501(c)(4) status."
NYer: " IRS took names of certain groups that tend to signal conservatism as signals that they might not be engaged in ‚Äúsocial welfare."
Teeth'd be removed from "scandal" if scrutiny applied equally to both left &amp; right, but right wing groups much more likely to form 501c4s.
IRS should be scrutinizing political groups' manipulation of the tax code MORE, not less. http://t.co/gHuDTDHyrM

@OversightDems GOP has shifted the burden of proof from the claimant to the respondent so they can peddle baseless accusations with impunity
@FredHystere *implementing* the concept might be dangerous. And I say might because we don't know what a "borderless" world would be like.
@FredHystere the thought is dangerous?
@FredHystere However outlandish, the concept is at the very least an interesting thought experiment.
@mCase513 :(

@erinscafe I tried this. Didn't go over so well trying to bring my open 40 through security at the courthouse where I work, though.

@CraigDanAdams 3:1 @Somhairle @Phil_Lloyd @thegilf @unolando
I wonder how many minutes of @DarrellIssa's Weds Benghazi Hearing will detail how Congress cut embassy security budgets.
@daveweigel Now that Obama's been reelected and Hillary's the 2016 frontrunner, sure GOP focus will be deliberately centered on State Dept.
@UnitedLiberals @daveweigel Focus on Benghazi 4 political purposes only serves to belittle 1000s of lives lost to preventable violence since
@Nupe117 Oh, he will. His approval numbers are abysmal.
@xgonzalezjr Thanks for the follow. I've been toying w/idea of moving to Austin for a while. Convince me!
Conservatives found more likely than liberals to bend facts to held beliefs http://t.co/Uga0wzVkJy The Salon summary: http://t.co/GmdOdSDP9w

@adammc123 But either way, I hate it. Sick of losing young Americans to war.
@adammc123 But realistically, no one else will, everyone expects *us* to, and it's becoming more and more likely we'll be compelled to go.
@adammc123 My visceral reaction is that we've been at war longer than not in my lifetime, I'm antiwar, let someone else intervene.
@turnandstomp ...um. You think because I'm short I should just be lucky to get anyone? I think he's cute.

@James_T_Higgins D is digital. SLRs are bodies + lenses and more advanced than point-and-shoots. They start around $500 tho so out of range
@Aubs89 Gold Star! *favorites* @HowardKurtz
@James_T_Higgins lens also for zoom. But it does get expensive quickly. What's your price range?
@James_T_Higgins If you're talking DSLRs, it's the right lens that matters for low light. I have a Canon 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 that's perfect

.@HuffingtonPost it's not a character flaw in our teenagers, it's the fact of the time we live in that work and success are less correlated.
@HuffingtonPost recent economic history has shown them hard work doesn't always guarantee success or even financial stability.
