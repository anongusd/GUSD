(This is after Rep. Lujan quipped that he often gets better Internet service flying over his state than he does on the ground.)
Rep. O'Halleran chimes in on the coverage issue. "Half the time I'm covered. Half the time I'm not."
Claure and Legere take the opportunity to promise that their merger will address the lack of coverage in Vermont by allowing them to build in rural areas.
Claure blames AT&amp;T and Verizon for the maps, saying Sprint relies on their networks to provide coverage in many of those areas. 		Welch: "These are no good! These are PHONY MAPS"
Welch: "These maps are bogus. They just don't work."
Rep. Welch, who represents Vermont, is bringing up a state study analyzing cell coverage that found it was woefully lacking compared to federal coverage maps built in part on claims by carriers.		"In a lot of Vermont, we have no G... so I'm a skeptic."
Cardenas calls Legere "tennis shoes guy" and Claure "hard shoes guy," in reference to Legere's casual work attire. On low-income phone service in particular, Cardenas says "I like the hard shoes guy and what he's been doing ... rather than the tennis shoes guy."
Lawmakers including Reps. Lujan and Cardenas are challenging Legere to clarify his commitments to build out to rural areas and participate in the low-income Lifeline program.
Really don't understand why lawmakers keep messing up Berenbroick's name. It's pronounced exactly like it's spelled!
We've reached the point in the hearing where it's largely lawmakers without expertise asking the questions, meaning they're lobbing basic inquiries that the execs are easily handling with ready talking points.

Rep. Eshoo: "I want to use my time not to ask questions but to make a statement."		(Congressional hearings in a nutshell.)
"When you decrease competition for labor, wage rates go down," argues Shelton, who represents telecommunications workers. Legere says his customer care workers make $46K a year and get stock benefits.
Bennet: T-Mobile and Sprint "have had more than 20 years to build out to rural America."
The hearing has moved on to discuss the merger's effect on prepaid customers. Consumer groups allege that after the merger the prepaid market will be served by a duopoly that could raise prices. Legere, naturally, disputes the idea that prices will go up.
Rep. Shimkus is asking Legere to describe what Uncarrier means. Really? That marketing campaign began in 2013, an eon ago!
Rep. McNerney cites examples of 4-to-3 mergers in other countries such as Austria and the Netherlands to argue prices go up after these sorts of combinations.
Legere argues that T-Mobile's merger will lead to an 87 percent decline in the price per gigabyte of mobile data, and as in his written testimony, claims he'll go after cable companies.
Looks like the answer is no. Pallone asked about the merger's impact on call center jobs, and is now asking about public safety and network resilience in the face of natural disasters.
Pallone, the chair of the House E&amp;C Committee, is up. Will he ask about the Trump hotel? We'll see.
Brake: For better or for worse, "This [merger] is not a jobs program." 		It's a good reminder.
If you allow the merger on the grounds it'll pave the way for 5G, it creates the precedent that anytime there's an opportunity to promise 6G or 7G or 8G, carriers will use it as a chance to merge, according to Berenbroick.
Public Knowledge's Philip Berenbroick is up. He reminds Congress the FCC's role is to promote competition, not just preserve it, and that T-Mobile has failed to prove that it'll be better for competition.
Doug Brake of the think tank ITIF is now up. 		He echoes T-Mobile, arguing Legere's argument that the merger will help deploy 5G. Like Walden, he also claims "four competitors is not always better. There's nothing special about the number four."
Carri Bennett, who represents rural wireless carriers, is now up.		She cites allegations T-Mobile inserted fake ringing sounds into people's calls to rural areas to make it sound like it was completing the calls when it wasn't. T-Mobile settled last year: https://t.co/kuGpAUExEt
Shelton closes by claiming that the deal would be "economic treason" in that it would enhance the power of T-Mobile and Sprint's foreign parents, Deutsche Telekom and Softbank.
Shelton disputes T-Mobile's claim that the merger will create jobs, saying the company will try to fudge the numbers because it doesn't differentiate between FTEs and contractors.
Chris Shelton, president of the Communications Workers of America: "This merger will kill American jobs and raise prices on American consumers."
@Judahe @auctnr1 lol
Legere opens his pitch by hanging it on the promised benefits of 5G. There's little doubt that 5G will be faster and more reliable than LTE; the question for regulators is whether the U.S. needs this merger to get there.
And now T-Mobile's John Legere is up.
Without the merger, Claure says, Sprint would have to take on more debt and, by extension, raise prices on its customers.
Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure is up now.

Rep. Walden says it's an "artificial market constraint" to keep a policy that says the U.S. needs at least 4 national wireless carriers.
Superficially this is about whether the FCC is just a rubber stamp for deals, but alludes to a much broader debate about whether "behavioral" restrictions on merging companies are ever a good or workable idea. DOJ has expressed repeated skepticism about these.
Pallone: "There's a serious question as to whether the Trump FCC would be willing to impose any conditions on the merger order."
Rep. Pallone is recounting the numerous times big wireless players have sought to merge with one another over the years. TL;DR they were repeatedly rebuffed by regulators.
By the way, you can follow along live, right here: https://t.co/79asBxeomQ
Rep. Doyle opens the hearing and isn't afraid to dive right into wonky topics like HHI, a metric economists use to evaluate how concentrated a given market is.
This is probably among the most appealing arguments for the merger, but unfortunately also the one that's hardest to test.

Ah yes, the cunning strategy of owning your opponents by giving them cash https://t.co/Et1uKYpciI
For INCOMPAS to break with Sprint and T-Mobile underscores how its interests (representing smaller carriers, backend providers, et al.) diverge from the consolidation that this merger represents.
Meanwhile, a key telecom trade association, INCOMPAS, has come out against the T-Mobile/Sprint deal. 		This is interesting, because Sprint is one of the group's founding members and the association has frequently found itself aligned with T-Mobile on a variety of issues.
You can find that reporting, by @OConnellPostbiz and @Fahrenthold, here: https://t.co/XlrC5vtsfF
Couple highlights to note: First, keep an eye out for lawmakers to question John Legere on his stays at the Trump hotel in Washington. Records obtained by @washingtonpost showed T-Mobile execs booked at least 52 nights there since the Sprint deal was announced.

Rep. Shimkus just pivoted from net neutrality to a question about The Wall, asking whether border agents should be able to have information prioritized.		Rep. Doyle: "Do you guys have to mention the wall at every hearing?"
(The 2015 rules did not authorize any of that, and the FCC at the time said Congress's ban on Internet access taxes also covered this possibility.)
Powell says that rules governing the FCC's Universal Service Fund would require that ISPs, under Title II, would have to add new fees to consumers' Internet bills.
And former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler says that when ISPs say they're for net neutrality, just not Title II, it's like saying "I’m for justice, just not for the courts overseeing it."
Former FCC Chair Michael Powell (now representing cable group NCTA) says his original effort to identify four Internet freedoms was an attempt to "give voice in a regulatory sense to what had already become a pretty rigid engineering concept" among Internet developers.
@KarlBode As I told @pab_PK, any legislative activity (loophole-filled or otherwise) would be subject to the same political dynamics from 2016/7 that make talking about the specifics significant in their own right but largely irrelevant in terms of actually producing a result.
@BrianDietz See my very next tweet!
@pab_PK I'm referring to legislative activity in the abstract, not any specific proposal.
TL;DR nothing we're discussing right now is new or novel. It's mostly warmed over talking points from prior years.
The benefit to Republicans of proposing legislation now is in attempting to seize the moral high ground — pointing out that Democrats are cynically refusing to deal when they hold most of the cards.
Supporters of the 2015 rules are still holding out for a court decision that favors the old rules. They're not going to want to legislate as long as there's a chance the 2017 Pai order gets struck down.
Republicans are proposing legislation to solve the net neutrality debate once and for all. But the same political dynamics are still in place as before Democrats flipped the House.

"We're sorry for the inconvenience," they say, and offer a $100 gift card.		Great. The last thing I want is to spend more money at your establishment, particularly if you're hoping I accidentally go over that $100 and fork over more of my money, or go under and save you money.
The very helpful third person tries their best, but is only able to reschedule me for Feb. 12, which'll still mean four weeks of me and my tenants being unable to do laundry. There's a chance a technician could come on Saturday, but only if somebody else cancels.
I finally get someone on the phone. They transfer me. 		The next person also transfers me. 		By the time I'm explaining my situation a third time, I'm just about ready to accept my fate and keep backpacking to my neighbor's house, but I've come this far. I have to see it through.
They put me down for Feb. 20 and tell me to call [COMPANY Y] again to see if they can bump it earlier, but please wait until 2 pm to call because "their systems are currently down." WTF??
I offer to help. Dude says no, it's a liability thing. Fine. So when can you start? Guy says he can't, we need to reschedule. First available appointment is FEBRUARY 20, a month after we first called for their help.
Two weeks go by, during which I (twice) throw my clothes into a 100-liter backpack and do laundry at a neighbor's house. 		Repair guy shows up today, but his assistant is nowhere to be found. He's stuck on another job. Assistant is needed because of the stacked-appliance issue.
When can you come out? "Oh, Jan. 23."		Guy comes out 3 days later and charges me $99 to arrive at the same conclusion I did. But as luck would have it, the *one part he needs*, he doesn't have. Someone will have to come back.		The next available appointment isn't for TWO WEEKS.
So I call [COMPANY Y]. Can they come out today? No, but here's a warranty you can sign up for today and [marketing speak]"		By the way, the Times had an interesting writeup of these warranties and the meaning of "authorized servicers." Read it here: https://t.co/P9ch2iUwoM https://t.co/MKVvlbV4pw

The video doesn't even reflect the full scope of work, either, because to access the machine you first have to lift the dryer off the washer and then take the washer out of the alcove where it lives. I'm now thinking if I attempt it, I'll either screw it up or get killed trying.
I wasn't wrong! Diagnosing the issue was pretty easy. Actually performing the fix? Pretty much a 75-step process. It's as if they deliberately make it hard to DIY. (The machine was already here when I moved in.) https://t.co/FzjOSOXI1e

Rhetorically, this is key to undercutting the trap that dominates American discourse on race, as it avoids the debate about whether a person “is racist.” It acknowledges that even people who consider themselves very inclusive can find themselves saying racist things!
Note the way Abrams talks about race, which is very important and probably underappreciated by most non-POCs. She focused on calling out “racist words and deeds,” not racists as a category of people.

The FCC just went to court to defend repealing its #netneutrality rules. Here's how it did: https://t.co/AUzbUDi0g5
In non-Northam news, a trio of federal judges had tough questions for the FCC over #netneutrality: https://t.co/D0wXDymJWM
Folks in the room seem to think the FCC held the upper hand when talking about what is or isn't a telecommunications service, and that things got better for Mozilla et al. as the conversation proceeded to issues like public safety, transparency and preemption.
Wilkins and Millett also drilled down on the FCC's revised transparency rule, which tacitly gives ISPs permission to throttle, block and prioritize so long as they disclose that fact. 		Millett in particular kept demanding to know what the disclosures must look like, where, etc.
But Judges Wilkins and Millett spent a lot of time peppering the FCC with questions about how potential ISP policies on paid prioritization could affect public safety when folks need access to information in a crisis.
As expected, all the judges wrestled (with great difficulty) over what we mean by the terms "information service" and "telecommunications." That was no surprise. #netneutrality
And we’re out. TL;DR if the questioning of Mozilla et al. was tough, the questions directed at the FCC and ISPs were even tougher.
Gotta go back in! More later. The FCC’s side has yet to speak.
We’re on a break. Lots to unpack but very briefly, the judges are asking the opponents of the FCC lots of tough questions.		Also here are DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Sen. Ed Markey.

That Facebook's response consisted of (1) an unapologetic statement and (2) yanking the research app from Apple's App Store while leaving it up on the Google Play Store (!!) suggests Facebook doesn't get, or is unwilling to confront, why what it did was objectionable to people.

But these are all very relevant issues (particularly as we head this week into oral arguments over #netneutrality at the DC Circuit) and questions that simply don’t come up as much if we interpret “Netflix for games” as simply another version of Steam.
Verizon won’t comment on the existence of its gaming experiments, let alone how it would structure its network policies around a gaming service. But this is a plausible approach we’ve already witnessed elsewhere (in mobile music and video).
That’d be one incentive for people not only to drop the other gaming platforms, but also to sign up for Verizon’s network. A twofer.
Suppose Verizon exempts Verizon Gaming from any current or future data caps while making sure those who use Amazon, Microsoft or other streaming game platforms will  have their usage counted.
Just as AT&amp;T cross-promotes WarnerMedia content on its distribution network and vice versa, so too could Verizon use Verizon Gaming as a force multiplier for Fios and vice versa.
Verizon Gaming, if it’s ever released, would compete with Microsoft xCloud, Google’s Project Stream, and whatever Amazon and Apple have in the works. But what the other companies don’t have is control over a broadband network.
But with gaming specifically, Verizon appears to be tinkering with launching its own streaming games service. The company won’t confirm its existence, but a Verizon-built games service neatly addresses the dumb-pipe problem and the gaming problem simultaneously.
This is just a facet of the broader problem telcos face: They’re grappling with how to make money in a world where they’re just the dumb pipe. Companies like AT&amp;T have responded by buying exclusive media properties, and Verizon tried something similar with Oath.
Another question I’ve been getting: What about data caps? 		Well for one thing, the trend in wireless has been to move to unlimited data plans. It doesn’t seem like that will be changing anytime soon. But that obviously puts telecom companies in a pickle. So what do they do?
And as every tech and media company realizes they’re competing for the same limited resource (your time and attention), getting games in front of as many people as possible, as frequently as possible, might be one way the game industry finds an edge.
To date, the limitations of computing power and broadband speeds/latency have prevented us from making this a reality. But now everyone from Microsoft to Google seem to think we’re close enough to give it another shot.
This is why game execs are salivating over this potential technology. All of a sudden, any device you have on you becomes capable of handling fancy games. With enough bandwidth (hello, 5G) you could even theoretically run full games from a smartphone.
The result is that, as with Google’s Project Stream, you could be running a AAA game like Assassin’s Creed on a Chromebook simply by opening a browser tab. No need to download gigabytes of game files or install a massive graphics card to power the game.
Cloud-based gaming is not the same. Instead of downloading the game, you purchase the right to access the game from a server that runs the software for you. The server lives far away from you and everything that happens in the game is processed by the server, not by your device.
At its core, Steam is basically a typical app marketplace: You pay money to download a game to your computer, which you then install and run from there.
The main question that keeps cropping up: “Isn’t the idea of ‘Netflix for games’ just… Steam?”		It’s a good question that reflects how accustomed to e-commerce we’ve all become. But there’s a key difference that helps explain why all these companies getting in is a big deal.

The biggest concern about privacy legislation Delrahim has is the tendency for large, established companies to try to design the legislation to suit themselves at the expense of competitors.
Important to note that Delrahim seems to be signaling openness to such an idea rather than calling for it.
Big: In saying he doesn’t want to second-guess past merger approvals without the facts, Delrahim says it would be “useful” to go back and look at whether Facebook and Instagram should have been allowed to merge. “Maybe we should look and do a retrospective of these transactions."
Responding to charges that antitrust isn’t up to handling “free” dominant services like Google and Facebook, Delrahim cites broadcast TV as a similarly free product that regulators are very familiar with. (DOJ recently took on Sinclair et al. for allegedly distorting ad markets.)
On Facebook’s plan to integrate WhatsApp and Instagram, Delrahim says he isn’t “familiar enough with what that means” to say if it necessarily merits greater antitrust scrutiny.
Merger filing fees helped cushion the blow of the shutdown at the antitrust division, Delrahim says.

@ashleydrixey Once you can stream VR titles from the cloud to a wireless headset at 4k / 60 fps, the computing power problem sort of goes away becomes much more a question of accessibility.
@mblafkin Good question. I have no idea.
@ashleydrixey Exactly! But what I want to know is, how many people who start off playing Candy Crush ultimately go on to, like, building their own rigs to play CS or CoD? (Extreme examples, but you get the idea.)
@ashleydrixey You’re hitting on a really interesting Q about how people come to gaming and whether their first platform remains their primary platform. I don’t have the data but would love to learn how many casual gamers become hardcore gamers or migrate from mobile to PC over their lifetimes.
@ScottBrownDC Scott.
And don’t forget! Amazon already has a wealth of experience running a cloud services business, with a little thing called AWS.
@ashleydrixey Epic is trying to go around legacy app stores and could threaten Apple and Google’s revenues that way (as we noted here: https://t.co/UaUAKK0BZZ). But game streaming is a whole new paradigm for content consumption that could eventually make Fortnite a dinosaur.
And what about Amazon’s relationship to the firms that make the games on its platform? Amazon’s cutthroat approach to business is already well-documented.		If you’re a big game publisher, you might be able to hold your own. If you’re an indie company? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
One thing we’ll just have to see play out is what game streaming will do to the price of PC hardware. Are GPUs going to get even more expensive as home builders have to compete with Amazon as it builds massive facilities to render a gazillion copies of The Witcher simultaneously?
Second, this shift could come at the expense of companies like Valve, GOG, GMG and the Humble Bundle just as gaming is going mainstream and spreading to players who lack the high-end PC hardware to play AAA games. Valve especially could find itself in trouble.
A couple of early thoughts on this. 		First, with MSFT, AMZN, NVDA and GOOG all working on game streaming, the future of software could end up belonging to these massive platforms, reinforcing their enormous power.

At some level the Chinese propensity to 忍 kind of becomes unhealthy. I've seen it drive people to an unproductive level of self-pity. But it does help explain why some white people react with surprise at what aggrieves minorities.
Missing from the English translation is the cultural baggage that a native English-speaker would completely miss out on. 		Same goes for the word 忍, which roughly translates as "to endure or bear," but really connotes a sense of suffering an injustice over and over—with a smile.
Superficially, 吃苦 does translate as literally "eat bitterness." But those two English words barely scratch at the sheer amount of abuse and anguish the phrase implies in its original tongue.
You know how in other languages, there are terms for things that in English would take a whole sentence to describe? Or maybe doesn't have a way to describe at all? This is one of those examples. https://t.co/oYGSt31Sgy

This change gives colleges another way to fulfill their obligation to verify the incomes of some financial aid applicants that the government says need greater scrutiny.

But the language of shutdowns — which characterizes some workers as “critical” or “essential” and others as essentially dispensable — has a potentially insidious effect on our democracy beyond the fact of the shutdown itself.
