RT @marklutchman: How come Tim Tebow was not allowed to kneel in prayer before a game but a whole team can kneel to insult the country?
@marklutchman Wow, I never thought of that. You're right Mark. Tebow kneels to thank God.... The NFL kneels because they are tired of criminal THUGS being jailed or shot because they can't obey the law. The NFL is kneeling for THUG LIVES MATTER... not Black Lives Matter.
