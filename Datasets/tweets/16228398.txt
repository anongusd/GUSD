@CitizenChgo I agree on the cohen hearing. She asked the most impactful questions.  But the new green deal has a lot of missing details. And no bias.  I'm a huge fan of hers. I believe you question every politician and look for the signal in all the noise
@ejdickson @BarbaraCorcoran Confirmed.  I love BC
@DantesEdu I think she is great.  I may not agree with everything, but she does her homework, questions authority and makes people think.  That's what we need more of
@LoLMarcus__ Any politician can propose legislation. Very few get  passed. And how often do you feel your representatives have proposed legislation , that has a chance of passing that represents what is important to you ?
Very interesting discussion. Are Politicians Observers/Critics/Supporters  or Doers ? What exactly do Politicians do in our country today beyond Commentary ? Is proposed legislation "doing something " ? Curious what people think about this. https://t.co/MlP0Dbj3ZY

@willhoughteling Agree. 2. The goal of the  state should be to max out student opportunity and graduation rates over student  convenience.  All public schools in a region  should be required to work together to maximize results,  cost effectively
@willhoughteling Agree. +Time to stop thinking of public  schools as unique entities. There is no reason for 3 state  supported schools within 60 miles of each other to all offer a sociology/sports management/psych,etc  major. Let each specialize and eliminate duplication
@saragoldrickrab Not as Stark as PA, but 5k to 13k variance in Texas https://t.co/KMx3zV4Fev
@dougwebberecon @saragoldrickrab @TylerAguilar_CA " big donors can be coaxed to build new buildings". The issue is they keep adding buildings that will end up being future maintenance issues.  I told IU I would not fund any new building. It leads to tuition increases.  I made them put the Media Center I funded in existing space
@saragoldrickrab @TylerAguilar_CA @dougwebberecon They were state underfunded in total  by 203m since 2011 (172m that year ) or about 29m per year shortfall.		Their tuition revenue Per Year went from 577m to 838m per year . 		Are you sure it's not as much a spending issue as a state funding issue ?
@thecla923 @saragoldrickrab @scottokun But not the amount you can borrow from other sources.
@TylerAguilar_CA @saragoldrickrab @dougwebberecon They raised tuition 2% or about $300 x ~40k students, or $12m   while their funding from Pa increased $4.5m to 155m .  If their net effective rev per student is about $15k that's $ 600m per year in revenue.  Why are the still so state funding sensitive ?
@saragoldrickrab @dougwebberecon I don't have a position.  I have not done any work there
@saragoldrickrab So why not combine West Chester and Temple and possibly Cheyney into a single University that serves the Philly region ? Cut overhead, reduce tuition and take some of the savings and enhance support for low income students ?
@saragoldrickrab @dougwebberecon First, I'm for more public dollars for schools,  if they become more efficient  in  they spend it. 2: Per Student is not a good metric. Students aren't widgets. There isnt a hard cost for each new student added.  It's a stair step cost function.
@saragoldrickrab Are PSU, Pitt and Temple worth paying about 2x the tuition of a  PASSHE school ? And the variance is dramatic in other states as well
@saragoldrickrab Do you have data you can post that shows both total amounts to schools as well as per student amounts ? I'm also curious why there is such disparity in tuition across public schools within the same state . Thanks

@JoeSaluzzi @WSJopinion I've been solicited multiple times to save small schools including by @BernieSanders wife for a school she was vested in . There will be 81k fewer high school graduates plus the number who look to trades rather than college .  That will impact freshman entrants
@run8111 Schools who want to be the designated college will bid on that right . The state will choose which one it will use
@Summatimesail @BernieSanders said all oubkic universities and colleges should be free. That's where it came from
@RyanNevin9 How do you deal with hiring plumbers and tradesmen that work for / with you ?
@JoshPincus1 @CodyJacobs No. There would be one designated school per region that won a bidding process with the state.  Maybe they require the first 2 yrs are a comm college and offer the remaining required classes for degrees . This would keep the chosen school from being too big in urban areas
@Indyvnzla81 He said every public University and college should be free. But just tuition and reduced cost loans for the rest of expenses If needed. 2/3 paid by federal taxes. 1/3 by state
@CodyJacobs I also think that having a free option school will force all other public schools to be more efficient and push their prices lower.  The challenge is that free schools could become mega schools so the best route may be to use Comm Colleges as required feeders for 1st 2 yrs
@CodyJacobs I think where you went to school is becoming less of an issue because recent graduates aren't looking for careers.  So companies need a steady stream of applicants and they will use nontraditional (AI) ways to qualify them.
I support a free 4 yr college option for everyone. I don't support all colleges being free.  Big difference . All colleges being free would be a financial disaster https://t.co/PVjSt7exlp

@abgutman They also have 80m people vs 350m and  is a little bigger than New Mexico. Scale is hard and a reason while smaller by geography and population  countries have had the ability to be more flexible with social services .
@abgutman I did a lot of reading on Germany's healthcare. Some things stood out. Under gov ins rule they won't pay for Dr checkups from 18 to 35, and then 1 check up every 2 yrs.  You can't have private insurance unless you make 59k euros. Lots of limitations. Very different than ACA rules

@Jasonearthstri1 @abgutman How come I never get invited ? No trilateral commission invites , no secret societies .  No one invites me to shit.

Maybe. When I did our hiring,  I preferred  hiring from affordable schools.  Smart people are smart, no matter where they went to school . https://t.co/hyoj6CLXHe
@abgutman Yes it is. Which is why  community college should be free and I think 1 University in every region should be free.  But if we try to make all 4 yr schools free the cost of school to taxpayers will skyrocket and suck money from healthcare and childcare.
"According to  the National Center for Education Statistics, average in-state tuition at a public university is $6,131. "  So maybe it's an issue of how and where we encourage students to go to college ? @AOC		https://t.co/jB85cneST6 https://t.co/Y2gZNsBUQs

@ldWesty I was a bartender
@TheGoldman Most community colleges do offer training in trades
For the sake of discussion, what would be a fair in-state, annual tuition that would be low enough that there would be no need for free tuition ? There would still be financial aid for those in need.  What should that number be ? https://t.co/7wj0a9cPQ2
The operative variable is ‚Äúper student‚Äù. The total amount of money they get has increased.  The question is the economic value of each student to the state, not the school. Why not incent students to go to a state school with excess capacity? https://t.co/qH1sLRxuMe
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 If we worked at educating kids about wise choices for school, do you think we can get @BernieSanders , @aoc, @JoeBiden  et al to do the same ? So we can apply all the new taxes I'm willing to pay, to healthcare and childcare rather than overpriced colleges for brainwashed kids ?
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 The point is that there are affordable schools, today, that with aid and a job , kids can afford without debt.  Why do you think they choose to go to more expensive schools ?
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 See, we have more in common than you may believe.  Or maybe not. We put 12 people in a hotel room to make spring break work.  So I did get to go on break twice
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 Doesn't it depends on which school u go to ? UNH costs 18,500 for tuition and fees. 84pct get aid, 64pct get grants averaging 10.1k. which means the majority of UNH students pay 7.4k before Room and Board.  How would you gauge the level of effort for instate UNH ?
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 Good for you. You were fortunate enough to have help from your parents and smart enough to get a job as an engineer.  How do we educate kids so that they don't think an affordable school is "beneath them" ?
@cjkadakia @gmfunk @suzanne184 CJ, how much was your tuition per semester ? Where did you go to school ?
@centerfluid @_Henn_dawg That's pretty obvious, isn't it.  Arent those points constant ? Isn't knowing the facts of the past  one of the first steps to addressing change and considering new approaches? I listed 3 items I thought applied today. Did you not see them or did you just dismiss them ?
@PNW_Hawk @GeoffONeil Lol. Thank you for telling me what I don't understand üòÑ what I do understand is how college economics work today.
@centerfluid So you are saying college was free back in the day ? Or did you miss the point of my post ? Happy to discuss the current state of post high school education .
@densindente Read the part that says I had to take out loans.
If it was free for boomers why did I have to take out loans, always have a least 1 job, take off a semester to work, work every summer, live on a budget and then struggle to pay off those loans after I graduated ? https://t.co/p2A9vgcPQx
1. I wasn't always rich.  	2. I'm for free community college &amp; 1 free 4 yr per region	3.

@SandyCannold @CNBC @steveliesman The startup and innovation economy is strong enough and AI is changing all industries fast enough that there are always, again, IMO, investments and acquisitions that create better opportunities for cash/debt/share deployment than stock buybacks.
@SandyCannold @CNBC @steveliesman I'm not an economist, but I don't think you can put the economic interests of shareholders and the company ahead of the CEO and management making the decision to buy back shares.  I think there are inherit conflicts in the decision making process
@SandyCannold @CNBC @steveliesman I think the goal of NON founder CEOs of public companies is to maximize their personal wealth first. CEOs typically have 1 company and fewer than 20 yrs to maximize personal wealth. So they try really hard to do so. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. Just,IMO, reality.

@chesterBirdbath @RobertHogan @Ben10Brown This is cheap ? https://t.co/TwQd7iYWS0
@cranky_traveler @LeviHarris That‚Äôs not really how the math works. And the administration cost is dramatically lower than the ACA because there are no insurance companies and all the complexity they add for administration of contracts and payment requests
@LeviHarris Yes. And people who aren‚Äôt working are on Medicaid or Medicare already. This is for people who qualify for the ACA
@camsicle @LeviHarris And I‚Äôm pretty sure people know how to say Single Payer when they mean Single Payer :)
@camsicle @LeviHarris The program is designed for people who qualify for the ACA.  Here is the math. https://t.co/IMU4kkutlI
@LeviHarris When you do the math, the ACA moneY that will go from the insurance companies to the care providers will more than pay for the unpaid balances by consumers and leave enough in savings to add more services and support those in the most need.
@LeviHarris Maybe we need to make it clearer Under the plan , you would NEVER pay more than 10%.  And that‚Äôs only for higher incomes.  Lower incomes would pay 5% or less   Any unpaid balances would come from the subsidies already in place for the ACA.
@LeviHarris I have no problem paying more in taxes. But I do care how it‚Äôs spent.
@LeviHarris If you took every penny from every billionaire in the United States (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 2 Trillion dollars ) it wouldn‚Äôt pay for healthcare for 2 years. And come the third year , what do you think happens ?

@HaydenGise What he proposed was Single Prayer Health Care which has been mislabeled as Medicare for All
@HaydenGise How do you consolidate thousands of plans from private companies ?
@RyanSublett1 Those are all run by private insurance companies who change the premiums and networks and complicate the choices annually. Is that what you envision for Medicare for All ?
@TRoth62 Most people choose insurance they can barely afford and often leads to them not having enough money for their deductible.  Then what ? There are better options coming
If your savings are less than your deductible  , that‚Äôs just as much of a catastrophe https://t.co/muVrhJlWrK
So when people talk about Medicare for All  as a great solution for healthcare , ask them which Medicare program they are talking about and how and who will offer it to all.  Here is some background for those who like to read https://t.co/vWClQaq35M
Medicare Advantage programs are capped cost programs that lead to tens of millions of payment and care denials every year.  (25m to hospitals /1m to patients) They can be a smart option to traditional Medicare, but it‚Äôs not a healthcare panacea.
Making it available to All doesn‚Äôt really solve our Healthcare problems. The fastest growing segment of MediCare is Medicare Advantage, which are thousands of programs offered by PRIVATE insurance companies and are incredibly profitable for those companies.
For those excited about Medicare for All, realize there is no such thing as plain Medicare that covers participants health care needs.  Traditional Medicare is a complex jumble of options that can require significant out of pocket costs that is more than most have in the bank
@HandicapperBill @KenKnopp1 Medicare isn‚Äôt a catch all term. Medicare Advantage has thousands of plans , all of which are run by contracted insurance companies  and are incredibly profitable for them.  Traditional Medicare leads to medigap ins. From ins companies as well
@LeahHoustonMD @HPECDAO @SharkTankABC If blockchain is your selling point you are doing it wrong.

@TRoth62 Single payer isn't built on private insurance .
@RobertDean42 @AOC @ASlavitt No it's not. Most people don't have enough money to pay for their annual put of pocket
@HandicapperBill It doesn't.
There are far better ways to improve healthcare outcomes for the individual marketplace (ACA eligible individuals ) by reallocating ACA resources from insurance companies to direct to provider payment  solutions . Stay tuned cc:@AOC @ASlavitt
Insurance , whether public or private, has NOTHING to do with health/ wellness. It's purely a financial instrument.  Insurance coverage as a  proxy for effectiveness of healthcare programs is one of the greatest lies ever told.  Having insurance won't make you healthy. https://t.co/RfvpJAPzWJ

19 years since  I bought the Mavs. Crazy how time flies.  		And I arill get nervous before every game 		Here is some B Roll from interviews my first few weeks .   		 https://t.co/BKOetIgDNs
This doesn't just apply to esports . It applies to all startups. https://t.co/W9vB7tAj2L
Traditional sports are always driven by talent.  Always. It's never the league https://t.co/8RQQkC82C8
@thedannyfalcon We give thousands of tickets to kids every season.  I'm more interested in building connections to the Mavs than maximizing revenue.
That said, my kids friends don‚Äôt know anything about OWL and their use of black ops, OW and all but rocket league has disappeared. Anecdotal, but it keeps me digging to learn more about what 7 to 15 year olds are doing with their time so I can earn more and more of it
True. The reality is that the expansion of Gaming/ESports is a threat to traditional sports fandom. 9 year olds know more about fortnite than the NBA, which means I have to work harder to support youth basketball and grow it in a manner that connects young kids to the NBA https://t.co/ZuWqJbH4pn
Their best models are @realmadrid and huge brands that have built global followings. Even there, the vast majority of teams won‚Äôt reach that level of success Unlike soccer the greatest fandom concentration is in Asia where it is much harder for US based teams to build a base
It‚Äôs not to say that Esports can‚Äôt make good money.  Many do.  But that‚Äôs a result of smart business people and great team talent, which is much harder to scale. Particularly with the newness and uncertainty of publisher change
IMO, it‚Äôs because they want to be in on the ground floor of heat they hope are skyrocketing valuations comparable to NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL.  Unfortunately they forgot 1 key difference, team owners own the league and it‚Äôs IP.  ESports Team owners don‚Äôt.
ESports Teams, particularly in the states are now a VC/Investor backed industry.  It‚Äôs beyond rare for investors to give huge valuations to companies that don‚Äôt own their IP.
That‚Äôs what happens with games. People become attached. It‚Äôs a social vehicle.They like being good at what they are good at.But that is a different issue than the economics and continuing challenges of esports teams https://t.co/roeVvDXGKZ
@JackEtienne No one will start a league with a momentum game with out expecting it to crush it.  The consequences you describe don‚Äôt appear till it‚Äôs too late.
@JackEtienne look how much it cost to be in the game.  it will happen again with another publisher when a new game hits that is tailor made for esports, blows up with consumers and charges even more than OwL to be part of it knowing that if the major teams don‚Äôt pay to join they lose status
I‚Äôm not saying they go away, but w/ each new game that takes attention it gets increasingly difficult for teams.  OWL won‚Äôt be the last made for publisher league.  You have to serve so many masters: Publishers, Talent, Investors, etc whose interests don‚Äôt always align w your team https://t.co/RKwOpPwcq6

@Kevin_Hitt @natenanzer @QuartzAtWork @overwatchleague That's how guys burnout. IMO they last longer now because the money has improved and the teams are more proactive and professional. But working 70hrs a week in season when you can quickly lose your spot is super stressful
@natenanzer @QuartzAtWork @overwatchleague How often does the game change ? How much time is required to adapt and perfect as a team after a change ? And do all teams globally approach practice time the same? I'm far from OWL smart , but look at the Brigite change  The NBA doesn't make meta  changes mid season
The core  issue is that the games change.  With each change every team has to practice as a unit and consider every permutation.  That requires intense practices and a lot of time .  It's the main reason I wouldn't buy a LOL team . Support is great. But doesn't change the issue

@ReformedBroker @JamesMarsh79 @AndySwan So protect people from themselves so they have to use a 3rd party ? That's a little bit of self interest :). Until FinTech gets to the next stage.  Of course we can blame a lot of the ipo struggles on the SEC.  They are run by lawyers and it shows
@ReformedBroker @StockHunter140 Come on josh.  Instead they put their money in ETFs without understanding the liqudity issues.  Stocks are certainly not for everyone but that isn't a good enough reason for not having more IPOs from growth companies
@awealthofcs Ok. Let's pick a different period. In 2012 there were about 4800 listings. We are down 1000 in less than 6 yrs.  Certainly not microcaps.  And look at the pct of IPOs and listings that are foreign based.

@opinion_joe @bopinion We all look for ways to kill boredom.

I can‚Äôt wait to see what @hqtrivia will do w gambling
@opinion_joe @bopinion And, immediate gratification lottery plays, prop bets and more. Think big online  players like Walmart or Amazon or ?  giving better odds for small bets to drive retail product sales.  A lot will depend on state laws of course, but tech will enable new opportunities driving value
@opinion_joe @bopinion And your answer is: Bets will eventually be integrated directly   into the  delivery of content, creating fees for rights holders (or leagues/teams) considerably increasing viewership, revenues , fan base and franchise valuations

Hello Puerto Rico @ San Juan https://t.co/HIhFra1v9U
@ercowboy @Neoavatara @MDaware Lol. Ive herniated multiple disks. No surgeries.  Never had a surgery or additional diagnostic as a result of the blood tests beyond synthroid and reducing NSAIDs  Never even had a follow up exam as a result.  It‚Äôs the data I wanted.i do this to reduce my need for care.
@realdocD @mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Your seem to be presuming I don't have a doctor that also sees the results and in my case orders the tests.  Am I correct in thinking this ?
@thehowie The disconnect is that I do the blood tests and collect data to REDUCE  the number of trips to the doctor and care I need
@thehowie I have always been clear that this is for data aggregation purposes and elective, paid for by the user.  What's interesting to me is how much Drs seem to mortally fear their peers misuse of testing and data
@cranky_traveler I write a check
I truly enjoy my Twitter engagements with doctors who conclude first, ask questions.....never https://t.co/ZboWy0Bouh
@CVOBryan @mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Spend time with them. The blood testing I'm suggesting is elective and not covered by insurance. So it's reasonable to ask the patient to do homework and discuss it with them given the provider is being paid for their time
@DrMcInnisDIT @mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Costly = health consequences expensive =$
@realdocD @mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current I'm glad I found the only doctor who understands this, and just my luck they are on Twitter ! It's a good day.
@daviesbj @mksheikh @BenMazer @JAMA_current I tried that. Didn't work. I take synthroid
@realdocD @mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current You really are a doctor. Diagnose first. Ask questions later.
@FonsieMartinez Lol. No. But that was a great eps
@DoctorYasmin I had already read both. Did you see the study that dismissed the value/impact of a series of blood tests over an extended period of time on a patient‚Äôs health ?
@DoctorYasmin @michaelbmarlin @TroKalayjian @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Agree. Take a single test or two and your doctor jumps  to conclusions, worries about CYA, orders unwarranted surgeries.  Your concerns about your peers is exactly why I prefer to do the tests on an ongoing basis. No single  test determines anything
Unless of course  you can afford it and want to better understand  your health.  Don't ever go to a Dr that summarily dismisses your interest in your health. https://t.co/i4CFfRsHBB
@MDaware I also said this is not for everyone , but for ANYONE WHO CAN EASILY AFFORD THE TESTS AND THE DOCTORS WITH THE TIME TO DISCUSS RHE RESULTS
@MPKalina @mksheikh Yes , but I‚Äôll say it again and again. I‚Äôm not recommending this for everyone.  I‚Äôm recommending this for anyone who can EASILY AFFORD THE COST OF THE TESTS AND DOCTORS WHO HAVE THE TIME TO DISCUSS THE TESTS.  I say it every time we do this and it gets ignored every time
@MDaware You really didn‚Äôt read what I wrote did you ?
@MDaware That‚Äôs not what I said. I said having a baseline of results allows me l/anyone to avoid rash decisions  and have better indications of changes in health over time
@mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current I take my printed results I get from my doctor and put them in a spreadsheet.  It‚Äôs easy to see what‚Äôs going on.
@MDaware In my experience, it‚Äôs the  exact opposite   But I have great doctors
@MDaware Having a baseline of results means I don‚Äôt get false positives. If my results  deviate there is a good chance I know why. I can adjust and see a change in my next test
@MDaware My turn to be arrogant.  They are wrong. For those who can easily afford the cost, emphasis on easily, having a historical baseline from ongoing tests allows my drs to make far smarter decisions than if they only can compare a new blood test results to my demographic comps
@mksheikh @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current I get that it‚Äôs hard to determine the right amount of tests/data across a large population. Mistakes are costly,expensive or both.  Uninformed /overzealous patients complicate Drs decisions. However, Educated patients shouldnt be dissuaded from managing their data/health.
@TroKalayjian @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Isn‚Äôt bad decision from any amount of medical data , including nil, harmful ?
@dochocson @daviesbj @BenMazer @JAMA_current Responding with my experience. What would you call your tweet ?

Correct. The owner of the account sees all data. The public does not https://t.co/WEGhh09T7k
The quickest way to reduce the impact of bots and trolls is to remove the number of likes and retweets shown on Twitter posts and likes on FB. They are easily gamed by bots, but are seen as indications of authority.

@astepanovich So if FB/Twitter distributed their authentication dbms to multiple independent parties, blockchain style, you would be ok with authentication ?
@astepanovich But the reality is that almost everyone receives/ pays their phone bill In a manner that reveals their identity. And those identities may not be in a single dbms, but there aren‚Äôt that many carriers.
@astepanovich And I hope you know I‚Äôm not trying to be rude. Just further educated. This is obviously and important and difficult issue
@astepanovich With the exception of burner phones, what places are phone numbers not only tied to identity but also not tied to physical location ? What percent of mobile users do you think take precautions to protect their identity ? And where are the numbers stored for fb/Twitter 2fa?
@sshotbot @astepanovich Lol. Thanks tweet police bot  :).  While you are at it, can you make yourself useful and correct my typing mistakes ??
@astepanovich ‚ÄúTend to recommend against ‚Äú ? Isn‚Äôt SMS 2fa, which they are attempting to push to every user, effectively the same as my ‚Äúworse idea of the day‚Äù just less obvious ?
@astepanovich It‚Äôs in reference to account identification.  Each user of SMS 2fa has a phone number associated with the account.
@evacide @Twitter @facebook You realize the conflict I‚Äôm sure.  you trust Twitter to get it right at some level. You see the platform as an opportunity for free speech/outcry/change. Yet, you don‚Äôt trust them to make changes to improve the platform despite writing a blogpost suggesting specific changes
@astepanovich Then it becomes a question of whether FB and twitter are utilities that everyone can use as they see fit, or private entities, doesn‚Äôt it ?  Separately, How do you feel about SMS 2 factor for FB/Twitter? Is it protective or a means by which a user can be identified ?
@astepanovich Then it becomes a lack of trust in Twitter/FB to protect identities of users from harmful entities ?
@astepanovich First, you realize I'm ok with using any name or profile picture ? Whether it's single or multiple accounts ?
@astepanovich I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that once you saw "real names" you stopped reading
@evacide @Twitter @facebook How would you feel about "opt in" anonymity , where a user elects to be anonymous while agreeing to a more stringent standard of conduct, evaluated by trained humans that explain why content is removed ?
@evacide @Twitter @facebook The same can be said of account security. Do you / EFF recommend that at risk users not use 2 factor authentication ?
@evacide @Twitter @facebook Im not saying your handle has to be your real name.  So is your concern that Twitter will reveal information to law enforcement/gov entities ?
@jasnell @benwerd There are a variety of authentication options available that Twitter could adopt internally or via an independent 3rd party
@jasnell @benwerd Let me ask another question.  How do you suggest vulnerable parties secure their Twitter or any social  accounts ?
@benwerd Notice I didn't say the users had to use their real names as their account handles. Just that a real person and not a bot was responsible for the account
@violetblue @mozilla You probably should read what I wrote
@anildash What does "real name solution " mean to you ?
@anildash The amazing part is that you didn't ask a single question. You dictated as fact your position ,you called all involved incapable and subversive and presumed you knew exactly what the right answer is, with a hint of conspiracy theory thrown in.  Thanks for the feedback.
@Kasparov63 Doesn‚Äôt matter how many accounts someone has. Just that there is a person responsible for them
@anildash @Twitter I think they can.  I obviously think they should. Whether they will ? It will will depend on how much pressure they get from users or future competitors
@anildash Solve? No.Reduce extremism and threatening and accusatory behavior significantly yes. For the marginalized , Getting help still requires being seen which isn‚Äôt easy. @twitter could provide a sandbox for the marginalized to seek help from human rights and support organizations
Not what I said. Pseudonymous speech would be effective for 99pct of users and still be available. And last time I checked, the MSM was still using bylines and can be questioned and challenged  by anyone and everyone. @hunterwalk https://t.co/MluCXy2Rdr
Twitter could create a sandbox that is exclusive and separate to anonymous tweeters that is monitored by human rights and support organizations.  No one trying to protect themselves should feel or be endangered. https://t.co/rXl64cnkZt
@dgwbirch That‚Äôs not enough.  It‚Äôs not as much what someone sees about themself as what is said about them. See Pizzagate as the perfect example
No one can express their political opinions on twitter without fear of repercussions. Not me. Not anyone.	 The twitter of 2018 is not the twitter of 2011. https://t.co/CNQokjI8CY
@jeffjarvis @MikeElgan It was a different world for social networks in 2011.  Both were truly social rather than news driven. Usage far less so the disaffected stood out  The same thing could not happen today.	 Governments have the experience they didn't back then. Bots would swamp those in need
@MikeElgan @jeffjarvis Doesnt Someone anonymous wanting to convey something of substance (other than media)  first have to figure out a way to connect to a real person who can confirm that the person or content is real ? Otherwise it's just one more random tweet
There are 1k ways to protect the identy of a confirmed individual and prevent the release of the information.  The questions would be whether you trust @twitter and whether @twitter is the best or only platform for anonymous speech https://t.co/Zd5Cw3yKk5
Dear @jack , if @twitter were to eliminate bots and accounts individuals won't put their  real names behind,  your revenues and user base and usage would skyrocket  as a result of users and advertisers feeling safer on the platform https://t.co/Opo8hYiLfk

3) The Net is no longer a monolith. If you have a legal  blog , site or small biz and some stupid ISP discriminates against you, FB, Google, Medium and any number of apps will give you a home under their umbrella while your EFF lawsuit against the ISP is in court
2) if the big ISPs did the inconcievable and blocked or slowed websites, the consumer backlash to all their other businesses (they are all conglomerates now) would be so devastating, their stock prices would get killed and Amazon/FB/GOOG could buy at a huge discount
Let's be clear on NN. 	1. No ISP can mess with anything that impacts Apple or Google.  Both control the app stores/hardware and operating systems which control the mobile universe (the fastest growing segment of the net and the future w 5g)
Dan, let people know your background and history with the net. https://t.co/V1ek5zftQV
@TXFL Bad habit. I know I have to get rid of it. I do it in conversational interviews.
@AdamDasky @EFF They don't fall under this aspect of the FCC , but yes the big incumbents always sue to prevent disruption  and the more regulation the easier it is to sue.
@AdamDasky @EFF And for the vast majority of people how they configure their WiFi and access and the number of users on their house has greater impact on their speed
@AdamDasky @EFF Hace you asked them ? I'm curious to see what they say
@AdamDasky @EFF Or the trucking companies that would be disrupted could sue to try to prevent autonomous commercial vehicles from having "fast lanes" for connectivity and prevent or delay that industry
@AdamDasky @EFF Limited how? Just you ? You wish you had more speed ?
@AdamDasky @EFF Not true. That's the hypothetical that is thrown out in defense of NN. Have you ever noticed anything like this happening on the net in your experience ?

@chhopsky @Silence17Dogood Didn't their greed open the door for us to offer Network Services and for CDNs to proliferate ?
@chhopsky @Silence17Dogood All good  I'm for NN principles (ex fast lanes ) , and believe it or not so are big ISPs. Where it goes wrong is having the @FCC as the enforcer.  The @fcc is so partisan anything is possible. I would rather believe in the "anything is possible " from innovation than from the FCC
@jthorndike That said, it and when AI disrupts enough jobs, we will be discussing FDR and his New Deal quite a bit
@jthorndike So shouldn't the goal be to solve the problem rather than pander to perception ?
@chhopsky @Silence17Dogood And designed the networks to implement mcast tunnels for streaming clients    I guess we didn't run into each other
@chhopsky @Silence17Dogood Except I negotiated and bought peering agreements and paid ISPs to implement multicast for streaming.  I guess you didn't care about your customers.   We did
@jthorndike Doesn't the gov left pocket already borrow from the right pocket on an ongoing basis ?

@rob_sheridan @gravit8ed I hate cigars. The only ones I have ever smoked  were to celebrate our championship
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 8) I‚Äôm not a free market cures all guy.  There are good regs (EPA/FDA/FTC), and  dumbass regs. 	I‚Äôm all for NN principles and they have been enforced when violated for decades. I think the NN ruling can be a Trojan horse for unscrupulous politicians. That scares me worse
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 7) I also think there will be significant technological opportunities created by fast lanes. I get there are potential downsides to it. But as a tech guy I see more upside from innovation than downside from Corp stupidity
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 6) When I look at the dysfunction in our government and title 2, it‚Äôs not giving them control of the internet and related tech, but it opens the door. I see that as a risk with far more negative consequences than the risks you are concerned with
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 5) When I look at the risk of the millions of people you say could be disadvantaged by ISPs I don‚Äôt see why they would start now after not having done it in almost ten years and getting abused when they did
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 4) would you admit that there is risk that the @FCC could be used politically to interfere with technological progress on the net ?
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 3) I agree with NN principles. But in 30 years of networks and the net, there are less than 10 examples of ISPs overstepping and they were dealt with.  Maybe the changes made a few years ago won‚Äôt have an impact one way or another , but...
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 2) I think there is greater risk from the gov screwing up an internet that has changed the world and should continue to produce world changing tech and networks.  I could care less about ISP profits. It‚Äôs unfortunate I‚Äôm on the same side as them.
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 Just the opposite.  You are making my point. The internet is not broken.  It has worked just fine and changed the world. You think there is great risk from the big ISPs to harm their customers and ignore the unserved.  I understand that risk.
@Silence17Dogood Don‚Äôt know about the Canadian company but the first two were corrected via customer/Media  pressure within 2 weeks and the last one is backwards. ATT had the right to throttle Bandwidth under the network management terms of their regulation.
@rob_sheridan @dukebradford5 How do you think the internet got to where it is before NN rules in 2015 ? Why didn‚Äôt everyone suffer prior to the change ? How were you able to build your business ? How was Patreon able to be built prior to NN ?Instagram ? Etc etc ?
@ammori You win the dumb analogy of the year award.  Just remember, only you can stop web surfing deaths
Which facts and policies?  I think the upside prior to Feb 2015 was greater than the downside risks of FCC/Gov intrusion/Regulation after. History says the bogeyman of "you will be charged more or cant reach a website" to sell NN is wrong https://t.co/HgNs6Fgj1T
@jonshiring Look how mesh chat clients were used in China and other gov controlled regions during protests.
@jonshiring Wrong
@edwardbrowden He is proposing we go back to the way things were prior to 2015.  Want to list all the amazing advances on the net before  Feb 2015 ?
@feliciahsiehsw I've been involved with mesh for probably 4 years now. I do.
@mfratto What misinformation ?
@natproach You are allowed to do a search for mesh networks
@stokesmayo Open source it.  Everyone's phone can be a node. Don't raise a penny. But it requires a lot of work....
@jakepalenske The point of mesh is that anyone can contribute a relatively cheap node to grow the network. The ultimate screw ISPs solution with plenty of open source code available
@cwellsl1 20pct of homes as of 2015
@HunterAwilliam Lol
@jakepalenske It doesn't require licensed spectrum to create a mesh network
Why don't you create a mesh network that operates  outside the control of the companies you hate and peers with the net wherever you choose ? Get everyone to donate a node and change the game ? https://t.co/QlwJY1i863
@rollaacostaa The exact opposite
@B_Sungam It's both. Local regulation entrenches ISPs but there is a growing willingness to change those local rules. Responses to Federal rules are driven by expensive lobbyists.  An ISP strong point
@TCReckless How do you explain what is happening in high speed wireless/5G ?
@KarlBode You don't like big ISPs. I get it. Most people don't. I happen to think that the regulations that got us from our UUNet days to Feb 2015 will work better than what we have had since.
@KarlBode Right.  I forgot I should always defer to you because you are the final arbiter of what works. It's obvious and I just missed it.  Let's forget my experiences. You are the master. My bad
@KarlBode Nor does Let the Government do what it wants. However let technology continue to be enhanced and investments to continue without more government rules to inhibit that investment , is a good thing.  There is a place for good gov regs (EPA/FDA/Others)   This isn't one of them
Actually dominant ISPs are dominant because of regulation, not in spite of it. No one takes advantage of the rules  better than incumbents.  Isn't that the underpinning of much of what you've been saying ? https://t.co/vtMT0SWx2J

@rob_sheridan @davidfrum @AjitPaiFCC No. It's those of us who started with nothing and grew our biz around the explosion of digital that know that Net Neutrality would have PREVENTED services like FaceTime , VOIP, and pioneers like CompuServe, AOL and Prodigy

Let them manage how your biz does
@rob_sheridan @davidfrum So you think the internet will be better with the FCC becoming the government's Dept of the Internet? Deciding what happens on the Net? As opposed to what has happened over the last 30 plus years without it ?
@J_TheHoff @davidfrum Have you ever been denied/slowed access to a legal site ? Ever had a site of your's disadvantaged? Know anyone who has ? Think digital applications over the last 30 yrs haven't changed the world ? Without regulation ? Think we need a Dept of the Internet (FCC) ?
