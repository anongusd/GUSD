Cummings is now shouting at members who said this was the first Oversight hearing. It wasn't - they had ones on prescription drugs and voting access.
Cummings says he's from Baltimore and "When you call someone a rat, that’s one of the worst things you can call them because when they go to prison that means a snitch."
Cohen "Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power
Corrected: Meadows responding to Tlaib: “There is nothing more personal to me, my nieces and nephews are people of color, not many people know that”
So Tlaib called Meadows a racist. Then Meadows got outraged. Then Tlaib said she wasn't talking about Meadows, but "someone." And then Meadows accepted her apology. And that's how this hearing is going to end.
Tlaib just said that bringing in a woman of color who worked for Trump to prove he isn't racist is in of itself "a racist act"
The way the Oversight hearing room is set up, Reps. @AOC, @RepPressley and @RashidaTlaib basically have their own little section of seating - like their own cool kids table.
Republicans now entering into the record for the Cohen hearing tweets and articles written today criticizing Cohen and the hearing. This is where we are folks.
RT @peteschroeder: This "Lord of the Flies" reboot sucks. https://t.co/YlrHHJnvWN
Things are getting hairy here at the vending machine area in Rayburn a floor down from the Cohen hearing. Only one machine with drinks is working and your chooses are Red Bull or milk. People are getting desperate.
Cohen says he was a Democrat until Steve Wynn found out he was a Democrat and made him switch parties  in order to be the vice chair of the GOP finance committee.
All of the sudden in the Cohen hearing there was a flurry of photographers taking pictures, not of Cohen. And I was like, "What's happening?" Turns out @AOC was talking to someone. And that prompted a flurry of shutters.
RT @sbg1: Good point. Is he credible if he supports Trump on these claims? https://t.co/eOkpjsArXY
Cohen says "Not only did I lie to the American people, I lied to the first lady" Says Trump called him once and "He had me speak to her and explain to the first lady, I don’t feel good about any of this and this was not my intention."
Cohen says "Mr. Trump does not have email… Mr. Trump doesn’t text message"
Cohen says they rigged a @DRUDGE_REPORT poll to make Trump the leader.
@JaimeBintheICT I think only members are bound by that - so a Super PAC could. (Also what they do is use news coverage of the clip.)
Cohen says that he used a home equity loan instead of cash in a bank account to pay Stormy Daniels so that his wife wouldn't find out and ask him about it.
Democratic committee staff say that Republicans cannot simply yield and let Rep. Gaetz ask Cohen a question - there would need unanimous consent, which fair to say is unlikely to happen. So maybe, he's just lurking behind the members where Cohen can see him?
If you’re Cohen testimony drinking game included consumption when you hear “book deal” I think it’s probably time to call it quits.
It seems Republicans have made their focus on generating their own soundbite assailing the Democrats or Cohen. They aren't really trying to provoke him to say something.
Cohen says he doesn't believe that Trump ever hit Melania and that he isn't aware of an "love child"
This is remarkable. https://t.co/hAmOyrDBZO

Rep. Gaetz is now whispering wtih Rep. Massie and Republican committee staff. He's clearly gunning for a chance to hop into the questioning.
Rep. Matt Gaetz just returned to the hear room. Entered from the Democratic side of the room and is now in a staff seat behind Rep. Meadows.
It's clear that Republicans are laying the ground work to have their response to Cohen's testimony be "He's just doing this for a book deal or a movie/TV deal"
@stanford1978 @HotlineJosh @realDonaldTrump And surprisingly (maybe) not a single Republican has brought that up.
Jordan says "wow, just wow" in response to Cohen saying he's spoken to Schiff about which topics he could testify about. Unsure if Jordan actually thinks that's unusual, or he's hoping the public does by just saying "wow."
Republicans on the Oversight Committee have asked Cohen more questions about his possible book deal than about his accusations that Trump committed crimes.
@CourtOConnell Sometimes I think I forget men got elected last year too....
Apologies! Rouda is new too. https://t.co/AjhgMFkTUh
Rep. Katie Hill is the first of the new House Dems to get to question Cohen.
Cohen in replying to Amash "He doesn’t give orders, he speaks in a  code and I understand the code because I’ve been around him for a decade."
Rep. Amash has a very different tone and tact compared to other Republicans. Says he's unsure if he believes him, but asks about Trump.
RT @waltshaub: Rep. Meadows accuses Cohen of lying on his Truth in Testimony form, claiming the form asks about foreign contracts, because…
Rep. Rouda asks Cohen where exactly investigators could find Trump Organization documents - Cohen says in a storage unit.
In middle of Cohen testimony, Warren campaign announces that if elected, she won't commute or pardon anyone implicated in Russia investigation, including "no pardon or commutation for Donald Trump himself."
Republicans clearly think they've found their ace card here against Cohen. Meadows says that Cohen testified today he did work for a foreign bank. But that in the documents he submitted ahead of today's hearing didn't disclose that work.
Rep. Cloud says going to prison for three years and then getting a book deal "That's not bad living."
Rep. Connolly says that the argument Republicans are using to undermine Cohen would make every conviction of organized crime "null and void."
Rep. Virginia Foxx wants Michael Cohen to swear under oath that he will never make money in the future off a book or movie deal. Can a member of Congress do that? Would that be binding?
Cohen says of Trump "You don’t know him, I do. I sat next to this man for 10 years and I watched his back. I am the one who started the campaign and I’m the one who in 2015 continued to promote him"
Rep. Hice asks if Tom Steyer is paying any of Cohen's expenses. He says Steyer isn't paying.
There are just so many politicians today railing against lying. These are campaign ad makers favorite kinds of soundbites.
Cohen testifying that after the Access Hollywood video broke showing Trump saying he grabbed women by the pussy, that Hope Hicks called Cohen while he was in London and asked him to start calling reporters to push back at the story.
Interesting how Cohen uses the word "we" in talking about Trump's 2016 election win. Says the Moscow tower was, "worth 100s of millions of dollars, and we never expected to win the election, so this was just business as usual."
Cohen "Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin, but I’m not really sure I can answer that question in terms of collusion "
Debbie Wasserman Schultz - who was embarrassed by the wikileaks hacked emails from the DNC - is now questioning Cohen about the email hack.
Standing against the wall in the Oversight hearing room is @mattgaetz - its still unclear if anyone is going to let him speak. But he was watching the proceedings.
Cohen "I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people today."
With the caveat that I have no idea how this looks on TV - but here in the hearing room, Cohen has held the attention of the members who had advanced copies of his remarks. Often these remarks are annoyed, members talk or do other things. Not today.
Cohen says that Trump repeated to him "That his son Don Jr had the worst judgement of anyone in the world." He says that Trump didn't trust his son to oversee important meetings.
Cohen quotes Trump as having told him when discussing his medical deferment during the Vietnam War, “You think I’m stupid? I’m not going to Vietnam?"
Cohen: "I never heard Mr. Trump in private say anything that led me to believe he loved our country."
Cohen "This is a man who calls himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the college board to never release his grades or SAT scores"
Cohen "Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person and I respect her greatly and she did not deserve that"
Cohen "[Trump] told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid, and yet, I continued to work for him."
Cohen "Individual No. 1 is president Donald J Trump"
Michael Cohen is sworn in before the House Oversight Committee. https://t.co/64qr5fSuSu
Jordan has now blamed the Cohen hearing on Tom Steyer. And discussed the dossier. So this has gotten there real quick.
If you're playing Cohen hearing bingo, go ahead and put the card away. We've already got to "Clinton." Jim Jordan less than a minute into opening remarks: "Lanny Davis choreographed the whole darn thing, the Clinton’s best friend"

As a former college debater myself, I would watch a parli debate round of former debaters now in the Senate - could have bipartisan pairings and also include Ted Cruz and Chris Coons. There must be a fourth in there.
Elizabeth Warren gets asked about bipartisanship in Washington and starts with a statistic about hearing loss and I am reminded she was a college debater and that she still can structure her answers like she's in a round.
Warren mentions NH Senator Jeanne Shaheen in answer about trying to lower the number of veteran suicides.
For the record, Warren didn't really have an answer about protecting an independent press. Focused instead on voter access and the judiciary.
The second question for Warren in New Hampshire is about protecting an independent press.

Warren in NH "My mother always referred to me as “the surprise” and I was about 30 before I realized what that meant."

That moment every four years when you walk into a town auditorium with the black piped curtains and the American flags and the brown folding chairs and you think, "Oh yeah, we're doing this again already."
Do you think the word “lobbyist” has ever been used this many times in a presidential campaign launch speech?
@AlexDe_Luca You maybe don’t ride the train enough. Cause it’s a constant problem.
Warren is announcing in a city that is 77% Hispanic in front of a crowd that’s probably 75% white.
Warren "And that is why I stand here today: to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America."
Actual applause line in Warren launch speech, "And today, there are no children working in factories."
If @joekennedy were giving this speech in another setting, it probably would have stoked talk that he might be running for president himself.

Trump running at Democrats plans to investigate him: "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.  It just doesn't work that way!"
So Trump thinks the House investigating him will affect the economy?

Bloomberg says America needs border security, "I think most Americans do not want open borders where anybody who wants to walk in here can walk here. I think most Americans want to help refugees and we should distinguish that from immigrants."
Bloomberg "I don’t think we have to choose between bold ideas and pragmatic leadership."
Bloomberg "I’ve said to Pelosi, who I think has just done a spectacular job pulling Congress together..."
Bloomberg says of VA Gov. Northam, who is in the room, that on the gun issue, "The governor has really been a big hero, deserves a lot of credit."
Here's one you don't hear often. Bloomberg says, "As the best president in my lifetime, always respected him, was Harry Truman..."

Hickenlooper coming after Biden is a real study in contrast in speaking styles. In case anyone forgot that Biden is a natural orator.
Hickenlooper at Mayor's Conference "I’m not quite to that point of announcing I’m going to run for president of this country, but I do think being a mayor provides wonderful experience of bringing people together."
Biden references Iowa when talking climate change "What happens in Dubuque when John Deere has nothing to plow?"
Biden on "investing in clean energy" says "The administration has walked away but there is no reason we can’t pull us back on the path."
Joe Biden has reached hands in pockets part of the speech.
Biden "It’s like we’ve divided the country into pieces. How can we be one America if we continue down this road? I don’t care what your political affiliation is."
Biden "We are in trouble but we were in so much more trouble in the past. The American people are capable of doing anything – given them an even chance and they’ve never never never let us down."
This could be partly a product of the audience, but Biden is spending a significant amount of time touting the stimulus bill. Which isn't something one hears talked up in Washington very often anymore.
Biden on Washington "We’re in a situation now where, as a couple of my friends out there who worked in our administrations know, this is a pretty dysfunctional town, to state the obvious."
Biden on his relationship with Obama "All kidding aside, we were like brothers, it was a completely open relationship"
Biden on the role of mayors (but, of course, speaking in a room that has a dozen reporters trying to guess if he's running for president) "No one has ever accused me of being coy."
Pretty sure Biden just casually said "shitty" two minutes into his remarks at the Conference of Mayors winter meeting.

“Arguably, you sold your country out,” Sullivan told Flynn. “I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense.” 		Dispatch from inside the Flynn sentencing with @JanNWolfe https://t.co/pEaDUIja1a
Just a rat designed to look like Donald Trump riding down Pennsylvania Avenue after the Mike Flynn sentencing hearing. https://t.co/vrStwxTsYU
All of this and Flynn takes Judge offer to delay sentencing.
Judge dials back some of the explosiveness in Flynn case, "I wasn't suggesting he committed treason, I wasn't suggesting he committed violations, I was simply asking questions."
Prosecutor in Flynn case: "the government has no reason to believe the defendant committed treason."
Court back in session for Flynn sentencing.
Judge to Flynn: "All along you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as a national security adviser to the president of the United States. Arguably that undermines everything that flag over that stands for. Arguably you sold your country out."
You're coworker is sick, editors said. Can you go cover a quick sentencing hearing, they told me. Won't take more than a few minutes, they insisted. Sure. Right.
Flynn sentencing now recessed until 12:30 so Flynn can talk to attorney.
After warning that Flynn could face jail time, the judge then asked prosecutor if Flynn could have been charged with treason.
Flynn prosecutor declines to answer whether Flynn could have been charged with treason given the seriousness of the charge - when asked by judge.
The judge in Flynn sentencing just struggled to pronounce Mar-A-Largo.
Flynn's attorney says the reason the sentencing memo argued that he wasn't told lying was a crime and that he didn't have an attorney was to argue that Flynn's case is different from others - like G. Papadopolis.
The judge is making the attorney and Flynn basically walk back some of the assertions in the sentencing memo.
Judge is basically making Flynn re-plea guilty because of the challenges made in his sentencing memo.

6. In conclusion, can we just not have a national discussion in which we suggest some people aren't "Hispanic enough" because of their language skills? Great, thanks.
5. To the 4th point, find me the voter who says, "I care more about a candidates language skills than I do about their positions on jobs, the economy, health care/national security/climate." I would like to meet this person and study them.
4. In 2016, there were two Hispanic candidates who spoke Spanish - Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio (plus Jeb spoke Spanish too). That didn't help them, did it? I'm not saying it hurt them. But language really just isn't a factor for most voters.
3. What Hispanic voter is going to care that a Hispanic candidates doesn't speak Spanish? None. You think there's a group of Mexican-American voters in Texas that are going to abandon one of the first Mexican-American candidates because he doesn't speak Spanish? Unlikely.
2. What non-Spanish voter is going to care that a candidate doesn't speak Spanish? None. No president before spoke Spanish. Do we think white/black voters are going to just start demanding Hispanic candidates speak a language they can't understand? Unlikely.
1. Being able to speak Spanish isn't a requirement to being Hispanic. When my mom and I were growing up (especially in rural Texas), it wasn't considered an asset to speak Spanish. That has changed. But most Hispanics in Texas likely have a cousin who can't speak Spanish.
Lets have some real talk about the "criticism" of @JulianCastro not speaking Spanish. And I'll preface it real clearly with the fact I'm a Mexican-American from Texas who speaks really terrible/limited Spanish and had to learn because I wasn't taught as a kid.

@mg81992 I understand that - I'm pointed out the inconsistency that is going to start tomorrow in the breathless "Will she or won't she be speaker" speculation.
You would be hard pressed - it may be impossible - to find a House seat that Pelosi cost Democrats, despite millions of dollars in ads spent invoking her name. But could find several that she probably helped pull across the finish line with ads.
Nancy Pelosi oversaw a wave in the House. Chuck Schumer over saw the loss of seats in the Senate.  But how many "plugged in" Washington reporters have been and tomorrow will continue to speculate about replacing Pelosi and never breath a word about nixing Schumer?
Fox News going bold. Call the House for Democrats.

@JerriAnnHenry That's basically how it feels.
Pete Stauber - MN-8 congressional candidate - has a TV ad in which he's wearing a button-up collared shirt, a V-neck sweater and a short-sleeved, zip-up vest. That's a lot of layers.
Listening to Joe Radinovich - Dem candidate in MN 08- answer attacks about a marijuana charge when he was 18 makes me wonder if the trend toward legalization makes it less and attack and more a benefit.
The Republican in MN-08 is arguing that single payer health care would hurt unions because it would take away a piece of their bargaining. But I've never heard a union make that argument. Interesting stance.

Skip Sandman - the independent in MN-08 who is Native American - only candidate to address caravan a candidate forum: "Immigration made our country great and we need to open with welcome arms when people come to this country and want to do it legally and request asylum."
Pete Stauber - the Republican running in MN-08 - keeps squeezing Trump slogans into his answers at this candidate forum. He just referred to himself in the third person and now I can't help but wonder if that's also him talking like Trump or he just talks that way.
Of all the campaign fundraising email lists I'm on - and I'm on a whole lot - Josh Hawley's campaign sends by far the most and the most desperate sounding. He may not win a Senate seat but he wins the fundraising volume contest.
If nothing else, it ensures everyone is talking about the issue you want the most attention paid. Seems like a no loss move - unless you think it fires up the opposition but it didn't the last time, so why would it this time? Or so goes the thinking.
Call me crazy. But if you wanted to get people motivated to vote for your party, why not declare you were going to take action on the issue you think most motivated voters in the last election and then let the media frenzy tell people you would need Congress to begin to do that.

I wonder how terms being used to describe these protests of mainly women "violent" "mob," compare to those used to describe other protests comprised primary of women - like suffragettes, bra burners, ERA.
One more thought: The theory that these protests will see an overwhelming backlash is in part based on the idea that when women behave badly and are impolite, there are ramifications. Consequences greater than what could be gained by misbehaving.
@J_estOfDees Every time I've watched an LSU game inside the US Capitol they've lost - so I'm at my desk today and have now switched the volume from the Senate to CBS!
Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed 50-48.
Having covered Tom Carper for years, I always assume he's late to a vote because he got sidetracked chatting with someone.

RT @cspan: Protests in the Senate. 		C-SPAN does not control cameras in the Senate.
There is also some basic assumptions about political power one has to be making here - that women can only be so angry and that their anger can only go so far. Which suggests a limit to their political strength. Easily offset by a court debate.
@dwallbank Arizona is on the 2018 senate map!
So much of this reminds me of people who dismissed the tea party in 2010 because they were "old people who were going to vote anyway"
@PO4Cascade Strikes is an interesting point - but a strike causes discomfort for otherwise unaffected people - you can access services you want. That doesn't really factor here.
And if so - why didn't the Tea Party protests generate a backlash of pro-Obama voters turning out to counter them after they protested him?
Are there that many examples of public demonstrations that ultimately resulted in political backlash to the extent that their opponents won?
Maybe one day this will be one of those political observations I'll look back on as being totally wrong. But I just can't in my mind figure out how all these images of angry women demonstrating in front of the capitol is a political net gain for Republicans. Maybe I'm wrong.
@AJNoiter @astros I didn't imply she should shut up - I was implying she spoke long enough for the Astros to score two - but not three- home runs.

So forcing someone with a history of addiction to testify if beyond the pale. But insisting a sexual assault victim testify isn't. Is that the take away here?
It is telling the dynamics at play that Ted Cruz - in a tough reelection fight - hasn't sounded like Lindsey Graham during this process. Angry indignation would be a natural fit for Cruz - but he's not going with that tone.
I clearly missed the accusation that Kavanaugh was running a drug distribution ring. Is Lee leveling a new accusation there?
Sometimes I wonder when I listen to people talk about those accused of sexual assault if they think that those who commit assaults then walk around with a sign around their neck letting everyone else know. And not that they keep it a secret.
The Senate Judiciary Committee  - after Republicans argued Dr. Ford wasn't to believed unless he came forward and testified - now voting that a letter from Mark Judge saying he knows nothing is sufficient and testimony isn't needed.

Carson basically making the case that accusations against Kavanaugh are part of the left efforts who "don't like what America is and what it represents" and are trying to take the nation away from "godly" principals.
Ben Carson now saying Puerto Rican school officials are ignoring SCOTUS orders not to have prayer in public schools
@jamiedupree But why? There must be a reason one is here in an official capacity and one isn't. Or maybe not. But it seems like there should be...
Again! Carson says "speaking in my own personal capacity." Didn't get that disclaimer from Pompeo. Who told Carson who couldn't speak as a cabinet member but Pompeo could?
Introduction of Ben Carson at Value Voters begins "He comes to speak to us from his personal capacity." Did his boss tell him he wasn't allowed to use his title, you know, the Secretary of HUD? Did no one tell us he's not the HUD secretary anymore? Did I miss a tweet?
Dispatch from Value Voters: Conservatives warn of Republican complacency ahead of U.S. election  https://t.co/YsnHFMfl4O
So Pompeo is speaking at Value Voters Summit as the Secretary of State. But Carson is described as "Dr. Benjamin Carson, Former Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital (appearing in his personal capacity)*"
Know what you can always depend on as a reporter? Getting mocked and insulted when you cover events like this.
Earlier I asked Tony Perkins if he would support @SenJohnKennedy if he ran for LA governor and he said he was focused on national issues. I asked Perkins if he would make his own run and he basically said "we'll see."
Bauer "women who have men in their lives... shouldn't want a country where after a lifetime of decency the man in your life could be ruined by a woman stepping up and saying 36 years ago this man did this to me. That's not what America is about."
Bauer now mocks trying to report a sexual assault 36 years after the fact. "It's unproven and I would argue unprovable. There are reasons why most crimes have statues of limitation."
Bauer on Kavanaugh opposition "The left is scared to death that at some point there might be 5 justices on the supreme court who may actually make a ruling that could save some babies"
Okay, saying "Sen. Feinstein" draws as many boos as saying Kamala Harris at Value Voters. I sense a theme.
Bauer describes the protesters at Kavanugh's confirmation hearing as "acting like little Nazis" and criticizes the Democrats for not stopping them.
Simply saying Kamala Harris's name on at the Value Voters Summit draws boos from the crowd - probably more than any other name said so far.
Gary Bauer at VVSummit now bemoaning that someone's 10 year old might see Cory Booker on TV and think "breaking the rules" is acceptable.
Gary Bauer now suggests that Clarence Thomas made senators on the Judiciary Committee urinate on themselves when he testified.
Gary Bauer, president of American Values, at Value Voters is now talking at length about Anita Hill. "Clarence Thomas is a fighter."
McConnell basically just told Value Voters Summit that Ford's accusations are a distraction and that the Senate will "do our job" and confirm Kavanaugh quickly.
McConnell at Value Voters Summit: "In the very near future, Judge Kavanuagh will be on the United States Supreme Court. Keep the faith, don't get rattled by all of this, we're going to plow through all of this and do our job."
McConnell then suggests that if Dems want off to campaign in October they're going to have to approve more federal judge nominations.
McConnell is saying that he traded weeks off during August recess for Democratic approval to confirm federal district court judges.
McConnell at Value Voters Summit "Look how angry the left is, the angrier they get, the better we're doing." Or the more of them who are going to show up and vote in November. But that seems to be missed sometimes.
Which - to be clear - is Bachmann suggesting that American companies that do things she doesn't like cease to be American.
Michelle Bachmann is railing on social media "tech titans" saying "are they even American companies anymore?" Makes me ponder for a moment what would have happened had she stayed in Congress.
For some reason there are people who think it's acceptable to attend conservative conference, sit in the press area and applaud at the speakers. If that happened at liberal events, trackers would be filming and posting online. #NoClappingInThePressBox
Value Voters Summit now talking about Karen Monahan and Keith Ellison - comparing it directly to Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh.
Value Voters Summit digs count about 45 minutes in: The media (2), Dianne Feinstein (1), Colin Kaepernick (1).
Tony Perkins kicks off his Value Voters Summit by mocking Diane Feinstein for not going public with Dr. Fords letter soon enough. Lots of laughs from the crowd.
This is the second time I've seen Mary Millben perform the extended version of the National Anthem and I'm still not sure where she's getting all these extra words. It's like three or four extra minutes. #vvsummit

Klobuchar asking about potential crimes by a president uses both the "he" and "she" pronouns to describe a generic president.
Sen. Amy Klobachar now questioning Kavanaugh - the first of the likely 2020 contenders to take a round.

44 protesters and they still catch me off guard and make me jump a little in my seat. https://t.co/IYofjpyCUc
The crowd of protesters are overwhelmingly women - and of all ages and races. These women are clearly angry. And they have been saying so for 1.5 years now. The media and political observers shouldn't be dismissing what they're seeing.
Political types tried to write off the tea party as grumpy old people who were going to vote anyway. Similarly, writing off what we're seeing now in places like the Kavanaugh confirmation as angry liberals who would (or wouldn't) vote anyway, is probably just as unwise.
A lot of people are shaking their heads and wagging their fingers at all the protesters disrupting the Kavanaugh hearing. But you would be remiss to write it off as rudeness and not realize the real anger on display that is going to have a real impact on the midterm elections.
@pjkellyct That's a good question - I'm actually unsure that's the case. The court does have its own rules. And writing legislation to mandate disclosures on briefs probably would by a constitutional violation. I think the court has to do it themselves.

@KMG_VA That may be true of their time as government employees. But we're talking about their time as campaign employees - when they were working for Trump, not the American public.
Can you violate an NDA if you're not telling the truth? Does challenging someone for violating an NDA imply what they've said is truthful?
@Deepblueusa123 They weren't government employees on the campaign. Some of them became government employees later.
Right now, former Trump campaign staffers have no idea if the non-disclosures they signed are enforceable. If the Trump campaign loses trying to enforce Omarosa's, it could open a flood gate of former staffers who then feel free to talk. Big risk.

@BernieUpstateNY @NancyCooperNYC @DougJones The difference between McConnell controlling the Senate and Schumer controlling the Senate is huge. Like massive. For example, the difference between a vote on a gun bill or not. Jones helps democrats achieve that.
@BernieUpstateNY @NancyCooperNYC @DougJones Lamb and Jones will caucus with the Dems. And support democratic leadership. They may not vote with the party every time. But they help the Dems control their chambers. And control of the chamber is control of the agenda.
@cassbakes I suspect he’ll be cheered for winning a seat Trump won by 20 points. Caucus members who crticize Pelosi aren’t new. He’ll have a lot of company.
And let’s be clear who this spin is targeted at: Journalists and donors. Journalists so we don’t write stories about what this means for the fall. And donors so they don’t stop funding difficult efforts. Voters don’t care about polls and places on the spectrum.
This notion that a Lamb win doesn’t mean anything because he ran as a moderate is also more spin that should be ignored. It means Democrats are running candidates who reflect their districts. The purity tests of the Tea Party cost them seats. Dems seem to have learned lesson.

Inslee jokes that contributions to DGA are robust, but if they slow down "we'll get some bitcoins."

Gov. Inslee on Dems focusing on redistricting "It has been an awakening. Our team has been a little asleep at the switch and we have not been as aggressive as we should be."
Governor Jay Inslee says DGA is today announcing spending $20 million to help elect Democrats in states where redistricting could be an issue - NV, CO,  WI, MI, OH, PA (already Dem), VA (already won), FL ME. All state Obama won.

@PollsterPatrick They are now on the offensive - that's a new strategy for them in the wake of a mass shooting.
One clear take away: the NRA doesn't think their previous tactic of remaining quiet in the wake of shootings and ensuring they're strongest supporters are still with them. They clearly think they're losing ground. This is the behavior of a group that is worried about losing.
Loesch at the NRA has called for not letting "crazy" people get guns. LaPierre is now repeating the argument the NRA has been making for years now against the things Loesch said should be done.
If you thought the NRA might say, "Here is where we can find common ground with the other side" after this shooting, you would be wrong. I think they're saying instead, "The other side is evil. They want to destroy all of America."
NRA's Wayne LaPierre now going after the FBI. This is really remarkable when you think about it. He's trying to make the case that if someone isn't with them, they're for socialism.
This isn't just a gun speech - it's a full-on political speech that seems to be invoking that American freedom is under attack just as much as guns. Clearly trying to gain support by invoking a bigger message. https://t.co/8YjoGZeG29
For the last several mass shootings, the NRA has remained very quiet in the wake, going into hiding. They clearly are abandoning that strategy now. This is the most aggressive and political we've seen the NRA in the immediate aftermath of a shooting. Its a new day.
Last week a television on my desk that had a feed of a political speech suddenly switched to images of a body being rolled out of a school. Wasn't the first time that happened. Can assure the public, no one in a newsroom loves when that happens. We do wait to we get home to cry. https://t.co/pH8od9ribv
Really, what the NRA is saying, that this is really all about them. It's really just an excuse to attack them. It's not about anything else. It's about the NRA. Do they really think that? Or is it a tactic to make it debate about the NRA and not about actual gun policy?
I know she wasn't at the NRA during the gun bill debate in 2013 - but she either isn't aware or is choosing to misrepresent that the NRA opposed provisions she's now saying Democrats wont' support but did in 2013. https://t.co/pz9oTx4rJf

@TalKopan @DougHeye I think all violence is pretty gruesome. But that's just me. I've covered a lot of dead bodies left lying in the street in my cub reporter days. I can assure that gang violence (not MS13) was pretty awful.
@TalKopan @DougHeye That would make it an EVEN smaller percentage. I'm being generous and likely overstating.
So saying MS13 represent all immigrant children is like saying the population of Delaware represents all of America. Or that 1.2 members of the US House represent the entire chamber. Just a little math.
Lets do math. If there are 10k MS13 members in the US. And there are 3.6M undocumented children immigrants (best estimates I could find). And if all the MS13 members were undocumented children immigrants - which they aren't - they would represent .28% of that population...
I'm trying to imagine if all policy decisions about populations of people were made based on the actions of the worst segment of that population. Its an interesting mental exercise.

It's 6 p.m. and all the sudden lots of activity on the floor of House and Senate. Coincidence that it's the same time as the evening news?
If, as Trump is now arguing, Democrats who won't let Trump build a wall are responsible for every murder committed by an illegal immigrant, does that logic extend to everything? Would Trump be responsible for all crimes committed by people his administration let in the country?
Trump campaign just dropped a new ad that states "Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants." So that's where we are today.
This was all theater on the Senate floor - everyone knew going in to this exchange that none of this was going to happen. Just motions and objections for the sake of motions and objections.

In the Senate chamber for this little back and forth: McConnell, Tillis, Wyden and Stabenow. Not seeing any other members hanging out now.
McConnell now responding by making a motion to vote on the CR - seems like Wyden is set to object. This could be all the action on the Senate floor today.
Just now, @SenStabenow tried to move to fund CHIP and community hospitals off from the full spending bill. McConnell objected - said Dems could allow the CR to move forward.
What if Trump just wrote a personal check to the Treasury to keep the Smithsonian open for a week? Or to reopen the Statue of Liberty?

If you tossed all the write-in votes, Jones wins by about 2 percentage points. So I’m unsure how that math works to help Moore. Doesn’t trigger a recount even then.
So Moore’s message is god wants him to win so if he just waits they’ll find another 20,000 votes?

@CRPerry13 @DrewShirleyShow @AGirlintheSouth The argument is that the minute risk of one possible outcome should allow rampant discrimination. It's not different at all. It's exactly the same. And they're both ridiculous.
@CRPerry13 @DrewShirleyShow @AGirlintheSouth Ding Ding Ding. You're right. It doesn't make logical sense. Because it also don't make logical sense that male bosses would refuse to be alone with their female employees. I'm glad we all agree now.
@DrewShirleyShow @AGirlintheSouth @CRPerry13 If you believe that 1. Some women lie about sexual harassment. So that 2. Men are justified in never being alone with women coworkers. Then you must also believe that 1. Some men sexually harass women in the workplace. 2. Women are justified in never having women in the workplace
@DrewShirleyShow @AGirlintheSouth @CRPerry13 By the extension of your logic you are also saying that 1. Some men sexually harass women in the workplace 2. Men should just stay out of the workplace to prevent any abuse of women going forward. Right?
@CRPerry13 @AGirlintheSouth @DrewShirleyShow Also, everything Terri said is correct. It marginalizes women when male employees can be alone with their boss and female employees can't. It's that simple.
@CRPerry13 @AGirlintheSouth @DrewShirleyShow Incorrect. If men didn't sexually harass women, then the victims wouldn't have been harassed. It has nothing to do with having dinner with them. That's absurd.

This tax panel with Mnuchin and Marc Short feels like a workshop/practice session in messaging on tax reform...
At @FreedomPartners event, WH legislative liaison Short says of tax reform: "It’s largely a jobs bill in many cases."
Broken up. But those were 5 really great innings pitched by Marquez.
I've seen a perfect game. And these 5 innings in Nat's park from Marquez have been phenomenal.
A D.C. Cab (E505) keeps rolling down his waving money at out uber driver to taunt him. So strange.

@JohnWilliamDeo Totally - but I'm saying 50-vote margins wasn't his problem today. Won't be his problem on taxes.
Because they totally could have passed that health care bill with a 51... oh, wait. No. Still didn't work. https://t.co/63xFDaWjM8

I'm not sure when a 50-vote procedural vote became historically the hardest. Missed that piece of Senate history....

@rossleonardy If you think that no one is allowed to say anything about the vote there is a distinction. Honest debate requires honest portrayal of events
On optics, this move by Democrats to wait and all vote no is an interesting one.
@rossleonardy I can assure the gravity isn't lost on me. But lets be clear - no one dies on the pounding of the gavel on this vote. Lets not distort.
Mike Pence teed up to break another tie. @JoeBiden, who loved the Senate, never got to break a tie. Is he watching with envy?

That was not how I thought that at bat would turn out.

@stoic_4u It was pouring down rain at the time. Thought the game was going to get called.
That was probably a walk off homerun in the 5th....

@brianmctaggart And there's the delay. At least I don't have to walk in the rain now.
@brianmctaggart is it looking like a rain delay? Or still hoping to start in time?
Okay good. Tomorrow I'll be in Camden Yards. Please don't make it such a nail bitter @astros
Okay Houston. End this.
Sorry Machado. I still don't think the Astros will trade for you.

@AstrosCounty I feel asleep watching and woke up to that alert of final and was really confused. So confused I got on Twitter to check
FEC chairman now asking what the commission would do if they found wrongdoing. I'm confused. Can't they file civil complaints?
FEC's Hunter says FBI has their number and can call her if they want her expertise, she's not going to volunteer.
FEC Commissioner Hunter: "I have no interest in calling up Bob Mueller"
FEC's Hunter says Mueller telling FEC about their findings "the odds of their sharing any information is not small, they're zero."
Several @FEC commissioners seem to think that no other government agency investigating 2016 would want to tell them about the findings...
Commissioner @EllenLWeintraub regarding 2016: "What I am reading in the newspaper suggests there are campaign finance issues."
This election commissioner is kind of making the case that the election commission would be out of line to investigate an election....
Hunter says it's "hard to believe" the FEC would try to "wedge" into foreign govt. election meddling investigations.
FEC Comm. Hunter describes FEC investigating 2016 election meddling as "investigations that we have no expertise in whatsoever"
Little surreal to listen to the FEC debate whether they should get/need security clearance to review 2016 election...
FEC Comm. Goodman is pointing to H. Clinton reports that she talked to foreign leaders during the campaign. Seems to be comparing to Trump?
Without talking about @DonaldJTrumpJr specifically, @EllenLWeintraub making case for reviving FEC reviewing election rules in wake of news.
Weintraub also says the FEC commissioners should get security clearance - this is the agency Dems hope will look into @DonaldJTrumpJr emails
FEC Commissioner Weintraub says no staff at FEC has security clearance - says to look into 2016 that they should.

Still weird to cheer for the AL.
@HolmesJosh That is true. It just made me nervous. Maybe because I watch him play everyday.
@HolmesJosh Really? I just want to keep shouting "stop talking and watch the ball!"
