@Brick8105 @IsaacsThane @realDonaldTrump A true patriot questions the system. Sheep like you just follow along.
@funylibertarian When the US places a puppet government...there is no taking control. The point is that we create these issues for ourselves and then blow it off and look the other way when the consequences read their ugly heads..it’s it’s 20 or 30 years later. There’s always consequences.
@funylibertarian And when the displaced and abused citizens come running for some any kind of aid..we shut down shop and pass the buck.
@funylibertarian Just like we funded al qaeda to push out the Russians in the 80s and 20 years later we have to fight terrorism. War is a racket. And we create these conflicts and send troops to fight for “freedom” so a bunch of old men can collect a huge check.
@funylibertarian Ultimately. It was our overthrow of the Sandinistas that created that social climate for them. So are we to take no responsibility for any of this? I don’t want them here btw. I just think people don’t see the bigger picture. Maybe I’m just a lunatic.
@funylibertarian Imagine how bad things have to be before you decide to try such a bad idea.
RT @End_TheFederalR: The left... "Obama wouldn't do that"		The right... "Trump wouldn't do that"		The Truth... "They both do that"
@funylibertarian Imagine how bad it is where they come from to willingly go through all that just to get away from it.

@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian You can call me daddy.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian No. You have no valid arguments. So you think it’s trolling. Truth is a hard pill to swallow. But like you said earlier. You don’t have it in you to accept reality.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian What freedom
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian @what_freedom
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian I know you just like to see black people being arrested.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian I know you’re racist. You don’t have to hide behind cops and the law. Be who you are.
@Libertyrefuge @DanMac222 @funylibertarian He used to be a part time security guard. He knows trespassing when he sees it.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Nice deflection. Guess you’re all out of  banter. Who’s the idiot that correlates sitting on the floor with public disturbance.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian You calling the cops on people puts their lives in danger. You should be jailed for an indefinite period.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian You’d rather protect public servants and to hell with the people they are there to serve huh?
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian You swore an oath to defend the constitution and here you are advocating the rights violations of citizens you were dedicated to protect. You should be ashamed.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian I bet you felt like a big man with your security jacket, flashlight, and whistle.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian How’s it feel to extort people that have nothing?
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Congrats Dan..you’re a tyrant.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Telling someone they can’t sit on a floor in a public place is tyranny. Weather she thinks she is special or not. Her rights were violated.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian It’s our right to resist tyranny.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Meaning not every trespass is legitimate.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Sitting on the floor is not a disturbance. The security guard caused the disturbance because she wouldn’t bow down to his command. That’s how cop sucking security guards work. Dan is one of them,
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Cops make false arrests daily. That’s why judges exist because cops will arrest anyone and everyone they feel and make up charges and hope they stick.
@DanMac222 @Libertyrefuge @funylibertarian Yeah arrested but how many convictions?
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Top flight security over here trespassing everybody.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian If she was given a trespass warning that day. She would have had to leave and come back to be charged with trespassing.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Security guards don’t know law.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You went to the military to become a security guard? Lol wtf. I used my gi bill and studied the law. Moron.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You were a security guard. Not a cop.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian If you knew anything about the law you would answer your own question. But you just know what you read in the comments. Believe me I can tell.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian I thought they told her to leave because she was sitting on the floor.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian My .45 is what keeps you out of my house.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You are ignorant of the law my friend.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You can’t trespass someone from a public place if the have business there and are not being hostile or hindering business. She wasn’t at the counter. She was on the floor. To be arrested for trespass you have to be served a trespass warning in writing first.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian That’s an illegal arrest
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian So you arrest someone for hypothetical nonsense?
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Let’s perpetuate the welfare state by needlessly extorting money from people who have no money.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Why are you so special that you can’t walk around someone sitting on the floor?
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Don’t know if you know this or not. But you can disobey unlawful orders.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian If it’s so crowded that there aren’t  any seats, wouldn’t it make sense that people might have to stand (or sit) in areas that might impede traffic?
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You’re just grasping at straws now.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Lol that sounds like the lamest excuse to me.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Or did you mean the entitled people you would be working with? In that case I’d agree.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Entitled people in a welfare office having to sit on the floor with a baby. Yeah how entitled of her.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Thank god for that. You’d be another stain on the badge.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Her kids weren’t in danger til the cops got there
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian Dan has got to be a cop.
@funylibertarian @DanMac222 Her real crime is being poor and black and not bowing down to some moronic security guard.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian You’re under arrest for illegal sitting. 🙄
@funylibertarian @DanMac222 Rules and policy is not law. You can’t just make up rules and then provoke a reaction then say she caused a disturbance. What a load of horse shit. “Everyone else followed the rules” yeah because they’re sheep doesn’t make it right. It’s a public place. She can sit anywhere.
@DanMac222 @funylibertarian What crime did she commit?
@RubinReport Wow people are so sensitive these days. That is not bullying. Lmfao.
@Veyrokx @AP He could have been charged with other crimes that don’t carry a max sentence. Judges add years to make sure there is not way out of prison through parole or appeals. If you have a life sentence and get paroled..you still have to served the other sentences.
@MiMiSantana6 @AP Charged with all other crimes that don’t carry a life sentence. Sometimes it’s added in case the person can be paroled. It’s really just the final nail in the coffin.

@HateManBaby @AP_Politics @AP @MikeBalsamo1 You mean the heroine that was brought from Vietnam on military planes?
@lpnevada @LPNational Further proof that the establishment would rather buy elections than win them.
@brad_polumbo If you’re uninformed you should vote libertarian.
@AP @NFL @pattillmanfnd @TAPSorg @the_USO @wwp @Stand4Heroes If you want to help vets, stop giving to these multimillion dollar companies. Find a homeless vet and help him out. All this money these people get and there are still vets out there that get no assistance.
@will_mcco @AP @NFL @pattillmanfnd @TAPSorg @the_USO @wwp @Stand4Heroes 💰💰💰💰💰💰
@FreeTheWeedTex @TxHopsfarmer @jeffsesh I need these
@nealdikeman Another problem is 46% of the population didn’t vote in the last election. So only a little more than half of the population is actually being represented.
@mslporg These wars aren’t meant to be won. It’s a perpetual profit machine. Follow the money.
@MarkHertling @jaketapper I don’t believe this is completely true. Our military has so many gang members in it...it’s the most dangerous gang in the world. No telling how many AARs and incident reports are written to dispel any wrongdoing. You can’t say for sure.
@theJessLewis @nealdikeman Pretty much saying..bend over for the government. Beto is a crook Cruz is a lying puppet. So you want the people who actually give a damn about us to drop out so your bandwagon vote might have some weight?
@BookWorm2136 @ToddHagopian Stand your ground isn’t a punishment handed down by a court.
@DallasDave515 @CR @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump The 14th amendment was meant to protect newly freed slaves from the abuse they would (and did) receive. Funny how changing or amending the constitution was a great idea when it came to guns..but now that side is saying you can’t change the constitution. Vote libertarian.
@DaveSmith197101 @CR @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump It was put in the constitution to protect newly freed slaves from being abused. It’s outdated just like people say the 2nd amendment wasn’t meant for AR15s. But it is written, so shall it be. All people use the constitution to justify one thing or another.🤷🏽‍♂️
@ChahtaMs @nytimes @Delta Doctors and other medical professionals have an obligation to help when they see someone in distress. Most swear an oath to it.
@PatriciaCLee @Freakyweakywoo @nytimes Found the bigot.
@HateManBaby @AP_Politics @AP @MikeBalsamo1 Reagan started this epidemic. War on drugs...allow cia to flood streets with cocaine and crack to fund the contras.
@CockNotorious @SuperHotSpice @AP Religion is a plague*
@NamelessGhost5 @AP Got to love religion*
@DavidLeeRayII2 @AP Fruits of religion*
@JosefMirna @AP Religion is the problem* there I fixed it for you.
@ScottHech I’ll take shit that never happened for 500 Alex.
@Zamora715 @tedcruz Thin blue line is a gang symbol.
Want my vote? Legalize weed.
@Mark4Gov God I hope you win.
@IvankaTrump People with no kids shouldn’t be penalized for not having kids. Why would I bring a child into this hell? But people with 10 kids will get a bonus.
@karnex47 @JonasPWerner @AngelRodarteJr @SenSanders Wrong. The lifeblood of this country is war and welfare.
@PaigeKubik @APCentralRegion @semissourian Did you read the article?
@BWV988_My_Dream @OtterHimself @KathleenRoss24 @hunterba222 @nytimes This clause was meant to protect newly freed black slaves. Just like some people think the 2nd amendment should be updated..this needs updating too.
@V_Newt84 @CNN ...And not get any citations or charges brought against you.
@jaketapper @LindseyGrahamSC There’s at least 30 countries that grant birthright citizenship.
@Porter4Us This is what the war on drugs gets you.
@miguellevario19 Who is the libertarian candidate for TX-19?
@jezusgurl55 @CNN You can’t serialize projectiles. The numbers would be destroyed upon impact.
@gehrig38 You need to look up the definition of “deport”, before you make more stupid suggestions.
@TommyGuilin @cnnbrk They won’t let us. You can’t whip your kids anymore or the government will confiscate them for profit. #bringbackasswhoopins
@renatamartinell @cnnbrk https://t.co/jMbED6Sq5E
@APHealthScience @AP Yeah but hospitals will charge you 500-1000 bucks for a bag of saline. Lol so that cost could mean anything.
@LPNational I haven’t voted since the 2004 election. But I’m going to register and start voting Libertarian at every chance I get. I haven’t voted because It’s always the lesser of two evils. I refuse to play that game. Voting gold from now on.
@nytimes Some people refuse to vote for the lesser of evils. The whole “if you don’t vote you can’t complain” ideology is ignorant. If you vote for these conniving politicians, you are the one who can’t complain.
@mazie42 @CalebJHull @MarshaBlackburn @LindseyGrahamSC The left wing and the right wing belong to the same bird. Both sides are too brainwashed to realize you’re all the problem.
@idntwannabeseen @AP Ban all religion.
@TxHopsfarmer I lost my doxie Charlie last Sunday. I won’t ever forget him. I feel your pain. They become family and hold a special place. Sorry for your loss.
@nytimes Well yeah..it’s Facebook. That’s what they do. They’re the though police.
@CNN Religion was invented when the first con man met the first fool. Mark Twain
@MeghanMcCain I also lost my father this year. I lost my mother 16 years ago. I feel your pain. It’s an abrasive reality to come to terms with. I’ll never let go.
@Mortedelsan @CNN @kroger *Criminal walks up to front door and sees no open carry sign.	“Damn I was about to commit murder. But  it’s against the law to open carry. Guess I won’t commit those murders then”
@CharltonBeau @CNN An unnamed armed citizen in the parking lot exchanged gunfire with the suspect; neither was struck. Lol why you need more guns?
@CNN “An unnamed armed citizen in the parking lot exchanged gunfire with the suspect; neither was struck.” 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ epic fail.
@SenatorBrakey You lie much, senator Brakey?
@danakparish @tedcruz @GregAbbott_TX @DonHuffines @PeteSessions @lisalubyryan If you want less government you should vote libertarian. Not republican or Democrat
@KristatheYoung1 @TxHopsfarmer @R3DF0X0N3 @CatoEdwards The system isn’t broken. It was built that way.
@LPNational @lisaforliberty The system isn’t broken. It was built this way.
@APCentralRegion @AP All this is proof that elections are bought. Voting changes nothing but a face.
