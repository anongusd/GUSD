@jennifro @BrianCyphers1 @Mhera_ @BetoORourke Uhhhh, actually Texas DOES use paper ballots. Maybe you should check facts before posting anything next time.
I am a survivor. I didn’t report because 1) he’s a marine 2) he was my boyfriend 3) he was drunk 4) I was drunk for the first time in my life 5) who would believe me? 6) I didn’t want to ruin his life.
@JohnCornyn glad you represent the great state of Texas! Thank you for voting yes for Kavanaugh. Innocent until PROVEN guilty. I’m a survivor who didn’t report. I appreciate your dedication to finding the TRUTH regardless of what it is.
@KamalaHarris IT 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 NOT 👏🏻 UP 👏🏻 TO 👏🏻 THE 👏🏻 PUBLIC. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@SenKamalaHarris Lol what a waste. You should have at least voted no.
@KamalaHarris It’s time for the SENATE to vote. IT 👏🏻IS 👏🏻NOT 👏🏻UP 👏🏻TO 👏🏻PUBLIC OPINION 👏🏻TO 👏🏻CONFIRM 👏🏻SCOTUS 👏🏻NOMINEES.
@KamalaHarris #bye
@SenFeinstein as a survivor who did not report, I believe your** actions in delaying providing Dr Ford’s report have damaged the credibility of ALL victims. Shame on you for your delays. This information should have been provided when you received it in JULY.
@BetoORourke Nope cuz I won’t be voting for you. ✌🏻
All the #democrats have succeeded in doing is making it HARDER for victims to come forward! I’m one of the many who didn’t report. And I’m sorry, but the thought of the entire 🌎 dissecting my story is unconscionable. This could have and should have been a private matter.
If #DrFord’s statements are true (and I’m not saying they are or are not), my heart goes out to her HOWEVER. The #Democrats handled this THE WRONG WAY This should have been investigated when they obtained the information. NOT months later when the confirmation was about to happen

@SenSanders If Keith Ellison doesn’t resign his position, the Senate Democrats should all be identified as hypocrites and removed from their positions.
@SenateMajLdr And yet the dems say NOTHING about Keith Ellison and there’s so much evidence corroborating his victim’s statements!
@RepSwalwell @SenateMajLdr And what about Keith Ellison’s victims? I don’t hear you campaigning for them.
@maziehirono What about Keith Ellison’s victims? Funny, I don’t hear you saying anything to or about them.

@RepSwalwell No. They’re suggesting that this should have been brought forward when the senator received the information this summer instead of sitting on it until now.
@tedlieu Dude it was over 30 years ago. Do you remember every detail of a random party you attended 30 years ago? Chill out. Maybe she’s telling the truth. Maybe she’s not. If this info was known in July, it should have been addressed in JULY.

This is my concern! She’s had this information for how long?? Why did she not bring it forward sooner if it was credible?! She’s just using this poor lady’s story (true or not) to get what she wants. Yet she doesn’t give a crap that one of her own coworkers is also accused! https://t.co/DDgsGeWoiO

@GovMikeHuckabee It saddens me to see members of the GOP stooping to the same level as the dems. Hard to be proud of a party that acts like bullies. That’s all either side does &amp; it’s supremely disheartening.
