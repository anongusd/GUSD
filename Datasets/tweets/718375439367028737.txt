@sonnif68 @Aprylsmithts @tomwatson @SenSanders We are studying the candidates; their strengths, their self-inflicted wounds.		There are many stellar candidates.		Gradually, progressive candidates will appeal to the center.	Moderate candidates will adopt more progressive stances.		Social progressivism is essential for Dems.
@sonnif68 @Aprylsmithts @tomwatson @SenSanders Bernie will not recover from the damage he caused with his personal attacks on Hillary.		Hillary 2008 had much better delegate trend. + She was the 1st female candidate campaign and had unique pressures to stay. She campaigned for Obama until the cows came home.		Bernie did not.
@sonnif68 @Aprylsmithts @tomwatson @SenSanders BTW, I support Medicaid expansion. Several versions of M4A do not.		ACA expands Medicaid. Big plus.		I hope ACA gets repaired, public option gets introduced, and transition to M4A figured out while preserving (and hopefully further expanding) Medicaid.
@sonnif68 @Aprylsmithts @tomwatson @SenSanders In 2016, the delegate counts trend showed that BS was off the path to winning by mid March.		He lost primaries by 4M votes and caused serious damage with his personal attacks.		In 2020, the Super Tuesday will be MORE impactful because of front-loading by many states including CA.
@green22bean @suejiron @ybbkaren He ran as a moderate Dem focused on kitchen table issues.	We get more blue votes with Doug than with an R.

@IAmKrishanPatel Yes, for sure. 		I only posted in reply bec. you have tremendous potential, and I thought it was important for you to get that initial reply. 		Having done a lot of diversity training in my life and dealt with weird cases of intent vs. impact IRL, this is blindspot for many.
@IAmKrishanPatel Yes, and those are not the problem of the offended.   And ignorance is insufficient defense.  "I truly meant it as a joke" is also insufficient defense.		We have to actively put brakes on people when we see them having fun at the expense of another person/group of people.
On inappropriate jokes and actions:		Saying and doing things simply as joke because for them and their friends it truly is joke - makes it neither correct, nor the fault of the offended.		Intent is unnecessary for disparate impact; this is the very essence of diversity education.
@IAmKrishanPatel I have to disagree.		Many ppl claim they didnt intend to hurt and say and do things simply as joke because for them and their friends it truly is joke... but it does not make it correct.		Intent is unnecessary for disparate impact; this is the very essence of diversity education.

@iloanya1 Both sides are hurting. I didn't say hurting equally or similarly. No one wants fear of bombs and killings. No one wants themselves or their family or friends to be facing fear of or be in the line of fire.	Recognizing that is 1st step to getting BOTH SIDES to the table for talk.
@towdeanna61 Yes, talking about people in Palestine and Israel wanting to live in peace without fear of war.  Important for BOTH SIDES to come to the table and have some dialog.  Being stuck in blame game and victim-hood claims is not going to help get to peace.

Ordinary people on both sides want to live in peace.		Nothing can be more important than what the people truly want and need - to live their days without fear of risk of harm to themselves and their families.
The mutually agreeable goal CAN be - and needs to be - that there will be no more bombing each other. For good.		For whatever reason, vested interests do not seem to be particularly interested in arriving that a table to discuss the shared interest of peace. That needs to change.

@debrahubert51 @Phil_Lewis_ At this time, if she wants to run for something, I would recommend for her to run for a state level or DC office as first step.  [Same as what I recommended for Hillary Clinton.]  Everyone has to learn and earn their political stripes - it's not easy to run and win big elections.

@thehill @thehill, CHRIS MILLS RODRIGO, It was a matter-of-fact statement by Amy Klobuchar. And yes, there wasn't a lot of campaigning in 2016. It is Amy Klobuchar's competitive advantage in 2020 to promise to campaign and gain back the northern blue wall.
@iloanya1 @JeffersonObama We need all top 5-7 to campaign heavily vs. DJT to win the WH this cycle.   This is not an easy win-the-WH cycle.  It's hard displacing an incumbent who gets news cycle repeatedly.
@iloanya1 @JeffersonObama It will take a lot of work in 2020 to win the northern wall as well win the WH overall.  Nothing is easy this upcoming cycle.  We are working to unseat the menace in the WH.
@iloanya1 @JeffersonObama It is a matter-of-fact.  It would be foolish for her to leave it out. 		(And, yes, I love Hillary and Hillary did wrong in not campaigning in WI, MI.)
