Protester: "Senators, why is Tillerson friends with Putin? Because they both want to drill and burn the Arctic"
Tillerson asserts: "I have never lobbied against sanctions.To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions"
Rubio asks Tillerson if Putin is "a war criminal"; Tillerson says he wouldn't use the word; Rubio now talking about Chechnya
Rubio is really laying into Tillerson. Says he finds Tillersons' answers on future sanctions for Russian hacking "troubling"
Tillerson: "Sanctions are a powerful tool and they're an important tool in terms of deterring additional action"
Tillerson says Crimea annexation "certainly caught me by surprise". Me too, Rex.
Cardin brings up Magnitsky. Asks if Tillerson supports Magnitsky law. "Yes I do" Tillerson replies
Tillerson highlights deep-standing commitment to Boy Scouts - whose trademark phrase is "on my honor"

The Putin-Kudrin back-and-forth/ banter is a call-in tradition. Always fuels rumors that Kudrin is bound for PM role, taking Medvedev's seat
Kudrin shoots back at Putin: Our strategy through 2020 is just a project - it was never ratified by the government. Zing!
RT @NataliaAntonova: In a nutshell, #Putin has nothing much to say to Kudrin. "Hey look, the U.S. has a huge national debt! Look at the Eur‚Ä¶
(So they're not going to go around slashing salaries/ lowering pension ages). It's about "heart" Putin says, not just money/ numbers
Putin answers Kudrin's question thus: "If we keep the trust of the citizens, they will support us and withstand [economic difficulties]"
Putin to Kudrin: "You were one of the architects of Russian economic plan through 2020" (aka if we don't have a new model you're to blame)
Kudrin to Putin: "The old model of growth isn't working and there isn't a new model yet. What are you going to do to create a new model?"
Critical question to #Putin from Kudrin: Russian economy is slowing down, Russia's share of global GDP will go down
Second question goes to former finance minister @Aleksei_Kudrin. gasp from journos. it's a question about economy
This Nizhny Tagil businessman owns a sweets factory and has an awesome mullet

TV keeps showing Kudrin as Putin answers question about whether the government (aka Medvedev) could have done more to help economy
1st @Aleksei_Kudrin sighting on TV - ura!
TV presenter: would you have done anything differently? Putin: you can always do things differently. I think we acted optimally
20 minutes in and #Putin is all macro
#Putin on sanctions: "We shouldn't just withstand sanctions - we should use them to enter into a new stage of development"
"Russia isn't Iran. We're a bigger country and have a bigger economy." #Putin
Putin says he told a meeting of Russian businessmen that EU &amp; US sanctions were unlikely to be lifted soon
Positive demographic trends: births are up, deaths are down #Putin
Now the bad part of the economy: real wages are down, capital outflow has sped up #Putin
Much more optimistic economic backdrop than Putin's last big address in Dec "The ruble is appreciating, financial markets are strengthening"
More than 2,400,000 messages for #Putin - a record!
