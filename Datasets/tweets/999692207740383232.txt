@Liz_Cheney @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer @IlhanMN Also, @AOC has come out and looked at allegations of anti-semitism in anything she endorses, if you looked at her whole twitter feed instead of just cherry-picking a few seconds from her Instagram livestreams.
@Liz_Cheney @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer @IlhanMN Also, while I am do not support everything that the BDS movement entails, to say that somebody is anti-semitic every time they speak about this is just soooo hypocritical for republicans.
@Liz_Cheney @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer @IlhanMN ...has taken against democracy in venezuela, so please don't use the "you're a socialist" response, but think for a minute what the anti-BDS act would actually do to our first amendment rights.
@Liz_Cheney @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer what the republicans are using here is the exact thing that they attacked democrats for doing with the travel ban. Anything that is against the actions of the independent state of Israel is in no way automatically anti-semitic. I am not defending the actions that @IlhanMN...
@Liz_Cheney @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer So... if you are against the limiting of first amendment rights and free speech by going against the bill that would kill the right to boycott the state of Israel, you are suddenly anti-semitic??

@NewsForThinkers Steve King is in the news b/c he is embracing white supremacy and even prominent republicans such as @senatemajldr and @GOPLeader are calling for punishment. Many republicans such as @benshapiro are calling for him to be censured, as there is a possibility congress would do that.
@NewsForThinkers Also, laura loomer is in the news for proving that walls dont work, as she straightup climbed over one to trespass on the speaker of the house.  Rand Paul is in the news for being a hypocrite and going to canada for health issues, after he called their system "slavery".
@NewsForThinkers Trump approval has dropped 3% and only 29% of ppl blame democrats for shutdown, as trump said "I won't blame you for it". Majority of Americans disapprove of trump, dont want a wall, don't see border situation as a crisis. stop spreading ACTUAL fake news
@PhilipRucker That is because he only watches fox news and they gave @RashidaTlaib using a cuss word at a bar almost an HOUR (!!!) of coverage, but gave @SteveKingIA 's comments embracing white supremacy under a minute (!!!) of time. But sure, CNN is fake news.
