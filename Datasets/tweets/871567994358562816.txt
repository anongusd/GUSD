@StaceyPlaskett And this is what a Democrat is calling an accomplishment...something to be proud.  I guess if you set the standards low enough anything can be seen as an accomplishment.

@HillaryClinton Right. They should all be doing this on their own countries not here
@HillaryClinton So if someone breaks the law (ie does something illegal) &amp; the criminal goes to jail, is it the police officer’s fault for separating the families b/c he was the one who arrested them? These families are separated b/c they are suffering the consequence of doing something illegal
@scarter24293 @GlennJacobsTN What good is federal government if states do whatever they want anyway. I’m sure the federal government has laws against sanctuary cities, yet states do it without consequences. Unenforced laws at any level might as well not exist.

@dcexaminer Honestly why bother at this point. @HillaryClinton is relatively irrelevant at this point.
@NBCNews Was it because of the question or because you wouldn’t comply when you were asked to stop?  Spoken like a trump delinquent. Noncompliance is not acceptable.
@washingtonpost So @potus calls a journalist rude and he’s the devil but threats against someone and his family is totally acceptable.  If the left did not have double standards they’d have no standards. Congress is in deep trouble.
@w_terrence Are we gonna add the word “rude” to the list of words we can’t say?
@avgamerican58 When will people understand the should be and will be consequences for noncompliance to authority.  If you disagree with the authority, there are proper channels to take action. On the spot noncompliance is not it

@HillaryClinton Agree. Also  You should have to be a US citizen to vote. Sorry if that means the left loses the popular vote.
@HillaryClinton And we’ve watched the left attack the very sanctity of the constitution

@realDonaldTrump When Franklin Roosevelt was president, the press would actually try to protect the @POTUS image. FDR had polio. The press did the opposite of exploit this. They avoided showing his disability and focused on his strengths. Imagine what that would be like.
@BobHugin @BobMenendezNJ I don't like that you don't support @POTUS who is in your party @GOP, but I do support the party and you are in it. The Constitution is in dire need of defense. Amendments are being shattered. Speech control. Guilty until proven innocent. Anti 2nd amendment laws. These are real.

@mitchellvii Can't wait.
@FoxNews @JoeBiden Sure.  When they find nothing, they can farther justify electing him.
@JackPosobiec They hit @JeffFlake and he crumbled. A coward. HIs simple response should've been "He is innocent until proven guilty." What any of us "feel" or "believe" on this case is irrelevant. The facts matter, and the facts should decide.
@BatzerJ @JeffFlake Delaying the vote is not a problem. The problem is @JeffFlake becoming a puppet for the left. His response to protestors should be Kavenaugh is innocent until proven guilty.-a basic concept of the US judicial system. Facts matter, not what people "believe" or "feel."
@JackPosobiec As long as he gets electedm the longer we wait the more foolish the Dems look.  The more they dig and find nothing conclusive, the more foolish they look. The left is good at making themselves look bad. Remember when leftist polls gave @HillaryClinton a 99% chance of winning?

@RealJamesWoods @Acosta @PressSec Few news programs report news. The news should present facts—this is what happened—and allow people to draw conclusions.

@charliekirk11 People in the military make up a very small percentage of 18 year olds in the US. Few 18 year olds are mature enough to handle the responsibility of drinking with a newly acquired drivers license. Those in the military may be but most are not.
@PressSec @Italians4Trump Yet I got a notice from PSE&amp;G that they are raising their rates. Can you explain that?
@DineshDSouza Sharia law doesn't help either.
@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump only said "based on Merit" @KeithOlbermann has taken "merit" to mean Aryan so it is Oberman, not @POTUS, who is claiming that the only way to have merit is to be white.
@Montanabeef @KathySilke @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump Yes and no one was turned away on Ellis island as they went right past that quote.—wait that’s not true. They determined if you were fit to stay. If you could contribute and/or were not bad for our country. But let’s only look at the facts we like.
@kurteichenwald The only thing I agree with is the suggestion that millennials move away
@robreiner Interesting because I’m looking right at your picture.

@WalshFreedom If they make guns illegal there should be sanctuary states where people can use illegal guns, b/c illegal means it's ok like illegal aliens.
@TulsiGabbard I'm republican but agree. If there is separation of church and state why is there a chaplain and a morning prayer at congressional meetings?
@GovHawaii So many haven't learned.Every 4 yrs millions will have a pres they didn't vote for. When will ppl realize we are 1 nation, not 2 pol parties

@Chy_369 @cher @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner Therefore the problems' value doesn't even amount to 4000 books.

@Chy_369 @cher @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner No there are no laws against.  I've stated I know it's not illegal. But because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD..

@Chy_369 @cher @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner In some ways aren't your extrapolations from the facts similar to how you felt I used the facts of my1st post to come to my conclusion?
@Chy_369 @cher @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner I cannot stand HRC...now that's an indisputable fact.
@Chy_369 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner @cher All I'm saying is this method of protesting is not illegal but I feel is disrespectful. U don't. 2 opinions--opinions are not right or wrong
@Chy_369 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner @cher If it's unconstitutional bring it to the Supreme Court. Just like they said with travel ban, oh wait bad ex. 9-0 said it was constitutional.
@nowthisnews What is the answer? Are the US constitution and US laws intended for US citizens, for all people period, or all people in our borders
@Chy_369 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner @cher Free speech doesn't mean you can say everything: yelling fire in a movie theater, slander, sexual harassment, nowadays unwanted pronouns.
@Chy_369 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNN @robreiner @cher But just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD.

@Daily_Express When did London become such a rough city? Wonder what's changed there the past few yrs to cause drastic change? Just looking for facts.
@dcexaminer More handouts? The polls are open long enough that very few people would be unable to vote, and if so that's what absentee ballots are for.
@VeteranGA @Veteran4Trump Gd news. @KellyannePolls reported that any Medicaid reform is for the future. Existing plans are grandfathered. Keep supporting @POTUS
@WashTimes The police had a right to pull it down because it didn't belong there. A dam is not a public forum. Anything placed on it can be taken down.
@WSJ It may have an app that shows you how to socialieze😏
@alyankovic Idk about that.  Not sure this is the best career move at this point in your life. People would rather listen to you than watch you play.
A tongue in cheek article, but point is people overspend on food/drink. Eg: one saves so much by making coffee instead of buying a cup a day https://t.co/6lZcyNma7G
@immigrant4trump So every politician from the 2017 election was involved in some scandal? I bet @SecretaryCarson is the only one who would come out clean,
@VeteranGA @Veteran4Trump The flaw in our system is that able people get disability for bogus ailments yet you who deserve it don't get enough
@Veteran4Trump Why would anyone work if you can get paid to not work?
@realDonaldTrump What's the difference. She just spared him from being defeated by you.

@IngrahamAngle Sounds like treason. A mutiny on the making.
@Italians4Trump @POTUS If the right were making these threats they would be called barbaric.  Leftists fight against so many double standards yet create this one
@DWStweets Their intent is to improve what people have not reduce. so you're asking them to explain why theyre doing something theyre saying they arent
@USATODAY Everyone knows a million dollars is almost laughable. Haven't you seen Austin Powers ? Lol
@ACLU A disability warrants some aid but doesn't make one above the law. Break it get arrested. Do we need to say dropping him wasn't intentional?

@JackieVhmedic @robreiner @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I have to agree he probably does enjoy it.
@JWKieres @jefftack69 @robreiner @POTUS Every president is "attacked" and I'm not saying Trump warrants none, but much of it is absurd.
@JWKieres @robreiner We're whiny ?  Who were he ones who needed therapy dogs and play-do after the election? That didn't happen l2 times Obama won
@dcexaminer A lot of variables being omitted. Another oversimplification to make a point leaving out so many facts.
VERY! And they need a sarcasm emoji.  Hard to convey that in writing as well. https://t.co/kiUAjjoBGc
@davidfrum He should've held out for four scoops.  I bet he would've gotten it.
@Purrcival @THEHermanCain I agree we don't know. This is my point. people just spew stuff as fact AND draw conclusions, when it's really all feelings.
@jefftack69 @robreiner @POTUS So you're saying in a fancy way "he started it!" LOL
@Purrcival @THEHermanCain Both statements are often made. Factually neither are conclusive. All Trump votes aren't racist, all Muslims aren't terrorists. That I know.
That was the poll I kept ignoring because they were so opposite from the #FakePolls. Not anymore.  Fool me once... @POTUS https://t.co/QspX53JlQE
@SecretarySonny @Italians4Trump How about that.  Working to earn money... So easy, a child gets it.
@THEHermanCain Most racists voted for Trump, so all Trump voters racist? Most terrorist r Muslim, so all Muslims r terrorist? Which way does logic work?
@robreiner Maybe if @POTUS didn't have to spend so much time warding off attacks from his own country he could focus on doing his job #ThatsMyPresident
#ThatsMyPresident https://t.co/6WBmMUjr7F
@tedcruz The leftist concept of freedom of speech is, "you're allowed to say what you want as long as you agree with me."
@WashTimes @HUDgov @SecretaryCarson Getting a job as a pathway out of poverty? Not simple handouts?  What a concept.  #ThatsMyPresident @POTUS @POTUS44
@latimes War on Drugs is like War on Terror. Such a vague fluid enemy. Both have killed so many. So sad and yet the culprits just don't care. 😢☹️💔
@WashTimes It's amazing how there is all this "evidence" but no one is allowed to say what this evidence is.  How convenient.

@USATODAY Aside from the immorality of treating employees this way, how about the fact of how unsafe this is very everyone on the road?
@TIME Can anyone really say what he's under investigation for? They keep poking hoping to find something wrong, yet they keep coming up empty.

@washingtonpost Trumps presidency has been in jeopardy since day 1. So many out to get him. Surviving 4-8 years of this will only strengthen his legacy
@washingtonpost Yeah there's no collision or conspiracy against him. No one is looking for anything they can to get rid of him. But that's all his fault.
@VP @POTUS I'll be in Central America this summer. Would love to know my @vp is there with me #thatsmypresident #thatsmyvp
@SenJeffMerkley What is it that politicians fear about taxing the wealthy? So they receive endorsements? So the money should go just to them &amp; not the govt?
@Newsweek The Dems nor the Reps. are responsible for demonizing the media. The media is responsible for demonizing itself. Even this is #FakeNews
@dcexaminer Why do we have such a hard time separating  anti-Muslim extremist behavior with anti-Muslim... unless you want to look at partial fact.
@washingtonpost Spanish train stations are filled with entertaining signs.  Might as well add this one.
@RealRonHoward The problem is people feel we should do different things. Very few look at the facts. They respond with name calling, chants, or protests.
@luisfortuno51 Esta conversación ha ocurrido tantas veces en la historia. ¿Hay algo diferente esta vez que nos dice que los resultados serán diferentes?
@WSJ Of course quality of college education is declining. Instead of teaching you to answer a question with facts they teach you to chant over it

@starledger I live in NJ and welcome him, and I'm sure our governor and several reps do as well  Speak for yourself
@Italians4Trump Why are people trying to derail things that have been voted in. In the past two years the world has becoming like a tantrum prone child
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Paitients can only abuse eat Drs prescribe unless they're getting it illegally which regulating won't help.
An interesting statistic if it were true, but how were these numbers calculated? How was this determined. Anyone can spew out numbers.
@GregAbbott_TX I'm pro #travelban but that would imply that everyone from the listed countries who can't be vetted are criminals. That's just not true.
@RepDonBeyer @davidcicilline It's pretty easy to register in vote. What needs work is the security of voting, like verifying identity.
@Cernovich Why would you want to knock out the leader of your nation? No matter who's @POTUS I always want them to succeed. It's still my country #USA
@Scientiaetjus @MSNBC @pouts I'm saying it's either factually allowed or not. I'm looking for facts not feelings. Not all amoral acts are illegal &amp; yes that's a problem.
Elizabeth P. Foley on @MSNBC w/Alex Witt says @POUTS did nothing unconstitutional with #Comey. Thinking one shouldn't doesn't mean one can't
@TIME These ploys to remove @POTUS are so desperate.They're one step above throwing coins into a fountain and wishing it so. Pathetic.

@12News Wrong as it was, maybe if she's not well enough to not fall for that she shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car.
@TheEconomist Are other countries like this?  If so I think the big question is, why is the world so divided?
@DonaldJTrumpJr The only sad thing about this is that you had to add the parenthetical about supervision because you knew you'd be attacked if you didn't.
@NBCNewYork Hope they're this loyal to each other the rest of their lives.

@FoxNews @toddstarnes Being religious doesn't make you unfit for politics. As long as you don't quote scripture as your reasoning for your actions.
@FoxNews @ffweekend @LawrenceBJones3 @POTUS What kind of a terrible band would do this 😋
@RepJayapal So which ban is it that says strictly Muslims can't come here?  I can name 180 countries from which Muslims and all others are welcome. Fact
@KimGuadagnoNJ I love the thought but property tax pays for a lot. How will you compensate for that loss of revenue or what will you cut? #NJ
@Newsweek Isn't science believer an oxymoron? Either there are scientific facts or there aren't. You can't believe or disbelieve facts. They just are.
@nowthisnews Trump's campaign was run by Russia?  How can you take his point seriously with a comment like that. Not influenced. RUN by Russia. Come on!😂
@KimGuadagnoNJ As much as I want the taxes to go down, they are used to pay for something. How will that loss be replaced? Something has to be cut. What?

@washingtonpost I'm not understanding. If @POTUS blocks you, you can still post on Twitter. You can still say what you want.
@CNN 1st amendment gives the right to say what you want. It doesn't say anyone has to listen. #CNN the #1 Spin Doctor
@TuckerCarlson had #LisaDurden. The WORST advocate for #BlackLivesMatter. If that movement wants to go anywhere they need to get rid of her.
@FoxNews It doesn't take a college education to see that while we are not perfect, this is truly a great country!
@NBCNews It's gonna be hard to make the world a better place behind bars. Was it worth it?
@TheEconomist @POTUS pulled out of #ParisAgreement but we don't know what regs will be imposed or removed. Let's get the facts b4 we express our feelings
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @seanhannity College campus = Freedom of speech as long as you agree with me, + if your facts refute my argument those facts are racist.
@12News @RepOHalleran @dougducey @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake No one should have immunity to acts like this. This is where we need regulations.
@AP If you're dumb enough to take meds purchased on the street, maybe that's #Darwinism at play.
@washingtonpost Islam can stay, but Ayaan Hirsi writes, Islam needs a reformation. Islamic terrorist are told not to question what the relgious texts say.
@NRDC What's the exact effects of the actions of the #ParisAgreement.  Some studies show its negligible. Is it worth the effect on our economy?
@pjabbott @GovInslee @POTUS Don't see where in that quote it says you can't have a travel ban against certain countries.  Certain religions perhaps, but not countries
