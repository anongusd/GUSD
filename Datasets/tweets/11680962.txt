In Bernie Sanders return to the borough where he was born and raised, he drew sharp contrasts between himself and the New Yorker in the White House. My dispatch from Brooklyn. https://t.co/HrOhkKZCqy
@titonka I thought I walked past you earlier!
"I did not come from a family of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers: “You’re fired.” I came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers."
Sanders is contrasting his upbringing in Brooklyn with another New Yorker, Donald Trump. "My experience as a kid, living in a family that struggled economically, powerfully influenced my life and my values. I know where I came from, and that is something that I will never forget"
After a familiar riff on his policies, @BernieSanders is now going personal, as we previewed: "As we launch this campaign for president, you deserve to know where I come from – because family history heavily influences the values that we adopt as adults."
Bernie Sanders takes the stage to “Brooklyn Go Hard.”

“Bernie has been giving the man hell since the day he was born,” @shaunking says in Brooklyn. https://t.co/kDDcYAVlrY
King is now discussing Sanders’ reticence to discuss some aspects of his life, particularly civil rights activism. He says that Sanders “hates telling these stories  and he’s resisted using them for political capital...it’s because he does what he does because he cares.”
King: We must reject this idea that who Bernie was in the 1960s is irrelevant. Because who you are...and who you fight for, and who you fight against— it’s always relevant.
@Jeremy_Danner @VisitKC This makes me so homesick.
The speakers ahead of @BernieSanders here in Brooklyn, including @ninaturner and @shaunking, are framing his origin story and connecting the dots between Sanders’ personal story and the ideas and policies he champions.

Harris notes support for Green New Deal. She says she supports the resolution, and that "we have to figure out how to get there." She adds: "I care about the environment,not because I have any particular desire to hug a tree, but I have a strong desire to hug a healthy baby."
"I believe this is a moment in time that we need fighters on the stage who know how to fight - I do," Harris says, "and who have a proven desire to lead."

Sen. Kamala Harris, standing outside of Oakland’s city hall, formally kicked off her campaign for the White House on Sunday, presenting herself as the leader who can best unite an America that is at an “inflection point” and facing a key question. https://t.co/oyQPSFKfoo
@NickRiccardi You're giving the people the information they want now.
@NickRiccardi What kind of IPA though? Need more details.
RT @melmason: "Let's do this!" @KamalaHarris says as she closes her kick-off speech. Walk off music is "My Shot" from Hamilton
"As we embark on this campaign I will tell you this: I am not perfect," Harris says "Lord knows I am not perfect but I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect."
"With faith in God, with fidelity to country, and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States," @KamalaHarris, a daughter of Oakland, tells the crowd.
When we have true unity no one will be subjugated for others. It's about fighting for a country with equal treatment, collective purpose and freedom for all," she adds.
Harris's early campaign has focused on unity, but she notes today that she isn't talking about unity "for the sake of unity" and that "the word unity has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo."
.@KamalaHarris is now discussing the need to narrow the gender pay gap. "here's the thing: When we lift up the women of our country we lift up the children of our country, we lift up the families of our country and the whole of society benefits," she says.
As expected, @KamalaHarris is speaking at length about her career as a prosecutor, which has informed her vision for America and rationale for running for president. https://t.co/oyQPSFKfoo
“Let me tell you, I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland,” @KamalaHarris says as she speaks to a swelling crowd in Oakland. https://t.co/E6a6DZKQph
Bit of a theme with the pre-speech music going on in Oakland. Previously playing: "Girl on Fire" by Alicia Keys. Next up: Beyonce's “Run the World (Girls)”
"I am so proud to endorse Kamala Harris as the next president of our United States of America," Schaaf says. "OK Oakland, Kamala has been fighting for us her whole life. Now it is time that we fight for her."
Oakland Mayor @LibbySchaaf: "Oakland, are we proud that we are Kamala Harris's hometown? Are we proud that this is where she launched her career as a fighter for justice?....I know that Oakland is proud that she is our kind of leader."
The Oakland-based group @SambaFunky is now performing a rendition of Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On."
Harris herself has drawn inspiration from Chisholm's bid.
Ahead of Harris's speech, a local pastor is offering a blessing, with a throwback to Shirley Chisholm's history-making presidential bid 47 years ago. Of Harris, he says: "Let her be unbought, unbossed and unbiased."
A number of @KamalaHarris's @akasorority1908 sorors are in the crowd here in Oakland, many wearing their signature pink and green.

Gillibrand points out that there are now two women representing Iowa in Congress. "That is what changing the face of leadership looks like," she said.
Gillibrand calls the women's march "the largest global protest in the history of the world," and says that "electing President Trump called for nothing less."
RT @GideonResnick: Sanders will be in South Carolina Monday and Tuesday with a pretty packed schedule per release https://t.co/0gxmBby7Jb
We’re back in Des Moines, where @SenGillibrand will soon speak to the @womensmarchia which is gathered at the Capitol.
Anyone under employed or unemployed should have whatever job training it takes to get that job, Gillibrand says.
“I don’t think we need degrees that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars...We have to make access to college, access to higher education something that’s a real right,” Gillibrand says in response to a q from a HS teacher.
The next president must reclaim that mantle and be a leader on the world stage, Gillibrand says.
Gillibrand says that the country has “stepped away from the mantle of leadership,” under the Trump administration. This comes in response to a woman who said she fears the country is headed toward World War 3.
Gillibrand says that Trump “does not speak truth,” and that “he lies to us every day.” Notes that Trump has created fear in many Americans, and that it needs to be addressed.
RT @GingerGibson: Gillibrand gets a little choked up talking about children who died in Superstorm Sandy flooding. Yesterday got choked up…
“If we don’t address global climate change we are creating a horror for this country and the world that we’re leaving to our kids and our grandkids,” Gillibrand says, noting that it has to be a moral issue.
Gillibrand is now taking questions from people gathered here. The first was on guns, the second on climate change.
“I am a mom with young kids,” Gillibrand says today. “It’s how I see the world.”
@GingerGibson Hi Ginger 👋🏾👋🏾
Here’s my story from earlier this week on Gillibrand’s focus on gender in the early days of her campaign. https://t.co/YPqNbYYObA
Gillibrand is speaking to patrons now, launching into a speech. As she has said, and did when she launched her campaign, she says she’s running for President because she will fight for others’ children with the same tenacity that she does her own.
.@SenGillibrand just arrived in Ames and is greeting patrons at Stomping Grounds Cafe https://t.co/iiFtSWxju5
@redsteeze Feel free to take a look at any of the stories I wrote this week, too.
@redsteeze To suggest that I merely tweet photos of shirts from event is frankly, inaccurate. Like many other reporters who cover campaigns, I also take photos of interesting color from the road and I think how campaigns message on the ground is interesting.
The shirts are being handed out here as a play for support in a college town. We’re told that the campaign also has them in colors for the other local schools. Some people here are already wearing them.
Hey @IowaStateU , @SenGillibrand’s campaign has got you covered in the shirt department https://t.co/n5qSjhHEJa

Asked if she has a timetable for deciding on a presidential bid, @KamalaHarris says (as she has been recently) "soon." And quickly asks, "can we talk about the children's book?"
@KamalaHarris "What was that supposed to be about? Tell me that, if not about inserting race in a way that was intended to create fear and division. That's not what a leader does. And that's certainly not what the leader of the United States is supposed to do." (2/2)

What would @KamalaHarris have said were she in today's SitRoom meeting? "First of all, let's be clear. You cannot hold the American people hostage over your vanity project."
Harris adds, "There is a thing about leadership...you have to have the courage to do things that are in the best interest of the people you leave, even if it's not in your personal best interest."
Capehart asks Harris the difference between her gut and Trump's. She observes: "That assumes he has a gut."

I interviewed @TomSteyer ahead of his town hall here in Charleston. When I asked him about his 2020 plans he said he's still deciding whether to run, and quipped that “I assume there are going to be more Democrats running than there are going to be voters.”
While traveling in South Carolina, Steyer says that he went to the city's "Mother Emanuel" church and met with the people behind Charleston's planned International African American Museum.
@TomSteyer We can recognize that we have the most corrupt president in American history who is a basic threat to our system and our safety and to the constitution itself and understand we have to act. (2/2)

.@clairecmc: "Here's the deal: We need balance. We need to turn the temperature down." Someone in the crowd responds, "Yes, Amen."
.@clairecmc: "I am working for every single vote in every corner of this state, and there is a lot of votes in Kansas City. And we know that we can touch a lot of people in two days if we want to."
.@clairecmc jokes about Trump: “He’s been here so often that he must be building a golf course!” https://t.co/2WTyZZq0Uz
.@clairemc takes the stage to chants of "Claire" as the Beyonce song "Run the World (Girls)" plays in the background.
Rep. Cleaver makes the point that it's a mistake to underestimate McCaskill with a nod to the 2012  #MOSen race. "Todd Akin was already picking out the furniture for his office, and he does now have a very nice office -- at his house in St. Louis," he says.
.@repcleaver: I don't think it is an overstatement at all. Ladies and gentelmen, we absolutely must for the sake of our nation and our unborn progeny elect Claire McCaskill back to the US Senate.
.@KikiCurls takes the stage in Kansas City: "We can't let them win because we stayed home. Claire needs our help. Cleaver needs our help and so does the entire Democratic ticket. "

The Senate just voted to confirm Robert Wilkie to be the next VA Secretary, 86-9. He's also the first VA nominee to receive votes in opposition of his nomination.
Update: There are now eight Senators voting no.	--Gillibrand	--Harris	--Wyden	--Feinstein	--Booker	--Sanders	--Merkley	--Warren
Those lawmakers are: Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York Kamala Harris of California and Ron Wyden of Oregon.
The vote is still ongoing, but so far three senators have voted against Robert Wilkie's nomination to lead VA.
The Senate is now voting on the nomination of Robert Wilkie to serve as the next secretary of Veterans Affairs. I'll have more soon on @CNNPolitics

Sen. Sherrod Brown references the WashPost piece on Wilkie’s work for racially divisive members of Congress, notes that Wilkie was nominated to his job “by a very racially divisive President.” Brown asks Wilkie if he can commit to serving all veterans. Wilkie says he will.
Wilkie addresses WaPo story regarding his career/views: "I welcome the scrutiny of my entire record....If I had been what the Washington Post implied, I don’t think I would have been able to work for Condoleezza Rice or Bob Gates or Jim Mattis.”
Nearly an hour into Robert Wilkie's confirmation hearing. Washington Sen. @PattyMurray just referenced the Washington Post report re: Wilkie/Sons of Confederate Veterans, other policy positions. However, she declined to question him, saying she'll submit those Qs for record.

Robert Wilkie tells Sen. Bernie Sanders that he does not believe in the privatization of the VA, and says he will “oppose efforts to privatize VA.”
Interesting:   Questioned by Sen. Tester, Robert Wilkie says the inspector general "is not subordinate to the secretary." “I believe the IG works with me,” Wilike said.		That seems to contradict the letter from acting VA Secretary Peter O'Rourke last week.
Ranking Member Tester asks Robert Wilkie, the VA nominee, if there were any conditions attached to him taking the job. He says there were no conditions. He also says he’ll have autonomy to appoint his own staff.
-- Improve the culture -- offer world class customer service	-- Improve access to care through implementation of the MISSION Act and transformative IT modernization	--Reduce the backlog of claims/ payments	--Business transformation including reform of human resource systems
Robert Wilkie, VA nominee, is speaking now. His priorities:
Tillis says that perhaps, Wilkie's greatest qualification is his “lifelong experience as an Army brat, and the personal experience as the son of a gravely wounded soldier, and a service member himself. 		He has literally lived the experience, Tillis said.
Tillis says Wilkie has been held in high regard in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill, and that he’s “universally recognized as a team player and a mentor.”
North Carolina GOP Sen. Tillis is introducing Robert Wilkie at today's VA confirmation hearing. Wilkie previously worked for Tillis.

The federal commission on school safety is holding its first public forum today, seeking feedback on solutions to improve safety in the nation's schools. 		https://t.co/eUm308NcWO
After Former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny indicated that he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right for further questioning, Moran acknowledged that + Penny was excused from the hearing. 		A woman seated behind Penny yelled out "Shame" as he exited the hearing room.
"I would like to answer your question however I have been instructed by the committee to assert my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the constitution..."
Former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny, who resigned last year, invoked his Fifth Amendment right and is continuing to do so when asked when he first learned of Larry Nassar's abuse and his subsequent actions.
Faehn said she "immediately" reported concerns to Former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny who assured her that concerns were being addressed with proper law enforcement authorities and to parents.
Rhonda Faehn, who was the women's program director of USA Gymnastics, is giving her opening statement at the Senate hearing now. 		Her written statement: https://t.co/lEPUTQfVW3
“The actions of [Nassar] and the individuals and institutions that facilitated and protected his behavior are reprehensible,” said @SenJoniErnst “It was a failure at all levels and symptomatic of broader problems facing our society on sexual assault, rape, harassment and assault”
CT Sen Blumenthal: “It’s more than just one person, it’s more than just one governing body, it’s a set of institutions … of the USOC, USAG, and MSU that enabled Larry Nassar and those other monsters out there still who are continuing to violate fundamental rights.”
At hearing, KS Sen Jerry Moran points out that the committee issued subpoenas to compel Former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny and former MSU President Lou Anna Simon to appear today.

Trump in Ohio speech on the future of VA: “We made changes because we want them taken care of, we want them to have choice so that they can run to a private doctor. And take care of it. And it’s going to get done." @CNN
Re-upping this one from earlier in the year, regarding the President's comments on community colleges vs vocational/technical schools: https://t.co/62EBEd96JD https://t.co/FXic8h6w5K
These groups have also worried that the President would install someone at VA who would privatize veterans' healthcare, and many argue unfettered choice is unsustainable.
The biggest thing I'm hearing from veterans groups is that  while Jackson's medical credentials and service to his country is not in question -- the VA is the government's second-largest bureaucracy and serves so many functions, and Jackson lacks management experience
Trump says he "wasn't happy" with the speed at which veterans were taken care of just now, the day after he fired David Shulkin at the head of VA and announced he would replace him with WH physician Ronny Jackson.

ICYMI, DeVos took an unusual step yesterday and took to Twitter to defend herself amid criticism of that 60 Minutes interview. The tweets highlight things DeVos says 60 mins didn't include. Good bground here - https://t.co/iYIm5nUwKx
Ed Sec DeVos isn't addressing the 60 minutes flap extensively in this speech, but does say that "now that I have the opportunity to speak unedited, I'm not afraid to call out folks who defend stagnation for what it really is: failure." #PTALegCon
In remarks at #PTALegCon, DeVos says people should send ideas about stopping gun violence in schools to safety@ed.gov.
