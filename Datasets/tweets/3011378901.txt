@andersoncooper Anderson I truly like you and enjoy watching when your anchoring. Forget about politics and as you know, we should ALWAYS verify sources. Otherwise, we loose trust....
@CNN CNN you and your staff should be embarrassed stating that you are in the journalism industry. Journalism 101, verify your sources. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME..
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, once again the effort to get you out of office has FAILED! Our US media is a corrupt as your former attorney. SHAME CNN, SHAME!!!
@realDonaldTrump it's extremely interesting Mr. President that Congress has enough money to conduct many investigations to remove you from office, but can't find the dollar's to protect American citizens from illegal individuals. Where are their priorities?

@realDonaldTrump Your right Mr. President! If politicians worried more about helping the forgotten middle class then their political careers, our country would not have fallen in disarray over the past 3 decades. Please continue to stay focused for us ...
@realDonaldTrump Me President, you are absolutely correct. If you get the $5B, it looks bad for certain individuals . However, they know we need to do something about the border, but they don't want to appear weak. Some how you need to come up with a plan so it's a win win situation.

@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, when you became our President, you made promises. One being, it will no longer be uncomfortable to say Merry Christmas. During the past two weeks, I have had many people wish me a Merry Christmas. Thank you &amp; Merry Christmas to you and your family!

@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, for decades politicians have acted upon their interest and not the average US citizen. THANK YOU for standing firm and not bending with the political winds. Please keep fighting for the average Joe. Merry Christmas and have a fantastic 2019...
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you have done everything in your power to assist our country. No matter what happens in the next few hours, we the people, THANK YOU!
Mr Lemon please keep in mind, there occasions when people have FUN! SOMETIMES, we might even want a beverage with alcohol, such as a beer. I think you might agree..  Please take a look at your CNN vids on New Year's Eve..
@annfree1 @realDonaldTrump This is 2018 and I was not around in 1950. Every day since the birth of this country, bad things have happened to all kinds of people. But we learn and move on.

It's amazing how things have changed in the USA. In years past, sharing of feelings and beliefs were requested. If you now share your position, a person is criticized, shunned and crucified. If the US is a melting pot of people &amp; beliefs, why do we try to destroy fellow citizens.

@JustinVic @GreggJarrett Hi Justin, none of us know the future, but we all can see the realistic economic upswing which is benefiting the entire U.S. It has been decades since a President has been able to accomplish so much in such a short period of time, even with so much resistance.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you are positioning the U.S. as the economic leader of the world! Some might not like how it's being done. However, you're accomplishing this success like NEVER before. The attached picture says it all... USA, USA USA!!! https://t.co/eTiDzvniVl

@realDonaldTrump Mr President, I am a positive and forgiving individual. However, Jeff Sessions MUST be released! There is to much turmoil within the Justice Dept. I know he assisted you during the campaign and you're a loyal person. But the AG is impotent and not doing his job.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President for deporting Nazi Jakiw Palij. This evil man who assisted to destroy many life's and families. TALK IS CHEAP! Over the years many individuals and Presidents did nothing. Please continue to focus on the USA and forget the noise...

You thought about all aspects &amp; said, hum maybe we should postpone. Your not afraid to change your mind when you know things need more insight.
@GreggJarrett It was just announced by CNN that John Brennan won the 2016 award for assisting in the most treasonous initiative in the history of the USA... Congratulations John!

@melanieann21353 @KingKhalifa90 @realDonaldTrump You're correct Melanie, most Military families fall below the poverty level. This IS terrible.... But at least there is a focus on improving the situation. It will take time, but we have to believe. Our military is counting on us!
@BayBeeDoc @realDonaldTrump Hi Brian, thank you for your service. My family has also fought in many wars. One thing I have learned traveling around the world, many folks don't like our government. However if it doesn't survive, we don't survive! Most Military families love our country
@KingKhalifa90 @realDonaldTrump King, I feel I have answered your question. However I understand that you don't agree. BUT that's okay.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Mr. President, they are not reporting news, it's gossip! During the past couple of years, CNN has turned it self into a talk / opinion show.

@mrzeus7 @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @MichaelRCaputo My concern is that many of our once traditional news outlets are now talk shows with opinions and speculation. Yes President Trumps comments are intriguing, but I'm sure there are plenty of issues / happenings in the world which are also extremely important. Just an observation!
@mrzeus7 @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @MichaelRCaputo As I conveyed, no issues with occasionally discussing politics and criticizing politicians, but 24 -7? What happened to journalist being out in the field bringing the world to us?  I hope one day CNN will revert back to important news reporting versus a tabloid opinion network...

@MrsTLBerger @realDonaldTrump Hi Terry,it's my opinion the reason why our southern border versus the northern, is due to the volume of people entering the country from Central America. I have friends in many central America countries and it's horrible there. No hope, that's why they are escaping
@realDonaldTrump Mr President my relatives came from somewhere else. Back in the day, you had to be sponsored and have steady employment within X amount of time or you went back home. Its important for ALL of us to realize immigration is fantastic, but needs to be legal and we must have a process
@realDonaldTrump Mr President I own a Safari company in Kenya and have traveled to 53 countries. When you visit other countries, their boarders are policed and strict. Many citizens have not visited other lands and don't understand the restrictions. We must have borders or we don't have a country

@viewsofonewoman @realDonaldTrump We are not at war with Russia, how can he be a traitor. Words have definitions and should not be used inappropriately.
@nicolai_axelsen @realDonaldTrump If an individual pays who makes $1M  pays 10% = $100m. Someone who makes $20m pays 5% = $1m. Why should the individual who makes $20m pay 1/2 and only $1m. Especially, if they are receiving all of the services. This logic does not make sense.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I was thinking about you today. I'm not sure why you wanted to become President. There are so many individuals that just want to ensure you are not successful. Even though these folks are probably very intelligent, it doesn't reflect their position

@realDonaldTrump That's because true friends don't try to rip off other friends. They have been caught and you are holding them accountable. It's normal, a defensive stand. He'll come around!
@realDonaldTrump @g7 Maybe he should have listened to our former Presidents advice. For decades,  the USA has been walking with a weak stick. Please keep the faith Mr. President and don't blink!
@realDonaldTrump All of this would have been covered up if someone else became president. Please continue to stay the course Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump He just blinked Mr. President. Hold the line!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, hold the line. The first one who blink's, looses....
@realDonaldTrump We all can't forget Mr. President, it was / is not just the Dems who wanted you to fail, it's also the GOP! They're not going to give up...
@realDonaldTrump This crap goes higher than we all know. Omg, what sa boomerang... They never thought you would win Mr. President and all of this would have been covered up!
@realDonaldTrump What a boomerang Mr. Present. It's all coming out now, they're scared...
@andersoncooper Hi Anderson, I fully understand when people have said something that huts someone, we should apologize. Have you apologized to your friend Kathy Griffith?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I'll take her crumbs...  Lol
@realDonaldTrump Awesome! Please remember President Regan's quote, "Trust but Verify". As we all know, they are tricksters...
@realDonaldTrump As it has been said, if she's not the right fit, who would be! Btw, in 2001 &amp; 2002 members of both parties of Congress stated waterboarding is not torture and was supportive of the practice. Boyyyy, how soon we forget and start pointing fingers. SHAME!
@realDonaldTrump Yhea know what Me. President, everything you are doing is for the good of the forgotten. You'll never win with those Bozos. You're doing an awesome job and the forgotten appreciate everything you are doing. Forget the fake tabloid news!
@realDonaldTrump Whaaaaa Hoooooo! Whaaaa Hoooooo! You are making it happen Mr. President... Three Americans released from N. Korea. Whaaaaa Hoooooo, thank you
@realDonaldTrump Whaaaaa Hoooooo, Whaaaaa Hoooooo... Thank you for everything you are doing! USA #1
@realDonaldTrump All I can say is, Whaaaa Hoooooo! Thank you Mr President for all of your hard work in obtaining the release of the 3 Americans from North Korea. GREAT JOB
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, your friend is doing an AWESOME job on Shawn Hannity's show. You finally have someone conveying the truth versus FAKE news.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, I worked in for a large US Bank heading up a Small Business lending departmen and also sat on a SBA CDC board during our previous administration. All I can say about that timeframe is "LAYOFFS". Please keep up the great work!
@realDonaldTrump Always remember Mr. President, FAKE news sells. And they definitely want to increase their revenue. They all should be paying you residuals....
@realDonaldTrump Yes... If you think about about all of the US service men who died for Democracy and peace in Korea, it would definitely be appropriate to hold the peace talks within the zone. Mr. President, it would be a tribute to them!
@realDonaldTrump So now we really have an individual who potentially has averted a nuclear disaster. Since Nobel Peace prizes are given to people who have done absolutely nothing, then this is definitely a reason for our President to win one.
@realDonaldTrump The Correspondence Diner comedian just embarrassed the United States. Her so called jokes were crude and not funny. Making fun of one's self is healthy, but gutter talk was disgraceful. Just my opinion...
@MELANIATRUMP You made me so proud tonight. I'm sure what we saw on TV was nothing compared to seeing everything you put together for the Macrons. Thank you for all you do and please don't let the critic's make you feel bad... Wonderful!
@viewsofonewoman @realDonaldTrump Life is to short to be upset, we all need to work together even if we disagree. More good will come out of it versus being angry and mad at each other.
@viewsofonewoman @realDonaldTrump As far as I understand, a traitor is an individual who is not trying to make a country successful, but destroy it. Creating jobs, bringing peace, helping the environment, ect. Again, President Trump's is not perfect in any means, but he  is definitely focused.
@realDonaldTrump In today's world, it is hard to be perfect. If we focus on bettering our family and society, its a step in the right direction. President Trump is truly trying to focus on improving life for everyone in the US. Let's come together as one and make America AWESOME!
@cardhodess Watch it in Demand and let me know if it was not personal. I understand politics, BUT when you start getting in marriages that is totally off point and should be out of bounce. Just my opinion...
@KellyannePolls Kellyanne, I know you and your family are stable professionals. However I appologize on behalf of proud United States citizens. It is unbelievable that this morning, you and your family was	personally attacked by CNN and Dana. This was totally rude and low. Sorry!
@DanaBashCNN How disgraceful for you to personally attack Kellyanne Conway's family! How low will the tabloid media and staff will go to get rid of a sitting President of the United States? Shame on you Dana. ..
RT @billmclaughlin0: @realDonaldTrump They are criticizing you for defending yourself, however can you just imagine if they were the ones b…
Omg, Kellyanne Conway's family was personally disgraced by Dana on CNN. What's next for this tabloid television show? Unbelievable!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Hahaha, soooooo true!! LMAO
@StephenMilIer Absolutely! For the good of our country, this political witch hunt must end. As my dad always said, you fight fire with fire!
@realDonaldTrump They are criticizing you for defending yourself, however can you just imagine if they were the ones being constantly being personally attacked. I can see if they don't agree with your decisions, but they are just trying to pull you down. And without cause...
@realDonaldTrump And rising! They can't deal with it...
@realDonaldTrump Whaaaaa Hoooooo Mr. President! They hit you, you hit them 100 times harder. .. Corruption is really deep!
@tas0727 Awesome pic
@realDonaldTrump Yes...  Not only were you a GREAT candidate, you're becoming one of our BEST President's!
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo Absolutely.. Sooner or later the house of cards start to crumble and all of the corruption comes to the service. It is my humble opinion that we haven't seen anything yet!
@realDonaldTrump Yes Mr. President, it would be awesome if everyone worked together as a team! One team, one dream...
@NCGigiH @TheMarkPantano I'm glad to hear these visitors to the United States are finally following our country's law...
@TheMarkPantano I'm glad to hear these visitors to the United States are finally following our country's law...
These kids understand what it means to be proud of America. Some members of Congress should take a listen and learn how to be part of a team to " Make America Great Again".  https://t.co/vZIizZABqe
@OfficeOfMike Whaaaaaa Hooooo
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, this horrible politacal corruption has been occurring for decades. The issue, "It's a click"! I scratch your back, you scratch mine. As I have stated in the past, VOTES = POWER = MONEY. Please stay focused so this terrible and Hippocratical behavior is exposed.
@bbusa617 @Englishsaviour This type of corruption is totally unacceptable and disgraceful for the US, but also for all countries... It's dangerous for the stability of the world!
@TheMarkPantano @Happybyrdie It's not only SICK, but crazy!
@OwenBenjamin @GregL27 @realDonaldTrump @Colts Soooo true!
@tas0727 So true! Votes = power = MONEY...
It's funny that for a week or so, text messages can't be located. Then when the fake  media has to report on the story, all of a sudden the 50,000 text messages show up. Poor Samsung@realDonaldTrump

@chris_squires19 @Happybyrdie @Comey Awesome point...
Mr President, thank you for all of your hard work conveying to the world that  America is bsck. However, watch your back, the RATS are scrambling in Washington and are trying to destroy you. Keep up the awesome work@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Working in the Banking industry for over 30 years, I can see every day that the economy is recovering. The is wonderful for "ALL" Americans... America FIRST!!
@realDonaldTrump Schumer is setting himself and his colleagues up for another embarrassing moment... Let's all work together to make America GREAT again!
@realDonaldTrump What a ________ show... Trump Tower was BUGGED! It is vital the Inspector General shares everything with American citizens. We can't allow top officials at our highest legal organization's try to undermine the outcome of elections! Fake news media do your job...

@realDonaldTrump Hold the course, don't give in....
@realDonaldTrump AMEN...  Hold the line!
Youre doing it@realDonaldTrump
What you said is correct about certain country's. You were not talking about individuals, but the country.  I own a safari company in Kenya and have traveled throughout the world. Your words are the truth. Stop sugar coating it news Network s@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Mr President, due to your below comments, please push back on FISA.  We need to monitor terrorist, put we need to protect the American people from government hacks. Please do not let them renew FISA unless there are safeguards to protect innocent citizens like you. Thank you
@realDonaldTrump @ICEgov That was a wonderful statement... I'm confident the men and women of iCE,  HSI and ERO appreciate the kind words. I'm sure past administrations have neglected to say "Thank  You"!
@realDonaldTrump So the talking heads on CNN stated a President needs to have experience. Then way was the USA in such a horrible state after the decades of pure politicians. I rather have a President who understands the people's needs versus an experienced politician.

@realDonaldTrump It's horrible when a close friend trys to destroy your family....  Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump Whaaaaa Hoooooo! Watch my 401k account go through the roof....
@realDonaldTrump Go, go, go Mr. President... FINALLY, we have a leader who cares about the common folks and not the leaders of countries who don't care and HATE the USA! Whaaaaa Hoooooo
@realDonaldTrump Happy 2018 to you and your family!!!
@realDonaldTrump Already starting to see the results...  Whaaaa Hoooooo!!!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends As you know the saying, "if you can't beat your competitor with truth and facts, then destroy them with falsehoods".
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for everything you did and attempted to do in 2017.... As they say, you've only just begun. Merry Christmas and I wish you and your family a fantastic 2018!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, don't worry about those butt heads... Your doing what you said, keeping your promises. First time an elected individual has done so! Whaaaaa Hoooooo. Merry Christmas
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr President! It's been in the works for 30 years and you made it HAPPEN... Whaaaa Hoooooo

@realDonaldTrump Whaaaaa Hoooooo!!!  On course...
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely ...
@realDonaldTrump This is wonderful news and will assist the great people of Utah! Whaaaaa Hoooooo
@realDonaldTrump President Trump's, for the past 1 1/2 decades this country has been going down the tubes. Since you have been in office,cwe have slowly come out of the hole... Please don't stop, we are behind you and will support you. Please don't give up!
@realDonaldTrump Obstructionist! On both sides of the aisle... For the past 16 year's, we have had individuals in power who have played politics and not put actions to their words. No one wants to look bad, so these same individuals will put barriers at every opportunity.
@realDonaldTrump Yes.. Does it suprise you??? Politicians are not held to the same standards as the rest of us! How can someone go from having nothing to a multi millionaire? What have politicians ever produce to receive that much money?
@realDonaldTrump Enough is enough... Message to USA News agencies, STOP! You are hurting our country. Enough of the fake the News ABC / Brian Ross. Support our President and stop trying to destroy him!!!!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Brian Ross and ABC News BAD! Fake News.... Shame on you!  Please try to support our United States President, not destroy him..
@realDonaldTrump Yhea know, the crazy thing about the verdict is he wasn't even found guilty of at least involuntary manslaughter. If California didn't have safe city policy's, Kate would be alive and her family would not be dealing with the murder of this wonderful person.
Just saw the Fox chain migration stats, BAD news
@realDonaldTrump Whaaaa hooooo! Up, up and away....
@realDonaldTrump At least they condemned. There might be things happening behind the scene they are not telling you. Patients is a virtue, you are doing everything you can without blowing them into kingdom come. If something more drastic has to occur, you know you did everything that you could
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for not giving up, the USA really needs the tax cuts. Our economy is starting to hum and it will go through the roof once the business and personal tax cuts go into effect. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump Some organizations and individuals should throw stones, especially when they live in glass houses! Over the past 2 1/2 years, many have thrown stones. They should be looking at themselves in the mirror... Please keep focused, we're counting on you
@realDonaldTrump I agree... There just trying to save face after so many years / decades of failure!
@realDonaldTrump It is horrible that any USA citizen disrespects our National pride. But especially when they are collecting millions of dollars for playing a game.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, it's a waste of time and energy. Those tabloid organizations will not change tge
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I agree. Over the past 25 years, I have traveled to 47 countries. The most heard information regarding the USA comes from CNN. If you listen to the network from over-sea's, you're incompetent and destroying our country. It's a shame that they don't hear you are fixing the issues.
@realDonaldTrump Go Donald, GO.... WHAAAA HOOOOO! Don't let them get you down. You gave up an unbelievable life to help us... I just want to say, THANK YOU!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump There are people in this world that are just ungrateful, I would move on and don't let it bother you... It really doesn't matter!
@realDonaldTrump You don't need the that a boy, you know what you did and at the end of the day that's all that matters...
@realDonaldTrump I hope they stay focused as you are...
