@SpotifyCares can I have a refund or something. I've been a paid subscriber for years and dealing with this for months.
@SpotifyCares the Walkmen, Modest Mouse, the babies, no real pattern.
@SpotifyCares it's weird, it happens only on my iPhone and across any station. I'll find it in Dizzy Gilespie Radio, The National
@SilentTruth_LV @VZWSupport @ATT there's no customer in customer service from Verizon. Though I give credit to the comm managers for trying.
@SpotifyCares plus the song variety algorithms are lame, why the same song off albums in radio instead of mixing it up, gets predictable.
@SpotifyCares Nope. What happens is that it gets stuck on a loop of the same three songs. I reinstall like once a week.
@VZWSupport can you follow me so that I can?
@SpotifyCares in artist radio mode it will get stuck in a repeat of the same three songs.
@SpotifyCares yeah and thats pretty thorough. I've reinstalled on my iPhone numerous times and still have the same prob.
@VZWSupport I need a new phone before a work trip, I know what I want. Who sells it to me is up to @VerizonWireless
@VZWSupport help me figure out a way to purchase a needed new phone 5 weeks early. I'm not asking for a discount or anything free.
.@SilentTruth_LV @VZWSupport edge plan, that's what she said. It's just bad #math and left me confused. 5 weeks for 10 years. #AT&amp;T
.@VZWSupport the option was to pay outright for the phone. It's cheaper to buy out the contract and switch carriers. Odd #businesspractices
.@VerizonWireless a decade-long customer can't upgrade a phone 5 weeks early instead of forcing them to carrier shop. #CustomerSatisfaction

@VerizonSupport Safari Version 6.0.2 on a Mac 10.7.5 and everything is up to date.
@VerizonFiOS To be transparent, I got FireFox to work this morning though. Maybe you should look into Safari issues.
@VerizonFiOS Thanks for getting support involved. I had issues again this morning with Safari, like support said to use.

@VerizonSupport Glad to hear from you. Every post I've shared with issues has been used with Safari. It's my default. I had another this AM.

Why is it so hard to pay my Verizon bill? The site fails and spins, and provides the worst Internet experience I have each month.

@clynenamuo email me at Justin.McAneny@hibu.com in re: Sierra Vista magazine
Hi Burlington, excuse me, South Burlington -- you've got a new magazine coming your way.  I think you'll like it.
Good morning Sierra Vista.  Tell your friends Sierra Vista magazine wants to write about you.
Anyone know anyone in Green Valley?  I'm working on that magazine next.
Sierra Vista magazine is coming.  Anyone want to write a brief column on what's going on around town -- like a 260 word tweet with photo.
Thinking food stuffs or local businesses that want a little brief would be interesting.
Hey Sierra Vista.  This first magazine is coming together nicely.  so much time before it's out though.  Anyone have future story ideas?
