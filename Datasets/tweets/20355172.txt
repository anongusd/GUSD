@ApostleDarrell Actually Apostle, I feel the same way. Be nice to also see the other side ease up on him just a touch.
@BakerGerhart Let's agree to disagree on the competence issue. Economy is already better than it's been in 16 years. That keeps up Trump's a 2 termer.
@ApostleDarrell Good point Apostle with one big exception. The media did cut President Obama quite a bit of slack.

@joeldude Best example is stupid def they put up to stop skin's 2 point conversion.Only 1 def down lineman? skins qb walked into endzone.
@joeldude Make no mistake I'd like to see em win.  But they're organized to lose. Hope I'm wrong.
@dalpeh Players not the problem. It's weak play calling.  Fired Off Coordinator last week. But, Def Coordinator also very weak.

@charlescosta Hi Charles.  The keyword here is "did."  Of course, we do no longer.
@firesideint Because as we said, we are part of the Internet Community and decided we should stand with them. It's that simple.
@joped Maybe so. But we can't do anything about that now. What we could do is withdraw support, which we did.
@joped Hi joped.  No so. Go Daddy changed it's postion on SOPA because Internet Community thought leaders reached out to us.
@GeorgeKirikos Credible enough George. Our name is now withdrawn from list of supporters, and we now oppose as IC requested.
@jimz1 Actually Jim we listed to the community and acted -- not so dopey. Should you decide to return you'll certainly be welcome back.
@charlescosta flip flopped? Internet Community asked us not to support SOPA and we withdrew support & now oppose it. What more do you want?
@GeorgeKirikos I suppose but Go Daddy is now aligned with Internet Community. Expect us to take whatever position Community takes.
@RyanJones Thought we were helping like we did with Child Protection etc. When IC reached out to us we withdrew. It's that simple.

@brandonkaid I'm NOT saying he can't comeback. I AM saying that his comeback will be much more difficult than Kobe's & Dave's.
@brandonkaid Consider Tigers bad press is a Tsunami compared 2 Kobe's priors. Also Tiger will have to overcome golf course heckling.
Letterman's comeback NOT predictor 4 Tiger. Dave dealt w/issue headon/not subject to public heckling like Tiger will be.
Kobe's comeback NOT predictor 4 Tiger. Reason: Kobe's part of team/blends in w/Lakers. Tiger's solo. More difficult.
