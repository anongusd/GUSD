@loves_nra @JVER1 Why don't you simply learn politics? Support pro-life anti-corporatist Democrats. GOP ran Congress 90% of time since 1994 (25 yrs) and changed nothing. They need their wedge issues ALIVE to keep you voting for them. That's why GOP gave ZERO funding for the Wall. @HonnieBunnie007
@DammitMorley @NYCGuy922 @RachelMiniK Says the dope who supports a white supremacist Israel.
@make_trouble @Lift_Angry_ Yea...because twenty-two million Russians getting slaughtered by Nazis just wasn't enough to have 700 movies and 4,000 TV episodes about their holocaust.
@Lift_Angry_ @RachelMiniK Yea...let's pretend AIPAC doesn't exist to pillage the US taxpayer. You're only retort is another junior high-school attempt at the race-card. Pathetic.
@NYCGuy922 @RachelMiniK As if you could refute my post. Everyone knows what Israel has become since right-wingers took over the government. A neo-fascist is a neo-fascist, period. Israel gets away with being a rogue nation because she has nukes and is the 16th richest nation no earth while stealing US $
@NYCGuy922 @RachelMiniK Let's talk about REAL anti-Semitism. The kind that allowed two-million Russians into Israel to bleach the nation white but never enough room for REAL Semitics like Palestinians or black Ethiopian and Sudanese Jews. Israel is a white-supremacist apartheid state and YOU know it.
@NYCGuy922 @RachelMiniK Sending billions to a foreign nation that is entirely useless to the USA is a strawman? A nation that spies on the USA, that massacres civilians to create more extremists in the mid-east just to keep playing "victim" and collect more billions from US taxpayers. That's a hard FACT
@ArmenianPope Speaking truth about the Israeli lobby raping the US taxpayer each and every year is wrong? Perhaps you have another country you may want to live in. Funny...Trump and the GOP allowed $38 billion to go to Israel last year but couldn't find $5 billion for his Wall.

@charliekirk11 Funny...you didn't care a flying fuck about who made money when Republicans were in control of Congress the last 25 years and pillaged taxpayers.
@Plantladi1 It's hard for me to put climate-change at the top when the GOP donor class is writing the laws in America to further wage-theft, pension-pillaging and offshore tax-evasion to maintain the trickle-down that's destroyed the middle-class the last 25 years of GOP control of Congress.
Trump on Kim Jong Un: I believe him		Trump on Putin: I believe him		Trump on MBS: I believe him		Trump on Michael Cohen: Dirty liar who can't be trusted -- Aaron Blake
@TentaclesOfYest @djmont @rauchway Funny...I wrote this 6 years ago in 2013. I just read it again and forgot that I mentioned Trump. I was livid after seeing Michael Beschloss rank Reagan higher than herpes because of his Cold War "contribution". 	https://t.co/lY5SMaTOhw
@TentaclesOfYest @djmont @rauchway After watching Grover Norquist and other conservatives spend millions to bribe townships to change their highway &amp; library names to "Reagan" and completely whitewash every criminal act Reagan did, that dictum became ever more truthful.
@dehjr2003 @onezepplin1 You're welcome! Now....to get the Democratic Party to understand how political persuasion works.
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway Just beware of right-wing central-planners disguised as "conservative" historians. They spent millions revising Reagan's legacy alone into a complete fabrication. Reagan could've easily spent his remaining years in jail but Dems were too afraid of backlash when GOP trades places
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway That's funny, right-wingers say Reagan spent like a drunken sailor to defeat the USSR. A fraud for Reagan tripling our debt. Because it was Carter who induced the USSR into Afghanistan to bankrupt their treasury by 1983 when oil collapsed. USSR never responded one cent to Reagan.
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway As I said...Hoover's last year at doing anything was way too late. Roosevelt simply added to that tax increase. The GOP did the same thing in 2008 with the bailouts. They did NOTHING for 8 years until the mortgage market collapsed. As usual, Democrats came in to clean up the mess
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway One party is trying to hold onto "old money" WASP power. The other wants benefits of social-democracy through good socialist programs, like social-security. GOP is clearly to blame. Without social-security that ends paying parent's medical bills, there would be no small business.
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway Not blaming Hoover for the Depression. I'm blaming Harding, Coolidge AND Hoover for the Great Depression. 12 years of abdicating over-sight and gutting executive branch watchdog agencies was clearly a prime reason. It's documented well in Schlesinger's 1955 "The Roosevelt Years"
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway FDR's belief in government spending to spur growth is exactly how World War Two finished FDR's plan. GDP went to 13% in 1936. Unemployment was 25% in 1933 and went to 14% in 1937. All BEFORE the war. Government spending is government spending no matter how we spin it.
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway Hoover was famous for saying, "The market will correct itself". And waited far too long to realize how foolish that was. He started way too late (Revenue Act 1932) to spur growth through government intervention. Trickle-down has been re-branded several times ever since. Same old.
@djmont @TentaclesOfYest @rauchway All consecutive GOP admins created economic scandals. TeaPot Dome, Savings&amp;Loan, CD Swaps etc...GW Bush and GOP Congress were even warned in 2003 by Buffet that $60 trillion in CD Swaps were "financial weapons of mass destruction". GOP religion is "laissez faire"...always.
@erlyonurse @CAGoldenBear @krassenstein Well...Natanyahu is family friends with the Kushners. They always welcomed the war-criminal / mass-murderer to sleep in Kushner's childhood bedroom years ago.
@Plantladi1 And repeating the same labels everyone already knows motivates GOP voters, not Democrats. Race-politics that hijacked class-politics ruined the left last 20 yrs. Abrams, Beto &amp; Gillum all took GOP race-baiting and ALL LOST. None of our best used ID politics. Not JFK, LBJ nor MLK

@northernana1962 @dotti1a That's my point. GOP voters aren't the brightest bulbs. The GOP Congress just gave $38 billion to Israel but couldn't find $5 billion for a Wall. They "pretend voted" 50 times to "repeal &amp; replace" under Obama, but under Trump, they did ZILCH. Divided government MAKES DEALS.
@Dd3262Donna @APEastRegion As I said...you're too stoooopid to understand politics.

@Dd3262Donna @APEastRegion Hey birdbrain...what don't you get about "a Senate filled with pro-life Democrats". GOP voters are too dumb to understand politics. If they voted for pro-life Democrats, abortion would have ended a decade ago. Vast MAJORITY of women either stayed home or voted for Trump in 2016.
@mamafleer Fifty-million women did not vote in 2016. Thirty-million voted Trump. SIXTY-million women didn't vote in 2018. 25-million women between ages 20 to 30 who use abortion most...NEVER VOTE. A Senate full of pro-life Democrats would've passed that bill. GOP simply wants to keep power.

@Dd3262Donna @APEastRegion You mean like YOU among other creeps who say all leftists support "killing babies". Like that? A Senate filled with pro-life Democrats would've passed that Born-Alive Bill because they already have the female vote. The GOP Senate would rather hold onto power. So you lie.
@zambo_dan @Riche31846049 @benshapiro Eight? Nope. The entire GOP uses safe seats to do their dirty work. Just like the entire Senate could not find ONE penny for Trump's Wall but found $38 BILLION of taxpayer's money to be sent straight to Israel. GOP voters are clueless. Pro-life Dems would've gotten the job done.

One word for Republicans whining about "political theatrics" ...BENGHAZI.	Except, Republicans awkwardly admitted their Benghazi hearings were a sham to discredit Hillary, with no piles of indictments, guilty pleas, jail sentences and TONS of evidence of collusion the GOP ignores.
@kennyplan @RRtexct07 @JoyAnnReid These GOP liars are saying, "You've done personal crime that's landed you in jail, so we WON'T believe that you did crime for Trump". Makes no sense whatsoever.
@DonTshirts @nonelite7 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan Good luck with your Trump Supreme Court you gave the USA for the next 25 years, you jackass. You deserve it.
@LittlesCreative Trying to make people, whose political power has moved BACKWARDS for 25 years, understand how to fix that situation, should be appreciated. Instead, I get naive fools telling me that I'm "uncomfortable". Fact is, when a faction of the left's coalition fails, it drags us all down
@LittlesCreative You have the logic of a ten year old. What is uncomfortable is naive fools who know zero about politics destroying the progressive movement from within. How does me trying to get YOU half-wits more power, make me uncomfortable? STOOOPID logic beyond belief.
@theblaze Easy. Erase all glorification of anyone or any thing. No holidays glorifying people or races or anything. No statues of Confederates or civil rights leaders. Everyone is offended. Teach history properly and there's no need for idol worship.

@mchl_42 bye, naive dumb person
@mchl_42 People like you are too lazy to create solutions. You spend days dreaming of ways to invent more excuses for failure at life. It's always "my victimhood" is better than yours and it never crosses your mind that people may not like you because you're dumb, ugly or poorly dressed.
@mchl_42 Just stop. Your political ideas have failed miserably the past 20 years and your faction has completely abandoned King's approach of recruiting whites instead of scaring them off with idiotic "privilege" smears.
@mchl_42 Your dream-world is just that. You babble on the past hour about racism and not ONE iota of SOLUTION. Because you can't change humanity and therefore zero solutions. Jesus Christ couldn't change the world, but you think simply blabbing on and on about racism mysteriously will?
@mchl_42 No birdbrain...you do something called class-politics through social-democracy that alleviates 90% of the byproduct of racism or any other kind of bigotry. Who cares if some old fart hates your skin if we get nationalized healthcare, education and transportation??? Wake up!
@mchl_42 No. I actually I have ideas, if you weren't too lazy to read them. You're entire strategy and zero solution based tactic of yelling "hey, racism!!" and smearing potential white allies hasn't worked since 1975. https://t.co/qvbIIwVgyk
@mchl_42 Am I talking to an onion? Racism is like any other pest, like rats or roaches. They can NEVER be eradicated, EVER. Not even with nuclear bombs. Until you learn the politics liberal democrats used that gave YOU every benefit you have today, you will continue to move backwards
@mchl_42 You and your foolish race-politics has done more damage to marginalized people than just about anything. You're just too politically dumb to know it. Doing the same thing over and over and getting the same results is called, "insanity".
@mchl_42 YOU'RE using the same tactics as Sharpton. You have NO ideas like social-democracy that would end poverty, which would end crime, which would end police interaction, which in turn, would end mass-incarceration. Your entire strategy is "hey look, racism exists!". Gee, who knew?
@mchl_42 I am telling you how MLK won politically. He is turning in his grave watching people like YOU and the other race-baiters completely ignore his strategies to deal with vast majorities that outnumber you 9 to 1.
@mchl_42 Learn some history. The civil-rights movement happened and got results, BECAUSE MLK got 1/3 to 1/2 of his marchers to be white. And yet you still can't fathom why your Sharpton-style strategy has been such a miserable failure the last 20 years.
@mchl_42 You are clueless how pie-in-sky your thinking is. You can only stop the symptoms of racism and that's through class-politics, not by alienating 70% of the population with dumb race-politics. Neither JFK, LBJ or MLK used it. They were politically savvy.
@mchl_42 Hey numbskull...MLK never pushed for the "Black Civil Rights Act" nor the "Black Voting Rights Act". He pushed for the "Civil Rights Act" and "Voting Right Act". No one cared about "gay marriage" until it became "marriage equality". Again, LEARN politics or get out of the way.
@mchl_42 Only a moron thinks he can even begin to stop bigotry. "Hey humans, stop being human". How clever. Why don't YOU stop the RAMPANT anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny and Asian-hate in the black community? Or get on board and push social-democracy that ends the symptoms of bigotry
@mchl_42 Then start your own CryBaby Party. Leave the Democrats and progressives alone. You've done enough damage because you're too naive to understand how politics works. Your "strategy" of whining and crying has accomplished ZERO the past 20 years and bring everyone else down with you.
@mchl_42 My ideas, you blathering moron are talking class-politics that win as opposed to your race-baiting politics that lost progressives the Supreme Court the next 25 years.
@mchl_42 You're race-baiting right now. You can't refute the ideas I put forth on this thread so you pretend I'm "uncomfortable" that you talk about the same crap we've all heard the past 20 years that ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING. It's simply embarrassing to hear.
@mchl_42 I'm telling those people their strategy has lost progressives government power because their idiotic strategy alienates the VAST MAJORITY and you're too naive to get it. You race-baiters can only talk about the past...you have ZERO ideas for the future.
@mchl_42 Telling poor people on opioids who can't pay their rent they don't matter because they're "privileged" is why YOUR idiotic strategy failed and your political power has moved BACKWARDS the last 20 years. You need to grow up, learn politics and talk ideas, not "hey look, racism!".
@mchl_42 What a vivid imagination you have. What world do you live in? The GOP certainly knows these numbers that you ignore or are just ignorant of. That's why they control government. https://t.co/AEoBA46QsZ
@DonTshirts @nonelite7 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan You're just too naive to know that ID politics works perfectly for the GOP and their 225 MILLION white targets to recruit from. ID politics NEVER works for Democrats and the smalls groups that do not identify with each other nor care about each other. Do the fuckin math.
@mchl_42 How about stop ruining the Democratic party and the progressive movement because your "victimhood" is the only thing you can talk about. Grow up or start your own crybaby party.
@bishara_pierre No. I won't shut up. This race-baiting strategy of the politically naive has ruined the progressive movement for a generation.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl @SenSanders Well...there's 16 candidates so far and the action hasn't even begun yet. There will be another ten soon. Again...the Dems are clueless how to sell social-democracy, which is exactly what FDR did, because he was a social-democrat, as are most Dems.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl @SenSanders READ the damn post
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl @SenSanders I didn't support Bernie because he I didn't think he had a chance and he wasn't vetted. I do like his platform...but even he is clueless how to explain / persuade social-democracy.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl @SenSanders Well...you obviously didn't read a word of it before you spewed that junk.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl @SenSanders Read the damn essay before you spew this idiocy. Then delete your post, it makes you look silly.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl Obviously, you don't know what social-democracy is. You should. It's your new favorite platform. Right-wingers like to debate "socialism" because they can't debate social-democracy. When they say, "show where it has worked"...tell them this... https://t.co/QkQm8xMZ9C
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl When the Republicans collapsed the economy, AGAIN...people thought Obama would "jail the bankers" etc...Racists and non-racists were hoping for a new economy. Tea Party was just as anti-corporate as the left. People did not understand that Obama's Congress was 70% conservative.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl Bringing social-democracy to America is the only issue ANYONE should be talking about, because it helps EVERYONE. Not issues that only help tiny groups.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl What agenda? Those people who voted for Obama twice, then voted for Trump were class-issue voters. They were like DixieCrats (a lot of klansters) that FDR used to win election and give the USA the New Deal. Without DixieCrats, there would be NO NEW DEAL...no Social Security etc
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl You are responding to your own strawman fake argument. No one here has yet to show why the left should not be talking class-politics instead of race-politics since identity-politics has been such an immense failure the last 20 years.
@justneedavacypl @wil_mic If you were in the know...you would be asking why 25% of Obama voters voted for Trump? Telling poor people who can't pay their rent that their pain doesn't matter because they're "privileged" is the dumbest "strategy" on earth. Get it?????
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl As I said. You don't even know what the thread is about.
@justneedavacypl @wil_mic Yes...and why the Republicans now control the Supreme Court for the next TWENTY-FIVE fucking years. I guess that "news" to you, huh?
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl You can't even debate like an adult. This thread is about the utter failure and stupidity of identity-politics vs class politics and you pretend the debate is about voting. Lay off the ganja.
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl Are you really this IGNORANT of history? Black poverty was 90% in 1955. After JFK's programs and LBJ's Great Society programs, black poverty went down to 30%. Now, let's hear YOUR strategy...oh yea...Nazi!!!! Stay in school kid.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl You don't know what you're doing. If you did, you wouldn't be spewing this nonsense defending the miserable failure of identity-politics that hijacked class-politics...that the rest of the WORLD has used to bring social-democracy to their nation and helped millions out of poverty
@justneedavacypl @AaronDunlap72 He won't debate...he's too busy calling people Nazi out of pure dumbness. He's a blocker type. No retort. Call "Nazi" than block.
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl You're too stupid to "debate". You can't refute, sorry. Your whole argument is "nazi!!". That alone means you're dumber than a doorknob.
@justneedavacypl @wil_mic Most don't care either. Why not give up the "I'm a victim" strategy that's failed miserably the last 20 years and try adult politics like the rest of the modern industrialized world?
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl Why don't you actually refute my statements? Birdbrain...
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl No. Your ego &amp; pride have blinded you to pragmatic politics. Simple as that. You'd rather scream "racism" and pretend you're actually telling ANYONE something new. It doesn't get more naive than that. Gee, who would've known there was racism without you enlightening the world?
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl That's all you have. You can't refute my posts.
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl As I said in those exact post...your "strategy" of surrendering
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl You couldn't debate your way out of a toilet paper bag.
@justneedavacypl @wil_mic And what are you drowning in besides ignorance of how politics works....self-pity?
@AaronDunlap72 @justneedavacypl I said the byproducts, you dope. Read before spewing nonsense.
@wil_mic @justneedavacypl Your interests have gotten the left ZILCH the past 20 years and gave the GOP a right-wing court the NEXT fuckin 20 years. Wake up, learn politics and realize that class issues help EVERYONE. Your selfish interests help very few and are impossible to remedy...a pipe dream.
@_kelsology all of them
@justneedavacypl What a great way to defend accomplishing nothing but an ego-trip.
@justneedavacypl Why not spend your time talking to people about the future and social-democratic ideas like national health, education and transportation instead of the past that only pertains to you...but the vast majority could not care less about?
@nonelite7 @DonTshirts @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan For giving you sound political advice?
https://t.co/suK8AzDc40
@justneedavacypl Good luck, because you're wasting your time. The industrialized world is moving into social-democratic progress while the left in the USA is trying to stop something that's been around since the beginning of time and will never end unless humans stop being human.
@nonelite7 @DonTshirts @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan That statement is dumber than cornflakes. The GOP has 225 MILLION white people to "recruit" into "victims". The Democrats trying to imitate the GOP and motivate 38 million blacks has failed the last 20 years. The right-wing now controls EVERYTHING. Utterly stupid strategy.
@justneedavacypl Prejudice is not a thing you can end, EVER. Racism is taught but everyone is BORN to fear the "other"...lest we abandon our natural defenses. Try stopping the rampant homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism in the black community. Ending poverty alleviates 90% of racist byproduct
@justneedavacypl The people we need to vote for progress don't care a WHIT about your experience. Small groups constantly trying to prove "victimhood" gets you politically NOWHERE. Social-democracies like Canada NOW have the wealthiest most educated middle-class ON EARTH, while we blab about race
@sfrow @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan Maybe some people are sick and tired of watching social-democracy go down the toilet year after year as the world surpasses the USA because class-politics has been hijacked by utterly naive race-politics that never accomplishes ANYTHING???
@justneedavacypl YOU proved my point precisely. Identity-politics fools are so utterly naive, that they think Democrats trying to motivate tiny DISPARATE groups of voters by using race-politics is comparable to the GOP motivating 70% of the white population and turning THEM into "victims".

@marcorubio You have the mind of a Trumper.
@amyklobuchar Avoid identity-politics and the "reparations" fantasy nonsense and you'll be fine. POC aren't stupid, they know whom to vote for without being bribed like children. Remember, Abrams, Gillum and Beto ALL took the GOP race-bait and responded to it...and they ALL lost.
@Barracuda_Bella Because right-wing corporate distribution of American wealth into THEIR POCKETS while keeping wages exactly the same has worked so well the past 25 years.
@DonTshirts @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan Yea...because your "victimhood" strategy has worked so well the last twenty years. Progressives now control all levers of government...oh wait
@justneedavacypl @nugslilsis @heretocorrect @ScannerDarkly82 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan If that's your take from this thread, get some reading comprehension skills. People of ANY color too stupid to understand political and social messaging should bother everyone.
@nugslilsis @heretocorrect @ScannerDarkly82 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan I knew the "background" forty years ago at 12 studying history. Nothing changes if we harp on the same crap that alienates the VAST majority that COULD NOT CARE LESS. There is NOTHING new in crying "victimhood" except the creation of more Trumpers. No one is being "awakened".
@heretocorrect @ScannerDarkly82 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan And you're too utterly stupid to understand what your naivety has done for the next 25 years of a right-wing Supreme Court
@ScannerDarkly82 @nikasmith8 @SonOfGodAndMan Clueless doesn't begin to describe what your naive ilk has done to destroy the progressive movement and advancement of social-democracy by hijacking class-issues with race-politics. Learn how politics works or GTF out of the way.

@CardenasElanie @LBIrulz @ACTBrigitte "Everyone" doesn't believe in a book written 3000 years ago by politicians calling themselves "religious leaders" or Moses or any other name to bamboozle the populace w/ the audacity to tell people WHAT GOD WANTS.

@gsl6464 They got fired after MONTHS of attacks by real journalists
@FightingMonarch @gsl6464 You immense asshole. I don't follow Lara Logan or know anything about her until tonight's old interview. Go play pretend hero at your high-school.
@gsl6464 Probably because she actually apologized and said she was wrong. Show me that on FOX...which had people like Bill OReilly, for YEARS... among others, who harassed women the entire time they were there.
@MikkelsonsMad @Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter No. According to any historian before Reagan took away the "equal time" law so that right-wing billionaires like Rupert Murdoch and his billionaire Saudi Arabian investors that own FOX, could bamboozle Americans at will.
@gsl6464 Two weeks for profanity??? That's hilarical!!! Any real suspensions?
@gsl6464 Brian Williams was suspended for SIX months for exaggerating his resume`. Show me anyone on FOX suspended for inventing their 3000 or 5000 "news" stories over the past 20 years.
@gsl6464 Fox...a registered "entertainment network" also doesn't have any journalistic standards.
@Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter Just stop. In 1922, Mussolini pushed as his political platform, the "Fascist Manifesto of the Corporate State". The top 15 or 20 corporate heads in Italy met and organized a "march on Rome", installed Mussolini as head and themselves as cabinet. Hitler copied Mussolini thereafter
@gsl6464 70? That's it? I could show at least 70 expose` of right-wing fake "news" on the Daily Show alone just covering Fox.
@Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter That's as junior high-school as it gets. Hitler murdered his entire left-wing that he used to gain power just one year after taking power. If you studied history, you'd know that. After corporations funded the Nazis, Hitler went full right-wing nationalist until the end.
@Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter Then you never really studied history, politics or fascism. Before far right-wing weirdo propagandists like D'Souza &amp; Jonah Goldberg tried to revise history to bamboozle the dumb, all historians agreed what fascism was, a right-wing corporate invention to profit off world-war
@gsl6464 Wow...Lara Logan is built like a stripper. Came with a push-up bra to interview
@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen Good. Then know this. Conservative Republicans have had control of Congress, our money &amp; border 98% of the time since 1994 or 25 YEARS. Democrats have had FIVE-MONTHS of filibuster-proof majority that entire time. The result is our worst wealth-disparity since the Gilded Age.
@gsl6464 Left-wing media is "slanted left" mostly by omission. Right-wing media like Fox, Breitbart etc... tends to out-right INVENT their "news". From death panels to Benghazi etc...	The left tends to use "smear" by telling stories that are without completed investigations like Ferguson.
@gsl6464 What happened was REAGAN...the con-artist of the century, ended "equal time"...where anyone could challenge a media statement with an opposing view. So right-wing billionaires Rupert Murdoch &amp; Saudi investors created FOX broadcasting to dumb-down America beyond recognition.
@patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Chet_Unicorn @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter Yea...and I bet you also believe the Democratic Republic of North Korea is a democratic-republic and that GOP "right to work" states doesn't really mean "right-to-work-for-peanuts".
@gsl6464 If the left would have stuck with "class" issues as their focus, the GOP would cease to exist. Not ONE of our best civil-rights Presidents or leaders used identity-politics to win their agenda. Not JFK, not LBJ, nor MLK.
@ChewyYorkie @voxdotcom You are truly dumber than cornflakes.
@gsl6464 The "left" tried to compete w/ the "right" who told whites they were "victims" (Southern Strategy). The left never realized this strategy can not work w/ minorities because none of the disparate groups identify w/ each other. GOP tells 225 million whites (70%) they are "victims".
@ChewyYorkie @voxdotcom You refuted nothing because you made up your own argument...and a straw-man at that.
@gsl6464 We have to compare apples to apples. Canada is a social-democratic nation where basic needs of citizens are provided. Canada has the wealthiest, most educated middle-class on EARTH. This is my entire point. USA could've had social-democracy YEARS ago, but race-politics ruined it.
@ChewyYorkie @voxdotcom You're too stupid to follow a simple thread. NONE of your dopey comments has anything to do with the fact that the VAST majority of people with money do whatever they can to avoid living in places they deem poor and crime ridden...regardless of race.
@ChewyYorkie @voxdotcom What does that have to do with the fact that rich people do not want to live near the poor? Stop trying to bamboozle people.
@gsl6464 The huge black migration north during the 1930's, 40's and 50's were into major US cities. Montana and Vermont were not destinations. And white poor in those states are not comparable to inner-city poor whites. The VAST majority of rich simply do not live among the poor.
@ChewyYorkie @vox If you had a brain left in your wee little skull, you'd know blacks neighborhoods have triple the poverty of whites and triple the crime rate. But, you're too busy virtue-signaling to read books aren't you? Get that ego problem checked.
@ChewyYorkie @vox It's called FACT much. Idiot.
@gsl6464 Significant numbers of rich people live near poor white people? Sell me some of that ganja please. That alternate universe sounds delightful.
@Taxpayers1234 @Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter And Eisenhower was no dummy, like the fools on this thread. He knew he helped to defeat more than some crazed race-supremacist. He helped to defeat the European military-industrial complex that made a huge profit on Hitler's war-making and why THEY backed him in the first place.
@Taxpayers1234 @Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter What an immense dope. Just because THEY INSTALLED these dictators didn't mean they could control them. Hitler INDEED protected corporate property throughout the war. American corporations did business w/ Germany before, after and DURING the war and why Eisenhower gave that speech
@gsl6464 Basing these CLASS distinctions on race is entirely BOGUS. People simply don't want to live near poverty and therefore, crime. Do a study on where ANY wealthy white OR black people live (hint: no where near any poor white people). Race-politics has ruined the voice of the poor.
@NegusHamitic Basing these CLASS distinctions on race is entirely BOGUS. People simply don't want to live near poverty and therefore, crime. Do a study on where ANY wealthy white OR black people live (hint: no where near any poor white people). Race-politics has ruined the voice of the poor.

@davereaboi @Cernovich So, right-wing billionaires controlling everything and emulating Soviet central-planners doesn't bother you, eh? Read at least ONE history book. Start with "Fascist Manifesto of the Corporate State" pushed by Mussolini before being installed as dictator by the top 20 corporations

@Taxpayers1234 @Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter Huh? So the top 20 corporations didn't install Mussolini as dictator and themselves as his cabinet in 1922? So Krupp Steel, IG Farben, Thysson and Ford Motor didn't fund Hitler? So when US troops landed in France in 1944, the Germans weren't driving trucks with Ford engines, huh?
@Chet_Unicorn @patrickhenry2nd @Taxpayers1234 @Jack0Spades @usc91787 @KurtSchlichter Problem is...most conservatives &amp; GOP voters don't know what left-wing is. Fascism &amp; Nazism were and are right-wing CORPORATE inventions. If you don't know that Hitler was entirely funded by corporations and Mussolini was literally installed by corporations, you need education.

@DrugWarVictim @vbspurs Democrats had FIVE-MONTHS of filibuster-proof majority in Congress the last TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. The GOP controlled Congress, the money and border over 90% of the time. There's one group to blame for almost every single problem in the USA today...and it's not liberals or Democrats.

@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen @realDonaldTrump You claim that it's better to see the "big picture" and that you study economics. I studied history, politics and economics. No one can get the "big picture" without studying all three. They are completely intertwined.
@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen @realDonaldTrump FDR had a 70% liberal Congress and why we created the strongest middle-class after the Great Depression. Obama had a 70% CONSERVATIVE Congress...the exact opposite. When billionaires own 70% of your Reps, you end up with oligarchy.
@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen @realDonaldTrump Reagan was last century's greatest con-artist; convincing millions that turning millionaires into billionaires through lower wages, tax cuts &amp; offshore tax-evasion would make their life better. GOP ran Congress over 90% of the time last 25 years. There's only one group to blame.

@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen @realDonaldTrump Harding, Coolidge and Hoover all abandoned government oversight...as did Reagan-Bush...as did Bush-Cheney, even after Buffet warned GOP Congress and Bush to reign in $60 trillion in bogus CD Swaps. Their laissez-faire scammery ruled the GOP every single time, as they did NOTHING.
@GKorovski @walkawaylib @coachlaitinen @realDonaldTrump Then read more. 8 to 12 years of GOP deregulation to the point of malfeasance is not small change. And they did that before every major economic and banking collapse. To pretend otherwise is simply naive. Trickle-down is USA's greatest failure.
@Cscoggins6 @RussellFnTX @tedcruz Yea...the GOP re-brands trickle-down scammery every other election when their base, who have the memories of fleas, forgets or just doesn't have the brain power to know, it's the worst failure in American history.

@veravelfalsa You're making no sense. First you say the workers own the means of production, now say they partake in the free-market. You're describing social-democracy.
@veravelfalsa Plus...democratic-socialism is utterly politically naive as a platform. It's name is like cancer to the majority of voters and it's only record is a failure. It's the polar opposite of laissez-faire capitalism. Strict socialism, like strict capitalism gets the same exact results.
@veravelfalsa I know what Democratic Socialism is...that's how I know it doesn't work half as well as social-democracy.
@monaeltahawy Why the hair-cut???????
@veravelfalsa Social-democracy is beating capitalism AND socialism because capital incentive is needed to spur growth &amp; innovation. Socialist programs BOLSTER the free-market and equalize distribution of productivity gains and maintains a middle-class and prevents capitalism from eating itself

@chrislhayes I think Mueller simply wants Trump to be ousted in the voting booth. His evidence would probably put Trump in jail for the rest of his life. It's too embarrassing and all fear backlash. Democrats could have EASILY jailed Reagan, but didn't. GOP could have removed Clinton w/ votes
@maxtaves @CapehartJ Black women are 6% of the electorate and 11% of Democrats. Every group likes to pretend that they're the "bedrock" of the party. Fifty-million women, twelve-million blacks &amp; fourteen-million Hispanics did not vote in 2016. Those under attack most, CARED THE LEAST. GOP knows this.

@acipollo @doya_meade @HWDConservative @BarackObama The MONEY is controlled by Congress. And who gives a flying fuck if Obama agreed with it? The US taxpayer getting raped year after year by a foreign extortionist like Israel is disgusting. Wake up.
To be clear, the Senate  intelligence committee has not found evidence that Trump is not a traitor, either.
@Karoli @MSNBC Bernie Sandals?
@NathanLerner If he starts off with his usual attack, say, "Why, because 30 years of Republican wage-stealing, pension-pillaging, offshore tax-evasion scams and allowing their corporate buddies to filthy the planet has worked so well?"
@NoahPollak Why are YOU supporting foreign massacres?
@KurtSchlichter So there's no Trump email to Putin telling him that he's his secret lover, because Trump doesn't know how to use fukin email. That doesn't mean we all can't see Trump massively boot-lick Putin month after month. Any jury would convict this obvious traitor in minutes.
@Tim_Price_1971 Trump accomplishments:		No Wall	No 6% GDP	No repeal &amp; replace	No change in N Korea	No defeat of ISIS	No real mid-class tax cuts	No tax returns. 		EVERY SINGLE PROMISE BROKEN (and with a GOP Congress!)		Oh yea...TAX CUTS for billionaires?...DONE!
@BtstphHottotrot @doya_meade @HWDConservative Is that why Red states like Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee depend on 40% of their revenue from the federal government? The Blue states are getting pretty damned tired of you leeches.
@acipollo @doya_meade @HWDConservative It was passed by the GOP Congress, who controls the MONEY. It went through last year and Trump and the GOP could have stopped it at any time.
@Jay_see_see @doya_meade @HWDConservative Iran received their OWN money and STILL have NO NUKES. Unlike North Korea where Trump failed MISERABLY.
@Tim_Price_1971 Nice try at high-school propaganda. The GOP has been running Congress 90% of the time the last TWENTY-FIVE years...since 1994. They had all three branches the last two-years. There's only one group to blame for almost every single problem in America.
@Tim_Price_1971 You may need to visit some of the laissez-faire capitalist nations listed below. https://t.co/sbHQcIep43

@benshapiro So you actually believe Israel should have extorted $38 BILLION from US taxpayers LAST YEAR while USA infrastructure crumbles? Don't you think pushing fake anti-Semitism actually hurts work against real anti-Semitism...against real Semites, like Ilhan Omar?

@MariaBloom301 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Exposing bribery is not racism. Stop watering down real racism and crying wolf to pretend you're "woke". Social-justice ego-virtue-signaling is ruining the real cause.
@charliekirk11 Trump was never worth more than $500 million. He never became a billionaire. He's totally embarrassed to show his tax returns. The Clinton's and Obama wrote books and gave speeches. Stop being jealous of people in demand...unlike YOU.
After some of us have been screaming for fifteen-years for the "Single Tax", a wealth-tax that also eliminates income-taxes, we have Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Warren Buffett on board as well as a few writers. The founders however, were way ahead.	https://t.co/VbcGzYw6c5
Let's understand exactly what taxing wealth means. As we tax wealth, we also eliminate taxes on income to prevent capital flight. The actual wealth-producers flourish as the hoarders and parasitic-speculators that cause asset bubbles and deep-recessions disappear. Jefferson knew.

The "left" needs to learn that the easiest foot-in-the-door for social-democracy is the "Single Tax". Progressives love it AND so do conservatives. It is the only economic platform that appeals to the populist base in BOTH camps as well as business thought-leaders in both parties https://t.co/PcqzkZsQ6M
@princessjodita @ChrisRConrad @RadioFreeTom @CharlieMSte Before the 1913 income tax, we never had a Great Depression, nor a Great Recession. Below should be the economic platform of the Democratic Party since they haven't had one in decades. This alone would recruit conservatives and independents for a decade. https://t.co/7lgqqV87xS
@Sweet_PeaBelle Because they're not as stupid as YOU think they are.
@LisainBuffalo @RadioFreeTom @Van_Firth @jeffwilsontech The founders made USA so OWNERS paid ALL taxes. There was NO income tax until 1913. USA became economic giant by raising 90% of taxes on state property. If you owned 40% of community assets, you paid 40% of taxes. Today, top 20% own 92% of assets &amp; but pay 69% of revenue. LARCENY
@allfromthegator @RadioFreeTom For years, USA boasted having the richest middle-class. Since 2015, Canada has the wealthiest, most educated middle class in the world. After 30 years of conservative GOP wage-theft, pillaging pensions &amp; offshore tax-evasion, free-market social-democracies are surpassing the USA.
@RadioFreeTom Because right-wing corporate central-planning is no different than Soviet central planning if results are exactly the same; a few stealing productivity gains of many. YOU'RE not an average American who's wages stagnated for 25 yrs straight while 2% multiplied their income by FIVE
@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Because all religious nuts know God's will.

@Ostrov_A Why don't you ask for an actual investigation, since some investigation results years ago turned out to be a Jewish guy turning over tombstones in a Jewish cemetery.
@DKElections @DavidNir What kind of jobs?
@owillis @DavidNir That's just emotional pride and prejudice. We need to win elections, not popularity contests. There would be no New Deal if FDR didn't garner DixieCrats to vote against the rich. Identity-politics has done enough damage to the advancement of social-democracy and climate issues.
@neeratanden THIS is the crux of why free-market social-democracies produce more wealth per-capita then either GOP fake "wage-theft capitalism" or strict socialism. The entire left must be on the same page on this and use the language of business. https://t.co/sp1SSpk3W9
@lillith6 @sahluwal First, it will never end because we really don't expose it all.	Second, racism isn't the problem. It's a minuscule percentage. Class and simple prejudice (discrimination against fat people, ugly, poor, stupid etc) are way more prevalent. https://t.co/CZzdW9s4Ns
@BarbHuber9 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Every poll says MOST African Americans want the Democrats to NOT resign. Especially since not one Republican has resigned for their actual CURRENT racist actions...not 30 years ago.
@DavidAFrench Same goes for the Orthodox Jewish community. Religious indoctrination is almost prerequisite to sexual deviance. And aren't ALL "conservative" organizations the best "hide-out" for sexual deviants? That's why they're all so blatantly anti-sexual anything...their best distraction.

@AOC It is ALWAYS about the poor, in every nation, since the beginning of civilization. Race is 5% of the problem. No need to alienate the vast majority. That's what the GOP wants as ammunition to show white people under attack.
@ChrisChristie 90% of all taxes raised from 1787 to 1913 was from state property taxes and 10% from excise. If you OWNED 40% of the community's wealth, you paid 40% of taxes. THAT is fair share. Today the top 20% own 92% of wealth, and pay only 69% of revenue. THAT is GRAND LARCENY.

@amyklobuchar If you want to be taken seriously, than LOOK SERIOUS. All over-smiling is deemed disingenuous. No identity-politics. Gillum, Abrams and Beto all took the GOP race-bait and ALL LOST. The GOP will use any response to their race-baiting as an attack on whites.

@realDonaldTrump Funny, you and your party found $38 billion to give to Israel last year, yet mysteriously couldn't find $5 billion for your Wall when you controlled the entire government. Then again, how would you get all those illegal workers YOU hired if there actually was a Wall?
When I explain the "Single Tax" to progressives, they say, "What a great progressive idea". When I explain the "Single Tax" to conservatives, they say, "What a great conservative idea". I know of no other economic platform that does that.

@ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon Consumption taxes don't give incentive to hoarders to use their assets to best use. If a billionaire comes to town and buys up 80% of the best land, everyone must pay him rent at his prices. He should be required to pay 80% of all taxes due to run the town...as the founders said.

@ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon Before income tax, that took the burden of taxation off property, the USA never had a Great Depression or a Great recession or continuous deep recessions as we have today. Only the Single Tax destroys all economy destroying asset bubbles. The rich are gutting the USA since 1913
@ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon Only the "Single Tax" (tax assets, not INCOME) can incentivize asset hoarders to produce wealth. AND destroy all bubbles as no one will accumulate assets that are highly taxed. USA became an economic giant raising 90% of all revenue from state property tax &amp; 10% excise until 1913
@ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon Flat &amp; consumption tax both give no incentive to monopolist-hoarders to do something w/ their monopoly. The founders brilliantly decided, after much deliberation, that taxing property forced the worst asset-hoarders to grow food, build a factory or housing to RECOUP their taxes.

@ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon That's pure bullshit. The founding fathers even wanted to outlaw all corporations at one time for fear they would do, WHAT THEY ARE DOING, gutting the nation. The founders wanted OWNERS to pay ALL taxes. And based on property, a WEALTH tax, as USA did until 1913 before income tax
@RenegadePizaGuy @ItsMeAgainStill @camp_bean @KassyDillon Yet, you can't refute any of it. Fact is...GOP has run Congress AND our money AND our border over 90% of the time since 1994. That's TWENTY-FIVE fuckin years. There's ONE group to blame for almost every single problem in the USA and it ain't liberals, Dems, or progressives.

@steph93065 @Galaxicanicus @RealSaavedra @IlhanMN Were you nuts crying when Trump &amp; GOP gave Israel $38 billion last year? GOP's been giving them $13 billion EACH year since they've controlled Congress and money since 1994. USA infrastructure is crumbling as Israel EXTORTS billions. No wonder Israel sabotages any peace plan.
How broken? Trump &amp; GOP gave Israel $38 billion last year. GOP has been giving them $13 billion EACH year since they've controlled Congress and money since 1994. America's infrastructure is crumbling as the Israeli lobby extorts billions. No wonder Israel sabotages any peace plan https://t.co/4oHlK7c2Kf
@chadfelixg Because if you adjust for inflation and actual worker productivity, the AVERAGE American hourly should have been $25 an hour, not $16 for 25 years straight. 	40 yrs ago corporate execs made 30 times worker's wages. Today, it's FOUR-HUNDRED times. It's grand larceny.
And the neo-fascist Israeli government is trying to censor Europeans and AMERICANS for stating the truth about it as "anti-Semitism". https://t.co/b6ggM30r42

@KMGGaryde @Sweet_PeaBelle For years, USA boasted having the richest middle-class. Since 2015, Canada has the wealthiest, most educated middle class in the world. After 30 years of conservative GOP wage-theft, pillaging pensions &amp; offshore tax-evasion, free-market social-democracies are surpassing the USA.

@SteveJax @cenkuygur @SpeakerPelosi I hear some using the dumb term, Democratic-Socialist. Social-Democrat is WAY better.

@angelas1126 @ChairmanComrade @carlosct @RNCastaldo @charliekirk11 @BernieSanders All economies have issues..but as long as THEY produce more wealth per capita and have higher standard of living than USA and even conservative biz mags admit they're better for business...we can ignore your billionaire propaganda
@LindseyGrahamSC Because Bush and Cheney conveniently "lost" 500k emails last time they did that

@riley_firestorm @watchingfoxes @Bigg_Jus @TheRebelTV @KurtSchlichter Yes, Confederate statues are not there to teach...They're there to glorify soldiers of treason and defenders of the worst cause in history. Young men sent to their deaths bamboozled by rich slave owners

@angelas1126 @ChairmanComrade @carlosct @RNCastaldo @charliekirk11 @BernieSanders Why don't you name ONE successful capitalist nation on earth without a social floor that built and maintains its middle-class. You won't, because you can't.
@OSayCanYouMeme @ric_gris @EdKrassen No. You're simply trying to invent your own argument.
@JShahadi Really? Somehow, during that entire time...the top 5% multiplied their "earnings" by FIVE hundred percent. CEO's now make 400 times average worker, not 30 times like 1980. GOP and Reagan opened border to THREE-MILLION illegals and immediately gave amnesty to get their votes.
For years, USA boasted having the richest middle-class. Since 2015, Canada has the wealthiest, most educated middle-class in the world. After 30 years of conservative GOP wage-theft, pillaging pensions &amp; offshore tax-evasion, free-market social-democracies are surpassing the USA.

@OSayCanYouMeme @ric_gris @EdKrassen You're not using any definitions at all except what you make up. This discussion was about socialist PROGRAMS and because you lost that argument, you want to make it about the entire economy and your socialist theory of choice.
@OSayCanYouMeme @ric_gris @EdKrassen Where you get this absurd idea of total elimination of free-markets is YOU making up your own definition as if any economy can't have gradations. Nationalizing any industry, like healthcare, is a socialist program. Period. Just stop your silly semantics and propagandizing.
@iamchampy @EdKrassen If you think 30 years of stealing wages, pillaging pensions, offshore tax evasion schemes and corporate ownership of Congress is "capitalism"....mmmmkay

@danvonbro @OSayCanYouMeme @ric_gris @EdKrassen No. You just don't want to admit that there's irony in the fact that it takes socialist programs to create a better free-market. FDR knew Social Security would free millions of people to start small businesses instead of using their savings account to pay parent's medical bills.
@OSayCanYouMeme @ric_gris @EdKrassen Nope. Most social-democracies. have some form of national education, national healthcare or national transportation. THAT IS government taking over the means to produce education, healthcare and transportation. It's simply cutting out the profiteer middle-man. That's socialism.

@ric_gris @EdKrassen They are free-market economies with socialist programs to create a strong social floor that bolsters their free-market. They are far from the perverted "capitalism" the USA has become from conservatives running our Congress the last 24 years. No wage-stealing, pension pillaging
@MissRuth1979 @SamiPlane @crimdefend @EdKrassen @hertzog_gary Their social-floor ALLOWS a much stronger free market. They are beating BOTH wage-stealing, pension pillaging, offshore tax evading fake "capitalism"...as well as socialism https://t.co/sp1SSpk3W9

@Alyssa_Milano So let's see. Trump insults every ally to make sure they will never trust us again. Then disparages and talks of exiting NATO. Now, he wants to allow Russia to re-build their nuclear arsenal to bully the region. Putin must think he died and went to heaven.
@thefedz1 @charliekirk11 Wrong. The social-democracies produce more wealth per capita BECAUSE their social-floor creates a STRONGER free-market. Not a perverted fake GOP "capitalism" like the USA with thirty years of stealing wages, pillaging pensions and offshore tax-evasion scams.
@ThurstonDana @molratty @brevius_scribe As long as we go back to the founding father's original intention that lasted from 1787 to 1913 and made USA an economic giant. They taxed WEALTH. And OWNERS paid ALL of the taxes. Not some...ALL THE TAXES. 	90% of all taxes were from property and 10% from excise.
@molratty The market is rigged. Republicans destroyed worker's unions and bootlicked corporate unions called LOBBIES.

@charliekirk11 Most third world economies had free-markets at one time but turned to socialism because their capitalist rich monopolized 99% of the wealth. There is not ONE successful capitalist nation on earth without a social floor that built and maintains its middle-class.
@danlivni @Ostrov_A Israel was fine letting in 2 MILLION Russians to make Israel as white as possible. But never enough room for dark Jews or real Semitics like Palestinians, just bleached European types. Many of those Russians CLAIMED to be Jewish to get asylum in the 1990's. I knew them personally
@vtethanjaiken @ewarren 90% of all taxes raised for 126 years until 1913, was from state property. 10% from excise.

@Kane632372258 @safiyabat @BridgetPhetasy @gtconway3d There was ZERO income tax until 1913. USA became an economic giant by raising 90% of revenue by taxing property.

@Ostrov_A You're attempts at censoring speech &amp; criticism against Israel's crimes against humanity is clear admission of your support for fascism. YOU talk about racism?

Every insane religious cult on earth does it, especially Abrahamic CULTS, Judaism, Islam &amp; Christianity. Maybe THAT'S why we have disease &amp; war.
@EWErickson @PressSec So God installed Obama to heal the sick and poor and then he let the devil and his minions play awhile as they took control of all three branches of government to try to take that healing away. Makes Biblical sense now.
@theblatt @matthewjdowd The "Single Tax" (Tax assets, NOT INCOME) as Democratic econ-platform would divide conservatives for 10 yrs. Imagine liberals calling to abolish income taxes &amp; IRS.

@DineshDSouza You get more immoral by the minute as your supporters who believe your filth, get dumber by the day.
@GOP Are you just jealous creeps or what? Nobody wants neo-Nazis at their party. Then again, Republican types never got invited to parties in high-school either. That's why you all became hate-mongering "conservatives" in the first place.
@charliekirk11 They can't vote without ID you half-wit, remember? Show us all the actual voting that took place. I'll wait.
@ACLU Wouldn't it be nice if you learned basic political tactics and stopped alienating the vast majority in America. Didn't you mean to say POOR PEOPLE? Race-baiting from the left is why right-wing racists are motivated and Trump is in the White House.
@LogicDefined @charliekirk11 Wrong. They left the area 2000 years ago. Pretending the descendents can come back to steal other's land is absurd on its face.

@mytaxesr2hi @topthomas @charliekirk11 It was REAGAN who opened the border to THREE MILLION illegals and immediately gave them amnesty to get their votes. THAT gave the greenlight to another 10 to 20 million to cross the border and hope for amnesty. Illegal immigration is Republican created and maintained debacle.
@mytaxesr2hi @topthomas @charliekirk11 #2 is most definitely true. If that border closes, the GOP has no fear-mongering tool left to scare the uneducated. GOP had 24 years to close the border, but their propaganda machine dupes their massively ignorant base well to believe "it's the Democrats", who haven't had control

@willishl @spahn_r @mikey_bits @HuffPost @ninaturner Abrams, Beto &amp; Gillum all responded to GOP race-baiting. GOP then used their response as an attack on white people and THEY ALL LOST. 12 million blacks, 14 million Hispanics and 50 million women did NOT vote in 2016. What century will the Dems learn who actually votes?
@willishl @spahn_r @mikey_bits @HuffPost @ninaturner Americans believe in "business", regardless how business stabs their backs. Until the Democrats learn to speak in business terms, nothing will change. Turn the "wealth tax" into the "Single Tax" (Tax assets, NOT INCOME) and conservatives will be divided for a decade.

@wwjoehd @pamelaparks_p @charliekirk11 How about $38 billion to Israel just last year? "America first" my ass. USA is in debt to trillions, yet Israel, the 16th richest nation per-capita with nukes, plays "victim" to extort $13 billion EACH and EVERY year for 30 years. A true scam

@charliekirk11 How dumb. Third world nations that are ingrained with authoritarian government almost always return to dictatorship regardless the economic system. Russia is no longer Communist. It is stone cold hard-core oligarchic CAPITALIST, like Saudi Arabia. Primitive minds need a dictator.
@charliekirk11 How ignorant. Red states like Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi rely on the federal government for 40% of their revenue. Those states don't tax their rich. The founding fathers wanted states to tax property for all revenue.

@dbongino The founders set up USA so OWNERS paid ALL taxes. Not some...ALL. USA became an economic giant raising 90% of revenue by taxing property. If you owned 40% of community assets, you paid 40% of taxes. Today, top 20% own 92% of assets but pay only 69% of revenue. GRAND LARCENY

@Marin_Brotha That's true about the excuse-making but doesn't discredit my point that Cernovich's implication that "this is how black people are treated by the police" is nonsense. Race has zero to do with it 99% of the time.
@Marin_Brotha You have to learn to follow a thread and points of a debate...not what you choose to inject into a debate that is meaningless to the point. Saying blacks are "targeted" is a bogus argument no matter how many videos you have of people making an excuse for police brutality.
@Marin_Brotha What does that have to do with the fact that saying blacks are "targeted" is a bogus argument? You want to debate a your own non-issue.
@Marin_Brotha You sound no different than the far-right...everything you disagree with is "fake news" or an "excuse"
@Marin_Brotha You are simply calling FACTS...excuses	https://t.co/6fD35RfNGH
@Marin_Brotha Just because you have no statistics to back your "assumptions" doesn't mean statistics are meaningless. Watching the same videos over and over is not statistics nor evidence of systemic excessive force.
@Marin_Brotha Why don't you debate my points instead of making up your own?

@iChooseHapi The Democrats are great at governing and correct on 9 out of 10 issues. They are still quite oblivious to winning politics. 50 years later and they still have zero economic platform anyone can instantly recite and use for persuasion.

@GreenMawnstah @OneSixtyToOne @Kris87929896 @ewarren The USA became a world economic powerhouse by 1870 on property taxes.

@bell_hm58 @GreenMawnstah @OneSixtyToOne @Kris87929896 @ewarren The Federal government can easily give states incentive to raise property and asset taxes as the states did for 126 years before the rich bamboozled Congress to impose income taxes on non-owners. Wealth creators paying income taxes on their own labor is truly absurd.

@spb324 For ex: The Single Tax (taxing assets &amp; property, NOT income) would incentivize land-hoarders to create housing, a factory or food to RECOUP those taxes. It would destroy ALL recession BUBBLES as no parasitic speculator wants to own taxed assets without producing income.

@blakerybob03 @simon_harms @brandonmoore60 @andrewtrivette @charliekirk11 @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano And I believe that "religion"...claiming to know God's will...is the utmost in arrogant insult to the very God people claim to believe in. To have faith over evidence in any relationship to God is a false belief and an insult. If you believe in "hell", then you "chose" nothing.
@blakerybob03 @simon_harms @brandonmoore60 @andrewtrivette @charliekirk11 @kathygriffin @Alyssa_Milano Hate has zero to do with it. Why on earth should anyone NEED religion to be a better person?

@JPHorn7 @iamed007 @Picman2018 @jsaxattax @thehill I wouldn't invade and occupy another nation, even if the UN pretended to have the power to do so in 1948 when Palestine was 80% Arab Muslim, 10% Christian and 10% Jewish.

@ideirdre @Chewcipher @RealTylerW @andiemain @TomiLahren And you keep making it about black children to protect your false victimhood and you ruined the entire cause because you are simply misinformed. The real issue is that, black and white cops protect each other WHEN THEY DO KILL.....ANY RACE.

Trump told everyone he was a great deal-maker. How is making foolish demands like a child and then storming out or extortion with a shutdown making a deal? That's because Trump never made ANY real "deals". He either sold his father's name or bought property from desperate sellers
Oil goes up almost $10 immediately since Trump bragged that the price dropped because he "made phone calls". His world is getting so threatened by evidence he committed collusion with Russia, his rantings are becoming beyond delusional.
@PeterJReason @Lawrence @realDonaldTrump The length of time Mueller is taking says he's building an ironclad case. Trump will resign in a deal to keep goofy Don Jr out of jail...or possibly himself if enough staffers who lied about meeting Russians turn evidence against Trumpsky.

@IAndreaAutin @BloodInMyShoe @babl1674 @CoincidencesQon @Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO That's right. The rich bamboozled Congress or paid them off to implement an income tax in 1913. That means YOU pay taxes on your labor...an absurdity if there ever was one. The founders wanted OWNERS to pay ALL taxes because they controlled the economic means to produce wealth.
@IAndreaAutin @BloodInMyShoe @babl1674 @CoincidencesQon @Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO The founders made USA so OWNERS paid ALL taxes. There was NO income tax until 1913. USA became economic giant by raising 90% of taxes on property. If you owned 40% of community assets, you paid 40% of taxes. Today, top 20% own 92% of assets &amp; pay only 69% of revenue. GRAND THEFT
@cero_matt @pajamagirl @SFlipp @Titou4004 @CalebJHull You mean Obama lied to give dopes like you healthcare the first time in their lives at the expense of rich people. Trump lies to enrich himself while in office or to avoid a prison sentence. The Swamp was NEVER this deep.
@awake_patriots @pajamagirl @GrabAmericaBack @SThomps72774109 @SFlipp @Titou4004 @CalebJHull Prove it. Every polling place has Republican poll watchers who can challenge any voter.

@officialpriest_ @Titou4004 @NRafter @pajamagirl @SFlipp @CalebJHull You don't know that. Trump and his staff made that up, knowing gullible people will believe it. Acosta is doing what most journalists are afraid to do...holding the worst liar "President" in American history accountable.

@SFlipp @adriana_nucci @CalebJHull Every single time the President lies, and that goes for any President, someone should ask, "Are you going to tell the truth next time". EVERY SINGLE TIME.
@Middle_Man_60 @CalebJHull Acosta asked a question pertinent to a so-called President that uses his office to lie on a daily basis because he's clueless on how government works.

@humanbeing0091 @pajamagirl @SFlipp @Titou4004 @CalebJHull It would be hilarical if any of the Presidents told Trump the Wall was a good idea, just to make him look like a fool when he pushes for it.

@CoincidencesQon @Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO Think the prison system. Many prisons now grow their own food. Prisoners farm the land &amp; taxpayers save money. Welfare programs should be based entirely on collective work on government farms. Want to eat? Work the farm. You get a room with a bed and job training. Do drugs? Leave
@CoincidencesQon @Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO Also, our right-wing Cold War stupidity at fearing socialism, actually made the welfare state inevitable. Anyone on welfare should be on a FARM growing food. It's called a commune. In Israel, it's a kibbutz. That's how people survived there before America started funding Israel
@CoincidencesQon @Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO No. Those programs brought black poverty down from 90% in 1955 to 27% today. Would you prefer, 90% on welfare? But as I said, there should have been time limits or sunset laws to say, "Take these reparations within a certain period or lose them". Welfare should not be forever.

@RealCandaceO You are correct on these points. However, just because the left has its fringe goofballs who use this language, doesn't mean the GOP is right on any other issue. You discovered flaws in the left and went full-swing to the right. The GOP is wrong on just about every other issue.
@Chavonn58133837 @TheBrianest @keeganmcm @SassyEconomist @SlightlyBreezee @PhilQCRod @RealCandaceO Intergenerational wealth was a problem until Affirmative Action, welfare, food stamps, Section 8 housing, lower college entrance criteria, minority business set-asides and quotas. FIFTY-YEARS of a hand up is enough. Either you took advantage of these programs, or you didn't.

Trumpers are totally clueless that Trump (for his re-election) suddenly decides to "fight for the Wall" &amp; "shut-down" government only when Democrats win Congress. 2-years of total GOP control of 3 branches, crossings at 10 year low from Obama and Trumpers are the last to know.
@CatsForTrumpUSA @maggieC13081910 @bigskyjim @charliekirk11 And you don't think it's funny that Trump suddenly decides to "fight for the Wall" and "shut-down" government only when the Democrats take over Congress, huh?

@CatsForTrumpUSA @maggieC13081910 @bigskyjim @charliekirk11 GOP HAD 24 YEARS to close the border.

Trump White House claims 4,000 suspected terrorists were caught crossing our southern border. Here's exact number, according to official government records.	It’s not 4,000. 	It’s not 400. 	It’s not 40. 	It’s not even 4. 	It’s 0. 	What do you call people who enjoy being lied to?

@riotwomennn Trump doesn't want that Wall. Some of us know he could stop crossings in ONE WEEK by jailing the Republican DONORS paying illegals to work here as cheap labor. He makes his requests unreasonable because HE needs that border WIDE OPEN to keep the rubes scared and voting Republican

@PhiRatio1618 And now you also know that the Republican welfare machine is the biggest scam on earth. You learned something... that they have bamboozled you the entire time. See how that works?

@PhiRatio1618 It means exactly what I said...75% of the US electorate did not vote for Trump. PERIOD. Very few people were that stupid.
@PhiRatio1618 Who said I was, numbskull? Get some reading comprehension skills.
@penny_lesner @hanselang @ClistonBrown @KurtSchlichter Exactly what I said. Where were the GOP challenges? They claim a lot but never show ONE challenge.
@GerardoH757 @mgsapia Like what, invade Sudan to find a man that moved all over North Africa and the Mideast? Absurd.

@AJP78 @KurtSchlichter You know zilch about elections. Trump garnered 62 million votes. That's about one-quarter of the electorate of 235 million voters. The vast majority did not vote for Trump.
@AJP78 @KurtSchlichter Is that why each time liberals try to tear down CONFEDERATE monuments to traitors, conservative sissies start crying and whining?

@AnnCoulter Ann...Do you understand the GOP needs that border wide open to scare the rubes into voting for them? How do you think billionaires get tax cuts? And GOP donors paying illegals for cheap labor would stop funding GOP campaigns. You've been snookered by the GOP elite for 20 years.

@townhallcom Dems want to arrest &amp; jail REPUBLICAN DONORS paying illegals for cheap labor. Ooops!...the GOP can't have that happen because crossings would STOP in ONE WEEK and an open border is needed to scare dopes into voting Republican for more tax cuts for billionaires. See how that works
@thatbyrdie @LBaptisia @ThePoundSymbol @charliekirk11 How do U feel subsidizing GOP's welfare machine? 	Billions in corporate welfare	Billions in oil, gas, farm subsidy	Billions to military toilet bowl	Billions in church property &amp; Faith Based Initiative	$38 billion to Israel last yr (13B each year)	TRILLIONS in offshore tax evasion
@Solidus316YT @Morgan_C_Ross @BrittanyJonesx0 @charliekirk11 When Bush had the chance to get Bin Laden, he refused because Bush's family does business with Bin Laden's entire family. The buck stops at the Commander-In-Chief. Obama said he would enter Pakistan if he had to...to get Bin Laden...he did and he did. Deal with it.
@BlakeW66756146 @KurtSchlichter Except, Alex Jones makes shit up out of thin air. The intel community knows Trump is compromised and are actually investigating as we speak. Why else would every single Trump staff member lie about meeting Russians and Trump so afraid to show his tax returns or condemn Putin?
@jilevin Right-wingers love to attack "socialism" because they can't attack social-democracy, which is a world apart from socialism. Social-democrats know a strong social-floor ALLOWS a stronger, more equitable, FREE-MARKET. Here's how one persuades independents: https://t.co/sp1SSpk3W9

@GerardoH757 @mgsapia Actually, when Bin Laden appeared in Sudan...Clinton sent missiles to kill him. After Clinton WARNED Bush and an actual MEMO was put on Bush's desk stating Bin Laden was preparing to attack...he ignored it. Now I know you get your "info" from FOX.
@GerardoH757 @mgsapia You know what the REPUBLICAN HOME OWNERSHIP SOCIETY was right? Oh, you probably weren't born yet. That's where the GOP Congress believed that most home owners vote Republican, so under Bush they forced Fanny to create low requirement loans.
@GerardoH757 @mgsapia Haha...more humor disguised as debate I see. So you think just 6% of total loans in default collapsed the economy? Try again.

It's pure bunk to bamboozle very dumb voters. Reagan got votes after he gave amnesty to 3 million illegals when he opened the border
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @GOP @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox By all means, the GOP elite should loudly back Trump, especially in November, 2020. Democrats need all the help they can get.
@moorehn @joke2power Take the heat or stop pretending you're "leadership" material. Your whining would be so unbecoming for any politician of any gender, kid.
@joke2power @moorehn Name a politician who is not attacked for being "unlikeble" by their opponents. Maybe stop coddling women, as if they're children, so they can actually gain respect.
@ashtonpittman The GOP will try to make ANY Democrat candidate "unlikeable". Since Democrats rarely fight back, or immediately back down and apologize, GOP attacks are simply accepted.
@davidluhnow @megancarpentier The UN should be occupying the top ten war-torn countries (and that includes drug wars) and setting up "safe-zones" for refugees.

@SomaliAthiest @klsbkkr @WillyNilly48_ @Ostrov_A Wars based on what? Trying to stop a European invasion? No one wants or cares about a two-state solution. There should be ONE SECULAR STATE with equal rights for all. No Jewish apartheid dictatorship, no Muslim religious state. No "Israel", no "Palestine". One Mid-East Union.
@klsbkkr @Ostrov_A Colonial Britain had no right to control other's land and the UN had no right to displace Palestinians, simply because they were voiceless. Israel has one good argument; that other nations refused entry when Jews were escaping Germany. Israel should not be TEN times original size
@klsbkkr @Ostrov_A The European invasion was just that...an invasion. No amount of spin will change the truth that Stalin and Truman gave the final go ahead to support a grand land-theft after years of Zionists using the Holocaust to gain sympathy to invent a nation after 2000 years. Preposterous. https://t.co/MqSpbe1MJ4
@klsbkkr @Ostrov_A If only the extremists that hijacked Zionism understood that raising a flag to declare a "Jewish state" in a defined territory called Palestine w/ 80% Arab Muslim population, 10% Christian &amp; 10% Jews was a grand mistake, they might set up ONE state with no Jewish dictatorship.
