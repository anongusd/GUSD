@yasielgrandal @gouxforever @USC_Rivals Why are we turning on the players now?? This has never happened. Ever. But somehow it’s the players’ fault? Our players are getting soft and spoiled? Funny, that didn’t even happen during the Sark and Kiffies shit shows. This is Helton and Helton alone.
@squince82 @BarstoolSC It’s a much better look for recruits to see tweets that question the character, work ethic, and ability of our players.
