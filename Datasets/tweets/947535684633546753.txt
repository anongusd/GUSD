@SenatorDurbin Last night u lost the argument in public, on national television. Your argument is 2 protect government jobs, Trumps argument is 2 protect American citizens. You‚Äôre gonna lose that argument all day. Mostly, because the wall will work, and that scares the crap out of u!

@BretBaier With the help of the likes of Flake, we have blood in the water, NK sees weakness due to the spineless rhinos, and the spineless FBI,DOJ, and media. Veto spending bill, and stick to your guns President Trump, most of America is interested in freedom!
@LarryMac28 So if the new pool company doesn‚Äôt work out, will you let us know?
@lunsfordjp @LarryMac28 A good recession?
@marklevinshow Sure he did.
@fredchever @marcorubio Caroline, there may come a day when you realize that your victimhood cost us more than you‚Äôre aware of today. I really don‚Äôt care about you personally, but I do care about our nation. Read the Constitution word for word, read the bill of rights word for word.
@BretBaier @RyanZinke Book me, I‚Äôm available after Christmas...
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Ok that‚Äôs the last straw, YOU‚ÄôRE A FOOL. STFU AND GO AWAY! It grieves me that a cent of my tax dollars will pay your fing pension. LOSER! Just so you are aware, I‚Äôm pretty sure most feel this way about you. It amazes me how low class our governing body has sunken.
@WHSVnews @WHSVChris It‚Äôs sorta like your political reporting.
@BretBaier Bret, while I don‚Äôt agree with this guys assessment, at some point you want to take a grain of this type of criticism. I am more convinced everyday we are at a tipping point. I believe you do have a blind spot, drive just an hour out of Washington, and talk to us.
@LarrySabato You‚Äôve lost your freaking mind. Face the fact that we are sick and tired of being ruled by the elite in Washington, and frankly Charlottesville.
@emperorbjork2 @SharylAttkisson Well you‚Äôre an idiot, the question is do you paid later! According to you you do. SO ITS TRUE!!

@AndrewCMcCarthy @jpodhoretz My opinion; the Weekly Standard and it‚Äôs group remind me of the people who love a good fight, as long as they don‚Äôt have to participate. Sort of like I‚Äôll tell you how to fight, but I‚Äôm not getting my hands dirty. Then Trump shows up. Cowering in the corner is what u do best.
@LarrySabato Larry you‚Äôre an arrogant mouth piece. You‚Äôre self importance is staggering. Using NBC as a source is delusional, get out of Albemarle County and do some of your own polling, you will find a different result.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @weeklystandard @BillKristol @jpodhoretz It‚Äôs not sad. If you‚Äôre a fool, you will pay for you‚Äôre stupidity. Bill Kristol is no martyr. Just fornthe Supreme Court justices alone he should have at least voted trump and kept his mouth shut.
@jrodentop1 @johncardillo The term ‚Äúlying‚Äù in Flynn‚Äôs case‚Äîas in so many of these cases of federal targeting‚Äîmeans nothing more than hours upon hours of interrogation in which the government then produces an alleged contradiction. Boom! Send him to prison! Is this justice?
@jrodentop1 @johncardillo James @Comey bragging &amp; laughing that he took advantage of the early transition‚Äîin a way he admits he would not have done to Bush or Obama‚Äîto entrap Flynn is a shocking revelation of the politicization of the FBI and the director‚Äôs abuse of power. (The liberal audience loved it.)
@jrodentop1 @johncardillo What exactly did Flynn lie about?
@SeanBradbery @realDonaldTrump Worth billions, what did you risk today to make a living?
@LarrySabato Ever heard of Bill Krystal? Before you overlook how much Trumps economy has lifted all those who are willing to work, maybe you should look into Bill Krystal‚Äôs destination.
@johncardillo Another small item, Flynn should be made financially whole, and not with tax payer money. Mueller should be personally responsible. Like to see a suit brought against Mueller.
@brithume No one believes the WaPo, Larry you aren‚Äôt relevant. I believe I remember you saying HRC would be President.
@BretBaier I‚Äôm so hoping you have me on the show!! Americans need to be heard! No more elite opinion, how about you go with real life on the ground middle America experience? Try it one time!!
@nprpolitics @brithume All a bunch of crap, but nice transition piece anyway.
@RepMarkMeadows Where did the content go?
@BretBaier Wish media look @ what‚Äôs going on &amp; report facts, Constitutional, lawful facts only. Zero innuendo from the media, &amp; unbiased reporting would be SUPER! The first 2 get this will b very successful, &amp; more importantly, respected. I decide. Oh yeah, I‚Äôm available as panelist.
@brithume Brit, thanks for coming over the middle America‚Äôs side!! Plz stay here. Tell Bret that since he‚Äôs asking for panelists, I‚Äôm available!!

@DGodfatherMoody The Cortez girl from the Bronx got elected. That is the bottom.
@benshapiro @tedcruz Ok, that‚Äôs funny.
@BillOReilly Not irrelevant, but here are several more reasons. First, as science becomes irrefutable it becomes clearer that things don‚Äôt match up, creating doubt. Secondly, it has become clear that Churches are businesses, and the people who run them become hypocrites.
@TomiLahren Why make this moron legit by asking her to be anywhere near you.
@brithume Brit, just when I think you understand what‚Äôs at stake, you drift back to the insular/swamp thinking. We the middle class of America are scared. You‚Äôre line of thinking scares us more. All in all, the last thing any elites should want is for us to be scared.
@JeffFlake Flake take a moment and check out the profiles of the people who support your ‚Äúprotect council‚Äù idea. It will tell you all you need to know about your grandstanding/current ignorance. Glad you‚Äôre leaving, I just wish it had already come to pass.

@BillOReilly Thank you for liking my tweet! You have no idea how it feels to be not heard, have no venue to say what I and many others want to say. We get to vote, and hope that it‚Äôs fair, that‚Äôs it. Thank you Bill for your time to read what I wrote!üá∫üá∏

@CGasparino to say what you just said on Neil‚Äôs show is reprehensible. If trump did something it will come out. To suggest this crap with no evidence to make yourself look important is disgusting.
@DineshDSouza Good chance we would have minimized the losses in the house of Paul Ryan hadn‚Äôt done something that the Democrats are holding over his head. Just like flake.

@JeffFlake we elected trump, you know the people? So stop being an ass, and get his judicial nominees through. Still interested in learning what the Democrats have on you, I would love to know that. One day maybe we will find out. Hope you run in 2020.
@PPistone you liked what David Hogg tweeted? You agree with him?
@HowardKurtz @BretBaier Big BIG MISTAKE
@jeff_gluck So let me get this straight. You‚Äôre blaming Trump for Kevin not talking to you? If true, you are the problem. So, if true, you think Kevin thought Trump is why I won‚Äôt answer Jeff?
@realDonaldTrump Is say let them do it, and when the Germans invade France this time, for the third time in a little over a century, let them ROT.
@JebBush Jeb, I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how disappointed in you, and your family i am. It is obvious that you have an agenda, and that agenda has nothing to do with the American people, nor their best interest. Sad.
@MelissaTweets Melissa, Acosta is not President, nor a candidate. Sort of a vital difference on Lewandoski‚Äôs actions.
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons What do the democrats have on you?
@FoxNewsResearch @BretBaier Polls are open, what the hell are you doing calling house for Democrats?????
@Kenny_Wallace I think that is wishful thinking. We are in a fight that is similar to the frog in the pot turned up 1/2 a degree an hour until it‚Äôs cooked and never knew what happened.
@WHSVnews #spellingnamescorrectly
@BillKristol @redsteeze What exactly do you have a problem with?
@JeffFlake Flake, I want to know what bothers you about the facts? Frankly, you disgust me. What do the democrats have on you? Seriously, what do they hold over your head, that you would be such an ass?
@JeffFlake So Flake, what‚Äôs your point?	Either you‚Äôre good with illegals or you aren‚Äôt? The current argument is about illegals, and the Mira‚Äôs of problems they bring with them, not legal law abiding immigration. How did you get elected?

@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The Democrat candidate for Governor in Florida is reportedly under criminal investigation by the FBI. His city has highest crime in State. He wants to raise your taxes. I‚Äôm not sure you know this because the press has been sickenly biased. Vote for Ron DeSantis.
@brithume Brit, the real difference is this. What Trump wants is what the majority wants. What the enemies want is not in America best interest. As long as Trump is working for us, I couldn‚Äôt care less about the rest of this BS.
