@selenevargas9 Usted siempre puede conseguir crema cuando en hielo!
@Paula_White You and I both know that all to well, Paula😇🙏
@BarackObama Merry Christ-Mass, Sir🎅🎄
@unashamedojesusFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
@can2009 The worst thing you can do to someone is something you can do to yourself thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
@VictoriaOsteen The new mercy 	 you speak of Victoria is the newness of fresh life flowing out from our bellies as rivers of living water. This mercy is new because how are we to ever find Him who merciful to us unless we the Christians seek him who is found in us.
@Paula_White In Jesus name, Amen, Amen and Amen! One for God the Father, One for God The Son and One for God the Holy Spirit!
@BarackObama Both lucky and forever blessed there is the difference and you are blessed. To be a father is what the son said to Him!
@BarackObama Yeshua Hamashea strong! Although messages come and go so quickly we as one people shall never neglect nor forget exactly what this day and others just like really mean 📖
@brhodes @JuliaTherese3 Then why is he shaking hands with George W. Bush because  he wouldn't be anywhere without George W. Bush.
@JuliaTherese3 @rebeccaballhaus @Marshall_Cohen @FBI The emperor playing his flute while rome burns to the ground because he elected his horse.
@JuliaTherese3 @mmpadellan @MGavner If they do this in the green imagine what they will do in the dry.
@JuliaTherese3 America can only start wars not win them.
@RepAdamSchiff And what shall a man give in exchange for his soul.
@RepShimkus Not will, shall. Shall is more important than will or the will of man and men. This means the government belongs to Jesus and not to any of you!
@realDonaldTrump You still lost Trent Franks, Donald👎And you will lose more...
@Joduan @davidvestal For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
@Joduan @davidvestal Because Jesus said, "Ye have been with me from the beginning." The answer is in, "In the beginning God created the heavens..."
@davidvestal It is His-Story.
@SenTomCotton Retaining cluster's does a nation and it's people no justice unless used.
@SenTomCotton 25 years let me see here, they really wanted this man to do it. They really wanted George Herbert Walker Bush the  41st President of the United States to nuke them didn't they!!! In Jesus name amen!
@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost Be this as it may the blood was, is and will always forever be for here on forward forever more...!!! Senator John McCain
@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost We will one day Senator John McCain only when American boots touch the ground and tread the earth again.
@SenJohnMcCain I did climb Bell mountain and yes I did see the three of them on the top waiting. Jesus in the center, Moses on the left and Elias on the right.
@ResistanceHulk @SenJohnMcCain In the words of Elvis Presley, "Don't be cruel!"
@AdamSchiffCA Depravity is a man made definition Mr. Adam Schiff which is and has become the sin of us all. You can quote me on that;-)
@NadyaZhexembay People alone change the ideas that change the world.
@can2009 But of power, love and a sound mind.
@JackKingston Mr. Jack Kingston has a very unusual sense of humor.
@inky_mark @AdamSchiffCA @lucylouise1112 Not all are defined by this yet all are defined by, "What did you really do for America and not for yourself." Did my Grandfather kill nazis because he needed to? No! My Grandfather killed nazis because they were going to kill him.
@AdamSchiffCA You are wrong, no he won't, there is still more to do.
@AdamSchiffCA This is a bold statement Mr. Adam Schiff. Yet I do have something better to add, let us go right after all the Swiss gold as Abraham Lincoln wanted and give it all back to America. It belong to the nazis because they stole it from us.
@Paula_White Wow, thank you, Paula! You are an 👼.
@elliesangelwing Thank you, I love it!
@JohnBoozman Back to the drawing board, then. When I have these ideas to help I always pray that it will never be to late. And I do not want to wait for a different president because by then it will be to late.
@Paula_White And I accept your prayers, Paula thank you in Jesus name thank you!🙏👼😇
@FirstAndLastMin And the road of the cross is light.
@richard_geer 	I will dance like David danced...
@EvangelisticVo1 Prayers are the essentials of speaking the words of God that one cannot find.
@redthornchurch The essence of prayer is God's own will to impact your life.
@SandiHKaye @Emmanuelle_F8h Faith is the substance of standing on things not seen.
@Jesusagpd Did you know Elijah and Elisha were twin brothers?
@Jesusagpd Life happening to you is life happening to everyone else.
@Jesusagpd Amen in Jesus name!
@Reborn_Redeemed God, the Holy Living One is us!
@stevenfurtick The activity of the mind is not just attitude, it is the reflection of the disposition and deposition of Christ Jesus.
@stevenfurtick God must win the battle within the Christian in order to win the war for Christianity.
@markchironna The man in between is driven by God with the odds of the enemy before him.🙏😇📖⛪
Changed people change people✌🙏📖⛪😇
@PrayInFaith In Jesus name, Amen🙏👍📖😇💪✌

@NTL2012 And he sticketh closer than brother.
@Prayers_R_Us For there is no work under He does see.
@ChristianPost To be prominent is to be preeminent to define Christianity with your spoken and unspoken testimony is the evangelical Christian work.
@apostlejonas For I am not as one that beateth the air.
@Franklin_Graham It would also be great if they all went with you to revial's to preach the gospel to the public.
