Democrats, you can be ideologically pristine or you can beat Trump ;you cannot do both. And as we saw from Wednesday’s magnificent hearing — possible only by a House majority achieved by running moderate candidates — you cannot govern if you do not win. https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
Having fled the GOP, I cannot for the life of me understand why Ds would risk rescuing Rs from themselves and giving them an easy target to distract voters from their own extreme positions (e.g., more tax cuts for the rich, a wall from sea to shining sea) https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
emocrats can surely run as progressives — ready to undo tax cuts for the rich, to re-enter the Paris climate agreement, to shore up and expand Obamacare, to legalize “dreamers," etc. https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
Sanders is guilty of doing much of this, which explains Trump’s enthusiasm for elevating the profile of “Crazy Bernie.” However, other candidates are not immune to the temptation of falling into the “socialist” trap. https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
It would be a particularly egregious error for Democrats to identify with proposals that are non-starters (Abolish ICE! Reparations!). It’s an unforced error with no upside.  https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
Democrats also give Trump the upper hand when they are willing accept the role he’s designated for them: Socialists. We’ve already heard his Green New Deal attack. Socialists want to take away your car and outlaw cows (or the reverse)! https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
One way that Democrats could hinder their cause would be to run someone who is ethically-suspect or non-transparent. https://t.co/X3tGShSUec
Democrats have to decide whether to make it more difficult for him (or another nominee) to demonize them, or easier. https://t.co/X3tGShSUec

The president may be a crook, as Michael Cohen alleged in testimony on Wednesday; he’s also a fool whose ignorance and narcissism embarrass the United States on a daily basis and makes us less safe and the world less free. https://t.co/yzTOj0vi6r
Trump is so needy for approval and so ignorant about the world that he’ll apparently believe anything a dictator tells him — so long as it comes with a truckload of compliments and maybe a red carpet or glowing orb. https://t.co/yzTOj0vi6r
Trump’s egregious comments in Vietnam certainly are reminiscent of Trump’s embarrassing gullibility in siding with Putin over US intelligence agencies and with MBS on insistence that he did not know about the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  https://t.co/yzTOj0vi6r

Smearing Cohen doesn’t get Trump or Republicans very far when there is a mound of evidence stacked behind him. https://t.co/7oSPW5RVOD

Trump’s self-image and organization are very much styled after a Hollywood movie portrayal of a gangster and his crime family. https://t.co/7oSPW5RVOD
In Cohen’s telling, Trump sits atop a kind of crime factory mowing down red lines daily, operating above and beyond the law to enrich its top boss and depending on the ultimate loyalty of underlings.  https://t.co/7oSPW5RVOD

When campaigns and coverage of them become idiotic, faith in democracy suffers and we wind up with candidates whose major flaws were ignored because the media was fixated on grape stealing. https://t.co/hcowpLy380
the elevation of inconsequential, non-scandals to the exclusion of important issues and serious biographical question is what threatens to make us all dumber https://t.co/hcowpLy380
The objective here is to instill some sense of proportion (horrors!) and common sense in coverage so as to make voters smarter, not dumber, about the ballot choices they have.  https://t.co/hcowpLy380
News consumers and the media alike might develop an eight-part test to determine whether coverage has gone off the rails https://t.co/hcowpLy380
This scenario is not nearly as far-fetched as it should be. The fixation on the inane takes us into a hall of mirrors where grape-stealing becomes the measure of a candidate rather than her understanding of the issues, life accomplishments and skill set. https://t.co/hcowpLy380

That means treating voters like adults and connecting campaign proposals to attainable legislative ends. That’s the way to earn voters’ trust. And it might be the difference between winning and four more years of Trump. https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
Here’s free advice for the Democratic field: Instead of signing on to pie-in-the-sky proposals, sign on to goals the vast majority of Americans want (health care for all!). Then show voters how to get from here to there, or at least get closer to “there.” https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
In the Trump era, Democrats may be tempted to be as dishonest and irresponsible as Trump. That’s bad for our democracy and bad for Democrats, https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
dishonest to pledge to achieve nirvana in 10 years. It’s only one step removed from “I alone can fix it” and from the nonsensical claim that the solutions are easy and all agreed upon, just the will is missing. https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
The problem, however, is that once you say you “support the GND,” you are stuck defending the text of the GND. (And by the way, there is considerable confusion about what is actually in the GND) https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
Another interpretation of “sign on to the GND" is that you simply endorse the GND’s general goals.  That’s like saying you want to cure cancer by the end of the century.  https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
Well, if you don’t dream big, you don’t get it! If that’s the meaning behind “signing on to the GND,” then progressives are in for a heap of well-deserved criticism and the Democrats risk losing the opportunity to oust Trump. https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
Its sponsors want to avoid answering hard questions and simultaneously maintain the pretense i's a serious plan. Instead, they wind up being criticized for a plan that costs say, $5 trillion and can be obtained only through a command-and-control economy https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2
If you are going to be specific about very, very ambitious proposals, you better be able to explain how you enact them. https://t.co/lBwZ2LamH2

When Democratic supporters and activists tell pols not to criticize their own because “Republicans don’t hold their side accountable!” Democrats should be proud to respond: Darn right. But we do. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
instead of complaining that it’s not fair for their side to be held to a higher standard, they should tout their adherence, however imperfectly, to some level of responsible, decent conduct. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
If both sides are the same, neither is responsible; if Republicans are never held accountable because they can get away with “whataboutism,” they will never reform. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
Democrats aren’t saints, to be sure. No party is without hypocrisy or devoid of charlatans. However, at this juncture, there is simply no comparison between the two sides. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
Do not defend the indefensible. Do not sacrifice long-term reputation for short-term political expediency. The party must stand for something more than the defense of its sleaziest members. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
Democrats should not complain about the glaring double standard. They should embrace it and revel in their own party’s willingness to hold its side to a standard of decency, candor and faithfulness to the law.  https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO
The moral failure and abject irresponsibility of the Republican Party, its donors, its activists and its countless enablers continue to shock and dismay the rest of America. Have these Republicans no standards, no decency? They do not. https://t.co/A51ra3L4bO

She’s a fresh face, but more important, a real talent who is both personally engaging and pitch perfect for an electorate tired of hearing a windbag president demonize immigrants for the umpteenth time. https://t.co/CBFOV3KcaV
More often than not, her complaint was that government was getting in the way of the progress of average Americans. That used to be how Republicans spoke. Democrats, if they are smart, will snatch the “values” issue back from the GOP. https://t.co/CBFOV3KcaV
While she gave a nod to progressive issues such as LGBTQ rights and abortion rights, what was striking about her speech was her emphasis on opportunity, community and shared responsibility. https://t.co/CBFOV3KcaV
Her delivery was snappy and her theme upbeat.  https://t.co/CBFOV3KcaV
Ironically, Trump’s speech was largely about what the government is doing for others, while hers stressed what Americans do for each other. https://t.co/CBFOV3KcaV

Whether Booker is the right messenger to deliver a more inspirational message is for Democratic primary voters to decide; the message, however, we find compelling. https://t.co/ZajCJKMZGW
It can help politics to appeal to the better angels of our nature. It can remind us that government service means service to others, especially those who cannot fend for themselves. It would suggest some higher purpose than partisanship. https://t.co/ZajCJKMZGW
race can be the jumping-off point for policies that focus attention and resources on the most needy among us, take human rights seriously as integral to our foreign policy and seek, however imperfectly, to fulfill the country’s founding creed https://t.co/ZajCJKMZGW
Grace can also infuse policy --whether about abolition or civil rights movement, or response to inhumane treatment of children at the border https://t.co/ZajCJKMZGW
Grace — or graciousness, if you prefer — can be meant as a guide to the practitioners of politics. This can mean assuming the best motives among your opponents, extending courtesies not required by laws or rules, and evidencing humility. https://t.co/ZajCJKMZGW

In short, Trump’s financial improprieties and xenophobic scare tactics are being checked, but his attacks on the foundations of our democracy have not been disabled — far from it. https://t.co/NIfyoCb4Wl
While Trumpian corruption and nativism have been met with legal and electoral opposition, his efforts to thwart democracy itself have sadly found more success and, worse, served as an inspiration to strongmen. https://t.co/NIfyoCb4Wl
Like right-wing nativist parties in Europe, the Republican Party has taken up anti-immigrant hysteria with a tenaciousness matched only by its dishonesty. https://t.co/NIfyoCb4Wl
When it comes to presidential self-dealing, conflicts of interest, foreign influence-peddling (i.e., emoluments), misuse of charitable funds, self-enrichment and nepotism, Trump is in a class by himself.  https://t.co/NIfyoCb4Wl
Akin to autocrats elsewhere, President Trump’s tenure has been defined by corruption, nativist scare-mongering and assaults on democratic institutions, all with disturbing results. https://t.co/NIfyoCb4Wl

If Republicans insist on becoming the new Dixiecrats, they are headed for political oblivion, and the country is in dire need of a center-right party that is not based on racial identity and cultural grievance. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/UikiEdz2se
When racial and cultural identity become synonymous with political identity, our politics ceases to be about problem-solving, and becomes about sharpening divisions and weaponizing racial incidents. https://t.co/UikiEdz2se
One cannot rationally discuss or reach compromise on voting laws and immigration if one’s identity is caught up in repression of minority voting and the exclusion of immigrants. https://t.co/UikiEdz2se
Rs didn’t think through sufficiently was the effect their propagation and tolerance of racism would have on other groups of voters — including women and college educated Americans who are revolted by the GOP’s incarnation as a modern-day Dixiecrat Party https://t.co/UikiEdz2se
They’ve created a closed, evil reinforcing cycle in which those on the ballot with an “R,” by and large, have every reason to cater to the white-grievance set and less and less incentive to serve the interests of nonwhite voters. https://t.co/UikiEdz2se
Republicans have disincentivized themselves when it comes to civil rights, voting protection and zero tolerance for bigotry. https://t.co/UikiEdz2se

@starsandstripes is this the NFL -- with throwback uniforms?
Consider if a candidate is young or youngish, knowledgeable, idealistic, empathetic, high-energy and appropriate for a change election. Trump is none of those and therefore may be at a disadvantage in a side-by-side comparison https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7
The gap between the popular and electoral vote may be here to stay; that means broadening the available pool of voters in the electoral-rich states will be key. https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7
that doesn’t mean Democrats shouldn’t pick a progressive; but they should be wary of tapping the most progressive candidate in the pack. https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7
First is the lesson of the 2018 midterms: Be wary of Sen. Bernie Sander-type ideological outliers. https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7
So how might Democrats desperate to win back the White House go about maximizing their party’s chances? Perhaps voters should work backwards. What should they be wary of? https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7
we should be wary about expecting voters to distinguish between candidates they like and ones that are “electable.” Very often, voters become convinced that the persons they like will be liked by others. Presto -- instant electability! https://t.co/3Uk8Wcs4D7

Abrams’s selection is recognition that the party is looking for dynamic, new faces (sorry, VP Joe Biden) and needs to supercharge turnout, especially among African American women. It may also be a sign that it seeks to enlarge the 2020 map	 https://t.co/9TVVdQhwsu
For that reason — the palpable and insatiable hunger to resist, rebuke and rage against Trump and Trumpism — you may see unprecedented interest in the Democratic primaries. It’s actually already begun.	 https://t.co/9TVVdQhwsu

In short, even in Democratic primary races, moderates can win with appealing message, a sharp critique of Trump and an effective communicator (e.g. Sen. Jackie Rosen of Nevada, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer).	 https://t.co/wqBVPavVk9
It is not a foregone conclusion that Democrats will pick the most progressive candidate in the field. Remember, again and again in the primaries Democratic voters in 2018 chose moderates over Sen. Bernie Sanders-endorsed candidates. 	 https://t.co/wqBVPavVk9
Bloomberg serves another purpose as well: He shows you don’t have to be a mushy, middle-of-the-roader to be a “moderate.” 	 https://t.co/wqBVPavVk9
Not only does Bloomberg’s wealth check out (Forbes has him at $47.2B, more than 4 times Trump’s most inflated claim.) Unlike Trump, Bloomberg isn’t a know-nothing, has actually run something well, doesn’t have a slew of obvious, serious personality flaws.	 https://t.co/wqBVPavVk9

D's need better ideas than easy, splashy fix of raising the top marginal tax rate. How much more revenue do we need, and what’s the most efficient, way to do that with the least amount of distortion to the economy that doesn’t increase income inequality?  https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
With 20 or so Democrats heading for the presidential primary, maybe it is time to have a reasoned discussion on how much more revenue we think is reasonably required (at least until the baby boomer retirement bubble deflates) and the best way to raise it. https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
It’ll pay for itself! It’ll permanently hike growth! No, and no. It dramatically increased the debt in exchange for at most a temporary bump in growth, already dissipating before our eyes. https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
Democrats and Republicans alike want a rather large, active government. We can try to increase the growth rate by smarter policies (e.g., more trade, more economic immigration) but let’s not get caught up in fantasies of 5 percent growth.  https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
Alas, government is not like a household (or a business) and, therefore, some reasonable level of debt is acceptable. https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
We have a choice: Pretend debt doesn’t matter or try to close the gap between revenue and expenditures. https://t.co/e0RQlscbMK
we suspect Hickenlooper won’t be the last governor to show interest in the race. Given what a mess Trump will leave behind, a competent, accomplished governor might be appealing — either at the top or the bottom of the ticket. https://t.co/1wYKG0mfKp
For starters, governors add a strong dose of pragmatism and common sense to a race dominated by senators (who get to make speeches, but don’t get to execute policy). https://t.co/1wYKG0mfKp
A two-term governor from a geographically distant state can’t even go to Iowa in January without someone raising the subject of the 2020 presidential race, right?  https://t.co/Ye2j3DoY1e

Not repealing Obamacare as promised? Nope, that had little if any effect. Equating neo-Nazis and anti-Nazi protesters or endorsing Roy Moore or siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence advisers? Nope, nope and nope. https://t.co/Tjt9vxniwX

Now, more than any time since the civil rights era, we face a fundamental choice: Make good on the promise of America’s founding creed or join the mob that wields the power of the state divorced from justice, empathy and decency.		 https://t.co/lenXZD6Jc9
They offer Trump respectability when they should scorn him; they defend his authoritarianism and political blackmail when they should stand with those who seek to defend democratic institutions and public civility.  https://t.co/lenXZD6Jc9
like the recipients of the Letter from a Birmingham Jail, R’s look away. They hide behind the “rule of law” — but apply it only to immigrants. They insist on respect — but only for themselves. https://t.co/lenXZD6Jc9
Trump’s vision is antithetical to America’s founding creed, his nativism and xenophobia are morally repugnant, and his treatment of immigrants, government workers, political opponents, judges and the free press violates the principles of our democracy https://t.co/lenXZCP7Nz
In a country exhausted and disgusted with Trump’s degradation of his office and normalization of cruelty, bigotry and xenophobia, Harris’s description of an America we can be proud of has great appeal.  https://t.co/BHsKrx8ryO
Harris’s greatest strength, which if she is as smart as she seems should be at the center of her campaign, might be her ability to talk about politics in terms of values — empathy, fairness, personal responsibility. https://t.co/BHsKrx8ryO
Harris has very deliberately made her personal story a key component of her message. We thankfully haven’t seen trips to the dentist (she is not afflicted with the over-sharing syndrome).  https://t.co/BHsKrx8ryO
More so than Obama, she stresses an inclusive message, aiming for America where everyone is “seen” and feels she has a place. Unlike Obama’s cool and reserved persona, Harris radiates warmth and stresses her connection to friends, family and community. https://t.co/BHsKrx8ryO

primary challenge to Trump was once unthinkable. However strongly Republicans cling to Trump in the face of Democratic attacks and harsh media coverage, Republicans are increasingly open to a primary challenge	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
Trump’s narcissism, incompetence and rotten judgment have led him to force out any adviser with a modicum of common sense, experience and influence. There is no one to head off or help get him out of jams he gets into	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
Third, in the midst of a scandal, most presidents can fall back on their role as commander in chief and architect of U.S. foreign policy. Trump’s foreign policy, aside from Russia taint, is chaotic, frightening and entirely ineffective	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
The election not only transferred the power to investigate and subpoena Trump; it empowered Pelosi, the most formidable political opponent — maybe any opponent — he has ever faced. 	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
Second, Trump’s play-to-the-base strategy was a blunder with enormous ramifications.	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
First, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III does his job methodically, secretly and effectively, wrapping up one witness after another. Despite the Trump onslaught, he retains the confidence of most Americans.	 https://t.co/PLwwJK8zjd
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III got two important votes of confidence this week. Both served to reinforce his reputation as a straight shooter and ethical prosecutor. https://t.co/Cp23cWDJvb
Third, if anyone still had doubts, Trump is the worst negotiator to occupy the Oval Office, in large part because he is utterly untrustworthy.  https://t.co/RNz79Ykd3C
Second, Trump is plainly worried. Seeing the rotten polling for him and the wall, the impressive unity of the Democrats and McConnell’s unwillingness to help bail him out, Trump was forced to reverse his earlier pledge not to include DACA https://t.co/RNz79Ykd3C
Trump’s non-offer is instructive in three respects. First, his hard-line anti-immigrant supporters (e.g. Ann Coulter) already don’t like talk of “amnesty” https://t.co/RNz79Ykd3C
Alas, the press — fresh from a BuzzFeed beating — now presents Trump’s “offer” as serious. It’s not. Here is what would be a serious way to proceed https://t.co/RNz79Ykd3C

As stunning a vote against their party’s leader as the British Parliament’s Brexit rebuke of British Prime Minister Theresa May, House Rs risk their implication in an unprecedented scandal concerning the president’s loyalties threat https://t.co/TlmZmrued1
The assertion that Senate Republicans would never break assumed the evidence would never be so conclusive and the crime would never be so serious. All of that goes out the window if multiple pieces of evidence demonstrate Trump suborned perjury https://t.co/tIDQjnYWd7
Interestingly, this exact fact pattern came up more than once in the attorney general confirmation hearing for William P. Barr, once with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and once with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) https://t.co/tIDQjnYWd7
No one has a real understanding of “collusion,” because it is a non-legal, vague term. A conspiracy can be complicated, hard to prove. “Suborning perjury,” a phrase known to anyone who’s watched “Law &amp; Order,” is specific and simple. https://t.co/tIDQjnYWd7
With Trump so intent on reinforcing his own ego and bolstering the narrow group of dead-enders, his behavior alienates more and more voters who aren’t in his core group of supporters. Pelosi, meanwhile, voices sympathy for those Trump is hurting https://t.co/3kaZig2Z9d

a contentious Democrat might conclude Barr is the worst possible pick -- except for all the other conceivable picks. In any event, the voters must, if Trump is still around, remove him in 2020 via the ballot box. https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
Barr said actions Trump possibly took (using a pardon to influence witnesses)= a crime. If that is Barr’s view it is hard to see how he wouldn’t support Mueller identical conclusion https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
Barr is far from ideal, but he’s also about the most respected, knowledgeable and independent AG this president is going to convince to serve. https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
It is not clear why Barr, if he intends to operate in good faith and resolve the investigation once and for all, he would not be forthcoming on the subject of releasing the report https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
ideally we would like someone less partisan at DOJ. https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
We’d feel much more comfortable if he were to say candidly, “I was offering suggestions for Republicans. As AG I have a higher obligation to consider the administration of justice.” https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
even if we accept his implausible assertion that he was not using the memo to present himself as an AG candidate (or a judge) one still gets the impression this is not the work of a serious legal mind, but of a partisan  https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
The two main issues arising from his testimony are the memo he drafted regarding special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s legal theory, of which Barr admittedly was ignorant, and his refusal to agree in advance to release the final Mueller report. https://t.co/uey0JQqVTi
When 2020 rolls around one hopes GOP primary challengers and Democratic nominees wrap this vote around the necks of Trump/Putin enablers. Beyond that, our consolation must be the harsh judgment of history on this bunch of pusillanimous politicians. https://t.co/0o3RShWD9E
It is bad enough that Republicans give Trump cover on the shutdown, the full array of scandals and screw-ups and his attacks on the rule of law, but must they put party -- and Putin -- over country? The answer for most of them, sadly, is yes. https://t.co/0o3RShWD9E
riding to Trump’s defense are the majority of Senate Rs -- including self-described hawks like Sens Cruz, Ernst, Romney, Cornyn, Sullivan and Graham -- the last of which no doubt would prompt the late Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) to roll over in his grave. https://t.co/0o3RShWD9E
11 R senators broke with the president and his pro-Putin stance, but the more disturbing question is why the rest voted to protect Trump, and by extension Putin, rather than defend the sanctions regime they had originally supported https://t.co/0o3RShWD9E

Pompeo will be judged harshly by history, but that’s no consolation for the damage he is helping Trump do to. it will take years to rebuild State's morale, institutional expertise and credibility that Pompeo and his predecessor have frittered away. https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc
Of course, only six people on the terrorism watch list were apprehended in the first half of 2018, but facts aren’t going to get in the way of Pompeo throwing his own credibility into the dumpster fire to provide cover for Trump’s inane immigration policy. https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc
There have been no consequences for the Saudis in general or the crown prince specifically. There Pompeo was in Riyadh on Sunday, all smiles with the regime that murdered Khashoggi. The Saudis kill a journalist; Pompeo gives them a lovely photo op. https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc
The worst part of his interview, however, was Pompeo’s double talk on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi  https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc
But since we have already commenced withdrawal with none of that in place, Pompeo hastened to add it doesn’t matter that we have/had troops there.  https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc
Pompeo’s recent speech in Cairo was widely panned. It takes quite a poker face to read lines like this: “The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.” Ah, if it were only so. https://t.co/WZ6F1kPPhc

Third, it is imperative in his confirmation hearings that attorney general nominee William P. Barr pledge to allow Mueller to complete his work and to make his report public.  https://t.co/lQAXPcqLLG
Second, we should put aside the assumption that no matter what is in the report Republicans will not turn on Trump and seek his removal.  https://t.co/lQAXPcqLLG

You know what? She's really likable. https://t.co/hQN9Q2PliT via @mediaite
Trump sold his Fox New-hypnotized base a wall based on premise our borders are out of control. That's not true. Our biggest problem is refugees. A wall doesn't address that. They still present themselves. So Trump must lie and create a terror or crime threat that doesn't exist.
We are a democracy with a Constitution. We cannot give way to a hostage taker or be cowed by bullying and lies. We ask that the president respect his office, the Constitution and the intelligence of the American people. Open the government, Mr. President. https://t.co/MBplBabejE
He points to the influx of refugees as evidence of a crisis. But asylum seekers would still present themselves at the border and have their claims adjudicated. The pres should consider, as Sen. Cruz suggested, sending more judges to process claims. https://t.co/MBplBabejE
His administration says thousands of terrorists have been apprehended coming over the southern border. But the real number of immigrants encountered who were on the Terrorist Screening Database was six.  https://t.co/MBplBabejE

It’s a tall order, but he may be the best natural politician in the field — and the best Democrats have seen since Obama took the country by storm. https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
the underlying question remains: What’s he got that no one else does, and why does the country need him rather than one of the two dozen or so other candidates? https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
One surefire way for O’Rourke to quiet skeptics would be, just as Obama did in 2008 against Clinton, to topple the big kahuna, Biden, should he decide to run.  https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
Obama overcame the toughness hurdle in part by sharing his compelling biography, the quintessential American success story of the child of a single mother https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
the gangly, fast-talking former congressman will have to show he’s no pushover and not afraid to counterpunch. What’s he going to say when former vice president Joe Biden says, "Now son . . . " on the debate stage? https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
The real challenge for O’Rourke, I’d suggest, is twofold: 1) the toughness question; and 2) the Roger Mudd problem. https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
O’Rourke is going to be in favor of roughly the same things (expanded health care, reenter the Paris climate accord) most 2020 aspirants in the field will favor; he’ll be against the same things (big money, PACs, the wall) that the others are against https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
O’Rourke’s biggest challenge is not the whisper campaign by acolytes of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that he is a closet moderate (what’s wrong with that?!). https://t.co/w2yLR4aFUm
Candidates determined to talk about themselves in depth and to share their substantive views can raise the bar — if only a little https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
The GOP decided in 2016 that character, curiosity, decency, preparedness, etc., didn’t matter — and look where it got us.  https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
candidates should, and in the Trump era must, talk about themselves and provide evidence of their character, tenacity and temperament. They should talk about their influences and their biography. https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
What they cannot do is give a single speech on a topic, put out a blizzard of policy papers and expect the media to cover that over a sustained period of time rather than the daily stump speech that contains little or no substance. https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
if a candidate doesn’t want to play the oppo-gotcha game on slips, flubs and gaffes (as well as more major issues), he or she shouldn’t engage staff to dump oppo against her competitors on background.  https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
Second, don’t dignify President Trump’s attacks with answers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) doesn’t need to keep defending her decision to get a DNA test (“I shouldn’t have” is the best answer), nor respond to his Pocahontas smear. https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
First, candidates don’t have to answer questions that demand they act as political scientists (who’s your natural constituency?) or pundits (what’s your path to victory?).  https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW
the responsibility for more enlightening and civil campaigns rests in large part with the candidates https://t.co/xxOLA0vyrW

Telling falsehoods, blurring the difference between truth and lies, creating constant confusion and discrediting objective sources of facts are common ways authoritarians hide their ill-conceived, morally indefensible actions.	 https://t.co/snMa8hN1Lc

He tells lies to gin up his base and smear immig as criminals, terrorists and welfare scroungers. This, he thinks, helps him push useless, wasteful and counterproductive schemes like the wall or perpetuate cruel, inhumane policies like child separation. 	 https://t.co/snMa8hN1Lc
This wholly concocted crisis and illegitimate power play might become the basis for a stand-alone article of impeachment, or more likely, motivation for Republicans to dump the increasingly erratic, impulsive and authoritarian president.	 https://t.co/sx6nbQv71H

Let’s face it: The conservatism and the GOP we once knew are gone. In the spirit of actual conservatism, it’s time to rescue what is worth rescuing — and then experiment, innovate and cultivate what is needed for 21st century America. https://t.co/OuVZNXRwel

Far and away the most interesting ideas factory on the right these days is the Niskanen Center, a sort of haven for lapsed libertarians who’ve discovered that simply shrinking government or disabling it is not a moral good.  https://t.co/OuVZNXRwel

His policy is not “America First" — as in “America leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit.” Rather it is, “Russia First as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration.”  https://t.co/4tEiAtixrV
stunning that hawks such as Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who’d melt down if  Obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend https://t.co/4tEiAtixrV
More to the point, why is Trump handing off chunks of the world — Syria, Afghanistan, the Sea of Azov — to America’s greatest international foe? Where does it stop-- the Baltics? Berlin? https://t.co/4tEiAtixrV
Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran. https://t.co/4tEiAtixrV

Somehow, I don’t think Cheney and a slew of Republicans who understand the necessity of U.S. leadership are willing to throw in the towel on U.S. exceptionalism. If I’m right, the only intellectually and honest option is to throw in the towel on Trump. https://t.co/gEpOWGcMuo
Now, perhaps Cheney’s aversion to Obama’s retrenchment was misguided, or perhaps the world is now so safe that American leadership and forward placement of troops is unnecessary. In that case, Cheney and others could in good conscience support him https://t.co/gEpOWGcMuo
It’s hard to see how Republicans like Cheney could stand for a president who now counts Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) among his closest advisers. https://t.co/gEpOWGcMuo
Agree with her or not (on this or other issues), Cheney’s case was straightforward: When the United States retreats from the Middle East without completely defeating the Islamic State, Russia and Iran benefit while Israel is put at risk. https://t.co/gEpOWGcMuo
The solution here, given Trump’s rotten bargaining position, is for Democrats to find the approach most advantageous to them and most embarrassing to Trump. If I were a betting person, I’d lay odds we’ll wind up with steel slats. https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
It would be ransom, but relatively cheap ransom — a phony wall — in exchange for somewhere between about 700,000 and 3.6 million dreamers. https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
The final alternative makes the most sense, but would enrage anti-immigrant zealots: Give Trump his $5 billion (less than the $25 billion once on the table, reminding us Trump is the worst negotiator ever) in exchange for legalizing the “dreamers.” https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
A third alternative would be to nudge up the dollar amount for border security (from $1.6 Trump can claim he got money for “steel slats” while Democrats can  remind voters Trump didn’t get a wall https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
Another possible outcome would be to pass all the appropriations bills and reserve a separate vote on wall funding, which, of course, will fail. Then Trump can holler about Congress’s lack of nerve. This is a less obvious but no less complete collapse  https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
McC can put the clean resolution on the floor, where it will pass, and see whether Trump has the nerve to veto it, and if so, whether there are 67 votes to override. That would be most humiliating option for Trump. Hence, it’s the least likely  https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
The public doesn’t support either the ends (the wall), or the means (the shutdown). Next week, D’s in House will swiftly pass the CR, and send it to the Senate, daring Republicans there to vote against the exact same resolution they previously supported. https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
For those with a passing relationship to reality, the entire exercise is politically inane. https://t.co/xcMXtx4YFI
Chances are, however, that the country will need the Democrats or an independent movement to supply a candidate to send Trump packing. We pray they choose wisely.	 https://t.co/GmPyekAoCj
It’s not the most critical factor, but if Democrats run a septuagenarian, they give up a significant advantage in a general election against Trump	 https://t.co/GmPyekAoCj
Democrats still should be concerned that their nominee be credible on the international stage	 https://t.co/GmPyekAoCj
Rather than tell voters that solutions are easy and only he/she can fix it, a candidate who explains that things are complicated but that, collectively, we have the ingenuity and resources to overcome challenges will make an attractive alternative	 https://t.co/GmPyekAoCj
A candidate who aims to make Americans proud of their government and return character as a criteria for the presidency will go far. They want someone who speaks to their better angels — something Beto and Biden do.	 https://t.co/GmPyekAoCj

The world is not as it was in 1950 or 1980, and a governing philosophy that ignores social, econ and pol challenges of the past 30yrs— or worse, seeks to turn back the clock — has no justification and contributes to the rise of right-wing populism. https://t.co/defo7OkvB8

Trump won’t be able to put the toothpaste back in the tube by firing Mueller or blocking the report; Mueller is presenting his case to the public through these legal filings. https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc
First, facts matter; evidence matters. Second, the prosecutors (both in the the Southern District of New York and in Mueller’s office) appear to be acting without substantial interference. https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc
Manafort also seems to be a window into possible obstruction by virtue of his contacts with administration officials. https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc

To begin with, we learn that Manafort was communicating with “a senior Administration official up through February 2018.” That person better lawyer up https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc
Cohen also was helpful to Mueller by giving him: (1) information about Cohen’s contacts with the Russians during the campaign; (2) information about “Russian nationals' attempts to reach the campaign" as early as 2015 https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc
hat did Cohen give Mueller? He went to “significant lengths” to assist Mueller’s team, meeting with them seven times https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc
prosecutors are convinced Cohen acted “in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.” That would be Trump, who prosecutors have concluded was involved in a serious felony. https://t.co/pKBxwUq5Lc

This is both a way of making sure that evidence is squirreled away in the event Mueller is fired, and putting Congress on notice of avenues to pursue (i.e. impeachment) in the event that Mueller’s final report is bottled up.
The picture one has is of a desperate man who knows he’s being cornered by an adversary far better armed and utterly resistant to his threats. https://t.co/TJwaivKV1f
Mueller is ensuring that both Congress and the public get a good sense of the seriousness of the investigation and the evidence out there that might implicate the president.vs Trump https://t.co/TJwaivtk9H
The irony is that while Trump’s tweets might incriminate him, they are entirely ineffective in disrupting the investigation.The enormous amount of evidence that Mueller must be accumulating remains out of Trump’s reach.  https://t.co/TJwaivtk9H
The latest revelation also underscores how foolish and counterproductive are Trump’s public attempts to sway potential witnesses such as Michael Cohen and Roger Stone.  https://t.co/TJwaivtk9H
The Flynn filing is one more reminder of how little we and Trump know about the investigation, which is as buttoned up and leak-free as one could imagine. https://t.co/TJwaivtk9H

You don’t lie for no reason, and Cohen has supplied the reason why so many people found it necessary to conceal the Trump campaign’s and the Trump organization’s ties to Russia. https://t.co/4ccmCvYYPq
In sum, Cohen’s revelations about ongoing Trump Organization dealings with Russia puts at risk members of the president’s family, the cast of witnesses who have testified and the many individuals who had contacts with Russia and lied https://t.co/4ccmCvYYPq
The efforts to deny and cover up contacts with Russia now have some context: Trump didn’t want it known that his involvement with the Kremlin was much deeper than he had let on https://t.co/4ccmCvYYPq

Cohen is helping Mueller to tie Trump — financially, personally, politically — to the Russian government. Whether that amounts to crimes (apart from efforts to obstruct justice) remains to be seen. It does mean that Trump lied his way into the presidency https://t.co/O4hHC2my5x

Trump’s 2016 argument was  economy was lousy (it wasn’t); he had the magic touch (he doesn’t) and could revive manufacturing (he can’t); and supply-side tax cuts, especially corporate tax cuts, would be a windfall for workers (they haven’t). https://t.co/c2n6OKgLXO

Congress must determine whether foreign corruption, if not outright bribery, is affecting our foreign policy decision-making or whether our excessively deferential policy toward the Saudis stems from Trump’s refusal to reshape a flawed foreign policy. https://t.co/Cf9SIHpL30
When it comes to Russia and Saudi Arabia, Congress must play the role of foreign policy grown-up and keep American foreign policy grounded in reality.  https://t.co/Cf9SIHpL30
Trump and a good many conservative foreign policy advisers and outside experts were frankly snookered by the Saudis, who fed their hunger for an anti-Iran ally that spared us the trouble of deeper engagement in the region. https://t.co/Cf9SIHpL30

however, norms are conventions and customs, not laws. Hence, courts have limited ability other than public shaming to enforce these. Norms must be upheld by elected officials, and voters must insist they do so. https://t.co/uikdvpdFAk
Republicans, including Trump, these days are routinely trampling on democratic norms, which are habits of speech and conduct we expect of officials in support of the rule of law and democratic government https://t.co/uikdvpdFAk
In a way, this is a brilliant bit of judicial jujitsu. Scott cannot appeal because the preliminary injunction decision went his way. However, his conduct has been roundly condemned by the federal judge https://t.co/uikdvpdFAk
The court’s language assessing Scott’s conduct was scathing: “When a public official acting in his official capacity crosses that line, he ventures into a thicket of actual or potential bias. Then, constitutional alarm bells ring.”  https://t.co/uikdvpdFAk
On its face, the ruling denying the motion might seem like a win for Scott. However, if one actually reads the opinion, it’s a stunning rebuke of Scott — and, by implication, President Trump. https://t.co/uikdvpdFAk
In short, those fearful of a second Trump term should welcome any and all chances to knock him out before the general election. https://t.co/R4den8iMnH

First, there is little downside to the effort. The worst that can happen is what is entirely expected — Trump would win.  https://t.co/R4den8iMnH

In short, Trump’s bombastic tone, racism and failure to focus on the middle class (in fact, policies such as Obamacare repeal would have hurt these Americans) have repelled women, who in turn led the suburbs into Democratic territory. https://t.co/S5HLyjHEHv
“Democrats won 87% of the Congressional districts with the most college-educated women (40%+ of female residents).”  https://t.co/S5HLyjHEHv
The race also suggests that the GOP paid the price in a major way for GOP’s shameful treatment Dr. Ford and sexual assault victims; their attempt to make white males into the country’s greatest victims; and their loud, bullying and rude tone https://t.co/S5HLyjHEHv
Moderate policy, pragmatic politics and diverse, center-left candidates turned out to be a winning formula. https://t.co/S5HLyjHEHv
The strong showing of Democratic moderates, especially in the suburbs, suggests that Democrats need not go far left as Trump goes far right; to the contrary, the large center is wide open if Democrats run appropriate candidates. https://t.co/S5HLyjHEHv

Trump never seemed so small or as inadequate for the job as he did this weekend. Without empathy or curiosity or historical knowledge or grace, Trump flops on such occasions https://t.co/j43yJXWF7T
The solemnity and introspection of the world leaders stood in contrast to Trump’s nonattendance at a joint visit on Saturday to a cemetery . More important, the tone of the proceedings contrasted with Trump’s juvenile attitude toward the military https://t.co/j43yJXWF7T
The commemorations also underscored the magnificent achievement of the post-World War II international liberal order — which prevented any wars of this magnitude, ushered in decades of prosperity and drew bitter enemies in to close alliances https://t.co/j43yJXF3Jj
The ceremonies and the magnificent public art displays help us grasp the mind-boggling loss of men, the physical damage to Europe and the profound impact World War I had on the 20th cent https://t.co/j43yJXWF7T

it was a restatement that no American is more real than another. Yes, the majority of Americans are decent, tolerant, fair-minded people, and no one should sink into self-pity and grievance based on their inability to dominate Am society https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
The price of living — the requirement of living — in a diverse democracy is tolerance, self-discipline, civility and a minimal amount of civic comprehension. https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
You’re not a victim if someone tells you “Happy Holidays” or you hear a “Press 2 for Spanish” option on the phone. You’re not a victim if more and more Americans don’t “look like you”; looking like you has never been a qualification for citizenship https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
There are true victims in America — opioid addicts, gun victims, sexual assault survivors, cancer patients, victims of police misconduct, etc. The 70-year-old white male in the top 10-% of income earners isn’t a victim, no matter what Hannity tells him https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
The 2018 midterm elections are a reminder that presidents and parties have to talk to the whole country. The midterms are also a lesson that victimology only goes so far.		 https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
For over two years, Trump and his Fox News helpmates have perpetrated the fraud that only they are the voice of “the people.” That’s what authoritarian regimes and their followers always say. https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
These real Americans, who don’t watch hours of Fox News, figured out long ago that Trump is a pathological liar. They recoil at his overt racism, know dictators always go after the free press, actually know immigrants are real Americans too https://t.co/oge9suH5z5
The immigrant who runs the corner grocery store, the non-churchgoers, the service workers in big cities, the environmental scientists, govt employees,the office workers, parents of kids now scarily sophisticated about mass shootings are all Americans https://t.co/oge9suH5z5

It drives Trump’s critics to distraction to watch him dominate every news cycle and repeat lies. They should be upset; the president’s lies, racism, debase the presidency. However, Trump’s not helping himself or his party.  https://t.co/Smsf8omQsI
disapprove of Trump (54/45);think we're on wrong track (54/42), thought Trump’s immig policies were too harsh (46/ 33 say about right); favor tougher gun laws (59/37); want to uphold Roe (66/25) https://t.co/Smsf8omQsI
Simply because Trump did not see all these losses on Election Night does not make them any less real or consequential for Republicans. Put differently, outside the deepest-red enclaves Republicans took a beating up and down the ballot. https://t.co/Smsf8omQsI
Impeaching without removing Trump undoubtedly would fire up his cult and provide weird vindication. Better to investigate, embarrass and — after he leaves office — prosecute him for any crimes (e.g. obstruction of justice) taken in office. https://t.co/krzhz7o08M

For too long, Republicans have been extending the dominance of white voters through a variety of voting schemes. In 2018, voting-rights advocates began fighting back. If they are successful, Republicans might actually have to court nonwhite voters. https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe
There were setbacks for advocates of voting reform in Arkansas and North Carolina, which passed voter ID measures, but overall this was the biggest comeback for voting rights since the Supreme Court struck down pre-clearance provisions in 2013. https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe
in multiple states voting right advocates scored big wins https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe
he era of Republicans pretending to be small-government advocates is over (especially considering their infatuation with debt). If the argument is who is going to do a better job of providing health care, Democrats have a substantial advantage. https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe
The ACA, it seems, is here to stay because even Republicans want its benefits. The task is to improve and strengthen it with an eye toward affordability. https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe
n three red states voters approved Medicaid expansion, a central element of the ACA. It’s remarkable that with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans wound up popularizing ACA AND Medicaid. https://t.co/Pd6OhFYiAe

@Eugene_Scott Sanders stunningly tone deaf
She has no right to use her office to lie to the American people, let alone to violate the First Amendment. She has disgraced herself and should be denied the normal presumption of good faith accorded to past White House press secretaries.  https://t.co/15giMYGngP
I condemn harassment and threatening conduct of any sort (shame on the protesters who showed up at Tucker Carlson’s home and made threats); however, after leaving office, she deserves none of the niceties normally accorded to others in her position.  https://t.co/15giMYGngP
Sanders whines that the press is too critical or too mean or something. She can think whatever she pleases, but she is an employee of the American people and has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution https://t.co/15giMYGngP
While I believe the press must cover news conferences when Trump is present, t no reason to attend Sanders’s briefings, which do not import information but instead use the press as a forum to abuse https://t.co/15giMYGngP
The utility of filing a lawsuit (other than in annoying and embarrassing Trump and Sanders) would be a declaratory judgment ordering the White House to return Acosta’s credentials and barring the White House from taking such action in the future. https://t.co/15giMYGngP

, the Trump era may have revived our participatory democracy — and given it a new, decidedly female profile. https://t.co/VdEkPVpb8j
for all Trump’s assaults on the rule of law, the attacks on democratic norms, the attempt to intimidate the media and the undermining of objective reality, Trump’s anti-democratic actions were met with an outpouring of democratic activism https://t.co/VdEkPVpb8j
Absorbing the constant sting of Trump’s verbal arrows, women did not “get over” Trump’s election or learn to live with his serial affronts. They did not take kindly to his mocking of the #MeToo movement or of Christine Blasey Ford. https://t.co/VdEkPVpb8j
It’s not simply that women won, but women brand new to politics and/or running to be the “first” won  https://t.co/nrvxJW5ljE
There is good reason, then, for Democrats to demand immediate hearings and to demand that any ruling on the matter by DOJ ethics counsel be released forthwith. https://t.co/mX1ysgvlBb
this is one step worse than Trump picking a Supreme Court justice (Brett M. Kavanaugh) to rule on cases affecting him. Here, he’s in essence picking the overseer of an investigation into him and his cronies https://t.co/mX1ysgvlBb
