@Storm_Rising @JW4Hillary @hrcsupervol01 Disagree that all Michigan voters who voted for Trump on trade are trash.  Talk like that will lose them forever. Poor, working class folks who voted on trade (not on Trump’s racism) should be allies. We need to do GOTV for all working people who support inclusive Ds.
@Dextrluver @princessmom122 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Trade is utterly visceral for those who have lost their jobs when factories moved.  I know many of those blue collar voters in Michigan.  They don’t like Trump’s racism, and regret casting a vote for Trump.  Ds should not lump everyone together.
@TheObamanista @JMcNChicago @Jodzio @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Good Lord, I’m not saying we should center the party around racists.  Ever.  I’m saying that some who voted for Trump voted on trade.  We cannot lose them.
@princessmom122 @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama A lot of them voted for Trump because of trade.  In Michigan, that issue is very raw and real.  But they could come back.

@chief1970p @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @GOP Really?  Just throw away people who were once Obama voters and who regret their 2016 vote? We don’t have the luxury or the margins to walk away from swaths of voters.
@CipherKnot @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Agree that it’s about who doesn’t support Trump anymore.  Those voters are winnable.
@chief1970p @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama “These people” puts them all in the same box.  That is a mistake.
@FierceRobert @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama “Some” is correct.  Some voted for him because of trade.  They can be lured back.
.@BernieSanders is right on this:  many @realDonaldTrump voters also voted for @BarackObama.  Ds must not insult them.  Some will never vote for a D again.  But some will, if we show up in rural areas to address their needs, like jobs and health care. https://t.co/CxI4AEkOGe

Voting for Kavanaugh tomorrow morning means that the GOP men are saying Dr. Blasey Ford is lying.  Remember this, voters.  They could call to investigate further, to give it one week, but voting without investigating instead tells women that, yet again, the man wins.
