I‚Äôm the one promoting them - as in STLDs and other patient-centered option I‚Äôve promoted &amp; helped pass over the years-but that Dems in Ariz have opposed. -Unless it involved expanding a govt program-and they‚Äôre under water.
@JulieGunnigle @annak3333 @ElectKristinDP @SamuelsforAZ We do that by providing competitive options-other than govt. It‚Äôs popular for Dems to discount STLDs, but many patients could be helped AND protected by them with the guaranteed renewals. Why deny choices??
@KelliButlerAZ @JulieGunnigle @annak3333 @ElectKristinDP @SamuelsforAZ Au contraire, mes amies. As a fed program it would cost Ariz bigtime to administer a bifurcated program to hi income folks-if allowed at all-plus you're assuming AHCCCS rates, which are subsidized, would apply + if competing w/private insurers, it's a quick slide to single payer.
@annak3333 @JulieGunnigle @ElectKristinDP @SamuelsforAZ @KelliButlerAZ Well funded risk pools, more association plans &amp; STLDs are all parts of the solution. STLDs protect people at risk from high premiums when accompanied by guaranteed renewal plans. Sorry-expanding govt HC isn‚Äôt sustainable or less expensive. Only a free market is.
@JulieGunnigle @annak3333 @ElectKristinDP @SamuelsforAZ @KelliButlerAZ Adding TO the 22 Trillion in debt by increasing Medicaid (by another $2T w/Medicaid for All) risks the safety nets' future sustainability.  Also ignoring that most newly insured thru ACA WERE through GOV programs-84%. More employers dropped than added coverage. Some plan.

@sparkyontheseas The obsession with guns rather than gunfree zones plus denial of the real issue-Islamic terrorism-is astonishing.

@sparkyontheseas Do you work for free?
@sparkyontheseas Yes, respectfully. Where would all the patients from single payer countries go for health care as they're waiting for care?
@sparkyontheseas Hard to make the argument that HC isn't a priority with the multitude of programs. The gov't-subsidized models are flawed.
@sparkyontheseas Dying by disease vs terrorism isn't fair comparison-all of us will die but national security is gov't's primary duty.
@sparkyontheseas Likewise. We need to get this economy moving and taxes &amp; regs are a huge part of that discussion.
@sparkyontheseas It's important we figure this out. Why should gov't go broke plus crowd out $ for other essential services? #repeal&amp;replace
@sparkyontheseas And it's broke and getting broker &amp; why ACOs were created-to ration-oops-I mean incentivize care via bundled payments.
@sparkyontheseas You're making my point. They're subsidized-and can charge what they want.
