Happy birthday to the Virginia governor who‚Ä¶ 	‚úÖ expanded Medicaid to 400,000 Virginians	‚úÖ made Virginia‚Äôs criminal justice system fairer	‚úÖ is fighting for fair district maps for the next decade		Happy birthday, @RalphNortham! https://t.co/4ZqNa0wYxn
Who said it ‚Äî @realDonaldTrump or @MayorFung? 		Test your knowledge on the dangerous agenda Fung wants to bring to Rhode Island: https://t.co/ETc349QuzU #RIGov https://t.co/udRAmlVpxs
27 Republican leaders are standing with @SenatorKelly because they know she‚Äôll lead Kansas‚Äô recovery from the Brownback era. 	She‚Äôs proved she can work with both sides of the aisle to fix Kansas‚Äô schools, health care, jobs, and economy. #KSGov https://t.co/6ztF0hW35z
Even when Trump‚Äôs harmful agenda threatens Illinois, @BruceRauner chooses to praise the president‚Äôs policies and Supreme Court pick.	Rauner won‚Äôt stand up to Trump when Illinoisans‚Äô health care and rights are on the line. https://t.co/nHGVUWZqrz
On his own terms, @BruceRauner has been a ‚Äúmiserable failure‚Äù on jobs. Illinoisans are still looking for the ‚Äútens of thousands‚Äù of jobs he promised after an overseas trip. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/76kWZPLueQ
Illinois families were left to pay the price of @BruceRauner‚Äôs budget impasse. Today, social service agencies and providers are still recovering from the consequences of Rauner‚Äôs fiscal mess. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/vZzmbVIWOr https://t.co/l2ovzQllgK
.@BruceRauner‚Äôs refusal to sign a budget for three years contributed to one of the worst fiscal crises any state has experienced. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/ueZRLukZPw
Let‚Äôs review @BruceRauner‚Äôs biggest failures:	Under Rauner's watch, 14 veterans died from a Legionnaires‚Äô outbreak at a state-run facility. His office waited 6 days to inform the public of the outbreak. Now 12 families are suing the state for negligence. https://t.co/SXg3OxEJCm
It‚Äôs no wonder that nearly 6 months after the primary, Ives still refuses to endorse @BruceRauner and even said she was ‚Äúnot surprised‚Äù by his low polling. She knows Illinoisans are tired of Rauner‚Äôs failed policies that have taken the state backward. https://t.co/Oo5eONskIH
But his base problems didn‚Äôt end after the primary election. @BruceRauner heads into the general election with a third party challenge from a Republican legislator who could be a ‚Äúdeath knell‚Äù for the vulnerable incumbent. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/Brvf7IvWCR
Named the worst GOP governor in the country, @BruceRauner has alienated voters across the political spectrum. His failed leadership attracted a primary challenge from @JeanneIves, who won 48% of his party‚Äôs base. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/KCMdfmrjuZ
After nearly four years as Illinois‚Äô failed governor, @BruceRauner is the nation‚Äôs most vulnerable incumbent.		Rauner wants to erase his disastrous first term, but voters won‚Äôt forget how his failures on the budget, jobs, and veterans hurt Illinois. #ILGov #twill https://t.co/MeRllCJACc
