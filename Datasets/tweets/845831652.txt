5. Some work better for some than others.  Diagnosing and medicating are almost as much art as science.  Providers can come to different reasonable conclusions based on a number of variables.  Most diagnosis in psych aren't definitive.
4.  Don't misunderstand me.  People do get side effects everyday and that needs to be communicated and monitored appropriately up to and including stopping or changing medication.  That doesn't make meds bad.  They are tools.
3.  As a nurse I have to walk a fine line when I provide side effect information as patients can start to focus on and think they've got all the side effects, especially the serious ones.  It's a lot like a lawyer leading a witness.  Suggesting things.
2.  I repeat.  ALL MEDS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS.  That is for some limited percentage of the trial patients.  If it is a serious or life threatening side effect the percent affected must very low for FDA approval and generally includes a black box warning

1.  I have no idea what happened with Henderson Behavioral Health and Mr. Cruz but I am an experienced adolescent/child psych nurse.  Meds were just one part of his multidisciplinary treatment plan.  All meds have side effects.
@LiveLoveAndCare @DrPeggyDrexler @CNNOpinion I've worked with child/adol boys as a psych nurse for almost 30 years.  You know that meds are just one part of a multidisciplinary treatment plan.  It's hard, often unforgiving work.  Shame on you.  Educate!  Don't Blame.

5.  The truth is that while I've probably had IBS since I was a child, I was  only diagnosed in May 2016(52 now).  I'm still learning about my  condition every day.  All feedback would be greatly appreciated and good  for the IBS community
4.  Stress is another major trigger.  Finding supportive people, hobbies,  meditation, hypnotherapy, exercise, counseling, maybe even a less  stressful job(that's me) can all help to manage our challenging lives
3.  It takes years to figure out what your IBS food triggers are because there are potentially hundreds of possibilities.  Artificial sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, garlic/onions, dairy products and wheat/rye are some of the more common ones.
2.  Heather's Tummy Fiber and teas have made a huge difference in regulating my diarrhea, bloating, gas, and pain.  The site https://t.co/R4gKgoLzT9 has a patient forum, articles, the latest IBS news, etc.
1.  The unmanageable symptoms and revelation that I had IBS was life interrupting to say the least.  2 years later a lot has changed.  There is hope, treatment,  and especially the FODMAP diet.  It ain't easy and you may pay dearly for taking days, much a meal off.
