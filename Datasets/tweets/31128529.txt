Republicans didn‚Äôt have the middle class in mind when they wrote the tax law. American workers understand that, and they‚Äôre concerned about the impact the policy will have on their futures.
Michael Jefferson, a graduate assistant in Indiana, calls the tax law ‚Äúa big bust.‚Äù He says ‚Äúpeople who get the largest benefit are not the people who need it,‚Äù and adds that the law ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt changed the fact that I still have to work several different jobs to make ends meet.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have friends who are on food stamps and disability and things like that, and we don‚Äôt have a (federal) budget sorted out and I am terrified we‚Äôll lose these programs,‚Äù says Hammond.
Similarly, Liz Hammond, an administrative assistant in Massachusetts, says she would give up what little extra money she receives from the tax law to protect vital federal programs.
Mr. Smith is also concerned about the trillions the tax law adds to the national debt. He says the middle class will ultimately be the ones to pay for the Republicans' law in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.
While corporations‚Äô tax cuts are permanent, individuals‚Äô are temporary. Tim Smith is 61, lives in Florida, and works two jobs. He points out that any benefit he sees now will disappear in seven years and calls the tax law a ‚Äúrip-off.‚Äù		https://t.co/jZJuXybhTS

Brandon Eifert, who works at an Ohio sign company, worries that because of the tax law he won‚Äôt get a refund next year. What extra money he is seeing in his paycheck isn‚Äôt enough to take his girlfriend out to a nice dinner.

Today, Secretary Mnuchin will be defending a backwards law that puts middle-class Americans behind big corporations that are using their tax cuts to enrich top executives and wealthy investors.
Democrats want to expand Americans' opportunity. The GOP tax law does the opposite. To pay for the law‚Äôs corporate handouts, Speaker Ryan and President Trump plan to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, vital benefits that hardworking Americans have paid into and earned.
One instance in which Secretary Mnuchin more accurately represented the tax law? When he said its ‚Äúwhole purpose‚Äù is to give companies money. Corporations are the law‚Äôs big winners, not hardworking, middle-class Americans. https://t.co/Z3xKCH3yLY https://t.co/9RuJI90byL
