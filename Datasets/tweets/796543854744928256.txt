@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta @realDonaldTrump Amazing! Even with as opinions as diverse as ours, we can find SOME common ground. I like that. Too bad there isn't more of that in politics.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta @CNN RESPECT is such a strong word! I believe most of the media have lost all sense of objectivity. They try so hard to push their own personal views that they distort the truth. That is what we are talking about when we say #FakeNews. Do I trust ANY journalist? No I actually don't.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta @realDonaldTrump I've seen the famous clip of him telling supports to beat up a protester at a rally who was causing trouble &amp; joking about police beating up suspects but these are completely different situations. I don't condone violence unless in self defense &amp; neither should @realDonaldTrump.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta I have seen Acosta embarrass himself and @CNN on national television nearly every day for the last two years. I don't feel that way about all reporters, just those unhinged liberals with #TrumpDerangementSyndrome who can't seem to get past their own hatred to behave objectively.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta You know who does actually risk their lives for America? Conservative politicians who have the courage to stand up to the angry liberal mob. Ask @SteveScalise, @RandPaul, @SenatorCollins, @senorrinhatch, Mike Lee &amp; @LindseyGrahamSC.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta It was wrong of @realDonaldTrump to joke about an assault against a journalist but you are exaggerating by saying he has repeatedly encouraged violence against the press. I have not heard that.
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta I see...the old "by any means" get out of jail free caveat. I think "risks his life" is a bit dramatic don't you? @Acosta is a hateful, rude, impetuous, childish, resisting, bore. Despite this, nobody is talking about taking away his rights. We do agree on one thing: free speech!
@TwoOwlsFarm @Acosta You proved my point. Your bio talks of empathy &amp; kindness while your support and encouragement is for a man who has verbally abused and harassed another man telling him "F*** you" for a joke. You then say the hate is all me for pointing out that the left gets off on this hate.
