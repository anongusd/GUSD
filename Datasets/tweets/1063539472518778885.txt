@Phil_Buck @floridalottery @10NewsWTSP Other states have phone apps to scan lottery tickets for winners, but states that don't offer a phone app, like Florida,  make huge money off of discarded winners!

@Phil_Buck @floridalottery 3 different times I have checked my Fantasy 5's verifying the date too on site, and noticed that the website posted the wrong numbers and then corrected them after---but how many people tossed their winning tickets before the correction? The reason for so many expiring tickets!
@Phil_Buck @floridalottery Since lottery retailers told me 1 out of 60 to 80ish scratch-offs in the trash bin are actual winners they cash themselves, even the website odds are not correct!  People should always scan before trashing tickets, thrown out winners could mean false remaining prizes too.
@PhilBuckWTSP @floridalottery @10NewsWTSP https://t.co/vY669jGSmX
@Phil_Buck @floridalottery @10NewsWTSP Lottery retailers claim that 1 out of 80ish scratch tickets in the trash are missed wins... people throw winners away without double checking the numbers and the store owners scan them and keep the cash...so big wins get thrown out too, throwing off the accuracy of the site too.

@saltlifegirl48 And I noticed that when the top 10-million prizes were all claimed on the $25. World Class tickets, they continued to sell these tickets for months deceiving people when all top prizes were already claimed!
@saltlifegirl48 That is true!  Kudos to you and everyone else that enlightens the truth to innocent victims of deception!
@saltlifegirl48 These odds would only be honest if they sold out each pool completely before putting the next pool into circulation... otherwise the true odds would be the number of prizes out of 42-million!  It is very deceiving.
@saltlifegirl48 The average person would not be able to find this on their own.   So now the true odds would be number of winners out of 42,000,000  For axample 10 out of 42,000,000 NOT 10 out of 240,000 as they want you to think!  Simply because all tickets are in circulation at the same time!
@marshawright Sad but true... they lack confidence to stand up for themselves and other people will push them as far as they will let them before drawing the line.
@saltlifegirl48 On the 2M Holiday Bonus scratch-off it states there are 72 Pools of 120,000 tickets.  Why is it divided by 72 if all pools are in circulation?  Could that be so they can state odds on 120,000 tickets vs. the true 8,640,000 tickets circulated which would change the odds immensely?
@saltlifegirl48 Exactly!  The public needs to know the true odds of winning...not the fake odds they advertise!  It is theft by deception!
@saltlifegirl48 Great, thanks----time to do some simple math :)

Those odds would only be correct if there were 7 separate drawings of 107,143 tickets in each drawing.  Having 6 additional winners in the same drawing of 750,000 tickets only changes the odds by a tiny fraction....so it is still about 1 in 750,000 odds of winning the top prize.

I think they spend way too much time investigating retailers and not enough time investigating their own staff.
The lottery department is falsifying odds outrageously!  The odds of winning a top prize in a 750,000 ticket raffle with 7 winners is nowhere near 1 in 107,143 it is a small fraction off of 1 in 750,000  (This is one drawing, not 7 separated drawings!) https://t.co/ENQ14hnfxN … https://t.co/Ady9EVEbNq

@Rpc40051 In FL you have to wait 6 months after complaining to sue the state.  FL also sets limitations that people can only sue the state for a small amount on top of that (called sovereign immunity) so lawyers don't get too excited, even though it is easy to prove I am correct they say.

Phone-apps scan tickets so you don't toss a winner by mistake--but NOT Florida. Typically 1 out of 80 tossed tickets actually scans as a winner.

@evankirstel "Too bad Dr. Martin Luther King didn't survive long enough to stop all slavery!"
FL Statute 24.102 (b) "The Lottery games be operated by a department of state government that functions as much as possible in the manner of an entrepreneurial business" So Why are they Exempt from Florida Laws Requiring Fair Disclosures &amp; Cancellation Periods on Annuities? #hmmm https://t.co/rhehJ2gRnu

@PBCountySheriff good work
@JasonBeisel i don't blame them... FL drivers are careless
1 out of 80-ish thrown-out #scratchoffs scans as a winner (says store clerks)  Even machine tickets should be scanned since the #lottery site may post wrong winning numbers &amp; change them later--after you discard your tickets--hence Many expiring tickets to THEIR Benefit! #LOTTO https://t.co/YKwboA2iz2
@GainWithDanny11 Yes, absolutely 100%!
Wonder why Florida has many expiring winning tickets?  Notice the winning numbers posted on their website can be corrected later--AFTER many winning tickets were thrown out by trusting players. Scan them! Don't let them keep your winnings! 180 days to expire instead of 365? #hmmm https://t.co/ZsFfpDit45

Some states have phone-apps to scan scratch-off tickets so you don't throw out a winner by mistake--but not Florida.  Stores claim that 1 out of 80 thrown-out tickets is actually a winner on average.  Why provide an app that loses money they could take-back by consumer error? https://t.co/lHePBFKgMF
