Cohen on alleged tape showing Trump hitting Melania Trump in an elevator.		"I'm certain it's not true."
So Cohen has now pretty directly disputed both McClatchy's Prague reporting and the big BuzzFeed story -- under oath.
Cohen, under oath this time:		"I've never been to Prague. I've never been to the Czech Republic."
Cohen says he recorded Trump talking about hush money because "I knew he wasn't going to pay that money."		He says David Pecker had chewed him out.

Jim Jordan expresses shock that Cohen discussed topics of his testimony with House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).		There's a pretty simple likely explanation: They needed to decide what topics were on- or off-limits, because of investigations.
How about that: Republican Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) is actually asking Cohen about the substance of his allegations and trying to get information out of him!
Given a chance to revisit his statement that he didn't seek a White House job, Cohen doubles down:		"I did not want to go the White House."
Gosar is kind of a mess here. Tripping over his words as he tries to berate Cohen.
Now the GOP attack is that Cohen's lawyer (Lanny Davis) is working for free and may have ulterior motives.		Who else's lawyer is working for free? Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Important to note what's not said here:		-Cohen says Trump didn't direct him to lie (instead hinted at it)	-Says Trump directed Trump Tower Moscow pursuit, but doesn't say Trump knew about Kremlin contact	-Has said Trump knew hush money was illegal but doesn't detail how he knows
Cohen says his documents include "letters I wrote at Mr. Trump’s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores."		He makes clear later on that these were LEGAL threats.

We're basically relying on Barr's promise to "get as much as I can of the information to Congress and the public" -- a goal that he stressed was constrained by DOJ rules.
The Catch-22		1) DOJ guidance is that sitting president can't be indicted.		2) If Barr thinks he can only disclose info related to prosecutions, what happens to Mueller info about Trump/possible obstruction that isn't part of actual indictment?		3) In other words: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Barr also said this:		"The A.G. has some flexibility and discretion in terms of the A.G.'s report. What I am saying is my objective and goal is to get as much as I can of the information to Congress and the public."
Barr previewed all of this at hearing:		"The rules, I think, say the special counsel will prepare a summary report on any prosecutive or declination decisions, and that shall be confidential and be treated as any other declination or prosecutive material within the department."

UPDATED: Mueller just caught a 4th Trump aide lying about contact with the Russians		https://t.co/nOp8lgpdd1
List of Trump aides officially found to have lied about contacts with Russians:		-Flynn	-Cohen	-And now Manafort
This is key: Judge found, in 1 of 2 claims involving Kilimnik, that Mueller team proved Manafort lied.		That's one more Trump aide found to have lied about contacts with Russians. https://t.co/CBN0cQJWlV
We had basically known for months that Stone would probably be indicted.		Also, Manafort raid came BEFORE he was arrested. Hence less of a tip-off as far as grand jury activity. https://t.co/j4WXUIVzee
Judge says Mueller's team proved 3 of 5 alleged lies.		Another one that came up short:		"OSC has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that on October 16, 2018, defendant intentionally made a false statement concerning his contacts with the administration."
Interesting: Despite voiding cooperation deal for other lies, judge says Mueller's team failed to prove that, "on October 16, 2018, defendant intentionally made false statements concerning Kilimnik’s role in the obstruction of justice conspiracy."

So the denial is one thing; the broad nature of it is another. We shouldn’t just accept the denial, but it’s significant because it can be probed and disproven.		(7/7)
And if Mueller et. al. can establish ANY other interactions between Deripaska and Kilimnik (rather than simply Kilimnik liasing with a Deripaska aide like "Victor"), they’d easily be able to prove Deripaska had lied.		(6/7)
2nd is Deripaska's denial is broad -- and could be disproven. He says he NEVER interacted with Kilimnik, including 7/29.		We have a meeting on a specific day that lasted 5 hours. Obviously it’s another country, but wouldn’t seem impossible to establish where each man was.		(5/7)
That could be Deripaska talking about Russia, sure, but it would make sense (if not MORE sense) for it to be someone from Ukraine talking about Ukraine – whose future was very much in the balance.		We also know Manafort and Kilimnik discussed Ukraine specifically.		(4/7)
If that’s Deripaska -- a close Putin ally -- that’s a pretty direct line from Trump campaign to Kremlin, with an actual exchange of info described.		BUT Kilimnik, in his emails about the meeting, says the “black caviar” guy had talked about “the future of his country.”		(3/7)
But there are reasons to believe that 5-hour Kilimnik meeting with “black caviar” guy might not be him.		First, why this is important: Kilimnik’s emails made clear he had a info to pass along from whoever he met with on July 29 for his meeting with Manafort on Aug. 2.	 	(2/7)
Plenty of people reacting to my piece on Deripaska’s denial of ever meeting with Kilimnik by saying, "Why would we trust HIM?"		https://t.co/m23bbbML5U		We shouldn't. And cong investigators thought it WAS Deripaska. 		(1/7)

Weirdest moment of hearing, for me, was when Whitaker said he couldn't remember whether he first learned he got the acting AG job from a phone call with Trump or from Trump's tweet.		How is that moment not etched in your memory?
Whitaker said he didn't necessarily agree with an article he RTed that referred in its headline to “Mueller’s lynch mob."

Whitaker is pressed on whom he consulted on recusal. Eventually he names:		-Steve Engel	-Curtis Gannon	-Brad Weinsheimer		But Whitaker resisted naming them, complains about their "public exposure." 		These are confirmed appointees -- not low-level staff.
FBI Director Chris Wray has said the Mueller probe isn't a "witch hunt."		Rosenstein, who oversees it, has said it's not a witch hunt.		But Whitaker won't say it.
Whitaker won't answer whether Mueller probe is a witch hunt.		COHEN: Are you overseeing a witch hunt?		WHITAKER: It is an ongoing investigation, so it would be inappropriate for me to discuss an ongoing investigation.
.@mattzap was right: Jim Jordan is a weird hybrd here. Other Republicans are trying to protect Whitaker, but Jordan sees him as a vehicle to reveal alleged DOJ wrongdoing. He's pressing him hard.
Jim Jordan is trying to argue Mueller's mandate was too broad.		But Whitaker says this instead:		"In my experience, it's consistent with the appointments of other special counsels."

Doug Collins is starting with the baseless claim that DOJ tipped off CNN on Roger Stone arrest:		Whitaker calls it "deeply concerning to me as to how CNN found out about that."		There is no evidence they were tipped off. CNN said they were guessing.
Whitaker: "I have not interfered, in any way, with the special counsel's investigation."
WOW. Whitaker tells Nadler -- the committee chairman -- that he should stop asking questions.		"Mr. chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up."
The pattern so far:		1) Whitaker pauses and balks at questions		2) He and Nadler discuss it		3) He actually answers the question
Whitaker is asked whether he might have briefed third parties who would pass along Mueller info to Trump:		“I do not believe I have briefed third-party officials outside of the Department of Justice.”
KEY from Whitaker:		“I have not talked to the president of the United States about the special counsel’s investigation.”		Also says later he hasn't talked to senior WH officials.
Not exactly a confidence-inspiring start for Whitaker. Lots of pausing and thinking.
Reminders on Whitaker:		-Vocally critical of Mueller probe before joining DOJ.		-Ignored ethics officials advice to recuse.		-Was involved in patent company that reached $25 million FTC settlement for people who say they were defrauded.		-Didn't cooperate with that probe.

Motion to adjourn Whitaker's hearing, brought by ranking Republican, is defeated 24-10.
To be clear, there will be theater at this hearing. Saying an oversight hearing is completely "pointless," though, is going quite a bit further.
For someone decrying political "theater," that was quite the theatrical opening statement.
Doug Collins moves to adjourn the hearing before it really starts.		It will not be adjourned.
Doug Collins: "Mr. Whitaker, this is your life ... and they just want a piece of you."		Not sure that's the best way to calm his nerves.
Popcorn is good. And we should have it at every hearing.
House Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) on how this hearing will be a "dog and pony show."		"Bring your popcorn. I think we'll just set up a popcorn machine in the back."
"This hearing is pointless," says the leading Republican on the House Judiciary Committee about getting testimony from a man currently overseeing the Mueller probe.
House Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) calls Nadler's decision to agree that there will be no subpoena today "a full cave by the committee chairman."
Nadler makes clear he will keep pushing Whitaker for answers even after Barr is confirmed -- "even if you are a private citizen when we finally learn the truth."
Nadler makes clear to Whitaker that he has a subpoena holstered.		"There's no need to resort to that measure," but adds: "for now."
Nadler leans in on Whitaker:		"Why did President Trump leave you running the Department in an acting capacity as long as he did? What did he hope to get out of it? What did you provide?"
Nadler on Whitaker's recusal:		"You decided that your private interest in overseeing this particular investigation — and perhaps others from which you should have been recused — was more important than the integrity of the Department."

@jennagiesta Yeah I completely sympathize. And I think even if it was longer, all many people would digest was "$10 million" "70%" anyway.
@jennagiesta eek Jenn*
@jennagiesta I usually try to make it abundantly clear that only the income over $10 million gets taxed at 70%, and the rest is taxed at a lower rate. But requiring that degree of explanation isn't ideal in a poll either.
@jennagiesta Hey Jen -- Didn't mean to be critical. It is 100% technically accurate, but I think even accurate characterizations of it get glossed over by some people. I've seen it in the emails I get and the tweets I see on this.
@frandy38 Because these are the people actually proposing these things.
Also, the wording on Ocasio-Cortez's plan is confusing. Not entirely clear that this is ONLY income over $10 million, and not all the rest.
My take here:		Warren's plan would actually take more money out of wealthy people's pockets, but the percentages (2-3% of net worth) sound less scary than 70% (even though that's only on income over $10 million). https://t.co/MQBkbZcXWq
Poll questions didn't mention either name, fwiw, and didn't actually  include percentages in Warren's plan.

Ocasio-Cortez's wealthy tax nets an estimated $720 billion over 10 years. Sanders's would net $315 billion. Warren's: $2.75 trillion.		All these pale to Trump's 1999 one-time tax on the wealthy, which he said would have raised $5.7 trillion.		https://t.co/sULy7BEtM2

3 early takeaways from the Roger Stone indictment		https://t.co/wJgqaoq6Fk https://t.co/ivRvu1sX0J
Special counsel's office: "Stone will make an initial appearance at 11 a.m"
On Sept. 18, 2016, Stone requested specific WikiLeaks Clinton emails:		"STONE added, “Please ask [the head of [WikiLeaks] for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30—particularly on August 20, 2011 that mention [the subject of the article] or confirm this narrative.”
This seems pretty cut-and-dried. Mueller team says Stone REPEATEDLY said he only talked to his supposed WikiLeaks intermediary in person/via phone.		BUT, in fact he "engaged in frequent written communication by email and text message." https://t.co/tYRQtAqPJC
👀		"STONE told Person 2 that Person 2 should do a 'Frank Pentangeli' before HPSCI in order to	avoid contradicting STONE’s testimony. Frank Pentangeli is a character in the film The Godfather: Part II, [who testifies] not to know critical information that he does in fact know."
LATER:		"STONE also continued to communicate with members	of the Trump Campaign about [WikiLeaks] and its intended future releases."
In summer of 2016, "STONE was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1 [WikiLeaks]."		https://t.co/hPt8GbhhHW

Trump just lost key leverage in the shutdown https://t.co/Mk8q2aV7Vz
The Democrats' plan got 2 more votes, even though they have 6 fewer senators.
To be clear: Each of the 6 Republicans voting for the Dem plan is declining to hold the Trump line.		They will say they just want government open, but Trump's leverage depends on Republicans demanding wall funding. And they're not doing that.
This feels like a vote McConnell could take to Trump to make a case for bringing all this to an end.		And I'm not sure McConnell would be sad about it.
@GJFKessler fair
So looks like the Dem bill could get as many or more votes than the Trump plan, despite GOP's 53-47 majority.		Not great for negotiating posture.

Clarified this tweet. Trump can go in the chamber. He can't speak without permission.
Tempting to call a potential sergeant-at-arms showdown over SOTU a "constitutional crisis."		Don't think the term is apt, though. CC would require some kind of Constitutional ambiguity/dispute. The law is pretty clear that Trump has no right to the House podium w/out permission.
SOTU is a great proxy battle for larger shutdown fight.		But I'd be surprised if 15% of the country genuinely cares whether it goes down.
Pelosi held the line on Trump/SOTU.		Now Trump can show up and try to give the speech uninvited, or he can not show up and prove he was bluffing.		Both are ... not great options.		https://t.co/d5Ls8Nt9hM

Not only are random words capitalized, but this Trump letter includes a typo.		"I look forward to seeing you on the evening **on** January 29th in the Chamber of the House of Representatives."
So let's say it's Tuesday, and Pelosi hasn't budged. Trump can either show up and try to give the State of the Union by force, or he can not show up.		That latter would be quite the capitulation, after this letter.
TIRED: What if Trump loses reelection but won't yield power?		WIRED: What if Trump shows up to deliver his State of the Union, uninvited?
Trump seems to badly misunderstand both the process and his amount of leverage here.
This Trump letter isn't "I'd like to deliver the speech in the House chamber"; it's "I'm going to deliver the speech in the House chamber."		Right or wrong, that's Pelosi's prerogative. And no resolution has passed setting the date.

@BrandonBohning I’m sorry to lose you, Brandon.
And just like the Mueller investigation needs to mind perceptions of it, regardless of technical accuracy and careful wording, so do the media, and so do I.		(11/ END)
Mueller’s team would seem to have an extremely compelling interest in not just being technically accurate in its denial, but avoiding false perceptions that it denied more than it did. But you never know until you know.		(10/)
We also need to not repeat the same mistakes post-denial. Just like we shouldn’t jump to too many conclusions about BuzzFeed’s report, we shouldn’t just assume it was completely botched based upon one denial, no matter how authoritative the denier.		(9/)
I honestly don’t know what the answer is here, besides perhaps more patience and reflection in real time, and less emphasis on an unconfirmed report until others start confirming it. But then -- again -- less circumspect analysis might carry the day.		(8/)
Media consumers aren’t as savvy as we’d like them to be, and just because something is technically accurate and qualified doesn’t make it good. People skip right over those caveats, and if they want to believe these reports, they treat them like gospel.		(7/)
All of that said, each piece that’s written about something that may turn out to be untrue is counter-productive, at best. Even with extensive caveating (which I included), it furthers a story the erodes trust in the media.		(6/)
BuzzFeed story is not a direct parallel, but it raises similar issues. Those Clinton emails were in the public domain, and SOMEONE was going to find the big ones. Similarly, plenty of people would have learned about Trump allegedly telling Cohen to lie. Social media, etc.		(5/)
I’m reminded of what happened when the hacked Clinton emails came out. We all (okay, most of us) jumped on them. It was a hell of a story. We got an inside look into an actual presidential campaign! We were also unwittingly assisting a Russian propaganda effort.		(4/)
It’s trite to say, but we need to figure out how to handle this kind of story. It’s unconfirmed, but it’s out there. Lawmakers are talking about it! Democrats are talking impeachment! Can you ignore that very real debate? Do you just let partisan outlets own the analysis?		(3/)
First off, we don’t know exactly what Mueller team disputes, but the unprecedented nature of that denial suggests it sees a fundamental problem with the story. That statement doesn’t go out over a quibble or two.		(2/)
As someone who wrote about the Cohen-BuzzFeed story and its potentially very serious implications on Friday, I have some reflections/introspections after losing some sleep last night.		(THREAD 1/)

All CODELS are now canceled during shutdown.		So lawmakers aren't going to be able to get firsthand, in-person feedback from troops at a time when important decisions are being made about withdrawals.

Yes, Graham's reversal on Trump is stunning.		But he's also been a leading critic of Trump's on Khashoggi, Syria withdrawal, and now he just called Trump's Pelosi/Codel gambit "sophomoric."		Seems to draw the line on toadyism at the water's edge.

A little surprised by how much Feinstein and Coons have given Barr credit for his Mueller answers, which boil down to:		1) I will only recuse if i want to	2) I may not release the Mueller report -- even to Congress -- if I don't think the law allows
Feinstein thanked him for this answer, which was decidedly not a "yes." https://t.co/GOgZSCOxyU

Barr: "I feel like I'm at a position in life where I can do the right thing and not worry about the consequences."
LEAHY: Can a president offer a pardon in exchange for witness’s promise not to incriminate the president?		BARR: “No, that would be a crime.”
Barr on whether Trump will be allowed to take the Mueller report and put his own spin on it before it's released:		"That will not happen."
Barr says his criticism of the Democratic donations by Mueller's team was "very mild."		What he said: "In my view, prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party. I would have liked to see him have more balance on this group.”
Barr: "I have not personally researched the emoluments clause. I couldn't even tell you what it says."
Barr, asked whether he's received non-public info about Mueller probe (perhaps from Rosenstein, I guess?):		“I don’t recall getting any confidential information about the investigation.”
For the third time already, Barr caveats the idea that he will release Mueller report by saying he will do what the law allows.
GRAHAM: "Don't you think President Trump is a one-pager kind of a guy."		BARR: "I suspect he is."		GRAHAM: "Just remember that."
Barr on whether Sessions had a conflict:		"I don't have all the facts, but I think he did the right thing by recusing himself."
Barr: "I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt."
Graham calls Christopher Steele "Michael Steele," as one does.
Sure seems like the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee just prevailed upon the AG nominee to open up a specific internal inquiry.
Bar on whether he will look into Strzok texts, etc.:		"Yes, Mr. Chairman. ... I was shocked when I saw them."
Graham says "we need to look at" creating safeguards against FBI launching counterintelligence probes of a president.		Now talking about Peter Strzok's texts.		Quite the way to start the question and answer portion.

Barr repeatedly says he won't allow politics to influence his decision.		Worth noting: He has made clear his legal philosophy is very much in line with what Trump wants in re: executive power and Mueller probe.		It doesn't need to be "politics" to favor Trump.
As @DevlinBarrett noted on Post TV with me this morning, Trump's repeated comments about Sessions' lack of loyalty may have made any such conversations unnecessary.		Trump has made it clear he wants loyalty. Barr has to know that -- even as he may have made no such promises.
Important Barr quote:		"President Trump has sought no assurances, promises, or commitments from me of any kind, either express or implied, and I have not given him any, other than that I would run the department with professionalism and integrity."
Here's William Barr's full opening statement, with annotations		https://t.co/LWas7VMwkl https://t.co/43HYKH1hUb
Feinstein said Barr has said a president can "direct" DOJ to open a probe into political opponents		What Barr actually said: "There is nothing inherently wrong about a president calling for an investigation,” but it "shouldn’t be launched just because a president wants it."
More Barr on the Clintons/Uranium One in '17:		"To the extent it is not pursuing these matters, the department is abdicating its responsibility."
Barr on Clintons in '17:		“I don’t think all this stuff about throwing [Clinton] in jail or jumping to the conclusion that she should be prosecuted is appropriate.” Then he added: “But I do think that there are things that should be investigated that haven’t been investigated.”
Links to all this:		https://t.co/IyqQfczHVm		https://t.co/8tQ29KT4y5
What Barr has said:		1) More Clinton probes needed	2) Uranium One more worthy of probe than collusion	3) Comey firing AOK	4) Mueller team's donations too left-leaning	5) OK for presidents to request specific investigations	6) Mueller's obstruction probe "fatally misconceived"
Note on Feinstein's comment just now:		Barr said it was okay for a president to REQUEST specific investigations. He didn't say an AG must comply.
get ready the the GRILLING chyrons
Graham to Barr: "You will be challenged. You *should* be challenged. The memo -- there'll be a lot of talk about it, as there should be."
Graham goes on to mention low "morale" at DOJ.		But why might that be!?

It seemed to be regular old Trump puffery at the time, but that’s not mutually exclusive of him playing the long game for an eventual NATO pullout.
Incidentally, saying all the NATO countries agreed to pay more, as Trump did baselessly, would seem a possible pretext for pulling out when they don’t in fact pay more.

And more Barr:		"I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel’s work.  For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law. "
More Barr:		"I will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work.”		Noting the "Bob." He and Mueller are friends.
William Barr opening statement:		"I believe it is in the best interest of everyone – the President, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people – that this matter be resolved by allowing the Special Counsel to complete his work."

@PressSec 4) And related to Point No. 1, if there was any evidence of an actual terrorist using the Southern border, there is no question we'd know about it. State Dept. says none have and that it's not a good method of entry for terrorist groups (which is true, given arduousness)		(4/4)
@PressSec 3) Fact that Trump made no mention of terrorism in his speech Tuesday night says it all: This talking point has been neutered -- and rightly so. After Trump, Pence and @presssec all badly misstated the stats -- despite repeated fact-checking -- they're trying to save face.		(3/)
@PressSec 2) Resources are finite. Government must prioritize. Why build expensive border wall to stop 6 known or suspected terrorists on Southern border when many times more using Northern border -- and exponentially more using airports.		(2/)
.@presssec on Fox News this AM:		"Bottom line is whether it's one, whether it's 4, whether it's 14 or whether it's 4,000, one terrorist coming into our country in illegal fashion to do us harm one too many."		1) No evidence of any *actual* terrorist using Southern border.		(1/)

Almost 1/4 of Trump’s Cabinet has now been announced as departing since the 2018 election last month.
Imagine if Whitaker does anything that even carries a whiff of hamstringing Mueller. He will have done so after refusing a recommendation to recuse himself.
Worth noting from @DevlinBarrett and @mattzap:		"Whitaker never asked Justice Department ethics officials for a recommendation, nor did he receive a formal recommendation, this official said."
So the acting attorney general currently exercising some authority over the Russia probe was told he was too conflicted.		And he's not listening.

The other issue with this Examiner editorial is it treats it as gospel that Trump and Daniels had an affair and says that's Trump's chief failing. Trump has always denied the affair, and it's still something we all say is "alleged." This skips over that.
@grantbosse Now that's a valid argument! That's not the argument that's made here.
Hannity is talking to Kushner tonight
1) You're allowed to spend as much of your own money as you want, so even 1,000 haircuts is fine. Same with IA/NH trinkets.		2) You can't repay personal debts with campaign $$.		3) The issue with Stormy isn't that you can't use personal funds; it's that it wasn't disclosed.
These arguments suggesting it's dubious to label the Stormy payment a campaign finance violation are very bad. 		https://t.co/ka854dI8QB https://t.co/IcJn89Z4Ca

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) calls Barr an "able" and "experienced" lawyer.		But.		"Barr’s strange calls for the Department to investigate fringe conspiracy theories involving the Clintons raise questions, both about his partisanship and judgment."

William Barr in 2001 on Iran-Contra special counsel Lawrence Walsh:		He "was certainly a headhunter and had completely lost perspective and was out there flailing about on Iran-contra with a lot of headhunters working for him."
Imagine if it was a year ago, and Trump replaced Sessions with a guy who said the Comey firing was just fine and also said the Clintons should be investigated?		Trump lowered the bar with 12+ months of Sessions-bashing and then installing Whitaker, who makes Barr look reasonable.

So Trump basically dictated a lengthy statement about a hugely sensitive foreign policy matter that smears a slain journalist and discloses something the Saudis previously denied.

The sum of it all is that U.S. government still isn't really alleging anything the Saudis themselves haven't admitted. Saudis have said MBS had no role and his senior aide didn't only called for repatriation/not killing; U.S. isn't saying any different yet.
Here is the Treasury Department's specific language about MBS senior aide Saud al-Qahtani's involvement in Khashoggi's killing. 		https://t.co/LifTOZxzQY https://t.co/08N0joBaZM
In other words, the U.S. gov't is still stopping short of saying MBS's senior aide ordered or condoned the killing. The sanctions leave open the possibility that his actions merely *led to* that outcome.
Notably, Treasury says MBS senior aide Qahtani was "part of the planning and execution of the operation that led" Khashoggi's killing.		But then it says he and others were "responsible for, or complicit in, or having directly or indirectly engaged in serious human rights abuse."
New sanctions mean official position of Treasury Department is now that a senior aide to Mohammed bin Salman, Saud al-Qahtani, was culpable for Khashoggi.		The Saudis say he was involved in trying to repatriate Khashoggi, but he hasn't been indicted.		https://t.co/KeNee9Nz9N

4) -GOP holds House	-GOP also gains a few seats (or more) in Senate		This is the Trump/GOP dream, and it’s possible. 538 gives GOP 1-in-8 shot of hold the House, and if those toss-ups go mostly GOP, have to imagine GOP picks off several red Senate seats.		https://t.co/a9xzcjK6qk
3) -Blue wave crashes over the Senate, too	-House goes big for Dems		New Dem Senate majority likely requires them to win Tennessee. If they win Texas and/or ND too, it’s pretty much a complete sweep. Best possible outcome = 53-47 Dem majority.		https://t.co/a9xzcjK6qk
2) -Blue wave washes over the House/40-plus-seat gain	-Senate majority hangs in the balance		Dems need TX or TN for majority, assuming they lose ND. And they’d need to hold everything else (FL, IN, MO, MT, WV). Still tough, even in a wave.		https://t.co/a9xzcjK6qk

At the same time, Stone says pretty clearly that he won't testify against Trump. That's a firmer denial. But it also depends on how you define "testify against." If he views that as being forced to lie, it's a narrow denial.
