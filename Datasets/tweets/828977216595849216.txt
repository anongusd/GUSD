Remember, the size of your refund is not indicative of the taxes you paid. Getting a huge refund in April just means that the government got an interest free loan from your paycheck all year long. I remain focused on letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.
Additionally, tax experts find that 90% of middle class families are expected to receive an average tax cut of almost 2%. This is more than what the wealthiest Americans can expect to receive.
Instead of celebrating America's economic success, Democrats are desperate to disprove that tax cuts work. Now it looks like they'll have to find another talking point.	https://t.co/qFas4Xv9wn
We are living in one of the most economically prosperous times in recent American history. This is directly related to low-tax, pro-growth policies that allow folks to keep more of their hard-earned money. https://t.co/EyCEp8B2Zq

We cannot allow our nation to move towards destructive, socialist policies that endanger the liberties our forefathers fought so hard to preserve.
In just one month under @SpeakerPelosi's leadership, Democrats have:		Proposed giving money to those unwilling to work,	Been forced to apologize for #antisemitic rhetoric, and	Refused to condemn infanticide		I urge my colleagues to reject this radical, un-American agenda.
The waters off the East Coast are home to vulnerable mammal populations, military operations, tourist destinations, and a vibrant maritime economy. Allowing seismic testing is unnecessary and potentially hazardous to the coastal communities that rely on a healthy ecosystem.
Proud to join my colleague @CongressmanJVD in introducing the bipartisan Atlantic Coastal Economic Protection Act, which will protect the Atlantic Coast from seismic testing in federal waters, the first step towards offshore drilling. #ProtectOurCoast #NoSeismic #BlocktheBlast

The #GreenNewDeal is dangerous for our country. Free will dies with a socialist agenda. I hope my colleagues across the aisle reject these socialist proposals and find ways to address our nation’s challenges without resorting to authoritarian policies.
The most ridiculous part of #GreenNewDeal is how they propose paying for it – extending unspecified credit from the Federal Reserve. However, they reassure us that “the question isn’t how will we pay for it, but what will we do with our new shared prosperity.” Shared Prosperity?
In the #GreenNewDeal, Democrats would provide a job for everyone in America, but they would also give money to those “unwilling to work.” Why take the job when staying home pays the bills?
In the #GreenNewDeal, Democrats would eliminate all air travel, which may make it difficult to get around both domestically and internationally. Although they did acknowledge they “aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows." https://t.co/Mqqvz5nnlT

The wall, technology, and border agents all work together to achieve operational control of our border. If you remove one of these from the equation, our borders become less secure, our country less safe, and our communities at a greater risk of drugs and crime.
I have never seen a drone put handcuffs on a criminal. We need more agents on the ground to make arrests and process individuals who enter our nation illegally.
Drones, alert systems, and other technology monitor our border and direct officers to illegal crossings when and where they occur. But it’s not enough.
Walls, fencing, and other physical impediments discourage illegal crossings. They force traffickers and criminals to spend significant time and effort digging tunnels and climbing, offering law enforcement the time to detect individuals attempting to illegally cross the border.
As a former Sheriff, I know that the best security plans require a multi-layered approach. This remains especially true for our southern border.
Today, a bipartisan, bicameral group of members is meeting to negotiate a package of resources – barriers, technology, and human resources – to help us finally bring our border under operational control.
