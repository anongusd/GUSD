On a positive note, the hospital that creeped my out the most was torn down and turned into a really cool student union building. Sen. Warren was the first speaker after it opened and I got her signature. ULowell has come a long way:-).
@plambeckery @DrJenGunter @andizeisler I vowed to never use such a hospital, read the fine print and never let someone control my body that way. My body, my baby, my family, my choice, shame on anyone who thinks they know more about what you go through. I hope all is well now. The NICU is one hard test for parents.
@plambeckery @DrJenGunter @andizeisler Thank you, so true. Such decisions are so personal and so private. One of the most shocking things I learned as an Undergrad student was about how a Catholic hospital could with policy, make that choice. To save the baby over the Mother if she was under anesthesia.
