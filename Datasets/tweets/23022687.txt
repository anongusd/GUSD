Six years ago when I ran for the Senate, I promised I‚Äôd fight for lower taxes, lower regulations, and more jobs. I‚Äôd fight to secure the border. And I‚Äôd fight to defend the Constitution. I‚Äôve kept that promise. #KeepTexasRed --&gt; https://t.co/rzQF94MdAX #TXSen #TXSenateDebate

We have an opioid crisis in this country. I think talking about legalizing all narcotics is profoundly dangerous and doesn‚Äôt advance the interests of Texas. #TXSenateDebate #TXSen #ChooseCruz

In Beto O'Rourke's own words #TXSenateDebate https://t.co/uUzW7DSqgo
Over and over again Congressman O‚ÄôRourke -- when faced with police and law enforcement -- he sides against the police. #TXSenateDebate
We need to do everything possible to secure the border. And we can do that at the same time as we welcome and celebrate legal immigrants. #TXSenateDebate
My views on immigration are simple: Legal, good. Illegal, bad. 		I think most Texans agree with me. #TXSenateDebate https://t.co/nkSQaADsin

See, that‚Äôs the problem. You think that bc they showed a pic of me standing &amp; talking to reporters. But that pic was taken ON A DIFFERENT DAY. There were no cameras yesterday &amp; if you listen to the audio, you can hear I‚Äôm walking quickly to a meeting. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dishonest. https://t.co/6l1oiPd1aU
At this point, none of the investigations has demonstrated any criminal conduct needing to be pardoned, as much as those who hate the president might wish otherwise.
As for me, I still haven't studied the issue at that level of detail, and I don't intend to -- because this is nothing more than an academic debate.
This is not a question one should answer based on knee-jerk partisanship, as opposed to careful constitutional analysis.
Finally, other partisan journalists have attacked me for saying "that is not a constitutional issue I have studied, so I will withhold judgment at this point." That was true then, and is true now.
Both are straightforward legal propositions; neither is implicated because they do not concern WHOM can be pardoned.
What those attacks miss is that it is clear that (1) pardons must be retrospective (looking to crimes in the past), not prospective (pardoning future crimes), and (2) they must be addressed to specific persons, not generic categories of offenses.
They cite a law review article I wrote saying that Obama's executive amnesty was illegal, and that the pardon power did not justify it.
Yet others (see https://t.co/drS6Youbi2) have focused on my criticisms of President Obama's abuse of executive power, suggesting that it is somehow hypocritical not to oppose Trump's assertion of executive power.
When reporters chased me down the hall, and another asked the question again, I chose to answer.
Some dishonest journalists have attacked me for "taking 18 seconds" to answer -- without acknowledging that I was walking through the Capitol, late to a meeting, and simply ignoring a question that a reporter had called out at me (as senators do every single day in the Capitol).
Whether the Department of Justice opinion is right is an open legal question, with scholars on both sides of the political spectrum disagreeing in good faith.
That legal principle has a long and venerable history, but it is not reflected in the constitutional text.
However, in the 1970s, the Department of Justice did issue a legal opinion that the president cannot pardon himself, relying on the principle that nobody can be the judge in his own case.
That text has no limitation on WHOM can be pardoned (although nobody can be pardoned from impeachment or for non-federal offenses).
If we were actually focusing on the Constitution, the answer would be more complicated. The text of the Constitution provides, the President "shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."
Virtually every Dem is saying "of course not, the president can't pardon himself (mostly because we hate Trump)." On the other hand, some Rs are saying "of course the president can."
On the question of whether a president can pardon himself, we're seeing an abundance of knee-jerk partisanship and dishonest journalism.

RT @TheRightScoop: Ted Cruz releases awesome statement on Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from Iran deal! https://t.co/oFJPDI4W5g https://t.co/PLeDLhqgll
I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues, with the Trump administration, and with America‚Äôs allies in crafting and implementing a comprehensive strategy to make good on that promise.
All options must be on the table to confront Iran and ensure that it never acquires nuclear weapons.
We must prioritize the release of all unjustly imprisoned U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents held hostage.
We must ensure that the U.S. and our allies are equipped to combat not only illicit conventional weapons transfers and ballistic missile tests, but the war Iran has been waging across the region.
Now begins the difficult work of undoing the damage caused by the deal and rolling back the gains it enabled Iran to make. We must re-impose tough sanctions that target Iran‚Äôs regime.
They boast about having seized Arab capitals and creating a crescent of Shia control. Their forces launched an armed drone into Israel, arguably an act of war.
They have seized and harassed our sailors in the Arabian Gulf. They engage in cyber warfare against us, our companies, and our interests. Their proxies smuggle drugs into the United States, eroding our health and degrading our society.
They have set up and funded proxies across the Middle East ‚Äì Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza ‚Äì who attack our allies and have launched missiles at our ships.
Iran's money laundering and terror financing operations poison the global financial system that we rely on for continued prosperity.
Iran is the world‚Äôs foremost state sponsors of terrorism and has been caught plotting to launch attacks on American soil. They have sought to acquire nuclear weapons. They continue to hold American citizens hostage.
There is little doubt that Iran poses an immediate threat to the United States.
The terms also included incentives and concessions to sweeten the deal even further for Iran, including placing some of their nuclear activities under international sponsorship.
It trusted the Iranians to enforce restrictions against themselves, and as a result ‚Äì as the recent presentation by Israeli Prime Minister @Netanyahu made clear ‚Äì significant parts of Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons program went undetected.
The deal was also unenforceable on its own terms.
It prohibited us from using our most powerful sanctions against the full range of Iranian aggression, but only imposed restrictions against some of Iran‚Äôs nuclear activities ‚Äì and even then, only temporarily. As a result, the region is now potentially on the brink of war.
It provided Iran with vast resources that it could funnel into missile tests that could enable them to launch a nuclear weapon on the American homeland.
It gave Iran‚Äôs despotic regime the resources to expand across the Middle East, all the way up to the borders of our closest allies in the region, and created an incentive for the international community to turn a blind eye to Iranian military activities and atrocities.
The Obama Iran deal has been a catastrophe.
I commend President Trump for exiting the Obama Iranian nuclear deal and for his commitment to confronting Iran‚Äôs "Death to America" regime.
Today, @POTUS boldly told the world that the United States will not be bound by an agreement that advances the interests of an enemy committed to the destruction of our nation and our allies.

The United States should therefore withdraw immediately, re-impose crushing sanctions, work to encourage our allies to do the same, and do everything necessary to ensure that the Ayatollah Khamenei NEVER acquires nuclear weapons to make good on his pledge of "death to America."
As the President has said repeatedly, this deal is a "terrible deal," even worse than many previously realized.
In light of these astonishing Israeli revelations, the course before President Trump is clear.
And second, those billions of dollars have also propped up a despotic regime and provided vast resources for ongoing ballistic missile tests designed to enable Iran to launch a nuclear weapon on the American homeland.
The national security consequences of the Obama Iranian nuclear deal are twofold: First, America has allowed billions of dollars to flow to the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism, a nation directly responsible for the murder of hundreds of U.S. servicemen and women.
(3) the Obama nuclear deal was predicated on that edifice of lies; and (4) Iran is today in violation of that deal.
These Iranian documents prove (1) for 2 decades, Iran has conducted a clandestine nuclear weapons program; (2) Iran lied repeatedly, and brazenly, denying that secret program;
Through extraordinary intelligence operations, Israeli agents captured over 100,000 secret documents and files from Iran.
The Prime Minister‚Äôs presentation was remarkable ‚Äî unprecedented ‚Äî and worth watching in full: https://t.co/7VSxCYl380
Today‚Äôs stunning revelations by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu powerfully demonstrate why the Obama Iran nuclear deal is not just unfixable, but truly catastrophic.

I encourage all my fellow Americans to join me today in praying for Alfie and his family.
I urge the UK government to grant the Evans family‚Äôs request to treat their precious child in Italy. Americans strive to achieve the promise of ‚Äúlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness‚Äù for all our citizens, no matter how young or old.
Alfie‚Äôs life support was turned off two days ago. NHS doctors expected that he would pass away within minutes. Again, he fought back; at the time of this writing, he is continuing to breathe without assistance. But time is of the essence.
It is a grim reminder that systems of socialized medicine like the National Health Service (NHS) vest the state with power over human lives, transforming citizens into subjects.
It is a sad irony that while the people of the UK are busy celebrating a royal birth, its government is brushing off a commoner‚Äôs right to life.
These events remind us of the tragic case of Charlie Gard last year.
But UK and European courts have denied their right to seek alternate treatments for their son and instead have forcibly kept him in a hospital. Now they have turned off the ventilator and are waiting for him to die.
Alfie‚Äôs parents, Kate James and Tom Evans, wish to seek experimental treatments for what is thought to be a mitochondrial condition. Italy has granted Alfie citizenship and offered to transport him to a Vatican hospital.
Doctors initially thought that Alfie would not survive long, but he fought back time and time again, until a chest infection forced him to rely on a ventilator.
Alfie Evans was born on May 9, 2016 in the United Kingdom. When he was only several months old, he was struck by a mysterious illness, and slipped into coma.

@yashar üò¨
Washington is failing the American people, but I will continue to fight for a better path, one that respects the will of the American people, who sent us here to fight for fiscal sanity.
These provisions are the few glimmers of light trying to escape the gravity of this black-hole of federal spending and liberal priorities.
Second, the bill includes the Taylor Force Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored, which will stop U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to the Palestinian Authority if it continues its policy of paying monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.
The bill will also increase our security here at home by providing resources for new border security infrastructure and personnel.
First, it fully funds our military, providing an additional $61 billion for national defense over FY 2017 levels, the largest year-to-year increase in base funding for the Department of Defense in 15 years.
Finally, although this bill overall is truly a monstrosity, it does contain a few positive elements for which I gladly advocated.
I also worked to prevent an increase in the passenger facility charge; another tax increase that would have driven up the cost of every airline ticket purchased by consumers and inflicted a significant burden on the Texas airline industry, which supports thousands of Texas jobs.
This proposal would have applied to virtually every transaction on the Internet, pouring cold water on the benefits of the bold tax cuts we achieved last year. Americans need more permanent tax relief, not additional tax burdens.
Lobbyists in Washington also almost got a new Internet sales tax added to the bill, which would have been catastrophically foolish.
I'm proud we successfully blocked a bailout of Obamacare. There were voices in DC who wanted to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars directly to insurers, so they can maintain their Obamacare policies. We promised Americans we would repeal and replace Obamacare, not prop it up.
To be sure, this bill could have been even worse. I am happy to say that I was able to fight to keep out even more egregious proposals.
All of these measures amount to piling even greater debt onto the backs of our kids and grandkids, all because we are incapable of living within our means.
It fails to reduce funding for the EPA, which under Obama administration zealots, killed thousands of jobs and dramatically strayed from its core mission of ensuring clean air and water.
It funds the Ex-Im Bank, a classic example of corporate welfare that has doled out over $100 billion in taxpayer-guaranteed loans, primarily to a handful of giant and well-connected corporations.
It tells federal agencies that they can spend taxpayer dollars to study the ‚Äòcauses‚Äô of gun violence, a mandate that ‚Äì make no mistake ‚Äì will be abused by future liberal administrations to manufacture evidence to try to violate law-abiding citizens‚Äô Second Amendment rights.
It fails to provide sufficient funds to properly secure our border, let alone build the wall that is necessary.
It continues to fund sanctuary cities, which are defying law &amp; making Americans less safe. Instead of rewarding sanctuary cities, we should be passing legislation like Kate‚Äôs Law, a bill I introduced to put criminal illegal aliens in jail so they can't prey on innocent Americans.
It continues to fund Planned Parenthood, a corrupt organization whose horrifying abortion practices should preclude it from receiving taxpayer dollars.
The disastrous elements of this bill are almost too numerous to list.
Now, Congress is poised to do the exact opposite: pass a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill ‚Äî 2200 pages drafted by the Swamp in the dark of night ‚Äî that will plunge our nation even deeper into debt.
In 2016, the American people voted overwhelmingly for Republicans to change Washington.
This is why I‚Äôll vote against the omnibus spending bill:

I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to confront and defeat the tyrannical Iranian regime and help ease human suffering in this tumultuous region.
Because our servicemen and women are not themselves engaged in armed conflict in Yemen, but rather are providing refueling and logistical support for the efforts of our allies, the constitutional requirement for a declaration of war is not triggered.
I also remain a strong defender of Congress‚Äôs constitutional authority to declare war prior to extended military conflict.
The supporters of the Resolution have raised some reasonable concerns, and I believe Congress should continue to exercise appropriate oversight over the Executive Branch.
Absent US leadership, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen would undoubtedly worsen; oversight related to laws of armed conflict would be an afterthought; and our men and women in uniform could potentially be required to engage in a conflict far more dangerous than exists today.
Strategic implications of US retreat from established agreements &amp; obligations w/ allies not only damages counterterrorism efforts w/ partners, but serves to create a vacuum for other actors, such as Russia, to assert unchecked influence &amp; provide material support, w/o conditions
Yemen, a country plagued with conflict, is fertile ground for exploitation by the Iranian regime to advance their political and military ambitions.
Iran and their terror network continue to spread hate and radical ideologies across the Middle East. This deeply destabilizing force must be confronted at every opportunity either directly or through our partners and allies.
