#HR8 passed the House! The @NRA no longer has a stranglehold on the federal government. The years of No Republican Action in the House on #gunviolence are over. The Senate and President should do the right thing and make universal background checks law. https://t.co/35Nne3M9Ow
Nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of gun violence. Enough is enough. I am proud to vote today for #HR8, a bipartisan bill to keep our communities safe from gun violence by expanding universal background checks. #EndGunViolence
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That’s why I am voting today to support #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks.
.@realDonaldTrump is trying to fundamentally alter the separation of powers between the branches of our government as set out in the Constitution. This goes beyond party – my @HouseGOP colleagues must stand up against this #FakeEmergency!

President Trump’s attack on the Diversity  Visa Program is  nothing  more than a ploy to rally his base and sow  racial animosity. 		America deserves better.		https://t.co/TRgf0jbeDY		4/4
The Diversity Visa Program extends the American dream to countries that have low rates of immigration to the USA. DV recipients, particularly those from African countries, are  well-educated; and all  Diversity Visa recipients must pass a stringent  background  investigation. 3/
President Trump’s so-called ‘pillars of immigration’ are an example  of his divisive agenda. The President called for Congress to eliminate  the Diversity Visa Program, which is an important tool to maintain  fairness in our nation’s #immigration policy. 2/
We all knew @POTUS @realDonaldTrump can read, but the question is whether he can lead. His State of the Union address called for unity, but the President’s agenda and policies have divided the country. Actions speak louder than words. 1/

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS The false narrative that the Diversity Visa Program sends over the worst people from African countries is absurd and ignorant. 6/6
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS "African immigrants were more than twice as likely as the U.S. population overall to work in healthcare—32,500 nursing psychiatric or health home aides, more than 46,000 registered nurses and more than 15,700 doctors and surgeons.” We need them, and they need us! 5/
@realDonaldTrump (Only 38 percent of @POTUS's favored Norwegian immigrants graduated college with a bachelor's degree or higher.) 4/
@realDonaldTrump For one thing, immigrants from Africa are exceedingly well-educated. Whereas only 32 percent of the U.S. born population who are 25 and over have a bachelor's degree, 41 percent of Diversity Visa immigrants from Africa have one. 3/
@realDonaldTrump The Diversity Visa Program has allowed the best and brightest from Africa and the Caribbean to legally immigrate to America. Of the sub-Saharan immigrants who have become legal permanent residents, 17% came through the DV Program. 2/ https://t.co/aqEEYHfSZ8
