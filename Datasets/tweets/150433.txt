Cable News is about 80% gossipy garbage now.  MSNBC reports almost nothing but Trump gossip, while FOX right wing sycophancy knows no bounds.  Edward Murrow is twisting painfully on the knives in his chest from new wave "journalists" who betray truth and logic with every breath.
The level of delusion among Trump folks really has no bounds.  We already know the Russian collusion is real and extensive. Ignoring this level of corruption comes at the peril of the republic.  #MAGA people need to get a grip or we could lose the nation to thievery and lies.
Read your own stuff.    You *could* make a coherent case that despite his collusion and corruption he's a good president - ie that we need dishonesty and deciet in a hard world.  BUT YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY think there's no collusion - that is delusionally blind on your part. https://t.co/BxCgDyg4VW

@FareedZakaria The Fifth Risk seems delusionally misguided to me.  Bureaucracy isn't needed wasn't intended by founders.  Proof he's wrong is that we see few problems despite Trump's corruption and incompetence!  @michaellewis
@FareedZakaria hmm - the Michael Lewis transition story takeaway seems to me "bureaucracy isn't really needed" if it was we would see *far more problems* from the shittybtransition.   This hypothesis is testable.
@kaifulee thank you for excellent insights on @FareedZakaria .  Agree about deterioration of US perceptions of China - how do we fix this?!

@Sen_JoeManchin looks like #Kavanaugh is up to you Joe.  I fear  the "yes" votes represent putting politics above country. The future is important and is the key concern here.
@jdmaccoby good work defending common sense on @OutnumberedFNC even though FOX is often a #logicdesert.

Just in case you don't get basic logic, *availability of guns* was a key factor in the Waffle House murders,  Also mental illness.  But the second is present *always*, guns only present when rules are too relaxed.  Guns explain US homicide rate, other factors do not.

So Which LEGITIMATE HUNT are you saying is a #WitchHunt?.  Unless you are a wing nut, Mueller is doing exactly as he was tasked by TRUMP's own people.  Delusion views of this don't change the facts.
Facebook abusers probably brought Trump to power without a popular vote, but with very clever (and some illegal) marketing tactics that targeted key state voters.

@gabe1925 hi I'm studying the fake pro-Trump accounts like yours - who runs this?
Amazing to me how TV journalists have fallen out of touch with real news.  It's amost all Trump Tweety gossip now.  Pathetic.
Yet there is an anti-Trump agenda.  I don't support Trump but cringe at how "journalism" has become gossipy nonsense.  You're in a nonsense bubble dude.  Malaria trends - that's real news but not covered. https://t.co/gogyyOBhVZ
