To defeat #ISIS, we must destroy their legitimacy, cut off their sources of revenue, &amp; attack their command centers. https://t.co/UjHjmqcvvR
Mr. President, let‚Äôs not be concerned if we offend our enemies, let's pay a whole lot more attention to how do we protect our people. #SOTU
Mr. President, you must call the enemy out by name. It is impossible to defeat #ISIS if we do not call evil what it is &amp; act against it.
Pres. Obama finally speaks about #ISIS but still won't admit that it's a Radical Islamic Terrorist movement that seeks to destroy us. #SOTU
President Obama should be talking less about global warming and more about how we can defeat #ISIS and protect the homeland. #SOTU
While President Obama is complaining about global warming 10 of our American sailors are held in Iranian custody. #SOTU

I urge parents/guardians to please not allow your children to be exposed to the dangers of uncontrolled agitators on Baltimore's streets.
My thoughts and prayers to those who are experiencing fear and loss, including the families of Mr. Gray and first responders/officers.
The best way to create positive change is via peaceful conversation and policy ideas that display a commitment to resolution.
As a former resident of Baltimore, it is very sad and unfortunate to see the destruction taking place by irresponsible individuals.

In order for a divided government to work, each branch must respect the other two branches.
