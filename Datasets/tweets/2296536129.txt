So, what to do? My bumper sticker answer: The NSC should only do the things that only the NSC can do - enabling presidential decision and driving interagency implementation. Best of luck to the new hires. (5/5)
Also key is recognition of proper roles ‚Äì NSCs in successive administrations have pulled more and more policy nuts and bolts into the White House. Understandable, sure, but a harmful tendency that starves the process of oxygen, in the form of options for the president (4/5)
As the natsec bureaucracy re-centers around ‚Äúgreat power competition,‚Äù a la NSS/NDS, a disciplined decision-making and implementing process driven from the White House is going to be key. (3/5)
Successful APNSA‚Äôs and their staffs have driven a process that tees up decisions for the president and then drives the bureaucracy to implement them ‚Äì simple in theory, hard in practice. (2/5)
