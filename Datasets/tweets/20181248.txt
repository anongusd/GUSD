@ChuckHoskin_Jr @osiyo_tv @PringleLATimes @CherokeeNation .@ChuckHoskin_Jr Yout quote  “it is particularly disturbing” when minority set-aside contracts are granted to members of “a group that is posing as a tribe.”		Not "particularly DISTURBING" enough to show some outrage on Nat'l Tv though?.. when you had the opportunity #Failure
@ChuckHoskin_Jr @osiyo_tv @PringleLATimes @CherokeeNation U found TIME @ChuckHoskin_Jr to make @CNN appearance &amp; be VERY upset w Sen, Warren.
