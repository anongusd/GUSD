incredibly happy that the Democrats took to the house back. Trump will now be shut down every single time and the Democrats will make his next two years a living hell for him. I just want to say how amazing it is to have seen all the women elected to office! #MidtermElection2018

The NRA is an awful organization. It blocks any solutions to our nation‚Äôs rising rate of gun violence. It has many of our politicians in its pocket. Vote out the NRA this November. Vote for your Gun Sense candidates and vote out the NRA! #VoteThemOutNov6th #VoteForOurLives

Really makes you wonder If only Republicans made it as hard to buy a gun as they've made it to vote
If we let the Republicans keep control of the House and Senate. They will:	- Cut Healthcare	- attack our democracy	- continue to attack the media	- continue make schools and places of worship unsafe	- continue to support white nationalists		So VOTE THEM OUT
Our Country. Not Trump's country. 		VOTE. VOTE. VOTE. 		#VoteToSaveAmerica #VoteBlue
