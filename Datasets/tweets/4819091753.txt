@TurkanaDK @just_myName @Bosengood @KaraCalavera That's all it is, a concept. Dianne feinstein actually has legislation. Wish ocasio-cortez would actually try to learn the job that she has. She could do well and do good if she would just try. Too busy being in front of the camera, that's her problem.
@Wayward888 @sagetwitting @AshaRangappa_ They were disrespectful showing up unannounced. She was between appts. She gave them her proposal asked them to read it, &amp; asked for feedback. The parents could take time to read it &amp; call office to make an appt to sit down &amp; talk. Will a 6/8 yr old understand the legislation?
@empinto @ACMBuckeyes @ChrisMurphyCT Who's been pushing this story for two years? It's a shame when you can't believe your own government. The US has contributed to this situation. The people in charge were architects of total destruction in that part of the world a couple of decades ago. I remember.
@empinto @ACMBuckeyes @ChrisMurphyCT My son-in-law is in the army. He's been to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. I'll be damned if he's going to go to Venezuela so that Trump can get some oil. The sanctions imposed by the US have made the problem what it is today. For two years Trump has wanted war. No, no, no!
@Alean4 @AshaRangappa_ They ambushed her in her office while she was between appointments. she didn't have to stop to speak with them at all. A lot of senators wouldn't have. The people who came to her office without an appointment, talking over her are wrong. The children were props... end of story.

@maziehirono Don't you think we should find out if these accusations are true before we demand people resign from their positions? MSM/Dems attacking people because someone makes an accusation is horrendous. What if it happened to you? What if you knew you were innocent but no one listened?
@maziehirono Dems are making this a branding exercise to win elections. This is unAmerican.These are real people being accused. Accused have  right to investigations not knee-jerk calls for resignation. Zero tolerance leaves no room for the rule of law. Blind belief has gone too far.

@maziehirono Vourageous to accuse? It's a way to get someone out of office. Dems disappoint me. Branding party as zero tolerance is ridiculous. It ignores rule of law. Constitution guarantees due process. If this was real, accusers would go to police, not MSM. Dems allowing set up by GOP.
@maziehirono Being accused of something is not the same as being guilty of something. The Democratic Party wants a brand rather than fairness &amp; due process. Fairfax has asked for an investigation. If these allegations were true, wouldn't there be some action by law enforcement? Due process!
