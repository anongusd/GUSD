It took me years to learn that what happened to me was actually rape and that it was wrong. When I tried to come forward socially with the rest of the abuse I experienced I was not believed and lost nearly everything in that regard. #whyididntreportit

Social ramifications are absolutely nothing compared to relative safety and piece of mind.
To clarify, I am not referring to questions brought out of a curiosity to know more. Asking how my computer works is fine. Asking if we have caretakers or how we can be in romantic relationships as PWD or anything like that.... just no

Pain is a core part of the human experience, yet its so hard to understand and treat and often there are no solutions. Also something that the world tends to lack empathy for.

@PatBouchard  shhhh don't start spreading my secrets :p
I finally got some good sleep. Bad news is that I missed class
What I was trying to say there: I am way too awake for this time of morning. :p
If I am awake at 6:00 in the morning to read something about the scientific nature of human sexuality without sleeping, something is wrong
I will push myself to my limits and even that will not be enough
To be free and spread my wings requires me to actually have wings; but they have been clipped way beyond usability now.
I must do something with my life, but eating chocolate and watching Star Trek in bed seems to be all I am capable of at the moment.
I am not OK right now, but one day I will be. And that is all that matters
Irony is a bitch; I take a mental health day on Wednesday to discover that I'm coming down with something today.
Today is the day I can't look at Facebook without fear of throwing my phone against a wall in exasperation
I want a massage, hugs and dreamless uninterrupted restful sleep. Then I'd be a happy person

I will finish this paper tonight if it is the last thing I do, even though it is technically due next Thursday. just wanna get it done
@arjantool Yeah, its a drawback. I've learned to accept that it could go away at any time, but definitely different in theory than reality
@arjantool Kinda, returned a little though but not as much as before.
Meh, probably shouldn't have gone to class today but I guess I'm here.
@arjantool Some periferil vision in each eye, I could see light and objects. That has been decreasing though before this
@monkeypusher69 Glad its stable. If I may ask, what is your eye condition?
Looks like for now I have no vision. I may have to be a blindy and walk around with my eyes closed

@hllf  writing
I can't let the darkness win. Must keep pushing forward
New rule: I am not  going to retweet anything that does not capitalize the letter I.
I hate when I feel myself emotionally shutting down so I can't finish the piece that would have helped me get through all of this. Oh well.
I can't change how I got here, I can only move forward
The silence magnifies the pain, both inside and out. All I can do is wait it out.
Push everything down until I can't anymore. It's all I know
@hllf I'm not :p
Moonlight Sonata is incredibly peaceful. I'm glad I remembered this existed. Also, I think my nails are already chipping :(
I actually like this manicure pedicure thing after all. Turns out i am somewhat feminine after all
I love showing people I actually know some things about color. Call me pretentious

I hate email and outlook. Especially when I have to find something specific from a month ago and outlook is extremely slow.
I just can't seem to get in the holiday spirit. I guess this means I'm getting older
Nutella milkshakes are amazing. Conjestedness is not
I can be so full of drive and determination and know what I want one second and then the next feel completely unsure and unsettled. meh

Green apple life savers are good. Must remember that
Incredibly done with life and the part I have in it
I have no energy today. I seriously hope this means that I'm almost done with this thing.
I should really get some school work things done, but I don't really want to. Granted, I don't really have any better plans
Fresh flowers in my room and hot chocolate. Maybe my spirits will lift
@sledge071 definitely. And I can't continue wasting energy on this
@sledge071 Individual assignments used to bother me. Now I honestly don't Care. Call me lazy, but I'm happier, for now at least
@sledge071 It really is, especially from someone who would check them at least 6 times a day before at some times
I just realized I haven't checked my grades into weeks. And I don't care. It's rather freeing.
I can use my phone with one ear and still have an outside conversation. Just noticed that
@sledge071 pretty much the same here
@sledge071 I see. I think being sick contributed to mine. Facing the world tomorrow is going to be a challenge
@sledge071 solidly?
How much sleep must take place before it comes to be undesirable

@glasscity1837 yea
@glasscity1837  probably getting better. I sound like shit and I hate thermometers.
@glasscity1837 i've heard mixed things about that one. Good luck.
@glasscity1837 The older version I was using didn't let me create lists for some reason. I should play with that now.
@glasscity1837 I just got a notification that I was added to your list. And I get what you mean. My mute buffer says it's on, but it's not
I'm so bored I making Spotify playlists. Also, I want to make cookies but I don't think in my current condition I will be allowed near them.
@glasscity1837 LOL, I saw that. Also, another list?
I hate coughing. And I got maybe 2 hours of sleep before this started
@musicfairy15 remind me to send you that when I get back to my computer
Somehow accidentally favorited my own tweet. How is this a thing

Mystery solved. I have bronchitis
@glasscity1837 sort of. Not sure if school is in the cards today yet

@sillymunchkin7 I am
@sillymunchkin7 thanks
@brailleman89 thanks
Temp is still 101. Definitely not going to school
Fingerless gloves are amazing except for the fact that my fingers are still cold
I'm so cold I'm sitting here wearing a coat and gloves. Anyone who knows me knows the rarity of this
I never realized how much energy it took to talk
Three more days. I'm exhausted and want to sleep
Disorientation/dizziness/lightheadness are I think the worst symptoms of being sick
No fear Shakespeare is the best time saver. At least for now
My own inability to get things done angers, upsets, and baffles  me tremendously.
My lack of attention span is seriously starting to become a problem.
That last part could be seen as a sexual innuendo, although it wasn't its intent. Or at least in my sleepy brain it sounded like one
Must remind myself that the road less traveled is indeed the better path, and that this road will get a traveler.
Yep, I'm officially sick. Throat has hurt for two days and coughing is painful. Now drinking tea hoping it will fix something

@musicfairy15 if I hadn't been ignoring the phone, yes.
@musicfairy15 I always do
@musicfairy15 I died on altar and I feel like I am going nowhere with my jewelry
One of the worst feelings I Think is seeing something you have worked on be destroyed in the blink of an eye
Watching the Big Bang theory reminds me how socially inept and inexperienced I am
@ThePatK LOL, I wish I was that creative. But no
When what you want to hear is that everything will be OK, but you know the world does not work that way.
@RachelN92 although if it is a higher level class, I may need to.
@RachelN92 I am not sure. I took AP stats, which means I get college Credit for an intro stats course.
@RachelN92 definitely takes math to a whole new level
@RachelN92 given my lack of stats exposure compared to other students not terribly
@RachelN92 i was like that with geometry. I've forgotten a lot of specific things

@RachelN92 partially
@RachelN92 it's about who can follow directions and procedures
@RachelN92 they aren't capitalizing on natural potential
@RachelN92 algebra and I are friends. Geometry not so much
I can take comfort in that and not be angry at a lack of recognition. That's progress
The book I'm reading makes me think I was mathematically gifted when I was little.
@RachelN92 yes, although I lean more towards the center of the spectrum, if that all possible

@CrazyKaiti but people don't see how she presents herself the way they want her too. And she is not consistent.
@CrazyKaiti I have heard some people say she handled the hearings well. Not sure if that's actually true or not.
@CrazyKaiti not saying that's bad, but a lot of people don't like extremes
@CrazyKaiti I kind of think just because he has a lot more extreme ideas in a lot of cases.
@CrazyKaiti Hillery talking just makes me want to take a clay scoring tool and scrape it down my spine

@RachelN92 Its basically a compellation of things showing how many songs now are written in four cords. By Access of Awesome I think
@RachelN92 I think part of it may have been that I spent all of my time traveling and visiting friends and not going to class in the dream
@RachelN92 Lol actually not, planning to stay in Ohio but was still disappointed nonetheless
@RachelN92 to what you mentioned with the health thing in a way
@RachelN92 I'm interested how and why people think the way they do. Also have been experimenting a little with meditation so that's similar
@RachelN92 LOL I also like learning new things and am interested in womens issues/feminism, American History, and psychology.
@RachelN92 I'm taking a creative writing class next semester, so I'm excited about that
@RachelN92 Mainly just letters/documents expressing how I feel. I do blog ocasionally, and would love to write stories and poems
@RachelN92 not sure about that.
@RachelN92 At least a dozen, mostly online things. I did get INFP on an official paper test, but my f/t were on the line. So I'm honestly
@RachelN92 lol have you heard of the 4 cord song? It illustrates that point
@RachelN92 writing and reading mainly. You?
@RachelN92 I've gotten it on at least 3 tests
@RachelN92 both of those are pretty high
@RachelN92 any specific part of music?
I just frantically searched through my purse looking for something and found it while retrieving my phone. Go figure
No exit = another thing I wasn't a fan of

@RachelN92 I fluctuate between INFJ and INTP
@RachelN92 I agree on crocheting. I like it for traveling when I can listen to music and do that and just sort of turn off my mind
@RachelN92 Yes. The highest f I've ever had was 12% above the t/f designation
@RachelN92 what sorts of things did you do?
@RachelN92 LOL, I see it as a form of self expression. Also lets me feel cool and mathematical by designing things
@RachelN92 Definitely. I'm close to an INTJ and I feel that we compliment each other rather well. Also the intuitive connection is amazing
