@AnnCoulter You must be ebullient.  Finally you are relevant in that you influencing a Soviet terrorist, in our own Government, to instigate divisiveness and hate. Good job.
@realDonaldTrump What's been happening at the border? Are you talking about the concentration camps for kids that you built with FEMA &amp; CG funds? You're right...that's criminal.
@realDonaldTrump You have...longest shut down in history, the most indicted, total irresponsible environmental policies, favoring 1% of the population and mega corporations over the people that got you elected to their detriment, Border concentration camps for kids, stolen election...and hate.
@VP Resign
@senatemajldr Resign.
Comrade Trump, Resign.
@RuthHHopkins Unbelievable
@realDonaldTrump Ok. No one believes this. Most citizens believe that Comrade Trump wants to hurt people. What the people wish is that Comrade Trump would resign along with closeted Pense. We do not wish to see your treason trial and....
@co_rapunzel4 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, well it worked for Fred Flintstone to keep the dinosaurs out. LOL
@JohnCornyn I would believe that were it anywhere but Texas. Nice job Comrade Cornyn. You tweets identify your loyaltie.
@tribelaw I predict it will be "Madame President"
@SenJohnBarrasso @POTUS Of course Donald Trump will compromise. If you ever worked in finance in Manhattan, you would know that @realDonaldTrump is one of the the WORST negotiators on the planet. If he negotiates with Lil' Kim...we will all be eating Kim chi.
@HyapatiaLee Even more unhinged as his personal skinwalker (Meuller) inches closer and closer. I suspect soiled underwear after he saw Stone being hooked up and arrested this morning.
@abbydphillip How about an it be anything other than a circus? The Perez is nothing but a Carnival Barker and his cabinet, side show performers.
@realDonaldTrump Comrade Trump, regardless of what Stone says, he will roll on you.
@tedlieu @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Sure she can. This administration and Comrade Trump invented alternative facts....

@realDonaldTrump Does that mean that if we build the wall......you'll resign, Comrade Trump?
Comrade Trump @realDonaldTrump, if allowed to win this ridiculous Border Wall pissing match, will weaponize &amp; use government shutdowns if he does not get his way.  His minion @senatemajldr will enable him.  @SpeakerPelosi do not budge! We are NOT a Dictatorship. https://t.co/QDbSLINe8d
@Darla_Crane The terrorist in chief, that is what Donald is, will not be happy until he creates a civil war. Ultimate wet dream for Putin.
@realDonaldTrump Comrade Trump, you are mistaken, as are all of the other politicians. Diplomacy took out the Berlin wall and ended the morally bankrupt Soviet Union. Diplomacy and shared commitment with Mexico would stop boarder problems.
@realDonaldTrump Comrade Trump, you mistakenly said "pray". I am sure you ment "pay"...as in the American people should pay for the monument to yourself. (And dont forget the $$ you will make by using your own subcontractors.)

@VP Comrade Pence, we are curious....is it dark in that closet?,
@realDonaldTrump More transparent lies, Comrade Trump.
@realDonaldTrump GOP originally funded the dossier. Everyone knows that.  Comrade Trump, your lies and attempts at spy craft are infantile.
@SpeakerPelosi For all to see:  Speaker Pelosi, @realDonaldTrump will weaponize government shutdowns every year to get whatever chaos engendering agenda his master (Putin) wishes him to bring forth to create civil unrest and division.  DO NOT BUDGE.  NO NEGOTIATIONS until open.
@realDonaldTrump Comrade Trump, the first rule of spycraft is make your lies believable. You, Sanders, Giuliani, et. Al. Are not believable.
@senatemajldr @POTUS If you allow Donald a win on this, he will weaponize a shutdown each and every year. There can be no negotiating until the government is open for business.

@realDonaldTrump Walls are NOT successful.  Ask your one of your communist friends.  The great wall of China...failed, the Berlin Wall...failed, the wall around Troy...failed.  Donald Trump succeeded in stealing the 2016 election with help from Russia Cyber Warfare units and was found out.
@realDonaldTrump NATO????? You want to exit NATO? Donald, some criminals have an unconscious desire to get caught. Is that what you are doing here, trying to be apprehended as a Russian Spy? Nothing says "I'm a Russian Spy" like pulling out of NATO.
@realDonaldTrump first, I was unaware that, besides the Kremlin, are owned by @AnnCoulter. You do realize she is a satirist, right? An entertainer of sorts? Your shut down is tanking the economy. You ARE the national security threat.

@realDonaldTrump I thought you said that you defeated ISIS a few weeks ago.  Let me guess...another lie used to facilitate your Kremlin master's agenda?
@realDonaldTrump You are not fighting for the citizens of the United States. You are fighting to further Putin's world dominance wet dream.
@realDonaldTrump We are not some second rate communist country, buster. We do not militarize our boarders. We do not set up concentration gulags. Those are things that your Kremlin bosses do. This is the United States of America, Comrade Trump.
@SenateGOP Who cares? It is still a stupid idea.
@realDonaldTrump it's been 23 days since the shut down began.  So far, all in all, you are just another prick with no wall.

I keep seeing this copied screed on social media stating the "never before has a President been so scrutinized.." My response is that never has a President needed to be so scrutinized. Donald Trump is a Russian asset.
@realDonaldTrump BTW- Russian State TV is broadcasting their ecstatic approval of your Govt. Shutdown.  They say that it is the best thing you have done for them.  You loyal followers should watch RTV.  You are a bigger star than you ever were on the Apprentice.  They constantly they own you.

@mnolan49 @ddale8 @CaseyHinds Marshmellows.
@KassandraSeven It's about enacting Emergency Powers, or as we used to call it...Marshal law.
@realDonaldTrump And when it doesn't? Putin's plan is marshal law declared and you stage a coup. You dont care as bout a wall. Your 1000's of terrorists crossing the boarder...more fake news from the fake President.
@lmorganlord @StevenBeschloss Putin's puppet president wants to enact  emergency powers, which used to be called Marshal law.  Anybody think that Donald Trump will stop after building a wall?  With Marshal law in place, there will be no stopping him.
@AOC To you too!
@SenBooker @BobMenendezNJ @FrankPallone do most people realize that "Emergency Powers" used to be called "Marshal Law"?  These are dangerous days.  If Trump exercises emergency powers of the presidency, it is my opinion that he will not stop at merely building a wall.  Thoughts?
For those that do not understand:  "Emergency Powers" used to be known as "Marshall Law".  The question is do you you trust @realDonaldTrump to declare Marshall law and expect him not to sieze power?  Dangerous days, fellow citizens.
@JohnCornyn @politico While I will freely admit that I do not like you, I must ask an honest question:  "Do you trust Donald Trump to declare Marshal Law (ie., emergency powers) for a supposed wall?  Can you seriously believe that is where he will stop?
@realDonaldTrump "Comrade Trump".  Selling out to Russia will be your legacy.  All you want is to declare Marshal Law (oops, now they call it a state of national emergency) so that you can rule as a vassel to your master Vladimir Putin.
@realDonaldTrump So...….what is the plan?  After they met with you in 2017, drug prices skyrocketed.
@BillKristol @Nitemists I am amazed that nobody, regardless of party affiliation, seems upset that our President and administration, members of the House &amp; Senate are corrupted by Russia and continue to vote for policies that destroy the very fabric of our values.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, I am a tax payer. My name is not Mexico. I will not pay for your wall. I expect my representation to send that message to you in spades.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes FYI, your seditious behavior, and alignment with Russia has 2/3 of the country harboring anti-trump/anti-Communist sentiments.  So this should be no surprise.

@realDonaldTrump Pathetic
@OutFrontCNN I love watching Erin Burnett.  I must ask, why have Steve Moore and Santorum on the show? They contribute only Trumpist blather and vitriol.
@MalcolmNance @Plot2Destroy Wouldn't Metanarrative Framing infer a certain degree of what Hollywood would call "brainwashing"?  I never thought of Trump in such terms. My conclusion of his actions is more of a traitor for pay than a coerced asset.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Thanks.
@Martina Just think, we may have to call that snake President when Trump goes down.
@SarahPalinUSA Oh, Mrs. Palin..why, I forgot you were still there.

@TheRynheart @senatemajldr Ryn, it amazes me that McConnell is willing to leave himself so exposed.  He is litterally branding himself with the hammer and sickle.  That is the problem with people that get away with their crimes for so long. They tend to believe that they are untouchable.
@CharismaMolotov @realDonaldTrump Nah...that is the face of a Soviet era spy.  Donald does not get credit for being the face of evil.  He's just a spy married to his handler.

@TeaPainUSA That is exactly what it is.  @realDonaldTrump will act as if he is reluctant at first, but will cave to save Whelan's life, yadda, yadda, yadda.  The dark money from Russia would expose GOP in every branch of government.
@MalcolmNance @PoxNewsCEO Ditto!  I can think of no branch of the service wherein one does not have the possibility of injury from bullets, bombs, etc..  I am beginning to look at a third of the US as Soviet Sympathizers.
As predicted, Russia scooped up Paul Whelan and is holding him on suspicion of espionage.  Now, Trump &amp; Putin will exchange spies.  Butina for Whelan.  @realDonaldTrump will jump at the opportunity to get her away from investigators.  She will get a parade in Moscow.

@realDonaldTrump Again, more lies. Democrats do not want open borders.  This is more fear mongering soviet propaganda.  Stop the lies.  If you are unable, then resign.
@Moecasonbbq NICE!  Gotta get me one!
@realDonaldTrump The lies must stop before you create a civil war.  You are fabricating this issue.  Democrats do not want open borders and "large scale crime &amp; disease".  All of these fabrications are but soviet propaganda.
@realDonaldTrump And let me guess....it will be able to be seen from space and will have giant gold letters spelling TRUMP at various intervals.  This is stupid.  We have technology that can handle the problem.  If we have drones that can identify a person, than we can have drones for the border.

@Marina_Sirtis I think this is the most dangerous time for us.  Our would be Musolini is desperate, and his kind usually attempts to make a stand of some sort.  The preferable thing for him to do is to run and seek asylum in Russia.  (Though...Putin appears done with him.)
@MalcolmNance My concern is that the would be Mussolini is going to make a move of desperation and people will get killed.  His kind always makes a last ditch effort rather than go down.  Or...and this is preferable, he will run.

Good morning, @HyapatiaLee.  I am working on a project that made me think of you!  Hope you are well.
Thinking of writing a new book...."Purchasing Donald". The story of how Vladimir Putin bought Donald Trump on the discount rack.
@tribelaw I keep hearing people asking "What do the Russians have on Trump?"  I do not believe that they have anything on him.  I do, however, believe that Putin purchased Trump.  It is all about making him a legitimate billionaire.  Not dirty pictures, or other crimes.  Just about monney.
@RudyGiuliani There is no collusion.  Putin just purchased Trump.  Trump purchased you.  See how that works?
@realDonaldTrump I am amazed at the shortsightedness of the news media.  They speak of leveraged collusion.  Thinking that Putin has something on you and that is why you are such a threat to national security.  This always makes me smile.  There is no leverage.  Putin just paid you.  Avarice.
@politico I am sure that the AG of the southern district of NY will welcome him....open prison doors for him, even.

Ok, @realDonaldTrump, let's fix US manufacturing.  Instead of tariffs against China, use tariffs against US companies  manufacturing in China. Make it not profitable. Conversely, offer a tax break for those coming back to the US.
@realDonaldTrump Good thought. However, your tax bill taxes business in the US 21%. If they manufacture overseas, you tax them at 10%. The fact that you dont know this is why you consistently bankrupt your businesses. Dont tell me.....you went with your gut on the tax bill.

@TheRynheart @TGowdySC It's all theater.  The bottom line is that they, all of the Trump defenders, are in it for the money.

@Marina_Sirtis Good for you, Marina.  It's called patriotism.
@Acosta @GrnEyedMandy It is all about money. Donald doesn't think in terms of duty to the country, he thinks in terms of what's in it for me, how much can I make.  Wanna drive him crazy?  Tell him there is a shiny quarter in the corner of the OVAL office, and watch him search like a maniac.
@perlmutations It's all about money to him.  Not patriotism or the willingness to serve his country.  Just how much he can get out of this.

@realDonaldTrump ":When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?"  Just like every other election throughout the history of the United States...when ALL of the votes are counted.  This is not the United States of Trump.  We have rules.
If Russian activity was a military action, then it stands to reason that it was an act of war. Thus, Trumps "activities" under the direction of Putin can be construed as treason.
Russian govt responded to DNC's hacking lawsuit, saying if it did hack the DNC, it was a military activity exempt from prosecution. If Russian activity was a military action, then it stands to reason that it was an act of war. https://t.co/sTlPjbTZI7

@maggieNYT IMO, we should give Trump no air time.  The facts should be read, the lies annotated but no footage, no interviews.  Air time is akin to feeding the monster.
@realDonaldTrump Certainly to our Democracy.  In this country, the rule has ALWAYS been that if you suspect something has gone afoul we investigate it, LEGALLY.  In Russia, they just sweep it under the rug after they "disappear" everyone involved.

@AnnCoulter You comment on how armed citizens at the boarderline bar could have prey the mass shooting; again, I have to ask...were you ever in a firefight, Ms. Coulter?
A pundit talked about how lives would have been saved if patrons had been armed. Spoken like someone that has never been in a firefight.  If you have been unfortunate enough to have been in combat, you know exactly what I mean.
@AnnCoulter I asked before. Maybe you missed it. Regarding your comment on had there been  armed citizens at Boarderline: "Have you ever been in a firefight?"
Whittaker is a distraction. Trump lawyers will attack the validity of Mueller's investigation in supreme court while we watch the spectacle of AG Whittaker.    It's the reason for Kavanaugh.

There is an outcry from right wing radicals/Tea Party people.  Claiming that Trump is contantly attacked and unfairly treated by the press, the left, normal Republicans, etc.  Take a hard look at his super destructive &amp; divisive actions.  This "unfair treatment" is Patriotism.

@realDonaldTrump we all have turnover in business.  It is a given.  You have always had the most amazing turnover @ Trump Org.  Now, as President, you've been through about 392 staff members in less than 2 years.  I believe that to be a record, even for you.

@realDonaldTrump talks about fake news and says that the free press is the enemy of the people. I find Fake Christians much more dangerous.  Evangelical leader: Going after Saudi Arabia for journalist's disappearance not worth risking "$100 billion worth of arms sales"

@JeffFlake Maybe they will keep him.

@realDonaldTrump Don't forget the children's concentration camps that you are building along the border with funds diverted from FEMA and the CG.  That's important too.
@realDonaldTrump I'm confused, Buddy.  Didn't you refer to Cruz as "Lying Ted"?  Didn't you tell us his father killed JFK?  And didn't you slam his wife and then mocked him for doing nothing about it?  Sounds like @SenTedCruz is a really pathetic weak character according to you.  Why the support?

I keep hearing the Tea Party set screaming about "Innocent untill proven guilty", regarding Kavanaugh's confirmation.  New flash:  This is not a court of law.  This is a JOB INTERVIEW.  Jobs are awarded to the best candidate.  Even a hint of sexual misconduct should end process.

As a shareholder, I suggest that, if you wish to remain in your position, you fix the optics that lead to this deserved ridicule.  America, not your rally crowds, but America, is furious.  Keep it up and..."You're fired."
@realDonaldTrump you often have said that the "whole world is laughing at the US".  Your appearance at the UN yesterday proves that "the whole world is laughing at Donald Trump" and his Self aggrandizement.  Taxpayers are like shareholders in Govt.
@Darla_Crane They are the "Enemy of the People".....
@realDonaldTrump Oh, absolutely, Donald.  I am about to vote for a different party than I have in my entire adult life.  And I hate it.  Thanks a lot.
@AnnCoulter Ok...have to admit you made me laugh.
@Darla_Crane "Get up, Stand Up",
@maggieNYT Which "good man" would that be?  In the current administration it is exceptionally difficult to find one.
@MalcolmNance When the story broke, I remarked that it smells of a Trump "leak" to me and it was done in order to set up Rosenstein to quash the Treason Investigation.  So, yeah..great minds think alike.  Starting to feel boxed in by the bad guys....
@Darla_Crane I wholeheartedly believe that for the majority of politicians, it is all about WIFM and nothing else.....
@Darla_Crane I postulated (in '16) that we had a dearth of decent candidates (any party) and that I was considering voting for the stoned guy for president. I became an instant hit. (as put on the Twitter hit list).
@glenn87027633 @VP is a creep &amp; weirdo.
@TimOBrien @MalcolmNance No, actually I dont wonder. Its money. Lots of money. I believe that @LindseyGrahamSC is bought and paid for. More than likely by the same kindly folk that own @realDonaldTrump.
@SRuhle @TheOnion Pardon my NYC.....BUT WTF?????
@PhilMurphyNJ hey, is this true? https://t.co/SZMUk0vSNR
So, @realDonaldTrump, I am curious. Howcome you always seem to take the side of the sexual predator? (Ie., Rapey Roy Moore, now Kavanaugh.) What exactly is wrong with you, anyway? Do you want a civil war?? Crazy.
@GOP @SenateGOP I am curious...do you now represent ANY of your constituents...or just yourselves?
@Wolfiesmom @goldengateblond @GOP Right with you on that.
@AnnCoulter I'm a Republican. Dont YOU mean "we're not voting tea party....."
It is my suspicion that, when investigated, the sources for the Rosenstein story in the NY Times will turn out to be agents of @realDonaldTrump.  (He has done this b4) The goal is to create a reason to fire Rosenstein and to have, of course, plausable deniability.
RT @RBReich: In order to pay for detaining migrant kids, the Trump admin. plans to divert funds from: 	--Cancer research	--Women’s shelters…
@MalcolmNance @Edwrd666 Vlad will not be happy until his vassel "leads" us to civil war.
@renato_mariotti You have to ask if Carson has lost his mind?  Think pyramids were grain silos....
@realDonaldTrump Just a thought...you probably should stay away from the word "radical".  As the face of the dangerous radical tea party fake republican party, you embody radicalization.
@Darla_Crane Having a good day?
"Constitutional Crisis". This is all we hear lately. People need to understand that the Government of the United States has been infiltrated by assets of the Russian Federation. This is more than. Constitutional crisis.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @nytimes More like beware anything coming from Donald's mouth.
@realDonaldTrump You mean like John McCain? Oh wait...
@realDonaldTrump Breaking: "Trump admin moves $260M from cancer research, HIV/AIDS and other programs to cover custody of immigrant children costs."  I believe, at this juncture, that you actually like causing pain and suffering. https://t.co/sDRR3cNqx6
@realDonaldTrump Let's put aside that allegation only for a moment.  How about FOX's story that Kavanaugh belonged to a group of Yale Students called "Tits &amp; Clits" where their motto was: "No Means Yes, and Yes Means Anal".  This guy should no more be a Supreme Court Justrice than U b President.

@realDonaldTrump Extra crispy today, huh?  Yours is an historic level of fabrications, even for politics.  You are epic.
@SenTedCruz You actually said, on record, that if O'Rourke wins, he will ban BBQ in the state of Texas?  Congrats! You just proved @realDonaldTrump correct when he referred to you as "Lying Ted Cruz".  Unbelievable. SMH

@ChrisCuomo In the 30 yrs that I have known/done business with him, I have found him to be one of the laziest S.OB.s I have ever met. FOX is easy, Briefings are hard...you may have to answer a question.
@realDonaldTrump "The Recovery got started on Election Day 2016" Laughing my ass off, Donald!  You will just spew anything that will get you air time, even if you know that that air time will be negative.  It's all theater and the fight for ratings and relevance....
@thetracilords I am, but rarely. I have friends that live on FB and is their preferred method of contact.  I really don't like FB.  The amount of venom and pure hateful screed is mind numbing.
@mkraju Unless Kavanaugh dragged the victim across state lines, it would be the jurisdiction of the LLEOs.
Folks, think of Congress &amp; the Senate as your refrigerator. Some times things get overlooked and hang around well past their expiration. When they do, we need to throw them out. Vote for a new wave, a saner wave in November.
@soledadobrien @Tracy330507 I'll take that: yes, when those actions are predatory and the rate of recidivism is so high in sex crimes.
@realDonaldTrump "Because of their loyalty to me." You always have to inject yourself into everything. China is. Communist nation that is bent on our destruction...like Russia and NK.

@realDonaldTrump you actually told your Tea Party crowd that it was their fault if you get impeached?  Nice.  If you don't get impeached (unlikely) then it is a victory lap.  If you do get impeached (Likely, but imprisoned even more likely) then you have deflected the culpability

@realDonaldTrump Would you mind exlaining the purpose of these rallies?   Presidential election is 2 years away, you have "rallied" from day one of your term.  So, I am thinking this is not part of a re-election campaign.  Are these rehashing of 2016 rallies victory lapses?  Confused.
@StormyDaniels Tear'em up!
@PiperPerabo Done!  Thanks for standing up!
@realDonaldTrump Donald, if the story/book is "made up" and was done so to damage your image/position with malice, as your statement alleges, then you have a case.  File suit.  By doing so, you can prove that you are who you say you are.  Or, you crash and burn if you lose.
@realDonaldTrump 1. Only 1/3 of the country believes that.	2. The other 2/3 think you are a Russian spy.

Federalis: a supporter of a strong federal government; especially : a supporter of the U.S. Constitution.  This is why I clash with Trump &amp; his supporters (Tea Partiers) in the fabulous 21st century.  Donald and his ilk were engendered by the Kochs when they created the Tea Party
First, I am not a fan of @realDonaldTrump for personal reasons that span 30 years.  However, I do not wish to see the country fail with him.  I also learned that I am neither a Democrat, nor still a Republican (as the days of the Eisenhower Republicans is over) I am a Federalist.
@realDonaldTrump For this, I believe you deserve a standing ovation.  Same for the thank you letter to "Little Kim".  Good job, Donald.  (Can we do the same with Vietnam MIA/POW?)
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett The "Real Story" is that you and your cabinet members are a threat to our democracy, liberty and our health and well being.  You are owned by the Russian Federation.  You should just confess.  In the end it will go easier if you do.

@TomSteyer 1500 children have been "misplaced". There is evidence that some have been sold
@ezraklein @JoyAnnReid Ratings
@IvankaTrump @POTUS It was his idea to kidnap refugee children in the first place. Refugees turned into illegal aliens because the bridge leading to the site where they declare their political status is closed.
Anyone else wondering how much Donald is making off of the kidnapping of refugee children. There must be a monetary angle for him.
@HyapatiaLee My 2 cents: in Jules Vern's book 20000 leagues under the sea, Nemo had a motto on painted on the sub. It read Mobilus en Mobile.  A lot of folk dont understand that we grow by constantly moving. The past is past.

@realDonaldTrump Harder than it looked, huh?   To quote...well, you: "From here, it will only get worse."  I take no delight in your failure, please know that , Donald.  But, all of this was inevitable.

@RealLucyLawless @GreenpeaceNZ Wish I could go with you!
@BeautyBind Clearly they are not the enemy of Republicans in office.  They own the Republicans in office.
@realDonaldTrump "The House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion..."  The House Intelligence Committee has concluded thus beccause they are bought and paid for.  You can't possibly believe that Putin strated the attack on our government with you!  Others have come before.
@realDonaldTrump McCabe is a trained investigator with 24 years of interrogation skills.  I doubt the man needs a pad and pencil.  You don't believe there are memos....I don't believe you are innocent, not one bit.
@realDonaldTrump Why can't you:	A: Tell the Truth?	B. Ever get the facts straight without spin?	C. Go to a country without extradition to escape the penalty for presidential treason?

@TheRynheart That may be so, but his status as a Wall Street trader and not an economist certainly should.
@jessphoenix2018 My concern is his blatant attempt at consolidating power.  You, Jess, need to win the seat.
@realDonaldTrump And, BTW, gloating is infantile, what are you? A 10 year old?
@realDonaldTrump Working on Wall Street in the 1980's, I have seen a lot of shitty moves.  But Donald, you take the cake.  You beef a guy a few days from retirement and screw him out of his pension.  Congratulations, you are a bigger jerk than I EVER was.  Your consolidation of power will fail.

@BetoORourke @BarbaraNavarro Additionally, technology can more efficiently and with less cost to taxpayers accomplish the goal.  A case in point, the US DEA &amp; Coast Guard created EYE IN THE SKY in the Florida keys to curtail drug smugglers in the 80's &amp; 90's.  That was successful with 30 year old tech!!! https://t.co/ueLa9vYoM3
Bye, Nikki
Consolidation of power is the first step. This is accomplished by those that won't play by the "rules" and dissent.
@EdKrassen Frankly, in the scheme of things...I thing I would prefer "Snowflake" to "Dangerous Right Wing Radical".
@christinawilkie " Sarah Sanders is reading a letter from a 10 year old at the WH lectern."  You mean @realDonaldTrump actually wrote a letter by himself???????  Good job!
@indyfromspace @IronStache I am a betting man, and I have cash (@ PaddyPower) on Randy Bryce to unseat Ayn Rand.  I mean Paul Ryan. (It's gotten so that I can tell Ryan and Rand apart anymore.)

@AnnCoulter You should run in 2020, Ann.
OK...who is @TomiLahren and why is she relevant?   I keep seeing these memes that indicate she is famous for something, but I have no idea who this is, or why I should care. Is she like a Kardashian or something? No joke, I have no clue.   Anyone?
