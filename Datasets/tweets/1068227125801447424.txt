@bov_chris @GwynFuxa @Super_Nebular @RepAdamSchiff @bullfish777 China is way ahead of the USA and has developements on ALL continents while we exhaust our money in wars all over the globe. They will surpass us in no time, especially with this One Man Wrecking Crew!
@RepMarkMeadows Proceed with a Criminal Investigation into Trump‚Äôs Federal Taxes! Are you frightened he may turn on you? Grow A Spine!

Farmers are propped up by billions of US aid.
