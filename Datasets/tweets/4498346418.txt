@conchbar17 @TomFitton @drawandstrike @realDonaldTrump Exactly. NO Pardon. He needs to take this all the way and prove Mueller's corruption in manufacturing evidence. This is also why Mueller is putting off sentencing so it allows him more time to find dirt on Trump and indict him before he's exposed on the Flynn or Manafort cases.
@gg0U812 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Status hearing my ass... Since when does somebody get convicted and then have a delayed sentence over and over? Never. Mueller is scared and trying to wash this under the rug because he's caught with his hands in the cookie jar.

@MidnightKoi @TrumpsDC @Boyd_2650 That's not the point. The girls have their own Scouts. My boy hangs out with girls all the time. This was his guys-only time to get away from his sisters.
