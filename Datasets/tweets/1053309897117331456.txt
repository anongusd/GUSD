@AbramoMatt @BrianKolfage Amen!
@Nikki198705 @BrianKolfage @NFL I was referring to the NFL team owner caught in the Florida human trafficking case (Robert Kraft of the Patriots). He solicited prostitution from enslaved women in the US, in the same way others did without his same social clout.
@geodestruction Nailed it!!!
@sunshinedawn10 @BrianKolfage Absolutely! Where's the #MeToo movement when it comes to this?!
'Human trafficking is the business of stealing someone's freedom for profit.' Victims are lured in with promises of a better life. Whether you're an NFL team owner, or just a truck stop opportunist, you're aiding and abetting modern day slavery and we NEED stronger laws NOW.
