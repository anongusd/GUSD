@EliotACohen It means you are progressive. Unless you are a conservative and another conservative calls you woke. Then it means you believe in conspiracy theories.
(5/5)He probably expanded the probe to find out, knowing the report will come to him first, and against the advice of McGahn and Grassley.
(4/5) Expanding the probe does nothing to help Kavanaugh's confirmation odds. It's obvious from his words and actions he doesn't care about sexual assault. He does care about alcoholism.
(3/5)Trump is a well known to not drink and have like respect for alcoholics. This is basic background knowledge, but he has never drank, after seeing the destruction alcoholism brought to his brother, Fred Jr.
(2/5)Trump had alcohol on his mind. He mentioned alcohol twice today, once joking how bad of a drunk he would be if he drank, and again when he said Kavanaugh admitted under oath to having a "problem with drink" as a youth. Kavanaugh didn't say this, but this was Trump's takeaway
(1/5)Trump appears to have lost faith in Kavanaugh. It is likely he expanded the FBI probe in response to reports that Kavanaugh being an alcoholic. The theory below:
@zippyhorsemom Exactly. Which is a pretty hard wired emotional response, but a poor legal and PR choice. So yeah, he's scared.
But unless Mark Judge is stark raving mad, if he corroborates anything, Kavanaugh is sunk anyway, so why disparage Judge? I don't think this was his rehearsed answer about Judge, I think he went off script. His answer indicates fear.
He is acting emotionally. He obviously is derply frightened by him. If he were truly on trial, and not a job interview in form of a trial, disparaging a potential future witness makes a lot of sense. It could serve to undercut their credibility
Anyone notice how when Kavanaugh was asked about his relationship with Mark Judge, he took time to disparage the guy? Literally the first thing he says it's the guy is an alcoholic. Then he mentions he had cancer, as if it is relevant. What's that about?

@independentnonb I really don't know where those facts come from. It is a Reddit post. Martin Shkreli could have written it himself.
@independentnonb A claim is a request basically. You fill out all a form about you financial and medical information. You would send this to the pharm company in this case if you are seeking free medication. They can deny you as they please for any reason.
@independentnonb And I really don't think everyone got it for free. If I remember right, they added that as a public relations thing after the fact when the whole thing exploded
@independentnonb And let's just say all the money goes into research. There are a lot more ethical ways of generating capital than denying medication to the needy.
@independentnonb Who said all money goes into research? And most legitimate pharm companies don't price gauge like that. And if you can find examples if them doing so, I equally condemn that behavior.
@independentnonb Besides, at $750 a pill, you'd have to drop probably a few grand before they get the claim through. That's assuming they don't deny for some nonsense and let you die for a pill that used to cost $12
@independentnonb I'm sure the drug company had a program. I doubt "everyone" who couldn't afford it had it covered. He raised it to $750 a pill. Maybe the very need got it, but I bet a lot of middle class people got squeezed.
@independentnonb Yeah both claims are specious. That's what Martin Shkreli says. In terms of research, yeah the profits go back into the company and a portion of which is then used for R&amp;D. But it's not really like a direct relationship.
@independentnonb In terms of getting it for free, pharm companies always got these programs. Got to qualify. Got to provide info. Got to wait. Meanwhile the pharmacy is telling you the pills are $5k a month.
@independentnonb In terms if the drug, an anti-parasitic mostly for AIDS patients, you are right he was probably legally allowed to do this, he owned it. But legal and and ethical are different things.
@independentnonb The joke was taken seriously enough that a judge revoked his bail because of it. Speaking of which, he is also a convicted felon for securities fraud.

The NRA is scary. Lots of coded phrases with her here. They are now involved in a full culture war. Listen to how Dana Loesch attacks the media, attacks Black Lives Matter. These are issues unrelated to the second amendment, and chilling that they would be weighing in. https://t.co/IzS2SpqtMU
@JoyAnnReid Who is named Mercedes Schlapp? All these names are so Dickensian.
@RepDonBeyer @LarsB6one Is this somehow illegal?
@Lee_in_Iowa And if you read the article, the manufacturer of the gun is, in fact, being sued.
@Lee_in_Iowa The law indemnifying gun owners from lawsuits that Bernie supported, would not apply here. Gun malfunction isn't covered by the law, just use.
@realDonaldTrump You are the President of the United States. Act like it. Why are you criticizing actors? Be mature and professional.
Let's be honest -Trump would never get security clearance if he wasn't President.

@DICKS good work!
Mueller is investigating #Trump business dealings in #Russia, especially as it relates to his decision to run for President. In other words, #Mueller is investigating whether the President is comprised. Whether Trump is a Russian asset. Let that sink in. #TrumpRussia #Kompromat

@realDonaldTrump Did Gates flip on you?
Update - I'm now convinced it is Gates. I think we all knew someone flipped once he Twitterspazzed like that.
@Timmacdawg You might be right! Something is brewing.

@tinfoilhatmedia Perhaps more importantly, could Trump shield Manafort from a state prosecution? Pardon powers only apply to federal charges. Schneiderman and Vance are also pursuing the Manafort case in NY. Mueller can make sure those potential charges disappear. Trump cannot.

#Drudge headline that #Trump formally launching re-election campaign more than a distraction. It signals his propaganda strategy. The #Trump2020 campaign will be another moving political head in the Trump Hydra. One additional layer.

@yashar Re-Appoint Dan Elwell as FAA commissioner. Zero commercial airline crashes in 2017. He seems to be doing a great job already.
Just got blocked by @glenweyl for calling him out about his support of slavery. @politico @POLITICOMag
@groth_dave How so? No gun seizures under this plan. It is a phase out with well incentived buy back. Gun seizures are most likely to lead to violence from gun owners.
@counterchekist Stop the false indignation. The Sanders campaign shared the information with Hillary. It is only disputed who ordered that.
Ban assault rifle sales. 1.5x value buyback scheme nationwide structured as a permanent fund. Remaining assault rifles to be registered to an owner. No transferability upon death - the gun would then be destroyed. Unregistered assault rifle = federal felony. #GunControlNow
@NathanLerner The problem is that's what exactly happened in 2016, and we got Trump.
Listen to the dog whistle - "The elites don't care... about school safety or - school children." 		He is whistling to the dark right wing. He is talking about Pizzagate stuff. The pause for effect, then he adds the phrase "school children". It's intentional.  #WayneLaPierre #NRA https://t.co/aPQCWFqAYq

@realDonaldTrump Answer: You are being investigated for crimes you committed both as President, and prior to your presidency as a private citizen.
@Cernovich It also inspired impeachment because #TrumpColluded

@TheFive @JesseBWatters This dude still racist or nah?
@realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @FoxNews Maybe you forcibly kissed a woman, maybe you didn't. I don't know (although I do care). But we all know that #TrumpColluded
@Education4Libs @ChrisFagan57 Do you think that this factored into people voting for Trump? I've always blamed the Trump supporters themselves, but you make a great point - it might have had something to do with a bad upbringing.
#TrumpColluded - can we get #PenceIsComplicit trending next?

If it had trended that Obama colluded with Russia to rig the election during his presidency, he wouldn't have cared much because it wouldn't have been true. But it really, really bothers Trump because he knows it's true that #TrumpColluded.
@ananavarro I want to remind Trump that he has a country to govern and he shouldn't be apoplectic about Oprah... But then I think that maybe it is better for him not to be too involved with the running it the country ...
@Elastigirl2018 @Lady_Star_Gem @BonniBK A grifter is different than a traitor
@Lady_Star_Gem @BonniBK Other than that dinner photo, is there any evidence that she colluded with Russia?
@pacelattin @TomiLahren She is on the record as pro-choice. I'm no fan of  her, but it is not okay to be "outing" women for a decision that is her right to make. Especially when she hadn't made a hypocrite of herself on this issue.
@realDonaldTrump To suggest that somehow the investigation into your crimes  caused this terrible event on Florida is the lowest of the low. Shame on you.
@realDonaldTrump Dost thou protest too much?
@PeterIsztin @glenweyl Does the book try to justify slavery at all? Just wondering?

@suellentrop It is called confirmation bias. Step outside of it.
@POLITICOMag @ASME1963 So you guys just going to plod along and pretend that you don't have a huge article advocating for slavery?
@suellentrop Do you have poems for modern slaves?
@glenweyl @politico @suellentrop Even with the title change, the central premise - "Uber for immigration" is awful. Do you realize to what extent Uber drivers are exploited? Can you imagine how much worse this would be with a population of domestic workers?
@morganOPINES @pacelattin Nope you are wrong, Pace is right. Ashkanazi is an ethnicity, as is Sephardic, as are Mizrahim and many others. All of these ethnicities are predominantly Jewish by religion. The "look" you are referring to is probably Ashkenazi.
@laurenduca Much of America is faced the reality that thier parent's generation will be better off than thier own.This is especially true among the white working class in the south + rust belt.They don't feel privileged, they feel robbed of a perceived  birthright. Hatred and bigotry ensues.
