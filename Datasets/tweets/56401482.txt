Blaming one person for the thoughts and deeds of another is antithetical to conservatism. It is also wrong.That is why we continue to stand by our decision to invite Ms. Maréchal-Le Pen to speak at CPAC.
It seems that Le Pen's detractors have unfortunately chosen to hold a 28-year old granddaughter accountable for the views of her 90-year old grandfather.
Marion Maréchal-Le Pen has expressed her support for life, for private property rights, and for individual liberty. She also supports French sovereignty instead of submission to European domination, just like we support American sovereignty rather than bowing to the UN.
