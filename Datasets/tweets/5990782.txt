@AndrewCFollett That means 34K ballots in Broward could not be counted until AFTER the polls closed AND they were verified. 		Statewide there is an estimated 250K of these types of ballots. 		AND an unknown amount of overseas ballots that only have to be post-marked by election day.
@AndrewCFollett Dear overpaid moron --		Absentee ballots received after 5pm on Monday before the election &amp; on election day have to be verified one-by-one after the polls close. Provisional ballots must be verified as well in the same manner.
@AndrewCFollett Zzz... wake me up after the recount. 		Irregularities and issues happen ‚Äî people‚Äôs votes shouldn‚Äôt be disqualified due to errors not of their own making.

Well, look at that. Will @realDonaldTrump lead chants of LOCK HIM UP? https://t.co/RtO9wA7HEA
@realDonaldTrump So, don't let #TakeTheKnee &amp; the attack on Curry/Warriors be only about Trump. Focus is police brutality &amp; institutional inequality.
@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/DF6NP6Oscq
@realDonaldTrump Trump is upset because rich, talented &amp; famous men of color are resisting him and inequalities in his country and aren't afraid to speak up!
@realDonaldTrump He doesn't think it's a privilege for teams to come to the White House. He's barely there! He did all this tweeting from his golf course.
@realDonaldTrump That's why he attacked Curry and #Warriors because some players disagree with how he has treated disenfranchised people in this country.
@realDonaldTrump That's why his justice department is dismantling polices to address and improve policing in communities of color ‚Äî because he doesn't care.
@realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't care about the anthem or our flag he cares about white supremacy and wants to silence those who resist clear inequalities.
@realDonaldTrump The conversation again is framed as black man disrespects Flag, anthem, etc. when these men are using their agency to address inequality.
@realDonaldTrump Fast forward to Trump's Friday rally where he attacks #Kaepernick &amp; calls him a son of a bitch for addressing police brutality.
@realDonaldTrump But of course because @realDonaldTrump and others are lazy they framed their protest as something else. Ignoring again POLICE BRUTALITY.
@realDonaldTrump That's why #Kaepernick and other players kneeled during games. Period. It wasn't to show disrespect to America.
@realDonaldTrump This whole conservation should have always been about POLICE BRUTALITY and police interaction with black men.
