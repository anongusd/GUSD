@realDonaldTrump Greetings Sir.  I respect you so much for all you are doing to make this country better than ever.  I am a brain-cancer survivor as of 17 years on this upcoming President's day weekend.  Do you think you could give me phone call to pray with you for a bit? GBU
I am looking to gather   Christian/religious  followers.  If you read this tweet and you are a religious person, please follow me.  I'm your brother in Christ, and I need you in this darkest hour our world has ever known.  Thank you! :-)
There is only One Mediator between God and Man.  His name is Jesus Christ.  No one can enter the Kingdom of God through praying  to Mary, the "human" mother of Jesus Christ, nor through any of the saints.  The key heresy of the catholic church preaches  the unity of all religions
1 Timothy 2:5 indicates that there is only "one" way to heaven, and that way is only through Jesus Christ.  For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son to save you from your sins.  Please message me...
All of you who have not yet accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior please contact me, and I will walk you through the steps.

@Pontifex Let us unite as catholic Christians.  There are many gifts, but only one spirit.  WE ARE MANY PARTS BUT ALL ONE BODY.
@Pontifex We must pray unceasingly, so that we are protected from evil
God wills that whosoever believes upon the Lord Jesus Christ should not perish but shall have eternal life with Him.  Oh my Jesus forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell.  Lead all souls to heaven, especially those who are in most need of your mercy.  Say no to hell!
@Pontifex God gives all of us many chances to start over again by forgiving us as long as we repent of our iniquities and turn away from what is evil.  If we have truly repented of sin we will not allow it to thrive in our lives.  Reconciliation gives no one a license to sin.

@WannabeCatholic @TheAngelofWrath Good for you!  Would you like to become Catholic?
@RyanProng @WannabeCatholic To become a Catholic you must first want to be "Christian."  At the center of the Catholic faith is Christ resurrected!  This means that we must acknowledge our sins and the fact that we cannot gain entrance into heaven on our own.
@RyanProng @WannabeCatholic You are correct, however we must portray ourselves as "universal" Christians.  The Catholic church is the "first Christian church," the church of the apostles in the Bible

When Satan attacks us, we must rebuke him and continually cast him out of our homes.  Our Mother Mary advises us to pray the rosary and offer it up to destroy the enemy.  Many Catholics today do not bother with acknowledging the reality of hell, and remain as Sunday Christians.
