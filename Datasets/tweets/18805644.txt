.@jonathanvswan on Michael Cohen: I often see it stated as fact that Cohen knows where every body is buried, actually he doesn’t.  He knows where like maybe like 20 bodies are buried, but there’s probably, however many more. https://t.co/S7cyBuriaC
.@stevenmnuchin1 on Farm Aid: The focus is trade not aid...the President is not willing to live with the status quo where other counties have taken advantage of the rules and had free trade here and our companies and our workers can’t compete fairly. https://t.co/aNoKXiIKn9

.@stevenmnuchin1: We specifically talked about Soy Beans but we specifically agreed we'd look at these other markets and it was very clear that our objective as part of this whole agreement is the Europeans have to open up more opportunities for our farmers and our agriculture.
.@stevenmnuchin1 on Agriculture in discussions with EU: I was in the room and we had specific conversations about agriculture and the need to break down the barriers in agriculture and have more opportunities for our farmers.
.@stevenmnuchin1 on Tech stocks: I’m not concerned about this at all and again investors should have diversified portfolios, the tech stocks have obviously had an incredible run and you look at the NASDAQ...the S&amp;P...the DOW, the markets obviously doing very well. #FNS
.@stevenmnuchin1 on Fed increasing interest rates: I think it is and the market expects it, the Fed has been targeting 2% inflation and obviously with 2% inflation we have to have at least slightly higher interest rates to manage through that. #FNS
.@stevenmnuchin1 on #GDP : We can only project a couple of years in the future but I think were well on this path for several years so I don’t think this is a one or two year phenomenon, I think we definitely are in a period of 4 or 5 years of sustained 3% growth at least. #FNS

.@EmmanuelMacron on Russian President Putin: He’s strong and smart.  But don’t be naïve.  He’s obsessed by interferences in our democracies. That’s why I do believe that we should never be weak with President Putin.  When you are weak, he uses it.
.@EmmanuelMacron on Russian President Putin: I think he’s very strong man, he’s a strong president.  He wants a great Russia.  People are proud with his policy.  He is extremely tough with minorities and his opponents with an idea of democracy, which is not mine.

.@EmmanuelMacron: Third, I think we have a very strong personal relation-- based on the different meetings we had and especially visits such your President gave to my country for Bastille Day in 2017.  (3/3)
.@EmmanuelMacron: Second, I think we are very much in line on some very critical issues of this world—and especially counter terrorism and fight against ISIS. (2/3)
.@EmmanuelMacron on relationship w/ President Trump: We have a very special relationship because both of us are probably the maverick of the systems on both sides...President Trump’s election was unexpected in your country and probably my election was unexpected in my country.
French President @EmmanuelMacron on goals for his State visit to U.S.: My objective is to highlight a long-term history between our two countries, based on values.  We are very much attached to the same values -- and especially liberty and peace.

.@SenatorDurbin on firing of Andrew McCabe: Make no mistake Chris, it was in December that President Trump announced: we have 90 days to get McCabe before he retires.  He put out basically a hit on him.

.@TGowdySC on how President Trump has handled Russia and Vladimir Putin: I think he’s done a hell of a lot better job than President Obama…I hope he does more, but he did a hell of a lot more than his predecessor.
.@TGowdySC on Andrew McCabe: Oh Andy McCabe has undercut his credibility all by himself, he didn’t need any help doing that...It was the FBI who said he made an unauthorized disclosure and then lied about it.
.@TGowdySC on Trump’s lawyer calling for shutting down Mueller investigation: If you believe, as we found, there’s no evidence of collusion, you should want Special Counsel Mueller to take all the time and have all the independence he needs to do his job.
.@TGowdySC on Trump’s lawyer calling for shutting down Mueller investigation: I think the President’s lawyer does a disservice when he says that and frames the investigation that way…Russia attacked our country, let Special Counsel Mueller figure that out.

CIA Director Pompeo to @johnrobertsFox: Never before have we had the North Koreans in a position where their economy was at such risk, where their leadership was under such pressure that they would begin conversations on the terms that Kim Jong Un has conceded to at this point.
It’s a part of who I am and no one’s ever going to take that away. 5/5
They raised me. They knocked around and it was tough but they hung together.  They hung together for 63 years.  I know who I am because of what my mother and my father told me, what my grandmother &amp; my grandfather told me, what all my aunts and uncles told me and my brothers. 4/5
And eventually my parents eloped and they survived the Great Depression, they survived The Dust Bowl.  They went through a lot of hard times.  They raised three boys, my older brothers all of whom went off to the military.  3/5
She was a beautiful girl who played the piano.  And he was head over heels in love with her and wanted to marry her.  And his family was bitterly opposed to that because she was part Native American. 2/5

And this not just what I say, this is what our own generals who are experts in the area and responsible for the area say.  So that means we really do need strong diplomacy here.
.@SenWarren tells @johnrobertsFox: I am very glad to see the Trump Administration turn in the direction of diplomacy and the principal reason for that is because there is no military-only solution to North Korea.

It’s got to be part of an overall trade strategy that puts American workers, American small businesses first.  That’s what I really want to see.
On trade/tariffs, @SenWarren tells @johnrobertsFox:	What I’d like to see us do is rethink our whole trade strategy.  And I’m not afraid of using tariffs as part of that trade strategy...
It is important for the defense of the United States.  It is important for the security of the entire world.  But I’m worried about going into these negotiations without a strategy and without a strong full State Department to back him up.
On proposed President Trump/Kim Jong Un meeting, @SenWarren tells @johnrobertsFox: I am very concerned that the President may be taken advantage of here.  I want to see the President succeed.
Americans should rest assured that we have very good understanding of the Russian programs and how to make sure that Americans continue to be kept safe.

.@rushlimbaugh says his solution to immigration reform and #DACA is to grant permanent citizenship if, as part of the deal, immigrants can’t vote for 15 years…”if they agree to that, I’ll give them amnesty.”
.@rushlimbaugh on @realDonaldTrump's claim Russia probe is a “hoax”: The danger for the president would be for him to totally embrace this and say he’s vindicated and validate the investigation…the investigation is all about setting up Donald Trump, he is the target.
.@rushlimbaugh on Russia investigation and @realDonaldTrump's claim it’s a “hoax: I’d be careful if I were @POTUS, the recent indictments are just one level of this investigation...the worst thing he can do is claim victory here.
.@rushlimbaugh says one year ago he said on #FNS @POTUS did not collude with Russians in 2016 election.
.@rushlimbaugh on a #DACA deal: @POTUS is giving Democrats what they want and they're turning it down because they don’t want it solved.
.@rushlimbaugh on his comments @realDonaldTrump has been most productive president: Not a single Democrat can take credit for this massively booming and successful economy.
.@rushlimbaugh on immigration: This is a political issue the Dems don’t want solved...they need a permanent underclass that always depends on gov’t for survival.

.@ShuttleCDRKelly on his confidence in @POTUS and Congress to make schools safer: Some members of Congress are good at not listening—to have high school kids calling for change, it should matter and I hope in society this will make a difference.
.@ShuttleCDRKelly on if assault weapons are the real problem: Most murders, suicides are committed w/ handguns, but when an individual goes into a school or another place with the intent to kill, they can kill a lot of people much more quickly.
.@ShuttleCDRKelly says in some states, there is a short and abbreviated process to take a firearm away if one alerts authorities that the individual could be a threat...says the myth you can’t stop it isn’t true.
.@ShuttleCDRKelly on preventing more school shootings: In Florida, law enforcement has very little tools to prevent these things from happening.
.@rushlimbaugh: This is political—these students think they’re taking politics out of this but when they attack the NRA, they’re throwing in politics.
.@rushlimbaugh says a lot of people knew about Cruz and could have surveilled him...says that’s what has to change.
.@rushlimbaugh on FBI failing to follow-up on tips about FL school shooter: I can be snarky and say maybe the FBI should give up on investigating sexual harassment in the WH and collusion in the election.
.@ShuttleCDRKelly on preventing more school shootings: We’ve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them…we can’t let these dangerous people have such easy access.
.@ShuttleCDRKelly on tougher gun control: This is a very political issue, we’ve got to get people to vote on this issue.
.@rushlimbaugh on how to prevent more school shootings: The solution is we need concealed carry in the schools.
.@rushlimbaugh on connection between FBI spending time investigating Russian meddling and time not spent investigating shooting tips: The FBI is engaged in a bunch of stuff that’s wasteful. Everything has become politicized in this country and that’s why we can’t solve anything.
.@rushlimbaugh on #FloridaSchoolShooting and gun control: We have to realize this is what our country has become. Congress can’t legislate this away...It’s the fault of the people doing this and our inability to stop them.
.@rushlimbaugh on #FloridaSchoolShooting and gun control: Prayers, condolences and a march won't solve this...the next shooter is out there.
Emma Gonzalez, a senior at the HS, says "please stop allowing us to be gun downed in the hallways"…says she wants to make sure the names of the people who died are not forgotten.

.@MickMulvaneyOMB: We have fundamentally changed the structure of the American economy.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB: In 2019 proposal, we are assuming that #DACA deal is done and border wall is funded for $25B, half done this year and half done next year.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB says the bill that passed last week is not a spending bill, it simply sets the spending caps.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB: When we roll out new budget on Monday, you’ll see how it gets us away from trillion dollar deficits. Just because this bill was signed doesn't mean the future is set in stone.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on allegations of domestic abuse against Rob Porter:	For @POTUS and CoS to give Porter benefit of the doubt is a normal reaction until it was proven Porter wasn’t telling the truth, he was gone almost immediately.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on allegations of domestic abuse: We don’t tolerate it at all. It’s never come up to me in business and never come up to me as OMB Director.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB says working in the West Wing and watching news about it on television could not be more different.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB says @POTUS has not talked to him about replacing Kelly as WH Chief of Staff.

RT @fox5dc: Happy to help! https://t.co/8DLafHdvqn
Leon Panetta on reports @POTUS wants to fire Rosenstein and Mueller: If he tries to go after them and tries to somehow appear to be obstructing the process that’s involved in this investigation; he’s going to hurt himself...but more importantly, he’s going to hurt the country.
Leon Panetta on @POTUS’ tweeting: If he spends his time tweeting about the investigation or trying to tweet about undermining the FBI, very frankly he’s going to hurt his presidency.
As Chris mentioned at the top of the show, we are having major technical difficulties.  Thank you to our friends at @fox5dc for hosting our great panel of @jonathanvswan @MoElleithee @GillianHTurner @HowardKurtz
Leon Panetta’s advice to @POTUS: I think he has to focus first and foremost on being president. I realize that this investigation is going on and it probably bothers the hell out of him. But at the same time, it’s part of the process in our country to investigate what happened.
Leon Panetta on GOP’s FBI #memo: I think that the #Nunes charges against FISA, particularly without looking at the entire application, without talking to the judges who actually make these decisions, I think that’s irresponsible.
Leon Panetta on #Mueller’s Russia probe and the GOP’s FBI memo: We are going to find out what happened here with the Russians. We’re going to find out whether or not there was any collusion involved...And to try to pretend that somehow we can avoid that, is only fooling yourself.
Leon Panetta on Washington politics: “We engage in what I think is trench warfare in Washington in which both parties stay in their trenches, throw grenades at one another and fail to govern.”
Fmr CIA Director Leon Panetta on Washington politics: “There’s too much failure to kind of deal with each other on the basis of trust and honesty.  And so the result is that we engage in these partisan attacks.”

.@TGowdySC on FBI agents Strzok and Page’s released text messages: Republicans are better served by letting the texts speak for themselves, these witnesses need to tell us what they meant by it and let the jury make up their mind.
.@TGowdySC on if FBI agents Strzok and Page had the power to protect HRC:	I can’t prove they were the final decision makers nor do I have to, but two high profile people that hated Trump were involved.
.@TGowdySC on whether @DevinNunes’ FBI memo should be released: I do…“It is not a hit piece on the department and the FBI”.
.@TGowdySC on if it’s dangerous for @POTUS to sit-down with Mueller: If there is no collusion or obstruction of justice, then it shouldn’t be a problem.
.@TGowdySC says he trusts Mueller 100% to conduct a fair investigation so long as he has the resources to do so. Says “Leave him the hell alone”.
.@TGowdySC on @DevinNunes’ secret FBI memo: There’s nothing in this memo that the DOJ is not aware of…I think FBI should review it before it is released.
.@TGowdySC on Mueller interviewing @POTUS: I don’t know what @POTUS knows or is going to say but he is uniquely well-situated to answer certain questions…I want him to testify from a legal standpoint.
.@TGowdySC on impartiality in Mueller’s Russia probe: I think @POTUS has a fair investigator and prosecutor in Mueller.
.@Marcshort45 on @DevinNunes' secret FBI memo: We all want to know what’s in it, but @POTUS sides on transparency so “yes I believe he wants it put out”.
.@Marcshort45 on reports Special Council Mueller is investigating the president for obstruction of justice: I know @POTUS is frustrated, millions of dollars have been spent with no evidence of collusion.
.@Marcshort45 on @washingtonpost report WH wants to scale back environmental regulations: The administration has no plan to gut the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act.
.@Marcshort45 on infrastructure plan: It’s a growing problem, Dems will want more federal dollars toward that issue but we have a significant debt issue.
.@Marcshort45 on potential #DACA deal by March deadline: We're anxious to get a deal, we've been trying to get a deal.
.@Marcshort45 on @POTUS trying to work with Democrats: Look at this week- he made an appeal and showed leadership to solve #DACA situation.
.@Marcshort45 on if @POTUS wanted to fire Special Counsel #Mueller: Not aware of the president’s intent to ever fire Mueller…I'm not familiar in any conversation with the president that he wanted to fire Mueller.
.@Marcshort45 on infrastructure plan in @POTUS’ 2018 agenda: Rolling back burdensome regulations the past administration put into place will let economy begin to grow.
.@Marcshort45 on @WhiteHouse's immigration plan released this week: Conservatives recognize the benefit to securing the order and solving these long term problems.
.@Marcshort45 on #DACA DREAMers: Americans want to keep our borders secure and end the visa lottery system…We want to protect DREAMers, we don’t want to send them away.
.@Marcshort45 on @WhiteHouse's immigration plan released this week: @POTUS showed enormous strength and leadership…we’re anxious to solve the problem.
.@Marcshort45 on @POTUS’ #SOTU speech on Tuesday: POTUS will talk about how America is back...America is open for business.

.@ChrisCoons on resolving #shutdown: I’m optimistic, we had 20 Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, in a room yesterday trying to find a solution; we are listening and trying to find a way forward...I call on @POTUS get involved and negotiate a conclusion.
.@ChrisCoons on if Dems are holding the government hostage with #shutdown: Just because I voted against a temporary CR, I’m not an arsonist.
.@ChrisCoons on accepting a 3-week continuing resolution offer from Congressional Republicans: Depends what is on the table…I voted against a 30-day CR.
.@ChrisCoons on Friday meeting between @SenSchumer and @POTUS:  I believe Schumer put a lot on the table and the president accepted it, THEN after hearing complaints POTUS walked it back.
.@ChrisCoons on Friday meeting between @SenSchumer and @POTUS: From talking to Schumer, he reluctantly offered the two things he wanted--full funding of the military and full funding to build the wall.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on how long #shutdown will last: Could go several days as Democrats want to see @POTUS give State of the Union in shutdown.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on resolving the #shutdown: There is a chance this can get solved by Monday, but I think some Democrats wanted to deny @POTUS a victory lap of the anniversary of his inauguration.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on how 2013 #shutdown compares to this one: This is a bill the Democrats want to support, in 2013- it was something we (Republicans) didn’t like (Obamacare)…the bill on the table now would have worked in 2013.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on #shutdown: We got a majority in the Senate but didn’t get the 60 votes…without Democrats, the government won’t open.
.@ChrisCoons says the thinks @SenSchumer had to explain the difference between authorization and appropriation funding to @POTUS	in Friday White House meeting to prevent #shutdown.
.@ChrisCoons on @SenSchumer's Friday meeting with @POTUS: He offered full funding of military and full funding for wall system to @POTUS.
.@ChrisCoons on #shutdown: I think @POTUS instead of sending tweets from the WH, should pull together leaders today.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB says Schumer’s comments on what he offered @POTUS in Friday meeting to prevent #shutdown are false.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on who is to blame for #shutdown: Senate Democrats could open this today if they wanted to.
.@MikeEmanuelFox from Capitol Hill with the latest on the #GovernmentShutdown https://t.co/qfTY0EIU1a
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on #shutdown: @POTUS is actively engaged, calling people yesterday to get the government back open.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on how 2013 #shutdown compares to this one: I don’t think anybody could say this president wanted this shutdown, you can’t say the same about Obama.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on how 2013 #shutdown compares to this one: Obama wanted 2013 shutdown to politically hurt Republicans…@POTUS has worked really hard to prevent this shutdown.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on #DACA role in #shutdown: @POTUS wants to resolve DACA, he could’ve taken it away but he gave Congress 6 months to fix it.
.@MickMulvaneyOMB on government #shutdown: We’ll work to keep as many agencies open as we can…effects won’t be as visible as they were in 2013….most Americans won’t see a difference.

.@AGBecerra on immigrants in U.S.: I don’t think it is the American way to kick people out who have been here for two decades...these are people who have invested in the country and tried to make it better.
.@AGBecerra on why refugees from El Salvador are still in U.S. on temporary protected status: “Clearly things are broken” both in El Salvador and here in the U.S.
.@AGBecerra on #DACA deal: DACA deal should stand on its own, should be clean—otherwise the government shuts down.
.@AGBecerra on holding the government hostage: I don’t think Dems are doing anything to hold up, they are disagreeing with Republicans and objecting to the budget.
.@AGBecerra on if @POTUS is racist: Let me put it this way, mental instability, mendacity, now bigotry, having any of those in the White House is dangerous. Having the combination, that’s lethal.
.@AGBecerra on @SecNielsen comments on @POTUS' controversial comments: Don’t know if it’s defensible, I’ve never seen so many people w/ short term memory...a room full of people with the inability to recall a recent conversation—that’s dangerous.
.@SecNielsen on uptick of illegal immigrants: The system is worse, we have to change these loop holes so we can remove them.
.@AGBecerra on @POTUS’ right to end #DACA: Even POTUS is not above the law…he continues to believe he is above the law…If you want to change the law, don’t break it.
.@SecNielsen on #DACA: I do not believe DACA is dead...it is not a DACA deal but a security immigration deal, my role is to make sure we don’t get back here again.
.@AGBecerra on @POTUS linking gov’t funding to #DACA deal: POTUS has created chaos trying to pass DACA deal…the deal should stand on its own.
.@SecNielsen on ICE raids this week: Yes there will be more raids…the message we are trying to send is that if you break the law, you will be held accountable.
.@SecNielsen on claims @POTUS is a racist: I take a little offense to allegations that the president is racist.
.@AGBecerra: In every respect @POTUS is showing us that he is a racist.
.@SecNielsen on reports Trump administration hasn’t done a full scale missile preparedness exercise: We had a deputy exercise in December, a principle cabinet level is scheduled for next month.
.@SecNielsen on Hawaii missile alert: Not to draw the wrong conclusion—we test every day but you should take these alerts seriously.
Our talented panelists on #FNS today: @marc_lotter @adrienneelrod @johncbussey @TheJuanWilliams https://t.co/jEHAk8pZTq
.@SecNielsen on U.S. preparedness for missile attack: Our national exercise program is very robust.
.@SecNielsen on #DACA: We need a permanent solution to DACA, not a continued 3 year renewal period.
.@SecNielsen on @POTUS’ tough language in immigration meeting: I don’t recall him using that phrase...he will continue to use strong language when it comes to this issue because he is very passionate about it.
.@SecNielsen on false emergency alarm in Hawaii: It was an unfortunate situation but we’re all working to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Pompeo on talks between North and South Korea ahead of the Winter Olympics:	@POTUS has made very clear we’re going to achieve denuclearization of the peninsula...We’ll see how the talks go on Tuesday.
Pompeo on if Congress can save Iran Nuke Deal: They could take some of the weaknesses, extend deadlines, there are things they could do to make things better, and @POTUS will make a decision whether to stay in it.

.@MoElleithee on 2018 Midterm Elections: I would encourage any Democrat to realize the spectrum has changed…Democrats have to close the sale by showing that they’re going to be disconnected from the establishment.

.@stevenmnuchin1 on possibility of gov't shutdown: I can’t rule it out two days before Christmas but I don’t see it occurring…we can’t have a government shutdown in front of Christmas.
.@stevenmnuchin1 on possible new tariffs against China: We will look at where they are, whatever means we need to combat that for the American workers.

.@nikkihaley on her “tough talk” against North Korea: Diplomacy is great in some respects, but you have to also be honest…North Korea has pushed the envelope and the U.S. isn’t going to put up with it.
.@nikkihaley on if U.S. will send full team to Winter Olympics in South Korea: Yes, we are…the full Olympic team.

.@nikkihaley on @POTUS' recognition of #Jerusalem as Israel's capital: We have the right to do whatever we want in terms of where we put our embassies.
.@nikkihaley on recognition of #Jerusalem as Israel's capital: We think this is going to help us fastball the peace process going forward…No outside group should decide what the final status is.
.@nikkihaley on world leaders’ criticism of @POTUS' #Jerusalem decision: Leaders understand courage is important…It’s the right thing to do—Israel should be no different.
.@RepDebDingell on taxpayer funded payouts for workplace complaints in Congress: There must be transparency and we should never use taxpayer money to pay for someone’s despicable behavior.
.@RepDebDingell on policy to report cases of sexual harassment in Congress: We need to make sure women who have the courage to come forward aren’t hurt.
.@RepDebDingell on sexual harassment in Congress: We know what our values are...We don’t consider this a partisan issue and cannot have a double standard.
.@RepDebDingell on sexual harassment in Congress: We need to make sure we come out of this changing the culture and working together as we go forward.
.@RepDebDingell on sexual harassment in Congress: This issue is very personal to me…This has been going on for a very long time.

.@RepComstock says the priority needs to be on the victims to make sure they have a process that advocates for them so they feel there’s a system that allows them to come forward.
.@RepComstock on what should change to stop sexual harassment in Congress: I think we should be naming past people and that should be disclosed…should have outside council to review cases.

Michele Flournoy on foreign policy concerns: We need a strong diplomatic arm.  And right now, I'm very worried about the sort of decimation of the State Dept, and the departure of many senior diplomats, and the failure to bring in whole classes of new Foreign Service officers.
General Jack Keane on strategy to defeat threats from Middle East: I don't see strategy from administration to counter aggressiveness of the Iranians...the words are there, but I don't see any execution.
Michele Flournoy on how @POTUS' nat'l security and foreign policy: The president has appointed a very strong nat'l security team, but I'm concerned about some of his early actions…biggest fear right now is that allies are wondering whether they can rely on the United States.

General Jack Keane says he thinks @POTUS is trying to return America to a leadership role on the world stage again.
General Jack Keane on how @POTUS is doing in national security and foreign policy: I give him pretty good marks.  I think it begins with the national security team he's picked...they know what they're doing, they have some background and some experience.
.@SenJohnBarrasso says he thought it was childish for @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi to not attend tax meeting with @POTUS at the White House this week.
.@SenJohnBarrasso on avoiding a government shutdown this week: I think we need to keep the government open…we need to fund the government and do it competently.
.@SenJohnBarrasso on how Senate plan’s corporate tax cuts impact middle class: I expect an incredible amount of investments around the world as a result.
.@SenJohnBarrasso on differences between House and Senate tax plans: There are absolutely some changes that need to be made in conference.
H.R. McMaster on a nuclear #NoKo:  It's a regime who's said what its intentions are. If you want to know what life looks like under a North Korea regime, we just have to look north of the 38th parallel.
H.R. McMaster on #NoKo: I don't think you or anybody else is willing to bet the farm, or a U.S. city on the rational decision-making of Kim Jong Un. As you know, this is a regime that's never met a weapon that it hasn't proliferated.
H.R. McMaster on how @POTUS will “take care of” #NoKo: What @POTUS is saying is we need to take care of it.  If necessary, the president &amp; the U.S. will have to take care of it, because he has said he's not going to allow this murderous, rogue regime to threaten the U.S.
H.R. McMaster on reports @POTUS will name Jerusalem Israel’s capital: There are options involving the move of an embassy at some point...which I think could be used to gain momentum toward a peace agreement and solution that works both for Israelis and for Palestinians.
H.R. McMaster on reports @POTUS will name Jerusalem Israel’s capital: I think what @POTUS is doing is reflecting what has been, you know, a U.S. wall…he's following through on a pledge he made during his election.
H.R. McMaster on @POTUS' retweets of anti-Muslim group’s videos: : The key thing is…that these terrorists pose risks to our citizens, that we make sure that we never buy into or reinforce the terrorist narrative.
H.R. McMaster on reports @POTUS plans to replace Tillerson as Secretary of State: I'm not ware of any plan at all.  What I'm aware of is that the Secretary of State is traveling today to advance and protect our interests, as is our Secretary of Defense.

.@SenJohnThune on @CFPB director controversy: I think @MickMulvaneyOMB will be in charge, ultimately this may end up in court. CFPB was created with little transparency and is an agency that needs to be reformed.
.@SenJohnThune on Dems demanding #DACA fix in spending bill: I don’t think it should be in this bill, this should be about funding the government.
.@SenJohnThune on avoiding a gov't shutdown: Ultimately we need a bill that addresses disaster assistance and some other things…I think the president is bringing the leadership to the House and Senate to be able to do that.
.@SenJohnThune on Senate tax plan adding to national debt: We believe that with reasonable amount of economic growth, debt number is wiped out. We should not settle for 2% growth in economy…even if we get to 2.2% or 2.3%, we cover the cost of this bill.
.@SenJohnThune on potential gov’t shutdown: We need to pass a long-term spending bill…We shouldn’t have any discussion about shutting down the government.

.@SenJohnThune on @POTUS’ siding with Roy Moore: The president can speak for himself, as far as I’m concerned, the president can use his influence and do what he can to get Moore to step aside.

.@CarlyFiorina on @realDonaldTrump : We could endlessly analyze Donald Trump, what I focus on is how someone behaves.
.@CarlyFiorina: Men have known this is going on and too often they look the other way. The problem is men can still respect men with this behavior…What earns respect is decency and respect for others.
.@CarlyFiorina on exposing sexual harassment: It’s not easy. Women have been coming forward for decades…it’s the men’s turn now.
.@CarlyFiorina on if she has been sexually harassed: Of course I was. Every woman I know was…All women are not victims. But the power of men over women has been with us for a long time and we all know it.
.@CarlyFiorina on what men need to do to prevent the continuation of sexual harassment against women: Men need to decide ‘I’m not going to respect a man that disrespects women’.
.@CarlyFiorina on how to prevent sexual harassment: Most hopeful thing would be for Congress to change its own processes and procedures…process needs to change, that would actually help.
.@CarlyFiorina on sexual harassment: When are we going to stop tolerating this behavior and respecting the men that do it.

.@stevenmnuchin1 on criticism the GOP tax plan favors the wealthy: Because we’re changing from an international system to territorial—we need to make the corporate tax cuts permanent and phase out the personal.
Treasury Secretary @stevenmnuchin1 on criticism the GOP tax plan favors the wealthy: I don’t agree…this is about making the American business system competitive and creating jobs and a significant middle-class tax cut.
.@SenatorTimScott on fate of tax reform: We’ll have a full team on display in December bringing a Christmas gift to the American people allowing them to keep their hard earned money.
.@SenatorTimScott says he looks forward to working with Democrats on tax reform and believes the plan will not head the same way of “repeal and replace” in the Senate.
.@SenatorTimScott on corporate tax rate: If we are able to lower the highest corporate tax rate in the world and make it permanent, jobs will be created here at home.
.@SenatorTimScott on sexual harassment in Congress: Controversy is over the necessity to respect women…Period. This has nothing to do w/ establishment Republicans or politics, has to do with the example we want to display.
.@SenatorTimScott on Moore: It is in the best interest of the country and Alabama for Roy Moore to find something else to do.
.@SenatorTimScott on Alabama Senate race: There’s a strong possibility with a new candidate we can win that race in Alabama.

.@LindseyGrahamSC on GOP's future after failure to pass #RepealAndReplace: @SenateMajLdr's job isn't in jeopardy but the GOP's future is.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on putting #healthcare back on table:I think federalism is right approach.Would put pressure on GOP leadership to take up.
.@LindseyGrahamSC: I'm 100% certain @POTUS would use military force as last resort to stop #NoKo from developing missile to hit US homeland.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on #NoKo:  Don’t think military action is imminent, but we’re on a collision course w/ N. Korea. @POTUS inherited a mess.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on #Charlottesville nationalist groups: Their cause is un-American. It’s up to @POTUS to correct the message.
.@LindseyGrahamSC: These groups seem to believe they have a friend in @POTUS, I'd urge him to dissuade these groups that he’s their friend.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on white nationalist groups at #Charlottesville rally: I’m glad they don’t like me and don’t believe I’m their friend.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on backlash after @POTUS' #Charlottesville rally comments: Trump missed an opportunity to be very explicit here.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on white nationalist rally groups in #Charlottesville: I’d like Homeland Security to look at size &amp; scope of these groups.
.@LindseyGrahamSC on #Charlottesville protests: It was an act of domestic terrorism, these are hate-filled groups and enemies of freedom.
Dir Pompeo on #Venezuela crisis: We’ve watched a continued deterioration. This is something that has a risk of getting to a very bad place.

Dir Pompeo on chances US reacts to #NoKo threat w/ active force: Nothing imminent today but it’s a threat &amp; admin will treat it as such.
CIA Dir Pompeo on nuclear threat: Make no mistake, admin has made policy very clear. US won't have the patience it’s had w/ #NoKo anymore.
Dir Pompeo on Kim Jong Un: We're hopeful he'll understand @POTUS' comments precisely how they’re intended to be understood.
Dir Pompeo on Kim Jong Un’s mental profile: He's pretty isolated today. I'd describe him as rational &amp; he responds to adverse circumstances.
CIA Dir Mike Pompeo: #NoKo moving at an ever-alarming rate. The intel comm wasn’t surprised to find out about their warhead capability.
CIA Dir Mike Pompeo on #NoKo threat: Each time they test another missile they develop expertise and expand the envelope.
CIA Dir Pompeo on China’s leverage over #NoKo: We’ve seen the Chinese say they believe the correct answer needs to be denuclearizing.

.@jasonrileywsj on mood in the WH: There’s only so much Kelly can do. Russia probe is going to hang over staff rivalries in the West Wing.
.@ChuckLane1 on Gen Kelly's new role: Some Trump supporters see Kelly as a savior &amp; some see the staff shakeup as a betrayal to @POTUS.
.@RichLowry on Gen Kelly’s new role as WH Chief of Staff: He has authority from @POTUS &amp; his intimidation makes people pay attention.
.@rachaelmbade on repeal &amp; replace: When it comes to coming up with a replacement, Republicans are all over the map right now.
.@SenThomTillis on the effect of @POTUS’ proposal to cut legal immigration on North Carolina: “I think it could be bad.”
.@SenThomTillis on passing budget: We've got to pass a budget so we have that reconciliation vehicle. It’s a promise we made &amp; need to keep.
@SenThomTillis on willingness to pass “clean” debt limit increase: I hope we can get to spending cuts. Shouldn't be spending the way we are.
.@SenThomTillis:We can’t nip around the edges of failed Obamacare &amp; put people at risk far more so than what we tried to do a few weeks ago.
.@SenThomTillis on repealing Obamacare: I think propping up a failed platform is problematic. We’ve got to fix this problem.
.@SenThomTillis on moving on after healthcare defeat: Fact we didn’t get the votes a few weeks ago doesn’t mean we don’t still have problem.
.@SenThomTillis on Congress leaving D.C. for August recess: I signed letter to extend session into recess to fulfill promises we’ve made.
.@SenThomTillis on GOP push back: Republicans should get credit for showing independence &amp; not deferring to WH that happens to share party.
.@SenThomTillis on grand jury’s impact on Russia investigation: I’m for anything that gets us to an expedient conclusion.
.@SenThomTillis on grand jury's impact:  It’s just part of the process, I don’t have a concern. I don't read anything into it.
.@SenThomTillis: There's so many other things to get to—I’m trying to do everything I can to remove distractions so I can support agenda.
.@SenThomTillis on @POTUS’ claims Russia probe is “hoax”: I don’t believe the investigation is a witch hunt.
.@SenThomTillis: Don't want to restrict admin or #DOJ's authority from removing counsel, just want to make sure its done for right reasons.
.@SenThomTillis on bill: People want these kinds of things but don’t have majority support to do it. Don’t want to restrict #DOJ authority.
.@SenThomTillis on confidence in #DOJ and AG: This is an important part of what we need to do to reestablish public trust in Justice Dept.
.@SenThomTillis on if bill he co-sponsored to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller is aimed at @realDonaldTrump : No question that it is.
Rosenstein on #DOJ pressure on cities to crack down on illegal immigration: Cities that release illegal aliens put everyone at risk.
Rosenstein: If @POTUS wants to give orders to us in the #DOJ he does that privately. He hasn’t directed us to investigate people he wants.
Rosenstein: If Mueller finds evidence of crime within scope we've agreed to, he can expand investigation. We’re going to do the right thing.
Rosenstein on Mueller’s authority: He understands the specific scope of the investigation.
Rosenstein on Mueller’s grand jury: We don’t want to talk about it &amp; disparage someone involved or interfere with the investigation.
Rosenstein on grand jury: Doesn’t suggest anything about indictment likelihood. It’s a tool we use like any other in our investigations.
Rosenstein on Russia probe: I’m not going to comment on case. Some stories in media are false &amp; don’t come from anything Mueller or I said.
Rosenstein on if press publishes leak &amp; refuses to disclose source:Going to take fresh look at that&amp;evaluate if improvements should be made
Rosenstein on if publishing classified info is a crime: We don’t prosecute journalists for doing their job.Depends on facts &amp; circumstances.
Rosenstein on possibly issuing subpoenas to reporters to make them disclose their sources: We’re after the leakers, not the journalists.
Rosenstein on whether those prosecuted could include Congress and/or admin members: We identify somebody no matter what their position is.
Rosenstein on leaks: We don’t publicize precise # of cases but it’s required increase in resources. We’ve created new FBI unit to handle.
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein on leak epidemic: # of leaks has tripled since end of Obama admin. We’re going to respond in an appropriate way.

.@NancyPelosi on what Dems are willing to give to reform healthcare: Let’s accept what @SenateMajLdr has in his bill and talk about changes.
.@NancyPelosi on the possibility of a bipartisan compromise with Republicans on healthcare: What do they have to offer?
.@NancyPelosi on @SenateMajLdr's bill: I think there is some incentives to some of it…cost sharing reductions…I hope he moves on that.
House Dem Leader @NancyPelosi on if Gen Kelly will make a difference in @POTUS' WH: I hope so, I look forward to working w/ General Kelly.
.@KellyannePolls on whether @POTUS will get rid of CSR payments: He will make that decision next week.
