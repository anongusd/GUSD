@elenawats @itsavarose_ Rich white kid shit
@emrazz Ever since the Kavanaugh hearings, I’ve begun to notice that white men tend to be upset at the concept of women being viewed as their equal. So much so, they’ll start quoting Phyllis Schlafly, the woman solely responsible for the GOP being against women by not passing the ERA.

@thistallawkgirl Typical conservative alpha male white guy reaction.
@DGComedy Typical conservative white guy reaction.
@missmayn I wouldn’t say average white men. More like alpha male, fight loving, porn watching, conservative white men.

@BenSasse Don’t tell me what to do Ben.
@billyeichner Will someone explain to me why Adam Levine’s nipples are, uh, apparently “acceptable” on TV but Janet Jackson was shamed and blacklisted for something that wasn’t her fault?
@ziwe Will someone explain to me why Adam Levine’s nipples are, uh, apparently “acceptable” on TV but Janet Jackson was shamed and blacklisted for something that wasn’t her fault?
@adamslily Will someone explain to me why Adam Levine’s nipples are, uh, apparently “acceptable” on TV but Janet Jackson was shamed and blacklisted for something that wasn’t her fault?

@charliekirk11 So was William Rehnquist, who was a conservative hero. What’s your point?
@TaxReformExpert @david_amrine 2017, Trump calls Nazis very fine people.	Sit down.
@Lawrence Kentucky wasn’t even part of the Confederacy.
@DrewWelty @cameron_kasky Are you high?
@imillhiser Same.	Democrats condemn Northam because racism is evil.	Republicans condemn Northam because of political purposes.	If Republicans were truly against racism, they would’ve condemn Trump, Steve King, Roy Moore, and more way before Democrats did.
@Goss30Goss @DonaldJTrumpJr His dad said Nazis and white supremacists were fine people. He shouldn’t act like his shit don’t stink.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump This mans twitter feed is a goldmine
@realDonaldTrump Your Twitter feed is just a goldmine
@TheRickWilson He did not write this
@JordanUhl Then how do you explain that whole, you know... slavery thing?
@cameron_kasky Kentucky wasn't even part of the Confederacy.
@ElieNYC What high school did you go to?
@SenRickScott @washingtonpost No shit. And you blaming Democrats is just proving the theory.
@chrisdonovan Delete this tweet now
@benshapiro The right wants the left to stand by Northam but from what I can see, the left is being pretty loud in condemnation...as it should be
@rolandscahill Conservatives are against racism when only Democrats are the ones who do it.
@TheRickWilson Welp, there goes their 2020 presidential run.
@opar714 @BarackObama No wonder why no one loves you
@dpecchia @ConanOBrien In this case, it’s more important to not run as an independent.

@haydenblack Wait, what?
@RyanCollins2343 @EdKrassen @BarackObama I never once said that. Maybe you’re not that bright in learning the English language but what I said was Obama is also a hero as well as Jackie Robinson. And Obama saved the economy, gave as well as healthcare. So.....
@RyanCollins2343 @EdKrassen @BarackObama Nope, I’m right.
@charliekirk11 @RyanCollins2343 Did you know that 78% of high-income countries provide public funding for abortion, making the US an outlier?
@brooks0812 @charliekirk11 Cause... giving birth isn’t exactly a joyful experience.
@charliekirk11 @RyanCollins2343 65 countries allow abortion at this stage in cases of fetal malformations or anomalies. (https://t.co/q1y5fMNYjr…) The US doesn't have access to early abortion like many countries do.
@JoshuaHol Basically progressives in a nutshell
@questlove Exactly.

@bothedood @_leah_marie @MeghanMcCain you are irresponsibly misinformed. There is no such thing as an "on-demand" abortion after 20 weeks. You can't just walk into an abortion clinic 32 weeks in and get one because you want one.

@stevenmazie @kateashaw1 I agree. You could almost hear Roberts and Alito in the audio try to spin the arguments. Verrilli never fails to amaze me but I really liked Toti because this was her first SCOTUS argument and she really hit it home.

@LindseyGrahamSC Last time I check Lindsey, the legislative branch was coequal to the executive branch. The legislative branch makes the laws, not the president. And it’s also the legislative branches duty to be a check on the president.	(Looks like somebody didn’t do well at civics class).

@emrazz @ClaraJeffery It’s funny black people, Mexicans, Muslims, gays, women, feminists and transgenders have been called dangerous and crazy by angry white dudes.		Yet when 2 white dudes kill people within one week, they suddenly defend them.

@M0notreme @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump That’s true but at the end of the day, if she’s the nominee, I’m voting for her. If you have problems with Gillibrand, it better be about her policy stances and not on stupid bullshit.
@M0notreme @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump It’s not that I’m supporting her, I’m just sick of all this attacks on her about Fraken when it isn’t about her stances on issues. The fact that she’s even getting attacks for Fraken’s troubles is nonsense.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump •10 years ago on Jan 26, 2009, Barack Obama had been President for 6 days.	•The abysmal 2009 economy was after 8 years of a GOP President.	•Trump’s economy was mostly from Obama.		Also right now, the US Economy just lost $6,000,000,000.00 due to Trump’s 35 day shutdown

@chiefgreyfox @SteveScalise @HouseDemocrats @POTUS So it’s not the Dems fault that Trump can’t do anything right.

@chiefgreyfox @SteveScalise @HouseDemocrats @POTUS In January 2019, the House, now controlled by a Democrats, voted to approve the appropriations bill without wall funding that had previously passed the Senate unanimously, and Mitch McConnell has blocked the Senate from considering the bill the passed.
@chiefgreyfox @SteveScalise @HouseDemocrats @POTUS In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.

@GloriaCharlier @SteveScalise She’s trying to reopen the government but your president is lying to you
@SteveScalise @chiefgreyfox @HouseDemocrats have been trying to #EndTheShutdown since the first day of the new Congress.		Today's bill is the TENTH bill the House has considered to reopen the government.		Why is the government shut down?		Because the @POTUS won't let Congress reopen it.
@emrazz @xlayre Thanks, Internet. We're done here. We have a winner.
@xlayre Thanks, Internet. We're done here. We have a winner.
@chiefgreyfox @JoeNBC The Nuclear option was for a simple majority instead of 60 votes. SCOTUS nominations don’t need 60 votes in the first place. Stop spreading false info.
@chiefgreyfox @JoeNBC 1.) You don’t even know what those terms mean.	2.) what does that have to do with Garland
@drmistercody @BreitbartNews You’re replying to Brietbart. There’s no point in it
@Mikel_Jollett Now do y’all know why she’s the best choice for Speaker?
@KamalaHarris So many Democrats are doing the Bernie method. No PAC money, just donations from regular Americans.
@MidwinCharles @vanitaguptaCR @DerrickNAACP It shouldn’t be a surprise that the GOP wants only white men as our judges.
@vanitaguptaCR @DerrickNAACP At least Reagan and both Bushes nominated minorities. This is just ridiculous.
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 1.) Abortion isn’t murder, you nitwit.	2.) You literally tweeted that people should do whatever they want with their bodies yet you’re so in love with an egg, not a person, that you’ll want to sterilize them.	3.) Stop beliving in religious nonsense.
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 You’re paying for healthcare. That’s like saying I don’t want to pay for colonoscopies.
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 Wow, you people are monsters. all for fertilized eggs.
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 Birth control is the same as abortion in some sense.	Abstinence doesn’t do shit	No one wants to adopt kids.
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 Well I don’t want to pay for a stupid ass wall, or pointless wars, or tax breaks to billionaires but guess what honey, your paying what you don’t like. And also, the Hyde Amendment is there to not get federal funding.
@ClaraJeffery @Welshwacko Apparently it is
@TheRickWilson	Giuliani: “Hey Donald, I got an idea!”	Trump: “What is it Rudy?”	Giuliani: “I’m gonna dress up in drag and have you motorboat me. It’ll be awesome!”	Trump: “Man, that’s almost as crazy as me being president!”	Eric: “Daddy?”	Trump: “Who the hell are you?”
@JordanUhl About damn time
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro Are you high? No “sane” kid would hire a PR firm because most kids can’t afford one.
@VincentFrankNFL @JordanUhl Exactly! If I owned a bar, I don’t want Trump supporters in it. As a business owner, I’m allowed to run my business however I like. 	I can ban Trump supporters the same way Trump supporters want to ban Muslims.
@JordanUhl These Trumpies are claiming racism yet the bar didn’t say no white people, just Trump supporters. Doesn’t it speak volumes that these Trumpies immediately think of white people when talking about Trump supporters?
@VincentFrankNFL @JordanUhl They are tolerante. They don’t want racist hatred in their bar. (And also Cubs fans).

@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo Lost, yeah some brain cells. after reading your dumbass tweet that isn’t scientifically, mathematically, or even logically possiblly, I’m pretty sure I lost some brain cells.
@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo You're either bugfuck nuts from drinking rat-shit moonshine, or you're the kind of stupid only produced by generations of enthusiastic inbreeding and deliberate fetal alcohol poisoning.
@TimOBrien Oh he’s trying? I’m sorry, I should’ve known. I was too busy rationing food and medicine to think about Trump’s wittle feelings. I shouldn’t have spent this time worrying about how am I going to pay rent this month, I should’ve thought about Trump’s feelings.
@Sigh98610400 @OldeGreenTax @NYGovCuomo “Vaginally”? You’re so pro-life you don’t even know how giving birth works.
@Sigh98610400 @OldeGreenTax @NYGovCuomo You're either bugfuck nuts from drinking rat-shit moonshine, or you're the kind of stupid only produced by generations of enthusiastic inbreeding and deliberate fetal alcohol poisoning.
@JasonCheathawks @goldengateblond It’s a perfect analogy you ignorant Trumpy
@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo Because it’s true. Giving birth can be deadly, something you can never know. I don’t view women as baby ovens. They are actual people but you view fetuses as people and deserve more recognition than the person whose carrying it. How many women have died from abortions? Tell me.
@peterwiggin2024 @shaundavidsmith @NYGovCuomo You’re a libertarian, you don’t believe in facts
@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo Experts say that about 50% of the deaths of women from childbirth-related causes could be prevented if they were given better medical care. We're not just talking about the women who die, we're talking about 50,000 U.S. women who are suffering life-altering harms
@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo Maternal death in the United States has been steadily rising. The U.S. now has the highest rate in the developed world.
@shaundavidsmith @peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo You’re so “pro-life” that you just don’t mind that statistic that 700 actual living women die giving birth. the US is the most dangerous place to give birth in the developed world. Every year in the U.S., more than 50,000 mothers are severely injured during or after childbirth.
@peterwiggin2024 @NYGovCuomo More women die giving birth than actual abortion because birth is a very dangerous procedure
@earlessvangogh2 @KimberlyPills @nyc_2018 @NYGovCuomo It actually is. It’s called women’s reproductive health.
@DrSteveDunmire @NYGovCuomo It’s actually a great day
@earlessvangogh2 @2scoot2 @NYGovCuomo @NewsRadio930 What’s evil is you refuse to respect the right of a woman to decide what to do with her own body. Now THAT’s evil.

@Terin2Ket Prom is a school sanctioned event. Bethel School District v. Fraser gave public schools the right to punish a student for giving a lewd and indecent, even if not obscene, speech at a school events. This falls into the Tinker test which gives schools the right to punish students.
@KyleKashuv They were going to their prom which is a school event. Bethel School District v. Fraser gives public schools the right to punish a student for giving a lewd and indecent, even if not obscene, speech at school events.
@Terin2Ket @KyleKashuv The Supreme Court LITERALLY permits a public school to punish a student for giving a lewd and indecent, even if not obscene, speech at school events in the case Bethel School District v. Fraser.
@Terin2Ket @KyleKashuv Those boys were going to their prom which is a school event. Stop moving the goalpost.
@Terin2Ket @KyleKashuv All 4 of the headlines literally have the word ‘school’.
@KyleKashuv That is correct, but it still gave schools the right to limit what kind of speech. Morse was just about drugs and alcohol.	Bethel School District v. Fraser permits a public school to punish a student for giving a lewd and indecent, even if not obscene, speech.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You have to really suck up to Trump if you can turn a blind eye to the use of tear gas which is a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993.	The United States just committed a war crime.

@JBitterly @CBSNews Wrong. Comey hoped the leak would lead to special counsel on Russia. Also, that doesn’t mean anything in relation to my sources of why Mueller’s appointment is Constitutional.
@ChrisMontana25 @CBSNews (2.) Questionable appointments, Rallies, Trump’s D.C. hotel and many more.
@ChrisMontana25 @CBSNews (1) You’re right. Tax payer money should be used for something more usefrul like sending President Shit-for-Brains Securing Trump Tower, Weekends at Mar-a-Lago on Air Force One, Attacking businesses, Re-election events, Promoting the Trump brand abroad, Renting office space, etc.

@SonOfGodAndMan @realGrimReaper_ @TheTweetOfGod Hey Jesus, are you and your dad/yourself having problems?

@MalcolmNance Conservatives are always moaning about liberal elites pushing their values and agenda on them. Now we have a president elected by a minority and senators who represent a minority of America imposing their right-wing choice on the nation. This is not good for democracy.
@kenklippenstein He never was
@DavidCornDC Conservatives don’t like democracy. That’s why they always vomit out “we are a republic!” Every time they hear it.
@Goss30Goss @realDonaldTrump Justice Animal House is not the evil villain we deserve but the evil villain we need to make us fight and vote all these evil Republicans out in November.
@tonyposnanski Let’s give a special shoutout to the liberals protesting Kavanaugh who wouldn’t vote for Hillary because “both sides are the same”
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls Okay, enough with the whataboutism. I just showed you the man who cheated the black guy saying his own rule was bullshit.
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls Kavanaugh has nothing to do with Garland. Gorsush is but again, conservatives cheated Obama in an uprecedented move.
@DaddyDaddymac Black Christianity is the real Christianity since they don’t get involved in politics
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls And conservatives don’t care about fairness since they like to play dirty. Here’s McConnell saying this bullshit Biden rule is dumb.	https://t.co/UJBVxNmTXR
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls Thurmond created the Thurmond rule to stop Abe Fortas from being the Chief Justice when LBJ appointed him in 1968 but that was only during a president’s last 6 months. Obama nominated Garland in February.
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls Joe Biden wasn’t around, it was Strom Thurmond who suggested something like that and it wasn’t confirmed.
@GeorgeTakei Ted Cruz: im the most hated person in the senate		Susan Collins: hold my beer		Kavanaugh: who said beer?!
@SenatorCollins Ted Cruz: im the most hated person in the senate		Susan Collins: hold my beer		Kavanaugh: who said beer?!
@SenatorCollins Ted Cruz: im the most hated person in the senate		Susan Collins: hold my beer		Kavanaugh: who said beer?!
@TalbertSwan White people need to know that whatever “suffering” they’ve faced, it’ll never top black people.
@CalamityRob @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenateGOP Now we have to. SCOTUS has always been a Republican campaign issue to get people to vote for pro-lifers and Democrats haven’t used it. NOW we’re gonna use it. I agree with you that Democrats need to get dirty.
@CalamityRob @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenateGOP Working with the other side is called governing. We can’t be all tribal like the GOP. I know that the GOP is now a rabid right wing club, but we can’t let the Democrats fall into that. We lost in 2014 and 2016 when we weren’t motivating people (1)
@GovernorBullock When are you gonna run for President?
@sahilkapur 69? Drinking game.
@CalamityRob @SenateDems @SenSchumer Schumer has humility, unlike scumbag McConnel. Who else is gonna lead? Harris and Booker aren’t interested. And besides, they elected Schumer to be the leader so let’s hope he can at least not fuck around once he becomes Senate Majority Leader.
@CalamityRob @SenateDems @SenSchumer There’s no one else. Schumer’s the one who has to lead us in the Senate.
@thehill His wife was pro-choice.
@SenatorCollins Congratulations. This is your last term.
@Princeton I love these women
@lcmoser Conservative women suck
@andylassner @Nataliew1020 He still has Evangelicals
@ComedyCentral Her worthless stepsons goes to Africa and kills them to get erections
@thehill And they say Democrats are unhinged
@TeeMichelle57 @RepWilson @lynnv378 They only care about Benghazi
@CMVCat @KarlFDean @natalie_allison @davidplazas https://t.co/cHOX7NvIsa
@CMVCat @KarlFDean 52% of Tennessee is Evangelicals
@Pro2ASteve @SassBaller @GOP @KellyannePolls You’re point? 17 Supreme Court Justices confirmed by Senate during presidential election year. They didn’t want the black guy to get his nominee. It was a bullshit political move.
@TalbertSwan Malcom X!
@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley Merrick Garland
@NBCNews She’s officially the King. I don’t make the rules.
@WesleyLowery Atticus Finch for the Supreme Court
@leftcoastbabe You want to know what’s worse than sexually assaulting someone, smoking pot and calling yourself smart?		Being appointed by a black man during an election year.
@leftcoastbabe Remember when a Supreme Court nominee calling herself a "wise Latina", was considered a scandal for Republicans?
@Goss30Goss Remember when Sonia Sotomayor called herself a wise Latina and these same asshole Republicans were “very concerned”?	(And by very concerned, I meant they didn’t want minorities on the Court. Sexual predators, yes. Minorities, No.)
@ArseGrammatica @NewJeffCT @ananavarro Republicans are fine appointed accused sexual predators but are “very concerned” when a minority is appointed.
@realDonaldTrump If Kavanaugh is confirmed, instead of a judge’s robe he plans on wearing Hugh Hefner’s.
@ClaraJeffery @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin If Kavanaugh is confirmed, instead of a judge’s robe, he plans on wearing Hugh Hefner’s.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump He’s officially lost his damn mind.
@realDonaldTrump Yep, he’s officially lost it.
@beachibb @FrankMalfitano @JonahNRO Your imaginary friend isn’t real
@awzurcher @ValerieJarrett @AprilDRyan He wrote an article in WSJ apologizing.	https://t.co/UJYdBOxsGo
@JoeNBC And also in 2014
@jbouie Don’t compare a sexual predator to an America hero.
@andylassner Trump’s parents look like they’re secondary characters from a Tim Burton movie come to life
@davidhogg111 That’s what happened in 2014 and 2016 and why we’re in this mess.
@davidmweissman Also, people care more about celebrities
@rolandscahill That’s the question
@proudtobeaname5 @3DTruth @MichaelAvenatti @benshapiro Trump slept with that porn star
@theblaze https://t.co/jZZXm8R2zv
@washingtonpost So Christian Bale is playing human evil
@KrangTNelson Conservatives love the first amendment but only when THEY get to use it. They don’t seem to like it when other people use it.
@MSNBC They can't all be Democrat operatives paid off by the Clintons and Soros to get revenge for the 2016 election, can they?
@MSNBC @allinwithchris Republicans don’t care because they don’t believe in observable reality
@markiplier I swear I had pants on
@peterdaou His secret lover to comeback to him.
@cindycrittenden It’s a scary time for WHITE men, that’s what he meant.
@BarackObama @MichelleObama Family values white evangelicals call a man who’s been married once for 26 years and had no affairs 	“the antichrist”	yet they call a man who’s married thrice, calls Africa a shithole, sleeps with porn stars, grabs women by the p*ssy without consent 	“God appointed”
@TalbertSwan White people are bending over backwards for Kavanaugh’s actions yet they had no problem with Lionel Tate sentenced to life at just 12 years old.
@TheDweck @MalcolmNance His dad looks like Nicolas Cage melted
@ParkerMolloy Hey, for all of you making fun of his parents’ appearance should be ashamed of yourselves.		Botched up plastic surgery is not funny.
@DoctorFlaps @ParkerMolloy @MeowLillian His dad looks like an infected scrotum
@HoarseWisperer @tarastrong @ParkerMolloy Scientist still haven’t figured out how he came to this world.	Personally, I believe Trump was brought to this world when a racist fairy brought a butternut squash to life.
@Lawrence @MalcolmNance @LindseyGrahamSC If Ted Cruz loses in November, @LindseyGrahamSC will be able to take over as most hated Senator.
@jamisonfoser @MalcolmNance @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham has lost her mind.
@hardball He’s very popular in West Virginia.
@joshtpm Klobuchar is more manly than Graham
@TheTweetOfGod @Goss30Goss This "all men should be worried" statement is a load of shit. The men who should be worried know they should be worried because they’re the ones sexually assaulting people. Those of us who DON’T sexually assault people sleep just fine.
@KingJames It makes sense to pay student athletes. If athletes get paid, they can use the money they earn to pay for school. Colleges should give those scholarships to those who need and deserve it.
@SportsTalkJo3y @KingJames And 2 Olympic Gold Medals, is a 3× NBA Finals MVP, 4× NBA Most Valuable Player, 14× NBA All-Star, is worth $440 million, and opened a school for at risk youth in his hometown. What is your point?
@TIME The very fact that student athletes are treated like slaves is just shocking.
@simonettiwvu @zellas73 @TIME No, it actually is. Rich white guys profiting off of black men’s work and don’t want those athletes to even get any compensation. Sounds like slavery.
@RoboCopDiva @TIME That makes so much sense.
@markiplier Mark, what are you planning
@Fiery_Dove @SenatorLeahy https://t.co/3b4RZafgUn
@timheidecker I don’t get it
@jkimballcook @vbspurs @JonahNRO @ILTimes Same here. Don’t bring his kids involved in this.
@RuthHHopkins Jim Crow be at it again
