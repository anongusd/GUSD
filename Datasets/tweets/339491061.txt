@stephenfrank87 @KyleKulinski I agree with you, but the tweet reeks of political strategist.  I‚Äôd bet $27 that he‚Äôd have a way more informed statement in an interview/debate setting.
@KyleKulinski Occam‚Äôs razor; I highly doubt Bernie‚Äôs tweet is interventionist given Ro Khanna is a campaign co-chair, the more likely explanation is that the tweet is vague and lacking nuance.  Would love to hear Bernie address his stance in a video.

@archibaldcrane @JimmyGomezCA You‚Äôre right, I saw several quotes and petitions backing Lee for speaker and made an assumption, my bad.  Perhaps if she sees the support is there from the grassroots and her fellow reps she may throw her name in the hat.  A progressive can dream....

@JimmyGomezCA 3) Pelosi believes being good at begging for special interest money makes her a master legislator.	This is not an attack on you, I voted for you.  But please consult your values and reevaluate your choice to back Pelosi, who merely pays lip service to progressive values.
@JimmyGomezCA Proud constituent of CA-34 here, this legislation reeks of denial and desperation.	1) The new progressive caucus of AOC and others is gaining membership and voter support fast.	2) Barbara Lee is a better pick for speaker; she had the cajones to vote against the Iraq back in 2001.

@CNN @jaketapper @CNNPolitics @TheLeadCNN @DavidChalian How can we pay for Medicare For All?  Well Jake, the money comes from what families would have set aside for ins premiums, leaving some left over to get their kids school supplies and maybe go out to dinner. #tytarmy
@FOX4 @FOX4 @BruceSmithFox4 @tvbossy what is newsworthy about a murder victim smoking weed? MOST US citizens do. Did Dallas PD push for the original story? Will the writer responsible for the story be held accountable? R u gonna run a story about the murderer‚Äôs belongings? #tytarmy
@StephenMoore hey Stephen, it‚Äôs me, US Deficits....why won‚Äôt you return my calls?  We used to have so much fun during the Obama years, but now it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even care about me... what‚Äôs up with that?

@cenkuygur Trumps midterm panic is starting to make me think he needs lyin ted more that lyin ted needs him.  I smell a role reversal....
@elizabethforma ‚Äúpersisting‚Äù isn‚Äôt good enough.  Fire your campaign strategists/rally organizers.  People want policies, if they wanted nice words they could use a thesaurus.

@BankofAmerica @BofA_News @BofA_Help @BofA_Tips How dare you perpetuate a message of hate by freezing the monies of suspected undocumented immigrants?  Who gave you the right to do this?  You are putting b of a on the wrong side of history.
@realDonaldTrump you still have a chance to call Medicare for all ‚ÄúTrumpcare‚Äù.  You‚Äôd be destroying the private health insurance industry in exchange for securing your popularity.  Make your choice.  The clock is ticking.
@jaketapper @CNN @CNNPolitics @cnnhealth Here‚Äôs a fact check for ya Jakey boy: Abe Lincoln‚Äôs mom was half walrus.  I‚Äôm the author of this tweet so it must be true, right?  I thought journalism meant the MEDIA educate the PEOPLE... strange world we live in. https://t.co/8Evkahhp74
@aMSaRedyoshi a lot of your matches have a moment where you and your opponent stand still and wait (a stand-off).  Is that a Yoshi thing?  What goes thru your head?
@TheYoungTurks Larry Krasner is coming under üî• for opposing ICE in Philadelphia!  He is doing amazing things there as DA that no one else has the guts to do.  Can TYT please put a spotlight on this guy?
@AP @AP_Politics @APHealthScience @stevenpsloan your ‚Äúfact‚Äù check of your original ‚ÄúMedicare For All‚Äù coverage gets a ‚Äúsee me after class‚Äù.  I appreciated the effort but try again, and next time don‚Äôt open a fact check with a metaphor https://t.co/IhYjpy082e

@oizo3000 Been listening to Bobbi since nardwuar recommended it, you frenchies have great taste!
@mitch_murder This made me envision doing an intense rap verse over this beat, if only I had your incredibly crisp execution to do so.  You should really listen to Zammuto‚Äôs ep Veryone for more of these feels.
@MACROSS8299 if you ever make a Sailorwave iPhone case with the glittered out Usagi, consider my money already in ur pocket
@aMSaRedyoshi I would 100% buy an English version
@mitch_murder This song tells me you‚Äôre a company man, maybe even Penske material
