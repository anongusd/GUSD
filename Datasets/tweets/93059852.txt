RT @AcrossTheBay: A propos: https://t.co/nGvJfrL2wx https://t.co/Gz3tBoK19W https://t.co/0HcRYpNuNF
Right now, the idea of protecting part of land bridge from Iran while supporting IRGC auxiliaries on both termini in Iraq &amp; Lebanon because of ISIS is not a policy. 1st step in real Iran policy is support for US allies‚Äîesp Israel &amp; Saudi‚Äîin their conflicts w/Iran &amp; proxies. https://t.co/PZQBHIDikO
Mattis' departure was v good first step‚Äînext is w/drawal from ISIS campaign in Iraq as well as Syria. More freedom of action for Israel &amp; time for US to formulate a serious anti-Iran strategy. Or not. https://t.co/9LNVcTImWz
And that's why US deployment in Iraq &amp; Syria is still an issue. Since Iran licenses US' anti-ISIS campaign, deterrence re Iran is baked into it, for both US &amp; to a lesser extent Israel. Insofar as DOD has institutionalized CT &amp; anti-ISIS campaign, they protect Obama's legacy. https://t.co/JtFgp4bbnI
Yes, @AcrossTheBay &amp; @Doranimated have laid this out in detail over the last several years. Obama admin essentially locked in DOD thinking re Iraq‚Äîwe can't fight Iran because we're here by their permission‚Äîand turned COIN &amp; CT into premise of regional strategy: partner w/Iran. https://t.co/13YAqUsoZO
Though Eisenkot doesn't say, we know why rules of the game changed in Jan 2017‚ÄîWH under new management. Under Obama, US habitually leaked Israeli operations targeting Iranian depots, convoys, etc. Thus, w/out Obama deterrence, Israel can pick up pace of operations. https://t.co/CPK3hxzp7k

@aaronjmate @CJBdingo25 @Ar_Chroi @ClimateAudit @wakeywakey16 Right and that‚Äôs why, as far as we know, there are no official documents stringing together Mifsud to Papadopoulos to Downer.

@CJBdingo25 @Ar_Chroi @ClimateAudit @wakeywakey16 FBI would‚Äôve known of Mifsud &amp; his alleged Kremlin links by the time the probe began, July 31, 2016. Or else on what basis did they open a major CI probe into Trump-Russia ties? That the Mueller sentencing memo suggests the FBI knew nothing about him before seems important.
