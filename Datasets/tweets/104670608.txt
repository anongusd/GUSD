Glad to see @WaldorfSchool & @misskrissypants loves learning as much as I do! Thanks for retweeting the #valentines #facts.
Well that is all the #didyouknow #facts about #valentines I could think of... Hope you enjoyed learning as much as I did!
In Iran, the Sepandarmazgan, or Esfandegan, is an age-old traditional celebration of love, friendship and Earth. Sorta like Valentines day..
Isn't learning about other cultures fascinating? #didyouknow #valentines
In Brazil, the Dia dos Namorados (lit. "Day of the Enamored") is celebrated on June 12, when couples exchange gifts, chocolates, etc.
Although it is similar to the United States' version, it is also common to see people do "acts of appreciation" for their friends.
In some South American countries Valentine's Day is known as "D√≠a del Amor y la Amistad" (Day of Love and Friendship)...
RT Indeed it isn't, but don't mourn being single! @misskrissypants: @SeattleOutProud: its not always a bad thing to be single you know.
I rather hope none of you intend to celebrate Black Day!
On April 14 (Black Day), those who did not receive anything go to a Chinese restaurant to eat black noodles "mourn" their single life.
In South Korea, as in Japan, women give chocolate to men on February 14, and men give non-chocolate candy to women on March 14 (White Day).
@misskrissypants glad to hear it! I think the way it is celebrated in other countries is amazing.
However it isn't until March 14th, called White day, where men return the deed with a more expensive gift... #didyouknow
Today in Japan, the women give men chocolates to celebrate their love and friendship. #didyouknow
