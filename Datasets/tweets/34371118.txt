@LaraFriedmanDC @IlhanMN I was explicitly saying he’s a lobbyist for the Iranian regime. I stand by this. No aspersion there, just facts. I have never said supporters of the JCPOA were more loyal to Iran, never would. See the difference?
@mattduss I don’t understand Matt. If you really want to combat anti-Semitism, you should only vote for it as part of a resolution to withdraw US support for the Saudi war in Yemen?
@LaraFriedmanDC @IlhanMN Even so, wouldn’t this line cut both ways? Or do you think people who opposed the JCPOA are like Rev King?
@LaraFriedmanDC @IlhanMN Trita—an Iranian-Swedish dual national who helped arrange for members of Congress to meet Javad Zarif--is very different than US citizens who support the state of Israel. But you knew this already. Also Israel is America’s ally. Iran funds terrorists who kill Americans.

@BBKogan @MEPFuller I’ve seen defense spending expressed as a percentage of overall spending before. It’s not a gimmick or a scare tactic. It’s one way to measure priorities. The point is that when we talk about defense spending, we’re really talking about how great a power we want America to be.

Next on Munich’s Funniest Home Videos https://t.co/RPHMfDR4FK
@BBKogan @MEPFuller If the US is committed to defending South Korea, Europe, Saudi Arabia, Israel etc.. it has to spend a lot more on its military, that's a large enough figure that it makes sense to express the number as a percentage of the economy.
@BBKogan @MEPFuller Sorry to thread jack, but there is no conspiracy to express defense spending as a % of GDP. I think you raise a good point about efficiencies for weapons systems. But the real question is what are America's hard power commitments?

@DamonLinker This is a larger conversation. Sometimes regime change works (Serbia 2000, Germany 1945) Sometimes it doesn’t.
@LorenCrowe @DamonLinker Semantics. But I agree. In the sense that the Maduro regime will be changing when Guaido succeeds, it is regime change. You are correct though, that this is not Iraq redux.

@emptywheel @RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama I find your arrogance hilarious. I reject your premise. I don’t see the point of replacing a treaty with a party that won’t keep its word on the existing one. Why do you want to keep making deals with Russia?
@emptywheel @RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama I answered it. And stop being coy, do you think Trump’s INF decision is further evidence for your narrative about Russian leverage?
@johnastoehr @emptywheel @RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama I don’t think you understand the issue.
@emptywheel @RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama Yes. Russia is deploying missiles prohibited by the treaty. All of NATO found Russia in material breach. So staying in a treaty that only one side observes is bad for US interests. Staying in the treaty under those conditions is good for Russia.
@emptywheel @RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama You think pulling out of the INF is evidence of Russian leverage on Trump? That is insane.
@RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama How do you explain then the NATO statement calling Russia in material breach?
@RadioFreeTom @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @joshtpm @sbplama How is this letting Russia off the hook?  They weren’t complying with the treaty. It’s acknowledging reality. Your approach gives treaty violators the impression that they violate with impunity.
@RadioFreeTom @joshtpm @RLHeinrichs @noonanjo @sbplama No. The rationale is that arms control agreements should be a two way street.

@RadioFreeTom @joshtpm @sbplama So what do you do to get Russia to destroy the missiles they have already deployed? Sanctions? More sternly worded demarches? The Russians now have 6 months to think about whether they like the new strategic environment they have created.
@RadioFreeTom @joshtpm @sbplama They tried to bring Russia into compliance. They are not interested. This move is good for arms control going forward. Also good for countering China.
@joshtpm @sbplama @RadioFreeTom North Korea had cheated before that. And as much I like and respect tom, his argument acts like there hasn’t been an effort for the last 10 years to drag Russia back into compliance.
@joshtpm @JerryCurl16 @RadioFreeTom He made those remarks before Russia began its serial violations. See my other response.
@sbplama @joshtpm @RadioFreeTom This is from a dozen years ago. Since then Russia has had the best of both worlds. America adheres to the treaty and Russia cheats. A great deal for Russia
@tk76__ @Michael_Levin deep cut
@JerryCurl16 @joshtpm @RadioFreeTom Agreed. Josh, what are you basing your assessment on?
@joshtpm @RadioFreeTom What are you basing that on ?
@joshtpm How is it in America’s strategic interest to remain in a treaty that doesn’t let the US deploy intermediate range missiles against China and Russia as they deploy them against our allies?
@joshtpm @RadioFreeTom They have not wanted out of the treaty.
@joshtpm That makes even less sense. The INF prohibits the US from countering China’s missiles too. If China and Russia want to agree to new limits on these missiles, I am all for a mew one. But as it is now, it’s an arms race without the US running.
@joshtpm The USSR ended up signing the original INF after Reagan fielded Pershings in West Germany. They respond to proliferation. Staying in a treaty that Russia doesn’t adhere to is a win for Russia.
@joshtpm The US has been trying to get Russia to stop violating the treaty for 10 years. There are plenty of IR types who agree with this move. And if the administration just wants to kill arms control agreement, why are they seeking one with North Korea?

@joshrogin @ChuckRossDC Inconsistency is not a synonym for partisan or political.

@gabrielmalor It isn’t. White collar criminals are often allowed to turn themselves in.
I don’t buy the special counsel’s line that they had to do a pre-dawn SWAT team raid to arrest Roger Stone because they feared he would erase files. He’s been saying he would be indicted for months.

@derekmke @emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia You seem dim
@joshtpm @emptywheel @robertwrighter @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia Unless you think Stone knew wikileaks was Russia, then that matters. The indictment does not allege Stone coordinated with Russia to release of the emails Russia stole. Maybe he will end up proving that or something similar. But he hasn’t yet.
@joshtpm @emptywheel @robertwrighter @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia First of all, you’re agreeing with me on this pedantic argument I’m having with Marcy on what the initial probe was about. Second of all, what are you talking about? The indictment of Stone says he lied about his contacts with wikileaks.
@emptywheel @Chijogoldbe @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia When did the FBI or Mueller or anyone say it started its counter-intelligence investigation because it was concerned Putin could blackmail Trump?
@emptywheel @robertwrighter @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia A fascinating blog post, but this doesn’t tell us anything about the initial FBI investigation. If you want to argue that Trump’s pursuit of a hotel in Moscow during the campaign is leverage Russia has over him, I agree. But this doesn’t answer my question.
@Chijogoldbe @emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia That doesn’t help Marcy. No one is denying the special counsel can investigate what he wants. But this is a political debate too. The initial reason for the FBI investigation matters a great deal. If they don’t have it. That matters.
@robertwrighter @emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia Then Marcy should have no problem telling me where in the public record we can find that the genesis of the CI investigation was to determine if Trump himself is easily blackmailable
@emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia Where?
@emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia What are you basing that on? Also how do you know what is going to be charged?
@emptywheel @TCleveland4Real @BalkansBohemia whatever you want to call it, the original counter-intelligence investigation was predicated on finding out if Trump world coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election. This indictment does not get us that.
@TCleveland4Real @emptywheel @BalkansBohemia fair enough. But all this took place in 2016. And I don’t think what they did before is quite the same as journalism either. No fan of wikileaks. Just think this indictment doesn’t get us any closer to the initial collusion allegation.
@emptywheel @BalkansBohemia I know about Vault 7. But I don’t know what this has to do with the thread.
@emptywheel @BalkansBohemia So your position is that Assange is a Russian agent and that Stone knew it?
@emptywheel @BalkansBohemia huh?
@BalkansBohemia I don’t know if it was practicing journalism in 2010 either. But the basic conceit of the organization—accepting anonymous files of internal documents and putting them online—is pretty much the same.

Venezuela has a democratic tradition, Saudi doesn’t. Chavez and Maduro destroyed Venezuela’s democratic institutions. @jguaido is restoring democracy here
@ProfSimonton @DemSocialists @jguaido Absolutely I agree with that. He is the head of the national assembly. This is the legislature exercising its constitutional prerogative. I hope he prevails. It’s good that so many countries are behind him.
@ProfSimonton @DemSocialists @jguaido There will be no free and fair election as long as Maduro is in power. The moral thing to do here would be to urge Maduro to leave peacefully so Venezuela can begin to rebuild. Instead they align themselves with the man who broke it.
@ProfSimonton @DemSocialists @jguaido Did you read the statement? “Hands Off Venezuela?” It’s garbage. Where’s the recognition that Maduro stripped the elected legislature of any power and created a new one?

@mehdirhasan Chavez and Maduro not only strangled Venezuela’s democratic institutions over the last 20 years, they also drove the state into a ditch. Police, Army, hospitals etc.. are not paid. Because of their misrule there is a refugee and humanitarian crisis.

@STRapten @kolsaw @ssolomon999 @RichLowry @bopinion @RadioFreeTom FBI and president are the same branch of government
@RadioFreeTom @Real_MrMyke I’m not saying the FBI should not have investigated Trump Russia. I’m responding to the times reporting that his firing of Comey was the cause of an investigation into him. You brought up Trump Flynn as part of that.
@Real_MrMyke @RadioFreeTom Maybe. I would just urge you to remember that Sullivan walked back his initial comments after the break. And the way these deals work is that the government can’t come back and charge you for more stuff after you make a deal like that.
@Real_MrMyke @RadioFreeTom So what are you saying? That Mueller allowed a traitor to plead out to one count of lying to the FBI and recommended zero jail time. You think that’s likely?
@Real_MrMyke @RadioFreeTom Yes, he was a major Logan Act violator too.

@kolsaw @ssolomon999 @RichLowry @bopinion @RadioFreeTom Finally, a related matter here is also important. Public should not know this much about ongoing, unresolved CI investigations. Someone leaked their existence. That leak makes something that should not be partisan, very partisan. It weaponizes national security. That’s bad too
@kolsaw @ssolomon999 @RichLowry @bopinion @RadioFreeTom If there is more evidence, that we haven’t seen, then I allow it may have been ok. But as is, it sets a very bad precedent. The proper venue for this matter really is Congress.
@kolsaw @ssolomon999 @RichLowry @bopinion @RadioFreeTom Also, no one is arguing the FBI can’t investigate the president for counter-intelligence reasons. The issue is whether the bureau can launch such an investigation because Trump fired Comey and told Russia’s FM the firing took the pressure off?
@kolsaw @ssolomon999 @RichLowry @bopinion @RadioFreeTom I don’t agree with Tom on this one. 1) Trump urging Comey to go easy on Flynn is ambiguous at best. FBI agents said at the time they did not suspect Flynn was deliberately lying. Also what was the Flynn investigation about? Logan Act? Russia collusion?
@aarostew @alexzfinley This is a straw man. The issue is whether firing Comey and then bloviating about it on television and in a meeting with Russia’s foreign minister is cause for launching an investigation. If that’s all there was to it, then it’s a terrible precedent and an overstep of authority.
Outstanding column from Ray Takeyh. Iran responds to threats. https://t.co/RfIbVxdODz
@alexzfinley All fair points. Not arguing against a CI investigation into Russia. I am saying the way the Times story has it, the FBI looks like it panicked and overstepped. And it’s been part of a disturbing pattern too. Independence is not a license to interfere in politics.

Barr gives a clever answer on when he would resign. He says, I won’t be bullied by anyone to do something wrong . . . the president, members of congress or editorial boards. His pitch is that he has no political ambitions and therefore won’t have a problem resigning if he must.
@NatashaBertrand @joeiavovella @Susan_Hennessey Right, I was replying to the tweet saying he couldn’t say what was going on with the investigation.
@joeiavovella @NatashaBertrand @Susan_Hennessey So it’s ok for the FBI director to lie to the president about it?

@AlbaneseJoe @NatashaBertrand @Susan_Hennessey maybe. But the point is that firing Comey should not be grounds for launching a CI investigation into the president. If there is other evidence, I’m all ears. But that is a troubling precedent.
@NatashaBertrand @Susan_Hennessey I largely agree, but Comey assured Trump and later testified to Congress that he told Trump he was not investigating him.

@joelmmathis That’s fair. But I guess I go back to the old maxim about art and artists. What he did was in a different category that Weinstein. Doesn’t make it ok. But what the “no comeback” crowd is really saying is that people who want to see Louis’ art should be deprived of it.
@joelmmathis Come on man. I know this is not real totalitarianism, hence the modifier “Cultural.” And my point is that there is an impulse at play that demands the in group denounce the exile.
The Louis CK shtick has not changed. He looks around and asks what am I not allowed to make jokes about, and then proceeds to do just that. It’s a tradition that has been keeping our society sane for decades. I would hate to see it end now.
The reaction from some comedy royalty to Louis CK’s come back reveals a cultural totalitarian impulse. Louis is now a non-person. He should be “raped” and “shot at.”  https://t.co/guC3qtISTA

@joshua_landis @barbaraslavin1 Iran’s outposts in Syria and Russia’s active air campaign are new.
@joshua_landis @barbaraslavin1 Sure. But in 2015—after the Iran nuclear negotiations wrapped up—2 things happened. 1) Russia established airbases and proceeded to bomb rebel outposts, killing countless civilians. And 2) Iran and Russia formalized their agreement to win the war Assad’s forces could not.

@CanerdianGirl @speechboy71 Mike Pompeo did not say and does not believe the eradication of the Jewish people would be a positive development for humanity. This is rank nonsense.
@GregortheMendel @speechboy71 no it isn’t. It’s an extreme and tendentious reading of what evangelicals mean by the rapture. It’s also a lazy and old trick. They said Reagan wanted to bring about the end times. Same with W. There are real problems in the world and in the Trump administration, focus on those.
@speechboy71 You just said Pompeo believes the eradication of Jews would be “a positive development for the human race.” That is an insane thing to say.
@speechboy71 You really think Pompeo believes this?
@NTarnopolsky He has the same initials as the 35th president of the United States.
@NTarnopolsky @NoahShachtman A) I don’t think you’re right about this being among his deepest beliefs. and B) I don’t think he supports Israel only as a gathering place for Jews in the event of the end times. He has said many things on the issue besides this one line in a recent speech.

@pierre yes, I meant in the court of public opinion. And I never bought the blackmail line from Yates.
@pierre I think you can criticize Flynn fairly for that btw. But it’s also worth knowing what the FBI was investigating when the agents interviewed him.
@pierre I mention it at the end. He registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and ended his contract after the election. But I was focused on the initial charge against him, which was that he was a Russian agent.
@AmbHarper thanks man.
@DougJBalloon I’m not a critic of the Mueller probe. I’m a critic of the way in which Flynn was targeted in the transition. If he was a Russian agent, I think it would have outed.
@MaxKennerly @edbott Agreed, we don’t know everything. But do you really think Mueller would let Flynn skate if he was a Russian agent?
@edbott @MaxKennerly So you think they made up the quotes from their witnesses?
@DarbysDose @MaxKennerly @edbott doesn’t this point cut in both directions?
@edbott @MaxKennerly It was based on interviews. And it has been the only committee that actually tried to get an answer to the question. I would love it if more committees would find this out.
The resistance https://t.co/GOVNq9SpIX
@MaxKennerly @edbott And for that Flynn is owed an apology.
@MaxKennerly @edbott But what were they investigating when they approached Flynn, as NSA, like he was a member of a crime family. What was the crime they thought Flynn committed. If it’s the Logan Act or lying to Mike Pence, I think the FBI and DoJ overstepped their authority.
@MaxKennerly @edbott My column was specifically about the Russia matter. On this one, the prosecution has presented no evidence that Flynn was an agent for Russia, aided in the conspiracy to hack Democrats etc.. The charge he copped to was lying to the FBI. As I say, it’s a serious matter.
@MaxKennerly @edbott in November 2016 and then retroactively registered under FARA after he resigned in 2017. That’s a problem. But most FARA violations of this sort usually result in a fine. Mueller is prosecuting this now as a felony. I am not necessarily opposed, but that’s new.
@MaxKennerly @edbott OK. Since you asked, a few facts that are relevant. Flynn registered initially for his contract through the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It’s not unusual for lobbyists to avoid FARA requirements by doing this, but I agree that it’s been a problem for years. He ended the contract

@joshtpm You forgot the Logan Act. I’m trying to help you Josh. The FBI still hasn’t told us what crime they were investigating when they trapped Flynn into lying. It doesn’t excuse his lying. But to pay no attention to that side of the story is willful blindness. I’m helping you
@joshtpm I’m right. The treatment of Flynn was a disgrace, particularly by liberals who are supposed to be wary of the FBI.

The US has concluded that the “chlorine gas attack” Russia and Assad accused rebels of launching last month was actually tear gas. Assad just orchestrated a false flag attack against its own side. https://t.co/bgPxwWNjUm
Assad and Russia have been trying to persuade credulous saps for half a decade that the rebels are gassing their own side. Well Syria just conducted its own false flag last month. I have the details. https://t.co/bgPxwWNjUm

@DanDePetris Now it’s being applied to Saudi Arabia. That is a sea change. At the same time, you have to answer the following question: Who would you rather control the Gulf of Aden, Iran’s proxies or Saudi’s proxies? I think it’s in the national interest to stop Iran there.
@DanDePetris I don’t think there should be a blank check. But, again, the US has suspended the mid-air refueling, it has pressed for new rules of engagement and it’s following through on Magnitsky. That last one is a big deal. This was legislation initially designed for Russia,
@DanDePetris Whether we agree or not, Saudi will not let Iran Lebanize Yemen. What is the best way, in light of that, to change Saudi behavior and end the crisis in Yemen.
@DanDePetris You miss the point. Iran has killed, maimed and kidnapped Americans. The regime defines itself by its hatred of America and Israel. Saudi, as imperfect as it is, is a longstanding ally. This is true in terms of counterterrorism and regional state competition.

@Michael_Youhana @lionel_trolling As I told Professor Trolling, I think it’s a nifty portmanteau
@lionel_trolling I think it’s a nice little portmanteau
@lionel_trolling You’re a smart guy, John. This isn’t hard.
@lionel_trolling Well, I deplore white nationalism and I think Tucker’s coverage of the caravan was fear mongering bullshit. But there is a distinction. My point about antifa is their use of anti-democratic tactics, not the content of their beliefs.
@lionel_trolling It’s an important insight. The anti-fascists act like fascists. You disagree?
@lionel_trolling No. I’m saying these people are acting like a bunch of fascists.
@lionel_trolling Meh. Shouting people down, street violence, “we know where you live,” stirring up mobs. These are the tactics of fascists. I will grant you that these dipshits probably don’t have a coherent agenda. But my point stands
@lionel_trolling This is an odd argument to be making in the context of antiFa, which argues anyone who wears a MAGA hat might as well be a Nazi, but good to know.

@chibbitychoo Steve Scalise might disagree
@gina_goldberg you think the psychopath who shot up the congressional baseball game is like the abolitionists? What’s wrong with you?
@valkayec I’m not making any excuses, I can assure you. Important to wait for the facts to come in and also to understand that neither side has a monopoly on political violence (pardon the pun).
@ProvaxShill Are you really disputing that the right and left throughout US history have conducted political violence? It’s not really an issue. I realize you want to make a political point, and I have no quarrel with that point. That’s not what I said though.
@tomricks1 I don’t really disagree. It's a bit different though. The Klan is a vile stain on American history. At its peak though, it was not really on the fringe. It was an unofficial arm of the state. But I agree. They conducted political terrorism, for sure.
@ZaxxonGalaxian Steve Scalise?

@AdamSerwer @Susan_Hennessey I think a more likely explanation is that Trump’s middle east policy hinges on MBS and he wants to give the Saudis a road map to save face. An irony is that my column that will be up in an hour is all about how Trump should not enable the Saudi cover story.
@PAIDtriot your tweet is moronic. I don’t think it’s normal. Google me
@jondschreiber @Susan_Hennessey yeah, I agree with that
@AdamSerwer @Susan_Hennessey I don’t know his motivation. My point is that it’s not that unusual for US presidents to help cover up Saudi misdeeds, indeed it’s a pattern. And I’m with Lindsey for the most part here, but members of Congress have different equities on these matters than the executive branch.
@jondschreiber @Susan_Hennessey Well I wrote as much last that the Saudis can’t be allowed to think they control the alliance. So I want a robust rebuke. My point is that there are national interest reasons why Trump would want a cover up
@AdamSerwer @Susan_Hennessey W’s father helped start the Carlyle Group, which opened US industries to Saudi investment. But that misses the point. It’s possible this is driven by corruption. I don’t put it past Trump. But US lying on behalf of Saudi goes back decades. There are national interest reasons too

@mtsw But you believe a bunch of nonsense about how America got into the Iraq War. You’re uninterested in really grappling with the issue, you just want to act like it’s brave to dehumanize writers with whom you disagree. And that’s fine. But don’t act like you do it for the Iraqis.

@imillhiser You can’t be this dense. There is no corroboration for the claims against Kavanaugh. Accusations are not evidence. This used to not be so controversial.
@implynotinfer Not at all. Just compare the evidence against Kavanaugh in this case with some of the other prominent #metoo stories. Accusations in our society do not equal conviction.

@sethmnookin No one has corroborated Ford’s account. Kavanaugh has at least tried to muster some evidence that he is innocent of a crime for which his accuser cannot remember the date or location. Accusations are not proof, even in confirmation hearings and job interviews.
@sethmnookin Right. And if Kavanaugh is telling the truth, it’s hard to not see the whole thing as a witch trial.
@sethmnookin I think it’s simpler. Kavanaugh believes he is being smeared. So does Lindsey Graham. This is not an allegory about privilege, it’s revulsion at what they see as Kafkaesque justice.
@sethmnookin Do you really believe that?

@propornot I think he’s acting politically. And if he is going to make these grave allegations he needs to back them up. Also he has lied before. See 2014 SSCI Black site investigation.
@propornot Disagree. He has an obligation to go public with what he knows. Trump is breaking norms but so is Brennan. Until he puts up, I won’t take him seriously.
