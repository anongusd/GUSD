His murderers were never brought to JUSTICE because of racism, hatred and state-sanctioned violence against people of color. Although his life was short, the impact of his death reminds us that we must fight for JUSTICE at all cost.  #CBCFALC18
Over 50 years ago, Emmett Till was brutally slain in cold-blooded murder. His senseless death was a rallying point for the Civil Right Movement, and rightfully so. At 14-years old, his life was taken and he never got the chance to reach his full potential. #CBCFALC18 https://t.co/1yO9xYjFcr

When ‚Äúthey‚Äù ask you why does diversity matter, or why aren‚Äôt black women heard from ... point them to the stats. #CBCFALC18: The Dream Still Demands!!!
To date, There have been TEN Black senators to serve in the United States Senate (let that sink in). Only 2 of those Senators have been Black women. The 1st being Sen. Carol Moseley Braun (Elected 1993) and the 2nd being  Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Elected 2017). #CBCFALC18 https://t.co/Hu8t2xaqQm
What does your DREAM still Demand of YOU? #CBCFALC18 https://t.co/H8pfr0yIPg
The late Rep. Shirley Chisholm was one of many Black women that blazed a trail and set an example of how to fight for justice in an oppressive world. #CBCFALC18
Since 1968 and beyond, we‚Äôve needed black women to lead and our community; however, they often get the short end of the stick when it comes to pay equity, gender equality, and recognition. It is high time that we make it a priority to TRUST and RESPECT Black women. #CBCFALC18 https://t.co/ee9Ha4SLdd
