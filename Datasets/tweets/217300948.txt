So, in conclusion, saying that you were quoting Mussolini from Hayek's "Road to Serfdome" either indicates you haven't really read Hayek much or that you have and you still think he's an appropriate person to quote. Your choice @JohnCornyn.
Also fellow (and better) economist Lord Kaldor slammed Hayek's position on dictatorships with this: 	"If we take Professor Hayek literally, a fascist dictatorship of some kind should be regarded as the necessary pre-condition (along with monetarism) of a ‚Äòfree society‚Äô."
Including this absolute chestnut from Hayek when asked about his support for Pinochet:	"You can have economic freedom without political freedom, but you cannot have political freedom without economic freedom."		What a great guy to be quoting!
A truly horrible book regardless. Hayek is a complete piece of shit. To be fair to Sen. Cornyn though, Hayek does negatively cite Mussolini in the book, which is surprising due to Hayek's support of fascists later on like Pinochet. https://t.co/jQuykaw15i

@Collegebound973 @EcoSexuality @IsraeliPM Ah I didn't realize it was from others as well. I'm not sure where they got that, but the phrase I'd say is rather cut-and-dry as "war in Iran". Combat in hebrew is ◊ú◊ó◊ô◊û◊î	which is related to the word for war ◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊î, but they used ◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊î which straight up means war.

I'm not an art expert by any means either. My point is that a lot of this is so incredibly basic and important in this discussion that you'd either have to be wholly incompetent or trying to mislead your audience if you're Robert Florczak. I'm not sure which is worse honestly.
Honestly, the lack of any mention of Manet in teaching about the evolution of art to Modern Art and beyond is just a bad lesson plan. He could have at the very least just done a comparison between Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia to try to shit on modern art. https://t.co/OV5nZJ3Wwy
Now, I wonder what Florczak's students would think if that was the discussion. Does this not fit into Florczak's (bad) theory of universal standards for art? What issue is there with this piece of art?
Essentially, Manet painted this and applied for it to be displayed in the Salon (a prestigious gallery in Paris run by the Acad√©mie) and it was rejected and instead placed in the Salon des Refus√©s (the rejected works from the Salon). https://t.co/FTsICO3tHn
Also, it is absolutely fascinating for an Art "Professor" for taking about the impressionists rebelling against the Acad√©mie and not talk, at least a little bit, about the Manet incident in the Saloon de Refus√©s. It's incredibly pivotal in the start of the modern art movement.
To clarify the latter point, "Modern Art" is an era of art from the mid-19th to mid-20th century. It includes some pretty universally agreed upon great art like van Gogh or Matisse. Florczak defined Modern Art as Modern Art + Contemporary Art.
I finally watched that Prager video on Modern Art and I have lots of thoughts. There's the obvious cherry picking, which lots of people have pointed out. There's also the complete misuse of the term "Modern Art".

This plays off of the well known dislike of England in France at the time the play take places and continues in the tradition of French people referring to not great stuff as English like the usage of the term "English Malady" to be slang for syphilis.
The usage of the bastardized "bon viveur" instead of the more standard "bon vivant" is emblematic of the view of people in the underworld as fundamentally not part of the same segment of society and this term represents such by having a Frenchman use an English bastardization.
TBH Thernardier using the term "bon viveur" is one of the single best apparent throwaway lines that provides a fair amount of exposition in and of itself.

Addendum III: A ton of commentary on this (including my own, regrettably) doesn't really take POC Jews into account at all and they very much do exist and are valid. I apologize for that.
Addendum II: Here is Baldwin's piece itself. I don't agree with everything in it, but it's quite important to read nonetheless and definitely gives an important perspective on the issue. https://t.co/WQkU0QPA4B
Addendum I: Baldwin's point hasn't been statistically borne out in a significant way, but I also don't think that this piece that I'm linking that tried to do it fully understood Baldwin's central thesis: https://t.co/6G583sPK29
All this is to say, Meek's tweet sucks and is wrong and fucked, but also we need to talk about context.
Having said that, that fact alone shouldn't excuse anti-semitism and doesn't excuse anti-semitism. It's really a complex topic that largely does also derive from capitalist forces, which are largely quite happy with marginalized groups being pitted against one another.
I largely think that these are issues that really do need to be discussed more out in the open and actually talked about. The exploitation of black communities by anyone is unacceptable and there was statistically a disproportionate chance that Jews were doing that.
Back to Baldwin for a second, he notes something similar to this in saying that the root of anti-semitism among black people is tied to the christian world.
This isn't particularly different from the European Renaissance where anti-semitism spiked and was very commonly found in works from that time period in much more disgusting and explicit ways. This can also be seen in rises of xenophobia at the same time as the Renaissance.
The Harlem Renaissance was truly an amazing time for art and culture; however, with underlying anti-semitic views due to the exploitative business owners in Harlem who were Jewish, the views were present in works from that era.
This is all to say, that these landlords, grocers, and butchers were awful and exploitative towards Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. This timing is rather crucial to my thesis.
This isn't wholly inaccurate, but it also doesn't tell the full story. Baldwin opens his piece talking about the exploitative Jewish landlords, grocers, and butchers in Harlem. Furthermore, up until 1935 these stores didn't employ black people.
First, we can look to James Baldwin's seminal essay in 1967 "Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White". Baldwin posits that anti-semitism is largely due to anti-white attitudes in black communities and that there were specifically many Jews who took advantage.
Having said that, this is probably a good time to talk about how anti-semitism from anyone is completely unacceptable, but also, we need to talk about some context for the rather complex relationship between Jews and Black people in this country.

@worstsong But largely when it comes to things like Journalism, I think that until a better option on the whole is both provided AND becomes more prevalent the usage of Signal is still welcomed. Doing GPG encryption manually works as well, but Signal does it more easily for you.
@worstsong I think with regards to "soft power" pedaling, that's a pretty good point on the whole and is a serious problem. It is definitely being funded by the US because they think it can help spark regime changes overseas.
@worstsong Fair points, but I think the purpose of Signal is largely less to do with avoiding federal prosecution than just having a conversation that is less likely to be intercepted due to the encryption. I agree that Signal or Tor alone won't be enough to subvert the state.
Journalists with PGP Keys and/or Signal info in their bio are fantastic on the whole TBH. It shows a respect for security culture.

Speaking of team names, the 1916 World Series was actually between the Boston Red Sox and the Brooklyn Base Ball Club, but the team nickname for Brooklyn was much more commonly the Robins at the time and not the Dodgers.
Wilbert Robinson, the manager for Brooklyn in 1916, was a founding business partner for the 1901 Baltimore Orioles who went on to move to New York in 1903 and changed their name to the Highlanders and then in 1913 changed their name to the Yankees.
Joseph Lannin sold the Red Sox to the infamous Harry Frazee in 1917. This introduced years of misfortune to the Red Sox.
A few baseball notes about the 1916 World Series between the Red Sox and Dodgers:	Despite Fenway being built in 1912 (and being kinda new still even for 1916) he Red Sox played their home games in that World Series at Braves Field because it had a larger capacity

The Dems should have a 5 point centralized campaign message for 2018 &amp; 2020:	‚Ä¢ Medicare for All	‚Ä¢ DC and Puerto Rico Statehood	‚Ä¢ Legalize Marijuana	‚Ä¢ Pack the Court	‚Ä¢ Reinstate Glass-Steagall		All of this is possible and would actually turn people out to the polls.

Imagine if instead the democrats were, say, putting ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù on the ballot or ‚ÄúNationwide Legalization of Marijuana‚Äù on the ballot. They‚Äôre never going to win if they don‚Äôt run on actual issues that will bring people out to the polls.
Because the democrats can‚Äôt come up with a centralized message they‚Äôre running on ‚Äúhope‚Äù. Of course this is going to result in the Dems somehow not winning back the House despite most historical trends and the extreme unpopularity of the president. https://t.co/Pd7v9eg4FG
