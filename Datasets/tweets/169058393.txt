@KEBrightbill While playing tee-ball, I hit the ball pretty hard. I start running and everyone is yelling. I think they‚Äôre cheering me on. I quickly realize I‚Äôm running the wrong way - toward third base. I reverse course and make it all the way home. I had still scored a home run.

@united I suppose, but I‚Äôm going to go out of my way not to use United again. There is no reason to add insult to injury by making us wait 2 hours at the airport because you lost our bag. All I‚Äôve heard are some cursory apologies. No talk of accountability or rectification for lost time.
@united Bag wasn‚Äôt loaded on to flight. Called to file claim after landing and was told I had to do it in person. Lady at counter was rude and said she wasn‚Äôt trained to file a claim. She told me to wait for available employee. No one came for almost 2 hours.
@united just put on a master class in terrible customer service.
That much more respect for #JohnMcCain seeing that he has a Chessie! https://t.co/FcfRXOwW19
@AriFleischer Hillary spent hours upon hours testifying about Benghazi. She has always been forthright and cooperative. Trump has been the exact opposite.
@ellle_em 42 is gonna be epic!
@DtheDeuceDeuce @jrsalzman So you‚Äôre basically advocating for self-responsibility along with maybe increased involvement of family and clergy?		Do you see how that is the same as advocating for nothing new to be done?		How is this different than accepting school shootings as an acceptable reality?
@DtheDeuceDeuce @jrsalzman How do we change hearts and minds? Just leave it up to the same entities that have failed us to date?
@jrsalzman I‚Äôm a liberal and I blame the shooter. Obviously he was ultimately responsible for his actions.		I hope and pray blaming the shooter prevents future school shootings.		See how dumb that last bit sounds?		There is plenty of blame to go around. How about some actual solutions?
Trump introduces candidate as ‚Äúa good person‚Äù followed immediately by asking ‚Äúif that means anything anymore‚Äù because candidate is ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù. Yes @realDonaldTrump , being a good person still matters.
@Maptitude @AriFleischer The efficiency gap measurement is the way to make things fair but damage has been done and the underlying issue needs to be addressed by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, hypergerrymandering polarized parties toward base - a bad thing for compromise and democracy.
@AriFleischer The march to the left is the natural consequence of the redistricting efforts undertaken by the Republican Party using Maptitude. The left and right will continue drifting further to their respective extremes. For the sake of our democracy districts have to be divided fairly.
@dennisbaxley comparing assault rifles and child massacre to spoons and obesity as an analogy is sickening.    A person might choose to overeat (obesity is actually much more complicated than this) but those who died in Parkland had no choice. Sensible gun laws now!

@mike4libertyCA @JIMDESPO @michellemalkin You're conflating the two issues. Plus, percentage of whites killed by whites is comparable. We should all want equal treatment from gov.
@mike4libertyCA @JIMDESPO @michellemalkin Police brutality and wider systemic racism is real. I look forward to a leader who will unite us on addressing these issues. Trump divides.

@shiawein @ProFlowers That's a separate issue and has nothing to do with Sean Hannity spreading lies and needlessly causing a family grief.
@shiawein @ProFlowers The entire US intelligence community says the Russians leaked the DNC e-mails. That's how you know it's not true.

@FredLeeOtt @FoxNews I don't think reporters ever perceived Hillary as 'unfit' for office.
@FoxNews Trump's bumbling campaign led to notion that he is unfit to serve. Once elected, the perception of his incompetence didn't just disappear.
@stevenmnuchin1 How can you say that Trump has given more disclosure than anyone re: taxes? Americans want and deserve to see his taxes!
@mitchellvii You're joking right? Are there any campaign promises at all you think he didn't keep? China as currency manipulator? NATO as obsolete?
@realDonaldTrump I wish you were as concerned about good governance and transparency as you are about your approval ratings. Sad!
@AriFleischer Did Obama center his campaign on a gay marriage stance that he later reversed? You aren't comparing apples to apples.
