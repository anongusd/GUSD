Check out the bipartisan effort to reduce unintended pregnancies in #NH. #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics https://t.co/MHOUu4Z9oo

Grateful to have the support of Dr. Ellen Joyce, an OB/GYN &amp; Chair of ACOG in #NH, who served on the bipartisan commission that unanimously endorsed #SB421. @AGOGAction #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics https://t.co/UIIAXioKY3
‚ÄúACOG supports #SB421 because it builds on current #NH protections that guarantee women access to affordable contraception &amp; all the benefits that come with consistent use,‚Äù says Dr. Joyce, OB/GYN #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
And, Dr. Joyce adds, researchers observed a 46% reduction in the odds of an abortion when women received a 1-year supply of #birthcontrol. #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
Dr Joyce: When women received a 1-year supply of contraceptives, instead of just a 1-3 month supply, researchers observed a 30% reduction in the odds of unintended pregnancy. #nhpolitics @ACOGAction #Fight4ACCESS
‚ÄúDispensing a greater supply of birth control at one time is associated with fewer repeat visits, greater contraceptive continuation, and a reduction in the likelihood of an unintended pregnancy, especially for women living in rural #NH,‚Äù says Dr. Joyce #nhpolitics #SB421
43% of pregnancies in #NH are unintended. Forty. Three. Time to #Fight4ACCESS and make affordable contraception easier to access. #nhpolitics
Women use birth control for a variety of reasons ‚Äî  58% of all women who use the pill rely on it, at least in part, for something other than pregnancy prevention, including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, fibroids, and menstrual regulation. #nhpolitics
According to @CDCGov, #birthcontrol is 1 of the Top 10 public health achievements of the past century because it is so vital to the health and wellbeing of women and their families. It‚Äôs time to #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics #SB421
‚ÄúIncreased access to contraception gives women the ability to plan their educational, financial, and professional futures &amp; it allows women to decide if and when they want to start a family, time births.‚Äù -Dr. Joyce #SB421 #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics
Thank you Rep. William Marsh for cosponsoring #SB421 and for joining us today to kick off the NH ACCESS campaign - Advancing Contraceptive Coverage and Economic Security Statewide! #Fight4ACCESS #SB421 #nhpolitics https://t.co/dgKzRPmTeZ
‚ÄúBirth control has helped me, and millions of women across the world, avoid unintended pregnancies. The ability to decide whether and when you want to have children is one of the cornerstones of economic security for women. Please support #SB421.‚Äù -Kali #nhpolitics #fight4ACCESS https://t.co/YeNNaSckNA
#SB421 will help patients like Kali ensure they have access to the contraception they need to ensure continued coverage and continuity of use - which will lead to better health outcomes for women. #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics
When used perfectly, the pill is 99% effective. A small deviation from perfect use can lead to a pregnancy. Forgetting pills, not refilling a prescription on time, and losing the pack, are all top reasons people who rely on the pill get pregnant.
In college, Kali spent a semester at sea, traveling 25,000 miles by boat and visiting 4 continents over 3 ¬Ω months. She could only get a #birthcontrol prescription for 3 months though.
Thank you Kali Wampler, a #NH native who works in Concord and lives in Weare with her husband and daughter, for speaking up to protect access to #birthcontrol. #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
#NH has a long tradition of respecting the personal, private health decisions of individuals, and access to basic preventative health services like contraception is not a controversial issue. 96% of voters support women having access to #birthcontrol! #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
#SB421 saves doctors time &amp; saves insurance companies administrative and shipping costs says Rep. Marsh. "It's a good bill for everybody." #Fight4ACCESS #nhpolitics
Rep. William Marsh highlights #SB421 was unanimously recommended by bipartisan, multi-stakeholder commission. 19 members included 5 MDs, 3 nurses, 5 pharmacists, DHHS reps &amp; health care advocates/orgs. #nhpolitics #fight4ACCESS
Thank you Sen. @DonnaSoucy for cosponsoring #SB421 &amp; for all you do to improve affordable access to #birthcontrol in #NH! #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS https://t.co/ovNZdLvjzY
‚ÄúAllowing for 12 month dispensing is a simple, straightforward policy to remove a well-documented barrier to access, reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy, and help Granite State women plan their futures and care for their families.‚Äù @donnasoucy #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
Sen. @DonnaSoucy highlights #SB421 keeps no cost-sharing protections for contraceptives &amp; requires public &amp; private insurance plans to cover a 12-month supply of prescribed, self-administered contraceptives (ie: the ring, patch, or oral contraceptives) at one time. #nhpolitics
#SB421 enhances #NH‚Äôs current ‚ÄúContraceptive Equity Law‚Äù established in 1999, which required insurance companies that cover prescription medication to also cover contraceptives. #nhpolitics
‚ÄúContraception is basic, preventive health care for women that has improved the lives of women and families for generations.‚Äù @DonnaSoucy #nhpolitics #Fight4ACCESS
