@Icecinder @Psycho1454 @DeniseRyanEvent @lyndacicciari @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MedicaidGov #DACA, AKA Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was an #ExecutiveOrder @BarackObama issued to prioritize deporting adults who commit crimes here, over children who were brought here as minors, and have obeyed the law while here.	A #DACA case hasn’t been heard by the #SCOTUS.
@DeniseRyanEvent @Icecinder @Psycho1454 @lyndacicciari @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MedicaidGov …Before the #ACA, I spent $1,203/month for refills of my #Narcolepsy medicine until a reached a $5,000 deductible. Now I pay just $40/month as a copay, for twice as many of the exact same pills, even before I reach my $625 deductible!
@DeniseRyanEvent @Icecinder @Psycho1454 @lyndacicciari @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MedicaidGov In 2013, I spent 55% of my small income from helping disabled people on healthcare due to my #PreexistingConditions.

When workers earn a living wage, they spend that money in their communities getting the things they need. Then they shop in our communities for those things. This helps the businesses where they shop hire &amp; pay new employees to keep up with the new demand. https://t.co/OCsvstBUfN

@mindylee26 @SassyKadiK @realDonaldTrump Even people with disabilities are quite capable of being assholes in their own right.

@mindylee26 @SassyKadiK @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha!!

@mindylee26 @SassyKadiK @realDonaldTrump As someone who works for people with disabilities, I can sympathize with @realDonaldTrump’s intellectual, &amp; social deficits.

@PaulTopping @krassenstein There are times when #PresidentialPardons make sense. To reduce the sentence for nonviolent crimes, or taking unusual mitigating circumstances into account.

@TheRightMelissa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @CNN 🐃💩.
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BillClinton …But #GDubyaShrub was more interested in settling #DaddyBush’s grudge w/#Saddam. Even after #Osama orchestrated 9/11, #Shrub took the attention off of #alQaeda to hunt for the #Iraqi dictator. #Rumsfeld’s short sighted war plan resulted in a bloody quagmire, &amp; the rise of #ISIL.
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN @BillClinton …@BillClinton also made great efforts to eliminate #Osama during his presidency with missile strikes on his believed location, &amp; provided the incoming #GWBush administration w/plenty of actionable intelligence about #alQaeda’s deadly intentions…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN …One of the best things @BillClinton did was intervene on behalf of #BosnianMuslims to stop the #SerbianChristians efforts at genocide in #EasternEurope. This likely prevented #alQaeda from getting involved, &amp; potentially gaining a foothold in #EasternEurope in the mid1990s…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN …In the wake of defeating the #Soviets, #Osama &amp; the #ArabMujahideen felt empowered. They decided to establish #alQaeda to wage a global war on their enemies. That’s when they perceived that we were invading their sacred territories for corrupt reasons, and turned against us…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN …Those #US bases infuriated the #ArabMujahideen fighters we had sent to #Afghanistan. They were rivals with the #SaudiRoyals. They felt that the #US had manipulated them to get them out of #Arabia, so we could invade their holy homeland…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN …#GHWBush made his personal fortune refining #Saudi oil in #Texas. So to prevent #Saddam from seizing the #Saudi oil fields as well, he set up #US bases in the Kingdom to protect the #SaudiRoyals, and their assets…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN …At the same time, #StRonnyRaygun built up #Saddam in #Iraq to fight a proxy war w/#Iran (while secretly selling weapons to #Iran as part of the #IranContraScandal). Then #DaddyBush lost control of #Saddam, &amp; the dictator invaded #Kuwait…
@mess_haythem @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @CNN Actually, other than backing the #Shah in #Iran, it was #RonaldWilsonReagan’s (666) decision to pay for #Osama &amp; #ArabMujahideen fighters to go to #Afghanistan in the 1980s to wage a “holy war” against the #Soviets that got many of our modern troubles in the #MiddleEast started…
@Snowsman51 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump @CNN 🎯	Scary that nearly 70yrs after it was first published, #1984 has become more relevant than ever today… 😱
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Modern Wars are not won on maps. As long as people falsely believe that we are at war with their Religion, they will continue to seek to do us harm. @realDonaldTrump’s foolish attempts at a #MuslimBan, &amp; his ignorant rhetoric regarding #Islam has perpetuated this dangerous myth.
@smugbunny @JordanUhl @IlhanMN …These are the reasons #Refugees from Central &amp; SouthAmerica are seeking #Asylum in the #US. We destabilized their countries out of #ColdWar paranoia. Now we owe it to the victims to provide them shelter here, from the horrors we unleashed in their countries back then.
@smugbunny @JordanUhl @IlhanMN TRUTH!! The results of our paranoid attempts to stop “Socialist” boogie men in Central &amp; SouthAmerica during the #ColdWar was the exploitation of their labor &amp; resources by #US companies, &amp; decades of armed conflict that empowered the Drug Cartels &amp; Gangs…
@topherpsu @MLeeBaxter1 @750AeroChick @Flashbakx @krassenstein Yes! Everyone has a #1stAmendment to speak with their Representatives. And donations to the collective campaign pool could even be tax deductible (as should any donation that reduces the burden on taxpayers). But there wouldn’t be direct donations to any specific campaigns.
@MLeeBaxter1 @750AeroChick @topherpsu @Flashbakx @krassenstein Citizens, even those representing corporate interests, need to be able to petition their govt for a redress of their grievances. That’s one of Our founding principles. What we need to do is rectify the perception that money=speech!
@HermaKarr Technically a #DemocraticRepublic, but it would far better represent the will of We, the People, than the corruption free for all created by Big Money Special Interests in our country post-#CitizensUnited.
This must be the #ArtOfTheDeal that @realDonaldTrump is always talking about… https://t.co/F4y3hYv2RV
@krassenstein This merits a recusal by #AGWilliamBarr in any case which his Son-in-Law is participating in as Counsel. He should not legally be allowed to prosecute a case where his Son-in-Law is on the Defendant’s legal team. That’s a glaring conflict of interest!
@StefanGutenberg @Flashbakx @krassenstein …That’s the crux of #FreeSpeech. Even heinous lies are permissible, provided they are not provably defamatory, or result in an immediate threat to the wellbeing of an individual. So I’d pay for @realDonaldTrump’s lies, so long as his opponents have equal funding to refute them.
@StefanGutenberg @Flashbakx @krassenstein I hear you, &amp; I’m sure whatever message he developed would be heinous, and riddled with misinformation. But at least his opponents would have an equal opportunity to respond, and (unlike now) he would not be beholden to foreign powers, or big money private/corporate donations…
@anniefofani @Cedepca @IlhanMN …And this is why those desperate #Refugees chose to go around the “legal” immigration system:	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
@anniefofani @Cedepca PS: I’ve been to #Guatemala twice through @Cedepca and learned first hand about what caused the dire conditions there. I saw, &amp; heard about the poverty, &amp; violence that these poor families are trying to spare their children from firsthand…
@anniefofani @Cedepca There were certainly #US led coups to overthrow democratically elected govts in #Guatemala, as well as other Central&amp;SouthAmerica countries. But the specific incident @IlhanMN referred to during her questioning occurred in #ElSalvador.
@djwyze1 @JordanUhl @IlhanMN Precisely! The Past is Prologue here. They complain about an “#ImmigrantCrisis,” &amp; claim that they want to cut down on “#IllegalImmigration.” Then they ignore how their own previous, reckless actions are the very impetus for why desperate those #Refugees seek #Asylum here.
@JordanUhl @IlhanMN Thing is, such atrocities never serve our interests in the long run. The long term affects on Central&amp;SouthAmerica were to destabilize their govts &amp; economies, leading to widespread corruption &amp; violence. Those are the very things #Refugees are now coming to the #US to escape.
Should say #ElSalvador, not #Guatemala, but the #US backed countless similar atrocities in Central&amp;SouthAmerica during the #ColdWar. We helped overthrow democratically elected govts to install puppet dictators, who allowed #US companies to exploit their Labor&amp;Resources.	@Cedepca https://t.co/2f2oLeyvE1
@jewellzz_c @Flashbakx @krassenstein Nothing should have more influence over OUR govt than OUR tax dollars! That’s the entire purpose of Govt Of, By, &amp; For We, the People!
@TheMelyssaK @Flashbakx @krassenstein …Our country was founded on the basis of removing power from the privileged few, and establishing Govt Of, By, &amp; For We, the People! #FreeSpeech would still exist. All are free to volunteer w/campaigns, &amp; speak their mind openly. We can prevent disproportionate influence w/$$$.
@TheMelyssaK @Flashbakx @krassenstein Thanks! I think it’s just practical. It just makes sense to take steps to remove the ability of greedy people, &amp; nefarious groups to #Bribe OUR elected leaders with campaign contributions that most citizens can’t hope to compete with…
@Flashbakx @Angelize424 @krassenstein #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan are capitalist countries, with Private healthcare systems, that prioritizes Patient Care over the profitability of healthcare companies. It is possible to have both, but I fully agree that Patient Care needs to come first!
@Flashbakx @krassenstein Elements of certain groups, and greedy individuals in capitalist systems certainly act evil. The idea of capitalism being exclusively merit based is pure fantasy. But I’m not ready to declare all aspects of capitalism inherently evil yet. I believe it could be made more fair.
@Flashbakx @krassenstein …Let the #PharmaBros continue to price gouge their customers for #BonerPills, hair loss treatments, &amp; other cosmetic care. #Insulin, #Epipens, #Inhalers, Cancer drugs, Heart meds, or any product necessary for a reasonable quality life should always be affordable in our country.
@Flashbakx @krassenstein As for the specific issue of #Insulin prices, we should publicly fund all Pharma Research&amp;Development into essential medications. Any drug that Patients can’t be reasonably expected to refuse should be publicly funded to justify means adjusted price caps to make them affordable…
@Flashbakx @krassenstein Citizens do need to be able to lobby, AKA petition their elected leaders for redress of our grievances. That’s part of our #1stAmendment Rights, &amp; fundamental to Govt Of, By &amp; For We, the People. But no one should be able to #Bribe our leaders with Campaign/#SuperPAC donations.
@thoughtsof37 @Flashbakx @krassenstein And I don’t like the idea of supporting xenophobic, misogynists, like @realDonaldTrump, or @mike_pence. But I’m willing to fund even their campaign of lies, if doing so makes them less prone to bribery from the @NRA, #KochBros, #FossilFuel lobbyists, &amp; various #ForeignEmoluments.
@Angelize424 @Flashbakx @krassenstein Yes! And crystal clear clarity regarding who they really work for…
@Flashbakx @krassenstein This would make politicians beholden to their voters. Not special interest groups, corporate lobbyists, or big money donors!
RT @RevChuckCurrie: @VP @IlhanMN The hypocrisy of this Tweet is stunning, Mr. Pence. You serve a president who routinely makes anti-Semitic…

@TrumpHurt @rkfatheree @Airvooocht @DianeKovacs @realDonaldTrump …So the actions of #Reagan (&amp; most other #ColdWar presidents going back to #Eisenhower) weakened their economies with epidemic corruption, &amp; resulted in widespread violence.

@TrumpHurt @rkfatheree @Airvooocht @DianeKovacs @realDonaldTrump #StRonnyRaygun also exacerbated the problems in Central &amp; SouthAmerica by backing coups against democratically elected govts, to appoint puppet dictators who allowed #US companies to exploit their labor, &amp; resources.

@Flashbakx @krassenstein All campaign funding should come from tax payers. Any campaign receiving a number of verifiable petition signatures should receive a set amount of funding that should be subject to public accounting, so voters can see how every penny of our money was spent prior to the election.

@thefairelection @VinceFlammini @DafnaLinzer @kasie @GOP @KPShare @Ford #StRonnyRaygun undermined our economy with his tax cuts for the Rich, embraced the “#MoralMajority,” and set us up for high military spending with his reckless foreign policy endeavors.

@jayess02 @Brooke_Babineau @BethR_27516 @VP @CBP @realDonaldTrump I favor funding all Pharma Research &amp; Development into essential meds, along with govt offering cash rewards for discoveries that lead to Cures for pressing medical problems of our time. This justifies a means adjusted price caps for any meds Patients can’t be expected to refuse.

@MikeGrunwald @MankindisFuture @BillClinton …There are good &amp; bad reasons to run #Deficits. #Deficits to fund programs that allow Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for the things they need are very reasonable. #Deficits from tax cuts for the Rich, wars of conquest, or a useless border #Wall are Not!
@MikeGrunwald @MankindisFuture @BillClinton …After #GHWBush put #US bases in their #Arab HolyLand to protect their #SaudiRoyal rivals’ oil interests from #Saddam, #alQaeda turned against the #US. (FYI: #GHWBush made much of his own personal fortune refining #Saudi oil in #Texas for export around the world🤨)…
@MikeGrunwald @MankindisFuture @BillClinton …In the 1980s, #Reagan paid for #OsamaBinLaden &amp; his #ArabMujahideen fighters to go to #Afghanistan to wage a “holy war” against the #Soviets. After they toppled the #USSR, they formed #alQaeda to wage perpetual war against their enemies by using terrorist tactics…
@MikeGrunwald @MankindisFuture @BillClinton ….Next, #GDubyaShrub came into Office, hellbent on righting #DaddyBush’s wrongs.

Those of us with #PreexistingConditions refuse to go back to that nightmare!
@BethR_27516 @jayess02 @Brooke_Babineau @VP @CBP …I just think the “#NotForProfit”/#NonProfit #BismarckModel is a better fit for the #US, given our country’s devotion to private healthcare.

@BethR_27516 @jayess02 @Brooke_Babineau @VP @CBP I believe #Austrailia, like #Canada, &amp; the #UK, relies on a system similar to the #BeveridgeModel of taxpayers funded, #SinglePayer healthcare. And I’ll say again that I completely agree that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this very effective healthcare system…
@numbersignthis @koreansoul77 @davidhogg111 The problem is the loopholes for gun shows, or private sales. I know we can’t stop all violent criminals from getting guns. But there is plenty more that other countries already do, that we could replicate, and still preserve #2ndAmendment Rights for responsible gun owners.
@pennyparamedic @jlg718 @senatemajldr @GOP True enough. That’s why we need #NONPartisan Districting Committees in every state to draw compact, contiguous, competitive districts in all 50 states…	@1VA2021
@senatemajldr 🐃💩!!!
@HEH8ME76 @krassenstein …A residual force is still required as deterrent. We broke it, so we had to buy it. If we don’t pay now, the consequences will haunt us down the road. That’s why I opposed the 2003 Invasion of #Iraq so much. It was a poorly executed war, based on sham intel, w/ulterior motives.
@HEH8ME76 @krassenstein …We can, &amp; should, continue to work hard to hand all operations over to trusted local allies as soon as they become capable of defending their own populations from those same extremists elements. All responsible leaders want that, but it’s a painfully slow process…
@HEH8ME76 @krassenstein No one wants to be there indefinitely. But abandoning our allies suddenly would leave a vacuum that could be filled by the same kind of radicals who took over #Afghanistan after #RonaldWilsonReagan helped #OsamaBinLaden &amp; his #ArabMujahideen fighters defeat the #Soviets there…
@numbersignthis @koreansoul77 @davidhogg111 Sure. But those who are, have no business owing a gun. And stricter background checks could go a long way in ensuring that it’s more difficult for them to have easy access to deadly weapons. Not perfect, but better than what we’ve got.
@jayess02 @Brooke_Babineau @VP @CBP Nothing wrong w/#Canada’s #SinglePayer system, but the #GermanBismarckModel of Private, NONProfit insurance is a good compromise. Similar models already provide #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan w/#UniversalCoverage at lower costs, &amp; w/better healthcare results. It’d be Great for #US!
@numbersignthis @koreansoul77 @davidhogg111 Technically still a continent, not an island.  It is also part of #Oceania, a geographic region comprised of many islands. You could argue that islands can be part of a continent, such as #Ireland, &amp; #Britain with #Europe. But you cannot claim continents are the same as islands.

@Cryptarchy6 @mvbcdo @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH @werlibertarians @LionsofLiberty One of my own core principles is the protection of those IndividualRights.

@Cryptarchy6 @mvbcdo @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH @werlibertarians @LionsofLiberty So you would rather spend your life raging against taxation, &amp; government… I think my odds of success are better working from within the system to select leaders who align closer to my beliefs, than trying to tear the whole thing down, &amp; hoping that terrible things don’t happen.

@Roni01377462 @krassenstein We don’t want voting to be compulsory. As much as I disagree with their logic, citizens need to have a Right to not vote in protest, should they choose. But we do need to make voting welcoming, convienant, and easy for all citizens to do.
@Cryptarchy6 @mvbcdo @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH @werlibertarians @LionsofLiberty Not at all what I said.

I maintain that it is a childish world view, that disregards the role of privilege &amp; the #CosmicLottery play in determining an individual’s relative success. For example, being born into wealth vs being born w/severe disabilities…
@mvbcdo @spirit_llama @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH I try to respect everyone’s opinions, but there comes a point where you leave all rationality behind. We all know that money has no value beyond what we assign to it, but we do collectively assign value to it as a means of exchanging goods &amp; services. That gives it worth.
@mvbcdo @spirit_llama @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH That’s just the inflation related to currency in circulation. There’s also #DemandPull, &amp; #CostPush inflation. As Demand increases, the price of an item increases, as it becomes more valuable. The price also increases if we artificially add to the cost of production, w/Tariffs.
@mvbcdo @spirit_llama @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH There are plenty of reasons for abandoning the #GoldStandard.	#US currency is the standard around the world bc we’ve had the strongest economy, and therefore the most imports, since #WWII. Since nearly all countries have active exchanges with #USD, its a logistical standard.
@senatemajldr #TRE45ONTurtle 🐢wants more #Russian dressing for he, &amp; Mrs. Turtle’s lettuce… 🥬 💰💵
@Nightingalesfir @krassenstein They’ve been doing this all along. Then, and only then, will the @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse confirm what they say. We’ve learned about multiple #Trump/#Russian interactions this way.
@mvbcdo @spirit_llama @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH 🙄 You might as well say all currency is worthless. You’re not worth debating if you truly have such a childish point of view.
@jerseybigjim @BillKristol Perhaps the #Kompromat is photos of @LindseyGrahamSC in bed with an underage boy…??? 🤞🏻🤞🏽🤞🏿
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH The point is that NOBODY should work full time, &amp; have to rely on public assistance to pay for their basic needs. When the basement of our economy is a sound foundation of sustainability, everything above helps to serve economic Growth through increased Demand for Productivity.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH Interest rates are tied to the rate of inflation in part to compensate for those changes. That’s why interest rates at banks have been so low recently. As long as wages keep pace to make essential commodities affordable, natural inflation can be a sign of a healthy economy.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …A #LivableMinimumWage, tied to a #ConsumerPriceIndex of essentials goods&amp;services can fuel the production necessary to keep prices in check, while also promoting high levels of sustainable productivity. But govts need to enforce it to prevent Greed from choking out Demand!
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …So Inflation can either be a natural part of healthy economic growth, or a symptom of serious economic problems. The difference is the ability of Consumers, AKA Customers, AKA Workers, to exert Demand for the products they want, and/or need in our markets…
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …If wages rise accordingly, #DemandPullInflation can be part of sustainable Growth. Yet #CostPushInflation, which results from non-beneficial increases in the costs of production, like #Tariffs, hurts our potential for economic growth by reducing consumers’ purchasing power…
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …We currently have record low inflation rates. W/near full employment we can expect some natural #DemandPullInflation (Rising costs &amp; wages, as demand exceeds capacity, requiring businesses to hire to increase their supplies to keep up w/demand) as an unavoidable side effect…
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH Yes. And I’m not suggesting that we print more money than is responsible. But the #FederalReserve also gives credibility, and those value to our currency. It’s not money out of nothing. It’s based on the good credit &amp; standing of the #US govt…
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …@SocialSecurity grew out of the #GreatDepression, bc when times got hard, no one was willing to help our most vulnerable independently. @MedicareGov &amp; @MedicaidGov started during the relative prosperity of the 1960s, bc even then our most vulnerable were forgotten.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH It’s a fine dream, but nature is red in tooth &amp; claw. It’s been #TinkleDown economics, &amp; #WallSt’s glorification of profit margins that has all but killed private generosity. Not Public spending to help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for things they need…
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …I’m all for idealistic dreaming. I can imagine peaceful coexistence among all nations. But I can’t pretend that we will ever live in a world where the powerful don’t prey upon the weak. Your idealism would be better served by backing leaders who will stand up for the oppressed.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH Zero inflation? Wouldn’t that mean that savings accounts would accrue zero interest in your imaginary world?	Without govts, who would issue this currency, or guarantee its validity?	Without a minimum wage, you really believe employers wouldn’t try to get away with slave wages?
@indeliblue @JohnUngvarsky @krassenstein I’m not sure they told #AlternativeFactsBarbie anything… She was there exclusively to combat the accurate accusations of misogyny in the @realDonaldTrump Campaign.

@Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid The other more likely scenario is that the majority of Americans do not agree with @RonPaul’s isolationist, “I’ve got mine you get yours,” agenda. It’s fine in some theories, but it falls to pieces in the real world. Not everyone who fails in life is wicked, lazy, or deserves it.
@mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH …I simply can’t imagine these difficult individuals receiving the assistance they need without govt intervention to compel taxpayers to fund it. No 1 would pay for the housing, food, or medical care  of disabled people who lack family support, w/out govt enforcing the tax code.
@mvbcdo @Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @RonPaul @FreeStateNH For anarchy to work, we would need to be a far more generous species. As someone who works for people with disabilities, the sad reality is that not everyone has sufficient family support to survive the challenges life provides independently…
@Cryptarchy6 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 No one benefits from anarchy in the long term. But the powerful are better equipped for it in the short term. Voting can make things significantly better. The key is voters educating themselves about how their votes will affect them.
@Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid While I appreciate some aspects of @RonPaul’s foreign policy platform, other aspects are simply unrealistic. Isolation is not the answer. And his domestic policies would be devastating for our most vulnerable citizens. But if that’s what you think is best, you should work for it.

@Unloco @krassenstein #Putin got @PaulManafort to pick @mike_pence for a reason. @VP #Pence was in charge of the transition that appointed @GenFlynn, an undeclared #ForeignAgent, as our top #NationalSecurityAdvisor. Lil Mikey is gonna be in trouble, &amp; I think #Mother knows it!
@krassenstein @DevinNunes @jaredkushner …Former #AttorneyGeneralJeffersonBeauregardSessionsIII certainly deserves to sit in a #CentralAmerican cage for devising, &amp; enforcing his #FamilySeparation policies. But allowing #Mueller to do his work with out interference from the #DOJ may keep him of the #US prison system.
@krassenstein @DevinNunes would be fabulous, and I’d move @jaredkushner higher up the list. But as much as I loathe him for nearly everything he ever stood for, I think former #AttorneyGeneralJeffersonBeauregardSessionsIII’s recusal may have saved his ass from the pokey in this case…
@ikagirl @Babygirlxx8 @eddiejchavez @krassenstein Indeed… Reinforces the critical nature of Voting every single election we have to keep the greedy, self serving assholes out of Office.
@eddiejchavez @Babygirlxx8 @krassenstein @ikagirl Same smug arrogance. Same violent hatred for those who dare to oppose his ill gotten authority. Same uncompromising ignorance when faced with unfriendly Truths that he’s unwilling to admit to…
@Babygirlxx8 @eddiejchavez @krassenstein @ikagirl Yea, #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini is frighteningly similar to his #Italian dictator counterpart, in more than just appearance. My GrandUncle, who was exactly 70yrs older than me, was a machine gunner, in #Italy, during #WWII. He would be livid if he was alive today!
@JeffreyHann @Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid Having roads, and other infrastructure is essential to our economy, and collective well being. Unless you personally plan on funding all of the country’s infrastructure needs, we must have some means of collectively funding their construction. Taxes provide such a system.
@Cryptarchy6 @JeffreyHann @spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid So elect leaders who will do a better job passing #CriminalJusticeReform to prevent police from pursuing perpetrators of victimless crimes. The answer is not an anarchy, in which the powerful are free to prey on the powerless. We, the People, can fix the problems with Our system.
@JeffreyHann @Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid I read as much of your anarchist’s manifesto as I can stomach. You continually miss the point. If you don’t like how our govt spends our money, work to elect leaders who will do better. We can fix police violence, military abuse, &amp; govt corruption through the ballot box.
@JeffreyHann @freedomstoopid @SouffleOfTheDay @mvbcdo @spirit_llama @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 So elect leaders who’ll be respectful of the Rights of people everywhere. The answer is doing more to elect positive leaders, not refusing to pay taxes that help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans. We can also use those tax dollars to help those Yemeni kids if we vote for it.
@JeffreyHann @Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid The majority of police are public servants trying to serve their communities. A few are hot heads who want to be able to legally shoot people. I’ve not personally encountered any who were errand boys for greedy politicians.
@Cryptarchy6 @spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann I vote for elected officials who strive to change that. That’s the democracy element in the equation. We, the People, have to actively work to elect representatives who work for Us!
@mvbcdo @spirit_llama @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann I would say we have better services than other countries w/lower taxes, but not as high quality as some countries with higher taxes. We spend too much on our military, but do have the best in the world. I’d reallocate some of that to education, disability services &amp; healthcare.
@eddiejchavez @Babygirlxx8 @krassenstein @ikagirl https://t.co/deYeWjFaGQ
@freedomstoopid @SouffleOfTheDay @mvbcdo @spirit_llama @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @JeffreyHann They don’t have absolute power. We, the People, elect them to vote to spend Our money in ways that will benefit All of Us. You just have no idea how our democratic republic works, so you’re calling for anarchy. https://t.co/zbgktRM5w5
@TerriBartoloni @krassenstein On the positive, if he reacts badly enough, Republicans might finally be convinced to remove him from Office…
@karenmblehm @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump can’t “win,” no matter how much damage he tries to inflict on We, the People. We have to show him, &amp; all future @POTUS’s that We are an unacceptable hostage in budget negotiations. Especially for a vanity project of a border #Wall monument to his incompetent ego!
@AngusKerr9 @krassenstein This is a global battle against ignorance. You have our respect, &amp; empathy, but we’ve got our hands full with our own xenophobic Misogynists as it is.

@jilevin I often disagreed with the #McCains on policy, but I cannot question their occasional willingness to stand up to their own @GOP on principle when they deem it morally necessary.
@healeydickinson @ALParkTucker2 @ProudResister @M_Looper #Gerrymandering, &amp; their own #RightWing propaganda killed their ability to compromise.
@ProudResister @dmmlauterio **#Rubles. It’s all about getting those #Rubles for the @GOP!
@Doug_Bratman @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump would also do well to read:	#USConstitution, #Article2Section4-	“The @POTUS, @VP, and all civil officers of the #UnitedStates, shall be removed from office on #Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes, &amp; Misdemeanors.”
@Doug_Bratman @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump should start with the #USConstitution:	#Article2Section2Part1-	“…(@POTUS) shall have power to grant reprieves, and pardons for offenses against the #UnitedStates, EXCEPT in cases of #Impeachment.”
@Resonater @KevinMKruse His base still buys it. He has to convince them he hasn’t forsaken their xenophobic zeal, or they will turn on him…
@realworldrj @KevinMKruse #PelosiPower!
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann Let me put it this way. My work is to provide services to people with disabilities. The bulk of my income comes through @MedicaidGov, bc the overwhelming majority of people w/disabilities could never afford even my meager wages independently. Charity would never substitute that.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann I’m in no way advocating for authoritarianism. I simply accept that taxes are the price we pay for high quality govt services. To pretend otherwise is to be intentionally obtuse.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann I want a govt elected by We, the People, that respects our Rights to Privacy, Freedom of Conscience, Rights for Prisoners &amp; the Accused, and is a Peaceful in influence in Global Community. We can elect just such a govt, if we don’t fall for fear mongering, or succumb to greed.
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann We, the People, should do more at the ballot box to prevent our country from playing #WorldPolice, and bombing innocent civilians. But we need a functional govt to provide for the common good, &amp; for the defense of our communities from All Enemies. Both Foreign, &amp; Domestic!
@spirit_llama @mvbcdo @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @JeffreyHann No! Then you get the whole, “why should I be paying for something everyone else gets to use?” Or even bigger inconsistencies in services across the country. Altruism isn’t a realistic way to provide for the common good. Everyone needs to do their part through compulsory taxes.
@strong_sue @eye2winner I believe #Bannon was a source for several leaks to the media, &amp; has gone about saving his own saggy, wrinkly, racist hide ever since leaving the @WhiteHouse by talking to whomever will listen to him. He seems to have been a big source for @realBobWoodward’s book, “#Fear.”
@eye2winner @strong_sue @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump …Only once #Mueller has @realDonaldTrump dead to Rights, will he bag &amp; tag @DonaldJTrumpJr (#DumbFredo), &amp; @jaredkushner (#TheBoyWonder), who both have clear cases of Conspiracy &amp; Corruption against them. So the whole #TrumpCrimeFamily will all go up the river together! https://t.co/m0CIUyWqa4
@eye2winner @strong_sue @DonaldJTrumpJr is ripe to go. But I suspect #DumbFredo will be the last to fall, because @realDonaldTrump’s reaction will be so violent, he’s likely to try to pull the plug on everything. #Mueller will want to have everything else already in place before then…
@eye2winner @strong_sue That’s what I suspect. He was pretty clearly a source for @realBobWoodward’s book, “#Fear,” which, while still confirming #SteveBannon’s repugnant #Nationalist/#AntiGlobalist perspective, manages to portray him as someone critical of @realDonaldTrump’s ignorance &amp; incompetence.
RT @eye2winner: Also, check out how Trump messed up in Venezuela, not brought out by MSM in regard to USA's support of coup: https://t.co/F…
@TennesseeNeNe @JamesACorder1 @LisPower1 @GovMikeHuckabee The #ChristianRight is neither… They ignore #Jesus’s call to care for the least among us for the sake of heaping more treasure on the Rich. They are the equivalent of modern day #Pharisees!

@rosario_619 @DisavowTrump20 @newf93 @TeamPelosi Soon… #MuellerIsComing!!
#PelosiPower saves Americans $5.7Billion for a vanity border #Wall monument to @realDonaldTrump’s xenophobic incompetence! https://t.co/JHKeivQi0R
@eye2winner #PelosiPower &amp; #WomanPower are real. But it’s not up to @SpeakerPelosi alone to keep the country open now. She must stand for the majority of We, the People to not waste Our tax money on a useless border #Wall monument to @realDonaldTrump’s incompetence, &amp; xenophobia.
@JeffreyHann @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @mvbcdo @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama #TaxationWITHRepresentation is what our #Founders fought for. The Right to have the money they pay in taxes go towards improving their own communities, instead of lining the pockets of a monarch thousands of miles away. And Not for complete anarchy either!
@JeffreyHann @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @mvbcdo @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama In a democratic republic, citizens get a say in how much we pay. Don’t act like you are being oppressed. Slaves didn’t have the option to leave. You are free to go wherever you want. The options with lower taxes generally suck, because taxation is the price of good governance.
@JeffreyHann @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @mvbcdo @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama Again, if you want to go with someone else to provide those services, you have the option to move to another country… Taxation is the price of citizenship, all over the world. It’s not a “monopoly.” It’s a #SocialContract! Taxes are lower in countries w/weaker govts.
@mvbcdo @SouffleOfTheDay @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann How the hell could govt function without taxes? Who would pay for officers to enforce our laws? Who would pay for our military to protect us from foreign enemies? Who would build our roads? Educate our children? Provide for our poor, elderly &amp; disabled citizens? Who would #MAGA?
@mvbcdo @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama @KellyScaletta @JeffreyHann Read up on #SocialContractTheory. A fundamental principle our #Founders based our govt on is the theory that citizens give up some absolute freedoms (like the freedom to steal, rape, murder, or not pay taxes), to gain protection from others who might harm them, or their property.
@mvbcdo @KellyScaletta @BenedictCruz11 @freedomstoopid @spirit_llama @JeffreyHann You can’t live a good life without interacting with a state, bc states provide their citizens with good, safe lives. But if you like anarchy so much, you could always move to #Somalia…
@freedomstoopid @spirit_llama @KellyScaletta @JeffreyHann 2nd half of “steal” definition: “…or legal Right…”	The #USConstitution grants the govt the Right to levy taxes to pay for the protection, &amp; common good of our citizens. Without taxes, we can’t fund our military, our customs, or any other programs that provide for our wellbeing.

@ThatOneConserv @derrickquigley @realDonaldTrump That wasn’t my intention. Of course anyone is free to pray quietly to themself at anytime they want.

@ThatOneConserv @derrickquigley @realDonaldTrump #1stAmendment:	“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…”		You can pray when, or wherever you please.

@kaisiobhan @owillis @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Ah! Ok, I was unaware. Not that it impacts her ability to lead our country in a positive direction, but it’s nice to know!
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP …Why would someone with a low ability level break their back, or waste their time doing a job that ultimately won’t pay their bills? There’s dignity in earning a living, but if that’s not possible, why kill them self toiling just to make someone else even richer?
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP That’s the problem with criticisms of “#EntitlementPrograms.” They depict entire programs as lacking merit, bc a minority of the recipients somehow don’t deserve them. The Truth is that until we have a #LivableMinimumWage, there is no motive for low ability workers to seek jobs…
@worldtosing @leslietfj @IndOgburn @owillis I believe it was actually the #Dutch who originally abducted #Africans to sell as slaves in the #Americas. But both #Spanish, &amp; #British colonists supported the slave trade here, &amp; in #Jamaica, by paying for those enslaved human beings.
@kaisiobhan @owillis **#NativeCaribbeanAMERICAN, not #Indian…😉 But you’re right! The most important thing is that @KamalaHarris is a brilliant, articulate leader, who is capable of leading our country out of the @realDonaldTrump disaster. We’ll have to see how things go in the primaries for now.
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP …It’s also why all policies must cover the #EssentialHealthBenefits the @GOP is allowing junk policies to exclude. If people pick &amp; choose what they want coverage for, only those who develop certain expenses have to pay for them, making those #PreexistingConditions unaffordable.
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP …It also provides barriers for getting coverage once a #PreexistingCondition is developed. It’s better to have penalties against those who can afford insurance, but refuse to take #PersonalResponsibility for their potential healthcare liabilities by not to obtaining coverage…
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP …That leaves Insurers w/an expensive pool of subscribers to cover, without any healthy subscribers to mitigate their costs.

So many will assess that it’s worth it to save money now, by waiting to pay the penalty if they get sick, or injured later…
@Spseansp @ChiliDog304 @mommy2712 @WendyPinNJ @chopper2424 @GbengaAkande2 @DrVogelmann @KarenCampanile @beckyfs22 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @GOP Changes in policy being put through by @GOP effectively put people w/#PreexistingConditions at risk. The best way to make health insurance affordable for everyone is an #IndividualMandate for all citizens to get coverage, along with requirements for employers to offer coverage…
@daydreamer519 @Mikel_Jollett @kharyp That too! A new @DNC @POTUS, with a #BlueHouse &amp; Majority @SenateDems could accomplish much to reverse the terrible policies of this @realDonaldTrump error.

@DbjSan @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP I completely agree! Insurers should receive reasonable salaries for facilitating payments between Patients, &amp; Providers. But they shouldn’t be allowed to deny legitimate claims for the sake of making astronomical profits. Insurers should always default to better Patient Care…

@Srmconsult @LeftOfCentre7 @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Precisely my point! They have a Private system designed to put the needs of Patients over Insurance Profits.

@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP …Let a neutral govt agency, like @US_FDA, or @HHSGov, police MedicalProviders for fraudulent billing.	And there should def be a #PublicOption to buy into @MedicareGov to act as a PaceCar  on the insurance markets by competing with Private plans. Let the markets prove your point!
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP …#GermanBismarckModel requires All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders to collectively bargain to set rates for All services annually. Then, when a Licensed Provider has a bill for their subscribers, an Insurer has to automatically pay. No Networks. No Prior Authorizations. No 🐃💩!
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Insurers do need to be more heavily regulated to prevent them from denying legitimate medical claims to increase their profits. But someone needs to manage medical billing. It doesn’t matter if it’s Public, or Private, as long as Patient Care comes 1st…
@BrendaACrowe1 @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP That’s a different model, similar to #MedicareForAll/ #SinglePayer. There’s nothing wrong w/that model. But it’s genuinely govt run healthcare, which given their own glaring incompetence, scares the 💩 out of @GOP lawmakers… #GermanBismarckModel is Private, NONProfit healthcare.
@LeftOfCentre7 @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Again, that’s the #BeveridgeModel of #SinglePayer, govt run healthcare. The #GermanBismarckModel is Private, NONProfit Insurance. Funded primarily through required contributions from employers, with govt subsidies for individuals, or businesses that can’t afford it independently.

@venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TRReidAuthor …By taking steps to reduce the costs to Providers of practicing medicine, and allowing Doctors to collectively bargain with Insurers to set the rates for all medical medical services annually, we could easily compensate for the problem of underpaying MedicalProviders.
@venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TRReidAuthor Amen! It’s an excellent guide for how different healthcare models work around the world, and what their potential pitfalls are. The biggest complaint with the #GermanBismarckModel is underpaying Providers. But the countries that use it pay for training, &amp; malpractice insurance…

@RepublicanSwine Good riddance to the Weasel/Snake/Worm, @SpeakerRyan. We will not miss his Deceitful, Venomous, and Spineless “leadership!” He passed his reckless tax cuts for the Rich to give us more than a $Trillion in #Deficits over the next decade, with no long term economic benefits. Shame!
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @krassenstein This says it all! Jesus said in #Matthew25:45 that he will judge us according to how we treat the least among us:	“Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.”
@terry_sam6 @sancorn @Jonnie18 @krassenstein @Sir_Bradford @realDonaldTrump I completely agree that kids, especially teenagers, do dumb shit without thinking. And while this was egregiously stupid for a British Royal, it was on the whole an innocent, childish kind of stupid, with no long term consequences. Harry has indeed grown into a mature young man!
@LisaFybush @sancorn @Jonnie18 @krassenstein @Sir_Bradford @realDonaldTrump Very True! They clearly take after their Mother, who @eltonofficial rightly pointed out was a #CandleInTheWind! I’m sure it’s difficult growing up in that glaring spotlight, but they’ve done much to make their dear Mum proud these days.
@mlanger @nancy_annmarie @RickSchaler @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Occasionally these trolls provide a good opportunity to point out the utter absurdity of RightWing politics. They rely exclusively on ad hominem attacks, rather than thoughtful discourse. My skin is thick enough to take it, &amp; in the process they reveal their own ignorance.
@boydman1124 @sancorn @Jonnie18 @krassenstein @Sir_Bradford @realDonaldTrump 1 of my favorite monikers for #AgentOrange! It achieves 3 things:	1) Ridicules his ridiculous spray tan, &amp; absurd vanity.	2) Points out his #Fascist tendencies, &amp; proclivity towards authoritarianism.	3) Rightly compares him to #Mussolini, the idiotically inept ally of #Hitler.
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO I agree. The old system was completely untenable. There is absolutely no benefit to a For Profit health insurance system without strict regulations for how Insurers must treat Patients, &amp; MedicalProviders. When Insurers act as For Profit businesses, everyone else loses, big time!
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO …The @US_FDA, or @HHSGov could monitor Medical Providers for fraudulent billing. But Insurers w/profit motives for denying legit claims shouldn’t have a say in the process!
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO …The #GermanBismarckModel works by requiring All Insurers, &amp; All Medical Providers to collectively bargain annually to set the rates for All Services. Then if a Licensed Medical Provider bills an Insurer for one of their subscribers, the Insurer must automatically pay…
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO I completely sympathize. Due to #PreexistingConditions from a #BrainTumor in 2006, before the #ACA, I spent 55% of my $20K income from helping people w/disabilities on healthcare.	I had $483 premiums on top of $1,203/month for narcolepsy meds until I reached a $5,000 Deductible…
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO Right! We need to #FixTheACA by eliminating health insurance Profits, subsidizing #Pharma R&amp;D into essential care, and cracking down on employers who don’t provide full time employees w/insurance options, or part time employees w/adequate wages to obtain insurance independently.
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yes! And the #GermanBismarckModel provides #UniversalCoverage to all their citizens by requiring all citizens to obtain coverage, and then subsidizing those who cannot afford it independently.
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP @WHO …It’s not about the quality of care available for the extremely wealthy. It’s about who has access to that care, the costs to patients, &amp; overall life expectancy. I’m all for generous compensation for doctors, nurses, &amp; med techs. But patient care needs to be the first priority!
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Given our economic advantages, in 2000 the #WorldHealthOrganization (@WHO) ranked the #US 37th world wide for our healthcare results. Considering our status as the wealthiest country in the world, with the best medical services available, we should easily be number 1…
@mlanger @KatKenn48 @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Ok, if we’re the richest country in the world, have the top medical schools, &amp; the highest living standards (for the Rich), it makes sense that some of the world’s best medical care will be here too.

@finn_charlene @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP The #GermanBismarckModel relies primarily on employer based insurance. The difference is that the insurers that employers are choosing from are all NONProfit. There are other options, like govt subsidies, for those who cannot work. It’s our system, but with NONProfit Insurance.
@KatKenn48 @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP Just because the #US has some of the best medical care in the world available for the wealthy elite, doesn’t mean that all Americans have access to it.

Versions of the #GermanBismarckModel of Private, NONProfit Insurance provide #Germany, #France, &amp; #Japan w/#UniversalCoverage, at lower costs &amp; w/better results.
@immanu_levi @DericksonDavid @KernowFishy @juliamacfarlane Ok, but we’ve got #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini here in the #US. No doubt you all have some world class bigots, &amp; a few #BungaBungaParty idiots in #Italia. But we have the world’s biggest ass clown around here in the #US! https://t.co/qlNmHNOXQq
@pmo1346 @KernowFishy @juliamacfarlane Shit… We’re falling on our faces attempting a keg stand here in the #US… @realDonaldTrump is an unmitigated disaster, and a #FuckingMoron!! At least a majority of British truly voted for your #Brexit mistake. A 3Million voter majority voted against #IlDoucheCheetolini…
@TweetZameer @krassenstein https://t.co/GqB5fxqKKm
@krassenstein Amen! I still don’t understand how this judge arrived at the decision that bc @GOP weakened the #ACA, it’s somehow unconstitutional to protect #PreexistingConditions, or for govt to help low income workers pay for our health insurance.	PS- I’ve saved $44.4K over 5yrs due to #ACA!
@Nightingalesfir @jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan Don’t forget the #KochBros! Those assholes have bought &amp; paid for their useful moron in my district, @RepMGriffith. He wages their nonexistent #WarOnCoal campaign for them by faithfully pushing to weaken the @EPA, as his constituents are slowly poisoned w/mercury &amp; other toxins.
@SheriffClarke @Avmech1 @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Probably just correct them for going against settled law. The #SupremeCourt has already ruled on the Constitutionality of the #IndividualMandate. This ruling goes against the #SCOTUS’s previous decision, and threatens the healthcare law that has already saved me $44.4K over 5yrs!
@morethanmySLE @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov …We could even offer cash rewards for companies that develop Cures for the pressing medical problems of our time. And #BigPharma could still be allowed to deal their #BonerPills &amp; cosmetic treatments for profit. But no more #PharmaBros getting rich by price gouging for #Epipens!
@morethanmySLE @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov …We could further reduce underlying medical costs by fully funding the Research &amp; Development into essential medical care. This would allow us to set means adjusted price caps on any drugs, or medical technologies that Patients can’t reasonably be expected to refuse…
@morethanmySLE @GOP …We could allow the @US_FDA, or @HHSGov to monitor MedicalProviders to prevent fraudulent billing, and waste. But don’t let Insurers w/profit motives for denying legitimate claims impede Patient care. This would be govt acting in its role as the mediator between citizens…
@morethanmySLE @GOP That’d require all Insurers, &amp; all MedicalProviders to collectively bargain annually to set the rates for all medical services. Then when a licensed Provider has a bill for one of their subscribers, Insurers have to automatically pay.	No networks, no prior authorization, no 🐃💩!
@morethanmySLE Yet this is another opportunity to #FIXtheACA with a compromise between a #SinglePayer system like #Canada &amp; the #UK, &amp; the #SurvivalOfTheRichest system the @GOP wants to go back to. Adopt aspects of the #GermanBismarckModel’s Private, NONProfit aspects of insurance…
@JeffTheGrad @krassenstein @DebraMessing Right!?! If that guy was seriously paying for liberal protesters, he’d owe me some big time back pay, going all the way to #GDubyaShrub’s 2003 #InvasionOfIraq…	AKA #MessOPotamiaVersion3.0
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan You must’ve missed all the spending @BarackObama did as @POTUS44 to prevent our economy, and those Private sector businesses, from going under after deregulation of the markets nearly took us from a #Recession to a #Depression. Govt spending led directly to our current stability.
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …Yet the ideal can be elusive. Reasonable taxes on those who can easily afford them allows us to help those incapable of caring for themselves. It would also let us pay off some of our #Debt, &amp; prepare for the unforeseen problems of the future. TaxCuts jeopardize our stability.
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …As a StandardOperatingProcedure, attaching our #MinimumWage to a #ConsumerPriceIndex (#CPI) of essentials in each community will allow the vast majority of Americans to meet their own needs independently. This is the ideal we should aim for…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …Joseph said that 7yrs of plenty would be followed by 7yrs of famine. He told Pharaoh to collect, &amp; store more supplies during the Boom, to be ready for the Bust. Taxes are similar. We should gather during times of plenty, to be ready for the inevitable famines in our future…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …In the #Bible, when #Joseph who had the pretty coat was in #Egypt, he was asked to interpret the Pharaoh’s dreams. Pharaoh dreamed of 7 fat cows being eaten by 7 scrawny ones. And 7 healthy stalks of grain were replaced by 7 withered ones…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …Tax Cuts can be useful during a crisis to spur short term economic activity. But at a time of near full employment, and economic growth, we’d be better off saving for the next catastrophe, or simply paying down our #Debt. Tax Cuts now deprive us that tool in future disasters…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan I don’t object to accountability. And I wouldn’t have a problem w/#MedicareForAll. But I see a compromise in the #GermanBismarckModel of Private, NONProfit health insurance.	I still say it’s a balancing act, &amp; spending is a net positive in that it directly generates #Demand…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …That #Demand forces the Rich to hire workers to satisfy their customers. #TinkleDown TaxCuts bottles money up. We need to #WaterTheRoots! Provide all full time workers w/#LivableWages, &amp; programs that help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for their needs.
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …Taxing the Rich to pay for programs that help the Poor doesn’t create new money. But it does provide our Poor, Elderly, &amp; Disabled citizens the opportunity to use that money to pay Rich citizens for the things they need…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …Give a Poor man a buck in the morning, it’ll be in a Rich man’s pocket by sundown. The Rich already sell everything the Poor need. So they stand to profit directly from providing the Poor with the resources needed to shop for those things that they need. That’s how it works…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …But us avg workers HAVE to spend our money to meet our needs! We NEED Housing, Food, Healthcare, Childcare, &amp; Transportation. That’s how a #LivableMinimumWage helps employ the workers who provide those services for the majority of the population…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan Concentrating wealth in the hands of the few limits the amount of economic activity. There can only be so many Millionaires &amp; Billionaires. And they only spend so much in our communities to meet their wants &amp; needs. They will only by so many mansions, cars, yachts, etc…
@jcoots43 @michele0921 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …If someone paid $20Billion, is taxed 40%, they may pay $8Billion, but they still have $12Billion left to play.	If someone like me, earning roughly $20K/yr, has to spend 55% of our income on healthcare due to #PreexistingConditions, as I did, that only leaves us $9K to live on.
@jcoots43 @michele0921 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan 🐃💩…The Rich get the bulk of the benefits, including breaks on inheritance taxes. Yes, the Rich pay the bulk of taxes, because they get paid the bulk of the money. Average wage earners who generates the vast majority of economic activity, by spending to meet their needs…
@jcoots43 @michele0921 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan Try again: “…53% of the cut would go to the top 1% and 30% to the top 0.1%…”	Upper MiddleClass takes a hit, but the SuperRich, &amp; their heirs, get a YUGE break. MiddleClass families get $660/yr, but lose funding for programs that help their communities.		https://t.co/yI9iQwl1jr

Your efforts are greatly appreciated, and I am right behind you reminding my representatives in #Congress of the importance of the #ACA!
@morethanmySLE @remain_Hopeful @DukeU …I spent 55% of my small income from helping people w/disabilities on my healthcare. By the end of this year year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs thanks to the #ACA! This past year, I paid $40/month for twice as many pills of that same narcolepsy medication…
@morethanmySLE @remain_Hopeful @DukeU …Afterwards I developed a mild version of narcolepsy. I don’t have the #Cataplexy, where people randomly fall asleep, but I need medication to wake up, &amp; function properly.	In 2013, I had to pay $1,203 each month for refills of my medication until I reached a $5,000 Deductible…
@morethanmySLE @remain_Hopeful About this time of year in 2005, I discovered a tumor in the 3rd ventricle of my brain. It was Winter break of my 1st Sr yr of college.

@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan …#Demand, not TaxCuts for the Rich, is what actually drives economic growth. When the govt helps vulnerable populations, the recipients spend that money in their communities. That requires businesses to hire new workers to keep up with the #Demand, &amp; attract new customers.
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan And I very much live in the Real World. I understand first hand the benefits of govt spending that employs me to help my neighbors w/disabilities. That allows me to pay my other neighbors for the healthcare, food, housing, &amp; transportation that I need. That helps create #Demand…
@jcoots43 @FrancesHarper99 @krassenstein @Ocasio2018 @SpeakerRyan There is a significant difference between running #Deficits to help Poor, Elderly, &amp; Disabled Americans, pay other Americans for the things they need, &amp; adding at least a $TRILLION to the annual #Deficit for the sake of letting Millionaires &amp; Billionaires to pay less in taxes.

@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton As @POTUS, the only business @realDonaldTrump should be conducting should be on behalf of We, the People!
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton So @BarackObama played golf too much, but hated it… What relationships, other than blackmailing @LindseyGrahamSC into becoming a sycophant, has @realDonaldTrump fostered while golfing? What deals has he gotten, on or off the golf course, that have improved life for our country?
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton I said that @BarackObama played 306 rounds of golf, over 8yrs… @realDonaldTrump has played 154 in 2yrs. He’s on pace to surpass #Obama’s 8yr total in 4yrs.	Reading comprehension problems? If so, I can respect that. But don’t pretend I didn’t lay the facts out side by side.
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton @FoxNews @seanhannity @foxandfriends With a @POTUS who flat out #LIES as frequently as @realDonaldTrump, it’s a tricky balancing act to give the public the Truth, yet still provide #Trump “fair” coverage. It’s their duty to inform us when he’s #LYING, which he does constantly when addressing his frequent rallies.
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton @FoxNews @seanhannity @foxandfriends @FoxNews is the glaring counter example, but even the other #MSM outlets have given @realDonaldTrump excessive screen time to spout his unsubstantiated 🐃💩.	They may quietly acknowledge that there’s no evidence to support his claims. But that’s just them doing their job!
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton …Job growth clearly started under @BarackObama. It will continue, if @realDonaldTrump doesn’t persist in risky economic deregulation, and self defeating #Tariffs. We’ve seen what has happened historically if #Trump continues on his path. And it ain’t good!
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton It takes time for economic policies to have an effect. #GDubyaShrub cut taxes, and he got an economic collapse. The recent shudders in the #StockMarket are more indicative of the effect @realDonaldTrump’s #Tariffs will have on the economy than current employment levels…
@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton @FoxNews @seanhannity @foxandfriends @senatemajldr The majority of #MSM may not be perfect, but it’s biased only towards the #Facts, &amp; exposes #Trump for his #AlternativeFact 🐃💩.

@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @BarackObama @BillClinton @FoxNews @seanhannity @foxandfriends @senatemajldr Nice try!

@goodfellaBrent @PayingInPennies @DTrumpPoll @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Economy: @BarackObama brought our economy back from the depths of the #Recession that started under #GDubyaShrub (after @BillClinton gave him a booming economy with #BudgetSurplus)	LowMinorityUnemployment: Again, this started under @BarackObama.

@bwdoherty @politico Would you be referencing the fact an Irish brigade repelled #Pickett’s charge at #Gettysburg(Googled it)?

@bwdoherty @politico I just grew up in #Virginia. The #CivilWar is everywhere here (but seeing as my family is from #WestVirginia &amp; #Ohio, I always identified more w/the #Union).

@joshuamckerrow @WDBJ7 @ChrisHurstVA Thank You for doing your part to record our history! So sorry that #WendiWinters is no longer able to be a part of your news team. Keep her legacy alive with your hard work, and these public reminders of her positive impact on the lives around her.
@lindagoodliffe @Unpersuaded112 @SenSanders @DNC @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I actually have a compromise solution for healthcare! It falls between #SinglePayer (which I don’t object to), &amp; @GOP’s #SurvivalOfTheRichest (which would definitely kill me). It’s the #GermanBismarckModel of Private, NONProfit health insurance, &amp; it provides #UniversalCoverage.
@nopeallthenope @brycetache @realDonaldTrump @VP @GenFlynn @POTUS @NancyPelosi @GOP Amen!
@Salty917 @Unpersuaded112 @realDonaldTrump claims he’s 239lbs… I call 🐃💩, unless he’s 4’3.” More like 392lbs, easy.
@HoneaPatricia @Unpersuaded112 There is Good, &amp; Bad #Deficit spending:	Good-	Helps Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled citizens pay other citizens for the things they need.	Improves Quality of Life.	Leads Directly to Job creation.	Bad-	Further enriches only the wealthy, w/no requirements to create additional Jobs.
@Micsterator @Unpersuaded112 Despite being an ignorant #Moron, who doesn’t understand his own job, &amp; frequently being thwarted by the members of his own administration, @realDonaldTrump is still @POTUS. He can do plenty to disrupt our economy just by being an idiot in the most important Office in his World.
@benwar27 @Unpersuaded112 @realDonaldTrump is an ignorant imbecile, &amp; a #FuckingMoron, who doesn’t understand the 1st thing about the economy, or trade. He listens to these idiots, then concocts an ego driven narrative where his fantastic negotiating skills make him the hero for acting “tough” on #China.
@benwar27 @Unpersuaded112 @realDonaldTrump …We buy more from, than we sell to China, that’s the deficit. But we get value for what we spend. Cheap materials &amp; products that we can assemble, or mark up for sale in our markets, &amp; around the world. This creates assembly, &amp; retail jobs, while providing Consumers cheap goods.
@benwar27 @Unpersuaded112 #Kudlow is a moron who believes in #TinkleDownTaxCuts, but he understands some aspects of the importance of trade. #PeterNavarro is an absolute imbecile who has convinced the ignorant @realDonaldTrump that #TradeDeficits are the primary marker of our economy. They’re not…
@KailiCarlton @Unpersuaded112 @SabZillAfoRilla …Therefore, we should tie the #MinimumWage to a #ConsumerPriceIndex (#CPI) of Housing, Food, Healthcare, Childcare, Transportation, &amp; Education. If the costs of any of those things rise, wages should rise automatically to keep pace. That’d allow workers to shop, fueling growth.
@KailiCarlton @Unpersuaded112 @SabZillAfoRilla We do have near full employment, &amp; high profits. The problem is that our #TinkleDownEconomic system has kept most of the earnings in the pockets of the richest 20%. If wages are inadequate for workers to shop for the things they need, the RealEconomy suffers as a result…
@clariceannn @Unpersuaded112 I’m right there with you! I’ve put a little in a retirement account, but I lose it all tomorrow, it doesn’t matter. I’m still probably working until I’m 90. Or dead…
@felinefine11 @KingAaronVII @Unpersuaded112 I had a #BrainTumor removed via surgery, &amp; radiation 13yrs ago. Suspect radiation gave me my mild narcolepsy. But I am extremely grateful that I never needed #Chemo. Ingesting poison to kill off a rouge bunch of cells does NOT sound like fun at all. Best wishes, &amp; #DONT_GIVE_UP!! https://t.co/bGjF3V5iUa
@madskanks @Unpersuaded112 @Artistwhogives @realDonaldTrump #WilburRoss is one of the assholes convincing @realDonaldTrump that #TradeDeficits are an indicator of economic success. They’re not! We may buy more materials from #China than we sell to them. But when we mark up the price 500% for sale around the world, we still make profits.
@marsthedog @Artistwhogives @Unpersuaded112 @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini… But as much as I loath him, I want #democracy, or #Impeachment to work to remove this #TrumpTyrant from power peacefully. Not through a violent coup. https://t.co/c4mRBDSOVe
@WinstonDeGres @unStunned @Unpersuaded112 What matters is the ability of people to meet their Housing, Food, Healthcare, Childcare, Transportation, &amp; Education needs. We should tie our #MinimumWage to a #ConsumerPriceIndex (#CPI) of those things, so as those prices rise, wages will automatically rise w/them to keep pace.
@lindagoodliffe @Unpersuaded112 I was on the #RulesCommittee for @SenSanders at the 2016 @DNC #Convention, but I got out &amp; knocked doors every week for @HillaryClinton, bc I knew that @realDonaldTrump was a threat to my #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions. The #ACA has saved me $44,400 over 5yrs!
@DiamondDixie @brycetache @realDonaldTrump …We know he’s full of 🐃💩, bc we haven’t fallen for his repeated, &amp; unrepentant #LIES for the past decade, starting w/his inane, racist #Birtherism claims against @BarackObama. But the same fools who fell for that conspiracy, will believe @realDonaldTrump is innocent of this 1.
@DiamondDixie @brycetache @realDonaldTrump #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini, knows damn well that he’s guilty. #Individual1 knows he’s implicated, but hopes that he can obfuscate anything short of #Mueller directly accusing @realDonaldTrump of “#RussianCollusion,” as proof that the smoke isn’t coming from a fire…
@nopeallthenope @brycetache @realDonaldTrump But don’t worry. @VP #Pence was in charge of the transition that put @GenFlynn, an undeclared #ForeinAgent, as our top #NationalSecurityAdvisor. If @POTUS @realDonaldTrump goes, @VP #Pence (&amp; #Mother) will go with him! Then it’ll be #President @NancyPelosi…	@GOP 🔜 🤯 https://t.co/JjVmEJQVju
@ginabuttrfly @brycetache @whenyourastar @realDonaldTrump Yes!!! https://t.co/O60e171BQ9
@Unpersuaded112 …However, if something, like Tariffs, threatens to curb Consumer spending by raising prices, economic activity could decrease.	The Stockmarket will reflect the fears of Investors that Consumer spending is in decline, and that may suggest the economy is in danger of a Recession.
@Unpersuaded112 …Workers are the primary Consumers in economies. All economies require Consumers to buy the products offered by its businesses. This #Demand requires businesses to hire employees. Those employees then shop at other businesses. Thus, Consumer spending fuels all economic growth…
@Unpersuaded112 …Yet the Stockmarket is still Significant, bc if enough investors are genuinely scared, it could mark the start of a #Recession. It’s especially important if Investors have a good reason to suspect that Consumer spending is in danger of suddenly, or deeply declining…
@Unpersuaded112 The Stockmarket is both Meaningless, &amp; Significant:	Meaningless, bc it doesn’t represent any real value. It’s merely the speculations of investors.	The RealEconomy is based on citizens ability to meet their Housing, Food, Healthcare, Childcare, Transportation, &amp; Education needs…
@CptainPatriot @realDonaldTrump You must’ve missed what @realDonaldTrump’s tax cuts for the Rich, along with his #TradeWars, are costing us… $1.5TRILLION #Deficits are projected in the next decade. But #IlDoucheCheetolini is making Billions!
@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Yea, because @GeraldoRivera is a real credible source…🙄	🐃💩!!!
@realDonaldTrump As supplies dwindle, costs will rise. So maybe we should stop artificially lowering the price of #NONRenewable #FossilFuels w/govt subsidies, &amp; invest in clean, #Renewable energy sources…
@hedgefundmgr42 @AliReyahi @realDonaldTrump 🐃💩. They depend on our money, and we rely on the products they produce. We import cheap goods, then mark up the prices for sale in our own domestic markets. We have traditionally underpaid them for their labor, and natural resources. Nothing @realDonaldTrump is doing helps us.
@AJuttaHBrink1 @EShotwave @AliReyahi @realDonaldTrump #CadetBoneSpurs… Don’t give him another unmerited promotion!
@cwilliams1113wy @AliReyahi @realDonaldTrump Robert “Bob” Mueller. Richard “Dick” Nixon. Richard “DICK” Cheney. Donald “Donny” Trump… https://t.co/vG5NrTwNW0
@Tdirtytrucker @AliReyahi @realDonaldTrump Yes @realDonaldTrump, as @POTUS you are responsible for destabilizing the world economy with your 🐃💩 tariff threats.
@MarkTay37766 @realDonaldTrump Yea, it’s #CadetBoneSpurs… Don’t give him yet another unmerited promotion!
@neianeil @realDonaldTrump He’s certainly coming unglued!!!
@BookofjohnI @realDonaldTrump It’s #CadetBoneSpurs… Don’t give him yet another unmerited promotion!
@TrumpInsideOut @realDonaldTrump #Captain is an unmerited promotion for #CadetBoneSpurs… But I suppose unmerited promotions are what has gotten @realDonaldTrump this far in life. He sure as Hell hasn’t earned a damn thing ever… He was born with a silver spoon stuck right up his butt! 🍑🥄
@FKAFernando @krassenstein Ironically, that’s the rule in #Casinos. Yet @realDonaldTrump is so incredibly incompetent, he managed to #Bankrupt Multiple #Casinos. A business model where customers literally give you money w/no realistic expectations of getting anything back in return! #FuckingMoron…
@joshuamckerrow @WDBJ7 @ChrisHurstVA …People don’t need @realDonaldTrump’s 🐃💩 rhetoric about the #LyingMedia to do terrible things to local Press figures. But @POTUS’s words do amplify their risks in our gun crazed culture. So sorry for what you’ve been through @joshuamckerrow. Thanks for sharing &amp; be careful!
@joshuamckerrow #AdamWard’s Dad was my HSGuidanceCounselor, &amp; I had a class w/ his older sister, who was a grade above me. Adam was the @WDBJ7 camera man, who was murdered w/the reporter, #AlisonParker, at #SmithMountainLake. Her BF, who was also a journalist, @ChrisHurstVA, is now a #Delegate…
@OxideLounge @realDonaldTrump #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini, wishes he could turn the #US into a #Fascist, #BananaRepublic! https://t.co/9CVAMh5Wuj
@mego73 @mwmiller75 @realDonaldTrump We have a #DemocraticRepublic… Pure democracy would be overwhelming, &amp; unlikely to yield positive results. But Govt Of, By, &amp; For We, the People still requires a healthy democratic system for us to appoint our representatives. #Democracy is what allows #Republics function.
It’s no secret anymore that the @GOP has nothing but contempt for the voters, our citizens, &amp; their BOSSES… This is NOT #WhatDemocracyLooksLike!! https://t.co/OOxBeOTcWs
@StevenBeschloss @PinkPinkpetunia In addition to being hand picked by #Putin’s boy, @PaulManafort, @VP #Pence was also in charge of the transition that appointed @GenFlynn, an undeclared #ForeignAgent, as our top #NationalSecurityAdvisor. #Mother’s darling boy is def going down with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump!

@ChrisLewisLLS @krassenstein Or what walking 2 miles will do to his #BoneSpurs…
@realkimstover Have you read @rachelheldevans’s book #EvolvingInMonkeytown/#FaithUnravelled? She describes her own faith crisis in similar terms.
@Lansing_Rawls @Salon Nope. @SpeakerRyan’s best hope for his legacy is that he is completely forgotten, like most #SpeakersOfTheHouse are. If anyone remembers #ReverseRobinhood at all, it’ll surely be with utter scorn, &amp; contempt. What won’t be forgotten are @SpeakerRyan’s $1.5Trillion #Deficits!
@Salon @SpeakerRyan’s legacy: $1.5TRILLION Annual Budget #DEFICITS…	Thanks, ya greedy Weasel/Snake/Worm (Deceitful, Venomous, &amp; Spineless)!	-An American under 40, who doesn’t mind spending to help vulnerable citizens, or the working class, but can’t stand #Wealthcare for the Rich…
@TimmyLynch13 @BrettPransky @Hollaworldwide @realDonaldTrump #Manafort was a #Russian political operative in the #Ukraine. #Putin pimped him out to @realDonaldTrump to get #kompromat. @GenFlynn was a compromised, misogynistic hothead, who got in bed with @realDonaldTrump due to his strong hatred for @HillaryClinton. He’s just another pawn.
@ecoandvfriendly @krassenstein Certainly! Improve battery life, their ability to recharge, &amp; their recyclability once they are truly kaput. But innovation via #Fusion, #TidalTurbines, &amp; #Geothermal, &amp; improvements in #Wind, &amp; #Solar are also critical. With those, we could make EXPENSIVE Carbon energy obsolete!
@sikntyrd54 @HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump @JKhashoggi @POTUS Right, bc the @GOP would have been super supportive if @BarackObama had of done anything to help put nuclear technology in the #MiddleEast… 🙄	@GOP Hypocrisy knows no bounds!
@SandySkipper1 @WendySiegelman @rgoodlaw @VP #Pence was at least #CriminallyNegligent. He had ample opportunity, &amp; warning to know that @GenFlynn was acting as an UnregisteredForeignAgent, yet allowed him to become our top #NationalSecurityAdvisor. Can you even imagine the @GOP outrage if this was true about #SusanRice?
@HoarseWisperer The #Saudi case is especially intriguing, given @realDonaldTrump’s hesitancy in cracking down after the @JKhashoggi murder. It’s possible @POTUS is beholden to multiple foreign countries for his personal wealth, &amp; only views relations w/#SaudiRoyals from a business perspective.
@tfcocs A fitting tribute to @potus41, who signed the #AmericansWithDisabilitiesAct (#ADA) into Law. This is #GHWBush’s single greatest achievement, &amp; the redeeming factor to his misguided time as #StRonnyRaygun’s #VP.
@JohnOrJane @krassenstein …Theoretically, we could sustain our economy primarily on service based industries (healthcare, education, child care, police, etc), and retail (cars, food, clothing, etc), as long as we keep taxable profits from intellectual property rights.
@JohnOrJane @krassenstein …We do need to be careful to guard our intellectual property rights, so that we continue to profit from the designs of products we created, even if they are manufactured abroad. And those profits must be taxable to pay for high levels of govt services…
@JohnOrJane @krassenstein …That last 1 is tricky, so I’ll explain. It doesn’t necessarily matter if we are buying more than we are selling abroad. So long as we get good value, then we can mark things up for sale within our own economy.	Import cheap goods/materials, market/assemble, &amp; sell for profit…
@JohnOrJane @krassenstein Probably the same people who said healthcare is a complex, nuanced issue… They also said #TradeWars are a bad idea in our Consumer based economy, since they disproportionately hurt Consumers. And that #TradeDeficits are an indication of healthy levels of economic consumption…
@fauxcin @krassenstein Hahahahaha!! Proof that only 23% of all statistics are made up… 🤨🤪🤣😂🤣
@bbritz @realDonaldTrump But there are indeed numerous solutions. One would be helping to fix the problems we created in #CentralAmerica by overthrowing democratically elected govts there, to back dictators who were open to #US businesses exploiting their labor &amp; resources. This destabilized the region.
@bbritz @realDonaldTrump …And what generates that $23Billion/yr? Even presuming similar costs in NM, AZ, &amp; TX, that’d still be less than $100Billion/yr. That’d be cheap compared to the amount we waste on various superfluous projects. And it’s a relatively trifling amount compared to a $Trillion Wall.
@bbritz @realDonaldTrump And what about the economic benefits that comes from the labor immigrants provide in our communities? These hard working individuals serve our communities in many roles that native born citizens refuse to do. They spend much of the money they earn right here in our communities…
@CibilSesco @gspinell @krassenstein …But while I also take issue w/the paternalistic nature of organized religion, &amp; fervently believe in the separation of Church &amp; State, my issue here is more semantic. Namely that it is needlessly redundant to say, “And He (God) will God bless…” Just say, “And God will bless…”
@CibilSesco @gspinell @krassenstein Fair enough. I can’t argue against the misogynistic, dogmatic nature of #Judaism, #Christianity, &amp; #Islam. But just as each has much to be critical of, each also contains elements of Love &amp; Generosity towards the least among us as exalted ideals…
@krassenstein Supply&amp;Demand. As the #Supply of #NonRenewable Coal, Oil &amp; Gas dwindles, yet global #Demand for energy continues to rise, prices will skyrocket. Clean, #Renewable energy is the way of the Future. Failure to embrace that revolution would leave us stuck forever in the past…
@krassenstein He’ll undoubtedly misconstrue the large audience as indicating he has the support of all those viewers… In reality, the vast majority of the world’s population, including within the #US, will be eagerly awaiting his downfall! #ITMFA! #Mueller8645ASAP
@Pineappleflambe @EricTrump @KellyannePolls I think that might legit be how @EricTrump does his hair…
@BillyBaldwin @EricTrump @KellyannePolls #BelaLugosi would be incredibly offended. He only played a villain in movies. The #Trumps are real life blood suckers!
@hotworkjiw377 @EricTrump @KellyannePolls Right?!? I believe @realDonaldTrump allegedly RAPED @EricTrump’s mom, but @gtconway3d is supposedly the bastard for calling out #MsAlternativeFacts, @KellyannePolls’s boss for being full of 🐃💩…
@donaldjitrump @mikethompsonx4 @EricTrump @KellyannePolls Which is saying something, since @DonaldJTrumpJr is known as #DumbFredo for essentially confessing collusion with #Russia by acknowledging the #TrumpTowerMeeting.	“…If it’s what you say I love it…”
@PaulSeczek @EricTrump @KellyannePolls It’s a very low bar, when it’s plausible that @DonaldJTrumpJr, AKA #DumbFredo, could mock your intelligence…
@snap8487 @EricTrump @KellyannePolls Defending his mother’s alleged rapist for the sake of his own personal profit… @EricTrump didn’t fall far from the asshole tree! The fact people refer to @DonaldJTrumpJr, AKA #DumbFredo, as the smart one between these two is very telling…
@JessyColossus @EricTrump @KellyannePolls #AlternativeFacts is my favorite piece of @KellyannePolls 🐃💩… It was hilarious to watch even an experienced, professional #Liar, like #KellyanneCONway, choke on the absolute absurdity of her own words!
@madg_lulu22 @DennisSc @EricTrump @KellyannePolls Don’t forget about @TiffanyATrump (even though @realDonaldTrump apparently has!)… She has been smart enough to stay away from this 💩show. She must have figured out that everything her daddy touches, turns to putrid excrement eventually!
@rezaaslan Thank you @rezaaslan! Just like your book, #Zealot does with the life of #Jesus, you put @EricTrump’s self serving “outrage” into perfect perspective!

@CibilSesco @gspinell @krassenstein Haha! Ok, but is God really the kinda douche who refers to itself in the third person like that? That seems more like a trait of human royalty, than a Devine Being.	Plus isn’t the point of the #Trinity to have a singularity out of multiple parts? After all, God is the Great I am!
@goodoldcatchy @BDKoz @RealJamesWoods @richardclarke That one is excellent! It, along with “#ThePriceOfLoyalty,” by #SecOfTreasury #PaulONeill, represent two informative tell all books by members of #GWBush’s cabinet. They portrayed #Dubya as an ill informed, &amp; uncritical victim of #DICKCheney &amp; #KarlRove’s greed &amp; hubris.
RT @nbcsnl: That handshake? It meant nothing. #SNL https://t.co/mhY9W3i4KM
@goodoldcatchy @BDKoz @RealJamesWoods They should read “#AgainstAllEnemies,” by @richardclarke.	#Clarke served as a #counterterrorism expert under #Reagan, #GHWBush, #Clinton, &amp; #GWBush. He explains how #GDubyaShrub’s incompetence led to 9/11, &amp; then an unnecessary quagmire in #Iraq, long before #Obama took Office.
…Unfortunately, Landlords can refuse to accept govt #Vouchers from potential tenants w/disabilities. Since this is often the only money they have for rent, it effectively prevents people w/disabilities from renting some places that would be ideal for them. This is unacceptable!
A client of mine was forced into a #NursingHome at age 22, after his only parent passed away, and his older half siblings forsook him. Another former client of mine has endured endless torment, surrounded by poverty, pests, questionable amenities, drug trafficking, &amp; violence…
Despite all the progress that has been made, Housing is still a big source of inequality. Disabled adults w/out strong families often must choose between often inappropriate institutions (#GroupHomes, #NursingHomes, #CentersForIndependantLiving, etc), or crime invested ghettos…
#GeorgeHWBush has a problematic legacy, but the #AmericansWithDisabilitiesAct (#ADA) was certainly his greatest accomplishment.	Yet there is still much work to be done to make the #US a better place to live for our most vulnerable citizens.	https://t.co/psRO2Le55v via @voxdotcom
@Awesome_Dave_ @krassenstein @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Where are @IvankaTrump’s servers? #TrumpTower? #666FifthAve? Do we know that evidence from @jaredkushner’s shady deal with the #Qataris wasn’t wiped from her private server? This is apples, to some very rotten orange slush!
@bbritz @realDonaldTrump 🐃💩…	It most certainly wouldn’t pay for itself! It’d add up to an extra $Trillion of #Debt, wouldn’t generate any long term jobs, &amp; would be completely ineffective at preventing illegal immigration. People would continue to overstay their #Visas, &amp; find new ways to sneak in.
@Levington24 @krassenstein @VP #Pence was in charge of the transition that appointed @GenFlynn, an undeclared #ForeignAgent, as our top #NationalSecurityAdviser. #Pence was either criminally reckless, or complicit. Either way, he falls with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.	Then it’s #President @NancyPelosi…🤔🧐😏
@gspinell @krassenstein Ok, yea, I thought that at 1st too… But who is “He?” If “He” is God, it still doesn’t make sense to say, “…He (God) will God bless America.”	I def agree w/the 1st part about #Republicans being hypocrites. But as a 1st born Son, I feel clarification on the 2nd part is critical!!
@jackschofield @JudyHarris15 @RanttMedia @GOP The #GermanBismarckModel of Private, NONProfit Insurance can require Patients to provide a small copay at the point of service. But it’s generally very small, &amp; easily affordable for all Patients. It’s more of a reminder that healthcare services are not free, than anything else.
@IrishDharmaDog @krassenstein He’s not #FatHitler. He’s #IlDoucheCheetolini! #Hitler was just as evil, &amp; hateful, but not nearly as incompetent as this #MangoMussolini we have today. Although we can hope that betrayal of #Russia will ultimately be the downfall for both #Hitler, &amp; @realDonaldTrump…
@gspinell @krassenstein Love the “#BuddyChrist” pic, but not sure about “…And we’ll (we will) God bless America…”	Is that a typo/autocowreckt for  “…And He’ll (He will) God bless America…”? Cause that’d totally make sense! But being the first born son, I’d hate to make any false presumptions…
@FalcoNat38 @krassenstein I love the portrayal of #LadyJustice defending #LadyLiberty! So True!
@XtraTerestriahu @RealPape5125 @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump And FYI, voters don’t register by party in many states. We can’t make policies along voting lines anyway…	However, I wouldn’t mind doing what is necessary to help desperate #Refugees get established. I don’t think it would take as much to help them as you suspect.
@XtraTerestriahu @RealPape5125 @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump I wouldn’t object to helping an immigrant family in my community. But I would be confident that they would be able to provide for their own housing, &amp; other needs once they got themselves established. But I personally lack the experience, skills, &amp; resources to help them do that.
@XtraTerestriahu @RealPape5125 @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump I didn’t say I was for “open borders.” I agree that those with histories of violent behavior should be prohibited from entering the country. But we can do more to help potential immigrants, without putting our country at risk.
@XtraTerestriahu @RealPape5125 @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump Except we don’t respect those who come here seeking #Asylum, &amp; we lock their kids in cages. It takes 5-7yrs to be processed, and costs thousands of dollars these #Refugees don’t have just to apply for legal immigration.	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
@krassenstein Yea, because @HillaryClinton has way too much power right now…	🙄	Nevermind @realDonaldTrump’s private iPhone use, or @IvankaTrump’s private email use…	🤨	#Putin must have compromising video of @LindseyGrahamSC with a #SenatePageBoy!	😳😱
@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump No! My solution is #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform. Legal status for children &amp; vulnerable individuals fleeing persecution.	A pathway to citizenship for immigrants who display good work ethic by accepting the jobs here #US workers won’t do.	We would monitor all #Refugees closely.
@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump Wait, if it wasn’t as bad as I say, why didn’t they take the offer? You’re not making sense…	While Mexico is slightly better than the other #CentralAmerican countries, but the cartels &amp; gangs still operate there w/relative impunity. It’s still not as safe as the #US.
@DeborahJeffri11 @pizzmoe @aurarivera11171 @krassenstein Except #Turtles love water… Better off covering @senatemajldr in snow… Or better still, #VoteHimOut! If not out of the #Senate completely, at least out of the #Majority… https://t.co/XtYdMvJuOt

@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump Those fleeing are often indigenous people (#NativeAmericans descended from the #Mayans, or #Aztecs), who have been marginalized in their own countries for centuries. They lack the status, &amp; financial resources to affect real change there.
@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump The men who attempt to fix it are either marginalized by the corruption of those in power. If they get too big, they become corrupted themselves, or are executed by those profiting off the status quo. Real revolutions are dangerous, and the odds are not in favor of the people.
@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump Have you ever been to an “impoverished shit hole?” A place w/unsafe water, no jobs, where corruption is rampant, &amp; violence is the only currency w/meaning? Would you want to raise your family in a place like that? Don’t you think escaping that is a valid reason to seek #Asylum?
@RealPape5125 @XtraTerestriahu @gmMusicMama @realDonaldTrump Actively in conflict. Gang wars have been raging in #CentralAmerica since the 1950s, with renewed vigor in the 1980s. Just bc the Govts declared victory over the Rebels, doesn’t mean the violence ended. Even if the Rebels have no real shot at victory, some continue to fight.

@GarrettPoitras @realDonaldTrump …This resulted in +30yrs of fighting, that empowered the cartels &amp; gangs. Most #UndocumentedImmigrants can not afford to pay the thousands of dollars it costs to wait 7-8yrs for the “legal” system to “work.” All while the cartels &amp; gangs recruited, and/or raped their children.
@GarrettPoitras @realDonaldTrump These #Refugees are seeking #Asylum from the violence &amp; poverty that we imposed upon them by overthrowing their democratically elected govts during the #ColdWar to install capitalist dictators who allowed US companies to exploit their labor &amp; resources…
@GarrettPoitras @realDonaldTrump As for why immigrants bypass the “legal system…”	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
@GarrettPoitras @realDonaldTrump I’m all for having frank &amp; honest conversations with kids about the genuine risks inherent to using certain drugs, &amp; having effective, non-punitive, drug rehab programs for addicts. Most of the deadly drugs on our streets come from pharmacies, not international drug smuggling.
@GarrettPoitras @lenaer_nichols @realDonaldTrump …Any “mules” picked up walking drugs in across the border are either small time chumps, simply serving the #Demand in border towns. Or they are low level fall guys being set up by the real #Cartel bosses to distract the #DEA from the real shipments flying in over their heads.
@GarrettPoitras @lenaer_nichols @realDonaldTrump Because they don’t know which planes they’re on. They fly in &amp; out on private runways. The Laws don’t apply to people Rich enough to have their own planes, &amp; runways. Or did you forget that we live in plutocracy?…

@ProudResister @realident @POTUS Unlike the @GOP, the @DNC routinely puts #CountryOverParty to do the right thing.
@arrow_report This was just #Phase1. We will clean up the rest of the 🐘💩 in DC by 2020. That’s if #Mueller doesn’t manage to clear it out for us before then… In the meantime, we shifted 40 #House seats #Blue. That’s significant.
@RhondaSimonett1 @LibNonentity @JCBtup @krassenstein @1VA2021 Voters should select their Representatives. Representatives should NOT be allowed to select their Voters!
@krassenstein Of Course @realDonaldTrump pushed for changing the @RNC platform to be more #Russian friendly. The @GOP was extremely critical of #Russia &amp; its role in #Crimea prior to their efforts in 2016 to help #Trump become #POTUS.
@ProudResister @realident And if that were the case, enough #Dems would have already abandoned Party loyalty to ensure that the impeachment was successful, and the #Democratic @POTUS was removed from Office.
@ida_skibenes #John8:7 is a parable about a WOMAN who is brought before #Jesus accused of #Adultery. No mention is made of HER presumably MALE partner in the Sin of #Adultery. The MEN want to stone HER, as scripture commands. #Jesus says that HE who is without Sin, may cast the 1st stone.

@JoshEdits @DavidCornDC …For example, I usually disagree w/@RandPaul, but I occasionally respect that he is willing to do what he believes is the right thing (well, at least until he inevitably caves in under pressure from his Party to do something he has already acknowledged is a bad idea…).
@JoshEdits @DavidCornDC Amoral is as bad as immoral, if their lack of morals allows them to do evil for the sake of personal profit. I can respect a degree of immortality, if the person truly believes they are acting morally. Life is complicated after all…
@SharleneLustig @realDonaldTrump True. I’m not really “worried,” just making a point. I agree that #IlDoucheCheetolini, the #MangoMussolini is full of 💩, and nothing he promises is worth 💩!

@Elizabeth_USA27 @BobJuniperJr @realDonaldTrump He’s a #FuckingMoron, and that was according to his own #SecretaryOfState.

@Brasilmagic …A neutral, govt agency would decide if MedicalProviders are billing fraudulently to prevents Insurers from rejecting legitimate claims for the sake of increasing their profits.
@Brasilmagic …All citizens are required to take #PersonalResponsibility for their potential healthcare liabilities by obtaining health coverage. This ensures that no one passes their unpaid medical bills on to others. Everyone pays something, so that Everyone has a Right to healthcare…
@Brasilmagic …Insurers compete with varying Premium:Deductible ratios, along with luxury services, like free spa, &amp; gym memberships for their subscribers. But all #EssentialHealthBenefits, care Patients can’t reasonably refuse, must be covered…
@Brasilmagic …The govt refunds excessive premiums collected directly to subscribers, or distributes the money to other Insurers who had unexpectedly high benefits payouts. As an incentive, the most popular Insurers are allowed to keep a slightly higher portion of the Premiums they collect…
@Brasilmagic …It requires all Insurers &amp; all MedicalProviders to collectively bargain to set the rates for all medical services. When a licensed MedicalProvider has a bill for a subscriber, the Insurer must automatically pay. No Networks, no PriorAuthorization, no 🐃💩! Patients come First…

@rashaverak_day @krassenstein …@GOP cuts taxes as part of their #TinkleDown LIE.

@rashaverak_day @krassenstein AKA, more addition by subtraction… There’s a big difference when it comes to adding to our $20Trillion #NationalDebt to further enrich the wealthy, and adding to it to pay for programs that help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for the things they need…

@ThisWeekABC This is certainly an example of wasteful, pointless, govt spending. But it’s really just a drop in the ocean, compared to the $1.5Trillion #Deficits the #TrumpTaxCutsForTheRICH will add to our $20Trillion #NationDebt…

@Hal_Bundy @NPR How did he Bankrupt Multiple CASINOS?!?! They say the House always wins for a reason. The odds are statistically stacked so that the Casino makes money more often than not. To Bankrupt a Casino takes a special kind of stupid. Bankrupting Multiple Casinos requires a #FuckingMoron!
@muffley_merkin @thehill @VP #Matthew25:32-46: #Jesus says that he will judge @VP #Pence according to how he treated the least among us.

@kylegriffin1 @DropOutDota I completely agree that it should definitely be a woman, but I think a newer woman, who Republicans don’t already have archives of propaganda to try to smear with. At least make the @GOP spend some of that #KochMoney they sold their souls for to make some new propaganda!
@QueenAllyVA Perhaps world domination as a despotic, tyrannical, Queen 👑…?
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake How am I the idiot for pointing out that the percentage you pay in taxes &amp; for healthcare is irrelevant, if you still have adequate resources to meet your needs afterwards?

@Plantflowes @caffeinateddino I have the deepest respect for @NancyPelosi, but the fact remains that, rightfully, or not, she is a highly divisive figure who has an ability to unite the bigoted misogynists who vote for the @GOP. They already use her in their propaganda to smear @DNC candidates nationwide…
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake …Yet despite facing numerous threats to my life, &amp; their emotional roller coasters from living a life that’s more challenging than we can even imagine, I (usually) enjoy my job. I don’t really mind the low wages, so long as I can help them out, while still meeting my own needs.
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake …I provide a valuable service to my community by improving the quality of life for my clients, and helping them to be more self reliant. I encourage them to find positive outlets for their frustrations w/society, rather than giving into their darker impulses…
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake …I work damn hard to help people w/disabilities in my community remain independent, to meet the standards required by the Americans w/Disabilities Act (#ADA). I regularly work more than 50hrs/wk, earning between $9.22-$12.25/hr, dealing w/literal insanity…
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake And how much does that leave you with afterwards? The percentage can be deceptive. You could pay 90% on those combined, but if you’re a Billionaire, you’d still have $100Million left to play around with. Yet I only had $9,000 to live on after just my healthcare before the #ACA…
@GregJaffe **knows…
@why_two_wit @krassenstein @Acosta @ABC @CBS @Reuters @BBCAMERICA No problem! I didn’t see @NPR, or @PBS, but I suspect that they’re both on board. @Reuters, &amp; @BBCAMERICA aren’t technically based in the #US, so they might not feel like it’s their place to sign on.

@ElleYork2 @krassenstein @Acosta @ABC @CBS @CBS is on the list. @ABC is just the network outlet for @Disney now. They have no real interest in News coverage. I didn’t see @NPR, or @PBS, but I’m confident that they will stand with other journalistic organizations in this case.
@JAyardbwoy @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton …@BarackObama brought us back from that to give @realDonaldTrump a booming economy, with manageable #Deficits, and clear security objectives. @realDonaldTrump has accomplished nothing that @BarackObama did not gift wrap for him.
@JAyardbwoy @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton …In spite of all this increased spending, #GDubyaShrub proceeded to cut taxes for the Rich, while pushing for further deregulation of financial institutions. When the economy inevitably collapsed, we had to take on $Trillion #Deficits just to keep the country afloat…
@JAyardbwoy @realDonaldTrump Despite his flaws, @BillClinton handed #GDubyaShrub a booming economy, with a budget #Surplus, and actionable intel on #Osama. #Shrub promptly ignored the intel, allowing 9/11 to happen. Then, #DICKcheney used that as an excuse for an expensive invasion of #Iraq…
@Bahikabo @JuliaKruskieRN @KittyVons @PamSeater @Stehlo_Gaming @UmmAlDunya @NBCNews We already have voter ID laws. We need automatic registration for all citizens when they turn 18, free photo IDs for registered voters, #ElectionDay holidays off from work, and a uniform system to simplify the process so everyone has the opportunity to exercise their CivilRights.
@JAyardbwoy @YossiGestetner @JeffFlake My high costs pre #ACA were related to a #BrainTumor I had removed, and a mild version of narcolepsy I developed afterwards. I need that medication to wake up, and function as a human being, &amp; caregiver for people w/disabilities.	I spend all the money I save here in my community!
@JAyardbwoy @YossiGestetner @JeffFlake …The other problem is lack of empathy. Even if I paid slightly more, as long as I could still easily afford all my basic costs of living, I would be happy to know that the least among us were able to get the coverage they need to survive with their #PreexistingConditions.
@JAyardbwoy @YossiGestetner @JeffFlake Yes!! I was 22 when I had my tumor. After my surgeries &amp; radiation, I went back to college the next semester. But given my circumstances, I took a lighter course load. Since I wasn’t a full time student, I had to pay for expensive COBRA Coverage in case the Cancer came back…
@JAyardbwoy @YossiGestetner @JeffFlake Amen! #Virginia is a Purple State, that only recently leaned Blue, &amp; we just now accepted the #MedicaidExpansion to allow our federal tax dollars to come back to our state to help our citizens. This only happened after a Blue shift to our #GeneralAssembly in 2017.
@Liloldforallth1 @YossiGestetner @JAyardbwoy @JeffFlake Do you make more than $20K/year? Are you spending 55% of your income on healthcare? Do you have more than $9,000/year to live on after your medical expenses? I’m sorry you’re rates went up, but unless you can say yes for all three of those, you’re still better off than I was.
@RudyBaylorESQ @kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid According to @realBobWoodward’s book, #Fear, @SecretaryRoss is one of the worst influences on @realDonaldTrump when it comes to trade, &amp; international diplomacy.

That’s why on Tuesday, I’ll be voting for @flacc4congress &amp; @timkaine to improve our healthcare system, #ForAll of US! https://t.co/EKWaL6oMhu
Due to the changes the @GOP made through their Tax Cuts for their Rich donors, now when I go to shop for my next policy, I can’t be sure if it’s going to cover my Rx meds, or doctors at all. It’s discriminatory if the Insurance I need through no fault of my own costs extra.
Last year, I spoke directly w/my #Congressman, @RepMGriffith, &amp; explained how skimpy plans that don’t cover anything, &amp; ending the #IndividualMandate for citizens to take #PersonalResponsibility that his @GOP sought, will undermine the protections for my #PreExistingConditions.
This year I only paid a $40 copay each month for twice as many pills of that same narcolepsy medication. And that’s before I even reach my $850 deductible! The money I save each year is invested directly back into my local economy to pay for my rent, food &amp; transportation. 🏘🌽🚘

We could also offer #PharmaCompanies cash rewards for developing Cures to our pressing medical problems…
@PickensR0110 @dianeclectica @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris @MedicareGov And that right there is the crux of the problem! The primary goal of our healthcare system is for investors to make money. Not to treat our citizens, or improve our health…
@PickensR0110 @tolag @dianeclectica @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris @MedicareGov Wealthy #Canadians come to the US for specialized care bc we can afford the best doctors &amp; medical technology. Not bc we have the best healthcare system. #Canada achieves far better healthcare results for the general public. Even their wealthy stay there for routine care.
@PickensR0110 @tolag @dianeclectica @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris @MedicareGov @DeptVetAffairs is by definition Not #UniversalCoverage. It’s underfunded, &amp; mismanaged. It doesn’t represent the range of options available to achieve #UniversalCoverage. @MedicareGov &amp; @MedicaidGov are more representative of how #SinglePayer systems typically work.
@tolag @dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris @MedicareGov There are multiple approaches to #UniversalCoverage, &amp; all of them are less expensive, and yield better healthcare results overall than our system.
@dianeclectica @bobbycohoon @PickensR0110 @tolag @KamalaHarris ER care is the most expensive care most Hospital provide, bc it so often goes unpaid. When the uninsured try to use it as #PrimaryCare, this only increases those costs for everyone else. That’s one of many reasons everyone needs health insurance.

@bobbycohoon @dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @KamalaHarris We have some of the best doctors, &amp; medical technology bc we are the wealthiest country in the world. But we still have lower life expectancies, &amp; higher infant mortality rates than all other developed countries. All of our citizens can’t afford the quality care we have to offer.
@bobbycohoon @dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @KamalaHarris And the Patient who receives care without coverage still gets a bill, even if they can’t pay it. Given the cost of emergency care, those bills often do result in bankruptcy. Unpaid bills are a big driver of underlying medical costs. That’s why everyone needs coverage!
@bobbycohoon @dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @KamalaHarris Except that means your unpaid medical bills were tacked on to the bills of people w/insurance in the form of inflated costs, like $200 for a 2¢ bandage. And if you had #Cancer, they’d only treat you when it became an emergency. By then you would be unlikely to fully recover.
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris It is possible to preserve a Private Insurance Market. But it requires strict regulations to prevent profiteering, &amp; discrimination based on #PreexistingConditions. Ideally, it includes a #PublicOption to buy into a program like @MedicareGov to act as a pace car on the Market.
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …This is my preferred healthcare system, &amp; represents a compromise between #SinglePayer (which I personally have no objections to), &amp; #SurvivalOfTheRichest (which I wouldn’t survive).

@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …When he was 22, his Mom died, &amp; his older half siblings stuck him in a nursing home for 9yrs, until finally he cussed out a nurse &amp; got kicked out. He’s bounced around a bit since, but currently lives in a #CenterForIndependantLiving, where most of his neighbors are elderly…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …Let me tell you about a couple of my former clients. I worked for a guy w/#CerebralPalsy who was practically quadriplegic. He can use a joy stick to drive a chair around, but that’s it. He needs someone to feed him, dress him, get him in&amp;out of bed, even wipe his ass for him…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris I sympathize with your situation. You should earn more than the worthless #TrustFundKids who inherited their penthouse suites. But I still think that the basement floor for people who truly can’t get by on their own needs to be above water…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump …Claims that wealth is merit based ring empty when we give huge tax cuts to #TrustFundKids on their stock portfolio profits. Then we expect single parents to make ends meet, &amp; raise good kids, while working 60hrs/wk since the only jobs they qualify for don’t pay a #LivableWage.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …The rewards go to the privileged, &amp; the penalties are aimed at the Poor. Address the problem of income inequality, where @DonaldJTrumpJr &amp; @EricTrump get paid more while taking a 💩, than I earn all year helping people in my community. Then we can talk about welfare reform…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris We need to make work worthwhile at all levels. Sure, those w/unique skills that generate large profits should get more. But they can’t make a dime without the unskilled labor at the bottom. So those at the bottom should earn enough to feel rewarded for their efforts…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris People don’t try, bc without a #LivableWage, anyone with a low ability level who has to work a #MinimumWage job isn’t going to earn enough to pay the bills anyway. If you’re going to be looked at with scorn for needing public assistance either way, why bother to work?
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris I have a close friend who was hit by an #IED in #Afghanistan, has severe #PTSD, &amp; he’s more progressive than I am. He gets frustrated w/@DeptVetAffairs like everyone else, but says at least its paid for. He wants #SinglePayer, w/#DentalCare &amp; #LegalizedMedicalCannabis.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris The kind of healthcare, &amp; economy that most @DNC supporters envision is closer to that of #Germany, #France, or #Japan. Not #Venezuala, or #Cuba. Antitrade, isolationist, nationalist, plutocratic policies are far worse for economic growth, &amp; our country than democratic socialism.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Absurd propaganda. The actual causes of #Venezuela’s troubles stems from exploitation by #US companies, then an overreaction to #Nationalism &amp; #Isolationism by #Venezuelan #Populist leaders, followed by #US efforts at destabilization, &amp; Privatization.	https://t.co/TBqkMBAptD
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris There are responsible, compassionate ways to deal w/immigration. And the vast majority of immigrants support themselves w/hard work. We have jobs that EuropeanAmericans won’t do. These immigrants are willing to do them to keep our economy functioning.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Most people w/disabilities live on less than $800/month of @SocialSecurity income (30% of which goes to housing), and less than $70/month in #FoodStamps. Their housing options are inappropriate institutions, or unsafe ghettos. Being disabled is hard enough without being poor.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris But I would rather a few unscrupulous bums cheat the system, than anyone who needs assistance go without it. On my end, as someone who works for people w/disabilities, I see disabled adults forced to live in abominable situations, bc we underfund their housing options.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris And people selling their #FoodStamps (difficult to do with an #EBT card system) are generally attempting to get cash to satisfy an addiction that our broken, criminalized drug system fails to cope with responsibly (instead of penalties, we need affordable rehabilitation options).
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris It’s not right to tell people they can’t have children. I support a Woman’s Right to choose, but not forced govt sterilization of citizens. And while the @GOP has shown a penchant for #Kidnapping children from loving parents, I oppose #FamilySeparation.
@oldpol2 @PickensR0110 @kendrasandman @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …Additional taxes on #Tobacco products could help fund healthcare programs &amp; insurance for smokers.	Beyond that, @HHSGov could do research to establish healthy living standards, &amp; help provide guidance for incentives.
@oldpol2 @PickensR0110 @kendrasandman @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris What do you mean specifically by perimeters in this context? How big a penalty there’d be for smokers? What kind of incentives we should provide for healthy living? What constituents healthy living?
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …There’s also a likelihood of genetic low ability. If the only jobs they’re capable of doing, are #MinimumWage jobs that don’t pay the bills, why waste their time breaking their backs to make someone else richer? There’s no incentive for them to work without a #LivableWage.
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Bc generational poverty has an impact on kids. Many jobs are obtained through personal connections. If their parents don’t already have work connections, it can be harder for kids to establish them…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris We can establish realistic standards to prevent fraud, &amp; target the taxes on those who can easily afford them. We can incentivize work by increasing wages. Many people w/disabilities want to work for the socialization aspects, &amp; to earn a little extra for recreational activities.
@TheRealOJen @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …But if only the sick have comprehensive coverage, then comprehensive coverage will be extremely expensive. So we need a large pool of subscribers, w/plenty of healthy members to mitigate the costs of those who get sick. And that’s why the idea of “#HighRiskPools” is 🐃💩!!
@TheRealOJen @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Yes! Health Insurance works by dispersing the risks of incurring high medical bills across a larger group, by requiring everyone in the group to chip in to pay for the medical bills of anyone else in the group. The bigger the group, the less each person has to pay…
@EHeels10 @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris To the contrary, they’ve voted to Repeal the #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions, without an adequate Replacement. @GOP doesn’t give a 💩about their constituents. They only care about their donors!
@TuraGypsyRobin @flacc4congress @RepMGriffith @GOP **Mean was @realDonaldTrump’s own word to describe the #House’s #AHCA bill due to its lack of #PatientProtections during negotiations w/#Senate. @RandPaul admitted #AHCA wouldn’t protect patients, but still voted for it. Only @SenJohnMcCain had the integrity to kill the #AHCA!
@TuraGypsyRobin @flacc4congress @RepMGriffith @GOP …By May of 2017, @RepMGriffith was grinning from ear to ear, &amp; giving a big thumbs up in a pic from the premature #RoseGarden celebration, after the #House passed their “mean**” Repeal &amp; Replace effort.
@TuraGypsyRobin @flacc4congress I know @RepMGriffith personally. I met w/him in Jan of 2017 to tell him how much the #ACA has helped me, &amp; how the @GOP’s plans would hurt me. I even offered him a compromise that would preserve the Private insurance system, while lowering costs, &amp; improving healthcare results…
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …On the “carrot” side, Insurers could provide discounts to subscribers for healthy food, &amp;  gym memberships to incentivize healthy eating, &amp; exercise.	But we don’t need a #NannyState telling us what to eat, &amp; we shouldn’t penalize people born w/uncontrollable weight issues.
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris I would be fine with charging Smokers higher Premiums, since it is a completely voluntary practice, with widely known &amp; accepted healthcare risks. That’s the only “stick” penalty which I can think of, that I’d be comfortable with…
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …Attach the Minimum to a #ConsumerPriceIndex of essential Goods&amp;Services, so if prices rise, wages also rise. That’d allow workers to shop for their wants &amp; needs. Increased #Demand on businesses leads to hiring, creates more shoppers, &amp; magnifies the benefits. #WaterTheRoots!
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …But I do think we should encourage people to try to do something to benefit their communities. The best work incentive would be a #LivableMinimumWage. Pay workers an adequate wage to meet their needs, &amp; more people are likely to put forth the effort to find work…
@dianeclectica @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Absolutely not! That would discourage entrepreneurship, &amp; innovation. It would also prevent people from opting to spend more time taking care of their families, &amp; greatly reduces the quality of life for citizens…
@PickensR0110 @barbsway1 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris My problem is defining“able bodied.” I work for people w/disabilities, I’ve seen that most homeless adults suffer some degree of undiagnosed intellectual disability, or simply have a low IQ. Without a #LivableMimimumWage, it’s unfair to expect them to not rely on social services.
@barbsway1 @PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris I agree that it’s just wrong that the @GOP’s #TinkleDown TaxCuts for the Rich have blown a $Trillion hole in our budget, &amp; now they want to renege on the promises made to our #GreatestGeneration, &amp; their #BabyBoomer children.
@PickensR0110 @dianeclectica @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …Being uninsured should cost more.  Without an #IndividualMandate, hospitals would have to kick the uninsured out of ERs to die in the streets. Or else the price of covering the uninsured is just tacked onto the bills of the insured in the form of $200 for 2¢ bandages.
@PickensR0110 @dianeclectica @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Agreed. Smokers should pay higher premiums for intentionally, &amp; knowingly engaging in unnecessary risky behavior. The only way to make that work is to have an #IndividualMandate for All citizens to do what they can to obtain coverage, &amp; require employers pay adequate wages…
@PickensR0110 @kendrasandman @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris You’ve more control over your driving record, than your health status. But I agree that smokers should pay higher premiums. And we could reward living healthy life styles w/discounts for healthy eating &amp; gym memberships. But we shouldn’t penalize people w/#PreExistingConditions.
@PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …But having an able body, doesn’t necessarily mean having an able mind. Those who are unable to work, or earn enough to pay for their own insurance should receive govt subsidies as part of living in a compassionate country that cares for the wellbeing of its citizens.
@PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …That’s why we need an #IndividualMandate to require All citizens to do what they can to obtain coverage for their potential healthcare liabilities. This requires employers to pay a #LivableWage so All workers to earn enough to pay for their own insurance…
@PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris I was 22 when I discovered a #BrainTumor. There was no reason before that to suspect that I would need $450K worth of coverage. If I was uninsured, I would have died, or ended up homeless trying to pay my medical bills…
@tribelaw @Gypsysister58 …We need to end the myth that wealth will #TinkleDown. MiddleClass #Demand is what drives economic growth by purchasing the Goods&amp;Services. Wealthy “#JobCreators” won’t hire more workers until there’s a #Demand for their products. #WaterTheRoots w/#LivableWages to spur #Demand!
@tribelaw @Gypsysister58 Oh, so after slashing taxes for the Rich to create $Trillion #Deficits, NOW it’s time to cut taxes for the MiddleClass…🙄
@bobbycohoon @jettsoma @KamalaHarris @GOP @BarackObama’s highly successful healthcare policy allows Millions of citizens w/#PreexistingConditions to have access to the Affordable healthcare coverage we need to survive. Without Affordable access to medical care, many citizens would have died. #Obamacare has saved lives!
@bobbycohoon @jettsoma @KamalaHarris @GOP …After this year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs due to the #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions, &amp; #CostSharingReductions (#CSR) for low incomes in the #ACA. Now I pay $40/month for twice as many of the same narcolepsy pills, even before I reach my $850 deductible!
@bobbycohoon @jettsoma @KamalaHarris @GOP …I had a #BrainTumor removed in 2006, &amp;  developed a mild version of narcolepsy. In 2013, I spent 55% of my $20K income from helping people w/disabilities on healthcare. That included $1,203/month for refills of my narcolepsy medication until I reached a $5K deductible…
@bobbycohoon @jettsoma @KamalaHarris God certainly had a role in my survival. But the Devil would support the kind of greedy, #SurvivalOfTheRichest healthcare system that the @GOP wants to force people w/#PreexistingConditions back into. As we do to the least among us, we also do to God…
@BoilerRoomNewz @bobbycohoon @JazzyUnicorn4 @KamalaHarris Precisely! And what the @GOP calls “#EntitlementPrograms,” like #SNAP/#FoodStamps, @SocialSecurity, @MedicareGov &amp; @MedicaidGov, are actually NONExportable #JOBS programs to help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for the Goods&amp;Services they need to survive!
@PickensR0110 @tolag @bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris Everyone needs to take #PersonalResponsibility for their potential healthcare liabilities by obtaining coverage. Otherwise, those of us who need coverage to manage expensive #PreexistingCondition, also subsidize the costs of covering the uninsured when they’re randomly injured.
@bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris …After this year I’ll saved $44.4K over 5yrs thanks to the #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions, &amp; #CostSharingReductions (#CSR) for low incomes in the #ACA. My Congressman, @RepMGriffith has voted multiple times to kill the #ACA. So I’m voting for @flacc4congress!
@bobbycohoon @KamalaHarris As someone who earns $20K/yr helping people w/disabilities, I spent 55% of my income on healthcare due to my #PreexistingConditions before the #ACA. That included $1,203/month for refills of my narcolepsy medication until I reached a $5K Deductible…
@NightowlVizuet @CrystalRRivers2 @Floyd4758 @EkpeAgu @realDonaldTrump …In fact, the US backed several coups to overthrow democratically elected govts there, bc we viewed them as “communist” sympathizers. Really they were just pushing back against our attempts to exploit them. The resulting civil wars served to empower the gangs &amp; drug cartels.
@NightowlVizuet @CrystalRRivers2 @Floyd4758 @EkpeAgu @realDonaldTrump We have traditionally backed the corrupt govts that the rebels fought against, since it was easier to bribe them to allow our businesses to exploit their resources &amp; labor. US policy has historically been extremely detrimental to the region…
@Floyd4758 @EkpeAgu @realDonaldTrump They have fought Revolutions with guerrilla warfare in their countries for over 30 years. They failed in part because of US backing for their corrupt govts. The fighting only made things worse by strengthening the gangs, &amp; drug cartels.
@EkpeAgu @realDonaldTrump Not as simple as it sounds. Most of these #Refugees can’t afford to wait 5 to 7yrs for the legal process, when the gangs &amp; poverty are an immediate threat to safety of their children.	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
@Burp_Reynolds @ItsJustMe122 @rm10orozco @realDonaldTrump Exactly! @GOP gave the Rich more money, &amp; now they want to cut govt programs that help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for the things they need. These so called “#Entitlements” help create Public &amp; Private sector JOBS in every community across the country!
@Burp_Reynolds @rm10orozco @realDonaldTrump Bullseye! 🎯	Classic @GOP scapegoating.

@ahern_4 @ProudResister @ManInTheHoody I just don’t understand. It doesn’t make sense to me. If you have more money than you need,  money that you’re never going to spend yourself, and will never benefit from having, why wouldn’t you want to give it to someone else who does need it?
@KamalaHarris @MedicareGov FYI: #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan already use similar models to provide their citizens with #UniversalCoverage at lower costs, &amp; w/better healthcare results the #SurvivalOfTheRichest system @GOP wants us to go back to.
@KamalaHarris @MedicareGov …The #IRS could monitor Insurers to make sure they operate as True NONProfits, while @US_FDA, or @HHSGov could watch over MedicalProviders to prevent fraudulent billing. But Insurers w/Profit motives to deny legit claims would not arbitrarily decide which bills they want to pay!
@KamalaHarris @MedicareGov …The #GermanBismarckModel works by getting all Insurers &amp; all MedicalProviders to collectively bargain annually to set the rates for all medical services. Then when a licensed MedicalProvider sends an Insurer a bill, the Insurer automatically pays it. No 🐃💩!…

@MagnaCartaGirl @fudgewart @TheRuork @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov It clearly is a joke, no one uses guillotines today. The likelihood of @GOP members being beheaded is incredibly small.	But @realDonaldTrump’s reference during the campaign to “#2ndAmendmentSolutions,” holds serious implications today when mass shootings are so prevalent.
@MagnaCartaGirl @fudgewart @TheRuork @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov While that is distasteful, it’s clearly a joke, &amp; still better than @realDonaldTrump suggesting “#2ndAmendmentSolutions” to #Hillary if she had won.	It’s also a reference to the #FrenchRevolution, where the commoners overthrew an aristocracy that was callous to their suffering.
@fudgewart @MagnaCartaGirl @TheRuork @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov Precisely! The #1stAmendment grants citizens the Right to peacefully assemble, &amp; petition their government for a redress of their grievances. So where were these “violent mobs?”

@TheRuork @fudgewart @MagnaCartaGirl @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov Where is this supposed ground swell of Blacks &amp; Latinos taking place? All I see &amp; hear in my town are minorities who are deeply offended by @realDonaldTrump’s coddling of the #Nazis &amp; #KluKluxKlan members among his “#AmericaFirst” base, &amp; his #FamilySeparation immigration policy.
@TheRuork @fudgewart @MagnaCartaGirl @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov Yet the @GOP continues to stand behind @realDonaldTrump. They have failed to adequately denounce his profuse, &amp; egregious Lies, or his calls for violence against the Press, &amp; citizen who are exercising their #1stAmendment Rights to #FreedomOfThePress, &amp; #FreedomOfSpeech.
@TheRuork @fudgewart @MagnaCartaGirl @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …Other private businesses benefit when social workers have money to spend. Govt spending on “social” programs creates #NonExportableJOBS in every community across the country. Those employees then support private industries by shopping to meet their own needs.
@TheRuork @fudgewart @MagnaCartaGirl @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …And social safety net programs that help Poor, Elderly &amp; Disabled Americans pay other Americans for the things they need are beneficial to our economy.

@itbepolicy @MontyBoa99 @ChuckGrassley That would be a long process. We’re not talking about seeking a criminal conviction, but this potentially casts a dark shadow of a doubt on the suitability of a nominee for Lifetime appointment to the #SCOTUS. #Senate should not confirm, unless an investigation removes all doubt!
@ThisIsMrEd @MontyBoa99 @ChuckGrassley NO! A Lifetime #SCOTUSNominee is accused of attempted Rape. I’m merely pointing out that since @SenateMajLdr &amp; @GOP choose to keep a #SCOTUS seat open for over 440days. So @ChuckGrassley’s deadlines are completely arbitrary. These allegations should be thoroughly investigate!
@DanielP67186307 @MontyBoa99 @ChuckGrassley He’s the man @BarackObama nominated to the #SCOTUS, but who @SenateMajLdr &amp; @GOP refused to grant hearings to in order to keep a #SCOTUS seat open for more than 440 days, so they could give it to #NeilGorsuch.

It’ll probably come out sooner, since #Putin is undoubtedly digging into it for @realDonaldTrump.
@LoyalBlue2 @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner If I had to guess, one of the Generals. Possibly #JohnKelly, but more likely #JimMattis, or even #MikePompeo.

@100_Disable_vet @Jandk17Fields I’ll go further &amp; say that immigrants aren’t the reason for their failures, it’s greedy swine like @realDonaldTrump who exploit their every need for profit, yet refuse to pay them a living wage.

@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC I understand your frustration. But deprogramming from 3 generations worth of antiSocialist propaganda doesn’t happen quickly. I’m seeking the middle ground to allay those fears, both rational, &amp; not.

@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Except I’m not asking you to give up anything. This system achieves all the same goals, but at least provides the potential for an amenable compromise for everyone. I don’t object to #SinglePayer personally, but others will never, ever accept it…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Public opinions shift slowly. Voters weren’t ready for a #PublicOption in 2009/2010. They aren’t ready for #SinglePayer now. But they’re more likely to take a #PublicOption as a decent alternative.	And ALL Insurers must be True NONProfits. I agree they can’t continue otherwise.
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC That was a mistake. And the #PublicOption didn’t generate a majority of support at the time. It’s a necessary ingredient that needs to be included this time, now that it has more support from voters. Opponents should be more likely to recognize it as a good compromise this time.
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Strict govt oversight over all of these aspects with the primary objective of delivering high quality, Affordable, Patient Centered Care to All Citizens.

@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …If you’re so convinced your way is the best, let the evidence present itself for all to see. There is no benefit to us being rigid about this. It doesn’t help us improve our system if we don’t even try to find potential compromises. That’s how a #DemocraticRepublic should work!
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …It would also contain more robust subsidies, &amp; a #PublicOption for Insurers to compete for customers w/on costs &amp; benefits.

@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Insurers would be strictly regulated to prevent excessive premiums/deductibles, be required to pay all bills from licensed MedicalProviders upfront, &amp; an #IndividualMandate for citizens to take #PersonalResponsibility for their potential healthcare liabilities…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC When a medical bill is generated, it should be paid. I don’t care if it’s Private, or Public personally, but some people care very deeply. This system allows consumers to choose, saves money, improves healthcare quality, &amp; can be agreed on by almost everyone.
@ComradeCalifor1 @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC @US_FDA @HHSGov And it’s a COMPROMISE!!! We NEED a workable compromise more than anything to get govt functioning like it should again. This could be it.
@ComradeCalifor1 @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC @US_FDA @HHSGov But this gives distance between the entities paying medical bills, those receiving payments, &amp; those deciding the validity of the bills.

@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …I don’t want greedy Insurers, or incompetent Politicians getting between me &amp; my Doctors. But I would trust qualified Bureaucrats w/medical expertise, &amp; w/out profit motives, to decide if Private Insurers need to pay for care prescribed medical from licensed Providers.
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …The #GermanBismarckModel would make Compromise possible by preventing the kind of govt takeover of healthcare that conservatives have spent decades scaring voters about w/propaganda, which makes it easier to get public buy in…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Compromise gives us stability, &amp; makes the solution more permanent. But Private plans that compete w/a #PublicOption for subscribers would also allow consumers the ability to choose from a range of plans that give them the Premium to Deductible ratios that works best for them…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …The #GermanBismarckModel already works to provide #UniversalCoverage, at lower costs, w/better healthcare results in #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan. But the real reason behind my proposal is we need both sides to Compromise to get stability in our healthcare system.
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …Patients don’t want to be treated in poorly managed medical facilities. We can still reduce the amount that MedicalProfessionals need some by doing more to make their medical training less expensive for them. These are all reasonable measures to help reduce underlying costs…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …These things would all significantly reduce the costs of medical care in this country. Yet Doctors, Nurses, &amp; Medical Technicians deserve high compensation for the life saving work they do. Even hospital admins should have high salaries to attract highly competent people…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC …I also think we should use tax dollars fully fund All essential Pharma R&amp;D to set means adjusted price caps on any medication, or medical technology that patients cannot reasonably be expected to refuse…
@ComradeCalifor1 @PascoBerniecrat @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Someone has to facilitate paying of expensive medical bills for Patients. The NONProfit aspect of Private Insurance in the #GermanBismarckModel eliminates the wasteful aspects of the “middle man.” But I agree that hospitals, if not MedicalProviders, should also be NONProfits…
@ComradeCalifor1 @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC @US_FDA @HHSGov …Excessive Premiums collected by Insurers could be used to provide reinsurance for Insurers w/high payouts resulting in Premium shortfalls, or refunded to subscribers. It wouldn’t fall on govt. And such bailouts would come w/salary penalties for the executives at those Insurers.
@ComradeCalifor1 @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders collectively bargain annually to set the rates for All Medical Services. The #IRS ensures Insurers operate as True NONProfits, w/reasonable salaries for employees. @US_FDA or @HHSGov monitors Medical Providers to prevent fraudulent billing…
@PascoBerniecrat @ComradeCalifor1 @arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @BernieSanders @DNC Private, NONProfit #GermanBismarckModel.

@floyd_patrick @CindySue821 @bearypatch @KamalaHarris I pay my own premiums. But the entire concept behind insurance is spreading the risk of high medical bills out across a wide pool of subscribers. That’s how insurance makes astronomical bills affordable for normal people. Others pay for you, so you can pay for others.
@shaunking Ugh! Why would anyone ever do anything to amplify@SarahPalinUSA’s idiotic voice?
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama #TinkleDown focuses on those at the top, but forgets the lesson taught by #HenryFord when he paid fair Wages. Workers are Customers! Even if they don’t buy all of your products, they shop in their communities. That gives other Workers the money they need to become your Customers!
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama …That’s why we should attach the #MinimumWage to a #ConsumerPriceIndex(#CPI) of the things Workers need. Then if the costs of Housing, Food, Healthcare, Childcare, or Transportation increase, wages would automatically keep pace in that community to continue driving #Demand.
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama …Money naturally moves up from the Roots/Consumers/Workers, to the Leaves/Business Owners. Without Wage Standards/Taxes to fund social programs that help Americans buy things they need from other Americans, there’s no guarantee that money returns from the Leaves to the Roots…
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama …The economy doesn’t grow through #TinkleDown. What we need to do is #WaterTheRoots to increase Consumer #Demand. By definition, increasing #Demand creates #JobGrowth. Increasing the #Supply of money BusinessOwners have on hand does nothing, if no one buys their products…
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama …Unless they immediately are offset w/increased Domestic wages, Tariffs &amp; #TradeWars will hurt #JobGrowth. As will stagnate Wages, &amp; the excessive accumulation of wealth in the pockets of Business Owners. Money needs to flow through the economy at all times. It can’t sit still…
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama …But yes, increasing the cost of production through Tariffs on materials is inherently bad for business. Every economist says that #TradeWars are cutting off our nose to spite our face. They make our products more expensive, which reduces #Demand…
@arrow_report @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Lowering the cost of business is secondary to increasing #Demand for products. Costs don’t matter when employers are required to pay workers enough to purchase at least the things they need, then other businesses will have to hire employees to sell them those things…

@atDavidHoffman We should adopt the Private, NONProfit aspects of Insurance in the #GermanBismarckModel to provide #UniversalCoverage for our citizens.
@oneintenman1 @anonys @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat Which is precisely why churches should have to keep track of their expenses, and have their services independently appraised to get corresponding TaxDeductions.	By the way, I love @iamjohnoliver!
@swingleft @Ann_Kirkpatrick @Ann_Kirkpatrick, after spending 55% of my income on healthcare in 2013, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs due to the #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions in the #ACA. Thank You for having the courage to make a principled stand on behalf of Americans!
Pay increases for #FederalWorkers lead to #ConsumerSpending in every community across the country. The #Demand that generates requires Private businesses to hire additional workers to keep up.	#FederalSpending = #JOBS!!! https://t.co/8XdRr3AurJ
@ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat The #1stAmendment prohibits the Govt from establishing any Religious preferences. So any effort to prove the existence of any Religion’s God would be inherently unConstitutional. But we can encourage Religious groups to improve their communities w/proportionate TaxDeductions.
@anonys @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat The best thing we could do to honor @SenJohnMcCain would be to pass #ComprehensiveCampaignFinanceReform to get Private money out of Politics, &amp; Public money out of Religion.

@anonys @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat The best way to do that is to provide religious organizations TaxDeductions that correspond w/their charitable activities in their communities. To qualify for these, they would need to function as True #NONProfit organizations &amp; show how their actions saved taxpayers money.
@FaithFortune99 @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat Yes, much simpler to provide deductions for charitable work churches provide to our communities.
@brugionyc @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat But yes, the tax money that hateful groups like #WBC are currently exempt from by claiming to be religious organizations could easily sure up our #SocialSafetyNet, &amp; provide funding for those of us who make a living trying to help our neighbors live happy, healthy lives.

@janet444 @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat Here is an older article that perfectly explains the difference between #FreedomOfReligion, &amp; using your religious beliefs to persecute others:	https://t.co/J1NFu0am9b
@darin_dupree @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat The criteria for TaxDeductions should be the dollar value of services a religious organization provides to a community to save taxpayers in that community. Provide $1,000 of food to the Poor, get $1,000 TaxDeduction. Build a house for the Homeless, deduct its value from taxes.
@MoffittJill @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat **Tax FearMongering Propaganda, disguised as Religion, to make a profit from of Hate! We can’t tax people for holding even ridiculous beliefs that we disagree with. That’s not Freedom, Liberty, or Justice! That’s Tyranny. And that’s not US!
@CHawksRun @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat …If they follow a religious calling to serve the public, that’s fine. But Religious organizations that receive tax deductions should be providing those services in a #NonProfit capacity. They shouldn’t be fleecing the Poor, and asking #UncleSam to give them tax breaks.
@CHawksRun @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat Neither do I, but I pay my taxes. They should too, unless they prove that they’re activities provide a social benefit that relieves a burden on taxpayers. So tax breaks if they feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, heal the sick, or provide more than just religious education…
@KikiCavendish11 @ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat #WBC? Absolutely NOTHING!! They degrade the fabric of society w/their virulent hate speech, &amp; toxic anti-intellectualism.
@CindySue821 @bearypatch @KamalaHarris It does! By the end of this year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs thanks to the #PatientProtections for #PreExistingConditions. So my life literally depends on it!
@RandyMa63934481 @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll I just hope for their sake he doesn’t ask for a demonstration… 😳😱😖🤢🤮
@ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat The existence of their God is irrelevant if they provide a social service. That is the only reason they should receive a Tax Deduction. Their contributions to society.
@ChefNavyblue @middlechildtake @Kokomothegreat No. It should be based on a group’s contributions to society. Preferably based how much their charitable activities save taxpayers in social safety net programs for the Poor, Elderly, &amp; Disabled.

@arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump #Demand for Labor alone has not led to growing wages.

@arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump And there is nothing “business friendly” about Tariffs, or a TradeWar. Both of these can raise prices for consumers, which reduces #Demand if nothing forces wages to keep pace. That’s why we should attach our #MinimumWage to a #ConsumerPriceIndex, so as prices rise, so do wages…
@arrow_report @TquanWrites @SageHillfarms @CharlesMBlow @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump No. Labor is different from milk, bc milk cannot go out and buy things after you pay for it. Labor generates #Demand. Without #Demand, there is no motivation for businesses to hire. Requiring a #LivingWage allows workers generate #Demand in their communities for things they need.

@JasonHalle @DJMIKE49 @GOP …Money naturally flows from Poor, to Rich as workers shop for the things they need.

@Boris8844 @PencilDickTrump @USAFacts @SocialSecurity @MedicaidGov @POTUS …As Citizens, we could donate an unlimited amount of time working for Campaigns, talk to our neighbors, wear buttons on our clothes, put signs in our yards, &amp; stickers on our cars. We could still write to newspapers, &amp; speak freely in public forums to support our candidates…
@Boris8844 @PencilDickTrump @USAFacts @SocialSecurity @MedicaidGov @POTUS …All Candidates who get a certain number of verifiable petition signatures would receive a decent amount of money from the govt to run their Campaigns.

@Boris8844 @PencilDickTrump @USAFacts @SocialSecurity @MedicaidGov It’s all about your perspective.

@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan …So my point was that #Paul’s Letters provide a shaky view of #Jesus’s moral teachings at best. Those who use his writings as an authority on what #Jesus commanded are ignorant of the historical facts.	Yet #Paul does have some authority on accepting outsiders, &amp; rejecting Dogma.
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan …According to #Paul, it was supposedly the “greedy” JewishPriests who had demanded #Jesus’s crucifixion for challenging their authority. This is what led to the myth of the Noble #Roman, #PontiusPilate, washing his hands of responsibility…
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan …After #Jesus’s death, #Paul had his conversion on the #RoadToDamascus. Shunned by the remaining #Disciples, #Paul set off to spread his version of the #Gospel to #DiasporaJews &amp; #Gentiles living in the #RomanEmpire. In #Paul’s narrative, the “BadGuys” weren’t the #Romans…
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan …The final straw was parading into #Jerusalem as the #Messiah, &amp; overturning the tables of the money changers in the Temple. #Jesus was crucified as “#KingOfTheJews.” Denoting that his death was due to his desire to usurp #Rome’s authority over #Israel…
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan …#Jesus was crucified for challenging #Rome’s authority to profit from the tributes poor Jews were coerced into giving to Priests. Every time #Jesus healed someone, or forgave their sins, he took money from the Priests, &amp; the #RomanEmpire that appointed them to collect taxes…
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan The vast majority of it the #NewTestament is in fact attributable to #Paul. My point is that relying on  #PaulineTheology is probably not the best way to discern what #Jesus would’ve done…
…We can make a scene, without being obscene. Only then will the other diners listen to us to see what is actually in all of our food. If they truly want to eat swamp rats, that makes things trickier. But even they can only stomach so much rat poison.

It’s definitely an agency that needs a moral gut check, &amp; a good Spring cleaning!
@RCKGreenwald @Blinke11 @TalbertSwan That was written by #Paul, AKA, #SaulOfTarsus. A #Pharisee, until he had a dramatic conversion. His ministry was primarily directed at the #Jews of the #Diaspora, &amp; #Gentiles in the #RomanEmpire. He never knew #Jesus in life. His teachings reflect a desire to ingratiate w/#Rome.

Tax refunds should repay taxpayers for their contributions that save the govt money.
@PencilDickTrump @USAFacts @SocialSecurity Income above $128K is untaxed for @SocialSecurity, but ALL income should be taxed for this valuable program.

@SarasotaMermaid @krztfr68 @ElizbethLManess @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton @DNC I do wish he wouldn’t have done that… But it hardly represents the kind of support for #Antifa, that rises to the level of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump calling #Nazis &amp; #WhiteSupremacists “Good People…”
@ElizbethLManess @NASA …Some private manufacturers may still offer products made completely w/US steel &amp; aluminum for higher prices. But it won’t be enough to bring those industries back to their glory days. That’s just how capitalism works! Tariffs are antithetical to the concept of “#FreeMarkets.”
@ElizbethLManess …As I said, I don’t mind the govt keeping some steel plants on life support. We should use US materials in military equipment, govt buildings, and for @NASA projects. We can also recycle the aluminum we can already have in this country to use US aluminum for govt projects…
@ElizbethLManess …That hurts dealerships, US autoworkers, domestic car companies, contractors, construction companies, &amp; most of all, it will raise prices for consumers. That would hurt job growth in every other sector…
@ElizbethLManess You may be prepared to pay dramatically higher prices for US steel &amp; aluminum. But contractors, &amp; automakers, who are looking at dramatically rising costs of production here in the US, aren’t happy. They know it will increase prices, which will decrease sales…
@ElizbethLManess @tomfriedman …Undoing environmental regulations, cruel immigration measures &amp; starting #TradeWars w/Tariffs won’t bring any jobs back to the US. Those things will just make us isolated, and less ready for the economy of the future. That will hurt US job growth.

@ElizbethLManess @tomfriedman …Rather than wasting money on pipelines for nonrenewable energy that will be exhausted in a generation. We should set about making use of our natural geography. Our desert SW, both coastlines, &amp; plains could provide our country with, or even export, wind &amp; solar energy…
@ElizbethLManess @tomfriedman …Domestic steel &amp; aluminum plants could be utilized to provide the materials to mass produce &amp; maintain solar panels &amp; wind turbines. We have ceded that entire global market to China without even trying to get in the game. That’s where the global market is going…
@ElizbethLManess @tomfriedman …However, we do have excellent opportunities to build the energy plants of the future here! Investing in clean, renewable energy sources could provide a wide range of jobs. Renewable energy is a wise investment, bc as our Supplies of Fossil Fuels dwindle, their costs will rise…
@ElizbethLManess But taxing it on the way back still adds to the cost for consumers. Price increases hurts retail based jobs. I appreciate the desire for electronics, steel &amp; aluminum plants, but even conservative @tomfriedman acknowledges that is unlikely to ever happen for the Private market…
@ElizbethLManess …Why are you so anti immigration? What have immigrants done to you? Don’t believe the #PussyGrabber in the @WhiteHouse, or his xenophobic rhetoric. The majority of them are good people, who simply want a better life for their families, &amp; they do the work US citizens won’t do.
@ElizbethLManess If we grant them a realistic pathway to citizenship, they could work, spend their money, and pay income &amp; payroll taxes, in addition to the sales taxes they already pay…
@ElizbethLManess How does stopping immigrants from coming here, working, and spending money on the things they need hurt our country? That takes tax money out of our country (yes, immigrants do pay taxes, but they get fewer benefits than citizens)
@ElizbethLManess I am very sorry to hear that. Cancer is a vicious disease, where our bodies betray us, and begin working to kill us. It must have been very difficult for your sister, and her children.
@ElizbethLManess I didn’t say Republicans were #Antifa. The modern day @GOP is full of #Fascists (@SpeakerRyan, or @SenateMajLdr haven’t stood up to @realDonaldTrump, or @StephenMillerAL).	#Antifa also opposes their policies. But being the enemy of our opponent, doesn’t make #Antifa our friends.
@ElizbethLManess …If the Rich “#JobCreators” have all the money, then no one else can afford to shop. Yet without customer #Demand for their products, why would the Rich hire anyone new?	This is the fundamental flaw in #TinkleDown Economics, and why	 we should #WaterTheRoots instead!
@ElizbethLManess Pay a Poor man $50 in the morning, and a Rich man will have before the sun sets. But at least the Poor man will have gotten something in exchange.	Money naturally flows up from the Poor, to the Rich. But without fair wages, &amp; taxes, it never finds its way back to customers…
@ElizbethLManess …I had a wonderful #NeuroOncologist while I was at @DukeU for my #BrainTumor who was from #India. He is a brilliant doctor, and a kind hearted man! There is no better doctor in all the world.
@ElizbethLManess …And how would we “import” doctors?Doctor from other countries that are skilled enough to practice here, they should be welcomed. They have valuable skills that help fill a crucial need. Doctors from other countries practicing here, still pay taxes on their income here…
@ElizbethLManess If the products are available domestically at a reasonable price, that’s where they should be obtained from when using tax dollars…
@ElizbethLManess …It also prevents money from stagnating in the deep pockets of the Rich. By finding ways to return money back to workers, they keep it flowing through our economy by shopping for the things they need.	#WaterTheRoots… That’s #HowTheEconomyGrows!
@ElizbethLManess …Yet we do need citizens, &amp; especially wealthy business owners to do their part to pay for high quality schools, well trained law enforcement, the best military in the world, and other public services. This improves the quality of life in our communities…
@ElizbethLManess …If those workers earn a #LivingWage, they can afford to shop at other businesses to keep money flowing. And the owners of the Private businesses selling Goods&amp;Services would benefit from having additional customers who earn a #LivingWage to buy their products…
@ElizbethLManess …We can use federal funding to increase the salaries for Teachers, Cops, Firefighters, &amp; SocialWorkers all across the country. That’d allow them to shop for Goods&amp;Services in their communities, which would place #Demand on Private businesses to hire more workers to serve them…
@ElizbethLManess …But the “#FreeMarket” makes it unlikely that Private companies will choose to move production here, without raising prices to cover the higher costs of materials. One thing we still have to offer in the absence of major domestic manufacturing, is a market for public services…
@ElizbethLManess The reason manufacturing has moved abroad is bc it’s cheaper to make things overseas. There can still be a role for US manufacturing for Defense equipment, or infrastructure materials. If the govt needs steel, it should certainly come from this country…
@ElizbethLManess No. In order to assemble cars here in the US, automakers import cheap materials, like steel &amp; aluminum, from other countries. Getting materials locally, or paying tariffs on them will increase the cost of their final product. That could force companies to move assembly abroad.
@ElizbethLManess Tax Dollars pay for Govt benefits for Poor&amp;Disabled Americans to pay other Americans for Goods&amp;Services they need. #SNAP/ #FoodStamps, #Sect8/ #HousingChoiceVouchers, @SocialSecurity/ #SSDI, &amp; other programs lead directly to Domestic spending to create #NonExportable, #US Jobs!
@ElizbethLManess It’s not the workers who we want to raise taxes on. It’s employers who get rich by underpaying their workers, forcing them to rely on the #SocialSafety net for survival. Increased wages for workers leads to more spending……
@ElizbethLManess @krztfr68 @SarasotaMermaid @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton @DNC We do denounce #Antifa, as has been unequivocally demonstrated.
@krztfr68 @ElizbethLManess @SarasotaMermaid @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton @DNC Yes!! Precisely like that...		BOOM! https://t.co/QobVZyC5OA
@SarasotaMermaid @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton I understand. I know I will never convince her, but I intended on continuing to respond to her #AlternativeFacts, with real ones. My hope is that someone else who is undecided may read this thread, and be able to discern the Truth by comparing our responses.
@ElizbethLManess @SarasotaMermaid @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton @DNC No one wants #UndocumentedImmigrants “flooding across the border.” We want #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform that makes it more realistic for #Refugees to seek #Asylum in our country. We don’t oppose borders, or even a vetting system. So long as it’s fair, &amp; respectful of humanity!
@ElizbethLManess @krztfr68 @SarasotaMermaid @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton @DNC I oppose groups that utilizes violence to get their way politically. Even if I sympathized with #Antifa’s overall goal of mitigating the effects of Fascism &amp; Racism, I put them in the same repugnant, indefensible category as #Nazis &amp; the #KKKlan due to their violent tactics…

@ElizbethLManess Again. It was. And the benefits of it being so is that it leads to increased spending, which leads to more Jobs.
@ElizbethLManess It was always intended. Under #FDR, we passed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, to establish the 1st MinimumWage. #Roosevelt previously said, “…no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.”
@ElizbethLManess And money does NOT “Trickle” down from owners to workers. After the initial seed is planted, money flows from the roots/workers/customers, up to the owners. Give a poor man money, &amp; a rich man will have it by nightfall.
@ElizbethLManess Yes! Except the strategy of giving Wealthy “#JobCreators” yuge tax cuts to increase their Supply of capital (the basis of #SupplySideEconomics) doesn’t actually lead to increased jobs. See my widget example on the other post.
@ElizbethLManess @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov @Ford …But if you have a million widgets, and a $1billion, and everyone can afford to buy the widgets they want by the bucket, you’d probably hire workers to help you sell your widgets, &amp; make some new ones to keep up with the demand too.
@ElizbethLManess @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov @Ford …You can have billions widgets, &amp; an infinite supply of cash, but if no one buys widgets cause they can’t afford them, it’s unlikely that you’ll hire anyone to sell your widgets…
@ElizbethLManess @SocialSecurity @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov @Ford No, wage stagnation as a result of #TinkleDown / #VooDooEconomic Theory under #Reagan undervalued labor &amp; consumption, while over valuing a supply of capital. Demand drives growth. Not Supply…
@ElizbethLManess Yes. It’ll be too expensive to bring those jobs back with tariffs. Tariffs increase the price of Goods&amp;Services, without increasing consumers’ purchasing power to create the kind of #Demand that leads to hiring.
@ElizbethLManess …If we don’t want to borrow money to support our Labor Force, we should levy additional taxes on any employer making above a certain amount, who doesn’t pay their employees a livable wage, thus requiring them to seek public assistance. Inadequate pay, no one shops. No Jobs!
@ElizbethLManess …If wages are insufficient, or an individual is incapable of working, govt programs that help underpaid workers, or disabled Americans pay other Americans for the Goods&amp;Services they need to fuel our economy, aka “welfare,” is necessary…
@ElizbethLManess The economy functions when money flows from workers/consumers up the supply chain to providers. But the money must flow back down in the form of wages to the workers who sustain that supply chain, and also the customers who create the #Demand for Goods&amp;Services on the providers…
@ElizbethLManess Yes, helping Poor&amp;Disabled Americans pay other Americans for services they need is our biggest budgetary expense. But it leads directly to increased consumer spending, &amp; JOBS, which create additional tax revenue.	We only borrow to pay for it bc we don’t collect enough in taxes.
@ElizbethLManess Where does the law say that we can’t grant Asylum for other reasons?
@ElizbethLManess They don’t bring higher rates of crime, and, “…not only does illegal immigration not increase crime, but it may actually contribute to the drop in overall crime rates.”	https://t.co/Taa8K1clJg
@baseballfan4204 @ElizbethLManess We, the People of the #UnitedStates are a nation of immigrants. We were founded by immigrants, of immigrants, and for immigrants. Providing a light🗽 for desperate people of the world is fundamentally American🇺🇸.	FYI, many of these immigrants descended from #NativeAmericans!
@baseballfan4204 @ElizbethLManess That’s why we need #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform, w/Realistic pathways for Legal Migration…
@ElizbethLManess Then we need to make the Legal pathway more Realistic &amp; Reasonable for Desperate &amp; Deserving Families.
@lenabenas21 @krassenstein @SpeakerRyan @DevinNunes @POTUS …And as usual, @SpeakerRyan wants to pay for #TinkleDown Tax Cuts. by slashing funding for govt programs that help Poor&amp;Disabled Americans, pay other Americans for the services they need. @realDonaldTrump &amp; @DevinNunes are just a useful idiots for that purpose.
@lenabenas21 @krassenstein @SpeakerRyan @DevinNunes @POTUS …The problem is @SpeakerRyan really believes in his #VooDooEconomics. He has already laid his Tax Cuts for the Wealthy “#JobCreators” on his altar to #AynRand. He expects that we PeeOns will fall for their#TinkleDown TaxCut Scam, yet Again…
@lenabenas21 @krassenstein @SpeakerRyan He could, but @SpeakerRyan is a Weasel/Snake/Worm. Deceitful, Venomous, &amp; Spineless! As #AynRand’s Acolyte, he’d rather use @DevinNunes as a pawn to protect his precious #TinkleDown TaxCuts, &amp; the #TRE45ONOUS @POTUS who helped him put them in place…

@SarasotaMermaid @ElizbethLManess @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton …And that brings us back to #GDubyaShrub ignoring warnings about #Osama, &amp; used “#EnhancedInterrogation” to get phony evidence to invade #Iraq, to finish his #Daddy’s job by getting #Saddam, &amp; allowing his #VP #DICKcheney’s #Haliburton to extract oil, &amp; win DefenseContracts.
@SarasotaMermaid @ElizbethLManess @ACLU @cjchivers @BillClinton …#Clinton also pursued #Osama as much as he could w/a #Congress that preferred to focus on the intrigue surrounding the #MonicaLewinskyScandal.

@SarasotaMermaid @ElizbethLManess @ACLU @cjchivers …After the tragedy in #Rwanda, @BillClinton intervened in #Bosnia &amp; #Kosovo to stop #Christian #Serbs from committing #Genocide against #Muslims there.

@SarasotaMermaid @ElizbethLManess @ACLU @cjchivers …#DaddyBush set up bases in #SaudiArabia to protect his #SaudiRoyal allies oil interests. That infuriated the same #ArabMujahideen fighters we had just helped to established #alQaeda under #Osama. They turned their religious extremism against us…

@ElizbethLManess The Law doesn’t prevent granting #Asylum for those reasons, &amp; it should be required to accept those fleeing any dangerous conditions. We are hardly too generous with our welfare system…
@ElizbethLManess I don’t think they’re more important. But they’re our neighbors, &amp; we can do more to help them. #Australia, #Japan, &amp; #European countries should put aside their own Nationalist agendas, and do more to help those other #Refugees. But we should do what we can to assist them too.
@ElizbethLManess Still there are many who are in fact fleeing the gang violence that erupted after Civil Wars ripped their countries apart for decades. Civil Wars that followed US backed coups to overthrow democratically elected govts.
@ElizbethLManess Economic reasons stemming from Centuries of exploitation at the hands of European settlers, &amp; political sabotage to fight “#Communism” during the #ColdWar. Their economies are crap bc of our policies in regards to their natural resources &amp; cheap labor. EconomicViolence kills too!
@JustSayingIt @ElizbethLManess …The “#BadHombres” are in fact the rarity, &amp; not vice versa. The majority are desperate #Refugees, seeking opportunities for their families. Either to escape the violence, or to simply earn enough money to support themselves.
@JustSayingIt @ElizbethLManess …And yes, I know that there are some #UndocumentedImmigrants are not #Refugees. There are even some who have nefarious intentions, that could be described as “#BadHombres.” These Drug &amp; SexTraffickers should be the focus of our ImmigrationCrackdowns. Not innocent families!…
@JustSayingIt @ElizbethLManess Have you been to #CentralAmerica? Have you spoken to those who are claiming #Asylum to hear what their personal experiences are? I have. I’ve been to the #CasaDelMigrante in #Guatemala to hear their stories…
…I’m not accusing @realDonaldTrump, the @GOP, or their supporters “Racist” as an ad hominem attack to distract from the underlying issues. If it isn’t xenophobia that generates these discriminatory policies against #Refugee #AsylumSeekers from Central&amp;SouthAmerica, what is it?!?
…LegalImmigration- As stated, we need to reduce the wait times, &amp; financial costs associated w/the Legal pathway to make the LegalImmigration a realistic option!	The current LegalSystem is completely unrealistic in the face of the dangers they’re fleeing:	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
…NationalSecurity- Making Legal Immigration more realistic for innocent #Asylum seekers would make it much easier to find identify the Real “#BadHombres.” The current system forces good people to associate w/criminals, &amp; break the law in order to save their families…
…Sovereignty- The Sovereignty of Central&amp;SouthAmerican countries was routinely ignored during the #ColdWar by the US when we overthrew their democratically elected govts to install Dictators who were friendly to US companies exploiting their resources &amp; labor for cheap goods…
…SelfReliance- Easier said than done in the economic conditions these Refugees are fleeing. Central&amp;SouthAmerica have been exploited by European settlers for Centuries. This puts their people at a severe disadvantage in regards to SelfReliance…
But let’s address all of these:	Accountability- Why shouldn’t the US accept some for the abysmal conditions in Central&amp;SouthAmerica?	Rule of law- We’re advocating for changes in the Laws to make legal immigration for Asylum seekers a realistic option. Currently it’s unrealistic… https://t.co/yA5Sim184P

And that wasn’t nearly as complicated as receiving stolen documents from foreign hackers. #MuellerIsComing!	https://t.co/6aA6pyTpCx
@PereGrimmer @ElizbethLManess No one said anything about giving anyone $20Million in cash… This isn’t about giving anybody, anything. It’s about allowing innocent people to come work in our country to improve their lives, &amp; enrich ours.
@ElizbethLManess It’s a matter of probability. The likelihood of someone from these regions being murdered is exponentially greater than that of people in the US. Those who felt that the difficult journey here was worth the risk, clearly felt they had no other option. Why shouldn’t we take them?
@ElizbethLManess 100 miles wouldn’t be enough. Out of the pan, into the fire so to speak. Their only realistic opportunity to escape is to come to the US. If the legal pathway is blocked, coming in illegally is the only option left. Your option does not exist in their world.
@ElizbethLManess Because you still don’t seem to appreciate the feelings of #HumanBeings who had the misfortune of being born in dangerous places…
@ElizbethLManess Race/ethnicity, same difference. You’re really splitting hairs over whether you’re a racist, or a xenophobe? You’re acting like a heartless, asshole either way!
@ElizbethLManess Did you choose your place of birth?	Did you have any control over who your parents were?	Do you really think that they choose theirs?
@ElizbethLManess If it’s not their brown skin, then you tell me what makes people from an ethnic region different from ours unworthy of seeking Asylum? If it’s not those fleeing violence, &amp; abject poverty, who would be worthy of Asylum?
@ElizbethLManess They have no other realistic way to escape a life of misery, and probable violent death for their families. Do you think they want to be undocumented? No! It’s not a choice. It’s their only possible escape. They are #HumanBeings! They laugh, Love, &amp; cry, just like the rest of us!
@ElizbethLManess How long would you wait to move your family, if a local gang was trying to recruit them? How would you come up with the thousands of dollars necessary to apply, if there were no good jobs available?	This is what the “legal migration” pathway looks like:	https://t.co/lVGrQOVQFT
@ElizbethLManess They didn’t elect drug lords. Drug lords seized power in their countries. If they even bother having elections, there’s only one name that they actually count votes for.	They wouldn’t be “illegal,” if we fixed our system so that legal migration could be a realistic option.
@ElizbethLManess Why would you make such a categorically racist statement? Do you even recognize that is what you have done?		You’ve judged the entire American population South of the Texas border as being inferior.		What does it cost you personally to show a little compassion for these families?
@ElizbethLManess Why not? Are they not #HumanBeings? Do they not experience love, joy, fear, &amp; pain just like the rest of us? Is their children’s blood a different shade of red when it is needlessly spilt? You’d probably still send ship loads of Jewish Refugees back to #NaziGermany, wouldn’t you?
@ElizbethLManess If you want to send these Innocent #Refugees back to the horrors of their homelands, you owe it to them to try to understand why they’re trying so desperately to esc, &amp; how we helped to create many of those horrors. They’re merely #Scapegoats to distract you w/false fears.
@ElizbethLManess Uh huh. I’m sure you find your #AlternativeFacts much more interesting, but the #RussianBots were working for @realDonaldTrump.	And I’m not defending communism. I just oppose interfering w/other countries elections. I believe in self determination by a Majority of We, the People.
@ElizbethLManess …They’ll probably start by blaming local corruption in their govts, but they’re also likely to mention that the corruption is in part the fallout from US interference during the #ColdWar.
@ElizbethLManess Go to #CentralAmerica, and ask the people there why so many of them feel they have no other choice but to come to the US. Ask how their countries came to be in the dire state that they are currently in…
@ElizbethLManess …That’s what the people who I met both times I was in #Guatemala said happened to their country. That’s why they say there is so much violence&amp;poverty there. And escaping violence&amp;poverty are the reasons why #Refugees claim they are seeking a better life here in the US.
@ElizbethLManess What have I said is false? Is the US not the primary market for the DrugCartels? Did we not overthrow democratically elected govts, and install dictators that allowed private US companies to exploit their natural resources, &amp; cheap labor?…
@ElizbethLManess #Venezuela is a prime example of US interference in the 1950s undermining the stability of a country by installing an antiCommunist Dictator. The modern problems there are likely rooted in the violence that we started to exploit their oil supplies for our own use &amp; profits.
@ElizbethLManess …But it’s also undeniable that the US is the biggest market for the Cartels’ illicit products. The money made from US buyers due to #Prohibition policies funds the Cartels’ violence in Central&amp;SouthAmerica. We’d better off paying to help treat addictions for opioids&amp;cocaine.
@ElizbethLManess …The clearest example of US govt support for a Cartel is #Reagan’s involvement to help the #Contras overthrow the #Sandinista in #Nicaragua as part of the #IranContraScandal. One of the many ways #StRonnieReagan’s crusade against communism backfired.	https://t.co/SNEY5CM9CF…
@ElizbethLManess Yes, both are applicable. It’s not an either, or situation. We’re not talking about 1 country, or even just 1 Cartel. Each case is different, but 1 way or another the US has exacerbated the problem of Cartels in Central&amp;SouthAmerica…

@nancela4 @Htygrett1 @ginnyang @ImCraigStevens @JamieOsta @MichaelAvenatti Thank you!!!😉😁
@MaryBallentin10 Thank you for passing it all!
@ginnyang @Htygrett1 @ImCraigStevens @JamieOsta @MichaelAvenatti That’s how I feel about it!
@ElizbethLManess @SarasotaMermaid @ACLU In some cases, yes! The US govt helped Cartels rise to power to undermine democratically elected govts. In other cases, we merely provide the Demand for their product that keeps them in power. Like how Prohibition empowered Bootleggers, the #WarOnDrugs has empowered the Cartels.
@Soapnexis @jacobsoboroff @ACLU Agreed! We should seize all their assets, have their citizenship revoked, and permanently deport them to the #CzechRepublic immediately… https://t.co/88YkpSsqCt
@jacobsoboroff @ACLU Wait, they want written confirmation from the parents, who are very likely illiterate, that they want their kids back? How about some financial compensation from the @realDonaldTrump administration for their travel expenses, &amp; undue emotional/psychological trauma this caused?
@jacobsoboroff @ACLU @mitchellreports **We, the People did NOT vote for @realDonaldTrump to be @POTUS. the #ElectoralCollege did. But despite his denials, his administration implemented these policies. If they want the @ACLU to help, that’s fine, but they should pay all the expenses, &amp; provide necessary assistance.
@catladyyyyy1995 @JaneidyEve @ACLU What country were your ancestors from? Many of these immigrants are descended from indigenous Americans, displaced &amp; oppressed by European settlers for Centuries. Why shouldn’t you be sent back to the country you came from? https://t.co/DjoSdWuQOF
@Lahoio @Calabria1961 @ACLU @nj11forchange As I understand it, under @BarackObama, unaccompanied minors were temporarily detained until they could figure out what to do with them.

@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …There are numerous other advantages as well. By increasing pay for service industry jobs, we would raise the quality of those services. This benefits the least among us (who many conservatives believe #Jesus called us to serve) &amp; improves the quality of life in our communities.
@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …It may seem counter productive to business owners to pay higher taxes to fund their customers’ service jobs, so they can buy the company’s product. But how else will consumers earn the money necessary to buy their product if all the labor that manufactured it resides overseas…
@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …I know raising taxes on those who generate most of our profits seems counterintuitive. But it should be seen as the only way to #WaterTheRoots to help domestic consumers earn sufficient wages to purchase the products that American companies are producing cheaply overseas…
@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …This flies in the face of conservative #TinkleDown policies which suppose that providing corporate tycoons with TaxCuts is the only way to generate JOBS.

@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump @MedicareGov @MedicaidGov …Citizens who do reap global profits at executive levels will also need to be taxed at sufficient rates to fund service industry jobs for the rest of us.

@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump …While we need to maintain some basic manufacturing capabilities, @realDonaldTrump’s insistence that getting tough on #China will bring back all those jobs is unrealistic.

@joycely40544984 @LjollyRenay @BenFrankB @MichaelAvenatti @tomfriedman @realDonaldTrump …Where his personal experiences limit his scope of observation, is his assertion that those Americans who previously occupied those types of jobs will merely need to improve their skills to move up to a higher position in the chain of production.

@WontMarch4Soros …Would you do me a favor? Would you be willing to write your Congress Rep and tell them you would support a Private, Nonprofit healthcare compromise based loosely on the #GermanBismarckModel? Just describe the system of Nonprofit co-ops, and the other things you support.
@WontMarch4Soros Completely agree! I personally wouldn’t object to #SinglePayer, but I respect the concerns about mismanagement by incompetent administrations enough that I sought a middle ground. Everything doesn’t have to be a purity test. Now if we can just get the politicians on board…
@WontMarch4Soros In #Germany, the trade unions form most of the co-ops for their members. But employers are required to pay a livable wage, so even part time workers who have multiple employers can afford Indepent coverage, if they work full time hours overall.
@WontMarch4Soros …Same would go of part time employees. Wages should be adequate so that if employees work full time through multiple employers, they can afford to pay for their own independent policy on a market place. This would work in a “GigEconomy,” where workers cobble together a living.
@WontMarch4Soros …If employers don’t provide insurance directly, or if employees don’t like the coverage offered for whatever reason, employers should be required to pay enough so employees can afford to find a reasonable alternative in an independent market place, w/no penalties…
@WontMarch4Soros I believe how it works in #Germany is the trade unions form co-ops for most. But employees are free to shop around, and All employers must pay adequate wages to make insurance affordable for anyone who works full time hours. So basically All employers pay a livable minimum wage…
@WontMarch4Soros Likewise! It is always refreshing to be able to talk with someone, rather than scream past one another. I did not seek an education on healthcare systems to win arguments for “my side.” I NEED a working system so that I can survive, &amp; continue to function in society. Thank you!!
@YParaquat @CheckersEsq @FaeryQueene73 @silencedCRNA @the_unachiever @MissBossyBoots_ @KimSalsman @marla_redd @Bearclaw93 @PlatypusStyle @LeslieCockburn @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Hahahahaha!! Yea, I’m just gonna go look for an ATM…	Am I wrong?	No…	Am I wrong?	No Walter, you’re not wrong. You’re just an asshole!
@WontMarch4Soros …I would also apply our collective funding strength to lower prescription drug prices. Cash rewards for developing Cures to serious health problems would incentivize PharmaceuticalCompanies to focus on more than just #BonerPills, which is all that the “#FreeMarket” rewards!
@WontMarch4Soros …I am basing my fixes on the systems used in #Germany, #France, #Japan &amp; other leading countries to give citizens lower costs, &amp; better healthcare results…
@WontMarch4Soros Understood. That’s why I want to incorporate the Private, NONProfit aspects of the #GermanBismarckModel into the #ACA to fix it. The #ACA was a great First step in the right direction. It’s time to take the next one by following the recommendations I am making…
@WontMarch4Soros I think co-ops are a wonderful option! They would be the backbone of the system I am proposing. I know we need to #FIXtheACA by taking profits out of health insurance at the very least. And out of #BigPharma when it comes to meds that Patients can’t reasonably refuse to buy.
@WontMarch4Soros Thank you!! Zed is the only one who really worries me… He likes to end things.
@Tim43647873 @SenKamalaHarris Uh huh… #MoronBot…
@WontMarch4Soros You mentioned being able to select your docs. By getting All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders to collectively bargain to set rates annually, we would completely eliminate networks. All Licensed MedicalProviders would be fully covered by All Insurers!
@WontMarch4Soros That’s fine. So long as it covers the EssentialHealthBenefits required by Federal standards for coverage, a religious based Co-op would fit perfectly well within the #GermanBismarckModel!
@WontMarch4Soros @MedicareGov …And we don’t pay for our own care. We put our money in a pool to pay for the needs of everyone in the pool. Plus, once we’re old enough, other people are more likely to be paying for our care, than vice versa. After a certain age, the Premiums we pay all come back to us anyway.
@WontMarch4Soros Old men technically can still get younger women pregnant. But, after 65, they’re on @MedicareGov, &amp; they’d only pay for supplemental policies. So older people  effectively don’t pay for maternity care…
@WontMarch4Soros …However, unless it is Truly a religious based organization, like a Church (AKA: Not @HobbyLobby, or @ChickfilA!), I do think that employer based coverage should at the very least pay for birth control. Owners shouldn’t be able to violate the Privacy Rights of their employees.
@WontMarch4Soros …And while I personally believe women should have full sovereignty over their own bodies, I would even support your Right to buy a policy that wouldn’t pay for abortions. So long as affordable plans that do pay for them &amp; birth control are still available for everyone…
@WontMarch4Soros …But I do respect your desire to pick a Private plan, with a Premium/Deductible balance that is appropriate for your situation. The #GermanBismarckModel I’m recommending does precisely that. In #Germany it actually consists mostly of the kind of Co-ops you’re describing…
@WontMarch4Soros …That’s why we need an #IndividualMandate that everyone take responsibility for their potential healthcare needs by getting coverage annually. So we don’t end up paying for freeloaders who wait until they get sick to get coverage. They have to pay for their future care now, too!
@WontMarch4Soros We pay Premiums for others to get care today, so others will pay for us when we need it. That’s just how All Insurance works. To avoid freeloaders, everyone needs to be required to take PersonalResponsibility for their own potential healthcare liabilities by obtaining coverage…
@WontMarch4Soros …But if in that group of 100, each person had their own $100K illness to pay for, the costs for the group would skyrocket. Healthy might have cheap coverage, but those people would still be responsible for their own $100K, making Insurance meaningless for those who need it most.
@WontMarch4Soros …Take 100 people. 1 has a Cancer that costs $100K to cure. It would cost each person $1,000 to make that person better m. Now make it 1,000 people, &amp; everyone only has to pay $100. 10,000 people would pay $10 each, and so on…
@WontMarch4Soros …But if I get syphoned off into a pool of other “#HighRisk” Individuals with expensive healthcare needs, the costs of covering all us rises dramatically. We need the Premiums from healthy subscribers to offset our high costs…
@WontMarch4Soros …My monthly refills of that medicine cost me $1,203/month until I reached a $5K Deductible in 2013. Now I only pay a $40 copay even before my $850 Deductible, &amp; I get twice as many pills/month. That’s bc of #CostSharingReductions (#CSR) in the #ACA for low income subscribers…
@WontMarch4Soros For the most part. Fred (my name for the tumor) has been dead for more than 12yrs now, &amp; no signs of Ted, Ned, or Zed so far. But I did develop a mild version of narcolepsy after my treatment. Now I need to take a pill just to wake up &amp; function like a human being…

@realDonaldTrump Getting nervous, @realDonaldTrump? Perhaps a bit desperate? Good! The more irrationally you act, the easier it will be for #Mueller to convict you! https://t.co/e05kkeaHSt
@WontMarch4Soros …It’s also not right to penalize groups of people for things beyond their control. Men might be able not get pregnant, but women can’t get pregnant entirely without us either. So it’s fair for us to pay towards maternity care coverage. Healthy babies benefit our whole country!
@WontMarch4Soros …But health insurance doesn’t work that way. We can have higher Premiums for smokers, or people who knowingly take avoidable risks. Yet many things are beyond a person’s control in healthcare, so we All need comprehensive coverage for all those potential healthcare liabilities…
@WontMarch4Soros …Sorry if that sounds socialist to you, but that’s just how All Insurance works. We have a degree of control over how we drive, so car insurance prices can reasonably be varied in price based on driving records &amp; the risks individuals represent to the Insurer…
@WontMarch4Soros …We don’t pay our Premiums just to cover the illnesses we have today. That would entirely defeat the purpose of Insurance. All Insurance works using our money to help pay for others to be treated today, so that they can help pay for us when we inevitably need it in the future…
@WontMarch4Soros …Healthy ppl get hit by cars too. You might not have Cancer today, but the future is uncertain. I was 22, &amp; in excellent health when I found a #BrainTumor in my head that cost# $450K to remove &amp; repair the damage. I was just lucky, &amp; my Dad had a policy that covered my care…
@WontMarch4Soros Well, that’s fine, except as someone w/#PreExistingConditions, I know that if healthy people only buy the coverage that they need while they’re healthy, that means people who need more care now will have to pay discriminatory prices for the care we need again…
@Tim43647873 @SenKamalaHarris Keep trying to deflect. I never said anything related to Marxist, or Communist policy. If you could read, you could look into the stuff I post, &amp; see I that I advocate for Compromise between #Socialist #SinglePayer, &amp; #SurvivalOfTheRichest #Capitalism when it comes to healthcare.

I could even accept some exceptions for such religious based groups on #BirthControl services, so long as other viable options that do offer them are available in each community.

@WontMarch4Soros …But, by getting All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders to collectively bargain to set rates for All medical services nationwide, we would end the need for networks. By establishing National Standards for coverage, we would end #StateLine restrictions on policies.
@WontMarch4Soros Yes, it would! Those groups would just have to meet the national standards for coverage. An impediment to selling across StateLines currently are Networks. It does no good to get a cheap policy based in NY, if you live in Wyoming, &amp; the closest in Network Provider is in Buffalo…

@JusticeGirl2950 @Ike008 @tribelaw @POTUS …This would differ greatly from the GOP’s attempts to make Obama a 1 term POTUS, bc the primary goal would still be to ensure the safety &amp; welfare of the American people.

@LeslieCockburn @US_FDA @HHSGov …Additional savings can come by offering cash rewards for discovering Cures to pressing medical problems of our time &amp; funding all Research&amp;Development for essential medications to justify PriceCaps for drugs Patients can’t reasonably refuse. “#FreeMarket” can deal #BonerPills!
@pacelattin They don’t know the origins of #AnotherOneBitesTheDust, or #BohemianRhapsody by #Queen either, but they’ll ironically belt #WeWillRockYou at a ballgame in ignorance… After all, @realDonaldTrump did say he loves poorly educated voters… Yea, they’re easier for him to dupe!
@eyedoc59 @RepAdamSchiff @bobmuellerwkrn We, the People of the #UnitedStates demand that @realDonaldTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, @jaredkushner, the #TrumpCrimeFamily, and their @GOP &amp; #Russian CoConspirators are All brought to Justice!
@LeslieCockburn @US_FDA @HHSGov …This is not an unproven system. World leaders like #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan already use similar systems to provide their citizens w/#UniversalCoverage at lower costs, &amp; achieves better healthcare results for Patients (the real purpose of healthcare)…
@LeslieCockburn @US_FDA @HHSGov …Being True NONProfits reduces the overhead costs for Insurance, while collective bargaining, along w/Federal funding for medical training &amp; malpractice insurance limits the underlying Medical costs…
@LeslieCockburn …While #IRS ensures that Insurers are True NONProfit, @US_FDA, or @HHSGov could monitor MedicalProviders to prevent fraudulent billing. That means Insurers wouldn’t have profit motives for denying legit claims, and that improves healthcare results for Patients…
@LeslieCockburn …1st, All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders must collectively bargain to set the rates for All medical services annually. Then Insurers are required to automatically pay any bills from licensed MedicalProviders, no questions asked. No Networks. No PriorAuthorizations. No 🐃💩!…
@LeslieCockburn …@LeslieCockburn, I urge you to #FIXtheACA by adapting Private, NONProfit aspects of Insurance from the #GermanBismarckModel. It would be a Compromise between #SinglePayer &amp; #SurvivalOfTheRichest. Here’s how it works…
@LeslieCockburn After this year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs due to #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions in the #ACA. Before the Law, I spent $1,203/month for refills of my narcolepsy medication until I reached a $5K Deductible. These 💩plans will make real coverage unaffordable…

@RealTwitish @IShallResist @Kariseattle @MariaGr76169744 @krassenstein Nothing solid on its own, but it fits right in with a pattern of international corruption &amp; money laundering for the sake of personal profit in the #TrumpCrimeFamily… I refuse to give them the benefit of the doubt at this point.
@DugganFlanfire @pacNWlady @Jackfax2005 @SallyQYates …So, how many abortions do you think @realDonaldTrump’s mistresses have been forced to get over the years? I grant you that due to various #NDAs, we don’t know just how often Donny has had to pay for abortions. But are Trump’s sham marriages morally better than #LGBT marriages?
@DugganFlanfire @pacNWlady @Jackfax2005 @SallyQYates I’d agree that the issue is irrelevant, if conservatives didn’t constantly invoke their supposed moral superiority into public policy…
@DugganFlanfire @pacNWlady @Jackfax2005 @SallyQYates C’mon… You really think @realDonaldTrump isn’t screwing bimbos in the @WhiteHouse right now? 🤣😂🤣 Get real! He’s probably got a button for whores next to his one for Diet Cokes!

@Kariseattle @IShallResist @RealTwitish @MariaGr76169744 @krassenstein …I had a #BrainTumor removed in 2006. By 2013, I was spending 55% of my income on healthcare, including $1,203/month for monthly refills of my narcolepsy medicine until I reached a $5,000 Deductible. After this year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs thanks to the #ACA!

@IShallResist @RealTwitish @Kariseattle @MariaGr76169744 @krassenstein Right, and preemptive pardons would be an admission of his own guilt. Based on the little we already know, #Jr is the one with his neck way out there. He almost has to be charged early, but your speculation that #Mueller is waiting to avoid Trump issuing pardons makes sense.
@CasyRybeck @bjdmama @jessteppo @BeeNewsDaily @RepAdamSchiff …What matters most is not the literal belief in the Resurrection as atonement for our sins, but the way we treat other people. In #James2:14-26, the brother of #Jesus is credited with explaining that Faith without Works is Dead. He said, “Even the Demons believe, and shudder!”
@CasyRybeck @bjdmama @jessteppo @BeeNewsDaily @RepAdamSchiff Like the Jews of #Jesus’s time, they get distracted by the dogma surrounding the “sins” of others, like homosexuality, &amp; abortion. But #Jesus said in #Matthew15:11 about the kosher food laws, it’s not what one puts in ones mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of it…
@KirstenAllison @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS …That makes @realDonaldTrump’s tweet an obvious attempt by @POTUS to influence an on going investigation, which is also known as #ObstructionOfJustice!
@KirstenAllison @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS …Given @POTUS’s position relative to the #AttorneyGeneral, public statements suggesting the #AG SHOULD end the #SpecialCounsels investigation can be seen as a direct order from someone who could fire the #AttorneyGeneral…
@KirstenAllison @RepAdamSchiff #AttorneyGeneralJeffersonBeauregardSessionsIII is supposed to be America’s top prosecuter. But @POTUS can technically replace him whenever he wants. However, if he does so to cover up a crime that he is implicated in, that would be a glaring example of #ObstructionOfJustice…
@HomefryDaddy @hey_jude2u @jerryjamesstone @RepAdamSchiff As @POTUS, even making suggestions for what people in the @TheJusticeDept, especially those in positions you directly oversee in your role as #President, Should do regarding an open investigation that involves you, Should be regarded as a brazen attempt to #ObstructJustice!
@DeniseSog1 @kcds1126Karen @Xesyliad @RepAdamSchiff @Tocom11 Hmmm… Yet the @GOP was sure to do everything they could to make it harder for Poor, or Black &amp; Brown people to vote with #VoterID laws, didn’t they… Then they #Gerrymandered themselves a majority of safe districts… Almost seems as if they don’t care about what citizens want…
@HjelmRuss @RepAdamSchiff I’m optimistic that is a bridge too far, even for the corrupt @GOP. I hope even many of base would recognize this as antithetical to the core principles of the #UnitedStates. We, the People would rise up. Hopefully the civilian military would refuse orders to suppress protests.
@bjdmama @jessteppo @BeeNewsDaily @RepAdamSchiff They should read #Matthew25:32-46. #Jesus said he would Judge each human based on how they treat the least among us. The Hungry, Homeless, Sick, Disabled, Prisoners &amp; ForeignRefugees. He didn’t say he would condemn them for their beliefs, but according to their actions.
@IShallResist @RealTwitish @Kariseattle @MariaGr76169744 @krassenstein You can’t be Pardoned for crimes you haven’t committed yet. But #Ford did Pardon #Nixon for any crimes he might eventually be charged with in regards to #Watergate. But #Nixon had the foresight to #Resign, &amp; spare the country the indignity of watching him be forced from Office.

@bklynborn1971 @MilaEleven11 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @DNC And @realDonaldTrump needed #Russia’s help to even do that! That’s hardly what I call winning. More like helping a foreign adversary to rob a Majority of Americans of our Right to self determination.
@bklynborn1971 @MilaEleven11 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @DNC By the way, @realDonaldTrump lost the popular vote by close to 3Million votes. Just bc his voters occupy more land, doesn’t mean that they should have more value. The #Senate, w/2 Senators from each state, regardless of population, is where rural states should have more sway.
@bklynborn1971 @MilaEleven11 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @DNC @BarackObama did what he could without the support of @GOP members of #Congress, or causing an international crisis. @realDonaldTrump’s Campaign Conspired &amp; Coordinated w/Russian efforts to meddle in the election.

@missvic659 by the way, I was a representative for @SenSanders on the #RulesCommittee at the @DNC Convention in Philadelphia. I don’t oppose #SinglePayer. But due to my own #PreExistingConditions, I am very interested in finding a good Compromise that would work for Everyone!
@bklynborn1971 @MilaEleven11 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump @DNC What points to them? None of these people are still in office, nor did they have any role to play on the @realDonaldTrump Campaign.

@missvic659 @steelsnowflake1 @RepAdamSchiff …Despite the efforts of @realDonaldTrump’s admin, people in govt should NOT Profit from their positions within the bureaucracy. The essence of govt’s role domestically is to enforce laws to protect We, the People, &amp; to provide a neutral arbiter in conflicts between citizens.
@missvic659 @steelsnowflake1 @RepAdamSchiff …But I also respect the need for some oversight of those Providers to prevent fraudulent billing from raising costs. Profiteering has no place in Healthcare, since Patients can’t reasonably be expected to refuse service. I know 1st hand you don’t price shop for #BrainSurgeons!…
@missvic659 @steelsnowflake1 @RepAdamSchiff …While I would rather have a govt agency with no direct financial stake in the matter, &amp; that I can vote to replace, in charge of my healthcare, than I would a Private, ForProfit Insurer, ultimately I want my LicensedMedicalProviders making the final decisions on my healthcare…
@missvic659 @steelsnowflake1 @RepAdamSchiff …The other advantage of keeping Insurance Private is it keeps healthcare a safe distance from incompetent administrations, like the current one. It would also theoretically preserves more privacy for Patients from corrupt forces in a totalitarian govt, or the “#DeepState…”
@missvic659 @steelsnowflake1 @RepAdamSchiff Anything govt does is necessarily reversible. Even #SinglePayer. The advantage of the #GermanBismarckModel is that it’s a Compromise that preserves Private Choices for citizens.

@booksanescape @phirante @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC @GOP I don’t disagree, but he’s the best we could get in #WV! Look at who his constituents are. The fact he votes w/Dems at all is a miracle.
@booksanescape @phirante @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC @GOP True. Hopefully he will hold the line on that fight. I still say the answer is not to blame @JoeManchinWV, but elect more progressive senators in other, less conservative states.
@booksanescape @phirante @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC @GOP I agree, but remember @JoeManchinWV is a @DNC #Senator from the very conservative #WV. He represents the interests of #Unions, particularly in #CoalCountry. He must represent the will of his voters, even if we don’t agree. I’d still rather have him than his Republican opponents.

@booksanescape @phirante @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC @GOP I would love that, but I know where he’s coming from when he casts those votes. Considering his constituents, it would be exceedingly difficult for him to get away with what you’re asking him to do.
@MajLeighGay @TBates314 @kylegriffin1 @RepGoodlatte has been a reliable Red Rubber Stamp for the @GOP ever since I moved to the Roanoke area in 1992.

@TBates314 @phirante @booksanescape @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC Thanks! I live in #SWVirginia, &amp; my Dad’s side of the family is from #WV. I am familiar with the mindset of voters in #CoalCountry.
@phirante @booksanescape @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC Virtually impossible to get a more #Progressive candidate elected in #WV. That’s the heart of #CoalCountry. Better to try to flip seats in other states.
@phirante @booksanescape @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC @GOP …If @JoeManchinWV isn’t the deciding vote, it would be easier for him to vote w/the @DNC on nominees &amp; legislation. But it’s hard when opponents in #WV can run on him being the reason a @realDonaldTrump nominee fails in a strong Trump state. He has to listen to his constituents.
@phirante @booksanescape @krassenstein @JoeManchinWV @DNC Getting a Democrat elected in #WV of all states is virtually impossible. @JoeManchinWV occasionally gives us a crucial vote that prevents @GOP invincibility in the Senate. The answer isn’t to replace #BlueDogJoe. It’s to supplement him with more Democrats in the Senate…

@RickSchaler @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP #FIXtheACA by adopting Private, NONProfit aspects of the #GermanBismarckModel to further reduce the costs of coverage. Victims of medical malpractice obtain justice through our litigious system. But there should be a way to weed out superfluous claims earlier to save money.
@RickSchaler @mlanger @venivelovici @realDonaldTrump @GOP #ACA was a first step at improving Care by eliminating discrimination for #PreExistingConditions. It was a great 1st step. Instead of pointing fingers, we should all work together to make the law work for everyone.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump doesn’t understand that our @NATO Allies pay what they can afford. We can afford more, so we pay more. The entire point of the alliance was to have a bulwark against #Russia. So it’s no surprise @POTUS wants to undermine our relationships w/that organization now.

@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yes. We also have to be wary of the kind of overreach that inspires the fears of their extremist base. What we seek to use as a tool to help the disadvantaged, can be used as a bludgeon to prey on their fears by the powerful. There’s almost always a 3rd way around any problem.
@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov I am familiar w/#UniversalBasicIncome. Some day it may be necessary to fuel our consumer based economy. But that notion is a long way from finding support in the #US, where the notion that magic bootstraps can be used by anyone to esc crippling, generational poverty still exists.
@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov …NonEssential/Cosmetic medical services could remain #ForProfit. Let #BigPharma fund their own #BonerPill ads! But any medical Research&amp;Development into EssentialCare should be fully funded by govt. This would make Care affordable for anyone who needs it.
@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov …Additional savings could come from Public Investments into all pharmaceutical Research&amp;Development towards treating &amp; Curing serious healthcare problems of our time.

@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP @US_FDA @HHSGov …As I’ve said, similar systems are already used in #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan w/ lower costs and better healthcare results.

@missvic659 @venivelovici @mlanger @realDonaldTrump @GOP …@US_FDA or @HHSGov could monitor MedicalProviders to prevent fraudulent billing. But Insurers w/little medical knowledge, &amp; profit motives for denying services, wouldn’t decide if claims are valid or not…

@Slate @SenJohnMcCain @GOP @SpeakerRyan @MedicaidGov …No Networks. No PriorAuthorization. No Statelines. No denying legit claims to try to increase Profits. No 🐃💩! Since Federal Regulators don’t have a Profit motive for denying legitimate claims, @US_FDA or @HHSGov would monitor MedicalProviders to prevent fraudulent billing…
@Slate @SenJohnMcCain @GOP @SpeakerRyan @MedicaidGov …All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders would collectively bargain to set the rates for medical fees annually. Then since Insurers are NONPROFIT, they would be required to automatically pay any bills from licensed MedicalProviders, no questions asked…
@Slate @SenJohnMcCain @GOP @SpeakerRyan …Same basic system as #Germany, #France &amp; #Japan. Private to avoid concerns of Govt overreach &amp; promote competition. Nonprofit to reduce insurance overhead costs &amp; to improve Care. A #PublicOption to buy into @MedicaidGov could be included to act as a PaceCar for Private plans…
@Slate @SenJohnMcCain @GOP …@SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOP want us to return to the #SurvivalOfTheRichest healthcare system we had before. I want a compromise between that, and the #SinglePayerSystem some #Liberals call for.	I say we adapt the Private, NONPROFIT aspects of the #GermanBismarckModel to #FIXtheACA!…
@Slate As someone who will have saved $44.4K over 5yrs by the end of this year thanks to the #PatientProtections for #PreexistingConditions &amp; #CostSharingReductions (#CSR) in the #ACA, I am very grateful to @SenJohnMcCain for his courageous vote to derail the inane @GOP Repeal attempt…
@Jamesro26678602 @lindapblue @camsmom2002 @braidens12 @helloitsmeandie @Kissanurse75 @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen @GOP @BarackObama It wasn’t @BarackObama’s idea. The global community agreed to return #Iran’s international financial holdings in return for allowing weapons inspectors to monitor the dismantling of #Iran’s nuclear weapons program. A far better deal than what @realDonaldTrump got from #KimJongUn!
@robbienotrobin @Jrandallb @sooze555 @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan #RobertFrost was a brilliant man. He recognized the absurdity of claiming ownership over land better than most!
@lunabear1975 @Jrandallb @barbaraward235 @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan What we should really do is Campaign and VOTE on these issues in November. That would be far more effective than just wearing armbands. But I don’t object to using some sort of symbol to denote solidarity with these #RefugeeFamilies. Symbols can be powerful!
@Dekinblus @Jrandallb @resister62 @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan I don’t dispute that THEY, whomever THEY may be, often use different scriptures to justify hatred towards various people of all different stripes. What I’m just saying is that wasn’t what I was doing. All I want is to end discriminatory policies against #Palestinians in #Israel.
Article mentions the typical @GOP / @NRA “MentalHealth” excuse to avoid action. As someone who works for people w/disabilities, I agree we have a MentalHealth crisis. But…	The AR-15 Is Different: What I Learned Treating Parkland Victims - The Atlantic	https://t.co/7HPmapbsZl
@robbienotrobin @Jrandallb @sooze555 @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan …For those inside, Walls breed suspicion towards those left outside. For those left out, Walls heighten resentment for the people on the inside. Walls are powerful symbols that project the perception of superiority. They should not be erected flippantly between Allies.
@robbienotrobin @Jrandallb @sooze555 @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan …Anything that sets people apart from each other can be dangerously divisive. But nothing so clearly separates people as a #Wall. Walls inspire baseless fears of those on the other side by preventing people on either side from interacting to get to know each other…

@lunabear1975 @EricaC1970 @Jrandallb @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan Yes! We all should know by now that combining Church &amp; State leads to some of the greatest atrocities ever committed on our planet.	Faiths can do Good deeds. Govts can help people survive.	But giving Govt God’s authority is dangerous, bc it makes Govt’s authority unquestionable.
@EricaC1970 @Jrandallb @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan That is a Universal TRUTH!

@Jrandallb @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan …The culturally biased #Torah that grants the descendants of #Isaac complete inheritance of the #PromiseLand, is hardly sufficient historical evidence to justify the modern day legal oppression of #Ishmael’s descendants. Both were #SonsOfAbraham &amp; should share the land!
@Jrandallb @EricaC1970 @EliRadninyc @TalbertSwan I do not hate “Jews” at all! I deeply respect #Judaism &amp; the #Jewish people.

@Jar_O_Cats @TheRickyDavila @SpeakerRyan @PatrickBuchanan @GeorgeWill …In the modern world, the term #CompassionateConservative is practically an #oxymoron!
@Jar_O_Cats @TheRickyDavila @SpeakerRyan @PatrickBuchanan @GeorgeWill …My problem with #Libertarians in general is that their #SurvivalOfTheRichest attitude asks the Disabled, &amp; victims of historic socioeconomic oppression to take #PersonalResponsibility for their misfortunes. Then they praise those who profit by hurting the least among us…
@Jar_O_Cats @TheRickyDavila @SpeakerRyan @PatrickBuchanan is, and always has been a blithering idiot. I’m too young to remember #WilliamBuckley, but he has a reputation for being reasonable. As does @GeorgeWill, most of the time…
@medproretired @TheRickyDavila @earlibirdrobin @SpeakerRyan @GeorgeWill knows history, &amp; has the foresight to see what the negative costs of #Isolationism to our economy, &amp; global standing could mean for the #US. The #US only became a True World Leader during #WWII. A role cemented when we enacted the #MarshallPlan to rebuild #Germany.
@Whichsideareuon @TheRickyDavila @SpeakerRyan …And Americans don’t vote 3rdParty. For a realistic alternative to #IlDoucheCheetolini &amp; the @GOP #Gestapo, vote @DNC for a #BlueWave to wash away the hateful elements of our govt in #2018!
@Whichsideareuon @TheRickyDavila @SpeakerRyan #Libertarians are just atheist #Republicans who smoke pot, and don’t care about abortions, or gay marriage… Jk!	But #Libertarians often do buy into the whole false conservative mantra that says poor people should pull themselves up by their nonexistent bootstraps…
@LanceTane @TheRickyDavila @Gardening_Angel @SpeakerRyan If #Mueller brings @POTUS @realDonaldTrump down, @VP #Pence will fall with him. #Pence was in charge of the transition that put @GenFlynn (who at that time was an “undisclosed” #ForeignAgent w/close ties to #Putin &amp; his other #Puppets), as Our top #NationalSecurityAdvisor.
@GeorgeWill is NOT some Leftist, #BleedingHeart, softy! When the @GOP loses the loyalty of @GeorgeWill, you know that the country’s “conservative party” has truly lost its collective mind &amp; conscience. Hope we find our #MoralCompass in November2018!	#BlueWave2018🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 https://t.co/rOCCPmUs7F

@bobbi2124 @ASlavitt @TheSamfund …A neutral 3rd Party with medical expertise should make decisions about healthcare expenses. Not the accountants of For Profit Insurance Companies with a financial motivation for denying legitimate claims!
@bobbi2124 @ASlavitt @TheSamfund Thanks! Tell your representatives to look into adopting &amp; adapting the #GermanBismarckModel of Private, Nonprofit Healthcare to #FIXtheACA. We could improve upon the same basic system used by Germany, France &amp; Japan to work for both our Patients &amp; Medical Providers!
@ASlavitt @bobbi2124 @TheSamfund …Then Insurers would be required pay All bills from licensed MedicalProviders automatically! No Networks. No #PriorAuthorizations. No 🐃💩! This would result in lower costs by reducing insurance overhead expenses, &amp; better healthcare results for Patients…
@ASlavitt @bobbi2124 @TheSamfund …But more needs to be done! We should adapt Private, NONProfit aspects of the #GermanBismarckModel to #FIXtheACA. All Insurers &amp; All MedicalProviders would collectively bargain w/each other to set the rates for All medical services annually…
@ASlavitt @bobbi2124 @TheSamfund In 2013, I spent 55% of my income as a #SupportProvider for people w/disabilities on my healthcare due to my #PreexistingConditions. But by the end of this year, I’ll have saved $44.4K over 5yrs thanks to the #ACA!
