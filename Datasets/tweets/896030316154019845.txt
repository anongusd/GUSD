@KatMcKinley @dyudkin @OutOfMiddleClas @benshapiro Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th ave, kind of a crazy thing. Mental health and gun rights are separated by other privacy rights in The medical field. We have no mechanism to revoke the gun rights of crazy people.
@KatMcKinley @dyudkin @OutOfMiddleClas @benshapiro Furthermore, by what existing law could the FBI remove this mans 2A. He said I want to be a professional shooter, he didn‚Äôt make a specific threat. What statue gives the govt the power to seize his guns? He could‚Äôve just said he was joking and blown it off? He said a crazy thing
@KatMcKinley @dyudkin @OutOfMiddleClas @benshapiro Um, an assault rifle was used in that case also, which was banned from 1994 to 2004. Those laws? The point people are making is that we don‚Äôt have the laws to result in the nuts from losing their gun rights

@Johnny10er @dianelyssa I think Diane just really dislikes Sanders, that is the root of this tweet. Guarantee I can find Hillary (her fave) saying "blacks" as well
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa Only with a ending, no ER. And only with close friends
@dianelyssa https://t.co/D1ethOMAiH
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa Search twitter for #blacks
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa Don't have to search hard to find black people using the term blacks.
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa https://t.co/D1ethOMAiH
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa How do black people refer to themselves then? Do they like African American? Black people? Is there a consensus?
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa And how is it different from latinos, that phrase is much more widely used than Latino people
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa And even your point is questionable, most certainly could find with some searching a black person saying "blacks"
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa Well what if a Latino or Asian or Arab or any other race/nationality/ethicity did?
@Johnny10er @dianelyssa Labels are overly used, divisive and not always necessary, for instance does it only bother Diane when white people say blacks?

@tru_rises Like cernovich living off alimony?

@tru_rises I don't think you understand the word social then, your just an angry dude
@tru_rises Where did I defend mass media, now your just making shit up
@tru_rises You can't really make an argument that trump is a conservative
@tru_rises Doesn't that just make you some kind of analogous conservative justice warrior, last I checked y'all are losing
@tru_rises Haven't
@tru_rises Your right about you being an asshole, but having come close to explaining how I'm a hypocrite
@tru_rises So you don't believe in liberty and justice for all then, social justice isn't real?
@tru_rises That old school conservative thought tried to create laws that actually affected the lives of other diverse people. that why they were label
@tru_rises You just don't understand the dynamic, it's a clash between rural and urban realities, rural folks live in a bubble, i know, I live there
@tru_rises Trumpers seem the relish the immoral in the party that was once supposedly conservative...aka moral
@tru_rises Like cernovich then? Pushing the pizza gate and Weinstein BS while bragging about pulling his dick out to women?

@buenopischa @Cernovich You're just not paying close enough attention and jumping the gun
@PAC_CASCADE_NW @AstonB4Illegals @Cernovich Still waiting for that disavow.....
@PAC_CASCADE_NW @AstonB4Illegals @Cernovich On tape, and his ex-wife on the record saying he raped her, yes it's possible to rape your wife.
@PAC_CASCADE_NW @AstonB4Illegals @Cernovich So women aren't credible even though he's bragged about it?
@PAC_CASCADE_NW @AstonB4Illegals @Cernovich Holding your breath is a bad idea, you could die if you do it too long
@PAC_CASCADE_NW @AstonB4Illegals @Cernovich I forgot we wait for convictions before asking for the disavow...my bad

@Wunder_Blunder @Cernovich Sorry I'm not a professional tweeter
@AstonB4Illegals @PAC_CASCADE_NW @Cernovich I just looking for the Trump disavow for sexual assault. That's all
@Cernovich When you gonna disavow Trump for sexual assault?
@Cernovich They let you do it when you're a star. -Trump
@Cernovich Says they let you do it when you're a star.
@Cernovich I even heard that Trump guy is into sexual assault, isn't that crazy!
@Cernovich Just cause there's a lot of people here doesn't mean everyone likes you. A lot of people are here specifically because they don't
@skittlegraphs @Cernovich Like this comment to the top of the thread peoples. The selective outrage is ludicrous.
@organic_enigma @Cernovich Selective outrage. Trump grabs pussy, Cernobitch fondles his balls.
RT @JuddLegum: 1. When Trump became president, people stopped talking much about the numerous women who alleged he sexually assaulted them.
@JuddLegum @Cernovich doesn't believe this nonsense, only liberals are sickos.

@ChYaxx @Cernovich It's only real when it happens to you right?
@ChYaxx @Cernovich Kinda ridiculous like protecting yourself from a tyrannical govt armed with drones/missiles/tanks with your AR15
@ChYaxx @Cernovich Because the same people say it's not okay to take a knee in silent protest to police brutality.
The most ardent supporters of military and police also stockpile weapons in case they need to fight them one day. #irony
@Cernovich Support the military and police, unless we deem them tyrannical, then we'll shoot. Funny logic.
@Cernovich Respect the police, until they become tyrannical.

@RVS3USA The 2 party system is not good, it's more like bi-polar communism than democracy, way too extreme on both sides now, the center is dead
@RVS3USA Only one on fox like that is shepherd smith, very few true journalists nowadays, in terms of anchors, reporters are neutral, but not anchors
@RVS3USA It's almost like they are center, they don't like either party, common sentiment nowadays
@RVS3USA They cover a lot of the same stories as domestic outlets, people have come not to like fox or CNN for various reasons, unsaturated market
@RVS3USA To serve their interests, push back on American propaganda, and to also make money
@RVS3USA And political reasons to motivate the electorate for elections
@RVS3USA So you would agree that domestic outlets participate in political propaganda?
@RVS3USA Most of Fox News is conservative propoganda, triggering emotional responses by non objective reporting
@RVS3USA So its the govt perspective of said country, still value in seeing perspective, people are personally responsible for what they do w/ info
@RVS3USA Fox News is worse than RT for twisting the minds of old white conservatives
@RVS3USA I prefer bolstering public education
@RVS3USA Or any other outlet for that matter? Looks like a slippery slope to me
@RVS3USA Do we have a free press if you ban RT America or Xinhua?
@RVS3USA We have tons of domestic propaganda outlets spreading BS. What about infowars?
@RVS3USA So China is bad too, ban Xinhua? I like to follow a lot of outlets to get different perspectives.
@RVS3USA The Guardian in the U.K., every country has news orgs, all are on social media.

@reigngin @JDRucker @benshapiro @UCBerkeley @DavidAFrench @KatiePavlich If the university were footing a $15,000 bill for security then the public would be paying for it. It's a public institution.
@JDRucker @benshapiro @UCBerkeley @DavidAFrench @KatiePavlich The public shouldn't have to fund security for anyone who wants to speak at public venues. If your controversial, pay your own security
