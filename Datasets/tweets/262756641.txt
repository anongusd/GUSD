The lawyers also said Judge Kavanaugh would need to testify first, before Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh would be forced yo answer about a Washington Post article detailing allegations, not the words of his accuser. An obvious nonstarter.
We are absolutely sympathetic to limitations with regard to travel, which is why Chairman Grassley has repeatedly offered to send staff directly to Dr. Ford in California, so that travel would not be necessary.

Anyone says they‚Äôre trying to help songwriters by opposing the bill is talking out of both sides of their mouth. Songwriters across the country WANT this bill because it will fix the broken system that prevents them from getting paid what they‚Äôre due.		https://t.co/KxOdPc4JaL

Those companies fighting the bill are the ones who benefit from a broken system in which songwriters don‚Äôt get paid a fair market rate and too often don‚Äôt get paid when their songs get played.
The whole reason we need a bill to fix music licensing in the first place is because everyone on both sides of the distribution chain‚Äîsongwriters, publishers, labels, and digital music companies‚Äîagrees the current system isn‚Äôt working.		More here --&gt; https://t.co/YvhfKtbc5q
Senator Hatch has been fighting for years to pass legislation to help songwriters get paid a fair market rate when their songs are played. That‚Äôs what this legislation is about‚Äîhelping songwriters.
The bill does not ‚Äúnationalize‚Äù the music industry. It creates an organization to collect and distribute songwriter royalties that will be run by songwriters and publishers. 		Again, for effect: run by songwriters and publishers.
The article conveniently fails to mention all the CONSERVATIVE support for the bill, including: 		‚òëÔ∏è @taxreformer	‚òëÔ∏è @ACUConservative	‚òëÔ∏è @ALEC_states	‚òëÔ∏è @GovWaste 	‚òëÔ∏è @FreedomWorks
While it makes a heavy-handed attempt to play on the President‚Äôs feelings about Amazon, this is not an Amazon bill. 		The bill has support from across the ENTIRE music industry. Songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, digital music companies, and broadcasters..

@anne184 @charlescwcooke Some foreign policy experts may disagree with withdrawing from the Iran deal. Few would attempt the argument that it was a treaty. 		Binding agreements go through the Senate for a reason. Similarly, as the article noted, non-binding agreements go around the Senate for a reason.
@Uncharasmat1c @charlescwcooke One of many arguments is the deal is invalid precisely because it does not have the impact/support/structure of a treaty. 		You‚Äôll find this and so much more in the article you‚Äôre responding to.
‚ÄúNon-treaties lack the imprimatur and broad-based acceptance that treaties, by design, tend to enjoy. If the president wanted his arrangement to be more permanent, he should have gone to the Senate.‚Äù -@charlescwcooke

@ThrocmortonP @KyleKashuv I‚Äôd encourage you to learn more about the SAFE UT app. 86 violence attacks have been stopped in Utah since the app was unveiled. STOP will help schools find tools like that to support, implement, and stop School Violence.
