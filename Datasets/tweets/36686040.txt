I won't let them off the hook! https://t.co/K11Esx0gHG
CBS, the efforts on your website about your support for diversity fly in the face of your display of all of the reporters you've selected for the 2020 campaign. Not one Black. What's up with this? An explanation is needed.
Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise &amp; now you want to declare an emergency. The only emergency facing our country is the need to impeach you before you destroy our country, our ideals, &amp; leadership in the world. Trump, go home. Bye bye!
Back in 2017, I dubbed Trump &amp; his allies w/ all their ties to Russia and Ukraine, the "Kremlin Klan".  I believed Trump colluded with Russians &amp; has been obstructing justice before our eyes.  What more do we need to see? https://t.co/mCGNh0bheh via @YouTube
No surprise the FBI questioned Trump's allegiance to US! He meets w/ Putin 5 times in secret w/ no readout; gave Russians classified info in WH; disregarded US intel on Russia; praised Putin's election; lies abt his deals in Russia. Is there any question Trump is a Russian agent?
Trump has perfected the art of lying. No, #ConManDon, the FBI investigation hanging over your head is no witch hunt. You are engulfed in a web of lies &amp; deceit. Webs are created by poisonous &amp; dangerous spiders. You fit the profile.
Please. No one should wonder why Manafort gave polling data to Russians. The only reason Russians wanted this info was to use it against H. Clinton in support of Trump. Why do you think Manafort w/ all his ties to Russia &amp; Ukraine was in the campaign to begin with? Stay woke!
Americans should be shaken by what we know of Trump &amp; Putin's relationship &amp; should NOT be surprised by the FBI counterintelligence investigation. Is Trump a Russian agent? If it walks like a duck &amp; talks like a duck, then it is a duck - and the duck should be impeached.
Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, &amp; the children need shoes. No American who works for our govt should be treated this way while you are living off the govt.

Lying Trump is using "America First" as his defense in helping Saudi Arabia cover up the horrific murder of a Washington Post journalist. The Saudis tortured, strangled &amp; dismembered #JamalKhashoggi. Trump's complete disregard for human life is immoral, weak, and disgusting.
Why does Trump have such an affinity for murderous autocrats? 	He defends Vladimir Putin of Russia, fell in love w/ Kim Jong Un of N Korea, admires Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines &amp; now refuses to accept CIA findings that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered #JamalKhashoggi's murder
What more does Trump have to brazenly tell us about his relationship to the Saudis? It's all about $. Trump sold a yacht to a Saudi royal, sold the 45th floor of Trump Tower to Saudis &amp; said he liked the Saudis "very much" b/c they buy $40M apartments from him #FollowtheMoney

Hurray for the courageous women who confronted Sen. Flake! They are without a doubt the reason Sen. Flake joined Democrats to call for the one-week FBI investigation. Peaceful protest works!
Trump cannot vouch for anybody's honesty, integrity, or respect for women. Trump only chose Kavanaugh based on his declaration that a President cannot be indicted. So glad the Constitution defines impeachment.
Kavanaugh has proven that he is a puppet of Donald Trump. He got his marching orders and he promptly displayed Trump's lack of respect for others. Aren't Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?

I will always remember the critical moment when John McCain strode into the U.S. Senate and, with all eyes focused on him and one vote needed, displayed a thumbs down and saved Obamacare, which benefits millions in our country.
A true American patriot &amp; hero has passed. 	John McCain was an example of a public policy maker who fought for what he believed in, and had the character &amp; dignity to stand up for what was right -- even if he had to oppose some of his colleagues to do so.
Manafort &amp; Cohen both lied about their finances &amp; cheated the IRS. Can you imagine what #DonTheCon must be hiding in his tax returns when it is well known that the ONLY bank that would lend him money, Deutsche, is notorious for money laundering?
The avg. American struggles to pay his/her taxes but Trump's allies can get by for years cheating the IRS, defrauding banks, &amp; laundering millions of $$. Trump is probably hiding his tax returns b/c he's as big a crook &amp; fraud as the top people he chose to run his campaign &amp; WH.
The high crimes are giving aid and classified information to our enemies (Russia), abusing the pardon, breaking campaign finance laws, working w/ Russians to get "dirt" on political opponents, and coming soon from Special Counsel Mueller, obstruction of justice.
Cohen admitted Trump instructed him to break the law. If it's a crime for Cohen, it's a crime for Trump.  Debates about whether you can indict a president do not excuse Congress from its responsibility to impeach Trump for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes &amp; misdemeanors."
Cohen said he would take a bullet for Trump. I guess he never said anything about jail time!

Trump, you can't have Cohen broker an NDA &amp; payoff to Stormy to keep her from talking about your affair &amp; then deny you knew anything about it. Your lies are catching up w/ you &amp; the con won't work. This may be your "come to Jesus" moment before impeachment.
Everyone knows Cohen has been Trump's go-to lawyer &amp; fixer, protecting him in lawsuits &amp; representing him in all sorts of shady dealings. I believe his office is a treasure trove of information. Don't forget Cohen's involvement w/ Flynn &amp; Sater in trying to lift Russian sanctions
No matter what 45 says, #Rosenstein, the acting US attorney in Manhattan, and a federal judge would not have agreed to this raid on Cohen unless there was sound reason to do so. Trump can complain all he wants. The road leads to #Impeachment!

John Kelly needs to resign.
If you're wondering why Kelly couldn't keep his lies straight -first trying to defend wife beater Porter, then claiming he voluntarily resigned,then claiming he fired him - this is the same person who lied on Rep.Wilson. Even after video proved him a liar, he refused to apologize
John Kelly is also complicit in knowing that Porter had a history of wife beating. This would've been revealed in the investigative reports that were so clearly identified by FBI Director Wray when he testified before the United States Senate.
John Kelly is presiding over a White House that is in chaos and dysfunction. He is complicit in both Rob Porter and Jared Kushner working at the highest levels of government without security clearance.
What? Oprah insecure? I don't think so. As a matter of fact, Oprah is richer than you are. Deal with that. Not true? Show your tax returns!
Watch my video below on the questions I asked Treasury Sec. Mnuchin about why he &amp; Trump are not implementing the sanctions against Russia that Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. https://t.co/Ex7Fto1OaJ
Does anyone need to ask why Russians supported Trump &amp; worked to defeat Hillary? Isn't it obvious? I've said over &amp; over again that I believe this president has a commitment to Putin to lift the #Obama sanctions &amp; to not impose new sanctions Congress passed w/ bipartisan support.
So where are all the patriotic Republicans? Do they stand with this lying president or do they have the love of country they claim? Will they insist on the #impeachment of Trump as the facts are revealed about his campaign's collusion with Russia?
To my colleagues who signed my letter to protect Mueller from being undermined and fired, let's continue to insist on protecting both #Mueller and #Rosenstein!
Mueller is on his way to revealing the #kremlinklan I've always talked about.
Congratulations to Mueller on the 13 indictments! You're doing a great job! Don't stop. I've always believed you could connect the dots!

Cold blooded Trump &amp; Mulvaney are committed to killing the #CFPB - an agency that has proven to protect consumers from rip offs, fraud &amp; corporate tricks. Why would any decent elected or appointed leader fight against protecting hardworking Americans against this kind of abuse?
The facts relative to Tillerson's mismanagement of the State Dept reveals his disinterest in foreign affairs. He was only there to help lift the oil sanctions on Russia so Putin could drill in the Artic and so his former company Exxon could earn more profit
Roy Moore is a liar, a pedophile, a sex predator, and apparently Trump's kind of Senator. He claims not to know any of the women that he violated when they were girls, but no credible person would believe that many women would come forward because they have nothing better to do.
Mr. President, there is help for your deteriorating mental health. It's called admitting guilt and telling the truth.

Gen. Kelly, you earned 4 stars &amp; had a successful career. Now you've fallen prey to a "moron" in an effort to protect his career. Apologize.
If the wife and family of Sgt. Johnson feel they were disrespected by Trump, then they were disrespected. Period!
Gen. Kelly has been tainted by Trump lying in the face of facts. Hasn't he seen the same video of Rep. Wilson that everyone else has seen?
General Kelly has lied. Rep. Wilson has conducted herself w/ dignity. The only empty barrel I see is the one in the Oval Office.
Even the most honorable people are not immune to being overtaken by the filth wreaking from the Trump White House day after day.
What is it about the Trump White House that transforms everyone into liars?
Trump has no business calling anyone "wacky" when his own Sec. of State is ashamed of him and thinks he's a moron.

Instead of questioning Yates' credibility, Cornyn &amp; Cruz should reflect on their support for lying Trump &amp; an AG who lied before the Senate
Sens. Cornyn &amp; Cruz's attempts to berate #SallyYates over unlawful travel bans were pathetic. They are no match for an accomplished woman!

Since Trump misses his old life so much, it's time for Congress to send him back to Mar-a-Lago, full time.

Despite significant progress, there's still work ahead. Read @FSCDems fact sheet on housing in New Orleans #Katrina10 http://t.co/GIBluuWsKb
New Orleans has made tremendous progress in the last few years, becoming the first city to effectively end veteran homelessness #Katrina10
While the # of public housing units are down, @HUDgov-assisted housing has increased due to more Housing Choice Vouchers #Katrina10
.@FSCDems also secured authorization of 3,000 new vouchers to house the homeless, including those displaced in New Orleans #Katrina10
.@FSCDems fought to stop public housing demolition in New Orleans and guarantee right of return for displaced residents #Katrina10
The @FSCDems &amp; @FinancialCmte held 16 hearings to address the Gulf Coast recovery, including 6 in New Orleans and Gulfport, MS #Katrina10
Housing in NOLA has gotten more unaffordable since Katrina. Between 2000 and 2009, the median gross rent increased by 89 percent #Katrina10
Poor &amp; working-class areas had the most housing damage from flooding because they were in lower elevations &amp; had older homes #Katrina10
RT @jameshperry: Few elected officials came through for those who suffered in Katrina. @MaxineWaters was/is a hero for the people of #NOLA
Patterns of housing discrimination resulted in Af. Americans disproportionately living in most flood prone areas of New Orleans #Katrina10
According to @NatUrbanLeague, a history of inequality helps explain why black &amp; low-income residents were hit hardest by #Katrina10
More than 1 million people in the Gulf Coast region were displaced as a result of the hurricane #Katrina10
Hurricane Katrina was the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. More than 1,800 lives lost &amp; over 1,500 in Louisiana alone #Katrina10
