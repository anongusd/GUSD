(2 of 2) Though "A Normal Life"(Spade, 2015) focuses on #Transgender issues he explains why our political activism approach of 'rights' &amp; related legislation has not worked overall, diminished these rights &amp; for our most vulnerable populations, virtually, impossible to receive.

@IndependentLens  I must add how significant segment of couple selling racist memorabilia was, to know that happens, however, uncomfortable to watch. Esp after she sounded so sad &amp; then chose that club to go dancing &amp; hung out w/all white American Legion Post. I was angry as hell
@IndependentLens I found "Black Memorabilia" segment of white couple selling racist items hard to watch. They are exploiting African Americans again! Please suggest they donate sales to @NAACP or @SPLC or help them find another way to make $ that doesn't support racism.
@ambermruffin Official: Fan of WHAT?! &amp; your other writings @LateNightSeth (just never know which lines are yours!). If u or an assist have time watch @IndependentLens "Black Memorabilia" segment where white couple sells racist items at flea markets they call antique shows.WHAT?!

When the patriarchal privileged are raped, they are taught to hide it or are seen as weak &amp; not worthy of their so-called power by their patriarchal peers. That whole system is based on exactly what we hear today: truths promoted as lies defined as "#MAGA".
Many people wouldn't consider inhibiting or taking another's life if they were not supporting or covering up their own or another's wrong. Others commit crimes because they're made to feel powerless, inadequate or incompetent &amp; cannot come up w/a legal way to get their #needs met
Every #man I heard call a #person he sexually took advantage of, raped or sexually assaulted a "Whore", "easy", or loose was actually talking about themselves.
Prior to the late 70s &amp; as the patriarchal privileged is getting away w/today victims/survivors were/are blamed instead of perpetrators (i.e., whores, way dressed, available, 'asked for it'). Taking advantage of someone sexually gives them power in their acutely insecure minds.
Similar to frat assaults &amp; deaths. You have at least 1 parent protecting a child fr screwing up their life in jail &amp; 1 wanting justice for victim.#Parents/#courts need to understand letting a child get away w/sexual assault/rape grows into a distressed adult &amp; a #corrupt #culture
The reason some of us did not report was we were early aged teens and did not know how to, expected the adults in our lives to do something about it. Sometimes those adults, especially when the perps were also young, had community pressure/conflict over the perps were 'just kids'

(2 of 2):Similarly, the #love &amp; #support of family &amp; friends at times of grief &amp; great loss increase a person's ability to love again,many times deeper than they did before, not the actual heart-break over death or #loss. Many times it's merely the contrast of opposite #feelings.
1 of 2: Since #Psychotherapy in #USA can be readily attained by #peopleofprivilege, those same people cannot understand that it's actually the 'loving therapeutic relationship' that healed their heart-break &amp; deepened their ability to love not the heart-break.

Research who you vote for, do not believe hearsay of friends or family. #Vote for people who actually work for &amp; fight by the way they vote in office on issues that affect YOUR lives and that of your families.That is one blessing we have by way of the Web.@LeagueWomenVote is one.
2 of 2:  Think about alimonies and pre-marital divorce agreements of the 'Rich &amp; Famous'.  Even when their beginnings were not wealthy. Now, you are beginning to get it.  Do not let their #political #rhetoric fool you anymore.
1 of 2: #USA people need to understand,when #Politicians merely bring their families &amp; others as close to wealth as themselves into office it is because they cannot relate to lifestyles that are not.Too painful, distracting &amp; disorienting for them to maintain their own lifestyle.
#Problem w/electing people w/too.much.money: They cannot #trust anyone. They have endured too much pain &amp; suffering from evil competitor games in order to make that much $. Many inflict it back onto the vulnerable while focusing on making $$$$$$$$ to #protect themselves from all
