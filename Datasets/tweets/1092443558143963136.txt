@eliec76 @ArgyBargy00 @kapstrom @That1WelderGuy @nancyxsweet @AOC Do you really think we can afford for people to go to the doctor for anything anytime?  Not even those darling democratic socialism countries allow that
@joshrogin @GlennKesslerWP Well I guess we should have just sent a pallet of cash and been done with it
@ArgyBargy00 @kapstrom @eliec76 @That1WelderGuy @nancyxsweet @AOC The point is the US only wants the tippy top to pay. 50% of Americans pay no income tax federally.... Denmark taxes at 35% any income over 1.5 time poverty. Americans are not willing to pay the tax rate.

@AOC What it boils down to is it‚Äôs over. There is no collusion and you don‚Äôt get to just get years of tax returns to dig thru. If @realDonaldTrump needs to provide his returns all of congress should also. We all should get to see the last 5 years and let‚Äôs see who really cheats

@darthbills @JoeySalads @AOC Most European countries have tax rates across all income over 1.5 times the poverty rate. In Denmark everyone pays 35%. For socialism to work everyone has to pay not just the rich, there are only 9 billionaires in Denmark, you think those 9 pay for 5.7 million.
@frendazoned @darthbills @JoeySalads @AOC Neither do sports stars but no one seems to be going after #ColinKaepernick 92 million????
@darthbills @JoeySalads @AOC My question is, so when the ‚Äútippy top‚Äù rich people leave because no one want to give up their money. When they leave and it‚Äôs up to the mere millionaires to be tax at 70% over a million, will you be happy to do your civic duty?

@kpfallon Oh you should just go and delete this and then apologize you hateful POS
@brianros1 So if there is conservative media, what are you guys and why would conservatives watch your side since you don‚Äôt represent them?
@Jessiemackay @muchasdinero @joeyc149 @keckmeister @marcusm59504192 @SarahKSilverman @AOC So because it‚Äôs free we should just accept shitty service?
@maxtaves @RoKhanna @tedlieu CA has more billionaires than any other state, just tax them since that works
@PedroMatty @blue_gojira @RaidenRockman @vegasdude83 @wdunlap @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AOC The public is not supposed to know everything that is in a bill, that‚Äôs why we elect officials to vote for us.
@AbdulElSayed How dare those parents want to make it so their children and grandchildren‚Äôs life is better than their parents... how dare those rich people
@EthanBearman @PatriotGames09 @BobbyChaconFBI But the left constantly complains about long sentences for non-violent offenders and here you have a tax cheat and liar and will get more time than most murders... that‚Äôs his point
@RoKhanna I think we should be able to see ever public office taxes if we are worried.. you should go ahead and post yours now so we can see it
@SpauldingMerri2 @dhiggins63 @smitty_one_each @JewishOdysseus @JussieSmollett At yes the Uncle Tom argument
@ATHOMEActivism @WSJ All the actors did that at the time, worked till they hit the top tax rate. You really think the pampered actors that exist today are going to still make movies losing 70%?
@MindOfMo @WSJ It‚Äôs not news because it was a hand gun and the shooter was black. Had it been a AR-15 and a white guy... all over the news
@blue_gojira @PedroMatty @RaidenRockman @vegasdude83 @wdunlap @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The @POTUS has no obligation to sign any bill that comes across his desk. Clinton veto 37 and Bush W 44.  No POTUS is required to and bi partisan is BS. If it‚Äôs such a good deal why did @AOC vote against it
@reckless_mind Sounds like to me you need to move. I am over 40 and have moved many times in my life and have never been near a mass shooting.
@colleensperk Well, if he didn‚Äôt you would be botching too...

@SportsTalkBarry @tcherpeski @dpowley @teddygraffeo49 @AOC It takes 1 marijuana??! You must not be from America
@academyofvenus @SpeakerPelosi So saying the wall is immoral and then providing funding for it is pluralism? Oh do please educate me
@academyofvenus @Juanleche212 @AOC What would some of those implications be?
@academyofvenus @Juanleche212 @AOC So people from her district were banned from taking the jobs? It was in the same city

@ArtieKGB @akarl_smith @AOC Well guess what, for the government to create money; they have to tax people.
@NathanIHarris @Jeremy_McGowan @akarl_smith @AOC Well now the poor isn‚Äôt getting shit... see Capitalism does help the poor and middle class. Now all of those tax and purchase dollars are gone... this is how socialism kills economies... a 100 small business might have sprouted up because of all those people.
@akarl_smith @AOC That‚Äôs sarcasm right?
@Popehat Shit I didn‚Äôt know @MichaelAvenatti was still a thing
@Julio_Rosas11 @DanCrenshawTX So walls are making people cross where walls are not? https://t.co/zz5eIek7XQ

@seanmdav There are 27 current national emergencies going on right now.. but no one knows that fact... because the world is not ending
@charliekirk11 That‚Äôs dumb and I am a conservative. Illegals are not going anywhere soon, why hamstring communities and schools with under counted population? No wonder there is overcrowded schools and highways... now we need a wall to prevent more but count what we have
@MedvedSHOW My house is more secure when I lock one of the four doors, I should be totally safe that way

@noobfatherof1 @Fritz588_ @AOC Gosh, they just would have moved people to NYC who rented and bought places to live, purchased things in the neighborhood like groceries and dry goods...
@benshapiro We did declare a national emergency to help protect Lebanon, why can‚Äôt we do it here?
@kimballnbitsII @BigCummyBoner @eqloprtntyhtr @AP The point is, it‚Äôs possible and look st Bill Gates, Oprah, Jobs, and everyone else that made millions who had nothing to start with. That‚Äôs the American dream, start taxing the rich and the dream is gone. People don‚Äôt come here 4 healthcare and a living wage; they come here $$

@RoKhanna Question for you. How does the government plan to get back all of the #assault #Weapons that have already been sold in the US? I would Ike an honest answer when gun buy backs down work
@RoKhanna Hmmm all of these have existed or do already exist but mass shooting did not go down. How do you explain that??? If #walls don‚Äôt work, how do band work?
@carcharias @MuslimIQ For housing to be affordable, the largest cost (land) would have to be affordable. Does this mean the government takes land from citizens and gives it away to builders to build affordable housing? Does the #Socialism ever end?
@fawfulfan So after the homes are built who is going to pay for the property taxes, utilities, food, basic necessities and any repair on the homes? Cause Bezos will run out of money üí∞
@MuslimIQ @Lemon_Wizard Ca has more billionaires than anywhere. 	CA has the largest homeless population 	Taking the rich is not gonna happen or it would have by now
@BigCummyBoner @eqloprtntyhtr @AP And all the team manager, middle manager, and professional jobs go away as well. Not everyone makes minimum wage...

Democrats: @POTUS and Russia perpetrated the great election üó≥ rigging in the history of the US and even though there is no proof, we know it happened.
@dmfmcdonald @TheRightMelissa @WalshFreedom Yes because Russia and @POTUS figured out how to rig the #ElectoralCollege but somehow have #HillaryClinton won the popular vote... ok... sure

@RealSaavedra I love how people talk about doing away with ‚Äúassault‚Äù style weapons but no one talks about the dirty detail in taking back the some est 10 million AR15 that are already in circulation?
@NolteNC I support this platform
@AOC The fact that you all think #billionaires are just gonna stay in the country and let you tax them at 70% is crazy... do you really think #OprahWinfrey #BillGates and the like are just going to stay here when they can go anywhere and live? Crazy talk
@MDougy7 @MarketLibGuy @IsabeauMann @robbysoave He lied and said he didn‚Äôt have an ID, he was putting stuff in a back pack, and shoving crap in between the seat. Again don‚Äôt be all shifty... jeez it‚Äôs not hard. Again the cops were wrong but if this guy would have been a little more respectful, might have went different
@ShaneGoldmacher @daveweigel @andrewcuomo Dang, you‚Äôre residents are frigging fleeing your city and state over the taxes... why. Any you see the simple stuff you‚Äôre doing to your city
@ShellenbergerMD And we still have the same global warming problem... it‚Äôs still the same issues even after all that money spent...
@MDougy7 @MarketLibGuy @IsabeauMann @robbysoave Oh, I was horrified by the video but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact of the guy had not been a dick to start. Maybe the outcome would have been different. I have been pulled over a few times and I am always super respectful, because it doesn‚Äôt really matter at the end of the day

@jonahloeb @ILikeBonhoeffer @VanityFair @AOC There are only 574 Billionaires, if you were going the pitch fork route, you would have done it by now... news flash, the rich are not getting taxed. Why do you think CA has all that money üí∞ and all those homeless?? They are not getting taxed
@ILikeBonhoeffer @VanityFair @AOC We all want clean everything, here is the secret: We are not for the government forcing us upon us... same with, we all want citizens to have healthcare but 160 million of us are not willing to give up our employer plans because those were a benefit of our jobs.
@VanityFair @AOC No they didn‚Äôt

Hey @SpeakerPelosi and #Dems if you your willing to give 1B for a wall that is immoral, why not give it all. Either the wall is immoral or it‚Äôs not. If it is why give more than the $1 you said you would not give? Cause it was all a scam..you just wanted to obstruct #BuildTheWall
@charliekirk11 And the most billionaires... if taxing the rich worked, CA would be a shining example but
@askhamaboutit @scottlincicome That‚Äôs great till you find out Sweden taxes all income over 1.5x the average and they only have 27 billionaires. The billionaires are not paying all of it, everyone does. I am fine with everyone paying

@MidSentryModern @Kb39366604 @PineBucket @journalsentinel So no one that ever does anything wrong cannot better themselves and work for the very people they wronged so long ago? How are you supposed to learn from mistakes if you‚Äôre never given the opportunity to prove you‚Äôre better?

#Dems are now offering @POTUS less than 2billion for the #wall @SpeakerPelosi said not $1 would go to the wall because it‚Äôs immoral. If it‚Äôs immoral then why give any money at all? Stupid games, if you‚Äôre willing to give some money then just give it all and move on

@visgrrl @WallaMatt01 @Doug_Zbi @ChadPergram But when everyone is forced to ride the train, now it becomes like an airport. Only way to make it enjoyable is to reduce rider amount, maybe we all will have to justify why we are going somewhere and if it is not approved; we don‚Äôt go
@uckema @WallaMatt01 @Doug_Zbi Damn that is gonna cost a shit ton of üí∞ Elon is gonna get paid for his boring technology
@fins71 @MSUMatt1990 @Doug_Zbi @WallaMatt01 @ChadPergram This post is not being liked enough üëÜ
@Doug_Zbi @ChadPergram God I hope that train üöû doesn‚Äôt roll thru town...
@ianbremmer I would give that 4 Pinocchio‚Äôs https://t.co/kwCd2eBc7b
@conservmillen Reporter: ‚Äúwhere do you see yourself in 5 years‚Äù? Me: ‚Äúhopefully unwilling to work‚Äù.
@conservmillen I prefer lazy but that is something a trumpian would say... like those shithole countries no outraged liberal would ever visit
@Magamillennial1 @CalebJHull @AOC The legal illegal immigrants, they will still be doing the work #Americans are not willing to do
@CalebJHull @AOC I worked construction in college, that shit is hard and sucks ass in bad weather. Can I just sit at home and collect the check???
@thehill You gotta admit, that‚Äôs a lot of force for a person guilty of lying. Kind of silly, if this was a normal citizen we would be raising hell... hell I have seen police take down huge drug lords with less force on #LivePDNation
#liberal #women this party does not care about you, they only care about your votes. What happened to all the #celebrities that were making #MeToo vids about #Kavanaugh and the #BelieveSurvivors ?? They don‚Äôt care, you‚Äôre just political topics https://t.co/tr5hFrWohJ
@RealSaavedra I imagine the view from inside the room is a lot different from standing outside looking thru the window...
@Noahpinion Then you must control what the trades charge to build said House and what the suppliers charge for wood, windows, etc. and we are talking private health insurance goes away, who pays home owners for their land for wind farms an solar or does the govt take it
@Noahpinion The thing that blows my mind is it is not socialism it‚Äôs communism and here is why. In order to provide ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù housing that means the govt must control the price of land (largest cost of home price) or own the land and allow building on it (govt housing)
@Uncle_Jimbo It was pretty funny
@BethCoyne3 @manfromthehand @i_workout_c3 @TrottSharon @SpeakerPelosi Not until they can fix themselves something to eat. Until then they are just ectoparasites ü§î
@sandiepar @i_workout_c3 @manfromthehand @TrottSharon @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/vAKHdrzIaT
@manfromthehand @i_workout_c3 @TrottSharon @SpeakerPelosi ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have the means to obtain appropriate family planning‚Äù??? Who the hell cannot afford a gas station bathroom condom... last I checked Health Departments gave out condoms by the brown bag full. Also Pulling  out is always free üçÜüí¶
@RealSaavedra Do we really think Oprah, Bill Gates and the like are just going to hand over most of their money? Is that really what we think they are gonna do? CA has more Billionaires than any other state but CA also has the largest homeless population. Normal people are going to pay 4 this
@NolteNC Because it worked one time... it‚Äôs a % game just like golf
@DarleneCypser @GolpeoBolas @SCOTUSblog @nycsouthpaw I am conservative and am totally ok with this ruling. Until it is finally decided we should not limit the ability.
Do #Liberals really think that #BILLIONAIRE s will just stay here and let the government tax them at 70 or 90%??? Rich people are rich because they protect their money üí∞ #Dems to pass law forbidding the rich from leaving the country
@ThePeckhamPost @JeffBowskill @Steel94010 @natekrinsky @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh And so the the less traveled ones are great and new but real toll roads that are traveled more because alternative routes do not exist. The government does not keep those well traveled roads Maintained like you think
@JeffBowskill @Steel94010 @ThePeckhamPost @natekrinsky @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh Our toll roads are amazing because no one travels on them. The WV turnpike has been a toll road since 1954. The road is one of the most traveled and sucks
@MattWalshBlog But walls are immoral and bridges are not
@ThePeckhamPost @Steel94010 @JeffBowskill @natekrinsky @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh Except most people avoid till roads which in turn raises the price for people who do drive the toll road.  HOA have the ability to foreclose or force you to pay, will the government make that same promise???
@kassy So I can‚Äôt celebrate a made up celebration unless I am from where that made up celebration happens... got it
@_Drew_McCoy_ But it was funny
@elliotsharron @SaysSimonson @jonathanchait Kind of that ‚Äúwe have to pass it to see what‚Äôs in it‚Äù
@Pain_N_Simple @JohnCornyn What if: Our President won the election fair and square because that is how the electoral college was set up and all we are doing is wasting millions of dollars and time instead of helping the country.
@RedTails944 @norcalpunkman @Ilhan But people poop on the street, so then there‚Äôs that
@norcalpunkman @Ilhan How about, if you can‚Äôt afford to live in NYCity... move to a town where you can afford to live.
@roadrunneron314 @thehill But they are resisting
@Apollon101 I am sure some of that is choice. The cost to on board, train, and keep an employee who only works 6 hours a week is not in the employers benefit
@tonytribby @KattyKayBBC @GovHowardDean But if everyone is riding the train, those short lines just got longer. Everything that is great about trains goes away when everyone has to ride them. Look at how sucky flying is today compared to the 1960s and 1970s
@Apollon101 @jeremycorbyn How many people are working just one hour a week, the cost to onboard an employee would cost more than just an hour of work to repay.
@JeffBowskill @natekrinsky @ThePeckhamPost @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh Amazing what you can do when you have people willing to contribute.  America‚Äôs problem is we have too many people that are not willing to share the expense
@melissamcewen @jallepap @MikeWiseguy @AmaierIRL @TimSEsq @HotlineJosh If everyone is taking the train because they are so much cheaper and better making flying not necessary. Won‚Äôt all of those people that make flying suck just make train riding suck also?,
@2AvSagas @rlux Do the trains pick you up at your house? Won‚Äôt people ha e to travel to a train station, wait in line, and go they security? Not everyone lives in high density populated areas
@JeffBowskill @natekrinsky @ThePeckhamPost @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh That is what Costa Rica does and most places are dirt or gravel roads. What happens when your neighbors no longer want to pay their fair share do you force them or pay the difference?
@spideypencil @esaagar @ashleylynn_____ I have no problems with any government entity as long as there is good reason, the general public has no such application. You don‚Äôt give up your rights when you become president
@Wwolfhunt @Atheistheart @senatorshoshana https://t.co/AvlGxMWGKt
@Wwolfhunt @Atheistheart @senatorshoshana Hospitals are required to, part of that whole non for-profit thing and oh ok... https://t.co/HqdXoWUrh4
@Wwolfhunt @Atheistheart @senatorshoshana Their Head guy had to step down... are you kidding me? And I talk to my dad almost daily and he bitches about the 4 and 5 hour waits, and satisfied and happy are not the same things.  Would my dad go someone else for care, no but he hates having to go...
@DoneWith45 @CWBChicago @310Dillon @RaferWeigel @Chicago_Police Do you not remember Rio Olympics and the swimmers making up the story that. They got robbed at a gas station.
@esaagar Why is the public entitled to see someone‚Äôs returns??? The IRS already has all of them, that is why he is being audited... it‚Äôs not like he never filed so no one knows what‚Äôs in his taxes... and if there was something there, it would have been leaked.. remember @cnn tax fiasco
@spideypencil @esaagar @ashleylynn_____ News flash the IRS already has every year that is why they are auditing him... do you really not think of there really was something it would not have been leaked by now
@revuocnavamalak @Covfefe2020Eas @esaagar Doesn‚Äôt mean they understood corporate and high income earners tax returns... hell some of them do even understand how the constitution works and they had to take a damn class 2nd year
@Wwolfhunt @Atheistheart @senatorshoshana How broke is our social security? And Medicare is so successful most doctors won‚Äôt even take patients that use it. Oh yea democratic socialism working well...
@Wwolfhunt @Atheistheart @senatorshoshana Is that sarcastic? I would not call social security or Medicare successes and how many people died waiting on services from the VA???
@spooder71 @CWBChicago @JussieSmollett And the man hours where they could be investigating real crimes, since there are shootings almost everyday
@WheyCooler @Chicago_Police They did? When was this and I thought it was two guys?
@greekninja1 @OTfan522 Like the polls that predicted Hillary 2016? I didn‚Äôt say you were mad, I meant you‚Äôre a dick
@nataliejohnsonn This must be how #CoryBooker can tell if his employees are #LBGT
@_waleedshahid @AOC @justicedems @sunrisemvmt It‚Äôs called ratio
@Chicago_Police Why are you guys not out looking for #JussieSmollett attackers???
@greekninja1 @OTfan522 @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh Being right about an issue, but so obnoxious about it that nobody cares.
@EsotericCD What amazes me is that most people don‚Äôt want to be around other people, that‚Äôs why we drive cars and not ride buses. #subwaycreatures
@aseedinthewind @thehill @AOC Canada üá®üá¶ doesn‚Äôt give you reparations?
@the_davidhenry @Th3DogHouse @thehill @AOC So are the poor homeowners going to pay for their own homes to be retro-fitted or is that what ‚Äúbillionaires‚Äù are going to pay for?
@greekninja1 @OTfan522 @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh While they can doesn‚Äôt mean we have it in the bank. I can write checks all day but I still have to have the funds and so does the Government
@RedSkull476 @LeaderHoyer @POTUS Looks like some have a ways to go to get to that 2% https://t.co/uBahi5bUr1
@greekninja1 @natekrinsky @ThePeckhamPost @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh Just facts
@greekninja1 @OTfan522 @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh You think federal governments run things better than local and state governments do?
@natekrinsky @ThePeckhamPost @greekninja1 @MJtheProphet @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh I know most of the train infrastructure in the west was built with Japanese slave labor, is that how we built it again? Slave labor
@greekninja1 @jimgeraghty @HotlineJosh You must not have rode on a Amtrack lately. I almost took one from NC to Philly. $200 one way and it took 8 hours get there. Flew @SouthwestAir cost $149 and was there in 2 hours. No one is going to ride a train üöû
@Mr_Skakke @BendamanA No ads in local and sales taxes on top and tell us what the total number is. Isn‚Äôt 35% just the income tax?
@Mr_Skakke @smilerz91 That is now how our country is set up. We are like no other country because that is how our founding fathers set up the country. We didn‚Äôt care much for the Europe way...
@thefunnymuggle Which is why CA has more billionaires than any other state and the largest homeless pop... celebrities are not gonna give up their money people and they shouldn‚Äôt have to. They built that shit not you
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom I don‚Äôt think any of them should step down BTW, everyone should get redemption and I agree. I think we would agree on more than you think
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom You said they shouldnt because it is a local state matter and I am saying well they don‚Äôt have problems trying to influence the election with money, so obviously they are involved in local politics all the time; both sides are
@spamela5510 @RaleighReporter Hey @WRAL  where are you on this??
@jaketapper @ScottJenningsKY @finneyk @abbydphillip @jeffzeleny @TheLeadCNN I thought you Dems were tired of old rich white men
@KellanMartz @USTaxAttorney @thehill Well a major motion picture called Soul Man was made in the 80s and made 35 mil at the box office.
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom You mean like the millions of dollars Dems spent trying to win the GA and FL gubernatorial races?
@RedSkull476 @LeaderHoyer @POTUS You‚Äôre right at some point just saying pretty please pay what your supposed to doesn‚Äôt work and you have to take action. Kind of like Obama and his red line he never backed up
@RedSkull476 @LeaderHoyer @POTUS Because NATO allies are not paying there share, Obama did the same in 2016 https://t.co/2mv3dTYM29
@RedSkull476 @LeaderHoyer @POTUS The president doesn‚Äôt have the power to sanction a country, only Congress can do that and Russia has been under US sanctions since 2004  and more were imposed in Aug of 2018
@JohnLoewe76 @realDonaldTrump Ah your still resisting, that‚Äôs sweet https://t.co/xiFTGUHvhD
@sahilkapur Wow, just wow
@CodofC @MrJustinFREAKIN @ndr69424529 @eloiseviolet @ColumbiaBugler @WalshFreedom Republicans can block local police investigations??? Say it isn‚Äôt so....
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom I don‚Äôt know that I would call the VA dumpster fire a local news story but ok...
@IdleOats @RepYvetteClarke @AOC Poor people don‚Äôt own property? That is one of the dumbest statements I have heard in a while, clearly you are a liberal.  65% of all Americans own their home and yes those people will be responsible for retro fitting their home with this nonsense
@RedSkull476 @LeaderHoyer @POTUS Well what are they getting???
@3catsmeow @WalshFreedom What bad behavior? None of it was corroborated. His drinking is that what we are talking about?
@jsho12 @WalshFreedom Unfortunately they are one in the same this day and age
@juney9800 @WalshFreedom If it was at your black neighbors house, then yes you should
@Carhoch @WalshFreedom None have came out yet and I am sure the #MSM have done their fair share digging but so far only Democrats in VA seem to be having that issue. Maybe you should roll again
@CodofC @ndr69424529 @eloiseviolet @ColumbiaBugler @WalshFreedom I must have missed his guilty verdict
@Spareski72 @ndr69424529 @eloiseviolet @ColumbiaBugler @WalshFreedom And he liked beer, a lot
@Complex Or they targeted him because he is here illegally and committed a felony
@JKDAnthony10 @TheAtlantic @emmaogreen There were over 15000 late term abortions in 2015, they are not that rare
@LeaderHoyer @POTUS Damn man, we are 2 years into this #POTUS when are the Russians going to take over our country????  All we hear is how #trump handed üá∫üá∏ to Russia but  they still seem to be staying in their own country
@Steamboater So all you have to do is tell another person and that makes it true??
Wait till the taxes get raised on other goods to offset the revenue on no one buying cigs... Hawaii is considering raising the minimum smoking age to 100  https://t.co/cJqfTNfcyj
@VirtualLupin @ewarren California has more billionaires than any other state, they also have the largest homeless population. If taxing billionaires worked or you thought they would actually do it, CA would not be 3T in debt
@AnnCoulter Too soon
@KatTimpf So I can do it in the Presidential quarters
@KurtSchlichter Do you show up for the Boss‚Äô birthday party knowing he is trying to get rid of you??? I just get a co-worker to bring me some cake üç∞
@AbdulElSayed Medicare for all reduced the coffee to Tasters Choice... instant
@ChrisMurphyCT I might move to your district just so I can vote again you, instead of rushing for that hot take...
@jwilliamhoffman @HowardMortman @AG_Conservative Kagan was elected to the high court and never once was a judge before...
@ComfortablySmug I hope he mentions a 70% or higher tax on #BILLIONAIRE s and looks right at her when he does it
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom So a person can be a shitty human being but as long as they don‚Äôt have a lifetime appointment then everything is good... #gotit
@IdleOats @RepYvetteClarke @AOC So who is going to pay for retro fitting of EVERY window so it collects energy? How are the poor going to pay to have their homes generate solar power?
@dcbowser @PaulT22PT You realize stock buy backs don‚Äôt go into the CEOs pocket right? The share holders get the benefit of stock buy backs
@thehill I‚Äôm not racist I have black friends...
@Blitzkreg6 @HolmesJosh @WalshFreedom So the line is how long the job lasts?
@bethanyshondark Over 15,000 late term abortions were performed in 2016...
@IdleOats @RepYvetteClarke @AOC Did you read it? 75,000 homes is all it has a potential and no one has figured out how to store solar power yet which is what you need to do in a grid
@RepYvetteClarke @AOC The largest solar farm in America can only provide enough power for the #NYSubway we don‚Äôt have enough land mass
@AOC Waiting on the announcement of solar panel  planes and electric F-16s
@DenverOilGuy @Goldenseed13 @BuckSexton Yes they did
@samstein What happened to #BelieveSurvivors  and #BelieveAllWomen ???? #MeToo
