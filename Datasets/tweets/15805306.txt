@danpfeiffer Most brilliant comment ever
@robjective Every media outlet I've seen has covered this (spanning left to right politically). You are misleading the public and, worse, you are siding with Trump in trying to delegitimize the press - obviously that helps your bottom line. You are the swamp.
@robjective Oh really.... you are an expert in political science? You are equipped to analyze the complexities of persuasion and the results of that on voting behavior? Your tweets are startlingly simplistic and amateurish as well as misleading.

@robjective You've seen ALL the Russian ads?  Really?  Because you've been telling us how incredibly difficult/impossible to identify all of their disinformation. Which is it?
RT @danpfeiffer: It is worth noting that the Russians believed that the best way to damage America was help elect Donald Trump.

@KTHopkins No, not everybody is thinking that. For the record, I am white and privileged and NOT liberal, and I was not thinking that. Maybe you need to take a hard look at your own fucked up thinking and also at the self-centeredness that makes you assume everyone thinks the way you do
@TimesofSanDiego @DarrellIssa Thank you for voting NO! We appreciate you! Please convince other CA reps to follow you. CA, NY, etc would suffer terribly. The bill is extremely unpopular and will backfire on our party. Deficit will skyrocket.  Please share your wisdom with other reps, especially in California!
@RepPaulCook Please vote NO on the tax bill. This extremely unpopular bill will hurt our party &amp; blow up the deficit! Please let your principles prevail. Passing bad legislation just so Congress can get a "win" will backfire on Republicans and hurt the 8th and all of California
@PodSaveAmerica @iJesseWilliams @TVietor08 I'd like to see us saying something like "believe the women and men" or "believe the people [who come forward]" because men also are targets of sexual assault. I fear deeply that men will be far less inclined to speak if we continue to frame this so strongly as a women's issue.
@Alyssa_Milano MEN have broken their silence too, not just women. We need to talk about this, too. It stops men from coming forward with their experiences of sexual assault when we fail to include them when we talk about breaking the silence.
@DanScavino @POTUS @realDonaldTrump "War on Christmas" is a f---ing joke, and you know it. Thanks for continuing to stoke anger and divide our country. Because that really makes America great, right?
