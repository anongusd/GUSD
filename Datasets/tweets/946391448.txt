@esglaude @realDonaldTrump It’s the economy!! I will say it again if economy stays strong trump wins in 2020 most people vote with their pocketbooks
@JoyceWhiteVance Witch hunt
@thehill That’s not the rule the or the law the law is potus has ultimate authority over this issue there is no grey area
@ananavarro Congrats on the wedding

@DerekCressman Interpretation- Mueller did not find anything so we have to keep digging until we do- a joke
@tribelaw @walterdellinger They are not serious about oversight. What you are seeing is not oversight but rather a true attempt to overthrow the 2016 election. Tribe and dellingrr know better. Their hate however for trump has shown they are not serious about respecting the constitution

@JRubinBlogger This is not oversight it is a witch-hunt disguised as oversight
@rickklein Knock yourself out Gerry - while potus is improving the economy, creating jobs and lowering taxes - Gerry, the dems and liberal media will waste their time chasing ghosts
@MSNBC This is definitely a line from lanny DAVIS .  Lanny’s liberal conspiracy theories could not help Clinton get elected he now uses Cohen to try to take down potus - unreal that the left gives these statements any credibility. The dems still do not accept results of 2016 election
@MeetThePress @Jim_Jordan @chucktodd Chuck and the left wing media still holding on to crumbs of the discredited dossier.  The dossier is evidence however of collusion between the Clinton campaign and a foreign power
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Still angry she lost. Shameful she never accepted the results of the 2016 election.
@MSNBC Of course she does! saying trump’s is racist is a litmus test to run for the dem nomination. The problem is Hilary called him a racist 24/7 365 days a week and still lost! Kamala would be smart to choose another line of attack but she won’t thisbis why she will lose
@tribelaw It can’t be an abuse of power if it is within his authority to do it
@tribelaw @RepAdamSchiff Sorry this is the Schiff who said the blocked phone number was trumps- ha! Schiff is changing the narrative because he knows mueller has found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy classic bait and switch- Schiff has no credibility
@robreiner @MalcolmNance So funny with every new witness there is hope by the obsessive left and media that this will be the one to end the presidency it started with Flynn then manafort then gates and so on and then reality sets in and they realize that there is no collusion and no crimes - next withess
@kylegriffin1 Absolutely congress can waste their time and taxpayers money asking questions if they want but it is clear it is within potus authority to grant or take away clearance
@JackPosobiec The narrative has to change on collusion because the left and media know now that mueller will not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy
@heckyessica @DailyCaller Jessica so right and too funny
@DanielMillerEsq The green new deal is more crazy than Cruz’s statements the left needs help
RT @rcale1776: Jon Stewart “Listen up everybody, the Trump Justice Dept is doing an excellent job administrating the 911 compensation act”…
@TiffanyDCross @Yamiche @JoyAnnReid @NatashaBertrand @maddow @marianaatencio @Maria_Hinojosa How about a republican- oh wait all of you don’t like to hear opposing views sorry
@thehill Schiff is the only one
@JackPosobiec Let them@knock themselves out a total waste of taxpayers time and money
@SethAbramson Potus is right - McCabe fired; strok fired; page fired; Orr about to be fired and others. These are the disgraced FBI agents that started this witch hunt - there needs to be an independent counsel to investigate - somethings not right with the fbi
@MeetThePress @Jim_Jordan @chucktodd Sorry chuck it is the facts and how come chuck and the rest of the left wing media won’t discuss the strangeness of the following:	strok - fired	Page - fire	McCabe - fired	There are others. These are the disgraced FBI agents who started the witch hunt -will the dems investigate??
@tedlieu @FaithNPolitics Ted you are so right! We are catholic as well but sometimes we go to a baptist church to wake up a little bit!!
@brianstelter More faux outrage Brian?
@RBReich Then i guess you have a problem with Abraham Lincoln
@SethAbramson Lindsey is right it goes to men’s Rea
@thehill @SethAbramson More waste of time - trump derangement syndrome continues the Congress will waste everyone’s time and money with their obsession to bring down potus because they can’t beat him at the ballot box - shameful or as potus says these people are sick!!!
@SethAbramson It’s clear Cohen was lying come in dude the sdny information said he wanted a White House job this convict was committing perjury all day long he will be prosecuted for perjury
@NatashaBertrand @SethAbramson He is a bodyguard for Christ sake!!
@rgoodlaw @SethAbramson @kenvogel @KatyTurNBC It was obvious it was a joke
@kylegriffin1 @SethAbramson @MSNBC That will go real far! More waste of time from the Democrats what don’t they understand about how granting security clearance to jarred was within potus complete authority
@NatashaBertrand @SethAbramson McCabe should be going to jail for lying to the fbi i wouldn’t believe a word he says
@washingtonpost Let congress ask questions and knock themselves out - it is within the president’s discretion and power not some career bureaucrat!! A hearing on this is a waste of time and taxpayers money!!
@BillKristol Too funny but i am glad you enjoyed the opera
@tribelaw Lawrence stop obsessing over extra constitutional ways to overturn the 2016 election. Why not try to beat potus at the ballot box with a healthy debate on ideas - i know it’s tough - the economy is great;unemployment is low etc. but isn’t this what democracy is about - ideas
@waltshaub I guess the same question can be asked about a prosecutor in the special prosecutors office who attended Hillary's post election party - or a special prosecutor who is good friends with Comey - or an AG who meets with bill Clinton on a plane while his wife is under investigation
@antitrumpresist @NicolleDWallace I hav heard this before - he will resign, he wont run, he cant win - it amazes me how many people underestimate the president - he wont resign not in his DNA he is a fighter and will win the next election
@Dianeelombardi @NicolleDWallace We shall see - he has a very strong base and the dems are moving too far left
@MSNBC I will make this clear one more time - There is no way AG BARR will allow any prosecutor or any office including the overrated SDNY to go against DOJ policy and indict this president on a campaign finance violation - wont happen.
@Dianeelombardi @NicolleDWallace didn"t help hillary
@NicolleDWallace absolutely!! he is ready for political war! and he has his base behind him - democrats and media are in for a difficult fight
@NatashaBertrand Isn’t that the committee that found no evidence of collusion??
@khloekardashian Hang in there
@PreetBharara We don’t agree politically but i do respect your opingvand legal ability congrats my friend
@funder He is right it is bs he knows they are trying everything to bring him down dems and the media will never accept the election results of 2016 - will they accept the results of 2020??
@JoyceWhiteVance @JohnJHarwood Comet lied to Congress should be prosecuted for perjury
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Also collusion delusion- great line!! He is on fire today
@BillKristol @MollyJongFast We know where your mind will be
@JoyceWhiteVance Collusion delusion
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Keep trying maybe you can get him for killing jimmy hoffa - trump derangement syndrome continues
@JoyceWhiteVance Really Joyce blaming those deaths on trump shows serious trump derangement syndrome
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews The trump derangement syndrome by the dems and the media continues this is not oversight it is a sick attempt to try to take down a president-
@BillKristol Do you feel left out bill? Trumps form of pragmatic conservatism beat out your more academic conservatism the people spoke in 2016 and will speak again in 2020
@HeidiNBC @NBCNews The obsession is sickening i believe as reps of the people they have much better things to do than obsessing of potus tax returns - unbelievable
@Damian_Barr Congrats!!
@BillKristol And so are 90% of the politicians
@gtconway3d @RWPUSA Conway is a joke! He has trump derangement syndrome along with presidential envy a bad combination
@JesseKellyDC Jesse you are so right this guy will flame out when he realizes that climate change even for democrats according to polling is not a number one issue
@justinamash Come on Justin do you think this is what the Democrats are doing? The democrats and the media have declared war on president trump. If you don’t understand this you are too naive to Serv.The hearings are not a search for the truth but rather a pretext to bring down potus.Wake up!
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Sorry Jake it was actually Michael Cohens testimony saying: no collusion; confirming potus did not instruct him to lie and saying paying of the porn star was a pattern and practice prior to the campaign i would say potus is probably sipping champagne right now
@Elex_Michaelson @tedlieu @FOXLA So funny to see the dems and liberal media fall all over themselves to bolster lying Cohen’s credibility - he lied under oath on tv in front of millions and was caught by Jim Jordan to ignore it is to truly have trump derangement syndrome. Dems and media still want blood for 2016
@PRDDEPLBL0157 @renato_mariotti @TIME So true they really have no shame
@amjoyshow @USATODAY @MSNBC Is mueller handling it !! Maybe he can indict some more Russians
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Stop the false hysteria Chris
@JoeNBC Amash will get a primary challenge
@InvestigateRU @MalcolmNance Eveyif he received a heads up it’s not a crime my friend - that is why no Americans will be indicted for conspiracy with Russia
@renato_mariotti @TIME Crazy- it was the media and the left that created mueller as their savior it really is a shame that now the left and the media are saying it’s actually trumps fault that mueller the so called best prosecutor ever can’t prove collusion- this is too funny you can’t make this up!!
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Sorry DAVID the Otto situation was sad but potus understands more than one life is at stake now there are millions of lives at stake. To make peace with Kim he must establish trust

@JoyceWhiteVance @maddow These are just allegations by a convicted felon going to jail
@Morning_Joe Morning joe is the best comedy show on tv should win an Emmy from the conspiracy theories to the faux outrage it is just 😂 a train wreck you can’t stop watching love the comedy keep me laughing joe!!
@McFaul You don’t need to when you give Iran billions of dollars to reek havoc around the world
@MeetThePress @dpletka Democrats and left wing media still have not accepted the results of the 2016 election
@NicolleDWallace Different country can’t happen in the us
@DavidCornDC David corn is seeing the light definitely backtracking- he knows now that there is no collusion
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It is under the president’s power to determine who gets clearance and who does not
@AriMelber Won’t happen for the sdny to indict a sitting president they would need approval from bob Barr there is no way bob Barr would permit sdny to go against doj policy
@RepAdamSchiff He is the president he is allowed to determine who gets clearance and who does not just like he is allowed to determine what should remain classified
@MeetThePress @realDonaldTrump What?? Impeachment for a campaign violation?? If democrats impeach over the campaign violation you can all but gaurantee trump will win a second term.
@benshapiro The opposite Ben - you can’t be that naive where you think Kim’s just going to give up nukes because you asked him to - trump is building trust and mutual respect the foundations of good diplomacy
@GlennKesslerWP To keep the parties talking Glenn communication and trust are the foundations of diplomacy- potus is doing work other presidents should have done trying to establish some trust
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Again conjecture they will not indict a sitting president
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff I will say it again sdny will not indict a sitting president they would have to violate policy to do it- additionally they would need approval from trumps AG Barr - won’t happen
@DavidCornDC Testimony was a dudd!!
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff All indications are report is imminent very unlikely he will indict after report
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Potus will not be charged too difficult to prove it’s a crime see john Edwards case
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Doubtful would have happened already mueller will wrap up with no more significant indictments
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Agree with your assessment of the plea but if it was such a clear cut crime where’s the indictments of other parties involved- don jr etc
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff But not charged one of the reasons they won’t charge potus is the fact that it is not a crime
@MeetThePress @RepCummings Too much self importance by Cummings- 200 years from now the Cohen circus will be a footnote but potus making peace with Kim will go down as a significant history making moment
@Bailey1050 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Really? I thought the left narrative was he knew where the bodies where buried - come on ?? Your starting to believe your own conspiracy theories
@giancarlo1985g1 @DeeCizmadia1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Good luck to dc attorney general maybe one of these political prosecutions will stick but nothing so far
@giancarlo1985g1 @DeeCizmadia1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Do you work there? And query this if mueller won’t violate doj policy and prosecute a sitting president do you really think sdny will? They would need approval from trumps AG Barr- chances are zero
@KatyTurNBC Now the media knows that mueller can’t bring down potus the obsession switches to sdny - if mueller won’t violate doj policy and indict potus do you really think the sdny will? Especially when they will need approval by AG Barr. No chance
@DeeCizmadia1 @giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff I just state facts potus will not be charged by sdny on a hush money case it is not a crime.
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff It was a plea not a trial and they had Cohen on other charges they won’t charge potus with this
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Again you have to understand the data he is competitive in those states he already has enough in the bank for 120 electoral votes he won the electoral college with 46% of the vote -
@a1heromonk @giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Nice try
@giancarlo1985g1 @a1heromonk @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Keep living in the echo chamber like 2016
@GinnyMorse3 @TylerTheChef @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Same premise there is a doj internal memo post Mortem after the Edwards case that even questioned whether they would bring that type of case again
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Not proven they will have a very difficult time proving same especially with cohens testimony today establishing this was a pattern way before the election
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff I did but you are not analyzing the data to be at 40 percent in any state with 1 year and a half to go is being competitive if you don’t think so you may be more shocked in 2020 than i am sure you were in 2016
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff We will see my friend we will see
@TylerTheChef @GinnyMorse3 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff neither are crimes for the hush money payment see the john Edwards case review it then come talk to me - not a crime
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Au contraire mon frere! The state by state shows that he is competitive in a lot of states he has work to do but if economy is strong and mueller report is not that damaging you will see the numbers grow
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Will never happen - potus still has 80% approval with republicans. keep living in your bubble like you did during the 2016 election and potus will win again in 2020- MAGA
RT @realDerekUtley: Michael Cohen is a liar! Retweet if you agree!
@newtgingrich So true newt and the left wing media just losers over this fact
@maggieNYT Sounds like something lanny DAVIS would write
@giancarlo1985g1 @ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff Good luck with impeachment- that will be more if a circus than today. Also it’s a dead end because senate will never vote to convict

@RepMarkMeadows Great job today mark you were awesome way to stand up to this circus!!
@JRubinBlogger None are criminal the only one that may come close is the vetting of false testimony but the lawyers would need the men’s Rea (intent) which is not evident here - nice try though jen😀
@JRubinBlogger Where is the crime or the indictments against trump- no crimes mueller will exonerate him
@JRubinBlogger Keep dreaming mueller will not bring charges impeachment will be nothing but a circus as the senate will never vote to convict looks like you have to try to beat him at the ballot box
@ProudResister @RepAdamSchiff He exonerated potus with regard to collusion there is no other reading of his testimony it was clear he also exonerated him with this so called hush money theory by saying this was his modus operandi well before the election clear defense to the hush money conspiracy theory
@RadioFreeTom @TheRickWilson And nothing will change the never trumper cult like yourself i actually feel sorry for you - using this liar Cohen as your savior to bring down a presidency was sickening and you can’t even see it - again i feel sorry for you
@funder The only traitors are democrats in Congress for putting on this circus while trump was negotiating for peace in the world - so sad they are trying so hard to bring him down because they can’t beat him in an election
@matthewamiller That is a convicted liars statement won’t hold much weight also we keep seeing that this is a campaign finance crime don’t be so sure - see for example the john Edwards case no crime
@RWPUSA The legal process can be frustrating Richard but there is a thing called the constitution
@JRubinBlogger Remember the fbi was sniffyaround the wife’s finances but the left press won’t ask Bernie about that
@JoyceWhiteVance Really ? and all of sudden we are to believe a convicted liar who wants to bring down the president? My guess is potus poll numbers go up after Cohen testimony no one except for democrats and left wing media will believe him
@JRubinBlogger @PhilipRucker Your trump derangement syndrome is really sad

@JRubinBlogger Everyone knows including potus that we will have to live with a nuclear North Korea but potus while unconventional has done an amazing job making kim talk to the south and with the US - good policy to bring kim out of isolation
@jeffgiesea The left believes in science except when it goes against a narrative they believe in. It is very sad that states are allowing men to compete as women and call themselves women.  The only people that get hurt are the real women  - sad
@JRubinBlogger liberal media likes her but will it translate to democratic votes ?- I think she will have a problem with black females and will not get as much of that vote as pundits may think.
@JoyAnnReid Bold yes practical no - seems like an early hail mary by Ms Warren who is polling very low right now.  HER CAMPAIGN IS IN TROUBLE.
@matthewamiller @foxandfriends I guess it’s similar to having McCabe on morning joe and not asking why he lied or did he think that stroks texts to page compromised the investigation
@JoeNBC Funny to watch your show today and you backtracking on the mueller report it is clear now that you and your left wing conspiracy gang know that there will be no collusion in the mueller report now this has become a cottage industry and you are making lots of money off of it
@AnnCoulter Ok now i don’t know what school you graduated from but you should ask for your money back - obviously Russia and now China are trying to influence Venezuela do you want Russian missles in your back yard? Potus policy is correct !!
@MaxBoot Rhino!!!
@KamalaHarris That would be a violation of doj rules
@joshscampbell Mueller’s job is not to find wrong doing or even ethical violations his job was to find criminal violations and or conspiracy against the US don’t hold your breath looking for side commentary - if it’s not criminal it should not be in the report
@BillKristol Not if it keeps the two countries from@going to war
@JRubinBlogger Pompeo is smart and excellent this administration could bring world peace and you would still criticize it nevertheless you have been wrong since trump began to run trump will win again in 2020
@JoyceWhiteVance Manafort should and will be pardyhe is the victim of a political prosecution

@JoyceWhiteVance Still not a crim see eg johnn Edwards case
@melissagorga Congrats!! Awesome
@mitchellreports @JohnBrennan Andrea this is the problem with the press Walter kronkite would have never publicly supported a statement like this about a sitting president how can you continue to argue that you are objective?
@AriMelber I believe this may be double jeopardy and there should be a special counsel to investigate the prosecutor s if they are bringing similar charges brought by mueller just to avoid a pardon seems unconstitutional to me
@DavidCornDC @amyklobuchar David please!! Don’t cry me a river here msnbconspiracy dedicated a whole channel 24/7 to bring down trump samevwith cnn
@iamwandasykes @MalcolmNance And if cancer was cured by the trump administration i am a firm believer the democrats and media would push for mueller to investigate whether it was part of a conspiracy between trump and Putin
@SethAbramson Congressional oversight now pedals in gossip and heresay about the president to try to embarrass him- the stories will be told by a convicted liar and the subject will have nothing to do with the Russian investigation- what a joke !! They are making potus a martyr!!
@kimguilfoyle @BreitbartNews Mainstream media won’t even show it and surely won’t discuss it they are all in on all things trump they are making no excuses if it does not have an angle to take down trump it is not news - shameful
@DavidCornDC David you are missing the point the diplomacy here is smart they are in essence making Kim feel comfortable with western culture something that needs to be done before there is trust once again trump is thinking two steps ahead so yes any meeting is encouraging
@Peter_Wehner @AriMelber You must want to get booked on the show
@BillKristol Can’t be that bad no indictments or pleas of any Americans for conspiracy with Russians so the report can’t be that bad
@JRubinBlogger Not a good idea leaves the candidates open for the general they need to know what fire is coming prior to the general will make them better candidates
@JoeNBC Joe of course there will be but what about the left wing and media rhetoric that caused the scalise shoiting directed at republicans or the cop killer in Chicago that happened after Obama’s negative rhetoric about cops did you call that out - of course not
@fstop414 @washingtonpost What crime?
@fstop414 @N900Mixalot @washingtonpost Both sides need to stop there is no end game -
@washingtonpost For the sake of the country the Mueller probe should be the end. If States file separate actions it will be looked upon as purely political and will do nothing but continue to divide the nation.  If the dems want to defat trump they should do so at the ballot box
@tribelaw whose justice department approved the deal? under which president and attorney general?
@dbongino Very very true
@KamalaHarris Kamala you need to stop letting staffers author your tweets be authentic author your own tweets and don’t just use political sound bites people want to see your soul
@brianstelter This is what lawyers are paid to do
@RepMarkMeadows They did not accept the election: they will not accept results of mueller report and they won’t accept results of their own investigation results of senate intelligence committee- the problem is there is now a whole industry that makes money from the narrative it will never end!
@FrankFigliuzzi1 @NicolleDWallace @DeadlineWH Ho hum! more trump bashing by the left wing echo chamber
@SebGorka It definitely shows immaturity
@4amdg @RepMarkMeadows @mitchellvii Look there might b a lot of things the one thing i am sure of is that there has been no indictments or pleas of any Americans regarding conspiracy with the Russians so that will not be in the report
@RoArquette What constitutional law class did you take?
@tressa_bunch @RickPetree @JoyceWhiteVance So far no indictments or convictions of any Americans for conspiracy with the Russians if there was one and i missed it please let me know
@MarkWarner Mark you are asking the attorney general to vilolate internal policy and rules not a good idea
@RickPetree @JoyceWhiteVance Mueller's got nothing not one American indicted on the underlying conspiracy charge a waste of time  and taxpayer money
@matthewamiller @Morning_Joe It was an attempted coup my friend plain and simple rosenstein and McCabe have some explaining to do and they better lawyer up
@JoyceWhiteVance Who are the sources????
@MSNBC Sure you weren’t McCabe and you also didnt get caught lying to the fbi and to being a leaker nice try
@4amdg @RepMarkMeadows @mitchellvii I will say it again not one indictment of an American for the underlying charge of conspiracy with the Russians to steal the election - let me know if i missed something here the convictions are all small unrelated process crimes

@JoyceWhiteVance maybe because the press gets hysterical about everything trump - remember when he had his first physical the press was actually going hysterical about removing him from office because of his mental health unbelievable the press has created the hysterical atmosphere
@BlueWave2020NY @CuomoPrimeTime @brianstelter @ChrisCuomo Most shows don’t have her on because she does not promote the left wing hysteuand narratives she actually makes sense
@Gsoul_608 @BlueWave2020NY @TreyCarter88 @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @ChrisCuomo Too bad she is excellent
@RealJamesWoods Agreed James you can’t make this stuff up i can’t believe McCabe got as far is he did in the fbi again he is promoting a left wing narrative not fact
@AnnCoulter She is a rhino!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Rosenstein et tu brute
@RepMarkMeadows @mitchellvii So true and the left wing media will give them cover it is clear now that McCabe is talking that the investigation never should have began in the first place but the media and the left will not let it die crazy they start believing their own narratives even if the facts different
@AOCpress This Is the problem with the left and why Jesse did what he did the left likes to@promote and believe in narratives not facts so i am not surprised by her ignorance here
@kasie That’s even worse kasey! I even give democratic voters more credit than that - please cite to a poll@or study - most likely kasey is promoting a narrative not a factual statement
@kasie @BernieSanders Nice try kasey he is  going to need more bona fides than that  to get into the black churches on sundays and now that booker and Harris are in the race he has no chance at the black vote
@brianstelter @AC360 The man is a proven liar and should be held accountable
@c_soule999 @Rosie Who? McCabe? no read the IG report he lied multiple times to the FBI he belongs in jail for his lies and overall treasonous behavior!
@BarbMcQuade @Lawrence @TheLastWord @MSNBC Barb let me guess you will support everything McCabe said or did and critize potus for everything he said or did. You also will say that McCabe's lying to the FBI is somehow justified because you have a faith in him as a civil servant - spare me - McCabe belongs in jail
@BillKristol @LindseyGrahamSC Bill prior to becoming a never trumper you would have agreed with the substance of the speech now that you have trump derangement syndrome however, you don't agree with potus even when he is stating a fact
@KamalaHarris We now know from yeterdays surprise when ask about Jessie kamala does not write her own tweets potus does - please let kamal know she cant be authentic with staff writing tweets.

@NatashaBertrand Don’t you wish George bush would have believed someone other than his own intelligence community when we went to war in Iraq? Would have saved a lot of lives the intelligence community is not always correct history proves this potus should listen but use his own instincts
@MarkSimoneNY McCabe should be in jail along with strok and page pelley exemplifies the left wing media bias against trump that happens all day every day it is sad
@BarbMcQuade @matthewamiller Barb you are missing the issue you are ignoring blatant evidence that strok, coney, page and McCabe wanting to bring down potus you can’t isolate that evidence from this ian attempted coup pure and simple McCabe has been fired for lying strok is worse how do you support this?
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump your right he should be sniveleing along with McCabe, strok and Comey they had a plan all along to take down the president - the hubris and gaul is absolutely crazy to think they thought they could subvert the will of over 64 million people they ought to be locked up! coup!
@MichaelAvenatti you are correct Michael but you an other left wingers who have trump derangement syndrome want to promote narratives other than promoting facts- look we realize all of you hate trump and everthing connected to him but would it be so hard to promote facts - lesson learned!
@JRubinBlogger same was said about the muslim ban and trump ended up winning in the end they do their homework although the mainstream media thinks otherwise - here because of the prior law enacted by congress they have an excellent argument for the emergency
@JRubinBlogger I would handicap him at 12 to 1 - no real serious chance in the dem primary but will make a resctable showing
@MalcolmNance Malcolm - no one cares!
@mitchellreports @AGBecerra Andrea if you look at the newest polls the base is not shrinking its growing - in fact the lates polls show 70% of republicans back the emergency declaration - just stating facts
@seanhannity It really shows you how intellectually deprved the left is for good ideas that now their savior is a 29 year old socialist/ communist who's only claim to fame before running for congress is being a barrista - the dem pres candidates are listening to her ? - unbelievable  !!
@RWPUSA it is treasonous when your only reason to do so is because he fired the discredited FBI director. McCabe - strok and Page all need to be put in jail! This was clearly a coup attempt that failed
@JoyceWhiteVance @AshaRangappa_ What should really make people sick is McCabe is a criminal and about to be indicted - strock has been discredited by disclosing emails that he wanted to take down the president with his girlfriend page he was fired and should be sent to jail like McCabe - this was clearly a coup
@PreetBharara Not illegal to have direct contact with wiki leaks it is the substance of the contacts that will matter if he was just trying to obtain info from wiki leaks clearly not a crime
@mitchellvii Potus is two steps ahead he is showing republicans how to lead
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Trump knows exactly what he is doing it’s a win he gets his money and the emergency keeps the immigration fight in the press Ann the rhino coulter you don’t understand trump or his base he is always two steps ahead
@AdamSchiff Stop waisting your time and do something constructive Schiff trying to bring down a legitimately elected president because you don’t like him is a waste of taxpayers money there is more to us interests do not include changing foreign policy for khashoggi
@RadioFreeTom Burr is so right otherwise Manafort would have been charged with conspiracy which he is not
@NicolleDWallace @FrankFigliuzzi1 If you go on Nicole Wallace show and say the most outrageous thing about the trump administration even if not true you will be invited back this show is more like Disney for trump haters
@BillKristol More conspiracy theories
@JoeNBC What a joke msnbconspiracy giving credibility to the laughable green new deal the show is the best comedy on tv definitely not a news show but should win an Emmy for best comedy
@brianstelter No Brian the hearing was sad the only reason they brought Whitaker in wa to try and get dirt on the president what a joke and please don’t say it is oversight since when does congressional oversight involve trying to get personal dirt on the president?
@SRuhle Have you ever been to the hood - probably not -elitist like yourself don’t understand that that is the only way some people in minority and economically disadvantaged communities can get loans
@JoeNBC @AOC Nice try joe have you seen oac’s twitter feed and the press she is getting - pelosi May be the beltway leader but unfortunately Oac is the soul- your beloved Democratic Party is in trouble the green new deal sounds like it was written by a 5th grader too far left
@sfpelosi @funder @POTUS The guy got cuaghtvwith his pants down and is claiming to be a victim- oldest trick in the book
@JeffBezos This guy Bezos sleeps with his mistress sends her dirty pics gets caught with photos and now is claiming to be a victim - no sympathy here my friend
@JoyceWhiteVance The echo chamber will unfortunately continue with the next generation
@JRubinBlogger Tank you justice Rubin but wrong again the letter was carefully crafted by lawyers not a crime sorry
@JoyceWhiteVance He is showing the American people that the hearing was a charade the only thing that the hearing illustrated is that the Democrats are so focused on trying to bring this president down and in the process will harm their own chances in 20/20
@SenKamalaHarris Every president gets to choose judges the only way to stop it is to win the next election elections have consequences
@JoyceWhiteVance The new ag William Barr is very smart has an acute legal mind and is the right person at the right time for the job of ag -

@ananavarro @JeffBezos Really? a guy who sends photos of his private parts to his mistress while married that’s the guy you respect - really ms Navarro?
@JoyceWhiteVance The Democrats are now creating a circus and will make trump a martyr which will lead to his successful re-election
@ananavarro Don’t worry Anne tulsi will not make it out of the Democratic primary i don’t think her campaign lasts 6 months
@AdamSchiff This is not oversight it’s a witch hunt
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce Martin Luther king junior was a person of faith there are many more he is correct
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics Waste of time and taxpayers money
@PardesSeleh I agree she is not even close to a conservative unbelievable
@vonnie301 @Donnamariemart5 @SenKamalaHarris You obviously don’t understand the black community she has to show some type of commitment or dedication early in the campyto get the black support i think it was a mistake not fatal but a mistake
@JoeNBC Because trump is selling their papers just like he is the reason your show is doing well Jeff zuckervsaid it best “we turn trump off and the audience goes away” you and the New York Times need to thank potus!
@JoyAnnReid Stop the hysteria
@JRubinBlogger Sorry Jennifer the public does not agree with you the polls even from msnbconspiracy show that Americans overwhelmingly liked the speech
@brianstelter @EricTrump @seanhannity Brian most Americans at least as the polls reflect thought the speech was good as well
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Eric what speech did you watch according to polls almost two thirds of Americans thought the speech was good
@SRuhle Stephanie Instead of criticizing why not acknowledge how good the economy is and give potus at least some credit - he has done an excellent job with the economy
@HardballChris Wrong very unifying speech the national public thought so as well it is the cable press that wants to focus on and keep promoting division
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Ann you need to join msnbc with your anti potus rhetoric you are on your way to being the number one guest of morning joe  - good luck voting for the Biden kamala ticket
@RepAdamSchiff Adam i think you wrote this before the state of the union because his speech was vastly different than what you portray the speech was about America 1st and unity
@MissMonica1212 @MichaelAvenatti @TMZ No threats at all just stating facts about his personal life that are in the news
@lasc1943 @SteveRattner @Morning_Joe That’s like saying i am healthy now but eventually i am going to die of course there will be a downturn but right now the economy is on fire rattner knows it instead of worrying about a possible downturn and blaming trump before it happens how about just sitting back and enjoy it
@SteveRattner @Morning_Joe economy is still booming Steve I think you should focus on that
@JoyceWhiteVance @JoyAnnReid Uh oh better get mueller to investigate- how much more can the media promote McCarthyism?
@CharlesMBlow Nice try lowest minority employment black and latino in decades I guess he is a racist please look at the facts don't just promote a narrative that has no factual basis
@clark10240585 @RepMarkMeadows @dbongino I guess we can start with the fake news he was pushing that the blocked phone numbers that trump jr was calling was a potus phone number he ran that narrative all year only to be proven wrong as usual the guy is a conspiracy theorist
@RedTRaccoon @politico They are wrong it’s time to get out of Syria nothing hood is going to come out of that situation
@clark10240585 @RepMarkMeadows @dbongino With the lies Schiff is telling he should be arrested for attempting a bloodless coup
@ReneeHoagenson @RedTRaccoon What about the experts that say a wall is needed?

@clark10240585 @RepMarkMeadows @dbongino Thank you my man i appreciate it
@DavidCornDC Whether he said it or not he is right!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DineshDSouza So true my man the media would be calling for corporate boycotts of Virginia if it was a repub gov unbelievable such hypocrisy
@Yamiche @K_JeanPierre Yamiche this governor is delusional and needs to step down
@PGenaux @tribelaw 100% call me whatever you like i speak only the truth
@tribelaw Base is too strong for that i believe when Mueller’s report comes out without a conspiracy conclusion his presidency will strengthen and if economy holds he wins a second term
@RepMarkMeadows @dbongino Schiff is wrong a lot but the media still have him on because he promotes the Russian narrative but his career is over as far as doing anything past congress
@kylegriffin1 She’s got no chance does not matter if the Russian army is backing her
@dbongino She should stay on the reservation her campaign is toast
@JoyceWhiteVance Sorry Joyce racism is racism whether it’s a Democrat or a republican it’s actually nice to see both dems and conservative’s come together to condemn the racist behavior
@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace Still not a crime
@JoyceWhiteVance Maybe mueller should investigate the tanning bed crisis too

@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw Love to play sometime if you ever in philly we play grass
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw I get it so he will only charge trump with conspiracy so smart
@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw I will return playing tennis
@tribelaw Sorry i don’t think muellyseed this either none of the indictments or information even come close to this conspiracy
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw Again you migh want let mueller know right now only process crimes no conspiracy crimes
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw If that was the case i would expect Manafort or some one else to be charged with conspiracy did not happen
@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw Of course he does things i don’t like but it does not make it a crime same with Obama but i do happen to think trump is doing an excellent job look at the economy may be the best economy in decades
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw I just deal in facts no crime
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw Again you better let mueller know before he closes shop no indictments of anyone concerning this conspiracy
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw Either do you factually i am correct there have been no indictments whatsoever concerning your remote conspiracy theory
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw Oh i see now you solved it better let mueller know before he closes shop because he has not brought any indictments regarding your conspiracy
@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw Now we are splitting hairs i don’t care if he had 100 towers in Russia it is not criminal and mueller does not think so either
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw Even if he did have business there it’s not criminal
@GaryDoner @Aaronpannell2 @tribelaw The plans did fall through the tower did not go anywhere
@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw He does not have any business in Russia the plans fell through it was an accurate statement
@Aaronpannell2 @GaryDoner @tribelaw He did not lie the trump tower deal was all over the news when he ran for president no one then thought it was a big deal -  please !
@GaryDoner @tribelaw Bae one who was convicted of a non process crime? Name one convicted of conspiracy with Russia- keep dreaming
@jch2407 @Ompayloo @tribelaw Sorry i still don’t see a crime here and apparently mueller agrees
@GaryDoner @tribelaw I am sorry Gary i must have missed that in one of the indictments please read that section of the indictment i must have missed it or is it something you and your leftist amateur sleuths conjured up!
@AprilDRyan Uh oh now it looks systematic time to step down
@GaryDoner @tribelaw Where the crime?
@Ompayloo @tribelaw No problem here following constitution it is the left that did not accept the results of 2016 and is using illegitimate means to overturn the will of the people
@tribelaw the perpetual conspiracies and hysteria from the left will never end I will say this directly to the left will you be able to accept the results of the Mueller investigation?  Because you surely can not accept the results of the 2016 election!
@RealJamesWoods none needed my friend
@AdamSchiff @jonlovett What about Adam Schiff misleading the public about trump jr's phonecall to a blocked phone number - shameful!! Adam your continuous false statements and attempts to mislead the public is hurting our democracy!
@AriBerman Or that Biden doesn’t run for president because he called Obama a “ good clean black”
@tribelaw Trump will follow his own instincts on this not McConnell's
@NatashaBertrand This is not true. mueller made the mistake of bringing a national intelligence matter into the federal court system I mean who does that. What a huge mistake and miscalculation on his part.  This why you don't see many national security matters in the federal court system.
@WSJ She is done she should save her money and end her campaign now painful to watch
@thehill Potus has 75 % approval rating among republicans would not b a smart move to challenge
@RealJamesWoods Where are the corporate boycotts of Virginia- if this was a repub governor there would be a rush by corporate leaders to put out a statement advocating for a boycott until the governor steps down
@neeratanden I am a trump supporter but i have to say Cory is very talented

@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump Can you say Kavanaugh hearing richard???
@ProudResister I don’t know ryan did you look at those economic numbers lately maybe the best in a lifetime if this is Russia influence it sure is helping American economic interests 👍
@RyanAFournier Media is avoiding it too
@SenKamalaHarris This is the first political strategy mistake should have invited an African American
@funder That Russian president sure is helping the American economy!!
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump Alls fair in love war and politics Richard Cory’s a big boy he can take it
@ccbandit4resist @funder Oh no!! Maybe mueller should investigate- more conspiracy theories and hysteria- a joke
@mitchellvii So true my man if Putin is behind these numbers it sure is helping Americans- liberal conspiracy and hysteria won’t stop however they just hate trump they can’t help themselves it is really sad best economy in a lifetime and libs can’t enjoy it i feel sorry for them actually

@AlaricCDX @MalcolmNance @MaxBoot I like this
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce come on the dems the media even you were pushing the theory that don jrs blocked calls were to potus and were nefarious facts are stubborn things time to stop pushing a narrative without facts - witch-hunt
@MalcolmNance @MaxBoot Malcolm’s whole reason for being depends on a conspiracy every time a fact comes out showing no conspiracy he sees his tv career slipping away
@craigunger @MalcolmNance Oh know more people to add to conspiracy and hysteria you will never let it end
@MalcolmNance Both you and max are wrong the meeting at trump tower is not illegal so if potus knew it would still not be criminal in any event the facts are coming out differently than trump hating media wanted facts are stubborn things

@JohnBrennan John didn't the unanimous assessment of the intelligence community get us into the Iraq war? - also you forget you and the rest of the intelligience people are NOT elected officials POTUS is elected and accountable to the American people its his decision and vision that counts
@RepAdamSchiff Stop trying to create a divide within the administration and sell false facts to theamerican people NY times just published an article that Isis Is down to two villages - Afghan peace deal is moving forward - time for troops to come home  you only oppose policy because its trump

@HillestadCara @tedlieu @EdMarkey @POTUS That’s just more hysteria from the left potus is actually promoting peace bringing home troops from Afghanistan and Syria
@HillestadCara @tedlieu @EdMarkey @POTUS The law is a bad law it won’t pass
@HillestadCara @tedlieu @EdMarkey @POTUS You can’t make laws just to regulate who is in office to make yourself fell better bad public policy
@lennartreus @brianstelter @JohnKingCNN @JFKucinich There really is just read up on two prominent climate scientists Judith curry and richard lindzen it is a very interesting debate as to how much if any human activity is causing warming
@brianstelter @JohnKingCNN @JFKucinich Brian you need to read Judith curry and richard lindzen two very prominent climate scientists who express skepticism of how much human activity is actually contributing there is more debate within the scientific community than is portrayed in the media
@tedlieu @EdMarkey @POTUS Not a good law ties the presidents hand in times of emergency good intentions but bad law
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris Like him early on thought he could win i think he is a lot smarter than people give him credit for of course i don’t support everything but i knew he would be good on economy and jobs and would slow some if the progressive movement that i thought was getting out of control
@JoeNBC Joe and the mainstream media will crown her early not ask her tough questions protect her from any negative stories- the problem is this won’t make her a better candidate for the general
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris Agreed Biden needs to be on short leash but he does speak well regarding foreign policy - gaffe prone is an understatement he has made some statements some would consider racist
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris True statement the economy is everything for potus if it is strong he will be difficult to beat if it tanks he will have an uphill climb
@JoeNBC Joe and Mika will give kamala a free pass because she is an African American female and they harbour white guilt - watch they will never ask kamala a difficult question
@tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi Why because she kept the government shutdown what a joke dems so in need of a hero they follow a false prophet like Nancy the love affair won’t last
@maggieNYT If true it is great news for POUTUS
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris I agree there. Biden has support especially where it could hurt my candidate Trump - I think trump wou;ld prefer harris over Biden.  But I do think the wildcard is Hillary she may decide to get back in the race if no one catches fire. I agree booker looks like he may sit out.
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @PressSec More conspiracy theories
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris Not argumentative at all I respect your opinion it is a great debate!  I agree the base is black women Kamala will not automatically get that vote - Obama had to work for it as well.  I agree if she gets the black vote she wins the nomination but it is not a guarantee
@Msb00mbastick Thank you Justice Boombastic
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris I am not a democrat or a progressive but I am a political junkie - kamala is talented don't get me wrong I just don't think she has enough progressive bona fides to electrify your base - I could be wrong but she has not shown it so far also look for the media to crown her early
@davidaxelrod @KamalaHarris @CNN Again she is smart  and eloquent - I expect the mainstrain media to give her a pass, but she is not an inspiring speaker
@JoyAnnReid Please anything POTUS does you will react to in a negative way the tax cut acted as a stimulus to the economy, fueled growth and now you are seeing companies reinvest in wges and plants - its working but the mainstream media will not report it
@Msb00mbastick The courts will make that decision.  That's the beauty of the system like the muslim ban you and everyonelse said he was wrong supreme court said he was right - democracy is beautiful!
@DownWithDonald2 @Msb00mbastick Ok now we see you must be an msnbc lover because you just repeated the headline of evry show on MSNBC - do your self a favor read forbes and let them tell you his net worth also take a drive down the west side highway Trump is on every building oh and he did win the presidency
@BlueWave2020NY @tedlieu @KamalaHarris I did I have watched her speak for a while - again very intelligent and eloquent - Just not inspiring kind of boring actually - if you listen to the words she really did not say much - I don't think she will inspire progressives  like Bernie or even warren for that matter -
@Msb00mbastick Obviously you don't understand how government works t- hey never had the votes for the wall even before Pelosi - he is creating a situation where he can declare an emergency and work through the court system - The guy is very smart he plays the long game - see muslim ban success
@tedlieu @KamalaHarris Nice person intelligent but not an inspiring speaker seems like media likes her but it wont be enough to get her through the primary.
@Msb00mbastick Its not a trump bubble she knows he is doing everything to build the wall - It was responsible  to stop the shut down when he did - he has kept his promoises more than any other president - look at the economy I am sure Ann RHINO Coulter is enjoying the tax cut he gave her -
@Msb00mbastick She is a never trumper just like the rest Billy Kristol et al she wants attention from the left wing media to stay relevant it is so obvious but who needs her - She does not speak for the base POTUS does.  I will say it again she will be dining with Anna Navaro  who needs her!
@AnnCoulter Now that you are a never trumper i bet you will be a guest host on morning joe with mika - what a joke you will do anything to stay relevant- u should be embarrassed
@AnnCoulter Ann rhino Coulter
@RWPUSA She was always a never trumper pretending to be a supporter once he won
@AnnCoulter You started as a never trumper and your true colors are showing just tell the truth you are not a true supporter of potus you will most likely be voting with Hillary and kamala go enjoy brunch with billy Kristol potus does not need you
@USATODAY @AprilDRyan Weak speech
@CNNPolitics @AprilDRyan I am not a Hillary fan but she is a heavyweight the rest of the dem candidates are lightweights

@MeetThePress @chucktodd @marcorubio You can’t invent crimes there is no statute saying you can’t work with wiki leaks this is crazy we live in a democracy Wikileaks is publishing information given to them just like msnbc - if working with wiki leaks is deemed a crime we are now in 3rd world country territory

@mitchellvii So true
@JRubinBlogger Oh my god you said something positive about the administration look out lightning may strike
@jeffgiesea This is the best tweet of the day time to lock up mueller and his gang for the bloodless coup
@JoyAnnReid Another trump slayer joy will wave the banner of anyone opposing trump and many of them have ended up in the trash heap she will be no different sorry joy your savior is a false prophet trump will win in 2020
@brianstelter Now BRIAN this is an excellent report no indemic trump hating if you continue this you may be up for an emmy
@cmdrPorkchop @Countryshow2 @EliLake @BretBaier No murder as far as i know and the only charges have process crimes no conspiracy mueller was charged with finding a conspiracy there is still not one charged so i don’t know but his investigation thus far is a complete failure

@Yasminmurai @thehill Yasmin this is all opinion that i don’t necessarily disagree with my issue is how much if at all does it change the climate and there is a true debate regarding same by true scientists not just us you may feel a certain way but i am sorry Yasmin that’s not science
@cmdrPorkchop @Countryshow2 @EliLake @BretBaier I know he was convicted of conspiracy oh wait no he wasn’t no one was a joke time to arrest mueller and his gang
@libtardsnowfla4 @satya_or_bust @thehill Again i don’t mind the little jokes actually funny but do yourself a favor read some opposing scientific conclusions Judith curry richard lindzen and then make up your own conclusion not one that a supposedly 97percent of scientists made for you
@libtardsnowfla4 @satya_or_bust @thehill Whatever but you see the point scientific consensus does not always equal fact
@satya_or_bust @libtardsnowfla4 @thehill I am but that’s beside the point the real issue is the debate within the scientific community that is not being reported
@Yasminmurai @thehill That’s an opinion not a fact indeed there is a debate among climate scientists as to the nature and degree of anthropogenic change read Judith curry and others it’s important
@libtardsnowfla4 @satya_or_bust @thehill Libtard there is climate change the debate in the scientific community between true climate scientists is the nature and degree of anthropogenic change the disagreement is serious in the scientific community but the media will not report it
@satya_or_bust @shrimpocat @thehill I don’t care what i sound like but thanks for the compliment actually the concensus in science  in the past was that the earth was flat there were only a few skeptics that changed opinions based on facts sound familiar??
@satya_or_bust @libtardsnowfla4 @thehill During newtonsvtimevthere was scientific consensus that the earth was flat - do you believe in that consensus? Science hardly has a consensus especially initially. Climate science is in the early stages use some skepticism it will make you feel good
@shrimpocat @satya_or_bust @thehill Smirky you are the smartest person on this thread😀
@cmdrPorkchop @EliLake @BretBaier I will say it again best economy in decades, lowest unemployment in decades highest gdp growth in years lowest unemployment for blacks, Hispanics, wages increasing, troops coming home - i am enjoying winning how about you!
@DarthContinent @mitchellvii He continues to be underestimated to me which is amazing when he is worth billions and win the presidency but this is his strength being underestimated
@libtardsnowfla4 @satya_or_bust @thehill Dude anytime you see 99.7 of all academic studies agree run the other way because they either aren’t scientific or they are most likely not true read some opposing scientific opinions use your brain don’t follow the heard you will feel free and may learn something
@satya_or_bust @shrimpocat @thehill No token it’s about facts my man open up and read from one of the top climate scientists in the world Judith curry you may be enlightened
@satya_or_bust @shrimpocat @thehill I don’t know - done pretty well so far - read Judith curry and richard lindzen two prominent climate scientists who are skeptical and there are many more - science is not about percentage and concensus it is about fact now is time for the facts to come out
@EliLake @BretBaier I agree mueller is out of control time to arrest him and his gang!!!!
RT @charliekirk11: Breaking:		Texas says it found 95,000 non-citizens on voter rolls; 58,000 have voted		And the left says there is no vote…
@CNN @ProudResister CNN was tipped off by mueller
@satya_or_bust @shrimpocat @thehill I was taught in law school that if you see the word concensus it means anything but — especially in science any way look up and read Judith curry one of the leading climate scientists in the world she is skeptical but you would rather believe a 16 year old
@shrimpocat Smirky you are so right this guy makes millions off the system and then complains about the system that made him rich typical liberal i can be rich but no one else can
@satya_or_bust @thehill Go ahead let this 16 year old lead you to the promise land i will take an adult scientist any day but this just me have her call me when she finishes geometry
@bradheath And none of it deals with conspiracy or collusion- a joke time to arrest mueller and his gang
@thehill This is the problem with the left they continuously say how they believe in science and then take the word of a 16 year old who has not yet taking algebra over real scientists- unbelievable
RT @politico: The nation’s biggest swing state looks even more like Trump Country heading into 2020 https://t.co/iXqjt2yBsB
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Your right chuck now it’s time to declare an emergency and build the wall
@mitchellvii They need to revamp the entire athletic program
@mitchellvii Totally agree he always has a default plan very smart man
@NatashaBertrand @MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @charlie_savage Compelling tv congrats i thought it was very good
@JoyceWhiteVance Nice try he doesn’t have the evidence or he would have charged conspiracy
@Weentuguyuk69 @RWPUSA @CNN Funny - but it’s clear you have brought into the left wing narrative that all republicans are racist - same old narrative and it’s why dems lost the presidential election and why they will lose again
@andersonDrLJA Exactly these traitors are so intent on taking down a duly elected president that they are not doing their jobs and catching real criminals time to arrest mueller and his gang for trying to overturn a duly elected president
@Weentuguyuk69 @RWPUSA @CNN Read the constitution- and as Hillary said “are you ready to accept the results of the election” i guess you have not. Also the warriors will all go bankrupt anyway should have graduated
@neeratanden I think we have been taking a page out of Hillary supporters play book
@RWPUSA @CNN Just what the left wants to overturn a duly elected president it just shows you can’t and the warriors can’t accept the will of the people too bad we have one president and his name is Trump warriors should return to dribbling basketballs most of them did not graduate anyway
@chrislhayes @NathanLerner Your supposed to have some semblance of being a serious news person these types of tweets don’t help your cause
@AnnCoulter Coulter = trump hater you now officially have trump derangement syndrome
@InnaMidwest @dmaxter1200 @mitchellvii Mueller should be locked up for the bloodless coup he is leading
@danpfeiffer Another guy waisting his money - no chance he makes it through the primary
@InnaMidwest @dmaxter1200 @mitchellvii Doubtful but if they do it will be for some made up process crime the mueller and his gang invented i think it is time to say it about mueller- lock him up lock him up lock him up
@InnaMidwest @dmaxter1200 @mitchellvii You probably want to see baron arrested too i bet mueller by the end of this charges baron about lying about his homework
@InnaMidwest @dmaxter1200 @mitchellvii Not one American indicted for the underlying conspiracy charge he is ruining people’s lives because trump won he is a joke and a threat to democracy trump should fire him Monday morning and lock him and his gang up Monday afternoon
@mitchellvii Time to put mueller and his gang in handcuffs for the illegal actions they have taken against the president
@seanmdav Query this- there were more FBI agents and swat team members involved in taking down stone than there were marines taking down bin laden during the raid -again time to arrest mueller and his gang for this bloodless coup!
@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 Again BRIAN you don’t understand because you are a trump hater and you view everything through that lens his supporters view this as the president fighting for what’s right so it is not alternative reality just looking through a different lens
@RealJamesWoods @Ray17278912 Hang in there ray life is too important there are many places to get help let me know how we can help
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Clapper is a joke and should b in jail for perjury
@kurteichenwald And so now Kurt is the ultimate judge be careful my friend those who live in glass houses also you know what the Bible says about judging- you may actually meet satan before stone
@maggieNYT Mueller and his gang need to be arrested for the bloodless coup
@JoyceWhiteVance There is no collusion with Russia of course the media and mueller are now equating wiki leaks with Russia how crazy if there was collusion stone would have been charged with same he was not
@dmaxter1200 @InnaMidwest @mitchellvii Too funny mueller still felt the need to bring the army when right down the street the biggest drug deal is happening mueller is a joke
@JoyceWhiteVance This is a joke when will the left accept that Hillary loss how may lives do they have to ruin unbelievable
@barnaby8787 @sir_blacula @mitchellvii Whatever they do because it is immigration he has wide discretion and the court will give him deference I am not sure they will agree with him but he will get deference see the musilm ban opinioins for reference
@KamalaHarris Mueller and his gang should be arrested for their bloodless coup
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber He did not charge stone with the underlying conspiracy a good reporter would ask why just maybe because there is no real evidence of a conspiracy
@MSNBC @HardballChris Pelosi is viewed by the left as the new dragon slayer the new “hero who will bring down trump” she will fail just like all of the others who underestimate him and his supporters
@HardballChris And what does that mean Chris that the Russians were involved give me a break with the conspiracy theories
@mitchellvii It shows how political this all really is time to arrest mueller and his gang and end this bloodless coup
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes but he won the senate which is turning out to be most important to stop impeachment
@barnaby8787 @sir_blacula @mitchellvii Well see what the courts do
@barnaby8787 @sir_blacula @mitchellvii Temporarily they don’t have permanent protection hence the daca negotiations last week not sure but potus has great discretion in declaring a national emergency and usually courts will not substitute their judgement for executive discretion
@TeaPainUSA @LindseyGrahamSC This is the first round he will declare an emergency
@mitchellvii Tell them bill speak the truth my man
@Lawrence I guess you could say the same about the wall for Democrats why did you vote for a wall twice before voting against it
@barnaby8787 @mitchellvii Does not have to do it when emergency takes place can wait for congress to act he is smart he can now say emergency and congress failed to act so now i must very smart we call it laying a foundation
@barnaby8787 @sir_blacula @mitchellvii That’s what you guys said about Muslim he won that - smarter than you think
@CurmudgeonCD21 @mitchellreports @RepAdamSchiff It’s been a great ride so far best economy in decades
@clark_clark21 @RepAdamSchiff Behind the bars for what some process crime that has nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy using swat to arrest stone this mueller guy is a joke and should be put behind bars for what he is doing - shameful
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Not factual as usual you will blame trump and declare pelosi the dragon slayer blah blah so predictable trump can still declare an emergency and pelosi loses her chance at daca etc this has put her in a weaker position but you won’t report it as it does not fit your narrative
@sahilkapur Economy is excellent, troops are coming home best economy in decades
@PeterAlexander He gave the Democrats a chance to get a deal and he is giving them one more shot or he will declare an emergency and then dems would have lost the chance in daca he wins in the end
@McClellanRobert Please mueller did it for show this guy mueller is dangerous and needs to be arrested for starting this bloodless coup
@McFaul Let them it’s a bad investment
@abbydphillip No emergencies can be on going
@RichLowry @JackPosobiec Correct but it does not fit a media narrative
@mitchellvii Agreed my friend - he fought like hell and will declare an emergency for wall in the end economy is awesome potus is doing a great job!!!
@EdwardGLuce Every time something happens the left always cries worst day ever for trump his support is a lot more complex than you understand his supporters are mostly happy he fought look for an emergency declaration for the wall pelosi just blew a chance for daca protection who owns who
@AriMelber Temporary my friend potus still has options like any good negotiater there is more than 1 way to skin the cat look for an emergency declaration and oh the Democrats just blew their chance on DAca protection
@RepAdamSchiff It’s two sided shiff until you realize this things will never change but i agree this should be the last one as this will hopefully also b the last special counsel as mueller has done more damage to this country than any shut down ever could
@CurmudgeonCD21 @mitchellreports @RepAdamSchiff Nice try the process crimes they are charged with don’t necessarily equate to the underlying charge of collusion and conspiracy i will say it again if mueller had any of them on the underlying charge he would have charged them - WITCH-HUNT
@tribelaw @JRubinBlogger Same echo chamber Rubin tribe et al have wanted to impeach trump the minute he was inaugurated
@JRubinBlogger I will say it again not one American has been charged with the underlying crime of conspiracy or collusion dealing with the 2016 campaign mueller has no case regarding the material allegations
@NBCPolitics Shut down will end today
@ananavarro @AlCardenasFL_DC How can you be happy when someone - anyone is indicted regardless of what they said about you - a shame this hate you harbor is part of a larger problem forgiveness brings peace - hatred breeds conflict
@KamalaHarris Vote for the wall and it’s over
@ProudResister Nice try- there have been no indictments of any Americans for treason, collusion or conspiracy for the 2016 campaign not one
@AprilDRyan @AURNOnline @gloverpres @akasorority1908 @SenKamalaHarris @TSUedu April you are in the press and supposed to be objective i hope you ask the hard questions like a true journalist and don’t just sit in a corner and route for kamala
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Agreed time to arrest mueller and his gang for this bloodless coup
@mitchellreports @KenDilanianNBC Andrea you are conflating the facts there is absolutely no evidence that wiki leaks stole anything at worst they received information and published it much like msnbc or any other news organization
@CurmudgeonCD21 @mitchellreports @RepAdamSchiff Please point to me the one American indicted for collusion or conspiracy related to the 2016 campaign———0 —— there is none—- WITCH-HUNT
@brianstelter They were tipped off no one is that prescient-
@thehill This is mueller showboating - what a joke he is a swat team really? Time to end Mueller’s bloodless coup - arrest mueller and his gang
@mitchellreports @RepAdamSchiff Nevertheless know one has been charged with conspiracy or collusion time to end Mueller’s bloodless coup
@jimsciutto Jim it is not criminal for the campaign to ask what other info is out there otherwise stone would have been charged with an underlying crime besides lying and obstruction
@mitchellvii Of course you are right but the media won’t report it it does not fit their narrative
@TeaPainUSA Even if he was it is not a crime - stone is not charged with contacting wiki leaks educate yourself

@MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr Michael i think you have your own issues to worry about let’s see bankruptcy- comingly funds assault and battery need we go on?
@RealJamesWoods You speak the truth james
@brianstelter @seanmdav Come on BRIAN this is so obvious mueller leaks - how could cnn possibly know this without a leak shows the witch-hunt is political- time to arrest mueller for the bloodless coup
@mj_lee @greta Because this is a political assasination a bloodess coup and mueller and his team need to be arrested end the witch-hunt
@seanmdav I know the biggest fake news going is that mueller does not leak he is just as political as anyone in dc
@JRubinBlogger Wrong again !! As usual. How about this -shutdown ends the only indictments are lying and obstruction -economy continues to grow trump re-elected!!
@JoyceWhiteVance This is fake hysteria the i just flew through Philly and Miami things are running smoothly the facts don’t fit the narrative
@tedlieu @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Ted that conduct is not criminal otherwise he would have charged stone with an underlying crime beside obstruction and lying
@JRubinBlogger I don’t know but at least according to the indictment the conduct is not criminal because he did not charge stone with anything but lying and obstruction- witch hunt
@AriMelber Ari we don’t agree on much but i thought that was excellent tv and great journalism you personified the Russian investigation and let people see for better or worse there are real consequences excellent job!
@JoyAnnReid That’s funny i would love to hear the same from dems
@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence Ted he is not stupid if he reopens government there is no leverage Congress will only act with pressure he knows that
@Jesus_was_a_Lib @USNavyMomPA Remember democrats can vote to open government too this is two sided the tweet shows that regardless of facts this guy is a trump hater
@Lawrence Democrats could do the same thing by simply voting for a wall that they agreed to in prior votes
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sorry ted don’t get too happy he still wins in 2020
@seanhannity Yes at a rally it would be amazing!!
@JoeNBC You still don’t understand this does not affect trump he needs the base and the base says build the wall simple political calculation for him he is doing the right thing politically and for the country short term pain long term gain joe he is playing for the entire game
@MalcolmNance His return on hours worked is amazing tho - billionaire and then president he must be doing something right Malcolm
@MSNBC @AriMelber He is doing something right look at the economy Ari
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump He is so right Stephanie why should he go to such an elitist conference where people pontificate about saving the world and nothing gets done. - a joke - he is right it is a  waste of taxpayer time and money.

@secupp S. E. Be independent don’t follow the mob and don’t think you have to promote a narrative and this would never of happened
@RepAdamSchiff Build the wall Adam
@JoeNBC He will win again
@JRubinBlogger Maybe to compromise and end the shutdown, put people back to work
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Sure does - the media hysteria over Russia and impeachment is causing a credibility crisis in the media this period may go down as a dark period for the media history will not be kind
@joshrogin Josh how do you know? Again you are promoting a narrative you want to believe besides restating what some reporter said did you do your own investigation- if not just lazy

@brianstelter @ChrisCuomo Stop BRIAN you are now crossing the line from reporting to promoting a narrative with no facts unbelievable your zeal to bring down trump is ruining the press
@jaketapper Please your embarrassing yourself mueller took this extraordinary step because the core of the story is baseless and now your trying to keep the narrative alive unbelievable
@larryelder @BuzzFeed It’s unbelievable larry i was watching Anderson cooper and then cuomo they still want accept Mueller’s statements because it does not promote their narrative the media is shameless right now
@jaketapper Jake you are losing whatever credibility you have left some of the older press guys predicted in the zeal to take down trump the press would lose its soul its happening and it’s sad you should not be in a Twitter war with a subject you cover
@matthewamiller @maggieNYT Matt we finally agree on something no way mueller breaks his silence if story was not baseless but watch press still will not believe it because it does not fit the narrative
@BuzzFeedBen @maggieNYT Mueller would not have spoken if he did not think the story was baseless- start promoting facts not narratives
@SuperPrivileged @brianstelter I love watching even with a denial from mueller they can’t let go of the narrative they have too much invested terrible reporting
@KenDilanianNBC the reason mueller came out is because story is baseless he would not have wasted his breath otherwise
@delruky @SuperPrivileged @brianstelter You are so correct proper reporting would be it to run it without verification they promoted it anyway and got burned should be a lesson
@SuperPrivileged @brianstelter Watching coumo now he won’t even accept the denial whatever credibility they have is lost they are trying to promote a narrative not report facts and they just got burned
@SuperPrivileged @brianstelter Does not matter they promoted it as if it was true - absolutely shameful and they still don’t accept the special counsels denial unbelievable
@esaagar @DailyCaller @BuzzFeedBen They will stop at nothing mueller never speaks and specifically denied this story and the media still can’t accept the truth unbelievable
@SykesCharlie More fake new
@brianstelter Brian you and the rest of cnn owe an apology to potus and the American people for this harmful fake news
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce pull your tweet based upon false premise the media owes trump an apology
@JoeNBC Joe you guys ran stories based on this all day you need to apologize to potus
@JoyceWhiteVance Based on who’s testimony Cohen? Please. Cohen has no credibility
@RealJamesWoods Beto is too affected his campaign won’t even get off of the ground
@realDonaldTrump Way to go POTUS also please give your state of the union at a rally!!!
@JoyceWhiteVance @mitchellreports @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Similarly imagine Boehner disinviting Obama from Congress and shutting down Obama ‘s state of the union democrats would be hysterical and there would be calls of racism and xenophobia- who r the hypocrites now
@maggieNYT Maggie you still don’t get him he is in his element he loves this !!
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump You should be happy that now Nancy will stay home and maybe they can negotiate
@RepAdamSchiff Adam you are obsessed with Russia surely there are other issues that demand your attention in Congress that are more important to the American people most Americans don’t care whether this guy is sanctioned or not
@RadioFreeTom Rudy has done an excellent job at muddying  the waters politically - that is his job the real legal strategy is behind the scenes - remember Rudy's job is political and messaging not legal
@brianstelter @benshapiro This is the problem Brian the Times and Washpo and yes CNN and other cable news keep mixing fact and opinion as if they are one in the same. This is the reason people feel comfortable seeking alternative news sources
@AshleyRParker Beto is so affected no way he wins anything
@kylegriffin1 does she speak English ?
@maggieNYT You probably think he is compromised by Putin too -uh oh time to get Mueller to investigate - LOL
@RepAdamSchiff This why they should come home.
@JoeNBC it is not a retreat from the battlefield it is an aknowledgement that our job there is finished and it is time for the troops to come home.  I am convinced that if POTUS said troops should stay you would criticize him for that. Its time to admit Joe you are the resistance!
@MalcolmNance @sarahkendzior Your conspiracies are even better than a tom Clancy novel - too funny Malcolm next you will want to outlaw reading Pushkin!!
@RealJamesWoods I will put the over under at 5% support in the democratic primary if he is lucky
@JRubinBlogger Jennifer continues in her Tom Clancy Novel where everything is Putin and everyone is an agent or asset - how much does the post pay you to come up with fictional conspiracies - too funny
@JoeNBC They have been defeated - but there will be pockets of resistance - it happens if you would report the facts and not just opinion maybe your viewers would be more educated - for example how much land did ISIS lose in the battle? - Whats the status of RaQQA? - Fake News!
@AriMelber Report the facts Ari he said he would follow department regulations
@JoeNBC Just because he declared victory does not mean you won’t see suicide bombers and lone attacks the fact is and you like facts all experts agree isis as a major player is finished
@JoyceWhiteVance No the government is shutdown because Democrats won’t Agree on a wall that they previously voted in favor of on multiple occasions- democrats caused this shutdown
@TheTimMcGraw Great job
@JoeNBC This does not concern potus you should know this by now
@brianstelter @peterbakernyt The press is so shady his denial is pretty clear
@mkraju @maggieNYT He loses leverage if he goes that won’t happen

@JoeNBC What pool are you reading latest polls 30% blame dems on 13% blame republicans
@SRuhle That is because her comments were directed at trump and cable news is all trump all if the time
@JoeNBC Joe this is an outright lie latest poll shows public blames democrats at 30% republicans only 13% a majority blame trump but republicans especially congressional republicans are not being blamed
@JamilSmith @JoyAnnReid @POTUS @JulianCastro This guy has no chance
@RunBeto2020 No chance he will burn out
@selectedwisdom @TheRickWilson That was a joke Clint is not the most intelligent person in the room - first question to ask is why would trump build up the military and give arms to Ukraine against Putin’s interest if he was an agent - the media has gone crazy
@imranzomg The beauty of capitalism and free markets
@KFILE Don’t worry she is a 2 percenter her ceiling in this election is 2 percent and that is if she does everything right

@maddow Most presidents do there are things said in confidence between leaders Obama made that comment
@maggieNYT @JudgeJeanine Who started the investigation oh yes i remember two criminals McCabe and strok the whole thing is a set up
@JoyceWhiteVance This does not apply to government officials come on Joyce
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump derangement syndrome is at a fever pitch can’t find collusion so now trump is a Russian agent next the left and media will say trump’s real name at birth was Vladimir- too funny
@NatashaBertrand @MSNBC This must be the most ludicrous thing i have ever heard fbi was attempting a bloodless coup
@RepAdamSchiff Great now approve money for the wall like the Democrats did in previous years and the shut down will end
@JoyceWhiteVance I guess they are doing great job at disrupting america - lowest unemployment in decades maybe lowest unemploymenet ever for blacks and Hispanics, wages are growing, most manufacturing jobs in a decade, GDP over 3% , tax reform, criminal justice reform and bringing troops home -
@NathanLerner Lowest unemployment in decades.  Highest GDP in a decade.  Lowest unemployment for Hispanics and blacks.  Tax reform.  Criminal justice reform.  More manufacturing jobs in two decades. Wages growing stock market still up 12 percent since his election - great two years!!
@brianstelter build the wall and its over
@maggieNYT Its clear we are in bloodless coup territory the FBI was trying to bring down a legitimate president
@MalcolmNance what about his son baron maybe Mueller should question him too - what a joke the entire inevestigation is an attempt to bring down a legitimate president I would say now we are definiately in bloodless coup territory
@MarkWarner The country economically is doing very well like his business
@JoyceWhiteVance Great point - the media has forgotten this and may be misleading the public
@brianstelter @CNNPR Brian it was the actual station that called you out not just Hannity b truthful
@JoyceWhiteVance Same here bought my wife one too funny
@JoeNBC Joe you are right sealing our fate to reelection in 2020
@MalcolmNance @FoxNews @LouDobbs Oh no Malcolm maybe mueller should investigate
@jaketapper Just saw your show please stop promoting the racist theory that blacks failed to vote for Hillary because of Russian influence blacks did not vote for Hillary because she was a bad candidate the theory your promoting blames blacks - it is racist
@jaketapper Classic!! Did you fact check that Jake?
@SteveRattner No recession yet Steve economic numbers still looking strong
@paulkrugman You seem to change your mind to fit the Democratic narrative
@stuartpstevens Please max stop spreading crazy conspiracy theories until you know the facts - man fort shared the data with someone he had been working with since 2005 why wasn’t this oligarch flagged as Russian intel years ago what a joke - i
@CurtisIngraham1 More conspiracy theories they just keep getting better
@kasie @MalcolmNance Not as bad as what they and your colleagues say about potus on msnbc
@amyklobuchar I think the kavvanaugh hearings had something to do with it the the unhinged character attacks  from his childhood days were shameful
@JoeNBC Joe was always a Democrat
@MalcolmNance just like he won the presidency he will get his deal my friend.
@JoeNBC Obviously joe did not see the latest poll. 33% blame democrats for the shutdown only 7 % blame Republicans Democrats are getting pulled into the mud with POTUS and are starting to get muddy
@SenBlumenthal Come on Richard be factual he shared it with a guy who had been employed by him since 2005 at least report that fact
@SRuhle @ShepNewsTeam @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @POTUS POTUS could say sky is blue and you and trump haters would call him a liar - fact is there are a lot of people who agree with him especially about the border
@JoeNBC did you ever say Obama, Clinton or bush lied - Scarborough = trump derangement syndrome
@NatashaBertrand @nytimes please state facts he gave polling data to something he had been working with since 2005 this conspiracy talk is out of hand
@MichaelAvenatti Calling potus a liar is getting old you liberals need to come up with something different
@JoeNBC Joe wrong again they still hold 2 branches of government  senate and prez a lot of republicans agree with potus
@JoeNBC You are an expert?
@RWPUSA @CNN Sorry Richard to do called Russian spy had been working for manafort since 2005
@JRubinBlogger Of course you could your own trump derangement syndrome echo chamber
@SRuhle Oh the hysteria steph you are good at business but you are not a lawyer  the Russian worked for mama fort since 2005 a fact the media seems to gloss over this does equal collusion or a conspiracy far from it
@brianstelter He is right you have to learn to put aside your personal feelings and be objective Brian you could learn a little something from koepel and Cronkite
@JoyceWhiteVance A lot of hysteria from the left on just about everything he does the public is becoming immune
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Sounds like a hallmark mystery you have been watching too may of them this conspiracy theory has really gone off of the rails - if there was any conspiracy intelligence -not mueller would have found it already - US intelligence has all the information
@JRubinBlogger do you fact check every politician - this is becoming too obsessive for the left and the media and is losing its effect - most people can make up their own minds we don't need the media telling us their version of the truth
RT @Max_Perry17: PHILLY PHILLY!!!!!
@brianstelter Never happen you guys make too much money off of POTUS see Jeff zucker comment in vanity fair
@jpmiddlemass @CapehartJ What’s destructive great economy low unemployment tax reform criminal justice reform if that is destructive i will support it also she is doing an excellent job!!
@JohnJHarwood Agreed especially since some of them are African American but that does not matter to the left
@kurteichenwald Kurt economy seems to be going pretty well - he is going to bring troops home passed criminal justice and tax reform lowest unemployment in decades- your right a national disgrace? Get your facts straight before you tweet
@StevenLHall1 Too much hysteria on this issue relax his real point was that Russia failed and he did not want to repeat the same mistake
@RadioFreeTom @MalcolmNance Tom there will be someone just as qualified put in his place too much hysteria over personal decisions we have a deep bench here
@dandrezner Remnants is the key word my friend they are defeated lost 90% of their territory and countless casualties under POTUS - remnants is the key word

@RealJamesWoods Typical liberal narrative on every issue it is immoral, racist, misogynistic,homophobic it’s not who we are

@kasie @jaketapper kasie you are assuming that the deficit is due to tax reform so much goes into that mix it is a false narrative to blame it in tax reform
@realDonaldTrump Great job prez i am sure the media won’t cover this
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump We don’t disagree here i am merely pointing out that it is continued and increasing under potus
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump Economy is growing at a record pace high gdp wages growing and low unemployment tell your son material always increases as economy grows but to build now - i wish him luck😊
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump Of course there has been growth but there hasn’t been this type of growth until trump either way the economy is growing under trump- must. Fight China farmers pain is temporary and will be rewarded with better trade deal
@brianstelter He is right media is making a big deal of this - The main point Trump was trying to make was well made the Soviet Union and very other nation that fought in Afghanistan failed and we need to get out as soon as possible
@mitchellvii Bill so true my man so true!!

@NatashaBertrand Mulvaney is awesome a Jim Baker type he will go down as  a great chief of staff.
@mitchellvii Bill you are so right the dems will self destruct and the media will help them everything will be about tearing down trump they can’t help themselves
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump Listen people see what they want to see but facts don’t lie the economy is booming right now even according to the Washington Post the economic numbers strongest in decades
@AshaRangappa_ @MalcolmNance Mexico was always political hyperbole trumps supporters understand this it is liberals that are obsessed with Mexico paying for the wall
@kausmickey @AnnCoulter Mickey you are absolutely correct but this is what post and ny times do they use false connections to prove a narrative here they want to show that shutdown is killing people and trump is responsible so ludicrous!!!
@JuddLegum Taxing people more money for failed government programs does not work we are a free market society taxes have been lowered and now unemployment is at its lowest in decades the results are right in front of you
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump My taxes were definitely lowered and i am getting more money in my paycheck military is receiving 2.5% increase so potus was talking about 10% over his 4 years you may not agree with cut but it’s real
@mitchellvii I agree the press ignores it but right now there is a larger chasm in the Democratic Party that will make it impossible for Democrats to govern in the house
@Rainbows2xs @funder @realDonaldTrump Lowest unemployment, wages rising increase in manufacturing jobs gdp over 3% consumer confidence high and he lowered taxes what more do you want
@NPR @nprscottsimon This op ed is what is problem with elites.  funniness is a matter of subjective interpretation not collective acceptance.  What one person deems offensive another person may deem funny and someone else may deem not offensive but also not funny.  Comedy is subjective. Elitism
@brianstelter you also advocated for a delay when Potus speaks -clearly a form of censorship I don't know what it is you media elites don't get about the first amendment - people are adults let them make up their own minds about what is true and what isn't
@funder @realDonaldTrump Scott best economic numbers in decades my friend the shut down is temporary but even his critics agree best economic numbers in a decade enjoy!!
@amjoyshow the # 1 agenda item will be wasting the countries time and money trying to take down trump because that is exactly what 95% of their time will spent on - they cannot help themselves. A real shame!!
@khloekardashian hey headed to Miami on the 24th for my wife's birthday can you recommend a romantic spot for dinner?

@RealJamesWoods So true Democrats now have substituted political correctness for facts -
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross is this what's its come down to how immature -
@NatashaBertrand @amjoyshow @elliotcwilliams @MalcolmNance @MSNBC More conspiracy theories should be fun
@JoyceWhiteVance You and the dems have said he was worried since he got in office no chance he knows the justice department would be foolish to prosecute him over stormy Daniels remember john edwards
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Biden said racist things in the past do you recall he called “Obama a good clean black “ he has also said racist things about Indians and 7 elevens just bringing facts to the table
@ChrisCuomo @brianstelter Chris you are missing the point he enjoys the media scrutiny he uses it to his advantage and it has worked!
@realDonaldTrump I agree prez look at the john Edwards case justice department tried to criminalize this before and failed it is not a crime they are waisting tax payer dollars to try to bring you down keep fighting
@Jaidge @realDonaldTrump JJ what meltdown? it is called a correction again stocks still up at least 6 percent since PoTUS election the economic numbers that came out yesterday are the strongest in decades lowest Hispanic  and black unemployment ever - statistics don't lie - facts are stubborn things
@Jaidge @realDonaldTrump What country are you living in stock market still up 6 percent since election of POTUS best economy in years unemployment all time low - we are anything but a laughing stock my friend we are the worlds envy. GO USA!!!
@realDonaldTrump Great job Prez!! unemployment all time low. Consumer confidence high. GDP highest in years, wages growing, tax reform passed, criminal justice reform passed - a great two years we are behind you!!
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Alarmist !!!!
RT @DineshDSouza: Would they be doing this without pressure from Trump? Obviously not! https://t.co/KDbNwiAYKk
@JRubinBlogger Jennifer did you see todays economic numbers? over 300,000 new jobs more people participating in work force- wages are up lowest Hispanics unemployment in a decade - tell me which one of the above that you do not like - The evidence is clear POTUS doing a great job!!
@SRuhle @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Also do you call Elizabeth Warren a liar on your show for saying she is an Indian - obviously she is not but you would not call her a liar on your show.  This is why Trump won the first time and will win again the press makes him a martyr - did you call Obama a liar or Clinton?
@SRuhle @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Stephanie really do you have to fact check every statement you must call POTUS a liar everyday - your show would be much more interesting if you stopped calling him a liar everyday voters are adults they can make up their own minds - do you fact check every politician?
@MalcolmNance @Plot2Destroy Malcolm you have trump derangement syndrome take two aspirin and call me in the morning -Wow
@RealJamesWoods Enjoy my man I am having a nice cocktail on the east coast at the same time TGIF
@robreiner Built up military - gave much needed military equipment to Ukraine ( something Obama refused to do) oh sounds like a puppet to me - Rob get your facts straight before you post
@joncoopertweets Trump would never do it is is another liberal fantasy he will fight the charges until the end.
@maggieNYT Maggie this is so juvenile to keep comparing what he did when someone is completely wrong.  She was completely wrong here and it is totally out of bounds that a sitting congresswoman or man would make this remark - When something is wrong just call it wrong - it was immature
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Have you watched MSNBC lately - I beg to differ
@RepAdamSchiff You can show leadership by approving the wall that was previously approved by democrats years ago.  A shame playing politics with border security!!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Just approve the wall how hhard is it - oh I know your just appealing to your base - its politics
@maggieNYT And will vote for him again the numbers don’t lie look at the economy and today’s economic numbers Booming!!!
@SteveRattner Wages also increased steve if these were Obama numbers you would be shouting to the moon - please just acknowledge that the trump economy is booming right now
@JRubinBlogger Bill still needs potus signature won’t happen without the wall
@realDonaldTrump Great job prez!! We are behind you keep doing what you are doing!!
@KamalaHarris Kamalawhen you say polluters they are actually employers who employ your constituents look what happened in France and Europe when the green agenda was passed the people revolted the people don't want to be jobless with a high tax burden
@SRuhle lets ee yesterday the democrats voted to impeach, end the electoral college and see POTUS taxes - they will get nothing done this term as they all have trump derangement syndrome that is encouraged by the press - it will one a wasted two years
@maggieNYT Sounds like a national security issue to me
@Morning_Joe The usual cabal of Trump hatters on MSNBConspiracy.  Same arguments about how he is not fit for office, he is not Churchill etc - Ho hum!! but I will watch because it is like a train wreck you just can't take your eyes off of a disaster!!
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Come on Eric you know that bill won't pass the senate or get signed by Prez - don't pat yourself on the back until there is compromise and the bills get through senate and signed by POTUS - compromise Eric Compromise!!!!
@RepAdamSchiff Adam passing laws is fun and it may look like you are doing something but it does not mean didly if it is not going to pass the senate age get signed by president. You must compromise not just try to pass your own agenda - so I still say still nothing passed
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce this is what happens when prosecutors over step their authority and make matters that should be handled by the NSC and intelligence a criminal matter. Mueller's investigation and indictments of Russians should be handled by CIA and NSC not Mueller
@tedlieu Put in money for the wall the bill passes very simple
@RyanLizza @Lawrence Her roll out has been horrible she better clean it up if she wants to continue
@NatashaBertrand @MalcolmNance That’s what defendants have to tell judges in order for the plea to go through
@McFaul @MalcolmNance As i have stated over and over Mueller’s indictments of Russian nationals will have an opposite reaction in Russia - Mueller’s indictments of Russians have made us all less safe
@JoyceWhiteVance Lowest black unemployment in decades
@NatashaBertrand And so it begins as i said previously Russia will counter Mueller’s actions with an opposite reaction Mueller’s indictments of foreign Russian nationals has made us all less safe
@MSNBC Harry Ried was the worst senate leader ever
@MSNBC @TODAYshow Uh oh the New Democratic hero dems are now counting on pelosi to bring down POTUS - no chance Pelosi is weak and will be further weakened by the coming internal democrat struggle for power
@kasie She is not a legal authority that was more of a political statement
@SecPompeo @jairbolsonaro Great job mr secretary keep up the great work!!
@NatashaBertrand @andylassner Too salty
@MSNBC And he lost the presidency also when he was running the press wasn’t so kind he was called a racist by the press
@mccaffreyr3 Generals should also be more respectful of the commander in chief especially generals because they are cognizant of the chain of command sadly some generals have forgotten this recently
@TERA1PATRICK Absolutely stunning
@Morning_Joe How about maybe a trump supporter now and then
@JoyceWhiteVance Be careful what you wish for Joyce Hillary wished for trump too
@JoeNBC @marcthiessen All policy differences
@tedlieu @MattWhitaker46 @realDonaldTrump Great question did you stay up all night preparing that one?
@MarkDonnelly16 @JRubinBlogger actually pretty funny
@TERA1PATRICK @Poshmarkapp maybe I should buy for my wife looks beautiful
@TERA1PATRICK @Poshmarkapp pretty
@funder Scott you adding to the polarization
@kylegriffin1 The democrats obsession with tax returns have become a sickness
@dbongino go get em dan!!!!!
@juliaioffe Look we are so narcisstiick in the US right now we do not understand that Russia is a sovereign entity that we don't control.  for every action we have (mueller indictments, sanctions etc) there will be an opposite reaction from Russia, its not rocket science
@Toure Toure you have to admit Warren's roll out has been a disaster
@robreiner Enjoy, your tax break, the low unemployment, over 3% growth, tax reform, criminal justice reform , highest consumer confidence in a decade and yes he is bringing the troops home - still upset?
@JackPosobiec You are right so bizarre her campaign is a hot mess and it just started
@maggieNYT Maggie are you supposed to be an objective reporter or did you just forget that ethical requirement after laughing at Trump when he made the announcement to run for office
@AriMelber Please Ari - his supporters know that having Mexico pay for the wall was political hyperbole just like "you can keep you doctor if you want to" or "I did not have sex with that woman?" his base understands totally just like Clintons base and Obamas base understood them
@tedlieu @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Lieu please name the indictments or convictions Mueller has of Americans that are related to the conspiracy he was charged with investigating --- oh that's right there is zero !!
@rickysnecklace Nice photo!
@ananavarro He is  a porr man's jeff Flake - but ultimately will fall in line and support the POTUS agenda!
@SenKamalaHarris This is abig problem in your home state
@nytimes He is in trouble - wife investigated by the FBI and now Me Too Stick a fork in him Bernie is Burned out!!
@SenKamalaHarris Approve funding for the wall and the shutdown is over
@joncoopertweets @funder @realDonaldTrump I think this is another fantasy by dems and liberals it makes them sleep better at night thinking that the walls are closing in on POTUS - POTUS like chaos and conflict as he said he is not afraid of the storm he is the storm!!
@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump My pay check is already growing with the tax cut!
@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC @maddow @DeadlineWH @BWilliams Making money off of being negative about potus all day everyday- and your proud???
@davidaxelrod @SenWarren Who is running her campaign her roll out has been horrible
@TheBeatWithAri He won the presidency
@ananavarro Too funny but true - Jeff Flake 2.0
@mitchellreports @MaxRose4NY All Potus wants is the Wall with not much funding - the dems are being unreasonable because they don't want to give him a win - Why don't you report that Schumer voted for the Wall in the past - Be fair!
@JRubinBlogger Jeff Flake 2.0
@RWPUSA @gtconway3d @MittRomney He lost Richard and the press demonized him them he was called a racist the only reason they like him now is because he is aginst POTUS - A Joke!
@JRubinBlogger You have never complimented POTUS on anything even his election victory it is clear you root against him everyday - he has leverage he will get the wall built the democrats are going to splinter - you have been wrong at just about every turn - you are wrong again
@TomFitton I. Agree Tom
@EricTrump @kimguilfoyle @LaraLeaTrump Happy new year great photo
@TellMyOwnTruth @RWPUSA You need more than one person or entity to have a conspiracy so far no convictions or pleas regarding same - a joke
@JoyceWhiteVance He will not run for president POTUS still has 85 perf ent support of Republican Party that has to get below 75 percent for anyone to mount a serious challenge
@realDonaldTrump Keep doing what you are doing PREZ great job!!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi Elections do have consequences POTUS ran on the wall for the presidency and WON he is president the wall is part of the agenda
@darylcorbin @jaketapper Spoken like a true liberal who does not like opposing views i know maybe i should be censored- healthy debate is good my friend even if you have to listen to bullshit you don’t agree with
@JackPosobiec Beautiful pic Jack Happy New Year!
@SteveRattner @nytopinion This is so immature - its like comparing who won at recess the real data shows that unemployment is so low that there aren't that many more jobs to create - a good problem to have all data shows POTUS has done well with the economy only a partisan would say differently
@charliekirk11 best tweet of the day!!
@NatashaBertrand Whaaaaat -did he say fact based MSNBconspiracy is anything but fact based the entire channel is dedicated to attacking POTUS 24 hours a day 7 days a week.The only reason the channel has viewers is because  it is about POTUS all of the time so many people making money off of POTUS
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Sorry Ted The general didn,t just disagree with policy he attacked POTUS character - once that happens the general has entered the fray and is now fair game - The general started it and POTUS will end it
RT @mitchellvii: It's ironic that while the #Media paints President Trump as someone who is "always lying," that same President Trump fulfi…
RT @larryelder: Once they started calling the border wall "racist," there's not a lot of room for compromise.		#GovernmentShutdown
@JoyceWhiteVance Joyce you are a lawyer so you understand the constitution there is a lot you disagree with regarding the president but you have to agree he has not been convicted of anything not as a citizen or president yet you and your mSNBC buddies talk as if he has already been convicted -
@jaketapper Jake really who cares what General McChrystal thinks you are only reporting this to divide the nation further it is his personal opinion and really it does not mean much there are over 64 million people at least that support the president we thank the general for his service
@GOPChairwoman @AnnCoulter It really is insane sanctuary cities are basically acts of treason
@FLOTUS Happy New Year Flotus!!
@washingtonpost I will say it again as Muller try to make spy conduct criminal Russia will respond accordingly Mueller's actions will have an opposite reaction
@TellMyOwnTruth @RWPUSA I am a lawyer - the fact is liberals keep arguing the amount of convictions - my only point is that there have been absolutely no convictions dealing with collusion or conspiracy relating to the 2016 election - You have conceded same in your tweet
@CapehartJ This is because media outlets such as msnbhysteria are obsessed with Donald Trump and forget the real news
@NatashaBertrand @mayawiley @kwelkernbc @MSNBC same great way to start the new year !!
@MalcolmNance He did not fail at running for president
@SRuhle It should be acknowledged that he is a very shrewd individual and knows people well - his biggest strength is that he is continuously underestimated this is why he will win again in 2020
@MalcolmNance more hysteria ho hum
@RWPUSA What about the lie about her heritage oh i am sorry she is a liberal they don’t lie - a total joke
RT @WhiteHouse: 2018 has been a year of historic accomplishments! https://t.co/6Iq5CFVdwY
@JRubinBlogger No chance - she will not make it through the primary - she wont be able to raise enough money
@funder @realDonaldTrump President
@TellMyOwnTruth @RWPUSA Oh I am sorry where is the conviction on collusion which is the reason he was appointed - Oh I remember there is none! again Mueller is a joke!!
@JohnBrennan @MalcolmNance John - lowest unemployment in years - highest growth in years, lowest taxes in years. making our allies pay their fare share - bringing our troops home something you failed to do - oh and yes 85 percent approval from republicans - I would say as a leader he is doing pretty well
@robreiner @MalcolmNance Rob I remind you that the only way to get him out of the whitehouse is to beat him in an election - I don't think the democrats can do it - Trump will win in 2020 -oh by the way - low taxes high growth lowest unemployement in years - still unhappy?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I think you may be correct - The browns have a good QB and momentum for next year.  If I were a betting man I would put my money on it - but I am not
@justinsink This will be the new liberal obsession maybe you should get Mueller to investigate
@CapehartJ @MitchLandrieu Another candidate with no chance
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted you have trump derangement syndrome take two aspirin and call me in the morning when your obsession with POTUS ends.
@funder no funding for the wall then it wont pass very simple
@ananavarro Ana it is called political hyperbole, every politician does it remember "you can keep your doctor if you want to" "read my lips no new taxes" "I did not have sex with that woman" I could go on  most people understand the point he was making - you must be condemning all politician
@funder What's he complicit for - and what blame? low unemployment, high gdp growth lower taxes - oh wow lock him up - please the left hates trump so much they don't even no what there mad at.  A JOKE!!!
@JackPosobiec Jack you are correct no chance for her
@maggieNYT Mueller s actions will have an opposite reaction
@JuddApatow Judd they are jokes - they are not meant to be serious.  Please look back at the history of comedy Richard pryor, Goerge Carlin etc - not all comedy has to fit your agenda and be politically correct  - by the way the show was sold out !! congrats Louis!
@DineshDSouza Dinesh you are so correct the liberals only like science when it agrees with their narrative this truly is pathetic letting a male call himself a girl wrestle in the girls tournament and win and then have everyone say there is no physical advantage - craziness
@JackPosobiec Mueller's actions have an opposite reaction - there will be more reactions to Mueller's conduct
@FinancialTimes She has no chance
@NBCNews There are a lot more things happening in the world that people should be worried about.
@funder Lowest unemployement, highest growth - strong consumer confidence, dealing with North korea china and Russia - making allies pay their fare share - sounds pretty legitimate to me -
@IngrahamAngle @ABC @RollingStone so true Laura and what is the purpose of this interview anyway - the hysterical elite media will faun over anyone and everyone who critizes trump it is just pathetic
@CapehartJ He is right Jonathan no one on MSNBHYSTERIA will ever say anything positive about the president - but what the elite media does not understand is that it makes his base stronger - so say pit party all you like but just like Maggie Habberman you will be having your own pity party
@BernardKerik So true this will go down as the biggest charade in US History
@RealCandaceO @SenWarren Love this!!
@realDonaldTrump So true Prez so true keep doing what your doing we are behind you!!!
@nytimes If the New York Times would just report the facts instead of trying to bring the president down then maybe the culture will change but until then trump understands that washpo and nyt exist now to bring down his presidency
@MSNBC This just shows his ignorance why even give this guy any publicity
@BernardKerik @HillaryClinton Agreed this this general would have never been asked to be in the administration anyway who cares what his personal opinion is 85 percent of republicans disagree with this liberal general
@craigunger @WIRED This is the most ill informed tweet of the year - Craig do you really want to regulate free speech and are you still holding on to that myth that Russia propaganda got trump elected? Your tweet is more dangerous than anything the Russians have done free speech - fair election

@RealJamesWoods You are awesome!!
@RWPUSA Richard you need help trump derangement syndrome has really taken its toll on you
@RealJamesWoods Democrats are still having a difficult time accepting that trump is president
@ananavarro @MalcolmNance Even though we don’t agree on a lot i appreciate you!! Happy birthday!!!
@RWPUSA Richard there has not been one conviction or plea related to collusion or conspiracy with Russia this is a witch hunt plain and simple
@Lawrence She thinks everything is racist
@RWPUSA According to who? Really will you feel this way when he fails to find that the president colluded with Russia mueller is hurting our democracy and hopefully will be the last special counsel in our history
@maggieNYT Lowest unemployment in decades, strongest growth in decades removing the troops from conflict, i guess Kelly was right- 😀
@MalcolmNance Malcolm please where was your false hysteria when migrants died in federal custody during the Obama administration??
@ananavarro please Ana just declare yourself a Democrat already
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Note to Ted you did not win the senate and there is still a republican in the whitehouse good luck getting your agenda passed😀
@mitchellreports @LindseyGrahamSC @DanaBashCNN @realDonaldTrump Andrea he should follow his instinct here the tendency of the generals is to keep America in some type of conflict now that you look back on history don’t you wish George W Bush would have disregarded the advice of the generals and not started the Iraq war?
@funder What a joke!! How many more investigations do you want next Congress will be investigating his son Baron this is exactly why trump will win in 2020 democrats will overplay their hand
@maggieNYT Maggie where was your reporting during the Obama administration when migrants died in federal custody?
@yashar Best tweet of the day!! You are so right!!!
@RepAdamSchiff Sure mr Schiff should we also replay the Democrats supporting a border wall in 2006 and 2009?
@craigmelvin Saw excerpts of your interview with President Clinton you did an amazing Job! what a compelling interview! congrats!
@funder Yes Scott and all those things are terrible but that was not the conduct that lead to his conviction regardless of what you think of him or his politics look at the facts of his prosecution and you will see it was political in nature and should not have happened
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Ted look at the tape he said it was on his mind -he did not say he fired him because of Russia abig difference in a court of law.
@Morning_Joe Steve you need help or a support group for your trump fever.  It was not the administrations fault if you know anything about PR which you probably have never been there the infrastructure is like a third world country - get your facts straight before you criticize
@amjoyshow @TPM Oh my god Joy this was such apolitical prosecution - he deserves to be pardoned name me one person who was prosecuted recently for the same behavior!! This is what the pardon is for
@SRuhle Stephanie now that is too funny!!!
@KimKardashian Great job Kim!
@JoeNBC @ABC @Disney Should MSNBC also do the right thing regarding Joy Reid's anti gay tweets?
@HardballChris Chris Country is doing well under trump- what is it you don't like low unemployment- better relations with North Korea a growing economy - you making more money because of the tax cut? Please tell me what he robbed us of
@Morning_Joe Maybe Mueller should investigate and expand his investigation even more- please nothing to see here if you understand policy ZTE is part of a broader negotiation
@ananavarro I am surprised you did not blame trump
@matthewjdowd @JoyAnnReid This is the miscalculation that was made during the campaign - His support if you track all the polls is around 45-46% - where it was during the election - If no collusion is found that number will increase he will be difficult to beat in 2020
@maggieNYT @GrahamBlog Maggie the problem here is there needs to be some evidence for the public to believe it is plausible. Despite what mainstream media thinks the public is not stupid. Confidential informants - rogue FBI agents and a politicized Comey adds to the narrative - seems plausible
@RNicholasBurns @mitchellreports Respectfully here I disagree i think being erratic and unpredictable has actually made Kim come to the table but I do understand your point its a good one
@JoyAnnReid He is a billionaire confirmed by Forbes he is also President

@amjoyshow @AmandiOnAir This guy is a piece of work not only did he say that the President is illegitimate (constitutionally not true) he then said he believes Rudy Guiliani will be indicted - Too funny people will say anything to get on TV even if shows complete ignorance
@amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC Joy you and I disagree on a lot but I have to say I think you are very bright and your show is fun to watch even though I disagree 95% of the time.
@amjoyshow @MichaelAvenatti This guys 15 minutes are just about up the only thing that will keep him in the news is his questionable history that keeps dripping out day by day by day
@amjoyshow the convictions have nothing to do with Collusion thats why the public does not care
@K_JeanPierre a figure of speech used in historical references
@amjoyshow @DonteStallworth Here I agree with you Joy that is healthy productive activism but kneeling at a game is counterproductive
@PreetBharara @JoyAnnReid @yashar I don't know Preet maybe Mueller should expand his investigation into this too he has expanded it evrywherelese
@RealJamesWoods so true - so true
@RealJamesWoods Thats what I am talking about!!
@AriMelber you might enjoy it
@maggieNYT He is right with for the IG report it will be damning but I am sure you and the press will spin it differently

RT @RealJamesWoods: #FlashbackFriday https://t.co/jI5QUxeYYv
@amjoyshow @nickakerman Akerman continue to conflate the indictments with collusion - None of the pleas had anything to do with collusion - He knows this but can't or won't say it. There have been absolutely no guilty pleas with anything remotely to do with Conspiracy or Collusion. #WitchHunt
@amjoyshow @LawProfButler Professor Butler has still not accepted that Hillary lost.  Holding on to Collusion to end this presidency is not accepting reality.
@amjoyshow @K_JeanPierre Wrong a lot of this has been litigated in the last presidential election and the Republican policies won. The economy continues to improve - Lowest unemployment in 20 years - #MAGA
@amjoyshow @staceyabrams Not a big fan of her politics but I give her a great deal of credit Congrats Stacy!
@CNNPolitics Will Cnn and other mainstream media ask Mr Biden the real hard questions about his prior racist statements about Indians and African Americans? Stay Tuned
@SRuhle Is Stephanie actually giving the President Credit? Wow I don't think she has ever said anything positive about the President
@realDonaldTrump Agree 100%
@amjoyshow @SageRosenfels18 This was going on before Trump - The NFL Owners finally took the proper stand on this issue
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance Malcolm gets paid to spew anti trump venom - it is almost comical. The fact is a deal with North Korea will be good for the world for generations to come regardless of how much Malcolm and or Joy hate Trump
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Just like they can't accept that Trump won the liberals like Ari and Adam Schiff will never accept that there is no collision - even if Mueller finds zero evidence of same.  Do you really think Schiff would care about this if Trump lost?
@MeetThePress @Yamiche Has nothing to do with Race it has to do with business- Liberals are now trying to ruin football - If the players want to protest do it on their own time not their employers - this is crazy #justplayfootball
RT @realDonaldTrump: “Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a…
@amjoyshow @NBCNews As I said before - she has got issues!
@hardball @HardballChris Please Chris stop with the liberal hysteria -the NFL is a private organization the players are paid a lot of money if they want to protest they should leaven the NFL and join a social protest movement
@amjoyshow @NBCNews #just playootball
@amjoyshow @NBCNewsTHINK Devin Nunes is doing Gods work! He is exposing the true conspiracy against the President
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Stephanie unfortunately blaming donald trump and ivanka is just irresponsible.  No law absent taking away all guns will protect the children unless we change the culture provide more assistance for mentally impaired especially children and provide more security instead you blame
@CNNPolitics I wonder if CNN will ask him about his past comments regarding blacks and indians - probably not
@JoyAnnReid Rachels got some issues
@HardballChris Sorry again CHRIS the conduct of Comey, Strock, Mccabe and Brennan et al has hurt the FBI and other institutions.  This conduct will be exposed in IG report stay tuned
@MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump Please when will you accept that Hillary lost!
@MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid Isn't Clapper the guy that lied before congress?
@Morning_Joe @NYCMayor tell the Mayor the NFL is a private institution and is permitted to pass this policy banning players from taking a knee he needs to understand the difference between public and private institutions
@rpbp @JoyAnnReid it will be overturned on appeal
@CNNPolitics SoorryClapper the optics don't look good - opposing party sending in a      ci to opposing party's presidential campaign looks bad
@HardballChris SorryChris FBI already destroyed it
@Morning_Joe oh my god no avanatti what is the world coming to(lol)
@VP @POTUS Excellent!!!!
@JoeNBC @NRO Please the only reason they followed through on this is because he beat Hillary. if he lost Russia would be a footnote.
RT @MSNBC: "I mean you can ask for an investigation, I can ask for an investigation, doesn’t mean the FBI has to do it ... I don’t think th…
@JoyceWhiteVance @maddow Remember Joyce he is obtaining evidence from a counter intelligence investigation not a criminal one you are conflating the two.
@JohnBrennan CIA hacking into Senate computers at an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations, the intelligence chief responded that “nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn’t do that. I mean, that’s just beyond the – you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we -
@PreetBharara @morningmika Press you of all people should know Rudi is now a defense attorney.  His obligation under the cannon of this is to represent his client not the FBI or DOJ he is now adverse to them both.  He is doing his job!
@amjoyshow @MichaelAvenatti To Michael Avenatti: Have you looked at the polls - No one Cares about Stormy!
@Morning_Joe @MaxBoot its official morning joe is now jumping from Russia interference to Saudi interference and has everyone in the trump campaign convicted of treason.  Answer me this morning Joe - Did Hillary's campaign receive help from a foreign national David Steele - How is this different?
@realDonaldTrump Mr President Another sign Tax Cuts are working in Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania Utility Commission ordered a 320 million dollar reduction to all utility bills due to the awesome tax cut,  All Pennsylvanians will benefit Keep up the good work #MAGA
@amjoyshow @NBCNews Great american saved a lot of lives will be a great director!!
@Morning_Joe @SenBlumenthal Isn't Blumenthal the guy who said he served in Vietnam and did not? Just asking
@Morning_Joe @MichaelAvenatti Morining joe is now morning Avenatti he is on the show more than Joe LOL
@Morning_Joe Maybe you should have on avenati for the 100 th time
@davidaxelrod Too much negativity you should be pulling for our country to be successful not for the president to fail
@Morning_Joe We will have to wait and see Ryan however as speaker has to lead republicans not an msnbc narrative so in this regard the statement had to be made
@amjoyshow Those techniques saved thousands of American lives #bgrateful!!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @FoxBusiness Great job Prez!!
@amjoyshow This dude will say anything bad about the president love watching am conspiracy biggest joke on tv
@Morning_Joe You should change the shows name to morning Avenati what a joke
