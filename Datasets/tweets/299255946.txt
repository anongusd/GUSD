Terry Holcombe readdressed a number of REAC issues at @NAHMAtweet today. We covered a lot of this last October: https://t.co/irg0uwZLfx
To avoid duplication of deficiencies in cause and effect damages, inspectors are recording the most severe deficiency.
If a certified inspector doesn't inspect 25 properties in a year but is just consulting, @HUDgov will decertify them.
Let’s talk about your strategic plan. https://t.co/IoXMPj0x5k https://t.co/QCyRSzQQvO
PUBLIC HEALTH ALERT: Did You Get Bit By A Lyme-Infested Tick? Here's What To Do https://t.co/OyW0tmxVHS
@HUDgov has decertified 56 REAC inspectors in the last 3 years. They were not inspecting to protocol. Some were "overzealous."
"Industry standards do not add anything to the protocol that wasn't already there." Beware of consultants who suggest NIS repairs.
Nichols also says @HUDgov has a little less than 150 contract inspectors. Ideal #: 200-250. Training courses through December to bolster #'s
Delton Nichols from @HUDgov says they've added 10 new QA inspectors. Still trying to get 16 additional QA inspectors. #AffordableHousing

"Profit is the residue of doing something valuable that is hard." - David Smith from @recap_advisors

Congrats to @RealBenCarson and we look forward to working with him to serve both low-income tenants and the American taxpayer.
Competition is good for landlords, renters &amp; taxpayers; it's good government - why competitive contracting is key. https://t.co/TYMyn9U4kZ
Competitive contracting in Section 8 housing will ensure taxpayer money is spent wisely while we work to address the rental housing crisis.
Today's rental housing crisis - 31 affordable, available units per 100 renters - demands proper administration of low-income housing.
