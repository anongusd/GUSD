"The impact of a cyber attack on an airport is twofold: not only people unable to board planes, but also misinformation being spread quickly, causing panic across an airport." - Jack Potter, CEO #Aviation18
"It's important to build a proper cyber matrix - which is monitored - inside the airport. Always asking ourselves: how can we ensure that everyone who touches our airports are cyber safe?" - Jack Potter, CEO #Aviation18
Q: How do you monitor employees to combat the insider cyber threat?	Jack: "On an annual basis all our employees are trained in cybersecurity &amp; we are continually monitoring activity. It's an evolving, complex issue, which requires an investment in resources." #Aviation18

At #DCA, main runway is open with taxiways cleared/open to the gates. But it will take time for normal airline scheds to resume.
@sbermo thanks for the report.
Flying to NYC? Their airports had a tough night too and got even more snow than DC. Expect numerous canceled flts.
@bcanel The snow stopped falling last night but was very wet/heavy. Snow crews still working. No ETA available for "normal ops."
If you are one of the 100s who spent the night in our terminals, did we live up to your expectations?
Good rule of thumb today is to confirm your flight before coming to the airport. Many AM flts will likely be canceled.
One rwy is cleared at #DCA and #IAD. The overnt focus has been to open up the taxiways which connect rwys to terminals.
LAST #DCA #IAD airport updates for tonight: See http://www.mwaa.com/snow. Will be back on in AM.
One runway has reopened at #IAD #Dulles. Great work by the snow team, which will work throughout the night.
Expect many canceled Thurs AM flights as airlines work to recover their schedule. We will work overnt tonight to get our rwys ready.
Overnight snow team plan is to remove lots of runway and taxiway snow to get ready for Thurs #DCA and #IAD flights.
At #DCA runways remain closed and no more flights are expected in or out tonight.
We know there are some Int'l flights at #Dulles planning to depart tonight and we are working to open a rwy as soon as weather allows.
@Amanda_Lenhart It will be up to the airline whether to go after we safely reopen a runway. No guess on when that will be.
#DCA and #IAD runways CLOSED due to heavy snowfall. Terminals OPEN. Snow plow teams still hard at work.
At #IAD, heavy snowfall rate while we plow rwys. Alternating between having 1 to 2 of our four rwys open at a time.
At #DCA, heavy snowfall rate while we plow our main runway. We had it open for a couple of departures but most flts are canceled.
@krupey @unitedairlines If your plane is not at the gate yet we would be glad to assist if airline makes direct request to airport
@katyaN4G We are plowing the runway at DCA at this time. If your flt is departing it would have to wait till we're done
@katyaN4G Which airline/airport/flight? We are now seeing the heaviest snow of this storm so far.
@krupey are you on that flight? @UnitedAirlines website says it landed recently at DCA.
Snow is coming down fast at #DCA and #IAD, with our snow plows working hard. Airlines have canceled numerous evening flights.
