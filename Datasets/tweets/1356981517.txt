These movies always include a surprise invitation to a ball for these chicks, and someone is always on hand to lend them an old gown that MAGICALLY fits despite age/time/size differences. It‚Äôs like the sisterhood of the traveling ballgown.

First #debatenight¬†is over. All I can say is...at least I can take my dog out to pee now? Oh, and the Mean Girls GIFs were on point!
Real losers of #debatenight are the millions of Americans who work hard and pay into Social Security. The candidates failed to #TakeAStand
Yes, please, let us discuss who has a more presidential temperament...thanks @Richard_Schiff this GIF was made for tonight #debatenight https://t.co/zrXSNJMDrV
Winner of #debatenight seems to be @seanhannity. Congrats on the free publicity dude.
12 minutes remaining. I can hear the Jeopardy theme song playing in the background. C'mon @LesterHoltNBC. Time to #TakeAStand #debatenight
Think we could get Trump some @AARPadvocates branded tissues? Let's find a solution for Social Security AND the sniffles. #TakeAStand
@AARPWest even #pippathepuppy knows that it's time for the candidates to #TakeAStand
Y'all, my dog really has to pee. Can we go ahead and discuss Social Security? For my dog's sake? #TakeAStand #debatenight https://t.co/cU99YY4E5V
60 minutes down. Can we stop talking about @POTUS's birth certificate and start talking about Social Security? #TakeAStand #debatenight
If only the candidates were as passionate about Social Security as they are about each other's personal lives...#TakeAStand #debatenight
I want to know what the candidates will do to make sure the future of Social Security is safe and secure for me #TakeAStand #debatenight
Social Security isn't just important to my grandparents, but also to millennials like me. Now is the time to #TakeAStand #debatenight
Let the candidates and moderators hear from you. Tell them it's time to speak up on Social Security and #TakeAStand #debatenight
Waiting for @washingtonpost and @bpolitics fact checking like...	#debatenight https://t.co/phdHZqlJdw

Leave the drama and catfights for the reality shows and answer the questions that matter to the American people. #TakeAStand #debatenight
It's time to stop the yelling. The candidates need to do their jobs and give us their plans for Social Security. #TakeAStand #Debates2016
Maybe it's time to move on to the issues that really matter and #takeastand on Social Security #askthecandidates #debatenight

Post-9/11 caregivers miss an average of 29 hours of work/month due to caregiving; a $6 bil loss of productivity a year #iheartcaregivers

Sitting down and talking about it is a first step...just wish there was more...importance of keeping the conversation alive #onthetable2016
There's a perceived sense of lack of connection and how that makes us more individualistic and less community focused #OnTheTable2016
Dilemma of wanting to go back to being community focused, but not wanting to go back to boxing people into identities #onthetable2016
Part of the solution is helping people realize the need for empathy #onthetable2016 @tfinu @ChiTrust
Do we need to look at where our individual identities intersect in order to look at what is good for the larger community? #onthetable2016
How do we answer "what is best for the common good" if we're so busy saying "me, me, me"? Is there an adverse effect? #onthetable2016
Do Americans identify themselves in different ways than people of other nationalities? Do we go by work &amp; money first? #onthetable2016
Identity isn't superficial. It doesn't fit into a tweet. 140 characters isn't what identifies a person. You're so much more #OnTheTable2016
Identity is something that can divide us. It's a deep question, and society may not be ready to ask the deep questions. #onthetable2016
What's the value of an identity? Does sharing where you work, where you're from and what you do help you feel known? #onthetable2016
Identity: from exception to accepted #onthetable2016

Be vulnerable and uncomfortable; depend on the assets and talents of others rather than trying to do and be everything #onthetable2016
How do we bridge diversity as a tool for peace and unity on campus, in the city, in the nation? #onthetable2016
Diversity is more than just the color of your skin; it's a puzzle based on pieces of what's inside of you #onthetable2016
Be mindful of the experiences of different people so you can be accessible to different communities and groups of people #onthetable2016
We all come from different homes and bring this sense of diversity to chosen homes, whether it's a university, job, etc #onthetable2016
