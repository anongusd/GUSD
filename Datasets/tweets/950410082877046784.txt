@alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 I completely defend a government shutdown and so does my disabled veteran husband. We put America first and that starts with security at home.

@HouseDemocrats He's not the so called President he's the actual President. Stop raging against everything he does and do your damn job.
@mothconnoissuer @alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 Democrats still dominated Senate, House, and gubernatorial elections for decades afterward Goldwater.  Alabama, for example, didn't elect a Republican governor until 1986. Mississippi didn't elect one until 1991. Georgia didn't elect one until 2002. The switch is an urban legend
@mothconnoissuer @alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 “His stance was based on his view that the act was an intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of states and, second, that the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to do business, or not, with whomever they chose.”
@mothconnoissuer @alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 Goldwater was actually very supportive of civil rights for black Americans, voting for the 1957 and 1960 Civil Rights Acts and even helping to found Arizona's chapter of the NAACP.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump will win since he's willing to stand his ground because he has nothing left to lose the media hates him and the democrats want him dead (literally) @SpeakerPelosi will eventually cave under the pressure. #hideandwatch
@mothconnoissuer @alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 The popularity of Republicans Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 were the real reason for the Republican strength in the south. Reagan in particular with his conservative policy. Racism had nothing to do with it. That is simply a Democratic myth.
Why is @georgesoros allowed to interfere in American politics??  What happen to holding people like him accountable?  #DeepState #GeorgeSorospuppet https://t.co/evf4W09bvx
@WayneDupreeShow Just because we both have vaginas doesnt mean I should support you when you're wrong. Somehow women think we shouldn't be held accountable for our actions while constantly bashing men for theirs. Double standard much @SpeakerPelosi
@alwayslissa @IronDiesel58 @charliekirk11 A total of 21 Democrats in the Senate opposed the Civil Rights Act.  Only one of them, "Dixiecrat" Strom Thurmond, ever became a Republican.  To hide the shame of their past the democrats have created a false narrative about a major party switch that never actually happened
@MsAvaArmstrong @TimPendergrass7 @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately the democrats are good at addressing "women issues" they appeal to our need for complete control over our bodies with things like birth control and abortion. They then convince us we must vote democrat for us to keep these rights.

@realDonaldTrump @OrwellsFarm It's sad to read so many comments from people who want to see OUR President fail. It just shows how uneducated and indoctrinated we've become. As a rule you generally want the President to be successful because when he wins we all win unfortunately we've lost sight of that goal.
