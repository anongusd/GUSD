@KasieDC @RepSeanMaloney No, it is one of the few things happening today that is perfectly logical. Trump didn‚Äôt think he would win, so he was saying good things about Russia so he could build a building in that country after he lost. He didn‚Äôt lose.
@PeterBeinart @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump @CNN @RepAdamSchiff @IlhanMN Huh? I call him CSI Schiff all the time. He is the Barney Fife of Congress. How does Trump talking about about Barney have anything to do with the two racist congress members?
@SenGillibrand @repjohnlewis That was real racism back then. Think about that next time you label someone a racist.
@AOC Did you kiss him, her, or the nonspecific person in orange and purple?
@RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN She is nothing more than a socialistic racist moron, she will not be in congress long. One term. Find a new friend.
@RepJayapal @IlhanMN You forgot to mention she is a racist in her own rights.
@RepAdamSchiff CSI Schiff, we get it. You are playing CSI and if you can‚Äôt get Trump with collusion, your plan is to make him miserable and try to bring down his family, friends, and business. You are colluding with the state of NewYork to do it.
@AOC The leader class in socialist societies do not live like the people the rule. You can continue to live well. It is the rich that need to be fearful. You will take their money, give a little to your peeps, and enjoy your life.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump No it will not, change the law if you don‚Äôt like it. Stop acting like a dumb ass.
@RepPressley @Ilhan I guess it is not such a good idea to be a racist in public, in congress. She should probably stop that shit.
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Right again, she is a buffoon.
@SheriffClarke @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump You are exactly right, Sharpton and others like him have turned racism into a economic industry. There is no chance they will accept that racism is simply not what it use to be, it is better today. Much better. Not perfect, not gone, but not nearly what they want us to believe.
@JamilSmith @AOC @RashidaTlaib @MarkMeadows @jsmooth995 I don't think so, she left no doubt in my mind that she is a racist by your own definition.
@RepEscobar @Ilhan There seems to be no end to victim worship and hypocrisy in congress, she is a racist by your own rules, can she be a victim at the same time?
@NBCNewsTHINK @AOC @kurtbardella There is something fundamentally wrong with the state and federal governments attacking a family, a business, and the people that work in those business in an effort to find crimes to punish the person they hate and to overturn fair elections.
@RepAngieCraig @Ilhan There seems to be no end to victim worship and hypocrisy in congress, she is a racist by your own rules, can she be a victim at the same time?
@HaleyLive There seems to be no end to victim worship and hypocrisy in congress, she is a racist by your own rules, can she be a victim at the same time?
@RepPressley Will you be passing any laws to help the male minority in this country?
@RepEliotEngel I called her out for being racist several weeks ago, I can‚Äôt do it every day.
@RepKClark @IlhanMN She must stop being a racist first.
@AOC It is hard to feel bad for someone who clearly racist.
@AOC You drive jobs out of you community, you side with racist friends @RashidaTlaib and @IlhanMN, you proclaim you are a socialist, and now you are bff with illegal migrants.
@RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Look we know how racist @RashidaTlaib and @IlhanMN are now, knock off the bs talk.
@RepTjCox Is there a male history month, we are the minority?
@RepKClark @RepJayapal @USProgressives There is something fundamentally wrong with the state and federal governments attacking a family, a business, and the people that work in those business in an effort to find crimes to punish the person they hate and to overturn fair elections.
@RepKatieHill @OversightDems Hillary Clinton should not have one either but she does and did. Mishandling classified information is a bigger concern to security officials than questionable relationships. Double standards makes this pure politics and I thought you came to DC to avoid that.
@ChrisCuomo There is something fundamentally wrong with the state and federal governments attacking a family, a business, and the people that work in those business in an effort to find crimes to punish the person they hate and to overturn fair elections.
@ewarren There is something fundamentally wrong with the state and federal governments attacking a family, a business, and the people that work in those business in an effort to find crimes to punish the person they hate and to overturn fair elections.
@RepKatieHill Hmmm ‚Ä¶ at least two or three of these women are known racist, you sure about being proud?
@nowthisnews She demonstrated she is a racist in the biggest moment in her life, too funny.ü§£
@AOC A higher standard? Your bff sitting two seats from you showed her racist ass on national TV in her big moment.
@RashidaTlaib Hmmm ‚Äì is this a women of color dog whistle? You demonstrated you are a racist in the biggest moment in you life on TV, too funny.
@Ilhan @RepJasonCrow Odd, I thought illegal immigrants were disease free and Trump was just making things up.
@AOC @OversightDems How far will we take victim worship. So sad to see a new type of victim created today in congress. Cohen is now a Trump ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. Poor man, victimized by Trump. Dems to the rescue. https://t.co/Upu2alIV7O
@JoyAnnReid How far will we take victim worship. So sad to see a new type of victim created today in congress. Cohen is now a Trump ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. Poor man, victimized by Trump. Dems to the rescue. https://t.co/yZNpPWcwbb

@Ilhan You still think overturning elections by impeachment is the American way. Sad.
@AOC You are an attention _____, you are not fooling anyone.
@AOC ‚Ä¶ and her MAGA lips. https://t.co/IR4b8R8wUl
@AOC I have no idea what you are talking about or posing for.
@jwbussmann @RepMGS @maddow How so?
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump You are one rude and obnoxious bitch. You should be banned from committees.
@RepMGS @maddow What happens to Americans when the parents are arrested. You got it, they are separated from their children immediately. Do you advocate reuniting Americans in jail with their children?
@AOC Oh no your MAGA lips got out in front of you again. She said she supports a minimum wage. She does not believe in a minimum guarantee for people ‚Äúunwilling to work‚Äù which was the question asked.
@KamalaHarris True, but I would like to hear what else is a minimal standard? Food on the table for a family of 4 can easily be done for $10,000 a year.
@RepKatieHill @OversightDems It will certainly be entertaining watching some of your congressional retards friends question a convict and lier, but that is hardly the truth. BTW, you are looking good.
@ChrisCuomo It will certainly be entertaining watching congressional retards question a convict and lier, but that is hardly evidence.
@LeaderHoyer @HispanicCaucus What happens to Americans when the parents are arrested. You got it, they are separated from their children immediately. Do you advocate reuniting Americans in jail with their children? They are illegal.
@RepPressley @RashidaTlaib What happens to Americans when the parents are arrested. You got it, they are separated from their children immediately. Do you advocate reuniting Americans in jail with their children?
@dbongino That is not the way it works, socialist leaders do NOT live the life of the peasants. There is not a chance in hell she gives up a dime.
@KamalaHarris You forgot to mention that this only happens to illegal immigrants. What happens to Americans when the parents are arrested. You got it, they are separated from their children immediately.
@RashidaTlaib I hope you told him there are too many ‚Äúisms‚Äù in this world, go outside and playism.
@KamalaHarris It depends what degree was obtained. If debt is owed because the earned degree has no demand or use in our economy, tough. We can not reward stupid choices.
@JoyAnnReid Hypocrisy and spin is common and the norm in politics and media.
@SenGillibrand Women are more than half, I am finally a minority ‚Ä¶. Happy Dance https://t.co/AfPjmrmyLx
@ChrisCuomo Don‚Äôt act stupid now when most of the time you act smug. It is the timing that was not needed.
@AOC Statistics are good and I even support your basic concept but we are enabling people, kids, to make poor economic job choices. Many jobs were never expected to be living wage jobs, they were starter jobs and second jobs to earn EXTRA money. Push Trade and STEM jobs.
@Ilhan Mark my words ‚Ä¶ now that you are making good money, you will be sick about the taxes you pay after there is medicare for all ‚Ä¶. even before that. You are in for a shock next year when you pay taxes.
@ChrisCuomo You are so pretentious sometimes.
@RepKatieHill @RepHuffman @RepBrianFitz @RepDonBeyer So other than pulling out of the agreement, what has Trump done to violate the agreement? China by far is the largest offender, yet they are still part of the agreement. What good is the agreement?
@RepAdamSchiff Barney Fife for two years, I will give you that.
@AOC Can you please tell us what a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù is based on? What everyday necessities are included in a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù? A list would be helpful.
@Ilhan Do you ever think about anything other than racist thoughts and victim worship?
@amyklobuchar Oh god, if you liked it ‚Ä¶. wonder what she said?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump When it comes to Trump you are willing to piss all over America. Shouldn‚Äôt you support the office if nothing else when he is abroad?
@AOC Did you really say the world ends in 12 years?
@AOC I would like to see you make sure China and India meet our current standard and that will help. Articles like this and whining by you do not help the cause. Who wrote those guesses anyway?
@Ilhan Now that you make $174,000 a year with about another $1,000,000 for your Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) that pays your staff and your expenses, how much taxes should you be paying?
@AOC You get $174,000 a year with about another $1,000,000 for your Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) That pays your staff and your expenses. If $52,000 is a livable wage, are you going to give up some of your money?
@RepPressley Did you stand with the Covington Catholic High School youth?
@PattyMurray They have been asking many questions over the years and anyone doing ancestry truly appreciates that.  https://t.co/tjbC997DA8	 Look at the questions we have asked over time. How does another question impact anything? More data is always good.
@AOC You are so wrong. The television and social media are so overwhelming biased to the left, it is driving the rest of us nuts, look at politicians and media popularity ratings. I love your MAGA lips but your words demand a response.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr I see the problem, let me help ..		1. Climate change is real	2. It might be caused by humans (mostly by China and India humans)	3. Democrats need to work with Republicans to create Technology manufacturing in the US that includes climate friendly options.
@AOC "Journalists" have been doing that for years ... oh because the shoe is on the other foot it is bad now .... got it.
@CNNTonight Fresh off you Al Sharpton moment, you talk about the white supremacist that was arrested in DC and you immediately tie him to Trumps words. You don‚Äôt think it could be your words that create hate? This is what we mean when we say Fake News.
@CNNTonight @donlemon Your Al Sharpton moment, minus the jumpsuit.
@RepJayapal Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax?
@JoyAnnReid @PhilippeReines @_waleedshahid @KatyTurNBC Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax?
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax?
@AOC There you go again running your MAGA lips. Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax.
@SenSchumer @Medium Didn‚Äôt you jumped on the mob bandwagon and pull an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax.
@Ilhan Your wrong, you are projecting your own actions on others. You are a racist and you jumped on the mob bandwagon when you pulled an Al Sharpton in the Smollett hoax.
@DailyMail She can come home in a box.
@RealCandaceO @RalphNortham Men are the minority, what would you like us to do?
@KamalaHarris Wait, is the related to the hoax?
@KamalaHarris @JussieSmollett Hmmm .. is this another instance of a rush to judgment? You are part of the mob, a mob leader. Now that this looks like a hoax, you say you will wait for all the facts to come in. Hypocrite.
@brithume Please, please, please keep calling out bad journalist behavior. I doubt most even know there should be a difference between a journalist and columnist.
@Tiff_Bannen @university_fox Thank you
@KamalaHarris Getting close to truth now, don‚Äôt limit this to education. We look at criminals, politicians, race, almost everything is that way. Other peoples kids, politics left or right, criminal or victim, black or white, gay or straight ‚Ä¶ YOU are always right ... THEY are always WRONG.
@KamalaHarris How?
@BernieSanders Bernie, you missed the memo. White men, in particular old white men, are persona non grata in your base.
@SenJeffMerkley What do you think is going to happen to Mueller? You are a member of congress, if you don‚Äôt like laws, fix them. If we need new laws, make them. Stop playing CSI.
@KamalaHarris You are a member of congress, if you don‚Äôt like laws, fix them. If we need new laws, make them. It is your job to make law! Do it.

@KamalaHarris Hang on, the purpose of bail is to deter individuals from skipping court if they are released. Are you saying you do not believe bail is useful? You seem to be saying the poor people sitting in jail should be trusted when they are released? Wow.
@KamalaHarris You are a member of congress, if you don‚Äôt like laws, fix them. If we need new laws, make them. Who in the hell are you protesting‚Ä¶. Yourself? It is your job to make law! Do it.
@AOC America is laughing at you, not with you. https://t.co/DuPtybfuOn
@RepPressley @AOC ‚Ä¶ after flipping one page for a photo opportunity she put it down never to turn another page again.
@JoyAnnReid I realize you are not really the press, a journalist, or a reporter, you are a simple opinionated talking head. All the same, be fair, it seems like there is and was an abnormal amount of effort going on to overturn the election what was fair.
@JoyAnnReid 44% of us. (only 44% of Americans pay Federal Tax)
@RealCandaceO Chicago police think "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett paid two men to orchestrate the assault on himself, two police sources say https://t.co/mlYiKD91uR

@RoKhanna The businesses will have in that same Bill of Rights the ability to charge us for everything they give us for free today. Nothing is free, be careful what you ask for.
@RepJayapal If you don‚Äôt like the law he used, change it. Do your job and stop bitching.
@RepJayapal @RepBarbaraLee Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller were each worth around $350 Billion each around 1920. Each had more money than the Top 3 in the US today. In fact, they had more money than the top 10 richest. They probably had more $ than just about everyone else. Things have gotten better.
@TeamPelosi @RepDwightEvans The constitution allows congress to make laws, it is a law that Trump is using. Congress made the law. If congress needs to change the law to redefine what a National Emergency is, they should do that. It is 42 years old, maybe it is time to change it.
@StayAtHomeAv @MDHaddad17 @RepJasonCrow The constitution allows congress to make laws, it is a law that Trump is using. Congress made the law. If congress needs to change the laws to redefine what a National Emergency is, they should do that. It is 42 years old, maybe it is time to change it.
@kasie @ScottWalker @MittRomney @LindseyGrahamSC The media, ‚Äúpress‚Äù, ‚Äújournalist‚Äù, pick heroes and villains. It is so transparent these days. It is funny how the candidate from Hawaii is largely ignored now. They are simply promoting who they want to win.
@RepJimmyGomez @RepBarbaraLee @realDonaldTrump Are you nuts, the more information the better. They have been asking many many questions over the years and anyone doing ancestry truly appreciates that.  https://t.co/tjbC997DA8	Why don't you take a look at it yourself?

@RepDMP Agree, is HR8 going to fix the killing in Chicago? 187 people have been shot in 2019 as of 2/11/2019. Why not focus on the real problems in this country. Shall I dig up the numbers in the other 29 big cities. Will registration lower those numbers? What does that tell you?

@RealCandaceO I guess you didn‚Äôt read what they found.
@RoKhanna Nice idea and probably a good Idea for many of the convicted. However, some are dangerous, mentally ill, and some have chosen crime as a profession. You should not be lumping all together.
@RoKhanna $15 an hour is not that helpful, they should be given stock options so they can live the dream and be vested in the company. Give them a chance to reach middle class, $15 an hour is not going to do that.
@RepWexton Why would you be wringing your hands over Trump invoking a law? Congress made the law. Change the law, redefine what a National Emergency is if you don't like it.
@AdamSchiff Why would you be wringing your hands over Trump invoking a law? Congress made the law. If they need to change the laws to redefine what a National Emergency is, they should do that. It is 42 years old, maybe it is time to change it.
@RepPressley @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Do you stand with Representative Omar?
@RoKhanna Did you post your tax return? Let‚Äôs say you did, what could I learn from that form? How would I know you are on the up and up and have no questionable relationships or interests? Show me yours and tell me what on there gives you a green light.

@ChrisCuomo Probably, but why isn‚Äôt congress spending hand over fist to stop drugs and people? It is going to take more than X-ray. Is it OK for him to use the Nat Emer to make that number 100%? ‚Ä¶ What happens then .. the dealers and illegals just give up and stop trying? Nope .. Nat Emer
@kasie If you are doing anything like what I see on TV, the ‚Äúreporters‚Äù are not doing their job. You are not and have not be ‚Äúreporting‚Äù the news for years. Most of you think your smarter than the average viewers and you think you opinion is news, news should be unbiased and complete.
@AOC It is Friday night, are you drunk? Stoned?

@AOC AOC 2019		- Recognized leader of the socialist movement in the US Congress	- Jobs created in 2019: - 25,000	- BFF admitted racist -  Representative Omar		Bad start. You may be a one term wonder.
@JoyAnnReid Well if you are jobless, that sounds like a pretty good way to earn money.
@RevDrBarber The people with the so called ‚Äúmoral authority‚Äù defined the definition, conditions, and punishment for for racist. She was one of those self righteous individuals that cried racists must resign.  So resign.
@AOC @AyannaPressley @IlhanMN If you were not a hypocrite, you would be trying to get her removed from the committee. She has violated PC. She is a racist by your own standards.
@GOPLeader @RepGwenMoore @WaysandMeansGOP I can help you out cause I know you can‚Äôt say it ‚Ä¶.. She is too damn dumb to be a member of congress and she makes all of you look bad.
@AdamSchiff Who cares, focus on Americans CSI Schiff
@AdamSchiff Yes you did and no one really believed his schedule ended at 5pm everyday M-F with no weekend work and no work after 5pm as the schedule showed. That time is not accounted for in the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù you based your comments on. CSI Schiff at it again with half baked facts.
@RepRoKhanna Why not focus on something that benefits Americans?
@RepAdamSchiff @RoKhanna Why don‚Äôt you ever focus on something that benefits Americans, just pass laws that make Americans life better.
@RepAdamSchiff CSI Schiff as a congressman: not doing his job.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump No one wants women to be silent, but please stop saying stupid shit when you do talk.
@AOC Well if you are jobless, that sounds like a pretty good way to earn money.
@Ilhan Who wants your apology? You are a racist. Just own it.
@SenGillibrand Just curious about the 12 weeks of paid leave, what if you are single, can you use the leave on any family situation? If so, this is just pretty much 12 weeks paid leave for everyone. We will all work 9 months get 3 months off each year (plus weekends).
@AOC Things are going well for a lot of us, not just the billionaires. I would say life has gone your way judging by the dance you did as you entered your new office. Stop pretending you are one of the suffering, you are the privileged now.
@ChrisCuomo Shouldn‚Äôt you be spending more time talking about the Representative Omar? What happen to individuals must be held accountable? She must resign, be investigated, or impeached. Right? Since when does an apology from a racist end the discussions?
@TulsiPress Why is the media ignoring you? The wacky dem women are getting all the coverage.
@JackPosobiec No ‚Ä¶.. this woman is quickly becoming my favorite hypocrite in congress.
@RepMGS Just curious about the 12 weeks of paid leave, what if you are single, can you use the leave on any family situation? If so, this is just pretty much 12 weeks paid leave for everyone. We will all work 9 months get 3 months off each year (plus weekends).
@IlhanMN @MaxRose4NY You are the double standard you hypocrite.
@KamalaHarris Tell your friend, Representative Omar, Jewish parents should not have to tell their children ‚Ä¶..
@chrislhayes Ah ‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt think it had anything to do with anything else? Do your job, tell us both sides of the story. Do you really consider yourself ‚Äúthe press‚Äù?
@AOCpress Act of WAR? LAUNCH the thermonuclear weapons!
@RepKClark Just curious about the 12 weeks of paid leave, what if you are single, can you use the leave on any family situation? If so, this is just pretty much 12 weeks paid leave for everyone that works. We will all work 9 months get 3 months off each year (plus weekends and holiday).
@AOC @IlhanMN I see how it works. Rep. @IlhanMN is a racist ________ _________. You are a _____ ________. Tic Toc ‚Ä¶. Tic Toc ‚Ä¶ I apologize absolutely and completely in the allotted time. Kind of like the 3 second rule when it falls on the floor. We are good now. What a hypocrite.
@Jim_Jordan Remember, we are not looking for the perfect deal. Take what you can get and move on to the next problem.
@RepMarkMeadows Remember, we are not looking for the perfect deal. Take what you can get and move on to the next problem.
@RepDeanPhillips Probably a good idea, but then again, tweeting exposed her true thoughts. Did you tell her she must resign, be investigated, or impeached?
@RashidaTlaib It is not hate, you are hypocrites. Since when does an apology from a racist end the discussions? Isn‚Äôt that what Representative Omar is? Are you not complicit if you don‚Äôt point it out? Isn‚Äôt swift justice in order? She must resign, be investigated, or impeached. Right?
@ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime Shouldn‚Äôt you be spending more time talking about the Representative Omar? What happen to individuals must be held accountable? She must resign, be investigated, or impeached. Right? Since when does an apology from a racist end the discussions?
@AOC @washingtonpost Hey, what do you think about your good friend, the racist Representative in white, what was her name again? You did call her a good friend didn‚Äôt you?
@LeaderHoyer All you need from him is a signature. Do your job and get it passed. I am sure he will be back in town before you get to that point.
@MartinHeinrich Since when does an apology from a racist end the discussions? Never in this PC world. What happen to individuals must be held accountable? She must resign, be investigated, or impeached.

@RepAdamSchiff Does anyone else hear Barney Fife‚Äôs voice when they read CSI Schiff‚Äôs words?
@RashidaTlaib That is total bull shit. The democrats have been fragmenting and prioritizing who gets special privilege for decades. Trump is simply pushing back at these ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù tactics. In your world it is a race to who can be anointed the top victim status.
@SenGillibrand That is total bull shit. The democrats have been fragmenting and prioritizing who gets special privilege for decades. Trump is simply pushing back at these ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù tactics. In your world it is a race to who can be anointed the top victim status.
@RepAdamSchiff CSI Schiff, on duty. Reminds me of Barney Fife.
@ewarren Oh, it is not only the Billionaires or even the Millionaires that want you to shut up. Your ideas are harmful to the 44% of us that pay federal taxes. I guess we are considered the rich.
@BobMooreNews @RepEscobar @LeaderHoyer @RepDebHaaland @RepMGS @RepTorresSmall Hang on. Is that a wall I see, a huge wall? Is that an immoral wall in the background? Who put that thing up, walls don‚Äôt work do they?
@RepEscobar @RepDebHaaland @RepMGS @LeaderHoyer @RepTorresSmall Wait, what? Is that an immoral wall I see in that picture? Those don‚Äôt work do they?
@RepTorresSmall @CBP Wait, what? Is that an immoral wall I see in that picture? Those don‚Äôt work do they?
@RashidaTlaib Congress women are not going to get respect if you continue to pull color coordinated stunts like you did at the SOTU. All you did is make it abundantly clear you hate Trump so bad you can no longer be happy for his successes that are American successes.
@LeaderHoyer @RepDebHaaland @RepEscobar @RepTorresSmall @RepMGS Really Steny, you visited the boarder and that is your tweet?
@JoyAnnReid Yes, I am sadly one of the 44% in this country that pay federal taxes along with the rich. The 56% that do not pay federal tax will pay none of it.
@AOC We know government officials without means can be security risk. Do you think some of the less well off members of congress are a risk our national security? Have we seen every member of congress Tax returns?
@KamalaHarris So what will you do about the biggest offenders, China and India?
@RepAdamSchiff CSI Schiff .. We know government officials without means are a security risk when using the same profile techniques. Do you think some of the less well off members of congress also risk our national security? Have we seen every member of congress Tax returns?
@RepRaskin @AOC You should be embarrassed not proud, it was like watching MSNBC.
@AOC Can you get a security clearance with a very low credit score?
@AOC There is no doubt politics is slimy. Funny how there seems to be a lot of talk how the billionaire in the WH has financial incentive to make bad discussions. Can you imagine what bad decisions you might make when the swamp call$ you?
@timkaine You have groupthink - Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.
@RepJayapal @TPM How embarrassing it was watching! I cannot believe half of people asking the questions were elected to congress. It was like watching MSNBC.

@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress You are a hypocrite when it comes to Virginia, Warren. Now you are thoughtful, pondering. Oh now you get it, it is complex. It was so all black an white when it was a republicans on the hot seat. You seem to believe socialism has no cost.
@SpeakerPelosi Oh no dreamers, that means Nancy hates Trump more than she loves you. No deal for you!
@SenJeffMerkley Why do you support illegal immigrants?
@Ilhan You proved how great this county is when immigrants follow the processes, you proved the point. Why do you support illegal immigrants?
@AC360 @RepSwalwell Congress should not be acting like a police force
@IlhanMN Rags to riches should not be ‚Äúcommon‚Äù. You have a bunch of old people in congress because they have the one thing you do not, WISDOM. Should winning the lottery be more ‚Äúcommon‚Äù too? You hit the lottery enjoy it take advantage of it.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Congress should not be acting like a police force, that was not the intent. How does double jeopardy apply to congress?
@SenSchumer You are so sad he didn‚Äôt give you something to cry about.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseJudiciary Start with Chicago.
@AOC @rosadelauro It was sad to see you sit there stone faced (while others stood) when there was talk about stopping illegal immigration, American being great, and NO socialism. What happen when he talked about you getting a job in congress ‚Ä¶ happy joy joy. It is not about America, all about you
@Ilhan Please post the same statistics for the entire country.
@RepAdamSchiff Mr. CSI ... Congress should not be acting like a police force, that was not the intent of the power. How does double jeopardy apply to congress?

@RepFinkenauer @RepCindyAxne Sad to see the Dem women sit there stone faced (while others stood) when there was talk about stopping illegal immigration, American being great, and NO socialism. Talk about them getting a job in congress ‚Ä¶ happy joy joy. It is not about America, it is about them.
@NormaJTorres @realDonaldTrump Put your offer out there then, offer $60 billion and allow a panel of security experts figure out how to do it best. See what he says.
@MeetThePress @RepDeSaulnier Bull shit. We almost have to beg people to vote. Most people just don‚Äôt care enough to vote.
@RepWexton @RepDeSaulnier Dem women were an embarrassment, any talk about stopping illegal immigration, American being great, or no socialism they shake their head and sit. Talk about them getting a job in congress ‚Ä¶ happy joy joy.

@SpeakerPelosi @staceyabrams @realDonaldTrump Really, that is what you heard in that speech? You didn‚Äôt listen.
@SenatorCardin It is illegal to rush the boarder in mass. That is called an invasion. Why are you against an orderly process that starts outside our country?
@KamalaHarris Good, let her talk for herself.
@SenJeffMerkley You sound like a complainer. What would you do?
@RepBobbyRush @staceyabrams Not really, but it is fun to watch MSNBC focus on 5 minutes of a 90 minute speech and goo and gaw over this woman that can‚Äôt even win a state election.
@LeaderHoyer @realDonaldTrump The speech was like 90 minutes, he talked about the wall for just a few minutes. Your getting too old pay attention.
@SenJeffMerkley @staceyabrams Bull shit. We beg people to vote. Most people just don‚Äôt care enough to vote.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Congress is to blame when laws are not passed.

@RepAnnieKuster @RepMarcyKaptur @realDonaldTrump @RepBonamici @RepCheri @NydiaVelazquez @LeaderHoyer @RepSpanberger @RepSherrill Look at the Dem women, any talk about stopping illegal immigration, American being great, or no socialism they shake their head and sit.

@mahyarsorour @realDonaldTrump He certainly cares less when the immigrants are ILLEGAL
@RepLoisFrankel @realDonaldTrump Look at the Dem women, any talk about stopping illegal immigration or how American is great, they shake their head and sit. Talk about them getting a job in congress ‚Ä¶ happy joy joy.  WTF

@SenJeffMerkley Nice, your looking at the women, first the Speaker, then the congress women.
@SenJeffMerkley How did you like the working together part?
@KamalaHarris Oh wonderful, give her some good words.
@RepSherrill @RepSpanberger @RepHoulahan Is there a congress memo that goes out to all the women saying where white today? How does that happen?
@RepKatieHill Rep. Katie Hill is hot, score one for the democrats
@OscarTRamirez @AOC @JoeNeguse @JoaquinCastrotx @PramilaJayapal @RepYvetteClarke @AyannaPressley @tedlieu @RoKhanna @RepBrendanBoyle Why exactly is that a good thing? What if 8 of 9 were white?
@RepAdamSchiff Does anyone really believe his schedule ended at 5pm everyday M-F with no weekend work and no work after 5pm as the schedule shows? Haven‚Äôt we all seen him on the working after hours, weekends, and holidays? That time is not accounted for in the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. CSI Schiff at it again
@SenKamalaHarris Not exactly, this is what it said originally ‚Ä¶  Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned ‚Ä¶ by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.
@ChrisCuomo Does anyone really believe his schedule ended at 5pm everyday M-F with no weekend work and no work after 5pm as the schedule shows? Haven‚Äôt we all seen him on the working after hours, weekends, and holidays? That time is not accounted for in the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. Again, fake news.
@AOC Look at how your party and how you treat Trump for having ‚Äúdiffering opinions‚Äù. Why can‚Äôt you be treated like Trump is treated? What goes around comes around. Should you be treated differently because you are a female?
@AdamSchiff Does anyone really believe his schedule ended at 5pm everyday M-F with no weekend work and no work after 5pm as the schedule shows? Haven‚Äôt we all seen him on the working after hours, weekends, and holidays? That time is not accounted for in the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. Again, fake news.
@KamalaHarris So what the hell is going in in Chicago, it is like a war zone there? What is the good idea that is going to stop the killing in Chicago?
@SenKamalaHarris It is unthinkable that you will risk this or shutdown simply to avoid giving Trump what he promised the American people. You choose politics over boarder security. Anyone can see that providing border funding and allowing security experts decide how best to deploy is reasonable.
@RepGilCisneros Your not the least bit worried about the American children that are going to suffer from the shutdown that could be avoided. Why don‚Äôt you focus your efforts on Americans, America‚Äôs children? Do you job!
@RepMikeLevin What do you suggest?
@RepVeasey @BlueCollarDems Good idea but lets work on unity. My edits: Congress can invest in green energy and deliver millions of American jobs. We need infrastructure reform to pave new roads, provide broadband so kids can excel in school, and rebuild outdated Amtrak railroads.
@RepJoeKennedy @RepLoriTrahan Welcome to the house the STEELERS built! Now you are in the club. We have been waiting a long time for you to get here.

@davidcicilline Welcome to the house the STEELERS built! Now you are in the club. We have been waiting a long time for you to get here.
@SenatorMenendez @washingtonpost We should honor press and journalism. Unfortunately, we have too little of that today. What we have today on the major news outlets is opinion commentators and writers with agendas. They are hiding under the banner of journalism and they are not.
@mind_is_moving @mainulmizan @RepRoKhanna Don‚Äôt forget about the 44% that pay no federal taxes.
@RepSusanWild Of course you would say that. The only politically correct answer is swift and harsh punishment for anything that is offensive or politically incorrect. It is a picture ... off with his head she says.
@JoyAnnReid I don‚Äôt really get your three letter tweets? Are you suggesting the problem is much greater than Trump believes, now we need subterranean walls as well? This sounds like a real problem.
@mainulmizan @RepRoKhanna Sounds good, but it also sounds like socialism. We need to fix health care costs no doubt but socialism is a false promise.
@AOC @AyannaPressley @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Now that you are in charge, I am sure there will be a compromise on an immigration package AMERICANS want, not just the AMERICAN in your party. If you do YOUR job, we would have orderly and legal migration in the future.
@RepRiggleman We have been saying that 50 years. You are old enough to remember real racism, this is a picture from the past. This is a picture from an era where racism was much worse than it is today.
@RepRoKhanna Then do it, just don‚Äôt raise my taxes. I pay way too much.
@Ilhan Maybe we should let them all just go free. The rich can pay for them too. Oh, but what about their checkered past? If incarcerated individuals are set free, would you support them running for public office? Do you think any of them are bigots? For the record, heat the damn cells.
@RepAlGreen Is that the only thing you can focus on, bigotry and Trump? What are you doing to prevent a shutdown?
@Ilhan Most Americans think socialism is a bad thing.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump What are you doing to negotiate and compromise with the republicans? The first one was on Trump. If you fail to compromise, the second shutdown and the pain suffered is on you.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I am sick and tired of congress not doing their job! There should be a compromise on an immigration package AMERICANS want, not just the AMERICAN in your party. If you would have done your job instead of worrying about Trump, we would have orderly and legal migration.
@RepBarragan @OfficialCBC @HispanicCaucus Of course you would say that. The only politically correct answer is swift and harsh punishment for anything that is offensive or politically incorrect. It is a picture ... off with his head she says.
@johnNathanfaul2 @IlhanMN OK, found this https://t.co/GyJ3MD2vGS
@IlhanMN 44% of Americans pay NO federal taxes. That means 56% pay 100% of everything. That is messed up. Why not incentivise the rich? We should never be the socialist country you want.

@IlhanMN That would certainly be the talk of the media if an old white guy said that. I guessing nothing will happen to you.
@JoyAnnReid Give me one instance where Russia hacking has changed a single vote in any election. Identify one person that voted for Trump because they were hacked or tricked by fake news. Cyber threats are a threat to this country just as communism, socialism, and terrorism are.
@RepTedDeutch Do you really think anyone would build a wall where it is not needed? Do you think the people that run homeland security are complete idiots?
@SenJeffMerkley I‚Äôm listening ‚Ä¶ what changes should we make?
@SenGillibrand Yes, lets start by removing the immoral walls at the California / Mexico border!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Agree, the first one was on Trump. If you fail to compromise, the second shutdown and the pain they suffer is on you.
@RepMaxineWaters Do you even know that impeachment does not remove him from office?
@PattyMurray What makes you think Trump is not going to keep inflicting pain until he gets the wall (or something similar). This next shutdown will be on you, the suffering of the workers will be on you.
@SenGillibrand Stupid point, you are the example that any woman can get elected to congress.
@RepSwalwell What makes you think Trump is not going to keep inflicting pain until he gets the wall (or something similar). This next shutdown will be on you, the suffering of the workers will be on you. I will be reminding you, over and over again after it happens.
@AOC That was actually a good question. Seems like you are asking if the process if fair. You could probably get Trump support using that line of thought.
@ewarren Envy ‚Ä¶ Jealousy
@SenJohnKennedy Why would he be talking about 1900 miles? I heard 234 miles on all the networks, even MSNBC.
@AOC Good idea, please list the names and salaries of all the people on your staff. Oh, are the salaries not equal? Do you even know what they are?
@KamalaHarris Holly Cow! Are you messing with us saying all of these ridiculous things? Why on earth would we want a government elected by non-US citizens? Did Russia put you up to this?
@KamalaHarris Hate crime labels are ridiculous. Killing minorities, gay, transgender, white ‚Ä¶.. equally bad. KILLING should be the maximum penalty period! How do you think it makes victim families feel when their killer gets a lessor penalty because they are not in a ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù category.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Why did congress conduct an intelligence briefing in a public setting?
@AOC I think most of us would listen first to the guy that built the Starbucks empire before we would listen to a city council member, don‚Äôt you think?
@SenBlumenthal How do we know the men aren‚Äôt overpaid? Maybe they both should be making 83 cents.
@ewarren Envy ‚Ä¶ Jealousy
@SenBlumenthal @JoaquinCastrotx Stop worrying about non citizens, focus on work congress needs to do for the real citizens of the US.
@realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think Congress should have Intelligence Chiefs in public meetings and I don‚Äôt think the POTUS should be saying bad things about them. Two BADs.
@KamalaHarris Everyone should be wealthy too. You really should have a pragmatic solution to the health care problems.
@ewarren China produces 28% of Global emissions. The next three US, India, and Russia produce 26% combined. Since China is by your definition the most existential threat to us, what is your position on China?
@AC360 @Cliff_Sims @andersoncooper If it is generally believed that Trump and all around him lie all the time and about everything, why would you consider people around him lying to congress about anything a smoking gun?
@ewarren @chrislhayes What I am more concerned about how few people pay taxes. 44% of Americans pay NO federal taxes? That means 56% pay 100% of everything. That is messed up. Why not incentivise the rich? We should never be the socialist country you want.
@AC360 @SenBlumenthal @andersoncooper Blumenthal is kind of scary don‚Äôt you think?
@KamalaHarris No you don't. To compromise is to make a deal between different parties where EACH party gives up part of their demand. Your position is no deal can be had if the wall is part of the deal and it doesn‚Äôt matter how you F‚Ä¶ the dreamers as long as you beat Trump.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Isn‚Äôt that great, you could have given Trump the ‚Äúevil wall‚Äù and we (the tax payers) would have saved $5 BILLION Dollars.
@PattyMurray Your making demands. To compromise is to make a deal between different parties where EACH party gives up part of their demand. Congress needs to do their job, figure it out. What are you doing to fix this problem, lets talk about you, not Trump.
@KamalaHarris China produces 28% of Global emissions. The next three US, India, and Russia produce 26% combined. Since China is by your definition the most existential threat to us (the world), what is your position on China?
@ewarren No, I think he summed that up nicely.
@ewarren What is the opposite of the ‚Äúlike‚Äù on here, bad idea. You are full of them.
@realDonaldTrump They are going to beat you down with science on this one. Stick with the arguments you can win.
@RepDwightEvans @RepMGS @HouseDemocrats Isn‚Äôt that great, you could have given Trump the ‚Äúevil wall‚Äù and we (the tax payers) would have saved $5 BILLION Dollars.
@RepBrendanBoyle @HowardSchultz ‚Ä¶ or put another way, there is a better chance of you being named the new starting center than there is a chance of an older white male will be nominated in the democratic party. I like his chances better as an independent.
@KamalaHarris We do need to speak the truth ... older white males are an endangered group in today's democratic party. Wonder why? I do not expect democrats to nominate an older white man for at least 20 years.
@SenatorDurbin Trump says ‚Äúwall‚Äù, Americans hear ‚Äúborder security‚Äù. Only the fine tuned ear of democrats and the media hear it literally. (so what if he meant it at one time). If you would have invested $6B in boarder security Trump would have been happy and the tax payer would have saved $5B.
@SenSchumer They? Who is they? Sounds like YOU have a job to do. If you don‚Äôt like it do your job, fix it. CONGRESS needs to fix it. There is no THEY. CONGRESS.
@RepJayapal Isn‚Äôt that great, you could have given Trump the ‚Äúevil wall‚Äù and we (the tax payers) would have saved $5 BILLION Dollars.
@RepAdamSchiff Mr. CSI at it again. Stop ringing your hands, there is nothing you will be happy with. Everything comes out one way or another. Do you really think they could hide something from you that won‚Äôt eventually come out?
@yashar @RepEscobar @tombrokaw I watched the interview and do not understand why he need to apologize.
@AOC Fix the immigration system and secure our borders and there would be no need for ICE.
@CNNnewsroom I was watching her today. She casually stated that Trumps support is uneducated white voters, implying a small minority. According to the census bureau, uneducated white voters equal 59% of the US. https://t.co/NsSMO6XLA7
@HowardSchultz We need a legitimate 3rd option. I know democrats don‚Äôt want to hear this but we had two bad choices the last election. That is why Trump won. Not the Russians, not the hacks.
@RepRobinKelly I support this idea in general but does anyone know what percentage of gun shots are from legal guns verse illegal guns? I assume illegal guns are the real problem but maybe I am wrong.
@profharbinger @langetombee @RepDebHaaland Now we have gone full circle. As I said initially, ‚Äú... good idea or good military reason ...?‚Äù I do not know the answer. Our military is why we can have this debate. My preference is to not mess with the greatest fighting force the world has ever known.
@RepAdamSchiff Is this all you do, focus on Trump and play CSI?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I hope you are working with the president or the ‚Äúother side‚Äù in congress to pass legislation everyone can agree on.
@profharbinger @langetombee @RepDebHaaland The soldiers take an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic; they obey the orders of the POTUS and the orders of the officers over them, according to regulations and the UCMJ. The POTUS serves the people, they protect the country.
@profharbinger @langetombee @RepDebHaaland The US Military protects every right and liberty we have. We should all be concerned when we force them to rethink and revamp what they consider normal and what has worked. It just makes sense to be careful.
@JuJuPie3 @RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary Give me one instance where Russia hacking has changed a single vote in any election. Identify one person that voted for Trump because they were hacked or tricked by fake news. Cyber threats are a threat to this country just as communism, socialism, and terrorism are.
@JuJuPie3 @RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary We are spending millions of dollars investigating Russia attacks, that is sufficient. There are many many important issues that require congress to act. Many of those issues will have much greater impact on our future.
@JuJuPie3 @RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary Russia was up to no good before and after the elections. The public may have forgotten but our military did not, I am not concerned. Have you ever met anyone that said ‚ÄúDamn, those Russian convinced me to vote for Trump‚Äù?
@RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary It is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@SpeakerPelosi It is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@RepJahanaHayes Correct but I think the point is you can‚Äôt pick and choose who you apply our laws to. There are plenty of politicians that are no better or worse than Trump. Including democrats.
@RepMcGovern @HouseDemocrats @RepDonBeyer No it is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@RepBarragan We should have an orderly immigration system. If you were not so focused on trying to beat Trump you would realize you have the best opportunity ever to fix the system that creates the problems. Do your job, fix the system.
@profharbinger @langetombee @RepDebHaaland Without a strong military we would not have the civil rights and the great county we have today. I do not believe this is an either or situation but we should always error on the side of military advantage when in doubt.
@profharbinger @langetombee @RepDebHaaland When it comes to our military we want to maintain the superior force, the military advantage should always be the first and most important factor when making decision that impact our ability to fight.
@RepAdamSchiff It is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@AOC If there is a neutral unbiased news source please let me know. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter if they are big or small. Most are not journalist or news.
@AOC You sound like you are more interested in taking from those you consider rich and have a socialist agenda.
@RepAdamSchiff It is your job to produce legislation to prevent that from happening again. If people are forced to work, it should not be an option to leave it out of the budget or fail to pass a budget. Lets take politics out of the budget process.
@RepDonBeyer It is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@RepAlGreen It is your job to produce legislation to prevent that from happening again. If people are forced to work, it should not be an option to leave it out of the budget or fail to pass a budget. Lets take politics out of the budget process.
@SenWarren Why not incentivise the rich? We should never be the socialist country you want. Where does it end, at first it is the ‚Äútippy-top‚Äù then it will be the top when you need more money. Our wealthy will just move to a country that doesn‚Äôt steal their money.
@SenJeffMerkley Congress has more power than you know. Stop worrying about Trump.
@SenJeffMerkley No it is time for you to do the job you were elected to do, focus on the real problems we need fixed and stop playing CSI.
@thehill But is it funny.
@johnpodesta Aren‚Äôt you the guy who started this mess because your password was ‚Äúpassword‚Äù?
@AOC @ChrisCuomo Cuomo makes sense about 80% of the time. I find it odd the conclusions he reaches at the end of his show are ridiculous 20% of the time.
@AOC @SpeakerPelosi You know the power she has over you, keep sucking up to her. That will help you be a successful politician but you will not have much value to the country. If you are a authentic, call her and the leadership in both parties out for what they are.
@AOC If there is a neutral unbiased news source please let me know. MSNBC is literally non-stop anti-trump. I assume they love you.
@ewarren @AOC Why not incentivise the rich? We should never be the socialist country you want. Where does it end, at first it is the ‚Äútippy-top‚Äù then it will be the "top" when you need more money. Our wealthy will just move to a country that doesn‚Äôt steal their money.
@nowthisnews @AOC The media loves you, you are attractive, fresh, and want to move us towards a socialist state. Did I really hear you say ‚Äúthe world will end in 12 years‚Äù?
@Ilhan What would you change in our system to fix it?
@SenGillibrand When you are defined by politics ‚Äústrongest anti-Trump record‚Äù, that should get you a lot of NOs
@langetombee @RepDebHaaland Hmm ‚Ä¶. respectable countries as well. To answer your question ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/gZkbiLyjMd
@RepWexton Did you forget Pelosi on that list? You don‚Äôt need Trump, congress can do it alone.  What are you doing to fix this problem?
@TeamPelosi You don‚Äôt need Trump, congress can do it alone.  What are you doing to fix this problem?
@Ilhan You don‚Äôt need Trump, congress can do it alone.  What are you doing to fix this problem?
@langetombee @RepDebHaaland I am open to that question. What other nation encourages a transgender fighting force? Surely there must be a few countries if it is a good idea.
@RepAdamSmith To compromise is to make a deal between different parties where EACH party gives up part of their demand. Congress needs to do their job, figure it out. What are you doing to fix this problem, lets talk about you, not Trump.
@RepMGS Does it just sound like a good idea or is there a good military reason why they should be in military? I don‚Äôt know, do you? I wonder if there are Trans Russians, Trans Chinese, Trans North Koreans, or Trans Iranians in their military?

@ChrisCuomo White males have nothing to apologizes for, they can have opinions too without feeling empathy or guilt for every one who is not a fortunate as you. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can. Show a little love, your hate is transparent.
@ChrisCuomo If the majority of these people happen it be brown, that is your problem for focusing on it, not ours. If there are white unskilled and/or welfare woman with children that cross the Canadian boarder, we don‚Äôt what them either.
@ChrisCuomo You use the term ‚Äúbrown menace‚Äù frequently, often, easily. Most Americans are uninterested in increasing our population with unskilled and /or welfare woman with children that cross the boarder illegally (1 is too many).
@newchloe18 natural beauty
