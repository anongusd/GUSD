Read more about chickenomics https://t.co/is0Gs5pk19
Animal-welfare advocates fear this has been bad news for the birds. Chickens now often suffer heart problems and have trouble walking
Selective breeding has produced bigger, and more cost-efficient poultry. But chickens have become so big that their muscles prevent them from getting on top of each other to mate https://t.co/9mI7owoWCv
The biggest reason, however, is economic. The price of chicken has fallen far more quickly than that of beef or pork
Chickens live in sheds that are not cleaned until they are sent for slaughter, so they spend most of their lives sitting in their own faeces. But prophylactics limit the health risks to consumers
Second, antibiotics are now widely used in industrial farming. This allows chickens to be packed in denser and dirtier quarters than ever before
To start, many people are increasingly worried about the risks associated with eating red meat
In the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, pork and beef consumption has remained unchanged since 1990. Chicken consumption has grown by 70%. Why? https://t.co/gI0FTt82bp
