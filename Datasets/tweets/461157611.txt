@RepHankJohnson My condolences with deepest sympathy and prayers!
@Newsweek Mr. President, when will you take responsibility for your own actions?
@RawStory Dumb and Dumber!
@thedailybeast @staceyabrams @AOC Yeah look at him!
@RawStory Four separate entities related to you are under investigation, and you want to say Presidential harassments; you are just delusional or in denial!
@thedailybeast The lies knocked him out!
@RawStory I used to have so much respect for you Mike Pence, I looked so forward to voting for you someday as President, but your ability to compromise your dignity, values, morals, and integrity now would never allow me to vote for you!
@MotherJones An investigation will impede and expose your corruption. Psalm 7:11 King James Version (KJV) 11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
