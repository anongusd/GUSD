America has been winning since January 2009 when we began to dig out of the hole, created 13.2 million jobs and cut deficits by 2/3.
Great closing. Let's shut down the government, shut down health care for women, and default.
Great closing? Default on the money we owe.
Medicare? Folks have worked for it and earned it. It's a promise. This is where values come in. Medicare isn't for free, people paid for it!

GRONK!!!😎
Every time federal government gets involved things get worse? Really, the military, Medicare, Social security, R&amp;D, NASA, etc... #grumpycat
Kind of stunning that there's been no mention of the ACA. Probably because of 17 million covered and a record 90% with insurance.
Got it https://t.co/4o5NPF3kAq
13.2 million actually over 67 months. https://t.co/VtGldvxRvN
How about energy? No mention?? Because America is developing more home grown energy than it has since the 90s.
No mention of manufacturing yet. Probably because manufacturing jobs have grown for the first time since the 90's.
Training? GOP congress has voted against it. #FactFreeDebate
By the way, deficit reduced by 2/3 under this President. No mention yet.
So far, nothing about wages, education, job training, retirement, housing or any of the pillars of a middle class life.
Between each question, think we need to remind folks that 800k people lost jobs the month POTUS took office. Now 67 months of job creation.
We need to reverse the economic policy that dug us out of the hole and resulted in 67 months of job creation? #GopMATH

Defund #Obamacare if you want more than 3.1 million young adults on their parents' plans to lose their health insurance. #EnoughAlready
Defund #Obamacare if you want to prevent millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions from getting health insurance. #EnoughAlready

Step five: we should make sure families that don’t want to buy a home, or can’t yet afford to buy one, have a decent place to rent.
Step four: Let’s put construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes and tearing down vacant properties.
Step 3: Immigration reform. In study, avg homeowner has already seen value of their home boosted by thousands b/c of immigration.
Step two: Let’s make it easier for qualified buyers to buy homes they can...simplify overlapping regulations and cut red tape.
Step 1: A bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today’s rates
We have to turn the page on the bubble-and-bust mentality that created this mess, and build a housing system that’s durable and fair.
Now we have to build on this progress. We give to more hard-working Americans the chance to buy their first home.
Today, our housing market is healing. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 7 years.  Sales are up nearly 50%
We’ve helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates.
A home is supposed to be our ultimate evidence that in America, hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.
I’ve come to Phoenix to talk about that second, most tangible cornerstone at the heart of middle-class life: the chance to own your own home
That’s why I’m laying out my ideas for how we must build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America.
Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.  And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.
We produce more renewable energy than ever, and more natural gas than anyone
We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before.
Today, our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months.
