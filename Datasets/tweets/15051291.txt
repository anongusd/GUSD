@shareski @ShanaVWhite I mean, OK.
@shareski @ShanaVWhite Where I understand that some of these tweets can be saccharine and vacuous, I also see how there are those of us who are intentional about the “inspiration” we put out there.
@shareski @ShanaVWhite My own very personal reason for starting up my morning tweets as I did a couple of years ago was when this work got too difficult, especially my school work. I’m finding community in folks who are in systemically difficult situations and trying to help us build up.

@Veganmathbeagle I wanted to respond in kind. I’ll just say that the only I hear the “fun” part AND I also was thinking about comprehensiveness and how to make more of the math (and math attitudes)  seamless. That’s a huge puzzle. I believe in us.

@byjoelanderson “Woke” was gone shortly after ppl started searching their names and the words “charter schools are public schools.”
@KevinMKruse He told you @TheTattooedProf.
@FreedomReeves Indeed.
@FakeMathPhd @MrEazyE Mmhmm. I’m a fan of Calc 3 but my night job in school prevented me from doing better. In any case, thanks for the discussion.
@FakeMathPhd @MrEazyE We would have to differ strongly there. I believe teachers have at least partial responsibility to students’ math attitudes and capacity for calculus. There may certainly be a limit but I don’t think Calc 1 is it. Calc 2, maybe. 😂
@MrEazyE @FakeMathPhd Perhaps. It could also be that, based on reports from my own students as well as my own experience, there’s an expectation that you are supposed to just “get it.” If you don’t, then you can leave.
@MrEazyE @FakeMathPhd Same. AND I also know plenty of folks who know the math but kids aren’t learning from, esp. in high school and above.
@nycDSA https://t.co/e65CwKvi7w
@FakeMathPhd @MrEazyE Just to be clear: are we saying it’s cool to say that PK-12 teachers (or edus of younger children) don’t have much content knowledge but it’s not OK to make the reverse argument about higher ed folks? Because I’m here seeking a better medium than what’s present.
@FakeMathPhd @MrEazyE Competence is not just a measure of the content, but really, the instructional moves and relationships to the students. I contend that teachers influence students’ attitudes towards math not just with what they know but how they help students to know.
@MrEazyE @FakeMathPhd Content knowledge is fine but reductionist. I’m really asking everyone to find a better balance between the knowledge and the teaching. We know plenty of higher ed folks who lecture their math for 2.5 hrs and can’t teach well too.
@FakeMathPhd I’d agree with you except baking and creating one’s own beers and drugs are on the rise.
RT @christinaixchel: There is one Black male teacher in the entire early education department at the district I teach for. 		One. 		As it s…
@FakeMathPhd I wouldn’t argue that. Pedagogy and, especially the building relationships part, isn’t always gonna show up in the books. Also, it explains why so much of America thinks math is important, but people are still afraid of fractions.
@MoniseLSeward … I’m down with algebra as well. Yeah, you know me.
@FakeMathPhd So of course, I’m gonna flip that and say that those who get degrees in mathematics have limited pedagogical knowledge. And I fear that too many in the scenario I lay out get less respect that those in the scenario you lay out.
In the math field, people don’t give enough attention to the necessary conditions and pedagogies that ensure math success for the long term. In so many ways, the critical consciousness around math has stagnated, in no small part to the perception of math as a static subject.
This article signals to me how critical the work of teachers of math for younger ages is just as critical as the work of math specialists. #mtbos #mathchat 		https://t.co/B2eVfAQ9z4

I do draw the line where folks wanna be mean to kids, but sometimes our institutions (and the people who espouse them) need to hear how they’re harming education and the students in their space, and sometimes, it requires “meanness.”
Meanness is contextual, too. 		There’s folks who are super-mean but know their taxes are going toward infrastructure and schools and others who bake cookies for their marginalized kids while voting for Trump. 		Pro-tip: mean means many things.

@SHODesusAndMero The Timbs crossed with a 💪🏾
@Lexiconup I said this then, and I’ll say it now. They should take their words home and think it through, or the next thread I write might be about you ...
@rlawsum I mean, I’ll always stand in my own power, but these institutions must change for the people coming after me.
@mcclemnaz It used to mean that you had a certain level of social consciousness and awareness, but that got lost along the way for a performance, a diluted rendition etc.
@Lexiconup … I got em stuck off the realness. We be the infamous, you heard of us.
Whether you’re a big institution like NCTM or any number of smaller collectives / orgs like TMC, #MTBoS, #iteachmath, etc., we still see the experiences and concerns of POC as unimportant.		It’s akin to second-class citizenship in this country. So be it.
And I’d sit there talking to @RafranzDavis @graceachen @profnicolej and so many other math POC, wondering when we’d get to real change. 		Then Marian got on the board of TMC. But the questions remained: what does institutional change mean?
People would say things to me like “Oh, we already do this at my school,” but then I had questions. Why invite me if this space was already woke? Why does race and social justice work only show up when it’s time to talk around people of color, not around fellow white people?
I’d felt isolated since. When my colleagues finally deemed it appropriate to discuss social and racial justice, I nodded and said that I’d help do the work. Suddenly, however, it also felt like the performance of social justice was at a premium, instead of the institutional work.
When I first started blogging about a decade ago, I wanted to write about three things: math, race, and NYC. Due to the severe gap in edu around the latter two, I negated some of the first. That also gave people a pathway to negate my mathematical acumen. 		Wild.
I haven’t said anything aloud about this all day, because it reminds me how often POC, esp. black and brown educators, don’t feel welcome in predominantly white math spaces. Our pedagogies are tertiary at best. 		Let’s reflect. https://t.co/rYZKSbnUIa

@Dart_Adams It's also a few days before the trade deadline. Not that it matters because the NBA has a serious competition problem.
@MsPackyetti Forever ever.
@KSukEDUC Exactly!
A reminder:		Woodson never meant for #BHM to be for a limited time. He envisioned that this was a pathway to bring awareness to Black history throughout the curriculum. 		We're still having this discussion because we still treat Black history as "other."

@NYCComptroller @mkink 🔥🔥🔥
@brittanbeck @sciresSoehl @NYCMayor Yeah. And I’m empathetic to those who need schools open to feel heat. I was one of those kids back in my childhood. I also believe we need to have a more sophisticated plan than just keeping schools open, esp. because so many of our kids *have to* go outside to get inside.
@ChuckModi1 @E_Reid35 “The door’s right there. I don’t know why Kaepernick doesn’t just walk right through it, throw a football, and put on a uniform. Who’s gonna stop him?”
@brittanbeck @sciresSoehl @NYCMayor Right? Our building is 100+ years old. Some rooms don’t have heat.
@nhannahjones Infuriating.
@sciresSoehl @NYCMayor So then we call them accessible heating centers.
@MrKitMath Right.

Too many of the people with “solutions” really want to double down on the inhumanity and call it “progress,” which is often more deleterious and asphyxiating for our most marginalized children. 		We can do and dream better. Really.
Whenever I get the inclination to blame school issues on individuals, I’m reminded that our school system works practically as intended. The inhumanity and callousness we see in our interactions were set there to ensure inequity. 		Our systems need a transformation.

@cjokay Yes. Don’t forget the racism. Today, I’m re-reading about his visit to NYC and getting angry all over again at how ppl didn’t see the connection between the struggle for civil rights and the struggle against the Vietnam War.
@vmanvega @msangieb31 @ShanaVWhite In NY, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity won a case where every NY school was supposed to receive full funding for their schools. Yet, our governor decided to funnel monies that made it look like NY had the highest per-student spending in the country. 		🤔🤔🤔
Thread for the uninitiated. Get with it. #EduColor https://t.co/9knfknEkGA
@ShanaVWhite RIGHT?!?!?!
@vmanvega @msangieb31 @ShanaVWhite I don’t disagree. But she’s not arguing against economic rights. She’s arguing against the facile argument that more money means more rights.
@vmanvega @msangieb31 @ShanaVWhite You misread. 		What she’s saying is that we gotta assure that we have more money ALONG with the right policies to ensure that our monies are used properly. For ex, using money for a third party vendor that’s unresponsive to the needs of the school is ineffective.

@chrislehmann @nate_bowling @TheGeeScott Of course. But you know I’m gonna have to slam that Serena card on the table when it comes up. 😂
@chrislehmann @nate_bowling @TheGeeScott ... we probably need to recalibrate this argument to account for gender and race here. To say Serena (and women sport greats) has been underrated is an understatement.
@chrislehmann @nate_bowling @TheGeeScott Right. So my point in saying that is she’s dominated so hard that even her losses were wins.
Buenos días, mi gente! Coffee and breakfast on deck.		Who are your MLKs of the day? Let’s acknowledge the people who, in their space and time, consistently push for the world to do better by the oppressed and marginalized. Movement is about moving us. 		This is our moment.
@chrislehmann @nate_bowling @TheGeeScott I know. And I tried but it ain’t even close. The way she makes everyone have to up their game has been astounding for the sport.
@Okaikor He might be right tho. His way of life and thinking are expiring; a new way is possible. That’s dangerous for a lot of the folks we dissent against.

@DulceFlecha @ChrisThinnes @ShawnaCoppola @arcticisleteach It’s also a different paradigm than “let me feed you followers in exchange for branding and loyalty.” It’s like, “Actually, we can do this hard work better together."		It’s a belief in building capacity for movement building through relationship and mutual care.
@DulceFlecha @ChrisThinnes @ShawnaCoppola @arcticisleteach I’m still trying to figure that out myself. We’re still waiting for people with 60K+ followers in EduTwitter to be responsive to the concerns of the marginalized, and to no avail. 		It boggles the mind.
@ChrisThinnes @DulceFlecha @ShawnaCoppola @arcticisleteach That was my next implied step, but, whenever I test that theory, folks aren’t ready for iconoclasm.

@Penny_Ten @MrPatelsAwesome @atomheld @ASTsupportAAli The short answer is that there are those of us who have consistently connected the things we say on Twitter with what we do and say outside of here.		The long answer is simple not easy. It’s a multi-pronged approach of building capacity, creating policy, and changing pedagogy.

@msangieb31 @ShanaVWhite You just did. 😊
@kearneys20 YES!
What’s weird about this work is that there’s too many people saying “We already do this” and not enough saying “We’re nowhere near redressing the concerns of our most marginalized students, parents, and teachers.” 		Y’all don’t hear me, though.
@AlanProtek @JOEL9ONE I *am* going to Philadelphia next week, so maybe we can get a whole set of educators to listen to how he works through this. Thanks, Alan!
@noodlette Happy for you, truly, but two things:		1) There’s anti-bias curriculum in a lot more places than Berkeley, CA and		2) It doesn’t change the idea that we need to change the critical consciousness of our country and institutions that continue to marginalize so many of our youth.
@nate_bowling Kind of a big deal, my guy.
@MaraGay @bradlander I sincerely hope so.
@MomAshour For sure. We got a LONG way to go before we rectify these harms, but I appreciate some of the efforts out there. :-)
@MomAshour I hear good things about what @WCPSS has been doing, and I know first hand that @NYCSchools @OaklandSchools and @BostonSchools are trying to address it as well. But it’s just started. 		We got a few more years til we see real results.
@GManfan64 @Russocrat @JOEL9ONE I’m gonna ask us to be mindful that we don’t wanna do a community project until the young folks have had the conversation about the racist, ageist, supremacist harm done. 		We owe it to the injured party. That’s the hard work.
@MomAshour Some of it starts with what you’re doing now: asking the questions. Also, if you can, build up folks like us to lead the conversations and move those relationships. We need to get to a space where we can heal the hurt systemically.
@JOEL9ONE You, more than a lot of folks, have the opportunity to speak truth without setting off the initial alarms and you know this well. 		Here’s hoping the folks who are reluctant to take those initial steps can look at you and say “I can do better too.” As y’all say: a game of inches.
@JOEL9ONE I mean, I can only do so much when I have them for about a year or so, but with the right changes in a community, I’m willing to consider progress. We all got good work to do.
@JOEL9ONE And I hope they take the proper steps to reflect and reconcile with their dehumanizing behaviors.
@darrenpuscas @nicole_soojung The Chiefs. A “Tribe.” Totem poles. Alladat.
@Ayako1Sato I’d say that many parents do, just not the one some of us prefer.
None of this work is perfect or easy. All of this work is necessary for everyone involved. Our children, even the ones who commit racist acts, are reflections of the images our society built. 		We have work to do in and out of the classroom. The movement must live.
We need a deconstruction to “wokeness” in education, too. I’m not as concerned with the trolls and dog avis every time I bring up dead Black children. 		I worry when people create a performance for branding or, at least, to stave off the conversation of complicity. 		You, too.
We want to fix racism through education the easy way: field trips, authors of color, teachers of color, books, and the plethora of one-shot PDs.		We shouldn’t abandon any of these initiatives, but if we treat any of these as accessory and not core to movement, we lose.
Giving children “an education” is not enough. “Exposing" them to different cultures is not enough. We need an anti-racist education movement. 		We can change the people, the structures, and the curriculum all we like. Without shifting the critical consciousness, we won’t move.

It’s not that there’s no money for schools. It’s that our society has chosen to keep our schools inequitable.  		It’s no wonder why there’s been so much pushback from parents, educators, and students. Without mass mobilization, our society is satisfied with the inequity.

NYC at times suffers from extreme isolation, so it's good to go to national conferences with teachers from different districts to learn completely new frameworks where a book can't do that energy justice.

@njkraai @ChristieNold FWIW, my legacy on Twitter will be of having any number of trolls and miscreants flood my timeline with hurtful images of black / Latinx / NA / POC bodies getting murdered, and all the educators complicit vis-a-vis "both sides" BS. 		This is a conversation on power.
@njkraai @ChristieNold Comfort shouldn't be the objective, if you're asking me. Common experiences, but also a vision and imagination rooted in those experiences. Truth is at a premium on this platform, not as a weapon, but as a means of uprooting that which hurts.
Every so often, we need to flex because I learned in 2018 that the work doesn't always speak for itself. Even if you disagree with his point, everything he's saying is factual.		GOAT talk. https://t.co/vscUBcw8tw
@djolder Also, look at the picture they're using to make their point. The levels.
@njkraai @ChristieNold The blueprint really is about the people first. Even when it wasn't related to race ostensibly, we still dealt with controversial topics nimbly because of the relationships.
@njkraai @ChristieNold It starts with the conversations. At the time, #EduColor noticed severe gaps in the conversation about race and social justice in other hashtags. We collected the people. We had earnest questions. We told the stories of the marginalized. We were consistently there for ppl.

2019 is a good year as any to remind people that the platforms espoused by educators directly and indirectly impacts the students we purport to serve. 		Our kids don’t deserve these walls, neither the physical or political ones.
Back in 2016, some of my colleagues said, “What’s wrong with voting for the racist, sexist, xenophobic fascist?”		Then, racist, sexist, xenophobic and fascist things started happening. Our kids witnessed it. My colleagues kept teaching as if their votes had no connection to them.

Good morning, my people.		Given what's happening across the country, I'm thankful I have a job to come back to, and it's a job that I'm passionate about. Take not for granted that we had a break so we can refuel for this physical and emotional investment.		We got this, my ppl.
@MoniseLSeward Word.
@averagejuana https://t.co/dM5zccJFtM
@jfreewright And by “save,” he means it enriched the folks who were already wealthy and further stratifies the well and not-well-resourced. Amazing.
@GersonBorrero And by “social justice agenda,” he means doing things that look SJ on the surface through neoliberal methods underneath. 		So it won’t hurt the bottom line.
@ProfChrisMJones AND speak up and out about school wide / districtwide / citywide / nationwide policies that keep professionals from being professional.
Good teaching is doing exactly what every other teacher is doing in every classroom from the big book of best practices at the same exact time. https://t.co/rYjF5M6KHa
@clanghoff1 Or just computers.
@AOC The shade. https://t.co/f1PCpHiPkE
@actualham it’s cool. I understand tenure is being eroded there, too. It’s just something worth thinking about.
@actualham In PK-12 land, ppl can use any number of things, esp. w/ the Danielson checklist-thats-not-a-checklist, to come after teachers. And academic autonomy / professional judgment has been eroded due to neoliberal suite of reforms.
@actualham The difference for me is that tenure used in general society leans more towards what we might see in higher ed: academic autonomy, strong job protections, etc. In PK - 12, tenure just means that, should someone want to fire you, they gotta make a good case. (1/?)
@actualham I prefer to call it “due process.” And, with the way things are changing, even due process is specious at best.

@Rustin3000 What a blessing, man.
@thatgirlmystic facts.
Often, good teaching is teaching subversively. 		When compulsory policies and practices don’t align with what the students actually respond to, we have to shift our policies and practices. 		It usually means we’re risking our ratings and positions, but it’s worth doing well.

@EdgeofSports Happy birthday!
Good morning, my people.		I wish for everyone, critics and friends alike, more phone calls and direct messages. Too much of what passes for dialogue on here is deft legerdemain. Most of that falls apart when we get more human. 		Keep That Same Energy 2019. We got this, too.
@CodyMillerELA Congrats!

@peraltaprjct @cocothedivine Hahaha aiyyo.
@Kayke_CaraPeca As a matter of fact, Bad Boy is probably responsible for most of my music catalogue being so old school. Samples ARE the goldmine. https://t.co/4EPy6foTvF
@YeshaCallahan https://t.co/kxmYWkZ6DA
@JYDoug @EduColorMVMT I’m saying!
@TheWeirdTeacher @marknkilmer @shareski Right. It’s a vacant positivity, as if the work just sprung forth from the ether.
Dreaming awake at night. #EduColor
@ProfesoraEspana @DulceFlecha @biblio_phile I’m sorry.
@biblio_phile my toes curled from seeing that.
@FroMagnum__ Alladem! https://t.co/MA22NcD5rf
Read this, #EduColor. Re-read it for all the conferences we be at. https://t.co/9ZTV9M1jJw
@jaycaspiankang yes. and … still, my guy.
@jaycaspiankang savage.
@jonbecker @shareski @spencerideas … it’s too soon. #NYC #Queens #triggering
@shareski @spencerideas Mmmmhmmmm.
@AFROAMPHD Will do, and thank you as well.
@AFROAMPHD Con-Ed electrical explosion in Queens.
@shareski @spencerideas Yep. And who do we blame: the content creators or the audience for following it? These are the questions.
@TweetBenMax Great. There goes the media blaming things on the Left again.
@apadillafilm6 I hope so too. Trying to keep up just like you.
@Lexialex It’s real. ConEd electrical emergency in Queens.
@spencerideas @shareski Also, that it’s done mainly for metrics and the like. But I guess it’s also about what you value.
@Its_Velez @moneymichael719 -nods- Big deal.

@nenagerman Same.
@mel_katzz @haymarketbooks YES!

@calliembush @EduColorMVMT -daps-
@msjosephsci It’s still on! :-)
A6: I struggled with not letting folks take me out of my element, especially at work. Being an educator of color *and* conscience is tough when our ratings are based on compliance. But the kids and I made it together. #EduColor https://t.co/ddmiNpx7r5
@JasenThorpe FACTS!!! #EduColor
@mel_katzz Thank you for this, Mel. We got some beautiful things to do. #EduColor
@SweetyP21 @EduColorMVMT That’s beautiful. #EduColor
@biblio_phile Just amazing. Glad we closed that circle. #EduColor
A4: What surprised me this year was, even after some of the L’s I took, I collected enough W’s to make up for them. It kept me in the classroom one more year.  #EduColor https://t.co/xMNkubwo2A
@mel_katzz That word “yet” is operative here. There were some losses this year … and we’re here to tell that story. #EduColor
A5: I have several, but really: meeting @biblio_phile for the first time. That closed a circle for me.  Also, my blog was unblocked from NYC DOE schools this year even after the TED talk I did in front of the chancellor. 😂 #EduColor https://t.co/QRnLo5IOKt

@Mrs_Matsalia That’s so dope. #EduColor
@caitteach It’s cool. Come through when you can. #EduColor
@MisterMinor yeah. One day, we’ll have that conversation, too. #EduColor
@biblio_phile It means that, if I’m imagining something, I make myself an agent in making that imagination into a reality. It’s a lot of work, but I’m willing to do that. As you’re well aware. #EduColor
@biblio_phile @yamilb12 @EduColorMVMT Sending love here. #EduColor
A3: My biggest fear was also my biggest hope: that I wouldn’t have the fight in me after all the nonsense of 2017 on a professional and personal level. Glad I dreamt forward. #EduColor https://t.co/A5M6OSHri4
@biblio_phile I brought that back more this year, esp. because of my school does not do a good job with this element. #educolor
A2: Normally, I like to have conversations before or after class where I just listen to students riff on any number of topics. Or I’ll record something in my mind of what a student said that stuck with me. #EduColor https://t.co/6xU7jv26tX

@biblio_phile @knikole The fact that you’re tweeting now is a miracle. Just stay tweeting. That would be enough. #EduColor
@PresidentPat Unplugging is hard when you’ve chosen this as your passion, too. #EduColor

@zcrockett53 Yes, that. It’s complicated for sure. Glad Harper Lee left us with something to truly consider.
@CsweeneyArtist I’m a fan too. I just learned to read with a full breadth of literary techniques. I suggest you do the same.
@EducatingDrew Ah I get it now. Yes, that.
@CsweeneyArtist If it merits so. TKAM has a much more ubiquitous place in the literary canon.
@EducatingDrew Ah. Let me backtrack. What do you mean by “working through his truth?” Thought it was evident what his trajectory was.
What so many of my colleagues of color who teach this book have surfaced is that everyone wants Atticus Finch to be their hero because he, no matter fictional, exemplifies their own innocence in what we call America, rather than their own complicity. 		A truly American work.
@CsweeneyArtist Nah, you did. Quit the hyperbole. Observe: https://t.co/26axIvNAmJ
@EducatingDrew https://t.co/26axIvNAmJ
@CsweeneyArtist ... you said Gregory Peck because you didn’t read the book. Stick to anonymity.

@PresidentPat It depends on whose on it, what the moderator does with it, and what the topic is. The pedagogy there is critical.
Atticus Finch aided and abetted the status quo, reinforcing narratives of white purity for the sake of preserving his own worldview. What’s more, he squashed the potential of his children to be anti-racist collaborators for the express purpose of “civility.”		A lesson for today. https://t.co/tk1CHY2L1d

@CrownVictoria22 Yes. Still a hit! Thank you!
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree I lied about an actual program with an actual title that you can search and see for yourself? Man, conservatism has really lost its way. You can’t even do “right” right.
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree But how does no one notice when I’m literally writing on Twitter?
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree You’re just gonna have to take the L. I literally told you the program and the title under the program and you’re just gonna stick to it. https://t.co/huShMYWzxj

@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree Says the guy who is out here seeking proof from a still anonymous twitter handle. Website or not, you’re on the thinnest of ice.
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree It says Math for America MT, as in Master Teacher. Observe how I’m schooling you for ex.
@bodega_gyro_ao We HAVE TO!
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree If? My guy. Not only is there a a website but a face and a name and a set of Google reference and thousands of kids. Don’t do this. 		Also, if you actually did the research, you’d see the results. Right there. Her name is deep in B-More.
@mathinct678 We be outchea!
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree I’d say “pot meet kettle” but I ain’t trolling. Your specious argument about an EdD and the existence of one shows how we shouldn’t take your seriously in the least.
@nandtpolitics @Ed2BeFree How are you gonna talk about “no record” when you’re literally making yourself anonymous? How are you gonna ask for proof of degree, which I can testify to, when there’s no proof of there being an actual person here?

@tanzinavega This!
@LtDan757 @rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold I don’t know how you sending me a tweet that appears clueless about the hours-long conversation is saving me, but ima let you finish. 		FWIW, I got tagged in for my expertise on race and education conversations. You’re out of your depth on this one.
@nenagerman @ShanaVWhite https://t.co/lkQrJ7bqI7
@LtDan757 @rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Because I’ve been on this platform for more than a decade, I can tell you on record that I’ve handled situations like this more gracefully and with more self awareness than what’s been demonstrated here. 		I know you thought you were coming to the rescue but this ain’t that.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Because what you see as “destructive” is us telling you directly the ways that you need to adjust your race practice.		We’re asking you questions about your work, helping you correct your paper, and asking you to turn in your work later until you get it. 		https://t.co/qzxgWVAAtL
@rickwormeli2 @ChristieNold @ShanaVWhite I hope that’s an apology. And please: no “I’m sorry you …”
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold The fact that people are literally saying “We’re not judging you based on the fact that you’re a white man, but on your ideas” is mighty gracious of people here. 		I’ma let you reflect, though. Let us (And I do mean us) know when you’ve done so.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold And I’m not saying that YOU were the keynote for these PD sessions, but I would bet my life’s savings that, before you started speaking up on race at all, the POC in your space who spoke on race were often isolated, blackballed, and disregarded.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Also note that these educators who’ve spoken up on race are often the first to get piled on when they speak on race issues or bring up the race issues in PD sessions with white speakers who don’t wanna bring up race. That’s a real dynamic, too.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Rick, sit with that for a minute because that’s the lived experience of POC in our country daily. The fact that Lorena, Shana, Christie, and everyone else felt like telling you to your face is a BLESSING.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold If you really read my work, you would have caught the vast resources we’ve supplied: https://t.co/pp4ofpgSpQ		And how open we’re being in conversation. Christie literally wrote “suggest” like 3 times. Step away from this conversation and look again. 		Be thankful they engaged.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold We have white educators in our midst who we’ve considered allies in this work. The first step might have been defensiveness, but the second and third was reflection and probing. They sat in that, wondering why all these POC openly had questions about their actions.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Rick, what I’m witnessing is folks who’ve actually done this race / education work across platforms trying to guide you towards being more helpful because otherwise, they wouldn’t take the time to respond to you.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold The idea that you’d intimate that some of the leading voices in race and  education are unprofessional feels like you’re not trying to sit with the idea that, in these instances, you’re not reflective at all. Not just in your disposition, but your relation to dissenting voices.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Rick, if you truly held my work in high regard, you’d note that I don’t speak out on things without doing deep interrogation of my own flaws and biases so I never step into something with authority w/o humbly consulting critical perspectives. I’m not seeing that.
@rickwormeli2 @ChristieNold @nenagerman @TooDopeTeachers @ShanaVWhite @ILASCD @TribeTeachers @juliaerin80 @EduColorMVMT But the fifth link on the Google search I gave you was to this: https://t.co/NvNIWalj38.

For more, please click here. https://t.co/cPUertTMso
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Your responses are literally the antithesis of allyship and your defensiveness seems to arise from a serious lack of reflection.		POC are literally taking the time to tell you that you’re misrepresenting this work relationally and you’re simply replicating the dynamic.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold Yes, and what people are trying to get you to see is that the tools, perspectives, and courage you profess to share with others are things you need to sit on for yourself. AND (1/2)
@rickwormeli2 @ChristieNold @nenagerman @TooDopeTeachers @ShanaVWhite @ILASCD @TribeTeachers @juliaerin80 @EduColorMVMT Rick, you could have done this yourself. https://t.co/zaLpUIRrOJ
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold It’s critical that, for white folks who’ve built that trust through self-reflection and the actual work, to speak to other white folks about racism because the burden is too often placed on POC to have to explain our humanity.
@rickwormeli2 @ShanaVWhite @ChristieNold As I said, I’ve been doing this for more than a decade and I’m tired of trying to tell white folks, especially folks aren’t being reflective from a race / relational standpoint, about how racism and all its branches affect me. And so ...

@haymarketbooks So: I don’t envy people who can write books without considering the craft and the depth of the work. I marvel. 		As with most of education, the numbers tell different stories depending on how they’re used. 		Let’s dig into those stories.
For some of us, tragedy is the gravity in our works. 		So thankful to @haymarketbooks because it’s more than believing in the vision. It’s believing that the book should be alive.
My father was present once a year for a few days at a time, sometimes skipping a year. I only recently stopped seeing him when I looked in the mirror. He had any number of different projects (including children) he started, but never saw to fruition. 		I had to finish and well.
There was a recent conversation around here about education books, which reminded me that five years ago, I almost quit writing mine. My father’s passing was the last straw among many personal and professional L’s I took that year. 		For some of us, our books are the lifeline.

Good morning, my people. 		It’s Friday. I barely slept last night, but the morning is here, ready for us. How many of us are the fire starters in the best ways for our staff and students?

@christinaixchel Good to know!
@christinaixchel 1st?
@stumpteacher @karlfisch @shareski @willrich45 hahaha it won’t, but you’ll send me a pre-release copy right?
@stumpteacher @karlfisch @shareski @willrich45 Twitter’s great for me, even when my mentions are flooded with fascists, sexists, and apologists. It’s been my PD in lieu of the nonsense in my district. Oh, and it’s probably the best place for me to draft ideas for my next fantastic book. 😂
Back to Black, because y’all know me. https://t.co/Z1rLBGDm3i
@AintNoJigga I’ll disagree with Friends. Feel like Apeshit is still underrated.
@msdanifernandez It’s the #PolyamoryChallenge!
@karlfisch @willrich45 @shareski Correct! And that’s the tension. Glad we’re exploring that right here.
@shareski @willrich45 @karlfisch Mmmmhmmm. 		And ultimately, we both need a set of folks willing to engage in deeper conversations, whatever conversation that may be for them, *and* publishers willing to make way as they seem to have done with other burgeoning writers.
@karlfisch @willrich45 @shareski That wasn’t a negation, merely that people have built a certain following. That hasn’t always led to inclusion across racial / gender / sexual orientation  / intersectional lines, but it’s helped to sell a lot of books. Observations are real out here.
@daniellitaa I peeped that.
@willrich45 @karlfisch @shareski On another note, there are def. books that are about building up the choir while others have grounded stories to tell about our work. We mustn’t forget that publishers are seeking more instructional guides than narrative-driven texts as well.

@Klind2013 @MrTomRad I mean sure, but I'm also getting at any and all unpaid work, and how transparency is critical to all of this.

Good morning, my people. Coffee and grading on deck.		This is a not-so-gentle reminder of the difficulty of this work. We inspire each other not for the adulation, but because our system's machinations generally don't raise us up, so we do it ourselves. 		That's why we got this.

The point isn’t the keynote / panel / workshop / invite. It’s about assuring that nothing about us without us is for us.		Nothing about us without us is for us.
There’s definitive power in someone who can, at once, tell someone whether a policy, initiative, or policy works because it directly affects their profession, their spaces of learning and teaching. Especially for our most marginalized peoples.
I still have this belief that educators can share space with other luminaries in and out of edu-spaces and still have equal footing, and that teachers ought to have opportunities to speak in front of folks they’re not “supposed to."		Also, I believe the same about students.

We can’t, at once, say we’re about equity when we’re really about numbers attained through constant drilling and dehumanizing practices for the express purpose of pleasing funders and ill-meaning outsiders. 		And then we get mad when so-called gaps aren’t closed.

@mutalenkonde @nate_bowling @nhannahjones Nah, it’s fine. It’s in the replies to the tweet.
@David_desJ @averypickford a) My work has mainly about changing narratives. 		and 		b) You’d ask a question instead of making false assumptions about silos and the like.		So having said that, you’re basically here to clarify your own views by telling other folks that their opinions are stupid? 		Well, OK.
The proliferation of the conversations-as-silos theories ignores the folks I’ve known who’ve been able to move people in a critical way. We do ourselves a disservice by stating that other people will never change instead of asking better questions of ourselves and each other.
@David_desJ @averypickford … which is wild because the bulk of this platform is about swaying opinions which, since you don’t know my work, is what I’ve been able to do with good success. 		And since I’ve seen a lot of your recent tweets, I’d have to ask why you tweet, then.
@David_desJ @averypickford … I’m not sure of the point you’re trying to make, but if you think there’s a “happy medium” between a war criminal and a red herring, then OK.

@LisaNewmanBHS @ValeriaBrownEdu I wasn’t trying to, just wanna appreciate Val and the work she puts in.
I’m really sitting here wondering how we get people to go deeper than “good” and “bad” and ask better questions that purport to serve us and our democracy.
@LeeAnnTGraham Work with your colleagues and administrators. Seriously. What socioemotional supports and restorative practices are at your school that can help lessen the hurt? 		Also, to your earlier points, sounds like there’s way more at play than just basketball and social media.
How we speak about students and the institutions that supposedly serve them is very telling.
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton Some:		How often does every student get the opportunity to discuss their narrative?	How often does our school support students to truly find their passions?	How many of my colleagues support a deficit vs a strengths based approach to relationships with students?
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton I noticed it wasn’t eroded and you missed Nikole’s point. Listening to our students’ parents, as you’re well aware, is critical to this work.
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton When we go for facile stereotypes about our students, it usually means we need to ask better questions, mainly of ourselves.
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton Even on my toughest classes, I would never assume they don’t “care” about education more than being ball players or social media stars. That’s a recipe for deficit thinking and for the vast majority of my kids, it’s simply untrue.
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton Even though they might loudly proclaim they’re gonna be famous, as so many folks are wont to do, when you actually ask them, they have profession and sincere aspirations. Whether that system and school and adults allow is another matter.
@LeeAnnTGraham @nhannahjones @DarrickHamilton As a classroom teacher, I can’t stand by this. I’ve found that, when we’re frustrated with what’s happening in our environments, we allow for arguments about students’ emphasis on education to erode our view of them.
