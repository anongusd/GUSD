In testimony before the House Oversight committee, Michael Cohen says he is cooperating on another unspecified investigation out of New York that involves Trump. https://t.co/7maUDhI3Pv … via @@nicole_hong on the @WSJ live blog.
@renato_mariotti @MarkMeadows But in fairness, prosecutors don't operate under the time constraints of a member with just a few minutes trying to question a hostile witness in a hearing. It's a bipartisan tradition in these types of hearings to control the time and stop a witness from filibustering.
@MikeSacksEsq @BradMossEsq You could find a way to accommodate the desire for members to ask questions with substantive blocs of questions from professional lawyers. You could do an hour or two of alternating questions from counsel first, and then let each member have 5-10 minutes if the wanted.
@BradMossEsq I don't know why this fell out of favor, but using committee counsel for questioning seems like a best practice that someone should bring back. And 20-30 minute alternating increments, not 10 minutes.

By and large, both parties in Congress have seen almost all recent subpoena fights through a partisan lens rather than an institutional lens. The result has severely weakened what should be a tool of congressional power.
4.) Eric Holder refused House subpoena. Unsurprisingly his DOJ decided not to prosecute and civil litigation is STILL ongoing.	5.) IRS commissioner Lois Lerner refused to testify. She was referred for prosecution, which was declined by Obama admin.
Let's review recent history:	1.) Clinton IT aide Bryan Pagliano refused a House subpoena. No consequence.	2.) Steve Bannon refused to answer questions under House subpoena.  No consequence.	3.) Bush White House refused subpoenas on US attorney scandal. No serious consequence.
One of these days, Congress will dust off its inherent contempt power to enforce its subpoenas (by arresting a witness or flexing its spending power).

A number of senators at the Kavanaugh hearings have praise the First Amendment right to protest. Strange dissonance because the protesters are being arrested and charged with crimes.
Senate Democrats dared Republicans to punish them for releasing confidential information but they're not likely to face any serious consequences. Here's why. https://t.co/fX8b4wbZfo via @WSJ
The real question is how will congressional access to documents erode? Between House Republicans releasing the identify of intelligence informants and Senate Democrats releasing privileged material their body promised to protect, Congress may suffer long-term access consequences.
See: Gravel v. United States on the wide scope of congressional immunity over the release of classified information. (Does not mean a member could not/would not be expelled for a very egregious breach, but probably no prosecution.)	https://t.co/4Mgih2bIeh
Let's all simmer down about consequences of releasing confidential docs.	1.) Expulsion takes two-thirds of the Senate. Democrats have 49 seats.	2.) Even if a Senator read out highly-classified troop moments on the Senate floor, they're probably immune from criminal penalty.
Booker dares Republicans to discipline them for breaking Senate rules by releasing confidential information: "Apply the rule. Bring the charges."

@jbarro Yea. But it would work much better if you didn't have to walk nearly a quarter of a mile from Union Station through a parking garage to get to it. Or if it went all the way downtown in its own lane. They screwed up the planning.
@jbarro I think I could imagine a history where they got their own lanes that some point. That's what Boston did. Second, even the trams in European cities that run in mixed traffic are substantially more pleasant to ride than buses. I'm not sure why.
@authoridad Buses, mostly and the rise of the ownership of private automobiles. And yea, a boom in highway construction that facilitated suburban living (and white flight.)

That expanded mandate ended up being seen by historians as a mistake and led to a bipartisan backlash against the entire institution of the independent counsel, which is gone. The law underpinning it expired in 1999.
Starr was charged with investigating Whitewater. When his prosecutors got word of a possible conspiracy by the president and his aides regarding the testimony of an intern in an unrelated civil case, they robustly argued to expand their mandate.
In this bizarro-world, the Cohen case was referred from a special counsel who determined it was out of its jurisdiction. Sticking to your jurisdiction as a matter of political survival seems to be a lesson that Mueller has learned from Ken Starr.
The entire point of special counsels is so that the Justice Department doesn't have to deal with situations like having Trump appointees decide what to do about their nominal boss being implicated in a crime.

The regulations governing Mueller are clearly designed to address some of those concerns, so it's not clear if Kavanaugh would be satisfied with the current arrangement.
Lots of Republicans and Democrats hated the independent counsel in the 1990s, which is why it was allowed to expire. Many believed that the law created a de facto fourth branch of government accountable to no one.
It's not clear what Kavanaugh thinks of the legality of the Mueller arrangement. Mueller is not an independent counsel, he's a special counsel who reports to DOJ leadership.

@ChrisMegerian @latimes Glad to hear it!
The situation Comey finds himself in — arguing about the government's post-facto classification decisions about material he considers personal — is oddly analogous to the Clinton email situation his FBI investigated.  https://t.co/Rvky9QebTQ
@qjurecic Yup. And in that one, Comey made redactions. After he left FBI, one was later upclassified from "unclassified" to "Confidential."
The government now views two memos Comey gave to his friend Daniel Richman as classified. Comey knew one was classified and made redactions. The other was upgraded from unclassified to "confidential" after he left government by other officials.  https://t.co/pT9CLXdZWI
BREAKING: At least two of the memos Comey gave to a friend outside of government are now considered classified by officials, prompting a review by a Dept. of Justice watchdog. https://t.co/hyIQDH9Tsf
@bendreyfuss Some of those are nice! The UAE is fine. Vietnam is lovely. Taiwan is fine.
In that interview with Fox, Richman is quoted as saying that everything he possessed was unclassified. Then Fox paraphrases him as saying that he got four memos. Two of the memos are explicitly marked UNCLASSIFIED. And we know know those two memos totaled 4 *pages.*
The case Comey leaked classified information boils down to: Comey wrote 7 memos. Four had classified material. Ergo, if he gave four memos to Richman, at least one of those must have had classified information. But the only source for that is a single report.
This is important because four of Comey's memos contained material that is now deemed classified. Even Comey himself appeared to realize some of the material was classified as he wrote the memos. He appended this note to the top of his first memo. https://t.co/duwUFxQF7I

The practical political hurdles of a Republican Congress taking away a Republican president's trade authority are real. But its Congress that can set U.S. trade policy if Congress wants.
There's a lot of hand-wringing and ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  on the Hill about trade, but it's Congress that has the sole constitutional authority to regulate trade. The presidential authority being invoked by Trump stems from powers Congress has delegated and powers Congress could revoke.

The House used information in the Trump administration's possession to compose the memo. But all along, the classification power for all of that information has always rested squarely with Trump.
A president has the unilateral and unreviewable authority to declassify information at will. Congress wrote into its rules a way for it to release classified information over the objection of the executive, but it has no power to *declassify* the information. See the difference?
It's true, Congress has written into law penalties for unauthorized release of classified information. But the whole system of classification is based on executive order, not congressionally-enacted statute.
In this whole #ReleaseTheMemo debate, remember that the entire system of classified information is built on executive authority of the president, not on laws enacted by Congress.

Despite being a major figure in D.C. for decades, Graham has never gotten her due in film and "The Post" works well as a slice-of-life biopic. And she made a very difficult decision to publish in the face of a very aggressive DOJ.
Finally saw "The Post," which I thought was good. I think it made adequately clear that Neil Sheehan of the New York Times very clearly and unambiguously had the Pentagon Papers first.

@JWGOP @seanmdav Eh. I'm not going to let this kind of hyperbole about journalists willfully misleading their readers stand from people who should know better.

And moreover @seanmdav owes me an apology for saying that I willfully mislead my readers when the committee's rules explicitly allow info-sharing.
I'm not going to pretend this isn't complicated. But he is clearly wrong that there is any sort of blanket ban on info-sharing between the intelligence committee and the Senate/Intelligence agencies.
Rule 12(a)(3)(F) is a blanket grant that allows for discussion and disclosure "as otherwise directed by the Committee." https://t.co/tk5PVZ9A3E

Senate intelligence panel leaders makes plea to strip 'troublesome' spying measure from spending bill https://t.co/4aeP74a1rl
UPDATE: Sen. Thad Cochran objects, provision will remain. Burr yields back "with great disappointment."
Burr and his Democratic counterpart Mark Warner are asking for unanimous consent to replace the intelligence provision with language crafted by intelligence committee leaders in both the House and Senate.
On the Senate floor, Richard Burr says there is an intelligence spending provision in the CR that he finds "troublesome" — that allows White House to spend intelligence funds on programs not explicitly authorized by Congress.
"Today, we drink seltzer," Sen. Schumer says.
Angus King says it’s his understanding there are the Democratic vote to reopen the government, ending shutdown.
Democrats tight-lipped coming out of their caucus meeting but Sen. Chris Coons said it was important to take a “step forward” — making it sound like a deal has been reached.
An FBI spokesman says the bureau has requested a copy of the House Intelligence committee-penned memo on purported FISA abuses. “To date, the request has been declined,” FBI says.

@RadioFreeTom @emptywheel I have no objection to quoting experts of varying levels of passion and advocacy. They often help me understand complicated things. But they are not a substitute for independent editorial judgment on how to present a public controversy. (Also, your book is on my list.)
@RadioFreeTom @emptywheel I’m saying that the whole article is poorly executed, does not properly contextualize the fight over the law and relies too heavily and uncritically on both government sources and ex-government sources.
@RadioFreeTom I enjoy reading @emptywheel but I wouldn’t write an explainer than solely relies on her analysis of 702 without also including critical who support the status quo.
@RadioFreeTom Sure. Sounds like a good point of view to include in a story that also addressed and quotes the critics of the law as well who are equally well-informed.
@RadioFreeTom Would it be appropriate for the ACLU to help CNN write it’s 702 explainer? They are very well informed about the topic.
I don’t say this lightly but this honestly reads like a fact-sheet from a government agency, not a dispassionate analysis of a public controversy from an independent news outlet.

This is pretty common. Novak outed every one of his sources on big stories when they died in his memoirs.

A senior Democratic aide said that Pelosi has asked Ryan to pull the FISA measure, given the President’s tweets this morning.
Yesterday, the working assumption around the Hill was that it would be narrowly defeated — but people were cautious to say it could go the other direction.
The FISA vote is the one rare species of congressional vote where both the coalition for and the coalition against completely scrambled party lines.
I’m hearing that Trump’s FISA tweets have thrown both party’s whip counts into total disarray, making it very hard to predict what happens with the vote.
This is not accurate. Today’s vote is on an amendment that is specifically aimed at giving Americans greater protections when they’re swept up in US spying. https://t.co/4OGM6sjQDX
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Yet the White House statement last night is in opposition to the amendment. In fact, the administration has repeatedly sought a permanent reauthorization of the entire FISA law with no changes. https://t.co/XYt2mCnbWN
Trump’s tweet — though he’s probably confusing section 702 electronic collection with traditional wiretaps, but whatever — makes more sense in the context of supporting such an amendment. https://t.co/X4W2kX3GaS

@imillhiser @bendreyfuss Yes, true.
@bendreyfuss I don't agree. There would have been no reason to ever pass the 25 Amendment in the first place if people earnestly believed that a concerned Congress could just gin up some high crimes or misdemeanors to remove an unfit president.
@bendreyfuss Would be seen as an awfully cavalier attitude towards the impeachment process that I doubt is widely shared. Most members of Congress don't just see impeachment as a simply means to end (removal of the president) but a legal process where certain standards have to be met.
@bendreyfuss E.g. you can imagine a scenario in which a president has committed no high crimes and misdemeanors and still warrants removal for unfitness. And vice versa. They're different processes to deal with different situations.
@bendreyfuss That's like saying "why involuntarily commit someone when you can just arrest them and jail them instead." Very different legal standards for impeachment ("high crimes and misdemeanors") versus simple "unfitness" under the 25th amendment.

@daveweigel Undeniably true.
Today? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
In ordinary times, both of these would be huge stories. As recently as two years ago, the brief lapse of surveillance authorities under Section 215 of the Patriot Act and the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act reforms was a big story on Capitol Hill.
This American has been detained for 94 days by the U.S. government and neither been presented before a judge in the US nor released or transferred to another country.
The second is the fact that the U.S. military is holding an American citizen in military custody as an enemy combatant without access to an attorney since Sept. 12.
It expires in 17 days and nobody in Congress can provide a firm answer for how this exactly gets renewed before that deadline and with what changes.
The first is the expiration of FISA Section 702 surveillance — the law underpinning a huge swath of intelligence collection against foreign targets.
There are two national security stories right now that I think, in more ordinary times, would be very big deals yet are generating almost zero public interest currently.

@jtlevy No, I mean, should the results of the Alabama election stand or should other institutions take extraordinary measures to overturn the will of the voters?
@jtlevy and if voters make that wrong choice, what then?
@aFritzPoker Oh, good to know. I didn’t know the choice of who filled a senate seat didn’t belong to the voters of a state. I stand corrected.
That’s not exactly how small-d democratic governance is supposed to work.
A lot of the loose talk from both sides about the Alabama Senate race treats the voters of Alabama rather cynically, as if there is a “wrong” choice they might make and that other institutions then need to correct.

The tiny kernel of truth in Kelly's remarks was that Wilson did tout her own role in the project. But it had nothing to do with funding.

Everyone who complains about DC's transit system should be rounded up and sent to Houston or Atlanta to do penance.
@b_fung @TalKopan I like that so much I'm going to tweet it outside this thread.
@b_fung @TalKopan My personal view is that everyone who complains about WMATA should be exiled to Houston or Dallas or Atlanta until they repent.
@b_fung @TalKopan I dunno. It's one of maybe 5 places in America where you can live very comfortably without a car because almost entirely because of transit.
@b_fung @TalKopan D.C.'s very-good-by-US-standards transit system is a bona fide selling point to anyone who wants to do business here.
@b_fung @TalKopan That was my point! Advantages are relative to who your competing against, not the perfect.
@b_fung @TalKopan Metro kills far fewer people than regional automobile accidents, yet nobody is afraid of car trips. That's a perception problem.

Character limit on Twitter combined being a wide open forum creates an environment where 140 characters is enough space to attack someone...

Every institution in Arrested Development is presented as incompetent: family, military, courts, prisons, media, government, business.
A precocious 9 year old could pick up on that theme in The Wire. But it's also at the heart of Arrested Development.
They're both tragedies (tragicomedy in the case of AD) about individuals at the mercy of powerful, decaying and rotten institutions.
As I was falling asleep last night, it occurred to me The Wire and Arrested Development are thematically the same show.
