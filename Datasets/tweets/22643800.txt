@AyleneWright @OHCnsvatarian I just read this piece you wrote and I knew about all of this, in general. But I didn't realize it had risen to "GATE" level.  That's DEFCON 1.  So, you may be right about the subtweeting after all. Sighs.  https://t.co/pCZF1xbSHj
@AyleneWright @OHCnsvatarian Not sure he's subtweeting the Bulwark.  That doesn't seem to be his style.  Further, I think folks are overly sensitive about it, in general. It's just a website &amp; hardly the only new "Trump skeptical" one out there. I don't read it religiously  tho so maybe I'm missing something
@AyleneWright @OHCnsvatarian I think you summarized my feelings as well.  There are two camps who are loud and that's who he's referring to. Then there's a third, like us, and we have lives so are not on here every day opining about how godawful POTUS is.  Realists maybe just waiting out the storm.

@WyattBEarp It has.  It was the subject of my FB post. I went through this in 2016 and I am NOT going to go through it again this year.  I put up a couple of pieces about Bill Weld and I saw, not much has changed.  So, I'll get rid of the morons who can't have a respectable conversation.
@ihatethemedia My hills are green(ish) this year but it won't last long.  It's STILL raining here, btw. Omg.
@ihatethemedia Possibly.  They have their work cut out for them these days in that city.  So glad I high tailed it out of there all those years ago.  The only thing I miss are the green hills.
@OHCnsvatarian Nor do I.  I'd be up all night, making lists and seriously, who does that?  Anyway, always nice chatting with you.
@ihatethemedia My thoughts exactly.  And when I put that tweet up, a T**la engineer liked it. IDK if he agreed that the Dodge was better, or what. haha.
But not always and this is how I've noticed a not new trend, but one that is back. People following, getting massive followbacks, and unfollowing all.  They too show up as "possibly shadowbanned."  #SocialMedia #FF @unfollowerstats
I don't use it for follows, so I cannot say how it handles that.  But it's terrific for unfollows. It actually tells you which accounts are "possibly shadowbanned."  And in checking, they are almost always right. The acct is on probation.
Since Manage Flitter was taken down, I've been searching for an unfollower app.  I've found one and in some ways it's better than Manage Flitter.  Non paying users can do up to 200 unfollows per day. Great for SoMe managers. https://t.co/0sYKt5fnF5
@ihatethemedia Crazy.  And one would think they'd get a massive discount since there is a Tesla factory there.
@OHCnsvatarian and the blogger wars, omg.  If I like a piece, I put it up. I cannot keep up with who funds what site, who used to write where, who was a Never Trumper and has flipped. It's like high school.
@OHCnsvatarian I do too.  I log on and the same people are fighting the same or a similar fight as they were the day prior. Day in, day out.  It's too much.  I choose to have a life.
@OHCnsvatarian I actually think far too many people are too focused on the inside baseball stuff (to use another baseball metaphor.)  I used to be this way, no longer.  It's unhealthy.  It's not infrequent that someone will tweet me about some minor meme etc that I have no idea about.
Ditto. https://t.co/6SMnnhJV8i

@sistertoldjah That's awesome.  I bought a lot of that sort of thing this past few months as well. Mostly from Walmart. I didn't actually think of the outlets, so I'll check them out.
@sistertoldjah I don't love their shoes but only because they don't really carry a lot in my size. I love Nordstrom rack for shoes for me. They do have great prices on the ones they do carry though!  I generally only go about once per year.  Or when the mood strikes.
@sistertoldjah @irishspy Oh, I'd not read that, nor did I know that's their model,  but it is a great idea.  I don't want those physical stores to suffer either. Literally the only shops I will spend an afternoon in.
@sistertoldjah @irishspy Have you seen all the cute, retro little bags out for spring? The woven bucket bags, and such?  They are insanely priced everywhere I've seen them. Typically, that's the sort of thing I'll pick up every so often at TJ Maxx or Marshalls.
@sistertoldjah @irishspy I HEAR YOU!  Though it's true that I generally don't like in person shopping, I do sometimes enjoy going into the outlets.  I'm not positive I'm going to like shopping them online, but we'll see.  I've never visited TJ Maxx online either. I should though. I need a few things.  üõçÔ∏è
@sistertoldjah @irishspy Hopefully, sooner rather than later, later. TJ Maxx is already online and they are the parent company.  I would think it will be a fairly easy transition for them.

@Conservativeind @GaltsGirl Me too.  I think that was either Mich or Suzi who started that.  I'd never seen it prior.  My first memory is on Conservative punk phone calls.  I think that's where we all *met.*
RT @Conservativeind: @GaltsGirl @hipEchik Wow... I woke up thinking I was having a flashback :-)
@Conservativeind @GaltsGirl Snarky &amp; Suzi meeting and getting married.  Undoubtedly the most significant event to come out of #TheTwisters .   We've got to meet up, Kim.  All nine of us.  I'm going to ask Tina when she comes home but I think it's this year.

@GaltsGirl @Conservativeind You've met Rune?
@GaltsGirl @Conservativeind Shame on me for that but it's much more do able now than it ever was. I can actually go anywhere and I will.  I think Tina is back this year too.  We should plan it for a 10 year reunion.  I know you won't come here so, I'll go to y'all.

So, if you're one of the congresspeople who follow, I helped elect you, Fix immigration.  It's tearing our country apart.
Last note on politics, it was as true in 09 as it is today, immigration was *the* issue.  10 years &amp; we're still battling about it.   I don't see a Rubio or a Haley ever getting elected unless &amp; until there's immigration reform. And we're no closer now than we were in 09
And what of the next (God willing) ten years? I don't know exactly.  We're selling this house. We're moving somewhere and we're running our business still..  I am getting older and wiser and I look for more fun these days...
So, that's my story, that's my decade. I'm still here but I've been trying to temper my usage.  It's not difficult for me to do either.  I only tweet if I have something to say and I did today.
..and no regrets.  I'd do it all over again.  It gave me skills I never thought I'd have.  It's all a matter of balance though and at one time, I was far too involved in the inside baseball stuff which I don't like. And, I hate drama but drama is Twitter's middle name.
I only went to one Teaparty. That was enough.  I was a semi regular on a San Diego radio show. That was fun. I've met a bunch of great people, had a lot of fun. Grown up quite a bit.  Survived the housing crash and the recession with y'all.  It's been quite a decade...
Besides politics, I was involved in helping to rescue both Jon Hammar and Andrew Tahmooressi from Mexican prisons.  The best things I've ever done online, helping those two Marines. We actually tried to help three, but only two came home.
The Scott Brown thing was intense. It wasn't just us doing the fundraising, obviously, but we were up late, writing blog posts, scheduling tweets, creating the money bombs.  Then all day, tweeting, calling, FBing. Everyone was united. And you know what happened.   #bqhatevwr
Chuck DeVore, Nick Popaditch, Elizabeth Emken, Meg Whitman, Tim Donnelly, many, many great California candidates. Zero winners. California was our nemesis. I think we eventually decided, no more Californians. It was hurting our win/loss ratio.
...and we did not fight. Imagine, nine women, no major fights.  Others were a bit jealous of us so we had a few online brawls but we were tight.   As I recall, we only had one major candidate quarrel. I still won't talk about it or him.  And my mind hasn't changed on him either.
The exception was candidates from California.   We sponsored a bunch of them.  Excellent candidates, not a single winner.  That red wave ended at the Rocky Mountains in 2010.  It's when I began to realize that CA politics are hopeless.
Make that two notable Senators.  I mean, we were very good at picking the winners. https://t.co/1OaF7PFMPA
But most of them were not witches and for a very long time, I was really proud of the candidates we sponsored, many of whom were elected.  I'm even still proud of one notable Senator.  2010 was an epic year to be a young conservative activist. https://t.co/C8i9me4ZqF
This was fun.  An emergency Twisters board meeting to talk about Christine O'Donnell.  We'd vetted her and decided to sponsor her and then she became a witch.  We dropped her.  It was a good call. We took it all very seriously. We wanted winners https://t.co/xNoq2QchI0
As I say, they were all grateful for the help.  	Side note, what is Scott Brown doing overseas, I wonder. https://t.co/lfcLN7i1Jk
We were in the mix when we were trying to elect Scott Brown to be the 41st vote against Obamacare. One week Twitter was raising a million dollars a day for his campaign.  A success, and a failure upon reflection. But at the time, we were doing good stuff.
I guess it was a year later that we formally started @TheTwisters but prior, we were hanging out online. On CPunk calls, and generally, having fun.  I think Chuck DeVore is the first candidate we sponsored.  They were all happy for our help too. https://t.co/Z8C9Pept15
Though most of us are still in touch, only me, @GaltsGirl &amp; @Conservativeind still tweet. None of us kept a list, unfortunately,  and the site is long gone but we were quite good at what we did and our elect rate was excellent. Good times. 10 years ago.
..and we created a website and vetted candidates, and held money bombs for those candidates, many of whom were elected in 2010.  That was one of the best usages of Twitter I've seen since I've been on here &amp; how so many Congresscritters came to follow me here.
I only started tweeting about politics when Obamacare was being talked about. That started it all.  And I met up with 8 other ladies, and we decided that we should use Twitter to help elect conservatives. So we formed @TheTwisters .
But I spent a few thousand tweets trying to get 'him' to retweet me, and he did but as I say, it wasn't him.  One of his band members did follow though, and still does to this day.  So, I wiled away those halcyon days stalking a fake Chris Isaak on Twitter.
There was an account on here who I thought was Chris Isaak.  It was my 2nd follower.  I was thrilled.  I blocked my first follower, a sweet old lady who tweeted about gardening, so that I could say that Chris Isaak was my 1st follower on Twitter.  It wasn't him.
I used a little fairy as an avatar.  I called it something else and didn't know what "an avatar" was. I asked people.  I asked a lot of questions. Some people answered, others ignored me.  It's much the same today in that regard.
That surgery was a success. They took out the tumor and half my thyroid.  I've never needed thyroid meds. The other half made up for it.  I tweeted about all of it.  I was non political at first.  I used blip fm to tweet music a lot.
Anyway,  I had gone a couple of years uninsured and just gotten catastrophic health insurance. The foot was first.  I also had a lump in my throat. It turned out to be a massive tumor on my thyroid.  It was benign.  So a 2nd surgery happened in May, 09 and again, I tweeted.
I was still walking with a boot on and using a walking stick.  I have the pics somewhere of me and James hiking in a rain forest while I hobbled along. But hobble I did.  Anyway, I regret that surgery. It made the problem worse.  But that is why I joined Twitter.  On this day, 09
I joined Twitter because I'd just had a major foot surgery in Feb of 09.  It was just something that could keep me occupied while my foot healed (which, by the way, never did happen.)  I wasn't cleared to travel until Sept of that year. We promptly flew to Oahu.
It's my 10 year anniversary on Twitter.  The sun is the same in a similar way but we're older, and shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.   https://t.co/nBDeZq94OD  #NowPlaying https://t.co/rpW5VboMgL

@dalehuntington @sdutKrier I have too until about this week.  And I'd still be loving it if not for the fact that we're trying to ready our house to list it.  And we have painting, and gardening, etc. to do.  The rain has pushed our list date back.   I'm just frustrated by that.

@Sky_Bluez I didn't read far enough along and see how it morphed into "punk rock" in the 90s which I was into, albeit, not my favorite form of rock.  I'll read more about it.  Still though, I never once heard the term "ska band" until this podcast.  They were considered "punk rock." here.

@silkride @CA_Dem @GavinNewsom It is sad.
@silkride @CA_Dem @GavinNewsom Yeah, it's not exclusive to CA, that's for sure.  But we do have many that are literally having to flee.  I don't know about more states than not.
@hc4cactus @CA_Dem @GavinNewsom My grandparents and parents immigrated here from Greece &amp; Canada and chose the Bay Area.  They died young, tragically, but at times, just for a minute, I'm glad they never saw their grand kids have to flee the once golden state.

@KarenNativeCA We don't have a rain tax yet.  And, we haven't tried to outlaw cigarettes yet (like Hawaii just did.)  I agree they are copying us though.  But we're so big and now some of the Dems are filling in as "fiscal conservatives."  We'll see how it plays out.

@meadabawdy and finally, some of these states have a sincere unfunded PEU liabilities problem. And that's tough for Joe I'm Leaving CA to find.  But one day, soon, those liabilities are going to be a problem for said Red(ish) state and for Joe.
@meadabawdy What I dislike about all these no income tax states is that it's the property owner who picks up the tab.  All of it.  And no prop 13 as in CA to keep the property taxes in check so they keep increasing the property taxes. I'd add a small consumption tax or something. It's unfair
@propatriots Maybe so.  Or, Illinois or any number of states.  But that rain tax isn't unique to blue states.  TX does it too.
But wait, there's more.  It's not just a blue state issue.  Taxing The Rain is also a thing in TX.  It's part of what they call the MUD tax.  If you are leaving CA for greener pastures, look deep at the "other" taxes and fees because, they are there.  https://t.co/jToe55b2ZN

@mamagerka This is correct.  And I've not asked my friend details yet but I will.  I am going to guess that it was not that because I think this was a longtime disorder with him. But yes, I see CPP's say all the time they will go to the streets and risk death rather than suffer.
@mamagerka I agree.  Am watching Bill Weld who is said to be considering running.  Not sure on the GOP or LP ticket but he should have been at the top of the Johnson/Weld ticket in 2016 IMO.
So this is fantastic and I don't even have to have one to get a knock on the door.  Paranoia will destroya?  I am glad they are solving cold cases but, this is a conundrum.  And we can't even agree on far simpler things.  https://t.co/SJtOTLyUQm
@mamagerka Or maybe a more libertarian type because some countries are having great successes but they liberalized, not tightened up drug policy.  How did prohibition of alcohol work out for us.  Sigh.
@mamagerka I know.  I've used that very analogy with the DMV.   What a nightmare and what they are doing is clearly not working.  So I wonder how many more have to suffer and die before someone decides, hey, let's try something else? It may take a leftist president to do it.  Unsure.

@ret_cw3 @mattklewis @CNN This is a great picture!  Hey, name of our new garage band.  "The Beloved Commentators."!   Now, I must be disciplined and get off of Twitter.  Matt's latest column is dead on.  Love it.
@Sean_O_914 I cannot even imagine.  I only know that this is huge and our personal accounts are now accessible online whereas our business accounts are still not.  Not sure how long they can go with the "smoke in MN" line. There may have been some smoke in MN but that did not cause all this.
@Sean_O_914 That is a distinct possibility.  My husband just went into a branch to make a deposit and the bank employee told him "it will be a week tomorrow since this all started." That is not what their official press releases say.  There is absolutely more to this than they are saying.
Interesting.  Husband just went to a Wells Fargo bank to make a deposit.  A bank employee told him "it will be a week tomorrow since this all started." That is NOT what their official press releases say.  Again, there is more to this and it involves a data breach. I'm sure of it.
@CitiBE As to the second part of your question, no.  It does not necessarily remain constant.  One would hope that it does not anyway.
@CitiBE Upon further reflection, I probably ought not to have said "poor."  Poor choice of a word.  I think you get my sentiment though and it still stands.

@mamagerka Yes, that's exactly right, Linda.  And I hate it but I do see a lot of conservatives buying into this part of it as well. And it is jealousy.  Those folks should log off of twitter and go get a second job. Or start a business. Or read about investing, IMO.

@Sean_O_914 Agree!  This is my entire point.  Built in contingencies are practiced for..  It would automatically bounce to another server.  It's a breach.  I'm sure of it.  And there is something else. A bunch of credit unions were phished at the same time. Coincidence? I think not.
On another topic. My Wells Fargo accounts are now up and accessible. And I still do not believe this was caused by smoke in a data center in MN.  Not sure what caused this but it was more than that, and it will come out.
@CitiBE @Atlknox87 I have to read it later.  I'm being prodded to sign off.  You've got great tweets though.  Thanks so much.
@CitiBE Right..  This is the gist of my tweets today about Barack Obama.  And the definition of "poor" or "wealthy" is relative and in the eye of the beholder.  It's a valid point.  I am only saying this, he was not born wealthy by my definition of wealth.
@nanapapa9628 Okay.  Have a good day.  He earned his money by selling books and by speaking engagements but you want to believe what you want to believe so we'll just end this discussion now.

Man, a lot of you still have Barack Obama living rent free in your heads. That nightmare of a presidency is over. You can't be a hypocrite about this.  He too earned his wealth, via capitalism.  And he's not as far left as these socialist democrats.  Or, he didn't govern that way
@nanapapa9628 If you read my tweets in totality, i say, one can disagree with his politics (and I do) but you cannot disagree that he succeeded all the way up to the Presidency. My point is that anyone can do it.  And no, he's not broke now. He earned it.
If you are saying that Obama was born into wealth, you are just wrong.  Or, not born into what I consider wealth. A lot of kids that are not wealthy go to private schools.  Again, this is America.  #DumbArguement
Or, if you want to have a discussion with me, at least follow me. IDK why this guy doesn't follow but weighs in on a ton of my posts.   Anyway, as to Punahau, there are scholarships also. I think he also got one of those. I've forgotten now. He was not wealthy.
Obama's grandparents paid for his education at Punahau.  I'm not going to argue this.  He was not wealthy, is my point. If you want to argue semantics, go elsewhere. There's always someone willing to argue.  It's not me.  He was not born into wealth.  Period.

She just confirmed that it was Tuesday in NV.  And she drove to the bank to make the deposit. So, if not related, it's a hell of a coincident. First time in 10 yrs that she has had a problem.
Further, a friend is telling me that she was having problems prior to yesterday.  She tried to make a deposit on Tues or Weds and could not. Wells told her that they were "aware of the issue."
They are saying that smoke in a data center in MN caused this. They should have redundancy. One data center down should not cause this widespread of a problem for this long. They need to have data centers throughout the US.  This is a wake up call to us.
and by the way, this is just the latest with Wells. They don't do anything for #smallbiz anymore. That's basically all I am going to say on Twitter. They saved me once, when I was in a fix, and I've stayed because of that. But that debt has been re-payed.  This is not good.
Not only can we not access any of our accounts with @wellsfargo 24 hours later, it won't let me log out either. They apologize for the delay.  I apologize for switching banks, once we can access our accounts that is.  Who wants the money and the home loan we'll be needing soon?

Listen up, Congress. IDK which GOP lawmakers are opposed to revisiting the SALT caps, etc in the tax plan but it damn well cost you the entire O.C. contingent.  @POTUS is right to want to "revisit" it. It never should have been passed in the first place!  https://t.co/HjLwwbtIjF

@DerMellitz So, the big change is the young people then?  They are causing the stress on society and the systems that have worked so well for so long.  The new calls for socialism, etc, is the essence of the new problems in your opinion?  And with such a small society, it's more acutely felt
@DerMellitz Okay.  I THOUGHT so but wanted to clarify.  I know in some European countries, success is applauded quietly but not something that people are supposed to talk about. I did not think that was the case in Switzerland.  I find this conversation fascinating. Thank you!
@DerMellitz Okay.  I understand the stress, the mental wounds, etc. All societies suffer this.  I don't quite understand your statement "it's the emptiness of success."  Because, in America, success brings us great joy and a generally healthier attitude.  So this is a cultural difference?
@HonkyTonkJew Awww, nothing.  I was talking about Twitter in general earlier and how it helps that I don't generally tweet the things that are getting people in trouble because I am nice.  It's not for everyone. ;-)
I guess that is two things actually.  	At any rate, I'm outta here.  Be nice.  	Just try it.  You may be surprised.  Adios.
I am tweeting all conservative/libertarian/free market solutions to health insurance that I find.  Doesn't mean I endorse one or the other. They've just come onto my radar so I am in the learning phase.  I know one thing, something has to change, and the govt isn't the answer.

@meadabawdy Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Yes.  Genuine for sure.  I don't always agree with him and less now than when he was running but I get that he too had to compromise some. He gets a lot of heat from both sides. Or, all three sides I guess is more accurate.

Well. This tweet from this morning did not age well considering my Rand Freaking Paul tweets. Let me clarify.  I am generally nice unless provoked.  I'm out to do some more Marie Kondo-ing.  Have a lovely evening, all. https://t.co/el4MQMLVWu
@meadabawdy Truth.  I mean, I never supported him for anything beyond what he is, or what I thought he is, a libertarian from KY.  I am still pretty happy with my political BAE and the way that he's navigating these waters.  Sometimes so deftly that no one notices I think.
@meadabawdy Absolutely.  So many politicians that I used to admire are now nothing but mockworthy.  Taught me a good lesson.
Thank you! https://t.co/xq01R4Mr1L
@Lonestarmomcom I pay so little attention to that issue because I'm impatient but even I have seen some things to that effect.  He's really disappointing.  Once held up as the libertarian savior in the GOP and just reduced to a flipping cultist where any dissent is mocked. F him. Seriously.

@Lonestarmomcom Seriously he is.  I cannot even believe he tweeted that.  A-hole.  He's supposedly a libertarian.  They/we think following the crowd on any given matter is the worst thing ever.  He's a sell out.
@SheershyDude Yep.  That's right.  Follow the cult or shut up.  What about the individualism that the GOP purported to stand for since I joined, many years ago?  Rand Paul wants none of that now.  Just blind loyalty.  I call b.s.
We have a SOTU where the POTUS calls for unity and then Rand Freaking Paul goes and tweets something like that.  It's not helpful.  We can agree where we agree, and disagree where we don't. It's called individualism and a tenet of libertarianism that @RandPaul used to advocate.
I really despise when people throw all Never Trumpers into a bunch.  Especially when it's coming from an esteemed member of Congress.

@KellyRek @HConomics The piece I put up by Kevin Williamson was not saying to mirror the Swiss model but rather to borrow from it.  I saw some good facets in it which is the only reason I tweeted it out.  To be clear.  I am not advocating for a full on adaptation of the Swiss model. Nor was Kevin.
@Avik @KristinaRibali and that's something to ponder too. I really want this HSM to work. It gives me a lot of freedom in choice of providers, no one managing my care except me and my Dr's etc.  But no one can comprehend a patient asking about prices, discounts, and the like.  It's been insane.
@Avik @KristinaRibali I'm sure he does, Avik.  I'll catch up later. Off to see my Dr. again.  I went with a health sharing ministry as of 1/1 and it's been a mess.  I understand how it all works but UCSD does not. No one understands how old indemnity type plans worked anymore except a few of us.

@OneFineJay So maybe it's just the model that is flawed?  I've layed down the law so many times on FB and still, I have ppl testing my limits.  I'll cut them too and never think twice about it.  I insist on civility.  And it's do-able but time consuming.
@OneFineJay That's what I am saying too.  It's literally the first time I've written about it because as you say, it's bananapants.  And also true that we can control our FB experience better than we can our Twitter experience.  I think FB will last when Twitter will not because of this.
Now, to eat that cinnabon and get ready to go to the Dr. again.  It's been a LONG year full of Dr's, dentists and rx issues and surgeries and a 50 hour migraine and a breast cancer scare that was operator error. Such a long year already and it's Feb 7th.
I saw some of the most horrendous tweets sent to the writers at the Weekly Standard when they shuttered their doors.  Is there outrage over those? NOPE. Why?  I don't know. Because they are writers and didn't whine about 3 hurtful words? Okay I am done now.  For now.

@MushKat I take time off for sanity's sake and that is exactly how I missed this entire learn to code meme and mess. I was offline.  But ppl should do what they need to do, IMO. I see people ready to snap on here because they are online all the time, rage tweeting.  It too is crazy.
@meadabawdy Thank you, Michael.
Anyway, here's a bit about Avik Roy's plan.  I don't know a ton about it right now but I will read later this afternoon.  https://t.co/YGn34XqBps
Who knew that the right, free market types are testifying in front of congress about a universal health plan?  Not me.  I'm listening too because, we have a mess. I killed my ACA plan as of 1/1 and I am already in a mess because of unexpected health care costs in January.
@KristinaRibali @Avik I have read this plan before but I read the long version back then and I think I am going to have to again. Unless you have something in between this piece and the long version that gets into more detail?  I'd love to see it if you have it. TY, Kristina.
@joinlivelihood I have to mull this over when I am more awake. ;-)
Now, to eat my yummy Cinnabon which is still standing, all three of them, and I know James will go nuts when he sees it.  He hates when food sits around for more than a day. Sometimes an hour.  I need to fix that for him.
Lastly, this.  FB keeps asking me to take polls and answer surveys.  I've done it because, you can't complain unless you try to fix the problem. Or, I can't.  And I kid you not, one of the things I suggested was implemented. Is Twitter doing any of this?  Not that I have seen.
@rm1evo That's true.  It is. I will say this, FB is doing better.
@MushKat Like I say, I've stayed above the fray on all of this because, who has time? But this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen on here.  It's a fine line between humor and hate and is in the eyes of the beholder.  As much sh*t that FB gets, this is not happening there.   Onward.
@MushKat Or, IDK what the answer is.  Any ideas are certainly welcome.
@MushKat That's true.  But a lot of us do not.
@joinlivelihood Yes, exactly.  I've got some appointments today but want to dig further into both his ideas and another one that a preeminent health insurance expert has posed in front of congress lately. Both are preferable to a govt takeover of insurance IMO.
@joinlivelihood Hah.  That's literally my mantra and is in my Twitter bio.  "Choose your battles." And I live by it too.  It's a good message and I'm good with unity as well.
but I think "we" should do this. Boycott twitter for a day.  Go out on strike.  For real. They use ads and presumably they want people actually online to see those so just stay off.  It will take forever to organize so I propose May 1st.  Spread the word.   This site is insane.
I think once Trump goes, so does Twitter. The only reason most stay is because of politics.  The large accounts anyway.  So watch this once fun website die. It's on it's last few years. Meanwhile, I've had zero problems on FB but again, I am nice.  I'm not really gonna rant now
Anyway, I've stayed off of twitter's radar by being nice and that's not likely to change because, I am nice by nature. But I have a snarky streak too.  I mean, this sounds like comedy to me.  And someone decided it's hurtful.  But the Farrakhan TERMITE tweet is not hurtful.
@rm1evo Yeah.  It's fkn insane. I've never gotten into this entire twitter is biased thing because I like to stay under the radar but I'm pretty sure that Farrakhan's "TERMITE" tweet is still up. That these punks in the silicon valley are the arbiters of speech is starting to bug me.

@DerMellitz Are you in Switzerland?  This is all interesting information so I'd love to hear where you live.
@joinlivelihood Interesting.  Many people "love" their Dr's.  Either way, it's a pain to lose a Dr even if it's not a super tight rapport.  It's a pain to have to go over everything with a new Dr. at the very least.
@joinlivelihood Thank you. Followed back.  I tweet about a myriad of things though.  And if we have political differences ,we agree to disagree ok?  So over people fighting online.  Anyway, yes, that's fine.
@joinlivelihood So, no more losing coverage because you move. Or because you switch places of employment or whatever.  No more losing your much loved Dr. for the same reason(s).  That's the gist of what I love about these provisions.  Continuity.
@joinlivelihood Yes, it really does.  And even if they are only doing it part time. Everyone needs insurance.  And as I say, for lower income folks, there are subsidies.  Insurance is complex but that you grab the basics of this proposed change is a good thing.
@joinlivelihood I have to go offline but if I'm not getting it across well, I'll be happy to answer any more questions. But that is just one facet of what is being proposed, the structure of the plan from group to individual.  Suggest reading the piece also.
@joinlivelihood In this example, a person could buy a variety of different LEVELS of plans since it's not a government takeover but the fact is, the individual buys it. Some are subsidized, depending on income others are not.  Still, the fact that it's an individual plan gives the person options
@joinlivelihood So, you are an app developer. Perfect example. You likely have a bunch of independent contractors contributing, yes? You and they would buy an insurance plan and if they then go on to work at Apple, that plan stays the same. They don't lose their Dr etc as they do now.
@joinlivelihood I am.  I am talking about the same type of insurance for everyone.  Individual plans.  You would have an individual plan whether you work for GM or whether you are a Uber driver. etc.  It's totally a free market solution with some twists.
@KristinaRibali @Avik Hoping he talks about across state lines purchase and all individual plans. Both very important to any new plans going forward, IMO.  But, I'll read what you linked me with.  Thanks, Kristina.
Thank you again.  Please share it with me if you remember. If not, I'll go to your page and grab it. I get his emails every Sunday and have been deleting them lately as I'm so busy.  I must have missed this entirely. https://t.co/zBG1oMsR0P
@joinlivelihood So, it's less disruptive to have all individual plans.  And the employer could still subsidize the insurance or whatever, but it's YOUR coverage. It goes with you where ever you may work.   Hope that explains it.
There are 2 types of plans. Group insurance bought by a group &amp; Individual insurance bought by individuals &amp; Sm Biz owners,  As the gig economy and sm biz grows, it is less disruptive to have only indiv plans. . If you leave Job A &amp; go to Job B, your insurance stays the same. https://t.co/gWj9WZZjXr

@hc4cactus Oh.  What didn't happen to me since Jan 3rd is the more apt question.  I had a ton of dental work done including a lower molar extraction.  I was in a ton of pain but it's better now. Regardless, dentist doesn't want me to get my heart rate up today.  Wants me to just kick back.

@MichelleInCAL We said that very thing also!  And we'll do it if we ever leave him alone again.  We have some that we used to watch the kid with (that he knew about) .  For now though, I don't let him stay down here alone if I am not home.

@MichelleInCAL I know.  It really is. But he was alone in the fam room when he hurt himself (we think.) I came home from a meeting and he had been down here alone the entire time and he was hurt.  So it's my best guess. He fell off the furniture.
@MichelleInCAL I cannot tell you how many times I've said that very thing in the past month.
@MichelleInCAL We just think it's in his head.  We had to entice him up the stairs with an assortment of doggie treats and cheeses.  But he won't get on the couch for his favorite foods in the world. Ground beef, chicken or bacon.
@MichelleInCAL So, the only thing he won't do is jump on the furniture. I'm fine with that tbh, but am trying to figure out why. Oh, and he did it once so I know he can do it.  Its bizarre.
@MichelleInCAL All of that came in stages. He ran up the stairs once then didn't do it for another week. he wouldn't get on the bed for a long time. I had to sleep downstairs with him for weeks and weeks. Then he just started jumping on the bed which is higher than the couches.
@MichelleInCAL No.  He's running and jumping and sleeping with us. He runs the stairs, etc. The only thing he won't do is jump on the furniture. So we're thinking this may be how he hurt himself. Trying to get on the furniture, so he is scared.  Thoughts? Vizslas are weird that way too.

@rohitjoycpa @ChuckDeVore @JamesQuinteroTX And this is where we are different &amp; I cannot get into why on Twitter.  Suffice to say, we'd be paying more in TX all told.  So I am looking at "other" expenses and they are lower in TX but we're not sure low enough to risk losing many local clients to go there. It's a conundrum
@rohitjoycpa @ChuckDeVore @JamesQuinteroTX Thank you.  Yes, I've done extensive research x 4 yrs and all you say is true. Still, for us, we'd pay a sizable amount more in Hays County TX.  About 3,500.00 for the price point we want to buy in.  And no guarantee they won't go up so that's why I'm watching this.

@Bldr_John You're welcome and good luck.  My uncle is cashing out of Vancouver and going to Victoria island as Vancouver real estate is so expensive.  He has this tiny house and says he's going to get a million for it.
@jonfranks I actually had heard something about this from a conservative Texan.  He wasn't happy either.  On the up side, they only work 90 days per year IIRC.
@Bldr_John They offer one for a low fee which is superior and calculates taxes.  If we were still looking, I'd buy that one. Also, not Minton but Mindon.
@Bldr_John DO look at the property tax rates, per county, first not last though.  Also see this ----&gt;  https://t.co/GH7AqITHii  cost of living calculator. The most savings you'll see is in housing.  Also, it doesn't calculate taxes.
@Bldr_John That works but Incline Village is expensive too.  Anywhere right near the lake is.  I looked. We couldn't swing it.  But Minton and areas like that, pretty close to the lake and super inexpensive for housing.
Welp.  I wish I knew what this was.  I'll post it in my TX group.  I have a group for every state we've ever thought of moving to. One of the cons of TX is the property tax rates. We'd pay a lot more than in CA for a much less expensive home in Hays .  https://t.co/MI9D5AYPK3
@Bldr_John However, you are up on the mountains so be aware, it's a whipping wind in the winter.  It's gorgeous up there though.  I could have lived there, easily.  Also, look at Sparks vs Reno.  It's more suburban and a lot more land per lot than Reno proper.  And, a lot cheaper.
@Bldr_John South Lake Tahoe is very expensive.  And much of it is in CA but look at North Lake Tahoe or as close to it as you can get.  Going south from Reno, there are a lot of communities along the ridges where you can buy a place for California pennies.
@Bldr_John Hmmm. Given those three options, I'd go for Canada in summer and FL in winter.  We looked at NV to live in and I'd rather poke my eye out than to live in Las Vegas.  I don't care if it's tax free, I can't live there. Reno area is nicer though.
@kevindavis338 Oh god yes, gtfo of IL.  It's worse than CA.  DO be aware of high property taxes in both TX and parts of FL though.  I THINK TX may have just lowered a base rate or something but unsure.  No one is answering me.
@jonfranks Why?
I wonder how many Californians are watching the #TxLege .  I'm in a fb group and a ton of people are "thinking" about moving to TX but not many are moving. I think that the mess Texodus has peaked.  Time will tell tho.

It is NOT just blue states either so you can't legitimately cheer on the punishing of blue states. It was never a good idea to do so but red and blue staters will see an increase (or decrease) as detailed here https://t.co/pYNtB8JtuU
I don't want to argue about it either. Your results may vary. Mine  went up and the @GOP lost me because of that tax plan. And failure to repeal Obamacare and tarrifs, and the opioid regs.  Other policy is good. Rollback of regs, judges. Still, you raise my taxes, you lose me.
@Beregond Glad it works for you, Tom.  I don't get fevers but do have a ton of pain issues and Aleve is second to none, in my book as far as an OTC pain med goes.  And far less liver toxic. I hate the stuff.  Wish it wasn't in rx pain meds either since it's so useless.
People are just now discovering what Californians knew when it passed.  And it's not just CA that it's impacting.  This bill needs to be tweaked.  It really does.  I think it's the reason for the slowing of the housing market as well.  It's a terrible tax plan. https://t.co/0xSsTf8H9G
Oh.  I add caffeine to whatever I'm using if it's moderate to severe pain.  It seems to get the meds into my system more quickly.  And with this level pain, minutes matter.  Anyway, I think the worst is blessedly over with this dental treatment.  Thankful for that.  #DentalTweets
@Beregond Okay.  As long as you're aware of how toxic it is.  Many, many people are not.  They think, it's over the counter, it must be safe. Some risk with Aleve and Motrin and liver damage too as well as internal bleeding risk
@Beregond Exactly.  It's the only thing it's good for and honestly, I don't like it for adults who drink any alcohol at all.  It's too liver toxic.  I prefer Aleve, Motrin and Aspirin in that order for either fever or pain.  Aleve is underrated.  It really is.  I use it a lot.
Flag called on the tweet.  I meant "and many Dr's recommend Ibuprofin (Motrin), when Aleve is superior, etc.  #NeedThatEditButton https://t.co/Os9beI9Nub
But also, many Dr's &amp; Dentists recommend Tylenol. A useless drug, IMO, unless for a child's fever. The Rx strength Aleve is a powerful painkiller &amp; many Dr's recommend Aleve (Motrin), when Aleve is superior IMO.  Ask yours about it. I'm a pain pro. It sometimes kills migraine too
I am not a Dr. but...   I needed those rx pain meds for my dental pain this past two days but i just awoke with pain and it had lessened.  I tried two OTC Aleve (Naprosyn) and it totally did the trick. Almost zero pain.  Sign of a skilled DDS/Oral Surgeon. ü¶∑#DentalTweets

@pursueliberty Oh yeah.  We blew it big time. And nor did I vote for either of them.  I'd was with Perry back then and then a huge Rubio supporter.  I still keep hope alive that he'll be in there one day.
@pursueliberty Oh wow.  So almost a decade since the last snow.  And crazy about Santa Cruz.  It's pretty low but not out of the norm every few years up there. I lived in Fremont and have seen snow atop of Mission Peak at times.
@pursueliberty I keep getting emails about Stacey Abrams,referencing Marco Rubio (My personal favorite) and the taking a drink of water at the SOTU.  I never did understand why that became such a huge thing.  Neither he nor Perry deserved that mocking.
@pursueliberty OH LORDY. Yes.  How I'd forgotten then, I don't know.  And yes, it's exactly as you say.  He forgot the name of the entity he'd eliminate.  It was too soon after his concussion and he was on something. I think pain meds and valium type drug. Notorious for memory loss. It was bad

@pursueliberty Oh yes.  That info is long forgotten.  The east bay is where I grew up.  Born in Oakland, raised in Fremont. I love the east bay hills and have never stopped missing them

@Beregond Check it out when you  can and LMK what you think pls.  https://t.co/FjxNJOJnrh
@Beregond They are taking the rebates that the PBM's are being given and passing them directly to the consumer.  It will absolutely lower the cost of drugs.  I've got that part. IDK why it increases the premiums tho.  I'll grab the piece I read. brb
@Beregond I know this but I don't understand why this policy would increase insurance premiums. It should lower them,should it not?
@Sky_Bluez Indeed I am.  I think this was the year before he ran for POTUS. He was here for an Eagle Scout dinner and he used to be an Eagle Scout so he was the honored guest.  Or speaker.  I forget which.
@_justbeachy Thank you!  They are the loves of our lives.
This entire rx drug deal sounds very good.  The piece I read said it would actually increase insurance premiums but IDK why it would. You cut out the PBM's and other middlemen, give the rebate direct to the consumer, not the PBM, and prices should fall across the board.  #SOTU

@SLegaspi @captainkudzu Yep. I hope so.  It's not only hurting the middle class in some cases but it's hurting conservatives politically. I know it's what cost the GOP Orange County, CA.  That's Reagan Country and they don't appreciate Republicans raising their taxes.  It's how they roll. They fire reps
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu Yes.  Very likely so.  Anyway, as David says, I hope that they will make some corrections because it's quite inequitable as it is.
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu Most pieces I've read only reference the Blue States and there is little sympathy from conservatives.  And I don't need sympathy, but I do want them to know the truth. This was a poorly written plan.  I AM glad that you made out well though, Sarah. :-)
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu That is a valid point but also, Texas, a very conservative state is impacted because of their terribly high property tax rates.  It's impacting both blue and red states as David says.  It's why I tweeted his piece out because he spells that out.
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu I never thought the GOP would raise my taxes but they did.  It's what cost them Orange County CA in the last election also.
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu One would hope!
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu ..and these are conservative writers.  So, no bias there either. Straight up facts. Everyone knows that these write offs were capped or cut so I am not sure why it's hard to believe. And btw, I too am far from rich.
@SLegaspi @captainkudzu And I will lose money.  So, as he says, it benefited some and it cost others money. And I can pull a dozen other pieces that say the same if you'd like me to.

@mamagerka I never have but this has me really on edge.  I think they caused this pain by the dental assistant messing up the temporary crowns. I think she disturbed the nerve more than it should have been.  It's hurt since that day but shot up yesterday after the work. Nerve pain is crazy.
@mamagerka It IS tomorrow and it won't be since I'm having dental surgery today.  But, it will be better in the long run, that's for sure.  I'll be ok with these meds on board.  It just took me by surprise since it's not that extensive of dental work.  Just 3 crowns.
ICYMI - Twitter is talking about an edit feature but as predicted by me and many others, it will still display the original tweet.  It's the only way it can be done.  Ala Facebook.  I am guessing it will have a timestamp of all edits too.

There is zero wrong with the tweet about the child.  I read the piece. It ends with "Joshua, we‚Äôre pulling for you. Stay strong. "  And this is why I don't engage with the Twitter mob.  The screenshots look bad. It's not bad.  Apologies for the F word.  I'm in severe pain. https://t.co/tJc1tvF14v

So actually I am going to tell the story as it may help someone. Not yet though. After these teeth stop throbbing.  Making coffee to see if that helps the pain meds get into my bloodstream faster. But the heat of coffee.. Oy. dental pain is the worst. This best be normal.
Anyway, thanks for listening.  This is hardly the worst medical/dental thing that's happened to me in 2019.  I am not sure I'm going to tweet about the worst thing.  It turned out fine, but I could barely breathe for 2 weeks and it was  unnecessary stress.
I'm also having discomfort (though not pain) while drinking so am using a (perfectly legal to buy) straw.  However, am having an extraction later today &amp; they say no using a straw after an extraction. Methinks it's going to be "one of those years" based on the first 5 weeks.
Is NY now further left than CA?  Does politics now start on the east coast?  It's a matter of degrees but the distinction is huge.  You cannot buy foie gras OR a late term AB (except to save the mother's life) in CA. Late night musings.
Fox News is on about how Foie Gras is banned in NY. Same in CA.  Straws &amp; plastic bags apparently banned there too.  Not here though many say they are. You must request straws &amp; pay for bags but totally legal.  Where NY exceeds CA is late term AB.  And that trumps all the rest.
@MarlaMHughes Thank you.  It'll be okay in about 15 minutes.  I have stuff for pain. Didn't think I'd need it for this but I do. It's pretty bad and I just wasn't expecting it. Never needed pain meds for crowns before. James says it's because of the nerves in the front. IDK if true but ouch.
I love the way the actor playing Albert in "Victoria" says "Victoria."  It sounds like "Vittoria."  I don't know his name but he's one sexy character. Trying not to get too attached because I know his  fate. A terrific series altogether.  Have to stop so I don't tweet spoilers.
Also, James ate most of my feta and olives while cooking his dinner and then said "I only had a couple of pieces."  He's not a liar but he is a bit of a compulsive eater. I had to show him the "before" pic to prove my point. Had to do it.  So I'm hungry too. Hangry &amp; Paingry.
Woke up to the lidocane having worn off. In 7 of 10 pain. Mr. Google says it's because it's the front teeth; that the nerve endings are disturbed. The third crown isn't hurting so I guess that might be true.  Trying to control it again now. Middle of the night dental tweets. ü¶∑ü¶∑

@LovinBlue Thanks, Laura.  Yep, I've fired dentists too.  When I first got to San Diego I had a cheap HMO &amp; the dentist wanted to do fillings with no lidocaine.  I walked out on him &amp; called the HMO. His office was filthy too. I've never forgotten that.  Frauds in medicine &amp; dentistry suck.
@mshpitsoccermom I don't know.  I say if you can afford it, do it.  I had gorgeous teeth not that long ago. It makes a huge difference in my confidence level, in my attitude, everything.  This was just the beginning of a whole lot of work that needs re doing.
@LovinBlue I have a ton more work to do too.  An extraction tomorrow. Then probably a bunch more crowns. I let my teeth go during Obamacare. All my $ was going to my ACA premiums and that's gone as of this year so now, teeth.   Lots of teeth.
@LovinBlue I've never in my life had a problem &amp;  this work was just 3 crowns.  But the first dental assistant was horrid.  Longish story but I fired her.  So today was literally the first time I've had that much anxiety.  And it was painful but the teeth are pretty and healthy so it's good
@mshpitsoccermom I will once the numbness wears off.  I can't smile yet.  My lip is totally numb.  But I can tell that the crowns are gorgeous.  I had told her to lengthen them a tiny bit. I like the look of a bit of length in the 2 front teeth. She added a perfect amount.  Seriously pretty.
Thanks for the follow.  Your foundation looks interesting.  I'll check it out and hope others do as well. https://t.co/WjSWBbzumI
Three hours later to place 3 permanent crowns.  I'm done but they had to numb me to do it. Couldn't get the temp off of 1 tooth, it took an hour. I'm in more pain than I should be for a crown placement. They are gorgeous though.  It is done. Yay.
Crazy right?  I've got the same family situation with most in Canada but one in the UK.  My cousins in Canada wait forever.  One relative had to be brought here, to UCSF, for life saving surgery.  Canada was going to let him die.  He's alive and well 15 years later thanks to U.S. https://t.co/1Zd30QN22U
@TammyJoHays I've been good but this is a cheap dental HMO and I had a horrid dental assistant last time.  It's done now and the teeth look gorgeous so am glad I did it.

@mshpitsoccermom This is great!  I did do it and glad for it. The new crowns are on the front teeth and they are beautiful.  Yay me!

But, I am going to check.  Sorry for all the whining. You guys have no clue what I went through in Jan with medical, dental, rx and Dr quitting issues. I'm going to need a shrink if this keeps up.  Now, to put some teeth into this effort and get out the door. Later. Gators

@_justbeachy For a long time, he wouldn't go up the stairs either.  We had to entice him.  So whatever happened, it scared him. We're not trying to get him onto the couch because I'd prefer he not be on it but he seriously won't do it.  I tried bacon once, no go.  He's a sensitive dog. lol.
@_justbeachy Aww, thanks for thinking of him.  It was a sprain.  He recovered physically in a couple of weeks and is running and jumping per normal.  But we think he's suffering psychologically.  We don't know how he hurt himself and are thinking he fell when jumping onto the couch.

@TammyJoHays I won't do either Invisalign or Valium.  I had braces.  The prob is that for all the Obamacare years ALL my money went to Obamacare.  I opted out in Jan and now have money for my teeth and much work needs to be done.  And this DDS office sucks.

@ihatethemedia I hate that stuff.  I had it once and had to sit on the dental office stairs for an hour before I could drive. I don't like being high and I felt really high on the gas.
anyway, 	good day.  	If I send tweets from the dental chair, please, send help.
@kerwood Thanks again, Keith.  It's been non stop stuff since the beginning of the year.  I try not to whine but January was pretty bad. . Nothing went well or right. Hoping it was an anomaly.
@ihatethemedia I believe it.  So much cutting corners in dentistry and medicine.  The problem is she put the temp crowns on wrong.  I've always been a good dental patient but now I'm dreading it.  I do have them on notice though so hoping for the best.
@kerwood I have to have that done tomorrow.  And then I am finding a new office to do the implant.  It's a dental HMO so I have no choice in dental offices near me, but I'm going to call Blue Shield and tell them what happened and that I want to go to their La Jolla contracted office.
@esqcapades Thank you.  It should be.  I told them that the dental assistant is never touching me again.
@ihatethemedia The DDS was good but she left me with this dental assistant who caused me immense pain. It took her 1.5 hours to fit me with 3 temporary crowns.  I left in pain and I've never been out of pain. It's been a month. I called and told them she's never touching me again.
I'm procrastinating because major dental work.  Does anyone want to hear about my dogs?  Rocky is all better but he still won't jump on the furniture and now we're thinking that may be how he hurt himself, jumping on the furniture.
@ihatethemedia but I need the dental work before I can chew through the bone.  I'm screwed either way.  üòâ
@ihatethemedia Thank you.  I have to go in tomorrow too.  I'd rather chew my arm off.
@CTIronman OH!   Hahahaha.  How some of you remember these minute details is beyond me.  But okay, there's a facet I'd not thought of. Increased need for police activity because yes, the black market would take over.  It's the stupidest thing I've heard of this week &amp; will kill tourism.
Now.  The teeth.  Ugh.  Thoughts and prayers appreciated.  For the dental assistant that is.  If she hurts me again like she did last time, someone is leaving the office bleeding.  And if it's me, I'm not going without a hostage.
He's right on all counts. 	And it's regarding this story.	https://t.co/ceAUkf48pb https://t.co/c1NKnme1j7

@esqcapades Thank you.  After this work is done, I'm looking for a new dental office.  The dental assistant hurt me badly when putting on the temporary crowns.  They are terrible.  I'm not looking forward to it.

@Jennanjack @CAFrump Later ladies!
@Jennanjack @CAFrump But he doesn't know that black face is offensive.  My BS o'' Meter is going off. Anyway, I'm out..  I've got things to do.  Thanks for the link, Jennifer.
@Jennanjack @CAFrump So, Northam knows that Civil war memorials might be offensive but he doesn't know that black face is and has to check with African American friends to be educated? I call bullshit.
@CAFrump @Jennanjack See.  That's the thing.  In this era, no youthful indiscretion is excused in politics.  Not in either party.  And 24 is not a kid. I say he's got to go.  If not, fine.  It's not my  State, not my party.  It will help the GOP though so he's going to have to consider that.
@SoCaliSteph Yeah, I agree which is why I added extra tweets and worded them very carefully and threaded them so that they'd not be taken out of context.
@Jennanjack @CAFrump What started all of this though? Did Gillespie do or say something or was this just by virtue of being in Trump's GOP?
@CAFrump It's "acting"?
@mom_grateful @CAFrump That and  the name "coonman."  ALL of it was just unknown to him?  I think not.
@SoCaliSteph I know which is why I added what I did on the thread in saying it may have just been my experience because that is all that I had to go off of.
@CAFrump Further, the quick apology, and then all the press not knowing "which one" was him is fishy.  By today, he figures no one knows or is coming forward.  He hedges his bets and says, hell, they can't prove it was me. It's a theory.
@CAFrump Also, as to the long forgotten bit.  He had to have seen it at some point.  At 24 yrs old and graduating med school, I'd have thrown a fit it that was on my page, attributed to me and it was not me.  It's not something I'd forget.
@CAFrump I don't like it either but there has to be a zero tolerance at this point. The lines have been drawn.  Again, if he was a Republican, he'd be long gone by now.  The Lt Governor would be sworn in.
@CAFrump I had that same thought last night.  And I think the Michael Jackson admission was a  manipulative ploy to divert attention and to try to indicate that he's just this good ole boy from VA who never even knew that such things are offensive. I don't buy it.
@CAFrump @mom_grateful @mattklewis I need to google all of that right now.  Because that indicates to me he's not as naive on racial matters as he's purporting to be.
@mom_grateful @CAFrump @mattklewis Well, he was the hero of the left for that this past week.  And I am positive that's how we came to see that photo that started this entire mess.  Where were the oppo researchers when he was running, I wonder.
@CAFrump @mattklewis I don't think I've seen anyone in either party wanting to give him any benefit of the doubt.  I'm usually the one who wants to in situations like this but no more.  Not after the Kavanaugh hit job.  They also skewered him over a word in his high school year book.  He was a kid.
@CAFrump @mattklewis Yep.  Matt says "I don't see how he holds on" and I agree.  Politically speaking, he's just a huge liability to the Dem party at this point.  Rubio skewered for taking a sip of water, the Kavanaugh debacle.  It's too much.  He's got to go one way or another. Even if by recall.
@DukkaA Yep.  It's not okay.  And, I don't think I believe him anyway, even if his excuse was a good one, which it's not!
@CAFrump Man.  I just have to say that I don't believe him and I rarely speak up as things are breaking.
@CAFrump @mattklewis I think I know what he's going to say but we shall see.  He surprises me sometimes but he's always thoughtful and completely fair.
@CAFrump I don't but it wasn't a thing in CA, ever that I can recall.  That's ALSO suspicious to me.  It was Virginia.  I find it tough to believe that he's JUST discovering that black face is offensive.
@CAFrump Matt Lewis is on CNN. I want to hear what he says.  I find him to be a completely sane voice in the insanity that is politics these days.
@CAFrump Concur.  And, I hate to be this way but I keep thinking of Kavanaugh. They gave him no quarter.  And he was just a kid.
@CAFrump Yes indeed.  I think he was gone within the hour.
@CAFrump I don't remember what happened with Gillespie.  I'm going to have to refresh my memory because if he accused him of being racist, how naive is he really to racially charged issues.  I just smell a rat here.
@CAFrump I don't know Cyndi.  Something is fishy about all of this.  The nickname "coonman" is of concern as well.  He doesn't know why it's there but at some point he had to have seen it.  If this was a GOPer, they'd be swearing in the Lt Gov by now.
Also of concern is that he doesn't know how he got the nickname "coonman."  Even if a Caucasian doesn't know that black face is racist, one would assume a gentleman from Virginia would suspect that "coonman" might be &amp; he saw that in the yearbook at some point!
WTAF.   Does it matter if it was Northam in black face in the year book or if he was in black face at a Michael Jackson party? I say no.  I knew, in 1984, in California that black face was not ok. And I'm younger than him and not a Governor! Insanity.

I will write something soon re how to read your EOB (Explanation of Benefits.)  I see many providers overcharging the patient &amp; then just keeping the over payments once they are paid by insurance. Generally they are keeping the PPO discount which they should be writing off. Fin/
For now I will just tell you this.  You have to be your own advocate. Check everything.  Get everything in writing and keep copies.  Check your bills &amp; make sure they get to the insurer timely, as you are ultimately responsible for all payments regardless of who is at fault. 4/
Thinking about doing a blog or a podcast or something to give people helpful hints, but truly these issues are complex to understand.  I'm finding myself more knowledgeable than many in the offices of the providers or insurers. It's a mess. 3/
This could be a factor in the growing opinion that Universal healthcare is attractive. People are tired of dealing with the bureaucracies.  I know that Universal H/care would be worse, but many others simply don't know this. 2/
The ineptness in the medical, dental &amp; insurance industries is truly astounding. The worst I've ever seen. I've no idea how a true layperson maneuvers it without just giving up.  I have many years experience in the benefits industry &amp; I'm having a hard time getting things done 1/

Rocky is unimproved and no worse either but he has been waking up crying in the night every night.  A call has been placed to his vet for pain meds or another visit.  I can't tell why he's crying and I'd rather err on the side of "he is in pain."

@DanLtcR @dwinegar1957 @smithjarrod2002 Yes.  The Dr's think the guidelines are law and in some cases the states have made laws on the restrictions of opioids.
And I know of 25 -45 million chronic pain patients that will do the same.  It's a #FentanylCrisis you morons..  Look at how Europe and Canada stopped people from dying. They did the exact opposite of what the US is doing. Prohibition never works. https://t.co/KIeKdqHT2i

@dwinegar1957 I have more than a few reporters on this topic who follow me.  I will send them your tweet if ok?
@dwinegar1957 Drugs that  have helped for thousands of years are suddenly being cut off and patients are legitimately and absolutely in horrifying pain.  Being cut from their meds or not given any.  The most insane thing I've ever seen from a government.
@dwinegar1957 I also have a twitter list of Chronic Pain advocates. I AM seeing more Dr's speaking up.  In general, I see more people speaking up who were afraid to for fear of being labeled a drug seeker.  And I DO see that happening too.  It's a mess.
@dwinegar1957 Okay Donna.  It's a huge problem right now and I'm worried about more suicides if they don't loosen up these regs now.  I don't think you could have done anything differently. The Dr's are afraid to order opioids because of the CDC and the DEA.
@dwinegar1957 Yes but it doesn't really help most people.  Some say they get some relief.  If you want in the group, please dm me and I'll let you in.  I don't know that it will be of any comfort to you now.

@dwinegar1957 @smithjarrod2002 It was not until her patient wound up in the hospital that the AMA spoke out against the CDC "guidelines."  The Dr's are treating them as "LAW."
@ihatethemedia SO not good and we think it's why the uptick in suicides.
@dwinegar1957 @smithjarrod2002 It does and that's part of the syndrome that is under-reported. Pain relief is a human right in Europe and Canada.  The US is going the other way.  And it's absolutely off base.  We have an illicit fentanyl crisis.

This is happening too often because of the @CDCgov "guidelines" and the inane state and federal laws and regs.  @POTUS must call off these CDC "guidelines" and the war on pain patients.  Hardly the first suicide I've heard of. It's a #FentanylCrisis https://t.co/O5k8qI82Rs

@_justbeachy Someone else recommended that but I don't want to give him anything without the vet's ok.  A dog in my Vizsla group died when the well meaning owner gave it too much Advil.   I just don't know dog medicine at all. I think the vet will give him something when I ask for it.

@JazzShaw This dog lives to run. I think I'm going to go post in my Vizsla group.  I've got a bunch of breeders and trainers in there and Europe should be up.  If we need to take him to a specialist,  we will. I don't want him in pain.  The thought causes me pain.  Thanks for all your help
@JazzShaw Dang it.  That's what I thought too.  We specifically asked him if he needed something for pain as I know that dogs can hide pain and he said no.  I'll call him again and if he says no, think about another vet.

@TammyJoHays Yeah. I think the same is true of Urgent Care's anywhere these days.  You have to have a good Dr/Patient relationship.
@willfleet I cannot stand him most days.  He just goes on and on and I don't like that in any anchor.
@TammyJoHays Hmmm.  Probably because they don't allow PA's to write them anymore but she's still trying to help the Dr. as much as possible.  So she is writing them and the Dr. is signing them.  That's my first guess.
@TammyJoHays Yep.  I heard the same about TX. Exactly the same but that's the only change I have heard of.  I do hope it stays that way and I think it likely will. I am ok with requiring an MD to write it. I think that's realistic for such strong meds.

@meadabawdy The same lawyers that sued big tobacco are now suing big pharma.  This is awesome.  A ton of baby boomers, about to need these legit meds as they get older and now this. And every other country is liberalizing drug policy and no one is dying.
@meadabawdy @dr4liberty I doubt it but he's right about the liability issues. Everyone is running scared. The Dr's the pharmacies and even the manufacturers now.  And the issue is with illegal fentanyl and heroin. SMH.

@Beyond_I_Do I'm HOPING that once we get to TX there will be more indies and fewer problems but CA is NOT a state that's really cracked down either.  It's madness.
@dr4liberty It's not worth it to go through this so I have been tapering off x 8 or so months.  I saw this coming when I heard all the b.s. with the opioids. It helps me, I could use it but it's not worth the hassle anymore.  Crazy.  TY for the input, Dr. Singer.
@dr4liberty In this case, they insist that the manufacturer did not send them enough. No one there is harassing me about the drug or the rx but no one also stepped up to help me.  I had to figure it all out and call, etc. Imagine the elderly.  And this is a schedule IV.  I am tapering off

@Beyond_I_Do That's exactly what I am going to do too.  Go to an independent pharmacy.  There are none near me but it's still got to be better than this.
This is also not true.  I was told it had to be e prescribed. NOW they are advising me to get a paper rx in the future. https://t.co/18hh1GSW4h
This is not true, btw.  Whoever told me this was dead wrong. A schedule 4 drug can be transferred within the same drug store. NO new state law. https://t.co/7SGUxckHz1
cc  Dr. Singer @dr4liberty 	and note, I still don't have the schedule 4 drug in hand.
and a pharmacist at the CVS at Hillcrest has JUST assured me that my long nightmare is nearly over.  They are filling it in full and it will be ready at 4:30.  I will keep you posted on that but this is totally unacceptable on so many levels.
They told me to get a paper script in the future to take to whatever CVS actually has it.  And I will but the problem is, I am technically breaking my controlled substance agreement with my Dr. The pharm said to have my Dr call him if he has a concern.  He won't.
This is a CVS issue but also a state of CA issue for forcing these idiotic controlled substance agreements on the Dr's.  And the pharmacist just told me that it's likely a problem with the state cutting supply on this drug that sparked this mess.
Not one person at 3 stores has apologized for my issues.  They say that "the manufacturer sends them whatever they want to and they have no control over it."  Well, neither do I.  And I have a contract with the Dr that says I MUST get all controlled substances from 1 pharmacy.
@nancyanne331 Unbelievable. I am now on the phone with another CVS and they appear to be filling it.  Freaking nightmare.
*SAGA https://t.co/wO7MCjOZNd
To continue this sage.  I STILL DO NOT have my rx.  4 days in.  Now CVS is *REALLY* trying to resolve it but it's "complex" because it's a controlled substance.  OMG.   This is insanity.  It's a VALID RX that I've been taking x 10 years with ZERO problems.

@wrongnowshutup2 It's bad.  This is not going to end well.  I used to have to go pick up my rx.  It was an hour to pick it up, two hours for it to be filled, and an hour home.  So 5 hours to pick up an rx. Now though, it's two days.  And truth be told, this was CVS's fault for not having my drug

I am well versed in these things. Have been a pharmacy tech and an insurance exec and it still took me two days to get this resolved. Imagine the elderly and the critically ill who cannot resolve it and just give up.  Our medical system is taking a nosedive due to all these regs.
- and ask him what to do.  He says again "yes, everything you are telling me is absolutely true." Then he says "do nothing."  The other CVS will not fill it. They will see that I am filling it. Come get your one day's supply. And end scene. It's a tragedy.
Update.  It's probably fixed.  I called original pharmacy &amp; nice pharmacist says "yes everything you are telling me is true." I ask him to give me a day's supply. He says yes. Meanwhile, Dr. calls in the new rx to the other CVS.  I call nice pharmacist back and tell him.
@esqcapades He's not happy either.  He kept saying "everything you are telling me is absolutely true and exactly what has happened."  I'm thinking, yes, I know it is.  Crazy.  It's over now for this month anyway.
@esqcapades OMG.  It's even worse. As I am on the phone with HIM, my Dr. finally calls the new rx into the other CVS. I had to call him back and ask him what to do. He said "nothing." Do nothing. They won't fill it anyway.  This is madness and things like this happen all the time.

I've been trying to get an rx filled x 2 days. It's been at the pharmacy since the 3rd but they are out. I need it before their order comes in. I transferred it to another in the same chain. They need my Dr. to order a new one. He doesn't understand. We're at an impasse.

@kansaspider @JerryBrownGov Yep.
@mojeaux18 @corrcomm We were going to stay for about five years.  We've decided not to risk it and just go now.
@JazzShaw @SeanTheProducr Rocky is fine.  The vet says it's just a sprain.  Rocky got to the vet, jumped out of the truck, jumped all around the vet's office with a waggly tail.  No pain meds needed.  He said just let him be &amp; it will be fine.  Minor sprain.   We're so relieved!
@oski1977 @GavinNewsom I do think that some of them start leaving for Austin though.  It's getting to be a pretty big tech hub.  I'll be watching it all from near there. I can't take this anymore and am tired of being worried about what new taxes CA is going to impose.  We are out of here.
@oski1977 @GavinNewsom He won't cave.  It's his lifetime goal we are talking about here.  I think he won't get universal care passed right now as the Congress has to approve it.  It won't be approved but I think it then goes to SCOTUS and I am not positive they don't side with CA.  I just don't know.
@island_girl421 The entire country is on a not good trajectory with the uber leftists in the Dem party and the populists in the GOP.  I too am worried.
@mojeaux18 @corrcomm I am seceding.  I'm seceding to Texas.  I've had enough and as much as we can afford to take.
@JazzShaw @SeanTheProducr We're looking to sell this place and buy a new home in a new state.  I've been thinking about a one story anyway since both dogs will (hopefully) get old eventually. And I can't carry them if I had to. Scout is 85 lbs &amp; Rocky is 65 lbs. James can. We'll see.
@SeanTheProducr @JazzShaw Thank you though.  I'm going to nap.  I've been up all night worrying about him.  As soon as I know how he is, I'll tweet about him.
@SeanTheProducr @JazzShaw He's off to the vet in 4 hours anyway and he's not even trying to run around. He wouldn't or couldn't walk up the stairs last night.  We'll know soon enough and I don't want to mis-read my self diagnosis and make myself sick over it.  He's basically just been lying on his bed .
@rm1evo Yeah but the only people who listen to those guys are already dialed into political news.
@SeanTheProducr @JazzShaw Ugh.  I'm not trying it but thank you.  We don't even know how he hurt it.  He was borded on the weekend and something could have happened there I guess.  I am hoping it's only minor. We sure didn't see anything.
@rm1evo Yeah, maybe.  I didn't see a ton of news, tbh, as I was so worried about Rocky.  What I did see featured Dutch Newsom and his binky.
The new governor said California would be a "sanctuary to all who seek it," challenging the immigration policy of a White House he called corrupt and incompetent.   https://t.co/dmKnkggrh4
@JazzShaw Okay.  Thanks very much and I'll probably take you up on that.  I know they gave both of them Ultram after their snippings and that was quite effective and didn't alter them that we could tell.  But if it's a long term med they may use something else.
@tcoley1 These leftists of the Gavin Newsom type have no idea what "cut taxes" means and they have zero plans to do that. Their plan is to raise taxes for their socialist utopia agenda.
@rm1evo and lunch and after dinner tacos.
As an example, most of the local stations didn't even run this story last night. Rather, they showed his adorable two year old son, Dutch, who stole the show with his binky and blankie.  Not a word about the Universal healthcare or the mandate or the illegal immigrant care. etc https://t.co/W2WAHP57Oz
@island_girl421 Yep.  That's when I called my realtor in Riverside county and told him we're moving to Texas after all.  I give up.  The state won.  We were going to stay for another five or so years but I'm afraid he'll tank the housing market here.
@island_girl421 I don't think the average Californian knows about it yet and they won't know until it's enacted. No one here pays attn to politics absent those who are online already and the older folks.  The millennials have no clue.
I honestly don't know how publicly traded companies in CA are going to explain why they are staying in CA to their shareholders.  I know we've seen a lot of business flee this past few years but I think the @GavinNewsom years will being another full on Texodus for those remaining
@MaryWalberg I always knew it would be Newsom who would send us heading for Texas.  And in his first day on the job, he validated that.
@drk4043 Oh lord.  He's way further left than Jerry Brown.  He will make Brown look like Reagan.  I've said this for years.  He's a legit gun grabbing socialist.  Jerry Brown was a gun owner, &amp; a fiscal conservative in comparison.
@UnbridledMd Not the pain med rx's.  They specifically cited the Narcan.  And I googled it really quickly and it appears at least R.I. requires it for anyone on more than 90MME.  Madness.
@UnbridledMd That sounds about right but I'd pay cash or not use a credit card in any event. But I'm getting a bit paranoid about this stuff so it may be ok. Yes, some of the chronic pain patients on low doses were forced to get it also and at least one was denied life insurance due to the rx
@JazzShaw Poor Jake.  I'm worried that Rocky is in pain too.  I read that they hide it well.  And he isn't acting otherwise normal at all.  No tail wagging, etc.  I am just hoping it's only a strain.  He's only 4 and loves to run.
After taking office, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a sweeping health care overhaul. State-funded coverage would extend to young people in the country illegally, and anyone who doesn't buy insurance would be fined. https://t.co/dr2FhOyhoo
Foie Gras (the food) has been banned in California &amp; the SCOTUS has refused to hear the case.  You all fight over that. I'll be eating tacos in Texas.  https://t.co/UIuwMp7oo0

@JazzShaw I see what happened.  And they had to do surgery.  Poor guy.
@JazzShaw Jazz, what happened to Jake? This was Rocky last night, eating on 3 legs. His appointment is in 5.5 hours and I'm counting the minutes. He wouldn't walk upstairs to go to bed last night. I had to stay downstairs with him.  I'm so worried.  He's not whining or anything. Was Jake? https://t.co/zhq73oExqQ
@UnbridledMd Here it is.  https://t.co/IMSCwQDF2R
@UnbridledMd They are denying life insurance to people who have Narcan.  I just read a piece on it a couple of weeks ago.  It was either an EMT or a nurse. It wasn't the first time I'd "heard" that either.
@LynnSchott Oh, yes.  Same mind set applies to the Spaniel groups.  haha.
@ThatElJefe Thank you.
@JazzShaw Thank you.  I hope so too.  Is Jake ok now?
@kparker9866 Thank you!

@SaintMooney Can I ask where outside of Austin?  We are thinking around Dripping Springs.  It's where my cousin is and they just absolutely love it.  And I adore him and his wife.
@SaintMooney That's what my cousin and his wife say too and they went to the same area. We are many years away from retirement.  I guess we need to plan a visit.  I'm not shocked and always knew it may come down to this after all.  Maybe better earlier than later. IDK.
@SaintMooney We're selling the house this summer and had planned to go to TX. Then we decided to try to stay here for about five years.  However, I think our plans just changed again.  It sucks too. Our business will be impacted negatively by moving out of state.
Further, I am a moderate and think Dreamers should get legal status at the least. But when my state starts taxing me to pay for illegal immigrants health care.  It's a bridge too far.  The people of CA should be making such huge decisions, not the Governor.
"a requirement that all consumers in the state carry health insurance" - and I don't qualify for the government subsidies unless I divorce my husband.  So, keep the lights on TX.  We really did want to stay here but I don't know how we can. This is the first damn day.
Further, @GavinNewsom adds a new individual mandate. I just lost my $900 per month ACA premium and went with a Sharing Ministry. And I am going to bet that those do NOT qualify as "insurance."  There is no way we can stay under these terms. Govt overreach in the highest order.
@SaintMooney https://t.co/nlSe4366om
@mom_grateful True.
.@GavinNewsom has been Governor for four hours.  His "resist" move is said to be a "rebuke to Trump." I see it more as a rebuke to the ACA which is the prevailing insurance law of the land.  Either way, I'm stuck in the middle, paying for it.  https://t.co/nlSe4366om  #CApolitics
@IL0VEthe80s It's what we kept our weed in. Duh.
@SaintMooney On top of everything else? Not many.  I'm reading that the legislature has it's laundry list of things they want but Newsom is urging restraint.  We'll see.  I'm trying not to panic on his first day.
@SaintMooney That's why I asked for clarification and yes, it is very different.  And another reason why we will never have any actual employees in CA.  And why CA continues to bleed employers to places like TX.
@SaintMooney I have to catch up with this later.  If this is what he's after, it could actually be worse depending on the terms.  I don't personally like them but the US Senate almost passed something like this under Trump.  https://t.co/hDDJX9I9xw
@DonPringle Stunning.  Okay, that's where we will stay if we go.  Not in a B and B though.  I don't like them.

Newsom is just off. Politics aside, there is something about his affect that's just not right. He laughs at the wrong moments for example.  Not a charismatic politician by any means.   Anyway, adios Gov Brown.  I never thought I'd actually miss you but I already do.

@Lonestarmomcom @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio Haha. Yep.  That came to mind.  No steak!
@desertdave2012 @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio I took a peek a few hours ago and more than a few lists had him on it.  I'm going to look at them all in a bit but am in the middle of a home project.
@desertdave2012 @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio He truly was.  I consider myself blessed to have lived during his time on earth.  And I'm comforted that we have his words. So many words.  I figure many of his writings will still be pertinent in hundreds of years.
@Lonestarmomcom @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio Too funny.  It wouldn't have been prudent to have George Washington either because of his wooden teeth.  He could probably have eaten sushi but that would have been all new to him.  Too much of a culture shock.
@Lonestarmomcom @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio He was talking about the gig/sharing economy and not spending money on college if it did not suit you.  "Others" were talking about how to revive the 1950s.    Anyway, as he said, yesterday is over.  I'm still trying to adjust though.  haha.
@Lonestarmomcom @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio Heh.  They could have a worse role model.  It's also part of his appeal.  He's young enough to speak to the kids.  He knows tech. He likes rap, etc.  Another reason I put him on the save the world list.  Millennial appeal.
@Lonestarmomcom Oh yeah.  The three amigos.  I think they are likely still good friends. In fact, I'd bet good money on it.
@Lonestarmomcom @krauthammer @NikkiHaley @marcorubio I am not surprised.  He has appeal to a lot of Dems as well which is why I put him on there.  Most of the nasty tweets I see about him are from die hard Trumpians, not leftists.  And only when he dares speak out against the agenda.

@AmyA1A Well, you'd likely not get them for a bad tooth extraction anymore.  It depends.  A whole lot of chronic pain patients are suffering and some are committing suicide.  The CDC and the government(s) have overreached, big time.  And yes, based on false information.

This is actually my second pass at this cupboard.  The loose recipes went in the trash before I took a pic. I saved 3 collectors editions of the Bon Appetit's and mostly my mom's cookbooks. 2 from my childhood. It's a huge downsize.
My husband is the chef so there was a minor skirmish over the cookbook cupboard. It was full and that box was stuffed with recipes.  The 3rd pic is the after.  There were 3 years of Bon Appetit magazines from the early 2000s #minimalist in training. Keeping the bottom row. https://t.co/lqjSTUywDA

@willfleet You're welcome.  I've gotten a lot better over the years but we now have to do it since we're moving.  It's getting easier the more I do.  Matt discusses this a lot on his pods btw.
@JmeMiller1974 @ThatElJefe Yep.  Mine are already in the garage in a box.  I had decided to burn them at one point but not sure I'm going to.  It's sort of sacrilegious to me to burn books so I may donate them.  We'll see. I'm in the "sorting" books phase.
@ThatElJefe I believe you.  I've thought about doing it too and I still may.  Probably some of the same authors too.  Levin comes to mind.  I don't even know all of what I have out there.
@ThatElJefe OH, funny you say that.  I've thought of what to do with "those" books and I still don't know.  Right now, they are in a separate box in the garage so they don't spread their b.s. to the other things.  They are in isolation.
@Shoeboxnre Ha ha, yes.  Not hoarders but definitely pack rats.  And we own a business too. You should see all the paper we are getting rid of.  It feels so good.
And if my nieces and nephews don't want them, they can easily donate or sell them many, many years from now, God willing.  And thankfully, I'm the only book aficionado in the family.  My husband is not an avid book reader.  So that's my exception.
It's something I'm not even going to worry about.  Books will be passed down to my nieces and nephews. Most are classics or historical etc.  In other words, they are not novels and they are much loved.  Keeping many of the books.
I do have one thing that I know I'm not going to downsize much and that is books.  I am donating some of my father's books as I'll never read his many volumes on WWII or Churchill or The New Deal.  I think it's ok to have an exception.  Books are my most treasured possessions.

For more photos of my two gorgeous Vizsla dogs, Scout and Rocky, look in my media section.  I also don't mind answering any questions anyone may have because again, they are not for everyone.  #Dogs #DogsOfTwitter #Vizslas
I intend to write more about the Vizsla in the coming year because knowledge is power.  I see far too many of them relinquished to rescues as the owners think they are great dogs but have no clue how much attention they require.
They are a beautiful, smart and loyal dog but they are not for everyone due, in large part, to their neediness.  Honestly, it's like having a set of perpetual two year old twins.  They cannot sleep outside nor be left alone for long periods.
The Vizsla was almost extincted several times due to war. Most recently in WWII. The landowners and their dogs were executed. A woman managed to escape to England with a dozen Vizslas &amp; from those 12, the breed was saved.
It's a fascinating history for the dog lover.  There are many pieces out there and none are exactly perfect for my taste so I hope one day to write one.  Here's a little something in the meantime.  https://t.co/rEGVirJLxu
The extreme attachment to their owners and necessity of sleeping with us goes back at least 1000 years when the Magyars owned what is now known as the Vizsla in what is now called Hungary.  They slept in caves with their hunters and have never changed their ways.
If you think it's weird, don't get a Vizsla.  Their nickname is "Velcro Vizsla" as they never want to be out of sight of their owners.  They also have no undercoat so are susceptible to both heat and cold.
My cousin's wife just put a pic on FB of their dog in bed with them and asked if this is normal.  I don't know if it's "normal" Lisa, but Vizslas insist upon it.  We each had one  last night.  Rocky snuggling with my husband in my former spot. Living La Vizsla Loca. https://t.co/d5zjQTgQEC

@EdB_Ohio @MarlaMHughes People should be able to buy whatever dog they want.  As usual, CA oversteps.  I did rescue my two purebred Vizslas but it is amazing that I was able to.   At any rate, we'll see how it goes.

Further in doggie politics, the type of collar one uses.  If you should spay or neuter and at what age.  My Vizsla groups are insane and I never post in there. I was once chastised because Scout's nails were too long.  #ResistDogPolitics

I've never seen this one. Nor has James. Though we have both seen older ones than this.  The first ones were MASSIVE and uber expensive.  I think about $2,500.00.  My older brother had one.  It was ridiculous. https://t.co/jTNKqbU4qV
@_eisenzopf Holy moly. What year was this?  I've seen older cell phones, or larger ones, but I've never seen this particular one.
@bdp514am @LovinBlue Next year, a 20 year Y2K anniversary party for all of us who missed NY Eve that year.  Y2k 2.0, worldwide.  It's a thing.
OMG.  That's what made it so huge.  The ENTIRE internet had to be fixed.  Even dead language systems. https://t.co/MGzc4S9ODV
Next year.  Y2k redux.  For all the people who were sitting in offices on NY Eve 2000.  I know one thing, it will be less work to plan a world wide party than it took to fix the Y2K bug. #HappyNewYear2019 It's on.
It's still all greek to me but I actually know what she's talking about here.  The non geeks had to hear it all and a certain amount of it stuck.  They did a LOT of work.  We need a 20 year Y2K party next year for all the people who missed NY Eve 2000. https://t.co/dkswp0RYMb
@_eisenzopf I have never seen this.. Was this a car phone?
@rm1evo Yeah.  And I cannot have that without Champagne, at least a sip.  So it's a party.
You did a good job, Bobby.  Managers, like me, had only the vaguest idea at first what it was.  But we were there, NY Eve 1999 in our offices, on the phones with the geeks. Mine were in Miami.  It was perfection.  Poetry in motion how y'all fixed that mess. https://t.co/OxL2C4xAcU
It should be said that the Y2K thing was HUGE and it would have been apocalyptic but for the geeks diligent work.  I think we had meetings for 4 years about it. And we never really knew until Midnight at the year 2000 if they had fixed it all.  They did.  Shout out to the geeks! https://t.co/dFfnCjoNcY
I was just informed "I do have caviar, you know that right?"  	I didn't, but I should have.  He knows me well.
RT @Vicki_Lemonds: @hipEchik I got my first cell phone (a clunky Motorola flip phone in 96 or 97).
Sorry millennials but it was we who were on the cutting edge of technology.  We paved the path. https://t.co/rU6CZQr13R
96-98 Nokia owned the entire North American market.		And then Motorola came out with the StarTAC and everybody switched to flip phones. - Per my FB friend and that's how I remember it too.
@Sassy_101010 Haha.  I could.  It's a classic.  And it's only cut low in the back.  I love that gown.  Velvet with rhinestones on it.  And yes, when Rubio is elected, I'll be there. :)
That is a Nokia IIRC.  THAT may have been my first phone and a Motorola Flip phone my second. https://t.co/52LWS3spvv
@rm1evo Awww, thanks.    He was my bosses son.  The boss never knew.   I don't think.
@AdelaidaFall We had pagers until about 97 and then flip phones came out and were cheap.  That's the year we all got them in San Diego anyway.  At least those of us in the business world. He had a Verizon "Envy" flip phone with a qwerty keyboard.  I had a Motorola.
@AdelaidaFall No. We had cell phones in 97.  I remember because my dad was in the hospital in the Bay Area and I was calling work from the Kaiser parking lot.  They were flip phones.  I didn't use a phone cam until much later though my phones probably had them.  I didn't know how to use it.
@txsguy09 agree
@AdelaidaFall James said our phones had cameras on them in 98 but this was taken with a camera.
@AdelaidaFall Yes, it was.   Well, we had cell phones then but I don't think they had cameras on them yet.
@AngieShustock Happy New Year and thanks!  ü•≥üíò

I will likely have to do a HIPAA waiver in order for her to do this for me. All things I will deal with later. They also may have a department that helps with this stuff in the event that a person is critically ill or injured.  Not sure.
Finally, I did find a person to handle the paperwork and the discounting, etc. in the event I am very ill or injured.  It is my niece who also works in the health insurance industry and knows how to maneuver all of the many hurdles that can prevent people from doing this.
As I continue on this journey with the Health Sharing Ministry, I will chronicle the ups and downs.  Possibly in a blog or on Medium.  I won't have issues with this discounting because it's what I used to do for a living. For you, it may be too much.  That's it for today.  An FYI
So, that's something that people need to be aware of.  CVS does not discount controlled substances and this may be true of all chain pharmacies, not sure.  For ME, it's a few dollars per month and the rx's would have gone to my NEW RX deductible in 2019 anyway. Just be aware.
I think this is probably due to the pharmacies extra work that has to be done with controlled substances due to increased diligence, federal regulations, etc. It may also be *this* chain which I don't want to leave because they are good to me. No problems.
I called my chain pharmacy today &amp; they don't discount controlled substances.  For me, it's fine. I don't get many per month anyway &amp; the retail price is minimal.  For you, this could be a problem, if you are on a larger amount of controlled substances or yours are expensive.
I have already run into my first (minor for me) glitch.  The subscriber (me) has to obtain our own discounts on everything. I'd already done this at UCSD &amp; it's a massive discount.  cont -

Oh wait, one more thing. Kamala Harris.  And I don't know what about Harris. The Dems don't need CA. Also, she has some rumored vetting issues.  You might see her paired with Joe Biden.  It's a wild guess but one I've thought about for awhile now.  She is running for VP.
Back to my previously scheduled work so I can hopefully knock off early today and enjoy the last day of the year.
People should really look at policy instead of likability too. In terms of policy, O'Roarke and Klobuchar has some vast differences.  But he has the silver tongue and that sells.
Robert Francis O' Roarke will be the one to beat.  He's got the Obama personality, comes across as a moderate and people just love him.  So, that's your Dem challenger.  Either him or Klobuchar, who IS actually a moderate(ish).  We shall see how well this tweet ages.

I've never really done New Year's resolutions but I will for 2019.  And top of the list is to further whittle down my interest in things political that do not affect me directly.  So, choosing my battles even more selectively.  And you?
We have a ton of personal issues to deal with in 2019 including continuing to renovate this home, sell it, and move.  There is more too that I shan't tweet about. And to do all this, I have to tune out the rest of the world a bit more. It's about striking a balance.
I like watching these end of year recaps of all that went down in the past year.  It always seems like it was a very long year though and 2018 was perhaps one of the longest.  Constant chaos and drama is draining, and that's what we had.  I vow to try to further tune it out in 19

@qmorgan147 @ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle I partially agree with you.  Compromise but I think the electorate should dig in and demand that this congress pass an immigration bill. Otherwise the politicians will continue to use immigrants as political pawns. And both sides do this.

I wasn't the only one who noticed the lack of condolence tweets by California representatives on the death of Corporal Singh.  @Cameron_Gray checked the entire CA Congress, GOP and Dem,  and it's not good.  https://t.co/X3pqkhkus5

@sav01 Okay. I am not going to argue with you.  I see it as exactly the same as people blaming the politicians and/or the NRA for someone else shooting a gun.
@sav01 No they aren't.  That's like saying that Marco Rubio was responsible for the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas which IS what the left says.  And none of those three make CA laws.  The state lawmakers, have some culpability, maybe, but not the Fed reps.  I have to disagree,

Further, I find it inexcusable that neither @JerryBrownGov or Governor Elect @GavinNewsom have tweeted anything regarding Corporal Singh's murder.

The live stream cut off but it should be noted that the Stanislaus Country Sheriff  did reference CA SB 54, the sanctuary city law.   I will try to find a comprehensive piece about the arrest asap.  #RIPCorporalSIngh
The suspect in Corporal Singh's death had multiple aliases with multiple Facebook pages.  He believes that Arrieaga was alone when he committed the crime (though they did arrest his two brothers for aiding and abetting.)
He says that the location of the suspect has been under surveillance for "at least the past 24 hours."  "Constant Surveillance."  "We received hundreds of tips" in this case.
The Stanislaus County Sheriff  is cautioning that there is "a lot of misinformation out on social media."  And if you don't hear it from them, do not believe it.
"this can potentially be a capital case, we don't know."  Stanislaus sheriff on Gustavo Arriaga
The Stanislaus County sheriff is citing CA laws and say "this is not how you protect a community."  "we need to have a conversation about that."  he says...

@dikell3 I do too.  I have a friend who was on a capital jury and it really took a toll on him.  He was not the same for several years.  They did sentence him to death but my friend had PTSD I think from the photos and the gruesomeness of it all.  It was horrid.

@Radiocop Also, there is a presser at noon, ICYMI.
@Radiocop https://t.co/fv6z71qSWk
@dikell3 I'm on the fence.  My mind is changing but I'm not all the way there yet. Especially when things like this happen.
I know.  I said "The suspect was arrested in Bakersfield which is south of Stanislaus county. " And I referenced Stanislaus since that is where the crime occurred. https://t.co/zkQqGtpWIs
@dikell3 I assure you, they will go for the max and we do still have the death penalty here.  Technically.
So as not to confuse you, I say "Stanislaus County"  It's the same area as "Newman."  I know the area pretty well and don't know where Newman is exactly but it is rural CA.  Very red until this year.  Cop killers won't see any mercy.  I assure you..  https://t.co/zRIe7kR3Zc
The suspect was arrested in Bakersfield which is south of Stanislaus county. Stanislaus is notoriously hard on criminals. Even lesser criminals.  The D.A. there shows no mercy and goes for the jugular.  Even non violent criminals see prison time.  It's a very tough on crime place

@MarlaMHughes No. It's quite a large rug.  Agreed on the pillows.  I think I've got it now.  Just putting some things on Pinterest and will then decide what to buy.  I may also add some yellow out there. I can do that with paint on the terracotta plant pots or similar small stuff.
@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle Perfect!  You've helped more than you know.  Blessings to you as well!  Lovely chatting with you.
@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle Nope. Not higher end.  We're cashing out here and downsizing there.  Thanks so much for all the info.
@oski1977 Thanks, Hank.
@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle Good to know.  I know we can get a whole lot more with our purchasing dollar there.  We were looking at Temecula mainly for the equity building but I expect that Murrietta will catch up in not very many years. The entire county is just exploding.  Can't wait to get up there. ;-)
@marnes OH, that was a compliment to me.  WHOOSH, right over my head. Thank you so much but it is about the people who interact too.  I do sort of insist on being civil and maybe by now, people know that.  Plus, I dumped a bunch of the nasty ones.
@marnes Absolutely.  You just have to stay off of politics.  And I am trying to, more and more these days.  I have some great followers/followees though, whatever the topic.  I don't often have problems.
@MarlaMHughes They really are.  AND, it's an indoor/outdoor rug.  So, we'll see.  I love the patio though. We put it in ourselves, 17 years ago.  I doubt I want to cover it up but ya never know.

Thanks all.  I've decided.  You helped spark the creative thinking.  I am going with blues and greens for the patio.  This is all super important since we're staging this place to sell it and a wide variety of opinions are appreciated!
@rm1evo Thanks.
@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle Sounds good and thanks so much!  We may be priced out of Temecula but we'll see. It depends on what we can get for this place.  We're looking at Murrietta as well.
@MarlaMHughes @marnes Good suggestions all.  I'm going with blue and green cushions and umbrella to match this   https://t.co/EJSZ34cpFq then I will get to the plants and such.
@jerieblack Okay. Thank you.  I'm not painting this furniture though.  I like black wrought iron and some of it is new.
@mom_grateful I'm going with blue and green.   And I'm not far from the beach either.  The entire house is being staged in variations of blues and greens (and beige) and black and white in the master. https://t.co/EJSZ34cpFq
I think I've decided.  This rug is in the living room, just inside the french doors out to the patio.  I like the thought of red but I think I'm going with blue and green.  It takes the indoors outside and vice versa.  Thanks for your help.  All it took was some twitter input. https://t.co/m5JRuzMNjo
Okay.  I know what will resolve this staging issue.  A pic of the rug in my living room which is right inside this patio.  brb.
@mom_grateful Hahahaha!  You see my dilemma!  I love red too and it fades to this perfect pinkish color.  Goes great with the tile roof and the patio.  I'm just stuck on this.  Not sure why. I'm having no problems in the house.
@mom_grateful I do too.  It's why I use it.  Thanks mucho.
@MarlaMHughes @marnes I actually may put a lemon tree in one corner but the other corners of the yard have palms in them.  The yard is lined in vines, bougainvillea and other red, purple and bright pink vines and one rose bush.  I like the idea of potted lime green things though!  I'll kill the herbs
RT @mom_grateful: @hipEchik I like green with accents of your choice but I have very conservative taste. https://t.co/zA6htIF2Td
@mom_grateful I like green but I want something bolder out there. The plants and vines are all purples, reds etc. A lot of bougainvillea and other vines.  That green is exactly the sage color I just did the guest room in though.
@marnes But I also had some thoughts of mixing blue with yellow.  The other side of the color wheel contrasts can be interesting as well.  Still, I think the blue and green will be better in a Mediterranean/Spanish style home patio. Plus, it has a coastal feel.
@marnes The blue would have to be the "sea blue" as in the sample.  The cushions to fit this chaise are tough to find.  This is my working board on the blues and the greens.  I too think the blue should be dominant. https://t.co/d91lR1Oam1

@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle ..and thank you for following ;-)

@dikell3 https://t.co/tpHItXzcnr
@ABlackAmericanM @IngrahamAngle Turn it on and decide for yourself.  It's coming up after the break again.  I thought it was completely unbiased and accurate reporting. As I said, they even called the suspect "an illegal immigrant."
@dikell3 I do too!  My husband got me that for Christmas.  I chose it though. Love, love, love it.  It's extra wide so finding cushions was tough.  But I did find some and now, to decide on the color ;-)
@BoreGuru I already have all the furniture.  It's fine here.  Nothing rusts.  I just need the cushions and umbrella.
..and I will put up a large sun umbrella in a stand, similar to this, but not this color.  Other than that, there will be no decor except a variety of plants and vines in terracotta (like the patio) containers. https://t.co/6303Ej0Eq8
There is a black wrought iron bistro set, similar to this but with an inlaid top which I think has some blue in the mixture.  I can't get to it right now to check.  It just needs two round cushions for the chairs. https://t.co/3xH7eLunSY
There are two of these chaise lounges in black wrought iron. https://t.co/sPXJEBLvTc
@dikell3 Thank you, Diane! I do too.  I am trying to figure out what color(s) for the patio furniture cushions and umbrella.  The chaise lounge and bistro set are black wrought iron but I need to buy the accessories. I am staging the house to sell it and want the back patio to be gorgeous

@sav01 I don't either but will BOLO.  I think it's more regional rather than a state fund.  That's what I recall from the officer who died in the Borderline shooting.
@marnes It's stamped concrete so it looks like Mediterranean style tile.  This color.  I like sage indoors but am thinking a brighter green and a deep blue mixture of fabrics outside. https://t.co/AjcDz7bqOk
@sav01 Arrest him or kill him trying to arrest him.  Literally everyone I know was sharing the posts last night.  This cop was so young too.  It's heart wrenching.
@sav01 I think they're going to arrest him today.  It's a gut feeling.  They know who it is if I heard right and I think I did.
@marnes I won't mix red and green.  I'm leaning towards green and blue.  Thoughts?
@rm1evo I was kidding.
@oski1977 Agree!  So which would you choose?  Both the red and the blue will fade badly but I am buying it mostly to stage this home for sale.  It will work in the next home too though.  And I won't spend a ton so even if it fades, it's no biggie.

I have to wonder if *some* who yelp about the media ad nauseum ever turn off Fox News long enough to see what "the media" is actually covering.  Because the tragic slaughter of officer Ron Singh is being heavily covered. I suspect there will be an arrest today too. Hope I'm right

@DonPringle @willfleet OH LORDY.  No more joking around for me.  We used to all the time. This has impacted the Dr/Patient relationship. And I get an 8 day supply. Imagine the ppl on large amounts. They have to go to pain mngt Dr's and in some states, by law.
@DonPringle @willfleet This does not feel like America anymore.
@DonPringle @willfleet OMG.  That's another thing. ARE YOU DEPRESSED?  The correct answer is NO or they will take your guns.
@DonPringle @willfleet and HE cannot do anything about it.  It's the med centers policy.  Because of the CDC "guidelines."  So there you have it.  I cannot ever have alcohol because of the feds.
@DonPringle @willfleet I have my second test a few months ago. I made sure it was positive. I wanted to see if he'd remember so I say "it's going to be positive." He says "Good. Otherwise I'd be asking you who you are selling them to."  MADNESS I tell you. And the bill for the UA is $100.00.
@DonPringle @willfleet Never asked for an increase in quantity. Had told him for years "I don't take them every day."  The first test, I am negative. He cuts me off. I have to remind him I told him for years "I don't take them every day." He gives them back.
@DonPringle @willfleet So, on the days of my Dr appts I have to take one (and drive on it) even if I am not in pain.  Because if you don't test positive, you are selling them. OMG. The madness of this. And this is my Dr of 10 years.  Never asked for an early fill. Never asked for an increase in dose
@DonPringle @willfleet and if I ever test positive, I will be cut off. As will anyone and everyone.  And people have been.. People with horrendous pain.  I haven't even gotten to the harm of the pain contract yet. I cannot test NEGATIVE for opiates or they will take my 8 day supply away.
@DonPringle @willfleet I used to have a drink but rarely. Now I cannot have any.  Anyone with a recurring pain rx has to sign a contract agreeing not to drink at all. Not a sip. Ever.  I get an 8 day supply of meds but am forced on a contract that someone with cancer strength pain meds has to sign

@TammyJoHays We're not expanding as yet but I am starting to map out some plans in case we have to, and if this keeps up, we might. I am going to open another business (hopefully) in 2020 too.   Unless we go into a recession &amp;  If so, it will wait. Glad you are busy!  I hope this keeps up.
RT @hipEchik: @desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet Just to clarify why I am tweeting about it so much.  I am not advocating for pain meds‚Ä¶
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet If you want to help, write your reps. Tell them that the CDC "guidelines" of 2016 are being abused and misunderstood and they should be completely rescinded. The truth is, there is no upper limit to what severe pain patients can have under a Dr's care.
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet Absolutely right. And that is why I am trying to help them.  On the plus side, I am seeing a ton of people learn about the adverse effects of government being in control of anything health related.  If there is a plus.  Still, they are truly suffering. It's hard to even listen to
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet LOL.  Okay, we are good. :-)
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet Yep.  I take rx strength Aleve with a rx anti nausea for my migraines.   If I catch them early, it's very effective.  It can be tough on kidneys though so one should never exceed the rx dosage (with your Dr's ok.)  Glad it works for you too. It's a miracle drug for moderate pain.
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet Just to clarify why I am tweeting about it so much.  I am not advocating for pain meds. I am advocating against govt induced suffering.  And It IS happening, en masse, and to the point where ppl are killing themselves.  It's wrong.
@gidgey It's a good piece with good advice, Gidg.  Didja read it?  As for you, he's going to be there as soon as you quit looking. I swear and I promise.  Quit looking.  ;-)
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet Just an FYI, Aleve is a better OTC pain killer than Advil and has fewer severe side effects, like heart attack.  Check with your Dr. I am not one. I do take a TON of Aleve though.  I don't break out the rx meds unless I have to.
@desertdave2012 @DonPringle @willfleet That's what you should do.  None of the stuff I tweet is meant to imply that these drugs don't have addictive properties, they do.  Also though, no one in the US should be suffering from extreme pain due to draconian Fed regs and they are. There *is* a balance to be found.

@TammyJoHays and yet I am listening to Fox news right now talking about the coming slow down and I have been hearing it. It's just not what we are seeing.  At least not yet.   I am just praying they are wrong. I do think real estate is gonna slow down due to interest rate hikes.
@DonPringle @willfleet Yeah, nor mine. I don't like not being in control.  I have to imagine that it's sort of what heroin is like.  I mean, I was HIGHhhhh.  Not a good feeling. I hate being drunk for the same reason.  No control.  And I don't much like excessive drinkers either.
@TammyJoHays YES!  Are you a small biz owner also?  Nor can I catch up.  I have 10k emails in my in bin.  I'm ignoring them all and I normally would not.  We started upping our marketing too and boom, this all happens.  It's normally our slow time of year.  It's crazy!  I love it though.
@DonPringle @willfleet This was Demerol.  It killed my pain and shut me up.  And, I saw dragons in the kitchen.;-)
@DonPringle @willfleet I have to run. Suddenly, we are super busy.  Not sure what's going on but I am ever so grateful.  I will chat with you gentlemen later...
@DonPringle @willfleet Other than that, never gotten high off of a pain med.
@DonPringle @willfleet Yep.  Me too.  I can attest to getting high off of one pain med but it was in the 90s, it was given in the ER and it was a massive amount. Also, the Dr's know it gets people high. It's why they give it, to shut people up.  It's called the Golden shot. Kills the pain, shuts ppl up

@DonPringle I am going to try to get to what other countries do.  Many in Europe went from a worse crisis than we have to almost zero ods.  And they tried what the  US is doing. It failed miserably as it is already failing here.
@DonPringle @willfleet That is correct and what the Dr's I watch carefully will say.  Including pain specialists from Stanford, etc.  There is no euphoria.
@DonPringle I think so too.  One thing is for sure, the govt policies are ass backwards and making everything worse.
@willfleet @DonPringle I DO know that there is a diff between addicted and dependent and many who take it on a regular basis are dependent.  And the Dr's are fine with that.  It's when they cross that threshold that the problems start.
@willfleet @DonPringle I don't know.  I've always thought so too but I'd have to look up the studies to cite it accurately and I am sort of burnt out on the topic.  It's draining because so many people tweet in with their legit stories and they are not easy to hear.  I'll get into it one day.

@DonPringle This is 100% correct.  Except this, not all of the addicts started with legal rx's.  Only about 1% become addicted.  The numbers vary on this, depending on the study.  I've read between 1% and 5% but 1% is the last number I read.  https://t.co/n7v7I80jsF

@nancyanne331 Thanks and you do the same!!
@nancyanne331 Mine is great and is a substitute for my Dr. at times.  I adore him.  But the ones on Twitter, SOME of them, ought to be ashamed.  I am out for the day.    I hope. lol.  Nice chatting with you, as always.
@nancyanne331 I saw one who screencapped this woman's tweets and was saying she obs didn't need more meds because of her spelling etc.  I know her. She has some rare disease that causes extreme pain. Bone pain.  She uses voice to tweet. We taught her to tweet to raise awareness. And he mocks.
@nancyanne331 Right?  Some are great but others are on a huge power trip. And the CDC did and some new state laws give them more power.  They do have an obligation to not fill an addict's rx's but they also ought not be mocking ALL pain med patients on social media. And some of them do.
@_justbeachy Yep.  A LOT of fear out there regarding hip replacement and other major surgeries and the lack of pain management happening. And there is some science about people in intense pain not healing well, or as fast, or at all.

@LtningSams @OneFineJay Maybe.  IDK.  I was just curious.
@_justbeachy I think I do.  Let me see if I can find something.  Journalists are just now getting on board with the reporting.  I know for a fact that it happens...  Yes, frightening about what's happening and there ARE people having major surgeries with no post op pain meds now.  It's crazy.

@DanLairdMD Thanks for calling her out, Doc.  It's becoming the norm rather than the exception.  I have a locked list of pharmacists who do the same, all day, every day.  Mocking pain patients, threatening them. Calling them all drug seekers.  I am really not exaggerating either.

To add to this thread today, one tweet only.  I talked yesterday about how I see pharmacists and other professionals mocking pain patients online.  Here's one example. It's a nurse and an MD called her out.  Some ppl need pain meds &amp; empathy, not mocking or whatever this is nxt

I needed to depressurize last night &amp; stumbled upon the weather channel.  Got sucked into the vortex of stories of mother nature at work. I know you will laugh but to a native Californian, a twister is fascinating.  All science fascinates me &amp; extreme weather is well, wow!
@nancyanne331 OH LORD. I wouldn't ever now. As I say, I am blessed in that one of my pain issues is actually getting better, not worse, with age.  I don't need the meds like I did in my 30s.  We shall indeed chat again.
@mom_grateful Yes, that is likely part of it too.  And very true about it being an art which is a perfect illustration as to why there should not be one size fits all anything for any patient.  They need to let the Doctors get back to doctoring.
@nancyanne331 Good night and it's my pleasure.  I have a background in both pharmacy tech and in health insurance. Plus a chronic pain problem that's getting better with age but it was horrid. I can't imagine being in my 30s in this era.  I'd die from the suffering.  Or kill myself.
@nancyanne331 Pharmacies are the worst.  I see pharmacists on here all the time mocking chronic pain patients. They have new power and some of them are abusing it.   The chain pharmacies are terrible.  This too should pass.   Will chat again. I need to log off.
@Beyond_I_Do Yes.  I get propofol for another procedure that I get every three years and I was freaked out too. The anesthesiologist said "well you are not getting it in an IV in your bathroom:"  and I laughed and let them give it to me.  I too was fine. Ketamine still scares me. Never had it
@nancyanne331 Yep.  People don't understand that this is not what is killing people.  It's confusing.
@Beyond_I_Do Okay.  Everyone talks about live PD and I've never seen it.  James is at work tonight. I may try to find it.  I need a new show.  Haha.  Night Meghan!  Have a great evening.
@Beyond_I_Do AND, I too have to have major dental work, They will likely give me the same.  I like it too because it's a clean drug and there's no after effects or drowsiness. I just wake up and am fine. No pain, no suffering, no cravings.
@Beyond_I_Do So when you are watching live PD and they are reviving ppl with Narcan, they are reviving ppl ODing on Carfentanyl or street Fentanyl. Not the RX Fentanyl that your DDS gave you. Hope that explains it. I am out, Meghan. Nice chatting!
@Beyond_I_Do Yes, but it's a completely different drug.  Not just it's illicit usage.  So street Fentanyl is made in China and MX and trafficked here. It is Carfentanyl.  It is not the same as the RX fentanyl. The compound is different.  Different drugs, same name.
@mom_grateful So if you ever do need them again, you should be sure to tell the treating physician about that. Most chronic pain patients don't get euphoric, or high from them. It just kills their pain. Same here. I only got hi off of 1 drug given yrs ago &amp; it was a huge injection. I hated it
@mom_grateful ...differently.  And they don't know why exactly but the prevailing opinion among the pain Docs I talk to is that it's a genetic predisposition to addiction.  If someone in the fam has an alcohol or previous drug problem, it's an indicator.
@mom_grateful Then you do need to be careful.   It is possibly genetic.  I take then prn or as needed and I don't get cravings for them when I am not taking them.  I have them in the house and only use them when absolutely necessary.  Most ppl are like this but a % of the population is wired
@fresh420now @browndotflop @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew I know.  Spread the word.  We're not electing anyone who doesn't order the CDC to rescind their "guidelines."  I need to log off.  It's been nice chatting with y'all.  Have a good night!
Night tweeps.  Be good.
@fresh420now @browndotflop @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew I know what you were laughing at. I was grinning too. lol. üòÇ
@mom_grateful and yes, patient education is key.
@mom_grateful Going back to the 90s, many Dr's erred by not weaning patients off of opioids say, post op . They just cut them off. You cannot do that without the patient going into withdrawal. Hopefully they are now learning that they need to be weaned. Do that and the problems are reduced.
Man, I've read a lot on this topic.  I am also tuckered out on the topic.  Signing off.  Thanks for the chats.
They know it's a problem and that's why they admitted their data is skewed. It's just tough to delineate between opioids with no autopsy so they were just lumping all the deaths together and calling it a day.  It's a mess. https://t.co/EO0Sq757tY
@Beyond_I_Do Prince, Eric Bolling's son, Tom Petty.  ALL of them died from illegal, NOT rx Fentanyl.  This is part of the problem with the CDC reporting and the press.  No one is breaking it down. The illegal Fentanyl is easily synthesized and quite deadly.
Quote tweeting so everyone can see the response. Prince died from illicit/street Fentanyl. This is completely different from RX Fentanyl administered by a Dr. and properly dosed, it's completely safe.  One time anything is not going to get you hooked. https://t.co/Z05I2ECbIy
@fresh420now @browndotflop @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew I am dead serious.  It will work too if enough people do it.
@SeattleSix It's not mentioned I don't think.  That's part of the CDC problem in counting deaths too. They were not breaking it down between legal rx's and illicit fentanyl.  And at this point, it's almost all illicit fentanyl and heroin.  Sorry about your cousins.
@browndotflop @fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew The executive controls the CDC so we need to make it their problem.  It needs to be a MAJOR campaign issue as we head into 2020..  And in that way, Trump will also have to respond.
@browndotflop @fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew I think it's politics that will solve it tbqh.  There are about to be 30 or more dems vying to be POTUS.  Call them all, tell them whoever stops this idiotic war on pain patients gets your vote.. I plan to.  Play them. I won't lie to my Dr. but I will lie to a politician.
@fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew Good. Patients need to know that there are patient bills of rights, pain bills of rights, and it's still a free country.  Be polite but firm. Tell him you suffered for no reason and as you grow older, this concerns you. Ask him "do I need to find another Dr."? etc.  And good luck
@browndotflop @fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew ALL true.  I talk about "chronic pain" patients but the acute pain patients are also suffering needlessly.

@fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew You cannot be arrested for seeing more than one Dr.  It's still allowed.  They would only have a problem if you had multiple controlled rx's from multiple Dr's and you won't get that. There are many entities monitoring every controlled rx to make sure you cannot get them.
@Mel_lific @fresh420now @HonkyTonkJew That is correct. The Dr's are still bound by their Hippocratic oath.  If they are indeed causing you harm by letting you suffer, they are breaking their oath.  Find another Dr.  I certainly would.
@fresh420now @Mel_lific @HonkyTonkJew It's only Dr. shopping if you are seeing more than 1 in an attempt to get multiple rx's.  If a Dr. isn't treating my pain, or forgetting his oath, I am leaving.

@rrothfeldt Okay.  DO take those links and write your reps please.  Threaten their jobs. it's why I am doing this, to give people the tools to send to their reps.
@LynnSchott Absolutely they do.  It's absolutely hell on earth for these people.  Sanctioned torture courtesy of the CDC and various state governments.  I am not exaggerating one whit either.  I am astounded daily by what these ppl are going through.
RT @LynnSchott: @hipEchik Sound bite politics often leads to some of the worst and most harmful public policies.
@rrothfeldt Hang in there. It depends on where you are. There are not a lot of issues in CA for example. We just don't have the problems that say, Ohio does.  I get some pain meds. Not for everyday. I have to sign a contract as if I do get them everyday. But I do get them.
@rrothfeldt At any rate, good luck.  The VA scares me too.  It's why I bought a health sharing ministry policy for James too. I don't want him having surgery with no pain meds.  We will bypass the VA if he gets ill or injured.
@rrothfeldt and, btw, as you say, you can pony up the money.  We're already talking about quasi socialized healthcare where the people with money will find a Dr.  And those without, as in the Oregon Medicaid patients are at the mercy of their lords.
@rrothfeldt Nope.  Private Dr's are not writing them either. In many areas, not at all. They want to but the CDC guidelines, state laws, etc put them at too high of a liability.  It's not ACA related except as you stated.

@_justbeachy Sure, if someone wants to pay me!  :)
I hear this every single day by every single patient who is on pain meds.  NOT criminals, legitimate patients, in unspeakable pain.  Hell, they are granting more rights to criminals than they are to CPP's. https://t.co/RCopr7lnBs
@GuytheGypsy @AandGShow The "Opioid Czar" is @KellyAnnPolls Not a trained M.D. but rather a fairly proficient pollster.  She ought to be able to at least discern that the CDC numbers are a farce since the CDC itself has admitted as much.  Also that rx's are down, and o.ds are up.  This won't help POTUS
I am celebrating Boxing Day in the manner it was intended and am boxing things up to be given away.   My downsizing is going very well.   For a lifelong pack rat to be saying this is extraordinary but it feels good.  Jump in, box it up.  #BoxingDay
@sav01 @POTUS So, if he can be challenged by others, CPAC would be the place to do it.   In front of cameras and an audience.  Anyway, I must run but we will chat again about this, Unfortunately,  It's not going away soon.
@sav01 @POTUS I think you're right. I blocked him. I have zero desire to talk to him. I'm too angry.  I don't think his mind can be changed. I do know someone else , heavily involved in the CPP community who knows him a bit and is trying to get a meeting. She can't.  He doesn't want to hear it
@sav01 @POTUS He is.  I finally had to add it to my thread because I believe he is driving a lot of this. I hear him say all the time that one pill killed his son. It's just not true and not what the autopsy reported. He's at CPAC too which is why I am amping this up. PPL need to challenge him
@sav01 @Mel_lific I'll put you on my CPP list, Sheryl so I see more of your tweets. I know you too are suffering and I am sorry.  Please, if you've not done so already, write your reps, state and federal. Threaten them with their jobs.  That's my best advice for now.

This is also pure truth.  And the hoops they have to jump through are becoming increasingly difficult. They are dealing with unspeakable pain, the CDC, the DEA, the States, the Feds, the Dr's, the insurers &amp; the pharmacists.  And 100% compliant. Still, they suffer. https://t.co/Kbi2BJ1VVa
Nor should you in this case. One of the first linked pieces is how the CDC stats are wrong and that the CDC has admitted as much. https://t.co/NAC1G09kz3
I will continue to advocate for those who cannot do it themselves and those numbers are many.  And, I will continue to help teach pain patients and others how to advocate and affect change in both DC and at the state level.  Thanks for reading. First, do no harm. Fin/
All that said, used responsibly, they are terribly effective pain medications &amp; it is inexcusable for people to be committing suicide in the year 2018 because they are in such pain.  Not due to a drug shortage or lack of money but because the govt knows better than your Dr.
Also, I am not a Dr. and I never want my words to be taken as medical advice. I am opposed to government intervention into this and literally between the patient and Dr. relationship.  As with all meds, the benefits should outweigh the risks.
They are strong meds &amp; do have the possibility of addiction.  However, the risk of addiction from RX meds is fairly low. An estimated less than 5% at the most. This can vary depending on where you get your info.
I want to add one more thing to this thread &amp; it's important.  I am not advocating that anyone take opiates or any meds unless it is necessary.  I know of at least 1 person who thinks I am "pushing" people to take them. I am not.
Crazy.  I know Ohio has a huge problem but again, it's an illicit drug problem. Also though, Portman has been a huge proponent of any and all opioid laws/restrictions etc. He was the original sponsor of the federal law if memory serves. He's misinformed. https://t.co/1Z0lfNNYUi
When the after Christmas sale emails start hitting the in box, I feel like such a sucker.  One year we should all just punk the retailers and celebrate it on the 27th.  Two shopping days.  All things on sale. Imagine the savings.
@karr_pe @dr4liberty Polly, I should add this.  Scott Gottlieb, MD, head of the DEA, sounded alarm bells on this early on. He was ignored. Now the AMA is involved since the AMA President's own end stage cancer patient was labeled a drug seeker by a pharmacist &amp; attempted suicide. Tides may be turning
The nine most terrifying words in the English language are 'I'm  from the government and I'm here to help.' - Reagan.  I am doing my best but ppl need  to take this info &amp; write their state &amp; federal reps. Make it a political issue for 2020. Trust me when I say, ppl are suffering https://t.co/jIbBHeY3y0

@nivratsmom Thank you so much!  I will continue to update it as more information comes to light and time allows.  Agreed on the government intervention.  Reagan's famous adage of the 9 most terrifying words in the English language comes to mind.
@karr_pe @dr4liberty Ahhh. My apologies, I misunderstood. No.  It's President Trump;s CDC, DEA, Opioid task force etc.  And as one of the tweets in the thread explains, I believe him to be getting his info from Eric Bolling, his very good friend. It's the last piece in the thread.
@wamckay70 I read that he had hepatitis C and was wondering about that since it's now fairly curable.  Your information would explain that. If so, he'd probably had it for decades and was very ill and possibly too weak for a transplant.  So tragic.
@karr_pe @dr4liberty It is not a "crowd" but rather a group of chronic pain patients who are estimated to be in the number of 25-40 million in the U.S. It has literally nothing to do with abortion.
@karr_pe @dr4liberty I don't understand your question. I am writing about the U.S. &amp; State government "guidelines' &amp; laws on opioid prescribing that is doing much harm to pain patients. It transcends socioeconomic lines but Medicaid patients in ORE are being force tapered, almost entirely.

can cause them much pain.  I've posed this to them;  don't even think about universal health care.   If you think it is bad now with the government inserting itself into the Dr/patient relationship with meds, how will it be when they are in charge of all of it? I'm done for now.
I'll say this much since I just accidentally discarded a 15 tweet thread &amp; then I must get back to work.  25-40 million chronic pain patients are learning the government processes &amp; quickly. They vote. They are also learning that the government, be it state or federal,

@hyperion5182 But, he's put himself out there as a spokesman so I have to quit thinking in those terms.  He's fair game and I am of the strong opinion that he is influencing the President on this misguided war.
@hyperion5182 Sigh.  I don't know what he hopes to achieve and it's hard for me to talk about him since he did lose a son to an OD.  However, I have to discuss him as he continues to get air time &amp; continues to not be truthful about how he died. It was illegal drugs.
@She_Brings_Joy Please do.  I will keep it in confidence. You have my word and I know you just "met" me but my word is golden.
Wow.  Incredible response to my opioids thread.  I hate that so many of you are suffering from this misguided war.  We will fight this and we will win.  It is legalized torture.  There are an estimated 25 -40 million chronic pain patients.  You can and may swing an election.
@Mel_lific @mshpitsoccermom I am terribly sorry too.   I help admin a group for chronic pain patients and the stories I'm being told are chilling.  It's government induced torture.
@She_Brings_Joy I am terribly sorry to hear this.  I hope there is some information in there that helps you.  Can I ask, was your mom a pain patient being denied or cut back on meds? Only respond if you feel comfortable.  Hugs.
RT @mshpitsoccermom: @hipEchik @Mel_lific That's the same in Ohio. I had a joint replacement surgery and I got vicodin for 1 week, that's i‚Ä¶
@mshpitsoccermom @Mel_lific And Ohio's opioid problem is the same as everywhere else. It's an illegal synthetic opioid problem aka Fentanyl and Heroin.  Some say it always was.  Rx's are way down. O.D.s continue to rise.  The war on opioids as written is already a failure.
@mshpitsoccermom @Mel_lific Yes, Ohio has become a torture chamber.  Florida too. Some NY and NJ Dr's are advocating major surgery with no rx pain meds. Tylenol only.  I'm seeing a ton of people talking about major surgery with only a few pills. Cancer patients are being denied pain relief. It is madness.
@1anobody @foxandfriends This is certainly true.  But the opioid drug lobby has been cut off at the knees.  In fact, the guy who sued big tobacco and won is now suing several opioid drug makers.  The government did this &amp; it was not necessary. It's an illegal drug crisis.
@Mel_lific I certainly will.  Thank you again, very much!
@Mel_lific ..and there is more.  But only so much time in a day.  I sincerely appreciate your support.  We've taught people to tweet in order to hopefully garner more press attention.  I've seen pharmacists and Dr's mocking them.  They've been treated like addicts for years too.
@Mel_lific Oregon is trying to force taper almost ALL opioid pain patients who are on Medicaid off of them with only a few exceptions.  This is being fought strenuously so we shall see. As with all one size fits all govt provisions, the poorest &amp; most vulnerable among us are suffering most.
@Mel_lific There is so much I've yet to cover too but I will get to it.  There are an estimated 25-40 million chronic pain patients. That can and might swing an election.  AZ wrote a law so onerous that Dr's stopped writing ALL pain med rx's within a week. They had to re write the law.
@Mel_lific Yes on the push back &amp; I hope so too.  One size fits all is cruel.  Both Europe &amp; Canada consider the tx of pain to be a human right.  They've gone the other way with opioids &amp; the O.D.s are negligible. In some places zero.
@CoderInCrisis That is exactly correct.  Thanks for the rt.
RT @CoderInCrisis: People that actually need prescription opioids hardest hit. https://t.co/ne17e6tSo3
@1anobody @foxandfriends This has zero to do with either Afghanistan or big Pharma..  It has to do with misguided government "guidelines" being treated as law because Dr's and pharmacists are terrified of the new liabilities these laws impose.

@MarlaMHughes It's frustrating.  I work best with some background noise on and that's the news for me.  Music interrupts my ability to write.  It's fine in a few hours when the Today show starts but in the middle of the night, when I often work, It's either Fox or CNN.  Neither are optimal.

To add to this thread today is another thread.  Something I've avoided tweeting about but it has to be said.  It's the Eric Bolling and President Trump relationship and it is impacting pain patients.   It needs to stop.  https://t.co/8XeCAg693q
By all means, go after the drug dealers of the illicit fentanyl and heroin that is killing so many.  And get the hell out of the patient and Dr. relationship. Fin/  #OpioidCrisis #FentanylCrisis  cc @TheDemocrats
and they are suffering in direct relation to this POTUS's feelings about opiods which again, I believe is stemming from his good friend, Eric Bolling. This must stop.  https://t.co/pIExJeEiZQ
To be clear, only the alprazolam is a legal drug and it's not an opiod.  It's a benzodiazepeme.   Further, the alprazolam (Xanax) that Chase Bolling took was in fact dipped in illegal Fentanyl.  I am not trying to politicize a tragedy but again, pain patients are suffering.
The post-mortem toxicology report, revealed Eric Chase had cocaine, marijuana, alprazolam &amp; thedrugs, fentanyl and cyclopropyl fentanyl, in his system. ‚ÄúHistory of drug abuse and white powdery substance discovered at the scene,‚Äù stated the report. So not just one pill, nor 1 time
In the past month, Bolling spoke at Liberty University &amp; held a townhall, on Sinclair t.v. He is also going to be a speaker at #CPAC.  He continuously states that his son died from "one pill."  He's said this over &amp; over again.  It is simply not true.
Here is one link to source my claims on the tragic o.d. of Eric Chase Bolling. There are others. They all state the same.  https://t.co/pIExJeEiZQ
I believe at least some of POTUS's misunderstandings about opioids stem from his close friendship with Eric Bolling who lost his son due to illicit poly drug overdose. It was not just opiates, nor were they rx opiates as he infers.
.@foxandfriends ought not be making opioid policy.  I am all for going after illicit drugs &amp; dealers. I am never going to shut up about how this rx policy is harming legit pain patients tho https://t.co/9aGzMMjF1T
.@foxandfriends is advising the POTUS to focus on the #OpioidCrisis as a political strategy &amp; stating that everyone is on board.  It is time to delineate between illicit opioids &amp; the legit rx pain meds that Dr's prescribe for pain.
@edtotten22 God bless you as well.

@Gunntwitt Thanks.  It's tough to crate train a Vizsla even as pups though it can be done. We got these 2 at 7 months old. It was far too late by then.  They are called "Velcro Vizslas" because they love to be with the owners as they were with the hunters for a thousand years in Hungary.
RT @Gunntwitt: @hipEchik They can get snagged on the insides of crates, too.  Very dangerous.
@Gunntwitt Yes, they sure can.  Ours don't get crated but that's the other time Scout almost died.  We were trying to crate train him. He was doing *ok* so I left for a half hour. I came home and he'd tried to claw his way out, and tore a nail off. Almost bled out. The vet said to stop.

Randomly chosen piece about the threat of dog collars.  I had been told to take them off of them in cars but not in the home. These dogs are almost never out of our sight and he still got tangled up.  https://t.co/WCd5ILcLF7
I knew this too.  I'd just found out about it though when a friend posted on FB about a horrible dog tragedy involving a collar.  I cannot even repeat it.  Anyway, we are taking them off now but they had just come in for a run.  Have to be ever vigilant.  So thankful that he's ok
Goodness.  People, please take your collars off of your dogs when they are not being used for walking, etc.  We're moving furniture &amp; have a piece of furniture in the hall. Scout went to investigate. His collar got caught on a drawer pull.  He's fine. Me &amp; James are shaken up.

@Dee_NY45 You've now heard from two actual San Diego conservative(ish) in my case, people.  This is a fact.  https://t.co/hRkvp2uvsv
@Dee_NY45 Bahahaha!
@ElMalevo They use Panga boats or Jet skis.  The border patrol usually gets them but once in a while they will find the boat ditched around Coronado.  I think it happened once in 2017 that I read about anyway.
This is exactly right from another conservative living in San Diego. https://t.co/hRkvp2uvsv
@rrothfeldt Hahahaha.  Good idea but I'm actually glad I caught that one.  I live 12 miles from the danged wall and know it's a lie.  But yeah, may be time for some Christmas music.  I'm just trying to not wake up the man and the dogs.
@ConservativeRG @RomainL Indeed.
@Dee_NY45 Praying right there with you. No San Diegan believes this stuff because they know there is already a double or triple fence in place.  So yes, imaginary San Diegans.  I may steal that.
What's sad is the cultists who believe his lies on Christmas or any day.  Merry Christmas to you as well.  You insult me, I shoot back.  Adios. https://t.co/09lyo0hTbC
I will try to find the pics later.  But yeah, he just lied on National TV on Christmas morning.  This is my shocked face.  üò≤
I'm tired of politicians lying about the San Diego border fences &amp; he's not the first one to do so.  He is the worst though and I can prove it. I have toured our double and triple border fencing several times and have the pics to prove it. I last went with a candidate in 2010.
@TxsleuthUSA https://t.co/d5uJ4mdieE
@TxsleuthUSA Again, LIES.  This is how it's going down. "I started the wall but I need that second term to finish it."  And it will work.
@TxsleuthUSA LIES. See my thread.
If anyone breaches the fences, it was generally there, near Imperial Country.  They do jet ski around it and tunnel under it when they can.  And no wall can fix that. #FactCheckingThePOTUS on Christmas day.  What a bizarre time in our history.
People have not been walking over the border &amp; through backyards in San Diego for decades.  The portion that was just finished was near the Imperial county border.  Approximately 15 miles. Other than that, we've had a double and triple border fence here since I've lived here.
He's seriously on t.v. on Christmas morning talking about the flipping wall.  Clueless in the beltway. It's actually kind of sad. Where is Baron?
@hc4cactus I have more to add to the thread but it's a sensitive situation.  Still, I need to add it. It's at the core of what is driving this madness in this policy and others as well.  A personal friend of the POTUS.  I'll post it later.
@hc4cactus YEP! It's pretty crazy. And those once per month tests are not inexpensive. It's not that the Dr's want to do it either, or most do not.  They have been forced to CYA due to the liabilities set forth by the CDC "guidelines," the POTUS' policies and thoughts on the issue &amp; the DEA

THE LONG NATIONAL PHONE CALL NIGHTMARE IS OVER.
@ihatethemedia Yep.  That's what I am just now realizing. They needed a PITA surcharge.  We did tell them we were charging for the call but it should have been at holiday rates. Grrr. Oh well.  It's over now.  Gotta run.  Talk soon.
@ihatethemedia Thank you. He just got off and left to run the dogs.  Merry Christmas to you as well!  And I will dm you after tomorrow.  Appreciate that.  üéÖüéÖüéÖ
@ihatethemedia A Sunday call and then a call on Christmas eve.   I am going to have to work around their holidays.  They can at least respect mine.  We generally don't take calls on Sunday. It's the only day.  Oh well.  It is a big account but I'm thinking we low balled the quote.
@ihatethemedia WELL HELL.  I cannot say anything in the PTL but I'll dm you after Christmas if you don't mind.  Ours in San Diego is down too.  We'll make it up on the buying end but if the interest rates keep rising, we may be screwed until we can re-fi the new place.  Or slightly screwed..
@ihatethemedia They won't pick up the phone. I mean Orthodox Jews. They don't use any technology on holidays or even on Fridays.  No,  I am going to start scheduling his appointments.  I would have said no to today.
@ihatethemedia I think Fremont is okay, isn't it?  I own 1/3rd of a home there also. IDK if I told you that.  And, it should come out of her end.  I didn't know you were divorced either.
@ihatethemedia I just saw this. They are Orthodox Jews. We already know that we cannot call them on their many holidays. I'm just ticked off already.  He was answering questions for the 3rd and 4th time.  Mostly it's because they are a public company full of old men who do not know the internet
AND he is done.  I am taking custody of his phone. I DO want the business but this is ridic.
@US395 He is done. Thank you baby Jesus.
@ihatethemedia INTERESTING. As an aside,   Wells Fargo has suddenly cracked down on all home lending.  I am worried about CA real estate in general in a year that we are about to sell.  In this case though, it appears there are legit liability concerns.
@ihatethemedia I'm still trying to get that to load.  I have a million windows open.  It best not be bad real estate news tho. grr
@US395 This is insane and rude.  They are Orthodox Jews but they know it is Christmas Eve.  There is zero reason it cannot wait until Weds.  He is NOT answering the phone tomorrow. Plus, we answered all their questions in the RFP. I want the business but this is ridic.

This is the client I will tell him to build in a PITA surcharge with.  It's ridiculous.  They are blaming the board and I get that they have a board but all of this could have waited until Weds.
My husband is still on the phone with this potential client.  It's starting to tick me off.  8 hours in total since yesterday.  And it's the first year he's had Christmas Eve "off" since we've been together, in 20 years. We'd better get this business.
When you don't need a lawyer, the place is teeming with them.
@ihatethemedia Serious smack down of Brown.  Did you read it?  7th time since March that they've overruled him and it's not been done in 50 yrs.
@dmataconis Doug, do you know if there is a remedy, or is the court's decision final on this since Brown is out of office in 26 days https://t.co/oxn3xhJkDF
@ThomasGalvin Do you know if there is a remedy or is the court's decision final? https://t.co/oxn3xhJkDF
@rumpfshaker Please see my last tweet on the thread.  Do you know? https://t.co/oxn3xhJkDF
The piece does not say and I do not know, does the State of CA have any remedies or is the Supreme Courts decision final?  Brown is out of power as of 1/20/19.  Paging any lawyer who follows me..
Late Friday, the court rejected clemency requests for three men convicted in fatal shootings: Huan Nguyen, who killed one person in 1994; Joe Hernandez, who killed two people in 1993; and Howard Ford, who killed one person in 1980.
‚ÄúGiven the Supreme Court‚Äôs March order, it‚Äôs reasonable to infer from the denials that the Supreme Court detected an impending abuse of power,‚Äù Ettinger said.
The California Supreme Court rejected one of Gov. Jerry Brown‚Äôs attempted commutations Monday, the seventh time the court has rejected a clemency request from the outgoing governor in recent weeks.
The rejections mark the first time the court has blocked a governor‚Äôs clemency requests in at least half a century, according to the state‚Äôs Judicial Council.

@huangmiller @CatoInstitute @dr4liberty @reason There are two more pieces I need to link. 1) In AZ, their new state laws were so onerous, Dr's stopped writing pain meds scripts entirely due to their liabilities. They had to re-write provisions of the law within a month of it being enacted and 2) In Oregon, they are force -

@huangmiller Thank you, Stephen.  I appreciate the explanation.
@huangmiller Do you see CA or the Feds taking away a tax and replacing it with a carbon tax?  I do not.  Nor is that what has happened in Europe.  It's all been on top of the existing taxes.   And again, a tax has never tempered my activities.  Ever.
@GaltsGirl That's what I am seeing too.  Mostly leftist governments in places we've discussed in the past but yes on the cash and that's what is key.  And our business is portable, no kids.  We're not doing it yet but we may do it.
@huangmiller I understand better where you are coming from but it's just never going to be on my top 10 list of things that keep me up at night.  Basics are and the ability to afford those in CA especially is slipping away from the middle class. I just cancelled health insurance.
@huangmiller I could and will do this willingly.  They don't have to force it on me or tax me to get me to do it.  At least the hybrid car but they want me on public transportation. That, I will not do.  Also that's not cost effective for the poorest among us.  Especially not in CA.
@GaltsGirl My thoughts exactly, why stay?  And I have heard you talking about Chile since I've known you.  It's not out of the question.  I need some freedom and it's being snatched from me. The very things my grandparents escaped in socialist EU are being forced on me here.
@huangmiller Okay. I am with you thus far.  What is it though?  The technology.
@GaltsGirl I will. Thanks darling.  We've actually had thoughts of leaving our beloved USA if things continue as they are so yes, I'll read whatever I can to understand what's going on and if it's expected to continue. It's such an authoritarian state now, it astounds me.
RT @GaltsGirl: @hipEchik You should read a book called "The Fourth Turning"  and then read "A Canticle for Leibowitz"
@huangmiller "but all taxes have the effect of reducing some of the activity being taxed." Not for me.  It just does not. The gas tax for example. I have to pay it. I cannot drive less because I am taxed more. I disagree with your 1st premise.
@GaltsGirl You're probably right on that.  I thought the Obama crew was bad.  This is beyond anything I've ever seen or even dreamed of.
@GaltsGirl But it's only a theory and a generous one at that.  Tariffs are one example.  It's just beyond belief.  And Trump thinks that the more bills he signs into law, the better he's doing. It doesn't matter what bill. Any bill will do.  It signals success to him. More is better.
@GaltsGirl It's astounding isn't it?  When I see Democrats signalling policy that is more conservative than what the GOP is pushing, I too am mortified.  And yes, on the people begging for more.  I have a theory about that too but I may be wrong. I think they are completely new to politics.
@huangmiller So, I wasn't mocking or belittling you.  I just don't understand it.  If someone like you wants to help me understand, i will absolutely listen. Also though, I never hear anyone say, let's eliminate this tax &amp; do a carbon tax. It's not in lieu of, it's in addition to.
@huangmiller I was hoping you would weigh in because you are one of the people I saw tweeting about it.  I didn't pay a ton of attention though.  I oppose any new taxes for starters. I certainly oppose more taxes in CA.  And thirdly, I don't understand how a carbon tax fixes climate change.
@GaltsGirl We're so screwed.  Well, I, for one will revolt and I hope that we will finally meet at that harbor because I know you will be there too.
@GaltsGirl You know, I almost tweeted that. I certainly thought of it.  So we are both seeing the beginnings of his left turn.  Interesting.  And his populist base will support him, of course.
They are good follows for pro Trump people as well, to be clear.  As I say, they call it like it is.
There are others but these two gentlemen truly call it like it is.  Their styles are very different but they've remained "Trump skeptical" while not losing their conservative bent.  And they are both on the youngish side adding to that gen X voice that I think we need more of.
I should never say "Fin" on a thread.  It is just a fact that every time I do, I have something else to add.  I have an extensive #NeverTrump list that you can check out on my page.  As for pundits and writers though, my two favorites are @MattKLewis and @Zigmanfreud .

To be clear, I could be convinced on man made climate change but a carbon tax is not the way to convince me.  I will go to jail before I pay another carbon tax.  Look at Europe.  Even Canada is starting to protest and nothing upsets them. Just say no to carbon taxes.  Fin/
@island_girl421 I think you are exactly right.  At election time, I thought it was just a strategy to elect dems to have a split government and I understood that.  But when they start standing with the leftist agenda, I get suspicious.
@KurMudGin Merry Christmas Max!  Enjoy yourself and especially the darling boy.
I see many talking climate change &amp; that's fine. You can believe in climate change but you can't believe that a U.S. government can solve it with taxes. They can't. I think it's the trendy new thing to do and will continue to think so unless someone can convince me otherwise.
In fact, I've seen a couple of Never Trump conservatives doing the same on the same issue.  A carbon tax in CA is not going to solve anything that India or China is doing and they are the worst offenders.
It is counter productive for Never Trumpers to go to the leftist side. You can be anti-Trump without losing all your conservative principles.  I know this to be true.  Imagine my surprise when I saw Jeff Flake on the Senate floor extolling the virtues of a carbon tax.
@RBPundit LOL.  Is she daft or just trolling? Or both.

@kerwood I can see it from my TeamMarcoCA feed.  What is the tweet again?
Ok. GET THIS.  He had this box sent to our office downtown and then brought it home and left it in the hallway for me to get into trouble with.  Total set up!!  Witch hunt!!  Now whose side are you on? https://t.co/brPtqzYOTn
@mom_grateful I do too!
@US395 HEY!
@1anobody Thank you!  I will.
Goodbye Tweeps. Off to play.
Blocked that nutjob.
LOL. I will buy from whoever I like.  And capitalists don't do boycotts.  Go tell someone else what to do.  I'm going to go place another order because of this tweet.  Bah Humbug. https://t.co/txshlPVjAL
@mom_grateful Did you sponge paint/distress your walls behind that piece?  They look lovely too.
@mom_grateful The only thing I think I'd have done differently is left the center flower in the original wood. I actually like the green.   I need to read about texturing.  I can't think offhand what that is exactly.  I am going to go. Anxious to start now ;-)
@mom_grateful OHhhh. That is a beautiful piece!  Yep, same sort of damage as on my coffee table and only chalk paint is going to cover it. I am going to start simple. Small wooden boxes etc.  Play around with it. I'll let you know how it goes.
@MushKat You're most welcome!  I love that this happened.  Merry Christmas and thank you!  Princess can't wait to get started!
@mom_grateful I was going to sell my old coffee table on FB marketplace next weekend. Then, I went and uncovered it and there is damage on the top that I'd forgotten about.  I am thinking of keeping it and eventually re-doing it as well.  It's a huge piece though. I need tons of practice 1st.
@MushKat Hahahahaha!  I'm just being silly today and it was another night of little sleep so that even furthers the tomfoolery.  ü§£
@mom_grateful I'm going to guess that there is a darker color under a lighter grey(ish) to distress it? If yes, this is exactly the type of look I am going for in some things. I ordered some "distressing" paint though just in case.  I've done this with regular paint but years ago.
@mom_grateful You're killing me.  I do the same thing. I'll check a tweet 3 times, hit send and see it later with an error.  You be in good company.
This is a gorgeous chalk paint restoration of an old piece.  	I hope that my projects turn out this well. Beautiful. https://t.co/5SGnq3OtwL
@mom_grateful WOW.  Amazing restoration.  Stunning!  Did he/she distress it?  I've heard that chalk paint is so easy to work with and very forgiving.  I can't wait to play.
By the way, this is all in jest.  He treats me like a princess and would give me anything in his power.  In marriage, I got the whole fairy tale.  It *is* true that he was initially upset though.  I was surprised that he was because I all but ordered it myself.  Princess out. üëë
Welp.  Since I am already in the dog house, I am going to play with my paint. Vote please and the answer is "It's Fine." 	Thanks and Merry Christmas!
I should have added a forth option.  "He's a monster."
He really is!  And no on the pie. He just eats it all or leaves me a tiny piece and says something like "well I know you are watching your weight even tho you don't have to." blahblahblah.  hahah. He's hilarious but predictable. https://t.co/oAKD7ZZVZw
@drewmatich That's a good one too.  Either that or Sandlot.  There are so many great baseball movies.  Penny Marshall's "A League of Their Own." is up there too.
OH.  I did NOT open the other box that is literally still sitting in the hallway.  It's a wrought iron chaise lounge for the patio.   I'd have opened that too but it needs to be assembled and that's his job.
This is hilarious!  It's an epidemic!  Merry Christmas and happy cooking! https://t.co/bJS5U1ReoP
@mom_grateful No.  I have enough stuff that I plan on practicing until perfect. I've read a ton of blogposts and watched some youtubes though.
I mean, once I opened the first box and saw what was in it, I knew what was in the second box. Hardly worth not opening the second box.  I was already in trouble and I knew it.  Even though it was HIS fault.  100%

Brad is a good man! https://t.co/bucaSDS8zE
@drewmatich Until now.  lol.  It was totally innocent.  I seriously wouldn't have opened it had I checked the address. I'd just have asked him if I could have it early and he'd have caved because he can't say no to me.
Uh oh.  I'm in trouble on this one.  NO LOYALTY people.  I am your twitter friend, not my husband!  Fine.  I'm going to paint with my new Christmas toys. https://t.co/brPtqzYOTn
@prosehaikus LOL! I cannot bear to NOT open gifts before the proper time. I put it in the Amazon basket. I did everything but press "PLACE ORDER."  Lol.  I'm going to play with my stuff now. ;-)
@drewmatich You're a jerk. ;-)
@mom_grateful @mattklewis No because it didn't happen so there is no link to a story. I hear your issue &amp; it's valid but his base is not the majority &amp;  others of us have  issues on our list also yet this is literally all we hear about. I don't ridicule them.  I do think they are obsessed though.
@ChrisLoesch @drewmatich WOW.  I just saw that some geniuses commissioned a study and the findings were that women are harassed &amp; threatened on Twitter. My first thought was that Dana could have proven that without the study. Sorry Chris.
This is what was in the box. OKAY, two boxes.  It's chalk paint and other supplies that I want to use for re-purposing old furniture and for crafts.  It's not a diamond or a new car.  The answer is A) It's Fine. https://t.co/zqjY1JhoUW

@drewmatich PLUS, I want to use the stuff today and tomorrow.  The dogs are boarded and we closed the business for the first time in years.  I want to play with it.  It's chalk paint and other such supplies for me to re-purpose pieces of furniture with.
@drewmatich It was the only box that arrived addressed to him in a month of boxes arriving almost daily.
@drewmatich Him but we've had a TON of boxes arriving. All of my family room furniture and other home items were ordered online plus all the Christmas gifts.  Almost all were addressed to me.  I sincerely thought it was another box for me. Finally, it had been sitting there x 1 full day.
Merry Christmas and Amen. https://t.co/P9Dg6FI2jw
@PhilipTerzian @ruthyoest @weeklystandard Good job.  Both at TWS and at re purposing the office gear.

@ruthtaka @CDCgov I agree completely.  And those countries that did decriminalize it are now seeing a near zero o.d. rate.  Not by letting them just o.d. but with innovative solutions. Canada has legal RX heroin for example. No one is dying.

You cannot wall off the Pacific Ocean.  	I am done on this topic. It's Christmas time. We have a double and triple border fence in San Diego. People are coming in on visas and overstaying them. That is the bulk of the problem.  It's easily googleable data https://t.co/L5SFXKApHe

I have zero desire to debate the damned wall with anyone who wants no more foreigners in the US.  You people are obsessed.  And many of you are woefully uninformed.
I don't know the exact percentage off hand.  It may be as high as 70%. This is how they are entering and this is what should be funded.  Then strategic fencing and high tech solutions. They tunnel under walls, boat &amp; jet ski around them. No more visas for anyone? So no visitors? https://t.co/zYq43VPjRt
It seems that the volcano erupted which caused underwater earthquakes? which caused underwater mudslides, which caused the tsunami.  Or something to that effect. The reports are still sketchy.  OMG the 04 tsunami was on December 26th  too.  Same time of year. https://t.co/8bShln7wMu
GoFund that.  We need a Visa Entry Exit system.  	Trump is going to lose this battle both politically and in the court of public opinion. Everyone who lives near the border knows this to be true. And I live within about 12 miles of this border so save the hate tweets.
Ugh.  And CNN is on about the damn wall and talking about a "secondary border wall near San Diego."  There is a double and triple border wall (or fencing) in place in San Diego.  HOW many walls does he want?  More than half enter on a legal visa and then overstay them.
I was on a news moratorium but had to turn CNN on for this.  So reminiscent of the 2004 tsunami in Sumatra.
@___Justyce___ @1776Stonewall Thank you.  Merry Christmas to you, as well!  ;-)
Trying to get a fix on what caused the Indonesian tsunami and the reports vary.   Best I can tell it may have been an underwater volcanic eruption.  That's how islands are made, btw.  Regardless, an epic tragedy.  Happens too often over there.
@jakehicks1206 ME TOO and this should be that time.  Someone has to be the one that says "enough."
@___Justyce___ @1776Stonewall I don't care.  It's Christmas and I have other things to do than worry about the damn wall.  IF there is to be one, we pay plenty of taxes for it to be built though.  The GoFundMe is ridiculous. It's a massive failure of a massive government that they could not get this done.
OH Lord.  Another tsunami in  Indonesia.  This is not good.	Prayers up for the victims.
I found my Christmas presents and opened the Amazon box and I am not sorry.  I am going to use it today too.  My husband was not amused but he left the box in the hallway.  Plus, I had put it in the Amazon wish list.  Twas hardly a surprise. Twitter verdict?
@DonPringle Did you see Kelly Slater surfing that big wave the other day?  Where was that, Hawai'i?  I am trying to find video of it.
Whatever you "did" that angered the Twitter mom, do not apologize, Chris Rock.  That is why this shit keeps happening.  Stop apologizing.  Someone is always going to be offended.
I go to look for why Chris Rock is trending and I see this tweet.  2012 people.  Really?  Carmine is right. Get a life.  I still don't know what he "did" and I don't really care. https://t.co/gesFVsjkkE
@DonPringle I was going to say, they find people to do their wedding and shower invites.  Although some of those have made me cringe too. We sound old. Lol.
@DonPringle Yeah but I mean I was right in the middle of it. My town is now considered the silicon valley.  James had a Commodore 64. My first home p.c. was one my dad had built but never used.  I did all my college work on that beast and then it died.
@DonPringle Then I am an artist because I always send them.  They could type them using a keyboard.  They know how to write to invite to their weddings. lol.

@ihatethemedia Thank you.
@ihatethemedia Anyway, I'm supposed to be off politics and on Christmas so off to do that.  If we don't chat, have a happy Christmas!!
@ihatethemedia If that's the worst he does, I can live with it. It's already almost illegal to have 1 outside of the home anyway. I am hoping for the best. I've filled out 3 surveys for him. I got on his list of people who wanted input into the agenda.  Maybe naively, I am hoping for moderation
@prosehaikus It's bizarre though.  And so is that how their kids are going to be?  It's not a political thing either. It is a generational thing.  Common sense dictates, at least send a flipping text.  Oh well.  I got it from reading books. That's how I knew I was supposed to do it.
@ihatethemedia Nor I.  Although, all the things I am reading are signalling that the major damage may come in the 2nd term.  I think Jerry talked to him.  He's telling the legislature they need to scale back their wish list.  He's worried about a recession.  SO, we shall see.
@ihatethemedia I never had any doubt.  You are gonna have to get used to saying Newsom though, as are we all. And I still contend that he will make Moonbeam look like Reagan.

@erik0015 You're very kind.  Thank you so much.  No, I still love these kids a ton.  It's just rude and I don't know if it's a generational thing, or what.   Regardless, I'll get over it. I always do.  Merry Christmas to you as well!
@erik0015 Maybe I ought not be upset about this but I really am.  The gifts are bought with care.  They are always expensive and I have to email and ask if they were received.  I get zero response.  It's beyond rude.
@erik0015 ..and loling because it is the Democrat who sent the Christmas card.  She moved out of CA this past year. It's possible that the midwest is rubbing off on her. Or maybe it's her new baby. IDK.  Miracles happen.
@erik0015 Really?  I will have to test that theory out. I will say this. One of them did send me a Christmas card.  Only one though.  And I have 5 millennial nieces and nephews.
@prosehaikus and I never did get the picture.  They are just entitled brats. Even still in their 20s and early 30s.  I love them but this is just something I cannot grasp. I had them at my house every summer when they were growing up so we were always very close. Grrr
@prosehaikus I bought my great nephew this awesome aloha shirt in Maui last year. I sent it and asked his mom to please send me a picture of him in the shirt. She sent me an email telling me how she &amp; my nephew decided that the 2 yr old would not open it early which I never asked them to do.
@prosehaikus MY mother did not teach me to write thank you cards. I just did it.  I still do it.  I think I am done buying these "kids" gifts though.  If they cannot even text a "thanks" it's just unacceptable.  I have to ask if they received it too as they are usually mailed.
@prosehaikus I guess I blame their mothers too.  Actually, one, my husband's niece, puts a post up on Facebook.  The rest are just never heard from. One got a ton of things for a new baby.  My favorite niece got wedding gifts plus we traveled 600 miles to her wedding. Nothing. Not a word.
To whoever asked, no, they are not all Democrats. Only one is and she is the only one who messaged me a thank you picture of her kid in an outfit I bought him. Not everything is political. https://t.co/odfKgIlWNh

I try not to slam millennialls too much but in the past year, I've bought 18 gifts for millennials.  I've received zero thank you cards,  and in most cases, not even a thank you.  Not a text, FB post, nada.  I may re-think my wish list.  This is unacceptable.
Enough of this tomfoolery.  I am off to wrap Christmas gifts while my man and dogs sleep.

@MarlaMHughes Political twitter is getting more dysfunctional.  Also, sent you a dm.
@JaneBond462 @Killmaven On a political level, it's not going to be good for POTUS.  Just be ready for that.  It's not wishcasting, it's just a fact.  It's always been thus. The party in power *is* blamed.  But yeah, the government is too damn big.
I actually didn't even write this as I tweeted originally.  Adding it here so no one claims I stole it.  I have a brilliant friend who refuses to let us credit him.
..and if that is not correct, I'm sure one of you will correct me.  	It's a dry humor.
My snarkasm doesn't translate well on Twitter, apparently.  I know these are the "essential" parts of government.  https://t.co/2ofyLy1vre  Or so they claim.
@TalkGOPpod @HonkyTonkJew Oh, I am with you.   I know that these are the "essential" parts.  It was pretty much pure snark on my part.
@TalkGOPpod @HonkyTonkJew I'm afraid I don't understand what you just wrote.  It it only 4:15 a.m. here so it's quite possibly me.  I think you're saying if they are non essential, we don't need them?

I don't think it will help the POTUS politically but that's not my problem. Here's a piece on what to expect.  I do hope no one suffers due to this partial shutdown.  It is generally a sign of dysfunction. https://t.co/vK3An6YFYC
@dmataconis So far, I am unaffected and alive.  I do think it will have political repercussions but whatever.  That's his problem.
That was from a friend who asks not to be credited...
If the federal govt is shut down, who‚Äôs going to seize a third of my household income,distort nearly every market my family depends upon,compel my participation in inescapable ruinous schemes, &amp; generally constitute the single greatest threat to my individual rights &amp; liberties?
I think about that era and cannot imagine having to deal with growing up and recording it for the world to see.  Social media would have put undue stress on me in the 80s.  Looking back on what #The80sTaughtMe

@DonPringle I find it fascinating that I grew up in the midst of all that. I remember girl friends going to work "in Sunnyvale" but at the time, I didn't "Really" know what they were doing over there.
#The80sTaughtMe  The first rule about what the 80s taught me is to never tweet about what the 80s taught me.
@MarlaMHughes I guess I should have known that or maybe I did and just put it aside.   I can be libertarianish too.  Of course, I was also called a warmonger a half dozen times yesterday.
@Lure132 Thanks.  I read it yesterday.  Top notch dude.
@mikeschiffer Thank you again!

@mikeschiffer I can't get through the wiki piece because of sleep deprivation.  I'll read it when I'm more coherent.  I did get this far though and thus, I'm going to let you own it if it comes to pass. https://t.co/j5cuJMU4wd
@mikeschiffer Dammit.  I'm going to have to read the story. ;-) I am not opposed to a revived LP though so I think I must own some of the blame. Or credit.
@KimGOP60 50.  Five Oh.  Get busy, chica.
@mikeschiffer Interesting.   In this case, is it interfering with fate though? It is happening spontaneously, though the folks who are doing it likely have no clue they are facilitating it.   And further, this is just me musing in the middle of a sleepless night. üòâ
