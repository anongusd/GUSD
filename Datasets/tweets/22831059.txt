Now Ways n Means controls the debate. Then Labor. Then Budget. Votes at 9 or 10.
Procedural motions have passed. Now we debate the bill. Energy n Commerce Cmte controls the debate first.
High drama. Stupak doing news conf. Right now. Obama will agree to admin order on abortion. Stupak group capitulates.

Just after 11 p.m., Paul Ryan summary woke everyone up. All are laughing, smiling, and leaving.
11 p.m. -- Many squinty eyes and much yawning now. There is one more motion from the Dems.
Wow -- Mr. Latta named a few of the new gov't agencies under the health bill -- what a tangled web we weave
10:45 p.m. -- We're on Repub motion #10 on federal gov't expansion. Still a good debate, aided by shark bites (they're like gummi bears).
10:30 p.m. -- Finally, a unanimous voice vote -- supporting coverage for pregnant or battered women
It's 9:45 p.m. now. I'm getting restless -- I got up at 4 a.m. this morning to catch a plane from Wyo to Washington
Mr. Scott says we are going to take a vote on health care. Last week they talked of "deeming" it passed.
Mr. Hensarling: let's be honest about the magnitude of the tax increases this bill will bring about
Mr: Hensarling: Americans want jobs more than unpaid-for Pell grants.
Mr. Jordan: No American believes we can give more gov't money away and not increase deficits or debt
Now we're debating Pell (college) grants in the middle of a 2,000+ page health care budget reconciliation bill. I repeat, Holy Cow.
It's 9 pm, in 3 more hours they pull the plug on this bill for tonight
We just debated the gov't takeover of the student loan program (yes, its in the health care bill!)
Mr. Ryan: rationing is the only way to bend the cost curve down under govt run health care
Mr. Garrett: Dem's approach is "buy it or else"
@SusanAnneHiller http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVoYHGERENk
But Medicare is going broke, so the Dems want to take a half trillion from it and not fix it? That's irresponsible.
Repubs agree -- doing nothing is not an option and we need reasonable reforms.
Debate over the Stupak (abortion) amend. was respectful, but it failed by two votes

Dems defeat my motion on keeping the gov’t out of your health care choices by a party line vote of 15-20.

We know we are giving the next generation a lower standard of living. Holy Cow! Yet we spend... and spend...
Medicare and medicaid are going to eventually consume the entire budget. This bill cuts medicare AND creates new entitlements.

My turn to speak is coming up. You can watch by going to http://cspan.org
The sham bill having passed 21-16, now long night begins: "instructions to House Rules Committee."
Rep. Ryan: it didn't have to be this way; this process is not worthy of your support or your vote
Rep. Ryan says we r here because Scott Brown was elected in MA
Rep. Ryan summed it up: real reform is needed but this is a sham
First motion offered by Rep. Mack, to protect the doctor-patient relationship from federal bureaucrat interference.
Now we move on motions to change the substance of the bill
I just voted against reporting the bill from the budget committee to rules committee, it passed 21-16

WY is getting its first whiskey distillery
Rep. Yarmuth: last in, first out accounting benefits bourbon and wine industry, was not aware but need to learn
Orszag: 1) product demand 2) access to capital 3) good workers... All more important than lower taxes
My statement to the Budget Committee on Obama's budget proposal: http://ow.ly/13a4U
My thought: 2.15 million federal employees, let's reduce vacated positions by attrition, just like we did in Wyoming when times were tough!
Fun fight - definitely. But productive? We'll see.
Paul Ryan loves the give and take. So does Orszag.
Mr. Edwards: back to blaming Bush. Also hating on Paul Ryan's proposal.
Rep. Diaz-Balart: families get together and solve their budget problems, why can't we? Good question.
Orszag: the hole is so deep, we must do it together, we have not done enough
Rep Austria: focus should be on jobs
Rep. Harper: Congress should cuts its budget just like families have had to do (Amen!)
My turn to question Orszag is coming up in a few moments.
Rep. Campbell: where is the President's roadmap to a sustainable budget? Good question.
Orszag wants Congress's help to make a fiscal commission work
Orszag agrees: We are on an unsustainable course
Orszag agrees: Deficits above 3 percent of GDP, which is in the Obama budget, are not sustainable
Orszag agrees: ...Bush budgets unsustainable, but NEITHER is this Obama budget
@BenInNy You should be able to watch the budget hearing here: http://bit.ly/cS0m07
Rep. Simpson: American people don't care who is to blame, just quit spending money!
Orszag admits deficit is higher under this Administration
Wall Street Journal: this is a modern spending landmark
Republicans: there are historic levels of debt in 2011 budget
Dems misrepresenting paul ryan's ideas.
Finally we are talking about the 800 lbs. gorilla: entitlements
Ryan to Orszag - medicare costs unsustainable... Orszag agrees
More ideas from Rep. Ryan -  health care tax benefit attached to individuals, not employers
Paul Ryan ideas - no change for people over 55, safety net for the needy, slow benefit increase for wealthy...
Committee starts a medicare-soc security discussion
Orszag supports a deficit "commission." He supports lowering health costs (but neither house nor senate dem health bill meets this goal!)
Orszag's other goals - 1.2 trillion deficit reduction using a new bank tax, let tax relief expire and new tax on fossil fuels
Orszag's goal - don't make situation worse
We have a dire fiscal situation, Orszag starts testimony, admits weak job market
161 billion to 1.6 trillion deficit increase after D's pass pay-as-you-go law.
Freeze only after 84 percent spending increase? Americans won't buy it.

I just asked the panel if this bill amounts to a huge cost increase for American farmers and ranchers. All six panelists agree it is.
EPA as the ag regulator under Waxman Markey rather than USDA scares ag producers and their Congressmen of both parties.
Six ag industry witnesses are testifying now. Most oppose cap & tax bill. Others want a bill but not this bill.
New federal bureaucracy under Waxman/Markey cap & trade = $800 million per year over first 10 years.
USDA Secretary agrees that cap & trade creates a problem for coal using rural electric coops.

Cong. Budget Office confirms cap & trade bill includes massive new taxes & spending. $846 billion in new taxes.

@cmmjaime Dr. Bernanke mentioned the need for stronger oversight of larger firms. I was relaying his comments on.
My Q & A with Dr. Bernanke during today's Budget hearing. http://bit.ly/QsSua
Net purchasing power diminished under cap and tax.
"Proof is in the pudding" re: whether Congress and President will restore fiscal discipline.
Administration needs to cut spending to meet tax revenues.
Debt is THE looming issue, it is critical that we resolve it.
Lessons learned: need stronger oversight of large firms.
Regulators should use balance re: bank risk and safety vs. lending to worthy borrowers.
Credit spreads are down, but small business and consumers rely on banks.
We cannot borrow indefinitely. Must bring the budget into balance, or interest rates will rise.
We should not tax banks now.
Draconian cuts and high taxes will happen if we do not plan now.
Dr. Bernanke says a continued increase in debt and interest creates a vicious circle.
At Budget hearing listening to Fed Chairman Bernanke talk about the challenges facing the economy.
@imninnkeeper It’s a scary reality that at the rate we are spending, the Fed may have to finance our debt with new printing.
When sentiment turns against US treasuries is anyone's guess.
US debt "grim outlook." US debt may not be safest haven long-term.
Paul Ryan: Are we the next Britain? Downgraded credit and trouble selling our bonds?
Higher interest rates likely down the road
Large deficits in 'out-years' is 'worrisome'
$1 trillion in lost output will get worse
CBO Director: stimulus starting to work, manufacturers inventories lean
Budget - record spending doubles debt in five years, nearly triples in ten years
Fed - printing money to buy US debt
TARP - Gone from stabilization to buying companies.
Today's budget committee hearing: Economy - Where are we?

@Ellsbeth Thanks for background on how critically important our natural resources are to the future of our state!
Rep. Bishop of Utah asked why Wyoming teachers receive higher pay than Montana, which has more wilderness. Joel hit that one out of the park
Joel Bousman was great. Spoke of our resource management and recreation use. The bill thwarts public input. Thanks Joel!!!
Pastor Stewart now testifying. He's in the 'sanctuary' business, and supports the bill. i'm glad he chose to be a 'shepherd of men.'
Judy Boyle, Idaho House, now testifying in opposition. Wild fire conflagrations cause carbon emissions.
Carol King is now testifying. Always loved her songs and voice - still do. But I'm glad she chose a singing career.
Forest Service: Full range of options is needed to manage the full range of species.
7 of 25 areas have had forest plans completed. This bill changes the process.
@doreenschaar It was great seeing you today!
Rep Rehburg says this is rural vs urban - I sadly agree
Cosponsor of NREPA says we should respect local citizens. This bill does not.
The sponsor would save trees in Central Park from insects and fire, but not Wyoming's.
NREPA's sponsor has never been to the areas covered by the bill. She has 75 cosponsors.

Mr. Latta wins the "great line of the day" award re: death tax. "Time to get the gov'ts cold hands out of warm graves."
R's vote to repeal the death tax. D's want to tax the death of family business owners. Farewell to farms.
I just sponsored an amendment to save 30,000 student lending jobs. Democrats voted no.
Republicans try to remove Democrat budget gimmicks designed to limit debate.  No luck.
Here is a video of the introduction of my amendment to prevent the cap and tax policy. http://bitly.com/1030CT
Nat'l Endowment for the Arts vs. Veterans. NEA wins, veterans lose. Sad.
D's say no to american energy and american jobs, yes to foreign energy and foreign jobs. D's say no to a new Clean Energy Trust Fund--wow.
About to offer my amendment to the budget to prevent the enactment of a cap and tax policy
We can use revenue from non-renewable energy sources to develop renewable energy and support other things like highway infrastructure
Now R's want to protect doctor and patient-directed health care, D's want the government to dictate health care.
Now R's are trying to cut half a trillion dollars in tax increases from the budget.  D's say they want the tax increases.
R's are trying to increase military pay and take the money to do so from Hamas' Gaza money.  D's say no.
Committee recessed for third round of house floor votes.  1st Amendment to reduce budget failed - party line vote
Here is a video of my speech to the Budget Cmte. http://bitly.com/M8zV
Rep. Paul Ryan did a brilliant job of expressing the difference between R's and D's and the greatness of America... If we can keep it.
Republicans are wrapping up their opening speeches.  Key points: this budget taxes too much, spends too much, and borrows too much.
My turn to talk.
There's a brief break in the action on the budget debate. Have to go vote. Things should start up again shortly.
Connolly (D) - says republicans have no shame - blames bush for AIG (Didn't dems trillion dollar stimulus bill authorize the AIG bonuses?)
Scott (D) - says bush taxed too little and spent too much. Does that mean we should get to tax too much and spend too much?
Budget debate begins.  Passionately held philosophies. Chairman Spratt blames Bush. Rep. Ryan says budget is gimmicks to hide tax and spend.
