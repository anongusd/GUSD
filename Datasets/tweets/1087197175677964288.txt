@realDonaldTrump Kurds are our guarantee to prevent ISIS and evil jihadist Erdogan from attacking homeland and the rest of the free world. POTUS time to change the game, Turkey is the real danger, Kurds are the real allies and US must support them.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for supporting our Kurdish allies! A wise and brace decision that will ensure evil jihadist Erdogan will not repeat the history as dream of commuting the massacres his ancestors did in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Trump stay strong.
