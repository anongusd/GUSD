@gfigg42 @TheStevenWeber Are you 1000% certain you know which one history will later prove out to be true? I sure don‚Äôt. 		It‚Äôs been a long ass time since we had an epic global battle. Humanity was most certainly not mentally equipped for social media. 		Do you really want to take the chance?
@gfigg42 @TheStevenWeber You might be right. I can see a reality where this is a terrible messaging problem that political operatives are spinning to their advantage. 	I can also see a reality where the inflamed rhetoric is being injected as active measures to get Americans to kill America from within.
@gfigg42 @TheStevenWeber Today Trump complained about hiring 5 or 6 thousand judges. He doesn‚Äôt want to. Can‚Äôt understand what kind of country would do such a thing. 		Tell me, how can these people have due process with a judge shortage, and Trump‚Äôs attitude?		https://t.co/CvgtvA75ux
