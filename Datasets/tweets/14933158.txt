Quincy calls Hodges a “terrific friend and a great person.” Morillo says her legacy is “seriousness about budgets” and “changing forever the way we talk about” equity in Minneapolis.
Long ovation for Hodges. I believe this is her first council chambers appearance since Nov 7. Quincy and Javier Morillo to speak.
Bender, in words she clearly felt deeply, praised Hodges for being true to her principles despite all the “opinions people have about women leaders.” Also thanked her for her kindness.
Rondo is funny. Says getting called to Yang’s office was like principal’s office cuz he was chair of public safety. “Only thing worse than getting called to principal’s office is when he principal says ‘I’m calling your mom’” — points at Hodges.
Frey lauding Blong Yang’s bluntness. Says new CMs had a lawn sign exchange 4 years ago, But Frey didn’t have one for Yang, and felt bad. Yang: “Jacob honestly I don’t care about your lawn sign.”

B. Johnson also appreciates Greater MSP’s work. Bender wants to know more about need for lead inspectors. Cano’s with A. Johnson on Greater MSP.
Goodman says Greater MSP has made their case. “I believe they have followed through.” Workforce dev, coordinating bids for big projects like Amazon.
After procedural discussion, Frey withdraws the amendment. Back to A. Johnson’s proposal. He’s a Greater MSP skeptic. Said org has yet to reach out and “explain to us he value of the money we’re providing”
Glidden feels v strongly that the attorney’s office needs the money to review cases more thoroughly before they charge — “The most important criminal justice work the city is doing.”
Frey’s going to bat for Greater MSP on matter of where to get $100k for a new lead inspector. Johnson wants to take from Greater MSP. Frey wants to take from city attorney’s office instead.
Community liaison total is half what Hodges proposed, now moving to the last-second amendments portion of the meeting.
Glidden moves $90k (mostly) from city coordinator to civil rights for labor enforcement. That’s $40k ongoing to fully find another FTE. And $50k one-time for education, outreach.
Theme here is that Hodges' public safety proposals are being chipped away and reworked. The nighttime mobility program is gone. The # of community liaisons has been cut in half, and could drop further.
shoutout to whichever persnickety person named the program "Neighborhood &amp; Community Relations for Collaborative Safety Strategies"
Cano strides over behind the dais and is now reading Frey and Goodman the riot act over something. Not sure what.
Cam Gordon says he's disappointed that the PD won't get the full 8 community liaisons he asked for.
That will mean 4 fewer PD community liaisons than were in Hodges' budget, fewer of the "nighttime mobility" officers aimed at directing traffic downtown.
Big public safety amendment from Frey and Bender, mostly aimed at finding matching funds for the federal grant-funded addition of 10 new sworn officers for MPD.

@Ancef_FC @TotalSoccerShow @WMckennie I like that.
@ryanlindberg It only invalidates the vote for Park Board, but most people want their vote to count in that race, so they ask for a second ballot.
Park Board candidates, not to worry! Everyone who screws up their ballot gets a second chance. But it's causing precincts to run low.
They have the option of getting a second ballot so their votes for Park Board will count. And most people are doing that.
The problem, he said, is that too many people are putting all their selections for the Park Board in one column, which spoils the ballot.
Carl also said that between 20 and 30 precincts are running low on ballots, election workers are scrambling to get extra ballots to the polls.
Sounds like we could be pushing 100,000 voters by the time the polls close, which would be a huge change compared to four years ago.
City Clerk Casey Carl told me turnout was over 91,000 as of 30 minutes ago. That's more than 40% turnout. "Feels like a mid-term congressional election," he said. #MplsVotes #mpls2017 https://t.co/rBfpMoEjCB
@aaronlwells based on the 70k by 5pm be very surprised if it's not up overall by at least 5%. Hearing 4, 6 (of course), 9 and 11 are up.

@aaronlwells shame you didn't introduce yourself the other day
If turnout is up ~10%, good for incumbents, bad for challengers. If we get near a 20% increase (~95,000 voters), then we could be looking at big changes on the City Council.

Means very little except that it challenges the idea that Hoch/Frey voters and Hodges/Dehn/Levy-Pounds voters are 2 distinct groups.
1/2/3 choices were Dehn/Frey/Levy-Pounds, Hoch/Frey/Dehn, Frey/Dehn/Hodges, Levy-Pounds/Dehn/Hodges and Dehn/Frey/Hodges.

Frey raised $131,815 between Aug. 1 and Oct. 26, bringing his total for the year to $491,694. He has $80,754 on hand.
Dehn raised $51,852 between Aug. 1 and Oct. 26, bringing his total for the year to $106,569. He has $6,283 on hand.
Hodges raised $137,815 between Aug. 1 and Oct. 26, bringing her total for the year to $395,952. She has $61,915 on hand.
Has your #mplsmayor candidate provided the campaign finance report, due today, to the local paper?	Dehn✔️	Frey❔	Hoch❔	Hodges✔️	Levy-Pounds❔

A lot of you already know this, I realize.
It's likely we won't know who won the mayor's race in Minneapolis on election night, says City Clerk. Probably know by Wednesday afternoon.
RT @RonHarrisMN: Hey @adambelz, figured you'd appreciate my pink socks featuring panda bears wearing double gold chains. #SockGameOnPoint #…
Not sure if this reflects caution or simply a lack of ideas. Probably both to some extent.
OK, that's it. Once again, a striking absence of concrete proposals across the board.
Frey: look for progress on affordable housing
Dehn: look for progress on racial equity
Levy-Pounds: look for responsiveness to people’s needs, and a new foundation for police reform
Hodges: look for progress in "transforming our DNA"
Hoch: look for a marked change in culture of PD, vision for economic vitality, meaningful progress on affordable housing
Question 7: In four years if you’re mayor, what should people look at to decide if you were a good mayor?
so for those keeping score...	Frey: Johnson out	Hoch: no comment	Hodges: no comment	Levy-Pounds: Johnson out	Dehn: no comment
Dehn: not the mayor's role to select council leadership.
Levy-Pounds: Johnson's family has been in power for 40 years. "A lot of concern" in community about that. Wants new council leadership.
Hodges: that's the council's job to decide, my job will be to work with person chosen
Hoch: that's the city council's decision, will work with whoever is council prez
Frey: respect her, city council needs new leadership
Question 6: Will you support Barb Johnson for council prez if she wins?🚨🚨🚨
Levy-Pounds: We need to have an actual equity plan. Points to Seattle, where they measure outcomes in housing, economics, policing, etc.
Hodges: Already has Cradle-to-K, making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses, has jobs programs to help young people of color
Hoch: I’d start with the city’s contract process to help businesses owned by people of color.
Frey goes abstract. We need more affordable housing in every neighborhood. People push back sometimes.
Dehn goes abstract. Will listen to communities of color, change the way people of color are policed, push for more economic development.
Question 5: Please offer one policy or budget item that will help communities of color.
Hodges: yes I am doing a good job -- clean energy partnership, zero waste plan, building benchmarking, Mpls 1 of 100 resilient cities
Hoch: City's doing a good job on climate change. Commends Hodges. Wants more incentives for energy efficiency improvements.
Question 4: climate change? Answers so far about localized pollution. Levy-Pounds/Frey like solar gardens. Dehn likes lead testing.
Yes, mayor has no formal authority, but we're 8 days out from election. Every candidate agrees it's important. Nobody has articulated a plan
Interesting that other than Dehn's "full service public schools," not one concrete proposal for what the mayor can do about K-12 education.
Hoch: “kids in city are constituents of the mayor,” strong school system is essential, wants to bring arts community into schools
Frey: says education is important, he pushed to reopen Webster Elementary, and thinks school segregation is a problem.
Dehn: calls for “full service public schools,” with city and county services available to parents, since those things impact kids’ lives
Levy-Pounds: next mayor must focus on education use bully pulpit, or “we might as well pack it up and go home” -- says MPS “in crisis”
Hodges: says mayor can do little, but mentions "Cradle-to-K" and "Talking is Teaching" initiatives, calls for better workforce development
Question 3: What can the mayor do to promote better education in the city?
Nobody offered a second choice vote, when asked, though Hodges did say she appreciates Dehn and Levy-Pounds.
Frey: ‘We need a police department,” but calls for “rebuttable presumption of misconduct" if cops don't turn on body cameras.
Dehn: To fight crime, we need to meet people's needs. No PD is "aspirational," but "crime is a product of circumstances," not morality
Levy-Pounds: calls it "the wrong question," says mayor and MPD knew body cameras weren't being used before Damond shooting, failed to act
Hodges: says, basically, we're always going to need police. But city has launched several initiatives to increase police-community trust.
Hoch: Doesn’t envision that as a possibility, but wants 90% of people in every neighborhood to say they feel safe.
Question 2, can we ever have a city without police?
Dehn: Talks about “protecting renters, penalizing predatory landlords, I’m the only one who’s talked about rent stabilization”
Levy-Pounds: Decries "developer driven model," says city needs to "work with n'hood associations" says the poor need a voice at City Hall.
Hodges: "It’s much less expensive to preserve affordable housing than to build it new,” and city has invested in that.
Hoch: We have to look at inclusionary zoning, doesn't think enough of the units built in Frey's ward are affordable.
Frey: "We do need to increase our housing supply right now and that is through density" -- mentions funding aff housing w/other govts
First question is from a caller, about affordable housing: How will candidates make housing available to people of all income levels?

@webster that happens on every story about Hodges or the City Council
@webster @RootHoward don't want to be unfairly incendiary. So we've revised a little. Obv won't please everyone but it's gentler now which seems appropriate.
@webster if you and @RootHoward both say the judge's filing is automatic, it probably basically is. That's important and I should have understood it.
@webster Just to be clear, I can file a writ -- no matter how specious -- and a judge must order defendant to either comply or come to a hearing?
@webster Is this for sure true? It is an important point.
@javimorillo @StarTribune Judge could've dismissed Becker's complaint, and she didn't. But I will be happy to report a Hodges team victory at hearing if it's so.
@javimorillo @StarTribune You know I don't always think I'm right about everything.

54 recommendations on anything is just lazy.
Here's Harteau's contract, from 2012, which I'm told has not been amended: https://t.co/TOVQwBv22V
Palmisano, in closing, says 60 mins not enough, invites people to Aug. 9 hearing on Arradondo, see "what we can get" from a new chief.
Man asks about the "blue code." Jafaar says no, doesn't work that way, bc civilians have eyes on every case.
Woman wants a separate internal affairs office within PD. Jafaar makes robust case for civilian/PD hybrid. "They're chained to us."
Palmisano says Stanek passed a bill that would make it discriminatory to exclude officers by zip code. Woman says, "take the state on!"
Older woman says she recommends police be part of the community, live here. Calls 5th precinct a "glass fortress" that's "alienating."
Palmisano says the paramilitary response from cops has to do with the response to 9/11. Also questions whether former military shld be cops.
Patrick starts to answer, guy stands, says why aren't cops here? Palmisano says she didn't invite police bc a lot of ppl don't want them.
Another question: Why is there a culture of fear among police that causes them to respond to residents with violence?
Palmisano says she can't answer that question. She has the same question herself.
Shouldn't he have been an example of how effective the city's new training regime is?
...but the cop who shot Justine was a new cop. Shouldn't he have been the type of cop who wouldn't do this?

Wade stands firm, explains arbitration, says "everyone is innocent until proven guilty," including police officers.
Guy asks how powerful the union is. Jeffrey Wade says not more powerful than any other union. "Bullshit!" somebody shouts.
Jafaar, director of OPCR, doesn't know the numbers off the top of her head. Said they're on the website.
Imani Jafaar says those numbers aren't accurate. Guy says they come from a data practices request. Lady shouts "what are your numbers?"
Man says civilian oversight is worthless if Office of Police Conduct Review has processed ~1,600 complaints and only disciplined 6 officers.
Palmisano says that was the mayor and chief's decision.
Now each group is getting to ask its question. First is why weren't PCOC's recommendations adopted.

So basically the outlier in every way is Dehn.
So far:	Kieran McCarney (Hoch): $36k	Joe Radinovich (Frey): $33k	Jorge Contreras (Hodges thru May): $24k	Joelle Stangler (Dehn): $9k
Campaign managers are a big cost, which makes me think I should have covered their hiring more thoroughly back in January.
For Hodges, the figure is $172k, or 71% of all the money she spent. For Frey, it’s $108k, plus $46k in consulting, as with Hoch about half.
Tom Hoch spent $143,654 on campaign salaries, payroll taxes and workers comp, plus $18,609 on consulting.
Looks like the most expensive part of running a campaign for Mpls mayor is, as with most endeavors, people.

Reich quietly expresses his support for Rondo as well. Appears unanimous. Public hearing on Rondo will be Aug. 9, Hodges says.
Johnson also expresses her support for Rondo. Says voters decided some time ago to make mayor &amp; chief terms not be concurrent. Likes that.
Thoughtful stuff from Glidden. Agrees with Rondo that he can't make a 5-yr business plan. Situation too fluid. Says PD needs city's support.
Glidden talking about how long she's known Rondo. A Senate confirmation hearing this is not.

Glampe says on Saturday morning, every officer should be complying with the new policy, so the audit can assess on that standard.
Dep. Chief Glampe: PD has unlimited storage for footage, but sifting through it could be time-consuming.
CM Palmisano wants to know if the city has enough storage for all the footage that will be collected under new policy announced this morning
"Yep, that's readily available data," Tetsell said. But they won't be able to answer in the audit why a body camera wasn't turned on.
CM Yang back on officer usage. Cites KSTP story saying they aren't being turned on, wants to know if that's part of the audit plan.
CM Gordon wants to know how cooperative the PD has been. "Honestly they always have been," Tetsell said.
Tetsell: not so much, because the focus has been on the equipment and the system
CM Yang wants to know if question of whether officers are using the cameras has come up yet.
Will Tetsell: "the audit may not answer everyone's questions" but might bring new things to light.

*Kjos. Inspector Kjos.
Jost: Probably a couple of months until the automatic activation technology is installed in every squad car. Installation ongoing.
Rondo: The new policy will take effect on Saturday.
Rondo: Cameras have to be turned on manually, but PD has purchased tech to automatically turn on cameras. Lights activation will be trigger.
Rondo: "Still instances where they will have some discretion." For all dispatched calls, self-initiated activity, traffic stops, cameras on.
Rondo: Many officers use body cameras a lot, some "don't use them nearly as much as they need to"
Rondo: Body cameras must be on when police are called. Promises a "full range of discipline" when it doesn't happen.
Rondo: "What good is a camera if it is not being used when it may be needed most?"

Dehn won comfortably in 2, 4, 5, 7 and 10. Frey was close in 1, 9 and 12. Frey won comfortably in 6 and 13. Dehn was close in 3.
Hodges' best Ward was 11, which is John Quincy territory, where she won easily. She just edged Dehn in Ward 8.

Hoch: "Yes, Minneapolis is a great city. But we know it can be better."
Hoch: "No one, no one, should lose a child to a stray bullet. And a broken tail light shouldn't be a death sentence."
Hoch: "Good enough is just not good enough anymore. I'm not thinking about the next office. This is not just a stepping stone for me."
Hoch: "There's an incumbent. There's an ambitious city councilman."
Hoch says people like his experience and his television ad, in which it's obvious that he's gay. Wants to be the city's first gay mayor.
Hoch taught fourth through seventh grades in Mpls public schools, says mayor needs to do everything to make sure kids are ready to learn.

We are a long way from even nominating candidates for mayor, so here are a few observations.

And the rules and agenda have passed. Now we're set for an update on the alternate delegate upgrading process.
And the Minneapolis DFL decides it's OK to have the word "prayer" in the convention rules. Meanwhile, 1:15 prayer break looms.

Convention kicked off at 10 a.m., as of 1 p.m., the rules of the convention are *close* to being approved.
@dwofthepeople This one was pretty quick.
Delegates vote to give mayoral candidates 10 minutes each to speak, rather than 5. That's 40 minutes lost, for those keeping score.

Hodges, Hoch and Frey campaigns are "groovy" with the amended convention rules. Dehn campaign agrees.
@pyry I haven't seen an accordion, but that doesn't mean the person isn't here.

@JaredGoyette I can sing tenor, bass or high tenor. Need a lead.
What this convention needs, badly, is some special music.
Seems to be consensus that calling the Star Tribune the Red Star is "despicable" but convention "doesn't need an inquisitor."
We're in procedural purgatory. 1 delegate challenged for calling Hodges a communist and the @startribune the "Red Star." Appalling!
@preefor3 @katebrickman not everyone believes them, I should add

The compromise is that there will only be 4 ballots. If no endorsement by then, there will be no endorsement.
I hear the campaigns are cool with the standard 10% threshold for participation after 1 ballot, rising by 5% on each subsequent ballot.
A fight about the rules would be a huge drag on the convention, so I'm happy to report a compromise has been reached.
Rules update! #mplsdfl had some dispute about the mayoral endorsement rules, which I explained here: https://t.co/1AEVKcSgG1 https://t.co/kQwf6H87Ug
@TMoerkeWrites Those are the standard rules, with the threshold for participation rising by 5% on each ballot. The 4 ballot cap is the compromise.
@TMoerkeWrites My sources say the campaigns have arrived at a deal on rules for mayoral endorsement. 10% threshold after 1 ballot, a cap of 4 ballots.

Frey and Johnson say they think smaller businesses should get a slower phase-in than large businesses, which current proposal doesn't give.
Gordon and Cano say they'd prefer a 4-year phase-in over five years, but they're up for Glidden's proposal.
@kidsaanen No. The following exceptions. https://t.co/0tTd862C23
Bender credits workers for their advocacy, says city needs to focus on making the new Small Business Office meaningful.
Even though the length of proposed phase-in is same, route to get there is different. https://t.co/bhT1TRtW80
100 employees is the cutoff between large and small businesses in Glidden's proposal. Same phase-in for both tiers. $15 by 2022.
She respects Frey's opinion, she says, which means they couldn't come to an agreement.
Glidden has a proposal for the phase-in. Long wind-up.
Some last minute negotiation by Jacob Frey. Ran out right before meeting, then whispered furiously with Abdi Warsame for a while.

Time's up. See you at the next one.
Flowers is concerned that the city is trying to keep people out of downtown for the sake of the Super Bowl.
Flowers gets the floor. "This is like a filibuster or something. I don't now what's going on here."
Hodges: "Most people experienced (the 5.5% levy increase) as a cut or their taxes stayed the same." Rahman shakes his head.
Hodges clears up how levy works. You don't get more revenue from growing base unless you levy for it.
Levy-Pounds: "I was stunned when I saw that property tax increase."
Frey: It's about increasing the property tax base.
Dehn: 'We're a city, we have lots of wealth. And sometimes it's OK to raise taxes on people that can afford it."
Rahman on property taxes: They've gone up twice the rate of population growth in Hodges era. Next mayor should commit to stabilizing rate.
Dehn: Regarding Mpls divestment, we need to look beyond fossil fuel industry. Including check cashing. Not sure municipal bank is solution.
Rahman: Trying to start a municipal bank is like buying a lawn mower when your house is on fire. We have more imptnt things to deal with.
Municipal bank idea seems like a waste of time in this forum. Hodges opposed to.
Frey: I'm for maybe the city giving out loans to individuals, but not for a municipal bank. Not practical.
This whole conversation feels like an alternate reality. So different from the usual fare at City Hall.
Hoch: No, Minneapolis shouldn't start a municipal bank. "The city has enough on its plate."
Rahman: $15 is "ham-fisted political opportunism." Small businesses will exit, low-income people won't be able to start businesses.
Flowers: "You'll kill all small businesses with $15." Calls it a "political ploy." Says other remedies needed, particularly aff. housing.
Frey: Hodges flipped her position on min wage. I was looking for solutions to get it done by exploring a tip credit.
Fun to watch these two next to each other. https://t.co/7uOu8oWw6U
Levy-Pounds: "We need to take a regional approach to raising the minimum wage...but we can't wait for St. Paul to do the right thing."
Levy-Pounds: $15 an hour is very doable. Talks about a business in NE that's getting ahead of it, already paying $15.
Hoch: We don't know if higher wages will hurt job growth. A min wage will pass. Job of mayor will be to stay on top of unint. consequences.
Question: Why not raise the minimum wage to $20? Dehn: Why not raise it to $50? He allows that $20 might be too hard for businesses.
Dehn: The statewide min wage increase turned out OK. "As we pump more and more money into the economy, it benefits the system wide"
Question is on minimum wage. Won't it reduce hours? Eliminate some jobs? Dehn going first.
Rahman: Scheduling only pulled back after protests. That's not listening. Minimum wage is getting rammed through. "Paradigm shift" needed.
Hoch: City's "listening sessions" were rendered moot when council and mayor took positions on min wage. Example of not listening.
Frey: "Everybody knows that I'm pro-business."
Do business concerns fall on deaf ears? Hodges says with scheduling ordinance, City Hall listened when it pulled the ordinance back.
Strong sentiment from the panel that the key is to help those who are not doing well in the economy, which will be good for businesses.

@section_sign @ajm6792 Not that this settles the debate. There are many other factors to consider.

@section_sign @ajm6792 that's true, but the restaurant still has to pay payroll taxes on them.

@ajm6792 @SerafinaScheel yeah that's the first I've heard of that about owing more work.
@ajm6792 Both employee and employer. And since most tips come by credit card, most are reported.

She gives a shout to the civically engaged business community, says workforce development is croosh.

Hodges' speeches are cerebral and painstakingly thorough. They are also long and a little monotone.

Now she's discussing climate change/environment. "I love it when people applaud for recycling."
Mpls will stand in Trump's way when he tries to "cut out" people group by group. "That's the kind of wall I can support."

@dbrauer @lukehellier And, in Italy especially, there's a certain level of socially-acceptable open racism: https://t.co/qH3Pojerne
@dbrauer @lukehellier Right. I think you may have a younger, more male and more intense crowd at Serie A matches.
@lukehellier @dbrauer Could be. I honestly don't know why the Italian league is the way it is. But it's a persistent problem.
@dbrauer Just really hard to imagine that type of wickedness emanating from an MLS crowd.
@dbrauer Right. The supporter groups here are aggressively self-policing, and the rest of the stands are diverse in race, ethnicity, and age.
@dbrauer I think so. Even if there's an occasional racist taunt in MLS (which, odds are, there is), what they do in Italy is vicious and widespread.
@AndyStPaul The Fenway Park stuff is an outrage, for sure. I don't wanna minimize that. But I think what happens in Serie A is on a different level.
@nickmagrino would have been super appropriate except for the "beautiful" part
@AndyStPaul Not that there is no racism anywhere in US society, but what happens routinely to Muntari in Italy would not happen in MLS. Can we agree?

Meeting adjourned. Cano making a little victory speech. https://t.co/MrUS5w5NiI
"Alondra Cano is endorsed." Big cheers. Lots of clapping. All done here.
Someone questions quorum, podium says "we clearly have a quorum." Looks like the walkout wasn't an effective move.
Before a final decision, we will have some debate!
They're suspending the rules, and now voting to endorse Alondra Cano by acclimation. Overwhelming in a room bereft of Farah support.
Sign-removers boo loudly as they leave the room, get some hissing from Cano supporters.
A handful of Farah supporters burst in to remove Farah signs from the walls, moving with alacrity.
Freezing the floor now. Again, room is almost all Cano supporters.
@CultureClap the fire started about 20 minutes ago
Now a motion to suspend rules and vote by acclimation to endorse Cano.
Fourth ballot results: 273 votes, Cano 162 votes 59.3%, Farah 93 votes 40%, Schiff 8 votes 2.9%, No endorse 10 votes 3.6%.

@tony_the_scribe hey thanks. It's actually a real nice vibe. Kind of like when a big crowd of people is all starting a good meal at the same time.
A resigned peacefulness falls over the auditorium as the 4th ballot is handed out.
@zjrobins Think that's very unlikely. Assume Schiff would prefer there be no endorsement.
Alondra Cano is 2.2 percent away from endorsement after 3 ballots in #ward9. https://t.co/exnUTUlfVA
Still no endorsement. Need a majority to adjourn, and Cano supporters look like they aren't going to let it happen.
No adjournment. Here come the results of 3rd vote: 273 ballots. Cano 158 57.8%, Farah 94 34.3%, Schiff 11 4.03%, no endorse 10 3.66%.
Just voted on a motion to extend debate before a vote on adjournment. No more debate. Now voting on adjournment. 😬
@LindaIHiggins He's basically running the show in back. His physical presence, obviously, is an important asset.
Extended debate on adjournment happening. Farah supporters want to quit with no endorsement, Cano supporters want to keep going, naturally.

Now there's a motion for adjournment, it being 3 pm, though adjournment wouldn't invalidate the 3rd ballot, being counted now.
Getting a little heated, looks like some delegates not allowed on floor after it was frozen. https://t.co/apAtX4QpsX
Cano is agonizingly close to endorsement, but didn't move much from first to second ballot. Now going to a third, likely final, vote.
https://t.co/iquK2m5NfW
Chants of "endorse" going up from the Cano crowd, guy at the podium gavels away.
Looks like we're going to a third ballot.
A motion on the floor to adjourn -- the rules are either adjourn after 4 ballots or by 3 pm, whichever comes first.
Here come the results of second ballot: 273 ballots, Cano 57.1%, Farah 34.8%, Schiff 5.5%, no endorse 2.6%..
Actually I'm not at all sure about this. Cano is close. Just needs to flip a handful, keep butts in seats, and hope a few Farah folks dip. https://t.co/nsTIQzT0AP
RT @joemat42: So what will be interesting is if Gary's folks go to Farah or Cano @adambelz @dbrauer @NotoriousDGP https://t.co/Sj0xdQoxFW
@joemat42 @dbrauer @NotoriousDGP If they go to Farah then it's going to be a hung jury.
Second vote delayed a few minutes because delegates are still trickling back from prayer. Will Farah still have 93 votes on 2nd ballot?
Schiff could throw his support behind Cano and give her the endorsement, but somehow I think that's unlikely.
And we're heading to a second ballot.
RT @elizglid: History made @annapoetic gets #ward8 DFL endorsement with fam &amp; friends by her https://t.co/ouGNyXFYf4
So Cano is knocking on the door. If she can flip a dozen or so delegates, she'll have the endorsement. #Ward9
Results of first ballot: 275 ballots, one spoiled, Cano got 157 votes (57.1%), Farah got 93 votes (33.8%), Schiff got 21 votes, 7.6%.
Still no results from first ballot. There was a recess for lunch and prayer, delegates starting to file back in for 1:45 restart. #ward9
Ballots are being counted. Two volunteers and two observers requested from each campaign.

@CatalystCooks you guys have results yet?
Farah took the mic, flanked by a crowd similar to Cano's: "I want to make Lake Street what it used to be."
10 minute warning announced before the floor gets frozen.
"Before we can vote for endorsement, we must freeze the floor. Freezing the floor means that no one is allowed to come in from the outside."
Cano talked about building a diverse coalition, clean air, green zones. Since Omar also spoke, Cano's speech was very brief.
Schiff says no action on, funding for affordable housing in last four years: "We cannot afford four more years of no action."
Schiff jogs down to the front, alone: "Welcome to the new Ninth Ward."
Cano flanked by supporters during her brief speech. https://t.co/vTWbPuG4m0
@dbrauer They didn't discuss the results, just said that the recommendation was unanimously approved.

In Ward 9, credentials committee resolved all the challenges (16 from Schiff, 10 from Cano, 7 from Farah). Unanimously. So that's settled.

@Kronykal @Shabbosgoy Fair question. I'd read an oped on that.
@Kronykal @Shabbosgoy Right. But common market is very helpful to these companies, and a breakup *could* be bad for business.
@Kronykal @Shabbosgoy Granted, a Le Pen victory seems unlikely now.
@Kronykal @Shabbosgoy A Le Pen victory could threaten the future of the EU. Impact isn't as direct as a tornado on Lake Street, but it matters.
@bloisolson @Shabbosgoy That's a useful criticism, so long as you can point to specific tough local issues they avoid.
@Kronykal @Shabbosgoy Several of the largest employers in the metro area do a massive amount of business in the EU.

@GettingGophery Thanks. Trying to figure out whether to focus on that one or Ward 1.
@GettingGophery you are the fairest of them all
@GettingGophery Yeah, this could be. Could be Goodman didn't turn out her people as well as Flisrand did.
@GettingGophery In any case, it's not a trouncing in the context of what is is -- an endorsing process requiring 60% -- which I felt like needed correcting.
@GettingGophery I mean, to be fair, Goodman won the delegates 55-45. It's not an election but no president since Reagan has won by such a wide margin.
@GettingGophery I talked to about 20 people around the city to get a sense of what happened that night. Even Flisrand's allies weren't thrilled with results

Correction: this was not a trouncing, as today demonstrated. https://t.co/bscNsTLIHz
The motion carries. No endorsement in Ward 7.
Motion from both campaigns to suspend the rules, and make no endorsement. Loud cheers.
Third ballot. 388 votes, 233 needed to endorse, 208 for Goodman, 53.6%, 177 for Flisrand, 45.6%. Goodman slid back a little.
Has to be considered a victorious day for the left wing of the Minneapolis DFL, regardless of Goodman/Flisrand outcome. https://t.co/ZH3zxSTYE6
No endorsement for Barb Johnson in Ward 4, Ellison won in Ward 5, Bender won in Ward 10, and Goodman struggling in Ward 7. https://t.co/COR3SKSojW
They're counting the ballots now. Not a lot of people left between 2nd and 3rd. Hard to see Goodman getting to 60% here.
RT @emmamarienelson: It's all over, folks. Ellison won endorsement on second ballot.
Things moving faster for third vote. Precinct captains carrying envelopes of ballots to delegates now.
So there's a hill to climb for Goodman to get the endorsement. Flisrand lost only 6 votes btw first and second ballots. Goodman lost 3.
Results of second ballot in Ward 7: 390 voted, 234 needed for endorsement. Goodman 215. Flisrand 174. Goodman at 55.1%, Flisrand at 44.6%.
Ballots being collected for second vote. Both campaign staffs will help with the counting.
@brsomogyi it's not! I have to stay.
Getting testy in here, mostly because people want to be done and upgrading alternates is taking a while. 2nd ballot being handed out.
Some delegates have left. If only I could be so lucky. https://t.co/UCasxtj9MG
That's 54.2% for Goodman, 44.8% for Flisrand. Three spoiled ballots. One person signed ballot, didn't vote.
Out of 402 votes, Goodman got 218, Flisrand got 180. Goodman needed 241 to get the endorsement. Looks like we're headed to a second ballot.
@ziibiing Not yet.
Ballots have been handed in. Being counted. Floor "unfrozen."
There are 409 delegates in the ward. By my math (yikes) that makes the magic number 246 for endorsement.
It's business time in Ward 7, people grouping by precinct, about to hand out ballots.
Frey takes the stage. Has a direct relationship with the center of the microphone. "We need a visible and present mayor."
Repeats again, to an apparently credulous crowd, that the article in the Observer was a response to her speech on Monday night.
Betsy Hodges: "We need a transformational leader...I'm now standing up for us in the era of Trump"
Substantive discussion on a lot of stuff, but crowd getting antsy. Moderator: "This is the last question." Solid round of applause.
Both candidates agree that racism is a paramount issue in Minneapolis.
Goodman: It's always been matter of how we raise the minimum wage, not whether. Thought that min wage study was bad expenditure, still do.
Flisrand: "I have also made my position clear on the tip penalty, because it exposes women."
Flisrand: "I'm really pleased to hear your position, because that's news" for many of us. Points out Goodman voted against min wage study.
Goodman: "This issue requires nuance and elected officials listening. It's not a matter of if we get to 15, but how."
Goodman says racism is the biggest issue facing Mpls and "let me just clarify right now. I support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”
Question, based on caucus results, is whether Flisrand can block Goodman endorsement, which would be a coup for Goodman's opponents.
So for Flisrand versus Goodman, it's "true progressive" versus "I live my values."
@lewismd13 Burn!
Goodman also got a loud ovation, about half the crowd standing.
Goodman says Democrats shouldn't hate each other. "The enemy is not Janne Flisrand and it's not anyone else in this room." Exits stage.
Goodman: Lots of resume summary and specific ideas. "neatest thing that's coming up that I'm interested in working on is electric vehicles."
Goodman: her main issue rn is aff housing. Went after Steve Frenz, fights for tenants. "I have been someone who actually gets things done."
Betsy Hodges standing in the back beneath a recessed floodlight, arms folded, head cocked to one side.
Goodman: "I live my values." x3 "This ward has a level of privilege, and so we have the opportunity to do incredible things."
Goodman: "I'm a council member who lives by my values." No paper, no literature, because today is Earth Day.
So she takes the stage to a standing O from about a fifth of the crowd.
Here comes Goodman. Starts with a video of people talking about her work on affordable housing, but it freezes a minute in.
And Flisrand goes off the stage with her orange-shirted cadre to a throaty, but not standing, ovation.
RT @lewismd13: I spy @adambelz loving life on a beautiful day. https://t.co/BkhNBksfiH
Flisrand: "True progressive" x100
Flisrand: "A true progressive" will support a livable wage, and say loudly that "black lives matter." Big applause.
“They are ready for a leader who listens.” Goodman once suited for city’s needs, but it ain't the 90s any more. Says "true progeressive" x5
Flisrand: Voters are "ready for change, ready for respect, ready for integrity, ready for a true progressive on the Mpls city council.”
The two candidates, Lisa Goodman and Janne Flisrand, come to the front to big applause. https://t.co/y48ZwSL8nQ
@AdamJRossow No, Rossow. He's talking about racial economic disparity. White people do well, people of color not as much.
Ray Dehn: "Lots of skips, lots of trips" in Mpls lately. "Can't have city where 25% struggle while remaining 75% does well." Big applause.
Park board candidate (didn't catch name): "Who wants to tell Donald Trump to get lost?" Medium-high cheer. "It's one city at a time!"
The scene. https://t.co/pvxgrboZuG
@Shabbosgoy They faced Winnipeg. Or Brainerd. Depending on whether you have long or short-term perspective.
Two people are painstakingly going over the rules of the convention, and they've closed the doors in the back, which feels vaguely ominous.
3 delegates with paperwork issues added as alternates on voice vote. Some lady off to the right keeps shouting "No!" to scattered laughter.
@lewismd13 I'm just trying to be #strategic, Matt.
Tom Hoch: "We need jobs, we need safe neighborhoods, and we need affordable housing." Ticks off resume. Good round of applause.
Started off with the pledge of allegiance. Since there's no flag in the auditorium, everyone just faced north.
Outside, it's sunny and 60 degrees, but in here, could be raining, midnight or February. Will delegates jump ship after one ballot?
3 minutes to kickoff, delegates taking seats in the flickering fluorescent half light of this brutalist middle school auditorium.
Seems to be more campaign dress code discipline on the Flisrand side with the orange T-shirts.

RT @StarTribune: BREAKING: Minneapolis City Council members reject deal with Surdyk’s; stiffer penalty must be negotiated https://t.co/1nDU…
The city has rejected the settlement and another one, with a more severe punishment, will be negotiated.
Goodman: “We asked Mr. Surdyk not to be open, the state asked Mr. Surdyk to close, and he said too bad...thumbed his nose" at all of us.
CM Goodman: "I don't believe punishment fits the crime, so I'm going to move to reject the agreement." Says many in public outraged.
Johnson: “In the heat of the moment he made a horrible decision. He can’t justify what he did. He screwed up.”
CM Goodman: “How much publicity did Surdyk get from this?” Why didn't he close when the state told him to, and why put employees at risk?
Johnson: “It’s simply that it was a bone-headed move. We need to deal with it, and accept any consequences that come from the city.”
Dennis Johnson, speaking for Surdyk, said a $6k fine "wipes out any benefit he had being open that Sunday”

@ziibiing Classic Fairbanks scorched earth policy
A little chippier today, which is nice. The last question prompted de facto closing statements. I'm done.
Frey: I am about results. I deliver what I promise. I'll build a broad coalition.
Hoch: I'm experienced and can make things happen. Being mayor would be a capstone, not a stepping stone (shot at Frey).
Levy Pounds: I see my true opponent as the status quo. I am the change agent who will shift the paradigm.
Rahman: I'm against a mimimum wage ordinance, and for hiring 100 more cops. I'm different than the others.
Dehn: I've got a proven record of rolling my sleeves up, doing the work in neighborhoods, where the progress will be accomplished.
Hodges: I'll get in there every day and do the boring stuff to make the city more equal.
Question #6 why should you be the mayor?
Hoch: Mostly agrees with Nekima. Will embark on a project to increase rates of resident approval of police.
Levy Pounds: We can't incarcerate our way out of these problems. Need jobs for people, not more cops.
Rahman: Grew up in Bottineau NE and Camden N, both are less safe. Gotta address immediate problem. Diversify cops, hire 25/yr for 4 yrs.
Dehn: Gotta demilitarize the police. Don't understand what's going on at City Hall.
This timekeeper has put in a good shift https://t.co/XkVsGMxM5M
Hodges: I've led a shift in public safety philosophy toward community policing.
Frey: Need to give cops more time to proactively engage with people on the streets. Need more cops, more cops of color.
Question #5, what will you do to address rising violent crime rates in our city?
Levy Pounds: Important to work with the rest of the state, also important to be a leader.
Rahman: Gotta stay economically vibrant.
Dehn: "We have to do this and we have to do it hard and we need somebody who actually has credibility at the capital."
Hoch jumps in: But we have a terrible relationship with the legislature, mayor.
Hodges: Need to find/build alliances on stuff like local government aid. Greater Minnesota is valuable to us.
Frey: Mpls is a spectacular place but we shouldn't be elitist. St. Paul seems to have better relationships outstate.
Hoch: work with the suburbs on stuff.
Question #4 how do you bridge the gap between urban and rural Minnesota?
Dehn: You have to have ideas to interject into the listening sessions (shot at Hoch).
Hodges: Has concenrs about Mpls going it alone, but we need to raise the minimum wage and shouldn't have tip penalty/credit #credalty.
Frey: Big chains can handle $15 wage, but for small biz can't just do it "for shock value." Seattle's ordinance has phase-in, tip credit.
Hoch: We need to do more for low-wage workers. City is having listening sessions. Let's wait until they're done, then I'll take a position.
Levy Pounds: I think raising the minimum wage to $15 is a sustainable solution.
Warsame is in the house https://t.co/cfuPkafeHP
@joemat42 no example
Rahman: a $15 minimum wage shouldn't be forced on businesses, neither should a prohibition against a tip credit. Work with small biz instead
Question #3 is about a higher minimum wage, do you support it, do you support a tip credit?
Hodges: We should keep our separation ordinance. Says she has already undermined ICE raids.
Frey: We need to stand up for Muslims and undocumented immigrants. No clear definition of a sanctuary city. Not sure we are one.
Hoch: Agrees with everything already said, but we also need a vital economy, even though that "sounds like fluff."
Levy Pounds: I will instruct MPD to not cooperate with ICE. Ppl also need econ opportunity and fair treatment from schools, landlords.
Rahman: Yes, gotta keep Mpls as sanctuary city. Also have to make sure city is in strong financial shape to deal with Trump threats.
Dehn: City must help protect undocumented immigrants, working with non-profits. Would undermine ICE raids.
Question #2 has to do with the separation ordinance and sanctuary cities.
Frey: Utah did some productive stuff on affordable housing for the homeless. Philadelphia instituted mandatory foreclosure mediation.
Hoch: Gotta play on a national stage like Austin (SXSW), Boulder (food industry), Indianapolis (technology).
Levy Pounds: Gotta follow Seattle's lead on a $15 minimum wage.
Rahman: Emulate Kalamazoo's program that gives people access to higher education. Reykjavik has a great youth program on substance abuse.
Dehn: We need Portland's transit development strategy. And decriminalize marijuana, legalize it recreationally.
Hodges: Complete Streets (Minneapolis already has such a policy: https://t.co/G1g7SYPlNB)
Great question: What policy should be taken from another city and implemented in Minneapolis?
Frey: loves Mpls	Hodges: transformational	Dehn: came from bottom	Rahman: safety/budget	Levy Pounds: sick of status quo	Hoch: vitality needed

7. ...to be had about penalizing landlords for blanket refusal of Section 8 vouchers. But the ad campaign boiled down to the threat...
6. That’s dishonest because 75% of listings in Mpls are already unaffordable to Section 8 renters.		There are philosophical debates...
5. The ad also falsely implies that 84% of rentals in the city would become unaffordable to Section 8 renters if prices rise $50 per unit.
4. Rent may rise due to the administrative burden of more vouchers, but Sec 8 is only 6% in Mpls + ~200 unused vouchers. A market sliver.
3. @bloisolson and his clients don’t actually believe “coastal rents” will happen in Mpls, if by that we mean dramatic price increases.
2. The landlords’ ad is misleading. It claims the ordinance will cause rents to hit “coastal” levels, but the word is all heat, no light.

Energy starts leaking out of the room every time one of the presumptive frontrunners, Hodges or Frey, talks.
Hoch says police shouldn't arrest people for smoking weed, gets a nice round of applause. #mplsmayorforum
Rahman: We'll hold 179 recruitment drives to find new black, Latino, female police officers. #MplsMayorForum
Levy-Pounds: “Community policing is not just handing out hot dogs and holding photo-ops.” #MplsMayorForum
Hodges on police reform: “no city in the country is doing all of what we’re doing to build that trust, but it takes time.” #MplsMayorForum
Levy-Pounds: "It's not just Republicans we have to watch out for. It's DFLers who are comfortable with the status quo." #MplsMayorForum
Aswar Rahman, the 22-year-old filmmaker, is strikingly different. Not familiar with the conversation, which is kind of refreshing.
Pretty much unanimous agreement that nobody likes the state's preemption bill. #MplsMayorForum
$15 min wage: Rahman against. Levy-Pounds, Hodges (maybe not 15), Dehn for w/out a tip carveout. Frey &amp; Hoch wait and see. #MplsMayorForum
Dehn: “We've been running from crisis to crisis...marginalized communities need  access” Can't fix disparities without work. #MplsMayorForum
Frey: “Need a visible and very present mayor...not rhetoric, not lip service, results.” Says can end homelessness in 5 yrs #MplsMayorForum
Nekima Levy-Pounds: "I believe I can usher in the change and help make us a leader in equity and justice for all.” #MplsMayorForum
Aswar Rahman: “Anyone who looked at the budget as closely as I have would be running for mayor...That budget is a mess.” #MplsMayorForum
Betsy Hodges: I'm doing "the hard work of transformational change. It's not about headlines." Also, need to resist Trump. #MplsMayorForum

Political speech is hard, esp. for non-political people, but pro-tip-carveout servers gotta sort this out if they want to influence debate.
Then the next three servers spoke against a tip carveout. The case for a carveout is a business case, which no one made for an hour.
3 of the first 4 slots were given to restaurant owners, and then the first server who spoke went on a rant about unions.
Servers who want their tips counted toward a higher minimum wage hosted a forum last night, and it was confusing https://t.co/7k9DVAdvSp

@elindie a lot of servers told me that's doable, and seems plausible.
@elindie fact is a server needs to make $5.50 an hour in tips to get to $15 in Minnesota.
@elindie I agree it's not a matter of opinion and I'm also frustrated. Gonna keep poking at it.

19 One prominent county, Miami-Dade, has already bowed to the order, and received a congratulatory tweet from Trump. https://t.co/RhSYYOiEHG
18 So this looks like a county issue. The ball’s in Sheriff Stanek's and Sheriff Serier’s court. Here’s my story: https://t.co/JJ051LdUuO
17 Krikorian should know. He informed Trump’s policy: https://t.co/36glpxCBiX And he doesn’t care about separation ordinances, he told me.
16 ...and counties will be punished for declining detainers, said @MarkSKrikorian, even if they don’t come with a signed order from a judge.
15 But among those who want tighter immigration controls, it’s clear. The head of @wwwCISorg says county jails are the order's target...
14 Counties are just now starting to grapple with this, and awaiting guidance from DHS, which isn’t returning my calls. They’re busy.
13 This is where the threat of lost federal $ comes in. Hennepin ($198mn) and Ramsey ($89.6mn) get way more federal $ than Mpls or StPaul.
12 And though it’s not 100% clear, it appears Trump is demanding that counties honor ALL detainers, regardless of judicial authority.
11 What this means is that county jails should be receiving far higher numbers of detainer requests from ICE while Trump is president.
10 Trump wants Secure Communities back, and he instructs ICE to use far broader criteria in seeking removal of an undocumented immigrant. https://t.co/gxV3oVOTU4
9 Stanek cited legal concerns and the cost of holding inmates for an extra 48 hours for immigration authorities. Policy is unchanged.
8 Meanwhile, Hennepin Co. said in 2014 it would decline detainers *absent a judicial order.* https://t.co/pYpZiGAWHj
7 Then DHS ended the program in 2014, instructing ICE to focus on terrorists and felons, not petty criminals https://t.co/a7IIO0RYOe
6 Counties cooperated less as detainers ramped up. Notice % of Hennepin inmates who ended up in ICE custody after a detainer was issued. https://t.co/jOF1bNcQOn
5 “It was very, very bad,” said Daniel Farías, S. Mpls. “They just put a detainer on anybody for something as simple as a traffic stop."
4 The program mostly took effect under Obama, and caused ICE to issue lots more detainers in Hennepin Co. Hispanics remember. https://t.co/wwKRARayAQ
3 He reinstates “Secure Communities,” a program that produced a sharp increase in "detainers", requests for jails to hold an inmate for ICE. https://t.co/B4kejJclGg
2 Trump’s executive order does two things that are quite important and fall directly on county jails: https://t.co/AEPNduu17x
1 Everybody’s talking about sanctuary cities, but the real deal is counties, jails, and their (un)willingness to hold inmates for ICE.

@natepentz @dbrauer and Brauer is right about all the businesses that depend on Target. A vast network.
@dbrauer whoops. It's been dropping fast.
@natepentz @dbrauer it's such a different world now. Target probably has more employees in California than Facebook does worldwide.
@morganmz @dbrauer small and medium sized businesses are great, don't get me wrong, but Target employs ~14k people downtown.
@morganmz @dbrauer and because this is true, every city needs new companies to grow, get big, and be the engine for a while.
@morganmz @dbrauer big companies have an inherently finite shelf-life. If that's what you mean by "unstable", sure.
@dbrauer Mpls needs new companies to grow and get big. Nobody really comes to mind, right?
@dbrauer right. Life downtown as Target dwindles is a huge issue, looming closer than most people realize.
@dbrauer that is way beyond the capacity of anyone currently in city government.

6 “These researchers are going to start asking why African American unemployment is almost always double that of whites," Belton said.
5 “Drilling down into sort of the deep pathology of these social and financial problems is what I’m hoping for,” Belton said.
4 An investigation of economic disparity today must engage with the historical realities of slavery, Jim Crow, “benign neglect”, he said.
3 Belton was a key player in this unveiling, and said his hope is the Fed’s research capacity will be aimed at “uncomfortable questions.”

Among biggest takeaways for me are Yellen's full support and the advisory board, which is truly world class: https://t.co/fGULIswUXO
First question on minimum wage. Kashkari: There are tradeoffs, extremes in both directions. Belton: $15/hr does not exclude economic growth.
(paraphrase) Belton: Is it futile to just study a problem? Kashkari: Fed has limits, we'll help with research, help empower others.
Belton: What about raising the minimum wage? Kashkari: There are tradeoffs, we need to be honest about them.
Kashkari: "The time for incrementalism is over."
See livestream here: https://t.co/CRe93GE0Ny
Good interview by Belton. 2nd member of Park Avenue Methodist Church who has tangled with Kashkari in a town hall meeting in past 6 months.
Interesting that he calls lack of black economic success a problem "decades in the making." Probably most in this room would say *centuries*
Kashkari thinks if the institute can help solve this problem for some, can help solve it for all.
Urban League's Steven Belton asks whether opportunity "for all" is a retreat from the driver of this, lack of black economic success.
On the disparities: "I didn’t expect to find this, and I don’t understand why it is that way."

Minnesota doesn't have worst disparities in US, but ranks 41st in income gap, 40th for unemployment &amp; test scores, 42nd in HS graduation.

29. Read the story! https://t.co/EuvguOQg6o
28. I’m not sure what the right solution is, but Ethrophic’s experience in both the suburbs and the city gives a nice window into the issue.
27. There’s an ongoing, decades-long debate between Myron Orfield and Ed Geotz about how to address this. Google them if interested.
26. But it matters where you grow up, and so does race. Rural &gt; urban. Suburbs &gt; city. And a lot of black people live in the city.
25. When it comes to economic mobility, (aka the American Dream), Minnesota is one of the best places in the world.
24. This is the key question, to me. Black people are doing poorly in the economy, yes. But can black children do better than their parents?
23. The data asks not about inequality, but about *mobility*: How likely is it for a child born into a low-income family to rise in society?
22. The massive set of economic mobility data assembled by Raj Chetty emerged as a good way to address these issues: https://t.co/6S7tc3rBhD
21. I wanted to find a way to write about the disparity in a fresh, constructive way.
20. I sincerely believe most white people wish this were otherwise, that there were no disparity between whites and blacks.
19. Estimated black unemployment in Minnesota: 8.3%	     Estimated white unemployment in Minnesota: 2.9%
18. Black median household income in Minnesota: $29,873	     White median household income in Minnesota: $63,127
17. Oppression and discrimination have gutted black communities in all kinds of ways, and today we still have wide disparities.
16. History matters, and freedom from *legal* oppression is a FRESH reality for blacks. Illegal, informal discrimination is another thing.
15. And second, only black people born after 1964 have enjoyed full legal status in this country since birth.
14. Let’s get a couple obvious things straight. First, slavery was codified in law on American soil longer than it has been abolished.
13. What’s rarely argued out loud about these disparities is that they are borne ultimately of slavery and segregation.
12. The racial economic disparities in Minnesota, and nationally, are well-known. Almost a cliche at this point.
11. “And I believe we will do better. Thanks very much everybody,” Obama said, and then left the podium.
10. “...substandard schools, and inadequate jobs, and a lack of opportunity. We’ve got to tackle those things. We can do better.”
9. “Too often we’re asking police to man the barricades in communities that have been forgotten by all of us for way too long in terms of…”
8. Then he drew a line between police shootings of black men and economic problems in America’s black communities.
7. “We don’t expect in my lifetime — maybe not in my children’s lifetime — that all the vestiges of that past will have been cured.”
6. “We’ve got some tough history and we haven’t gotten through all of that history yet,” Obama said.
5. At the end, he drew a line between police shootings of black men and the persistent legacy of slavery: https://t.co/uG87G4SeWe
4. In July, after news broke of Philando Castile’s death, President Obama spoke from Poland and ad-libbed much of a 16-minute speech.
3. People can draw their conclusions, but key for me is those 6 children, and their chances of economic success. Here’s some background.
2. Been getting lots of email this morning criticizing the fact that Ethrophic Burnett has 6 children https://t.co/EuvguOQg6o

Kashkari: “I look at the polarization of the country, and I think it’s a direct outcome of the financial crisis.”
He estimates the cost of a financial crisis at 158% of GDP. But, interestingly, goes further in describing the cost of crisis/bailouts...
@Birdyword @neelkashkari not an annual figure, but yeah, a big estimated cost. He points out estimated cost of a crisis is 158% of GDP.
@Birdyword @neelkashkari nope
So @neelkashkari believes full adoption of plan carries a permanent cost of 41% of GDP, which is steep, but not as bad as another crisis.
4) simpler, less burdensome regulations for community banks, to allow them to thrive and take on bigger share of banking activity
3) a 1.2% or 2.2% tax on debt at hedge funds, mutual funds and other finance companies, in order to prevent risk from moving to shadow banks
2) US Treasury to certify that banks are not TBTF, or ELSE, their capital requirement rises to 38%. Rule is designed to break up mega banks.
1) a 23.5% common equity capital requirement for banks w/over $250b in assets. That's WAY higher than current avg of ~6% for 8 largest banks

On FOMC: "I legitimately think ppl are looking at the data, trying to do the right thing for country, and I don't want to screw that up." https://t.co/Wb8wnts3PP

On challenge of preventing financial crises: "You can't legislate wisdom...We had nationwide collusion that home prices will always go up" https://t.co/4IABgYlCPz
Kashkari on impact of @MinneapolisFed's TBTF recommendation: "high probability ppl will pay attention," can't say if action will be taken.

After first answer...	Kashkari: “That’s like saying these are lousy businesses nobody wants to invest in.”	Avgouleas: “At least in Europe.”
Kashkari asks the first question after panelists are done: Why not force banks to just issue more equity?
Next up is Larry Wall, from the Atlanta Fed. He, like all the others, speaks for himself and not his employer.
Drillers in the Bakken getting way more efficient, refracking has become standard https://t.co/0hKYvsS229
Next up is Stuart Plesser, a director at S&amp;P Global Ratings.
Flannery likes using market value as a trigger. Market value may be biased and manipulated, but book values are definitely biased, he said.
Hard to assess solvency outside a time of crisis, Flannery said. Bank runs, however, reflect *market* beliefs about the bank’s solvency.
Why? “It’s just too hard to expect that supervisors are going to be on top of banks aggressively, and force them to raise capital”
Flannery steps back a touch: “Supervisors have chronically permitted the largest banks to operate with quite high default probabilities”
The upshot here is that Avgouleas prefers CoCos over bailing-in. Next up is Mark Flannery, chief economist at the SEC.
Market value triggers are even more suspect, says Avgouleas, a prof at the U of Edinburgh. Kashkari dons reading glasses, consults program.
This is what Emilio Avgouleas is talking about at @minneapolisfed rn. Accounting-based triggers, he says, are "easily manipulable."
CoCos are debt that can be converted to equity in the case of a bank failure. But how? What is the trigger that forces the conversion?
here's a good definition of a bailing-in: https://t.co/53rcGEchDZ
The idea is that if they end up getting hurt too (they didn't in 2008) then creditors will be more careful in the future.
Both CoCos and bail-ins are efforts to force bondholders to share in the pain if the bank they lend to ends up failing.
Wonder how many followers I can lose tweeting this discussion: "Why CoCos Are Less Problematic Than Bailing-In of Liabilities" #endingtbtf

@tcliffordw 70s were a glorious post-WWII anomaly. U.S. couldn't account for half of global economic output forever. That's the wage story.
@tcliffordw you're blaming wage stagnation since the 70s on illegal immigrants?
@tcliffordw they might! It's shameful bc it's fearmongering and scapegoating. It's not a real problem.
@tcliffordw though to contradict someone like you, a student and champion of America's poor, does give me pause.
@tcliffordw the preoccupation with them is hysterical nonsense, and I'm not at all convinced the preoccupation belongs to the poor.
@tcliffordw School by my house is full of Latinos, many the children of illegals. The jobs their parents do, U.S. citizens don't want.
The GOP fixation on illegal immigrants, which obviously predates Trump, is a shameful preoccupation.
