@katyperry @DUALIPA @vmagazine @katyperry  about 40% of edible food is thrown   every year while over 40 millions Americans, including millions of kids struggle with hunger. Bill #hr3444 want to end this non sense so will my foundation. Please take some time to discuss #foodwaste and todo #fighthunger. Thx
@SenSanders Please @SenSanders support bill #hr3444 #FoodRecoveyAct so millions of struggling Americans can ride above poverty, grocery stores can donate and be protected from liabilities. #ThrowingFoodIsNotCool and it hurts the environment. Hungry kids are struggling kids. Thanks
@KamalaHarris The congress should pass bill #hr3444 to protect low income Americans from hunger and grocery stores that give to charities from liabilities. People are going around hungry. Starved kids can't perform in school. This a sad situation.
@chrissyteigen Cool. Please @chrissyteigen, let's make #foodwaste a well discussed issue. More than 40mln Americans struggle with #hunger but at the same time grocery stores, restaurants, schools...throw $millions worth of edible food. No sense. Let's support bill #hr3444. Food recovery act
@TheEllenShow @johnlegend Let's I form people about #foodwaste as a means to end #hunger in the USa. Over 40 million Americans go hungry hungry. They should get the edible food grocery stores throw away not the landsfill. And then #savetheenvironment. Support bill #hr3444
@CNN He should think about the millions food insecure US children who can't focus in school and pass the food recovery act, bill #hr3444 b4 he leaves. Ending hunger is a noble cause, something to make his own kids proud.#foodwaste is also an issue to tackle sooner than later.
@jimmykimmel Let's talk about #foodwaste but this time as a mean to reduce poverty.#ThrowingFoodIsNotCool, it hurts the environment, + 40 millions Americans go hungry every day. I say let's give the edible food groceries usually toss to charities. Let's promote bill #hr3444.
@CNN Please inform people about #foodwaste. Over 40 millions Americans including children are food insecure while there is a $165 billions #foodwaste problem in the country. Edible food must go to charities not the landsfill as bill #hr3444 suggests. Let's people know about it.
@corlebierman Hold on and be strong. Think about the positive in dark times.
@JustinTrudeau When will Canada get a law against #foodwaste to lower #hunger. It's good for economy, the environment and people in need. Now is the time. #ThrowingFoodIsNotCool
@Eminem There is so much #foodwaste in the US and yet   1/6 Americans struggle with hunger and at the he same time no one talk about bill #hr3444 to end this non sense. I think edible food should go to the needy not the landfill. What's your take @Eminem ?
@Eminem Lol. Excellent !
@EdaraBabyG On it. Thanks.

@BillGates if you have a minute I'd like to hear your opinion on lowering food waste as a mean to end hunger. Thanks.
@SpeakerRyan Please pass the bill #HR34444 because too many Americans struggle with hunger even with a job and at the same time many grocery stores struggle with #foodwaste. This is a 2 in 1 solution.
My favourite one. Thanks. https://t.co/f1zRkrFSgq
According to the UN 815 millions people go hungry everyday. https://t.co/qcBBkb5884
