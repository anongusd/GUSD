As my grandmother used to say — a hit dog will holler. https://t.co/kC34Ldd0is
Our students shouldn't fear going to school because of this gun violence epidemic that has snuffed out too many lives. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate https://t.co/6XKE47vy1A
Florida families shouldn’t have to live in fear of being one illness away from bankruptcy. As governor, I’ll expand Medicaid for 800,000 Floridians and fight every day to make sure every person in this state has the healthcare they need. https://t.co/LP7ynBRWLg
On November 6th, we have a chance to send a loud and unapologetic message that common sense and decency still prevail here in the State of Florida. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate
Turning our streets, schools and communities into war zones must end. I promise to finally hold the @NRA accountable for what they've done in Florida. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate
As Governor, I’m ready to clean up our environment once and for all. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate https://t.co/tcwZxk8oEN
I'm running for Governor of Florida. We've got 99 problems, and trust me, Hamilton ain't one of them. Time for us to focus on the issues facing everyday Floridians. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate https://t.co/Ozll4w3DCp
As my grandmother used to say, a hit dog will holler. And boy oh boy, @RonDeSantisFL... #FLGovDebate
Get the truth on my record. Not more of @RonDeSantisFL lies. #RonDeLiar https://t.co/2gIT4aKXhr
No person is an "illegal." #BringItHome #FLGovDebate
Immigration &amp; border control have an important job to do. Separating children from their parents shouldn’t be one of them — no matter what @RonDeSantisFL &amp; @RealDonaldTrump say or do. #BringItHome
A tiny fraction of the wealthiest corporations are walking away with $6.3 billion thanks to @RonDeSantisFL &amp; @RealDonaldTrump's #GOPTaxScam. I’m saying they can keep $5.3 billion -- I just want just $1 billion to pay our teachers, train our students &amp; invest in our schools. https://t.co/0VcJgWDdod
I remember watching my parents trade between which bills to pay before the lights get cut off. Enough of the handouts to the wealthiest 1 percent. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate
.@RonDeSantisFL is the same congressman who told us that the #GOPTaxScam would trickle down to everyday folks. #RonDeLiar
I’m simply asking for the richest corporations to pay a little more of their fair share — so we can invest in our workforce and public schools. #BringItHome #FLGovDebate https://t.co/4AOII6cAfA
I believe healthcare is a right. @RonDeSantisFL doesn’t. Facts matter. https://t.co/NbXlTBJZlt
Let me deconstruct my opponent @RonDeSantisFL’s lies — and let’s talk about the issues. 		Health care. 		Affordable housing. 		Public education. 		Let’s get to it. #FLGovDebate
I should have asked more questions of those around me, and I accept responsibility for that — but I’m running for Governor. Florida has 99 problems, and Hamilton ain’t one of them. #BringItHome
We have seen the collapsing of our political discourse, and my opponent has run a playbook very similar to the moral equivocation of our President. He should know better. #BringItHome
Ready to #BringItHome. #FLGovDebate https://t.co/3sRAplOsvA
The last debate in this election is happening in 5 minutes! Tune in &gt;&gt; https://t.co/3lgHQ1YXQ8 https://t.co/dJykXINdC4
We’re tired of the brand of politics we’ve been seeing for over two decades. We want a governor who will fight for all Floridians, not just those at the top. That’s the kind of governor I want to be, and when I step up on that debate stage tonight, I hope you’re with me. https://t.co/h6pjMIEa2j
Thank you @CecileRichards! Talking to voters and turning out every vote early is how we’re going to win this race. If you are volunteering, share your experience with us. If you have voted already, let us know! #WomenForGillum https://t.co/fchH4D8qQm

Everyone needs to vote early so that you can spend your time on election day moving people to vote and helping us turn out every single voter we can. RT if you’ve voted early!
You can't be a governor of the state of Florida unless you are willing to represent all of the state of Florida. That’s what I’m ready to do, and I hope you’re with me. Tune in at 7PM tonight for our second debate in this election. https://t.co/pqtsCyaAax

There is absolutely no place in our country for physical threats or violence like this. There can be no gap between our parties on this issue. https://t.co/hMDHvqSaZX
My opponent is trying to do everything he can to distract &amp; use smear tactics—but the second debate is tonight &amp; here’s what I’ll be ready to talk about: issues that Floridians care about. I’m running for governor to represent all of them &amp; no distractions can change that.
#WomenForGillum We’re calling on you to assemble your squad, vote EARLY, and take a photo that Team Gillum will share. We have just two weeks left and we need your help to get out the vote and #BringItHome https://t.co/G8yneMXGli

We should have had a Congress that actually dealt with immigration. We should not be terrorizing people here in this country. #FLGovDebate #BringItHome
I believe healthcare is a right. 7.8 million Floridians have a pre-existing condition and they deserve access to coverage. As governor I’ll fight to make sure every person has the care they need when they need it. https://t.co/RubgVxGKY3
.@RonDeSantisFL let us know exactly where he was going to take this race the day it began. #FLGovDebate #BringItHome

The wealthiest 3% of corporations are walking away with 6.3 billion dollars in new tax giveaways. With my plan, they can keep 5.3 billion of that. Everyday Floridians just need 1 billion to invest back into our schools, our students -- and pay our teachers what they’re worth.

I am grateful to everyone — local and out of town — who kept Tallahassee safe during &amp; after #HurricaneMichael. While power has been restored in the Capital City, there is much work to be done to our west. 		We are all in this together. 🙏🏾	https://t.co/GlUgPJtj3T
Agradezco tu apoyo @JohnLeguizamo! Juntos estamos creando un movimiento y un mejor futuro para toda la gente de la Florida. https://t.co/tu1Fu0YpAJ
A new season starts today for the @MiamiHEAT and @OrlandoMagic. Good luck this season to both teams. Let's get another championship and #BringItHome to Florida! https://t.co/KGxHLkZq5h
With 20 days left before November 6th, we have to be out there talking to voters every single day. I’m still in Tallahassee right now, but thank you to everyone who is out there powering this campaign 🙌🏾 https://t.co/Xi16PrRrvs

During times like these we should draw closer and come together. There are still so many people and communities working to rebuild after Hurricane Michael, so if you can join us in helping our neighbors, head here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/lPd7eB30RQ
Just like Congresswoman Frederica Wilson says: Vote early, vote absentee, and just make sure to VOTE! Early voting starts as early as October 22nd, and we have just 20 days left to #BringItHome https://t.co/LDzEGjEuTC
When you elect me as the next governor of Florida, you’re going to have a governor who believes in science and who believes global warming and climate change are real. https://t.co/9y9VLnZUWB
Too many Floridians are literally too poor to get sick. Too many Floridians are choosing between paying the doctor’s bill or the rent. We have to #BringItHome so health care is a right for everyone.
20 days! That’s all that’s left in this race, so we have to do everything we can to get out there out-strategize, mobilize, and organize the other side. Volunteer to help us: https://t.co/PhGL1LPI2w https://t.co/RSdqLrunZU

Together, we’re going to keep working to ensure all our neighbors can rebuild after Hurricane Michael -- and we’re going to be stronger &amp; more resilient for it. #TallyStrong
R. Jai, you’ve been my partner and my rock — I can’t think of anyone else I’d want in this fight with me! It’s time to #BringItHome for the people of Florida. https://t.co/zNLMzenpud

To our Haitian brothers and sisters who call Florida home and have family and friends on the island, I want you to know we stand ready to assist in any rescue and recovery efforts that are needed. It is during these times of devastation we need to be united.
On behalf of myself and the people of Florida, we send our thoughts, our prayers and condolences to the people of Haiti and the families of the people who were lost and hurt during and in the aftermath of the earthquake.
Taking care of our environment IS taking care of our economy. This is true in Stuart and every other city across our state— red, blue, or purple. 		#BringItHome https://t.co/MlQq1lqjrm

Due to gun violence, too many children will wake up tomorrow without a parent; too many parents are going to bed tonight without a child; They deserve more than our thoughts and prayers – they deserve action.
Some people would have you believe that I am extreme because I believe that everyone should pay their fair share. Working people pay their fair share without complaint, corporations must be accountable to do the same.
I am living proof of what is possible if we come together, if we work together, if we march together, and if we can stand up for what we believe in -- together. #BringItHome
There are millions of Floridians – from Jacksonville to Lakeland to Clearwater to West Palm Beach – who are just like me. Kids with big dreams in the shadow of big challenges.
My father was a construction worker and my mother was a bus driver. Without people believing in me, and a good public education — I know that there is no other country where my story would be possible.
We have a chance to harness the power of a movement – a movement for better jobs and higher wages; for small businesses and innovation; for public schools and teachers; for healthcare as a right.
On November 6th, all Floridians across the state will have an opportunity to chart a new course. I need you to cast your ballots, raise your voice, and to speak out for a better future. #BringItHome

@ricardorossello @DarrenSoto I stand with the Puerto Rican people and support their right to self-determination &amp; equality for all citizens. Their voices should ring loudest in this debate — not division and derision from the White House.
We rallied with Puerto Rican public servants from near &amp; far — @ricardorossello, @DarrenSoto, &amp; leaders from across Central Florida. We talked about a brighter future for our children, better pay for our teachers, &amp; affordable health care for all.
When I’m Governor, we’re going to be unapologetic friends of our Puerto Rican brothers &amp; sisters — and today was a big step towards that goal. We registered new voters &amp; we met with seniors &amp; community leaders.
Our children’s education matters. Paying teachers what they’re worth matters. Investing in Florida’s future matters.
I’m a friend of Puerto Rico today, tomorrow and the day after — and even the day after that one. Thank you for your support in this race #BringItHome https://t.co/vqd2B6iSCV

One year after 58 precious lives were taken from us too soon in Las Vegas, some of our elected officials refuse to act &amp; keep our communities safe. Today, too many people fear going to a concert or school — and we need to change that on November 6th.

Rick Scott is an "Election Year Environmentalist" — and as Governor, I promise to clean up the mess he's left behind. We need to hold polluters accountable and protect our environment &amp; wildlife. https://t.co/AkrfKXBi9G #GillumForGovernor
The Republican gubernatorial debate was a pathetic disaster. The only winner tonight was @realDonaldTrump. Too much name-calling &amp; too few solutions. I refuse to let anyone’s kids grow up in a Florida led by either  @adamputnam or @RonDeSantisFL.
We shall overcome the injustice of #StandYourGround through our words, our votes, and, if necessary, civil disobedience.		Mr. @FLGovScott — suspend this law now. https://t.co/SL07LlbLon

Dolores Huerta es la encarnación viva del servicio público. Ha sangrado por los derechos laborales, civiles y de las mujeres, y es humilde ganar su respaldo mientras tratamos de dar a los floridanos todos los días una voz una vez más en nuestro gobierno. #GillumParaGobernador
Dolores Huerta is the living embodiment of public service. She has bled for labor, civil, and women’s rights, and it’s humbling to earn her endorsement as we seek to give everyday Floridians a voice once again in our government. #GillumForGovernor https://t.co/jqOOIYkjsR

Rick Scott will try to stack our Supreme Court in his final hours in office. We must hold the line on the 3 impending Florida Supreme Court vacancies &amp; when I am Governor-Elect, my Admin. will use every tool available to ensure Floridians have their voices heard.
With his pick of Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump has done everything in his power to push the Supreme Court into the world of ultra-conservatism. A woman’s right to make her own health care decisions is at risk. Voting rights are at risk. Collective bargaining is at risk.
Rick Scott, a true “Election Year Environmentalist” can pretend he suddenly cares about Florida’s natural resources, but we know the truth. His assault on science, including banning the words “climate change” and cutting the DEP Budget, have hurt our environment &amp; families. https://t.co/SHNOjS5ABK

A decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice; we can have them both &amp; I promise to fight for that as Governor. (3/3)
Donald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency — not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately. (2/3)

If we fail to secure this special session this year, I will push for one next year as Governor.

#TaxDay should remind all of us that big corporations &amp; the ultra-wealthy are the ones benefitting from this #GOPTaxScam. I'm the only non-millionaire in this race for Governor, and more than ever, working Floridians need someone who understands their struggles &amp; triumphs.

It also does next to nothing to address the everyday gun violence that doesn’t make cable news, but still plagues our cities and communities. At a time when we could have truly attacked the root of this problem, this GOP-led bill did far too little to keep our families safe.
It fails to address the easy availability of military-style assault weapons, the glaring loopholes that let criminals and domestic abusers buy guns, and the continued use of bump stocks.

Before Tuesday’s debate, I just want to let you know that I couldn't be prouder to represent you and the progressive change we're fighting for in Florida. More details to come. https://t.co/VoS5dbmQwX
The Republicans’ bill is an abject disaster for public education &amp; their tactics on FEFP are shamefully cynical. Our kids deserve far better. #HB7055 https://t.co/V9GEexq5Ho
#HB7055 is yet ANOTHER attack on public schools, students &amp; educators from @richardcorcoran. Our legislators like @ShevrinJones &amp; allies are standing in the gap against it!✊🏾 https://t.co/eCdv7rwCT2
Thanks to Trump's tax scam, our richest and biggest corporations have announced about $157.6 billion in stock buybacks - billions which don't "trickle down" to workers. We need leaders that put workers' pay before executives' pay. https://t.co/S8vv2YlvqV
When workers' wages are stagnant, public school teachers are underpaid, and too many are struggling to make ends meet, our priorities must be on our working families -- not stroking the President's ego. https://t.co/NFvp97iHB3
Yet another attack on public education &amp; teachers, the people we trust with our most precious resource, our children:	❌ Attacks on public schools	❌ More public funds to for-profit schools	❌ Lower teacher salaries (when they’re already underpaid!) https://t.co/511mZpE7UX
Families and seniors need viable, smart solutions - not scams that cut Social Security. https://t.co/joprUm5v2V
Last month, @RealDonaldTrump’s Administration announced plans to auction off drilling rights for 90% of our nation's ocean acreage for development.		This is a direct attack on coastal states like ours -- but we have a chance to stop it &gt;&gt; https://t.co/uKHj6qvRUi https://t.co/Dca0iIgxLA
I’ve never been afraid to stand up &amp; fight for those who need a voice &amp; next Tuesday will be no different. I’ll never be silent when the forces of intolerance &amp; division put down their dog whistles &amp; pick up bullhorns. https://t.co/DPfwOmB2c7

Florida’s system for restoring voting rights is a relic of the Jim Crow era &amp; it must go - either through the courts or on the ballot in November. https://t.co/odaReazhEY?amp=1
