Dont turn down anyone. Fight everybody. It pisses me off when the tuf guys pick and chose fights based on whos less of a challenge. They are fake. Fight the baddest dude in there. Be a man.
Why wait for the belt when you can jump right in and get a payday plus stay busy fighting another killer. Take risks. If u lose, then you weren't ready to be champ yet
I cant really talk because im not a pro fighter or amateur but I completely disagree with picking and choosing fights, and declining to fight someone because you will only fight for a belt. Thats just lame. You are gonna fight the person anyways. What does it matter

I am a republican. I believe in a smaller government, strong, flourishing economy especially small businesses. A strong middle class. and a strong military to protect our citizens. These brave men and women deserve the most we can give them. They are our super heroes.

Im better then this
Prove to myself that I deserve that blue belt i was awarded by Master Marcio Stambowsky.
I do work hard. Im an extremely hard worker. Ive been all my life. I just wish i could get past this anxiety and prove to myself again
Im just a slow learner. And im not athletically gifted. I have to work extremely hard, harder then others to succeed
If i see others grasp on to somthin with ease where i have to work 5 times as hard to understand somthin it can be frustrating nd depressing
I just put so much pressure on myself nd when i dont see myself doing better in my eyes i shut down mentally. I just dig myself into a hole
It is my life, my passion &amp; my future
My mind is totally off. I want to, i need to be back training.
My anxiety kicked in today pretty heavy. Possible first day back to training in a while and I couldnt handle it. I shut down.

Most in Hollywood never worked a real day in there lives. Try being in the middle class for one day. You wouldn't last
And giving money to support our veterans then maybe you can have an opinion.
Hollywood keep your asses out of politics. When you start giving your millions to those who are on welfare taking advantage of our system
