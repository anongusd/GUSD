@bradplumer Baby 411 is good just for basic questions (eg what is this rash?), as the title suggests. Precious Little Sleep is my Bible but that definitely falls into the...polarized parenting camp.
@bradplumer Wonder Weeks is good mostly bc it allows you to reframe every bout of unexplained fussiness as part of a “developmental leap”, e.g. my cranky child is actually a genius. Woo, Confirmation bias!

.@RepKClark also points out that landlords are choosing to leave the Section 8 program because they're fed up with shutdown threats + budget brinksmanship. This is all just exacerbating the housing crisis facing the poorest Americans.
Just a few years ago, lenders were ramping up loans to undocumented immigrants. Why? They're better at paying down their mortgages.  “If they’re out of a job, they figure out how to generate income.” https://t.co/3MNA1f6rwT
HUD asked about reports that it's discouraging lenders from making home loans to DACA recipients, per @nidhiprakash: https://t.co/GLBt2XsETl HUD's #2 said "it hasn't come from me" and that policy hasn't changed.
I do agree that there was some unnecessary and counterproductive alarmism about the shutdown's impact, from the media and others. But the harms were real -- and will continue to make themselves felt for a long time to come.
Non-profit groups and landlords had to float MILLIONS of dollars of costs, which prevented them from being able to make other investments and repairs. https://t.co/ajN3x39JFd and https://t.co/cfabnwfh3e
.@RepkClark points out that domestic violence groups could not access HUD funds. (HUD's #2 says it was a technical password problem, exacerbated by lack of staff.)

@GlennThrush Thanks, Glenn!
@Rachael_WV It's a complicated relationship -- the local housing authorities (which run public housing and administer Section 8 vouchers) are actually independent, non-profit entities funded by the feds, with close ties to local gov't. But HUD in DC runs other kinds of subsidized housing.
As @GlennThrush recently reported, landlords across the country are turning away Section 8 voucher holders amid rising rents. https://t.co/VaYSIfp13E I wrote about a different Sec. 8 program, but you can understand why HUD is wary of scaring off landlords in a tight rental market
All this points to the biggest, most obvious, yet seemingly intractable problem -- the severe shortage of affordable housing that's trapping tenants in awful conditions, makes the gov't hesitant to go HAM on bad landlords, who can then take advantage of everyone.
But as I explain in the story, HUD is often reluctant to bring the hammer down on private landlords, or come across that way, because it wants and needs them to continue participating in Section 8 &amp; other affordable housing programs.
Other agencies do this very explicitly -- e.g. DOL provides very detailed reports on each investigation of a mine fatalities https://t.co/reqIOV5UEo. Even if you don't want to publicize individual cases, you can publish aggregate stats on enforcement actions taken.
Having this kind of enforcement data is important not just for accountability -- but also because it can serve as a deterrent for bad actors by sending the message that HUD is up to stuff and has its eyes on you.
It's not even clear that *HUD itself* knows what's going on internally. This new GAO report says HUD no longer tracks certain outcome measures -- like how many residents are now living in acceptable conditions as a result of its enforcement actions. https://t.co/fjHV0lnu0V https://t.co/EOMqgWMwPZ
The lack of public data makes it even harder -- for lawmakers, housing advocates, journalists, tenants -- to hold HUD accountable, particularly when it comes to the worst cases/properties/landlords assigned to its enforcement office.
Even then, I couldn't find any HUD enforcement reports prior to Nov. 2017. It turns out that HUD simply *didn't do them* -- even though they were required to under federal laws passed by Congress. As HUD told us: "There are no earlier reports to share."
It took some real arm-twisting and cajoling to even get these reports from lawmakers. One Hill staffer told me the reports were "proprietary to the committee and not available."
In response to past scandals surrounding Section 8 living conditions, Congress required HUD to provide lawmakers with regular reports on its enforcement activities and the state of failing government-subsidized properties.
HUD's enforcement office is tasked with going after the worst landlords and fixing the most appalling housing conditions. But there is almost no comprehensive, publicly available data on what the office is actually doing.
There were a lot of shocking things I found while reporting out this story -- appalling housing conditions, federal laws flouted as a matter of routine. 		But I was also flabbergasted by the lack of accountability &amp; transparency at HUD. https://t.co/RPeCx3gMBN

That domestic labor--like other forms of caregiving--is often invisible and undervalued. But there's a steep toll on families + the economy.
So Medicaid is our *only* safety net for long-term care. Cuts will put the burden on family caregivers--esp. women. https://t.co/u8bn3CJndy

Private long-term care insurance exists, but it's costly and the market is a mess. https://t.co/k4tEyR5Yfk
So middle-class families end up having to spend down their savings to qualify for Medicaid -- the only safety net for long-term care.
Average nursing home costs ~$80k/year, full-time home health aide cost ~$22-45k/year, depending on the region.

Oy, I think I screwed up the formatting of that Tweet storm. Lesson learned: never Tweet(storm).
That's why we have journalists covering the debate! And Twitter, and everything else. Ok, end of rant.
But this idea that "the moderators should fact-check everything!" is just misguided, and also impossible.
@SuzyKhimm That's not to say that moderators shouldn't call the candidates out on blatant lies and misleading statements.
@SuzyKhimm (And that was during the 2012 elections, when we didn't have a pathological liar running for president.)
@SuzyKhimm There was no way we were going to catch and vet everything, and our only job was to sit at a computer.
@SuzyKhimm At Wonkblog I worked with four other journalists who were way smarter and faster than I was, and it still took us forever.
1. Having fact-checked my share of debates, I'll say this: actual, real-time fact-checking is really tough and surprisingly time-consuming.

Have no idea what really happened w/ Lochte. Just good reason to be skeptical of Brazilian judges as well as victims' inconsistent accounts
I was once mugged at gunpoint in Rio as well. But the Rio police and judges were the last people I trusted or thought to turn to.
Judge also says Lochte &amp; teammate's accounts were inconsistent, could be true. But US coverage seems too credulous toward Rio authorities.
Having lived in Rio and reported on Brazilian prisons, I'll say this -- the Brazilian judicial system doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
Brazilian judge says Lochte &amp; Co. didn't *look* like they'd been mugged, based on security video taken 2 hrs later. That's some weak sauce.

Sorry, guys! Need to take Tweetstorm 101 from @HeerJeet, obviously.
Uh, whoops. Apparently I have no idea how to tweetstorm and should have replied to myself in every tweet to thread them.
Ok, I’m done now. &lt;/tweetstorm&gt;
11. Hydra, the DNC is not…even if DWS had wished otherwise.
10.  So the idea that the DNC is some all-powerful apparatus run by shadowy evil geniuses is even more absurd now than pre-Obama.
9....the Obama-era DNC is so underpowered &amp; inept that it couldn’t have swayed the fundamentals of the Dem primary even if it wanted to.
8. It was obvious even before Wikileaks that DNC was trying to pull for Hillary. But having withered on the vine for the last 8 years...
7.  Well before the email stuff came out, the DNC was making utterly headscratching, self-destructive decisions re: debates, for instance.
6. But the DNC’s dysfunction is clearly also hurting Dems now, in the 2016 races, without a popular charismatic candidate in the lead.
5. The neglect/indifference of the DNC &amp; the official party apparatus has hurt Dems downballot in the Obama era: https://t.co/ZHj9KjQ7Kr
4. The DNC was never a priority for Team Obama. That’s why he didn’t bother to replace DWS in 2012 despite grumbling &amp; calls for her to go.
3. This mentality toward the DNC/party never fundamentally changed even after Obama was elected and became the official head of the party.
2. Obama 2008 displaced/replaced the DNC as the central organizing apparatus. Obama’s own team was running the ship, not the DNC.
1. Party orgs have become increasingly irrelevant as charismatic, well-funded individual candidates have their own campaign infrastructure.

It's all relative. But for DC intellectuals (journalists, policy wonks etc), $150k household income isn't "the wealthy." $2 million is.
