@MeeePlease @instagram Yes, I feel horrible for my wife, who worked so hard and diligently on fostering a great sense of community on her account. One day it was just gone. As if deleted/hacked. We still don't know what happened, but no communications through instagram have helped.
@dantoffey Hi Dan! My wife's account was deleted for an unknown reason and she  has been devastated. She is a photographer and just wants the pictures  she previously posted downloaded or account restored. Anything at all  you can do to help me achieve this Christmas miracle?

@pescami This is a bad take. Significantly more Dem seats than Repub seats up for election. Only 1/3 of Senate is up for election every 2 years.
@JayCaruso I don’t think anyone is upset. I think you just obviously are misunderstanding Sampson’s words. Obviously meant the voting blocks and not the candidates.
