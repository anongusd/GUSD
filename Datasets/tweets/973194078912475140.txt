@rrankert People like Klobuchar will split those votes which is why I think he can‚Äôt win.
@rrankert That‚Äôs what‚Äôs is gonna hurt him a lot in the primary, the fact he‚Äôs a moderate. I don‚Äôt think he has a chance of winning but I think he‚Äôll appeal to a somewhat sizeable but still relatively small portion of voters.
RT @RepJerryNadler: To be clear, this tweet counts both as inane AND anti-Semitic. https://t.co/zUPL0hIcDf
@rrankert I agree and after seeing his announcement video, I think that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs he‚Äôs gonna do and it probably will work for him.

With the entrance of Hickenlooper I‚Äôm going to score him very high. As a Coloradan I‚Äôve seen the work he can do and he‚Äôs done a lot. He‚Äôs legalized marijuana, made the economy recover, Passed universal background checks, and passed healthcare for 95% of Coloradans. Still he‚Äôs...

I have to say, I like this video a lot. It touts his progressive accomplishments like healthcare and background checks while proving his ability to be bipartisan. I think he might have a chance and being a contender. https://t.co/Tff60AwwZ5

Colorado senate just voted not to expel a fellow senator. He was being expelled for sexual harassment. All democrats (16) and 1 republican voted for expulsion, all remaining voted against. 17-17 vote of 35 senators. The senator being expelled did not vote.
