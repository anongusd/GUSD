Dear @realDonaldTrump: Dems were not in control last term &amp; @GOP stopped us from investigating.

Unlike the narrow scope of Mueller's investigation, the House Judiciary's oversight mission is broad: did @POTUS committ ANY crimes or misconduct? Our investigation will either exonerate Trump, or it won't. We will follow the facts wherever it may take us.		#SundayMotivation https://t.co/j8h8ZOv8pJ

Why are we even reading about explosive statements like the one below? Why did info about @realDonaldTrump ordering Jared Kushner be given a security clearance leak to the press?

Dear @WinstonLaw: If the new stories about Jared Kushner are accurate, then:		-Your partner Abbe Lowell made statements that were misleading.		-Mr. Lowell, through his spokesman today, CONTINUES TO MISLEAD.

@EricInfoTech @WinstonLaw So why would @realDonaldTrump lie about it?

@sswilli9912 Congress on a bipartisan basis significantly increased funding to border security the last two years. It was such a large increase that the Trump Administration has only managed to spend 60% of it.		#FactsMatter
@MoosePuddles I agree with your general point. That's why Congress on a bipartisan basis funded significant increases already to border security last year. And the Trump Administration has only been able to spend 60% of the funds.
@goldblum_zeno Did you come up with that all by yourself? Impressive.
If there was a real "national emergency" at our border would the President be sitting alone in the White House sending tweets making fun of people? NO.

I agree with GOP Senator @lisamurkowski. The Senate should pass the 6 bipartisan House appropriations bills to reopen government. https://t.co/LwzIe8rfAe
@KurtSchlichter When it comes to terrorists, we should hunt them down and kill them. When it comes to illegal drugs, we should interdict and stop the flow. When it comes to criminals, we should find them and prosecute them. That's why I support border security and oppose the wall.
@FreePaulSolar @FAANews I did issue a statement. Try using Google or Bing or another search engine.
@BilloRights6 @FAANews Actually, I've voted yes on multiple bipartisan bills to reopen government.
@ShakenAunt52 @FAANews Try to reopen government.
@uwetweet @FAANews Um, the tweet includes an article and asks a question. Do you know the answer to the question?
@Based_Right @FAANews Fewer. Based on the Administration's data, violent crime is down. So is property crime. Border crossings are at a 20 to 45 year low. Border apprehensions dropped 75% since 2000. 		Based on Fox News fact check, undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native born Americans.
@AnnConstitution @FAANews Did you read the article?
@justjanedoee @FAANews Did you read the article? It's about FAA inspectors, not air traffic controllers.

Dear @parscale: Public polling shows the opposite. But you know what, it doesn't matter. DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER ALLOW TRUMP TO GAIN LEVERAGE BY HURTING AMERICANS THROUGH A SHUTDOWN.

Dear @FAANews: 5 more days have passed since the below article appeared with no additional FAA inspections of airplanes due to the #TrumpShutdown. So here is a very simple question for you:		Is it safe for the American public to be flying right now? https://t.co/oCno9D4wlZ
@bradplumer @noahqk @ColumbiaUEnergy Exactly. I was a coauthor of California's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act. One reason the CA law has been successful is we didn't write an unwieldy bill that mandated 427 things to do. Instead, we set a goal and gave an agency the power to take us to that goal.

@al_ghazi1 @realDonaldTrump Try this: 		Saudi Arabia committed war crimes in Yemen.

@walterowensgrpa @realDonaldTrump So you think a wall on the East Coast would have prevented 9/11?

@potenspuella I don't disagree with you. But that would require Congressional authorization. Only approved use of force was to go after terrorists.

@rperly1 @BruceLHart Thanks. Some thoughts:		-Much of the war was unauthorized. Only congressionally approved use of force was going after terrorists.	-No articulation of the desired end state.	-Who were we even supporting?	-No strategy for how 2000 US troops gets us to the non-defined end state.

@BruceLHart What makes America great is that you absolutely have that right.
The last two terms I introduced the strongest House bill ever to tackle #climatechange. I will reintroduce my Climate Solutions Act in Jan.		Mandates 100% clean energy by 2050; 80% renewables by 2040; and 40% renewables by 2030. Also creates stringent energy efficiency standards. https://t.co/LYv6SWfhkT

@JoshEdits @realDonaldTrump That's a fair criticism. I agree the process Trump used was inappropriate.
@JoshEdits @realDonaldTrump Yes. But my position since day 1 has been that most of the deployment of US troops to Syria was unconstitutional. The only use of military force Congress authorized was to go after terrorists.
This is an awesome speech by @RepTimRyan on the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/rgmYMVALt8

@Zachary_Scotty How about we honor the Constitution by not engaging in wars without Congressional authorization?
@CHURCHLADY320 A small force of 2000 US troops doesn't give the US much leverage to dictating any terms of an exit.
@sosomanysarahs That's fair.
@WokeSnacob Um, we are still in Afghanistan. How is that working out? Not well.
@trovermarie @Blitz_N_Me @POTUS Actually, bringing our troops home is the main point.
For any liberals who now suddenly agree with war hawks about using force in Syria, here are some questions:		-What is the desired end state in Syria?	-Who are we supporting?	-How does a small force of 2000 US troops get us to the end state?	-How much endless war is enough?
@Gr8nessNaHoodie There has been a power vacuum for years. A small force of 2000 US troops was never going to change that. How much endless war in Syria is enough?
@JJWV78 @POTUS Congress never authorized war in Syria to benefit our allies.
@jymbo916 @POTUS I don't disagree that the process Trump used was inappropriate. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be bringing our troops home.
@dnx_mc @POTUS For years I have criticized both the Obama and Trump Administrations for engaging in an unauthorized war in Syria without a strategy. How much endless war in Syria is enough?
@tokenaut @POTUS How many years of unauthorized war in Syria is enough?
@sheagrimm @POTUS Um, so 2000 US troops leaving Syria threatens our democracy? It doesn't. What is more threatening to our democracy is the unauthorized use of military force in Syria.
@sincerekac @POTUS There is also no plan for our forces to remain in Syria. How much endless war is enough?
@RonnieCasaii @POTUS Congress never authorized war in Syria, period. Only approved authority was to go after terrorists.
@kitty4hawks @louis2nd @POTUS Congress never authorized putting US troops in harms way for our allies.
@LaurenBolton3 @POTUS There is no plan. That's why we should bring our troops home.
@B0rdertourista @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Never said he is our savior. But he is right to end the mostly unauthorized war in Syria.
@Cynfulfan @POTUS We've been in Syria for years. How much endless war is enough?
@copperbird7 @POTUS I don't disagree that the process Trump used was inappropriate. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be bringing our troops home.
@mrsquarefacewww @POTUS The notion that 2000 US troops was going to make a significant difference is incorrect. We've been in Syria for years and have nothing to show for it other than continued chaos.
@sydrasmith @shualbrecht @Covfefe3623 @POTUS I served on active duty and know we have an awesome military.		Troops should never be sent into harms way without Congressional authorization and without a strategy.
@sydrasmith @shualbrecht @Covfefe3623 @POTUS Congress never authorized deploying troops to a war zone in Syria to benefit our allies.
@slhamlet @POTUS I don't disagree that the process Trump used was inappropriate. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be bringing our troops home.
@HelenKennedy @POTUS I don't disagree that the process Trump used was inappropriate. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be bringing our troops home.
@Mr_Pleasant @POTUS Whether or not it benefits Trump, bringing our troops home is a good thing.
I have long opposed using military force in Syria, Afghanistan &amp; Yemen for many reasons, including lack of a strategy &amp; lack of an achievable desired end state using force. 		I don't care who the President is; if @POTUS gets us out of endless wars, I will support that action.
@WilliamBold2 I agree the process was inappropriate.
@jessdontstop I think so in this case.
If you believe in the rule of law &amp; Constitution, then you should support the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. 		There was no Congressional authorization to send US troops into harms way for Kurds or humanitarian reasons or to oppose Russia or Iran or Turkey.
@xiaff227 @POTUS There already is a void. A small force of 2000 US troops were never going to do much.
@jgoodman751 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He may have. That doesn't mean we shouldn't bring our troops home.
@EnnuiMalaise @POTUS Only authorized use of force in Syria was to go after terrorists.
@AnneLeonardPta @POTUS I am, but mostly I'm thinking about the Constitution. Much of the war actions in Syria were not authorized by Congress.
@faraiwe @POTUS Congress never authorized the Administration to go to war for the Kurds. Only authorized use of force was to go after terrorists.
@Blitz_N_Me @POTUS I agree with you on that point.
@JWorthen2020 @POTUS I agree Trump doing this by tweet was not the right way to do it. But I support the substance of his decision.
@Eliza328 @POTUS I didn't miss all that. But perhaps you missed that most of what the Administration was doing in Syria was not authorized.
@On_Politike @POTUS Read my tweet. It says going after terrorists was authorized. But not all the other stuff that people are bringing up now.
@svskier1 @POTUS The Constitution is pretty simple on this point. Congress never authorized much of the war actions in Syria.
@patjameswi @POTUS Congress never authorized the Administration to go to war for the Kurds or for any other group. Only authorized use of force was to kill terrorists.
@pkmoor @POTUS Then there should be a congressional authorization that says we are deploying our troops into a war zone to support the Kurds.
@MAGAMemeFactory @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Read my tweet to which you responded. Read my press statement supporting Trump on this issue.
@JJ63380934 @POTUS Yes. But I also believe in the Constitution and much of what we were doing in Syria was not authorized.
@RebeccazWriting @POTUS I don't know what you believe. But I do know it is wrong to deploy our troops into a combat zone without Congressional authorization and without a strategy.
@jmiddlebrook @POTUS Marine combat veteran @RubenGallego agrees with me.
@Jeffm8r @POTUS No.
@5280_native @POTUS There was no Congressional authorization to go to war for the Kurds. I took one oath. It was to the US Constitution and I intend to honor it.
@taylor_newbold @POTUS Fine. But that doesn't mean it is wrong to bring our troops home from Syria.
@schroedinger_ @POTUS Yes. But I still support the right thing.
@MAGAMemeFactory @POTUS You do realize, don't you, that I am supporting @realDonaldTrump on this issue.
Note to liberals who now support military force in Syria because of the Kurds or Russia or Iran or Turkey or humanitarian reasons: NONE OF THOSE WAR ACTIONS WERE AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS. Only authorized use of force was to go after terrorists. @POTUS is right to withdraw troops.
@JosephPSimonLaw If we are fighting a war to protect Kurds, there needs to be Congressional authorization.
@HotLeper We never authorized the troop deployment in the first place.
War hawks again using hyperbole to justify military intervention. Let's put #Syria into perspective. The US had about 2000 troops in Syria, which is the size of just ONE small to medium size brigade. US never had much leverage in Syria, nor did the Administration have a strategy. https://t.co/Mo5GRRsT8x

@CADISTRICT33 @SebGorka @POTUS Actually, I didn't pick a fight. But if @SebGorka is going to mischaracterize my position, then I will respond. 		Oh, and unlike him, I didn't get fired from my job. In fact, I just got re-elected with the highest margin I've ever gotten.

Dear @realDonaldTrump: You still didn't get a Chief of Staff. Mick M would only commit to being an "acting" Chief of Staff because he did not want to do the job for the long term.		Maybe that's because he doesn't see a long term. https://t.co/8YVOkgwrdl
@SebGorka I would do the exact same thing I'm doing now, which is defending the First Amendment. If you actually listened to the interview, I said more than once that it was better to have the First Amendment.		But maybe that's why you were fired by @POTUS, because you don't listen.
Oh https://t.co/C2EAYnPEt0
@ItaliangirlinVa @jwgop Thanks for your thoughts. The Inspector General has look launched an investigation. Let's see what the report says.
@biggiesnotdead Do you know the facts of what happened?
This paragraph made me cry.		"Jakelin Caal Maquin jumped up and down when her father told her they're leaving their impoverished Guatemalan village for the United States. When the rest of her family sent them off, nobody imagined the 7-year-old girl would not come back alive." https://t.co/TUVzBGNuYt
The hating on immigrants by @realDonaldTrump (plus his sabotage of Obamacare) turned Orange County, CA blue. The continued policies of hate by @POTUS will cement Orange County--and much of America--as Democratic territory. #GOP will also lose an entire generation of API voters. https://t.co/HrcPzAmvvO

Remember when @realDonaldTrump &amp; #GOP said they wanted to protect preexisting health conditions coverage? They were lying. See below. The GOP assault on Obamacare, which protects preexisting conditions coverage for all health plans, continues. One reason @POTUS loses in 2020. https://t.co/6tanFWEFxL
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Unlike cabinet officials, Mick Mulvaney does not need to be confirmed. That means he doesn't need to be "Acting" Chief of Staff, he can simply be Chief of Staff. Unless you are hedging because you're not too sure about him. https://t.co/y1pkndoGKq

Dear @SaudiEmbassyUSA: Three simple questions for you to answer:		--Have you listened to the audio of Khashoggi's torture, murder and dismemberment in your embassy in Turkey?		--Where is Khashoggi's body?		--Are you done lying to the American people and Congress yet? https://t.co/Me7WT5wnLE

@JohnLeguizamo Thank you for your kind words.
@McAllisterDen There are 3 ongoing investigations. You have no idea what the evidence is and neither do I. We need to wait for law enforcement to conclude the investigations.
@McAllisterDen I use collusion as shorthand for conspiracy. One reason Mueller indicted a lot of Russian operatives is to show they violated federal law. And if Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russian operatives, then they also violated federal law.
@McAllisterDen There are at least 3 ongoing investigations according to the Flynn sentencing memo. At least one is related to collusion.
@McAllisterDen The Rule of Law depends on the ability of law enforcement to conduct investigations. That requires people to not lie. That's why perjury is a felony. 		There are several ongoing investigations. You don't know the evidence &amp; neither do I. Need to wait for investigations to finish.
As a former prosecutor, here is my view of the Flynn memo:		-Mueller is signaling to other targets that if they cooperate, they will get leniency;		-There are "several ongoing investigations";		-Mueller believes his job is secure &amp; felt no need to disclose what he has uncovered. https://t.co/cZVg9CL7RW

CA/IL/NY/NJ accounted for 15 Red to Blue flips in the midterms. The #GOP intentionally raised taxes on middle class voters in numerous blue states, and the voters fought back. 		Who led the charge to raise taxes on millions of these families? @GOPLeader McCarthy of California. https://t.co/KZPrEp0wWu
@CynicalPublius @GOPLeader California is a donor state to the federal government. We give more in taxes than we get back in services, so we are effectively helping subsidize numerous other states that get more back from the federal government than they give.
If Republicans &amp; @GOPLeader McCarthy are smart, the first thing they would do in the lame duck session in Dec would be to reverse the SALT deduction cap that raised taxes on millions of middle class families. Their tax increase helped cause numerous #GOP incumbents to get fired. https://t.co/gsfc18NgeM
@ArrrrhBeeeee @realDonaldTrump Clearly the voters disagree with you. Republicans lost the popular vote in a midterm by the highest margin in US history.
Here's some unsolicited advice for the #GOP if they want to be relevant in the House again:		-Don't raise taxes on millions of middle class families	-Don't sabotage health care	-Don't enable corruption by @realDonaldTrump	-Don't hate on immigrants		This is not rocket science https://t.co/5R9ZKVJVFt

@rotter_michael @DowJones @Nasdaq It was observed today. That's why the federal government was closed. And the bond market too.
@TruthisnotT @realDonaldTrump California only owns 2% of the forest land. The biggest landlord is the federal government. California is also a donor state to the federal government, meaning we give more in taxes than we receive back in services from the federal government. 		#FactsMatter
@JaxBchLady @realDonaldTrump My job is to do the right thing, not to be a rubber stamp. The Framers set up Congress as a check and balance on the President. If Trump has a good policy, I will support it. If it's bad, I will oppose it.

@mattyglesias There is some correlation, but candidates are different &amp; districts are different &amp; spending is different &amp; endorsements are different.

The mockery by @POTUS of Dr. Ford wasn't just vile, it contradicts how memory works. 		Think back 30 years ago. You'll have some memories. Some will be vivid.

When two people volunteer to say they committed THE SAME sexual assault, it is awfully suspicious. Looks like the 2nd version of Ed Whelan's ridiculous doppelganger story.

Below is potential corroborating evidence to the sworn statement by Julie Swetnick, in which she alleges gang rape.

THIS IS A FOURTH ALLEGATION.		As a former prosecutor, I'm not surprised more women victims are stepping forward. All the allegations have a similar pattern: Kavanaugh becomes a monster when he gets drunk. This kind of abusive and criminal behavior doesn't just happen once. https://t.co/wiUcLzb2o0
The most important take away from the rambling and at times bizarre #TrumpPressConference is that @realDonaldTrump said he wants to hear from all the women and that his mind could be changed about Kavanaugh.		That means GOP must call Deborah Ramirez &amp; Julie Swetnick to testify. https://t.co/cIQ7rIV11Q

Dear @realDonaldTrump: Avenatti is not the person making accusations. His client Julie Swetnick is. She said she was gang raped with Kavanaugh present. She said he spiked the punch at parties.

What Dr. Ford describes is criminal conduct by Kavanaugh, such as battery. Voluntary intoxication is not a defense. Being 17 is also not a defense, but it may affect whether a defendant is tried as an adult.		The law has already settled this "ethical" question by Bari Weiss. https://t.co/JpHDWxp4j5

@Noctalunis I'm watching Jimmy Kimmel. It's a good show.
@kilopapamike Dr. Ford's letter describes an attempted rape. You can also call it a sexual assault. Being a sitting federal judge is not a defense.
@PaulZWaDC As an attorney, congressman and former prosecutor, I find the story by Dr. Ford to be credible. She privately told her therapist in 2012 about the sexual assault. She didn't want to come forward publicly. She passed a lie detector test.
There are many judges who love the NRA &amp; oppose Roe v. Wade--but did not engage in attempted rape--who can be nominated. I don't understand why GOP needs to back Kavanaugh. If GOP confirms him, the message they would be sending to sexual assault victims is: we don't believe you. https://t.co/m1ie6bP6Hz

I note that in this new Kavanaugh statement, he does not say he was not at the party. Did he know Christine at the time? Was he in the same room with her at any time? Was he drunk? What was his recollection of what happened at the party?		The GOP must #PostponeTheVote. https://t.co/5kFIDyWjjS
@Patterico It's certainly one indicator for evaluating a victim's story. Can a lie detector not be accurate? Yes. But it's a relevant data point that she passed the test.
I agree with @JeffFlake. Need to #PostponeTheVote.		Kavanaugh's story is not that he was too drunk. He says sexual assault did not happen. That means he remembers something else.

@RadioFreeTom Thank you Tom.
@MattWalshBlog Let's take your line of reasoning where the story is true. If Brett Kavanaugh is lying about his recollection, do you think he should still be confirmed?

My thoughts are with the people of Hawaii.		Also, one consequence of climate change is more extreme weather events like Category 5 hurricanes.

The guilty plea of @realDonaldTrump attorney Michael Cohen, the conviction of Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and the indictment of GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter reaffirm three principles that are self-evident:		Truth is truth 		Corruption is corruption 		The law is the law

@dinad1215 @PostOpinions Multiple bills have been introduced. If you want a strong law, help change the makeup of Congress this November.
@jthunders13 @PostOpinions I oppose the meddling by Iran. But Iran's actions do not justify the #Saudi Coalition in committing war crimes.
This @PostOpinions editorial on #Yemen is absolutely correct. The US needs to end its support for the #SaudiArabia coalition, which has dropped bombs on hospitals, schools, weddings, funerals, and a school bus. These airstrikes look like war crimes.	https://t.co/ecOnmdz2uW
The statement by Rudy Giuliani that "truth isn't truth" is another step towards authoritarianism.

It seems @realDonaldTrump is angry if someone is a "RAT." But law enforcement across America rely on cooperating witnesses &amp; sources to help fight crime &amp; enforce the law.

@aaronjmate Thanks. I agree the US should not be involved because Congress did not authorize the US military to engage in this civil war. That's why I keep calling for US assistance to stop &amp; trying different legislative actions as well as requesting an Inspector General investigation.
@aaronjmate I taught the Law of Armed Conflict. Proportionality is one of the principles. If US assisted #Saudi coalition knew there were kids on that bus, it would be a war crime. Difficult to imagine any situation where intentionally or recklessly killing 40 kids would not be a war crime.
This statement by Steve Bannon is correct. But it would be more accurate if the "c" was changed to a "w" in the word "could." https://t.co/TEj8fUvOuZ
Why is @realDonaldTrump so afraid of the documents @FBI received? One duty of law enforcement is to review information &amp; determine if it is relevant to an investigation.

Your regular reminder that when defendants can't rely on the law or the evidence, they resort to attacking law enforcement &amp; the judicial process.

Saudi Arabia states the airstrike in Northern #Yemen was a "legitimate military operation." If the #SaudiArabia coalition targeted a school bus carrying children, or acted with reckless disregard, that would not be a legitimate military operation. That would be a war crime. https://t.co/Af0EyNInJJ

It's Sunday. That means @realDonaldTrump is lying, again. There is more than enough readily available water in CA to fight the fires. 		The truth is that wildfires across the United States started increasing in the 1980s. Some of this increase is attributable to climate change. https://t.co/K0V6bKT9Go
Conspiring with a foreign power to get dirt on an opponent in US elections is a violation of campaign finance laws.

@Leung__Wendy Thanks, will let you know next time! Also, my district includes Agoura Hills.
These repeated (and now boring) misleading tweets from @realDonaldTrump are inconsistent with the actions of an innocent person.

Just because @realDonaldTrump obstructs justice in full public view by calling on Sessions to interfere in Mueller investigation doesn't mean it's not obstruction of justice.

Collusion is another way of saying conspiracy. And conspiracy is a felony.

Gallup has tracked @realDonaldTrump since his relatively small inauguration. On 2/12/17, Trump was at 53% disapproval, 41% approval. About a year and a half later, he is at 55% disapproval, 40% approval. 		Turns out that sabotaging health care is not a winning issue for the GOP. https://t.co/L8rwd7zlpp
Rudy Giuliani is a former prosecutor. He knows that conspiracy is a crime. If anyone on the @realDonaldTrump campaign took even one overt act in furtherance of the Russian hacking attack on American elections in 2016, that would constitute a conspiracy and a felony. https://t.co/vZ2wPB1D37
@cvpayne The President throwing America under the bus in Helsinki, and potentially committing felonies with Cohen as a witness or co-conspirator are, in fact, more newsworthy than one quarter's GDP results.
As a former prosecutor, I've seen this pattern again and again. What happens when a defendant can't rely on the facts or the law? He attacks law enforcement. See example below by @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/QvdSCx0qu0
What makes America great is that @realDonaldTrump doesn't get to decide what is collusion or conspiracy. Law enforcement &amp; the judiciary do. Congress can as well.		Also the Nunes memo states the investigation started before FBI knew about Dossier, which keeps getting corroborated https://t.co/LfgKW8OvRf

Honored to speak in Santa Monica at the 53rd Anniversary of #Medicare, hosted by the @CAPhysAlliance. Medicare is one of the greatest programs ever created by the government. But the GOP budget proposes deep cuts to Medicare. You can stop that by helping Dems flip the House. https://t.co/lNOIAYRbm7
The liquidation of US treasuries by Russia is interesting. If Russia did this to leverage the US in some way, it failed. The market shrugged. Why?

From a legal perspective, it's arguably worse if, as Giuliani asserts, "no payment was ever made" by Trump to AMI. That means @realDonaldTrump knowingly accepted an in-kind campaign contribution from AMI that is more than 55 times above federal limits. https://t.co/d81zyj2Gtw

I fear our Committee is becoming a joke. https://t.co/ukDtkwtHsn
Dear @realDonaldTrump: You are correct a productive dialogue is good. But your dialogue with Putin was not productive for the US. You threw America under the bus. 		I served on active duty and never imagined our Commander in Chief would deliver the talking points of the Kremlin. https://t.co/UbEtcgSxqz

Dear Chair @RepGoodlatte: How about @HouseJudiciary actually do a hearing on something that matters, like Russian infiltration of @NRA or election security?

The arrest of Russian National Maria Butina shows at least two things:		1. The Russians used the @NRA to influence US elections. Some questions are did NRA officials know and what did the influence consist of?		2. Another FU to @realDonaldTrump by the US @TheJusticeDept. https://t.co/20rBHujhpA

In light of the charges against 12 GRU officers announced by Rod Rosenstein, @realDonaldTrump should cancel his meeting with Putin, who ordered the attack on the US. @POTUS shouldn't meet Putin until he accepts responsibility. And Trump should definitely not meet him alone. https://t.co/bP71DdGOHB

Another point that @realDonaldTrump doesn't appear to understand is that when Germany &amp; other European countries spend on their own defense, virtually all that spending is within the geographic territory of NATO. The US spends a bunch in the Pacific, which doesn't help NATO. https://t.co/cQlrAnrZV5
The more @realDonaldTrump talks about NATO, the clearer it becomes that he doesn't appear to understand how NATO works. It's an alliance, not some sort of bank account where all the countries put in their defense spending and then NATO cuts a check for the common defense. https://t.co/wd8JAr9fBL

This statement from @AEI further highlights the damage caused by the #GOPTaxScam. Democrats have #ABetterDeal for better jobs and wages. Also, we don't hurt charities. https://t.co/VyVMezyO6O

Today is #SummerSolstice. That means @EPAScottPruitt remains a national embarrassment. 		cc: @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/JMbfDNVKn5
I served with @GwenGraham in Congress. She stood up for key progressive values and we fought against the extreme House #GOP agenda. Now she’s running for governor to defend Florida from @RealDonaldTrump’s attacks. I’m proud to call her a friend and support her campaign.
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Nuclear option of family separation pushed by Stephen Miller &amp; John Kelly blew up in your face. You reversed, which made you look weak &amp; like a loser. It also humanized immigrants through visuals/audio. Do you still trust Miller &amp; Kelly?		#ThursdayThoughts https://t.co/qTfsFjDqwl
New @CNN poll confirms to me that Americans reject the #GOP agenda. They have seen their paychecks &amp; understand the #GOPTaxScam benefits the wealthy. They know their health care costs are rising due to sabotage of the health care laws by @realDonaldTrump. 		Dems have #ABetterDeal https://t.co/wXnVRb7A3U
Dear @SpeakerRyan: Can I use taxpayer funds to buy tactical polos &amp; tactical pants? I would also like to buy a door smashing device in case I take a nap &amp; staff have to smash the door.		Aw just kidding, I'm not an out of touch, creepy, corrupt swamp monster like @EPAScottPruitt. https://t.co/Bdwd2b6VsJ
I served on active duty as a JAG. The @realDonaldTrump policy of having JAGs prosecute immigration cases is STUPID. 		-JAGs are not trained in immigration law	-JAG Corps is always stretched thin	-JAGs main mission is to help commanders fight our wars, not prosecute misdemeanors. https://t.co/iDi5fMWo6v
Dear @SpoxDHS &amp; @SecNielsen: HHS official says there are no plans to reunite the 2,300 babies &amp; kids that you forcibly separated from their parents.		But you write about using airlines to "swiftly reunite" the children. Are you lying again? Or is HHS lying? https://t.co/hVefgypbCG
Trump retreats because his family separation policy was evil, and because of you. Your outrage &amp; activism beat @realDonaldTrump. 		But keeping 2,300 babies &amp; children separated from their parents continues to be evil. We need your activism to increase. 		Also, vote this November. https://t.co/gnk48hjmsx
In light of reports the National Enquirer has been subpoenaed, here is a letter @RepKathleenRice &amp; I sent earlier this year to the @FBI asking for an investigation.

Dear @SecNielsen &amp; @SpoxDHS: The #ExecutiveOrder by @realDonaldTrump reverses the Administration's family separation policy. Care to comment on your false statement below from a few days ago?		Also, when are you going to resign for lying repeatedly to the American people? https://t.co/BNqyZapqwd

Thank you United Airlines. @united https://t.co/LKfCjMXrJT
Dear @SecNielsen: You told the public there was no policy to separate children. Then you defended the policy. Then you said only Congress can change it.		Today's executive order by @realDonaldTrump shows you lied to the American people multiple times. You need to resign. https://t.co/CAOVJlhrFM
Thank you American Airlines. @AmericanAir https://t.co/Vh8fl36ktD
America was founded by people fleeing persecution. Today we honor #WorldRefugeeDay. 		But it is deeply disturbing the @realDonaldTrump Administration is ripping babies &amp; children away from mothers &amp; fathers. Today would be a good day for @POTUS to reverse his evil policy. https://t.co/puZX0bFDu1
Dear @FLOTUS: Your husband's policy of ripping babies away from parents is inconsistent with the #BeBest initiative you proudly announced. What are you going to do to stop tender age camps for babies? No one can take your initiative seriously until this evil policy is reversed. https://t.co/R5aohPA9DV
Interrupting this week's breaking news with a courtesy reminder that @EPAScottPruitt remains a national embarrassment. Even Republican lawmakers have finally noticed. They have drafted the Scott Pruitt rule on fountain pens. https://t.co/7Grr1hxcUT
Dear @SecNielsen: I previously served on active duty in the US military. America faces a lot of serious threats. But babies are not one of them. 		End your #BabyJails. Reverse your evil policy of ripping toddlers away from their mothers &amp; fathers. 		#WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/4WpPagoTEF
You can believe in any God, or no God, and conclude that ripping babies away from parents &amp; sticking them in #TenderAge institutions is morally wrong. 		I believe in Jesus Christ. The @realDonaldTrump policy of family separation goes against the Gospels &amp; everything Christ taught https://t.co/QkRNDyzSGL
Dear @SecNielsen: What procedures do you have in place to make sure babies are reunited with their mothers &amp; fathers at your so called Tender Age camps?		Also, why haven't you answered the basic questions about family separation that I &amp; others sent you over 18 days ago? https://t.co/SWoWmTgkGv
Extremists Corey Lewandowski, Stephen Miller &amp; @realDonaldTrump are now the face of the Republican party. But nature abhors a vacuum. Democrats don't just represent progressive values, we also represent the middle &amp; even the middle right because of how far the #GOP has shifted. https://t.co/nGJdApj06V
The fact that @realDonaldTrump met with House Republicans tonight--and not Democrats--highlights his lie that ripping kids from parents is being caused by the minority party. The #GOP controls the agenda. They control the House, Senate and White House. They own this evil policy. https://t.co/jTrMIV925F
Dear @SecNielsen: What procedures do you have in place to make sure children are reunited with their parents? Why won't you answer the simple questions in our letter that I and other Members of Congress sent you 18 days ago?		#keepfamiliestogether https://t.co/tVPtysm3lk

@djrothkopf Thank you! Also, it's better than being an abashed fan.
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Like your grandfather, my parents infested America. As their son with yellow skin, I now get to vote against your harmful policies. And after you leave due to either losing reelection or impeachment, I will still be here reversing your shit.		Cheers. https://t.co/vN4fJfp4h9
.@realDonaldTrump and @SecNielsen can lie all they want. But what Americans are seeing and hearing are images and audio that contradict their lies. 		So go ahead @POTUS, keep doubling down on your evil policy of ripping kids away from parents. I dare you. 		See you in November. https://t.co/DiBqNNKu0l
Why does the nonpartisan @CookPolitical keep moving congressional races in the direction of Democrats? Because the base for @realDonaldTrump is shrinking, independents are horrified, and Democrats are so fired up by inhumane policies like ripping kids away from parents. https://t.co/6fXQIxhDvD
Today is Tuesday. That means @realDonaldTrump is lying, again. 		Also the last time I checked, the Republicans control the House, Senate &amp; White House. But Dems do have something more important: public sentiment. And I agree with Lincoln that "public sentiment is everything." https://t.co/xUjs7DEet9
Dear Laura Ingraham: You stated detention centers are like "summer camps." Just curious, the summer camps you attended, did they sound like this? https://t.co/cHzcnLxsQi

This lie is the last straw. I join @KamalaHarris in calling on Secretary Nielsen to resign.

Nielsen needs to go. https://t.co/U4C3Jgz7rD
Dear @SecNielsen: I dare you to listen to this ProPublica audio tape from a US detention facility, and tell us again how you are treating kids well. Because there is nothing well about ripping kids from their parents. https://t.co/S1p6f4EmME

Earlier this month Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. @SecNielsen apparently backed out. 		I call on the GOP Chair @RepGoodlatte to subpoena her to testify about the @POTUS policy of separating #ImmigrantChildren from parents
Dear @SecNielsen: You have made contradictory statements about the @realDonaldTrump policy of ripping kids away from their parents. 		You can clarify your inconsistent statements about #ImmigrantChildren by answering the questions we asked you 17 days ago. What are you afraid of? https://t.co/0rFV9EUctb

Dear @SecNielsen: I don't give a shit if you apologize. We just need you to reverse your policy of ripping kids away from parents.

Dear @SecNielsen: You are lying. Period. 		How do we know you are lying Sec Nielsen? Because Stephen Miller pushed for the policy change &amp; AG Sessions gleefully announced it.

Why would Roger Stone fail to disclose this Russian meeting in his testimony to Congress? Same reason defendants don't tell the truth to investigators.		Because it's evidence of guilt. https://t.co/dx7gk0pyMe
@susiebuchanan66 @kathygriffin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan That's false. How do I know? Because there is no law that requires ripping children away from their parents. 		But go ahead and try to prove me wrong by citing me the mysterious law to which you refer. 		I'm waiting.
@biggiesnotdead @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Thank you for reading my tweets.
@DankaIdTrump @JeffTeKippe @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Thank you for reading my tweets. 		Also, look at my June 5 election result. It's really good. I will get reelected regardless of my views on family separation.
@rockusc 43 Dem Senators introduced a bill to reverse the family separation policy. Not a single Republican signed onto it. The GOP controls the House, Senate and White House. This is not an issue where Dems haven't tried. This is an issue of Republican allegiance to Trump.
@DankaIdTrump @realmwqueen @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Can Paul Manafort make a legal asylum application? Get the difference?
@Dean_Moriarty36 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Based on the recent data, most meet the standards to make a legal asylum application.
@chbstone2 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Without knowing the individual cases, you wouldn't know if they meet the standards for legal asylum. Most do based on recent statistics. 		Asylum 101		Rule of Law
@JeffTeKippe @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Thank you for reading my tweets. Oh, ripping children away from their parents is political. @realDonaldTrump is using the children to make demands. 		Pathetic.
Happy early #FathersDay to those who didn't have our kids ripped away from us by the new @realDonaldTrump family separation policy that is being enabled by @SpeakerRyan. https://t.co/g52tqMrDmI
@Scaramucci @POTUS Your first sentence is correct. Your second sentence is intentionally misleading. @realDonaldTrump could reverse his new policy of family separation tomorrow. There is no current law that mandates ripping children away from their parents.
Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform.

Call me at 202 225 3976. Let's reform bail. https://t.co/mxVAsJ5qRj
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Last time I checked, Stephen Miller is not a Democrat. Ripping children away from their parents is YOUR ADMINISTRATION'S REPUBLICAN POLICY. 		Your new policy is evil. Reverse it now. https://t.co/8VkXSBzhIE
The only thing more unconscionable than the @realDonaldTrump policy of ripping children away from their parents is @POTUS using those kids as hostages to make demands.		Does this make your blood boil?		If so, vote this November. https://t.co/Q2X39d46Rt
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Um, what elections are you talking about? Since your relatively small inauguration, DEMS WON:		-Alabama Senate	-Western PA Congressional District	-VA Gov	-NJ Gov	-Over 40 state legislative districts, flipping them from red to blue 		#SaturdayMorning Facts https://t.co/8revVD5sdS
As predicted, the #GOPTaxScam benefits the top 1%, not regular Americans. The GOP agenda has not helped the middle class, and many people will soon see their health insurance premiums spike because of GOP sabotage. 		Democrats have #ABetterDeal. 		Vote this November. https://t.co/13ARRx3AIa
@tnaka83 @Harvard Thank you for your tweet. Supreme Court has held that race can be a factor in admissions.		However, what Harvard appears to have done is attribute personality traits based on race. That is indefensible. 		Also, I don't care who brings a lawsuit. I care what the evidence shows.
The behavior of @realDonaldTrump is beyond not normal. It is pathological. https://t.co/iGYxLx9hvp

There was a lot of breaking news today, but let's not forget @EPAScottPruitt remains a national embarrassment. 		Also, since @SpeakerRyan says he is totally clueless about Scott Pruitt (or Ryan is just lying), I'm going to tag him on every Pruitt tweet I do. You should too. https://t.co/qyxtjyvkZQ
My #FridayFeeling is that the Mueller probe just got longer. I wouldn't be surprised if prosecutors &amp; federal agents now investigate whether @realDonaldTrump and Rudy Giuliani are trying to dangle pardons to Paul Manafort &amp; other witnesses. https://t.co/t4erhHljfx
You know how we know @realDonaldTrump, @PressSec, and @WhiteHouse are LYING about family separation? Because even now they still can't point to a Democratic bill or law that requires ripping children away from parents.		Also @nytimes, the proper word to use here is LYING. https://t.co/6zNPxBaJs0

You know who else dangled pardons?		RICHARD NIXON https://t.co/CzX1uDzTn5
@derekahunter @CNN Feel free to call me names because I'm cool like that. But I watched the video of what Trump said. There was no reference to his staff.
How do we know @realDonaldTrump is losing on his policy of ripping children away from parents? Because @POTUS bizarrely tries to blame Dems for Jeff Sessions' new policy. Dems also don't control agenda. 		GOP controls the House, Senate &amp; White House. They own this &amp; they know it. https://t.co/roxMgXbbxX
Less than two years ago, Paul Manafort helped orchestrate @realDonaldTrump campaign events where Trump's base chanted "Lock Her Up."		Now Manafort sits in jail and #LockHimUp is trending. 		Life comes at you fast. https://t.co/8vVp37iN9M
@AndrewCFollett @DonnyFerguson @Harvard Hope springs eternal
Dear @realDonaldTrump: Yes, witness tampering by Paul Manafort carries with it a tough sentence. That's why you should avoid doing so. For example, dangling pardons would be considered witness tampering, and pardoning witnesses against you would constitute obstruction of justice. https://t.co/gNoLaBXS9A
"Lawmaker: It's Friday. That means Trump is lying" @CNNPolitics https://t.co/QX6op5uUge
Today @realDonaldTrump threw Paul Manafort under the bus again. Manafort basically has two choices. (1) Sit in jail, fight prosecutors, lose at trial, and spend the rest of his life in prison. Or (2) he can cooperate, and spend part of his life in prison. https://t.co/jcjdbe3ycz
@FrankelJeremy Hope springs eternal
The Supreme Court has held race can be used as a factor in admissions. But what @Harvard appears to have done is attribute personality traits based on race. That is what is outrageous, because it feeds into historical damaging stereotypes about Asian-Americans. https://t.co/sHPut2Kd9T
@Heminator Hope springs eternal
How do we know @Harvard is lying about its racist admissions policies against Asian-Americans? Because it won't release its own internal reviews from 2013 showing discrimination.		Release the information Harvard. What are you hiding? 		Oh, and do you like my personality traits? https://t.co/LSgHBMl5Bh
Dear @Harvard: Your admissions policies against Asian-Americans are racist. Take your "personality trait" crap and shove it. How's that for "courage."		Also, you need to apologize. https://t.co/WQXWAlYQ6E
Finally there is recognition that the @FBI is not some deep state, liberal faction.
