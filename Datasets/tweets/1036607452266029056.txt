Senate blocks bill on medical care for children born alive after attempted abortion https://t.co/e9bOdoHVuz
@Trump454545 doesn't look like she's hurting for money.. just saying
@AOC This is what you get with the me, me, me crowd. Do what I want or I am going to throw a tantrum, You forget you work for the people, maybe you should take your place and do your job instead of trying to dictate to us, plus folks this is what socialism / communism looks like
@KamalaHarris Don't forget to tell people that medicare doesn't pay for everything 100%, You need to have supplement insurance to pay for things like drugs, eyes, ears and more.. oh yeah you don't people know that right? plus look how the va is working.. hasn't that's why they can see prv drs
@RodyleCockroach @RobinJackGreen @BernieSanders So are you going to go after the illegal guns in the hands of criminals? I bet your not, but instead going after the 2nd amendment. After all Bernie can't control people if they have guns.
@AnnCoulter So Ann, you are a flip flopper, the very talent that the rino's have, pretend to be a true American until something you doubt with out faith, and then try to turn others against him.. Hell no we see right through you
@dbongino They need to destroy everything that allows people to live and make their own decisions, if all big companies are destroyed people will be force to live off the government and depend on them to survive.
@KamalaHarris Will you be going on Medicare too and the rest of the public servants? After all either you go on it, or we go on what you guys have, after all your no better than we are! I bet if you all had the same healthcare your tune would be different

@HankStormdrain @markcubsfan @philthatremains @jglennedwards @AOC I don't know where you get your info it's been published all over the place until AOC started her climate control crap
@markcubsfan @HankStormdrain @philthatremains @jglennedwards @AOC have you heard that a person who quite smoking 20 years earlier still got the cancer? it's true! also this country emmission is way down compared to the rest of the world. keep listening to the talking heads
@HankStormdrain @Kenchan07157727 @gaussian_dude @AOC keep leting the illegals in and disappear into the country as they carry those thrid world diseases. This is more than drugs, and trafficking, but our health issues as well
@dixieQdog @davey1233 @AOC more things in the environment to cause more cancer, this is a population control more than energy control. Next they'll tell everyone power can only be used during certain times depending on the area
@SenGillibrand no friggin way! you and other dems = death to this country
@MichaelJohnso03 @madabouttheboro @FoxNewsIe not fake was reported on this morning, try looking at different channels to get a more rounded news reporting.. we know the dem channels won't report all the facts
@FoxNewsIe These dems are creating a world of violence which will lead to bring back abuse on a woman down the road, does this sound like heading to the Islamic way? where women do as told by the man.
@SenWarren @RepAOC @SenMarkey This woman announced her candidacy in a city in MA yesterday where it's a sanctuary city, enough drugs in it to kill a state, and criminals run rampant, along with most of the people who live there live in poverty and are Hispanic origins. This is where the country is heading
@JKCorden She doesn't even know that she just exposed the workings of the deep state.. watch out, they maybe	 coming after you.
@KamalaHarris why aren't you &amp; the others work on getting illegal guns off the streets and out of hands of criminals, yet no one even thinks about or talk about it, so go after legal citizens and leave the criminals alone the democratic way.. do nothing for citizens and everything 4 illegals
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Hey Chuck instead of spending all the taxpayer's money on crap that you have been pulling the last two years, how about we take the money and send the children back to the countries they came from to their Consulates and let the parents pick them up there!

@IngrahamAngle Their message is jobs, wages, etc, but their actions are no jobs, dependent on the government for handouts. Big Government, more taxes until we all live in the slum, and even then it wouldn't be enough for socialist agendas
@conservmillen That was priceless, I thought for a minute he was going to either cry or stand up and throw a tantrum.
@realDailyWire They didn't stand or clap for anything until it was about them, me, me, me
@KamalaHarris how about treating the cause instead of just the symptoms for once? it's clear that drugs flood this country everyday and the ones who aren't caught are killing our people. Much like medical field treat the symptoms not the cause. Can you see beyond your never trumper thing
@KamalaHarris Just a reminder the gov was closed because of dems, they went on vacation as people stayed behind and worked. you don't do the job required to get this country on track, instead it's a campaign slogan for you
@KamalaHarris The fact is and it was very clear you are for open borders, putting Americans and legal immigrants lives endanger for what, a win! To stop Trump? you are a hater and we have had enough hate! we want peace and resolutions for this country not people who have no say or legal rights
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump now-now Ann he was talking to all Americans including Dems who's vocabulary is small, who twist the real meanings, so they had to choose words that everyone could understand. Come on Stop with the two sides of Ann, either your with him or your not.
@KamalaHarris you call yourself a professional and yet your face said everything else, it looked like you were ready to take your ball home! your vision for this country is a very dangerous one for everyone except for the upper class who can take their ball somewhere else if needed

@KamalaHarris That's great that she did that! But what did you do to help the ones during the freeze?
@A_Smart_Liberal @CoryBooker I don't think people want to go back to high taxes, or taxing everything you can think of, pitting people against each other, high unemployment, or back on the government dole as they dictate how much a person will make, where they will live, and foods they can buy and eat.
@CoryBooker I was wondering when color would come into it, and it was a second. So you think that just because your skin is a different color than mine you will automatically get the vote... not.... been there, done that, and not doing it again.. I'm voting Trump
@beewielder @Varuka1982 bingo...
@BernieSanders Are you willing to live by the same laws that you're trying to enact in this country? I don't believe anyone who makes the money that you guys make will contribute base on your income, but instead find exemptions.. maybe we lead so we don't count!
@BernieSanders yeah Bernie, we'll just replace the high prices of medical with high taxes of the democrats. so who wins, not the people!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump so why aren't you taking your own advice and walk the walk! you voted for the wall during the last three previous presidents, and now you won't?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Who makes your clothes, are they American made? I think not.
@Patrici15767099 she like other rino's are waiting to see who's going to grease their palms, to vote for or against before they make up their minds, instead of who's going to do the best job for the country! At this point it's crystal clear it's Trump.. dems will kill this country
@ewarren how do you think solar power would be helping anyone today or this week even when the sun is behind clouds... oh it doesn't! you still would have to hook up or you would freeze today! wind farms might work, but Liz what happen to the wind farms in mass making a difference? not
@JDugudichi Respect our elderly even if you don't like them
@KamalaHarris I don't want what you have to sell~ division, socialism, no border security! What do you think a drone and photos are going to stop people from crossing the border? you must think we're really stupid people
@biject who are you kidding? even one vote matters and it does influence the election, why else would it matter to the dems? it starts with a few and no one cares, it doesn't impact soon it's 11 million, because no one stood up when it first happens. now it impacts &amp; nothing can be done
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Well, Chuck, if you and Nancy didn't play the political game it would have been far less, and President Trump could have the funding too and still saved money.. but that's what dems do spend, spend, the complain
People you do realize illegals vote in our elections right? when handed drivers licenses give them the right, since that is what they use to verify address, who you are, as well as assumed that you're a citizen. This is what CA does and Texas has the same problem
@AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews She's a rino, she pretends to be republican, but given the opportunity to take false info and spread it around I bet she would just like daddy did.
@drinkingInc @AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews interjecting another view point doesn't mean blocking, after all the lunitic left don't even talk about reality, they have lawyers and actresses and comedians, how much do you really think they know on their own.. they have people tell them their talking points.
@LisaMei62 @BreitbartNews he's a rino through and through, he pretends to be a true republican until Trump wants to do something that his pocket lining income will be lost
@SteveDoublin @ewarren @EPAAWheeler Yeah and you have to read between the lines to know what she is really going to do, just like Hillary except not so elegantly spoken
@JimHyatt @ewarren @EPAAWheeler So what happens when the wind doesn't blow? or if the sun doesn't shine for several days? Then What brainy ack? I had solar in MA and there are not many sunny days in the winter, so how will you keep the lights on and the heat for those that heat by electricity.

@jsean64 @ewarren If you're a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire tax year, you generally aren't required to file a U.S. federal income tax return if your only income is from sources within Puerto Rico.Feb 28, 2018
@weehandchumpy @ewarren she's only pretending to care, she wants the votes that's it, then she will ignore them as she does her own state.
@ewarren Oh yeah LIzzy, now your worried about Porto Rico, but you can't even take care of your own state, but hey raising taxes fixes everything now doesn't it? you spend more time else where instead of taking care of the people of MA.
@CathyAnnOfen @jakedgoode @ewarren let's not pretend that there is profit margins all the way to the manufacturer, no one is going to build or make anything if they can't make a living off it too.. they don't get paid like the average worker, they get paid from profits. but of course your against that right?
@ewarren don't be fooled, she will go all the way down to the middle class, she represents MA and their about to raise taxes again even though the pot income is in the billions in tax revenue. She is greedy, and she and others will get all their shelters, off shore accts, loopholes
@JoyVBehar @AnnCoulter Joy, who cares what your narrow, old hag has to say, your one sick lady based on your past comments and you call yourself American.  talk about no facts, just bias crap
@AnnCoulter oh so there is a set back and your ready to pounce and turn, well that speaks loudly about your position. how do you know if this isn't about getting ready for something else that will be more powerful than this?
@KamalaHarris she about the people, not you people! she's about illegals, just look at her state, and not to mention she will have you jailed before facts, before proven guilty without a doubt, don't believe me look what she did at the judicial nomination, ready to destroy w/o proof
@ewarren so what you have done in this case, oh wait you would had given everything the other side wanted just to keep the government open? I doubt it. because we all know what you say and what you do are two different things.
@KamalaHarris come on Kamala stop spinning it, Yes he's out on bail, he bonded out, the people your talking about that sit in jail because they can't pay their bail usually because you have to pay the bail not the bond.. MA you pay the bail, Fl you pay the bond.
@cubsb4bears @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That's the problem what about securing our borders? yeah nothing for that thou right?
@AOC @RELEVANT Did god tell the people of the earth to give all they're money and power to the greedy people in the world as they parade their riches in front of those who lost everything because of these people who refuse to work with each other to figure out the best way instead of greed?
@AndrewGillum you like other democrats would give an adult a pass for there hateful words and actions and dump all over kids, why because they wore a red hat! this is getting old and immature which is what the dems have become immature brats that had they're binkies taken away.
@rdwest1 @SarahPalinUSA let's not forget all the flights to the late night shows, the campaigning for hillary and trips to cuba and watch a game while the country was hurting.. but yeah he's great spending our money and your mouth stayed shut.. don't forget Trump doesn't take a paycheck, obama did
@SarahPalinUSA this women is what the real democrats are about, and why they constantly needs to keep raising taxes, so we can keep paying for the exorbitant spending for themselves and family and the hell with the rest of us.. wake up soon you'll only work for them while we live in poverty
@KamalaHarris So the ones following you believe you will do good, however do they realize that your willing to destroy a person for political gains regardless if there is solid evidence or not! you pass actions in CA and in Washington already tells what kind of president you would be scary!
@KamalaHarris no way! your record and your actions speaks volumes. your about being guilty before proven innocent, your willing to destroy reputations for political gains, your willing to allow everyone and anyone regardless of dangers into this country.. no way will you get my vote.
How is it Democrats feel like Trump is holding the country hostage when they refuse to come to the table? They're the ones who are demanding the government to be reopen then talk, when we all know dam well there is no intention to do so~ Also when did Nancy run the country?
@TinaDuryea @KamalaHarris For the people? which people? certainly isn't American people! she's all about illegals and has demonstrated as so. she couldn't even bother show respect to the fallen officer in her state
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump caalWhy don't you just admit it, you and nancy aren't the ones in charge, your the ones that are kissing the radicals lefts shoes all to keep your jobs. Your afraid they will strip you of your power. sad to be you guys, work and being afraid.. the corner you have back yourself in
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump been there done that, you guys have done that with other presidents and when they give in, you guys never return to the table to solve the problem. If you had this would be the problem now. How dumb dems think everyone is and how forgetful your party is.
@BerniesTeachers @erynCA @BernieSanders yup good idea until everyone get's medicare, then what? Since Social Security and medicare are tied together, they'll just take that so call extra and give it away to all those who never worked, like illegals that don't pay taxes through payroll unless they're using false ID's
@LisaMei62 They thought they could bully Trump and get what they want like they did with bush' s and other republican presidents who coward to them. But they hadn't learn Trump learned from them when he use to be invited to all their democratic games. he was on the inside one time.
@mauro_sondra @LisaMei62 your right, Trump should had taken them to the nearest prison to complete the trip
@ChuckCallesto This was like the protesters hunting down senators during the justice nominations. gang mentality. it's all in a matter of time before she's brought to her senses and reality hits her in the face
@trendchasernews you know what this say's to me, get ready to lose everything and the only thing you'll be able to afford, because once they raise all the taxes, this will be the new wealthy status
I think these are also their whistle calls, if you think about it, things ramp up when one of them start using one of these words. https://t.co/4HANNA0hgT
has anyone else notice that all the democrats say the exact same thing no matter what show they appear on? Does any of them have a brain of their own? and when they argue their points they stay within those same points, even if the topic has changed.
@KamalaHarris Kamala would you care to explain to all your followers how crimes and illegal entries have decreased in CA? while you keep playing the blame game. I dare you to come out and tell us exactly why illegals take priority over the American people in this country? do you have fence?
@BernieSanders you mean like you did Bernie when Hillary bought your A$$ and you went and bought yourself another house and a very expensive car.
@MattBatzel Oh so sorry democrats, you have to stay and do your jobs! Good for President Trump, if they can't fund the wall because of no money, how can they fund a trip on our tax dollars.. love it.. payback is a b3tch
@seanspicer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @VP Anyone who interrupts should be escorted out of the building just like Obama did
@SenWarren @senatemajldr we know your were you stand, you would rather have planned parenthood keep getting funds to kill defenseless children who cannot protect themselves.
What I have noticed that is most of the politicians on both sides are lawyers, so they know where all the loop holes are, were they can stick to us and have the loop holes to bail themselves out. Then pretend they care and they're going to fix it.  really heard this before
@KamalaHarris All of these dems are proposing raising taxes to 70%, plus adding additional taxes for this crap. .before you know it, they will own everything you make. think about that for a minute
@KamalaHarris you know as others that we have declined our emissions, while other countries have increase theirs.. this is just a ploy to get more tax money.. who are you kidding?
@BernieSanders What are you talking about? people live outside of their means, spend money they don't have, instead of saving even 5 dollars a pay period they would rather have that expensive tattoo, most expensive cell phone, or gamble, or drink and even drug it away.. so let's not play games
@AOC @FoxNews yet go straight to name calling and putting out assumptions as facts. This country is in bad shape if people like you run this country. Deep state is loving you because they're going to get a lot pass you guys.
@AOC @FoxNews Fox news said that you guys walked right by the area he was in, so not knowing all the facts makes you look like a liar!  it appears to me that you guys need to stop acting like activist on a witch hunt and learn where everyone's offices are located.

@twhiting9275 @ChuckCallesto agree, the liberals want it so that hopefully they get a bigger democratic congressional seat for each state. Since they're out registering them almost daily as democrats. I did hear once that a person wanted to be registered as a republican and they entered him as democrat.
@JonathanStrouse @ImMrsWeaver @ChuckCallesto By them not asking about citizenship allows them to count illegals as well as legal immigrants, giving them a greater number of congressional seats. see the irony here! I don't care if you or anyone else knows I am a citizen, therefore how is it protecting me?
@AOC How about your co democrat who showed foul behavior after being sworn in. What's good for one is good for all, both sides.. Unless your for gang mentality and dems are exempt from all behavior
@darquis @Ted_Conti @AOC If you think she won't be raising your taxes think again, they are going after everyone's except the ones that never pay.. but everyone else pays for them and the loop holes of the rich, if you think they're willing to pay more taxes then you must not have paid taxes much
@GalaxyTomm @Ted_Conti @AOC of course I do, I paid salaries not just received it. Most likely she has received something, after all she's not the first person with limited income go to washington dc. Many have said they slept in their office on a cot.. so there are alternatives.. we all can't live rich
@darquis @Ted_Conti @AOC Playing the pity game so you'll feel bad for her, maybe donate some money, one problem is she's willing to raise your taxes and doesn't care if it will allow you to pay for your rent down the road.. beware... be very aware.
If everything is so good, and dems don't feel that it's that big of a problem then why did the state post this? Oh yeah they want us to believe that it happens at airports, which should be detected, over the sea which is were coast gaurds catch them, but don't care about land https://t.co/9LMPl45zkG
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why are you being stubborn and refusing to give the people in this county the funding? Oh yeah, need illegals in states to get more reps hopefully dems. Since censors don't ask if the person is a citizen or not, flaws the data. higher it's population = more senators
@ewarren Warren why are you telling people the truth? you and other dems need illegals in this country in order to get more rep in the states, your hope is dems, thus future votes. Since censors doesn't ask if the person is a citizens or not the facts for this purpose is flawed at best.

@deleted12_31_18 Actually your the one spreading misinformation, ,because your heart strings have been tugged, again funds they spent could had been donated right from Washington and proceeded to work on the gov.. like you said they're citizens of America too.

@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Why aren't you in Washington doing your job to help end it, no your too busy campaigning and trying to make it look like it's Trump who's not negotiating, when all of you guys left Thursday afternoon. can't even spend a full week in Washington to get anything done &amp; you complain
@AdamOberhausen @GHOSTIN31234211 @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Because he wants the democrats to do their jobs, since if Trump declares the emergency then the dems can blame him, investigate him, and so on, but if the dems keep refusing to negotiate then it is and will become more the dems fault.

When taxpayers a footing wages for public officials that were voted into office and they take the taxpayers money and spend it on a witch hunt without facts. you and i could end up being prosecuted base on heresay
@AdamOberhausen @MochaLBJ @ewarren @realDonaldTrump I am an independent, you have to prove with hard facts to make me change my mind! All I see is dems avoiding questions, and twisting things around, look at the last nominee for the supreme court. willing to condemn without facts.. scary for all Americans. prosecuted by public
@AdamOberhausen @MochaLBJ @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Let's see it's been two years still nothing by the mueller investigation, although there have been arrest and sentencing, those people did there own deeds, lying etc. Still nothing with Trump. I use to like dems until Obama and hillary lied about Benghazi, liberals out of touch
@KamalaHarris How high is your wall around your house Kamala, Why aren't you in Washington if your so worry about these people? Oh yeah got to do the book tour, and then run for president. your the vanity one
@freezeframepeo @enviseon @ewarren @realDonaldTrump The ones pushing it will never be effected by it like everyone else who is paying higher cost of everything so these people can live free. They're is no incentive for them or anyone else to assimilate into the country. Surprise though cause drugs kills no discrimination, or money
@AdamOberhausen @MochaLBJ @ewarren @realDonaldTrump You are the one that is ill informed and your opinion is exactly the talking points of all the dems.. I am surprised you did say the whistle call "manufactured"
@AdamOberhausen @MochaLBJ @ewarren @realDonaldTrump First of all I am not a dude, second of all that bill was purposely crafted in order for the last congress and senate could say they did their job, but it was at the discretion of nancy and chuck. When asked nancy said even if passed 30 days would still be no $ for the wall.
@AdamSchiff Oh Adam, hope there is nothing hiding in your closet! because your a resistance and your only goal is to get Trump.. very clear that you have and continue to be a resistant.
@ouchinagirl @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Nancy is a poor excuse of a human being! anyone who refuses the safety of the citizens against people who come here with guns, drugs, sex trafficking, running from their own government because of the crimes they committed there. So what makes you think that they won't here?
@ouchinagirl @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Nancy doesn't have to worry about her family being hurt by the illegals, because she has a wall around her house, and she's not going hungry because of the shut down, nor will she lose her house or car. This doesn't effect her in any way shape or form.. yet she's immoral
@MochaLBJ @ewarren @realDonaldTrump you listen to much to mass media who fails to tell you that for wall to be funded needed 60 votes 10 which was needed by dems. because dems are nothing but resisting anything trump is why were in the mess now.. go blame the real problem dems = resist
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump you got your paycheck! why are you back in ma and not in washington doing your job to end the shut down? oh yeah because it's the dems who are keeping it going! dems have brought nothing new to the table and have no intention to do so
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump Are you looking for a civil war? It sounds like that to me, and that is what our electrics have become? believe I won't be protecting your democratic greedy ass

@vingreensill @MattSmeeks @KamalaHarris It's not missing the compassion, they haven't told these people or haven't told us that they can take their last paystub to the bank and they will lend them the money until they get paid, oops forget to let people know that right? or can open unemployment claims
@KamalaHarris Funny this happens everyday to alot of people and I don't see you guys trying to move heaven and earth to get them the help they need. But it now effects your voting base so your denouncing this! Why aren't you in Washington do the work instead of being home? you really care NOT
@KamalaHarris We all know your not telling the whole story, you forgot to mention that these people can take their paystub to the bank and they will give them the money until they get paid.. also others will be able to open unemployment claims.. stop lying
@SenWarren donate your pay, since your back in Ma instead of staying and doing the business to get the government open.. your not serious unless your there to do the work.. but then again all talk no action... typical democrat
@KamalaHarris Got no where with Trump now your going after another person, just like democrats trying to bully their way to what they want instead of working with everyone who's involved. negotiation is the word
@KamalaHarris And he should had, it did nothing for the security of this country, but plenty of funding for foreign countries though! explain that one
@ewarren so when will you be leaving?
@RepRashida and your so worry about the workers not getting paid and yet you went home on Thursday afternoon.! so you don't care, just pretend you do
@marcorubio Here comes the turn coats, instead of working to resolve the problem, you Instead do what you did before? turn and go against the safety for this nation. you didn't get my vote in 2016 because of this make believe you care, and you won't get my vote when it's time in florida
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews couldn't beat Obama when pushed, he'll crumble for sure when Trump gets going~
Laws only apply to the little people while these people who just got elected have already found away to skirt around it.  What's different this time is there are more people watching and opening their mouths of what is really going on! Scamming from the get go.. sad https://t.co/BLfzcpxTHF
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews Just change your party affiliation already! you act more and think more like a progressive democrat than a conservative republican, or even a moderate republican. You flip and flop like a fish out of water, your an embarrassment to our country

You guys are more concern with foreign affairs than you are your own people in this country.. see it more and more everyday
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Right Schumer we should never have to worry about what we feed our children, but we have to because of the laws that dems passed during obama years to modify and generically change how food is grown, along with allowing hormones and antibiotics to be injected into cattle

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump whistle calling Chuck, your new phrase since last week. Liberals respond to this, that's why they keep changing the phrases, when it doesn't work

Except this time the puppet master left the building, so only their mouths worked. They barely even blinked.
@darhar981 Government employees can collect unemployment. I am sure the reason we don't hear all 800,000 workers complain or take to the streets in protest is because they can open up unemployment claims. Unless they're illegals working in our government! https://t.co/bPEzxbF1CK
Liberals whistle call of the week ~ Manufactured
@AOC @DailyCaller well if you never wanted to be seen then you should had never had it taken. and no wonder you guys are always playing the victim.. how do you know it's a conservative, why can't it be a fellow liberal who just doesn't like you? where is your proof.. oh there you go allegations
@KamalaHarris Make sure they'll back up those false allegations just in case Kamala needs them when she and the others manufacture the victim again
@KamalaHarris you guys are something else, manufactured, vanity, useless any other names you can give the denial of sitting down and do the peoples business
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump stop with the lies, you guys went there hoping he would give you want you want, but when he asked if you would give him the national security with funding for the wall you and nancy said NO! your suppose to work for the people not the NWO and illegals traitor!!!
@flowers4may2 @SenWarren Americans killing Americans is tragic enough, but having illegals fleeing here from other countries after committing murder there and then come here and kill again is not just tragic it's wrong, if they couldn't just walk across the dessert the victims would be alive
@RealSaavedra when does this women actually do any work? we're paying a wage to do the people's business not lecture us on false facts that she believes is true. If they continue to spend more time on tv then they need to not be paid for their time at the congress.
@BernieSanders @UTLAnow how are you going to do that bernie, since your for open borders, which translates into larger classrooms, language barriers which slow down other students from advancing, and they get free schooling while taxpayers keep on shoveling out the cash
@AdamSchiff Chuck and Nancy are the ones holding this country hostage and since you go with everything they say and do regardless if it's right or not, your just as guilty.. This is about American safety and not about politics..
@scotty752 @marklevinshow taxpayers of course
@marklevinshow She is not about making this country better, stronger, she's about being a star..
@BreitbartNews Democrats aren't about America they're about their own agenda and that's not American. They need to destroy the middle class, and allowing just anyone in the country accomplish just that.. wages are driven down, they work for little money and companies start paying little cash..
@marklevinshow The saddest part of the media spreading false information, opinions as facts will and has caused so much problems and ruined lives. The people won't wake up until it effects them.. when it does they will move mountains to do what they know is true. Politicians=no backbone, Kiss A
@Jerrykalin1 @marklevinshow no they didn't otherwise they would had pointed out that you can keep your doctor and your plan.. when people got kicked of employers insurance forced to pay high deductibles and insurance cost.. yeah they fact check him... not.. I know because the co I worked for did it.
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Donate your wages then if your so concern, but somehow I doubt you will, but instead you will stand with the resistance while you and others hurt those working people.. you could pass for them to get unemployment..
@FaroeNik @BlissTabitha @DNC There still is the agenda 31, when all countries are suppose to rid themselves of the middle class. No country can enter if there is a middle class, that's why they want to destroy it with their new socialist programs that would effect as always the middle class.

@AmyTagliareni @KamalaHarris so, economics woes are because business are hiring illegals and they too are breaking laws.. the old saying is two wrongs don't make a right.. why is it they can break all kind of laws and congress mostly dems and some republicans look the other way.. why their pockets get lined.
@SenWarren https://t.co/nHVYxJEGYV  Source from where these facts are found for all those who think Trump is making things up.
@SenWarren So Elizabeth do you want to continue with the lies? Do you want to keep pretending that your state is safe and no one is being hurt by the sancuarty cities and state that it has become. your playing to the people who don't know you, but I do! You have caused more harm to Citizens
@SenWarren In Dorchester, Massachusetts, a 40 year old national of the Dominican Republic with convictions for cocaine trafficking and money laundering was arrested.
@SenWarren In Hyannis, Massachusetts, a 41-year old Jamaican national convicted of possession of 28-100 grams of cocaine was arrested
@SenWarren In Windham, New Hampshire, a 44 year old national of Brazil wanted in Brazil for smuggling/embezzlement of firearms who had assumed the identity of a U.S. citizen, was arrested.
@SenWarren In Brockton, Mass, a 41-year old national of France w previous convictions for cocaine possession,multiple instances of assault and battery, history includes 30 adult arrangements, kidnapping, assault and battery with a deadly weapon, domestic violence and other felony charges.
@SenWarren In Methuen, Massachusetts, a 23- year old national of the Dominican Republic who had assumed the identity of a U.S. citizen with prior convictions for drug trafficking, identity theft, and resisting arrest, who is facing current pending drug trafficking charges.
@SenWarren In Putnam, Connecticut, a 59-year old national of Brazil who is wanted for murder in Brazil, a crime alleged to have been committed by casting a net over the victim and stabbing the victim 20 times, was arrested.
@SenWarren Really Elizabeth, have you forgotten In Lynn, Massachusetts, a 67 year-old national of Brazil who is wanted in Brazil for aggravated murder was arrested.
@RedPillReport @FoxNews he has changed, he swings with the majority.. republicans held congress he was pro Trump, now dems control and he's now pro dems.. he has lost all creditably	 in my eyes
@AmyTagliareni @KamalaHarris actually you can do your own research but you must be willing to go pass the first 5 pages of google. also Q makes more sense depending on the real or the fake Q oh yeah sounds like dems who tell half truths or change the narrative all together..
@AOC @maddow are you combining the two? illegals and legals? legals pay taxes not just at the sales counter but through paychecks! illegals work under the table, and pay no taxes, and neither does the company they work for! America gets screwed why not fix the problem?
@AmyTagliareni @KamalaHarris actually it's reported daily that funds have been set aside since 2006, only some of the funds were actually used.. if you really listen to what is said and said by the current democrat congress you will see it's true..
@RealSaavedra Why don't you guys ask the tough questions? like this https://t.co/aFvY6YBrDm
@KamalaHarris What about this Democrats? https://t.co/hM6rZmA8I2
So democrats were is the remaining money on this? Care to explain! or did you guys just pocket the money since you think no one is watching! https://t.co/9DMVZe8axm
@catturd2 how are they going to respond when they don't know what he is going to say! doesn't matter though, he could tell them they win, and they would be all piss off and give it to him just so they can say they didn't give in! lol idiots
@SenFeinstein you people aren't even trying anymore to at least to pretend to care about the citizens of this country, however you actions speak louder than your words, since you approved for billions to go overseas and nothing for the people here..
So dems and others think the wall is immoral, and all the states and cities that are sancuary that believe breaking laws is a good think unless your American should have walls built around them.. keeping them in and the rest of us safe
@GOP have any of you even bother to ask yourself if border walls, fence etc is so immoral then why does everyone of these politicians who oppose it have walls or fences surrounding their homes? to keep people out especially anyone who could be seen as dangerous! brainwashed to no end
@GOP people should not be allowed to cross into this country illegally, ayslum can be granted within they're own country.. you all are being played if you even for one second think that it's ok. what about the ones who come here legally, shouldn't they get citizenship first? then visa
RT @dbongino: BREAKING:	Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya, with deep connections to the team hired by Hillary Clinton to set up the Trump team,…
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump All candidates should be funding their own campaigning until the nomination, then it should be made public of all donations and should be a very low ceiling for donations from each person. Elizabeth has accepted lobbyist money, again talking out the side of her mouth... liar
@SenFeinstein your wrong, because even if one illegal crosses the border and is allow to be absorbed into the country without penalties lay's on the governments back, since it's been over 30 years without a comprehensive immigration law being placed and enforces. up to this point its' bandages
This country needs a do over, a restart, everyone of these people who are against our country our people should be made to vacate their office. They're not doing the people's work, they're working on making themselves wealthy while other get poorer..
@AOC Actually no one has missed a paycheck, in fact it was reported today that they will get their pay today! oh yeah let's pretend it's worse than it is and our president doesn't have any knowledge yet what have you created except to try to steal more money from the middle class
Let's have a social media protest! Post everywhere you can!		We support our president, our national security and our borders with a wall and along with any devices that support the security of the wall and those who protect the borders.
@SenWarren Work with our president then and get the wall funded for the amount needed. you who say you understand how corp work would know down payments are always needed to start a job. stop with the lies, and you want to be president.. we remember your actions when the time comes
@SenWarren let them collect unemployment, that's what you tell us when we lose our jobs and collect our last paychecks. we have to dip into savings, if any, otherwise we hope the landlord and collectors wait until we get our first chk, sometimes 4 - 6 wks, no out cry from you then..
I just saw something I totally had forgotten, remember the 2016 DNC convention when democrats had a 8 foot fence put up around it, to keep conservatives out! and of course any riots that might happen when they found out bernie sold out to hillary. so ok for that but not security
@luv2birdie @sandyyates @marcorubio must have been and continue to drink the cool aide the democrats and mass media continues to feed it's followers.. you must had been one who feared coloring outside of the lines and now your afraid to stand up to a group of people who think laws are for everyone else except dems
@ChuckCallesto he goes on to say all the crimes this president has committed! have you noticed that they never back it up with naming the crimes! to the one who say's he can't negotiate, then explain how it is manufacturing jobs returned after obama asked were is the magic wand? obama didn't
@theCorey I agree, if the dems are so set on not allowing nation security work to be done as needed, then we don't need airport scanning, we don't need dogs at airport, trains and ship. so if you want security it's for all not just some. no picking and choosing. secure for all or none
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump nope I do it everyday
@charliekirk11 @sstampanderson To be truly fair, we need to do it while they're still running for office, and then continue to bring down everyone who in anyway shape or form associated with them. we should start with warren
@marcorubio wow dems are screaming to open the gov. but could care less about the true facts which is The wall could not be built without 10 democrat votes 2018 in the senate.. so if you want to blame someone there you go! blame dems resist then and resist now.. no pay yeah dems keep it up
@sandyyates @marcorubio Tell Chuck and Nancy to get from behind their walls and sit at the table and get it done.. they're the ones who went on vacation.. if the people and workers were so dam important they would had stayed and worked it out.. actions speak louder than words.
@rendale @marcorubio you sound like the media word for word, any thoughts of your own? Dems can send billions to foreign countries but not one dime for our own security, all so they can say the are a caring people... really, how is a drone going to stop people from crossing the border? I wait
RT @KayaJones: If you serve Jesus like and retweet ♥️💫✝️
@ChuckCallesto you must be the racist! I am sure you don't even know the true meaning, but one thing is for sure you are a liar! you didn't grow up in the bronx, you grew up wanting for nothing, you really think your fooling people. This isn't a game that your doing, you are playing with lives
@KamalaHarris it is you and your leader pelosi that refuse to fund the wall, you want to pass everything else including 12 billion to foreign countries, yet 0 for our security.. stop with the games and get the wall done
@AOC @RashidaTlaib funny that your not really from the bronx, you moved there, but you were brought up wanting for nothing, although you would think you went to the worst colleges in the US... stop with the lies and the games and just be yourself for once.
@AOC You AOC do not understand how that works, you pretend to but every statement out of your mouth sounds like someone in HS.. your suppose to have a degree and yet you can't explain how the tax system works..
@AOC I have lived long enough in a democrat state and have heard over and over the same crap, then when they pass tax laws it's the middle class that gets hit the hardest and the poor get free and rich gets loop holes.. who the hell are you kidding.. taxes are on middle class as alway
@KamalaHarris you pretend to care and yet you do nothing for the poor children in this country who are living in tents on your very own streets, but hey they're not important to you or other dems, you just care about illegals who most of them came in with traffickers.. yeah glad you care
@KamalaHarris Then I suggest you get back to work and pass the funds for the wall if your so concern... oh wait, your about resisting not working for the people. sad that you pretend to care when you never wanted for anything in life that was needed to survive
@ewarren A socialist is what she is really about, she interviewed in 2018 wanting to raise taxes 75%, company government control. she lies and lies.. she's done nothing for the state of MA, she is another well to do pretending she know what poor is like.. never lived poor silver spoon
@ewarren All those poor suckers have no idea what you are really all about! you lied and lied some more, you have no intent to work for the middle class when you yourself stated that you want to gov control work, raise taxes up to 75% and mandate companies.. your a socialist 2 destroy USA
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President Please do not give in, we should be not be funding any foreign aid until the people of this country is taken care of first.. we are a caring nation, but we seem to keep forgetting to take care of our own, once that's done what is left over send to help others.
Democrats have become the party of Thugs! Fouled mouth, disrespectful group! This is a view of what our country is becoming and worse yet, they're raising another group of people who will even be worse, bullying is going to become worse, because when you believe in all about me https://t.co/CFhKoEpprO
@pahubb43 Battle on, it is needed even though at times it seems useless since nothing appears to change, but it's coming and all those who have turned their backs on Americans will pay the price
@ChadPergram chuck and nancy are playing with heart strings, it's not fare, but then again putting families in unnecessary danger just so you can say you beat Trump. This is on you and nancy regardless, give him the funds and we all can move on if your truly so concern about these families
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump oh chuck shame on you to put other countries needs above your own country! There are people here that need help and never seems to be enough to help them, billions to UN,  to foreign countries, but nothing to secure our own country..  think we're all stupid. Build the wall
@ewarren @TGowdySC Oh let's not forget about this one, and then play the ignorance game, like you didn't know! Give me a dam break, people who believe anything that comes from your mouth have not lived in the state you represent. What happen to fixing masshealth? https://t.co/ArO0f3N12P
@ewarren @TGowdySC Elizabeth setting your sights on someone who doesn't play around would not be smart move on your part! Everyone is entitled to make career choices before, during and after serving. Remember this Elizabeth? https://t.co/NKJGkoQQCn
@rmead777 @realDonaldTrump Thank you, stay strong and hold your ground! we support you
@Dorothyjohler Any representative should be conducting themselves in a proffesional manner at all times, or you step down. We are not going to except this from any party any more.. we elected people to represent us, not act like the thug in a gang! Unless.... dems are now a gang!
@ewarren @SpeakerPelosi @AyannaPressley @LoriUSCongress It didn't take you long to get back to the resist movement now did it.. you lied back in March 2018 saying you weren't going to run for president and then right after the holiday's what do you do announce that your are... liar.. all dems are liars.. proven 1st day
Democrat Congress already voted themselves a day off.. we are in real trouble
Congratulations, Utah put into the senate a democrat even though he say's he a republican. Remember obamacare was modeled after romney care in Massachusetts it doesn't work there and obamacare doesn't' work now.. he was placed there to protect obamacare and resist the president
Congratulations Utah you voted yourselves a democrat in disguised as a republican..
@KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi Don't you really mean can't wait to see all the impeachment articles to be placed, already started.. again you guys are off with a lie, you all said you were going to legislate lie lie lie
@realDonaldTrump Why not use that money to fund the wall, since it was money that we didn't have before?
@pahubb43 @LRbullies Mitt is a democrat in disguised, remember obamacare was modeled after romney care in MA. he is about war and money. He is a puppet in disguise just like flake and mccaine. people of Utah you have been played!
@jam2885 @ewarren @maddow so it's ok to get hundreds of thousand of dollars from people like the coke brothers and other individuals shouldn't be disclosed? really that's how they own the candidates. if she doesn't disclose small donations that's ok, but the large ones from people of power u mght rethink
@BreitbartNews Who is running the congress and the senate? is it schumer, nancy seems to take talking points from him.. it was also stated that both nancy and chuck kept interupting the home land security director during the meeting, they didn't want to hear anything about country security
@BreitbartNews Her path for republicans was to fund more tax payers money to other countries, nothing for the security of this country.. this say's it all.. She is another one who wants to destroy this country all for the fat wallet
@ewarren @maddow @MSNBC please talk about your voting record, one with obama everything was a yes and this president everything is a no regardless if it's good for people or not.. your a mess and don't forget to tell your lies as if it was true
@phenrycissp @pahubb43 @facebook Liberals calls everything and anyone racist when it goes against their push
@pahubb43 I am told that at least once a month, they haven't thrown me out yet, but I am sure it's coming
I would really love to meet a democrat that didn't lie every time they open their mouths
@ewarren Are you donating your money to the illegals now, oh yeah calling them refugee's now while you campaign? People of MA must love paying your wages from tax payers money for work that won't be done while your out of town and Washington all the time.. your just like hillary lie lie
RT @Redtowel4: Karma is real a-hole.	#BeKindToPets https://t.co/qMfDVVfqJH
@snowball1926 He is a democrat in disguise! He did everything demo in MA. He got out when he knew people were catching on to his antics, it will not be any different in Washington, except he will think he is a big time politician and will run around being a mouth piece for the dems, way to go
@JeffFlake Jeff Flake are you telling us that Romney is yours and the rino's elites puppet! He was a fake in MA and he is a fake now, oh just like you Jeff
Well let's all remember this when she starts campaigning! she would rather donate her income to refugees while telling everyone that she's about rebuilding the middle class! Talking through the other side of your face again Elizabeth? https://t.co/4W8632ZVnD
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees your donating to refugees, but not to the American citizens who need help as well.. that say's everything about you! your for everyone except the people of this country.. guess we aren't as important than everyone else in the world now are we? homeless could us donations too
@BernieSanders Bernie, why aren't you telling people in the state of Vermont that you represent there is no unions! if any it's far and very few in between. either walk the walk or sit down and shut up
@ewarren where have you been for the last 10 years with building middle class? MA saw a drop in middle class. in fact living in boston has driven out middle class, and driving out the poor.. you didn't do anything since you became senator, what makes me think you will as president?
@flywithkamala @KamalaHarris you have no more power than you did before, the senate is still controlled by the Republicans and congress can't pass anything without the senate.. people she's talking more resist and less about our country and our people. wake up
@SenFeinstein So now you guys are allowing mayors of cities to release illegals from deportation including murders.. NYC mayor just did it, how many more we're not hearing about?
@SenSchumer Since you represent NY why is mayor cumo releasing illegals including 4 murders that is illegal? Glad your looking out for our country. NOT! Concern for your politics instead of the safety for this country
@realDonaldTrump Happy New Year Mr. President
@KamalaHarris how are you going to cut taxes for the middle class and give medicare for all? What about medicare for senate and congress and all gov employees? I don't think so, since you won't give up privilege care and tax cuts for the wealthy since you fall into that category. only pee ons
@SenWarren you just can't help yourself now can you~ lie after lie, your hoping if you say it enough people will start to believe you! So my question is.... if your not part of the solution then your part of the problem! Which one are U? The problem, you have resisted Trump every step
That is like me saying I don't want your kids kidnapped but if I see it happen outside my window, don't involve me. But you will shop Amazon and buy starbucks. Sounds legit?
It took a NON-politician to figure this out and do something. If you read the Mexican Trade Deal it looks like Mexico is paying for the wall, maybe this is how he got around Congress ;) #artofwar		To those that want the wall but don't want to pay for it.
Border Agents sue for workman comp and violence. 	Walls can't be minimized, changed, redirected, bought, bribed, nor can they sue. Politicians do NOT want a wall or we would have had one when Schumer and Pelosi were screaming for one in 06 and begged for $25Billion.
We can't just increase border agents because as the Obama Admin minimized our military he also did it to our border (if you look at CBP numbers it averages the same only because our side decreased and the Mexican side increased, wonder why?)
. . .a bunch of motorcycle clubs and hunting clubs would have already built the damn wall. . .anyway . .we can afford it . ..we have more oil than you can shake a stick at. . . .  ;)		ADDITION: 	OUR GOVERNMENT SELLS OUR CHILDREN. What are we not comprehending about this.
If he does NOTHING else .  . he is winning the human trafficking space. and that is enough for us.		We need the wall. This is a Texas thing and I wish we didn't have to rely on Feds to determine what we did with our borders but alas . . .it does. If it was determined by us Texans
Maybe you don't like the booming economy. Maybe you don't like his past sins. Maybe you can't stand his twitter account . . .. but we in trafficking take our hats off to him. Sometimes it takes a narcissistic profile to strategically disrupt (trafficking terms).
I am done.		But since Trump came in office it has stirred a hornets' nest and we have had more arrest than we have EVER SEEN and we have more leads stirred up than we have ever had in our history of investigation. You may not like his personality.
I gave up my case in 2017 because I simply couldn't beat a govt that was involved in trafficking. When I step outside of my home and find a red laser on my chest and I don't know if it is my govt or my target . . . .I am done. When 7 of our witness are murdered before trial . . .
If you haven't worked in trafficking or the Honduran govt or with MS13 gang . . . .you don't have the intel to have an opinion. Leave it to the people that do have the intel. I say this from someone that has about 2% of the intel and it SCARES ME.
and it is 90% less illegal border crossing.		WHAT IF . . .WHAT IF . . . one of those children was worth it? What if it stopped ONE child from being trafficked from CPS/DHS thru the Spanish pathway or into our country? would it be worth it if it was your child?
I worked on for the last 4 years trafficks about 630 children a year, thru the border.	Maybe you don't believe in the border. But statistics prove fewer border issues where we have a wall. Numbers are PROVEN by looking at other countries that have walls
here or there. We are talking about MILLIONS of dollars in trafficking of our children to and from. ISIS (which was govt created) funded MS13 gang. Honduras is partial middle east/Jewish/Spaniard/British ... it is a very unique country with very unique ties. Just ONE case
Honduras was rated the MOST dangerous country in the western hemisphere when I lived there. There is a reason for that.		We need the wall. Every one of us involved in trafficking investigation (that isn't govt attached) knows this. It isn't about immigrant petty crime or a murder
I know this because I studied tattoos and I see them even on the newscast!! You have no idea how dangerous these people are. You just don't understand. This isn't TV crime. We saw people murdered right in front of us, we saw more dead bodies than I care to tell you about.
yet they (the prisoners) allowed us to enter. Guards were posted in towers at all four corners. If I called the govt over prison and asked about the MS13 gang population I GUARANTEE it would be many fewer if not empty . . .because they were interspersed throughout the caravan.
3) My husband was the chaplain for MS13 gang IN HONDURAS. Meaning, I spent much time in a third world prison with MS13 gang members that were segregated FROM THE REGULAR POPULATION. To which they were so dangerous they were self-policed and the guards could not even enter . . .t.
2) I worked with the Honduran Government. Externally, yes, but was involved in politics and government of that country and lived there and ran a company and a ministry for several years.
My average day in human trafficking investigation would traumatize the average human.		1) I specialize in Texas human trafficking. I have been up against FBI/DHS/CPS on several cases. I KNOW southern border human trafficking/drugs/gun runs.
Amy Coello	12 26 2018 I have refrained and really tried to only state this privately but I think the time has come. I know I will probably get backlash and I just really don't care anymore. Why? because nobody knows the crap that I deal with in human trafficking investigation.
@ewarren u won't be getting my support, I had you as my senator to long to know that every word out of your mouth is a lie, means nothing, your about corruption and if your not you might as well be, because your looking the other way
@KamalaHarris So we can look forward to higher taxes, lost of income, and more Americans living in the streets while illegals move into the homes that you made unaffordable to live in for the American families subsidized with taxpayers money. and bankrupt the medicare system so elderly lose.
@NastiMarvasti @KMolck @KamalaHarris Shame on the politicians who took the bribes, Everyone of them who took bribes should be arrested and jailed. She is a politician and can't even keep all the citizens in homes, many are living on the street due to high cost of taxes, living. all for one group, it's not Americans
Wishing everyone a very Happy New Year https://t.co/Ep8d9ySlZs
@ewarren your voting record clearly demostrates that when obama was in office you voted yes to everything, when trump is in office you have voted no to everything that has to do with trump! you are clearly not for this country, you have been promised something from NWO and Soro
@ewarren You have never worked for American people, nor the state of MA. you have been running around the county protesting, and making false allegations. you have been nothing but resisting anything for Americans, but worked hard to line your pockets though, you done nothing w/o kickback
@cpet1231 @realDonaldTrump if anything is passed in congress it has to go to the senate, the Republicans need at least 10 dems to vote for it, and since they're the party of resistance it could never be passed. Yes even some Republicans were never Trumpers.. nice country works for political gains not us
@nikipu @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump where do you get your information? all news are reporting he is at the WH
@leebailey11 @UtesLuv @JacobAWohl The problem is children are not taught critical thinking problem solving skills, they are taught to follow within the lines. Higher education fails students as well since they drive the narrative that people must think a certain way. the problem is all problems aren't the same!
@leebailey11 @JacobAWohl Ok I made a mistake, I was thinking weeks when I wrote that, but hey your perfect right? you don't make mistakes or give someone a break right.
@leebailey11 @UtesLuv @JacobAWohl When teachers fail to continue to challenge a child who is advance beyond the class and tells you that they can't teach to everyone's learning types then yes they're not doing they're jobs.
@leebailey11 @UtesLuv @JacobAWohl All I can say is look at what's coming out of college now~ not many can budget their funds, they can't balance a check book, and they can't make change! So if teachers did their jobs instead of teaching to federal testing standards these people would be much better off~
@leebailey11 @UtesLuv @JacobAWohl no it's not, but you do need math to be able to budget! common sense, if you don't know how much your spending vs how much income then guess what math hasn't been taught properly. This is basic math. adding, subtracting and percentages, etc. see the failure
@leebailey11 @UtesLuv @JacobAWohl pushed through the system is what a lot of teachers do regardless if the child was taught well or not! Then tell me if what you say is true how come so many children grow up not know how to do simple math, budget income, etc.. oh lead by example.
@UtesLuv @leebailey11 @JacobAWohl I know that, but not everyone works m-f and not everyone works 8 hr day's. My point is teachers have more time off.  summer vac 8 wks, winter vac, spring vac, right here is more time off than a person who get 4 wks paid vacation, not to mention every holiday on the calendar.
@ChuckCallesto There has to be a way that we can stop this! Stop the wasting of money being used against others instead of bettering our country! it's seems waiting to vote people out doesn't work, since most forget why later on!
@ChuckCallesto They won't give us the Wall but they'll spend all the taxpayers money on lawyers... Making the wealthy wealthier and the poor poorer! Now we know why there is no money for the wall! spending all our tax dollars on this crap!
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump Get your butt to the table and do your job! if it was so important to you and you really care you would be there instead of at home! Stop spewing hate only the blind see's it the way you do~ it was the dems who walked away and went on vac. Not Trump.. He's waiting on you guys
@ewarren @realDonaldTrump True people elected you to do the people's business! but where are you now? in Cambridge in your cozy home? on vacation somewhere? but you not in Washington DC, so again talking out of the side of your mouth. you must really think people are really that stupid! Then again some do
@KamalaHarris should have thought about that before walking away from the table, this is on you and the senators and congress.. stop complaining and donate your check so they can get paid, pay their rent, buy food.. just complain but do nothing about it.. step back to the table
@leebailey11 @JacobAWohl most people get 2 week vacation a year, and some get three and fewer get 4, they all have to work 40 plus hrs a week to make much less than a teacher. I have teachers in my family and non of them work to 5/6 ish unless they're doing after school activity as football, etc.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump you spent that last 2 years running around the country protesting against our President, you walked away from the table for the wall, and you tweet about him closing the gov. you still get paid why don't you do your job that you were elected to do and get the wall done
@leebailey11 @JacobAWohl Regardless if the numbers are off, they do get way more days off than the average working person. summer vacation 8 wks, winter vac, spring vac and every holiday, including days before and after, could equal 4 months. The average person works 8 hrs a day  355 days a year
@EllenDatlow @SenFeinstein and they are the corrupted ones, it seems to me you are the one who learned nothing! it has been known for years that their governments are corrupted and take from others in order to maintain their power. thus leaving them beaten, killed and poor.
@SenFeinstein Maybe if the US stop giving billions to the corrupted governments they wouldn't have the problems they have, after all they will promise the world if it means deeper thicker pockets for the corrupt and nothing for the minions. But hey socialism is the word today! Right
@linnee423 @vivmariefrances @realDonaldTrump Impeaching Trump = Chaos, drugs &amp; crimes, open borders
Well our Dems at work! Someone is funding this, and there is no stopping them, why should they stop when the word got out that they will be released into the country where they can disappear, and dems working hard to get them auto citizenship, dems pushing daca again! about votes https://t.co/UQKWL4S9Ly
@KamalaHarris Everyone except the cool aid drinkers know that dems have never kept their word about anything! if so then why hasn't immigration reform done years ago, when passed by congress? oh yeah it was just for show and tell, because it never happened once elected
@elizabethforma @DHSgov @CBP You are not acknowledging that the child may had contracted whatever was wrong with him prior to entering the country, once they were in custody they did everthing possible as the signs dictated, since they didn't speak either spanish nor english. Yet dems do nothing to denture
@KamalaHarris Stop right now Kamala when you know dam well that it's your party that refuses to fund the wall, which is what we want! We want our families protected, we want our laws enforced, and most of all we want the government to do their jobs and stop playing political gains for votes
@KamalaHarris Trying to pull on the heart strings to get people to side with you! When in reality the dems are the ones who won't budge! Also, if your working for the government then you know you should save, if they don't make enough then give them some of your pay! you get free travel etc
@KamalaHarris why aren't you doing anything about it? oh yeah resist, resist, them blame others for not doing anything about it! Negotiation is a two way street, it's not the dems way or the highway!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Merry Christmas to you both! God Bless
@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas Mr. President
This is all on both Nancy and Chuck! You are getting what you deserve once your completely exposed, which this President will truly show all of us https://t.co/X3ljTNnAo6
it was said they can't think for themselves and this proves it https://t.co/MhW0DfxJnW
@realDonaldTrump I believe that they have been playing this game for many years and it's just a smoke and mirror so they can say they care, until they can't say it any longer... they never delivered the wall to Reagan,
@DavMicRot @LisaMei62 what's the matter David did you lose some of your money? it doesn't seem to bother the dems that everytime they have anything to do with Government the market tanks.... obama years... many working family loses theirs daily all because of a game dems are playing
@AIIAmericanGirI @TwitchyTeam only the dems keep playing the color card, because they think it automatically gets them advantages over others! Enough is enough! She puts her pants and bra on just like every other person
@AIIAmericanGirI @TwitchyTeam No one is like or disliking her because of her color, it's that she talks out of the other side of her mouth! she places blame at other feet, while she does exactly what she blames others for! She ran home for Christmas while she and other shut the government down!
@cuenre @gdubbu77 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Icjh6AqxIi...	Feb 3, 2018 - Nearly 70 percent of Americans oppose the visa lottery which allows .
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump If you care so much why are you home instead of Washington hammering out the details! Because your only pretending to care, your about votes and that's it.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Your wrong, you voted back in 2006, 2009 for border wall security, what changed? Oh Trump in office, resist the 1 single thing dems are doing, blame others for your action. your worried about getting voted to speaker of the house.. your deceitful and should be voted out 4 good
@KamalaHarris how much is contributed to the democrats? Since they're the ones that have been resisting since day 1 of the presidency! Plenty of blame all around! Stop blaming start solving if your so worried
@pahubb43 I read that if any politicians name was on the donation they would not honor it! Might want to take a look! I too donated and will again next month
@realDonaldTrump All Congress and Senators should had stayed too! They should not be allow to go home until the business is done!
@TheFakeLiberal @Denneo911 Tech only works for surveillance purposes, but do very little in stopping the act. These dems think the whole country is stupid, what they don't realize that not everyone got the cool aid in school..
@elizabethforma As you sit in your warm home and keep collecting a paycheck say's you! if you truly cared about these people you and your other dems wouldn't had let the government shut down with your NO WALL, NOT NOW, NOT NEXT WEEK, NOT IN JAN.. THIS WAS DEMS NOT TRUMP!
@mikebwonder @realDonaldTrump Nope and no one is asking me! although I think even if they did, it wouldn't be included since polls can be changed, rearranged, etc
@KamalaHarris you were doing good until you had to bring in the very thing that you and your fellow dems have created! Build the wall. I too are not just thinking about the CA people who have lost everything, but everyone all over the US. They need our help and services first. U want illegals
So the count down begins~ For all those who celebrate Christmas have a very Merry Christmas and may you holiday be joyous and safe! For those who don't may your time during this season also be joyous and safe
@BreitbartNews she needs to be gone! She and other are going to make the government so bad that nothing at all will get done! get ready for more laws to pass that will need to be passed to see what's in it just like obamacare! yet they will grandstand and say it's Trump's fault.
@KamalaHarris your complaining and yet you and your co democrats decided not to fund the wall, This and other bills could had been worked on, but no you would rather resist then do the peoples business.
We The People Will Fund The Wall https://t.co/3iCQnjZ5mG
@tmagasays We all have been on the wrong side of the fence at one time or another, and when that light bulb goes off and you really see what's going on! Wow, it's liberating and a renew faith is born. Welcome back
@NBCNews They tried that one before and came out that it's illegal to do so because at the time he was still a private citizen! nothing has changed unless they're going to look at last year taxes. These so call brilliant people keep forgetting he was in public office before like them
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump If you care so much then why are you home? why aren't you in Washington DC doing your job? Better yet why don't you donate your pay to them? Oh yeah all talk no action unless it's nothing Trump! Your a sad example of a leader.
@KamalaHarris If your so concern then why don't you donate your pay to them? Why aren't you in Washington DC instead of home with your family? Doesn't bother you that much! The cloak of pretend to care has been reveled. Stop with the blame game!
@Ocasio2018 I don't normally agree with your way of thinking but this time I do! it's the right thing, since money talks and BS walks.. right now they all walked
@senatemajldr @POTUS Do not give in, This country needs the security of the wall a long with strong leaders that will make sure of it.. Build the wall.  Your a smart man, but cowarding to Schumer looks like your the puppet to the Democrats
So the senate is worried about the people who aren't getting paid because of the government 25% shut down went home for Christmas. However, President Trump is staying at the Whitehouse through Christmas! What does that say to you? Dems don't care not even a little about you!
Funny how he has changed his tune since 2009 https://t.co/Q3XR4zjmsT
@KamalaHarris who are you kidding, it didn't bother you the last two times the government shut down because of your resistance, now it bothers you, well give pay from your check, since it didn't bother you about it being shut down otherwise you would had done the right thing
Fox news is becoming fake news
Is it just me or does it seem the very people who supported Trump on Fox news is now sounding like the main stream media.  all opinions and doesn't focus on facts
@NBCNews you can't stop people from crossing the border with a drone or sensors, they still melt into the land, and so will terrorist. what a plan schumer just for future votes
@NBCNews Back in 2006, Democrats were perfectly happy to support hundreds of miles of physical barriers along the border. Twenty-six Democrats voted for the bill, including then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Clinton, and my friend the current Democratic Leader from New York.  So why not now
War on christmas still on! democratic senate was wished a Merry Christmas and she replied Well I don't know if it's merry yet! but Happy Holidays.... The play on words
Dems on tv almost slip by stating we want to keep the border.... we want to keep the border safe... you mean open right democrats?
When are the dems take responsibility for the shut down, it was Schumer who keeps saying no wall no votes not Trump, and yet dems are pulling out the sob stories, yet they don't lose a penny
@NBCNews Back in 2006, Democrats were perfectly happy to support hundreds of miles of physical barriers along the border. Twenty-six Democrats voted for the bill, including then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Clinton, and my friend the current Democratic Leader from New York. YOU ARE A LIAR!
@kwareroha @David34271557 @NBCNews Let's see, Nov 6, 2017 - After revelation from former Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile said DNC had engineered the party’s primary election system in favor of then-candidate Hillary Clinton
You just got caught in a big lie! you and hillary and obama all have stated that you support a wall in the past or a barrier! https://t.co/qPFxbq7OE4
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump you just lied to the American people when you stated that you have never supported a border wall! in fact you and hillary and obama all called for a border wall but called it a bearer. A wall a bearer are the same thing! you are a liar!
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump This coming from a women who represents a sanctuary state that has seen the crime rate rise, as they change a felony to a misdemeanor. You are for open borders, but pretends to care about the citizens, when you know illegal equals votes
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump you pretend to care about the people who won't get paid, but you do no matter what! it's the dems who are refusing to keep the border secured! It's not about political party, it's about drugs, human trafficking and country security! Stop playing the pity game, and do your job
RT @GOPChairwoman: How extreme House Dems are on immigration:		*177 rejected $5.7B in border security		*166 voted against Kate’s Law (incre…
@KamalaHarris Here's an idea, why not have all the illegals and DACA pay for all the legal immigrants to become citizens, and pay for themselves and family to become a visa holder. This will tell them that if they come here they pay not only for themselves but others who came here legally
@KamalaHarris You think people are stupid! everyone knows this is the way you look like you care, but in reality you need their votes that's why you guys wait for someone to give into amnesty, while people who came her legally once again get a kick in the ass.
@SteveLaRue2 @KamalaHarris Both Congress and Senators get paid regardless of the shut down, they get their benefits without interruption, and are allow to continue to make money outside of their elected duties.. so they get paid not only to do the people's business, but also to conduct personal business
@KamalaHarris And yet you and other fellow senators and congress will still get your pay and benefits! you lose nothing no wonder there is no incentive for you and others to do the people's work, and you pretend to care, yet you fail the people of this country just to resist never Trumper
@KamalaHarris So your worried about it passing the house before the new congress? Wow Now you know who it feels to be promised something only to have time run out and then lose it altogether, Hmmm what goes around comes around! Did you vote for the wall? I doubt it
@lied_trump @NBCNews what I see through all the abc media is lies, they tell the half truths, Plus I worked in human services were many illegals worked with fake ID's and the companies looked the other way.. do you think that these people didn't vote? Are you that blind? Many dead registered to vote
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Chuck your the one who is throwing the tantrums everytime you stand at the podium to speak about your resistance pure and simple. This has nothing to do with the wall, everything about Trump getting a win! put your big boys pants on and do your job and stop the grand standing
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He may had said it, but your clearly against anything Trump! So if this doesn't pass the shut down is on you!
Voted nay on wall last night!		Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.),	 Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), 	Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), 	Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), 	Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.),	 Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), 	Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.)
@lied_trump @NBCNews yeah if you count all the dead people and illegals and double votes

The GoFundMe for the wall has raised 9 million in just 3 days~ This tells me that more than just a hand full of people want boarder security.. Go donate now! let's get this done! Congress and Senators can just go home and stay there we can get things done without them
And yet the mainstream media would have you think that this was a last minute thing and done without anyone else consultation! so if those who didn't agree walk out then pretend the President is losing it... Think again. Media isn't reporting facts again folks https://t.co/dkTmnV95V6
@lied_trump @NBCNews Well time will tell and I think your wrong! The problem with the press is the feel they can speak for everyone and know what everyone's thinking! Well why didn't Hillary win then?
@ChuckGrassley @INVUQT That's great! Why are you supporting the Dems against the funding of the Wall? According to Nancy and Chuck your against Trump too?
@NBCNews They believe Trumps base will leave if Trump doesn't get the wall and we will retaliate against him! They also think we don't know they're playing games and have no intent of ever funding the wall!
A statement was made that if Trump doesn't get the wall and shuts down government his base will leave him and retaliate! Wouldn't they retaliate against the dems because they are denying US people safety and protection?
Fox news is turning into false news more so apparent since the dems won the house!
If the house passes the 5 billion for the wall and the senate doesn't then the government shut down will be the fault of the democrats. Schumer already stated they won't pass it!
@ChadPergram They're getting piss because the republicans are starting to stand up to the democrats and breaking away from the manipulations and games. They promised him the money before and then took it away. that's what they want to do again if he waits... Trump build the wall
Congress and the senate have a habit of passing bills, but do nothing to make sure they're being delivered and enforced. https://t.co/cvikhsjy6r
@elizabethforma Would you care to explain how it is that America has the lowest emissions and least amount contributed to climate change than any other country in the world.. like China? oh could it be that the oil prices are low and your kickbacks aren't as big as they use to be?
@realDonaldTrump Good, I think those who are opposing it have something in it for them! lining their pockets with kickbacks from those independent companies there! otherwise why would we stay were their people should be able to run and defend their own country! Good for you Mr. President
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump your a broken record, you tell the president to do something that he has been doing, it's people like you and the media who keep telling the false narratives so you can resist without looking like that's what your doing! So Chuck when are you planning on doing work!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump it was all for show, they never allocated the money to build the wall! Also what happen to all the money that was budget for it back then?
@LisaMei62 Some how Hillary You are behind this! you didn't think our president would stop them at the border! you thought he is a weak man, your dirty tricks don't seem to be working these days

@KamalaHarris I just paid off my 24,000 student loan! I wanted the education and I agree to pay it back! That was my choice and my responsibility! it's well known that when you get free anything you don't take it serious, plus it's a choice not mandatory like k-8 is, why should I pay for you?
@SenFeinstein As sad as the death of a child is no matter where they come from, one must ask why you don't call for investigation when a child is killed by an illegal? Why did they manage to cross the boarder? How do we make sure they're safe while applying for asylum in their own country?
@elizabethforma @CITCBoston That's great you showed up~ but what did you do to make a difference in the law making process? Boston is part of the northern states that get extremely cold and yet shelters are slim!
@SenSchumer @CPeoplesStokes Stop with the color crap! I am offended that you don't respect people enough to reference them as a person with qualifications, or merits, etc. But only Dem leaders will keep pushing the race card, now it's time to push back! refer to us as people not color now!
@KamalaHarris you do realize that people have to get supplemented healthcare to pay for prescriptions that medicare and medical care that isn't covered by medicare right? Oh your forgetting to tell people that right? so we go broke and get to pay more out of pocket too
Now stop with the grandstanding and do your job! or step down and let someone else who will do the job take your place! https://t.co/5nQl70l3TD
@Ocasio2018 and once you figure out how it all works you'll be doing the same thing! you will find that golden goose like Warren and her stance against big banks, except she gets cuts for it.
@RealSaavedra Funny how he doesn't seem to remember anything until the cameras turn on, then he remembers everything and then tries to turn it on Trump. Getting old and he needs to be made an example of! we know the dems won't do anything and so does he
@elizabethforma @CedricRichmond Going after higher taxes again to pay for something that couldn't possible know what the highest tax will be, since we know it will change to compensate inflation. So once again going after the middle class that's why you need middle class emergency funding as well as poor
@KamalaHarris Equal rights is for all not just women, you and others have taken it too far, and now it appears to be a war on men~ Men shouldn't have to pay for women reproduction rights, like women shouldn't have to pay for anything male related medical. stop with women over men and just be=
@SenSchumer you mean like you Chuck? your toxic, you swing like the wind, and never have the backbone to actually stick to your stance! Your about votes and votes only! you could care less about right and wrong! remember that women?
@elizabethforma ACA is a tax disguised as healthcare, mandatory to all, but only a few really pay and it's not the senators or congressmen and women. ACA is not affordable just like Mass healthcare is not. It's a way to get into people's pockets. so who are you kidding?
@SenSchumer Build the wall! Chuck you look more like a clown than a person who wants what is best for this country! you look like the bully who was about to throw a tantrum the other day! Grow up do your job or step down
@SenSchumer Oh Chuck, Why is it your so against protecting the citizens of this country? when not so many years ago you were for it? You are trying to hold this country hostage all because Trump will not fall in line with the liberal's agenda.
@KamalaHarris People with pre condition health problems don't have access to healthcare is a lie! I and my husband both have pre condition health problems and we didn't have any problems getting healthcare. The nice thing is I no longer am force to pay 3/4 of my income to pay for it.
@KamalaHarris Oh stop the lying it was another way to tax people, it never offered affordable healthcare. making free people buy a product is nothing more than a communist act. by the way where did all the money go?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump you acted like an idiot the other day! like some wise ass you was playing to the bias media, what you forget that not everyone watches the bias media. If he asked me I would be proud to serve. So speak for yourself and stop trying to pit people against each other.
@Ocasio2018 Democrats are proving the type of educated people who are about to enter into our congress, sheep, doctrine, bobble heads, think they're in acting school putting on a performance to fool people, but reality you and the others without a clue on history, current events are NWO tool

@cmckenzie0762 @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump The difference is that most of 99.9% came here legally, and that is what is being asked of these people, to follow the laws~ My husband followed the laws when he came here!

@SenSchumer @senatemajldr I for one am sick and tired of you elected officials being paid tax dollars to do nothing but resist every turn of the president! You and others who continue to not do your jobs need to step down and make room for those who will do the work!
@KamalaHarris How about you stop with the resist and do your job! How about helping the people in your state that desperately need yours and other elected officials to help them out! But instead your worried about illegals, Anything Trump, and the next big bang to run your presidency on!
@freddyatton @realDonaldTrump Parents aren't so concern about the welfare of their children, if they were they wouldn't put them in harms way! They would had taken the asylum from Mexico if they really wanted it! What difference if it's Mexico or the US? oh it's the free benefits on the taxpayers back
@elizabethforma @pfizer Why aren't you doing it for the bogus over priced health care in MA? it's just as expensive if not more and yet nothing changes, just higher cost
@SenWarren People are assuming she's talking about people will own their own homes, reread it she talks about rents being lowered, she is talking about government subsidized rents, people pay 1/3 of the rent who live their and the government pay's the rest to the landlord, = tax dollars!
@Ocasio2018 Stop lying! you are so wrong on so many levels it's not even funny any longer! With all the sheeps including yourself, it won't be long before you destroy this country from the inside out! Healthcare isn't in danger in fact we're still using obama care, and obama put kids in jail

@KamalaHarris Where were you? did you help get these people food to keep up their strength as they fought those fires, and rescue people? No I don't think you were anywhere to be found except on twitter
@KamalaHarris I Thankful for all the people who were on the ground helping people get through the fire, but I am very disappointed with the government officials of the state who allowed their citizens to live on the street and parking lots in tents, while illegals get to live in luxury tents.
@realDailyWire These women do not represent me! they are vile, deceitful poor excuse of being representatives of our states and country! These games need to be stopped now and do the people's business, otherwise step down so someone who really wants to do the job can get things done

Democrats are out telling us that every state deserves to be counted, what they're not telling you is they are including the illegal vote! They want you to rally around this idea without coming out and saying it as such. They don't care just about citizens votes which=dem lost
@KamalaHarris Every vote that is done by legal and valid ballots of citizens need to be counted. Those of illegals do not have a right to determine our government! But then again Dems like to play dirty! like to twist the truth! silent the opposition! illegal ballots votes = fraud!!!!!

@eigenscape @SenSchumer ACA would cost me $1900 a month, $12,000 deductible with $1,000,000 limit.

@SenSchumer When Cobra cost less than ACA &amp; coverage is the same, What is so affordable about it? When people have to pay for items they don't need so others get it free, not to mention lining the pockets of politicians and big pharm! One is tax and the other allows outrages price for drugs
@SenSchumer No Chuck, Immigration is one of those area's that you democrats refuse to work on! Let's be honest here, you purposely don't want to change anything about it, because you think it will translate into votes for democrats! ACA was nothing more than a scam, taxes, nothing affordable

@TKO_Princess @BlaikBob @KamalaHarris If you make millions a year, you would pay up to reaching $128,401 for a total of $15,921.60, then they don't pay anything more into SS, and in some cases they can get it when they retire, plus pension, plus annuity, plus stocks, etc.. Middle class, upper poor, pay the bulk
@TKO_Princess @BlaikBob @KamalaHarris Did you know Some police officers and other government workers – including public school teachers – do pay into Social Security,  if you earn $128,401, that additional dollar won’t be taxed for Social Security, They do pay up to this dollar point.
@TKO_Princess @BlaikBob @KamalaHarris medicare for all is the same idea as Obama care, taking money from those who paid into it all their working lives from their paycheck which is deducted out of their paycheck every pay period they worked. so it's on the back of the workers, not the wealthy!
@TKO_Princess @BlaikBob @KamalaHarris Remember you can keep your healthcare!, cost will be affordable for everyone!, People lost employer healthcare because they made 15 per hour and less, they're cost was 250 a week, 1000 a month, deductible 7500 per year with additional out of pocket of 5000. coverage was weak.
@KamalaHarris Bush tried that years ago and it didn't work, instead it raised taxes and so the money went right back to the government! Try again,, how about cut spending instead of trying to make government bigger, how about stop wasting money on 2016 revenge and wasting tax dollars

@gopsaidwhat @clinttherockro1 @CharlotteAlter Social Security and Medicare are paid for by those who work, it's deducted out of their paychecks each pay period.

along with other victims of the Holocaust. After the tide of war turned against him, Hitler committed suicide in a Berlin bunker in April 1945. https://t.co/d93njjbDqX So all you people who think Capitalism is bad and Socialist is good you have been played!
beginning in 1933. Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 led to the outbreak of World War II, and by 1941 Nazi forces had occupied much of Europe. Hitler’s virulent anti-Semitism and obsessive pursuit of Aryan supremacy fueled the murder of some 6 million Jews,
And according to the History channel  Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany’s Nazi Party, was one of the most powerful and notorious DICTATOR of the 20th century. Hitler capitalized on economic woes, popular discontent and political infighting to take absolute power in Germany
So Twitter lock my account out because I tweeted information from https://t.co/vto9SwdVuu about Hitler. People running around calling Trump and his supporters and anyone who don't agree with them Nazi and Racist, well Hitler was socialist, racist, Nazi and was a dictator!
@bluranger_jake @tbird1989138 @SteveKingIA Hitler began writing what would later be considered one of the world’s most dangerous books.

@bluranger_jake @tbird1989138 @SteveKingIA As the leader of Nazi Germany, he orchestrated both World War II and the Holocaust, events that led to the deaths of at least 40,000,000 people. In 1924, while in prison for high treason,
@bluranger_jake @tbird1989138 @SteveKingIA so all you people who think socialist by your own admission thinks it's so great and pride yourself on it, because you think everyone will be equal! they will they will all be poor or dead, and yet you people call Trump hitler! As leader of the Nazi Party
@bluranger_jake @tbird1989138 @SteveKingIA Guess it depends how you look at it, my fathers family went underground to escape hitler and his regime! either way socialist is about control, destruction and wealth for a few while many suffer and even die! So by history book standards he was socialist!

@GOPChairwoman It could be, but then she started to back track and make different statements
@jimsciutto Wow, you didn't even report the complete story and left out important information, we all know this is why Trump calls you and your organization FAKE NEWS! Trying to keep dividing the country, Americans are seeing right through you
the same way! in public it's called bullying and it starts with the adults and these dems are suppose to be examples for our young. and we wonder why there is so much hatred in this country
Dems say they're inclusive, they say equality for all~ yet they're actions are destructive, equality is for only those they like, and call for physical as well as mental abuse! yet they then turn around and play the victim. What's sad it plays to so many that live their lives https://t.co/Nzhehoops5

Who cares what she say's, we all know that it's about money and money only! she has to keep milking it now that her new boyfriend her lawyer is running for president 2020 https://t.co/uPVVbojRh8
Agree! once a reputation is destroy and all is lost they're is no way to restore it to where is was before! Dems are about destroying, they're the one's that keep changing the game, and when it backfires they go to destroy mode. Republic need to do the right thing and stop bowing https://t.co/chDo6qe985

Ford won't testify in Washington DC until the FBI conducts their investigation! Sounds like the democrats are just trying to post pone until after the election since last week polls showed democrats winning

@RealBasedBlonde @JimBramlage This is what our country will look like if democrats get their way with open borders, don't care about crimes, don't care if they take what you own, remember they believe in redistribution
The 30 million companies which are organized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter-S corporations, and LLCs pay their business taxes on their owners’ 1040 personal tax returns. Hiking the top tax rate is a small business tax increase.
Increase the top marginal income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent. This nearly 3 percentage point increase in the top personal rate is not only a hike in the top bracket levy, but it’s also a direct tax increase on small and mid-sized businesses.

People who feel like the priest has let you down, look to the sky and look in your heart, he is with you at all times, God is with you at all times, in all places!
@daxis_gaming @CecyHanna There is a time and a place for everything and taking a knee during the national anthem is not one of them! I am insulted, I am an American, where is your outcry for the police victims who lost their lives? are you working for their victims?
he pushed social programs, encouraging people to live off the system and be lazy, his policies didn't help Americans but helped countries that wished us harm. During his time in office, we saw an increase in terrorist attacks throughout the world https://t.co/mxZrJhkVUR
@Budz442Bud I saw it, it was all college kids, Point.. no one else wrapped around the block, down the street to see him.. but your ok have fun in your own mind buddy~
@daxis_gaming @CecyHanna Your kidding right? taking a knee during the national anthem is not being disrespectful? insulting veterans, American people in general so you can bring light to brutality, these people make millions, let them take some of that money and do some good with it, make a difference
@patdixon @CarrollQuigley1 It's very clear they're against Trump, people who support him or conservative Ideas, they don't care about 1A, they care about using their platform to control thought, by allowing people who have called for the death of the president speaks volumes how Twitter thinks
@66AuntB @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump So, how does he disrespect the office he holds? Tell me with facts, I am interested to know how you and other see it. Elizabeth is about resist and socialism and she wants more of your money, Tell me what has she done for Mass? nothing I know, I lived that state, not anymore
@FoxNews This is offending to Massachusetts people, but taken a knee in protest during the National Anthem is not? Shows Massachusetts people can't have fun or have a sense of humor, you people need to relax
@CoryBooker Your so fake like so many on the democratic side, you pretend to care about people but in reality you only care about yourself, getting attention like a spoiled brat who didn't get your way and threw yourself on the floor when mom said no
@elizabethforma According to the paper that was released it did not state what you just did.. how about you and others liberal democrats stop with the lies and find something to really stand behind,,, how about homeless children?, how about shootings between gangs, how about equality for all
@kchenette @RealJamesWoods He reappeared to enforce those cue words to keep the people brainwashed, since Trumps been in office it has been wearing away
Obama can't get anyone to listen to him anymore, so he goes to the colleges where he knows they have been primed for him and his NWO bull. Bullying whether done elegantly or harsh is still bullying
@WFTV @michaelstrahan @sarahaines @ABCNetwork @vechols @MSaltWFTV Stopped watching ABC, to much news outlets in one day! except it's more about opinion news than facts
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK and only democrats can act like defiant spoil brats, throw tantrums, and act like they're a hero. point fingers, blame everyone else. If a Republican does it, their a bully, and whatever ism you want to call it!
Found this on another site, Thoughts? seem to make sense right? so now we need the real document. https://t.co/WQ0VRS3d5I
@JackPosobiec jealous
@RichardTBurnett @Madison133Patti Florida
This guy could careless about the people he represents in CT. He is about resisting, santuary state hood, and control. https://t.co/lws3GiesGb
It's all coming out, I think the floor will fall out and all will be exposed in Oct. no proof just a feeling, we will have to wait and see https://t.co/PVUJ4SLn8h
Let's make sure the truth is spread and the lies are stomped out! https://t.co/hfzTep3ENl
was just reading the NWO agenda 2030, they need to overcome countries with a middle-class population, these countries including ours. This is why we are seeing so many dems losing their minds. This explains the drastic change to the democratic party went into effect Jan 1, 2016😖
@dbongino we have to remember he is the puppet of soro's and NWO, they're one goal is to divide and conquer, he promised we would be part of the NWO by 2021, but that failed when Trump got elected, now they're hoping but 2030 is it.
Some Americans would rather have a lawyer represent the country, which we all know they are polished and speaks with fork tongues in order to win no matter what side they're on. Trump is who we wanted and he's getting the job done! no pc, just what it is.... The Truth
@elizabethforma he won't do the damage your trying to do! he is for the constitution, your not!
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Funny you say that but you don't practice it, instead, you resist, your disrespect for our president shouts volumes. remember what you spread will come back on you and I think it will be sooner than later.
@elizabethforma Elizabeth you are a vile women, who live in a very wealthy community, yet you give nothing but a foul mouth. you have done nothing for the state you represent, instead your to busy running around spewing lies, and worst yet you are trying to destroy our constitution.
@raptorhead @LesTemplar His family announced that he was stopping his meds, one day and the next he's dead, this interview proves that it wasn't the cancer that killed him. people don't usually die that quickly after stopping treatment, doctors don't usually wait that late into the treatment to stop.
@SenSchumer Just showed that you have no respect for the process and will stoop lowest of all levels. you have proven that security and privacy has no merits with you and other democrats, that you will disclose anything that you feel will advance your agenda
@GOP If he and she and others are willing to disclose information that is marked for security reasons just to put on a show, then they deserve to be fired, it also shows that people's privacy is in jeopardy. it turned out that they had released the paper before he released it public
Listen Closely, Did John just say "24 hrs since John McCain put to Death"? https://t.co/ua4FUzvlib
