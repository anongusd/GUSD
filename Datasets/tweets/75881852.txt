@OsoChic81 @Sifill_LDF As a non-Virginian, just an observing human,  it would appear the photo is two racists depicting something highly racist.  I wouldn't differentiate which was "worse".  But I will defer to your understanding as part of that community.
@OsoChic81 @Sifill_LDF But being in the photo as it's composed makes it irrelevant who is who.  He's not less racist in blackface with the KKK guy, than dressing as the KKK guy.

@MattOswaltVA I find it bizarre it would matter.  Is one of those better than the other?  Doesn't choosing it for your yearbook page in medical school as a representation of the fun you've had indicate you're racist as hell and tone deaf about it?
@KarenAttiah I am convinced that there are a hell of a lot of people who don't and have never accepted that the South lost the Civil War,  that the war isn't over, that there's been a lull in the action,  and they are itching to finish what their ancestors stated.
