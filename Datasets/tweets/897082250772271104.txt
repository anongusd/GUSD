@WalshFreedom You mean the highest *marginal* rate? Since the 1980s we have allowed tax cut after tax cut to the wealthy...and we have made temporary tax cuts permanent. This created a class of people who simply inherit passive income and wealth. Taken too far, this is corrosive to democracy.
@marcorubio Open the government, have a policy debate, and put wall funding to a vote. And never forget that the U.S once welcomed Latin American refugees - not with walls but with open arms. Their children made us stronger. Some of them now serve in the U.S. Senate!
