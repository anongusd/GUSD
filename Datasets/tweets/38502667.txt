@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su Oh neat, now you're twisting my words that never suggested Bernie is responsible for his moronic supporters like the two of you
@LOatheANDbehold @GradySteiner17 @jules_su weeeeeee more revisionism
@GradySteiner17 @CariniGambarini @jules_su Remove the log from your own eye before you comment about the speck in mine
@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su His policy won't work because it's not financially feasible, and he knows that but doesn't care. I don't like him because he doesn't have a realistic policy, but please keep attempting to editorialize my position because I dare disagree with "Saint Bernie"
@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su oh neat, now you're going to try to gaslight me and tell me that the guy who was saying I'm an insane loon has no issue with my not buying Bernie Sanders - and instead only started saying those things after he engaged in meaningful policy debate		lololol
@LOatheANDbehold @GradySteiner17 @jules_su lol not "his" policy, but nice attempted revisionism
@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su and instead of trying to sell me on Bernie, please keep telling me what a fucking moron I am for not blindly buying his bullshit. 		that'll definitely work this time around!
@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su I'm not parroting anyone, I'm talking for myself. 		But I guess it's easier to try to dismiss that as "parroting" someone else on twitter than actually examining why lots of people (who didn't vote for Bernie, which is why he didn't win the primary) may not actually like him

@LOatheANDbehold @GradySteiner17 @jules_su He has no substantive record in Congress, no allies in Congress, his big "policy platforms" are DOA, and he couldn't win a primary against a "historically unlikable candidate" - but you're right, there are no "actual issues" with Bernie

@GradySteiner17 @CariniGambarini @jules_su And obviously I'm criticizing him, so keep pointing out how you're a hypocrite!
@LOatheANDbehold @GradySteiner17 @jules_su His record is a joke
@GradySteiner17 @CariniGambarini @jules_su Bernie is a narcissist. He couldn't win a primary in 2016, he wont' win a primary in 2020, but keep pretending that his detractors are just delusional and whatnot - certainly lends credibility to your cause
@GradySteiner17 @CariniGambarini @jules_su You literally have not offered a position, but keep being a hypocritical hack!

@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su ps - maybe the reason he couldn't get shit done is because no one can tolerate his grandstanding narcissistic ass. 		god forbid we expect a politician to do more than elevate himself and actually get meaningful legislation through Congress
@CariniGambarini @GradySteiner17 @jules_su hahahaha bernie sanders is a protest candidate who was never held accountable by the voters of vermont. 		and if you want to bitch about cronyism, look at how he voted on where to put F-35s (hint: in Vermont)

@TampaBayAJ @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt oh for four
@TampaBayAJ @WilvoJobs @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Property tax doesn't protect the poor because the poor generally don't own property.
@TampaBayAJ @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Hahaha "regressive taxes like income taxes" he says, before waxing poetic about property taxes.

@EireannDolan @MikeIsaac @Instacart @DoorDash Ah yes, because you've certainly showed a command of the facts surrounding the impact start-up delivery services have on the elderly and disabled populations, who obviously only live in the markets currently served by these companies (and are known for being early adopters)

@a_just_john @jessesingal yeah maybe retraction makes sense if certain conditions aren't met, like him providing greater context, maybe showing some contrition or evolvement, etc.
@a_just_john @BertrandTeap @shutter_j @jessesingal but there are lots of holes with the reporting. like how it focuses on "desisters" who say, 'welp i'm not trans!' rather than desisters who made their decision as the result of parents, bullies, etc.
@BertrandTeap @a_just_john @shutter_j @jessesingal maybe because it's harmful to trans kids ?
@a_just_john @BertrandTeap @shutter_j @jessesingal No, the pointing to the thread didn't claim to be about factual errors. Just because you infer it must be about factual errors (because that's how Jesse framed it) doesn't mean Grace or Adam ever said as much

@HoarseWisperer evergreen tweet
@BertrandTeap @a_just_john @shutter_j @jessesingal I'm sure lots of trans people would gladly trade *their* exhaustion for facing criticism on twitter over an article they published
@a_just_john @jessesingal I'm not arguing that it should be retracted - I'm saying that Jesse doesn't seem to be learning from this, and certainly doesn't seem interested in building a better rapport with the trans community
@a_just_john @BertrandTeap @shutter_j @jessesingal The original thread points out all of these criticisms - of the article, his defense, etc. That he then points to the thread here and says, 'but it didn't say I had any factual errors!' veers into nefariousness
@a_just_john @jessesingal If the ostensible underlying argument of Jesse's piece is that , 'transition may do some kids some harm, so it should be approached with caution' - I am not sure how one can argue that an article that may do harm shouldn't be treated remotely similarly
@a_just_john @jessesingal Counter criticism from other people is not the same thing as owning up to, 'you know, I learned more, and here's how my views have evolved'
@BertrandTeap @shutter_j @a_just_john @jessesingal There is something nefarious going on - which is how he continues down this path of "who will think of the [maybe not?] trans kids!?" and uses the really bad and inappropriate critics to shield him from the very real and valid criticism of his work.

@EileenIcel @cmclymer nooooo you didn't get enough slices of the delicious ham and pineapple pizza?
@a_just_john @jessesingal It's not just bad framing. The tweet thread (and many of the responses to his article, https://t.co/taZlA2piOB) point out how he's basically second-guessing (or maybe gaslighting) these trans kids, and that *can be* and *is* harmful to many trans youth

@a_just_john @jessesingal The framing is bad though. That's the big problem everyone has with the article, along with how the 'facts' are selectively chosen. And if the framing can't or won't evolve or improve, if the counter criticism can't be included in a follow up, then maybe retraction makes sense
@Rschooley You left out the company that makes his orange paint
@a_just_john @jessesingal Shot full of holes means doesn't stand up to criticism, and there's a lot of valid criticism of the piece and Jesse's writings on trans kids, detransition, etc. - as well as how he apparently frames his critics (some of whom clearly go overboard)
@shutter_j My so-called expose thread? Also, don't flatter yourself. I searched your tweets for mentions of "trans" - found the one, and commented. 		But keep pretending that you're not mad here as you continue to tell me to fuck off, that I'm slut shaming, that I'm not a "true" feminist
@shutter_j You should try it sometime!
@shutter_j None of this is remotely true, but you probably felt good writing it, didn't you?		"On his dick" is an American expression that has nothing to do with slut-shaming (despite your repeated attempts to make it so). It just means excessively praising (https://t.co/ssAojGnMot)

@shutter_j It's not.
@shutter_j that's not slut shaming, go after all the dick in the world - nothing wrong with that, as long as it's consensual and safe!
@a_just_john @jessesingal Something can be "100% factually correct" and still be wrong/bad/whatever for other reasons.
@a_just_john @jessesingal Generally speaking, no that's not what "this should not be allowed to stand" means.
@shutter_j I didn't tell you what to think, I just criticized your take on allyship. 		Boo fucking hoo, someone disagreed with you on the internet. No wonder you're all over Jesse Singal's dick.
@brettkeller @shutter_j @a_just_john @jessesingal If only all of you cared as much about trans kids as you care about how Jesse is treated for writing about trans kids (when he's not really always writing about trans kids rather than kids experimenting with gender expression)
@shutter_j You could not have proven my point better. Thanks mate!
@shutter_j this is a bad take. the "enemy" isn't "insufficiently woke allies" - and it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask alleged allies to up their game. 		when so-called "allies" then whine that they're being too heavily policed, suggests that they're not really allies for the long-haul.

@DanCrenshawTX @IlhanMN aw the little freshmen Congressmen doesn't understand that *his party's president* owns the shut down and said so himself. 		guess he doesn't realize yet that Congress could simply override and Trump veto and re-open themself, but I guess then he couldn't virtue signal about Dems
@tplskylrk @RegenaBryant7 @philipaklein she actually didn't, which is why i'm sure you'll never support that claim
@tplskylrk @RegenaBryant7 @philipaklein so her "action" here of having a photo with an activist is worse than Steve King's continued defense of his racist comments? 		and that fact he's voted (an action) based on his racist views is somehow "less important" than this photo?		keep proving my point though
@Rschooley Then he'll just do it on TV from the Oval Office, inbetween bites of leftover Big Macs

@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 GOOD THING THERE ARE MORE WAYS TO ADDRESS WEALTH INEQUALITY THAN JUST TAKING ALL THE WEALTH FROM RICH PEOPLE
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 I make more than twice as much as your family, which means I must make twice as good decisions, right?
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 NO LIFE ISN'T A ROUGH TEACHER IF YOU ONLY MAKE SUPER GOOD DECISIONS LIKE I DO BECAUSE I AM SMART AND NOT POOR
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Oh so your opinion is more valid than the opinion of the United States legal system? 		How modest of you.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Nice deflection, but we're not talking about China. If you say wealth inequality doesn't matter, than provide some substance to your argument other than, 'it doesn't matter'
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 No, he can't. That was the point of the anti-trust settlement.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Did I say he did?
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 wealth itself and the presence of wealth inequality are not inherently "bad" - but *why* there is wealth inequality *does* matter.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Bill Gates also violated anti-trust law. Weird how you leave that part out, but that's probably because you weren't even born when that case was settled.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 You haven't proven anything except your propensity for making strawman arguments and editorialization. 		Wealth inequality absolutely matters in society

@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 "When a man tells you that he got rich through hard work, ask him, 'whose?'"
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 The point here is that you claiming you're "owning" someone doesn't mean you're actually owning anyone. Like Charlie, you appear to have a very basic understanding of logic
@jonrog1 @greg_doucette but who needs reasonable disagreement when you can have an insane belief that compromise is for losers and that you need to crush and demonize your political opponents? weeeeee!		*sets world on fire*
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Yes, many people make poor choices. And rich people are generally more insulated from their poor choices because of the wealth they inherit, the connections they have, and what money can buy. 		Go learn more about the fundamental attribution error
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Lol little Charlie Kirk Jr. thinks his pisspoor "argument" counts as "owning" someone.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Again, you being in HS doesn't disqualify your argument. Your lack of substance disqualifies your argument. If you think poor people are only poor because of bad decisions, you're a moron who doesn't understand that while some people are poor because of bad decisions, most aren't
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 I remember when I was a smug arrogant high school kid. I changed. Hopefully you will too.		Until you do, you have little value to add to any serious discussion.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 Hahahahaha you think drugs, partying, and misuing money are the only reasons people are poor? Nice demonstration of the fundamental attribution error.		Maybe when you're older, you'll realize many people aren't poor because of their mistakes but because of bad luck.

@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 I am not arguing against capitalism or even the accumulation of wealth, but keep trying to deflect.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 My argument isn't that you don't have the credentials I do, my argument is that your argument is poorly constructed and lacks a basis in reality.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru @Ocasio2018 You mean other than lobbying to keep wages and benefits suppressed, damaging the environment where poor people live, demanding tax breaks that decrease revenues for programs/services that'd benefit the poor, etc.?

@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru lol you don't understand economics if you don't understand the difference between supply and demand curves and quantity supplied/demanded
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Before something is invented, no one knows what that something is. But lots of things are invented that no one wants. Simply inventing something doesn't mean it'll ever be in demand. 		People will demand something better than Lasik once it's created, regardless of Lasik supply.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Guess you can't read either since you think I went to Georgetown.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru I never said they didn't. 		But that doesn't change that people who don't need Lasik will never want it, regardless of the price or quantity supplied (because supply doesn't create demand, it just changes the quantity demanded).
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, it's obvious that your highschool and Prager U education haven't equipped you with a solid understanding of basic economic ideas
@Mediaite @Julio_Rosas11 Trump waited two years to visit and only did so after enough negative coverage. Then when he did go, he lied to them and used them as political props. 		He doesn't get credit for finally showing up and doing it this way.
@MarkAgee but did she succeed?
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Hahahaha if you don't understand the distinction made in that tweet, you don't understand the basics of economics.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru People didn't want Lasik, they wanted to see better - that demand already existed, and its limited to people with bad vision. People with perfect vision won't want Lasik, even if there's an unlimited free supply of it.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru There is a difference in supply and demand, and the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded. 		The price of Lasik influences the quantity supplied and quantity demanded, but bad vision determines the overall market demand.
@kodykempff @realDonaldTrump I already concluded you were a troll not worth engaging with, have a good one!
@kodykempff @realDonaldTrump you're just trolling now if you think that Trump's policies on immigration are not that different from Obama's
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru The supply of Lasik eye surgery did not create the demand for better vision.
@kodykempff @realDonaldTrump Immigration policy changes rather than a symbolic and useless border wall
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru The Roadster had a very limited product run and priced most people out of the market - that "supply" doesn't create demand for other cars. 		Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands made deposits for the Model 3 before there was any supply - proving you don't need supply to have demand.
@realDonaldTrump Except your solution is moronic, unlike Obama's
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru No, you don't. The Tesla Model 3 is a perfect example of how you're wrong.
@drskyskull wearing a diaper and soiling yourself as an adult to own the libs, said no one ever (except Charlie Kirk and the Free Beacon)
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru If there wasn't a demand for it, people wouldn't have bought it. As Henry Ford famously said, people didn't want a car - they wanted a faster horse. The "demand" wasn't for a car, it was for faster transit. 		The same applies to touchscreen phones, smartwatches, etc.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Tesla or Lexus doesn't "generate demand" for cars anymore than Cadillac.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru And Ford created a supply of Edsels, and yet no one demanded them. Just because companies make things doesn't magically mean customers will want them. 		There already was a demand for smartphones before Apple created the iPhone - they just made a great one, so people wanted it.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru I've done graduate level econ work kid, I don't need a basic econ book to understand that Apple creating a supply of iPhones didn't create the demand for smartphones.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Hahahahahaha that's not how supply and demand work, especially for drugs.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru No, it won't. Your argument hinges on a multi-billion dollar industry just "giving up" because there's suddenly a border wall. Use common sense and think a little harder - a wall won't mean they'll suddenly find another line of work.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha you have no idea how the drug markets work, and your arguments show as much. Drugs come in to the country in every way possible - a border wall won't make it impossible or even make a dent in the drug trade.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Hahahahahaha the United States has been "fighting the supply" for decades, and yet, overdoses continue to go up. Fighting the supply doesn't work, all it does is make it more financially lucrative for the drug cartels you're decrying.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru It's obvious that a house is a really bad analogy for the southern border, and yet you made it anyway
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru You know even less about drugs than you do immigration. The 72k deaths statistic you cite is *all overdoses* tracked by the CDC, which includes heroin and *EVERY OTHER DRUG*		If you want to stop overdoses, you fight the demand for drugs - not the supply.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru lol because if drug cartels can build miles of tunnels, they definitely can't figure out how to get through a wall lololololol
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru No, it won't make it nearly impossible to cross (and the wall is physically impossible to build along long stretches of the border). 		Meanwhile, Israel is not the same as the USA. It's a bad analogy. And if a wall makes it near impossible to cross, why does Israel use troops?
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Did you even read the article?
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru The argument is the border wall is a moronic idea that won't solve the problem of land crossings, which aren't as big a contributor to the illegal immigrant population as overstayed work visas. 		But tell me more about the Trump crackdown on student visas and how that's on topic
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru And yet Trump hires illegals to work on his own properties. Weird how you're not sharing links to *those* articles.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru So if you have two problems, you'd rather spend a lot of money *attempting* to solve the smaller problem with a solution that won't actually work, instead of paying any attention to the bigger problem instead?		Let alone ignoring the reasons why people are migrating?
@MatthewBoedy @realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru TLDR: if Charlie Kirk is talking, he's probably lying or misrepresenting the facts.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru Go learn what percent of those illegal immigrants cross illegally versus overstay their visa, then come back to the discussion.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru You're moving the goal posts kid. You claimed all these immigrants are coming over land, then you yourself provide proof that a lot of them aren't coming over land. 		Meanwhile, a lot of those illegal Mexicans are simply overstaying visas - so the wall does nothing about them.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru No, I disagree with plenty of people who aren't dumb. Dinesh D'Souza and Charlie Kirk specifically are morons, and generally so are the people who believe what those two charlatans say.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru It appears you need to study up on geography and math. On *your* list of 10 countries, you claim the majority are Central and South American when HALF are Asian?!?!?!		And there is only one South American country (Ecuador) on that list.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA @prageru I guess that explains why you're dumb enough to follow Dinesh D'Souza and Charlie Kirk
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA The migrants aren't from South America. Instead of pimping @PragerU you should go to a local community college and learn something

@A_Bro_LIncoln @HoarseWisperer it's twitter, it's almost impossible to tell these days :P
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA Except the easiest points to cross already have barriers, guards, etc. The natural barriers serve as their own deterrent. And people who want to come will find a way, which is why most just overstay their visa, because that's the 'easiest common sense' way to become an illegal.
@KrangTNelson I have only ever had one guy look through my collection of books. I am clearly doing something wrong
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA There is already a barrier, and expanding a barrier doesn't stop illegal immigration. Most immigrants don't cross the land border, so you're in favor of a giant waste of money instead of an actual solution.
@realArnoldYao @MikeLevinCA No, they don't need to do that to pass a bill to re-open the government. The Senate doesn't have to fund "the wall" that Trump said Mexico would pay for in order to re-open the government, and they can get a lot of support from Dems if they just put funding in for border security

@EricPerless @DavidOAtkins How is insolvency an easier issue to fix than 401(k)'s? Both are tied to the market, and a Social Wealth Fund would be too (among other assets, like real estate).
@DavidOAtkins @EricPerless Very few investments offer a guaranteed RoR, and those that do can only guarantee a fairly low RoR. 		The "guarantees" offered by pension plans are why those pension plans are now teetering on insolvency (despite strong market returns over the past several years)
@EricPerless @DavidOAtkins There's not really a problem with using the market for retirement (though how the market is used matters). Annuities are generally a rip-off, and many pensions (which use the market) are teetering on insolvency. The only other way to build wealth is real estate (or other assets)
@EricPerless @DavidOAtkins There's already a retirement annuity called Social Security.
@DavidOAtkins Reducing stock prices doesn't fix the economy, and there are a lot more ways to fix the economy (which I take you mean as "wealth inequality") without tanking the market.
@SeanMcElwee The half of America that owns stocks are all losing a good bit of money today, and that half of America isn't all in the 1%.
@peterfeld @DavidKlion @SeanMcElwee And you're ignoring the point here, which is that Bernie appealed to a group of people to whom Trump also appealed. While we could call those voters flawed all day long, you're doing Bernie a disservice if you don't examine why *Bernie* appealed to those same voters.
@peterfeld @DavidKlion @SeanMcElwee You called them "right-wing" Dems when the article clearly says: "Party seems to have had something to do with it ‚Äî Sanders-Trump voters were much less likely than Sanders-Clinton or Sanders-third party voters to have been Democrats."

@nberlat @JHWeissmann @DavidKlion @ben_geier @peterfeld @SeanMcElwee You could say the same about Obama and Clinton in 2008, and yet Obama managed to beat the entrenched candidate.
@DavidOAtkins I'm not moving the goalposts. You can't achieve anything resembling dem socialism progress if the candidates can't get elected. And I don't hate dem socialism, but please keep telling me more about myself because you want to editorialize and villify.
@DavidOAtkins I think most politics exists in the grey rather than not
@DavidOAtkins 2018 showed that the "revolutionary democrats" can't win elections - so they can either try running on that ideology again in 2020 or try pulling some people off the center by appealing to *them.* 		Saying, 'our ideas are better than yours you sellout' doesn't do that.
@DavidOAtkins I don't think everything is a "purity test." Democrats have always been a coalition party, not an ideological one - which means we should accept that people are going to disagree on things, like what are the biggest priorities, what's the best solution to some issue, etc.
@nberlat @JHWeissmann @DavidKlion @ben_geier @peterfeld @SeanMcElwee Ignoring that "anti-war" Bernie has no problem lobbying for the F-35's to be partially built in Vermont, the main reason he lost is because Dem voters didn't believe he'd actually accomplish anything in his platform. Adding more stuff to it now doesn't make him more electable
@DavidOAtkins I do give a shit about inequality. I'm also a millennial. And the big corporation I work for helps me pay my bills, my student debt, and still have a nice life. 		Being "pro-business" doesn't mean "pro-plutocrat" - but keep proving my point about purity tests.
@DavidOAtkins "The oppression of student loans" implies that someone went to college and took out substantive loans to pay for it. Almost 60% of young adults do. not. attend. college. But doctors and lawyers would make out like bandits with student loan forgiveness.
@KDJ85 @DavidOAtkins Sure it is. If we think people shouldn't be eating microwave ramen noodles every night, how do we fix that? Some solutions are better than others, but there's no "right" response - unlike with a question like 'do LGBT people deserve equal rights?'

@DavidOAtkins Because economics has a lot more grey than LGBT rights, and I think it's a false equivalency to compare the two?		(I also think foreign policy / defense falls into this same bucket too, not just economics)
@DavidOAtkins I'm going to ignore the "you people" bit, because I'm not sure what group of people I'm supposed to be a part of here. 		Also not sure how you can claim to be tired of the "purity tests" when the argument being put forth here is "Beto isn't progressive enough" or "as progressive"
@minakimes BAKER MAYFIELD!

@VABVOX pro-life policies are things like neonatal health care, maternity and paternity leave, daycare, etc. 		being anti-abortion isn't "pro-life" - it's just stupid and ineffective, like abstinence only sex ed. people need to stop letting republicans frame the narrative
@AnaiekSounds @cvermar @ParkerMolloy they believed the lie 2 or 3 years ago, this doesn't change anything. 		meanwhile, a lot of Americans in the middle saw how weak and petty Trump is - everyone knows the kid who took his ball home on the playground, and now they can see that's Trump

@j_wizzles @americanmaltese @pescami (let's ask DC about that)
@j_wizzles @americanmaltese @pescami guess it's time for Dems to make more states then - i'm sure Republicans will be totally cool with that, right?
@americanmaltese @raaadaniel @pescami no, it isn't. if the house of representatives was expanded, that would be different - but it hasn't been
@americanmaltese @pescami Yeah, it does - because the House of Representatives isn't proportional to population (just like the electoral college isn't), though both are more representative than the Senate.
@ArrDubsDee @s_mayta @pescami @Kragar_LGF which is supported by an understanding of American history and the limits of the foresight of the founding fathers
@americanmaltese @pescami because some states have more people than others, and neither Senators nor Representatives are proportional? 		my vote in Texas counts as a fraction of what someone's vote in a Dakota counts for - but keep telling me how that doesn't matter to "democracy"

@dfcornwell @amandakhurley lol
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley No, it wasn't. Nothing I said remotely resembles your strawman argument
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley This is another stupid take.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley No, it's not where I was going. Nice strawman though.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley I think it's fair just to expect people to pay their fair share of taxes moving forward, and to stop letting the rich engage in tax avoidance schemes.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Lol. The rich lobby Congress to pass tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit... the rich. They can buy a lot more Congressmen than poor people can. 		But keep telling everyone how the rich deserve every cent they have while they kick sick people off healthcare.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley A lot more than you think, especially if that wealth is inherited from before WWII
@DavidOAtkins Xenophobes and racists are Trump's path through the midterms. They're the people who will support him to the end
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley I never said anyone - but there are a lot of people who broke the law (and did get away with it), or a lot of people who didn't break the law, but were unethical nevertheless. 		That doesn't mean every rich person is evil, but they're definitely not victims of "class warfare"
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Capitalism is good, and better than the alternatives - but let's not pretend like a lot of people don't take advantage of others when given the chance, because they do.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Then we've got the standard corporate raiders, the shareholders who had Reagan loosen regulations so that companies started buying back trillions of dollars worth of shares (rather than paying their workers more, or creating new jobs, etc.)
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Did you never learn about the Robber Barons in US history class?!?! Did you not pay attention when all the Enron and Tyco execs went to jail? How about all these bankers who committed mortgage fraud and caused a recession?
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley I didn't say anything like that at all. All I propose is that you acknowledge that "wealth" is not necessarily earned through the individual (or their ancestors) hard work and business acumen - it was often just taken through greed and exploitation.
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley This is a stupid take.

@dfcornwell @amandakhurley When a man tells you he got rich off hard work, ask him "Whose?"
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Also, how do you think the wealthy became/become wealthy? It's not always (or maybe even often) just hard work and good ideas
@dfcornwell @amandakhurley Who said anything about class warfare? (I didn't).
@HeyManBabylon @amandakhurley Also that dude is trying to sell his services (via referral links and/or affiliate bonuses) when all that information is already on the internet for free
@HeyManBabylon @amandakhurley I am very familiar with credit card sign-up bonuses (I've received 14 over the last two years). That's not an accessible method to people who don't have that much spend, and if you say, "manufactured spend" - then guess who that cost gets spread to?

@OlSavageLarry @TealNoah23 @ope_sayer @AprilDelRario To decry these protesters while celebrating the history of the Confederacy is an inconsistent position.

@xtriadx @RenegadeSci It has everything to do with the statue you dolt. There's a reason so many statues went up at this time, and it has nothing to do with reconciliation - it has to do with Jim Crow. 		Read the history you claim to care so deeply about. 		https://t.co/BQFK8oiLjo
@OlSavageLarry @TealNoah23 @ope_sayer @AprilDelRario I went to UNC, did you? And when I was there, I didn't tear the statue down. I didn't tear it down tonight either.

@OlSavageLarry @TealNoah23 @ope_sayer @AprilDelRario I understand, thanks for the patronizing lecture. It appears you have been "educated" too. Meanwhile, the History Department wanted to move it - and the university administration didn't. That's an objective position, rather than the subjective one you're trying to frame it as.

@WayneThomas__ @MSNBC HAHAHA YOU REALIZE THE CONSTITUTION EXISTS IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO DESTROY THE EAST INDIA TRADING COMPANY'S TEA, RIGHT?!?!
@greg_doucette There's some rich irony in lecturing about the rule of law, especially given that the treasonous Confederates were fighting to keep slavery legal.
@WayneThomas__ @MSNBC You can stop with the slippery slope and the false analogies, because a statue commemorating racism is not the same thing as a degree or an institution. 		Note how the kids all went home after the statue came down. It's done. Bye now.
@TealNoah23 @OlSavageLarry Also, you can easily learn about history from a book or a class. You don't need a statue on a prominent place on campus. The university should've moved it, but they didn't - so the students did the job for them. 		It was long overdue.
@TealNoah23 @OlSavageLarry Silent Sam and the Jim Crow era statues like him *WERE* an attempt to rewrite history. An attempt to reframe the war and those who fought it as noble, rather than bigots who wanted to defend slavery. These statues were reminders to blacks about who was 'really' in charge.
@UNC Ya'll should've just ignored the bigoted NC GOP and removed it yourselves. 		- alumnae from class of 2006
@xtriadx nope. the NC GOP should apologize for forcing the students to do that though

@KrangTNelson that is one third the cost of joining the super secret Mike Cernovich Gorilla Mindset Network - but 10000x the value
@WayneThomas__ @MSNBC The Confederacy tried to destroy the United States so slave owners could keep people in bondage. Then they tried to rewrite history 50 years after the Civil War by trying to make it about something other than preserving slavery.		This is a long overdue righting of a wrong.
@deckkthehalls @WRAL delete this tweet becky
@rudepundit Trump is the kinda guy who is mad that keeps getting mad because his DVR runs out of space too soon
@WayneThomas__ @MSNBC Guess what - they didn't put that on the statue. It is available for all to read in the library (or online), just like I did. 		So everyone can still know that fact (and many more will know it now that the statue is gone). 		Stop being blind my friend
@BNiederer @owillis this is definitely something they did not teach us growing up in the south. 		i wonder why.....
@WayneThomas__ @MSNBC As a UNC grad, I know exactly what the statue represents. I'm going to guess you don't - and that you've never heard Julian Carr's speech when it was erected. 		That was a monument to Jim Crow, not to the Confederate dead. 		You're the blind one here friend.
@MSNBC Good riddance. If the NC GOP wasn't a bunch of bigoted cowards, the university could've moved the statue to a less prominent place on campus. 		They forced the students to tear it down, and now the NC GOP will probably threaten to impeach them too
@nILFeed @DougHeye @jaketapper The entire UNC campus is historic and related to the south and worth keeping. 		Silent Sam wasn't one of those things, especially in such a prominent place on campus.
@ashleyfeinberg i hate you for [almost] ruining bacon for me
@radleybalko @Popehat worst tinder profile ever
@DemonNinjaLlama @KatzOnEarth I grew up in North Carolina. I went to UNC. I know the story of the statue. This had nothing to do with the Civil War generation dying off. 		The reason statues were going up around this time was because of the rise of Jim Crow laws, not because of respect for dead Confederates
@owillis woop woop! this is better than winning that last national championship!
@DemonNinjaLlama @KatzOnEarth This was a marker celebrating Jim Crow. It wasn't about remembering the dead - otherwise they would've put it up anytime in the previous 50 years since the Civil War had ended. 		If the NC GOP wasn't a bunch of bigoted cowards, they would've moved it to a museum.

@Sickandtired17 @ComfortablySmug @KurtSchlichter The Bush White House admitted that the ship was within helicopter range.

@jmathishmc_jeff @Sickandtired17 @KurtSchlichter @ComfortablySmug Don't get it twisted. I have never said anything resembling disrespect or 'smack' about those who serve or have served.
@KurtSchlichter For what? Pointing out something that Bush himself admitted was a bad look?
@Sickandtired17 @ComfortablySmug @KurtSchlichter Bush's fighter jet landing was about optics. Using the Lincoln as the setting for the speech was about optics. Politics is mostly about optics.
That is not a typo. This movie would've made more money if they put the production budget into scratch-and-win tickets. https://t.co/uCVh8Ek7xE
@SamMarlow79 @Sickandtired17 @ComfortablySmug @KurtSchlichter And yet, later Bush himself would say hanging the banner was a mistake. 		But keep blaming the media for everything.
@Sickandtired17 @ComfortablySmug @KurtSchlichter I'm aware that the banner was intended for the crew. However, whether meant for the crew or not, optics matter - which is why this ended up being a self-own for Bush.
