@TheDemocrats You underestimate our disgust with you now just as you did in 2016.	You pimp women for political gain alienating real women and alienatet men with your latest attempt to undo the 2016 election and delegitimize our votes.	More of you will be voted out in November.	Count on it. https://t.co/t30KZjYX9q
@Amy_Siskind @LindseyGrahamSC The hypocrisy is stunning. Democrats all came out within hours of Kavanaugh being named the nominee and publicly declared their 'No" vote before the first document was viewed or the first question was asked at the hearing. They've been reminding us multiple times daily since.

@alfortish @poeticlargess @elianayjohnson @JessicaHeddings Her entire cyber- and social media presence was scrubbed by her prior to WaPo being 'leaked' her info by Feinstein. 		What happened to innocent until proven guilty? Her claims are completely unsubstantiated and so-called "witnesses" named by her, deny anything like this happened.
@cardozo969 @EdWhelanEPPC @earlp1231 She scrubbed her cyber-presence before WaPo ever got the 'leak' from Feinstein. She doesn't want the FBI investigating. She was no doubt told it would go away and Kavanaugh would withdraw. Also, who's making these alleged 'death threats' after she scrubbed her cyber-presence?

@gmh8899 @tribelaw There is no "charge". There is someone coming forward 30+ years later with an unsubstantiated claim and no evidence supporting it.		SHE is hoping that the FBI doesn't investigate. It gives her an "out" for testifying at the hearing UNDER OATH, carefully orchestrated by Feinstein.

@BhamWeekly @SenBlumenthal @ChuckGrassley Rushed?		Kagan was nominated by Obama in May, 2010. She was confirmed August, 2010 and mid-terms were November, 2010.	Sotomayor was nominated by Obama in May, 2009 and confirmed in August, 2009.		But for Democrat obstruction, #Kavanaugh would have been confirmed last month.

@SethChurch13 @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump Let them keep believing that. They underestimated based on their emotions in 2016 and look what happened. They think we were finished in 2016. We were just getting started. 	#MAGA #Trump2020 #KeepAmericaGreat #AmericaFirst
@MagaSmith2020 @lisa_ltracy14 @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump They're focused on anything they can twist to feed their hopes. I sincerely hope that someone is with them when it all comes down around their ears so they don't hurt themselves.  They are fully expecting this to take Trump down.  Bless their hearts.
@antifashyst @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump OK.  You keep believing that.  😂🤣😂
@UngerJd @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump You seem to think Trump is being investigated. He's not. That was revealed over a year ago. In fact, you have no clue who all are being investigated, or for which crimes. I suspect the "flipping" he's doing is related to all those involved in Manafort's crimes 12+ years ago.
@5280_native @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump Are you saying that NPR is posting #FakeNews? Really?
@countingstars @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump Which changes what NPR reported...how? Perhaps you should read that again.
@MagaSmith2020 @JebBoosh @realDonaldTrump You assume they're capable of admitting that? I'm not so sure...
