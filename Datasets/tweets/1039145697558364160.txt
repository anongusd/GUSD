@krystlebobbie Thought that they where getting something better out of it not what Theresa may has been going towards
@krystlebobbie Another thing is that she has been super quite with all of her plans that she has and that leads to people thinking she's not a good leader she needs to be more vocal. People voting for brexit are not stupid either may i add Just because they had a different opinion and...
@krystlebobbie Also she kinda screwed up when she asked for that other vote she messed up big time with that. May maybe in other situation maybe better but she has dealt with just brexit really and has done a horrible job with it
@krystlebobbie I agree to an extent where its not her fault that she has to have dealt with brexit and she then hasn't really got the fairest of runs as PM but actually what she has been doing for brexit is not the thing that people actually want she's doing something people didn't vote for

@ChasingOzPhotog Ok but what about trans people you seem to forget about trans women are not really able to go through birth and may want to but where does that leave their opinion on this?
@deadmeatjames How dare you have a different opinion than me i can't believe people don't always 100% agree with me I'm offended. I don't understand people lol
@SPARNI Follow plz
@SPARNI Follow plz
@nbscorpia Yeah it sucks but there are also lots of supportive people which gives me hope and makes me feel a bit better then i see stuff like that and its just like why is the world like this idk if people just don't get it or are just straight up despises us the worlds confuses me
@nbscorpia Well this is quite honestly disgusting and really scares me about coming out to more people

@goQradio @SPARNI @radiostephen @breakfastcate follow plz
@SPARNI follow plz
@guardian Ok there is a point in being no longer attracted to someone because they are trans however you said you'd love them no matter what and i can understand the view to a certain degree but you shouldn't force them to make a choice between being who they are and being what you want
I don't exactly know what full opinion at this very minute but I'm leaning more on the side of believing dr. ford but i'm not completely convinced but as it stands now that's were i am at
These allegations might be false or they could be true. They must go into this with detail which at the minute they are not which gives absolute no chance for a true answer to these allegations
Lots of people are too afraid to come out about this stuff and this situation is a perfect example of that
We can't simply dismiss allegations because they are from years ago that is completely ridiculous
And I'm not dismissing that point by saying that because Trump said it it's untrue i'm simply saying that trump has that exact same thought process so maybe sit down and think about it
you're simply dismissing something that could be just as likely true as false because she is only saying them now. These people god damn sound like Trump which we all know is an idiot because don't forget he said the exact same thing.
I always hear people talking about how the Allegations are untrue because why would she wait so long to come out with them and it is super annoying to me that people think like this.
