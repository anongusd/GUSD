@GovRonDeSantis I am confused. What I heard was that the only thing in his speech which the president actually cares about is his agenda. Stop investigating me and maybe we can cooperate to pass legislation which actually helps Americans.
@Bornabrit1 To me it sounded like the only time the President actually cared about what he was saying- his real agenda. Stop investigating me and maybe we can work together to create legislation that actual benefits Americans.
@TravisAllen02 Essentially the only thing which actual sounded like it meant something to our President was when he told us his real agenda. Stop investigating me and maybe we can work on legislation which might actually help Americans.

@ptc712 @ReedAbelson Could it have been because of provider response or the possibility that sicker Medicare patient access to providers might be impacted or that upcoding might become a bigger issue?
@JulieGunnigle Right on!
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Upcoding
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov And of course the provider community is in full support? This makes it more likely that significantly ill Medicare patients will lose access to physicians and make upcoming even more prevalent.
@shannonrwatts A Rabbi who praises himself has a congregation of one Mr. Pence.
@AllOnMedicare The current health care model is that of the for profit health care insurance with three parties. The provider of health care. The consumer of healthcare and the payor (Employer 49%/Government 35%/Self Pay 7%). 9% are uninsured. There are as many variations as there are players.
