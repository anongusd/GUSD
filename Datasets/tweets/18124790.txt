Trump still railing, now in his #CPAC speech, that his Inauguration crowd size was huge, all photos fake news.		This is a desperate man.

I just did a series of interviews at #CPAC that are mind-blowing, not because of who they are but what they said, the bizarre exchanges, and how they were all together ‚Äî a Trump-supporting NYU student leader, an anti-gay Christian and a gay Trump supporter &amp; Islamophobe.
Another long-time #cpac observer says the absence of Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch from stage is actually tied to NRA $$$ woes as well.		Says groups buy major presence on stage, giving $$ to organizers (American Conservative Union) and NRA is in $$$ free fall.
Got some intel from source here at #CPAC re: NRA presence: Money definitely the major factor if not the overriding factor.		That explains the smaller exhibition hall presence, and hardly any NRA TV presence on media row. But doesn‚Äôt really explain absence of LaPierre &amp;  Loesch.

Scott Walker told me at  #CPAC that Michael Cohen testimony was designed &amp; planned by the Democrats ‚Äî down to the day it was given ‚Äî to take attention away from Donald Trump‚Äôs breakthrough summit with Kim Jong Un.		Not kidding. Will air it on the show today 3-6 ET @SXMProgress
This could mean either that Wayne La Pierre‚Äôs and Loesch‚Äôs hate speeches at #CPAC last year which backfired ‚Äî she said media loved gun shootings you‚Äôll remember ‚Äî were too much for this year. 		Or ‚Äî the Russia connection is too hot.		Or ‚Äî both.		Low attendance at gun panel btw.
NRA‚Äôs presences is remarkably low-key to absent at #CPAC2019 		No Wayne LaPierre ‚Äî a CPAC mainstay ‚Äî or Dana Loesch,  fixture in recent years. Ollie North spoke earlier, but he has different public image, not so associated w/NRA. 		Panel right now on guns, no one from NRA.

More than that, the horrible reality of the times we are in is that a story like that which Jussie Smollett told, outrageous as it sounded, is plausible.		Just, again, look at the terrorist arrested yesterday, inspired by Trump‚Äôs hatred, making list of people to kill.
It‚Äôs grotesque and abominable when a hoax is perpetrated. It hurts the cause of civil rights and fighting hate.		But we believe victims for a reason, and in the vast majority of cases they are telling the truth and believing them was vital so that others would come forward.
He‚Äôs not the first to do this ‚Äî there was of course the #MAGA bomber.		So the idea that people who supported Trump ‚Äî who has called media ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù called Democrats enemies ‚Äî  had plotted to kill a public figure who was vocally anti-Trump is not unbelievable.
This man‚Äôs list included members of the Supreme Court, AOC, Pelosi, Beto O‚ÄôRourke, media figures, journalists and others.		He was going to kill them, which meant plotting and planning, and he was doing it in the name of Donald Trump.		Plotted for  ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù if Trump impeached.
Jussie Smollett is turning himself in. No idea of how he will defend himself. 		To Trumpers who are gleeful &amp; claimed this story was not credible from the start:		A man was arrested yesterday in Maryland, a terrorist with a list of prominent individuals he was going to kill.

@metalschaf67 @YvetteMerial @realDonaldTrump ‚Äútalk.‚Äù ???		Votes and actual statements matter. 		All Dems and 12 GOP in House voted to open govt without wall money.		4 GOP senators had called for voting w/o wall money. Actions and words matter, not gossip.
@Dog4Pat Not sure on the totality but there‚Äôs an NYT op-ed from Yale prof from a few days ago that says even in emergency no land can be seized vial eminent domain without Congress voting. The other issue might be in that piece as well.
@metalschaf67 @YvetteMerial @realDonaldTrump Yes, the mid-term elections by the largest majority in a mid-term since Watergate in the House.
It's why we have to just keep exposing, over and over, harping, pushing, no matter how tiring it is, or if you sound like broken record. Use every kind of way to shake people, shock them. 		Feels daunting, most won‚Äôt change, but again, adds up over time.
Cults are  rigid, devotion is slavish. It takes an enormous amount for people to break ‚Äî much more than in conventional reasoning. Most never do.		However, each time major light is shined ‚Äî like this wall money scam ‚Äî a very few wake. Not discernible. But adds up over long time.
@headland_delowe Totally!  it‚Äôs a cult.
@headland_delowe I agree many don‚Äôt care ‚Äî but what‚Äôs most interesting is they are not speaking on it, rebutting the exposure of the lie re: the one-time https://t.co/JMQLKG82L2‚Äôs a moment of something not computing (Most will get over it as always, but each time a few break.)
And now, instead, because we, the American people,  said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù to new money for something he said Mexico would pay for, he‚Äôs going to take the money from disaster funds via national emergency. 		That‚Äôs money from relief for fires in CA, hurricanes in PR and, yes FL and TX.
BTW, Trumpers are truly stumped on this one ‚Äî have no response to it at all. It‚Äôs been crickets		It‚Äôs a blatant lie and a deception about how he was going to use their money, and he he claimed a payment scheme that‚Äôw not happening, &amp; they don‚Äôt know what to say.		Use it on them.
@metalschaf67 @YvetteMerial @realDonaldTrump But he said Mexico would buy via ‚Äúone-time payment of $10 billion‚Äù after he cut off wire transfers to Mexico via Patriot Act rule.		That was the promise. Why hasn‚Äôt he done it and now asking Americans to foot bill?		Sorry, we won mid-term elections and won‚Äôt allow it.
@BrooklynBalmer @realDonaldTrump Yes, we know the answer. But that‚Äôs what he promised.
He‚Äôs really on the defensive about this whopper of a lie.		Said in ‚Äô16 memo Mexico would make ‚Äúone-time payment of $5-10 billion‚Äù after he changed Patriot Act rule, withholding wire transfers to Mexico.		Why hasn‚Äôt he done this? Now charging taxpayers. Trade deal can‚Äôt pay. https://t.co/PuHmqVRcKi
@realDonaldTrump Again, This is one lie that's not going to go away.		Why aren‚Äôt you doing what you said in memo in ‚Äô16 still on your site;: cut off annual remittances via wire transfers to Mexico? Said Mexico would then make  ‚Äúone-time payment of 5-10 billion." 		Why charge taxpayers now?
@realDonaldTrump Lie. You said nothing about a trade deal paying for it ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no mechanism for the still-unapproved deal to pay.		You said Mexico would make "a one-time payment of $5-10 billion payment,‚Äù after you cut off annual remittances via wire transfer.		Why haven‚Äôt you done this?

Using call to impeach against the Dems already proven weak  ‚Äî they tried this in 2018 mid-terms. Failed. Huge portion of Americans believe Trump will be impeached. Will only grow. Bill Clinton had approval in the high '60s when they impeached for no good reason. Very different.

Some have  said if he moved to second option GOP would surely step in. 		Do you trust that? Especially if choice for GOP is being gnawed at slowly or being promised that they will share in emergency powers?		Yep, this is scary.
..He moves to this dangerous plan of invoking emergency powers and orders military to build wall.  		Seems there are not many guardrails for this, there are all sorts of other powers he can grab if he does it and not many sane people left around him to stop him.
Trump will never re-open govt. Never. And more of it will shut down. 		#TrumpShutDown makes his life even easier, abdicating everything while worshiped by crazy people.		This will just be a slow gnawing at the GOP until it caves, overrides, as country crumbles. Or...

I think it‚Äôs useful in talking about the community and issues to use ‚ÄúLGBTQ‚Äù but in this instance the media is being lazy.		They should say x number of openly gay men, x number of openly  lesbian members, x number of openly bisexual members.
@maraleia I agree ‚Äî media is being lazy.
And there are no openly transgender members of Congress, so it thus makes it appear as if they‚Äôre represented when they‚Äôre not. 		It‚Äôs an interesting question. When we all call ourselves LGBTQ, aren‚Äôt we pretty much doing what only using ‚Äúgay‚Äù did 40 years ago?
All over TV they‚Äôre saying ‚Äú10 new LGBTQ members.‚Äù		Whole idea of adding new letters was so that everyone wasn‚Äôt called ‚Äúgay‚Äù and rendered invisible ‚Äî lesbians, bisexuals, trans, etc.		But by saying ‚ÄúLGBTQ‚Äù some are rendered invisible, since all of the identities aren‚Äôt defined.
It‚Äôs historic, amazing  to see 10 out gay, lesbian and  bisexual members of Congress.  		Just a few short years ago there were only two gay men (and they weren‚Äôt out when they first ran).		There's something odd and ironic however, about media using ‚ÄúLGBTQ‚Äù to describe new members

What a difference from New Year's Eve 2016. Wishing a happy one to all, and a great thanks to all for working so hard this year to bring the Blue Wave. I		In 2019, we'll still deal with horrors from Trump but we'll also be empowered. A lot of justice will be done. And...

@Real___Eric I think that‚Äôs more complicated. When you‚Äôre  member of a group, you can celebrate and critique it ‚Äî it‚Äôs not punching down.
In addition to Louis CK‚Äôs vicious mocking of the Parkland shooting victims and non-binary people, he‚Äôs using an effeminate voice in the set, which at once mocks gay men and trans women.The guy is angry, and going for easy lowest-common-denominator bashing. It‚Äôs vile.

@MayaudonJose You mean people won‚Äôt admit it ‚Äî and will later just deny they voted for him?		In that case we could see polling in 10 years where only like 15% of Americans say they voted for him.. Is that what you mean?
@IntrovertFL @TooncesDaCat True, many duped ‚Äî and still are.
@ScoobySpike That‚Äôs good.
@gtusmc05_day That‚Äôs not an answer to the question I asked.		But the claim is idiotic and really reflects poorly on you. 		You owe the rest of us an apology.
@HappyShorey that‚Äôs interesting Any particular thing that made them break?
@GregMitch That‚Äôs a good question too.
@lablea26 Wow, not really an apology. Recently?
@IntrovertFL So they said they‚Äôre sorry?  when was this?
@matthewdean616 That seems true of a lot of them for sure ‚Äî I‚Äôve said for a long time it‚Äôw a cult.

He doesn‚Äôt even actually have a clue about anything, just watches Fox News, where they fabricate, downplay, distort. Then he churns it back out on Twitter.
Just step back and look at what we have here, unprecedented: A president under govt  investigation, news continually implicating him further in crimes. 		And, every day, he‚Äôs issuing weak defenses, attacks on his own justice dept., which are informed from a propaganda network.
@soledadobrien @Reuters It‚Äôs mind-boggling what the impetus is for this. Click-bait, plain and simple? Or do they believe they‚Äôre actually being fair according to some standard they‚Äôve not clued us into?

As several have pointed out, there‚Äôs been Russian online influence reported re: thr French riots.		And don‚Äôt forget Trump already inspired a mail bomber and, via caravan hysteria, that synagogue mass shooter.
@AJPPatriot Getting my ‚Äúnews‚Äù right from his Twitter feed
@AJPPatriot Why is he claiming falsely that rioters in France support him and thus is promoting them?
Be very concerned: Trump is (falsely) claiming riots in France in support of his agenda w/chants praising him.		President of the US is supporting rioting in a foreign country, an ally. 		It‚Äôs a direct call, and the just the beginning, of encouraging his supporters to riot here.

We‚Äôve also learned, not a shocker, that Manafort lied. But also that Cohen was set to keep lying too.		He was caught, re: Trump Tower Moscow, because Mueller has other witnesses. So he caved, then told all.		This refutes Trump claim that he made stuff up to get out of it.
Meanwhile, separately, Cohen filing confirms Trump committed crime paying off 2 women for their silence.
And the whole thing blew up in all their faces.
What we‚Äôve learned this week, seen confirmed further, is that the only reason Trump wanted Russia sanctions lifted, better relations, was to build the Moscow tower. 		Russians had same interest and would then help him win, interfering in election, working  w/campaign.

Couldn‚Äôt be more vidid example of the connection between Bush 41 ‚Äî and the groundwork GOP laid for Trump ‚Äî and Trump, with his pick of Barr (GHWB‚ÄôS former attorney general). 		Barr believes in expanded exec power, thought Hillary should be investigated more &amp; Trump loves him.
