@markzbarabak Though Sen. Kamala Harris is more L.A.-based these days, and incoming Gov. Newsom lives in Marin County.
@BillSwindell @GavinNewsom @SenKamalaHarris @BarbaraBoxer Yes!
@BillSwindell @GavinNewsom @SenKamalaHarris @BarbaraBoxer And Rep. Tom McClintock (R) now represents Sierra-area House district. But he previously spent 22 years in the legislature representing Assembly and state Senate districts in Ventura/Santa Barbara counties, hundreds of miles away.
@BillSwindell @GavinNewsom @SenKamalaHarris @BarbaraBoxer Outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown (D) moved within CA (at least ) three times to run for office. The native San Franciscan started in politics on L.A. community college board, was Sacramento-based winning governship in 1974. Later became Oakland mayor, before second gubernatorial stint.
@brianros1 Yeah, really. And either the nominating or seconding speech for Gingrich came from the-Rep. Olympia Snowe, Maine, later known as a centrist senator.
@brianros1 DeLay had played that game before, too. Backed rival GOP candidate to Gingrich in 1989 minority whip race, who was seen as more of a pragmatist. Though his side lost that one, of course.
@brianros1 Ok! Actually, kind of makes sense in hindsight. Incoming GOP majority was much smaller than those Dems held for years. And Blue Dog Dema were still a considerable force in the House.
@brianros1 More info, please. Links appreciated.
@DemFromCT Likewise to you and your family! Interesting times we're living through.
@jimantle Sounds about right. That was the last time Tennessee went Dem in a presidential race -- though only by a 48-46% margin in a three-way contest.
@HowardMortman Michael Landon!
@kkondik Prior to Burr's election, his seat turned over consecutively in 1974, 1980, 1986, 1992 and 1998. Four of those saw incumbents defeated. But yes, it's been stable since Burr won in 2004.
@jimantle "Win-win" doesn't exactly come to mind here.
@mirandayaver @ethanjweiss Wish I could say the same, at least on the bread part. Laying off potatoes would be annoying, but not debilitating.
@jimantle After his 2016 GOP primary performance, I'm not so sure about this. Florida gubernatorial wins in 1998/2002 were against relatively weak Dem opponents and he was never really tested at the highest levels of national politics.

If he runs for Senate for Utah, Mitt Romney would be first defeated presidential nominee to seek lower elected office since Walter Mondale pinch-hit -- and lost -- in 2002 MN Senate race. After White House bids Barry Goldwater and Hubert Humphrey won back their old Senate seats.
Retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has been on both the fun and business ends of Senate majorities several times.	Minority -- 1977-81;	Majority 1981-87;	Minority, 1987-95;	Majority, 1995-2001;	Minority, 2001-2003;	Majority, 2003-2007;	Minority, 2007-2015;	Majority, 2015-present.
If former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) runs for and wins Utah Senate seat in 2018, he'll be among a small group to hold statewide office in two different states.

Sen.-elect Doug Jones (D-Ala.) leading vanquished GOP rival Roy Moore by 0.7%. That's outside of 0.5% automatic statewide recount trigger. If margin holds, denies Senate Republicans chance to drag out seating of Jones.
Doug Jones will join soon-to-be Democratic Senate colleagues Chris Coons (Del.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) in having some of the best timing in political history.
Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, shunned Roy Moore from the start. Looking pretty good right about now.
After Steve Bannon flameout in Alabama Senate race, ex-Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) can't be liking his comeback chances.
This will be the third time over the past 17 years with the narrowest possible 51-49 Senate majority. R-to-D majority 2001-03, GOP majority from 2003-05, and 51-49 Dem majority from 2007-09.
In February 2010, Senate Republicans pushed for Sen.-elect Scott Brown of Massachusetts to be seated ASAP on eve of health care vote. Senate Dems will do the same now for Sen.-elect Doug Jones of Alabama with tax overhaul legislation moving to votes on final passage.
Sen.-elect Doug Jones of Alabama will join Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards as the only statewide elected Democratic officials in the Deep South.
Voter coalition for Doug Jones was first sought by Artur Davis in 2010 Dem gubernatorial primary. Wrong candidate and election cycle, but this has been in Dem strategists' sights for awhile. Basically, huge black turnout and enough crossover white appeal.

Departing Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), since taking office in January 1965, has served in the House with 6 future vice presidents. Then-Reps. Gerald Ford (R-Mich.), George H.W. Bush (R-Texas), Dan Quayle (R-Ind.), Al Gore (D-Tenn.), Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Mike Pence (R-Ind.).
Departing Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who took office in January 1965, is the last House member to have served with two future presidents -- Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-Mich.), from 01/1965-Dec. 1973, and Rep. George H.W. Bush (R-Texas), from 1967-71.
Rep. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) is leaving House with the third-longest tenure ever, at 52 years, 334 days. That's also good for the sixth longest time in Congress, including those who served in both House and Senate. https://t.co/dSGKZUDj7y

Trump has moved from calling opponent "Secretary Clinton" in the first debate to "her" in the second.

Trump "locker room talk" line approaching Marco Rubio level of repetition.
HRC channeling President Obama in suggesting Trump is qualitatively different from past GOP nominees in what they say is unfitness to serve.
Trump" "This was locker room talk. i'm not proud of it."
