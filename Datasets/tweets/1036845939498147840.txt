@BigFitz66 @neomort @realDonaldTrump Won't take much effort.

@EllenSpivak @imillhiser @SenSchumer @blue @GOP Yes because let's sink the ship we're all on.
@realDonaldTrump Good puppet
@HuffPost They're obviously Russian.
@pmwaite69 @realDonaldTrump @GM Just be thankful that you're so well off that you think the president is the country's biggest problem. Most people don't have that luxury.
@pmwaite69 @realDonaldTrump @GM There are more important things to consider when there are still people in extreme poverty.
@beinlibertarian @realDonaldTrump @GM You nazis would believe that.
@pmwaite69 @realDonaldTrump @GM This rhetoric isn't what we need. This "kingdom made of cards" is where we all live. I don't want to go down with the ship.
@realDonaldTrump @GM We have to bail them out!
I am deeply disturbed by #Kavanaugh and his dedication to due process. You have to believe the victim!
This is what a feminist looks like. ðŸ’… https://t.co/d5LfcO4DxR
@realTJRoberts It is real. To #Resist, we have to punch down. Maybe then you libertarian scum will #inpeach #impeach45
RT @NancyPPelosi: @realTJRoberts It would take a toxicly masculine child like Soulja Boy to want tax cuts. People will die if this passes.

@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox Sir, you are a bigot who does not need a gun. Fortunately for me, I am protected from criminal prosecution since I am in Congress.
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox None of those are lies. #Hillary2020
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox I just had some wine that's worth more than you. Not on drugs. But you meth heads elected Trump! #inpeach
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox This will be used against you in court.
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox A liar wat hing a liar's channel. How typical!
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox You can lie all you want, but we all know you have them hidden around the house.
@RobertDougan2 @BadDealer @KaitMarieox The FBI will be at your home to take your guns any minute now.
@BadDealer @KaitMarieox I very much so am.
@KaitMarieox Honey, you don't need that AR-15. Just get armed security. If a murderer gets them (I only hire the best), a gun won't help me.
@JoaquinCastrotx Fidel Castro is my hero.
@RepDWStweets Absolutely. Work your magic! You made sure Hillary got the nomination. Make sure we #StopKavanaugh!
@TIME You have to vote for candidates to find out what they believe!
@TIME Those racist sexist bigots deserve to be afraid since they voted for him.	#Inpeach #Impeach45 #Trump #Kavanaugh #ImpeachTrump
@TheDailyShow If only we burned the $1400 crumbs we got back from the #Trump Tax scam! #Inpeach #Impeach45
@AppropsDems @rosadelauro @HouseGOP @NitaLowey People really don't understand. The masses aren't smart enough to see the benefits of universal healthcare, so we need to provide it.
The Nazis wanted America out of world affairs too, Rand. https://t.co/QlnQxPF7Lt
@Cernovich Kaepernick is love. Kaepernick is life.
@michaelmalice It is reactionary and bigoted to even question the Civil Rights Act. Shame on you for resisting the #Resistance! #Resist
You could help feed a welfare recipient in my district with that money. This is why we need the IRS. https://t.co/Jo3wRGcnkM
Taxation is the price we pay for my survival. If I ever leave office, I'm going to need that Social Security check!
@4FreedomOSpeech @Cernovich Shut up, Russian!
@Ship_Rekt @HuffPost I actually am! Don't you see my #Pelosi2020 announcement!?
Thank you for your praise of Sotomayor! But we must #Resist Gorsuch! https://t.co/jAt3tgpIiW
@Twtercide @EricDJuly @FBI Are you threatening to assassinate me with your username? I'll #inpeach you too once I'm president.
@realDonaldTrump Once I'm president, I'll impeach you and him!
@voxdotcom @amprog #Inpeach!
@HuffPost I would be ashamed to have ever been with that Trump-supporting slag. Her husband Kanye needs to stop betraying his people too.
@onttwiter @EricDJuly Says the man who's satisfied with the crumbs the elite left you from the #TrumpTaxScam.
@Cernovich I'm going to have the FBI investigate him simply because you spoke kindly of him, just so you know.
@MichaelJBurkhar @1Sweetness34 @charliekirk11 Why would a Russian EVER call me fake?
@hartsigns @MichaelJBurkhar @charliekirk11 I'll throw that racist son of a bitch in the cage myself, honey.
@EricDJuly Russian bots? WHERE!? @FBI, I've got one!
@EricDJuly There isn't much difference between Nazism and socialism, but Talib's sick burns are putting Uncle Toms on blast. Let's meet up for wine and we can discuss how you can be a better ally to the progressive liberation of people of color.
@JustinMoldow @tycub @lena_may_ They should have taken out reTHUGlicans like you.
@JustinMoldow @lena_may_ Did those students have guns? If so, the National Guard did nothing wrong.
@TheJavcore @ComicDaveSmith @ThomasEWoods @BobMurphyEcon You're my hero. Tell that Jewish Nazi that he must #denounce white supremacy! BURN THE WITCH (especially the Nazis known as @ThomasEWoods and @BobMurphyEcon)!!!!
@ComicDaveSmith Why would iTunes ever welcome a Jewish Nazi like you on their website?
@Radomysisky Fuck around and find out, kid.
@MichaelJBurkhar @charliekirk11 I'll pay whatever fines you impose on them.
@charliekirk11 We will remember this when the #BlueWave is in control.
#TuesdayThoughts the #Trump Tax Scam did nothing for us! The average American saved only $1400. That's barely enough for a bottle of my favorite wine, which would never last me a week in this current political climate!	#Liberal #TaxScam #Progress #Progressive #Crumbs
@dearsusanbranch @NancyPelosi @SenWarren That's too radical, I'm afraid. Progress is important, but so is gaining seats in the house. We need money in politics for that.
@spartanfan8892 @NancyPelosi Why would you ever be thankful for crumbs?

@thehill Mueller and the @FBI should investigate how this channel influenced the 2016 election.
@politicalxx @thehill @foxnewspolitics Amen sista (sorry if I got the pronouns wrong, I'm trying to get with the times)!
@HansvanderVoor1 @TIME It better be!
@TIME What people need to watch is how little they got back from the #Trump #TaxScam. The average American got $1400 out of that. I can BARELY afford a bottle of mid-priced win with that! #Crumbs
@FoxNews @PMorici1 This is REAGONOMIC nonsense!
@HuffPost The only reason officers should act that way is when they are enforcing #GunControlNow
@ThomasEWoods @stonebraker23 @VeniceKwikiMart @TalibKweli @TaiwanDude @EricDJuly Your rejection of equality is immature and extremist by nature. We are capitalists, but we are also egalitarians.
@michaelmalice It would take a childish anarchist like you to be against adulthood.
