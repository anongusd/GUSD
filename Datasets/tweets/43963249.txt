Because of Trump’s #FakeEmergency, money dedicated for the construction of daycare 👶 facilities 🏥 and 🏫 to help military families is now in danger. We must put a stop to this phony emergency NOW.
Trump’s #FakeEmergency threatens our national security 🛡️. It steals billions of 💵from crucial military construction projects like intelligence centers and essential training facilities. @SenateGOP, reject Trump’s #FakeEmergency NOW.
@HouseDemocrats swore an oath to defend our Constitution, which grants the American people the power of the purse through their representative, not the president. We call on @SenateGOP TO reject Trump’s #FakeEmergency NOW.
