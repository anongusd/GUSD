9. @RepComstock		Gun safety was a top issue in Virginia‚Äôs 2017 gubernatorial race, and Rep. Comstock can expect it to be a top issue in her race too. She has faced severe criticism from constituents for never holding a public town hall since her election.
8. @ClaudiaTenney		Rep. Tenney has not yet held a town hall over her first term in office, and students are saying she owes them a conversation about their safety.
7. @LeeZeldin		Rep. Zeldin has claimed to support some safer gun laws, but has failed to co-sponsor a single piece of legislation that would strengthen our gun laws. Voters want to know why he has backed the gun lobby‚Äôs dangerous agenda and accepted their campaign contributions.
6. @USRepRodney		Rep. Frelinghuysen chose not to run for re-election rather than face gun safety champion Mikie Sherrill, but his work for his constituents is not over until 2019. 13,000 people attended the Morristown #MarchforOurLives, and student leaders are demanding action.
5. @RepTedBudd		Rep. Budd held a closed-door roundtable with school officials to discuss school safety, but his proposed solutions do not include strengthening our nation‚Äôs gun laws. His constituents deserve a conversation about why he refuses to support common sense measures.
4. @RepErikPaulsen		Rep. Paulsen has failed to co-sponsor legislation would strengthen our nation‚Äôs gun laws, like background checks, and has voted in lockstep with the gun lobby. He is increasingly out of touch with his voters on the issue of gun safety.
3. @RepJasonLewis		Rep. Lewis has consistently sided with the gun lobby, despite Minnesotans‚Äô broad support for safer gun laws like background checks. He has been called out by constituents for failing to face them and have a conversation about how they would like him to vote.
2. @RepMikeCoffman		Despite the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting in his district and the 1999 Columbine tragedy, Rep. Coffman has consistently sided with gun lobby and opposed common sense gun laws that would better protect his constituents.
1. @SteveKnight25		Students in his district are demanding a conversation on gun safety, but he has yet to respond to their invitation. Just last year, he voted for Concealed Carry Reciprocity, which makes it easier for dangerous people to carry concealed, loaded guns in public.
