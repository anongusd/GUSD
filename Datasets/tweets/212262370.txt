As we look towards the future, there is no better playbook for righting America's course than the one used by our leaders in Indiana
On a federal level, nearly 70% of Americans say that our nation is on the wrong track
Under @POTUS' leadership, the #NationalDebt is rising, more Americans are living in poverty &amp; too many young Americans are working part-time
Unemployment is at its lowest since August 2001, budgets are balanced, new businesses are coming to IN &amp; the state has a $2 billion surplus
Under the leadership of fmr Gov. Daniels, @GovPenceIN, @INHouseGOP &amp; @INSenateGOP, IN has become a model for effective, efficient government
The difference between @GovPenceIN's #INSOTS and @POTUS' #SOTU revealed a sharp contrast in leadership between Indianapolis &amp; Washington, DC
Andrew was loved and cherished and his life and courageous battle had a deep impact on Hoosiers and all who knew him

Correcting my earlier tweet: As the president visits IN today, long-term unemployment remains unacceptably high at 31.5% of jobless workers
Long-term unemployment is still too high http://t.co/OvmcLaUkbF
As President Obama visits Indiana today, long-term unemployment remains unacceptably high at 31.5%.
The amount of people participating in the workforce remains near 30-year lows.
Despite this progress, full-time employment has yet to reach pre-recession levels.

Congress must renew its commitment to address the wide range of issues posed by cyber threats through targeted legislation

It is imperative that policymakers break down the barriers to information sharing that limit cyber defenses
