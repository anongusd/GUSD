The financial crisis hit minorities the hardest. Now, #S2155 would exempt 85% of depository institutions from reporting critical data that can be used to identify lending discrimination against African Americans, Latinos and other minority groups. https://t.co/BkDJdP5JkZ
#S2155 exempts many banks from a living will mandate, which outlines a plan for an orderly resolution in the event of a big bank‚Äôs failure and ensures its failure doesn‚Äôt destabilize the financial system.
#S2155 guts capital requirements, a safeguard to prevent bank bailouts, for dozens of big banks.
#S2155 removes dozens of the largest banks from enhanced regulatory supervision and prudential standards. These banks received $47 billion from taxpayers in the last crisis to prevent their failures and stabilize the financial system.
#S2155 rolls back stress testing requirements for the largest and ‚Äúglobal systemically important banks,‚Äù like repeat bad actor #WellsFargo.
#S2155 completely exempts or weakens enhanced standards for the 38 largest banks. Collectively, these banks hold almost $32 trillion in assets. Less big bank oversight will only set the stage for the next financial crisis. #ProtectConsumers
#S2155 weakens key #DoddFrank reforms and rolls back critical consumer protections put in place following the financial crisis, including mortgage rules, appraisal and escrow rules, and data reporting requirements in place to prevent discriminatory lending. #DoddFrankRollBack
#S2155 weakens rules that require banks to document and verify a homebuyer‚Äôs income, bringing back the kind of weak underwriting that was at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.
#S2155 is a brazen giveaway to Wall Street &amp; big banks that would harm consumers. Instead of helping out banks that are posting record profits, Congress should be working to ensure that abusive financial institutions (like #WellsFargo) face real consequences. #ProtectConsumers

10. Conclusion: #S2155 simply repackages harmful provisions from Chairman Hensarling‚Äôs #WrongChoiceAct. It must not become law.
9. #S2155 exempts many banks from a living will mandate, which would outline a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of a bank‚Äôs failure and ensure their failure doesn‚Äôt destabilize the financial system.
8. #S2155 guts capital requirements for dozens of banks, a safeguard to prevent bank bailouts.
7. #S2155 exempts or weakens enhanced standards for other large banks. Collectively, these banks hold about $16 trillion in assets. Many institutions that required emergency gov interventions to prevent their failures from harming the rest of the economy would be excluded.
6. #S2155 rolls back certain stress testing requirements for the largest and ‚Äúglobal systemically important‚Äù banks, like repeat bad actor #WellsFargo.
5. #S2155 raises the threshold at which banks would be subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion in assets. Less bank supervision will only set the stage for our next financial crisis.
4. #S2155 weakens key #DoddFrank reforms and rolls back critical consumer protections put in place following the financial crisis, including mortgage rules, appraisal and escrow rules, and data collection requirements that help to illuminate discriminatory lending practices.
3. #S2155 weakens rules so that a homebuyer‚Äôs income documentation no longer must be verified by most lenders, bringing back the kind of weak underwriting and unaffordable loans that were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.
2. The financial crisis hit minorities the hardest. Now, #S2155 proposes to exempt most financial institutions from a requirement to collect critical data that can be used to identify lending discrimination against African Americans, Latinos and other minority groups.
1. #S2155 is a brazen giveaway to Wall Street &amp; big banks that would harm consumers. Instead of helping out banks that posted record profits last year, Congress should be working to ensure that abusive financial institutions (like #WellsFargo) face real consequences.

#HR4015 attempts to regulate proxy advisors out of existence and hurts the very businesses @HouseGOP claims it assists.
We should be empowering our public pension plans to hold corporate management accountable on behalf of hardworking Americans. #HR4015 is a move in the wrong direction.
#HR4015 undermines pension funds' efforts to make well-informed decisions about the companies they invest in, putting retirees at risk.
#RELEASE: Ranking Member @RepMaxineWaters' Statement in Opposition to Bill that Rolls Back Important Dodd-Frank Rules for Large Banks #HR3312                   https://t.co/EjZzYnAuEF
Today @HouseGOP gave #WallStreet an early Christmas gift by passing #HR3312, a harmful bill that rolls back important parts of #WallStreet reform.
Congress enacted #DoddFrank to protect hardworking Americans and the #economy. #HR3312 would dismantle important #DoddFrank protections.
The passage of #HR3312 would be a win for foreign banks, including the President‚Äôs bank, @DeutscheBank, which has a long history of breaking U.S. law.
#HR3312 rolls back rules for many of our largest banks, making it harder for community banks to compete.
#HR3312 would sow the seeds for another financial crisis. Congress should be building on #DoddFrank, not dismantling it.
#HR3312 is a giveaway to #WallStreet that deregulates many of the nation‚Äôs largest #banks

WSJ: Title insurance can cost hundreds of dollars, yet many home buyers don't focus on the price until closing http://t.co/rJVSQl5odn #HR685
Schemes that steer borrowers into affiliated businesses of the creditor drive up costs and make it more difficult for families to own homes
Large banks have been repeatedly caught taking advantage of consumers through complex kickback arrangements. #HR685 actually makes it easier
Now: House Republicans pushing #HR685, a measure that encourages lenders to steer borrowers to service providers they own. #kickbackbill
#HR685 would harm competition and encourage lenders to direct borrowers to expensive affiliates ‚Äì codifying a system of kickbacks in our law
A diverse coalition ranging from the @NAACP and @NCLR, to @CRLONLINE and @amprog have all voiced their opposition to #HR685.
#HR685 encourages further limits in competition in what is -- and historically has been -- an uncompetitive title insurance market:
#DoddFrank banned kickbacks in mortgage lending, provided a 3% cap on upfront fees and introduced qualified mortgage standards. #HR685
RM .@MaxineWaters: #HR685  would roll back protections, make mortgages more expensive, undermines #DoddFrank, undo the work of the @CFPB.

.@CFPB report: those seeking manufactured housing loans particularly stand 2 benefit from strong consumer protections http://t.co/NbD3tvOsfH
#HR650 would it legal for mobile home sales personnel to steer borrowers towards high-cost loans, a practice banned  after the crisis
Clayton Homes &amp; the two biggest mobile home lenders are owned by Berkshire Hathaway, whose shares trade for $215,000 each. #mobilehomemoney
#HR650 allows lenders to charge nearly 14% interest before consumer protections triggered; could grow to +18% as interest rates normalize
Despite Dodd-Frank, manufactured housing giant Clayton Homes earned $558 million dollars in 2014 -- an increase of 34 percent over 2013.
#HR650 would potentially raise interest rates to 14% -- RM.@MaxineWaters: there is no member of Congress that would pay these rates.
