@ScotsFyre @MarcGiller Odd. When I saw Obama pushing damaging policy, I rooted for his failure, openly, w/no problem. They're not kings. We're not beholden to them or their whims. We're allowed to speak out. In fact, we are derelict in our duties as citizens NOT to speak out in those circumstances.

@MarcGiller John McCain is no longer 'here' or 'now.' He served his country. He ran his race. Let him rest in peace, without dancing on his grave. If the concern is actually 'here and now,' as it should be, you focus on that and not demeaning the memory of the departed for political points.

@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley OK. That's full metal Trump cult, there. No proof and authorities have checked and concluded it didnt happen, but Trump said it. You believe it. That's the end of it.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley It didnt happen. They tossed that idea. Therefore, saying they wiretapped Dear Leader makes no sense. Seriously, the FBI is trained to spot threats to our nation. They saw something that concerned them and brought it to Congress. That's their job.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley Did? You act like that's past tense. Putin is basically running our foreign policy now.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley Except nobody 'wiretapped' this embarrassment of a president. Just because he tweeted it, you're not required to believe it, you know. It has long been proven that nobody 'wiretapped' him.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley What a steaming heap of Trump lovin.' 	We've had some heinous CiCs before, but none with so many threads connecting them to a hostile foreign power, or constantly singing the praises of dictators.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley No, I think the justification went beyond the dossier. Trump gave them plenty of reason to suspect he was compromised.
@NHAinTexas @NikkiHaley They ran it by members of Congress and got absolutely no pushback. This wasnt 'on their own.' They went through the channels - checks and balances. That's what we used to have before we got a king.

@ScottSKOMO It was 81 in NC today, btw.
@NumbersMuncher That's such next-level idiotic.
@ChrisLitt18 @Ilhan Obviously not, since it hasnt happened, yet. For now, CEOs of these companies are keeping people in jobs. If you keep pushing them to ruin their business model, torpedo profits by paying more than the job is worth, then it may, and they would be within their rights to do so.
@SpeakerPelosi We are God's creation, and His most beloved. I'll be looking for you to denounce abortion any day now.
@Ilhan It's because they flip burgers. It's not a high-skilled job. Being a CEO is. Flipping burgers is an entry level job to get young people's feet wet in the working world. Do you want those jobs replaced w/kiosks, because that's the way to get those jobs replaced w/kiosks.

@LNW4Trump @StrangeFunnies @realDonaldTrump She was out and about yesterday.
@chadfelixg @PolitiBunny Bull.
@PolitiBunny @chadfelixg It has nothing to do with the individual writers who are left, but nice way to try and draw cover. It's about you acting as if you know what happened at RedState. YOU DO NOT.
@PolitiBunny @chadfelixg If you're not sure, it's because you're not very observant. You called those who have a legitimate story to tell of how they were treated by Salem 'liars.' Not because you have any knowledge of how they/we were treated, but because of your loyalty to the state. 1/
@MartiniShark @OrdyPackard @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny Yes. I do. You can make the argument that my particularly harsh assessment of Trump was my undoing,  but that doesn't explain the crappy treatment of @CalebHowe @BenHowe or the others from the purge. Nor does it explain the experience of Kim &amp; Andrea.
@MartiniShark @OrdyPackard @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny Nice bit of hyperbole. To Salem and Trump's acolytes,  any criticism is an attack. It will not be tolerated.
@EButcher55 @W4ysted1 @johncardillo @progressiveact I saw the article this morning.
@MartiniShark @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny I'm not responsible for your issues. There is no more Redstate. It ceased being about conservative thought when Salem decided to be Trump's propaganda wing. Your continued denial of what happened there is what makes you a drone.
@ian_mckelvey @MartiniShark @PolitiBunny There may be, but not with Salem Media, and that's the point.
@MartiniShark @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny You feel you were targeted? Honestly, you would be the last I would have thought of. No specific writer was mentioned. That you feel compelled to dive in and take the offensive position,  however, pretty much confirms the one-mind mentality that has overtaken OrangeState.
@ian_mckelvey @MartiniShark @PolitiBunny Nope	 It's simply the death of honest, conservative media. Some will go with the flow. Others refuse to worship personalities.
@MartiniShark @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny As long as you admit it. And I get it. You don't want to put a target on your back. That's fine, but you should probably sit this one out.
@MartiniShark @PolitiBunny BTW, nobody said we were told what to write. Salem made it quite clear, however.
@MartiniShark @ian_mckelvey @PolitiBunny If you ignore the obvious, you are either blind or being intensely disingenuous.
@MartiniShark @PolitiBunny Are we talking about a specific, direct command? No. Are we looking at the very clear signals sent? We should be. Then there are reports of the community of RS posters being encouraged by some senior writers to pump up Trump to get their work promoted to the front page...

@PolitiBunny Here's a wacky thought: Maybe write something that isnt the equivalent of sucking Trump's toes and see if you get the same 'supportive' vibe from the higher ups. You are supported because YOU TOE THE TRUMP LINE!!
@PolitiBunny Do you also get that fealty to Trump does not determine if someone is a good writer or a good person? Trump is NOT GOD, nor is he a king. Salem media is actively working to kill conservative thought, in favor of a personality.
@PolitiBunny You understand that that was your experience, but not the experience of those at RedState? I was one of their top draws. I brought eyes to the site, the bread and butter of this business, but was booted. My crime? NeverTrump. This is reality.

@jaraparilla @SaysHummingbird If they're using someone's hacked, stolen info, it makes them complicit. If they're working behind the scenes w/a Russian cutout, they require scrutiny. A few years ago, Hannity wanted Assange locked up for these activities. What happened? He's a hypocrite, &amp; possibly a criminal.
@RadioFreeTom @TheRickWilson That's what I believe, or would believe, but this play has several actors, all pushing the Heaven's Gate-cult vibe to the max. Him, Jeanine Pirro, Sean Hannity... I keep waiting for them to take a bow, but they just move on to the next act, seamlessly.
@Popehat @mitchellvii @gtconway3d He seriously called Trump's mind a 'super computer.' 	That's got to be a parody account.
@TheRickWilson Has to be.
@SaysHummingbird Let's not forget that when Hannity's Twitter went down briefly last year [ or 2017?], someone convincingly posed as him, and was contacted by Julian Assange, with info he wanted to share on Dem lawmaker Mark Warner. Suggested "secure channel" and set up call time.
they had. They created fake news sites, stirred up strife and angst among our citizens. Russia are NOT our friends, and if you're intent on defending Trump's team in this or employing "whataboutism" you are complicit.  /fin/

@MrsLisaSaunders It's not a myth, but maybe the attitudes are changing, as the world gets darker. Abortion used to be a shameful thing. Now, the left celebrates it as their golden calf. Women who slaughter the unborn are folk heroes, to be honored for their 'bravery.' Abortionists are moving up.
@MrsLisaSaunders You may need that label for issues in this world, but the Christian must always be conscious of the fact that we're only passing through, here. This is not our home, and our hearts must reflect Christ, and how HE sees us, and wants us to see each other.
@MrsLisaSaunders There is ample material available online, and it all points to the same issue. There's a reason abortion mills tend to locate in low income areas. They have a specific target, and it is disgusting.

@MrsLisaSaunders Are they Christians or are they not? We need to get away from putting a racial label on our brothers and sisters in Christ. We segregate our hearts before we ever reach the kingdom gates. How do we expect to get in with that attitude? I've researched the topic, as well. None 1/

@tommystearns Right. Democrats aren't Americans.	Yeah. I may not agree with their politics, but they're Americans. Russians, however, are not.
@KurtSchlichter What do you think I'm posing as?	Whatever it is, better to be a poser than an outright communist sympathizer. Ahoy, yourself.
@BardLackey Good Americans dont bow to Putin or Russia.
@IdealisticallyN MAGA would have us bow at the feet of communism, to own the libs.
@johngort3 Yeah, traitor. I did an entire series speaking out against that when Obama tried to force North Carolina to throw open the bathroom doors and make it 'anything goes' in the Tarheel State. Try again, you communist sympathizer.
@ShermPeever Back to your post, little bot.
@CeJr1969 You have absolutely NO reading comprehension skills, do you?	So here's the thing: Loving our country does NOT include bowing down to Russia, our greatest geopolitical foe, as the person I retweeted suggests.

@pcarenza @drumphinator @CounselorNachos Interestingly enough, CNN just reported that the father of the little girl has spoken with the Guatemalan consulate and has "no complaints" about how border patrol treated them.
@KaitMarieox Who hurt you?
@pcarenza @drumphinator @CounselorNachos This has been out there for awhile. They do this to discourage migrants from making the trip. They're not trying to kill them.
@MrsLisaSaunders We have a general idea of what they were fleeing in Guatemala. They knew how long their child had been without food and water. At some point, they should have sought help. Somebody along the way would have helped. My problem is putting the sole blame on border patrol.
@ColleenTaylorW1 @Sweetpea593 I do have a child, and I would do anything to keep my child from famine, as well. These parents didnt, and now we see where that leads.
@newreymantics He may have made those jokes because of his own mental health issues.
@pcarenza @drumphinator @CounselorNachos I think when a child is involved, you take better precautions. This journey wasnt them suddenly being forced out, without notice. They planned this trip. They knew that the need for food and water would be there. We can't blame border patrol, solely, for this child's death.
@drumphinator @pcarenza @CounselorNachos Thank you.

@JWorthen2020 I made no contribution to her death. No one is 'shifting blame.' They should have had mercy on her condition at the border. To ignore the first responsibility that lies with her parents, however, is wrong.
@drumphinator @CounselorNachos For this child, there were precautions that could have been taken, but were not. She didnt suddenly begin starving, thirsting to death at the border. That happened over time. They risked their child's life, and to turn it into a hit piece against border patrol is just WRETCHED.

@CounselorNachos Her child died.	That's the evidence that it was a bad decision.
@CounselorNachos They could have provided for the child, given her condition. That doesnt absolve her parents of their DUTY to look out for the child's well-being. I dont know what they were leaving behind, but you dont drag kids on suicide missions.
@peterdaou That's seriously not the case.	You know, there's a time for hyperbole - usually in comedy skits - and then there's a time for serious, rational contemplation over our differences and in the interest of resolution. This would be one of those times.
I feel horrible for the 7 year old girl that died of thirst and starvation after crossing the border, but at what point do we look at the parents that drug their child on a perilous trek, w/out food &amp; water? They put her in harm's way, and that should NOT be overlooked.

@VictoriaVanHor7 @TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 That a man so wicked and lost has a 'flock' is a problem.	The Word says if the blind leads the blind, they both fall in a ditch.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 And you are far too wicked and worldly to understand the problem isnt in what his race may be. It's because you have made it an issue.
@RavagerMog @TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 THIS.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 Why would I complain about Jesus? I'm not focused on his race. I'm not looking at a picture. Faith is believing without seeing. That's your hangup. Not mine.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 Jesus doesnt care about your politics. My Jesus is neither blond or blue eyed. I dont know what he looks like. I just dont put importance on it, like you do. And you cling to a race. I'll cling to a faith.
@VictoriaVanHor7 @TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 It's not the belief. Nobody who studies Biblical history thinks Jesus was white. Some artists have portrayed him that way over the years, and Mr. Swan's own racial hatred has him focused on it. In fact, it's driving him crazy that I'm not. His bias wont let him let it go.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 Look, you dont have to keep reiterating it. You hate white people. You've made that abundantly clear, but segregation is a worldly issue. It is not a godly issue. You're acting like there's nothing after this life, because you're not Kingdom-focused.
@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 No, I'm in this world, but it is not my home. And I'm waiting for the other Christian to show up. Mr. Swan is so full of racial hatred that there is nothing resembling Christ in him.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 So if it turned out that he was white, you would reject his message, wouldnt you?

@Steward2778 @ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan What does God say? That will always be my go-to. Gal. 3:28 "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." We shouldnt be focusing on differences, if we are of the same Body.

@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 And I am a sister [in Christ]. Maybe not to you. Your idea of Heaven is segregated. Mine is not. Keep mocking. It'll serve you in this world. It won't in the coming Kingdom, and that's not a race thing. It's a God thing.
@TalbertSwan @serperiorafc_83 You're the one hyper-focused on race. I dont even think about Jesus race. I'm too concerned with his message. That's what you keep missing, but then, you're of the world and have no part of Christ.
@TalbertSwan @ShelbyFallin I seriously doubt he was a blue-eyed hippie, myself, but if it turned out he was, I wouldnt care. The problem I have with what you did is in that you felt like it was something you needed to bring up. You didnt. Your focus is wrong because your heart is bad.
This is painful. https://t.co/YrdW2ZKLdS
@walterkirn What's the difference?	*ducks*
@JayCaruso That dog is cool!	Nice selection, too!
@ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan No. He has no idea what race Jesus was. None of us were there. We can only assume, but that should not be our focus. AT ALL. As soon as somebody brings up Jesus' race, of all things, that's the first clue that they dont care about his teaching. They care about his politics.
@ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan No, he felt the need to let his own racial hatred roam free, when, if he were an actual man of God, his first concern would be spreading the love of God, no matter race. He acts like only Jesus' race has value. His cocky attitude over it is not of God, either. Dont be decieved.
@serperiorafc_83 @TalbertSwan Mr. Swan [calling a satanic priest 'bishop' is just wrong] took up the mantle of teacher. The Word says that for a teacher who twists the Word to suit his purpose, rather than to truly teach God will suffer more in the last days that mere sinners. He needs to repent NOW.
@mulatta10 @TalbertSwan It was his goal, clearly. Why would he even think of such a thing, and why does race matter more than the Word?
@manifestedson @TalbertSwan Who are you talking to?	I am no Trump fan. He assumed that to be true because he got called out for his ugly, godless, lying soul. I answered him, but it's not me he has to worry about. The Word tells us that those who claim to be teachers, but teach falsely will suffer most.
@TalbertSwan @DiamonDamien More hate from this false teacher. When your end comes, it will be suited to how you lived your hateful life. Turn around before it's too late.
@ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan I dont care. God judges the world, but the church must keep the church pure and hold each other accountable. Mr. Swan is leading others astray with his racial hatred, and is bringing Jesus into it. That is the work of a reprobate spirit. God will not be mocked.
@ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan There may be, and they'll have to get their hearts right, or God will fix it for them. The facts are, we can't be sure, but we shouldnt care more about that than we care about his teaching. And Mr. Swan IS a false teacher. His spirit is dead. There is no God in his words.
@TalbertSwan race, I grieve for your dead spirit. 	Guess what? Heaven will not be segregated. You're not going to get a black Heaven or a White Heaven. There's just the Kingdom of God, and you are not ready. /fin/
@TalbertSwan You are in grave error, and you're no different than those you now ridicule. Jesus knew to keep politics and faith separate. The Word warns us to avoid vain and useless arguments. Race would fall in that category. If you dont recognize me as a sister-in-Christ because of my 1/
@TalbertSwan Be careful, Mr. Swan. You're showing your heart. I've made a career out of calling out the ungodliness of Trump and those Republicans that call him 'God's man.' I dont think Jesus is concerned about our politics, or our race. He cares about our souls and how we live for him.
@ShelbyFallin @TalbertSwan Why does it matter? Would the truth of God's Word be less if he wasn't a black man? Would it be less if he was Asian, white, or anything else? If your focus is on his race, then your focus is not on Him. This false teacher brought up race, quite randomly. His heart is not right.
@TalbertSwan If you're more worried about your activism, sowing seeds of racial discord in the Body of Christ, how are YOU going to handle it when Jesus comes back and spits all the false teachers out, saying, "Away from me, evildoer. I never knew you"? Repent.

@CounselorNachos @CoyoteBlue77 Because 'limited government' doesnt mean insane. We dont have a problem with drivers licenses or military ID. Why would we? That doesnt expand government. It protects our process.
@CounselorNachos @CoyoteBlue77 And let me just add this, and mean it, with all seriousness: If you're too stupid to figure out how to get ID, you're probably too stupid to be voting.
@CounselorNachos @CoyoteBlue77 So if somebody tries to vote with their Sam's Club ID, you think that should pass? The state of NC was providing FREE ID to those who needed it, and even that wasnt good enough for them. Why do you think that is?

@CounselorNachos Nobody is targeting them, anymore than they target the other side.	That is to say, when Democrats freak because of commonsense voter ID laws, it's for a purpose, and that purpose is not noble.

Ok. Gotta give Trump a nod, here. He's right about one thing: Whenever there are 'found' ballots after an election, they always seem to be 'found' in favor of Democrats. Look at NC's 2016 governor's race. McCrory was ahead, then, late that night... FOUND DEMOCRAT VOTES! WOW!

@jpwilloughby So since you keep pretending to not get the point, we'll just assume you're dumb.
@jpwilloughby I actually didnt write a story about the graffiti. I think I retweeted a story about it. And it wasnt random vandalism. As I pointed out, this was graffiti, designed to cause maximum pain to a specific segment of our fellow Americans.
@jpwilloughby All of your posts about that graffiti are about fomenting racial division. That graffiti wasnt just any graffiti. It was targeted, and either you know what you're saying now is ludicrous, or you are the dumbest human being to ever suck air.
@jpwilloughby No. I dont agree with you. Trumpism kills, but Democrats are no better. We need a completely different party.
@jpwilloughby Already voted, straight Republican. I've never voted for Democrats, for a reason. They didnt get better, just because Republicans got worse. And there were no particularly troublesome candidates on my ballot, this election.
@jpwilloughby That's not false, at all. And if you cared about minorities, you wouldnt scoff at the pain and concern of a memorial to dead slaves being desecrated with angry, racist graffiti.
@jpwilloughby I know he's a liar. He tells easily provable lies every day. And I'm most definitely not in his base. I value decency, good will, and truth, far too much. OH, and common sense. That's an important one.
@jpwilloughby You are doing exactly that. Trump has made it acceptable to be openly inhuman towards your fellow man, and fellow Americans. You follow his lead, because you're a follower. And a hateful, petty person that thrives on division. Obviously.
@jpwilloughby But Trump said even though he's not on the ballot, you're voting for him.
@jpwilloughby When you stoke racial hatred among fellow Americans, you're not doing good. And it's not that you care about 'speech codes.' It's that you want license for your hatred, and to be counted as a loyal Trumpkin, you must be as vile as possible.
@jpwilloughby There is no 'y'all.' I've voted Republican, backed conservative causes my entire adult life. It took a man of Trump's despicable character to break me out of my partisan haze. Decency has no party.
RT @JonahNRO: So you’re taking a vow of silence then? https://t.co/WtkiSSxLK7
@jpwilloughby And Trump's cult are soulless and with no sense of decency or decorum. It's not about being a 'snowflake' or sensitive. It's about what this site means to some of our nation's citizens and the intent of the graffiti. You're not making yourself look good, here.

@Stacy2713 @waddsi @ScottHech Reading skills not up to par? I clearly said I was NOT a Trump supporter. I've made a whole career out of slamming the man. He's a disgrace. I was talking about that obnoxious letter, only. And the reasons for the Pittsburgh shooting had nothing to do w/the person on that plane.
@ScottHech I'm not even a Trump supporter [by NO MEANS, AT ALL] &amp; I find this letter to be obnoxious. How does this person know everyone on the plane [other than her] is scared of the hat? I support Israel. I mourn w/the families of the 11 killed. This self-righteous note is not 'brave.'

I have to take up for @hughhewitt . He was NOT comparing a guy yelling in a restaurant [at Sen. McConnell] to a guy sending mail bombs. He was saying it was the same as Trump's rally rhetoric, both sides are out of control w/rhetoric. Listen to the clip. https://t.co/P3xKsbl3We

@jrmatheny @resurgent Semantics. The word, specifically, was not used, but if you look at the definition of the word, then Jesus very much calls for us to evangelize, to spread the Good News. It's just a name to denote the purpose, and it's a good purpose. You shouldnt quibble.
@neontaster @_cgp @RadioFreeTom I agree. Israel is the only nation in the Middle East that has earned our alliance, IMO. I have my doubts about this helping with peace, because I dont think politics brings peace. That being said, it's not about appeasing, but about what is right.
@judith_lankau @chrislhayes @guypbenson No. I'm paying attention. I havent been in a cult coma since 2015, like some of those with lesser intellects and red caps to warn people of my condition. https://t.co/DtTx1NFIM2
@chrislhayes @guypbenson I have to point out here that there were several that thought he meant it, and their legal fees have not been paid.
It's #WorldMentalHealthDay and Donald Trump is still president. I just felt I needed to point that out.
@neontaster @RadioFreeTom I know what it means for Israel. I respect that, but I also know Trump keeps signing the waiver to allow for delays to the actual move, every 6 months, just like every other president since 1995. He does that away from cameras.
@BillKristol They said she'd first brought it up 6 months ago, or that's what I'm reading.
@BenHowe The wild fluctuation of my followers count suggests that's a common occurrence. They see one thing I wrote and get excited, then they see the next thing I write and they cant get away, fast enough.
@jrmatheny @resurgent Read the article. You think I'm calling for some political revolution. I'm calling for the opposite.
@neontaster @RadioFreeTom Of course. With that in mind, considering who we're dealing with, I'd clip any praise for a job completed that has been, thus far, nothing but a plaque on a wall [that I saw] and another grand ceremony to appease Trump's ego.
@neontaster @RadioFreeTom But is the embassy actually moved? The last I read, the ambassador would be commuting between the office in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
@jkempcpa Same. 	I reject the party of Trump, but if I identified with Democrats, I'd have been a Democrat, in the first place. My principles didnt change. The Republican party's principles did.
@jrmatheny @resurgent You apparently didnt read the article. You're just commenting on the title, based on what 'evangelical Christian' means in the U.S. today, arent you? The entire article was about taking the politics out of it and reclaiming its true meaning.

It's just the death cult of socialism/communism that is evil, and his pursuit of said death cult created evil conditions. Was that the euphemisms you needed to be emotionally ok?
@AmericanObserv6 @Miami_Rebelde @suzylu83 @valeria_younger @BradThor @DLoesch His source was his own warm, fuzzy fantasies about some socialist utopia that doesnt exist.
@TheRickWilson We're still not 100% after Florence, here in NC. Do you have a good supply of non-perishable hurricane snacks and a generator?
@jrmatheny @resurgent Really? Go read Matt. 28:18-20 [It's in the NT]. Jesus tells his disciples to go &amp; make disciples of all nations. 'Evangelical' comes from the word 'Evangelism,' which means to spread the Gospel message of salvation. I'd say the NT is very in tune w/the evangelical purpose.
@jrmatheny @resurgent Because evangelical has a meaning.

Unhelpful blue idiocy. He brushed past his wife to hug his child. Had the clip been long enough, we probably would have seen him hug his other daughter. Time to give it up, screeching feminist harridans. It's done. https://t.co/xwokQsD4bc
@ellievan65 To hug his daughter, you mean? Watch how he hugged his wife, then brushed by her to hug his daughter?	Yeah. I saw that, too.

@MrsLisaSaunders I lost my oldest brother to a sudden, massive heart attack on April 6. On July 13, my daddy passed away from the ravages of Lewy Body dementia, with me and Mama by his side. I know that pain of loss, Sister. My love and prayers are with you. 💜
@akeirans @xAudrina25x @ReaganBattalion @StormyDaniels She was an accomplice to his cheating. She was the vehicle of his misdeed. she wasnt the first, or the last, but she was his partner in crime.
@xAudrina25x @ReaganBattalion @StormyDaniels They cant cheat alone.

@martincizmar @mimylemu05 @gruffmadness Sounds like a failure in your raising. Sorry to hear it.
@martincizmar @mimylemu05 @gruffmadness I'm sorry. Are you not getting enough attention, Precious?	He asked a question. I answered.	And you dont need my help. You're shaming yourself quite sufficiently.
@mimylemu05 @martincizmar @gruffmadness Hi, Mike. I write for Erick Erickson's outfit, The Resurgent, and have a daily column over at Patheos called Susan Wright on the Right. You can check it out here: https://t.co/ahhYQAvRZc
@iamfartyb @martincizmar Um, the person was nearly 40. I get it. My 55 yr old brother died of a sudden heart attack in April. My mom still isnt over it. OH, and then there was the bus driver that was shot during a domestic situation, but because it was a school bus it was called a 'school shooting.'
@Scaramucci Dunno, but how was the coffee?
@MimiGPDX @martincizmar And when did Melania Trump become my 'leader'?
@MimiGPDX @martincizmar It's a simple list. Even Wiki can't go wrong, there.
@STP48315 @martincizmar Exactly.
@MimiGPDX @martincizmar I realize 'radically left' means 'all the way stupid,' but get somebody w/reading comprehension skills to help you. No. I did NOT call school shootings 'peripheral.' Some of what is counted as 'school shooting' happens outside of school, however. Check the link.
@iamfartyb @martincizmar You didnt pay attention to anything but the dates, did you? If you're calling finding a shooting victim in an empty school parking lot after school hours a 'school shooting,' then yeah, but let's try to keep perspective.
@martincizmar When you use the word 'routinely' and it's anything BUT routine...	And again, I was bounced from RedState for NOT being a Trumper. I'm definitely not moderate, though. Do your homework and you'll know who I am.
@martincizmar @gruffmadness Dude, I'm not a Trumper. I was the top trafficked writer for RedState and got bounced in April for being SO VERY ANTI-Trump. You keep getting it wrong.
@martincizmar It looks like I forgot to give the link for the school shootings. Here it is. The ACTUAL school shootings through the years are a drop in the bucket. Most of what is called a school shooting is peripheral activity, at best. https://t.co/kPeMAGKygg
@Daryl_DixonTWD3 N/P.
@Daryl_DixonTWD3 Proposal.
@martincizmar I know you dont understand. Your partisanship blinds you to reason. Alex Jones is  HACK, and I have spoken out against his crap, OFTEN. Sandy Hook happened. Parkland happened. They were tragic, but to contend there is a problem on the scale you insinuated is just not realistic.
@martincizmar @Submarine_Mike That's delusional. She's not coming back.
@martincizmar @goplonewolf @mcbob You're rather slow, arent you?	It said a 'well-regulated militia,' and the right of THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT be infringed. Do you understand that at that time, the militia was citizens? I have a box FULL of pocket Constitutions. I will send you one, if you like.
@martincizmar @mcbob No.	Next idiotic statement?
@martincizmar Routinely?	Good grief. Somebody needs to switch to decaf. Here's a list of 'school shootings' from 1840 to 9-11-18. The number of ACTUAL school shootings, that werent parking lot mishaps after school hours or shootings around moving buses is quite low.

@martincizmar He was the victim of an attempted massacre by a crazed, leftwing gunman. I kind of think he has grounds for complaint against violent rhetoric. What's your angle here? I can tell you, whatever it is, it's wrong. And bad.

@WalkingDeadLife It felt like settling in to the new roles. I'd say an 8. It was well done, but there is some setting up still to do.
@billyliberty @JeffCren @kaitlancollins So it moved from: HE'S A RAPIST to HE'S A DRUNK to HE'S EMOTIONAL!!! Isn't all that tiresome, or do you have a crew that moves the goalposts for you?
@NellyBelle3379 Yes, please.

@KenfukintuckyKJ You're not supposed to let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Jesus' sermon on the mount [Matt. 6:3-4]. You dont give to boast, or have others awed by what you do. If you want rewards here, where is your reward in Heaven?

@vegasmikedavis Yes it is, and he's refused to hold his ground and say 'NO' on the issue not once, but twice, now.  This latest was horrific. It's like they're testing him to see if he'll sign whatever they put in front of him, and he does.
@miguelmarquez Why?
@jimmyalto @miguelmarquez @brianstelter It's not that courageous to bring unsubstantiated claims against a man, while saying 'I dont remember a thing about it, except that it was him' and then hiding behind a mindless mob. Foolhardy, yes, but not courageous.

@vegasmikedavis He signed that bill twice. The latest 'minibus' bill not only funds PP, but pays for research using aborted baby parts. Good grief, man. I dont mind your disagreeing, or mistaking me for a liberal, based on myopic Trumpism, but at least know what's happening around you!
@KenfukintuckyKJ Well, who have you fought today?
@awbhtravel Right.
To repeat: 90 degree days, humidity, flip-flops, horse-sized mosquitoes, and pumpkin spice lattes. Welcome to Fall in North Carolina.
@vegasmikedavis He's not conservative. He's against free trade, has executed big govt tariffs, keeps signing bills that support PP, etc... You're deluded, and apparently have no idea what conservatism is.
@ShesPurdy No, he's not. He's just a moderate squish who will do little to move the needle with SCOTUS.
@vegasmikedavis I'm a lifelong conservative. And please, explain to me how a majority Republican SCOTUS that signed off on Roe v. Wade as law in the 70s is different today? My 'last guy' was George W. Bush, btw.
@NHAinTexas @chadfelixg or sweated for anything. My people were dirt-poor sharecroppers and mill workers, but no matter. He followed me right to the checkout, and even asked the cashier to confirm what he was saying. She nodded, and I just shook my head, as I paid for my stuff w/ money I EARNED.
@NHAinTexas @chadfelixg I'm white. I can, apparently, do whatever I want, with no restrictions. And this is absolutely no lie: I actually had some random person follow me around a grocery store once, chattering on about my white privilege, and about how my peeps never worked the fields 1/
