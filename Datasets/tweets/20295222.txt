Glad to know I'm not crazy RT @nielslesniewski @emilyprollcall we're thinking the same thing.
Also it's a mystery to me Y sen dems think this budget tactic is any better than the sen gop's failed 4yr push 2 skewer dems 4 no budget
And in what alternate universe would John Boehner allow a 'back room deal' on a non binding budget res w sen dems of all peeps?
Not trying to take sides here but since when did having a conference committee become a 'back room deal'?
yep MT @dcbigjohn: Do people really think House isn't full of bamas cheating on their spouses? If so where have they been the last 200 yrs?"

Motions to instruct wouldn't strictly forbid Senate from taking up budget that calls for raised taxes or reconciliation (2/2)
