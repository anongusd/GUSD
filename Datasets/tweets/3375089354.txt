3. Time will tell, but seems to me Trump has been able to outsmart these demonic asshats so far.	 Let's pray he finds a way to save American face without major conflict. I still believe he still will. You all are losing faith too quickly.
2. Now the war mongering asshat globalists want Trump to decapitate the Syrian govt, Libya style, and attack 70 targets there, risking a major confligration with Russia and Iran, so they can continue to enrich and empower themselves.
1. Let me get this straight: ISIS burns people alive, drowned people in cages, shot people in the back of the head, cut other peoples heads off, raped children to death. Globalist do and say nothing. Trump takes care of it.

@deceptibling @talkin_rockin You can't even walk down the street in Mesaco during the DAY, without fear of being assaulted, shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, or at least, panhandled. At night? Forget it. If you leave home, be armed, stay in your truck with your doors locked. Thx, politiwhores. Way to serve us.
@deceptibling @talkin_rockin Now that they've 'cleaned up' this very neighborhood, you see the results. The political whores that sold out our city to agenda 21 and the feds for lightrail money, are pround of what this formerly quiet little burb has become. It makes me sick.
@deceptibling @talkin_rockin I don't know if this latest incident involves illegal aliens but that doesn't matter. I was born in Mesa and have lived in or near it for 50 years. Even when the Escobido project, a govt funded barrio built in the heart of Mesa  still existed, this shit NEVER happened.
@deceptibling @talkin_rockin That's life in Mesaco now that the LDS have surrendered the city they founded 30 years b4 AZ acheived statehood, to the illegal aliens from Mexico. That kid was killed in the 7-11 by an illegal alien a few blocks from my house as well. Allowing this is all part of agenda 21.

RT @GloriaProject1: Is anyone surprised that #DNC Chair Tom Perez is a liar.  No the #DNC did not have record fundraising in January. https‚Ä¶
@sammierae70 The answer is obvious if you consider the evidence. Those responsible for upholding the law are crooked as well. Guess what. ALL these arrogant bastards will pay for their crimes.
@sammierae70 If you are unwilling to research anything the right is saying, because you disagree with it, where are you getting the discernment to determine what is actually true? Answer. You're not. There is a whole universe of facts out there that you are not using in your assertions.
@sammierae70 It's like Reagan once said: "Liberals. It's not that they are ignorant, it's that they know so much that isn't so." You probably believe you are openminded and tolerant, yet you have closed your mind to anything you disagree with.
@sammierae70 Wow, you really are cloistered. You must be painting with a mighty broad bush with your definition of right wing conspiracy blah blah blah. WTF does that even mean?
@sammierae70 How do you know when you've won an argument with a liberal?  When they call you a racist for absolutely no reason. You mentioned race, not me sister. Don't put that stank on me. We either have a country or we dont. The repubs want the cheap labor. The dems need to replace the ded
@sammierae70 Please use the correct legal term for the folks that have no respect for our sovereignty or laws. They are in fact illegal aliens. Collectively these poeple are an invasion force. Since your side has a propensity for killing their offspring, I realize the new voters are needed.
@sammierae70 If you have to ask that question, may I recommend expanding your sources of information streams, evaluate them all, then do the ad absurdium test on them.
@sammierae70 We actually agree on alot. It's just that my very well researched cynicism runs very deep. Again, I personally know the man who created the Clintons. The problem your side has with removing Trump, is the fact that he is selfmade. Therefore, the media can't destroy him. Good luck.
@sammierae70 I agree with the multi national corp hate here. Whether that level of power is amassed in govt or corps it wont have our best interest at heart. When you have that much power in both and they collude, then you have a fascistic cabal.
@sammierae70 That comment flies in the face of the facts.
@sammierae70 Promise me one thing...If you find something in the rhetoric of those you believe and respect, that makes you say hmmm...you will engage your critical thinking skills fearlessly, no matter the conclusion. And I'll  do the same. It's been an honor and pleasure.
@sammierae70 While the SJW types are busy trying to confuse little kids about gender, the tens of thousands of criminals in DC laugh and muse about how long they can maintain the roose. The carma will be devastating. Well Sammie, I'm probably not going to infuence your take on politics but
@sammierae70 Well, Calvin Coolidge said it best in his sequicentennial speech of 1926. If you truly want to understand progressives, reread that. I had hoped you knew more about the Clintons. The conspiracy is not theory, is it criminal. And oh how I wish it was just them.
@sammierae70 Don't you remember the  child rapist she laughed about getting off early in her legal career? That's the public stuff. Soon, mych more will be public. Folks that are cloistered in what they believe to be true, are about to be shocked. Hold on tight.
@sammierae70 Well that is the surface pablum. My sense is you are a good person. Perhaps a bit too incurios for your own good. Like I said, I know the creator or the Clintons public persona. The story is not all about feminism and 'social justice'.
@sammierae70 How old fashioned? Thomas Jefferson old fashioned? I thought you said you were progressive, which is nearly antithetical to old fashioned liberal in a spherical kind of way. If you are 'a progressive', which is somewhere between socialist and liberal-fascist, then you are foe
@sammierae70 She was definitely more liberal than Darren. Smarter? Well that's how men play 3D chess. After all, he was smart enough to get her to marry himüòÜ
@sammierae70 Many, however, are not good hearted. Nor are they taken in by them. They ARE them. And if this country is to be restored, they must be utterly and totally defeated. That is what keeps the breath of life in me. I will not flag. Are you friend, or foe?
@sammierae70 He could use a lesson or two in matters Costirutional, but his desire to return power to us is refreshing after all the phony lap dogs of the Bush/Romney cabal (goes back to George in the 60s), and the Clinton/Obama cabal.  I wish good hearted folks would not be taken in by them
@sammierae70 As for my support fo Trump, that's easy. He is an outsider. The dems, media, conservatives, and globalists all hate him, they know his success means their demise. The slithering globalist, agenda 21 cabal, is now in decline because he does not fear them. Their power is lessened
@sammierae70 Well Sammie, I  know the guy who created the  Clintons. Hillary is criminal 1st, idealog probably 3rd or 4th after her craven desire for power. Bill is a sex addicted rapist and drug addict. Not sure how someone as smart and nice as you can be taken in by them if that be the case
@sammierae70 @GloriaProject1 @talkin_rockin @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @ArizonaRonn Avatar. I had the biggest chrush on her when I was six. Yeah I know what you mean.

@Hillsdale freedom of action and curiculum is what you have as a result of not accepting govt funds. Even the  govt cant control thought yet
@HowardKurtz 2x. Trump outsmarting the media. Not a 'HUGE' feat. Present company excluded, of course.
@HowardKurtz Penny Lee. Fairest Dem I've ever seen on FOX. Not hard to look at either. Good get, Howie.
Thanks to Larry Nichols for making tonights program a thought provoking call to action. State governments are a huge part of the solution.

Hey Mr. Trump, please DO NOT apologize for handling the muslim and citizen statement correctly. We are counting on you to hold your ground!!
