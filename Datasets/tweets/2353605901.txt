We heard it again from Bernie:	.	The 2020 Democrat field supports government-run health care. 	 	That means eliminating all private plans, long wait times, and destroying the Medicare system seniors rely on.	 	Its $32 TRILLION cost means your taxes would more than DOUBLE, too.
Margaret Thatcher said, "The trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money."	 	To pay for Ocasio-Cortez's $93 TRILLION "Green New Deal," you'd need a 100% tax rate on nearly every household above the poverty line.	 	That's socialism for you.
Democrats never miss an opportunity to invoke our children’s futures to justify their socialist environmental agenda.	 	Give them the opportunity to protect our children’s lives from abortion AFTER birth?	 	Senate Democrats just voted NO.

Bureau of Economic Analysis data confirms that U.S. growth is coming predominantly from manufacturing, construction, and oil/gas development.		Industries that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton turned their backs on are booming under @realDonaldTrump!

Kamala Harris claims she didn’t know her top aide of 14 years was accused of sexual harassment, resulting in a $400K settlement.	 	Harris only fired him when a reporter found out.	 	Even her liberal hometown paper isn’t buying it, saying it's “far-fetched” that she didn't know.

.@KellyannePolls: These are not easy solutions but this is a necessary conversation. This is a @POTUS who doesn't just listen, he acts.
We need to come together listen and find ways to prevent these tragedies from happening again. @POTUS is intent to listen to these families - hearing their stories and asking how we can come together to find solutions.
This is not a partisan issue. Nobody wants to see something like what just happened in Parkland, Florida happen anywhere across the country. We do have to have conversations. But let's not let it divide us. Let it bring us together.
