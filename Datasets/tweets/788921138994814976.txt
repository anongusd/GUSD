@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity Not, I just don’t want ELECTED OFFICIALS getting paid to do Nothing&amp; intentionally stall the government which means problems for 100’s of millions of citizens, economy stalling, fewer jobs, etc
@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity And waste your tax dollars to create problems and prevent the government and the president from doing its Constitutionally appointed duties. There Job!
@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity No at work!
@Gyggy @seanhannity No you’re tax returns are private under the law! They can request but the irs can not release them without your consent. Every Court in the land would uphold that. &amp; is that really the Pandora’s box you want opened? Any Congress could then do that to any political adversary evenU
@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity Also again, laws from the House must be voted and passed by the Senate and signed by Trump to be a law! So 2/3rds of those 3 groups are Republican Controlled! Again dead locked
@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity In other words for House Democrats to have Trump removed from office it would take 2/3 of the GOP held Senate to vote in favor! That’s called OVERSIGHT! It’s why Bill Clinton wasn’t removed from office despite impeachment for lying under oath. Try again
@MaverickMort @leavinAtrail @seanhannity https://t.co/nOCtlRaB73
@Gyggy @seanhannity Read some civics, Any investigation can be reviewed by Senate, if found to have no merit to warrant opening or conducting impeachment hearings then the Senate can shut it down and begin legal action into house members involved. Balance of powers!
@Gyggy @seanhannity House can’t pass laws without the Senate! Civics 101

@independentat11 @seanhannity Actually 2010 was historically the largest. 60 seats flipped Red
@nwdem @seanhannity The problem is they are mysteriously finding ballots (80k) long after the fact. 2nd Snipes won’t report how many total votes were cast by law, so we don’t know if ballots are even legal or fraudulent, even after a judge ruled she had too

Dear Liberals: “when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth”-Sherlock Holmes	In other words, All Witnesses denied the events, &amp; no evidence exists. Therefore Kavanaugh told the truth! Maybe it’s improbable 2u but HE’S INNOCENT!

@utfeen @JordynMinSC @JohnCornyn Not true. Any federal crime can be presented to the FBI for investigation. Problem: this isn’t Federal Jurisdiction.  Senator Feinstein as part of the Senate Intelligence Committee Can also, and they denied it as they should. ZERO evidence to warrant an investigation

@buddha_314 @JohnCornyn He gave a sworn written statement though. New claims are the same: witnesses given by the accuser denied it happened
@ZemanLynnZ @JohnCornyn Not this photo. Every witness she named Denied it in sworn statements via their lawyers to the senate! Good try. She also didn’t name Kavanaugh to her doctor, also claimed 4 guys then 2 guys now 3 guys &amp; a girl present. All denied it!
@73SNAngel @JohnCornyn Non of them would permanently lean the Supreme Court Constitutional conservative either. Also, the rest of your accusations have been debunked
@utfeen @JordynMinSC @JohnCornyn False! The FBI rejected the request from Feinstein! Look it up! Second every single witness by both women denied it ever happened. Without anything else to corroborate their stories all you have is witness testimony. Witnesses they provided. Witnesses that denied it happened.
RT @JordynMinSC: @JohnCornyn We need to share this far and wide. https://t.co/Tt0HogFIoV
@plantz3610 @JohnCornyn No they’re not you’re under oath to the Senate when you testify. It’s not a job interview. Caught lying can result in felony charges. Not just a dismissal of your application to choose someone else.
@8BigNasty @JohnCornyn They have investigated the story and all of her witnesses denied it happened. There’s nothing else to corroborate it because it’s 36 years old and she doesn’t remember the time and place anything.All we have are witnesses and they said Kavanaugh is telling the truth.
@lw_kravitz @JohnCornyn Yes and his 36 year track record proves his honesty and integrity. She has no evidence in her witnesses all denied happened. There is nothing to investigate. Which is why she won’t show up to testify, because lying under oath is a felony.
@ekl79 @JohnCornyn Look your snowflake, lying under oath to the Senate is a federal crime punishable by prison. So due process and innocent until proven guilty still apply. She knows this that’s why she hasn’t shown up to testify.
@TheRealTonDrump @JohnCornyn @senjudiciary There’s no willingness by her to be heard. If so she would have been there already. She has nothing but witness statements. And all the witnesses she provided deny it ever happened
RT @TheaGood: @JohnCornyn Here is Senator Shumer conferring with George Soros' son,Alexander in an out of the way location in NYC https://t…
@buddha_314 @JohnCornyn Yes when there is something to investigate. All we have is HER Witnesses, and they have all submitted sworn statements to the senate now denying her claims! So, innocent until proven guilty.
@kijaso @JohnCornyn If you’re married or have a son, Dad brother etc. would you throw them under the bus and call them guilty if someone made this exact unsubstantiated claim about them?? I doubt it. Innocent until proven guilty!
@kijaso @JohnCornyn Show me the evidence and I am with you? Not her saying it happened, evidence! Her witnesses all denied the party and incident via sworn statements to the senate via their lawyers. No place, no time, no memory of how she got home. Nothing.
@rustinore @JohnCornyn @FBI @FoxNews Because the only facts available are witnesses testimony of which all have sent sworn statements to the senate denying it ever happened. Witnesses she provided!!!
@BigBaldFred @JohnCornyn Anita Hill got caught lying. She followed him to numerous jobs, called him repeatedly for advice all after the supposed incident. Oh and Katz represented her too. Sounds like you hate Justice Thomas cause he defied the Dem Plantation
@DureJane @JohnCornyn But what if he didn’t party in high school? I didn’t! No witnesses, that she provided, said it happened! And she has changed details of her story 3 times. Now she can’t come because she’s afraid to fly, yet flew to Hawaii &amp; New York🤔
@ZemanLynnZ @JohnCornyn More likely given the lack of evidence and EVERY SINGLE WITNESS that SHE gave all denied the event. That she is lying. Innocent until proven guilty. Otherwise anyone’s son, Dad, brother or husband can be accused, found guilty without a piece of corroborating evidence!
@TheStarsFan @JohnCornyn So neither accuser knows a date or place where it happened and remember how they got there or hit home, and every witness THEY provided gave sworn written statements that it didn’t happen. This study proves that some accusations can be false https://t.co/Yd1mz63OIb
@lw_kravitz @funkyconserv @JohnCornyn @lsferguson @GOP There is no site to investigate, only testimony of witnesses provided by the Accuser, which all denied it in sworn statements to the senate via lawyers. There is literally nothing to investigate. It didn’t happen.
@JuliaCitylaw @JohnCornyn In other words it’s possible a woman might lie about it, “possible”: A multi-site study of eight U.S. communities including 2,059 cases of sexual assault found a 7.1 percent rate of false reports (Lonsway, Archambault, &amp; Lisak, 2009). https://t.co/Lg5R9soyY9

JACKIE CHAN! https://t.co/ApRKcNyqVK
@JoieBryce @JamesFallows Law says the burden of proof is on the prosecution(the accuser). He’s innocent until PROVEN Guilty not just because she says so. If that’s the law you want, then your husband, brother, Dad, or son is by accusation not evidence. &amp; Real Victims will suffer for it
@JoieBryce @JamesFallows Nope. Said they should be heard, but they won’t show up. They gave the names of witnesses “ ALL DENIED IT”. They can’t remember where, when it happened, they can’t remember how got to or from the parties. In other words, no corroborating evidence. But he’s GUILTY just cause??

@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw Any way, thought I could have an conversation with you that didn’t involve being insulted. I see that’s not the case good luck following the emotional manipulators of the left. They truly don’t care about you as a victim. Sadly we are a means to an end for them
@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw But this is exactly why they should report when it happened not 35 yrs later. Witnesses accounts get worse as time goes by. Victims accounts also get more difficult to verify as well as harder to get convictions as it’s easier for def attorneys to create doubt
@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw @GOP She would need to file with local police in Maryland. But since she doesn’t know where it happened she doesn’t know which precinct or jurisdiction to file in
@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw @GOP Because nothing she claims is substantiated by evidence or witnesses. Where would they investigate? No crime scene no time frame? Witnesses SHE provided all denied it happened. Oh &amp; it’s not a Federal issue it’s a local LEO issue

@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw No my attacker was incarcerated for 7 years! Thanks for playing, I hope based on your standard of accusations and how you think the law should work that your son never gets accused without evidence
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw What if someone blindly accused your son, but couldn’t prove anything. Is your son guilty? No proof, just her word against your sons? He’s guilty right according to your thought process. Is that the law you want for your son
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw Why are you so quick to assume I’m not a victim? You mean the more you read from anti trump news sources about Kavanaugh. Anonymous sources. Dem Political leaked anonymous sources designed to smear him. Yeah right
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw And you don’t know if she’s lying or telling the truth, she has Zero corroborated evidence. How bout this...I claim you assaulted me 20yrs ago! I don’t remember where but it was you! Disprove it! You’re guilty until you do! How’s that feel?(hypothetically speaking)
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw And before you claim the polygraph story, you should know they are inadmissible as evidence because they are highly unreliable. A Russian spy in the 80’s beat it twice, she is a psychologist and capable as well
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw So no I’m not going to blindly believe her and destroy a mans life, family and career when she clearly hasn’t shown evidence or signs of suffering as she claims. Her grades didn’t drop, no behavioral outbursts, highly successful at her career long before her counseling.
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw 1st, she doesn’t know where or when the party took place, 2nd she doesn’t know how she got there or how she left the party, 3rd all of her witnesses deny it happened, 4th she told no one at the time, no friends or family to substantiate her claim.
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw Also, since nothing can be corroborated because she has ZERO evidence, we shouldn’t destroy a mans life. Innocent until proven guilty! Due Process! She has to prove BEYOND a reasonable doubt based on EVIDENCE Which she has none
@BuckyBuck2001 @Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw Because I am a victim, I also know how victims act, behave, I also know when someone is being falsely accused. She may have been involved in an assault, BUT SHE KEEPS GIVING WITNESSES THAT SAY SHE IS WRONG.

@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw Sorry for the rant, and blowing you up. But as a victim myself it bothers me to see this treatment of both for different reasons. 1 cause he is innocent &amp; 2 cause those around her don’t actually care about her story, just how it can be used!
@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw As far as Monica is Concerned, she chose to sleep with him, the others were assaulted, with corroborated evidence and witnesses afterwards. We didn’t hold marches for them, we shamed them! Shame on society for what we are doing here
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley But now we are crucifying a man with no evidence. Just her words against his. 3 witnesses that don’t support her story. And for what, political power &amp; gain. We are All Innocent until PROVEN guilty or We are ALL GUILTY by accusation only until we prove own innocence.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley What kind of jobs would he get? Would he have to change his name? Move out of state? Would he lose his family(wife &amp; kids)? See that’s why she should have reported it then! Told family &amp; friends immediately, To corroborate it now! But sadly she didn’t.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley If you have a Son or Husband or Father imagine someone doing that to them. Then finding out that he’s innocent, but the court of public opinion has already convicted him. What kind of life would they lead then, with every other person thinking he might actually be guilty
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Same lady that advised Anita Hill who was found to be a false accusation as well, is advising her &amp; her counsel. If this is allowed, then ANYONE can lay claim to anyone’s son, father or husband &amp; crucify him simply because he’s a man, not because there is sufficient evidence.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Feinstein won’t produce the letter to the Senate, not even her own colleagues. She had closed door interviews with Kavanaugh, phone interviews, more than 1300 questions writ &amp; verb &amp; never asked him. Never took it to the FBI in July nothing.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It’s sad for her, because I believe she has been traumatized, and should speak, but I don’t believe it was him. I think Feinstein is willing to destroy this man even if he is innocent rather than let him be confirmed. She had LTR 4 6wks, &amp; did nothing.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley If she had reported then, there would be more to investigate and substantiate her claim. But it would have been sealed anyway in juvenile records and in admissible. Unless she was closer to 17 than 15. In which case Brett would’ve graduated already &amp; n college, not HS parties
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Further more, as a victim myself at 11 years old in my driveway on an August night, assaulted by my sisters boyfriend after she went inside, I can tell you it’s why there is a Statute Of Limitations.
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley But it won’t be. It’s not a Federal case &amp; isn’t a felony. No crime scene, no corroborating witnesses, no time or date, 36 yrs later! The only people she named as witnesses all backed Kavanaugh &amp; she has nothing to dispute them with.
@Xpertnurse @BuckyBuck2001 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @kavanaw But just because Kavanaugh is a man doesn’t make him guilty simply because she claims it, with no factual evidence to support it, 36 yrs later, being handled by liberal politicians who don’t care about her just derailment Of Kavanaugh.

@g0lfn0w @goodgrace @ODBJD @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley About assaulting Mrs Ford? Yes I can!
@craftyguru @Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @OrrinHatch Again Anita Hill was different as the alleged crime scene was a federal building there for Federal Jurisdiction. They do not investigate routine sexual assault allegations unless it’s multi jurisdictional. Again she conveniently doesn’t know ANY DETAILS needed for that
@craftyguru @Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 3 witnesses named by HER all said it didn’t happen
@craftyguru @Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley So again as I pointed out, if it were there they would have found it. Every witness she named has told the SAME PRESS she’s talking to that it didn’t happen
@Buckleup36 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar None of those would apply as she claims she WENT to the party! So no kidnapping, no rape(her words) none of this would apply, and by her own words couldn’t be verified, by the words of the 3 people she named as witnesses who said it didn’t happen! So not applicable law!
@Martamendoza718 @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews They had dates &amp; times oh and a PHOTO of Franken...we nothing here! No house address or owners, no date, time, year and month even, nothing. Yet oddly Clinton’s victims remembered all that, Keith Ellison’s ex girlfriend has a 911 call to prove it yet not a peep from Dems for them
@tennbeliever @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews Did you support the VICTIMS of Bill Clinton....for Mrs Ford to be a victim, a crime has to have been committed. But since is STUPIDLY vague on details that would actually matter. Her claim can’t be substantiated. The 3 witnesses she named ALL said it didn’t happen!
@allanbrauer @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews Maybe...
@Jelloschotz @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews Nor innocent until PROVEN GUILTY. Which she has no evidence to support her claim.
@WarringtonCasey @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews So you march in support of false accusations regardless of the harm it does to the accused and their reputation? Because I didn’t see any marches for Clinton’s accusers! FYI an accusation isn’t evidence
@ScotchandYoda @patriot81700 @LilanFIERCE @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @corbyhankins Well you sure were GUNGHO in support of Clinton’s victims(plural) or how bout Keith Ellison’s ex girlfriend who actually has a 911 call of hers, or is it only important when the Accused is a conservative? FYI I am a victim, and I remember every detail of the night I was assaulted
@ScotchandYoda @LilanFIERCE @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @corbyhankins And no, because time of importance to her should have been the same day it happened! 3 witnesses SHE NAMED have now come forward and said it didn’t happen!
@amirdehghan_ @GovMikeHuckabee @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews And lying about sexual assault is no joke! You should be ashamed for believing this sham of a story.  No evidence, no date or time, not even a month or year, no address, &amp; 3 witnesses SHE NAMED said it didn’t happen

@craftyguru @Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley NUMBER 6 JUST TOOK PLACE IN JULY when she wrote the letter to Feinstein. The accusation is from 36yrs ago. She didn’t even mention his name to her therapist. Just that she was assaulted. So no, it didn’t happen on Federal Property therefore it’s not Federal Jurisdiction
@Buckleup36 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar Not a felony...number 1! It would be considered a misdemeanor, except there us ZERO evidence anything ever happened. So it would be past the Statute of Limitations
@Buckleup36 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar So yes 36 years ago is to long!
@Buckleup36 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar If the FBI has JURISDICTION! They don’t in this instance! And there is ZERO supporting evidence! Not heresy! Evidence! There’s not date or time, no address! Nothing! Just her claiming he did it. It would be considered a misdemeanor! https://t.co/0r56OTkQuS
@Buckleup36 @JLB99902 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar No she wasn’t. If she was then the fbi investigation would have resulted in an arrest of Thomas! Accusations aren’t evidence! You’re Journalist is actually part of the problem! Conjecture isn’t proof! Again no indictment, no arrest!!
@craftyguru @Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Then the OTHER 6 times he’s been vetted should have caught it if it was there right???? So no need for a 7th! Also, can’t investigate a crime with no crime scene, no date, no evidence at all. Just heresy from a professed biased person as evidenced by her Resistance rallies!
@RSandyLee333 @MplsMe @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley By her Attorney not by the FBI....ever hear of MKULTRA and hypnosis by the CIA to create Agents etc...You know she has a long history with the CIA as did her Dad! &amp; she helps recruiting efforts at Stanford for the CIA still! Read up!
@soctech921 @senorrinhatch @jaketapper @ChuckGrassley Tell that to the Circus your Democrat Leadership made this into trying to delay it!
@magpepper @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Anita Hill claimed it happened on Federal Property making it Federal Jurisdiction...where did Mrs Ford day it happened? Oh that’s right she didn’t say, she said she didn’t remember where.
@LilwskysChaos @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley No there isn’t. Christina King said she heard about it, but never gave details as to where, who’s house, time or approximate date...nothing...it’s called heresy and is inadmissible. Also she wrote “Christina and I are proud of what she(Mrs Ford) is doing” third party author!
@MJaMitchell @senorrinhatch @axman643 @ChuckGrassley Is it Federal Property? But actually no it’s the Secret Service who would investigate. You should look them up sometime and read all that they are involved in.
@DeniseNiecygee @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Kavanaugh has had 6 FBI backgrounds done...ALL CLEAN in his career!
@Xpertnurse @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Juanita Broderick ring a bell??? Are you saying all of Bill Clinton’s accusers should get FBI investigations??? One difference, they all remember every detail of time &amp; place etc...Mrs Ford doesn’t remember a dang thing! Strange how that happens on the eve of confirmation
@paradigmeyes @senorrinhatch @peaceliberty @ChuckGrassley When they have jurisdiction! They don’t in this case because Mrs Ford said it was a house party, that she can’t remember how she got there, when it was(month year something) no address or home owners name. If it was an FBI matter why didn’t DiFi turn this over in July?
@teacheconomics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Kavanaugh!
@PragueloverR @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Which have been proven false like for 2yrs now
@jsatz23 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley No he’s not....FBI had jurisdiction as it was alleged to have taken place on federal property by Mrs Hill! Mrs Ford said it was a HOUSE but can’t say where, what house, how she got there,  what month or year. Nothing! She conveniently doesn’t remember! I am a victim! I remember!
@JoanneAa @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Location???? Hill said it happened at work which was Federal property(jurisdiction)...read Mrs Fords claim(no time, no address, no month or year, nothing because she doesn’t remember it) I am a victim and I remember everything including what the air smelled like that night!
@DebraResists @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It’s not a corroborate statement. Read it objectively. She said they All Heard About It! So she wasn’t there!(that’s Heresy...not admissible) 2 she gave ZERO details of the ACTUAL PARTY like time, place, hell what month &amp; year? She is also Clearly bias by her last 2 paragraphs
@navysubmomx2 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley FYI... please this Christina King, said NOTHING about the party either. She said, “we all heard about it” she wasn’t there#1. #2 she rants about everything except the incident.#3 even without the accusation she said she is against Kavenaugh’s nomination which means BIAS!
@navysubmomx2 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley So Who’s lying???? Christina King or Mrs Ford? Mrs Ford said she ran out of the house and told NO ONE!!!! She said it in her letter and to WaPo! She doesn’t remember where, when, nothing! Mrs King remembers getting stood up by Mark Judge! Mrs Ford Not a thing!🤔
@MplsMe @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Anita Hill claimed it was at work which was Federal Property and therefore FEDERAL JURISDICTION! This wasn’t, there is no time, no month, no house or address nothing! Because she doesn’t know it. All victims remember where it happened! I remember where I was assaulted at
@ODBJD @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley But there isn’t any evidence to disprove! She made an accusation with no date, no time, no address, nothing! She can’t tell us if it was August 1982 or June 1981. Nothing to corroborate &amp; substantiate her claim! Only person she named said it didn’t happen
@ODBJD @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley No it isn’t. The burden of proof is on the accuser not the accused, or have we forgotten that the LAW states you are INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY! An accusation isn’t evidence!
@Leslieoo7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley All proven lies! Stop spreading false stories Snowflake
@Jimmyspolitics @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Because Hill claimed it took place on Federal property! “JURISDICTION”. We don’t have a time, we don’t have a place, nothing! Only person SHE CLAIMS witnessed it says “It didn’t happen” this is a stall tactic! To smear his reputation
@MontyBoa99 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Again, was it a Federal crime? Did the accusation take place on federal property(according to Anita Hill it did) that’s why they investigated. Mrs Ford doesn’t know where it took place or when.  I am a victim and I remember! She’s lying! Besides did Clintons accusers get FBI help
@JLB99902 @Buckleup36 @MixxDeb @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar And Anita Hill was a political hit as well. As history now proves
@MixxDeb @Buckleup36 @logtrucker7 @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @amyklobuchar First of all Statute of Limitations has long since expired! Second there is nothing to investigate if the accuser doesn’t remember ANY details(date, time, address etc.) I’m a victim &amp; I NEVER forgot those things! It’s a political hit Job!
