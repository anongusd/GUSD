#NVmining makes our modern life possible. The device you're reading this on, and nearly everything we use daily, wouldn't exist without it.
While only representing 2.3% of Nevada's workforce, #NVmining generates 4.9% to the State General Fund.
#NVmining contributed over $15 million to charitable causes in 2014.
While mining does have physical impact on land, mines pay bonds up front to guarantee the land returns to a natural state after completion.
Taking care of the environment is just as important as profit in #NVmining. The industry is on the cutting edge of wildlife protection.
Nevada miners worked 27 million hours in 2015, with a reportable injury rate lower than nurses and teachers. Safety is the number one goal.
The average #NVmining employee made $96,998 with 14 days a month off in 2015.
#NVmining means being responsible for employee safety, the environment, and the communities we call home.
Nevada accounts for nearly 15% of all minerals produced in the United States annually.
Every American born in 2016 will need 3.125 million pounds of minerals in their lifetime. 20 of those minerals are produced in Nevada.

Thank you Ginger for showing what a day working on a mine site looks like! Her's is just one of the many rewarding careers in #NVmining!
Time to head home…thanks NVMA for letting me take over your Twitter for a day and show people what I do at Marigold! https://t.co/zr9TjLCNO4
Whew, that was a busy day! On my way back to the office I spot some Mule Deer grazing on a reclaimed waste rock storage facility. https://t.co/I0A6aAcCEt
An important part of the systems operation, is exercising (opening &amp; closing) all the valves to make sure they all work (when needed!). https://t.co/VVqHbHmany
I’m down in our main pump house making sure the chlorine pump is working and all the system pressures are in the correct range. https://t.co/X2zXEFhB2E
As one of the site’s certified potable water operators, it’s my job to help ensure our drinking water system is operating properly. https://t.co/ORm5od9198
Now that the testing is wrapped up for the day, I’ve got one last task today.  Checking on our potable water system. https://t.co/pjz05netOS
Just another day at the office! https://t.co/lk7Hqqk6pG
We’ve also got to record operational data. But no complaints here because I get to watch a gold pour while writing down some numbers! https://t.co/c6B8hUocqY
Part of source testing is to collect raw material samples of the material entering into the mercury control devices. https://t.co/kB1Jcohvvl
Safety is a part of everyone’s job on a mine site and our Process folks found a fun way to remind themselves of that! https://t.co/sV30IAZggg
Marigold has reduced its mercury emissions from approximately 1000 lb/yr down to an average of 10 lbs/yr since 2007! https://t.co/4gIxB3nvMC
We do this testing 1-2 times per year to satisfy regulatory requirements but also to ensure our mercury control devices are working. https://t.co/5AHjIlndgv
Now, I’m off to our Process Building to help oversee source testing from our retort, furnace and carbon kiln. https://t.co/y5a6tZiUfT
Water quality samples allow us to detect any shifts in water quality in and around the mine site. https://t.co/r03bkgfD6X
Tracking water levels gives us important data for mine planning for the future. Water quality samples are also collected. https://t.co/qJZoj5Q1L4
We use a water level sounder to do this.  At this well, the ground water level is approximately 900 feet below ground surface. https://t.co/UO465K1WAX
Before I head back to the office, I’ve got to get the water level from one our monitoring wells. https://t.co/TezOpxT3GL
Now I’m off to do a visual inspection of our Trout Creek Dam, which was constructed to divert a natural stream around the mine. https://t.co/sLjq1vCyYr
It’s important to conduct stormwater inspections during storm events to ensure your stormwater controls are working properly. https://t.co/wlHr6CikoM
Our mining equipment costs tens of millions of dollars and is in opertation 24/7/365 https://t.co/NUegnvxIMW
Mining at Marigold in action! https://t.co/VN669kNLbI
Part of our weekly inspection is on our heap leach pads. Luckily I can do most of this from inside the truck because it’s cold out! https://t.co/6RrMtDcmiN
Things are looking great out here! https://t.co/L5QA3MMxjp
Since my staff is training today, I get to do the weekly inspection. This lets us check to make sure we are in compliance with our permits. https://t.co/v7Q60qfoaO
Before I can drive my truck on the mine, the first thing I do is a pre-op inspection to check for safety issues. Looks like I’m good to go. https://t.co/j9c1DsQ9c4
The stacks of paperwork never seem to go away…but they can wait today, it’s time to head out and complete our weekly inspection. https://t.co/us5asAHsOz
First this morning, annual environmental awareness training. All of our employees learn about environmental responsibility at our mine. https://t.co/79NTt7NpG6
When your alarm clock goes off at 3:45am, your day generally starts with a big cup of coffee (at least mine does!). https://t.co/Y7yV7vQxO2
