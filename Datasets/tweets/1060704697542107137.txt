@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Maybe we should take a good hard look into your college roommate Matt, doesn't that seem more important than Cohen's marital fidelity? What did he know? Should we tell everyone? Do you want to tell everyone first? You decide...

@mattgaetz Haven't met that special "lady" yet huh? What did your roommate know? I'm sure you wouldn't want that to come out now would you?

@realDonaldTrump We know you think voters are all as dense as your base but some of us actually read legislation and know that newborn infant children are already protected by law passed by a GOP House and a DEM Senate in 2002...

Okay let's see if we can send a message to the #GOP especially Mitch @SenMajLdr who thinks this is a power grab by Dems. 		Do you want to see a Federal Holiday put in place for election day to make sure that as many American's are able to cast a ballot as possible?

@DonaldJTrumpJr As opposed to your dad saying someone is too unattractive for him to sexually assault? Jr., this is hard for me to admit because I didn't think it humanly possible, but I think you are actually stupider than the old man.

@AskWrestlingGuy @01000011CS @thehill I'm pretty sure a business owner can say they won't serve anyone in a KKK hood but still allow others in say, a sweatshirt with a hood, to eat there... This is pretty much the same thing (if not exactly the same).
@DailyCaller A little projection going on there big guy? @ChrisChristie How low is that approval rating now?

@thehill If he was smart enough to "try to make up lies" they might actually be effective at convincing those with an IQ over 65 but he's a moron. Instead he just lies because that's all he knows how to do. He's a professional BS'er. Like when he said he was a Christian #FranklinGraham.

Donald Trump just caved again by trying to frame the video testimony we all saw as being "taken out of context" and "fake news". He knows that the Intel Heads tower over him intellectually and he caved before he got crushed. #TrumpCaved #TrumpsAWimp

Instead of spending 200 million dollars running a losing campaign for President to satisfy your ego @HowardSchultz why don't you insure 16,000 uninsured families for a year? How many billionaires would it take to provide medicare for all? Do the math people, you're getting played
When Michael Bloomberg and @HowardSchultz say "we" can't afford Medicare for all what they mean is that people like them don't want to give up some of their billions to make sure people aren't dying on the streets without health care because they might drop from 10 to 9 figures. https://t.co/DPrMdwT456

@realDonaldTrump you were handed the football on the five yard line, moved forward to the two, fumbled, recovered it on the 15 and called it a touchdown. You are an abject failure and it's only going to get worse when your crimes are further exposed. #ResignNowTrump. LOOK AT THE SON IN LAW!!!

@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes wow... you're so clever. Tell you what Dumb Donny, you don't have the guts to respond to one of my tweets with something actually intelligent to say. You are too much of a coward.
@realDonaldTrump Every time you tweet something like this it shows just how stupid you actually are. You brag about a high IQ but it's clear you never would have gotten past fifth grade if your daddy hadn't paid other people to do your homework. You'd be a homeless bum if not for Daddy.
@realDonaldTrump You are an effing embarrassment you draft dodging, compulsively lying, terrible businessman/deal maker, horrible husband, creepy father, adulterer, sexual degenerate, low IQ, piece of orange human excrement.

@HowardSchultz Let's discuss ways we can dissuade another New York businessman narcissist from helping to re-elect @realDonaldTrump. How about we just #BoycottStarbucks. That seems easy enough. Drain his cash cow.
Just what we need: another narcissistic businessman from New York. Just say #HowardSchultzNo. Run as a Democratic or Republican candidate in the primaries if you really have the cojones @HowardSchultz otherwise be an altruist with your billions like #BillGates or #WarrenBuffett. https://t.co/1noNzb5JC7
@HowardSchultz We don't want you but it's a free country. If you think wasting your millions on self promotion and becoming vilified by a large segment of the population is a good idea. You may want to take a cue from someone like @BillGates though and actually do good.
Uh oh Vlad, you're guy seems to be getting outside of the box. You better crack that whip and get him in line... May I suggest a 5 second preview of the pee tape just to get him back in his lane. #PutinsPuppet @realdonaldtrump https://t.co/CnhNlK6iUq
Good to know. Maybe someone can "bully" the Catholic Church into not protecting Child Molesting Priests anymore. By the way those of us with two eyes know exactly what the thug Sandmann was doing. He made @realDonaldTrump proud and that speaks volumes. https://t.co/cGZe3CIGmv

@cspan They don't honor your POS "President" they are showing up because they have to to hold onto the job they've held. Democrats did not cause this shutdown, as your own boss admitted. It's his, he'll own it, he's proud of it. Larry Kudlow is an ignoramus.
@SecretaryRoss and @realDonaldTrump claim to be worth about 12.5 Billion dollars combined.

The @GOP keep tweeting about how important a wall is to keep immoral criminals out of the country but they have no problem with an immoral criminal in the white house. #Individual1 is their guy and each and every one of them is responsible for his crimes now. #ComplicitGOP
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Without a Moral President the United States Constitution they swore an oath to uphold is left defenseless, vulnerable, and unprotected. You are complicit GOP and will be held accountable (like in 2018).
Here's the main problem with the Democratic end game for the #TrumpShutdown: Dems actually care about the workers affected while @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about workers period. He showed that in his business life and he's showing it now. He never pays ANYONE for their work.
Donald Trump thinks of foreign travel to war zones as PR. That's because when he went to Iraq (against his will - he was terrified) around Christmas it was for one thing only: PR. He lied to the troops and begged for their praise. What a pathetic "human being". #TrumpResignNow
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump The fact that you are proud of this response shows us all just how brainwashed and sadly misguided you are. You are following a criminal and there is no moment more painful than that of disillusionment. I feel sorry for you Paris.

So has @realDonaldTrump figured out that William Barr inserted himself into the position at the behest of his good friend Robert Mueller yet? My money is on him trying to withdraw the nomination and being told how bad it would look before he starts to Twitter bash Barr.

@thehill @TheHillOpinion The better question is "What dirt does Putin NOT have on Trump?"
Trump met alone with Putin (and Putins' interpreter) for almost an hour. Dumb Donald thinks that means there is no evidence of what was said there. Wrong. Anyone who follows Russia knows damn well that Putin recorded that convo and will spring it on @realDonaldTrump if need be.
@NBCNews Is there a bigger coward in the US Senate than Senator @tedcruz? I don't think so... Oh wait, of course there is: @SenMajLdr
@thehill Someone needs to let @LindseyGrahamSC know that until he starts looking like this and speaking on behalf of the ugly minority of hatred filled bigots (aka Trump Voters) his hero @realDonaldTrump could care less. https://t.co/Q7uKJxrKFq
Hey @tedcruz guess what? We are real people outside of Washington and we care about whether POTUS is working in the best interest of America or Russia. Just because we aren't the bigoted/ignorant 35 percent that make up your primary voters doesn't mean we aren't Real America.
So, wait, @HouseGOP SAID they were going to work to protect the collusion between the Trump Campaign and Vladimir Putin by sowing disinformation and attempting to discredit US Law Enforcement therefore weakening the centermost pillars of the Rule of Law??? #DoWhatWeThePeopleSaid https://t.co/KpEvrLnpDQ

@NBCNews #Sad. What does Trump have on Cruz? Or maybe Putin has something on all of them. Maybe Ted's dad really did help assassinate JFK and Trump has the proof? He did have that great PI in Hawaii that dug up all the dirt on Obama's birth certificate. #Oops.

For those prognosticators out there, this is how we'll know when #Mueller is nearing the completion of his investigation: #TrumpJrIndictment #KushnerIndictment. There's no way they would flip so he'll save those big fish for the very end when @realDonaldTrump will be powerless.

Why is @realDonaldTrump threatening to defund disaster relief in California? To distract from his former campaign manager's collusion with Russia while rewriting the GOP platform on Russia... Duhhh.
@KamalaHarris Donald Trump is using this empty threat to distract from his former campaign manager busting himself for working with Russian's during his time with the Trump Campaign to coordinate in exchange for forgiveness of his major debts. Probably with the blessing of @realDonaldTrump...

@realDonaldTrump You have absolutely zero idea how to end any of those wars because you've learned nothing about government in your time as "president". You have a staff around you trying to make sure you don't launch a nuke to distract from Russia. You will end as the most hated POTUS ever.

@thehill @HillTVLive That's actually a clear majority (65%) that don't want a wall and a minority that are braindead enough to believe an obvious con man (and the politicians that prey on them). How about a headline correction @thehill...

@americanduck8 @thehill I don't actually care enough to research whether the former POTUS would have a wall around his private property. It's completely irrelevant. The current "POTUS" lies non-stop. If you can't see that or you an apologist for it you clearly have no problem being someone's sheep.
Bold Prediction: If @realDonaldTrump somehow survives the next two years (politically) he will face multiple challengers in the primary from different wings of the GOP: Real Conservative GOP, Real Wall Building GOP, Real Anti Semitic GOP and @JohnKasich...

@thehill So what @LindseyGrahamSC is saying is that he wants Trump to preside over a non-functioning government where employees must work for no wages because the will of a small minority of the population is that we implement a racist policy for the country? Showing his southern roots.
@thehill The military should be the first to turn on this "traitorous" "President". He has no honor or discipline. He wouldn't last 25 seconds doing any of the work they do. He'd be crying that someone needs to hire someone to do it and then not pay them (see federal employees).
@politico It means the Trump/Conservative packed SCOTUS can still see that this is a really important investigation deserving of their attention and that's bad for Trumpelstiltzskin... Anyone that has seen the evidence is not stopping this because they know how bad it is (ie the fake AG)..
Because nothing says punk rock like a rich kid loser who got bailed out repeatedly by his daddies bank account and connections and whines about every little perceived slight against them. They probably think #Kesha is Punk Rock... https://t.co/FPCdvn85NZ

I really don't wonder about the 25-30% of @realDonaldTrump core supporters that are racist or very low IQ or something... what I don't get are the "Republicans" who make up the other 15 percent of his support. When did you stop caring about dignity or honor @GOP? #DidYouEver?

@thehill More lies. Trump is an obvious atheist. Unfortunate, given how many highly moral atheists there are out there, that the first clearly atheistic "President" should be a pathological lying sexual predator.
@stonecold2050 @vwheato This guy should totally be allowed to hunt lions. One stipulation: Place the rifle 100 feet away from the dude while he is 500 feet from the lion. See who wins that race. We could make a reality TV show out of it.
@TranslateRealDT @SFGirlJan "The President" didn't hand out the contract, "Donald Trump the executive" gave it out on behalf of the Trump Organization. It's a very cozy relationship where the Trump Org. subs out the wall and The Taxpayer pays for it and Mexico gets an IOU.

@CharlesMBlow Don't you need some ability to empathize to have emotional intelligence? Trump has none of that. He only fakes it when it's something Ivanka wants. Probably because he thinks it will help his chances with her someday (sad, but probably true).
@politico It's not a choice, he's too much of a moron to actually read and decipher/filter that information he has access to. He needs it spoon fed to his brain via whatever spox has his ear, be it Fox or Putin, Erdogan or Kim: why he's getting owned left and right.
Flat out lies. There is no wall. There is about 600 miles of fencing where needed. Only morons want 2000 miles of wall. Unfortunately @realDonaldTrump is just that type of moron and he's controlled by other morons (@AnnCoulter, Rush, @seanhannity, etc.) https://t.co/sPzYio4rE8

@realDonaldTrump So either you are lying or you are breaking the law. Which is it "Stable Genius"? I know, I know, it doesn't matter because your moron cult followers will believe anything. Start referring to yourself as "Supreme Leader", they'll follow, you'll see.
@asphalt873 @dbongino Why do you continue to slander a man like Bob Mueller? Do you have some evidence that he is crooked? He is investigating how a foreign power interfered with the sacred pillar of our democracy. WTF is wrong with u? Do u just hate law enforcement that much? Sad

Just remember what you said Cut-and-Run Rand Paul (our next Defense Secretary?) when we are watching Kurdish women and children die in Syria at the hands of the Turkish Army. It's time for Private Bone-spurs "I know more than the Generals" to #TrumpResign.
@dbongino Airplane, boat, ladder, tunnel, explosives somewhere along the thousands of miles that are un-patrolled... A wall won't stop people who really want to escape horrible things. This is so obvious that it requires the mind of an idiot to think otherwise. #TrumpLovesTheUneducated
@realDonaldTrump And we should believe this because??? It's coming from the same "stable genius" that is abandoning our ally The Kurds in Syria to be slaughtered by the Turkish as they "Take care of ISIS" for us. 		I like Presidents that don't leave their friends to die on the battlefield.
@JudgeJeanine @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @RepMattGaetz This is a great propaganda piece.

@CillizzaCNN Don't forget about FBI director, Attorney General, Press Secretary... Omarosa!!!!
Hey @GOP House members, maybe you can arrange another 49 votes to fund the border wall in the next couple weeks just so you can match your impotence exhibited on repealing Obamacare (and BS court verdicts don't count). Oh and @freedomcaucus say goodbye to any semblance of power.
@realDonaldTrump This is what you consider a victory these days? Sad... Pelosi is "Soon to be Speaker" because your party lost with their losing ideas (border wall, muslim ban, kowtowing to Putin). Why don't you get on the phone with Mexico, see if they have your money.
@treasonstickers No way. He has the emotion that wishes he could have sex with his "hot daughter" and hates his sons because he sees them as competition for his "hot daughter".
@cnni He also stated that "The fight is just beginning" the day before a government shutdown. Soooo... the past two years no one was fighting for the wall?
@PressSec Faux Christian @PressSec pretending to be in a successful administration when really she's just torched any hopes at a respectable career because daddy said it would be a good idea. #Sad.
@DonaldJTrumpJr -said willingly by no woman ever about DJT Jr.
@HeyTammyBruce Weird, the lame duck "Freedom Caucus" is irrelevant. #TrumpShutdown is on unless the POTUS grows up and faces reality that Mexico really isn't going to pay for his shitty wall and neither are We The People. (The real majority)
Hey all you whiny ass GOP representatives and leaders: We've been telling you this guy was unfit for several years now and you chose to bury your head. Now he pulls out of Syria and you put up the alarm bells? FOH. You want to do something? #25amendment

@DonaldJTrumpJr Not a smart man.. just like your father. The bill is DOA. Many of us don't want to be bilked out of 5.7 Billion dollars just to line the pockets of crime families like yours. Dem Senators #DoYourJob. If you want a #TrumpShutdown that's on you Jr.

RT @RyanLizza: We have actually been lucky so far. It can always get worse
@LouDobbs @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So you've basically admitted on here that you are not a journalist right? Could you use your vast economic intellect to explain how Mexico is going to get the 5 billion dollars directly to @realDonaldTrump? Maybe they can add it to the Go Fund Me site.
Or as we call it in the Biz: Thursday https://t.co/TDiiykL6eF
@HurdOnTheHill You forgot to include this in your tweet representative: 		I slept better at night knowing that General Mattis was protecting our nation, our allies, and our brave men and women in uniform FROM THE POTUS's stupidity and rashness.
@RepLeeZeldin #TrumpShutdown or didn't you see the video when HE invited in the press? This is your shutdown too congressman, don't worry, you can share it with him. Only one person looked like he wouldn't compromise in that room.
@GOPLeader You're aware that there are only insane people and morons left in the west wing at this point right congressman? Keep fighting for the mindless minions supporting your amoral leader though, why represent a majority of the country?
@treasonstickers @AnnCoulter It would appear that she has more pull than a clear majority of the country. Maybe someone can get her to suggest he follow through on his campaign promise to provide "Insurance for everyone" and that "nobody will be worse off financially".
@ChuckGrassley You mean while you shut down the government and allow a criminal to sit in the Oval Office? Not much I'd say.
@business @bopinion And it would be completely in line with @SpeakerRyan and @senatemajldr abdicating their duties to a moron in the White House instead of standing up for the American public. Let's make sure Mitch gets a present in 2020.
@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the tweets next year decrying General Mattis after he is able to be honest about your lack of intellect and leadership abilities just like Tillerson and General Kelly most likely too. Basically anyone trying to save their careers after fleeing your shit-show.
When this is your spokesperson, you've already lost. @StephenMillerAL your boss already took credit for the #TrumpShutdown so your spin is unsuccessful. PS it seems like the bald thing has been eating at you since HS, my condolences. https://t.co/DeiGAa6nzQ
@malloyjr88 Well, shoot Doc, I guess you better get on the phone with Mexico and ask them to wire that money to pay for your guy's wall because We The People sure as hell aren't going to pay for it. All the alt-right memes in the world you post won't change that.
Hey all of you donating to #GoFundTheWall rejoice because you have raised... wait for it, wait for it... 7 tenths of 1 percent of your goal!!! Even better though we've got a list of tens of thousands of you now to keep track of. #MexicoWillPayForTheWall oops.

@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Thank you for owning the #GrahamShutdown. We won't forget it.

@realDonaldTrump You lost Donny. #ElectionsMatter The American People never promised you a wall, you promised US that we would not have to pay for it. That's the problem with running a campaign based on lies. Eventually you are exposed. I have a solution: #ResignNow

@LaDonnaSmith17 @Jim_Jordan @HillaryClinton The Mueller investigation is actually in the black when you look at the millions gathered in unpaid taxes etc., but you small minded Trump minions wouldn't know much about revenue positivity. Oh and how many "false investigations" net 33 subjects charged? Keep spinning in fear.
Asking them to do math is like asking pigs to fly... https://t.co/Ua4UFtG1Am
@Jim_Jordan I agree, do what you said: Mexico will pay for it. If you can't get Mexico to pay for that wall you should resign now. Asking American taxpayers to pay for it is the biggest walk back of a campaign promise in modern politics.
investigation continue unimpeded. The only way @realDonaldTrump is getting anyone to shut down this investigation at this point is if he installs @DonaldJTrumpJr as acting AG. You waited too long Donny. You and the Trump Crime Syndicate are finished. #ResignNow.

@DailyCaller Can he introduce a Bill to force the GOP to grow their spines back while he's at it?
I actually agree with @AnnCoulter. GOP should starve the moderate Republican's of money and allow a massive Dem takeover. Good advice Ann. In fact you should probably advise all those low IQ voters that follow you: stop supporting the wall-less wonder too. https://t.co/rGWfzcahIS
@jaketapper @barbarastarrcnn @TheLeadCNN Trump is lying this isn't news. The message that must have been delivered from Putin demanding Trump pull out of Syria is the real story. Go find that Jake.

@realDonaldTrump Your logic is very sound here oh Stable Genius... Oh wait, no it's not... I meant to say you sound like a 9 year old that shit the bed and is trying to blame it on the family dog.

@realDonaldTrump What a small petty man. Still berating Jeff Sessions for doing what he was legally bound to do even after the man has scurried back to his burrow in humiliation. The "Law and Order" "President" who doesn't believe in law or order.

What is Trump's best Christmas Present to the Poor/Working Class/Trump Voter? #TrumpXmas #MAGA? #Obamacare #Trumpcare
I guess now that #Trumpcare has been deemed unconstitutional we should start seeing all those poor uneducated Trump Voters losing their insurance. It's sad when the chickens come home to roost, but hey, that's what they wanted when they voted for this conman.
@realDonaldTrump By replacing #Obamacare with #Trumpcare when you designed the billionaire tax giveaway and did away with the individual mandate you effectively made this happen and are responsible for millions losing their insurance now. #BloodOnYourHands
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations!!! You just kicked 20 million people off their insurance thanks to the changes in the tax plan you and the @GOP pushed through. Way to make the country better you conman loser.

@realDonaldTrump In other words: "I did it but it was that rascally lawyer's fault" That should hold up real well once you are kicked out of office and tried. What a dipshit this supposed President is. Lowest IQ POTUS ever.

According to this tweet your approval rating among your twitter followers is right around 0.1%. (Likes+Retweets divided by total number of followers or ~51,000/51,000,000 x 100) So basically @realDonaldTrump we all despise you and the rest are bots. #FraudTrump #DontheCon https://t.co/3IYjvvEVWM

When US Border Patrol sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. They're murderers. And some, I assume, are good people. https://t.co/vXtAMcznqq
@seanhannity When all else fails go back to the "Attack on Religion" victim stance eh? Christians must really be a tiny minority of the country facing persecution every day in America right Hannity? Trumpism=Victim Card Playing. #Sad
@DanielJQuimby @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Most of the actual people of the GREAT United States of America despise this snake oil salesman. The so-called "Silent Majority" of 2016 was actually just a sliver of the country: racists and power hungry faux Christians.

Look at this fat, sloppy, lazy "man"... I had thought the (real) President he resembled the most was Richard Nixon but now I'm not so sure... #FatTrump #LazyTrump #TaftTrump #OneTermTrump #MuellerTime #ProtectMueller https://t.co/lfjaEagCy0
What is happening in WI and MI is what happens when state electoral system are so broken by gerrymandering that the people's representatives have no fear of political reprisal and feel emboldened to go completely agains the will of the majority. #NoHonorAmongThieves #RIPWI #RIPMI
@funder Someone sulking because his new #FakeAG won't fire Mueller and protect him and his "kids" while also trying to hide the fact that he is a fat fuck?
@realDonaldTrump We know you are really just looking forward to the fact that Mueller is too decent of a man to indict your son or son-in-law during 41's funeral and that the market can't sink even further due to your incompetence as a "President". #MuellerTime
He was too busy with the internal reciting monologue "Oh Shit! What doe Mueller know? Oh Shit! What does Mueller know? Oh Shit..." https://t.co/yPJ9jUHMe3
@realDonaldTrump Lies exposed, lies deposed, liar enclosed. Orange on orange will be a good look for you DonJon Trumplestiltskin.

If @NancyPelosi suggests sexism because 80% of the signatories of a letter opposing her speakership are male when 80% of the House are male that falls a bit flat. Maybe she should propose to be speaker for two years and then hand it off to the next generation. #TimeForChange
@JacobAWohl So, this imbecile thinks law enforcement is there to protect his privileged ass from an obvious threat to come after him LEGALLY as a lawyer would. You know with a lawsuit. News flash kid, you're far more likely to end up behind bars than anyone else in this story. #sad #wannabe
The Crybaby in Chief, @realDonaldTrump is currently freaking out about the Mueller Investigation because?
@DICEY63 @AnnCoulter Reading comprehension not your strong suit huh? It's amazing how much the new GOP hates law enforcement. Mueller works for the American people and answers to the US Constitution. Trump is just an elected official who also works for us. #NoOneIsAboveTheLaw
@DICEY63 @AnnCoulter It's spelled Mueller. You know, the highly respected Republican former head of the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world. That Mueller.
@AnnCoulter You know exactly what a moral reprobate that scumbag in the Oval is. We don't need Avenatti to tell us.
RT @SenSchumer: Clean up the mess in the White House, and let Mueller do his job. We must pass legislation now to protect the Special Couns…
@SenMajLdr You have all the evidence you need in todays @realDonaldTrump "Official White House Statements" as seen on Twitter to reach the conclusion that the majority of Americans have as well as a bipartisan group in Congress: Mueller needs protection. #CountryOverParty #ActNow
I figured out @realDonaldTrump moronic ideas about needing ID for cereal. It's because he's the king of credit and has no cash. He's constantly using maxed out cards and getting ID'ed to check for fraud. Keep checking Mueller... Keep checking. #LowIQPOTUS
and for the record I could give two shits about Avenatti... If he's guilty lock him up right next to #LowIQPOTUS. Actually that might be cruel and unusual punishment.
Just watch all those people (including @realDonaldTrump within minutes I'll bet) who were screaming for due process and innocent until proven guilty for Kavanahhhh get on Twitter and demand the death penalty for @MichaelAvenatti after being arrested for alleged domestic violence.
@tennisx6 @AnnCoulter "Will say and do anything to further re-election and their corrupt ways. Just like Creepy Porn F*cking POTUS" 		I fixed your statement and made it more factual.
@lisalisa365 @AnnCoulter No, it's actually "your"... If you're going to be the grammar police you better get your sh*t together. Trump does love the uneducated.
@AnnCoulter Odd... your mentally unfit POTUS is still under criminal investigation and Dems still control the House in January... Don't see how this actually changes anything.
@AnnCoulter Not quite, the sexual predator is still in the Oval. Don't worry though, Roger is talking... Won't be long now.
Funny what some men think they look like and what they really look like... You might want to update those Twitter profile pics @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump #UglyOldMen #WhiteCracks #RealBad https://t.co/tJmwDq0EZR
Mueller likely already has @realDonaldTrump tax returns, the Dem House soon will... Almost guaranteed that there are impeachable offenses in them not that @SenMajLdr or the corrupt GOP Senate will act in good faith. https://t.co/66PI36CjiL
@seanhannity Is Fox "News" Sean Hannity stepping down as non-journalistic GOP political advisor?
@ChuckGrassley What a nice gift for her final two years in the Senate... not a token gesture at all GOP.

#GOP has a choice to show the slightest bit of courage here. We all know they won't (@SenMajLdr I'm talking to you). Their cowardice will be held to account. https://t.co/nvgZCCQOhy
This moron #LowIQTrump has never been to a store in his life to buy cereal and doesn't even vote half the time. Let's have an empathy test before voting or being allowed to hold office. That would take care of 90% of this administration. https://t.co/5R7RFtQwcM via @intelligencer
This so-called President has the thinnest skin of not just any POTUS before him but possibly anyone before him. It's up to us to hurl the insults that we don't want our politicians hurling. #LowIQTrump can't actually compete with intellectual challenges. #Sad #Allthebestwords
#LowIQ @realDonaldTrump is unravelling. Just wait till Jr. gets indicted. I think it's safe to say the fat old man in the White House isn't going to lower his blood pressure any time over the next two years.

Wonder if the #InvalidAG is getting a little worried right now about getting thrown under the bus now that his guru apparently has "never met him"... Still time to recuse pegboy @MattWhitaker46 or better yet, step down.
Remember when @realDonaldTrump was a big man and stood up to the NRA? Said he was gonna take guns no due process? That was before someone told him they spent $30M Russian money to elect him and someone else told him what due process meant... #LOWIQPOTUS with blood on your hands.

RT @KamalaHarris: We need to pass legislation to protect Robert Mueller’s independent investigation. Sign our petition if you agree.
If Matt Whitaker sees the evidence Mueller has and turns it over to a POTUS under investigation and accused of criminal behavior OR shuts down the probe, he can share the cell with #DonTheCon. #ProtectMueller #WhitakerInvalid
@realDonaldTrump Whitaker is illegitimate and therefore during this time anything the DOJ would do is illegitimate. #ThePurge is upon us. #WhitakerInvalid
As long as this fake Attorney General is in place there can be no law enforcement. #ThePurge is real. Any criminal apprehended during this time can argue this in court.
