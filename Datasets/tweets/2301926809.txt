@ajbsales @nzhippygirl @PvoterGo Yes, golf at Mar-a-Lago. 		I'm sure Trump will feign ignorance but a lot of it went into his own pockets.
@ajbsales @nzhippygirl @PvoterGo And the  innocent or guilty refers to a court of law. You can't be sentenced without having had your day in court.  It doesn't mean we as private citizens can't think some people are guilty as heck if the evidence in front of our damn eyes points to a certain direction.
@ajbsales @nzhippygirl @PvoterGo We have already established that you don't know what's in the public court documents so pardon me if I don't take your word for what evidence there is or isn't.

@ajbsales @nzhippygirl @PvoterGo So what you're saying is that the reason you're able to confidently claim Mueller has found no evidence is because you have no idea what he's been saying in court. 	Manafort gave 2016 polling data to a GRU agent

@siano2020 I'm sure some people mean well but some True Believers I've come across seem to use it intentionally as an insult, a way to put down and dismiss everyone they disagree with so "I'll pray for you", seems to mean, "I'm right and you're wrong" more than, "hope God blesses you".
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl Congrats for beating up strawmen that you made up. No one ever said that no woman can be super wrong and convinced they're right. 		People find it a useful concept because they see it happening a lot. Sorry about that.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl Mansplaining is pretty much defined as a man confidently explaining something to a woman that he's totally wrong about.  This sometimes happens. Yes? No? If yes, then mansplaining exists. 		I have no idea what I'm supposed to be quantifying.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl Strawman, nobody is saying that no women are confident or that all explaining is 'splaining.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl Lucky we are then that no one said that.  Care to revise your earlier statement that mansplaining doesn't exist? Or is it not extraordinary arrogance and ignorance because you said it?

@Chinchillazllla I love that he has a certicate in editing
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl I'm a girl so I'd be womansplaining.	 	People could reasonably disagree whether some particular person is  mansplaining or not but to claim it doesn't exist you'd have to claim that no man confidently ever explained things that he was totally wrong about. This is plainly BS.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl No one said that and you know it. Mansplaining implies a degree of spectacular confidence combined with being very wrong. And you know it makes absolutely no sense to claim this never happens.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl But just because a woman explains things to a male does not automatically make her a hypocritical "womansplainer". She could just be right.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl Other people's potential hypocrisy regarding whatever they may have said has absolutely no bearing on whether mansplaining exists. (Hint: we have all seen it happening)
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl If people do the exact thing they say doesn't exist, that's lack of self awareness, not a circular argument.
@4everNeverTrump Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Give a woman a dollar and she can eat a dollar.
@Highlandfreethi @iamAtheistGirl I wonder if anyone ever managed to argue that mansplaining doesn't exist without proving that it does

@TheRuseCruise Ok
@TheRuseCruise Hm okay.  		I found it ironic that some of the worst comments under the Gillette ad practically oozed toxic aggression while they were trying to prove  allegationss of  toxic aggression were unfair.
@TheRuseCruise I guess we all have our better side and worse side. The trick is to keep the good side forward more often
@TheRuseCruise We should figure out ways to do something about that, not blame the people who see violence as a problem
@TheRuseCruise Hormones may make you horny but they don't make a rapist.
@TheRuseCruise Actually I don't think a lot of people ever claimed that males are toxic, rather that the attitudes about masculinity and gender role expectations contribute toxicity... i've certainly seen some indications of latter.
@TheRuseCruise The ad that I saw made no blanket statements, just illustrated a number of  problematic behaviors (not all illegal at that) . The message was that it might be good to look at oneself and recognize how one could be better.		I  def have room for improvement in many areas
@TheRuseCruise It's legal to practice kickboxing  or take risks on Wall Street.		 Being male doesn't make anyone a criminal.
@TheRuseCruise To recap: Men are more violent because testicles. That's just the way it is. The problem lies with the people who talk about it and want  to do something about it.		If males were toxic  what would be different?
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Aggressive behavior is a choice. Risk taking is a choice. 		Nothing in male biology says they must break the law.
@TheRuseCruise I agree that men are stronger but that in no way means they must decide to do crime, it just means they're more likely to overpower female victims if they try.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Thank you. If we agree that men can make decisions and learn to take responsibility for their behavior your argument that targeting male behavior is useless because biology completely falls apart. Even if all males never learn we could reach 1 or 2 or 3....
@TheRuseCruise No man is ever forced to commit a crime to keep the gender ratio constant. They can decide not to.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly males couldn't have made better decisions.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly You claim this without any actual evidence that men are uneducable and beyond all hope, doomed to commit crimes because of their biology. We know it's not true because many men in fact decide not to commit crimes. There is no logical reason to believe that none of the criminal
@TheRuseCruise That made no sense. Crime rates as such don't tell us why somebody decided to commit a crime but that says nothing about the changeability of the behaviors or the circumstances that influence people's choices. Crime rates change, therefore they're changeable.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly No, it's moving goal posts, conflating two issues. They were brought up because currently men seem to have a bigger problem with violent crime and that point  stands, even though we can't further use those stats to prove something they weren't designed to prove.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Whether there is a violence problem does seem extremely  relevant to me if we are talking about anti violence ad...
@TheRuseCruise Yeah the world will never be a perfect place but perhaps we still  could try to make it a bit better.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly They were brought up to illustrate that males seem to do more crime and therefore it seems worth our while to try to do something about it. The fact that we can't use those stats to prove the efficacy of an intervention does not invalidate the original point.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Two different issues. Crime stats are extremely  relevant when determining whether there is a problem with crime  that needs intervention  but hardly informative in determining whether a Gillette ad  changed any behaviors.
@TheRuseCruise The artistic decisions of the ad agency may of course be criticized. Likely there are enough "boys will be boys" messages and examples of men getting away with shitty behaviors that misogyny will probably survive this campaign. But we'll see.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Okay but the same argument applies,  the effect of media in general on crime rates is not easily pinpointable in statistics.		Anyway I'm hopeful that stuff that makes people more aware about their behavior might be useful in other ways.
@TheRuseCruise What was the point again?  If  an anti violence campaign works and reduces male violence it would be good. If it reduces female violence,  also good. But you can't pinpoint the effect of a single campaign from a table that has tons of factors involved
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Statistics tell us many interesting things but unfortunately there will never be any that tell us what effect this particular ad had on anything because it's not a controlled experiment.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly We can look at statistics. What we can't do is claim without any evidence that the gender split must always remain the same no matter what.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly No why would I admit something we can't know? Whether this ad will change anything is debatable but  it is certainly possible for something to increase or decrease either male or female crime rates differently so that the relative proportions change.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly If fewer arrests are the result of less crime that would be ideal.(However, fewer arrests might be the result of  less effective crime solving or changed policies regarding incarceration. )
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Here it is again. The 1st column, total number of persons arrested, is about the levels of crime regardless of gender.  (Noting that arrests are not convictions &amp; this says nothing about how many crimes no one was arrested for or whether m/f criminals get caught at the same rate) https://t.co/QyODoK82sz
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly Yes, terrible people who don't care about fragile male feelings.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly If people's aim is to reduce violent crime, generally they would like to see decreasing rates of violent crime, no?	 	We will never know what effect, if any, this particular ad had though.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly I have  no idea honestly. If it's just an ad and can't possibly help because nobody cares about ads anyway then there seems to be no reason to be mad about out of control feminists blaming males unfairly because it's just an ad and nobody cares about ads anyway.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly You have presented no evidence that this is true. It is in no way logically impossible to that  something would change either male or female crime rates disproportionately. 		 As long as males commit more crimes targeting them certainly seems worth a try.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly "don't tend to be" is not an absolute statement, just a tendency. It's possible for some nice guys to feel triggered and for some total dickheads to nod and say what a great ad.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly We'll see... Online uproar doesn't necessarily mean bad business. Supposedly Nike lost a lot of customers after the Kaepernick ad and they had great sales anyway.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly I can try to counter if you can state more explicitly what doesn't follow from what. What those crime statistics tell me that there is a problem and we should probably try to do something about it. You haven't said anything to convince me otherwise.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly Yeah no one says so but if rapists buy products they've likely been influenced by ads just like everyone else.		 No one expects a single ad to make a good person out of a rapist but ads are part of culture that shapes general attitude, discussions and children's upbringing .
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly From what I've seen online nice reasonable men I follow don't tend to be triggered about it because they know it's not about them. The ones who are angry are the usual misogynist suspects who rant about metoo, etc.  Funny why that is.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not logical
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly It explicitly says some men are cool.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly Citation needed. I've seen people who rape and harass and buy Gillette razors.
@TheRuseCruise @WilDonnelly Excuse me. What? If we can reduce violent crime I'm absolutely in favor. But you're against trying because there might be too few women in the remaining perps?
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly We have established that you are against anti violence campaigns but I have yet to see any good reason to.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly We all need to be taught a million things about decent human behavior, and there are some things that we're often  taught but probably shouldn't be.  If you are a violent jerk you can't just blame your testicles if other people who also have testicles manage to be good persons.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly We agree that it would be stupid but fortunately no one was saying that. @riotwomennn's point was that if the stats were reversed, anti violence campaigns targeted to women would be a good thing. What were you saying about reading comprehension again?
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly If males can decide not to commit crimes it follows that there are other factors than mere biological maleness influencing those decisions. And let's face it, Gillette wouldn't sell so many razors if their ads didn't have a history of changing male behavior.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly Ads are part of the cultural influences that surround us and shape our attitudes and experiences, which absolutely have an effect on whether we decide to commit crimes. If males are taught that they're doomed by biology to be violent idiots, that too can shape attitudes.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly I will write this slowly If it helps. Men can be not-criminals. Therefore being male does not make you a criminal. If a man, or a woman,  commits a crime it's because they  decided to. Men, and women, can also decide otherwise. You're welcome

@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly If they can't they need to be in jail.
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly Wait wut? In the same 3 sentence tweet you just argued both in favor and against men's ability to stop themselves from committing crimes. The fact is, if they can decide to not do crimes they can be influenced in that decision, including by ads and other cultural influences.
@noronorand @riotwomennn @Gillette Do you disagree with the message or nah?
@TheRuseCruise @riotwomennn @Gillette @WilDonnelly If a man can't or won't  act in a non aggressive non destructive manner because of "biology", that sound smart to you?
