So @DrJasonJohnson I leave my place, turn on the @Xfinity app on my phone as I get in the @Uber and Feinstein is being questioned by Cornyn? What the hell was going on? #Ford #Kavanagh
Kavanaugh loves his talking points. But they don‚Äôt fit for questions like ‚Äúare you OK with an FBI investigation.‚Äù #Ford #Kanavaugh

Why can‚Äôt #Kanavaugh just say he drank a lot in college? @DrJasonJohnson #Ford
Grassley is the Sheila Jackson Lee of this hearing. He can not stop talking in between questioners.  #Ford #Kanavaugh
Hatch just messed up. Bringing up numberous allegations and asking #Kanavaugh when he heard about them is dumb strategy. #Ford.
#Kanavaugh apologies to Klobuchar for asking her if she drinks etc. Good move. #Ford.
#Kanavaugh dodges the FBI investigation again and again and again. If you‚Äôre innocent why? @DrJasonJohnson
You have to wonder why #Kanavaugh doesn‚Äôt want an FBI investigation, hmm #Ford
Is Grassley good PR for the Republicans? This is where Mitchell talking is a GREAT idea. #Ford #Kanavaugh
#Kanavaugh keeps asking if the #Senators have a drinking problem. Who thought that was a good idea? #SCOTUS
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to answer questions‚Äù until Leahy asks me about Mark Judge or Durbin asks about the FBI #Kavanaugh #Ford
#Kavanaugh knows how to burn time off 5 mins. Does it very well.  #Ford
So I guess ‚Äúfemale assistant‚Äù Qs to #Kavanaugh from #Mitchell that included the words "penis" and "your face" prompted Graham and Cornyn to decide that righteous filibustering was a waaay better idea. #Ford
This guy on the Supreme Court #Ford #Kanavaugh https://t.co/9kVeL4vE5D

But when #Kavanagh was investigating Bill Clinton he could care less. #Ford https://t.co/eV3KPpWbk7
#Kavanaugh opened up with a highly partisan angry political statement. Why should someome with this attitude serve on #SCOTUS?  #Ford

@_BrianHarris Right.
So now Grassley is stopping the clock when the witness pauses? That‚Äôs new. #kavanagh #Ford
Brilliant R prosecutor Mitchell is fixated on process of how the story came out and very little about the specific allegation against #kavanagh ... #Ford
If Graham wants to talk so much then why doesn‚Äôt he question #Ford instead of deferring to Mitchell? #kavanagh #Ford
Why does Lindsay Graham think he can just talk anytime like he‚Äôs the Chair? #kavanagh #Ford
@ChineduAchebe That‚Äôs right.
