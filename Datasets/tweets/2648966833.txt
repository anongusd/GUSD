@kps427 Speech that threatens violence against others is not protected in any state. But the issue here is that most of us on LI believe that white supremacy is a scourge that must be eradicated. You clearly do not. You are entitled to your opinion but we reject your hatred.
@kps427 What kind of person rifles through laws looking for legal justification for his racism?
@TRiddle_Me_This I see. You do stop short of supporting the white supremacists and instead try to deflect this group on “the left”. I stand corrected.
@kps427 Except by Communists? Free speech that harms or defames others is not protected. For example, free speech by people espousing racial hatred.
@TRiddle_Me_This It seems you are defending white nationalists. If I misunderstand your position, please clarify.
@RepLeeZeldin This is a good start. Also some of the prose looks familiar but it is ok to borrow phrases from me in the interests of fighting white supremacy. Thanks for speaking out finally. More work to do, Congressman. Read this comment thread!

Party leaders talk about ballots in possessive terms. “Who will run on OUR line.” Ballots belong to the people, not parties. One thing I love about Greenport Village politics is that there are no parties. You get yourself on the ballot and voters choose who the they want to serve
Moreover, when an elected official starts to seem desperate for a job vs. following a calling to serve, it’s time for a new elected official. I am sorry to say Judge Hughes will not be getting my vote regardless of which party puts him on the ballot.

@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi OK Congressman, let's give it a go here on Twitter. Make DACA the permanent law of the land and you get your $5.7B concrete wall.  Deal? If so, get your caucus behind it, get @senatemajldr to stop abdicating the responsibilities of his office, and let's get the govt open.

But it makes you stop and consider: What if the Steele Dossier was 100% accurate all along?
If @BuzzFeedNews report is true, a President who puts his country first would step down. This guy will force us to remove him by impeachment and he is pathological enough to try to deploy the military to protect his presidency. This could be a challenging time for our republic.
If you want to understand the President’s philosophy of governing, this is it in a nutshell: Congressional delegation to visit and thank our troops grounded because of his tantrum. Yet the govt can somehow afford to send his wife and kid to spend taxpayer $$ at his own resort.

@StevenPKramer @BrockWolf6 @jgrecoj @VisitLeeZeldin @ZeldinWatch1 @BackCheck_ @SoutholdDems Correct. It requires people getting out and knocking doors. I asked the campaign if they wanted us to go west and help out. We were told to stay and work the North Fork.
@StevenPKramer @BrockWolf6 @jgrecoj @VisitLeeZeldin @ZeldinWatch1 @BackCheck_ @SoutholdDems And Southold had the biggest swing. All because of stellar leadership from @Damon_Rallis and Chairwoman KCQ, and grass roots volunteers. I’m sure they would be happy to share with other committees how they did it.

Here's the difference between the two campaigns. We had 8 people there from 4:45A on handing out flyers with the @Newsday and @nytimes endorsements. They strolled in at 6:45, kibbitzed a bit before taking photo ops. We kept handing out PG flyers and wishing commuters a good day.
For all the "@CNN Sucks" chants at Trump rallies, you'll never see @donlemon or @jaketapper giving stump speeches at a candidate's rally like Hannity is doing tonight. The hypocrisy is astounding.
@MargaretSchoenf @perrygershon Enjoyed meeting him and everyone else! Go Perry!
Got up early to #GOTV at Ronkonkoma along with 8 other fired up volunteers from the 4:58 on. Look who sauntered in around 6:45am with a huge crew of PBA canvassers.

Well, I think we all just learned why @leezeldin doesn’t want to appear in public for debates. My favorite moment was when @perrygershon shut him down on the oil drilling investment lie and you could see LZ realize he’d played his pocket queens and his opponent was holding aces.

And we need to flip the NY Senate and support @NYGovCuomo as he continues to fight the horrible and hateful policies of this maniac simpleton president. NY is the last line of defense!
Let’s get to work, New Yorkers and Long Islanders. It starts at home. Let’s get the Congress and Senate flipped. Let’s get new blood in the leadership and let’s impeach POTUS and this lunatic sexual assailant who just got on the court. We went high. We lost. Bigly.
The right wing nut jobs who want this to become a patriarchal theocracy where women must ask men for permission to sneeze are not the majority. But via the Electoral College and the Senate, places like Iowa and South Carolina have an outsized influence on our government.
McConnell and the GOP bring bazookas to the fight. Schumer brings a pea-shooter. I am tired of his whining. It is time for new leadership who will take the gloves off and save our Nation and our Constitution.

The movement behind @perrygershon in NY-1 is primarily driven by women, some of whom are new to political activism. It is amazing that LZ supports a political agenda from POTUS that treats 50% of the electorate as second-class citizens. It’s LZ and GOP who are not thinking.

@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters @perrygershon I see. Another LZ supporter from outside the district. I wish you luck and thanks for the discussion. Agree to disagree!
@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters My point is: We have an LIRR and the places who get our federal tax $$ do not. We deserve the SALT deduction and my Congressman let me down...again. I’ve said my share of four-letter words about the LIRR over the years, though.
@LindseyGrahamSC So you are Team Cosby, Team Sandusky, Team Abusive Priests. What’s wrong with you?
@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters Also I suggest you visit a “third world” aka developing nation. It’s different.
@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters Psst: Welfare is funded by federal tax dollars. If you are unhappy with how it is currently funded you should vote for @perrygershon. GOP controls all three branches.
@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters Go ride the trains into Birmingham, AL or Dallas and let me know how they compare. I consider it a privilege to live on LI and I just want a Congressman who acts like a NYer not an unhinged right wing nut. Cuomo’s approval ratings are way higher than POTUS that I can tell you.
@psc_yankees @realDonaldTrump @LCVoters POTUS repealed SALT. We have the best schools and infrastructure in the nation and most of our federal tax dollars get spent in Trump country. Rebate on taxes has been in place for years. Now we must pay ridiculous free handouts to farmers to fund tariff insanity. LZ supports!
@realDonaldTrump A further stain on my Congressman's record. He is among the lowest rated Congresspeople by @LCVoters. He just raised our taxes and increased our healthcare costs. He also actively fights for a lunatic's right to bring an assault rifle onto LI from wherever they came from.

@MissTanya @lsilverbush @tomcolicchio Doesn’t have to be. We have work to do!
@shapirobeth @lsilverbush @tomcolicchio We live in a purple district. That brings out some crazies. I'm part of a group of people trying to unseat our Trump-loving incumbent Congressman and it's an uphill climb. But this level of hatred is a shock to all of us. Further underscores why we need to flip NY-1.
"White Lives Matter" pamphlets in Calverton. KKK pamphlets on the South side. President supporting white supremacists. @SoutholdGOP and @RepLeeZeldin silent. Regardless of who you support in NY-1 election, put out your signs with pride. Solidarity with victims of this attack! https://t.co/PjrpAW910g
@odlax5 @tomcolicchio @lsilverbush Agreed. The problem we have is that the vast majority of our local elected officials have refused to condemn the rash of hateful actions over the last couple of years. But there are a lot of us out here who do and will continue to fight for justice
@twumpat @Sean_M_Lewis @lsilverbush @tomcolicchio Look I'm ashamed that I live amongst people who would do something as sick as this. I just don't want the world to think we're all hate-filled anti-semites. Please don't define the North Fork by the acts of a handful of hate-mongers.
@lsilverbush @tomcolicchio The vast majority of us condemn this nonsense- just one or two really bad apples around here who take things too far. This is not who we are. Must have been a horrible thing to wake up to but please know that we support each other in this community!
@tomcolicchio @perrygershon @leezeldin Mr. Colicchio we may have a couple of really bad apples out here on the North Fork, but the vast majority of us are good people who condemn this nonsense. Welcome to our community and know we've got your back!

This, my friends, is the kind of leadership you deserve and can expect from me for the next 4 years. Vote Roberts on 3/18.
I am the only candidate in this election for any position with a clearly defined agenda for my work on behalf of Greenporters.
My platform has been published on http://t.co/MkXBNytRU4 since November. I am committed and transparent about my goals for Greenport.
Welcome to the race, Bill Swiskey! Look forward to what will, I am sure, be a spirited dialogue about Greenport's future. Good luck, sir.

By the way, it is almost 6 weeks until the election and no candidate forum scheduled. I will begin plans for hosting my own soon.

Grateful to our village road and utility crews and fire dept. for all the hard work to keep us safe during the storm.
The Village's Twitter feed announced an hour ago they will be towing cars today! Please get your cars off the road!
@VOGClerk @thesuffolktimes By what time do cars need to be off the street to avoid towing?
RT @VOGClerk: The Village will be towing cars today, at the owner's expense, that are left on the street! Pls remove your car ASAP.
@northforkoyster Love Storm Cam, guys! Be safe.
Everybody be safe in this storm. When I am Trustee, expect some proactive communication about utility status during weather events!

Tonight VB distributed Code Enforcement Reports to public. We're already affecting change in this government. Let's keep it up! Vote 3/18.
Let's enforce code, make sure bldgs safely occupied. Can't waste time and $ on zoning conversation if Greenporters aren't asking for change.
But if you have strong opinions about R-2 I want to hear them. We need to maintain affordable housing for young families &amp; retirees.
R-2 zoning was also discussed by Code Committee. Bob Kiehl raised issue in fall. Not one voter I've met is interested in getting rid of R-2.
Today the Code Committee will recommend to the VB that they seek formal public feedback on AirBNB rentals. Get involved! What is your take?
Remember! You can't speak at Vill Bd Work Sessions. But you can let it rip at my Meet and Greet Tue after the VB mtg. Old Bait Shop 730.

The public isn't allowed to speak at VB Work Sessions, so bring your ideas, gripes, feedback to Little Creek. I will listen. No gavel zone!
Next Meet and Greet with me is Tuesday 1/20 7:30ish (after VB Work Session) at @northforkoyster in old White's Bait Shop.
I invite anybody running for office in Greenport to join me for conversation with Greenporters about the future of our village any time.
The election is in a little over two months. It is very easy to figure out where I stand on the issues. Where is everybody else?
As far as I am aware, I am the only candidate with a website, a social media presence, and who has gone on the record with my platform.
Greenporters deserve an opportunity to hear from candidates for Mayor and Trustee and ask questions of us to inform their decisions on 3/18.
More sad news of a death in an alleged DUI case. As Trustee, I will make sure everybody in Greenport knows where to find a cab.
How do we reconcile these things? What are your ideas for event policy in Mitchell Park? Let's get this right! Tweet or Comment your input.
I think Mitchell Park and marina need to create revenue so we retire debt faster. However events there need to always be open to public.
Thursday's Meet and Greet at @northforkoyster is going to happen Monday night after the VB Work Session instead, 7:30ish. Join us!

Or you should send your thoughts in on your own.  You can reach Clerk Pirillo @VOGClerk or email her.
Anybody with ideas for Code Committee on these issues email or @ me and I will include in my comments. Public may only comment by email.
Interested Greenporters should join me at Code Committee meeting 12/15 3pm at VH. R-2 zoning and AirBnb will be discussed.
I will lead initiative to bolster existing after school and summer edu opps, including maritime ed, for Greenport's kids via our rec program

Our Village Govt should lobby the Southold Police to enforce the crosswalk laws to protect pedestrians in the Village.
We can increase the number of spots on Front and Main Streets for disabled folks. Those who are able are encouraged to walk!
We can use the Polo Grounds and campground as auxiliary lots and offer a free shuttle into town.
We could offer year-round residents free parking stickers to exempt them from tickets. Visitors/weekenders can buy a season pass.
Almost every village on LI writes parking tickets. Why don't we?
If we are going to improve our infrastructure, we need to raise revenue. Our parking spaces have value to visitors. Let's write some tickets
Thanks to our hard working utility crews for your efforts to get the power issues resolved. Customer Service is always top notch. Thank you!
