It wouldn‚Äôt hurt a candidate‚Äôs chances to fill the post if they  staked out a position on cyber, much as Stewart did in 2017. "I want to be aggressive here ‚Äî it's not enough to monitor attacks or even prevent them ... We have to take a more active role in stopping them."
@politico The department could seek out someone with experience maintaining a large force, such as Cyber Command‚Äôs own 133-team, 6,200-person Cyber Mission Force, which reached what‚Äôs known as full operational capability last May.
@politico With Stewart‚Äôs retirement weeks away, speculation about who might replace him might naturally turn the digital chiefs of the military branches. However, a majority of them have been in their respective posts for less than a year.
@politico Rather Stewart decided to end his nearly 40-year career in the U.S. military after longtime allies, who might have one day promoted him to lead Cyber Command or another post, left DoD or had their stature diminished ‚Äî such as Mattis and Dunford.
@politico Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart‚Äôs decision to leave after serving as Cyber Command's No. 2 since late 2017 is not due to friction with Army Gen. Paul Nakasone.

Filed my Mnuchin story, listening to the tape of the gaggle the secretary gave when it dawned on me who his speaking style reminded me of: Johnny Depp in "Willy Wonka."
Speaker Pelosi has left the Mnuchin briefing. Called it "one of the worst" ever given by the Trump administration. Asked about a resolution of disapproval re: lifting the sanctions said "We'll see."
Things you learn staking out a Cabinet official. House Intel chair Adam Schiff says he still wants Michael Cohen to testify cuz he won't talk Russia with House Oversight. That panel chair, Cummings, confirms there will be "limitations" so as not to muck with Mueller probe.
.@SpeakerPelosi has arrived for the Mnuchin brief.
And we have a winner. Rep. Mike Rogers, AL, new ranking member on House Homeland Security preceeds what is a a CRUSH of members.
So it's roughly 430 and no House members have shown up (likely due to votes). That means the classified briefing hasn't started yet. It also means the Mnuchin has been hanging out in the Capitol Visitor Center Auditorium for about 45 minutes. Wonder what he's thinking in there.

There's no firm timeline to name a successor, as Cardillo is only eyeing the exit because his four-year tenure atop NGA coincides with how long directors have traditionally stayed in the post. It also matches up with President Donald Trump's installation of his own nat sec team.
The Pentagon has informally reached out to Capitol Hill to gauge opinions about potential candidates to succeed NGA Director Robert Cardillo, who came up through the ranks of the U.S. intelligence community and is well-respected.

DoD will also seek to "build a more lethal force" online and "take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend" national interests.
"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict," a summary of the strategy, signed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, states.

Fast forward to the day before my knee surgery.		I'd spoken to McCain at least twice that day but I needed him again for the stories I was squirreling away.		So when he sees me in the hallway, again, he points at my knee and bellows ... (7).
"No trouble, sir."		"They know what it is yet?" he asked.		"Acl and Mcl torn."		"You know what the definition of pain is, my friend," he said without a hint of sarcasm.		We spent another 5 minutes talking one on one. (6)
We talked for five minutes. 		A few weeks later, I caught in McCain scrum that trekked from the Senate subway to the Russell building. A hundred yards or so but with my cane it was rough.		At the end it was just me and the senator.		"I'm sorry I made you walk," he apologized. (5)
"It takes longer to get ready in the morning. Longer to get around here," he said.		His voice was so sympathetic it caught me off guard. No lawmaker had ever said anything like it to me before. I almost choked up.		"Yes, senator. It does."		"What do you need?" he asked. (4)
"WHAT did you DO to yourself?" he asked.		"Fell off a fence, senator," I replied. 		"Fell off a fence?"		"Yes."		"Well that's what you get for sitting on the fence," he joked. 		Then he grew somber. 		"It makes things harder though, doesn't it?" he asked, pointing at my knee (3).
In December '16 I tore my ACL &amp; MCL. Since it happened over Christmas break, I greeted lawmakers in January with a brace on my right knee and a walking cane. 		Now, Senator McCain never knew my name but he knew me by sight. After a late-night Monday vote he saw my new look (2).
I promised myself not to tweet on vacation but the news of Senator John McCain's passing is unavoidable, no matter where one is in the world.		I have a lot of memories covering the senator but there's one, three-part story in particular I'd like to share. It's classic McCain (1).

House passes intelligence policy bill	https://t.co/N01CCuOysW NEW on @POLITICOPro
Intelligence authorization passes. 363-54.
And it's already 270 yea votes and climbing.
Here. We. Go. House members voting now on final passage of the fiscal 2018 and 2019 Intelligence authorization act.
Vote is now 4:45 p.m. All the shouting will be over around 5:30. Probably later.
Anyway, all of this is going to be happening soon, #strzok fans.
@ODNIgov The bill also establishes a new infrastructure security center for threats to the energy sector and asks for reports on intelligence agency leaks, like the Vault 7 leak of CIA tools and the Shadow Brokers leak of NSA hacking tools.
It also mandates @ODNIgov to share publicly an unclassified report on digital threats to federal election campaigns and direct the FBI to provide quarterly briefings to the Intelligence Committee about the ongoing work performed by the Foreign Influence Task Force.
The bipartisan bill would require the I.C. to brief congressional leaders and committees if the U.S. comes under cyberattack from a foreign adversary or an influence campaign directed at a federal election, a nod to the effort Moscow launched against the 2016 presidential race.
ICYMI you've been watching #Strozk all day, the House is about to vote on several amendments and final passage of the fiscal 2018 and 2019 intelligence authorization bill, includes provisions to strengthen election security against threats from Russia and other adversaries.

To recap: the House will vote on a stand-alone Section 702 bill on Thursday (the programs expire Dec. 31). 		The measure will be a Frankestein of the bills approved by House Judiciary, House Intel and Senate Intel.		Start refreshing the House Rules Committee website now, people.
Vote will be Thursday. https://t.co/2vHshC9JRK
And it will be an amalgam of the three committee-approved measures, according to HPSCI chair Devin Nunes. https://t.co/AE7pu2gM1n
@NathanielDWhite Unclear.
Nunes said the bill should post "any minute."
Nunes says the surveillance meaure coming to the floor will combine parts from the House Intell bill, the House Judiciary bill and the Senate Intell bill.
@POLITICOPro @RepPeteKing @RepGoodlatte Not hitching 702 to the CR -- for now -- likely means that House leaders were worried that tacking it on would sink the overall spending measure.		Also, a realization that renewal wouldn't pass unless revisions are proposed, and debated, on the chamber floor.
@POLITICOPro It's unclear if the House will vote on a House Judiciary Committee renewal bill or a leadership-favored Intelligence Committee measure.		@RepPeteKing said a choice has likely been made, but not announced. 		@RepGoodlatte made his pitch during today's House GOP Conference meeting.

SHOT: House Intel to plot surveillance renewal strategy with leadership next week	https://t.co/8Xdu5Zyisc		CHASER: Surveillance critics to Ryan: Don't ignore us	https://t.co/pPWWa9D8sF 	#FISA #Section702 #surveillance
@SpeakerRyan @POLITICOPro The lawmakers predicted a "clean" renewal, w/o any alterations, "will not achieve majority support on the floor of the House." Similarly, they noted the Senate Intelligence Committee reauth bill "is likely dead on arrival" in the chamber.
@SpeakerRyan @POLITICOPro ‚ÄúThe House Judiciary Committee, and not [the Intelligence panel], has primary jurisdiction over this issue," said the letter. "Our committee also best reflects the views of the whole House on this matter."

Both people expressed confidence that the Intelligence Committee would be able to complete work on its own measure before the Dec. 31 deadline and that a short-term, kick-the-can-down-the-road renewal wouldn‚Äôt be necessary.	https://t.co/8Xdu5Zyisc
A delay on the House side would likely embolden Senate leaders to attach their 702 statute renewal bill to other must-pass legislation, such as a continuing resolution or a hike in the debt ceiling, and attempt to jam it through the lower chamber.
