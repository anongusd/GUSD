Steve Bannon v. Ivanka Trump: “You’re a goddamn staffer!” Bannon screamed at her. “I’m not a staffer! I’ll never be a staffer. I’m the first daughter.” - Woodward book https://t.co/yU7mR9Ikyp
Trump falsely suggested McCain had been a coward for taking early release from a prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam because of his father’s military rank and leaving others behind. Mattis corrected him. “No, Mr. President, I think you’ve got it reversed.” https://t.co/yU7mR9qJGR
Following a meeting on the Korean Peninsula, Woodward write: “Mattis was particularly exasperated and alarmed, telling close associates that the president acted like — and had the understanding of — ‘a fifth- or sixth-grader.’ ” https://t.co/yU7mR9qJGR
Kelly on Trump, according to Woodward book: “He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.” https://t.co/yU7mR9qJGR
