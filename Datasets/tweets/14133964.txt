What do Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and North Carolina all have in common?		You guessed it, they all have extreme gerrymandered voting maps that empower partisan politicians to ignore the will of everyday voters and push a special interest-backed radical anti-democratic agenda.
Limiting the power of newly elected Democratic governors is straight out of the playbook of the GOP legislature in North Carolina.		Now Republicans in NC are rushing through a voter ID law before they lose their super majority in the state legislature.
Additionally, Michigan Republicans are pushing a bill to make it A CRIME to require the disclosure of donors to political campaigns.		A CRIME.		Why are they so afraid of democracy and transparency?	https://t.co/mCCZEpxnuB
Efforts to cut early voting in Wisconsin, mess with voter-approved initiatives on redistricting &amp; voting rights in Michigan, and make it harder for citizens to put initiatives on the ballot in Ohio are power grabs by partisan politicians &amp; special interests against #WeThePeople.

@liberalatheists We also don't believe in one silver bullet reform like one constitutional amendment.		We need to deal with (and we are passing reforms on) voting rights, gerrymandering, ethics, and other campaign finance issues like public financing &amp; disclosure.		/2
@liberalatheists We are realistic that the current Congress, and maybe not even the next one, will likely not pass this amendment. But we believe an Article V convention is too dangerous of a process to try to pass this amendment. Everyone's civil rights would be at risk. 		/1

and just in case that wasn't enough, here is another Twitter thread of legal scholars saying an #ArticleV convention is a dangerous and bad idea. #ALECinNOLA 	https://t.co/DaylMwr3pt
‚ÄúThis is like a person who has found rats in their house and decides to solve the problem with dynamite. The whole thing hinges on one salient point: can these delegates be controlled? The answer by many legal scholars is no. There is no control.‚Äù ‚Äì Sen. Estes (R-TX) #ALECinNOLA
‚ÄúIf we go down this rabbit hole, what are we going to find at the end of the tunnel?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I think about the lobbyist money and where we are today as a society, I just don‚Äôt see anything good coming out of it.‚Äù ‚Äì Rep. John Becker (R-OH) #ALECinNOLA
‚ÄúAs I look at the procedural uncertainties and the risks that could happen out of that Convention, on balance, I am unwilling today to support Concurrent Resolution 108.‚Äù - Sen. Bart Davis (R-ID) #ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúThe proposed Article V Convention is not the answer we seek. That option carries an unwarranted risk to our sacred Constitution.‚Äù - Sen. Dan Foreman (R-ID) #ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚Äú...it opens up every bit of the constitution because we as a state cannot restrict it and neither can congress...It is a very dangerous move.‚Äù ‚Äì Rep. Michael Speciale (R-NC)	#ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is everything today is controlled by special interest...The fact of the matter is this is too important of an issue. It will be out of control.‚Äù - Rep. David Brumbraugh (R-OK) #ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúAs we've talked that Article V would open the door for a Constitution to be completely rewritten. Are you willing to gamble that for your children and your grandchildren‚Äôs future? There are many that believe this will be a runaway convention.‚Äù -Rep. Mike Ritze (R-OK) #ALECinNOLA
‚ÄúThis is definitely entering into unchartered territory‚Ä¶We cannot control what comes out of this convention...It would be a mess." ‚Äì Sen. Ron Sharp (R-OK)	#ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
"I do not think there is a constitutional way to bind that convention. It is in the plain text of Article V...When the convention starts, it‚Äôs open season. That could mean a repeal of the 2nd amendment..." ‚Äì Sen. Anthony Sykes (R-OK) 	#ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúI submit to you that voting for this resolution can be a dangerous thing especially in this day and age when we are a deeply divided nation.‚Äù ‚Äì Rep. Blaine "Chip" Campbell (R-SD)	#ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúThis is something very fundamental that may alter the structure of government‚Ä¶ There is no clear understanding how this would proceed and I urge a no vote on that.‚Äù Del. Robert G. Marshall, (R-VA)	#ALECinNOLA #ALECIdeas
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like playing Russian roulette. We kind of think it would work out well. You put a bullet in one chamber, the odds of it working are pretty good. But the consequences of being wrong are immeasurable.‚Äù ‚Äì Sen. Richard Black (R-VA)	#ALECinNOLA

In just the first 3 months of California's AVR-style Motor Voter law, the DMV processed nearly 800,000 voter registration transactions:	393,020 people re-registered to vote	259,294 people registered as new voters	120,016 people updated their addresses 	https://t.co/DDaLT693AK

In the first 6 months of Vermont's AVR program in 2017:	12,344 voter registrations were processed or updated (compared to 7,626 during the same time without AVR in 2016). This is particularly impressive because 2016 was an election year and 2017 was not.	https://t.co/JQYvUquMUF

That means we must also tackle other flaws in our democratic system, like gerrymandering &amp; voting.	 	States have shown us the solutions that work, like California &amp; Arizona's independent redistricting commissions, and automatic voter registration laws in over a dozen states.		/9
Campaign finance reform alone won't fix the many governance problems our democracy faces.		The truth is there is no silver bullet fix our democracy. Instead, our job as citizens, voters, and Americans is to build a democracy we want our children and grandchildren to live in.		/8
We also have to change the way judges view the problem of money in politics. For too long judges have only seen this problem as an issue of corruption, but the truth is it is much more than that. It is about equal representation for all Americans.		/7
We need Congress to pass a constitutional amendment, and send to the states for ratification, that will overturn Citizens United and similar #SCOTUS decisions.		Every generation of Americans has amended the Constitution. Now it is our turn.		/6
We also need to make sure we have:	- reasonable contribution limits	- laws that stop "independent" outside groups from secretly working w/ candidates	- restrictions on foreign $ in US elections	- a functional empowered gov't enforcement agency to hold law breakers accountable		/5
These citizen funded election programs have been proven to make candidates &amp; elected officials spend more time listening to and focusing on everyday voters and diminish the power of wealthy special interests. These laws can fundamentally changes who has power in our politics.		/4
We need to move to a campaign finance system that empowers small donors. States like Connecticut &amp; Maine (and many cities and counties across the US) have successful campaign public financing programs that match small dollar contributions with public funds. 		/3
We need to improve our disclosure laws to ensure everyone knows who is spending money to influence our elected officials. There should be no such thing as a "secret money" or "dark money" group. We have a right to see all money being raised &amp; spent in elections.		/2
Mick Mulvaney's comments show the corruption and problem of pay-to-play politics, but voters already understand this problem. Americans feel it every day when we know our needs are not being prioritized like lobbyists' wants. 		Voters need proven solutions, so here are a few:		/1

Connecticut‚Äôs chance to save #NetNeutrality is now, explains @ygetachew2 &amp; @CQCommonCT 	https://t.co/vCCwUVasaC

There are real solutions to help fix this corruption &amp; the influence of big money in politics. It starts with passing legislation that empowers small dollar donors and reduce the influence of big donors. We've seen these laws work in many states &amp; cities across the country.
In a real and strong democracy, government is of, by, and for the people. But when politicians are only listening to donors &amp; lobbyists, the needs of ordinary Americans are not prioritized. This corruption drowns out the voices &amp; votes of everyday voters.	https://t.co/qMJlvSbJIH
