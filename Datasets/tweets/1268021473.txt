@wisgop @GovEvers Didn't you folks just promise 4 billion to FoxConn without even vetting them? Ignored potholes to throw money their way? Why don't you want to invest in Wisconsin's people instead of giveaways to foreign companies?
@wisgop @WIGOPSenate @WIAssemblyGOP @GovEvers Your bill was unpaid for, which is par for course. Evers wants to give bigger breaks to more Wisconsinites while clawing back the massive giveaways to equity under Walker. Why don't you want middle class Wisconsinites to get a tax break? Lobbyists got your tongue?
@wisgop @GovEvers Nothing like a gerrymandered rump party captured by equity, grabbing all the power they can, pretending their will is the will of the people. Wisconsin voted for Evers. Get used to it.
@wisgop @GovEvers Wisconsin lagged behind our neighbors as America recovered from the financial crisis under Bush. Republican policies have held our state back, kicking out teachers and scientists that will never come back. The roads are falling apart, and now you don't want to pay the bill?

@writerknowles @YahooNews True of party leadership at least, which of course you're right deserve scrutiny. Perhaps my lens has a bit of a blue tint, but I think it makes sense to include what voters think about it.
@GinaSim90068785 @DanODonnellShow I don't like it. Call me old fashioned but I think it is necessary to our democracy for our politics to be measured, reasoned, and ideally kind.

@writerknowles @YahooNews I like the whole article: embedded tweets, balance, pacing. So precise in the last two paragraphs. I think the hl framing is lazy because a majority of both parties support an election holiday, and it seem (to me at least) transparently true that voting isn't... nefarious.

This is incredible reporting and graphically striking presentation of information. You have to read it. You have to see it. https://t.co/Mdb6rgQy4v
@ziyatong my credentials: https://t.co/wxZenHjCG1
@chunga1958 @ziyatong Do what I can.
@amynowacoski I'm wary of anyone who says they know how this will turn out, pun intended. Still what I've read is exciting! Maybe the young people will win?
@bot_censored Checked your feed, reading, reading, reading aaaaaaand you're blocked.
@bot_censored joke.	^	 |	your head.
@ddale8 Sundown came early tonight.
@JuneJosephScott @Thomas_Howitt @KevinThoma24 @redblackties @D4rk34gl3 @JacquelynGill @ziyatong But seriously, drones should be used responsibly and this pilot was way too aggressive.
@JuneJosephScott @Thomas_Howitt @KevinThoma24 @redblackties @D4rk34gl3 @JacquelynGill @ziyatong Tell that to the FAA.
@alifeofinsanity Well I was never going to run for office anyways so joke's on you. 😉
@ozyusmc1964 @NRCC @amandacarpenter You're referring to Trump's lawyer who claimed in court that Trump participated in multiple felony crimes?
@ziyatong I'm here all week: https://t.co/Lslc15ssky
Early polling shows big D energy.
@wsbtv To be clear I'm referring to credulous reporting of specious claims made by candidates.
@wsbtv Wow people learned nothing from 2016.
@JessicaHuseman @GeorgiaDemocrat @BrianKempGA They're probably a bit shy of making statements until more information on the claim emerges. Legal probably has it now. As planned I'd guess, as it works in Kemp's favor.
@mk138455 @Rock_City_Kitty @GeorgiaDemocrat @BrianKempGA Who keeps taking the hinges that's what I wanna know.
@rabiasquared Such hippocrates.
@D4rk34gl3 @JacquelynGill @ziyatong I fly drones. It's a drone. At 1:19 the drone approaches rapidly. You can tell from the pan downward at the end of that clip that the drone is close, I'd guess 15ft maybe less.
@Thomas_Howitt @KevinThoma24 @redblackties @D4rk34gl3 @JacquelynGill @ziyatong That gives you a relative position of the drone. Maybe 15 feet or less I would guess.
@ehnottooxabi @NRCC @amandacarpenter wow.... wow.
@JacquelynGill @kejames @Revkin @GeoJeannie Jeez good point.
@Thomas_Howitt @KevinThoma24 @redblackties @D4rk34gl3 @JacquelynGill @ziyatong You can tell from the tilt at 1:19
@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave We could talk about the Sophie's Choice Trump has created for people fleeing poverty and violence with their kids in tow. I'm sure you've seen the kids in cages.

@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave I wont even mention that he tried to deputize the military and abolish the 14th amendment via executive order.
@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave That's not talk.
@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave Do you blame him for ordering the National Guard to shoot asylum seekers and migrants who throw stones?
@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave A common refrain, and apparently an effective excuse for some.
@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave Leader of the free world (lol) says it's ok. He has ordered the same of the National Guard. That's fine with you?

@NBCNews She lies often and loudly, so... the perfect spokesperson for Trump's Republican party.
@BigEars @ziyatong I don't know much about bears, but she keeps looking at the drone nervously. That rapid approach would rattle me, to the bear it might seem like the thing was about to attack.
@BigEars @ziyatong Could well be.
@ziyatong And here's my gofundme for a drone/cam with a zoom function		jkjk
@ziyatong I mean... far be it from me that I should not chase a flock of birds or some loons on a lake from time to time, but leave that little bear child alone.
@erikaheidewald a v healthy mood https://t.co/3aVhM02DaX
@ErikBusellato @ziyatong Looks like that camera has some serious zoom too. The rapid approach could be an honest mistake; maybe the pilot though they were further away and zoomed in. I would fly and shoot this too if I saw it and count myself blessed, but in hindsight it raises some concerns.
@rcesite @TearsoftheEagle @Independent Anyone who doesn't know by now that Trump uses racism to appeal to his people gets an instant block from me. I'm just too tired of it to engage.

@TSJessikaJayne @robbysoave I blame Trump and his surrogates for their constant refrain about "globalists", George Soros, or whatever stand in you like, conspiring to flood the US with people who aren't white.

@abelmonte17 @applecharlie5 @CNN What? It's an informed opinion that he's more like Wallace. Trump appeals to bigots daily now, using fabrications. He said a few days ago that he's a Nationalist. Those two are facts.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins No one is working for free. Maximizing public health will require reforms and innovation in education, licensure, community care, food systems, etc. Healthcare touches everything. My aunt is a RNA working on senior care in home in WI. I get that practices are a major factor.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins Insurance underwriting still substantially controls the coding and cost of the care you receive, whether you're insured or not.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins Quite a feat. Most can't do what you're doing.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins I think you're right that Single Payer wouldn't work without major reforms to underlying systems. Where I think we disagree is that I think a single payer system would go a long ways towards shifting the balance towards us. It would be a tool for underlying reforms.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins Yeah, *me*. I can't understand what you've been through but I think systemically too. My nephew is going to hit the old lifetime limits before he's nine months. I personally struggle to get the care I need. Monospony is a counterweight to Hospital systems' power.
@siobhanphoenix @HowieHawkins No more insurance companies, power to determine reimbursement, care no longer rationed by wealth, medical related bankruptcies a thing of the past. Anyone with a pre-existing conditions (hey there me too) should celebrate the idea. Profit motive in public health is poison.
@applecharlie5 @abelmonte17 @CNN Aw, us people. Tump was making things up all day. Sanctuary city riots? Middle-easterners in migrant caravan and he admits he made it up? New tax cuts when Congress is out? Soros funding migrants? He's a bigot.
@CampbellSoupCo Hey there, I won't be purchasing a thing from you until you fire the Antisemite. You know who I'm talking about.
@sabrtoothtigger And you accepted my premise the Republicanism today, and Trump's support specifically, is based on racial animus and nationalistic appeals, like Wallace.
@sabrtoothtigger That's gibberish.
@atrupar @tcwittes They're not wrong.
@sabrtoothtigger Like... literally today.
@sabrtoothtigger Which party is relying today on racial animus and nationalism to engage voters? Answer is obvious.
@applecharlie5 @abelmonte17 @CNN Yes that happened today.		Wallace's appeals were based on racial animus and nationalism. Trump in a nut shell.
@applecharlie5 @abelmonte17 @CNN Just yesterday a bomb was found in the mailbox of a prominent Jewish man after Trump surrogates said he is funding migrants in South America to come North. #Antisematism plain and clear. Corrupt bigots run the GOP now and Trump is the lead toad.
@applecharlie5 @abelmonte17 @CNN Did you hear him today making up whole cloth incredible violence inciting lies about migrants. It's a racist appeal to white men. Wallace would be proud.
@joethepatriotic @CNN @TheDemocrats Just yesterday a bomb was found in the mailbox of a Jewish man after Trump surrogates intimated that he was funding migrants in South America to come North. #Antisematism plain and clear. Corrupt bigots run the GOP now.
@joethepatriotic @CNN @TheDemocrats Sure, and Republicans are the party of Lincoln. Get with this century bro. Even today the President is making up whole cloth incredible violence inciting lies about migrants. It's a racist appeal to white men. Wallace would be proud.
