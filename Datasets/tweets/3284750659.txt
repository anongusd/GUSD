Be loyal and faithful and God will forgive your sin. Obey the Lord and nothing evil will happen to you .
A gentle answers  quiets angers but a harsh one stirs it up.
Don't hesitate to rescue someone who is about to be executed unjustly . You may say that is none of your business but God knows and judges of your motives. He keeps watch on you ; he knows. And he will reward you according to what you do.
The weight of stone and sand is nothing compared to the trouble that stupidity  can cause.

Arrogance should be punished,  so that people who don't know any better can learn a lesson. If you are wise,  you will learn when you are corrected .
Ask the Lord to bless your plans and you will be successful in carrying them out .
A very warm sunny day. https://t.co/LnwkNvGNEr
Sunny day... https://t.co/swfqrNLqxD
In our holy scriptures  there are 66 books of the bible given to us by the Holy Spirit constitute the plenary Word of God. Old testament has 39 books , New testament has 27 books . Writers are 44.
@TheRealCDK1 All things are possible with God. Keep on praying to God. He is the best healer .
Arrogance will bring your downfall,  but if you are humble,  you will be respected.
Prejudice is wrong. But some judges will do wrong to get even the smallest bribe.
When a nation sins, it will have one ruler after another. But a nation will be strong and endure when it has intelligent, sensible leaders.
It is your own face you see reflected in the water and it is your own self that you see in your heart.
@RiderPride1234 Thanks , Rick. How's your relationship to God today?
@RiderPride1234 Right time to pray for him and God is with you. Jesus knocks in his heart to be saved.
RT @teewine: Marriage is NOT about Wearing Matching Outfits. 	Do You Have Matching Hearts, Matching Brains and Matching Understanding Match‚Ä¶
Thoughtless words can wound as deeply as any sword , but wisrkt spoken words can heal.
If you are good , you are guided by honesty.  People who can't be trusted are destroyed by their own dishonesty.
Those who are good are rewarded here on earth, so you can be sure that wicked and sinful people will be punished.
Someone who holds back the truth causes trouble, but one who openly criticizes works for peace.
@sovereigntyGod God is merciful. Hold on to Him, pray earnestly and all your prayers will be answered in His time.
Those who depend on their wealth  will fall like the leaves of autumn , but the righteous will prosper like the leaves of summer.
You will never succeed  in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up ; then God show mercy to you.
Some friendships do not last but some friends are more loyal than brothers.
You may think that everything you do is right. But remember that the Lord judges your motives.
Long life is the reward of the righteous; Gray hair is a glorious crown.
Be kind and honest and you will live a long life, others will respect  you and treat you fairly.
You will have to live with the consequences of everything you say. What you say can preserve life or destroy it ; so you must accept the consequences of your words.

Many have failed for relationship in marriage, business etc. Regarding with this, think twice before accepting it. Compatibility is the most important. Rest assured that the relationship is intact because if it's ups and downs due to individual perception both aren't benefitted. https://t.co/PNYFQQhLAW
Knowingly, success is the achievement of what I desired, what our families worked for to gain that desire. Our family belongs to low income level. With the help of our Almighty God, thru the sacrifice of my parents, all of us are college degree graduate. https://t.co/0p8NIY0ent

@BruceVH Yes, that's I believe.

@pablioneruda 	Yes, I  agree with your message.
It's not the thing that gives meaning to your lice but it's the person who gives us beautifui meaning to our  LIFE.....
You can't go crooked as long as you stay on the straight and narrow way.
Deception is a common sin that grieves the Lord above;	He longs for those who will worship Him	In faith and truth and love
Two heads may be better than one, but a double-minded person is no good at all.
Real help combines correction with compassion.
Focus on what you have, not on what you don't have.
It's better to swallow your pride than to eat your words.
The hurting ones need sympathy. They need to know we're there; a quiet word, a tender touch assures them that we care
http://t.co/qylmEOxOgw
Contentment is wanting what you have , not  having everything you want.
ANGER  is just one letter short of Danger.
Gratitude should be a continuous attitude, not an occasional incident.
Trust in God's word is a sure defense against temptation.
@CareCureSurgico thanks, too
Need to repair a relationship? Try kindness.
A child may not inherit his parents'  talent, but he will absorb their values.
One measure of your love for God is your desire to share his word with others.
True friends will say what's kind and true, though it may cause us pain. They're thinking of what's good for us and all we stand to gain
Forgiveness is the glue that repairs broken relationships.
The better our memory, the better our praise.
We won't have time to find fault with others if we are busy seeking wisdom.
Life's big turning points often hinge on little things.
