@Hahaharmon @ArmouredSkeptic pretty sure anyone is welcome to respond to a public tweet!
@dan_paniagua @ArmouredSkeptic you’re welcome to interpret replying to a tweet however you’d like
@VidCon @steve_shives congrats Steve!
@MrRMitchell hey Ryan! can you show me where i’ve said making videos about me is “discrimination” if you have a link or screen shot i’d love to see it. thanks
@ArmouredSkeptic luckily there are enough #VidConGrants to go around (52 totaling 100k) so Steve being awarded isn’t hurting anyone else’s chances. more details on eligibility &amp; application here: https://t.co/9vfmz2LRMm 	Good luck! ☺️
@ArmouredSkeptic according to the #VidConGrants application, eligibility has nothing to do with how one chooses to run their Twitter. my guess is Steve was awarded because he applied &amp; met the qualifications.
@AkilahObviously when having a YouTube channel is your only accomplishment,  “dead channel” is a real burn
@meghantonjes oh. she’s doing choreography?!?! https://t.co/bL7N6URDe1
@jenncloud @ckelso i have a list on my iphone notepad that i add to from time to time &amp; sometimes i just go on pinterest &amp; find quotes that speak to me. sometimes the quotes are from friends or i just work on certain words
i had a blast voicing Cloudia on this week’s episode of @storypirates! thanks to my hilarious and talented friend @RachelWenitsky &amp; the whole story pirates team for having me! ❤️❤️ https://t.co/U318hi4Uzp
@kanishaea oooh that sounds lovely!
@jenncloud @ckelso one of the things that helped me was slowing down my lettering. picking up the pen between each letter and really being deliberate about your strokes makes a huge difference in the final result &amp; *flow*
@Samdromeda ooh that’s a good one
@RayahJaymes @kidnoble it’s mind-blowing!
brush lettering has been my go to stress reliever over the past year &amp; i really love it. sometimes i’ll spend an hour just writing the same phrase over &amp; over trying different lettering &amp; colors until i find the one that i want to hang up or include in my journal. it’s great
i was in LA all of feb for work &amp; my roomie &amp; i covered our front door in affirmations which is...peak LA but was also really sweet. https://t.co/IIw08rGS65

@LaTonyaRoberts you’re so welcome!
@BlairImani @naacpimageaward @MichelleObama @NelsonMandela thanks queen! 😘
@deepssquared thanks so much!
@ReignOfApril sorry i’m late on this! thank you!
@CaitlinVanasse but there’s a new learning team which is how this show came to be. so obviously they want to do more to raise the profile of booktube, hopefully there’s a way to do that &amp; include folks from other places &amp; with varying audience sizes. numbers aren’t everything
@CaitlinVanasse for sure. when i lived in Miami i got connected w YouTube because i won a contest in 2008. many of the employees i met back then still work there today so meeting them was a huge help. but it’s a lot harder if you don’t live near a NextLab or Google office.
@LCMarie19 it’s all good. Jouelzy and i get it &amp; we’re happy to do our part to help. thanks for the kind words, will keep you posted ❤️
oh hay. this happened during my social media hiatus! 😬 AND as if being nominated alongside @MichelleObama wasn’t enough, today i got to hold her hand &amp; tell her how excited i am to lose this award to her 😂😍 https://t.co/g4FtUYaJ1T
@LCMarie19 that said, i don’t expect everyone to know who i am or to gonna look me up. unfortunately it seems this has been a long standing issue w the booktube community so i understand why ppl were disappointed. there’s always room for improvement so i’m happy to help if i can
@CaitlinVanasse hmmm if you don’t live near a YouTube office that certainly makes it harder to get on their radar. i don’t know that i have specific advice for that BUT i’m gonna add it to my list of things to investigate. sorry i don’t have a better answer just yet!
@CaitlinVanasse totally. i think the name of the series confused people a bit since the booktube community is very specific &amp; clearly this has been an ongoing issue there. i understand people’s feelings about it tho.
@LCMarie19 it’s ok. i think the name of the show led people to believe it would only feature booktubers which i understand but just isn’t the case. it’s a new venture &amp; they’re still figuring it out. everyone featured has a relationship w YT &amp; books in so that’s why we were selected
@squibblesreads @xreadingsolacex @roxy4589 true. i see both sides mainly bc i’ve been on YT a long time (since 2006) &amp; a lot of progress has been made w programs like YT Black BUT there’s always room for improvement which is why threads like these are important. it’s important for those of us w access to use it &amp; uplift!
@xreadingsolacex @roxy4589 @squibblesreads it’s all good! i saw your thread celebrating black booktubers &amp; i’ve shared it with my contacts at YouTube. hopefully this will just be the first of many episodes to come &amp; there’ll be an opportunity to feature more creators w varying audiences!
i’m late on this BUT i want ppl know they’ve been heard. as an author &amp; creator, being included was super exciting but i understand why many were disappointed black creators who exclusively cover books weren’t included. happy to RT this list &amp; share w my YT contact ❤️ https://t.co/FPlKcde5x7
@xreadingsolacex @roxy4589 @squibblesreads jouelzy and i have both written books &amp; we’ve created content about many of the themes in Becoming. that said, i hope more black booktubers get opportunities to be included in future episodes if this becomes a full series (this was just a pilot ep)
@anotherhalima @LaTonyaRoberts hope this helps! lastly, i hope you’re not discouraged bc of who was selected. i have no doubt there’ll be plenty of other cool opportunities for your channel to be featured. keep making great videos! ❤️
@anotherhalima @LaTonyaRoberts that said, if you or someone you know wants to be involved in future YouTube projects/shows the best advice i can offer is to get involved with your local YT office. either by attending workshops/events or applying for programs so the staff get to know you
@anotherhalima @LaTonyaRoberts that said, i think the name of the show has lead people to believe that the participants *should* exclusively identify as booktubers which, to my knowledge isn’t the goal. if it becomes a full series there will be plenty of opportunities for other creators to be involved!
@anotherhalima @LaTonyaRoberts late on this convo but, this is just the pilot of what will hopefully become an entire series. while the show is called “booktube” it featured some creators who’ve written books (myself, john green) &amp; some creators who EXCLUSIVELY make book content &amp; occasionally review books
@impboy @MichelleObama @YouTube i was at an Oscar party and we were all SCREEEEEAMING 😂😂

@SunnyTheMuse @AdrianXpression 1st &amp; only insta vid i saw of hers was about cosby’s victims having “amnesia” she went on &amp; on about if she was raped she’d do this and that cause you know....gotta be a “perfect” victim to deserve sympathy 😑 i made the mistake of leaving a comment &amp; her stupid fans showed out
@AdrianXpression yikessssssss. as if the victim blamey cosby jokes weren’t bad enough.

@battymamzelle @kitttenqueen @WannasWorld one’s mom films some of her youtube videos for her 🙃
@beytrece @kitttenqueen @WannasWorld i just found her on insta. the whole thing is weird.
@beytrece @kitttenqueen @WannasWorld are they insta famous? where’d they come from?
@the_mod_woman @AnnaleishaMae @Loquacious_Pint “i wanted to kill a random black person but now i know that’s bad” is like...not growth? i think we should all understand wanting to kill a random person is a bad thing...realizing that isn’t worth applauding

@Reading8Rainbow SPEAK ON IT!
@AragonOfAcab @Blubfeesh i think the comments together are worth highlighting. he thinks reporting sexual assault is a witch hunt but admits to stalking the streets looking for a black person to kill when his family member was assaulted?
@Keah_Maria they on here all damn day!!! i’m actually toying with a serious break. it’s toxic as hell around here &amp; it’s not serving me at all
@Keah_Maria it never stops
@judithtunes @khaleesi_britt it’s all good. thanks for being open to listening
@GRE8TBLACKSHARK you’re allowed to feel however you want about it
@lovanwink @judithtunes @khaleesi_britt right?!?!? that’s the first thing you wanna know?? it’s like he was glad he got the answer she gave
@judithtunes @khaleesi_britt i meeeean my tweet was “oh ok” i’m not gonna give him cookies for “i wanted to murder a random black person to avenge my friend but that was bad” i also think it’s ironic to call #metoo a “witch hunt” &amp; admit to roaming the streets looking to kill a random black person
@khaleesi_britt @judithtunes someone should hire you for PR. this statement is perfect
i actually read beyond headlines, but the full *context* doesn’t make either of these takes any less trash. thanks.
@judithtunes @khaleesi_britt yeeeea that doesn’t make it better
@Ashtonakaleegle @doorsixteen i dunno that anyone deserves brownie points for “i wanted to kill a random black person but i didn’t” he could’ve kept that. there’s a big difference between that and “i’ve had to confront my own bias and anger issues in the past &amp; its something i continue to work on”
oh ok Liam https://t.co/S6T6oA0VF0
@doorsixteen he really told this story like he was gonna get a cookie for his "growth" YIKES
thankfully i don’t use twitter the same way i did 10 or even 2 yrs ago. you can’t comment on everything. every story doesn’t need to be turned into a joke. some stuff should stay offline. a DM or a call or text can solve an issue where a thread can make it worse.

@ArielRoseV agreed!
@ArielRoseV well i think a recording of the stage version is very different from a version staged for tv. there’s a talent level that’s needed for stage that isn’t the same for tv. lots of understated acting choices for tv that wouldn’t work on a stage

so my agent just sent me a very snarky text about #RENTLive. i’m admittedly not a RENT head (i know 3 songs) so i don’t have any real investment. but it’s fine? i’m watching at a bar and the atmosphere (and alcohol) is making the experience for me. i dunno, are people hating it?

@saharvey75 i think the card was from a “moon deck”? i took a new year’s eve yoga class in costa rica and they had us each pull a card beforehand so i took a picture of the explanation afterward

@sean637 or more musicals that didn't get wide releases would get a chance to be recognized? also, lots of animated musicals!
@thatssomika yeah comedies are traditionally 30 mins...i'd say OITNB is more drama but...i dunno. it feels unfair to pit musicals and comedies against each other? they're so different
@mskathykhang naw, it's bad production
@dudesludge Star is Born isn't a musical tho. It's a movie about musicians. A musical is distinguished by folks singing when they normally wouldn't aka instead of dialogue.
why are the crowd mics SO LOUD? #GoldenGlobes

@inch2high @CandiceBenbow yup. that’s exactly the issue. the correlation isn’t correct/fair but it’s why many don’t come forward

@jourdayen @1followernodad not to mention he CHOSE to step down. this whole spin is bizarre.
@elle_chiefelk yuppppp. it’s terrifying. there’s a whole cottage industry of dudes raging on YT about how i and other feminists are “man hating bitches” and yet they love to throw in comments about my sex life &amp; “hate fucking” me...meanwhile YT does nothing cause that’s not harassment 🙃
@elle_chiefelk but a lot of dudes do this. their hatred of women (and in this case one specifically) is rooted in sexual frustration &amp; insecurity. the idea of a woman being attractive, successful, independent &amp; not interested in them is a total mind fuck.

@Tiki1125 @inch2high @CandiceBenbow do not put words in my mouth. this isn’t an oppression contest. tweets &amp; abuse are not being given equal weight. READ what’s been said. if you’re unable to understand why defending abuse &amp; defending abusive “jokes” keep survivors from coming forward that’s your personal problem.

@J_Shantel_Ro @MTV hey Jameria, i never said anyone shouldn’t be proud of their history. the episode explains the history of the term “white pride” &amp; how it’s historically been associated with violence &amp; oppression. there’s a transcript included if anything is unclear https://t.co/EnXZJLmKvz https://t.co/4cTLel8Hq8

@KizerMoore totally. this article is literally about that lol i’m just saying it’s non sensical
@littlelistmaker there’s a bunch of those apps now. musicly is another one. i truly don’t get it. my discover on insta is FILLED with them. i need to find out who i’m following that likes that crap 😂
@seabethree HAAAA! good luck!
@littlelistmaker i feel so OLD! what is tiktok?!?!? 😭😂 and they’re not wrong. the market is SOOOO saturated. i think it’s better to be choosy &amp; not dilute your brand but...das me
@bea_roland i think they’re hoping it attracts followers and other sponsors. i don’t see it working tho
@KizerMoore hence “in my experience” but i also work in the industry. but again, it’s different on the outside looking in. audiences get tired of constant advertising. but they don’t know that bc they don’t have a real following or sponsor obligations
@RaisingSelf i wish there was an easy answer. talk to them about building their own self worth instead of looking to celebs &amp; brands to tell them what’s cool
@seabethree oh yea i understand that’s why they’re doing it. it’s just funny bc the people i know who make their living off sponsored content are worn out by it. it can be A LOT
@PKBard it’s too perfect
@kingsleyyy meanwhile the rest of us are like “uuugh i’m not gonna take this deal cause it’s not fair to my audience”
depending on the brand or if you’re working w an agency, most sponsored projects include planning calls, a proposal (here’s what i wanna do, here’s my budget), sometimes a brand messaging session (don’t say XYZ), deadlines for post approvals &amp; post schedule
there’s nothing wrong w sponsored content. (make sure you disclose!) but it’s often months of negotiating to make sure the terms are reasonable &amp; it fights your own voice. that’s the irony of folks faking sponsorships. in reality they’re a lot of work not just hashtags
@RaisingSelf it’s interesting. younger generations don’t really seem to believe “selling out” is a bad thing. it’s a mark of status now. social media and branded content has truly changed the game
@upthetwerx oh yea that’s been a thing for awhile. but people do that just to go to events
@upthetwerx it makes no sense. not surprising some of them are in high school but the idea of faking a vacation for the gram is just...🙃
in my experience, you want to avoid posting too much sponsored content to avoid taking advantage of your audience or annoying them. most people don’t want to be sold to 24/7 even if you’re faking it. faking sponsored posts is truly hustling backwards
this is so bizarre to me 😂 https://t.co/6E5rVPjWvT

@JaimeRockets @Luvvie well. context matters. i’m talking about myself. i’m not dissing anyone. clearly we’re both happy with how we look. there’s nothing wrong with hyperbole

@seabethree that “teaser” was a joke. i’m so mad.
@mrsgresham32 thanks so much! such a great event!
@notcorry @Rhammified except he’s never actually taken responsibility for what he’s said. not even just tweets. in his stand up. in his films. “it’s the past” is not an apology “i’ve grown” isn’t an apology. it’s a cop out.
finally. respect that not every apology will be accepted. the person harmed by your behavior may NEVER forgive you. the work you do to reflect &amp; change should be because you know it’s necessary for personal growth. that growth shouldn’t be contingent on forgiveness.
sure, people make mistakes. but you have to ACKNOWLEDGE the mistake in order to seek forgiveness &amp; move on. “it’s in the past!” and “everyone makes mistakes” are not acknowledgments of your behavior....that’s passing the buck
so. many. bad. apologies. focus on what you did, not what you meant to do. taking responsibility means avoiding excuses. you can’t apologize for someone’s feelings. but you can apologize for how YOUR ACTIONS made someone feel. remember, the best apology is changed behavior.

@CoreyRachel ha! to be fair i did just cut all my hair off 🙃
@jj_the_jetson @bomani_jones this logic makes no sense. if someone steals your identity &amp; runs up a credit card in your name, you’d be pissed &amp; try to fix it. not because you’re “important” but bc you should have ownership of your identity and no one else should
@jj_the_jetson @bomani_jones handle your public profile how you see fit. i care when ppl impersonate me &amp; then harass my employers, friends, family and people who enjoy my work. i don’t want any doubt that those people aren’t me. again, if you have dealt with it personally i’m not surprised you don’t get it
@bomani_jones it’s weird this needs to be said
@jj_the_jetson @bomani_jones meh. “importance” is relative. someone having visibility doesn’t make them important. if someone is impersonating you online i’d argue that says more about them than it does about you. verification just means “yes this is me”

@AlishaMDixon honestly, i don’t see short hair  impeding any of that. but depends on how short &amp; what style. i still workout 4 days a week &amp; washing my hair now takes 5 mins as opposed to sitting under the dryer for 2 hours. so far short hair is waaaay more low maintence for me
@JayeRyane yaaaas! bring on the beauty campaign!!
@jacpebbles oh wow! i never thought of that! before i cut my hair i had a bunch of dreams where i cut them
@AlishaMDixon lose your lifestyle in what sense?
@momwithmoxie i wish you would stop putting worts in my mouth. i didn’t call you problematic.
in 2018 there’s no reason for you not to understand what “freedom of speech” actually means
@momwithmoxie no one said it HAD to be removed. i made the choice to remove it because i don’t agree with her politics. i’m not sure how i choose to manage my social media is bothersome to you. but you’re welcome to share the quote if you’re inclined
@momwithmoxie huh? who’s 1st amendment rights have been infringed by my tweet?
@iAmJeffSledge i agree completely. sad to think watering down is a strategy for mainstream success but i get it.
@sianmorson thanks friend! hope you’re well!
@DasiaVuX ah good call! technically he sang back up while drumming but he still rocks it
@RealJeffHoliday heck yea. sounds cheesy but it feels like the world has opened up. i support lumpy heads!
@iAmJeffSledge it took a few listens to grow on me. i think he’s trying to go mainstream which i get but it was kinda jarring at first. the features. the skits. the lyrics. i was likeeee son what are you doing? lol but there are a few real hits. it’s still better than most just not his best
@iAmJeffSledge TOUCHÉ

@EmbraceTheJ ha! so flattering! this is my week 2 makeover except i didn’t cry lol
@TheOGLaurenM i cut about 6 inches off over the summer. i couldn’t deal with them being that long. the cut helped a lot but they were still annoying.
@ValerieComplex i actually kept them! there’s no need to go through the whole journey again, i can just do a sew in &amp; then switch it up.
@adastralplains honestly? it’s not as bad as i expected it to be. but i get it. a lot of people started locs because of me which is very flattering. i dunno. it’s interesting to say the least!

@meaganometry i put it together! i purchased all the items separately and then i customized the feather cape. i added a bunch of feathers and glued two capes together.
i cut my hair last week! i had locs for 15 years, almost half my life! i was itching for a change, especially since 2018 has been kinda tough for me. cutting my hair felt like the start of a new chapter, a new franchesca. honestly, i haven't felt this good in a long time. https://t.co/40WpPsiefB

@Cpt_Cass @Reinfoxy an honest mistake is STILL VOTER SUPPRESSION. if the outcome is people are unable to vote then votes are being suppressed this is so fucking basic
i’ll say this til blue in the face “intent doesn’t absolve impact” even if you ignore historical context or just choose to throw out common sense, votes are being suppressed. people (MOSTLY BLACK &amp; BROWN) are being denied the right to participate in the process &amp; THAT’S NOT OK https://t.co/J237MdgxLm
@mimia_aaron @awkward_duck but setting up barriers to vote fails all of us. anyone who’s unable to vote has been denied their right to be part of the process. you shouldn’t have to wait all day or skip work to vote

@WriteRobWrite hm. here’s a thought. you don’t have to brainstorm w another writer. if you have a friend that just loves movies they might be of help. just to talk it through &amp; hear a new perspective. like, would you watch this? does this make sense? who does this remind you of? vs structure
@WriteRobWrite have you tried this? i haven’t but heard good things https://t.co/Hb4C6KOGSI

@WriteRobWrite what are you working on? have you considered taking a class in your area? it’s a great way to learn &amp; meet people with similar interests
the lesson here is everyone has to start at the beginning &amp; that’s terrifying. it feels scary &amp; embarrassing to ask for advice/help but all creative folks deal with this. esp if you work alone. there was something so freeing about brainstorming w someone removed from the project!
unrelated to voting. so. i’ve been working on this script for 2 months &amp; some days i just cry bc it’s hard &amp; i feel clueless. my therapist was like “why don’t you just ask for help?” UM. WHAT? so i did! i did calls/coffees w some of my most creative friends &amp; OMG it really helped

@annieelainey hay! did you see you got a shout out in the recent #MTVDecoded?? https://t.co/vRybsd7Wlz
@hart_chelle sadly, 27k isn't much when it comes to long term cancer treatment. but those people can still donate if they want. but if their donations are publicly tied to bigotry they're gonna be turned away. that's their decision to make.
@Brandon_Bahret @RealJeffHoliday for sure! and same!
@claudius_jr this https://t.co/uvC2JFlTiR
@CrowdDemon interesting! will check it out
@gaybonez @DivaDelux GABE!! the episode came out so great!!! thank you!!
@Brandon_Bahret @RealJeffHoliday it’s disingenuous but billed as “civil discourse”
@ValerieComplex @IWriteAllDay_ @wagatwe @Maria_Giesela @AditiJuneja3 @MatthewACherry @youngsinick honestly, publicists don’t manage social media. i highly doubt they have anything to do w these responses. their job is to get press for her work. they don’t typically do media training
@Brandon_Bahret @RealJeffHoliday it’s also a major power play. come on MY show, where i have the upper hand &amp; am totally comfortable, where my audience is predisposed to not like you, i can profit off this interaction, you will do the emotional labor for free &amp; if you refuse that means you’re a coward
@youngsinick @wagatwe @IWriteAllDay_ @Maria_Giesela @AditiJuneja3 @MatthewACherry there were some movies named i hadn’t seen myself so it wouldn’t be unreasonable to just admit she didn’t know!
@Kim_Provise @IWriteAllDay_ @wagatwe @Maria_Giesela @AditiJuneja3 @MatthewACherry @youngsinick in my experience they just don’t know anything about social media. they know how to get press not how to handle screw ups or give meaningful apologies

@sararl213 @RebelWilson it’s her prerogative. i just think it’s interesting who got blocked and who didn’t for saying the same thing...
@Duke_Clemens @kwinston1101 thanks! but keep in mind people still use that narrative with me no matter what. there are literally thousands of videos saying i hate all white ppl etc and i’ve never said anything of the sort. people hear what they want to
@RebelWilson it’s a bummer i got blocked for one incredibly mild tweet. instead of doubling down you could’ve just admitted you misspoke. imma still see your lil movie tho since my friend is in it. but damn.
@Duke_Clemens @kwinston1101 oh you’re absolutely right. i replied to a handful &amp; let it go. i will say it’s surprising/positive to see folks speaking out on this.
@Brandon_Bahret @Jennife30891817 @RealJeffHoliday seems many of the people up in arms didn’t actually read the report to understand what it said
@dopegirlfresh yes. this is a lewk
more like they ignored the threat. this article is important. https://t.co/e1bJaYXPCs
@CrowdDemon i’ve always been interested in how people communicate online &amp; what gets lost in translation. my gripe w whole situation (which we can put behind us) has been “why didn’t you talk to me??” it frustrates me to no end. social media has connected us but made it impossible to talk
@CrowdDemon they infuriate me too lol ppl are making full blown salaries off accusing me of shit i never said. speculating about my sex life. calling me awful slurs. my talk w you in 2013 was in hopes of understanding why it was so bad &amp; it just got worse. i could sense it but had no clue
@CrowdDemon i appreciate that. look. i wanted to talk to you from the jump bc despite our many differences of opinion you have common sense. that’s why i was annoyed you were on here calling me names &amp; shit
@becca_oneal @BrooklynComedy @MsReeezy @larryowenslive @DewaynePerkins @ayoedebiri @rachelpegram we cute!
@CrowdDemon thank you. that’s all i wanted.
@CrowdDemon eh not really. more how social complicates conversation &amp; how i’ve been guilty of making things worse that could’ve been resolved by stepping away &amp; seeing the bigger picture
@CrowdDemon you know the shit i deal with on here. i’ve never been shy with the block button. i replied, you didn’t answer. i was pissed
@CrowdDemon ok. best of luck.
@CrowdDemon looking back i see i didn’t let you know the piece was shelved. that was my bad. i apologize for that. i can see how you might’ve been racking your brain thinking it was gonna misrepresent you or something. i wish you had just emailed me &amp; said that
@CrowdDemon i was extremely fair &amp; wanted to talk in hopes of changing this shitty culture and look where things are now 6 years later. it’s just gotten worse. it’s just mind boggling to me you could twist the truth in such a way. especially when i have the emails &amp; our call
@CrowdDemon i wasn’t going to “slander” you and it’s unfair to say otherwise. i wasn’t unkind to you. i didn’t do anything to you &amp; yet you’d randomly pop up &amp; say rude things about me. i don’t get it.
@CrowdDemon ok. but. i sent you the script. i asked you to give me feedback on it &amp; you never said anything about the wording. also. after our call i scrapped the piece bc it didn’t really add anything. https://t.co/YBuNSbVKwq
@OneSpeciesReal @kwinston1101 they truly pick and choose when it’s “just a joke” as if that somehow erases what’s been said.
@CrowdDemon we clearly remember things differently but ok. i’m glad things are better
@CrowdDemon what a strange rewrite of history. anyway. i had a moment of pleasant surprise &amp; now i’m disappointed. https://t.co/DFb78rf8vW

@jaredlholt it makes no sense. i’m “not relevant” but folks continue to make a living off talking about me &amp; i manage to pay my bills on time so i dunno
@Xzamilloh and thank you. every so often folks acknowledge it but whew the irony is strong w this bunch
@Xzamilloh and do you notice what’s happened a year later after all the fall out? i’m not psychic but...
@DeclanMaharaj @jaredlholt meanwhile....you’re here. if you’re so pressed by my existence just ignore me
@simplygreat4h thanks love!
@K_Rhum @ArmouredSkeptic i think “you wouldn’t understand” isn’t moving the convo forward. it’s ok to acknowledge &amp; leave it alone. thanks for the encouragement tho!
@betzva tattling? lol that’s your personal opinion &amp; is quite dramatic. they’re a news outlet. they wrote an article, they reached out to all parties for comment &amp; then stated what happened. that’s called reporting. the time frame is irrelevant.
@Redmoonblade i’m not sure you get a say in what WSJ reports on unless you’re an editor there.
@Lordof_Storms yes. they got their money returned. no WSJ is not responsible. you can still donate! by all means donate!
@teflond0nna you right
@H0nestR3d well, if you start a charity i’m sure you’ll run it the way that’s best for you. they’re simply doing the same
@ArmouredSkeptic anyway, my mistake to chime in. clearly we see this differently. i’ll leave it be. best!
@ellenem12 just an update, it's being removed! should be gone within the hour. thanks again!
@hart_chelle those parents and children will still receive care.
@hart_chelle i can't say how i would feel but St.Jude's day to day services haven't been altered because of this specific returned donation. they also aren't being prevented from donating anonymously...
@memorie_holiday it's pretty easy to understand. the fact that people are up in arms is...telling.
@ArmouredSkeptic you also mentioned he hasn't done anything illegal. which i agree. but i'm not sure where legalities come into play unless he's been charged with a crime. if he hasn't, then "he isn't doing anything illegal" is irrelevant
@kwinston1101 a "general consensus" doesn't make it true...
@ArmouredSkeptic you're correct i don't understand how YouTube enforcing their terms of service is a "bad omen" for anyone unless those folks are violating the terms of service.
@ArmouredSkeptic well i don't work for St. Jude i can't speak to their orgs policies. but they can define what "tainted money" is. according to WSJ some of the donations were attached to anti-semetic sentiments. you argued his money is good for "ANY charity" and reality it's not. they define that
@tonitonirocca i understood what you meant!
@RealJeffHoliday holy shit. this is terrifying.
RT @goodgaljenjen: My cousin’s boyfriend proposed to her but she didn’t have her nails done lmao https://t.co/FUwwplzkYg
it's also strange that people are accusing WSJ of "killing kids with cancer" when they didn't return the donations, they merely REPORTED on the donations being returned...sheesh.
@kwinston1101 why are you RT people saying "WSJ kills kids with cancer?"  that's pretty disingenuous. they didn't return the donations. they reported on it happening. even if they did, there's no evidence that those returned donations led to anyone passing away.
this is a good point https://t.co/QwkcvJlQWU
@kwinston1101 I'm not arguing it's a good thing. The fact is they're allowed to set standards on who they accept donations from.
@kwinston1101 No one is preventing them from donating anonymously. This isn't an issue of being an "alleged bigot" superchats are attached to comments. so you pay to comment. people paid to comment Semitic statements &amp; then that money was donated to St. Jude. they are allowed to return it
for ex., Mother’s Against Drunk Drivers don’t accept donations from alcohol brands. Cancer charities presumably wouldn’t want to accept donations from the tobacco industry. interesting that ppl who openly spout anti-semitic rhetoric want to argue morality w a children’s hospital
hm. YouTube super chats are in the news again. apparently people are upset St.Jude returned their donations after learning they came from folks who push anti-semitism on YouTube. FYI charities are legally allowed to decline “tainted money” https://t.co/061PUi2I2n
@ArmouredSkeptic according to https://t.co/c9khEW1ybv charities should define what they deem “tainted money” aka who they won’t take donations from. for example, “Mother’s Against Drunk Driving” don’t take donations from alcohol companies. more info here: https://t.co/vQadTp3o6O
@ArmouredSkeptic i’m blocked so i can’t see his tweet. has he been charged with a crime? st. jude’s website includes a non-discrimination notice, i assume that applies to their donations as well. ppl can certainly still donate anonymously if they want. as for YT their terms of service are clear
@ellenem12 @MTV no problem. i’m no longer on snapchat so i wouldn’t have seen it if you hadn’t shared. so thanks.
@ellenem12 @MTV i don’t disagree. but you tagged me so i felt it was worth clarifying/responding. i’ll certainly flag to my producers.

@Lady_Dedlock @she_row i’m only 5 episodes in, but they showed her journal pages typed up hanging on her wall??? girl WHAT??
@she_row the rumor about Hanna hiring writers to make her sound interesting has me LAID OUT. this shit is so ridiculous
lemme be clear. the show is trash. it’s like tv junk food. i just wanna lay on my couch &amp; not really think. Made in Mexico fills that void.
@nonyalv this &amp; Terrace House are the only reality i want and that show is super boring which...is kind of the point lol i dunno i just wanted some fluffy drama to take my mind off the real world. but i think it’s always worth being critical of what we consume even if we enjoy it
@KaraPaints hmmm i’ll check it out!
@CecilioLanz ha! i can see why you’d say that. and i say that as someone who can’t get into the Kardashian’s at all. i guess we all have our guilty trash tv pleasures
@tetines90 i get that. i think anytime there’s a “reality” show about a city it’s gonna be watered down &amp; over produced. even the reality shows everyone loves are full of tropes &amp; inaccuracies. i dunno. it’s fluff and i need fluff right now.
@KaraPaints ooooh what’s that?
@nonyalv ah that’s totally fair. but i’d argue most reality shows aren’t an accurate representation of X place. the housewives shows for example. i don’t watch any of them but i know people love them
@NeoLibMess ooooh! pat hasn’t watched it, but i might convince him
@CecilioLanz i mean it’s “reality” but one of the guys has talked openly about his alcoholism &amp; how he’s lost contact w his son which surprised me. not something i’d expect on a fluffy reality show. is there something specific that bothers you about it?
@she_row are we the same person?! i’m pretending this is helping me learn spanish but it totally isn’t 😂
@catgirl1996121 i usually don’t like reality shows but i like that this group actually know each other &amp; are related. it *feels* more realistic? i dunno the drama is so good tho

@TheStrangePen there’s also misdirection &amp; analogies (which are my fave) lots of writing tricks &amp; excercises that can help you get started!
@TheStrangePen sure is! not every joke follows it but many of the best jokes are premise + mix = act out ie. “ever notice how X happens? what if it happened like Y? it would sound like Z”
@rafnarr yay! so glad it helps
@TheStrangePen i think everyone is funny in their own way. humor is inherent in how we communicate. humor is also subjective. so what you find funny i might not &amp; vice versa. but there is a formula to writing jokes just like there’s a formula to reading/writing music.

@Live4derby truly
if any of this advice/encouragement spoke to you, do this for me: go through your phone and text 3 people you haven't talked to in a bit. remind them of a funny memory you shared, send them that new song you've been jamming to or just let them know that you miss them &amp; care
here are some things that've helped me recently: logging off. staying off social media &amp; living in the moment. unfollowing/muting people who make me feel bad or insecure about myself. focusing on what i can control instead of what i can't. asking for help. making others smile.
i often find that social media makes me feel WORSE about what i'm going through because well...duh the internet is trash. the world is a mess. and on top of all that people go online &amp; lie and stunt about how *great* their lives are.
you know what inspired this DM encouragement session? ME feeling shitty about where i'm at in life. directionless. stressed. sad. everyone has been there, even the people you look up to and incorrectly assume have it all figured out.
@RealJeffHoliday that really means a lot Jeff. thank you. take care too &amp; don’t be a stranger. i’m around!
i've been up since 5am sending DMs but i gotta take a break and get ready for the gym. i can't answer everyone but i wanna address some common themes. career anxiety. feeling directionless. overwhelmed with school/work. feeling lonely. i just wanna say these are NORMAL FEELINGS
post college grad anxieties are so real! https://t.co/wEvLQ48zaO
@RealJeffHoliday to encourage some really shitty behavior that hurt me and a lot of people. i wish more people were mature enough to acknowledge the problem but i'm happy to have moved on. glad you're onto new things as well. best of luck to you and mame
@RealJeffHoliday but people engaged in all sorts of behavior in the name of "shit posting" or "debunking" that was plain unfair to me and many others. i rightly predicted people would shift gears once things got bad and look. they did. it's a slippery slope &amp; too many used their platforms
@RealJeffHoliday politics aside, i can't say i've ever thought it was a good or fair to call someone an "ugly cunt" bc you disagreed with them, or encourage strangers to edit gross pictures of someone's partner, or edit clips of them to say things they haven't said. not saying YOU did that
@RealJeffHoliday that's big of you to acknowledge. that said, i hope you go back and listen to some of the things that were said about me BEFORE things went off the deep end. "shit posting" has real consequences &amp; it sucks that someone has to go that far for anyone to see there's an issue

@_DrMomLady @mashtonaddy @KWright0702 @shanedawson this thread is already so great! the finish line is SO CLOSE! plan something to celebrate your accomplishment, even if it’s just a big ole piece of your favorite cake or a movie night with your friends. you earned it &amp; will CRUSH grad school just like you did undergrad. congrats!
@theillestsav @shanedawson finally, while it’s a big decision it doesn’t have to be a life long one. you can always change your mind &amp; do something else. you’re YOUNG &amp; have a long life ahead of you. this is one moment in a long list of moments that’ll shape your life. i’m sure you’ll make the right choice
@theillestsav @shanedawson what can you do where you are right now to lay the foundation for that life you want? moving to another state is always a big decision so really lay out what you’ll need to get there &amp; work towards that. how much will it cost to move? who do you know there? finding a job, apt...
@theillestsav @shanedawson woa! huge huge huge decisions there! here’s a secret, you’re never too old to start something new &amp; you don’t have to do everything at once! it’s ok to tackle one thing at a time. do you have to move to cali to start your own life?
@AhamaDegr8 thanks dude!
@UnicornZombies @shanedawson stay strong and i’m so so proud of you ❤️
@UnicornZombies @shanedawson you’re human. it’s gonna take time to fully recover &amp; move forward. that’s ok! my advice is to get into therapy if you aren’t already or look for a local crisis line or non profit for women coming out of abusive relationships. you don’t have to do this alone.
@UnicornZombies @shanedawson sis. you are SO STRONG. you did something so scary but so so important. i can only imagine how hard it is not to go back but remember why you left in the first place. because you deserve better. 5 years is a long time, but the rest of your life is longer. and that’s what’s ahead
ok i’m going to bed but hit me up if you need some encouragement &amp; in the am i’ll creep through your feed for intel (or you can share what’s stressing you if you feel comfortable) &amp; send you some DM goodness ❤️
can someone create a job for me where i just slide up in people’s DMs &amp; offer encouragement?

@CodePurpleAB @RealJeffHoliday @gorskon @ksenapathy again, i NEVER said that. goodnight.
@CodePurpleAB @RealJeffHoliday @gorskon @ksenapathy i’ve never said anything about “racial purity” or discounted that mixed race ppl face judgement from all sides. you’re projecting things onto my video that i didn’t say nor believe which isn’t fair. so i’m gonna respectfully bow out of this convo. best.
@RealJeffHoliday that said, you’re the only highly visible person who said anything to me directly about it &amp; that counts for something in my book
@RealJeffHoliday i don’t keep tabs on your content but i think it’s safe to say the past year has opened lots of people’s eyes &amp; i appreciate anyone who’s acknowledged how shitty that whole thing was, even if we don’t see eye to eye on other things
@RealJeffHoliday yup! it’s old, 2015. there were 2 parts. i linked to the 2nd part. the first had more vlog &amp; the snaps at the end. as for former critic...i think if you watch content solely to be critical you’re gonna find what you’re looking for. i also know time tends to reveal things...
@CodePurpleAB @RealJeffHoliday @gorskon @ksenapathy i didn’t redefine what fetishization is...not to mention the vid is about what people have said TO ME &amp; how i’ve felt about it. you’re certainly allowed to feel otherwise, but i’d rather not be misrepresented.
@ksenapathy @CodePurpleAB @RealJeffHoliday @gorskon thanks! yea i’m not sure how anyone could misinterpret the video but i think some ppl are happy to jump to conclusions whenever they see my name. it’s easier than actually listening to what i’ve said lol thanks for sharing the vid &amp; for your kind words!

@CodePurpleAB @RealJeffHoliday @gorskon @ksenapathy hi! i think you misunderstood what my vid was about. i hope you actually watch it bc it includes clips from mixed race ppl about how they’ve been fetishized. i hope that hasn’t been your daughters experience but it has been for many mixed race people https://t.co/QWq60cXqDT
@ChamarRache @Imalexnicholson well thanks for being open to hearing another perspective! i realize folks won’t always agree but i take real issue with a grown man screaming in a woman’s face over another woman’s sex life. like. why is anyone THAT invested?
@monkasmax lemme know when you find out lol
@ChamarRache @Imalexnicholson sorry, i responding to your RT
@Imalexnicholson @ChamarRache hope that long answer provides some clarity/insight!
@G_AguilarOfLA @hasanminhaj it was such a brilliant analogy! and thank you, that’s very kind
@Imalexnicholson @ChamarRache personally, i’m happily married been with the same dude for 12 years. i’m not interested in a tell all sex book. but i support women doing what’s right for themselves. i think part of adulthood is respecting others choices even if they aren’t ones you’d make for yourself
@Imalexnicholson @ChamarRache personally i don’t understand why in 2018 people are pressed over what consenting adults do with their bodies, especially women. there’s a major double standard &amp; that’s what Scottie was referring to. Joe’s reaction was demeaning &amp; uncalled for
@Imalexnicholson @ChamarRache i’ve yet to see anyone claim a tell all book is “empowering” but even so, everyone’s version of what makes them feel good about themselves is different. the point is a woman’s decision to talk about her sex life is her decision same as a man is allowed to make that same choice

affirming a woman’s right to do what she wants with her body including *gasp* write a book about those activities has NOTHING to do with hating men. if you think otherwise you’re incredibly vain &amp; incredibly insecure.

@DeniseFlores @MoreAndAgain vegan cheese is surprisingly good! daiya is where it's at
@MoreAndAgain here's a basic recipe. you can really add whatever you want. sometimes i make them with cold brew coffee https://t.co/eDcmGe49NG
@DeniseFlores @MoreAndAgain i think she said she doesn't do dairy, womp. but maybe you could make these with vegan cream cheese? my husband and i've been making peanut butter fat bombs and they're AMAZING
@MoreAndAgain oh yeah overnight chia pudding is really good! you could do blue berries or strawberries to keep the carbs low. i use almond milk and sometimes add coconut whip cream. WHOO it's so good
@MoreAndAgain do you like quinoa? another thing that's great is chia seeds. they have some fat and protein and are great in smoothies
@DeniseFlores @MoreAndAgain they also have a coco powdered peanut butter that's pretty good too
@DeniseFlores @MoreAndAgain SERIOUSLY. it's changed my life. it blends so much easier
@MoreAndAgain sorry if this is repetitive. damn twitter. my suggestion is, before you even make your meals for the week. plug them into your app. see where you're over or under and then adjust accordingly. THEN prep your food for the week based on your plan. that way you hit it every day
@MoreAndAgain do you plug your meals into MFP or another app beforehand to get your measurements correct? that's what i mean. just used eggs as an example of how you tweak measurements to hit the goals for the day
@MoreAndAgain you're welcome! you got this!
@iSmashFizzle @HeyFranHey aw yeah!
@MoreAndAgain but if you plan your day, how do you know you're not gonna make your target? you should just adjust your measurements til you hit it. for example, make 3 eggs instead of 2. add half a cup of egg whites, use 2 tbs of oil on your salad instead of 1 etc etc
@MoreAndAgain i did keto for a month and used pinterest to find snacks and deserts. there's all sorts of stuff on there. it's a little more work though cause you have to plug the recipe ingredients in first, but once its in there you're good
@MoreAndAgain if you're not a fish person don't force it. but the biggest thing is planning beforehand so you can map out exactly what and how much to eat each day so don't get to 9pm and realize you need more X.
@MoreAndAgain sure you can! you just have to adjust what you're eating to accommodate it. if you're using myfitnesspal, plug in all the stuff you wanna eat the night before and then just adjust the measurements until you hit all your goals.
@MoreAndAgain bacon is high in fat and so is salmon. try adding those to your diet and then tweaking your meals around those.
@MoreAndAgain that's why you gotta plan your day ahead. 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts is only 9 carbs.
@MoreAndAgain also, you can get sugar free peanut butter!
@MoreAndAgain are you avoiding sugar period or are you on a specific diet?
@MoreAndAgain oh! you could do 1/2 cup of salted macadamia nuts! they're hella fatty and really tasty
@MoreAndAgain do you just track as you go? cause planning ahead has really helped me. depending on how much protein you're trying to eat, you could do slices of avocado wrapped in smoked salmon. or do peanut butter on celery or apple slices.
@lepetiterobot @MoreAndAgain oh yea, avocados are also great!
@MoreAndAgain try adding coconut oil or olive oil to what you're cooking! peanut butter is also good. i dunno if you're a smoothie person, but adding 2 tablespoons should do the trick

@ClatisC @shepersists2 @andr_w @MillyTamarez @tommyxtopher i realized what you were saying after i reread your reply. thanks for clarifying!
@ClatisC @andr_w @MillyTamarez @tommyxtopher and just to be clear, she mentions the Diana Ross costume because Luanne got called out for doing blackface in her costume. Megyn assumes the blackface made the costume authentic, when it really just makes it racist
@ClatisC @andr_w @MillyTamarez @tommyxtopher yeeeeah but Diana's race isn't a costume. You could dress up as her without painting yourself black. it reduces her personhood to a caricature regardless of the intent. you can't remove the historical context of blackface

@hiss_goddessss sadly, i've had too many abusive people pop up and demand i forgive them when i just don't want anything to do with them. i see it happen a lot. it's less about self improvement and more about feeling guilty.
@hiss_goddessss meh. not everyone deserves forgiveness just because they've asked. remorse is more than just saying "i'm sorry" it requires action and commitment to change. and even then, people are allowed to process their pain without embracing the person who caused it
“when someone shows you who they are, believe them” — Maya Angelou
i believe people can change. thank goodness i’m not the same person i was 10 or 15 yrs ago. but you have to WANT to change &amp; that means doing a lot of self reflection &amp; personal work that will most likely not be praised or recognized. you gotta bake your own cookies folks.
@Raquel_Savage you right
@dammitfranky agreed. but then again time feels sped up across every aspect of my life these days.
forgiveness is a personal choice. you wanna forgive? dope. some don’t want to &amp; that’s their choice. but remember it’s easy to forgive when you aren’t on the receiving end of someone else’s harmful behavior. y’all out here “forgiving” slurs not about you? oh ok.

@wanderly05 @kealasettle oh yea she would be great. her voice is ridiculous
@Ashtonakaleegle i literally just tweeted the video lol
@scarynikki12 i have no doubt she could handle the vocals. but i think the role should go to a fat woman since that’s how it was written
@KelpiePellegrin have you seen this? https://t.co/A1fjyrkshe
@khaleesi_britt @ittybittypixie she owns it and she's downright GLEEFUL. nothing about her is bitter or unhappy which is a nice change of pace for a female villain. nothing about her reads as jealous of Ariel, she's just a bad ass
@ittybittypixie yeah there's something so great about how unapologetic she is. she just doesn't give a fuck.
@ittybittypixie that's a fair conclusion. i've always wanted to know more of Ursula's story, I think she could have a great origin movie that could make her into a full person instead of a one dimensional trope
See Tituss Burgess Sing 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' https://t.co/ILCHh09EMB
@ittybittypixie i think it's important to showcase different body types on screen. personally, i don't think having a black woman play that role means it has to play into stereotypes about dark skinned women or larger bodies. that comes down to writing

@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove and thank you!
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove yeah we're on the same page there. i really don't like "stan culture" which suggests any sort of critique is "hating" and you should throw your support behind someone without holding them to any sort of standard &amp; then attacking anyone that does. it's gross
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove tis not. i’d have to dig for her response but perhaps i’m misremembering
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove i also think true remorse requires more than an apology &amp; truthfully i don't know if she's done that work because i don't really follow her like that.
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove personally the way the news cycle moves these days, i'm finding it harder to keep track of who's done or said what. i think people can learn &amp; grow if they want to but everyone has to decide for themselves who they're willing to support. i understand &amp; respect that.
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove was that the video from a few years ago where she was saying she would "punish" a guy for cheating on her? cause i recall her apologizing for it. i hadn't heard anything about defending offset saying something homophobic.
@DavenyEllis i've watched this 800 times
@darkskintdaria i love that my followers are ready to pull up lol
@siobhan_ed @JSoAbove to my knowledge she admitted her use of the t slur was inappropriate and hasn't used it since.

@BillyESmith @BetteMidler white women aren't and have never been considered the n-word.
if your allyship is contingent on being coddled and comfortable you're doing it wrong
@tresedemayo as someone who has spent many years educating others, often FOR FREE, i’m well aware of how tone influences a message. anger is often part of one’s education. and i’m both angry and disappointed. do you correct Bette on her use of profanity too?
@tresedemayo you talked down to me and minimized my anger as if it invalidated the truth. it does not. you insinuated i was “attacking” Bette which is the same rhetoric often used to dismiss anyone who dares give voice to their pain or speak out against oppression.
@XanaduFitness that’s heartbreaking 😓
@tresedemayo @BetteMidler after thirty four years on this planet, writing a book, working in tv, speaking at colleges around the world, exec producing over 90 episodes of a web series on identity with over a billion views, i am well aware of how words work. but thank you for reminding me.

@Screenplaya @ToddyJones @BetteMidler WHITE WOMEN. Bette Midler is NOT being called the n-word. she experience the oppression that word upholds. her ancestors were not raped &amp; killed while it was shouted at them. black men &amp; women have been MURDERED off the word of white women. so no all women aren’t the n-word
@Screenplaya @ToddyJones @BetteMidler i’m called a nigger DAILY on this platform. this bullshit quote erases black women &amp; our experiences by suggesting that ALL women have the same oppression &amp; they DO NOT. you don’t get it bc you’d rather center your voice than listen &amp; you don’t know what you’re talking about

@icantconfront “girl” is often used a term of endearment among women. sure she’s grown but i don’t think caring about someone’s well being is the same as infantilizing
@yve_ning28 yea this is truly nothing worth blocking someone over. it’s fine if it doesn’t bother you. i just don’t have any interest in going back &amp; forth about it.
@clairewillett hence not tweeting her name. her stans are RABID. the stan/celeb dynamic is very strange
@yve_ning28 i didn’t block you
@clairewillett i really feel for her.
@mitzy247 i hope you’re right. he gives me the creeps
@clairewillett same. i don’t feel good about where this is heading. lots of bad signs w that one.
it also really creeps me out that he CONSTANTLY talks about how hot she is? like. nothing to say about her personality, it’s just constant fawning &amp; objectifying. i usually don’t care for celeb relationships but i’m worrying about this girl like she’s my family. ugh.
@BrandenLee1 i dunno. i’m reluctant to blame someone for being attracted to damaged/toxic people. that’s usually a result of some deeper issue. i hope she’s ok.
if i was having the toughest year of my life i don’t think i’d want my partner doing a press tour &amp; giving explicit details about our sex life. i worry for that girl.

@BenMumford1990 @jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex i said i hadn’t seen it but i’m sure she’s felt that way. i’m also not responsible for that persons tweet nor am i combing through her mentions to know what strangers are saying to her. take your cape elsewhere bruh
@BenMumford1990 @jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex let’s not pretend i didn’t just acknowledge that her feelings were valid even though that wasn’t happening in our convo. or better yet, leave me alone
@Aish_Sampath no problem. thanks for taking the time  💖
@Aish_Sampath you aren't muted. no problem. i wish more people would do that before jumping in. i get people wanting to come to her defense but it turned into something it didn't need to. it's all good, let's put it behind us.
@Aish_Sampath yes, everyone is allowed to use whatever tone they want. and in turn i'm allowed to say how i feel about that tone. i didn't attack her or anyone else &amp; that was my point from the jump.
@Aish_Sampath you see it that way, but i don't believe that's how the conversation went. i didn't dismiss her, i said i was speaking about our convo, not how she's been treated elsewhere on twitter. i'm not sure what else needs to be said here.
@Aish_Sampath i'm not sure what's "tilted?" i literally said to her "you’re human! no one gets everything right all the time, that’s impossible." but i think the tone of this convo veered into "i'm being attacked" and i wasn't attacking anyone.

@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex i think the character limit is making this difficult &amp; i’m circling the same point that’s already been made multiple times so i’m gonna leave this alone. congrats on the upcoming season &amp; best of luck.
@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex i’m also a woc on twitter in the biz. i’ve experienced it myself. i’m saying HERE, in this thread between you and i.
@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex i think we (as thin women in this biz) have to be sensitive to who gets the spotlight in these convos. that’s not your fault but stepping back &amp; passing the mic is important. lots of us deal w body shame, but it’s not all the same experience &amp; that seems to be missing
@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex of course! you’re human! no one gets everything right all the time, that’s impossible. and of course twitter complicates things even further. honestly i don’t see you being torn to pieces here, but i’m sure you feel otherwise or have felt at times. i get that.
@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex “would it be better if” reads as sarcastic but ok. i’m not gonna speak for Steph, i think her words were clear to start. but i think it’s important to uplift voices that don’t get the same visibility. you have every right to talk about your experience
@Addict4Music @jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex i haven’t treated anyone in any sort of way. but it’s telling that so many are projecting onto this thread. hence why it’s being muted
@jameelajamil @amzmel @NerdAboutTown @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex that’s awful and no one should have to go through that. nowhere did i or anyone suggest you shouldn’t say anything &amp; i’m annoyed that is your response considering i said quite plainly i have no doubt your heart is in the right place. but i’m not gonna repeat what Stephanie said
@amzmel @NerdAboutTown @jameelajamil @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex Stephanie’s words were very clear. i believe Jameela’s heart is in the right place, but she’s become the face of a movement that wasn’t created for her. she’s still a thin &amp; conventionally attractive woman. BP was created to uplift fat/plus bodies &amp; that has been watered down
@amzmel @NerdAboutTown @jameelajamil @yvonnemaryo @ValerieComplex you’re projecting meaning &amp; tone onto her tweets that wasn’t there. no one was belittled. support is awesome. but support means not speaking over or co-opting. unfortunately BP has turned into a catch all rather than its original purpose
@mcc_shawn @tieoptional same but i hear they’re really stinky 😬
@NerdAboutTown how bizarre. i mean...women of all sizes have body image issues but it’s weird to see her posing &amp; dressing in a way that kinda masks her thinness? i just looked at her body positivity insta and...everyone is thin/average. why not pass the mic to actual fat women?

@FredTJoseph “celebrity” is relative, so i think that would be hard to apply fairly? i think it’d make more sense to improve the safety features so everyone could better control their experience &amp; make verification simply a way to protect against impersonation (which is why i got it)
@FredTJoseph i’m not sure that would prevent people from being irresponsible on here. i see all sorts of behavior from ppl who’re verified &amp; people who aren’t. i think social media is much like alcohol, it lowers inhibitions &amp; their behavior says more about the person than the platform itself

@MetalBrains92 it's all good. i realize it might look a certain way since we released the ep a few weeks after the festival, but we say in it that we just came from day 1, didn't go for day 2. we're on a delayed release bc of our busy schedules
@MetalBrains92 cool. more than happy to listen to the pod you did about the festival &amp; issues posed. hope you know in the future you can always hit me up directly if/when there's a problem. i'm more than happy to listen/talk
@MetalBrains92 ok. well, i think if you had tweeted me directly it would've been read differently. that said i know the convo around afropunk has been ongoing and more has come to light since we recorded (after day 1)
@MetalBrains92 i hear you. my feelings about it are of course going to be shaped by my perspective and experiences and in no way do i want to invalidate what afropunk in the past has meant for folks. my stance was that orgs evolve BUT i also get why people are unhappy
@MetalBrains92 here's what i said, i understand why people who're looking for punk music would be disappointed now that there are more mainstream artists and it's not really punk focused.
@MetalBrains92 i'm re-listening to the episode, only bc we recorded it a few weeks ago, but i'm not sure that's what i implied. i think there's lots of valid criticism of the festival, but i also understand they want to make money
@MetalBrains92 hey! i'm not sure anyone's labeled my work as "radical" but i certainly haven't. i've very often acknowledged it's 101 but still believe it's valuable

@MrSidViciousJr @lady_angelica @HigumaNoLimit @leilaclaire ok but. this is a clip from 2016 &amp; the man is our president so of course people are going to talk about him. i shared this bc i worked on the show &amp; have fond memories of meeting and working with Mac. stop making this about you and your fee fees about Trump. move on.
@JagunEsq @crissles @tieoptional @lastname_basis don't do this
@BritniDWrites @freeblackgirl i don't blame you. you're smart to be careful about those messages. it's just so sad when you see artists calling out for help like that and then their life is cut short
@ashleyseidel yeah it's weird. i worked on the show so i actually met him and we did a segment together about the election. he was really funny and smart, i thought the piece was so great &amp; am glad to have the memory with him beyond his awesome music
#NowPlaying 🎵 https://t.co/YSX9onaOxo
@womanyst and he was so great to work with. he was a true talent, it's really so sad
@kobesix1 @SunlitRoads how dare i pay tribute by posting a memory i had of a musician i liked and was lucky enough to work with.
@helloitsariana amen
@SunlitRoads it’s disrespectful to post a memory i had of him? please go somewhere
@BritniDWrites @freeblackgirl yea some of his songs were very dark 😓

@chrislhayes yea it’s a bummer bc YT creates these tools that are supposed to help creators but instead people abuse them to push false info, white nationalism &amp; harassment. it’s a huge business &amp; the average person has no clue
@chrislhayes youtube also does nothing to discourage deceptive thumbnails, tags or titles. so people can suggest you’ve said something completely untrue/inflammatory &amp; their tagging/titles help them overwhelm your search results, related &amp; recommended. it’s awful
@chrislhayes these people essentially abuse the algorithm by pumping out multiple videos about one person/video. in addition to being filled with misinformation they’re extremely long, which youtube now favors, so it’s nearly impossible to compete w multiple hour long videos vs your one 5 min
@chrislhayes this has been a problem for a while &amp; they refuse to do anything about it. there’s a subset of youtubers who harass creators (myself included) and they’re making big money off it. it’s really depressing especially for those of us who saw YT as a place for creativity &amp; community

@peaceofculture i get invited to speak at events &amp; sometimes they don’t tell you who’s on the bill until the official announcement. it’s annoying. i narrowly escaped a similar situation with another event.  the contract was sketchy so i passed &amp; then the guest list dropped &amp; i was shocked

@inkredibleHAK99 i like that too!
sadly, "it's not what you know it's who you know" applies to most industries including entertainment &amp; writing. so checking out local writer workshops, clubs, theaters is a must. that way you can meet &amp; collaborate with up and comers in the biz. a high tide raises all boats!
@esmebee67 here ya go! https://t.co/xYuFOFd8yu
my advice is to write that pilot/spec/feature/writing packet &amp; network with other writers to get agent/manager intros. most don’t have open submissions, they want a client recommendation or to scout you themselves. entering local festivals/contests is another great way to be seen
sold a show in 2017 &amp; another beginning of 2018, both are still in development. tv is slow. the thing that’s really helped me is having an agent/manager. but i only got them bc i started creating content &amp; sharing on YouTube bc i couldn’t get representation
viral video in 2012 which is how i got signed by an agent. my agent connected me to my manager in 2013 started submitting writing packets &amp; then pitched a show w my manager in 2014. that show then became MTV Decoded. got staffed at Nightly Show 2016 bc of Decoded https://t.co/Zd5gwTWdR5

@chanzferdinand also. maybe it's not possible. and i'm still not bothered by that. there are plenty of people who face no legal consequences of their behavior and are still able to live their life as they want. asking for forgiveness/redemption doesn't mean you're owed it.
@HeyFranHey @talkspace @IGTV @JorElCaraballo so freaking proud of you!!! &lt;3
@chanzferdinand my point is and still remains, i PERSONALLY don't have interest in rehabilitating abusers. that's not my job. and it's shitty for MIB to suggest that is the responsibility of #metoo that's work those individuals have to do themselves. and the resources are available
@chanzferdinand there are also lots of programs that work with survivors of sexual assault including RAAIN. but again, a survivors ability to heal and move forward is completely separate from abusers and not their job to fix. #metoo is a movement for survivors, not rehabilitating abusers
@chanzferdinand my response still applies. "redemption" for anyone means doing the work to atone for your behavior &amp; seek the forgiveness of your victims. there are tons of programs for sex offenders, IF they want to seek them out or they're court ordered. that's not the survivors job to fix
@battymamzelle woa. our brains are weird. you know you're my girl!
@chanzferdinand louis c.k. is a multi millionaire, he’s never going to be “stuck” in life. redemption requires doing work to atone and earn forgiveness. he’s done neither &amp; frankly i don’t have sympathy for folks who face long term consequences for their bad behavior
@TheLady_Lazarus we have to be here for each other ❤️
@BonnieRose_88 @hijade2madre a lot of people could stand to learn this. too often people act as if they’re owed forgiveness &amp; that’s just not how it works
@michaelianblack it’s appreciated. i hope this goes into your book! best.
@michaelianblack we all fuck up. we’re human. it’s impossible for us to know what we don’t know. i’m the queen of fuck ups. trust. but it’s important to remember our intentions don’t absolve our impact. we gotta focus on what we DID, not what we MEANT to do.
@MeganAGramlich every single person on earth has privilege. a rich white male comedian who’s friends with louie c.k. is absolutely showing his privilege &amp; ignorance by using “time served” to describe an admitted sexual harasser who’s faced no jail time while damaging the careers of his victims
@HepCatPJs let’s be real, louie &amp; his family will be rich for a looooong ass time. he never needs to work again, which is another reason he gets no sympathy from me. he could &amp; should just go away
@justkelly_ok ugh. you and me both. for all the righteous anger that mess stirred up, it was comforting to see so many of us getting in formation &amp; shutting it down. hope today is a better day for all of us
@michaelianblack that said...this is WORK. and as a white dude with a lot of talent &amp; influence, i truly hope you’re prepared to do it. i’m not sure where you’re at in your book writing process but i think it would be smart to do that homework now to have the best impact
@michaelianblack i realize the entire internet came down on you yesterday &amp; while as of late i’ve been trying to avoid that, i do think anger is an important part of ones education. clearly there’s a lot you needed to hear &amp; reflect on, and so i commend you for beginning to do that work.
@michaelianblack thank you. it’s also worth stating there are tons of male survivors who deal with a whole different level of shame &amp; we have to include them in convos as well. i try to use gender neutral language for that reason.

@PAYOLETTER @migueAYB oh hey!! 🙌🏾
not to mention, we BARELY support folks who’re brave enough to come forward as survivors of sexual assault!!! that’s the whole POINT of #metoo! i didn’t speak up for YEARS because when i tried to my co-workers &amp; “friends” shamed me. but now it’s OUR JOB to rehabilitate?! FOH
@em_williams14 UUUUUUUGHHHH https://t.co/yosesECokl
also @michaelianblack i take high offense to the suggestion that men are “caught up in” in the #metoo movement. sexual assault isn’t some inconvenience like a fucking stormy afternoon, it’s a conscious CHOICE. stop minimizing abuse &amp; “suggesting” how survivors should respond
seriously?! it is absolutely not the job of survivors to rehabilitate abusers. you wanna do that work? awesome.  we’re not your fucking mules. our society already bends over backwards to embrace/reward/protect abusers. your privilege &amp; ignorance are on full display here https://t.co/o1rzMPtZHW

@bazaaroftales @netflix they’ve purchased a few weekly shows, i would hope they’d do what’s needed to help them be successful. i get netflix notifications for random stuff i didn’t ask for and not the show i wanna see which...was odd to me. but lesson learned. hopefully they don’t screw ober Hasan
@bazaaroftales @netflix i knew what you meant 😊 and i don’t think you’re trying to argue. i think it’s ok if we see it differently. i work in tv &amp; have lots of friends over there so i have a slightly different perspective on how things were handled
@bazaaroftales @netflix important to note that tv shows are sold. so they purchased the show. i can’t presume to know why but they can see what works and doesn’t on their platform
@sweetest_karma @netflix 😂😂😂 yea girl you thirsty
@bazaaroftales @netflix they have another weekly show premiering in October, so again, if they decide to keep buying and producing weekly shows they should at the very least set the shows up for success by making sure the platform supports it. otherwise...stop doing the shows.
@bazaaroftales @netflix i think they have to assume some responsibility. they purchased and produced the show &amp; it was in the works for some time before it premiered. they could’ve accommodated a weekly show &amp; it wasn’t their first. also, announcing a cancelation via twitter &amp; not directly is tacky

@aBroham_lncoln @roybelly @netflix @benshapiro none of these are free speech issues though. cancelling tv shows and events have nothing to do with our government. sooooo save it
@octopodashuffle @netflix watch the first season of any successful show. they’re all clunky. it’s part of the process
really looking forward to this! @netflix please get it together, weekly shows deserve a chance to thrive https://t.co/2yVIbSGhqZ
@ChrisCataluna_ @seb90266 @netflix ah look at this mature ass discourse! yes!
@Granite_Running @netflix weird, i didn’t see that when i logged in. clearly they didn’t that figure out
@octopodashuffle @netflix you do realize everything isn’t for everyone? there are lots of tv shows i don’t enjoy that others do. that said, the show was brand new. every show takes time to find its voice, especially when you’re building from the ground up.
@roybelly @netflix right?? so corny. for people who piss and moan about “free speech” and “snowflakes” gloating over this exposes their hypocrisy and sensitivity
@Klezmerstyle @netflix i kinda agree BUT they could’ve been more accommodating with notifications and placement
i get emails &amp; iphone notifications from @netflix when they add a show they “think i’d like” but they can’t notify me when there’s new episodes of a weekly show i’ve added to my list and WANT to watch? that...makes no sense. i hope they don’t drop the ball on @hasanminhaj in Oct
sadly the @netflix interface doesn’t support a weekly show. i enjoyed #TheBreak but never got notifications about new episodes?! thats crucial for a wkly topical show! no premium placement on login? c’mon. i wish y’all had figured this out after Chelsea 😓
such sad news. it’s bad enough they killed a great show before it had time to really get cooking but @netflix really should’ve handled the announcement better https://t.co/7vCyZamp1L
@angryblkhoemo yup. “oh you don’t know who X is?!” they have a million followers and yet no one in my real life knows them! it’s too funny
@CaseyNuge amen! so glad this spoke to you!
@angryblkhoemo oh for sure. we’re all works in progress
@blupheonix @classiclib3ral he’s being sarcastic &amp; making fun of people who equate a private platform setting standards w 1984
@angryblkhoemo welp! 😂
yup. and i’ve seen some great folks lose their accounts this way 😓 https://t.co/F1gZsKUuBh
@IBJIYONGI @kelleent ha! fair. i’ve also found that sometimes you stick your neck out for someone without knowing the whole story and then you get dragged down with them. i’m more inclined to offline with people when i see something going down
same. at the time it felt cathartic but it’s a ginormous waste of time, gives them what they want, can make you look self righteous (even if it’s justified) and/or unfocused (who has the time?) and worse is unfair to your audience who actually WANTS &amp; deserves your attention https://t.co/B6hEOM2r0A
@ValerieComplex @Keah_Maria @kelleent @Steph_I_Will BEYONF EXHAUSTING. as if dealing w our own folks isn’t hard enough, the racist sexist trolls STAY trying us on here. and in my experience, engaging that faction only makes it worse for yourself
my recipe for social media vs life balance https://t.co/y74FTzDTqw
@allyssacapri i am so EMBARRASSED
@ReignOfApril @kelleent @Steph_I_Will that said “twitter memory” doesn’t always translate to real life. i can’t tell you how many stories were HUGE in my online circle and no one IRL knew what i was talking about which was perspective shifting for me.
@ReignOfApril @kelleent @Steph_I_Will just to be clear, i’m not speaking on anyone in particular bc as we all know there’s a new person every week. but yes, folks will move on but there are some who’re just lying in wait for people to mess up which...kinda bothers me. even though i’ve been guilty myself
@kelleent @Keah_Maria @Steph_I_Will YUP! the day my boss said something to me about how often i was running my mouth on twitter was the day i realized i needed to chill out. folks forget everyone is watching. most times you won’t know you’re being passed over bc no one will tell you. it just happens
@ValerieComplex @Keah_Maria @kelleent @Steph_I_Will first, i had to admit to myself that i wasted a lot of time talking about other people’s work instead of making my own. then i try to step back before i jump in to comment on whatever hot topic of the moment. am i adding anything valuable? or talking just to talk?
@Keah_Maria ah thank you!! and congrats!
@ValerieComplex @kelleent @Keah_Maria @Steph_I_Will oh absolutely. doubling down only makes it worse. also this: https://t.co/WurFoLdcJg
@Keah_Maria @kelleent @Steph_I_Will oh of course. even though it’s online it’s still scary as hell. these days i’m happy to mind my business &amp; focus on my offline life as much as possible. i’ve had too many hours lost, hurt feelings, &amp; hard lessons learned on here. looking back it could’ve been avoided.
@Keah_Maria @kelleent @Steph_I_Will this is a very specific fear that *personally* feels kinda silly to give voice to but is very real
@kelleent well, as someone who’s been on both sides, i think being able to step back is important &amp; also having a circle offline that will check you when you inevitably screw up. it’s nearly impossible to see the forrest from the trees when everyone is coming for you even if you earned it
@kelleent @Steph_I_Will while at times entertaining, it also gives me major anxiety
@aminatou @annfriedman @Big_Friendship well deserved &amp; long overdue! congrats! https://t.co/CVYGUhDfU9
@Steph_I_Will @kelleent no one is safe

@theleroywalker yeah. it's called a joke.
screw a tape of Trump saying the n-word. Omorosa should drop a tape of him saying "I support black lives matter" that would fuck his supporters up.

@Basseyworld @PrestonMitchum everyone thinks they need a “hot take” on any and everything, especially if it’s something going viral.
@Basseyworld agreed. not to mention she “gets away with it” purely bc she’s a tv personality on a press tour &amp; doesn’t have anyone to answer to. if you or i acted like that? forget it.
@PrestonMitchum @Basseyworld she’s a self centered &amp; very skilled liar. that’s nothing to celebrate. i’m embarrassed by folks passing around that TODAY show clip like “she DID THAT”
@Basseyworld it’s weird to see people complimenting her. like? ok she’s “good” at being mean, talking over people, manipulation &amp; shameless self promo. why should i be impressed?

@ElCapitahn that’s not how free speech works. but sure.
the thing that annoys me is i’ve now become a “source” when it comes to dealing w online harassment. like. it’s part of my bio? &amp; when i see it happening to ppl i feel obligated to help bc i know how isolating &amp; scary it can be. but i also hate that this is now a skill of mine?
i’ve made so many great friends here, but the harassment is so tiresome, it’s just not worth it. thankfully i’m busy IRL but most days i don’t have an interest in being on here cause there’s an entire fleet of ppl determined to make it awful for everyone &amp; twitter doesn’t do shit
here’s the thing. i’m well aware these social networks don’t have our best interests in mind. i just wish they’d cut the shit &amp; be real with it. the abusers &amp; bigots are fervent users which = $$$

@tekkwene i’m assuming “there are more important things to report on” which is also a bummer
@xeronius i can only speculate but after reading follow up tweets i *think* it was an attempt at “there are more important things to report on” which is an equally bad take
some of y’all are really just on this app to argue https://t.co/q67CCJG6vk
@AncapZach i think you’re projecting meaning onto my response, which isn’t fair.
@jaketapper i realize things can get lost in translation on here. it happens to the best of us. but i hope you see why some have been turn off by the above tweet despite your intentions
@AncapZach i don’t have anything to do w how this moment has been portrayed by the media? people like beyoncé &amp; jay z, they’re on a huge stadium tour. people like celeb sightings at concerts. it’s ok if you don’t like them or the moment, people are allowed to enjoy someone you don’t
@jaketapper sure those are the facts, but the state of the Democratic party isn’t related to Barack &amp; Michelle dancing at Saturday’s concert? i think ppl can be frustrated w the state of the party AND disappointed that you’ve randomly linked it to a cute harmless concert moment...

@ChristineFox YES! it's his Franchesca pin lololol
@SimplyAwwchumm @CaseyNeistat i get wanting to be there for a friend, but i think that also includes holding them accountable when they fuck up. i think Casey did that to a degree but i think Logan has to accept that some ppl will never forgive him. that's life. &amp; pales in comparison to the harm he caused
@fetedujuliet that's very sweet of you to say! thank you!
@CaseyNeistat the beauty of social media is that it's removed the gate keepers &amp; given so many ppl the chance to tell their own stories &amp; connect w others. but it's also given ridiculous amounts of influence &amp; power to folks who're incredibly reckless bc fame has clouded their judgement
@CaseyNeistat one of the things i appreciate about you is you’re extremely thoughtful &amp; you don’t take your platform or influence for granted. i appreciate you wanting to believe that everyone has the capacity for that...but i still don’t see it for Logan. either way, i’m so sure he’ll be fine
@CaseyNeistat he still has an enormous fan base, huge home, expensive cars etc all of which he continues to flaunt &amp; boast about on his channel. to describe the backlash to HIM filming someone who took their life as him "losing it all" is...sir? how does he not see how backwards that is?
@CaseyNeistat logan &amp; his brother have built huge careers out of flaunting their privilege under the guise of "inspiring" others. for him to repeatedly suggest he "lost it all" bc of HIS BEHAVIOR is....comically embarrassing. the consequences have been mild. lost it all? some brand deals?
@CaseyNeistat arg. like everyone i have mixed feelings but i appreciate that you acknowledged how this interview could contribute to the attempted "redemption story" &amp; that you did push back a fair amount. i think a bigger convo about the problem w social influence/fame + privilege is needed

@doorsixteen honest to goodness truth? jealousy. it sounds basic but people who’re unhappy offline use the internet to feed that unhappiness &amp; it’s often in the form of following &amp; lashing out at someone who has what they want. social makes that incredibly easy.
@zblay it’s 2018. how do people not know this?
@Amazingblackfem ha! really? cause it makes certain folks so very very mad?
i don’t do a lot of branded content but when brands reach out their rates are based on how many followers you have per social platform. this is why i don’t share, follow or mention folks who i’m not interested in supporting financially. i encourage y’all do the same
also, following someone on social media just to troll them...is not smart. influencers make their living off their social following, including their followers &amp; engagement. higher following = higher rates. so. you’re putting dollars in folks pockets that you claim to “hate”

@JayHumphries10 there’s really no need to repeat what’s in the video but if you rewatch it explains how slurs uphold oppression, and “saltine” does not oppress anyone. there’s a difference between offensive and oppressive.
Hey Jay! the title of the #MTVDecoded episode is clearly, “Are white trash, red neck &amp; cracker racist?” it’s about the difference between classist &amp; racist slurs, both of which are harmful but not the same. hope that clears things up. thanks for sharing the ep, hope you watch it! https://t.co/q9dzZzCZDV

@matthiasclock @Sarah_White_77 the video is pretty clear.
@willijjCLE thanks! is shown in high schools and colleges all the time! a few people have been written term papers about the show! it’s also on MTV U which is the university version of MTV
while i’m very proud of #MTVDecoded it’s pretty basic. it’s 101. what does X mean? where did Y come from? why does Z make ppl uncomfortable? the fact that ppl project meaning onto things i’ve said &amp; often flat out LIE about the content...is telling.
@matthiasclock did you watch the episode?
i can always tell when an episode of #MTVDecoded is doing well because the angry “reverse racist” sock puppets come decend on social media. stay mad. season seven this fall! https://t.co/Tt8wzaFmya
@MysterMyke @meghantonjes sadly they prey on elderly, people who don’t speak english &amp; folks with finical troubles 😓
throwback #MTVDecoded is about “white pride” &amp; how it’s been used to oppress others. i didn’t say you can’t or shouldn’t have pride in who you are, but our identities don’t exist in a vacuum &amp; historical context matters. the ep you clearly didn’t watch: https://t.co/5sgC9kTuEW https://t.co/qPwceQzD9I
@DebbyRyan i’m sure it’s hard to have so many people critiquing a project you’re proud of &amp; have put a lot of work into. i get that &amp; have been there. you’re young &amp; clearly have a long career ahead of you, so i hope the feedback you’re getting helps you be more thoughtful about future gigs
@DebbyRyan the highlighted piece seems to suggest the show is meant to comment on how society is cruel to fat ppl which...we already know. but you’re participating in that cruelty bc you’re thin &amp; boiling down a characters happiness &amp; success to their being thin. so yea, people are upset
@DebbyRyan this...isn’t a good take. despite the good intentions this premise is rooted in a fat young woman being a lonely miserable virgin which...is shitty. her happiness is rooted in her being thin meanwhile there are lots of happy fat girls with lots of friends &amp; active sex lives
@lolacoaster “certified after” is a great show or book title...just sayin

semi-related, i couldn’t finish S-town because i found it so invasive and exploitative. wouldn’t ya know it, the family of John McLemore agrees and is now suing the creators https://t.co/bYbEh8ba4H
forget serial. forget the gross privacy violation known as s-town, season 2 of @InTheDarkAPM is the BEST investigative podcast OF ALL TIME. it’s a heartbreaking listen about our broken racist “justice” system but LORDT it’s such an important story #CurtisFlowers

@KarmaKatniss you’re certainly entitled to your opinion. still doesn’t change what i said. best of luck!
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa i think patience is a personal choice that folks have the right to make or not make.
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa not misinterpreted at all. it actually supports my point. “canceling” her didn’t have any real impact bc her audience doesn’t care. the same way charlamange’s doesn’t care &amp; sadly too many men &amp; women don’t see the issue with Angela’s comments. the label doesn’t do much
ok but how THE FUCK is an entire PREPARED statement waved away as “i misspoke?” https://t.co/LiM2RYSILZ
@IamKupa @TruthKills3 i said upthread i understand why people say/use it but i personally don’t have any interest in setting parameters for what makes someone qualify for being “cancelled” bc i see it as an arbitrary label that loses meaning w the internet news cycle
@IamKupa @TruthKills3 like i said, they go away &amp; return. Paula is back on tv, has a digital network, a successful cruise, restaurants &amp; cook books. sadly it’s rare to see any real consequences for racists, abusers and bigots. not that we shouldn’t seek them, but “cancelled” doesn’t seem to do it
@IamKupa @TruthKills3 that said, i understand ppl being frustrated and think that's totally fair. i'm disgusted by Charlamagne's behavior and have been for YEARS. he's been "cancelled" multiple times &amp; he still has a vibrant career. after Tomi, after Amara la Negra &amp; after joking about beating his gf
@IamKupa @TruthKills3 i just don't think it's possible to "cancel" anyone. i've yet to see anyone's career end after the internet proclaiming someone is cancelled. generally they go away for a bit and then come back ie. Paula Deen
@angryblkhoemo i wish straight people would stop
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa ah you’re so welcome &amp; thqte very nice of you to say. i feel very lucky to have so many ppl who support my work &amp; wanna chat. i really enjoy it 😊
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa and you’re welcome! thanks for wanting to engage &amp; ask tough questions! i don’t think there’s an easy answer. i don’t think abusers should be rewarded when so many non abusive creators never get a shot. i don’t think Angela should lose her job, i think she needs perspective
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa i think people who do good work can also say/do harmful things. i think Angela is super smart &amp; hardworking &amp; i appreciate how she uses her platform to spotlight important issues. i think this is a subject she’s not well suited for &amp; i hope she reflects &amp; hears the concerns
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa personally i think the concept of “cancelling” is silly. it literally does nothing. Angela won’t lose her job or face any consequences for co-signing Charlamagne and i doubt he’ll face any either. it’s basically a label that gets applied when someone disappoints folks.
RT @THATFATTYBITCH: MUSIC MAKE YOU LOSE CONTROL https://t.co/2eWiNZIoXf
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa i'd like to see a world where abusers are rehabilitated and work towards educating and supporting others but again, that requires them WANTING to do that work. and i don't think that's the job of the survivors. the programs exist, they have to seek them out.
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa in this instance, this person has not gone to prison, has shown no remorse and continues to profit off being a misogynist asshole. my tweet will not harm him in any way, meanwhile survivors are continuously pushed into silence seeing abusers like him succeed and be rewarded
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa i believe people can change. BUT lying about one's past indiscretions &amp; joking about them doesn't show any remorse or commitment to being better. as a survivor of sexual assault it's not my job to absolve or forgive abusers. i'm entitled to my feelings just as you are.
@TruthKills3 @IamKupa if i can chime in here, i think someone choosing to "move on" is their right but no one is owed forgiveness. especially if they haven't taken responsibility for what they've done or made any commitment to change or reconciliation
@bshanleyjr woop there it is
@Patch_ISoA honestly. i highly doubt it'll do anything.
@gunnarolla love you dude
@FeministaJones sure!
@thetrudz @FeministaJones amen
@FeministaJones @atrak i love how pleased he looks with himself. like “yea i DID THAT”
@iambiancafh amen. i think it’s important context bc people get so defensive when you ask them to be self reflective. if you can say “hey i’ve fucked up too” it hopefully makes it easier
@FeministaJones @PiaGlenn i think i read that she came forward bc it’s been hard seeing him everywhere &amp; not having closure. i can’t imagine how awful it would be to see my abuser being praised by so called allies on the daily

@R0zzyB0wden i mean...i don't think i need to explain to you there's a stigma associated with homosexuality that isn't associated with heterosexuality do i? you're comparing two things that aren't a 1:1
this is the last thing i’ll say, cause i’m not gonna argue with y’all. your INTENT doesn’t absolve your IMPACT. you didn’t mean to insinuate something harmful but you still did. try listening to the folks you claim you want to support instead of telling them what you meant.
@EusanMcclain https://t.co/1RUwrwkzQU
the problem is, when you use bigotry in place of critique, everyone else deals with the run off. it’s like starting a food fight &amp; thinking the ONE person you’re aiming at is the only one who’s gonna get dirty. naw.
again, i’ll call myself out here. i have made this mistake before. i’ve thrown around “those guys need to get laid” trying to defend myself from assholes, i’ve joked about the appearance of women i don’t agree with. it’s shitty &amp; i regret it. our words don’t exist in a vacuum.
if your “critique” relies on calling someone fat, saying a woman looks like a man, talking about penis size, insinuating someone is gay, ragging on someone for looking old....you’ve lost the plot. none of that matters when someone’s words, actions &amp; politics are harming people.
i see a lot of smart well meaning people throw their morals out the window to call out reprehensible folks &amp; it’s embarrassing. shit i’ve done it in the past &amp; im glad i got called on it. casual bigotry is not a short cut for critique.
lemme spell this out, when you associate being gay or gay sex acts with weakness THAT’S HOMOPHOBIC. you’re attempting to shame Trump by suggesting he’s doing something sexual w another man as if two men having sex is shameful. WORDS MEAN THINGS. PLEASE STOP.
@BrrrLaStrange i’m so sick of it
insinuating Trump is in a sexual relationship with Putin makes homosexuality a punchline &amp; is uncalled for. there’s SO MUCH to take Trump to task for, it’s embarrassing to see NYT stoop to “ha ha men kissing is yucky” https://t.co/PsUmLJWCks

@ssbarnet Forbes claims Kim &amp; Kylie have made butts and big lips “cool” the same things black women have been historically demonized and fetished for. appropriation is a multi layered issue that can’t be reduced to “flattery/imitation”

@ssbarnet stating facts about someone is not trolling. nor is commenting on how someone’s privilege impacted their success. i haven’t said anything about what she should or shouldn’t have done with her fame or wealth. but to call her “self made” is false

omg seeeew many typos! thank goodness Kim is prioritizing an edit button for twitter after she ends mass incarceration
please respect my privacy as i take a break from social media to think about how my tweets have negatively affected a "self made" billionaire who's never heard of me. the stans for opening my eyes. the perspective you have given me is worth a thousand kylie lip kits #ad
it was wrong of me "come for" a young woman who's sacrificed SO MUCH to chase her dreams of repackage colorpop lip gloss AND put full lips on the map. as a black woman stating facts is really aggressive and threatening to the status quo. i should know better.
unfortunately when i was a teenager i didn't have Kylie Jenner to look up to. full lips weren't "like a thing" before her. my parents did have Olympic medals, brand endorsements, experience managing online personalities or any experience negotiating licensing deals on sex tapes.
the lesson here is that if your parents have the connections to shop a reality show that launches when you're 10 so you're famous from childhood &amp; have very famous siblings, maybe you too can pull yourself up from your bootstraps &amp; start a company valued at billions #goals
i apologize for saying Kylie Jenner was "born into wealth &amp; fame" i totally ignored that she invested HER OWN 250k from modeling jobs she EARNED after using her reality tv checks to get plastic surgery to get modeling jobs &amp; brand endorsements to start her company #SelfMadeWomen
@MilaXX it's so weird that she has stans! i don't get it! i feel so old
@TatianaKing it's...so bizarre. what's weirder is the black people in my mentions calling me a hater and a flop because i gave the MILDEST of MILD takes on a click bait headline
@jessdontstop @Steve_Tha_Human must protect wealthy white women at all costs!
@boofsngoofs i don't have any problem with Kylie Jenner. her success isn't a result of being "self made" feminism doesn't mean thrusting unearned praise on another woman. Kylie Jenner has built a successful career, she was able to do so because she was born into wealth
@ZandiNokuthula Kris's version of "struggling" is still wealthy by average standards.
@__michaeljames yeah people are getting real defensive about acknowledging how her wealth lead to her success. it's so weird.
@__michaeljames what i mean is that talking about how she got to where she is won't literally remove her success.
@trellwest @LeshaRomeo @bycdl thank God Kylie has you to defend her honor &amp; billion dollar empire on twitter. so selfless. we're just bitter unsuccessful spinsters who'll never ascend to her "self made heights" your 24 year old wisdom knows no bounds! i quiver at the sight of your truth bombs in my mentions
@bycdl lips and butts didn't exist before them!!!
starting on 3rd base makes it real easy to get a home run. acknowledging that doesn't take away that person's success or wealth. i'll never understand why people on this app put on capes for folks who don't give a fuck about them. but go off i guess.
@sydneyfinchum @G_Martinez_13 well i'm not suggesting she's not intelligent or that strategy wasn't involved in her success. the only thing i said was that "self made" does not describe her journey
@sydneyfinchum @G_Martinez_13 i mean, i'm sure she works. but "self made" does not accurately describe her success.
@sydneyfinchum @G_Martinez_13 brand deals and modeling opportunities that she got because she comes from a famous family. she got modeling opportunities after changing her appearance with plastic surgery she was able to afford because she comes from a wealthy family.
@Steve_Tha_Human i mean...i'm not knocking her.
@G_Martinez_13 i mean good for her. but that’s not “self made” she had a huge leg up on the rest of the world. her success isn’t an anomaly it’s a given. it’s not hard to be successful when you have no risks &amp; endless capital to invest in any and everything
@jraff_dot_net @Ajani_Mnemonic i'd never heard it before, but i'm dedicated to making it part of my daily life
erm. being born into extreme wealth &amp; instant fame is the exact opposite of “self made” https://t.co/c9rZyx03Al

@robinthede packing cubes! they’re a GAME CHANGER
@MizzFitzie @brosandprose these are the convos that restore my faith in the internet &lt;3
@arachnophiliac MEATSPACE?!??! i'm dead
@SkyWilliams @brosandprose oh weird. she might use a blocklist? i know she's dealt with a lot of harassment and that's one thing that helps cut down on it. you might've gotten caught in the filter. sorry dude. here's the blog post: https://t.co/t7sy0sJoRx
@NiaColetta of course! i feel very fortunate for that. but sadly the internet isn’t just for us lol
@MizzFitzie i initially didn’t read it that way but i hear you. thx for being it up. hope @brosandprose takes a look &amp; reconsiders as well
@MizzFitzie i agree with you there. white people are often very hesitant to label something or someone as racist
@NiaColetta i’m 34, i’ve been online since i was in middle school. i’m proud of my content, my work is not the same as just running my mouth online lol
@ValerieComplex @toomuchtelly oh yea i remember the free college tuition. i said something about it on FB &amp; her stans came for me. to think she had stans 😓 and you’re right, little miss flint is doing something positive &amp; deserves support but...
@ValerieComplex @toomuchtelly OMG i forgot about “chewbacca mom” what a strange non talent to be known for!! she even had a show for a hot second. the internet is so weird
@NiaColetta it depends but i’d say a little of both? sharing personal details that were no one’s business that would come back to bite me in the ass, realizing i hurt ppl bc i shared something i shouldn’t have, using the internet as a therapist instead of getting a therapist
@toomuchtelly @ValerieComplex thanks for adding some perspective here! clearly it’s a convo more of us should be having
@MizzFitzie oh i agree. and that’s what she goes on to say. it’s a very powerful tool, but it’s one that can be abused. i think that’s what she’s asking the audience to consider https://t.co/uHOFkvhC3B
@MizzFitzie also that story is weird to look back on bc ppl built whole ass apps &amp; sites to track her flight. i remember following it &amp; getting a kick out of it at the time but looking back that was a lot of effort invested &amp; for what? Justine is now the head of another marketing firm.
@MizzFitzie well, i think she did a good job of explaining that call outs of racist behavior happen bc those communities so often don’t have a chance to be heard. she didn’t absolve Justine, but she points out that media latched on just to get clicks. they don’t care about anti-racism work
@margejacobsen oh no. i’m so sorry to hear that. the internet really brings the worst out of some people. i’ll never understand sending threats to a stranger over something they posted. just bizarre
@toomuchtelly @ValerieComplex i agree with you there. the article i shared this am digs into the issue of “public person” in a way i haven’t seen explored anywhere which i really appreciated. we’re living in different times now
i’m someone who loves to share online &amp; it’s been an important aid in my career but i CRINGE looking back at some things i’ve posted. 		my new general rule of thumb for social media is: would i be ok with my boss or my parents seeing this? if not. i skip it.
@toomuchtelly @ValerieComplex oh sure. she’s the product of a bigger issue. it’s been...not even a week? next week there’ll be a new story &amp; hopefully people will leave the girl at the center of this alone. my hope is that the convo about privacy continues which is what i’m trying to do myself
this is basic but i really discourage adding ppl on FB that you don’t actually know. they’re the first ones to say something sideways anyway &amp; you don’t need that drama in your life. the same way you’re cautious about who you let into you home, it’s ok to have boundaries online
so let’s talk about online safety/privacy cause many of ya’ll have no clue. 		first, google your phone number &amp; address. oh yea. it’s out there. most of the sites have a form you can fill out to get it taken down. do that now. 		second, check your privacy settings on Facebook
@jpbrammer aw! i get that. i turned off notifications on EVERYTHING cause that shit will kill your phone. sometimes it’d be so bad i couldn’t even use other apps bc one would just be going off
@IWriteAllDay_ we have to look out for each other!! you already know!
@toomuchtelly @ValerieComplex regardless, her intention doesn’t change the outcome of her actions. she hasn’t said anything since it went left &amp; she should. her followers were doxxing the girl in her mentions &amp; she was silent. she &amp; her boyfriend are adults &amp; she’s a blogger, she should know better
@toomuchtelly @ValerieComplex i mean....she encouraged her followers to find her even after the girl asked to not be named https://t.co/ZeGX60Zjl5
i’ve had a number of viral posts in the years since “shit white girls say...to black girls” so i always get the late night text/email when a friend goes viral to help them through it. it sounds silly but it’s no joke. this is a fairly new phenomenon &amp; average ppl have no clue
there’s really nothing that can prepare you for MILLIONS of people knowing who you are almost over night AND having an instant way to communicate with you. most of us who work online have safety measures in place NOW but only bc we learned the hard way w past viral hits
@SuperboffinLA she also encouraged her followers to find the girl AFTER she said she didn’t want any part of it. a complete disregard for her privacy and safety &amp; of course it resulted in her being harassed
sorry to keep harping on #planebae story but this whole thing irks me. i went viral in 2012 &amp; though it was something i wanted (aspiring actress/comic) it was SO scary &amp; i was completely unprepared. i can’t imagine how it would feel to go viral w/out my consent. i’m angry for her

@mai_treat @offbeatorbit i feel bad for her too. who knew being kind enough to switch your seat would lead to this mess? she’s smart to stay far away from this train wreck. of course Rosey has been very quiet since ppl realized how creepy this whole thing was

@yoda @goof @roseybeeme i think the average person has no idea how unruly &amp; awful the internet can be until they learn the hard way. i think she was chasing viral fame &amp; didn’t really weigh the risks. doesn’t negate the harm but the quest for fame makes ppl act foolish
@crissles no comment 🙃 https://t.co/uwLtJsnyAG
@yoda @goof @roseybeeme i think it’d be hard to enforce. i know a lot of gyms now have a no social policy bc folks film others to make fun &amp; people, but i’m not sure it wold be possible to discourage elsewhere.

@darkskintdaria @cynfinite go by yourself!! life is too short to skip out because you don’t have someone to travel with. the flights are always packed w ppl going to festival, you can meet people there or just enjoy by yourself. that’s how grown folks travel!
@cynfinite @darkskintdaria set some money aside so you can book a flight as soon as the dates are announced!

hey @roseybeeme the plane girl deleted her social after being harassed as a result of your lack of boundaries. winking at your audience a&amp; calling them "sneaky" enough to find her? sis. this isn't cute it's invasive &amp; irresponsible. she doesn't want to be famous. seriously. stop. https://t.co/5WUAIAsRNd
@lgbtkeisha you're welcome and happy early birthday! 20's are awesome
@lgbtkeisha i get that. but again, the tweet was about something unexpected about adulthood. your 30's are still 10 years away. a lot will happen in those 10 years. i'm 15 years older than you so we're in very different stages in our live ;)
@lgbtkeisha and thanks! yeah my point is things happen that are out of your control &amp; it isn't a bad reflection on you or your friends. you learn that w age. you're still young, you have lots of time &amp; awesome experiences ahead of you, i have no doubt you'll be more than fine &lt;3
@lgbtkeisha 20 certainly makes a difference. i'm 34 so some of my friends have kids, live across the country or in other parts of the world so of course our friendship isn't the same. similar with my unmarried friends who wanna party &amp; get wasted i still love them but we're in diff places
@the_music_freak @lgbtkeisha that's very sweet of you to say! thanks!
@lgbtkeisha don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with optimism! that love doesn't have to go away, but it may very well change. can i ask how old you are? teens, 20's &amp; 30's differ. i ask bc the tweet was about a lesson learned in adulthood, hence it went viral and resonated w so many.
@FeministaJones someone really needs to do this study. i’ve had run ins with a few of them &amp; it really doesn’t take much to set them off. they’re relentless &amp; many celebs encourage them via likes, DMs &amp; follows. they’ll do anything for their attention. nothing is too far.
@lgbtkeisha i mean...that's pretty optimistic but sadly not realistic. it doesn't mean the person used you or that things even ended badly. people grow apart and change. it's part of life and part of adulthood. you wont stay the same person forever and neither will your friends.

@greg70607 i’m not obligated to “try to get along” with anyone who seeks to uphold my or anyone else’s oppression, but you do you
@hannahwitton i like “distinguished guests”
@johannesgh90 no problem!
@johannesgh90 sure! i don’t disagree w you there. it’s a bigger convo that isn’t easily distilled in 140 characters. my main point was that “it’s just politics” ignores how politics shape our lives &amp; why they can difficult to put aside
@ScottRyanParks *sigh* and quite condescending. i hope he’s able to reflect and see where folks are coming from. this platform is a blessing and a curse 😭
@johannesgh90 sure not every political issue is a moral one. but if you support politicians who’re open about their bigotry then yes, we have very different moral values.
@PantsStatusZero @Kearns_SL did you look at the thread at all? i removed Stephen King &amp; was tweeting about politics hurting relationships and using a proverbial you. it’s really easy to do a quick google or scroll up before jumping in &amp; i feel like you often fail to do so
@PantsStatusZero my tweet wasn’t about Steven King’s politics, hence why he’s not included in the tweet. the proverbial you is a thing.
@plhutton @StephenKing hey Patty, welcome to twitter where Stephen has every right to make a suggestion and I have every right to respond as to why people were disappointed by it. no one suggested it was an order, being polite doesn't negate critique
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing i'm not sure how or why this turned into "are we demanding this from the left also?" which is a non sequitur. people should do what feels right for them but hugs don't mend political differences for anyone.
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing there are people who's views align on some things and don't on others. if reconciliation is going to take place REGARDLESS of their person's politics, it requires acknowledgement of the hurt caused. that's how reconciliation works.
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing gah there are lots of typos in there. the point is, my tweets said nothing about anyone being left or right or demanding anything from anyone. the point remains that people on ALL SIDES of the political spectrum are flawed &amp; have work to do. no one is perfect
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing "if we are demanding" and "are we demanding" &amp; "while not demanding" relies on the the premise is that something is being demanded. tacking a question mark at the end doesn't change the foundation of your question
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing i'm also not comfortable with this "demanding" cause...i haven't demanded anything of anyone. and couching it as "we demand" suggests otherwise. you should do whatever you feel ok with
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing um. ok. i don't believe anyone's flaws or bad politics should be ignored. i literally wrote an entire book copping to my mistakes &amp; why we should be more transparent about them in order to encourage others to do the same sooo...
@Dialoguealways @EarlAilsa @StephenKing sorry, i'm confused by this reply. demanding nothing of our own? are you speaking generally here or something specific? i'm not sure how this applies
it can be really difficult &amp; painful to cut ties with ppl you love &amp; care about because of their politics. i get that. if you're not ready or you think you can influence them go for it. but respect that many of us have no interest in that emotional labor bc it's a waste of time
we've now seen hundreds of think pieces and profiles of Trump supporters who've continued to double down &amp; say point blank they do not regret their vote or care about the consequences of their vote. hugging them is not gonna change that.
can people change? sure! but ppl have to WANT to change. that change also requires acknowledging how their actions (ie. their politics) have hurt others. &amp; it's not the job of marginalized people to hold hands w ppl upholding their oppression &amp; beg them to see them as human
the people who're dealing with the consequences of your politics are allowed to feel pain, anger, fear &amp; hurt. it's not unreasonable that your relationship might suffer as a result of the hurt YOU have directly caused/endorsed/ignored via those politics
there's a lot of talk about how politics "shouldn't end relationships" which...just isn't realistic. political differences aren't just differences of opinions, we're talking about moral values &amp; those absolutely influence who we build &amp; continue relationships with
@EarlAilsa @StephenKing reconciliation still requires work. that means taking responsibility for the hurt one's caused and committing to change. a hug is a great way to show someone you care for them but it doesn't replace the work needed to reconcile that hurt.
@StephenKing Trump is very deliberately manipulating his base by playing to their fears &amp; bigotry which has real consequences. I don't doubt Russia played a role in the election but it's complicated &amp; will take a lot of work to fix. thankfully ppl are doing that work, let's not minimize that
@StephenKing reducing pain associated w hateful policies &amp; bigotry to "grudges" &amp; "talking points" is unfair &amp; shows your privilege. i agree it's important to build bridges w folks but they have to WANT to do that work. finally, *hugs* don't end oppression &amp; shouldn't be the job of oppressed
@doctorjasun @AngryBlackLady right. and the fact that she's avoiding the spotlight and they're reveling in it is extra gross.
@kitschmama amen to that.
@doctorjasun @AngryBlackLady right? and of course he gets the glory and she gets the scorn. it's so gross
@MySpcialPurpose no, they're enjoying the spotlight. the woman who was the subject of the story on the other hand has been harassed off social media
@BetseyLindor87 i saw she was angling for a job at buzzfeed? just. girl stop. and of course the guy is loving it too. it should be a huge red flag that the woman doesn't wanna participate
@CeceDawn23 side note, that little cat thing is so scary. i hate him.
@BetseyLindor87 they were also on the Today show. the girl is an aspiring actress and blogger, so she no doubt sees this as an opportunity for her but it's a weird thing to be "known" for. she didn't actually do anything noteworthy or that shows her talents
@LopensCousin yeah i think the world is so awful these days people were excited for a seemingly happy love story. i get that. but it went way too far

@LetsCryBaby @SireLeoLamar you right
@theaprilweasley @demisaysstuff that thread went on FOREVER.
@venessarenee @delafro_ meanwhile she’s blocking anyone that calls her on it https://t.co/YXREVpFyVH
@SireLeoLamar also the pressure to then “make it work” would be overwhelming. i mean, we see how often reality show relationships work out 😬 i think she thought it was cute but saw the viral potential &amp; ran w it once it took off.
@LetsCryBaby @SireLeoLamar he followed her &amp; that’s how her insta got out. there are screen shots of it. point is, multiple people made bad decisions regarding someone else’s right to privacy &amp; the internet is trash sooo
@jennifertetteh i feel so bad for her. i can only imagine what her inbox looks like. meanwhile the dude is posting shirtless photos &amp; enjoying the spotlight &amp; the woman behind the thread is fishing for jobs? it’s bizarre
@SireLeoLamar right?? they always find a way. i believe the girl behind the thread posted her insta then deleted but by then it was too late 😓
moral of the story: the internet can be awful to folks who seek the spotlight &amp; far worse to those that don’t. respect the privacy of others, it may seem harmless but not everything needs to be online. &amp; once it’s out there...you can’t take it back.
update: the woman from the plane deleted her social media after being doxxed/harassed. the viral thread suggested they had sex in the bathroom so of course she gets shamed &amp; he gets the praise? uuugh https://t.co/BtMijJGmBO
@Chelsea_Fagan the girl deleted her social media after being harassed 😓 womp
@TheHipsterRebbe well, there’s also a difference btwn a misunderstanding btwn two ppl who’re talking &amp; hopping in the DMs of a stranger bc they critiqued your work. i think celebs should avoid that. i was talking about folks that know each other &amp; how 140 characters &amp; audience complicates things

@styleethic @BrandenLee1 @roseybeeme thanks for being open to having it!
@styleethic @BrandenLee1 @roseybeeme right. but once you share online it’s out of your hands &amp; the consequences are a direct result of your actions even though unintentional. i’d feel similarly regardless. i’ve seen the downsides of regular ppl going viral &amp; becoming memes without their consent. it’s worrisome
@BrandenLee1 @styleethic @roseybeeme yea and she asked after she’d been posting &amp; speculating over an extended amount of time. even without ID that’s still invasive. i think it speaks to a greater trend of ppl posting others online without permission that makes me uncomfortable even if the outcome is “positive”
@BrandenLee1 @UKrazyFan yea he’s running with it. it really kills what little romantic angle of the story there was to begin with. dude has headshots &amp; made his own hashtag &amp; she’s hiding out. sheesh
@UKrazyFan this is another angle i nearly forgot https://t.co/eojqEaT47A
@BrandenLee1 @styleethic @roseybeeme ah i forgot that happened. yikes
@UKrazyFan that’s ok! you’re certainly allowed to disagree.
@UKrazyFan the irony is that i wouldn’t have a commentary on her behavior if she hadn’t shared online. and no she’s not being demonized, i don’t know anything about her or her character. i think filming someone without their permission is creepy she could very well be a nice person i dunno
@UKrazyFan i will say it’s ironic to call responding to her choosing to post someone’s private interaction online without their permission “demonizing”
@UKrazyFan of course she didn’t anticipate it happening. that doesn’t negate the consequences of her actions. my point is that people are being lax with the privacy of others which is both creepy &amp; can have unforeseen consequences
@My_Moment95 @hotincleveland @Chelsea_Fagan right. she’s a private person who became a public spectacle without her permission which is what bothers me. even without her name exposed, her friends &amp; fam now know about it &amp; maybe she doesn’t want that? it’s all very weird
@UKrazyFan apparently she was doxxed &amp; has left social media. it’s cool if you enjoyed it, clearly lots of people did. i do think there’s something to be said for how many ppl don’t think of stranger’s privacy anymore. viral fame is unruly &amp; most aren’t prepared esp if they didn’t volunteer
@hotincleveland @My_Moment95 @Chelsea_Fagan ugh. that sucks. last i saw there were over 38k RT on the thread which means some weirdos were bound to latch on
yup. like. you bought wifi to be a creep? wyd? https://t.co/uJMQuA992u
@Chelsea_Fagan and get a morning talk show appearance out of it. oof

@ChristineFox_ @ReignOfApril i just CACKLED
@ellenspertus thank you!!
@kitkade aw don't do that to yourself! i highly doubt that'll be an issue for you BUT a friendship lasting for a season doesn't lesson it's meaningfulness. some ppl grow apart but they can reconnect later in life
@soulsike thank you!!
@RageOnThePage and that's one of the major flaws of social media. there's only so much you can convey online, especially when the whole world wide web can jump in and muddy the waters
@RageOnThePage it was clear she was coming from a place of hurt but oof. it's like twitter has removed folk's ability to pick up the phone, send an email or text. everything doesn't need to be everyone's business.
@RageOnThePage the doubling down was embarrassing. i hope someone slid in her DMs
@sassyblackdiva @KadijahChloee HA! omg Fil LOOOOOVES fresh laundry
@RageOnThePage yup. i saw it happen a few times with a few different people this week
some friendships are only meant for a season. history between two people doesn’t guarantee longevity. https://t.co/NiPeSucLSI
@sassyblackdiva @KadijahChloee aw! that’s too funny. my dogs LOVE rolling around &amp; digging in the rug like they’re in the yard. it’s adorable &amp; annoying.
@sassyblackdiva @KadijahChloee not to mention i have dogs, so rugs have MAYBE a 2 year life span in my house cause they show love through destruction.
@KadijahChloee fucking RUGS!
@SekaiFarai aaaaah, i see what you mean. and yes, you're right too often people are more concerned with "winning" than coming to a place of understanding. it's all very performative &amp; i regret that i've fallen victim to it myself in the past
@SekaiFarai @gio_logie eh. i'm not sure i agree that a DM is a "white flag" but even so, why would that be unfortunate?
@amahnke lol "podcast voice" is so weird because...you host a podcast!!
hey dudes that are on tv, do you ever get unsolicited emails about how you should or shouldn’t speak? asking for myself. https://t.co/q4yn1uvLTJ
so many misunderstandings #onhere could be avoided if you slid into someone’s DM’s and hammered it out without an audience
@anomalyalice he’s getting all the cuddles!
@ElletheBellexo aw! hey boo! i’m cuddling Fil and will send him some Winnie love
@JShahryar ha! a perpetually drunk and unbothered uncle?
thankfully @tieoptional is here to take care of Fil &amp; make fun of me which Fil appreciates bc he doesn’t really see it for me https://t.co/lNH8p2W8eQ

@JasonFarrJokes thanks for taking the time to read it!
@CooperRico thank you!
@scorchtheground @IWriteAllDay_ @dancingofpens it hasn’t worked for her though. Ghost in the Shell flopped.
@avalily_ @terrycrews her definition is incorrect. i included a link in the above thread that explains the difference, i encourage you to read it!
@Ocasio2018 @baratunde you. are. everything. keep kicking ass and raising hell
@Derrick19146764 @Teelou40 @NicoH715 actually that’s not true.
@avalily_ @terrycrews “transracial” refers to someone who’s adopted by someone of another race.
@IbleedFish “Oscar bait” refers to films that are obviously angling for an Oscar because they’re extremely high stakes, dramatic, giant production and/or require the actor to undergo major change ie. weight loss, makeup
@TMNox @crissles her response was SO defensive.
@librozuela it’s fantastic
@SireLeoLamar ah thank you!
@Amariedesigner *sigh* she’s doing a movie where she plays a trans man 😑
@MemphisTapWater ah! sorry longest day ever, my brain is foggy 😂 thank you! i hope he listens too!
@dancingofpens @IWriteAllDay_ i think it proves she doesn’t care about trans folks but it’ll gain her points with ignorant cis folks for being “soooo brave”
@MemphisTapWater i’m not sure what this means?
@IWriteAllDay_ @dancingofpens hence the quotation marks. i have a feeling she’s gonna frame this as “everyone keeps ganging up on me” when she could just...pick one of the COUNTLESS roles written for cis white women
ScarJo news is a great time to remind you to watch/support #PoseFX! Amazing storytelling &amp; trans talent behind &amp; in front of the camera! How cool to let  ppl tell their OWN stories instead of making hacky Oscar bait that speaks over the community you’re pretending to care about! https://t.co/NmGxnIzENZ
@dancingofpens @IWriteAllDay_ what’s worse is Scarlett is at a place in her career where she doesn’t have to fight for parts. i doubt she’s pounding the pavement for auditions, she just gets offers. this is purely an Oscar bait grab under the guise of “wokeness”
@IWriteAllDay_ is she suggesting no one was disappointed with those casting choices? this feels needlessly aggressive

@ScottieBeam um. THIS. coming from YOU?! puuuuleaze
when it’s cold in the office but you’re determined to teach everyone how to do the *sexy sip* 		yes i turned my locs into a neck scarf. be jealous. https://t.co/vcCLw8Dtcn
@KristineAz that's....not what i'm saying at all? i'm not sure why you're putting words in my mouth, but that's my cue to move on. best of luck.
@AlHendiify you're so welcome!
@promener i know how exhausting that can be. perfection just isn't possible. the best you can do is try and be willing to step back and do the work to move forward when you screw up. hang in there! &lt;3
@KristineAz um. sure? but...this is kind of a moot point bc this isn't about tone policing.
@thejournalista oh i can only imagine. i've had a taste of it myself and i know it's hard. i hope he has someone offline who can give him some much needed perspective
@ParkerMolloy @terrycrews  https://t.co/HJOEKlEcxW
@truestorydesu ha! um. i wanna say yes i reeeeally do, but i don't think they're gonna cut it.
my advice is to build that circle now. BEFORE you screw up. (don’t worry it’ll happen soon enough lol) make sure you don’t lean on those ppl only when something goes wrong, you don’t wanna take advantage. &amp; when they do check you try to step back, listen &amp; then thank them.
you need a circle of people who you can turn to OFFLINE or at least away from the public social feed to get a temperature check. these are people who keep it real with you no matter what &amp; won't be afraid to say "yes, you did screw up"
the thing that's been helpful for me is to have a network of folks i can trust to be my gut check when/if i get called out. when the internet descends on you (which...sometimes you deserve) it can be nearly impossible to see the forrest from the trees. did i really screw up???
"i didn't know X was offensive!" or "i just asked a question" doesn't erase the harm and for most people that's very difficult to accept. most of us don't want to hurt people on purpose but...here we are. it happens. we screw up. even those of us who work to educate ourselves
if there's one thing i've learned throughout the course of my career is that it's REALLY HARD to admit that you don't know something &amp; then to own how that then led to you hurting someone. we so often get caught up in the intent
@terrycrews point being, no one is perfect &amp; it’s ok acknowledge what we don’t know &amp; that we always have room to improve/grow on certain issues. thx again for the work you’re doing. despite the pushback there are many survivors (myself included) that appreciate it 🙌🏾
@terrycrews i wrote about this a few years ago using a video by @kat_blaque that might help give you more clarity. i hope you take the time to watch it. Kat is black &amp; trans &amp; does a great job of explaining “changing race vs changing gender” https://t.co/faNjk2aNFj
@thejournalista yea i think he’s so great, when i heard about that post it made me sad. i hope he’s down to listen
@terrycrews so many of us are inspired by the wk you’re doing for sexual assault. it’s disappointing to see you get pushback for your bravery. but important to listen to members of the trans community to understand why conflating race &amp; gender is harmful. intent doesn’t change the impact.
@ReignOfApril aw agreed. thanks love.		yeah, i've MAJORLY stepped back. i don't interact with bullshit but every once in awhile i make the mistake &amp; gravely regret it. lesson learned. i'm mostly here for giggles and nothing else.
@Keah_Maria thanks love, it means a lot
@Keah_Maria beyond. i really don’t talk about it bc it often makes it worse. but it’s fine. i’m sadly used to it. thanks for the care &amp; concern, it means a lot
@Keah_Maria apparently never.
social media was a mistake https://t.co/LXRiMhNVhH

@HilarieAshton you’re so welcome! it’s really fun and calming
ps. you can also search pinterest for “brush lettering templates” if you want a free alternative to purchasing a guide book. you also don’t need fancy pens, crayola markers or ballpoint pens work just fine. you can easily fake the brush look/style https://t.co/2poMS2fTB5
