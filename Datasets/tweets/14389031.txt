@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias 6) do you honestly think someone working in a minimum wage job is just riding your coat tails? It's the shittiest jobs out there, for literally the lowest legal pay, dealing with pricks like you and me asking for coffee and then pissing on them when prices go up a nickel.
@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias 5) your "laziness" comment is probably the craziest of all your comments. Someone who busts their ass 40 hours a week for the lowest possible pay is lazy? It's like you took a misplaced welfare argument and puked it into minimum wage.
@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias 4) if you think trying to raise the minimum wage to an almost liveable amount is what communism is, I don't know what to say. My brain slightly hemorrhaged reading that.
@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias Your quip about if you want equality move to N Korea is almost not worth replying to. However, nobody wants equality in this case, they want a floor. A floor to start building, so maybe they can even create a "hustle". In Canada, we take care of each other, so we can..take care.
@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias 2) Companies traditionally used minimum wage and part time people to fill the gaps, but now rely more on 2-3 part timers at minimum wage with no benefits versus 1 FT employee with benefits due to savings. Meaning the part timers have to go out and find another part time job.
@earn905 @autoblot @ChrisPaulFarias 1) They are actually not. Minimum wage is exactly that, the minimum wage someone in our country/province should earn to keep them above poverty. About half are adults.
