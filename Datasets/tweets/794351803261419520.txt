@cnnrjcbsn @jamescgibson I think it’s more likely that attempts at georgism have failed more due to the influence of landlords, real estate interests, and homeowner culture. And I’m the United States, an abundance of cheap land that acts as a relief valve so things don’t boil over

@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth If you had the power, would you expand or reduce conservation subsidies? And why
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth Also, I don’t think she was claiming that conservation subsidies were the main culprit behind corruption in the ag market, but she was using them to highlight a particularly extreme example (holding water hostage), which I understand you dispute, but still
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth I mean, I take your point on the small scale of the conservation subsidies, but I still don’t quite understand how they are preferable to market forces working around regulation.
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth I read the thread as an example of how landowners rent seek through ag subsidies when in reality they would go out of business If subject to the actual market conditions
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth What do you mean by the stabilizing effects?
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth I actually don’t have opinions on farming, I’m still very open to you being correct. I’m just asking questions so I can understand completely.
@PNWwonk @Mark_Wadsworth If the land isn’t sustainably farmable without the manure lagoons, wouldn’t it be better to just directly ban farming on the land in question instead of subsidizing?

@BoyGeorgist I think my view is that we ~are~ one big society and nation states really are just fancy ways of dividing up people into those with rights and those without on part-racist, part-classist, and part-arbitrary criteria
@BoyGeorgist I’m not trying to say they are legally the same, I’m just asking the moral difference
@BoyGeorgist okay then we should just give people citizenship at the border and stop restricting people’s freedom of movement. Why shouldn’t there be a fundamental right to live and work as you please? See what I’m getting at? Don’t really care about the process arguments
@BoyGeorgist My point is the ~laws~ are bad and should be changed. I don’t think antifa should have the legal authority to do what they do and neither should ice.
@BoyGeorgist So if we authorized the police to raid and terrify the homes of wealthy people conservatives would be cool with that? If it were legal?
I don’t think I will ever understand how conservatives can get so worked up about antifa stuff but be totally ok with ICE. How do you think it’s justified to snatch people from their homes just becuase they were not born here? How does that gel with individual liberty?
@WintSaltonstall It only shifts land use and consumption if it replaces another tax like income, which would be redistributive
@WintSaltonstall Taking land rents from private hands and spending them publicly literally in anyway would be redistributive. The only way it wouldn’t be is if they just burned it all as they collected it.
@WintSaltonstall I mean, the appeal is that land rents, currently in private control, are made public to improve people’s lives. Don’t really get the appeal if public rents aren’t used that way
@WintSaltonstall I don’t disagree that people can come from the right, I just don’t think there is a very established right (or left) tradition people practice in.
@WintSaltonstall They had influence and consistently chose not to make LVT an issue. I think Buckley even commented how he gave up talking about it bc it alienated him from his colleagues. Also he was a huge racist and a stain on the country
@WintSaltonstall Buckley and Friedman saying one kinda nice thing about georgism once is hardly enough to establish their own school of thought. Especially given how committed they were to fighting against any kind of redistributative politics.

@jjay75j @Noahpinion How do you know that rights come from cultures and not the other way around
@jjay75j @Noahpinion 1) I am not acknowledging I can never have enough information to claim what they are 		2) just because something is based on a “cultural structure” - whatever that means - does not mean it cannot be morally correct.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion No, it means that someone was wrong about what natural rights actually are. Differences in opinion over what natural rights are is not evidence that they don’t exist.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion I think the thing palatable to socialists would be the ability for people to not starve and afford housing. The right to economic dignity.		And “every other component” doesn’t mean much when they don’t accept the necessary component to make it all work.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion And the whole point of natural rights is that they’re completely stable and universal, at all times. Any time they are not upheld it is an issue if man made failure, not becuase the rights themselves are “unstable”.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion I think that depends on believing that “the left” is actually the left. And I think it’s naive to think that georgism is palatable to most on the right, if you’re trying to imply georgism is on the right, which apparently you’re not
@jjay75j @Noahpinion And also georgists can absolutely believe in natural rights, but we just extend natural rights to equal rights to land
@jjay75j @Noahpinion If they’re inclined to agree, then they wouldn’t be “right libertarians” who in all real world examples defend land privilege to the death, and in no practical way advance an agenda that would socialize land rents
@jjay75j @Noahpinion I’ll be waiting for the endorsement of the rothbardians breathlessly
@jjay75j @Noahpinion Ask some right wing libertarians about that
@jjay75j @Noahpinion lol no I responded to you becuase you are one of many georgists I’ve come across who really wants it to be viewed as right wing. Just think it’s a bit silly
@jjay75j @Noahpinion I’m aware of how it’s generally viewed
@jjay75j @Noahpinion I don’t really mind how it’s framed, as long as the effect is the same
@jjay75j @Noahpinion So in other words, not a standard right-libertarian defense of property rights. Dare I say, a left-libertarian interpretation of property rights. 		I don’t know why georgists are so eager to be seen as right wing when they don’t have to be
@jjay75j @Noahpinion People like to own land *becuase* of the rent seeking, not in spite of it. If you take that part way landowners are not going to give you a pass becuase technicality they still “own” the land.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion Georgists should just recognize this and embrace it instead of trying to thread some needle no one really cares about to come across as moderate or not on the left.
@jjay75j @Noahpinion Making it effectively the same as communal ownership of land with a system of leasing it out to private interests. I’m sure private landowners will see it as a fundamental attack on their property “rights”.

@Noahpinion Don’t really like the framing of georgism as “moderate and technocratic”. A small LVT would be for sure, but the end goal is always the abolishion of private land ownership/equal rights to land. Most people would consider that radical.
@geoliberal @bufordsharkley @ctbeiser @devonzuegel @vgr Now there is a question over the morality of a georgist state free trading with a non-georgist state, comparable to a non-slave state trading with nations who still have slaves. But there’s no reason to single out immigration in that discussion.
@geoliberal @bufordsharkley @ctbeiser @devonzuegel @vgr Immigration laws are just labor quotas under a different name. It’s a free trade issue and there is no good reason to make labor an exception to George’s free trade justifications and theories. George’s prejudices blinded him to his own logic.

I feel the the land value tax is too technocratic to ever lead a successful georgist movement and instead georgists should focus on making a strictly moral case for the full collectivization of land rents. No one advocated for a slave value tax, they advocated for abolition

@Anarchyball @bufordsharkley @julius_sky @smugumin But you didn’t you just bought it from another person who stole it from the native Americans, who presumably stole it from first person who stepped foot in North America, who by being the first one to settle in North America made the entire continent his property
@Anarchyball @bufordsharkley @julius_sky @smugumin Well then actually you don’t have a right to that land because it was already settled when you got there

@electjohnmoser @GeolibGeorge @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Appeals to authority are pretty weak arguments. most economists haven't heard of Georgism I'm willing to bet. Doesn't mean they have a logical argument against it.
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma of course, but again, for simplicity's sake. The reinvested money is just reinvested dividends. Shareholders just agree upfront that management can control how dividends get paid out and what goes back in
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama if the rent/wage-profit ratio of the income you plan on taxing comes down heavy on the wage-profit side, the costs will just get spit out somewhere else. I wouldn't be so quick to dismissing rent appraisal as impractical because its inconvenient.
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma then the remaining profit after the executive wage is economic interest for the investors, which like we agree, is only superficially different than wages. I was assuming sole proprietorship for simplicity's sake
@electjohnmoser @bufordsharkley @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Have you read progress and poverty? Seems a bit arrogant to say you understand a philosophy more than its adherents
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma profit is derived from the effort of organizing the things you call "the cost of labor". profit is the wage of the businessman, who had to put in real, human, individual, effort to run a business. The difference between wages and profit is superficial.
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Just because we don't appraise land rents now doesn't mean we couldn't develop a way in the future. And even if we couldn't, it would still mean that the public is being robbed of the value it creates by existing.
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama well no, in a georgist model, the rent paid to the land owner (or the subsidy paid to the landowner/businessman by society) would be publicly captured to fund government. it comes back to the public. The fact that it doesn't now is the theft I'm talking about.
@mattyglesias (please)
@mattyglesias Talk more about land value taxes, Matt!
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama We compute the value of property for property taxes, same process but for land. or auction the land off on the market to highest bidder. The whole idea is that they go out of business because they are being artificially propped up through systemic theft from the public
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma profit is legitimate income by definition and rent is illegitimate income by definition. Profit is derived form accumulated capital, which is derived from labor/effort, which makes it legitimate. rent is the private capturing of value that is created by society
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama No, not at all. The value of the land is not based on the income of who uses it currently. its the value given to it by the person who use it the best (make the most income). Inefficient landowners would have to use more efficiently or lose the land
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma don't worry about it, twitter isn't the best format to have these conversations in
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama @Soma I agree income taxes can capture rent, but its messy. Legitimate profit can get swept up in it and it could fail to capture the entirety of the illegitimate income
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama I agree that there are other kinds of econ rent, and they should be publicly captured, thats not a good reason to not support an LVT either. You can use it to fund public services or whatever, but it needs to be captured by the public
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama I won't claim to know if a full LVT(or equivalent socialization) will be enough to pay for all government expenditures, it should be enough to significantly reduce income and property taxes, legal questions aside. We already appraise for property taxes, do the same but 4land
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama I feel that we agree on where wealth is derived from (labor/human effort), I just don't think that you understand how privately captured land rents skim off the top of that wealth unjustly
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama I agree people give things value, and value not physically inherent, but that doesn't really matter
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Georgism is not Marxism, and the value of land isn't arbitrarily determined! Rents are payed to landlords everywhere, in direct amounts. Society should capture that value rather than an individual who no inherent right to something that exists regardless of human effort.
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama The "value" of something is how much someone would be willing to pay for it. How does value not exist? Gold has value because people want it and will pay for it
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Mining gold is fine, but charging rent to a company to mine gold on land I privately own is bad (if I privately pocket the money). The land and gold exist regardless of human effort
@electjohnmoser @MattBruenig @ericries @sama Both can be true, though. The wealth created by labor and capital is legitimate. The economic rents taken through private ownership of location is not. Society creates that value

@agustinlouro The government can still protect those areas in the same way they do now, it would probably even make that process easier.
@agustinlouro Dvlprs  won't build in ag areas unless there is demand, in which case not building would cause shortage. Shortage = homelessness/ poverty
@agustinlouro That land is inherently valueless for traditional dvlprs, the tax burden would be low/payable for farmers who use the land efficiently.
@agustinlouro Urban sprawl would be put in check without a tradeoff with poverty and homelessness (unlike other solutions).
@agustinlouro Actually, it does the opposite. It encourages dvlprs to build up rather than out. current land use is inefficient and needs to be urbanized

@acebb20 @seanmdav Well it should be easy to clarify then. I'll give credit where credit is due if they come out with a better denial.
@JermaineLogan5 @seanmdav that depends on what the definition of "it" is. If he didn't do it he could easily say "I did not share any classified info". Bet he won't
@acebb20 @seanmdav "as reported". That means they can just find some minor detail that maybe wasn't fully accurate and still say they didn't lie

@kgtornquist @seanmdav The man is deranged. I'm glad it's getting reported on like this.
@kgtornquist @seanmdav and if WaPo revealed all of their sources - how many leakers are there, like 10? - they'd be conviently purged which is I'm sure what u want
@kgtornquist @seanmdav So if WaPo has it, they should release it regardless of the consequences? That's your position?
@kgtornquist @seanmdav Well if I knew, you would be somewhere else on the internet ranting on about how the WaPo revealed classified info unecessarily. Bro.
@kgtornquist @seanmdav There are other aspects of classified info that don't have to do with sources or methods.
@TheAmazingBriz @seanmdav "As reported" is false. That's a lot of wiggle room. You must see how carefully worded these statements are
