@POTUS is proposing a solution that should bring ALL sides to the conversation. By not playing political games, President Trump is working to make a deal that will provide resources that are desperately needed and reopen the government.
As you can see, our President is willing to come to the negotiating table with an offer that has received bi-partisan support. 		https://t.co/q6xceKOrZW
4. It also allocates $800 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, 2,750 new border agents and law enforcement professionals, and 75 new immigration judges to reduce an immense backlog of asylum requests.
His offer includes: 	1. A three year extension of protections for DACA recipients 		2. $5.7 billion for a barrier at our southern #border 		3. Protections for 300,000 TPS recipients
President @realDonaldTrump has offered a comprehensive solution to address both border security and the partial government #shutdown.

November is #NationalAdoptionMonth. Every child needs, and deserves, a family that will nurture, support, encourage, and -most importantly- love them. In 2016 117,794 children were waiting to be adopted in the U.S. Over 500 children in SC are waiting for their forever homes.

As you can see, tremendous economic growth is being brought to America through pro-growth policies (like lifting burdensome regulations and tax cuts). This momentum is leading to higher wages, more productivity, and greater opportunities.
90% of Americans will see bigger paychecks because of the new tax cuts.
86% of manufacturers reporting they‚Äôve made plans to increase investments thanks to #taxreform.
67% of Americans agree now is a good time to find a quality job.

This is a great opportunity we see in front of us, as President Trump has promised to nominate someone who is committed to upholding our Constitution, yet again. I trust he will do just that, and urge the Senate to act quickly on the confirmation of the nominee.
Americans do not want judges who "legislate from the bench." Rather, we simply seek fair and impartial judges who will rule according to an intellectually honest, historically accurate, and unbiased interpretation of our Constitution. That's it!
Justice Kennedy announced his retirement after serving on the bench of the #SupremeCourt for more than 30 years this week. I thank him for his service to our nation.		I am very optimistic about his replacement that @POTUS will soon nominate.

The fact that Congressman Steve Scalise was shot, &amp; nearly killed, a yr ago for being a Republican, while playing baseball, is exactly why these comments are so dangerous. What does this say about our country? This only exacerbates the issue, &amp; deepens our political divide.

This kind of reckless behavior must be condemned and those who openly advocate for the harassment of people with differing viewpoints must be held accountable.
Encouraging and inciting violence is never the answer. The recent rhetoric coming from Rep. Maxine Waters, and the left, is fueled with hatred, dangerous, and downright unacceptable.

Although those two issues do not go hand in hand, I believe Congress can find the appropriate solution. 		This week the House plans to vote on two immigration bills, one of which will include a provision ending the family separation policy. I plan on supporting both bills.

By requiring the heads of the agencies to report their travel, those in power will be held accountable for how they utilize taxpayer dollars, encouraging them to do so efficiently and not abuse their position by going on luxurious trips.

No private organization should be given taxpayer $$$ to use. The Asia Foundation was founded in 1954, and functioned prior to receiving funds from the federal government.This is just another example of how Washington has developed the awful habit of throwing money down the drain.
In FY 2017, the Asia Foundation‚Äôs budget was $100 million dollars. $83 million came from the private sector, and $17 million came from taxpayers. If this private, non-profit organization can raise $83 million, then why must taxpayers foot an extra $17 million? That is ludicrous.

This is not a matter of national concern worthy of hundreds of thousands of dollars. NSF should allocate its grant funds to research that will benefit everyday Americans.		The American people deserve better.

We must get the AFTERR Appropriations Act to @POTUS' desk ASAP to help rein in this reckless spending.

Our budget process is broken. That's why I have introduced H.R. 5442, A Fast-Tracked Executive Rescission Review (AFTERR) of Appropriations Act. By creating an expedited process for WH recission requests, Congress would be forced to justify their most egregious pet projects.

Unreasonably high tariffs are bad policy. Plain and simple. #TariffTantrum
These unreasonably high tariffs that will be implemented on steel and aluminum products may sound like a good idea, but in reality, the burden of these tariffs will passed on to the American consumer.
Just the mere announcement of imposing high tariffs on materials we use every day has had an impact on the stock market - Dow Jones has fallen 500 pts. This has a far greater impact on trade overall, whether it be on farmers, automobile makers, or manufacturers.

In the original bill @HouseGOP passed, there was not a single item Democrats opposed. Today‚Äôs vote was virtually identical to the vote that the Democrat fear mongers and naysayers opposed.
#SchumerShutdown was completely needless &amp; reckless. For 3 days, Senate Democrats tried to bargain on behalf of an amnesty program for illegal immigrants, but in the end all they did was sacrifice the well-being of our troops and threatened health care for 9 million children.
Today, Democrats were totally called on their bluff. They finally came to their senses and ended the #SchumerShutdown.

We will continue to provide the services that are required by our constituents and encourage them to contact one of our offices if they need anything.
Over the next few days, and for however long the government is shut down, my offices in DC and in the 5th District will remain open and fully functioning. Each member of my dedicated staff has agreed to work their normal hours without pay throughout the shutdown.
The fact is, there was not a single item in the spending bill that passed the House that the Democrats oppose. It is unconscionable that Democrats are holding the constituents of the 5th District who rely on vital government services hostage for the sake of political posturing.
The Democrats are so blinded by their hatred for our President that they turned their backs on funding the government, paying our troops, and extended health insurance programs that cover nearly 9 million children nationwide - all policies that Democrats have supported.
Late last night, the Democrats succeeded with their plan to force the #SchumerShutdown. They are 100% responsible for this shutdown of government services. Only 6 Democrats in the House and 5 Democrats in the Senate voted against shutting the government down.

I urge @POTUS to carefully consider these concerns &amp; not impose trade restrictions that would harm domestic washing machine manufacturers or consumers with fewer choices and higher prices.
Blocking imports is serious biz &amp; should be done only in the rarest of circumstances &amp; soundest of reasons. The circumstances/reasons surrounding this petition are neither. Moreover, harm to U.S. consumers &amp; the economy demonstrates the broad impact of the proposed remedy.

Ultimately, this tax cut let's YOU decide how to spend YOUR money. 	Don't be fooled when some say this tax cut is not for the average middle class family.
With this cut, they will keep an extra $102 a month in their pockets. This gives the opportunity to: put away towards savings, pay off debts, have more family outings, purchase more school supplies and clothes for the kids, an extra night for a babysitter, etc.
In South Carolina's 5th District, the median household income is $48,243. Under this #taxreform bill, these families- the true middle class- will receive a tax CUT of $1,331. That is 3% of their yearly earnings.
