@RepAOC You should run for House Leader you would be so much better in the roll!!!!!!!
@KamalaHarris and contribute to your campaign, don't forget where you want us to fund your promotion.
@EncarnitaPyle @DispatchAlerts Gotta love money well wasted. To bad we couldn't earmark that money to actually improve something for the citizens.
@KamalaHarris Instead while you sit on stacks of your own cash you want the American People to fund your hopeful promotion? Considering you brag on supporting the middle and lower classes, I would think you want to focus more on Charity campaigning, and fund your own promotion.
