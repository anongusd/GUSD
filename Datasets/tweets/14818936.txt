@UnvarnishedMom Which is a large part of why we have no relationship today. I will go years without speaking to my parents now, and it doesn't really bother me. It seems to upset them, but we have the relationship that they earned. Nobody wants to be seen as just someone's problem to solve.
@UnvarnishedMom As a 42 year old who grew up in a similar scenario to your son, I can tell you that the problems between me and my parents never went away, and it was only ever exacerbated by their efforts to fix what they saw as a problem.

@RrodSg @AOC Doubtful that you respect anyone's view other than your own given your timeline. People like you can't be guided. You view empathy as weakness, and base your worldview around that. You're talking like we can't just go read your past statements and see who you really are.
@RrodSg @AOC Yes, we get it. You keep repeating the same misguided point. Do you have something new to add?
@RrodSg @AOC Were you dropped on your head as a baby? Saying that you are going to use the tools of democracy to get a replacement voted in during the next election is entirely different from working with the Russians to betray our country and sellout the presidency. Night and day difference.
@wildstein @AOC @JoshGottheimer @MikieSherrill @AndyKimNJ @CongressmanJVD In an interview she said don't expect her to endorse anyone until the NY primary.
@RrodSg @AOC Fuck that. Threaten them all. They're being threatened with truth and democracy, so if they have a problem with their votes being exposed, then they should be replaced.

@AOC Can't read it. Like NYTimes and other left-leaning, mainstream media, it's behind a paywall. Red team sites like Fox News and Breitbart are all open to the public for anyone who's interested in propaganda, but if you want to read news on the left, you have to pay.

@eveyaus @nowthisnews @AOC The committee had to coordinate with the special counsel's office in order to make sure they didn't talk about anything that could compromise an ongoing investigation.

@AOC @C_Sommerfeldt @NYDailyNews Primary them all!!
@SethAbramson There's also the perfectly reasonable explanation that this is all just placeholder data with guesses as to the date and number of pages, or the final format. This is the publisher saying that's what they think will happen.
@SethAbramson That's not how pre-orders work. The customer is billed when the item is shipped or electronically delivered. If there is no item, then no money is ever taken from the customer.
@SethAbramson @washingtonpost Products are regularly listed on Amazon with placeholder dates if an actual release date is not known.
@MaxKennerly @AshaRangappa_ @simonschuster Books, movies, and games are regularly posted to Amazon with speculative or placeholder dates. Sometimes this stuff is automated, and this might just be the date the publisher gave them just to fill in the blank. It's just a guess, not a contract.

@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC This is probably the new permanent state of things, so we need to adapt.

No. We cannot be the party of stasis.
@jbendery https://t.co/PeOfmdNKSk
@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC These are reasons to be vigilant about the info. sources we trust, &amp; rely more on data than individual anecdotes. I 100% expect the bots to come out against him;  the people that fund those bots hate his platform. This is just pain we will have to deal with to create good change.
@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC The numbers say that Bernie has raised more money than anyone else, even in the short time since he has announced, which means a lot of individual small dollar donations. He's also highest in the polls among candidates that have announced.
@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC Don't give too much weight to individual anecdotes. A poll with millions of responses is a far more accurate picture of how things are than the few individual stories you heard. You have to look at the numbers.

@krassenstein Bills require a Rep. Senate &amp; White House to pass, so I don't know why people are celebrating. As long as the red team has this much control, any bills are just grandstanding and have no actual hope of passing. This kind of stuff is exactly why people have no faith in Congress.
@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC And it's a total farce to believe that Democrats debating policy is somehow going to re-elect Trump. None of his core is ever going to vote blue, so it makes no sense to compromise our platform in any way to accommodate them. We should focus on getting non-voters to vote.
@RichardCella6 @ProudResister @AOC The sticking together part happens after the primary. Until then, we need to spend the time agreeing on a platform. Trying to shut down that conversation in the name of "unity" is only going to create more strife afterwards. We have to have the whole conversation.

@thinkdinx @kate_catherall Yeah, I agree. It’s like saying “I understand that this upset you, I don’t want you to be upset, but I also don’t agreed that I did anything wrong”
@KimGeeRN @kate_catherall @yashar Yeah, this comes closer to being an honest response then a fake apology.
@kate_catherall I use that line to make it clear that I’m not sorry for what I did. I get that they’re upset, but that doesn’t mean I’m backing down to accommodate their response. Their emotional reaction does not make me wrong.

@hashtag_AAA @MickeyHoliday @nowthisnews That's not what this is though. This is just a person in a legal state standing in front of someone else's legal weed.

@GreatBlanconi @jwrneriii @MeetThePress @chucktodd @NYCMayor They had a deal, but the the city decided to try to drag them back in after the deal was done to try to get new concessions out of them, and then spent a ton of time publicly talking about Amazon as some evil company, and then stopped taking their calls. AMZN was right to leave.
@jwrneriii @MeetThePress @chucktodd @NYCMayor Now other companies know that if you're looking to relocate to NY, if the city doesn't get their way, politicians will lead protests against you and go on the news regularly &amp; talk shit about your company. What company wouldn't want that PR? Welcome to New York.

@glennid10t @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress Good luck with that scenario. After this debacle, I don't think any other city is willing to die on that hill.
@JelloSizzlin @MeetThePress @NYCMayor Because the deal that was initially struck was the one that won the competition for NY against those other cities. Everybody forgets about that part. NY kept trying to drag them back in to get new concessions after an agreement had already been reached. They were right to leave.
@mscafo @MeetThePress @NYCMayor Given that most of the progressive arguments were about Queens not being able to properly handle that level of economic growth, your idea would definitely help them keep their economy from growing.
@len_len51 @MeetThePress @NYCMayor That's not how it works.
@glennid10t @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress Yes, not understanding your poorly articulated argument makes me stupid. Got it. It sounds like you're just angrily throwing out buzzwords. You defined corporate speech using the Citizen's United case, which was about political donations to PACs, which aren't in play here.
@glennid10t @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress Play what? I asked you one single question about the core thesis of your statement, which should mean that you of all people would be capable of answering it. If you can’t explain how it’s relevant when it’s your own statement, how could anybody else be expected to?

@Mybrainisuphere @MeetThePress @NYCMayor It's up to the city to improve infrastructure, not companies. Companies can't legally build on land they don't own, so what could they have done? The way it's supposed to happen is the company pays taxes to the government, who is then responsible for using it to build up the city
@Jsquan55 @MeetThePress @chucktodd @NYCMayor Definitely, &amp; DeBlasio's statement made it sound like AMZN was weak to handle it. Sure thing, One of the largest, most successful companies in the world had cities across the US gladly competing for jobs from them. It was the city that screwed this up.
@MaeecsX @MeetThePress @NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo Why would they do that after a competition between several cities for those jobs. You remember there was a competition, right?	They didn't leave because of the incentives. They left because the city gov. got hostile with them and started making new demands after the deal was made
@glennid10t @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress I wasn't asking for a definition. I was asking for the relevance.
@CharlieVC90210 @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress Every progressive politician saw this as a chance to get free publicity by scoring points on them by dragging them in to make new demands after the deal was made. Amazon rightly said fuck off.
@CharlieVC90210 @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress They never lost those subsidies. They walked away from them. If they stayed they could have kept them. They left because the city started angrily making more demands after they won the competition.
@glennid10t @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress How is this a corporate speech issue?
@noybsk2017 @NBCNightlyNews @MeetThePress Wait, do you think that incentives are for unsuccessful companies only, or they only give incentives that have some deep need for it? This was a competition, you against many other cities. The incentives were an investment in bringing in large numbers of future jobs.
@bayofarizona @SherylNYT Maybe not pure capitalism, but in our countries version of capitalism,  it's a common tactic used nationwide to attract jobs. 	Given how your worded it, it sounds like you think NY was giving Amazon a check for $3B, but this was just a reduction in future taxes on that office.
@SherylNYT Not great that people are going to point at their attack on Amazon as the practical application of their socialist beliefs. It's too easy to say that their strain of socialism equals chasing away high-paying, family-supporting jobs, then celebrating that loss as "incredible".

@AOC Food stamps? The Amazon minimum wage is $15. Doesn't your team refer to that as a living wage?	How about finding a new foil that's actually evil instead of stopping at the top of the list of largest companies. Pharma? Oil? Gun mfg.? Polluters? Why do they get a pass?
@eric_hedford @brodietlewis @hedidntgetit @AOC Sure there's worse companies, but that would require me to look past the top of the list of largest companies to get my hate boner on.
@MFCOMMAND @Cantide1 @CylustheVirus @AOC So many anecdotes, so little actual data.	Too much weight is given to these anecdotal stories, and there's too much of a willingness to immediately use the first anecdote your hear as a stand-in for the uniform experience of all 500k Amazon employees.
@CameronMasscha1 @davecdnb @AnthroNerd @AOC What is your problem with the culture? Not enough "real americans"? Oh wait, the argument everyone seems to be using now is "they're not real new yorkers".
@SabaSmw @AOC Affordable housing is a problem everywhere. If the city was concerned about gentrification, then maybe they shouldn't have participated in that competition to begin with. All the other cities in that competition were foaming at the mouth for those jobs.
@SabaSmw @AOC Amazon is not moving 25K employees, they are ramping up and these are new jobs. Some may be transfers, but the vast majority will be new hires from the local job market. They had also committed millions of dollars for job training and upskilling to get people ready to work there.
@TogetherBroken1 @AOC Then change the tax law. You act like they were caught committing a crime. You may not like it, but If they were breaking the law the IRS would be going after them. What company or individual would ever volunteer more than they were taxed? Want more? Tax them more.
@SabaSmw @AOC HQ2 in Queens was going to be corporate offices with 25000 jobs averaging $120k salary. This meant they were hiring developers, designers, project managers, lawyers, administrative staff, managers, directors, VPs...all of it. This was not just another fulfillment center.
@newyorkperi @AOC But that money doesn't exist without Amazon. NY is not writing them a check for $3B. It's works more like a tax coupon, letting them pay only $17B in taxes in your first year instead of $20B. Now there's no money to NY.
@TogetherBroken1 @AOC There was no report that said that.
@SabaSmw @AOC Yeah, fuck 25,000 high-paying, family-supporting, salaried jobs with benefits and all of their associated tax revenue. We don't need that shit around here.
@ncbjd @AOC You really tore down their whole argument there. Good job.
@AOC But there was a competition with broad public support to bring Amazon to NY. Why enter the competition at all? Cities were foaming at the mouth for those jobs. All the New Yorkers forgot that part as soon as the competition was over.
@TulsiGabbard All that happened is those jobs shifted somewhere else. 	They're still in the country that you're running to be president of.
@TulsiGabbard Yeah, fuck 25,000 high-paying, family-supporting, salaried jobs with benefits and all of their associated tax revenue. We don't need that shit around here.
@dustysmocky1973 @TulsiGabbard Maybe they shouldn't have participated in a competition with other cities then.
@Scout_Finch Yes
RT @dailykos: U.S.-born Latinas, harassed by border agent for speaking Spanish while grocery shopping, sue https://t.co/nyN6fLrgJ6
@IThinkBc_IAm @andrewrsorkin But taxes are what you describe. The bonuses you mention are given by their employers, not the govt.. It's part of their pay. Sure it's more than you want them to get, but that doesn't change where it comes from. If the govt. is going to take anything there, it's through taxes.
@JTrelan @dtweiseth @AnandWrites Yes, he went on the news and said his words buts the extent of it. There's nothing that Sanders can do on his own other than talk. He can't arbitrarily levy penalties on anyone.
@mjkendall @andrewrsorkin Maybe they shouldn’t’ve joined the competition with all those other cities in the first place if that was going to be their attitude. 	I hope some of those jobs come here now.
@DanMache1 @VishaanNYC @errollouis @MTA So your argument is that Amazon is just constantly building and leasing new buildings and office space to leave it empty? They just like having the offices sitting there costing them money but not being used?
@tebsf @Mmcsherry34 @errollouis @NYCSpecial2019 @MTA Because that was the agreement you made that won you the competition against all those other cities. Don’t compete if you don’t like the results of winning.
@TRC288 @andrewrsorkin @realtybird Then don’t join the competition to begin with.
@Economicopoly @andrewrsorkin Then don’t join the competition to begin with.
@randalleclayton @asymco @andrewrsorkin Don’t blame Amazon because you decided to participate in the competition with other cities and changed your mind about it after you won. There was a lot of public support for this during the competition itself, it was only after that everybody got cold feet.
@JMKIII58 @andrewrsorkin @NevilleD35 Of course it’s not a guarantee, nobody can guarantee the future, but you make bets on solid performers, which Amazon obviously is. You’re requiring a level of certainty about their performance that isn’t possible or reasonable to expect.
@gay_lussac @andrewrsorkin I bet your pedantism gets all the girls.
@mjkendall @andrewrsorkin And the minimum wage at Amazon is $15 an hour, even in the fulfillment centers, which is a living wage according to AOC and Bernie Sanders.
@mjkendall @andrewrsorkin Welfare? HQ2 in Queens was going to be corporate offices with 25000 jobs averaging $120k salary. This meant developers, designers, project managers, lawyers, administrative staff, managers, directors, VPs...all of it. This was not just another fulfillment center.
@theshein @rkrisburg @andrewrsorkin The maybe don’t join the competition next time. Everyone in New York seems to have forgotten there was a competition.
@scottdclausen @andrewrsorkin If you don’t like the incentives, why participate in the competition to begin with?
@KevMendo @MarekZee @johnnyrotten23 @rahrdes @andrewrsorkin You don’t have to be a citizen to own property, or to owe property taxes.
@IThinkBc_IAm @andrewrsorkin Because you can’t just punitively tax somebody at 100% because you don’t like them. That’s would be a very unfair system and wouldn’t last very long.
@WhenIs2001 Why did you participate in the competition to begin with?
@Biff_Ardo @BADROTO @StinkenderKase @BrianBe25516821 @mollycrabapple The jobs didn't disappear, they're just moving to another state.

@Coffeecurd @JvittalTV @maggieNYT @RepGregoryMeeks @NY1 @SpectrumNewsDC Where was that energy when you were competing with other cities for jobs. Everybody seems to forget there was a competition, with broad public support at the time.
@AndreaR20347296 @JvittalTV @maggieNYT @RepGregoryMeeks @NY1 @SpectrumNewsDC It was not a warehouse. HQ2 in Queens was going to be corporate offices with 25000 jobs averaging $120k salary.

@ReneeStephen @dfromthebx @AnandWrites But Amazon has a $15 an hour minimum wage, which both AOC and Bernie Sanders describe as a living wage. 	I agree with you in principle, but there's many other better examples of evil corporations &amp; billionaires if we're willing to look past the top of the list of richest/largest.
@ChunxOfEarth @AnandWrites Something like this?	https://t.co/NvcK5UdBQI
@form12019 @AnandWrites None of those Texas Enterprise fund companies in your article are growing, established tech companies. Any argument that they wouldn't bring the jobs they promised is just not reasonable.  Amazon already has a half million employees and is constantly adding more.
@EuclidAlone @AnandWrites Why? Amazon pays their employees $15 an hour, which Bernie and AOC both characterize as a living wage.
@JTrelan @dtweiseth @AnandWrites Really, did he sue them? Did he pass a bill? No, there was no actual lever that Bernie Sanders on his own could possibly used to make Amazon do that. He happened to talk to the press at the same time, maybe, but that's about it.
@tozo @AnandWrites You mean Walmart is already providing you with 25,000 avg. $100k salary jobs with benefits? These are high-paying, family-supporting jobs. Well, at least they were.
@jfalbanese @AnandWrites But you're making it sound like they're writing them a 3 billion dollar check, but that's not what this is. This is the city agreeing to take 17 million instead of 20 million in taxes on the first year. Now they get 0. There is no 3 billion without Amazon.
@ReneeStephen @dfromthebx @AnandWrites And how do you suggest the different cities compete to attract jobs? Are you saying this should be decided by the government? You want Amazon to request permission to expand, and then have the federal government tell them which city they can go to?
@thatotherJennie @AnandWrites @swmstn2 Aren't there rules against you revealing that kind of information?
@XBIObserver @grahamnashville @CMChauran That's been my experience with tech companies.
@colbypitt @hisWillbedone74 @mcmillen @BJL @akarl_smith @AOC These are all jobs for salaried employees, not part-time hourly. Good, well-paying, family supporting jobs with benefits.
@colbypitt @lenalynx @hisWillbedone74 @mcmillen @BJL @akarl_smith @AOC They didn't abandon the jobs, they abandoned Queens. The jobs will just be located somewhere else now. 25K in Virginia for HQ2, 5K in Nashville for an ops center, and many others around the country at other smaller satellite offices.
@JustNotTheSam @jamiecorrao @akarl_smith @AOC They probably shouldn't have participated in the competition to begin with if that's the case. It seems that there was broad public support at the beginning though, at least until the competition was decided.
@clivesmom @BalthazarThudp @dmrayner @SWM_in_SEA @akarl_smith @AOC @amazon But they won't. Nobody else is that stupid. They want the jobs, that's what matters. You took a stand, you played your protest card, &amp; you lost. If you don't like the competition, don't participate in the first place. Public opposition didn't start until the competition was over.
@FlippinReepers @FrankAd97116324 @JohnMajinjon @thsadtrth @ProGenitor09 @ZVanDenBosch @Meancupjoe @kkg63 @ArtieKGB @akarl_smith @AOC These were high-paying, family supporting, corporate jobs, not warehouse jobs. Lawyers, designers, developers, administrative staff. AOC says a 40 hour a week job should be able to support a family. These are exactly the kinds of jobs that enable that.
@glosuen @JimmyVanBramer There's so many large companies &amp; actually nefarious rich people that escape scrutiny because they have the good sense not to be the richest or the largest. People don't bother to look much past the top of the list for rich people to hate.
@hawkingdo @i_lasombra @Moses0507 @A_Winston_Saxe @JimmyVanBramer @AOC Amazon has half a million employees. This is not a sports stadium, this is a growing tech company. That was 25000 high paying, family supporting jobs. And given that they're always growing, it probably wouldn't have stopped there. Kicking them out was short-term thinking.
@MaxKennerly So they believe in Jesus, just not a single word that he said.
@DJkiddm @Physicsfreek @nkolakowski @AOC The competition was the free market at work. Nobody was forced to compete, and everybody involved wanted those jobs. It’s just the New Yorkers that forgot that the competition ever happened after they won.  What is a realistic alternative to competition?
@nkolakowski @JFrusci @AOC Then why did they enter the competition to begin with?
@rossrader @WilliamBBurch @nkolakowski @AOC Yeah, but we’re talking about a company that already has around a half million employees. It’s a completely different situation. There’s no doubt the jobs would come, and likely exceed the initial numbers. The HQ in Seattle is still expanding.
@nkolakowski @bullitt5657 @phuxley86 @AOC They would’ve also needed to balance that with not allowing other competing cities to find out what they were offering, so those cities wouldn’t get a chance to up their offers as well.
@jennlavayen @alex_murphy @nkolakowski @AOC Why participate in the competition at all then?
@araindogtoo @GorillaCookies1 @NY1 @AOC Nobody was writing Amazon a check. This was them not having to pay future taxes, though they would still end up paying lots of taxes overall. At least they will now to the state where they end up.
@gaberealist @ForecasterEnten Who then become New Yorkers themselves, following the cycle of pretty much everyone that was ever new to the city. 	Are you checking IDs to make sure that people are real New Yorkers? Why should you or anyone get to police anybody else’s claim on living in the city?
@46mingo @witliftin @ForecasterEnten New Yorkers are all forgetting that there was a competition as soon as they won. There’s other cities. I would be happy for my city to have those jobs

@ewarren @amazon There was a competition, which NYC conveniently forgot as soon as they won.	The attitude I heard from a lot of New Yorkers is basically "how dare they consider any other part of America as appropriate, Only New Yorkers could do this", thus shitting on all the other cities.

@ananavarro @EllenCotler The focus should be on activating people who don't vote already, not converting red to blue. 	The partisan divide is too wide and there's already plenty of like-minded people that just need to be motivated to vote. 	Ditching corporate Dems is step 1.
@ananavarro @EllenCotler So you think Democrats should nominate a Republican so that they can court the Republican vote.
@ananavarro But you're a Republican.	The Democratic party shouldn't be abandoning its principles to appeal to the Republicans.	We should take the AOC example and lean hard into moral leadership and workers rights.

@DavidRutz @ewarren In her earlier speech, she said all federal candidates should release their tax returns. Federal, not Presidential. 	Does this mean she would support a resolution to force all members of Congress and the Supreme Court to release their tax returns? What about cabinet members?
@ThePlumLineGS @ryangrim @ewarren Given her lifelong work in these areas, she's one of the few candidates that are able to speak from a position of authority on these topics.
@ShaneGoldmacher The rolls are small, but at least we know they are active.
@ShaneGoldmacher For all the other declared candidates, their rolls are filled with fresh voters donating in the current cycle. That seems more valuable. I've donated to both Harris and Warren at this point.
@ShaneGoldmacher The part they didn't talk about was that Bernie's donor rolls are carried over from 2016, so they're hoping that everyone who donated then will donate now. I'm on those rolls &amp; that's not true for me right now.
@JerylBier @RyanHillMI @JStein_WaPo These people! They exist! They're out there! Call the police!!!!
@AaronGolding8 @AOC @JStein_WaPo So I take it that since you're so focused on your illumaniti document, you've already looked at HR itself and couldn't find anything wrong with it.
@joseph9love @AOC @JStein_WaPo Sir, this is Wendy's.
@MitchFletcher4 @KellyScaletta @AOC @JStein_WaPo The real question is why is the red team so afraid of the content in the actual HR that they spend all their time talking about a separate secret document like they discovered some lib conspiracy. 	Did you give up on finding bigfoot or something?
@MitchFletcher4 @KellyScaletta @AOC @JStein_WaPo The Green New Deal existed long before this House Resolution,, or the FAQ doc you are talking about. All that was retracted was the FAQ, which is an ancillary document. The ideas embodied in the GND are all expressed in the HR, which is publicly viewable to all and linked above.
@KellyScaletta @MitchFletcher4 @AOC @JStein_WaPo They'd all rather believe that there's a secret Illuminati plan at work.
@jonfriedman @AOC @JStein_WaPo He said it wasn't part of the House Resolution, which is true.
@RangersW4TP @AOC @JStein_WaPo Yes, you're linking back to beginning of the conversation. Good find, Sherlock.
@AOC @JStein_WaPo But where did that FAQ content come from? 	Did your team write it themselves, or was it src'd from elsewhere?	Who authorized its publishing?	Who was involved in the decision to remove the language?	What was the reason for removing it?	What can we point people at to address this?
@TheBeatWithAri I think they're the FBI, not Robert Mueller's employees.
@bradNineteen @JStein_WaPo So in the end, this is just about you wanting people you don't like to suffer.
@bradNineteen @JStein_WaPo All it means is that they considered &amp; rejected the idea.	As someone who has written for a living, your view of rough drafts is entirely mistaken. That's where you throw in your earliest ideas, &amp; then talk about and refine them. The final draft is the result of those discussions.
@KatRussell12 @ericgarland But that is an emotional reaction. 	Wanting him to break is wanting him to feel a specific way.	The man is not capable of those feelings to begin with, so appealing to his empathy will always fail.	Red team views empathy as weakness, and callousness as strength.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Her speech said federal candidates, not just Presidential candidates.	Did @ewarren just call for all members of Congress to release their tax returns? Please?
@ewarren 	I saw your speech and it sounded like you said every *Federal* candidate should release their tax returns, not just presidential candidates.	Does this mean that anyone running for a federal office, including Congress, should also release their tax returns. I hope so.
@AndrewSolender In her MTP interview, AOC said not to expect an endorsement from her until the NY primary.	Right now she has the ability to influence the policies of every candidate, and that will be diminished is she endorses anyone.
@MaxKennerly https://t.co/vSTyjqE9Q4
@MaxKennerly Warren to Harris:	"Oh, you think strong populist economic policy is your ally. But you merely adopted this policy; I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see a bank until I was already a woman, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING!"
@ryangrim @JoeCrowleyNY @AOC Does it matter?	This is like a deer underestimating the semi that ran it over.	In the end, his assessment of the situation had very little to do with the actual outcome.
@NewYorker Nothing in this article justifies continuing to lock up inordinately large numbers of black and brown people over a plant.
@cjlxx @ericgarland Really? Did they reunite the kids with their parents while he was talking?	Evil people hire evil staff to continue accomplishing their evil goals while they are busy being berated for being evil. The evil doesn't stop.
@NateSilver538 Or moderates are being rejected because people recognize they only preach half measures. 	I don't want someone to stand up and passionately tell me that we're *not* going to focus on solving real problems or that the goals required to do so are too big.
@theintercept @aidachavez @AOC Hey @justicedems 	Please primary everybody who is even involved in this conversation.	Purge them all.	Thank you.
@PattyOLimerick @ericgarland But why would he? He has no motivation to do so. 	The people attacking him are all declawed.	No one is afraid of a Congress that can't do anything to them.	They can't pass bills and their subpoenas can be ignored. 	They can only talk.

@Matthuber78 @JStein_WaPo That FAQ does mention jokingly mention cow farts. It was a mistake to think that people could understand humor in text like that, but that's where we are. No one go it, and now people like you are attacking her.
@krassenstein @AOC Almost a tenth of the US population (325m) has now watched that video.
@ericgarland To what end? More grandstanding? All they're doing is finger-wagging. He's a sociopath and you're not going to make him feel anything. The long speeches just drive home the point that they have no real power to change anything. What specific actions could they actually make here?
@Matthuber78 @JStein_WaPo So do you think it's some conspiracy that somebody tried to insert UBI text into an early draft. 		Why does that matter more to you than the actual resolution?
@JStein_WaPo We live in a world where rough drafts and early versions become Illuminati documents of secret intent. Nobody cares about the actual house resolution, they only care that a lib wrote something they can pounce on.
@IndivisibleNet irrelevant people?
@CNN Why is CNN so obviously pushing for a weak moderate candidate? Shit like this is the  way that they talked people into nominating Clinton last time around. They're rehashing all the same stories so we can lose the same way.

@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP Good. I hope they abandon NY. I hope those jobs come here. We would love them.
@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP Sure dude, I'll get right on education-ing myself.
@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP Wouldn't all that mean NY jobs? I think so. Or do you think they will import people from Seattle for that work too?
@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP I think it's asinine to think that they would open an office just to relocate 20,000 Seattleites to NYC. That would only cost them and their employees (far more than the subsidies they would get) and would do nothing to take advantage of the new area they were in.
@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP They were already almost a trillion dollar company, but sure, $3B in tax breaks is worth dragging their name through the mud over.
@_tarrvis @McCartneyWP So you think the Amazon people decided that that the best way to spend their money was to build a new facility in an area with much higher real estate costs just to relocate their existing employees there? Why go through the hassle at all?
@tmokh294 @realDonaldTrump You know the message you just sent likely traveled through space at some point, right? Just because you don't value something personally doesn't mean it has no value.

@speros901 @McCartneyWP @JeffBezos Sure, ending an agreement because the other party decided to drag you through the mud after the deal was signed is extortion. I'm glad they're leaving.		If you think this will hurt them, just remember they were already the worlds largest company before this convo even started.
@adamjohnsonNYC For anyone that cares about space, stories about Blue Origin are not at all puff pieces. I understand you're getting your anti-Bezos flex on, but as one of the only companies on the planet to have successfully flown and re-flown a rocket, they're anything but superfluous.
@Rsgriffiths @emilynussbaum @Ginger_Clark Not to get in the way of a good rant, but Amazon is now paying their US employees at least $15/hour.

@leahmcelrath Ok cool, but what is it that makes it wrong? The other non-Abrams speakers are speaking in front of different cameras, in different buildings, at different times. They are not interfering with Abrams speech in any way.  What's the problem? Same night? Same news cycle?
@leahmcelrath I disagree with the idea that him speaking at all that night is somehow disrespectful, and the application of this label is being selectively applied. Harris and Klobuchar are also speaking that night, which should also earn your label, but does not for some reason.
@leahmcelrath No moral authority can be derived from a platform of selectively silencing others.

@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton I feel like I need to clarify this because you keep making the same point. I am not Bernie Sanders. I am also not his representative or a current supporter (I support @ewarren if you must know). Continuing to reference him feels like you are deflecting.
@BettyBowers "To come to our country you must internalize the idea that our culture matters and yours does not. Reject your identity so that we may find you acceptable."
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton Why do you think think "Sanders is a thief" matters at all in the argument about collusion? I don't care about Sanders.	https://t.co/aukr7x2vy3
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton I never said Hillary did that. She colluded with the DNC to subborn his campaign.	Also, why do you have your location data turned off? Bet I know why.	https://t.co/Nxc9stZHYB
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton Look comrade, I don't know how it works in your country but here "other people committed crimes too" is not an argument. That just means there were two guilty parties.
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton So in your world it doesn't matter what crimes are committed along the way as long as she gets the votes?
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton The article that you just posted is about the Sanders campaigns access to voter data, not anything to do with hacking their emails. You literally didn't look at the first paragraph of the article you posted as proof. 	 https://t.co/LKBiYDuoTB
@SarahLerner Ending the Mueller investigation after getting rid of Trump would be like turning off your antivirus after you got rid of your first virus. It should be a permanent commission. All politicians should be able to stand up to this level of scrutiny. Our govt. needs an antivirus.
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton Do you have a link? I provided one to a reputable news source to support my claim. Here's another one. Where's yours?	https://t.co/hNLiTzdtGz
@weciv01 @guardiannews The campaign is not the debate thought. They're all on social media talking with millions of ppl and building their name recognition. Both Warren and Harris have published policy proposals too, and I've seen other candidates posting their stances on social media.
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton It wasn't fair how we were caught is not an argument.
@abcd1234tim @MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton The emails came from Russian hackers, who released them through Wikileaks, which is what Roger Stone just got arrested in relation to.	But regardless of how it went public, there is still clear evidence of wrongdoing. https://t.co/S5zK7Us42i
@weciv01 @guardiannews Sure, but you can't know for sure how that will play out until after it does. And what group would be responsible for deciding who gets a chance to prove themselves &amp; who's not allowed to even try. Seems undemocratic to have a group of elites pick who is blessed to run.
@weciv01 @guardiannews That's only a temporary problem and will resolve itself.
@guardiannews This seems like the move of a Republican billionaire who sees his party is going to lose in 2020 and thinks he can use his wallet to split the vote and give Trump a chance.
@MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton I'm not sure what argument you think you are making.
@KamalaHarris Where are you on the @aoc and @ewarren tax plans? Do you have any specifics in that area of your own?
@MeetThePress Well that can't be broadly reinterpreted to suit any narrative.
@MAExitResist @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton While the two arguments you listed are not mutually exclusive (as you claim), neither are the argument I was making. The emails showed clear collusion between the DNC and HRC team to undermine the Sanders campaign and ensure the process was tiled in her favor. She played dirty.

@academic_degn @HuffPost Even if only a small amount of people go with him, that has the possibility of peeling away enough voters to shift the outcome of an election. It may only take a few percentage points to matter.
@CNNPolitics How tone deaf do you have to be to think you have a shot at this point. You're universally hated by your own party for what you did in 2016, and if you run Trump will win again. Stop putting your ego before the country.
@SB_zom @HuffPost He's running third-party, not Democrat.

@HuffPost Do not do this, asshole. You are not wanted by anyone and all you're going to do is split the Democratic vote and make sure Trump gets elected again. There's no way you can win, so you're obviously using your failed candidacy as a tool to accomplish something else. What is it?

@jeannirenae @ScottNevins @tonyposnanski @NewNowNext I don't think being a good member of society means destroying kids lives. As a society, we understand kids are immature and shouldn't be subjected to the same penalties as adults; we codify that in our laws by trying kids as juveniles.. 1/?

@JoeySmithee If you watch the video, you see Mr. Phillips group head straight into the middle of a crowd of kids who had been standing around waiting for the bus in one place for like 30 minutes. There was plenty of room to go around them, but he saw the red hats and headed straight for them.
@Cher47 @LOLGOP What is the look you're supposed to have on your face when someone walks up on you like they want to fight, and they're staring you down like you caused all the problems in their world, but you don't know why, you just see a dude being all aggro at you.
@Cher47 @LOLGOP Then the Indian dude walked up on them like he wading into battle and they represented all the evil in his world, which was the energy he brought when he confronted them and got all up in their face. Most people who walk up on them like that are looking to fight.
@Cher47 @LOLGOP So while they are standing there waiting for their bus, they're getting hateful shit shouted at them out nonstop by the Black Israelite protesters for like 30 minutes. while they watch as a group from a distance for the most part.
@Cher47 @LOLGOP Also, we're talking about these kids like they were all dressed as Hitler youth, but like 10% of them had red hats on, which is probably a pretty reasonable outcome for a big group of Kentuckians.
@Cher47 @LOLGOP And a lot of them are red hats because their parents are red hats, and many are because their friends are, but I don't buy that any of them have a developed enough sense of the world to have any kind of meaningful political view at that point. They haven't seen enough.

The specific history of the particular drum in question not relevant, and your arguments all seem to be pedantic jabs and purity tests. I'm done.
@quinticfunction @jules_su And the red-hat kids had been there for their pro-life march. There were several marches that day in the public space around Lincoln Memorial. They were standing apart from each other in the video, and the sound of the drums only started once you see the Indian group march in.

@jules_su That dude marched into a crowd of 16 yr old boys like he was going into war and one of them killed his son. Meanwhile the black hebrew guys were literally calling them all school shooters and saying shit like "none of this will be over until blood is shed" for like 30 mins.
@OsitaNwanevu Fear of violence shouldn't stop you from doing the right thing. We can't be afraid of them. The only people responsible for violence are the people actually being violent. If there is violence it should be treated as the crime it is, not as a means to make political change.

@ChrisMurphyCT Mueller report may show that Pence is complicit. jumping the gun would mean that Pence would have time to hire a new Republican VP before he got himself impeached. Waiting for the report impeaches them both out of office at once, leaving Nancy Pelosi in the oval.

@PMcfarty @TulsiGabbard On your second point, the great thing about an evidence-based argument is that as long as it consists of a collection of independently verifiable facts, like we have here, then it doesn't matter where the first tweet came from.
@PMcfarty @TulsiGabbard RT is the propaganda arm of Russian state media in the west. Everything that comes from them is intended to push a Russian agenda or viewpoint., as defined by the Russian state and Putin. If there's something that RT wants to happen, then it can only be bad for the U.S.

@PMcfarty @TulsiGabbard Yes, if you can find evidence of RT publishing so many consistently positive articles about Bernie or any American politician that it looks like they are actively supporting them, then you should 100% worry. Well, I should. I don't know what side you are on.
@ChngkngExpresso @TulsiGabbard In this case, yes. You would be much more believable if your account was more than 90 days old.

@QueenVampyre @NBCNews He ran as one. And he certainly isn't a Republican, which in the end is the only opposition that matters.
@OverUnderClover @QueenVampyre @NBCNews In the 2016 election, Bernie was calling for more debates beyond the 6 the DNC allowed. The DNC at the time said if he participated in other debates, he couldn't participate in the main debates. This was called the "exclusivity rule" and angered many Dems at the time.
@NBCNews This was one of the tools they used in the last election to try to control Bernie, &amp;they were even talking about trying to prevent him from running altogether if he participated in a non-sanctioned debate.The DNC has probably already decided who they want , just like last time.
@politicalglutto Right, but if they're going to end up going to jail for just as long regardless of if they talk or not, then they have no real motivation to talk.
@michaelianblack Because Mueller loses leverage on the people he's trying to flip; The biggest thing he can offer to get people to talk is "talk and stay out of jail", and if he tries to make that agreement with someone who saw Flynn go to jail w/ the same agreement, they won't flip.

@edbott But you create a situation where docs created by one set of Word users (64) can't be opened by another (32)
@edbott & making a new 64bit format would mean that 32bit users couldn't read those files, sacrificing portability. not worth the bad press
@edbott But PST/OST is not meant to be portable and is not a standard. The  office document files are now standards.
@edbott But they just changed the file format with 2007, and there's no way they would create different versions of the format for 32 and 64
