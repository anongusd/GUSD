@omartheterror A little of both. A new map must be drawn but, in PA's case, with one less district. Often that means two members of Congress get thrown into the same district and must run against each other.

*Barletta running for SENATE https://t.co/eOs3bqwx93
Between the retirements (Brady, Meehan, Dent, Shuster, Murphy) and Barletta running for Congress, Pennsylvania is going to lose quite a bit of clout in the next Congress. And then, after the next Census, it's going to lose yet another congressional seat in reapportionment.
This Upstate SC seat has been a real locus of action over the last two decades -- it elected Bob Inglis and then tossed him out in a primary (his crime was being a squish), produced Jim DeMint and then Gowdy. Will remain in GOP hands https://t.co/P5wcIPVxME
