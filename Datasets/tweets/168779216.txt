DOT Secretary Christy Hall: The temporary, 1.5-mile barrier along U.S. 501 over the Waccamaw River (at Conway) should be done by noon Wednesday. The 1-mile barrier along U.S. 378 over Lynches River was finished yesterday. That's supposed to keep a route open to Myrtle Beach.
SC DNR Director Alvin Taylor: 93 people have been rescued from the floodwaters in South Carolina. First responders have helped 814 people evacuate their homes in non-life-threatening situations, such as using boats to get people to dry land.
DNR Col. Alvin Taylor warns residents along the Waccamaw River not to return when the floodwaters appear to hit a high. There will be two flood stages, possibly 12 hours apart. "There will be a pause in the flood, then it will rise again," he said. "Wait until the water recedes."

Some Republicans want to reject $8B state budget over Planned Parenthood @postandcourier https://t.co/ebLKb9gV5u
House is recessing until 2 p.m. amid efforts to reject the budget over money that indirectly goes to Planned Parenthood through state insurance plans for non-abortion services such as birth control. The organization is among 4,400 providers in SC for such family planning services
Attempt by Sen. Richard Cash to reject the budget over this failed. https://t.co/iZ1rReQuSn
The Senate just passed the $8 billion budget compromise 30-9. https://t.co/mCEay0spog

The motion from bank board member Joe Taylor is to end the bank's participation in extending 526.
It's getting personal. Bank board chairman to County Council Chairman Vic Rawl: "I have told you politely the ball’s in your court. We’re a bank. You need to show me where the money is. ... I think you’ve been disingenuous in how you’ve dealt with me." https://t.co/2Bs4zUuA8K

@AndyShain Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg: "Please open your minds and hearts to the needs of Charleston and our state and citizens. Let’s find a way forward to make this a reality."
State Transportation Infrastructure Bank Chairman John White says the board has received about 126 letters in favor of extending Interstate 526 and 20 to 30 opposed. Former Rep. Chip Limehouse says those in favor include a "who's who" of Charleston's business community
