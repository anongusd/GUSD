@KellyO @senatemajldr So are we. @senatemajldr it is time to put #countryoverparty. Get Senate &amp; HOUSE to pass bill no border funding, if POTUS vetos OVERRIDE.  Then, when you get back from Christmas break ensure POTUS is kept checked, otherwise history will remember you as being complicit.
@stucam7771 @marieproia Boat, tunnel, plane, Canada, Mail. Blackmail someone here to grow it on US soil for them, put in unsuspecting luggage, um...

Ok twitterverse, today is the longest day of the year and also my son's birthday.  I am going to TRY to not look at the news until later this afternoon. @POTUS could you not start thermonuclear war while I am doing family things?
@senatemajldr @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Today is the longest day of the year. After today, the days become shorter.  PLEASE keep the government open. Pass negotiated funding bill, let POTUS veto and gather the votes and OVER RIDE him, uphold your oath.

@stan80998585 @SenSchumer When I said all he cares about is money, I meant HIS money. I was hoping that I could retire before I am 70, he is plunging us into a depression making that unlikely. If Congress does nothing after the investigations, I will in 2020. I pray most voters, no matter party will too.
@stan80998585 @SenSchumer I'll not be silenced when I see the possibility of danger that this president presents.  He is unfit for the office. His actions &amp; words show me that all he cares about is money. As you can see when I posted this, I can't sleep from the stress. Hope that changes in January,tired.
@stan80998585 @SenSchumer I grew up with bomb drills &amp; having night terrors of nuclear war, waking up to the sensation of my skin burning.  I was shushed by teachers as I knew at 7 yrs old if a bomb hit we burn &amp; said so in class. I met a survivor of Nagasaki when I was 10.  I remember they're words.
@larryj41 @RepBrianBabin veteran programs, programs to support military families, schools, etc.
@larryj41 @RepBrianBabin Actually if you look at the polls, I am correct. A wall is a waste of resources that could go to social services like feeding/housing the poor/elderly/disabled or drug rehab programs.
