Democrats literally don’t care how many Americans are murdered by illegal immigrants.		The potential for future votes is far more important than American lives to them.
Democrats don’t care how many U.S. citizens die. What they care about is how many poor illiterates completely dependent on government they can import and the illegal votes they’ll generate for Democrats.

WHO IS OBAMA ?	Obama có bố là người Kenya, mẹ là người Mỹ da trắng. Theo như ông nói thì ông được sinh ra ở đảo Hawai - Mỹ. Tuy nhiên điều này vẫn chưa hết nghi ngờ, bởi vì vẫn chưa tìm thấy những người làm lễ rửa tội cho Obama ở nhà thờ theo thông lệ. https://t.co/3uBMpwZh3j
