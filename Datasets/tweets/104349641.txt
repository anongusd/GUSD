The police have re-purposed our public buses in Watertown for moving police &amp; &amp; civilians.
Word is the authorities want this bastard alive to see if they have any other accomplices or find out who trained them.
Locally we’re hearing that the brothers were probably planning more terrorist events based upon the weaponry that has been found.
Hospitals may be short-handed as day-shift employees may not be able to get there.
We’re hearing locally that the brothers were tossing grenades out the window of a carjacked Mercedes SUV at police in pursuit.
Police just detonated a suspicious device but no word as to whether it was a bomb. Harvard, MIT, BU, BC &amp; Emerson are all closed.
@PaulOD1 Correct. But there’s also talk locally as to who was giving them assistance in Cambridge &amp; Watertown.
We’re hearing the suspects never anticipated having their photos circulated, were throwing grenades &amp; military weapons at police.
The one suspect remaining at-large is only 19. They’ve lived here for at least one year, all according to the AP.
Just heard the suspects are BROTHERS and are Chechyan born.
@SteveTheOldMan Locally, we have NECN on but nationally we have Fox on.
@citrussage I’m sure. We retired at about 1:30 am, knew about the shoot-out on local news, but were told this was not connected.
