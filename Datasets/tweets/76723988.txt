@scottlay @krakowianin91 ROTFL.
@krakowianin91 @scottlay There was an issue with another Candidate‚Äôs application in AD 36. Recall rules in CA are weird to say the least and turnout was depressed because of the double-choice and June Primary. In a 2020 General Election with 2 extra years of Trump pulling voter reg left SD 29 will flip.
@scottlay @krakowianin91 Dem Districts by Voter Reg Held by GOP: #AD35, #AD36, #SD21, #SD 23, #SD29. Two of those are because of Steve Fox. One was because of dirty politics. And another will be an open seat previously represented by someone as crazy as Steve King. So AD 35 presents as the hardest get.
@scottlay Of course. @paulmitche11 estimated after 2018 that turnout in 2020 would 17 or 18% higher than 2018. I tend to be a bit more bullish and pegged it at 20% higher statewide. That can and will change after the 2020 March Primary when I can project General Turnout from TO history.
In my personal election projection algorithm that triangulates voter registration against the last election‚Äôs outcome and turnout against expected future turnout: AD 77 goes from the #1 Dem Offensive Target to the #8 Defensive Priority with a 2% swing from 51.5% D to 53.5% D. https://t.co/gHRrQWDWh6
