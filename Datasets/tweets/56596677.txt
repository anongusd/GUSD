@MichelleObama Have you read ‚ÄúBecoming‚Äù? I read it in one sitting. I love this girl: gritty, smart, funny, tenacious, good-hearted. I love when she dunks on B.O. Should fans rush the stage tonight and declare their love? Asking for a friend.

@derekreed Oh bless. I literally cannot even imagine. Please help us.
Self-correction: all the references to "you" should be replaced with "we." Christianese is my native tongue and I need to check my own self. Would I like you to handle your ish? YES, TWITTER. Also me too.
We just need to DO BETTER. Stop talking weird, coded, Christianese. It only sounds righteous to religious people. Be a human person, flesh and blood. Stop hiding behind words that protect your spiritual pride. You don't need to defend Jesus; you need to represent him.
Plus it is lazy. You know what takes spiritual maturity? Engaging in real conversations like a grown up. Caring for someone's soul and belovedness. Managing nuance. Listening like a brother or sister instead of a self-appointed headmaster. Jesus is on his own throne.
Defaulting to a cold recital of a verse in the face of someone's pain or identity or tension? You can miss me with that. None of it sounds like Jesus at all. It is designed to impress, to stay superior, to judge with a clear conscience, but the fruit of is rotten.
If you are well-versed enough, it can be strategically employed to ignore the dire pain of people, especially people for whom the sterile language harmed immeasurably. It lacks any tender spirit, any beating heart. Plus it sounds super weird. Why can't Christians talk normal?
One thing that "fell away" for me these last two years was my tolerance for weird Christian talk. It was my first language &amp; thus entirely familiar, but now it raises the hair on the back of my neck. It all feels coded, a warning signal to keep insiders in and outsiders out.
Text #1 to my assistant Amanda: "How do I fill out this W9?" Text #2: "Do you know my routing information?" So in summation: I am a diaper baby who doesn't know how to adult without Amanda, and Amanda could clean out all our accounts and write a tell all.
@LisaRWhittle @shannanwrites I do have a hotel lobby fascination if it is dark and cozy. If there is a fireplace, I am powerless against it.

"When the history books are written, they will say my dad was a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor." #43 The tears of the Bush family and the legacy of good character in the White House is moving me so much. We've lost so much.

Please pray for these children and their families, and all the folks on the border taking care of them. Pray for a miracle in our policy and in the hearts of our leadership to end this atrocity and reunite these families. God, we are begging.
"You asked me, friend, what my dreams are. Some day I'm going to have a wife and children; they'll be proud of their papi; I'm going to be a social worker, specializing with working with children." ~Oscar
"...but I'm good at languages, fluent in Spanish, and two indigenous languages I learned in my beloved Guatemala. I want to become a US citizen; I can't go back to Guatemala where there's so much corruption and the threat of death if you don't join a gang."
"I am so happy..I'm free! I'm smiling and laughing constantly. I want to sing and dance. I'm going to live with my brother in New York whom I haven't seen in four years. I know I have to improve my English which I began to learn these past two years..."
"...help in taking the necessary steps to obtain your bus ticket, free use of our personal cell phones to call your relatives at your destination, and a refuge where you can rest, eat, shower for a few hours, or remain overnight to travel tomorrow."
"Yet, I am so happy despite having been jailed for 2 years and 4 months. I am free, among new friends who tell me, 'Welcome', with smiles. 'We are here to help you: we can provide you with a back-pack filled with food &amp; hygiene items, clothes &amp; a blanket for the cold bus..."
"... before being dropped off at the Brownsville bus station, being manacled and leg chained on the trip from the detention center to the bus station."
"...We were treated like prisoners, surrounded by two very high cyclone fences topped by razor sharp triple strings of wire, confined for periods in a very cold chamber by violating rules of conduct, enduring a sleepless night without even a cup of coffee or cold tortilla..."
From Oscar: "Hello, my good Christian friends. I am a 16 year old Guatemalan male just released from the Port Isabel, Texas refugee detention center. My refugee friends and I refer to it as the 'detention center'; the center's director calls it a prison..."
"...And I ask that you would pour out your blessings on everyone and bless the food. I place in your blessed hands our family - I beg you to keep them in good health. Lord you know I only came for 3 hrs to work and not study. Amen." https://t.co/LLMc7RiI6v
"My Father and the Virgin of Miracles- I give thanks for another day of life, and I place in your hands these kids that are in the detention center. I ask that you get them out of here as fast as possible..." https://t.co/eT0YFGz0LM
"I ask for prayer for my family in Guatemala. May God protect them and bless them. I also ask God would help and protect me. That He would place his powerful hand on my case so that I could get out soon. Amen." https://t.co/vBy3pImQki
"...Father, bless my family and my country. Cover it with your precious blood. Bless them and cover them. Bless my girlfriend and my family." https://t.co/xPFCYrRhxL
"I give you thanks Lord for giving me one more day of life. Father, I ask you Lord to give me your power so that I can get out of here. Father, get me out of here..." https://t.co/KwTQOZac9K
The correspondence from the kids is very bleak. But we cannot look away. When this story is told 40 years from now and our grandchildren ask us what we did while refugee children were kept in camps, separated from their families as a punitive deterrent, we better have an answer.
This is our second trip down as we determine how we can serve these children, their families, the incoming refugees, the workers on the border, and the communities already caring for them.		I want you to be a part of this, and I will have more to say very soon.
Every Sunday at church just before communion, we read prayer cards written by children in the detention camp, first in Spanish then in English. It shatters me. I want to share some of them with you. Pray for these kids separated from their families. Prepare to love them with us.
With some of the warrior women from ANC, I am going to a humanitarian aid center on the border tomorrow. This suffering, on our watch and at our hands, is more than I can take. I pay attention to how the Holy Spirit moves me, and he is moving me toward this sorrow.
I am going to a detention center on the border tomorrow. The world feels like it is burning down, so here is a cute baby. #nephewlove We've got to shoehorn in the joy somewhere, somehow. Our hearts cannot become scorched earth or we will have no fight left in us. https://t.co/mQE4otE1kF

I got some stuff wrong with church folks &amp; have been working hard to repair. Saying "I'm so sorry" is the only way to make church work.

@joannagaines I mean honestly. This is the absolute sweetest. My kids have zero interest in my books except "what pages do you tell stories about us?" which I have to both disclose and... not disclose.
@AliceDaniels13 @BethMooreLPM @TheAlanNoble @between2worlds The longer I live, I find myself craving flesh and blood teachers, real life community, gritty church. I am wildly less interested in inaccessible, detached Christian academia plus its ancillary brawls. https://t.co/xyZ62cd507
@AliceDaniels13 @BethMooreLPM @TheAlanNoble @between2worlds Oh I see my emphasis was unclear: I am on the side of real life people. Life is hard and folks need help and hope. Academia, while important, can lock us away in ivory towers detached from real life. I get the impulse to look for counsel in the trenches instead of the tower.
@lauriecavin @BethMooreLPM @TheAlanNoble @between2worlds Please give her all my love. Her teen boy. Cannot imagine.
@BethMooreLPM @TheAlanNoble @between2worlds Nahum matters, but precious few make a living writing Christian books and studies and thus don‚Äôt have the luxury of devoting outsized energy toward hermeneutics when their marriages are falling apart and they can‚Äôt pay their electric bill.
@BethMooreLPM @TheAlanNoble @between2worlds This is the whole truth. I combed through one year of my social media discussions and comments to see what women need, &amp; it is this: How do I faithfully live this real life that is hard? This marriage, these kids, this career, these dreams &amp; losses. Missing: exegesis on Nahum.

@shannanwrites @__ijp Love. And I have two kids from Ethiopia who take GREAT DELIGHT in saying, "Ethiopia is the only country in Africa never colonized!" (There was a brief occupation by Italy which resulted in much pizza in Addis for which I've been grateful more than once.)
May our leadership continue to include more women, people of color, folks across the spectrum of sexuality, the differently abled, religious minorities, and system buckers. They will lead us to the better version of ourselves we are all missing right now.
I hope they are the best American generation yet. I can‚Äôt wait to see what they will accomplish that no generation before them had the humility and grit to do.
May we raise clear-eyed, wide awake children able to confess the sins of their country, recognize lingering inequity in our systems, and fight for justice and the dignity of their neighbors.
The natural end to a white-washed, polished understanding of American history is, at best, tone deaf patriotism in denial of the suffering it has wreaked and,  at worst, nationalism.
Grateful this morning for my son‚Äôs public school history teacher walking her students through the terrors embedded in American history, both here and around the world.
It is so sobering to face our sordid history of abuses. Not one teacher in my life ever suggested anything less than Manifest Destiny as a triumph.
Long talk with my boys this morning about colonization. They were connecting dots: WE were a colony (boo)...who fought for independence (yay)...but not before terrorizing &amp; displacing indigenous people (BOO). Made a list of all the countries &amp; cultures crushed by colonization.

@dobravis @ToriGlass I took it down. It was too charged and lacked nuance. It was unwise to reduce such a complex discussion of civic dissent to a tweet. I had broader ideas around it that I didn't include, so it was privileged and arrogant.

@prophiphop I have been thinking about this for days. Who cried for their forfeited day in court while their families buried them?
In this new world of "What is even true anymore?", I can tell you this: never, absolutely never would Jesus ever laugh at a woman's pain, mock it, parody it, misrepresent it, and incite the crowd to do the same. He disbanded the leering mob to their shame, never hers.

@dhoklahoma @GlennonDoyle It‚Äôs true. Our entire system is rigged toward the already wealthy and positioned. We need campaign finance reform, campaign time limits, and term limits so we can elect true public servants instead of career politicians.
@GlennonDoyle As you noted, sis, we are not well-represented. @KamalaHarris cannot do it by herself. We need to shore up her sisterhood in the elected official camp. Our elected women &amp; POC are swimming upstream. We need to help turn the tides w/ votes that count in the house &amp; senate.
@GlennonDoyle My good man shouldn‚Äôt pay for the sins of others. Wrong account to draw from. My sense: we are GROSSLY underrepresented, so focus our entire energy on getting women, POC, and even better, WOC in office. INSIST our representatives reflect their actual constituenty.

I am stunned how vulnerable Trump has left us - isolated us from our allies, aligned with our enemies, and American security, global leadership, and ideology placed on the altar of his own ego. We are watching the earth shift in real time. Be strong and courageous, friends.
"We ran a brilliant campaign and that is why I'm president." He will not ever be moved off this literally no matter what. He will never capitulate to Russian interference which means we are in the gravest danger for future meddling and the erosion of democratic ideals.
Trump will deny plain facts, reams of intel, &amp; unambiguous indictments on Russian interference simply because he doesn't want his victory tainted. His own ego will outrank American security 100 times out of 100. We are so unsafe with him in office. Unbelievable press conference.

@AliaJoyH @sethhaines Oh sister, not only do I hear you but I am learning. I entirely appreciate my sisters who point out my lingering blind spots. I really do. I sit at my desk and go: "Oh my gosh. She is totally right." Also, Torchy's green chili queso is undefeated in my opinion.
@AliaJoyH @cindy_w_brandt @sethhaines I hear you loud &amp; clear &amp; think you're absolutely right. Sometimes following a repentant leader already in your life is a good 1st step to following leaders from the margins. Starting from the belly of the beast often requires 25 steps. It has for me &amp; I still get it wrong.
The Home From College Son just picked up the Sophomore Son from school so they could go to the movies, and they didn't even tell me. Sometimes college fixes sib relationships.
@AliaJoyH @sethhaines This is a great point. It will be the work of my lifetime to uncover all the ways I center my own experience.
@AliaJoyH @sethhaines That's a fair critique. A better metaphor would be family welcoming, protecting, and defending the rest of their family. But even as none of this is new, this poll demonstrates a radical shift in the evangelical moral code in the last 7 years.
You want spiritual leaders? Look to the ones mourning and grieving and repenting right now. Run as fast as you can from the ones defending and justifying and denying. Let the refining fires burn it all down, even if there is but a fraction left. At least it will be pure.
Why are we having to convince our male leaders that women should be equally valued and their power is not at our expense? Why are we the least likely demographic to welcome refugees but the most likely to vote for Trump? We are lost. Any other version is a straight out lie.
The emperor is standing stark naked in the public square screaming through a bullhorn than he is dressed in finery. Absurd. We have one path here: repentance. We need to shut our loud mouths &amp; fall on our knees and repent to the Jesus we "love" and the people we've harmed.
The amount of repentance necessary to EVER regain 1 ounce of credibility as an evangelical community is just staggering. Look to our ditches: women, refugees, people of color, LGBTQ folks, immigrants, the poor. These are supposed to be our charges, instead they are our victims.
Burn everything down. We are as lost from our own gospel as we've ever been while screaming at everyone else that we are the only ones "found." Our women are abused and unprotected, and our "sanctuaries" are nothing of the sort. Why would anyone listen to any of us? https://t.co/k89J3nK576
I feel very distant from their complementarian theology but deeply connected to my sisters' pain. I remember. Frustratingly, it will have to be the men that turn the tides. The women can bang the drum, but the men hold the reins. I see you banging the drum, sisters.
I am no longer Baptist but I was raised by them, so watching this go down with Paige Patterson is sorrowful. This denomination feels like a Great Uncle in a state I used to live in, and I am so, so hoping he will do the right thing. I know he knows what it is. Do it.

@ScottyMc71 No. The difference is the number of guns in circulation here that are unregulated, unregistered, unrestrained, and unrestricted. That is the difference.
@ScottyMc71 Every other developed country has the same video games, movies, &amp; technology. They have proportional numbers of crime &amp; people with mental illness. The only difference is our gun culture; we're 25 times more likely to die from guns than people in other wealthy countries.
THOUGHT: America‚Äôs gun homicide rate is over 25 times the average of other high-income countries. Americans own 48% of the world's civilian-owned guns. PRAYER: I pray we vote out politicians beholden to their NRA money who deny plain facts &amp; blame the mentally ill &amp; video games.

@AngiePersing You are exactly right. Thank you for adding that community to the long list of non-centered people.
That is where you go. That is who you stand with. That is where you learn. That is where you will flourish, because that is real life and THAT is worth your whole life.
If it is not Good News for women, for POC, for the LGBTQ community, for the immigrant, for the poor, THEN IT IS NOT GOOD NEWS. The fruit will tell you: where is life? Look hard, because there is Jesus.
Where is life? Where is human flourishing? It may shock us to discover it in the margins, on the edges, not in the voices of the same old power brokers but in their victims, their targets, their underlings, their tokened props.
Plenty of death contributes to life for a homogenous, privileged few: voice, safety, inclusion, representation, leadership, equality, fair wages, potential, authority, truth, possibility. If the Flourishing Few all look the same, then notice who is paying the tab. Someone is.
If human flourishing in any context - a church, a denomination, a business structure, the justice system - is homogenous, then that is not life; that is privilege and someone else is paying for it by dying.
Conversely, when those "flourishing" are primary in one category - mostly white, mostly men, only straight people, only those with money, mainly those with power - we must pay attention, because that is at the expense of someone else. That is not life but death.
I read of a priest asked about what is godly and what is not - How do we discern between good &amp; bad? What about when Christians disagree on that answer? - and he said, "I look for where there is life." When people are flourishing &amp; valued &amp; honored &amp; restored, there is Jesus.

@lizdyer I interviewed Sara Cunningham on the podcast today. Your Mom Army is really something, Liz. Thank you for being a force for love. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@lizdyer This is so, so, so, so dear. I am very grateful you brought this back to my attention. Last year, everything was so loud and insane and it all got swept into a black hole...the good and the bad. Thank you for reminding me of this radical kindness. So much love to you, sister.
@HewlettAndrew Do I ever! You two hooligans made me laugh every single day. Also, do you realize I was 22 years old? I was a baby teacher. I was 12 years older than you guys.

Also while we're at it, @brandonhatmaker and I are unequally yoked on our understanding of FTW. Because I am precious and godly, I maintain that it means "for the win." How dear! How encouraging! Because he is a dangerous biker, he insists it means "%*#! the world."

I can never, literally never remember what "tbh" means. This very minute I cannot imagine what it is although I am using all my mind powers. Yes I could google it, but that feels too hard. I keep wanting to say "shaking my head" but my English degree tells me that is inaccurate.

Grab your kids and join your city's march. The mass shooting generation wants to end this deadly culture for our kids and their kids and their kids. It's time. Enough is enough. I'm with them. Find your @AMarch4OurLives here: https://t.co/RAvo4Ozwao
They are smart and serious, and only a fool would dismiss them. They get a seat at this table since they were the ones huddled in closets while their classmates were gunned down by yet another mass shooter.
They are not powerless. Half of them will vote in midterms and the rest will vote in the next presidential election. They've managed to organize a march in every state in the US. They are on the cover of TIME. They were featured in all their fire and eloquence on 60 Minutes.
They are demanding better from the adults meant to protect them, &amp; I'm with them. They are demanding more from their gov't supposed to regulate tools of violence, &amp; I'm with them. They're demanding change from their reps beholden to the NRA above public safety, &amp; I'm with them.
...and it turns out to be a bunch of high school kids tired of doing "lockdown drills" and attending their classmates' funerals.		I'm with them.
...I realized that the kids are showing up and doing what adults have either been unwilling or unable to do. We've been waiting for SOMETHING or SOMEONE to finally break through, to finally move the needle forward...
@AMarch4OurLives I've spilled a million words over gun violence &amp; mass shootings already, so this is us putting our feet to work.

So much credit and gratitude to the law enforcement network in Austin for working around the clock to track down the bomber that has been terrorizing our city for three weeks. Grieving the loss of Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason and praying for the other four injured.
@shannanwrites I feel shattered. I know every word of this is true.
@JoeJTogs @MerrillLaura What a phenomenal preacher and leader. We love her.
@shannanwrites And hilariously, when I write about church, everyone is like I WANT TO COME TO YOUR CHURCH, but I know they'd get there and be like: this is just sort of medium. Because church IS sort of medium and unsexy and ordinary and uncool. Which is why you and I love it.
@CulturalSavage It's not weird at all. I think we're made to crave and flourish in this kind of faith community. Too many overdrafts have made the account hard to trust, but we still dream of spiritual abundance.
...hang on for dear life. That messy, kind of lame, rag-tag bunch of folks just might save your life too.
Church and Christians can so strangely keep us from Jesus, but if you find a faith community that feels like the gospels and prioritizes our neighbors and sticks together even though their leaders are just medium and stuff goes sideways...
...and bring it all down to the ground, into the streets, around the table, &amp; to its knees, church can be the most healing, life transformative place to meet the real Jesus...the one who loves us all &amp; upended power structures &amp; valued every outcasted person made in His image.
But if we take the idea of "church" out of its weird, fancy, western context, out of the realm of entertainment, off the pedestal of perfect leaders/shiny living, away from the barely disguised goal of self-help, apart from the evil of protected hierarchy &amp; exclusionary doctrines
Listen, church is the most imperfect thing I can think of. It is. It can wound as much as it heals, and it sometimes shuts its doors when Jesus bid us "go to the street corners and invite anyone you can find." It gets much wrong because people lead it and we are a historic mess.
Our whole lobby was filled with shoes and supplies you sent from all over the US for our homeless friends on Easter...we literally got another UPS shipment during church.
@colbymartin Another woman came for the first time in years and told me, "I thought I was no longer a Christian because I departed from my fundamentalist upbringing, and they told me I wasn't. But I am. I think I just haven't found the right room." So she bravely came to church alone.
A young gay man came alone bc after being an atheist, he found Jesus 2 weeks ago in the pages of our friend @ColbyMartin's book, Unclobbered, &amp; can't believe how radically his soul is changing. (Being loved by Jesus &amp; His people will rearrange your spiritual DNA, that's a fact.)
Yesterday, two women led worship, a female assistant Superintendent preached, two women led the prayer team, and a woman gave communion.
THREAD: Going to church is saving my life right now. Now mind you, ours is a specific kind of church. Really simple and inclusion-y and Methodist-y (&lt; that will make sense to the Methodists).
@DanielM89245832 A Hispanic woman and two white men were injured. Different parts of the city. The latest apparently detonated by a trip wire. Sophisticated and scary.
Austin is so rattled after a FOURTH package bomb today. Two men killed, and one woman and two more men seriously injured. No leads. No suspects. Such a brutal, cowardly crime. Asking God for swift justice.

@JessicaNTurner You look so beautiful, dear one.
@DrAaronNew It is that plain and simple.
So in answer to my teen, all I said was: "I know, baby. It's true. The real version is way lamer than the Twitter version." Bless us. Humans are so disappointing. It's rough when you figure that out about your parents around 17.
Somehow Jesus keeps me enough on the rails to not totally self-destruct. You better believe that if I ever do the right thing, it is because Jesus is in my ear. That's it. That's my only hope. He is the only sincerely good thing I have. Thank God He loves us all so much.
I have said it and I mean it: the only good thing in me is Jesus. I swear to God (his father). I know it. I'm under no delusions. Left alone to my own devices, I'm gross and judgmental and selfish. Jesus is the singular reason I have any thing good going on.
If anyone "changed your life," I guarantee they let ten people down to the same degree. Our kids know the score. They live with the real version. They see us when we are mean and boring and hypocritical.
Listen, don't believe the hype: not mine, not your own, not anyone's. It's all a version of the truth. We're not that great. We're not that shiny. We are way lazier and more selfish and petty than what you see.
Can't quit thinking about my kid who told me last week I wasn't as great as everyone said. Besides teenagers being delightful, here is the other thing: totally true. I'm not.

@kylemarklantz @joysmackme @anjelahjohnson I hear what you're saying for sure. Understandable &amp; fair. In Anjelah's case, part of her routine is characters/accents (she is Mexican &amp; does her fair share of humor in that space too). She does a spot on white girl impression too. Does comedy occupy its own social space?
@tylerreagin @anjelahjohnson I'd love to interview you, Tyler! My next series is "Women Who Built It"...so maybe not that one.

@peteenns That article was absurd from start to finish. Chum in the water for the TGC crowd. Forget that I'm a full-time vocational minister, that I literally just flew home from teaching the Bible all week. I am not a sister in Christ but a "deconvert." What a lazy, unresearched piece.

@BaptistActivist They are tame when voided of their context. "Only love can drive out fear" is lovely. But apply it to the intentional, organized fight against ongoing racism and you will receive a difference response.
I end with the question posed by MLK: "Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremist for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?" It's one or the other. Silence supports the former. Let's build the world we want to pass on.
What are we afraid of? Someone being mean to us?? COME ON, FOLKS. We have to made of sturdier stock than that. Exposing tension is not causing it, no matter what the gatekeepers say. You have two good feet: stand on them. You will not die from someone else's discomfort.
Which side of this do we want to be on? When we're 95 yrs old, what do we want to say we fought for? Did we side with equality, justice, &amp; the common good? Did we? Did we put our words &amp; hands to good use? Did we call out racism though it would be called a "temper tantrum"?
MLK was one of the greatest teachers and activists that ever lived. His devastating social analysis was precise, clear, and accurate. His call toward peace and equality was precise, clear, and accurate. He represented truth among lies that were masked by religion.
Most of the tame MLK quotes we'll see today can be easily co-opted to describe a feel-good society where little black boys and girls can hold hands and act nice. But we cannot extrapolate his words from the racist, bigoted structures into which they were spoken.
When resistance is packaged as "hate," then justice is let off the hook. It is an old trick, but one that still works in the ongoing fight toward equality. Those who resist simply have to reject that outrage entirely. White people only loved MLK after he was murdered.
The onus is shifted toward a negative peace (masked in righteousness, which is where it gets its free pass) and off the specific racism that undermines POC and embeds our culture with greater white supremacy allowed to live in the open.
Just today in calling out Trump's racism, a lady sent this: "We get it Jen, you hate Trump. If you want to share and spread Christ‚Äôs love, please do so! Stop spreading hatred. Those of us who disagree with you politically will not be persuaded by your temper tantrums."
King's understanding of the white moderate and while fragility have instructed me this year more than any other teacher. The white response to exposed racial tension is predictable and precise. It is the same today as in 1963...with a slightly different face.
"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"...it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, &amp; without this ‚Äòhard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, knowing that the time is always ripe to do right." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability..." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"We who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"...who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man‚Äôs freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ‚Äúmore convenient season.‚Äù #MLK #BirminghamJail
"...who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action..." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen‚Äôs Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äúorder‚Äù than to justice..." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"For years I have heard the word ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‚ÄúWait‚Äù has almost always meant ‚ÄòNever.‚Äù We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‚Äújustice too long delayed is justice denied.‚Äù #MLK #BirminghamJail
"Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was ‚Äúwell timed‚Äù in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation." #MLK #BirminghamJail
"Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light &amp; voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals." #MLK

Church leader, if a member comes forward with a story of abuse by another pastor, you get one chance to do the right thing. ONE. There is only one just path through this process, and if you abdicate to save face, you double down on the harm and forfeit your integrity too.
@DennisOwen2020 That is exactly right. There may be a future path for abusers to pay their debt legally and repent, but church leadership is a grave responsibility and abusers forfeit their place in it. It is a consequence enforced in other industries without hesitation.
The church's instinct to harbor and shield abusers at the expense of their victims is baffling. If there was any place on earth where victims should be safe, defended, and vindicated, it should be the House of Jesus. I suspect women will lead the way here. #riseup #churchtoo
This was not a "sexual incident." It was a crime. It should have been treated as a crime both inside &amp; outside the church. This is not a gray area. Outside of legal repercussions, as a sexual abuser (or his protector), you should positively lose the privilege to lead a church.
These are the exact reasons why #churchToo will struggle to emerge. The "internal" path back to good standing always benefits the abuser in power both in the short term and long term. Leaders who silence the abused and protect the abuser are just as complicit. https://t.co/9hkdM3sxBN

@MelissadArabian @anniefdowns @matt_lehman The 2 areas in publishing that default the quickest to templates &amp; overused trends are cover design &amp; titling (&amp; DEFINITELY subtitling).

@anniefdowns @matt_lehman I have given this advice 100 times. I practically put the finished cover in my designer's lap before they create a single comp. Designers are working on 50 projects at once. It will either be your vision that makes the cover or theirs. Give them vision!

@boomama @LisaRWhittle @shannanwrites @UnexpectedMel @scrivener I am such a baby dumb dumb about the internet and having a job that requires the internet. The only reason I know anything at all is because @kristenhowerton and @JessicaNTurner constantly teach me their tricks.
@boomama @scrivener I think y'all know I am prepared to give up on basically anything, so if YOUR FRIEND JEN is telling you that the tutorial labor is worth the ease of writing in *an actual writing program*...you know this is not a lie.

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.		Jesus is literally everything.
He might not be found in the bright shiny light of expectations but in the humble, gritty places we didn‚Äôt bargain for.
It is in our dark night of the soul the Light of the World can be seen most clearly. Seek him. Look for him. Ask for eyes to see. Let your soul direct its attention to the manger of your story...not the palace.
It‚Äôs not that most of Israel wasn‚Äôt looking for him...they ALL were...it is that they didn‚Äôt recognize the way he came.
But Jesus came as the Light of the World, and light was made for darkness, but nobody was looking there - no one was looking for a manger; they were looking for a throne.
Advent also reminds us that most missed Jesus because they were looking for him in the bright, shiny lights of power, politics, &amp; revolution.
Advent reminds us to wait well, to be found faithful and watching and believing for resurrection, no matter how broken something is.
If this is the way he did it, if Jesus came in a manger born to the poor and announced to shepherds, you can trust that He will never stop showing up. He is here to stay for the good of his people.
Perhaps Advent for you this year looks like holding tight to hope before it is fully realized. Believing that Jesus will show up because He promised to, even if the timing is obscured.
Why not during captivity? Why not during the destruction of Jerusalem? Why not while under evil leadership? WHERE IS OUR SAVIOR? WHY NOT NOW? We understand deeply the pain of waiting for Jesus to redeem our pain, the agony of wondering when He will come.
Like Israel, we have our Scriptures...we can read plainly that Jesus is a healer, redeemer, that He is powerful and good. We might identify with the Israelites during any number of horrors they endured while they waited. They suffered in numerous ways for centuries.
This Advent, like the first one, some of us are waiting for Jesus to show up too. Maybe we‚Äôve endured more than ever though possible, and we long for the end of our suffering. We need Jesus to come and make it all new.

We're really going to have to fight for Advent in our hearts this year. We'll have to believe the upside ways of Jesus will truly reign more than what the news &amp; Twitter tells us https://t.co/2uSNg4rKvK. We must believe Jesus more. We go to the manger; not the empire.
@TrevinWax Love this idea of Mary singing this to her children.
Advent invites us back to the manger, the beginning of the end we‚Äôre all hungry for, in whom all things started and ultimately all things will end in peace and glory and victory.
But my greatest hope is that if Jesus came back this afternoon, he'd find a people with lives marked by peace, not power...by clean hands, not filthy corruption...by goodness, by advocacy, by tenderness, a people trying to live in the kingdom Jesus came to that manger for.
Peter told us to make every effort to be found by God in peace, which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we aren‚Äôt sad or confused or further away than we wished. Waiting is hard and the suffering in the mean time is no small endurance.
We stretch our arms out to our neighbors, refusing to live by a ‚Äúme and mine‚Äù philosophy but also ‚Äúyou and yours‚Äù and ‚Äúthem and theirs‚Äù...the baby in the manger made this a ‚Äúwe‚Äù community, summoning us where we were previously uninvited.
This Advent, may we be found faithful in our wait, even as we wish for all things to be beautiful and holy and good again. We must have the language of justice and kindness and community in our mouths.

As such Advent can, if we let it, disorient us from the dominant culture's experience and expression of "Christmastime" and its many ways to ignore or domesticate the wild prophet, Jesus, loudspeaker and embodiment of this world's end and God's reign coming upon us.
Advent lays before us starkly their usually silenced voices, the voices of prophets who speak to them from God, and the assurance that indeed the worlds that try to keep them silenced for their own benefit have only one future -- utter destruction and replacement by God's reign.
Advent reminds us that the good news we seek, indeed the only really good news there is, is precisely for them and those of us among them, and becomes good news for all only in their redemption.
...know in their bodies and often carry in their psyches for generations wounds and scars that give a very different testimony. Advent tunes us in to their voices.
Those who hold power find ways to make their disordered reigns seem normal or even good. But those damaged by such disordered reigns-- the silent or silenced ones including the poor, the sick, the dying, the outcast, the hungry and the persecuted, among others...
In Advent we see, decisively, how God's reign marks the breakdown and end of every other reign. What the biblical writers knew, and we still know, is that every human reign is disordered, sinful, full of injustice and oppression.
Advent puts Christmas into its proper place, not as a comforting destination or early winter way station, but rather as nothing less than the completely disruptive in-breaking of the God who, through this birth, makes all things new.
@BethMooreLPM Which is where we see responses like "women should be glad they have a couple of seats at the table now" and "people of color should be grateful for their salaries." This WE gave YOU an inch and you should be happy for it is demonic.
@KristiWalker96 I feel the exact same way. Specifically, the evangelical support of evil, deception, sexual abuse, misogyny, racism, and nationalism has broken my heart.

Let the reckoning reign: https://t.co/1k8J6ALpEG
This reckoning of sexual abuse is such a broken hallelujah. Let justice reign: every party, every church, every workplace, every home. Let abusers tremble in their boots. Let the abused raise their voices. We believe you. No excusing, explaining, diminishing. Justice for all.

@rachelheldevans @BreneBrown You do this exceptionally well, Rach. Better than most. I am always moved and emboldened by your truth telling ethos. And it always feels measured enough to be sustainable.

@jeffchu Small potatoes, but your work has found a rightful home in my heart and it has mattered. I‚Äôve read more of your words than you know, and they have affected me, my theology, and my leadership.
@brandonhatmaker and I are at the movies with 7 children. Consider our seatmates: they neither toiled nor spun for this hardship at this fancy lounge chair theater, yet I tell you not even Solomon himself would put up with this crap. #sorryeveryone

@JeffersonBethke @BreneBrown We have to weigh popularly everywhere: with publishers, readers, industry gatekeepers, and colleagues whose fingers keep the scale tipped with their endorsement (or lack thereof). Maintaining popularity is the death knell of integrity. Worth the cost but hard.
@JeffersonBethke @BreneBrown Our niche industry tends to elevate a very homogenous voice: white, mostly male, women who don‚Äôt upset the power differential we‚Äôve come to count on (white, conservative, straight, Republican). That cost is less visible but deeply affects ‚Äúcommercial success.‚Äù
@JeffersonBethke @BreneBrown In the small world of evangelical subculture, there is also the cost of going against the grain with your colleagues. Friends who cheered my last book like mad wouldn‚Äôt have my name in their mouths this year (or barely).
@prophiphop @BethMooreLPM @MichaelRWear @BreneBrown  https://t.co/RSxXTcZdXt
@MichaelRWear @BreneBrown You sure can. The cost there is exponentially higher. Those men and women rightly know they could lose tithes, members, and even their jobs. I have this secret conversation with scared clergy every single week. Only certain "truth" is acceptable in most pulpits.
@BethMooreLPM @prophiphop @BreneBrown It's true, Prop. Time to admit you are developing a love for white female Texans. Resistance is futile. We can all cook too.
@BreneBrown So writers &amp; creators, you are not pop stars. Do work you love with integrity, generosity, &amp; focus. Say &amp; make things that matter. Don't look to a commercial bottom line to tell you anything at all. Do work you are proud of that tells the truth. It will find its rightful home.
@BreneBrown I gladly hustle for the actual work, the connection with readers, the dissemination of good ideas &amp; truths, &amp; the love of Jesus. But hustling for lists &amp; winning over finicky readers &amp; making powerful folks happy: nope. Holding steady in this torrent of consumerism is labor.
@BreneBrown We can be faithful to our partners &amp; their investment while still prioritizing good, clean, true work. My suspicion is that folks are craving words that matter more than ever. Plus, the hustle will kill everything good and pure and sincere in us. It is not sustainable.
@BreneBrown The labor here feels obvious, because there is one way to write for commercial success &amp; another way to write true, hard things. There is a cost to this. But the cost of my own integrity is higher, and I am unwilling to pay it. Let's say things that matter, mass success aside.
@BreneBrown "We don't need to beat this book or the next. We need to be proud of our contribution &amp; find a life that is sustainable." It changed me. I flipped a switch. I'm here to write &amp; lead in ways I can be proud of in 40 years. The end. Thank you, @BreneBrown. You're a good sister.
@BreneBrown @BreneBrown told me this: "You go into the studio and make the music you have in you. Sometimes it is a commercial success and sometimes it is a personal miracle. But we're not pop stars. We're in it for the long haul. Not a string of #1's that don't mean anything to us..."
@BreneBrown Having experienced success on my last book &amp; in the middle of singing for my supper on the current one, worn out &amp; bearing the responsibility of the heavy investment so many made in me, I told @BreneBrown I didn't think I could keep the "success trajectory" upward &amp; I was beat.
I was recently discussing "commercial success" &amp; its crushing weight of expectations, rules, &amp; inevitable disappointment w/ @BreneBrown. I know, I know..Christian writers aren't supposed to care or notice or succumb to this pressure. We do. The expectations of others are real.

@KSPrior @andygarber1 @SkyeJethani @spulliam @drmoore Agreed. To the "gun reform or heart reform" debate, I say yes &amp; yes. We also must examine our complicity in a violence-worshipping culture.
@KSPrior @daniel_brockway @SkyeJethani @spulliam @drmoore This is a really important part of the thread. It is not difficult to follow the money trail. The power of the @NRA is disproportionate.
@KSPrior @andygarber1 @SkyeJethani @spulliam @drmoore Of course, but responsible gun ownership is a straw man here. Our culture of gun violence and death is the very definition of wrong.
@nicholenordeman Who could have ever imagined this? We live in the Twilight Zone of Christianity right now.
@AnnaLeeLink @GartrellLinda Lol. Thanks for the link to Breitbart.
@KSPrior @SkyeJethani @spulliam @drmoore Of course, most advocates for gun control are not suggesting that owning a gun is wrong.
I'd love to see the whole election/campaign system overhauled. Spending caps, a much shorter campaign season, and clean elections.
At this point, only the rich and powerful run our country or control those who do. Both parties operate like a country club back room.
Campaign reform would solve many of our issues with garbage representation. Leaders could govern fairly instead of kowtowing to money.
If our representatives weren't essentially on the payroll of their greatest donors, we'd lay the axe at the root of the tree.

I admire your courage and pray that Jesus takes you by surprise today. If only in the breaking of bread, passing of the peace, bowing of the head, even just walking in the door, I hope you taste a bit of redemption, even resurrection today.
Sending an extra dose of love to everyone thinking about trying church again today. If you are scared or angry or leery or hurt but somehow still drawn to a gathering of people looking for God, know that I prayed specifically for you this morning.

@BethMooreLPM @YouNeedJesus I've said this before, but good thing Keith &amp; my dad aren't on Twitter either (like they ever would be). They'd suffer exactly 0 fools.
@_Matt_Carter Children who wore shorts to church did not have proper parents. My grandma gave a HARD PASS on clapping in church too. #nope
@_Matt_Carter Neither would mine of course! Hard core Southern Baptists, bro. Thought us "dancing at some Prom" was pretty sketchy too.
@YouNeedJesus My grandpa would want to weigh in too. Here is how he feels about internet nonsense. He wants everyone to go back to work: https://t.co/Agma0ONHeC
@_Matt_Carter Yep! My maiden name. We have a ton of family in OK. Where is your family from? If we are related, you might want to pour your kin a drink.
@YouNeedJesus Here is a picture of Grandma King, and I think you can see she is not here for our shenanigans: https://t.co/yFfKs04DQb
@YouNeedJesus Frankly, we all have enough business to mind. LET'S JUST MIND IT. Do your work. Put your head down. Stop gossiping and craning our necks.
If Grandma had a twitter handle, it would be @NoTimeForYourDamnNonsense. It would also be @YouNeedJesus. Her hashtag is #MindYourBusiness
JESUS, TAKE THESE FOOLS AND DO YOUR BEST LORD. Smite their phones and nosy nonsense! Where are their mothers?? Grandma would say that.
I'd explain to G-ma that the internet is largely fake outrage with little bearing on real life, but she would've already given it to Jesus.
She would shake her head at our obsession with schauenfreude &amp; garbage news &amp; gossip. My Grandpa would say we were "a bunch of damn fools."
Grandma would probably suggest that we get our noses out of everyone else's business and do something useful. Make a pie. Trim some beans.
Grandma wants to know DO ANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS? Does this world have enough drama w/o creating additional crap &amp; twittering it?
My Grandma King might point out that most of the internet appears to be Nosy Nellies who love to gossip, speculate, mock, and troll.
If my Grandma King was alive today with a Twitter account, I think she'd scroll for 3 minutes and say YALL MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

@SHoddeMiller Super interesting correlation. I positively did not get that message growing up, and now I sometimes fight straw men that are dead to me.
@shannanwrites Yes. Key distinction is separating "humility" with "fake shame-based humility." Does that make sense? I grew up with such spiritual shame.
@shannanwrites @kjjbrowning Yes. There is a lot of nuance here, &amp; I'm still pondering "victory." I see it well outside success/platforms. Something about possibility.

@melodyedr Nope. These are the results of faithful gay Christians "working the program" as prescribed &amp; still ending up in sorrow, despair, &amp; shame.
Jesus gave us that clue: When we are not sure, look to the fruit. The fruit doesn't lie. Good fruit tells a good story of Good News.
If the natural end to a doctrine is not consistently leading to whole, healthy, vibrant lives in Christ, something is wrong with it.
Holding up one rare good apple from a bad tree does not undo the thousands of ruined apples laying on the ground, plainly evident.
If the fruit of doctrine regularly &amp; consistently creates shame, self-harm, suicide, &amp; broken hearts, families, &amp; churches, we shld listen.
I believe in Jesus and his ways because it has saved my life and thousands of people I know. It redeems everything. Heals what is broken.
I believe in the natural end game to good theology: hope, wholeness, recovery, delivery, freedom, joy. Literally why I believe in Jesus.
The fruit of the "Nashville Statement" is suffering, rejection, shame, and despair. The timing is callous beyond words.

@rachelheldevans @theboyonthebike Went against 2000 years of holy tradition. I still can't believe the courage to believe Jesus at his word.
@rachelheldevans @theboyonthebike Galatians is so fierce. Paul laid into PETER in defense of grace and inclusion. Saved the early church for the rest of us.
RT @Reebok: In case you were wondering when it IS appropriate to say, "You're in such good shape...beautiful,"... THIS: https://t.co/Z1cnnR‚Ä¶
Jesus, give us the courage and conviction of Paul in a world that prefers to close the table. Let us not bow to fear and neuter the gospel.
Church, in any way we‚Äôve been complicit for harm, abuse, supremacy, exclusion, we repent. God forgive us. Brothers &amp; sisters, forgive us.
We repent for the demonic illusion that we are gatekeepers of salvation instead of sinners saved by the grace of Jesus alone.
We repent for insisting on circumcision over the cross, for fearing criticism more than loving our neighbor.
We repent for every time we made a deal with the devil to protect our own power, for betraying our gospel for 30 pieces of silver.
We repent of our arrogance, our pride, our white supremacy, our bigotry, xenophobia, homophobia, nationalism, fear-mongering, cowardice.
For anyone we shamed, ignored, neglected, shunned, silenced, abused...the only godly response from the church of Jesus is repentance.
Let it not be said of us that we closed the table to keep the establishment happy. That is not a legacy worthy of Jesus who bid us all come.
"He was afraid of criticism..." Church, let us not forsake the table of Jesus and all its welcomed members OUT OF FEAR OF CRITICISM.
Fear of rejection is no joke. Aligning with the outliers is no joke. Widening the table is no joke. Challenging systems is no joke.
It wasn't until Jewish Christians came who "insisted" on circumcision that Peter got rattled. Challenging the establishment is no joke.
What's more, he ate with gladness around an inclusive table, Jewish and Syrian believers alike. He understood his grace. And theirs.
It's Peter than interests me here. He KNEW the Gentiles were welcomed. Cornelius and visions and Jesus taught him that. He KNEW it.
They aren't doing it right, they aren't following our rules right, they don't honor our laws right. And the table closes.
Fear of being associated w/ the unworthy, the others, the less holy..it has always been a thing. From the earliest church, we see its snare.
"Peter wouldn't eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision."
"When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile believers, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when friends of James came..."
"When Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong..."
I'm preaching on Galatians 2 tomorrow, and it has been instructive &amp; challenging &amp; relevant this week, as the Bible always is. From the NLT:
God's work would be so much easier if He didn't have to use human beings. #jackassspeaking https://t.co/2UALMnikcE

@rachelheldevans Then you also remember you are about to get it back marked up to shreds.
Gavin is home from a month-long internship &amp; the whole house just went bonkers. Brothers stampeding, tackling him on the lawn. Pandemonium.
@BethMooreLPM I just guffawed. I was supposed to deliver a 10-minute set up to baptism at church Sunday and I gave a 45-minute sermon on its NT history.
Nonetheless, anger got me nowhere except the Crazy Train. Here it is, Jesus. I have some ideas for justice if you want them. But you do you.
Jesus gives forgiveness to everyone no matter how awful they are, which is why Jesus is the WORST when you're mad.
I just lit a candle and said to Jesus, "I don't want to carry this anymore." I know He won't show up in the petty way I was hoping though.
So to you also stuck in your own prison of unforgiveness, let's just lay it down. Give it to Jesus &amp; walk away. Let him run His own show.
Ultimately, I can either keep having fake conversations out loud in my car (that I am winning) or I can forgive &amp; get my life back.
The lie: "You should wait for an apology." The truth: "It may never come." GREAT NOW WHAT. Forgiveness is a one-man show.
I know the keys out of the prison of unforgiveness: prayer, empathy, confession, humility. EVERYTHING THAT'S HARD. So here I sit in my cell.
I've already practiced this discipline a million times, and it is still hard. Forgiveness is some of the most stubborn spiritual work.
The imaginary confrontations, the mental loop that won't stop - the only person paying the price is me.
Guys, I am struggling to forgive somebody, and it is eating me up inside. Bitterness is such a vicious root. So stubborn and poisonous.
@Ash_Pittman I'm really sorry. I've been called those things too. It never doesn't hurt. But that Jesus life makes the cost worth it.

@KatelynBeaty @kscharold @rachelheldevans @KSPrior This position assumes godliness in (white) Christian credentialed men and recklessness in women w/ a voice. It's an uncharitable straw man.
@KatelynBeaty @kscharold @rachelheldevans @KSPrior "Male church leaders still often derive authority from theological education, ordination, and institutions. By contrast..."
@rachelheldevans @KSPrior @KatelynBeaty This binary suggestion that integrity and authority is either academic/faithful or charisma/shallow is absurd. Incredibly gendered too.
@rachelheldevans @KSPrior @KatelynBeaty It's an easy swipe at integrity and intelligence. The caricature of me is uniformed and unfair and breezily dismisses 20 years of ministry.

God can't develop us while we are lying or lying for someone else. Tell the truth. Let the truth bear out. Let God handle his own people.
Conversely, no boundaries lie. They say: This is not harmful, not happening, not unhealthy, not your problem. Thus, no reason to change.
Boundaries simply tell the truth: "This behavior is toxic &amp; won't be tolerated anymore." A path to transformation far more than enabling.
Remember: boundaries aren't a controlling tool. They enforce what YOU are willing or not willing to accept. They are for you 1st, them 2nd.
Boundaries are not cruel or unfair. They are loving - preferring spiritual/emotional health over appearances or the absence of tension.
Letting others reap what they sow is how people grow. Personal responsibility is incredibly sanctifying. Stop paying someone else's bill.
Potential boundaries w/ a toxic person/place: don't excuse, don't cover, leave, tell the truth, say no, stop making it easy, let chips fall.
Healthy boundaries mean we stop reaping what someone else is sowing &amp; negative consequences affect the right person. https://t.co/egHp5bVWor

Beautiful words from my beautiful friend @sarahbessey. Sing it from the mountaintops, girl. https://t.co/EbcmbdO4Co
A lack of fear does not require inaction or neutrality. We can lead well, stand strong, and honor Jesus. We have to. Who else will?
We do not need more people with their hair on fire right now. Look for the fearless leaders with sound, strong minds. Be that leader.
Pay attention to your intake: is it feeding your fear or feeding your God-given power and sobriety? Guard your mind. Curate wisely.
The people of Jesus should commit wholeheartedly to reject fear right now. Stop listening to it, stop spewing it. Strength, sound minds.
Fear sounds hysterical and panicked and chaotic. It leads us so poorly. What does power, love, and a sound mind sound like? Strength.
God gave us a spirit of power and love and a sound mind, not fear. We need sound minds right now. This country is starving for sound minds.
Fear cannot lead us out, up, or forward. It sets our feet on the wrong path. Resist and reject it with your whole heart &amp; mind.
Fear is a liar and cannot be trusted. It never leads to health or wholeness. It is literally not of God. Don't believe its lies.

@Runaway_Writes No one really has totally clean hands. Even outside of fake news, there is biased news which should also be called to task.
I unfollowed a few clearly biased news sources (on both sides). My own outrage can be easily inflamed.
And as citizens &amp; readers, we have to substantiate what we read and curate our sources better. Peddling half-truths causes societal harm.
Media, do not give us half-baked stories with unconfirmed sources &amp; feed us suppositions/exaggerations. Give us plain, substantiated facts.
Bipartisan wish: less slanted media in general. The entire media predicted a Trump loss, which speaks of bias. Fox News=bias. Do better.

@BethMooreLPM Well, you know how we can be over here in Austin. I once sat by a hipster couple downtown whose baby was named "Avocado."
Just saw a food truck in downtown Austin for "vegan fried chicken" and my soul died a little bit. Come quickly, Lord.

Aleppo makes us feel helpless, but we're NOT. Feed Syrians thru @preemptivelove. Supplies run out on Christmas: https://t.co/xldc4iEzzL
Here is how we help Aleppo. Go here &amp; help feed them, &amp; then pray for Jeremy &amp; the @preemptivelove team. Heroes. https://t.co/ruZZB7Q0GZ
We have to do more than feel sad. We can't just pray &amp; post on Twitter. @preemptivelove is on the ground in Aleppo. No other aid orgs there.
How can we show up for Aleppo? We can help @preemptivelove feed and shelter the victims: https://t.co/Nk759uHSYp
He and his team are feeding and providing sleeping bags for 25K people a day. At this rate, their supplies run out on Christmas Day.
Called Jeremy Courtney with @preemptivelove in Aleppo this morning: "Tell us what to do. Tell us how to help."

@elizabethesther I remember thinking with perfect clarity that 50 was basically elderly. Like, great-grandmother elderly. I am 42.
@bibledude The mouth speaks out of the overflow of the heart, yes, but the internet provides a safe covering to speak without listening.
@bibledude I think it is something between the two. But the internet creates echo chambers, pile-ons, groupthink, and mob tendencies.
Jesus stole away from the crowds often, &amp; we'd do well to emulate that. The table, the walking paths, the fishing boat - so much real life.
Real life &amp; real relationships are rarely as reduced, exaggerated, sensationalized, or definitive as the internet suggests. Nor as hateful.
The internet is full of outrage and hit pieces, but real life is full of real life. Let's not confuse the two. Be faithful in real life.
You know what I mean? There is the actual thing, then just what everyone is saying about the thing. Who cares? Attend to the actual thing.
Among other things, Advent is reminding me the Internet world is largely fake &amp; full of straw men. Let's love &amp; serve the real people.
