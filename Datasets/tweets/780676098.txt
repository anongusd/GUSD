@IndyMama8 @jackiemccaffrey @disco_socialist @SenSanders I don‚Äôt remember if he mentioned that specifically, but he definitely talked about criminal justice reform, legalizing marijuana, but I will check the transcript. His position against police brutality has been quite clear.
@IndyMama8 @jackiemccaffrey @disco_socialist @SenSanders Anyone who said his speech wasn‚Äôt dead on is either an employee of a Fortune 500 company, in the top 1% or involved in banking, healthcare, or another industry that stands to be changed radically by a President Sanders.
@IndyMama8 @jackiemccaffrey @disco_socialist @SenSanders There were no anecdotes about his dad being hard working. He pointed out that the top 25 hedge fund owners earn as much as 140k kindergarten teachers. And that the tax breaks have all gone to the top. It was economic populism plus a call for #MedicareForAll and #GreenNewDeal
@jackiemccaffrey @disco_socialist @IndyMama8 She was coached by CAP, #NeoLibNeera and her speech was written by NeoLib centrists who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing but somehow remain in control of the party for decades. @SenSanders speech afterwards was the right tone, policies &amp; facts that a counter to #SOTU required

@BretStephensNYT @AOC Another American Jew who loves Israel, is also opposed to the policy of the Likud party, and also supports @jeremycorbyn and his progressive policies, while understanding that he‚Äôs not an anti-Semite, he‚Äôs holding a democratic government accountable - not sure the right answer
@BretStephensNYT @AOC Shame on you @nytimes for joining this false smear.
@gmanskigee @joanwalsh @AOC But as you love to say daily, he‚Äôs not a Democrat! üòÇüòÇ see I can use that line too. In that case it‚Äôs nice for independents to also get a voice.
@gmanskigee @joanwalsh He has millions of followers who have no other voice in the political spectrum (until @aoc) Show me all of the Salon articles calling out Kamala for her record the way they‚Äôve consistently attacked and smeared Bernie &amp; progressives over the years
@jules_26965 @joanwalsh Nobody really speaks for both the views of the corporate establishment of the leadership as well as the progressive members, because there are many issues where our policy preferences differ: education, healthcare, military, job guarantee, minimum wage to name a few
@jules_26965 @joanwalsh I like her just fine but she‚Äôs not running for President in 2020. Sen. Harris already is and Sen. Sanders will be - people should simply call things equally. That‚Äôs all I was saying
@jules_26965 @joanwalsh No matter what he does there would have been push back, but you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion. With millions of followers, Bernie gives the progressive perspective, which has a different agenda than the national corporate wing of the Dem party.
@gmanskigee @joanwalsh Just trying to backtrack and acknowledge that she looks like a complete hypocrite now that her ‚Äúanointed Kamala‚Äù will also be giving a reaction speech - BEFORE 45 even gives the SOTU. So her outrage yesterday over Bernie giving one is kind of silly now.

@LittleHarshGab And supported Beto over Cruz in the Senate race, and would love to support him if he shows he‚Äôs actually progressive and doesn‚Äôt just say he is.
@JSapp_AR @IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix I would love to support Beto as long as he shows he‚Äôs for all Americans and doesn‚Äôt vote for the donors over the voters in Congress. His voting record is questionable. That‚Äôs all I was saying, but the Beto backers are out in full force the past 24 hours. Like it‚Äôs orchestrated.
@BarackDaVote @neoblackout @ashiariz @armandodkos @Semperfelix I remember that time when Conyers built national momentum with a movement that‚Äôs brought together millions in support of everyday Americans - wait, oh- right. Bernie took the baton and ran with it.
@neoblackout @ashiariz @BarackDaVote @armandodkos @Semperfelix So like Denmark, Sweden, Norway,  etc? You mean exactly what Bernie has referenced for years as a working model?
@bedofnails319 @IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix I was also a Beto supporter vs. Cruz, but am asking questions about his national viability and scrutiny. If that‚Äôs too much for his supporters to take, its a good indication that he‚Äôs not quite ready for the big time. I want to like him, but his policies have to be progressive.
@ChadwickFurr So the answer is yes? Just throw your hands up rather than answer the question?
@bedofnails319 @IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix I was asking questions and said that I actually like Beto, but I am unclear on his positions and have asked these sycophants to clarify. All I got was told how Bernie isn‚Äôt a Dem but nobody really backed Beto other than to point out his issue w M4A, which is legit.
@AllenJB12 @armandodkos And I never said he was the party, I said a majority of the base are in line with his policy ideas
@neoblackout @ashiariz @BarackDaVote @armandodkos @Semperfelix Haven‚Äôt seen his proposal - oh right - he hasn‚Äôt released one. What do you think would be a better way? Would LOVE a better way that everyone would get on board with. Nobody has come up with it yet.
@AllenJB12 @armandodkos While he fights for equal rights and raising the minimum wage, which benefits minorities, but you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion.
@Semperfelix @armandodkos Many in the Dem party are paid to lose by the same donors that give more to republicans. His policies are more in line with the Average American than any member of either party. That‚Äôs what drives you crazy. Declared members of the party don‚Äôt care about you as much as he does.
@william_1492 @IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix What makes you think that? By population percentages?
@beyerstein The anger is palatable and strange for the first time there‚Äôs considerable light on him on the national stage. My contention is that he should win a statewide race before being anointed the ‚Äò20 front runner
@slapquest @IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix In a fair fight he wipes the floor w/ all of them, but we know that he‚Äôd never get a fair fight. So we‚Äôll see. If he even runs. Or tries to as a D. Maybe he just goes Indy like you all want &amp; you can cry for another 4 years about how a corp Dem candidate lost to Trump X2
@IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix Why does one assume that I was anti-Beto or pro-Bernie by asking what Beto supports. So questioning someone‚Äôs record is now attacks. Got it.
@IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix Ok but you‚Äôll be handing Trump another term - America does not want another corporate suck up. How about the guy wins a statewide race before people start anointing him as a party savior or leader?
@NewLacCity @armandodkos @Semperfelix Has he signed on to HR676?
@AGsmith70 @armandodkos @Semperfelix When did anyone declare they were running?
@IJefTomI @armandodkos @Semperfelix Anyone who wants the progressive vote had better. We‚Äôre a large, and growing, percentage of the base. And we refuse to have the will of the people continually ignored, dismissed and suppressed by the donor class who controls party leadership any longer. No more playing nice.
@armandodkos Why back someone who won‚Äôt support what the majority of Dems, and Americans, want - but the donor class is determined never to concede. This is about policy. This is about the direction of the party.
@davidsirota Does Beto back Medicare for All? #greennewdeal? universal Pre-K? Haven‚Äôt heard him mention any of those as things he will fight for, nor has his legislative record shown that. Pointing that out makes one a pariah in the Dem party as they seek to prop up the next corp stooge.

@obbiecole @SilverWingsPega @brianmacian @4everNeverTrump @jaketapper I, as an independent for 25 years, joined the party to vote for Bernie, but many didnt catch on to his message as quickly as I did. They wanted to vote for him but the filing date to join to vote in the primary had passed. It‚Äôs why he did so well in caucus states w open primaries
@obbiecole @SilverWingsPega @brianmacian @4everNeverTrump @jaketapper Then why did the media include them in every reporting about delegate count during primary season? It had the psychological effect to tell the public that party establishment supported HRC (truth) and then closed primary reg rules prevented later supporters from voting for him.

@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept The problem is that the majority doesn‚Äôt decide which legislation the leadership supports - the donors do. And the private insurance companies line the coffers of Dem leadership so until they‚Äôre gone too, nothing will change and you can be happy while millions suffer I guess.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept But having a conversation that helps someone possibly convert to support the idea is worth it. I agree that adding coverage for Diabetes would be a good start to improve the Medicare system so it could work for all of us.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept I‚Äôm not.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Your opinion is in the minority - both within the party and in the country. And we have an unsustainable system that causes unmeasurable pain and suffering, in addition to the mass bankruptcies each year due to HC costs. Either way this is all moot until 45 is gone anyway
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept You have lots of ideas about what won‚Äôt work - how about proposing one that would?
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept I am not proposing them. I sell vehicle data and don‚Äôt profess to write legislation that thinks of every angle. The politicians, like @RepRoKhanna @Ocasio2018 @RepBarbaraLee and 75 other members of Congress have signed on to HR676, which I support, are tasked with that job.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Coverage can be improved with the times. Why are you fighting against that idea?
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept What‚Äôs your better solution besides maintaining the current unsustainable system? Oh, right. You never offer one. Just criticism. Valid, but nothing positive to contribute. Don‚Äôt give everyone healthcare, don‚Äôt eliminate for profit private insurance, screw the 600k+ going BK/yr
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept So what‚Äôs your solution? Crickets.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Again, you offer no solutions. What if we covered diabetes with Medicare going forward and did in home checks?
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept You‚Äôve offered no solutions
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept No I want universal coverage for all but we need to take steps to get there
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Medicare would cover the same or better. The name would be the same but you‚Äôre comparing it to what we have today. But again. There will still be a secondary market.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Only the primary market. There can still be a secondary one. Works in every other 1st world nation
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept ‚ÄúAetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group ‚Äî the big five for-profit insurers ‚Äî cumulatively collected $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017.‚Äù
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Here‚Äôs $18B in profit for 2017	https://t.co/x03D7ZummJ
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Elimination of the for-profit health insurance market. Elimination of CEO and board salaries.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept I just did
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept No answers only insults
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Explain how everyone will pay more with an increase in the Medicare tax that is a lower number each month than one is paying for private insurance, or Obamacare, which is subsidized private insurance.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept **en masse
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept En made, as a country. You need to think both macroeconomically as well as the micro. The 5 trillion saved is money that Americans will have back in their pockets over a decade vs the current system. So what‚Äôs your answer? Who has nothing but criticism but no solutions?
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Explain how I‚Äôm asking them to pay more or how I‚Äôm raising their overall costs.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Not more than you were already paying your insurance provider!!!!!
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept It‚Äôs not a line. Everyone spends less each month on healthcare. Instead of paying private cos, we pay the govt. it‚Äôs less b/c We eliminate for primary care for-profit health insurance and can negotiate bulk deals. Plus Everybody gets covered. We save trillions.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept I‚Äôm not asking anyone for more than they currently spend each month - their burden actually goes down with everyone else‚Äôs. The system gets more efficient and saves 20-50% in costs by removing the profit motive from the single payer
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept They take the money they were spending on healthcare and transfer 80% of it to tax, the rest they keep
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Everyone would spend less. BTW What private insurer is offering plans for .97/mo?
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept If I raise your taxes by 5% but eliminate the 10% expenditure on private health insurance, everybody nets 5% more in every check.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept If you spend less each month on taxes that includes healthcare vs more each month to keep them separate (like we do now), which works better? It‚Äôs about messaging WHY this is the best way for everyone to get covered. Dems are terrible at that.
@MsInformation @maddow He needs to be arrested for the damage he inflicted on the people of Flint.
@driven101 @theintercept As long as the cut is to the military, most Dems and all Republicans won‚Äôt sign off. And that‚Äôs where we need to take most of the $$ from. Make peace. Not war.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Plus it‚Äôs progressive to ensure that healthcare is a right for all Americans and that everyone gets covered, which we don‚Äôt have now.
@5cupsofcoffee6 @theintercept Transferring the money we pay to private health insurers to the government, discounted by our bulk ability to buy &amp; the elimination of a for-profit system may lead to an increase in taxes, but reduce total out of pocket combined cost / increase spend power for the bottom 80%

@lynn_balcon @bubblegenius @kerryanderson @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders They mentioned pushing for an F35 fighter, and attacking Dems for not being with their constituents enough who want Medicare For All,infrastructure investment t, Legal Marijuana, Free Public University Tuition, a Living Minimum Wage Tied to Cost of Living, tax Wall St speculation

@bubblegenius @kerryanderson @lynn_balcon @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders Really? Because there are 7 already in Congress. And the number is growing.

@bubblegenius @kerryanderson @lynn_balcon @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders Big problem is there is no other popular progressive with the same platform that can win. There are only a couple of others in the party that even signed on to everything above I listed, AND voted against every increase for the military. You may not like that, but it‚Äôs reality.
@kerryanderson @bubblegenius @lynn_balcon @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders Waiting for a share with some backup. All I hear is attacking. And ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not a Democrat!‚Äù Because he‚Äôs not corrupt like the leaders of OUR party.
@bubblegenius @kerryanderson @lynn_balcon @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders A) who is she to ‚Äúvet‚Äù a candidate? What are her credentials?	B) she makes an accusation without backing it up with any substance. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs selfish‚Äù - exactly how has he been out for himself and not for the people?	C) ‚Äúattacking us‚Äù - you mean corrupt corporate Dems who block bills?
@bubblegenius @kerryanderson @lynn_balcon @BravenakBlog @davidbrockdc @TheSandersInst @SenSanders Like Medicare for All, a Living Wage and A Green New Deal, let‚Äôs get corruption and money out of our politics from BOTH parties and have people represent US for a change? Bullshit like that?

@lucylouise1112 @jacksnowknows @DebraDuGemini59 It kind of does matter. That‚Äôs a minor crime in the grand scheme, when they‚Äôre up to so much worse. The stuff with the Chinese patents in exchange for exemptions on tariffs for the products she produces in a China is much more concerning.
@code_name_v @FallenPoultry @DogginTrump What about since she LOST the speakership, as I asked above? That was all a decade ago. With a Dem President and a Dem majority in the Senate. Quite a non record
@code_name_v @DogginTrump What about since she LOST the speakership, as I asked above? That was all a decade ago. With a Dem President and a Dem majority in the Senate.
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v I can have a differing opinion and make a valid point as well.
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v So ignore all of the other crimes and hope the Mueller investigation proves what we all think it does.
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v @theintercept @TheYoungTurks @davidsirota @NomikiKonst @nomiprins @mtaibbi @jeremyscahill - investigative reporters not beholden to sucking up to power for access, but get the real story in spite of the obstruction. @jennycohn1 @Amy_Siskind @mikefarb1 if you ‚ù§Ô∏è Democracy
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v Which means she‚Äôs going to hide behind Republicans and wait for them to do something. Exactly the WRONG strategy. There‚Äôs enough corruption to impeach today. The self dealing, emoluments, not divesting from his businesses, pick from 1 of 10 or more crimes, plus the big one #OOJ
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v How about from a source that has some credibility left?
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v Did YOU read it?
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v The fucking subheading calls her out of touch for crying out loud! Calls her out for being rich and getting that way by insider trading
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v I actually did. No accomplishments listed since 2011 as I requested
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v By taking impeachment off the table and vowing to work with him the day after a mandate against his monstrous policies was voted by the largest midterm turnout since 1914.
@jacksnowknows @DebraDuGemini59 In all fairness, Were any of them classified?
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v There was not one accomplishment mentioned since losing the speakership - why does she automatically deserve it again? Isn‚Äôt that how we ended up with 45? By old leadership anointing the leader- and shock! Same old song and dance. It‚Äôs been 8 years. She can be a trusted advisor
@FallenPoultry @DogginTrump @code_name_v Player hating? üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ so of touch. Just like she is. Like 1997 come back to me. Biggie: Playa, Haters!
@DogginTrump @code_name_v Please list all of Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs  legislative mastery since she lost the gavel in 2011. This should be fun.
@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems I was a lifelong independent who has voted on both sides of the aisle who joined the Dems in 2015 to vote for Bernie in my state‚Äôs primary. When he lost I voted for HRC in the general because I knew what a monster and how destructive 45 would be. And she won my state handily.
@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems Not that it‚Äôs any of your business but you‚Äôre wrong.
@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems Of course.
@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems Because the base agrees with me but we‚Äôre not represented. The fact that there are now 7 JDs in Congress (up from 3) proves this wave is just getting started. We‚Äôre not offered uncorrupted progressive candidates often enough with visibility. But see what happens when we are?
@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems They privatize the gains but socialize the losses. Done with that ponzi scheme.

@BucFiend @DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland @justicedems Because private interests require private profit and are often infested with greed. With OUR money.

@SusieMadrak @BetsyShiller @Swikky @poetofscience @ericgarland And they‚Äôre not the donor class.

@BetsyShiller @Swikky @poetofscience @ericgarland A) NY-14 doesnt include Wall Street. I know. I worked on research for the campaign.

People like Wall Street Joe Crowley, who will now make millions in the private sector? Get strong, uncorrupted representatives in all 535 seats!
@Swikky @poetofscience @ericgarland Do you clowns know why @justicedems was created? To help uncorrupted candidates who won‚Äôt take corporate PAC money &amp; fund primarily on small dollar donations with a national platform. So yes, they funded her for $5k. And she‚Äôs helped put them on the map. But their mission is pure
@ericgarland @NefertitiVerita Bernie puts your corrupt consultant ass out of business, Eric. Your smear job is personal, it‚Äôs baseless &amp; it‚Äôs divisive. She‚Äôs fighting for the little guy.

@DorothyZee1 @WeAreRosie @ericgarland Nope. She ran on the Democratic ticket. That smear is easily verifiable. She ran as a @justicedems Democrat who wouldn‚Äôt take corporate PAC money, listened to her constituents, went door to door &amp; talked to the people in her district.

@EdKrassen @NancyPelosi What to Progressive Dems want badly? A leader who is uncorrupted by corporate influence and will fight for the base of the party and not the donor class. A check on Trump. Not someone who wants to work with him and his monstrous policies. But we don‚Äôt get a voice. 1/

@nycbubbles @DavidNir @joanwalsh Apparently you don‚Äôt really know how the power structure in Washington works. The powerful don‚Äôt like to have their power threatened or challenged.
@nycbubbles I‚Äôm suggesting who could assume a leadership role to show the country where the party is heading, with Nancy as a ‚Äútrusted counselor‚Äù and a part of leadership.
@nycbubbles @DavidNir @joanwalsh I also like @RepTedLieu and @RepRoKhanna or @RepRaulGrijalva
@nycbubbles @DavidNir @joanwalsh Only because nobody wants to take on the anointed queen and lose. If it were truly open, I‚Äôm sure people would feel differently. But whatever. She‚Äôs going to win it either way.

He‚Äôs talking about referencing people trying to destroy lives because it‚Äôs his own words coming back to haunt him that will really destroy his life. If he confesses to his family it‚Äôs devastating to him, probably ends his marriage and his girls maybe never speak to him again.
He is still also putting up the illusion that he‚Äôs a strict conservative, and knowing and behaving that way isn‚Äôt proper in that world. its one thing to hear it from everyone else accusing you. It‚Äôs something completely different if he breaks down &amp; admits it all. That‚Äôs what 2/

@MaggieJordanACN @brandonmecella I‚Äôm a realist - I also know that most of the sheep in this country will only vote for someone with an R or a D next to their name for President. To deny that fact is intellectually dishonest and lazy. So we work with what we know to be true.
@MaggieJordanACN @brandonmecella If he‚Äôs a go getter?

@MaggieJordanACN @brandonmecella Ok. Now you‚Äôre just trolling. Bernie is lazy? Let‚Äôs see his miles racked up since 2016 vs HRC since 2016. Who‚Äôs lazy again? He‚Äôs worked harder than anyone with a D next to their name. They should all aspire to work as hard or have as loyal, or large, of a following.

@davidpakmanshow @YouTube Nope. Authoritarians traditionally don‚Äôt like debate. They don‚Äôt really like listening to, or understanding the perspective of, the other side.

@NoMoreNeolibs But I am taking the pirate ship approach. I joined @justicedems when it started and only support candidates who run on a no Super PAC, progressive platform that‚Äôs not beholden to special interests. Take it over from the inside. Use the structure in place. It kills them.

@Ocasio2018 She hasn‚Äôt cast herself - she is running for Congress. She‚Äôs not an actress. Her messaging, because it‚Äôs true, is that she is an uncorrupted alternative to the current representative, who is too chummy with Wall Street.

@fresnophile @yusuf_VI @It_is_NunyaDB What? Most boomers were in high school and not of legislative age in the 60s, when Medicare and Civil Rights acts were passed.? You mean the war they were drafted into, then protested to end? Right. Your answer is pathetic. Vietnam

@Arthur_Klein1 @marc_a_beaudoin @ggreenwald A) his reporting is accurate B) Some of their hosts? Did you listen to the Ed Schultz interview? It was an edict from the head of MSNBC. I disagree with his references here. There is no network on TV that is progressive, you have hard right wing FOX and right of center MSNBC/CNN
@marc_a_beaudoin @ggreenwald I am a TYT paid Member, subscribe to The Intercept, Kyle Kulinski, Humanist Report, and others. Plenty of uncorrupted, independent sources with a progressive perspective to get news from today.
@marc_a_beaudoin @ggreenwald The network made an obvious shift right during the 2016 election cycle in an attempt to pick up ‚Äúmoderate Republicans‚Äù and take market share away from FOX - at the expense of the progressives who built the audience. I abandoned MSNBC during the Dem primary. Corporate propaganda.

@organicfanatic5 @RyanRoach5 @LiberallyLiving @RoKhanna That‚Äôs why I am a member of @justicedems - #1 issue is to get rid of Corp influence overriding the public good. The party needs to be changed from within. One person at a time. The only people who don‚Äôt want to get Big $ out of the system are the corrupt who profit from it.
@organicfanatic5 @RyanRoach5 @LiberallyLiving @RoKhanna Look at what @repjoecrowley is doing to try to marginalize the toughest challenge to his seat yet from @Ocasio2018 - real, uncorrupted people aren‚Äôt really welcome, and people like Wall St Joe - who don‚Äôt even live in the district he represents - get elevated to leadership roles.
@organicfanatic5 @RyanRoach5 @LiberallyLiving @RoKhanna The tent is large, so there are still some, but the influence of huge corporate money has killed any party who represents the interests of the people. Remember that Congress itself is now largely an out-of-touch millionaires club.
@RyanRoach5 @organicfanatic5 @LiberallyLiving @RoKhanna My point is that there was never a ‚Äúnot a real Democrat‚Äù conversation when it came to Obama, and Bernie wanted to tax and cut the influence of the corrupt donors and consultants that keep party leadership in place. Obama played within that structure and never really threatened it
@RyanRoach5 @organicfanatic5 @LiberallyLiving @RoKhanna Two differences - Obama was as corporate/establishment as Hillary, and Wall St knew it, and he was already a registered Democrat. How many times per day do I STILL have Hillbots screaming ‚ÄúNot a Democrat!‚Äù About Bernie.

@NialElkim @ShavedWookieeRN @WalkerBragman @BernieSanders Not enough of us are voting to make that a reality, unfortunately. Let‚Äôs go after achievable goals.
@TonyT0509 @AP You mean the two state solution that both parties supported for 40 years until Trump? We stand with Israel, not the corrupt hard right wing faction of the Kenesset. Bibi is the one who politicized Israel in the US. He antagonized Dems repeatedly by going all Fox News on everyone
@TonyT0509 @AP Supporting equality Over white Supremacy is not demonization - it‚Äôs being a good human
@TonyT0509 @AP Not so long ago, Israel was a nonpartisan issue that both political parties support. Then Bibi went and snubbed Obama repeatedly, &amp; spoke to Congress directly without first clearing it with Obama. Imagine the outrage of the right if Chuck Schumer invited Angela Markel to do this
@TonyT0509 @AP BecUse you‚Äôre only consuming extreme right wing US media, which demonizes half the country.
@BarrySTipton @next_current @AP I‚Äôm here and Jewish. It‚Äôll never be our country because the Christian fundamentalist agenda controls one of the major parties, and has significant influence over the other. A majority of the country still identifies as some type of Christian.
@rodneylacy @AP Says someone living in Saudi Arabia. Give me a break. I‚Äôll take that into consideration when reading your propagandizing reply. Do you work with MBS and Jared?
@Audrakat @AP Have ya seen the DNC? They‚Äôre as corrupt as Congressional Republicans. Paid by the same donors to lose. Socialist agenda? Whose? Have you seen @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi and their policies? They are actually against Medicare for all, which is what your complaining is really about
@Audrakat @AP Now wanting healthcare is enslavement? How‚Äôs that working out for citizens of every other first world country? They‚Äôre not slaves. But go on about how the DNC, which has lost the Presidency, Congress, Supreme Court and 2/3 of states if brainwashing anyone. They‚Äôre ineffective.
@AP Why didn‚Äô AP mention the REASON American Jews don‚Äôt like Trump? Because of the corruption, the lies, the draconian anti-immigrant policies that remind many of 1938 Germany, but they won‚Äôt bother to report that and provide context. This was meant to anger &amp; divide Jews globally
@NialElkim @ShavedWookieeRN @WalkerBragman @BernieSanders Did you see the turnout for Tuesday‚Äôs primaries? Enough people aren‚Äôt voting.
@ShavedWookieeRN @WalkerBragman @NialElkim @BernieSanders Pipe dream. He doesn‚Äôt have the time to set up a 3rd party that would get him on the ballot in all 50 states and convince enough Americans to not vote one of the 2 major parties today. That‚Äôs reality. Independents are dismissed by a majority of the base, no matter who it is.

@patmabraham @RepJerryNadler @NancyPelosi Mine has only gone up 3%, because my company is good enough to give an annual raise. And that‚Äôs more than most have gotten. My overall taxes aren‚Äôt lower - I‚Äôm in NJ and we got screwed with the property taxes in the #TaxScam passed in December.
@patmabraham @RepJerryNadler @NancyPelosi How much has your paycheck really gone up since December 2016? Most Americans haven‚Äôt seen a substantial pay raise. 2% of us got bonuses from our companies, but not raises.

@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst The ‚Äúpaddle‚Äù can also turn the canoe around and prevent it from going over the waterfall. Worth fighting over at that point? Absolutely.
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst And you still haven‚Äôt said why you support the leaders who have lost so much ground when they had a supermajority and blew it.
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst All I‚Äôve heard is support for the donor agenda, and push down grass roots progressives who won‚Äôt be bought, take corporate PAC $$ or pay off the DNC ‚Äúmedia consultants‚Äù that push TV ads over the web and get 15% on the ad buys.
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst The direction of the party is exactly a paddle, as it dictates the principles we fight for daily and towards collectively. It‚Äôs worth the fight. We don‚Äôt agree. I haven‚Äôt heard a clear agenda coming from Ds? Where are they on taxes? DREAMers? Healthcare? Consensus? Nobody knows.
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst Why do you continue to support a party leadership that continues to back corporate candidates, when they‚Äôre the reason we have a majority of Rs in the House and Senate &amp; then got 45 elected with their agenda that excites nobody? That lost 1k seats at the state level?
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst I never split it, and ‚Äúgot in line.‚Äù How‚Äôd that work out for all of us? But how about Dems adopting ONE progressive principle, and not solely serving the donors? Since a large percentage of the base actually IS progressive. Maybe they‚Äôd excite some people?
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst I am also for the social safety net, MediCare for All, banning private financing of elections, legalization of marijuana, a millionaire tax bracket and more. Not very Republican...
@after_blast @1Dussy @NomikiKonst Not open enough to Jews any more. I used to be a Republican in my late teens and early 20s. They want Israel in the hands of the Jews, but for their own selfish reasons. How many Jewish Rs in Congress? Not nearly as many as there are Dems. Why? The ‚Äúreligious right‚Äù takeover.

@Unity_Coach @migueljose_85 @Augustus709 @JoeManchinWV @DougJones The baby steps never develop into real steps. Sorry - tired of the status quo. Not going to support candidates who vote against their own party and approve unqualified Republican nominees like Pompeo and Haspel
@Unity_Coach @migueljose_85 @Augustus709 Those people have never been presented a real progressive with the media coverage to promote them. Stop offering milquetoast like @JoeManchinWV or @DougJones who votes R more than 50% of the time. Offer an alternative to Rs. Not R-lite.
@migueljose_85 @Augustus709 That‚Äôs exactly what I was trying to get someone to explain- what does the party stand for today? What are they fighting for nationally?

@Augustus709 @Dirtyhorizon @skolniks @TheRealRony305 And I VOTED FOR HER
@Augustus709 @Dirtyhorizon @skolniks @TheRealRony305 The one thing you can‚Äôt seem to see is the one thing everyone else not in the Hillary camp does. Nobody liked or trusted her. And they still don‚Äôt. Look at polling. She effing lost to this monster.
@Dirtyhorizon @Augustus709 @skolniks @TheRealRony305 Plus @Dirtyhorizon lives in Los Angeles - last I checked, CA went for the Ds. So the protest vote did what to get Trump elected? Zero. But keep trying to troll. I will continue to deftly swat your junk with reality. üè∏
@Augustus709 @Dirtyhorizon @skolniks @TheRealRony305 The party has no platform, no comprehensive message, and no direction. Tom Perez? Please. Still waiting for one person to tell me what Ds stand and FIGHT for today. Call me a R for questioning leadership and direction, possibly exposing the fact that they have none. U mad bro?
@Augustus709 @Dirtyhorizon @skolniks @TheRealRony305 How? When we held our noses and voted for the D? First, my state delivered.
@Augustus709 @Dirtyhorizon @skolniks @TheRealRony305 I was a lifelong Independent until Bernie ran. I joined a party for the 1st time in 25 years specifically to vote for him in the primary. Voted for Obama twice as an Independent. Primaries matter too much. Non-corrupt, Progressive candidates are out there, but the DNC hides them

@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 None of those platforms are supported by a majority of congressional Ds. What are they going to do to EARN our vote, and represent US - not the donor class?
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Wishing you a speedy recovery, but I have been paying attention. The issues I raised along with a $15 min wage, guaranteed paid sick leave and vacation, what‚Äôs the ideal? What do you use as the vision to offset the right-wing so the center stops being moved further right? Still 0
@skolniks @TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Sorry. The right wing hated her more than even Obama, the independents couldn‚Äôt stand her from her support of everything big business and war. Sat on board of Monsanto and WalMart, $200k speeches to Goldman, voted for Iraq, never voted against a military action, Patriot Act, etc
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 BTW still have not heard you mention one single issue Dems stand for that will deliver an electoral win besides, ‚Äúhave you seen the other guy?‚Äù - that‚Äôs what they did in ‚Äò16 - how‚Äôd that work out? No legal weed, mediCare for all, infrastructure, public U tuition, DREAM act
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Many feel, incorrectly, to this day that she would have been just as bad, or worse. I totally disagree, but see it every day in my news feed on here and FB.
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not how we elect a president in the United States. You need to win the electoral college, and she didn‚Äôt. As Al Gore proved in 2000, it‚Äôs possible to win the popular vote and not be President. Now try some policies that would bring in progressives and WIN.
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Independents make up the largest block of voters. The candidate selected in ‚Äò16 did nothing to appeal to them - and it pushed some towards Trump. Not me, but some.
@TheRealRony305 @Augustus709 Never heard you place any blame on a deeply flawed, divisively hated candidate who chose not to campaign in three crucial swing states for the last 2 months leading up to the election?

@seenorseems @bspiker @StopCampfield @ggreenwald A neo lib also has no interest in getting Big $$ out of politics, since they‚Äôre just as guilty as Rs in being bought by corporate masters - for pennies based on the profit earned due to legislative influence that their cash bought them. See recent deregulation or Pompeo vote
@bspiker @StopCampfield @ggreenwald A neolib also can‚Äôt stand progressive as much (or maybe more) as they can‚Äôt stand republicans, as progressives expose them for the corporate stooge frauds that they are
@hellomswilliams @chelseahandler @ApplegateCA49 @WolfPAChq So his policies aren‚Äôt more progressive than Levin? Prove it.
@bspiker @seenorseems @StopCampfield @ggreenwald Yet that response from @seenorseems was pretty spot on. A neo-lib doesn‚Äôt want #Medicare4All, to tax Wall St speculation, or pay for public university tuition, or drastic reductions in military spend.
