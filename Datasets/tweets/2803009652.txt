@realDonaldTrump  the FBI, the Broward police, the school admins, the mental health facility who let him sign himself out - he was in the stairwell during the dispatch convo. DEATH TOLL WOULD BE MUCH SMALLER WITH QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS.  #NIKOLASCRUZISAVICTIMTOO
I'm sure they haven't given Nikolas Cruz any medication that could help his State of Mind. Medication could make all the difference for him. Don't murder him. Please. From prison he could talk 2 other juveniles who are suffering in the same way. @realDonaldTrump
They're really trying to make an example of Nikolas Cruz. And he is nothing like the average shooter. And there's a million other people more than him for what happened. They can't kill him. She's been neglected of Mental Health Services all his life. Help him! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump if you want people with mental illness to be comfortable talking about what's happening in their heads &amp; be more willing to get medication you have to stop calling Mr Cruz &amp; any others needing acceptance "sickos" &amp; "messed up". It's ignorant. This isn't the '50's

@realDonaldTrump Cruz has documented mental illness. Voices telling him to do things. He was crying for help. Everyone knew. He was bullied &amp; outcast by his peers. Attorney says he's sad remorseful &amp; broken. YOU CANT GIVE HIM THE DEATH PENALTY. WE FAILED HIM! DONT COVER THAT UP!!
@IngrahamAngle Cruz is a victim of our society. We let our kids raise themselves. He was so lonely. He wasn't looking for fame he just wanted them to stop bullying him. I said my prayers today for young Mr Cruz who's life is also over.
@greggutfeld if you are not married and you have children you should get less of a tax credit then married couples. And that portion of your tax credit to go to summer programs aimed at teaching kids how to survive.
@greggutfeld there should be mandatory training and education for anyone who wants to have a child. It shouldn't matter if there are two moms or two dads or one of each children need two parents. You shouldn't get more welfare when you have two and three children out of wedlock.
@greggutfeld he didn't kill himself because he didn't want to die. He just wanted to stop hurting. He was numb. There's more to his story than just his parents being dead. More than the girlfriend. It goes way back to his early childhood. A lifetime wandering in his head.
@greggutfeld he lived in a very happy City it sounds. He was on the outside watching everyone. And they lost it to him and all of your names that we are allowing media to continue doing. Stop calling him a sicko and evil in a wacko. He was a young man who was hurting and alone
@greggutfeld this young man has been hurting for years alone. The answer to this problem? Parents need to spend more quality time with their children. So they feel safe and secure and loved and know their strengths and weaknesses and hear their parents say I'm proud of you.
@kilmeade I watch fox most all day but I'm turning it off today as I did when everyone shamed Harvey W. Kids who have everything bully kids with nothing. Having children is a huge responsibility. It takes a village. It takes 2 parents - 2 mom's, or dads or 1 of ea. Focus onfamily
@SteveDoocy his motives??? Y'all keep saying the kids called him "sketchy" they made fun of him cause he was quiet &amp; "weird". Kids are cruel. He was on the outside looking in. He had nobody to hug him &amp; teach him how to cope in such a cruel world.
@ainsleyearhardt this isn't about mental illness. Nickolas isn't "the problem" the people responsible for raising him are responsible. He is a victim of our society just like the #metoo girls. Lack of love, security, praise. America's children slip thru the cracks! It's not right
@ainsleyearhardt please stop calling Nickolas Cruz "bad" &amp; a "whack job". His parents are to blame. Mandatory training for perspective parents. Programs for kids of broken homes. Less welfare for people who have more than 1 child out of wedlock.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President HE is not the problem. HE is not bad. He is hurting. He didn't have a good life and now his life is over. Calling him "weird" or "sketchy" isn't right. His parents created this. His family failed to do their jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Mandatory training &amp; classes for anyone wanting children. Less government assistance for people who have baby after baby out of wedlock. AMERICA'S CHILDREN ARE NEGLECTED &amp; ABANDONED. Cell phones &amp; computers aren't a substitute for hugs &amp; praise.
@realDonaldTrump less tax credit to couples having children out of wedlock. Funding summer programs for kids of broken homes aimed at teaching these kids they matter &amp; how to take care of themselves. Nickolas Cruz is a victim &amp; nobody cares. He's been hurting a long time.
@marcorubio Nickolas Cruz home life isn't a side note. HE DIDNT HAVE A PROPER HOME &amp; UNCONDITIONAL LOVE &amp; SECURITY HE NEEDED. HE IS A VICTIM OF OUR SOCIETY. Mandatory Training for perspective parents &amp; less of a tax credit for couples having kids out of wedlock. Listen to me!!!
@dbongino Dan this young man is hurting. He didn't have a home with a mom &amp; dad. He didn't get the love &amp; security he needed. HE IS A VICTIM OF OUR SOCIETY. JUST LIKE THE GIRLS OF #METOO. WE NEED TO NOT DEMONIZE HIM. ITS NOT HIS FAULT! YOU SHOULD NEED A LICENCE TO HAVE KIDS.
@Trumpfan1995 It's not about gun control. It's about children who are hurting. Children who don't have a voice. Lost children. Children who come home to an empty house. Children who are hurting. We neglect our children. We fight amongst ourselves. Broken homes. No role models.
People...stop pointing fingers at mental illness &amp; perverted old men. This shooter &amp; the young ladies who happen into adult situations they can't handle need the same thing! Love. Hugs. Being shown they matter. Security &amp; safety. Take responsibility. Our babies need us.
