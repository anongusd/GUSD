She just showed her staff respect by not making them wait on someone who demonized folks where they come from. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@rcameron405 @belle0377 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum I watch independent news. Not MSM.

@belle0377 @rcameron405 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum I don‚Äôt appreciate it.
@rcameron405 @belle0377 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum What idiots in the street??
@rcameron405 @belle0377 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum But why not? What is he hiding?
@belle0377 @rcameron405 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum MY question is WHY wouldn‚Äôt I have tax records to release? Saying‚Äùif you have any‚Äù is a low key way of saying he thought I don‚Äôt work. But I‚Äôm a veteran and entrepreneur. I pay taxes.  He‚Äôs just a douche bag.
@rcameron405 @belle0377 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum Why wouldn‚Äôt I?
@rcameron405 @belle0377 @Nossop13 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum If I have any?? What, exactly, did you mean?
@rcameron405 @Nossop13 @belle0377 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum By the way, I‚Äôm a veteran in a long line of veterans. We fought for your ability to ask asinine questions on social media. So please, continue. It makes my service worthwhile! üëçüèΩüíã

@rcameron405 @Nossop13 @belle0377 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum Release to whom? No one has asked.
@6carmonaf @FoxNews @dbongino You mean when Obama deported so many illegal criminal immigrants he became known as ‚ÄúDeporter-in-chief‚Äù?? He deported more than all presidents before him, combined. Look up FACTS!!!!
@FoxNews @dbongino You are painfully disengenuous!!!
@FoxNews @dbongino Obama has been called ‚ÄúDeporter-in-chief‚Äù because he deported more illegal, criminal immigrants than all presidents before him combined. How dare you act as though Dems have been soft on immigration!
@chucklefukker @RagingPachyderm @realDonaldTrump If you can prove the person stares at Trump‚Äôs feed all day and does what you say, then kudos. But I don‚Äôt know how you could unless you stared at their feed all day and did the same.
@chucklefukker @RagingPachyderm @realDonaldTrump Is that what the person you responded to does? Do you have proof of that? Seems to me they were just calling him out. Maybe you can prove me wrong.
@Nossop13 @belle0377 @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum He‚Äôs not personally under investigation. But Trump was PERSONALLY being audited in 2016 and still hasn‚Äôt let us know if he still is nor has he released his tax records.
@icecreampolack @KirkendallMark @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL Please send us the receipts. Trump is known for not paying people. I‚Äôd like to see the proof.
@supernana999 @KirkendallMark @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL I am a liberal vet and have many liberal vet friends who feel the way I do. Maybe you should care more about uniting the country than ‚Äúowning liberals‚Äù.  I swear when I think of what I fought for, it makes me sad. A waste.
@supernana999 @KirkendallMark @realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL But it‚Äôs accurate. Why don‚Äôt you care now?
@realDonaldTrump @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL Why didn‚Äôt you condemn the racist robocalls?
@1twotone @realDonaldTrump How?
@richie_cummins @realDonaldTrump How?
@CathyWeston6 @realDonaldTrump How?
@realDonaldTrump Obama has been called the ‚ÄúDeporter-in-Chief‚Äù for deporting more criminal illegal aliens than any presidents before him, combined. Look it up! You KNOW you are full of crap!
@realDonaldTrump I call BS. And you know it‚Äôs BS. you lie to your followers everyday!
@chucklefukker @RagingPachyderm @realDonaldTrump How? Why?
@Nana121810 @RagingPachyderm @realDonaldTrump And behavior. Come on. Let‚Äôs be Americans. I‚Äôm a veteran. I want what‚Äôs best for the country. Trump has some very real issues.
@Nana121810 @RagingPachyderm @realDonaldTrump Not really. Just look at the court records
@realDonaldTrump And I don‚Äôt even believe in all his politics! But at least he didn‚Äôt encourage violence and call Republicans the enemy of the American people!! And he took office after the Republican President who was in office during 9/11! Lord KNOWS how you would have twisted THAT!!
@realDonaldTrump I just saw an Obama speech and THAT is how you deal with hecklers! Don‚Äôt encourage people to be violent. Just tell them to go support the candidates they support! Use their energy more wisely! You could learn much from him!

@STARING_KRYSTAL @TwitterMoments @VanityFair You can support him all you want. But it is very easy to accept that this is his belief about black people. Even white supremacists tout his hesitance to demonize them as a reason to support him. It‚Äôs seen across the board. You are one of the ones who choose to ignore it. (4/4)
@STARING_KRYSTAL @TwitterMoments @VanityFair He and his father discriminated against black people illegally during real estate transactions. This is the man who raised him. When you speak to a racist, one of the most common explanations of their closely held beliefs is, ‚ÄúI was raised that way.‚Äù(3/)
@STARING_KRYSTAL @TwitterMoments @VanityFair ESPECIALLY considering the fact that one of his favorite comments about black politicians who disagree with him is that they possess low IQs. Not like he‚Äôs given them IQ tests... (2/)
@STARING_KRYSTAL @TwitterMoments @VanityFair In all seriousness, we‚Äôve all heard the president‚Äôs incendiary language against those who don‚Äôt support him. Black people, overwhelmingly, do not support him. Is it REALLY that hard to believe he‚Äôd make a statement like this? (1/)
@camiec90 @2208Hanna @Dizzybutterflyy @realDonaldTrump Thank you!!
@realDonaldTrump That man did those things. You want to wholly blame Dems for his actions, but take no responsibility for your incendiary, divisive language which has stoked the flames of hatred in the hearts of many. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.
@realDonaldTrump Do you even get how divisive you are?!
@Gabby39924557 @realDonaldTrump Right. I just joined the military because I had nothing better to do that day. SMDH Give me a break, lady.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All Can someone please show me proof or evidence of this. So many retweets, but my request for proof goes unanswered.
@BearRegan @Nikkki_R @SmallGov4All @realDonaldTrump Because the fact of the matter is big businesses have lines the pockets of politicians. Reaearch the disparity between how public opinion influences policies vs that of the rich and big businesses. It‚Äôs not even 50/50.
@BearRegan @Nikkki_R @SmallGov4All @realDonaldTrump I agree. Now we need the laws and policies to align with that.
@bijoulita @Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All What did you say? I didn‚Äôt see it.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All If you could have asked my great grandfather if he would rather be lynched or yelled at in an elevator by women who wanted to be heard as sexual assault victims, I think I know what he would have chosen. He was accustomed to being kicked out of restaurants, so...
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All Being lynched, hosed, jumped, stoned, and bombed. Yeah, I‚Äôd say this country and its citizens have seen some harder times than this. My own family can attest to that.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All But let‚Äôs be real for a moment. ‚ÄúNever‚Äù has there been so much hate? Look at the black kids who were the first to integrate schools. Look at what black folks went thru just trying to get food from the same counters or vote!
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All When did these people say those things? I can‚Äôt find it. Can you please provide me reliable quotes?
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All I agree with you on that! But I suggest you Really read Trump‚Äôs trade agreements. Much of what he rallied against in the old agreements are in the new ones he orchestrated.
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All Like I said, I was a child. I just know he was actually impeached.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All I‚Äôm a vet. And this is damn sure NOT what O fought for. Bor did I fight for a president to lie about what I believe in and support as a Dem and call people like me unpatriotic or enemies of the people.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All It still doesn‚Äôt represent us, the people. And that why we should never allow it all to make us so divided.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All I hear about Soros much. Just like I‚Äôve heard about the Mercers who support Trump. I‚Äôve never heard Antifa support any Dem politician as I have heard white supremacists support Trump. And I‚Äôm always open to new information.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All It was a Republican media person who was fired for tweeting about the Obama girls‚Äô attire. And I‚Äôve never heard any of the people you mentioned wish harm on Barron Trump, but I will research it for myself tonight.
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All If you believe he was the only president who did that in the Oval Office, I think that‚Äôs naive. Something about men and power. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sorry you were disappointed by Obama. Many of us were. I was, too. But it doesn‚Äôt make me jaded about Trump. Shouldn‚Äôt do that to you, either.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All People called Michelle Obama a gorilla and a man. Evil, ignorant people will be ignorant and evil. Look at the individuals who were beat up at Trump rallies, after Trump said he‚Äôd pay off legal fees.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All White supremacists groups have counted an increase in membership ever since Obama was president. And we see what that‚Äôs gotten us. People wished RAPE on the Obama girls because of clothes they wore to a turkey pardoning. Sick, disturbed people have always been such.
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All And politicians on BOTH sides become rich from their time in office. Look at Dick Cheyney. Let‚Äôs be honest during these arguments. And stop demonizing each other based on the actions of people who will never give a damn about us.
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All I hope he will be gone in 2020 because I want better for my country. As a vet, this whole sotuation sickens me. I was too young to vote when Bill was in office, but I would have been disturbed by his actions. However, I‚Äôm grown now. I hardly believe he was the only one.
@Nikkki_R @bijoulita @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All What is the left up to? Can you really say there is hate and violence on the left that doesn‚Äôt exist on the right? Are the Republicans NOT crooks, as well? There are deep issues on BOTH sides. We must not be disengenuous.  Hagiography serves NONE of us.
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All Military members said they wouldn‚Äôt fight overseas if their units were activated. Members of Congress swore to oppose him on every front from before he was even elected! Before he attempted to pass one piece of legislation! Why are you guys acting like Trump is some victim?
@Nikkki_R @realDonaldTrump @SmallGov4All George W. Bush was deemed as a president who ‚Äústole‚Äù the presidency. Would ypu say he dealt with LESS vitriol? People said Obama wasn‚Äôt a citizen. Would you say he dealt with less vitriol? He was shot and burned in effigy!
@realDonaldTrump The news media uses your speeches and quotes which many deem as negative and you call it ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. If it were all lies and fabrications, they would have been caught by now. Yes, there‚Äôs ‚Äúspin‚Äù. As EVERY president in modern times has dealt with. But your words are YOUR WORDS.
@akflipse @elainea88030 @realDonaldTrump Out of hundreds of people, you really thought we‚Äôd ‚ÄúKNOW‚Äù who did it just by watching?

You attacked saying my ‚Äúpeople‚Äù were ‚Äútrash‚Äù and ‚Äúviolent‚Äù went back and forth with us all night but never defined or defended your original response. (Weak).

@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump And we NEVER claimed feminism.

@akflipse @MichaelWeez764 @elainea88030 @realDonaldTrump And why does he know everything but he‚Äôs not involved? Just the same old deep state who is not intelligent or powerful enough to take them down but enought to educate him. üßêü§îüòíüôÑ
@akflipse @MichaelWeez764 @elainea88030 @realDonaldTrump Alex Jones has said a lot. I used to follow him, too. I stopped when his predictions didn‚Äôt come true.

@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Tell them they don‚Äôt teach diversity to the white kids who attend. Or maybe protest for diversity at other schools who teach whiteness as a standard. Even to students who aren‚Äôt whitebb
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Ask Rachel Dolezal. The fact is, it has ZERO to do with your original point. And if you‚Äôd research the need and respect for HBCU‚Äôs, maybe YOU could learn some respect!

@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump I put on the uniform, took the pledge to defend and protect my country as the first woman in a long line of veterans in my family to do so. Won awards for my individual service, and reached out when my old base was decimated by Hurricane Michael. (1/)
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Where was this energy when I asked you for an explanation of whom you were referring to as trash in your original response? Because I am STILL waiting.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump I just read your profile.

@ElvyReilly @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @realDonaldTrump Hell, I STARTED watching news media by watching FOX news 24/7 just before I joined the military. A friend told me to also watch MSNBC. A friend in the military opened me up to independent news sources before he got out. I am no one‚Äôs puppet.
@ElvyReilly @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @realDonaldTrump Not only do I find it condescending, but I stopped supporting them for MANY reasons DURING the Obama administration. I was a huge supporter before that. But even though I voted for Obama, knowing about some of the policies and seeing them ignore the bad turned me off.
@ElvyReilly @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @realDonaldTrump I also go to websites that allow us to view pieces of legislation that have been passed, and watch CSPAN and CSPAN2 as it‚Äôs happening in real time. My issue was the poster insinuated that I‚Äôm an MSNBC supporter. And that is false.
@ElvyReilly @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @realDonaldTrump I listen to CNN, FOX, MSNBC, POTUS radio, Conservative radio, Progressive radio, NPR, BCC, ALL of it. I watch conservative, progressive, independent, American AND foreign news on the internet. I even watch Asian news late at night/early in the morning.
@ElvyReilly @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt WATCH ANY of them. When I‚Äôm on my drive, I‚Äôll listen to ALL of them (and more) depending on the topic of conversation and who doesn‚Äôt have commercials on! üòÇ
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump You are speaking to a USAF veteran and an MBA holder and ‚Äúboom shakalaka‚Äù is the BEST you can do?! But you‚Äôd ‚Äúrun circles‚Äù around someone in a debate? Man, you are just wasting characters at this point.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump You have all this time to insult and speak nonsense, but have YET to define who you were calling ‚Äútrash‚Äù and defend your original response to ME. Instead you bring up KAVANAUGH?

@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump He clearly believes in meeting people where they are and responding in kind. I disagree with that. I already said that. And again, unless we are talking about Republicans PHYSICALLY ‚Äúgoing low‚Äù, it‚Äôs CLEARLY rhetorical.
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Trump overtly supports violence. It is fact. Holder‚Äôs call was a play on Michelle Obama saying ‚ÄúWhen they go low, we go high!‚Äù As if to say, we should rise above the rhetoric we don‚Äôt believe in. Holder took a different approach.
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump You should feel free to name another example that called for overt violence as Trump has done. As I said, I DON‚ÄôT support Holder. Never have. So your point is lacking validity.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump And it‚Äôs ‚ÄúEVER‚Äù since. For the record.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump I NEVER insulted you. You came on MY post spewing nonsense. Nonsense which you have failed to back up. You said my ‚Äúpeople‚Äù have incited more violence than any side, sonI don‚Äôt even think you‚Äôre talking politics at this point. Where am I wrong? Show me.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Whose enemy am I? The very people I volunteered to protect and defend when I took my oath and put on the uniform? Instead of waiting until November, why don‚Äôt you tell me what my place is NOW. I‚Äôll wait.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm still waiting to hear who you called ‚Äútrash‚Äù. I have never claimed to be anything other than an American citizen who believes in politicians properly representing their constituents and holding them accountable for their words and deeds.
@sharrington1502 @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump Can you please provide an example? A link? A quote? Something that is worse than Trump‚Äôs violent rhetoric.
@sharrington1502 @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump I have not heard blatant incitements to violence. Nor have I heard them say anything worse than what Trump has said. Which is why I asked for examples.
@Navy_luke @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump What excuses have I made for either? I coted for Obama. Love some of what he did (especially for homeless vets), not thrilled with other things he did. Never voted for either Clinton. So...what was your point?
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump Oh, but I do. It‚Äôs not as though Ibstand alone in my interpretation and what that means. I say we agree to disagree. But the documents are there for anyone to find and read for themselves. And still, myboriginal comment that what Trump said was false stands.
@smacadam1 @groth_jo @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Moral fiber?! Really?! No. Just. No.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump Go back and look at all the provisions deemed unconstitutional.
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump And what, exactly, is ‚Äúmy narrative‚Äù?
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump First of all, it doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to differentiate the difference between calling for actual violence and idiomatic speech. I sincerely doubt Holder was suggesting that ‚Äúthey‚Äù PHYSICALLY ‚Äúgo low‚Äù and that‚Äôs when you PHYSICALLY ‚Äúkick them‚Äù. I mean, seriously?
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Whataboutism gets us NOWHERE. It‚Äôs as though when you can‚Äôt defend Trump based on merits, your response is ‚ÄúWell, what about when he/she said...?!‚Äù Many Dems feel like if Trump can say horrible things, why can‚Äôt we? I don‚Äôt support that, either. #TryAgain
@tstovall13 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt agree with that. And I‚Äôve never been a fan of Eric Holder. Never have I ever supported anything he‚Äôs said or done. And for the record, he‚Äôs never been president and wasn‚Äôt even AG when he said that. Way to strawman.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump President Trump has produced NOTHING substantive on which to base his claim that Tepublicans support people with pre-existing conditions while Dems will not.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump Republicans have voted over 50 times to do away with the ACA before Trump was in office. Covering pre-existing while making that coverage unaffordable for most Americans is NOT supporting people with pre-existing conditions.
@WanemacherAdam @mrs_king2017 @Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump Who are ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù? And exactly HOW are we ‚Äútrash‚Äù?!! I‚Äôm a citizen, USAF veteran, and entrepreneur. I have NEVER incited violence against ANYONE! Whom, exactly, are you talking to??
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump The fact of the matter is making a blanket statement that Republicans will support pre-existing conditions and Dems will not is totally disengenuous and NOT supported hy the facts.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump Price gouging by putting profits first and passing on the cost of covering preexisting conditions to the insured is problematic. Which is why healthcare should NOT be a profits driven industry. But that‚Äôs another argument for another day.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump They are calling the mandate which requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions unconstitutional. I don‚Äôt know where you got your 90% figure (I‚Äôd love for you to cite it so I can further research), but if they win, insurers can immediately stop covering such conditions.
@Bobby90732214 @farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump The words he‚Äôs spoken that reveal his propensity to support violence against those who disagree with him. His sociopathic ability to lie to his very supporters about those who disagree with him and portray us to be enemies, causing divisiveness.
@sharrington1502 @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm a citizen and a veteran. I believe in challenging those in power to properly represent us. Not in making excuses. I asked another citizen a question. Some of you would rather use social media as a platform to blindly argue vs engaging in honest dialogue. Why?
@sharrington1502 @jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúRight‚Äù what? My question was answered with an INNACURATE assumption based response. And you cosigned? Seriously??
@jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump I asked a legitimate question and you responded with an answer based on an assumption that I‚Äôm an MSNBC supporter. Why are you even here if you have nothing substantive to add to the conversation?
@jrokk74_jimmy @CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump I HATE MSNBC. I don‚Äôt watch that crap. Stopped watching them when I realized that no matter WHAT Obama did policy-wise, they sand his praises. Corporate media often ignores what their favorite politician does wrong, which is why I don‚Äôt follow it.
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump I despise corporate owned media. There are many who disagree with Trump who also refrain from following said media. What has he done to substantiate his claim that Republicans WILL support said coverage while Dems will not?
@Fartrell_Maine @sjvr1225 @realDonaldTrump The Republicans are currently fighting against the ACA rule that makes covering pre-existing conditions mandatory. Most Dems either want to keep the ACA as it is OR cover everyone across the board. Saying the Dems will not is a total fabrication.
@realDonaldTrump Most Corporate Dems want to keep the ACA which covers pre-existing conditions. Progressive Dems want to cover EVERYONE across the board. You are completely making things up at this point.
@realDonaldTrump There is currently a Republican led lawsuit (which you have backed) claiming that the ACA‚Äôs protection of pre-existing conditions is illegal. If they win, insurers will be able to stop covering pre-existing conditions.  The ease with which you lie is frightening.
@Drst4scss @realDonaldTrump The fact that this looks more to you like some ploy done by the left instead of some deranged person targetting the left speaks to how divided this country has become. As a vet, this shit breaks my heart and blows my mind.
@Drst4scss @realDonaldTrump But there‚Äôs already a huge amount of support out there. People are already showing out to vote early in record numbers. No one is being flipped from one side to another at this point. How could this garner support?
@CarolRicard @ElvyReilly @realDonaldTrump What worse things?
@MichaelWeez764 @akflipse @elainea88030 @realDonaldTrump What makes you think it was ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a Dem?
@akflipse @elainea88030 @realDonaldTrump There must be hundreds of people on that video, which I‚Äôm sure is being reviewed as we speak. Why release the video and endanger the lives of so many innocent people?
@farmallphil @KatMarley55 @realDonaldTrump It was when he was campaigning to become president. It speaks to his character. He didn‚Äôt magically become a better person when he became president. We are ALL citizens! Why make excuses for him instead of holding him accountable?

@aquaglass @Judith59921252 @JudgeJeanine Leas retractions than reporting. That is fact.
@aquaglass @Judith59921252 @JudgeJeanine I‚Äôm not a fan of mainstream media. I feel they could focus on more pressing issues. But what they tend to focus on about Trump tends to be true.
@aquaglass @Judith59921252 @JudgeJeanine As a vet, and someone who follows politics, I CAN say he IS an embarassment. Not because of media, but rather what comes out of his mouth.

@aquaglass @Judith59921252 @JudgeJeanine Is what they‚Äôve said about him untrue? And I ask that NOT as someone who supports the MSM, I feel they could do an overall much better job. But just as a regular person, what have they lied on him about?
@BraylenNapier @Bigsarge22 @RICKYKtweets @EricTrump Yeah, I see.

@MICHAEL_ANGEL0 @JudgeJeanine Really?? Is it only NOW such a thing?
@levisanp @JudgeJeanine You really know nothing of the man. It shows.
@bud27hockey @JudgeJeanine Where were you when they were shaming Mrs. O for baring her shoulders, slut shaming the Obama girls for their outfits at a Turkey game and when they were calling FLOTUS Obama a man and gorilla?
@aquaglass @Judith59921252 @JudgeJeanine How is the media more at fault for this that our POTUS and how he speaks about women?
@JudgeJeanine Michelle O. was called a gorilla and a man. She was disrepected all the time. Where was your outrage then? I‚Äôm a Dem veteran and American. Not a fan of what TI did, but the outrage here that was missing when it was FLOTUS Obama stands out. And is disheartening.
@MatanJoan @JudgeJeanine In all honesty, our president says things about Dems that are disgusting on a daily basis. I‚Äôm a Dem veteran. Don‚Äôt hear too much protection coming my way.
@deateale @JudgeJeanine Maybe because Michelle was called a man and and ape. When I was in BMT, no one spoke out about the things we were called. It‚Äôs called having thick skin and understanding the position you‚Äôve signed up for. Michelle never complained. It is what it is.
@dabeard I have two middle names and two last names. But I normally go by ONE middle initial and ONE last name. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my license. The only difference is on my military enlistment paperwork. I enlisted in 2002. NEVER been a problem before!
@dabeard I‚Äôve been registered to vote for years! Then I got a text from an organization I subscribe to. It asked of I was registered to vote and allowed me to check. For some reason, I wasn‚Äôt. Turns out that all of a sudden my double middle initial is an issue.

@RICKYKtweets @BraylenNapier @EricTrump Look at how bad the economy was when he became president. For businesses, workers, etc. I wish he had done more/better. And I certainly didn‚Äôt agree with all of his policies. But to pretend that he didn‚Äôt inherit a country on the brink of financial collapse &amp; turn it around? Lies
@RICKYKtweets @BraylenNapier @EricTrump That‚Äôs factually incorrect. I‚Äôm not saying this news isn‚Äôt good news, and if Trump owns it, much respect to him. But to say economic policies under Obama didn‚Äôt pull us out of the Great Recession and keep it from becoming another depression is just disengenuous.
I never really ask for help understanding the news, as I can normally comprehend on my own. But I KNOW you‚Äôre not a partisan hack so I‚Äôd LOVE if you could report on this and break it down like you do!
So while this sounds like a WIN, and I WANT US TO WIN! I will give credit where it‚Äôs due, even if it‚Äôs Trump! Wages are overwhelmingly stagnant and the cost of living is on the rise. How does this affect the regular folks in the country who keep this economy afloat? (3/)
Sounds great. But more so for the businesses and developers who come in, rebuild, and force the old members of the community out. THEN it‚Äôs great for the wealthier folks who can afford to move in. The hardworking poor folks who lived there before, be damned. (2/)
@KyleKulinski Can you please break this down? Because unless this translates to greatness for regular working class people, it just reminds me of gentrification. You know, when a dilapidated neighborhood is suddenly ‚ÄúBOOMING!‚Äù (1/) https://t.co/igb4UK1zgL

@owen_galt @real_farmacist She dressed with class ALWAYS. And I NEVER said ANYTHING about the people YOU are defending. Never even hinted at it.
@Rhonj86 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I can only speak for myself, so NOT AT ALL. I just think the way Mrs. O was spoken about by people who call Melania classy is hypocritical. I THINK the OP was pointing out that hypocrisy!
@Rhonj86 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It was all over social media and examples of it were in regular media. Just look at the comment stream in response to the post.
@owen_galt @real_farmacist She never said that. And she never looked that way. I know you think you‚Äôre ‚Äúruffling the feathers of lefties‚Äù, but you‚Äôre not. As a liberal leaning veteran, who comes from a long line of veterans, you simply have me wondering who are these ‚Äúgreat‚Äù people we were defending?
@MagaRational @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump But we are now looking through the lens of how the right treated her compared to howbthey treat Melania, and simply calling out the hypocrisy. Had we never had to see her endure that treatment, I‚Äôm sure the conversation would be totally different.
@MagaRational @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Maybe if they hadn‚Äôt, so many on the left wouldn‚Äôt have so much to say about Melania. She IS a beautiful, stylish woman. I‚Äôve also heard that she speaks several languages. Kudos to her. (1/)
@MagaRational @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs the point. She never complained. She never attempted to troll the media then complain about it. She‚Äôs NOT a Goddess. She‚Äôs an educated, strong, classy woman. And right wing media always found a way to belittle her despite that.
@sqrlnutz @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump God has allowed you a certain amount of moments on this earth. And you‚Äôd waste them by trolling and responding to your own troll comments...for what?
@CraigMcNamara12 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is it? Really? Or are you just content with wasting the precious time God has given you to troll on social media?
@Jeff99425934 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You seriously created a Twitter account merely to troll. How do you feel good about wasting the time God has given you to do that? Spending the moments your blessed with ONLY to create more division. I just don‚Äôt get it.
@haust1967 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You are a part of the problem. And I‚Äôm ashamed that you are an American. You can feel however you feel about her husband‚Äôs policies, BUT Miss O is a classy, educated woman. Had she lived the life Melania lived prior to being 1st Lady, she NEVER would have been 1st Lady. Truth.

@Qnation6 @real_farmacist @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I agree that there is a push for the American people to be divided. However, Melania believing that she is suffering from some indignity that those before her didn‚Äôt is ridiculous.
@qldlander @real_farmacist Why are you here?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This was my ONLY duty station and a huge part of my life and so many others! The LEAST you could have done is shown up and seen the devastation on the ground firsthand. I am thoroughly disgusted.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You didn‚Äôt even visit Tyndall AFB! The base that took a direct hit from Michael. As a vet who served there, visiting Eglin was NOT enough. Tyndall was DEVISTATED! A training base that is home to the F-22 and trains our pilots! Flying over is NOT the same!
@ChatmanRommel @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, EVERYONE doesn‚Äôt know. Many of his fans have been duped into believing him. To their demise.
@realDonaldTrump You are such a liar. You consistently mislead your base and lie about what progressive Dems want. How do you sleep at night?
@Wisdom_4_Hire @CarolineGasper1 @Jim_Jordan I accept your apology and appreciate your ability to be sensible. It is extremely difficult as a vet who volunteered to protect EVERYONE to hear a president consistently lie about what I stand for and believe as a liberal Dem and hear people cheer it on. And it never stops.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I would think with all of thebjudges out there, they could have come up with someone better. I don‚Äôt understand whybit was so important to push this man through. (3/3)
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Sometimes their trials go on for months! Yet, they‚Äôre expected to hold it together. Even as their lives are ruined. As a judge, I would expect nothing less of him! He didn‚Äôt exhibit that. (2/)
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I would not. But I don‚Äôt feel he‚Äôs fit. Even based on his behavior during the hearings. There are folks who are falsely accused who must maintain proper order and decorum in court, even when convicted of a crime they didn‚Äôt commit. (1/)
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Same to you. Neither of us was there. And that is fact. So all we have is speculation.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan But there is. And I‚Äôm speaking of President Clinton. You have NEVER heard me soeak in defense of HRC, so whatever to that point.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I may or may not have told you, I know several women who have been assaulted and never reported it. In both instances it happened during/after a party. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find witnesses to either. Most have probably forgotten the ‚Äúparty‚Äù. In a slew of other party memories.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan What, her brother‚Äôs connections? Listen, I‚Äôm ‚Äúconnected to‚Äù people I don‚Äôt always agree with. Can‚Äôt always help whom you‚Äôre connected to. You have a right to not believe her. I have a right to not believe him. But you‚Äôre speaking as though your beliefs are facts.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Actually, no one said she was untruthful.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan PROVE SHE‚ÄôS LYING.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan My question is how do you prove she‚Äôs lying?
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I was honest with you. Clinton or Kavanaugh. Honest. I see you mean nothingness.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Do you have wirds of your own?
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan She went to a therapist. His BF called it out. Just stop.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan She was NOT talking about sexual assault.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I am a victim and a witness. Fuck you.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Fuck you.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan He assaulted me too. And they didn‚Äôt believe me. Fuck you.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Lord knows if I and my bestie were as passed out as he thought we were, he would have no clue. I spoke up, she didn‚Äôt. Imagine if she was Ford. And no she didn‚Äôt speak up. If she brought it up today, I would be the friend the WH refused to listen to. Think about that!
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Even the though there were people at the same party. He was an upstanding officer. Sat on the board at his church. They didn‚Äôt believe what I told them about him. Lord knows they wouldn‚Äôt believe her. I HAPPENED to HEAR her assault...
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan If I didn‚Äôt happen to witness it, she would have no witnesses that she knew of.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan PLEASE shut ALL THE WAY THE FUCK UP.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I was sexually assaulted before. I know of assaults that took place over ten years ago that I would never speak up about without their consent. And after what happened to me when I spoke up, I would understand if they didn‚Äôt consent.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I thought if I showed you mine you would show me yours. You‚Äôre full of shit. Bot.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I swear it‚Äôs not nonsense
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Even though what is happening is in violation of international law.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Please google about the Saudis at his hotels, and him doing the largest weapons deal ever in America‚Äôs history! Then look at what‚Äôs happening in Yemen and why we won‚Äôt intercede.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I have a question for you.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Anything else? Let‚Äôs go deeper.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I don‚Äôt feel Obama destroyed our military. I was in Contracting when I was in. I understand how money is spent. Obama actually did the same as his predecessors. I served under Bush. And worked for the gov under Obama. I have no reason to lie. My obligation is to the people.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary. So, next question.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I HATE government corruption. ESPECIALLY AS A VET! I don‚Äôt want my brothers and sisters to be put on the front line of wars that are only meant to enhance pockets!!! Which is why I hate Trump and the Saudis with whom he does business. I‚Äôm not caught up with Russia. Again, #facts
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Ok, first off, I‚Äôm NOT OK with open borders, either. I believe in a vetting process as most liberals do. The only ones who say we don‚Äôt believe in that are the memes. Hell, Obama deported more than any other president before him. Check the facts!
@DearGoodPeople @misspete64 @Jim_Jordan I feel you sis. But I just got done working. I have a bit of time tonight. I‚Äôm always willing to extend an olive branch. I just hope he‚Äôs worth it. If not, he will simply be more of the same reason I took my butt around my neighborhood to ensure EVERYONE is registered to vote!
@realDonaldTrump @FlatUranusOrg_ Is this real? Democrats ARE AMERICANS, TOO! I‚Äôm a Democratic vet! I come from a long line of vets! THIS is unAmerican!
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan You said ‚Äúliberalism is a mental disorder‚Äù. What would make you say that? Especially since liberalism looks out for you AND me with OUR tax dollars. Also, how do you KNOW she‚Äôs ‚Äúlying‚Äù? Why don‚Äôt you believe her?
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan For the record, I WAS rude to you first (You responded with nothing but hashtags...sue me).  But you were ALSO vapid before AND after telling me to ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù. So there‚Äôs that. But now, let‚Äôs have this conversation. Maybe we can have a meeting of the minds. That should be the goal
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I‚Äôm sorry. Let me invite you into my safe space. What do you have to add to the conversation aside from hashtags and insults? I‚Äôll start. I‚Äôm a veteran who isn‚Äôt OK with tax dollars going to the military industrial complex. Your turn.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan I am NOT easily ruffled by nonsense. And I research EVERYTHING. Nothing I have said has been false. As I said, I owe no allegiance to any party. I have welcomed, from you, open dialogue to discuss the actual politics. And all you have is...nothingness.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan ‚ÄúGet off the plantation‚Äù? üòÇ Once again, you have said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Just inflammatory insults meant to provoke an argument. #BeBetter
@DearGoodPeople @misspete64 @Jim_Jordan Noam Chomskey put it perfectly when he said Trump has accomplished the rather impressive task of passing legislation that overwhelmingly protects the rich elite while maintaining a strong working class base that believes he is the enemy of the elites. It‚Äôs uncanny, really.
@DearGoodPeople @misspete64 @Jim_Jordan Roger Stone is a huge part of developing the cult that too many Trump supporters belong to. And he‚Äôs even admitted to tapping into the hearts of ‚Äúpolitically unsophisticated voters‚Äù using some of the tactics of the Southern Strategy. It‚Äôs sad that so many don‚Äôt see it.
@DearGoodPeople @misspete64 @Jim_Jordan Sis, we TRULY live in an era of defending feel good cults of personality in place of real political discourse among citizens. I study Anerican politics in my spare time and this is truly unprecedented IN OUR LIFETIME. But for the country, not so much.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan What‚Äôs most problematic is the mental gymnastics one would have to do to overtly claim that Ford is a liar. ESPECIALLY when Trump paraded out women who claimed to be sexual assault victims of Clinton as a political tactic. All of these men are gross.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan Also, for the record, victims of sexual assault not being believed isn‚Äôt new news. It‚Äôs not even a particularly American problem. And it‚Äôs certainly not a win for anyone.
@misspete64 @DearGoodPeople @Jim_Jordan You have literally said nothing. You simply posted a bunch of hashtags. Saying ‚Äúliberalism is a mental disorder‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a real opinion on liberal values, which I‚Äôd be more than happy to discuss. It‚Äôs an insult made to promote an argument rather than discussion. #BeBetter
@CarolineGasper1 @Wisdom_4_Hire @Jim_Jordan I may tend to have generally more liberal leanings, but I‚Äôm a vet. An American FIRST. And I care about ALL Americans. Not just one party. Which is why I believe in holding ALL politicians responsible, regardless of affiliation. Also why I HATE partisan rhetoric and insults.
@CarolineGasper1 @Wisdom_4_Hire @Jim_Jordan I ONLY brought up the party issue because of how the original statement is worded. I‚Äôm not deeply enough invested in EITHER party or any politician to be that offended.
@CarolineGasper1 @Wisdom_4_Hire @Jim_Jordan And a crook is INDEED a crook. Which is why I‚Äôll never understand why so many Trump supporters insist on calling out other people‚Äôs misdeeds and chanting they should be ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù while pretending Trump is blameless.
@CarolineGasper1 @Wisdom_4_Hire @Jim_Jordan Everyone in one party won‚Äôt agree on everything. Fact is, there are some lifelong Repubs who simply don‚Äôt agree with Trump. Same on the Dem side. In politics, there is ALWAYS room for nuance. That‚Äôs a good thing.

@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I feel you took the partisan/easy route. Assumed that I am more partisan that I am and insulted me based on that assumption. It‚Äôs a huge reason why regular citizens like I can‚Äôt discuss likes/dislikes across the table. It‚Äôs done by folks on both sides
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS WHY would you feel essentially that nothing in this current administration could appease me? I‚Äôm not a hack. I didn‚Äôt say anything hacky. So???
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS False. I was HAPPY to hear he did away with NAFTA. NOT happy to see some of the same things I hated about NAFTA show up in this most recent trade agreement, but it is what it is.
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS And to your point, I‚Äôve NEVER bought a pair of Hammer pants in my life. So there‚Äôs that.
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS She showed up IN AFRICA, where the ONLY ones who wore that garb were collonizers and slavers! WHY are you defending this?
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS And FYI, not all in Germany at that time were nazis. So...
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS Your strawman has collapsed. But the question is, why offer it up to begin with? Why not try to understand other people‚Äôs culture and why they feel how they feel?
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS You sound ridiculous. Clearly, that was never associated with the nazis. They wore shoes, too! No one seems to have a problem with those! ü§î It‚Äôs about what is associated with whom. Pith hats were associated with colonizers/slavers. ESPECIALLY on the continent of Africa.
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS She showed up in a garment that represents the people who enslaved/colonized us. Why do that? Would she show up in Israel with a swastika on her sleeve?
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS A swastika is a symbol, not even a garment. But what is understood needs no explanation. You simply have no respect of what this means to some. If you did, you wouldn‚Äôt defend it.
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS *remains
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS We don‚Äôt have to go down a timeline for that, though I‚Äôm welcome to it because I‚Äôm not an ass and I wouldn‚Äôt be bothered by not wearing things that represent those who enslaved or colonized another group of people!
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS Correlation may not equal causation, but we live in a world that respects the fact that you do not wear a swastika because of what it represents but DOS and those who live with colonization are told to be quiet if offended by fashion choices that promote those who subjugated us.
@dandude2 @WatfordGoldie @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @albamonica @FLOTUS The holocaust didn‚Äôt happen BECAUSE of the swastika! But the symbolism temains relevant to this day! It DID have something to do with slavery because it was a garment wore by slavers and colonizers.
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS Imagine the Holocaust on steroids! Yet, we‚Äôre told that we‚Äôre ‚Äúexpecting perfection‚Äù?! FOH!
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS The fact that it is being mimimized, knowing what slavery and colonization means to us, says a lot.
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS Maybe a lay person wouldn‚Äôt be expected to understand why what she wore was controversial, as things that affect Africans often aren‚Äôt pushed to the forefront. But as FLOTUS, you are ALWAYS expected to be ON and to properly represent the people of this country.
@Mill1Eric @Magdalena0113 @Comixgrrl @RejectMobRule @albamonica @FLOTUS It‚Äôs not about expecting perfection, but, rather, decency and understanding. If she visited Germany with a swastika on her arm, if would be understood.  Expecting more would not be chalked up to ‚Äúexpecting perfection‚Äù.

@ItsMeJessAriane @etherealmuse @Uranicasum @albamonica @FLOTUS The MSM sucks! I agree! But it doesn‚Äôt take away from this. If I say, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs wearing the uniform of her people who colonized Africa anyway‚Äù I‚Äôd be called a racist. But it‚Äôs the truth. And why this is problematic.
@ItsMeJessAriane @etherealmuse @Uranicasum @KnightThemUp @albamonica @FLOTUS I will say, she ALWAYS looks chic. However, time and place. Stilletos to a hurricane ridden place. Maybe a bit tone deaf. A jacket that says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù, not the best option. And a pith hat to Africa which is representative of those worn by the colonizers? Not a good idea.
@ItsMeJessAriane @etherealmuse @Uranicasum @KnightThemUp @albamonica @FLOTUS I‚Äôm happy you weren‚Äôt vapid enough to shame a first lady for baring her shoulders. But when Melania has made the news for her wardrobe choices, there were very real reasons why.

@Uranicasum @theryanatkins @ItsMeJessAriane @KnightThemUp @albamonica @FLOTUS Lol No one reserves a ‚Äúright‚Äù to be offended. It‚Äôs not about liking or disliking. I thought it looked chic until I learned what it represented. I‚Äôm a DOS in the US. I was ignorant. Now that I know, I understand. Nothing wrong with learning and respecting other cultures.
@theryanatkins @Uranicasum @ItsMeJessAriane @KnightThemUp @albamonica @FLOTUS You are! And no one representing the government is slamming you for it! However, other citizens have the right to explain THEIR OWN opinions, as well. She IS free to wear whatever she wants. Just as she has done.

@moorx_ But will beat the shit out of a son who displays homosexual leanings. Regardless of what you call it, the behavior and attitude is what must be addressed.
@Raquel_Savage @KStall93 We MUST have these conversation openly and honestly, WITHOUT the labels. Because black people like my mom and uncle SWEAR they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhomophobic‚Äù. But the behaviors displayed tell another story.
@Raquel_Savage @KStall93 His hatred for homosexuals was directly linked to his fear of being found out as a closeted bisexual (possibly homosexual). My family isn‚Äôt open to that stuff at all. When my friend came out as gay, I asked my mom how she would feel. She got pissed at me for even ASKING!
@Raquel_Savage @KStall93 Later, we found out back when my uncle used to get high, he would ask chica to fuck him up the butt! He is also known for being a bit ‚Äútoo freaky‚Äù for women we knew who would prostitute themselves out. And masturbating with men while high.
@Raquel_Savage @KStall93 I had an uncle who would physically abuse his gay stepson. Would try to ‚Äútoughen him up‚Äù by punching him in the chest and shit. Trying to ‚Äúbeat the gay out of him‚Äù as a child. His fianc√© eventually left him. Kudos to her.

@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama What did he say that was so problematic? Was he supposed to completely remain silent? He told people to respect the authorities. He called those looting in Baltimore ‚Äúthugs‚Äù. Never has he ‚Äúsided‚Äù with BLM. Did you actually LISTEN to him????
@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama I‚Äôm not a super Obama supporter. I took issue with many of his policies. HOWEVER, you people make the most politically unsophisticated, meme-based arguments. It‚Äôs just sad. Just say you didn‚Äôt like him and be done with it! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama He wasn‚Äôt the president of Chicago. He was the president of the US. A president is not supposed to tell local governments (governors, mayors, etc) how to run their states/cities. You do know that, right?
@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama I hear this stuff over and over with no factual evidence behind it. The issues with police in communities of color existed long before he got into office. Camden NJ started a community based policing program which has been successful. Obama came to Camden to support them.
@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama He said we need to respect police. He has never ‚Äúsided‚Äù with BLM. And when did he interject opinion before facts were in? Do tell.
@doreenb8 @shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama How was that his job? Every man must work out his own soul‚Äôs salvation. I never saw him PROVOKE racism. That is my point. If someone is racist, I don‚Äôt see how that fault would rest with him.
@shawndoc14 @JimFKenney @BarackObama I know white nationalists and the KKK have stated that their membership numbers SURGED when he became president. But I‚Äôd hardly blame him for that.

@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh As more and more stories come out of why vixtims of sexual assault come out, the default position for many men is still, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs lying‚Äù. It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt even matter. Like our experiences don‚Äôt matter.
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh We have to relive a traumatic incident over and over, which is further traumatizing and humiliating, in search of justice that often never comes. It is NOT so simple.
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh Historically, the most common response from men, who overwhelmingly control our systems, is disbelief. If a man seems like a good guy, is attractive, and has money or power, the question is always ‚ÄúWHY would he do that?!‚Äù
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh That happened to me AFTER the year 2000! Lord only knows what it was loke for her in the 80‚Äôs.
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh She KNEW what speaking up in the military meant. I learned. Sexual assault is not the same as other crimes. AT ALL.
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh She didn‚Äôt want to speak up out of fewr of reprisal. I, however, chose to speak up. I wasn‚Äôt believed due to his ‚Äúoutstanding character‚Äù. üòí I was pretty much shunned in my squadron after that.
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh You are oversimplifying something that is far too nuanced for that. I was sexually assaulted by someone in the military. He raped another woman at a party I attended. The following week I discussed it with her...
It amazes me that the ‚Äúparty of moral authority‚Äù is trying to rush thru an accused sexual assaulter out of fear that the Dems will do to them what they did for the entire final year of Obama‚Äôs presidency. That is just...WOW. #KanavaughHearings
I sincerely HATE the current state of politics in our country. I‚Äôd check out completely if it wasn‚Äôt so damn important.
@Jim_Jordan Kaepernick stood up for something he believed in. Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault. No comparison. And I HARDLY think you‚Äôre in a position to so brazenly speak on this given your past.
There are far too many man who seemingly HATE women. They are truly triggered by the #KavanaughFordHearings I get why it‚Äôs triggering for victims of sexual assault. But if you‚Äôve never been falsely accused, why so much hatred and vitriol??
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt believe her. But calling her a lying whore is a bit out of line. Like WHY the vitriol?
@holop88 @YourAnonNews @Judge_Kavanaugh OR it was a traumatic event that happened decades ago and she‚Äôs more likely to remember the event then the date and time. In all honesty, it‚Äôs not that uncommon.
@joshtpm Most who are in and out of courts for months display more humility and self control than he did.
@joshtpm Judges expect respect for decorum regardless of why you‚Äôre there. You could be on trial for a crime you didn‚Äôt commit, finding out the courts are taking your children away - ANYTHING. Most in that position are stressed. He failed to display what is demanded of the rest of us.

@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump How did he divide the nation? Because Trump is OBVIOUSLY doing so right now. And MANY white supremacists have said Obama‚Äôs election brought in recruitment numbers they hadn‚Äôt seen in decades. AND Trump‚Äôs dogwhistles speak to them! Those are facts.  Are you talking about that?
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump While we‚Äôre conceding based on facts, you MUST admit that the jobs growth trend that Trump claims as his own was started (and far longer) under Obama. Now we can get into stagnant wages, and I am HERE for that conversation. I owe NO allegiance to ANY man, only facts!
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump But I‚Äôm loving this! Yesss! Bring on the FACTS! I STILL think agreeing so full heartedly with that bullshit meme was seemingly beneath you based on the fact that you SEEM to care about facts. #BeBetter But, yes, let‚Äôs continue the dialogue.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump And full disclosure: I have my own opinions as it pertains to that topic. I am the niece of a former police officer who is deceased and my ex-fiance‚Äôs father (who was like a father to me) was a detective. So I‚Äôm not biased in either direction. I KNOW the work the GOOD cops do!
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump To my recollection, he didn‚Äôt speak out against officers more than I heard him applaud them. Many were upset by that. But either he felt how he felt, or his hands were tied as he was the first black president and didn‚Äôt want to be tied to being a president who was anti cop.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump Now please show me the stats he provided compared to the stats you have, that I assume you vetted.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump Not that that has anything to do with the meme you responded to which prompted me to respond to you. But I will say I‚Äôm happy I did respond. And I LOVE the fact thay we can have a discussion without hurling insults and nonsense. This is good.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump In all honesty, I have zero recollection of Obama producing those types of statistics. And I was studying Criminal Justice under the tutelage of a police sergeant from Philadelphia at the time. I got ALL my stats from official sources, not Obama.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump But are you saying that you admit that Obama‚Äôs policies saved the economy from the brink of disaster, but you just don‚Äôt agree with HOW it was done?

@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters tend to worship him and pretend he does no wrong and everything he does is great. That‚Äôs crap. No one should be like that for him or any other president. But we should at least be honest. That meme was complete nonsense.
@robertosavorani @RedPilledMommy @realDonaldTrump The economy could have continued to dip and been worse than the Great Depression! You can‚Äôt take away the fact that his policies kept that from happeningg and turned things around. He has also had the longest streak of jobs growth under any presidency. Just be honest.

I didn‚Äôt even vote for HRC and I‚Äôm still tired of hearing this. Is Trump winning the election all it took for you to be satisfied?? This isn‚Äôt a football game. This shit really matters.
@realDonaldTrump I thought we were supposed to see the effects of the tax breaks in our paychecks. Overwhelmingly, that HAS NOT happened! ‚ÄúTrickle down‚Äù appears to not be working. Please go back to the drawing board instead of patting yourself on the back!
@realDonaldTrump Now let‚Äôs work on wages! Because NONE of that matters to working class Americans who can‚Äôt afford to invest. Especially when the cost of staple products continues to rise, outpacing the rise of wages. Jobs are great, but NO ONE wants to be counted among the working poor!
@realDonaldTrump The VA is still understaffed and we vets still face ridiculous wait times for appointments far too often. If you‚Äôre all about the vets and the troops, handle THAT! It affects us FAR MORE than NFL players peacefully protesting.
@creatia @WalshFreedom @Franklin_Graham @johnpavlovitz Agreed!!!
@WalshFreedom Whoa whoa, slow down, chief. You‚Äôre moving into the realm of logic. People don‚Äôt like that.
@ryanegorman @WalshFreedom @karencrawford16 As a veteran, I‚Äôd certainly appreciate more timely appointments with the VA (been waiting seven months for one appointment because they‚Äôre ‚Äúunderstaffed‚Äù)  than people trolling on social media over football players taking a knee during the anthem. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@MsRed_Mel @TRUMP_2020_PLUS @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews Sis, don‚Äôt even waste your time or energy on these folks. At this point, those who fail to even show objectivity or empathy aren‚Äôt worth debating this with. They get a kick out of us getting upset because a teenage boy was murdered. They‚Äôll support Zimmerman until the end.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews One look at your timeline shows me everything I need to know about your hypocrisy. And one look at your name shows me your head is so far up 45‚Äôs ass you don‚Äôt know where he ends and where you begin. Let alone what it means to be a good person. #Muted
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews You think calling someone a racist or being called one is worse than actually being one. Dialogue with you is a waste of time. Get lost.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews People like you are what make social media platforms like Twitter a cesspool and are why this country is as divided. You show zero empathy or ovjectivity.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews You have called Trayvon a thug, called me a racist, and failed to back up either statement. Which is WHY you are nothing more than a troll.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews Several have stated that based on the way they were told to analuze the evidence, they feel they were forced to come to the conclusion they did. Regardless, my post that you responded tonight were not about Trayvon. They were about Zimmerman‚Äôs actions since then.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews One juror has gone on record saying that she felt Zimmerman got away with murder. When another spoke up saying she felt Zimmerman‚Äôs heart was in the right place when he pursued Trayvon, several others spoke up and said on record that her comments did not reflect their feelings.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews You are, indeed, a troll.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews People like you seem to forget (or simply fail to acknowledge) how their entire encounter began. Yet, you call ME a racist. It would be laughable if it wasn‚Äôt so damn sad.
@DJT_America @Alisha12287 @TheBlastNews Tell me HOW Trayvon was a ‚Äúthug‚Äù. And why you don‚Äôt feel being stalked (pursued stealthily, by definition) would make someone deem it necessary to defend themselves.

@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump Healthcare companies spend way more on admin costs than the VA or Medicare. We have the worst healthcare of developed nations based on costs and outcomes. We can and should do better.

@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump All the data shows that universal healthcare, when you consider premiums, deductables, amd out of pocket costs for pharmaceuticals, will coat WAY less
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump Actually, all the data shows that universal healthcare will be cheaper. Premiums skyrocketed under the ACA because healthcare providers were made to pay for pre-existing conditions. They passed the costs onto their customers.
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump During his campaign, when discussed how wrong he was, he didn‚Äôt even apologize. And they were kids!
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump Look at who he has always been. When has he ever favored the middle class or poor? Hell, he even tried to work with his father to keep black people out of his buildings (fact) and called for the death penalty for the  Central Park Five.

@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump He had so much to say about Wall Street, yet he hired Wall Street prople into his cabinet and said he did ao because he wanted to hire rich folks.
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump The fact that he said Mexico would pay for the border, yet he‚Äôs teying to force us to do so.
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump When he promised more affordable healthcare that would cover everyone amd all pre-existing conditions.
@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump The tax cuts that primarily benefit the rich. The fact that he (nor Congress) made it mandatory that they use the cuts to pay for working class jobs even tho that‚Äôs what they sold the cuts on. The fact that we have lost people covered by healthcare by his exec orders.

@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with the fact that you insulted ME! Without even knowing what I believe in. Simply because I called out Trump for NOT draining the swamp, which he hasn‚Äôt!

@Aristotle_Code @Shaduby63 @realDonaldTrump To ask of I know what ‚Äúfact‚Äù means is insulting. I was being facetious. He is CLEARLY part of the swamp he promised to drain.

@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube And I presume your guess is just as qualified as the professionals who conducted the experiment and the data they compiled.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube Some showed anger. Some were smiling. Some were professionally dressed. Some were casually dressed. There were instances of men of both races wearing ‚Äústreet clothes‚Äù. But, I mean, I only watched the experiment. I supposed your guess is sufficient. üòí
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube The earth being spherical is not the same as shooting someone in the back or shooting unarmed people because you deem them to be threats. That really was a non sequitur.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube They were actually surprised by the fact that the black participants responded the same way as the whote ones. Which indicated that there may be societal things we are taught about black men that could cause people of all races to deem them as threats.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube And to be frank, they made all other factors as similar as possible to avoid those types of arguments. The experiment was conducted to study how when all other factors remain the same, how people respond based on race.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube Question: How can you be ‚Äúsure‚Äù about a study you‚Äôve never seen? It almost SEEMS as though you are so stuck on your opinion that you would claim that anything that challenges it must be false.
@Geekdad4 @Gsquare9 @AjadeanPiper @SandiOdom @ReutersBiz @Breakingviews Indeed!!!
@Geekdad4 @Gsquare9 @AjadeanPiper @SandiOdom @ReutersBiz @Breakingviews But what I‚Äôve actually found is that often times when I attempt to facilitate the conversations, I‚Äôm ignored or blocked. Or they depend on others (i.e. Youtube videos) to make their arguments for them.
@Geekdad4 @Gsquare9 @AjadeanPiper @SandiOdom @ReutersBiz @Breakingviews You know, I hear all these complaints that liberals are unwilling to have open honest discussions about these things, and we simply call whoever disagrees with us ‚Äúracists‚Äù or ‚Äúnazis‚Äù.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube MANY officers find that to be unjustifiable. And in cases of death, straight up murder. I was surprised to hear officers say that in class because most don‚Äôt do so publicly.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube What‚Äôs justifiable is ABSOLUTELY subjective. Are you kidding?! That‚Äôs why these situations are so widely debated, even amongst police officers. For instance, shooting a person who is running away.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube The entire point of the simulation was that based on statistical data, black men are more likely to be shot. Police officers took part in the experiment. That was the catalyst behind the entire experiment. As well as the decision to use both black &amp; white officers.
@JayFree_b @BUVTHALAW @JoeBates1992 @KyleKulinski @YouTube The differences were sometimes the people in the simulation were armed and sometimes they were not. Sometimes they had a cell phone, or some other benign thing.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone Not only have I discussed with friends who live in Canada, but I also brought up several other countries‚Äô healthcare systems where universal healthcare has been successful. Regardless of that, we still have the worst healthcare system of all developed nations.
@PageSix Say what you will about her, this is good work.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone I would LOVE for our healthcare system to work the same way. But as long as Big Pharma and healthcare insurance companies have politicians in their pockets, they will never be honest about this.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone More money goes to administrative costs with healthcare companies  than with the VA or Medicate. There are ways to implement a system that works for all of us. The way we enjoy police protections and firefighters services without receiving a bill is awesome.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone The ACA increased costs for some because in a capitalist system, we can‚Äôt dictate how healthcare companies set prices. When companies were forced to cover pre-existing conditions, they passed those costs onto their customers.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone Look at the UK, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, etc. There are numerous examples of successful universal healthcare programs. Also, having universal healthcare doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt purchase supplemental healthcare if you so choose.
@HWonderstein @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi THAT is what is called a non sequitur. Things like acne have been deemed a ‚Äúpreexisting condition‚Äù for people with skin cancer. Uterine fibroids can be viewed as a pre-existing condition as it pertains to women‚Äôs health coverage. Who is talking about abortions?
@realpragmatic @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi If we can afford a space force, huge tax cut for the rich, and building infrastructure abroad - or the longest war in this country‚Äôs history, with no end in sight - we should be able to afford universal healthcare.
@realpragmatic @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi Universal healthcare would net save us money when compared to the ACA and free market. We‚Äôre talking zero deductibles, premiums, and out of pocket costs for pharmaceuticals. This would benefit all of us.
@realpragmatic @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi A larger chunk of what we pay to healthcare insurance companies are used on administrative costs than with the VA or Medicare. We have the worst healthcare of all developed nations based on costs and outcomes.
@realpragmatic @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi I guess when we say ‚Äúfree‚Äù, we expect too much to be understood. You know how you can call the police or fire department without getting a bill? Because your taxes pay for it. THAT is what we would like to see done with healthcare in this country.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone Universal healthcare net SAVES is money compared to both the ACA AND the free market based on data compiled by both parties. Imagine no premiums, deductibles, or out of pocket costs for pharmaceuticals.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone We have the worst healthcare system of all developed nations based on costs and outcomes. That shouldn‚Äôt be so. We also shouldn‚Äôt be at the whim of greedy healthcare companies.
@HersheyLulu @FrankPallone Why do you want the government out of healthcare? We pay taxes. We should benefit from them. I‚Äôd rather have universal healthcare then a space force or continuing to build infrastructure for other countries.
@FuckTheBritish @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi Healthcare should never be viewed as a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù in a developed nation.
@FuckTheBritish @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi Our healthcare system is the worst in the developed world based on costs AND outcomes. If we have money for a massive tax cut for the rich, a space force, infrastructure in other countries, we have money to provide healthcare for our citizens.
@robbear7748 @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi And if you think for one minute these greedy healthcare companies will lower premiums back to what they were before and keep the same level of protections the ACA provided, you are fooling yourself.
@robbear7748 @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi The establishment Dems want the status quo. And Republicans want to go back to the system we had before. They are both completely disingenuous about the money and lives universal healthcare would save.
@robbear7748 @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi Yes, taxes increase. HOWEVER, there are no more premiums or deductables. No more out of pocket costs for pharmaceuticals. This ends up balancing out for the majority of us.
@robbear7748 @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi You know how you solve that? Remove the middle man altogether. The overall cost of universal healthcare actually net saves taxpayers money when compared to the ACA and the free matket healthcare system we had prior to the ACA.
@robbear7748 @FrankPallone @NancyPelosi The outrage has come from progressives who want our tax dollars to go to universal healthcare. The ACA improved healthcare standards for many people, but it‚Äôs not enough. Insurance companies raised rates as covering pre-existing conditions raised costs.
@Steve3449 @FrankPallone @HouseDemocrats During my time without insurance, I‚Äôve developed a pretty serious health condition which, in many cases, will preclude me from obtaining insurance in the future. There are many in my position who DON‚ÄôT have the VA to depend on.
@Steve3449 @FrankPallone @HouseDemocrats But what about people who have had lapses in insurance? When my last contract ended, I lost my insurance. The only job I could get after that didn‚Äôt offer insurance. I‚Äôve been totally depent on the VA, which is its own nightmare. (1/)

@BlutoActual @johnpavlovitz @johnrich @Nike But I see this conversation is going nowhere. So to you, good night. It‚Äôs still pretty hot out. Try not to melt ‚ùÑÔ∏èüòâ
@BlutoActual @johnpavlovitz @johnrich @Nike They don‚Äôt OWE you that. YOUR problem, and the problem many people like you have, is that you feel entitled. They can peacefully protest however they choose. Just because it makes folks like YOU uncomfortable doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre wrong.

@BlutoActual @johnpavlovitz @johnrich @Nike Peacefully protesting by taking a knee, EXPLAINING the purpose of your protest, putting your time and money where your mouth is - NONE of these actions are harmful to the cause.
@BlutoActual @johnpavlovitz @johnrich @Nike They aren‚Äôt harming it. Ignorant people who were uninterested in the cause to begin with, who would rather strawman and try to force people to protest the way THEY deem suitable (and the people who coddle them) are actually the ones doing harm.

@realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs be honest. Your followers hold you to a far lesser standard than previous presidents. They will admit that you‚Äôre a liar, then somehow say they trust you. ü§î What I can thank you for is showing how regardless of party, neither has our best interest at heart.
@EnriqueMFlores3 @Mikel_Jollett @Sweetling Many of our so-called public servants are horrendous.

@EnriqueMFlores3 @Mikel_Jollett @Sweetling I don‚Äôt think he was saying that. Ibthink he was just pointing out that there‚Äôs a time and place for everything. And as horrible as some of us feel Meghan is, the humane thing to do is just chill for a minute to allow her to grieve.
@Mikel_Jollett @Sweetling @EnriqueMFlores3 Unfortunately, Twitter is where people come to lose all sense of morality and say the horrible things they hold deep inside under the guise of anonymity. Most of these people would NEVER say such things socially, offline.

@wizgicianbrb @WobblyB25 @shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo This is the ugly truth that people don‚Äôt want to face. Those who depend on the MSM for their info honestly don‚Äôt know. He did some good things, but he was NOT without flaws.
@LeslieMac It seems to be the American way.
@FaerieWhings @shouldITbonfire @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @WobblyB25 @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo That‚Äôs right! We may not have state run media, but we have corporate owned media. And when the corporations have the politicians in their pockets, it‚Äôs basically the same thing!
@WobblyB25 @shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo And I despise Trump. But facts are facts.
@WobblyB25 @shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo He also signed a bill that allows people to be held indefinitely without trial. That is totally contrary to what we stand for as a country. I‚Äôm not going to run down a long list. I‚Äôm just saying that the MSM didn‚Äôt report these thinhs the way they do with Trump. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@WobblyB25 @shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo 90% of drone strikes killed innocent civilians. We can also all agree that the decision to go into Libya was a disastrous one. I‚Äôm not saying the man was the worst president (or worse than what we have now), but I don‚Äôt believe in framing him as perfect.
@shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @WobblyB25 @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo That‚Äôs why it pissed me off seeing how many people supported his stance on Libya AND Syria, but hated Bush for Iraq! We‚Äôre so divided along party lines that we‚Äôve become hypocritical as it pertains to the actions of our country‚Äôs leaders.
@shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @WobblyB25 @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo And, unfortunately, their decision to NOT hold him accountable, when they now lambast Trump EVERY SINGLE DAY (deservingly) makes them look hypocritical and biased. And it feeds the fire he inspires in his base when he (untruthfully) says the media ‚Äúattacks‚Äù him.
@shouldITbonfire @FaerieWhings @mcyost @IAM_MRJXXIII @ItIsClit @WobblyB25 @zombiecheney @BellevilleKid @martsendo That‚Äôs why I HATE the MSM. Obama was such a media darling (due to his intelligence and charisma) that they overwhelmingly let him off the hook when his administration acted counter to what the American people wanted. He was NOT perfect.
@Prescribed_Naps @Donnough1 @FakeOliviaPope @martsendo To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt support anyone with a platform that doesn‚Äôt coincide with what the American public wants. The DNC seems to be content with campaigning AGAINST Trump without giving substantive ideas as to what they stand for. That‚Äôs problematic.
@meowlickss @JeffreeRando @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope The Saudis were horrendous before and they still are. The deal should never have happened. Now, the genocide in Yemen is happening seemingly with our approval.
@meowlickss @JeffreeRando @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope I only know what actually happened. I try not to speculate. Perhaps he would have. Obama was not without his flaws. However, he DIDN‚ÄôT. And the largest arms deal in American history with the Saudis happened on Trump‚Äôs watch. That‚Äôs what we KNOW.
@gtessitore30 @Prescribed_Naps @Donnough1 @FakeOliviaPope @martsendo Capitalism sounds great on paper. But when monopolies are allowed and unfettered greed and corruption take over, it becomes a system that creates a permanent underclass which only grows as the power (money) becomes more centralized.
@Electroflxmusic @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope I really hope not. We didn‚Äôt do it, but we ARE complicit.
@meowlickss @JeffreeRando @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope They refused to move forward with the deal after the Saudies targetted a funeral. The Trump administration moved forward with it.
@FakeOliviaPope @Donnough1 @martsendo Sis, TELL ME you‚Äôre kidding!
@_PardonMyLovee_ @andrewscott13 @Donnough1 @sadtransqueer @kevin_kubi @Prescribed_Naps @FakeOliviaPope @martsendo Yes ma‚Äôam!!
@Electroflxmusic @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope I think he pointed it out because it was the product of a weapons deal established during the current administration. One that the Obama administration wouldn‚Äôt even agree to. For as much as we say we believe in human rights, our government has done nothing to stop the genocide.
@PLewisTX @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope Trump is horrible. There‚Äôs just no denying that. HOWEVER, I think the OP was pointing out that Obama, just like those before him, wasn‚Äôt without his share of foul shit, either. The military industrial complex RUNS this country!
@JeffreeRando @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope The OP was still correct, tho. Drone strikes increased under Obama. Killing 90% the wrong people (meaning innocent civilians). Trump has somehow found a way to repeat Obama‚Äôs mistakes, but on a larger scale - including drone strikes.
@JeffreeRando @ego_killer24 @martsendo @FakeOliviaPope I believe it was part of a weapons deal the Trump administration made with the Saudis. One that Obama wouldn‚Äôt even make.

@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump What have you told me that I didn‚Äôt already know??
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump These were the same programs that benefitted whites. If they believed they were equal under the law, why would they not participate? Why would they not expect the same outcome?
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúI have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races.‚Äù - Abraham Lincoln ; There was never an intention by either party for us to be made ‚Äúequal‚Äù
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump NOT to say you didn‚Äôt work hard.Just to say you can work equally as hard today, but it doesn‚Äôt get you as much.Look at the jobs you worked and the average wage that‚Äôs paid today for that same job compared to today‚Äôs tuition.Could you have done it today in the same amount of time?
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump My mom often used to talk about how she was able to buy a house at my age on her wages. With the credit score she had when she bought her house, she‚Äôd be lucky to get a nice apartment these days! I work in real estate. We‚Äôve done the math. You lucked up, my friend.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump If you‚Äôve been married for 40 years, you are MUCH older than me and were lucky enough to attend college when one could do so! Look at how much the cost of an education as risen compared to wages.
What I‚Äôve learned watching #CNN #TheEighties Sam Donaldson was a Vulcan. That is all.

@SaysSammie @Quackiekitty @thegoodteatime @Andy @BethanyMota https://t.co/Lex1H5h1OT
@SaysSammie @thegoodteatime @Andy She has EVERY right to discuss how it affects her. It‚Äôs NOT making it all about her, it‚Äôs sharing her life, her story. If she never mentioned it, she‚Äôd be deemed as heartless. Just let her live.
@Rebel_Scum483 @Bethenny You people are really freaking cruel! She is NOT the first person to date someone who is separated, and won‚Äôt be the last. It would NOT be ‚Äútrashy‚Äù for her to attend the funeral of someone she was close to. Just stop.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump And for the record, I don‚Äôt support establishment Dems or Republicans. Which means I hate the Clintons as much as I hate Trump. I have a close family friend from Haiti. I KNOW what they did.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Check out the documentary, ‚ÄúGet Me Roger Stone‚Äù and the emotions of poor white people he helped Trump play off of. THEN get back to me.

@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump I know you thought you were schooling me. And hell, I almost appreciate it. Maybe you thought I WAS that ignorant. But I‚Äôm not. And it seems you have far more to learn that you may even realize.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump As though we‚Äôre not intelligent enough to understand that we pay taxes and what we want our tax dollars used for.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Look at the percentage of black people who male up the Republican party. Look at the dog whistle language used by many Republicans. Look at how in the past few decades black women have been relegated to ‚Äúwelfare queens‚Äù and black people to ‚Äúpeople who want free stuff‚Äù.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump I had to pay for my first semester at community college. My mother bought my books for the first and last time that semester with the remnants of insurance money from my grandmother‚Äôs death. NOTHING was handed to me for being black!
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump When I graduated from high school, the combined income of my mother an I was too much to qualify for assistance. And my mother was a single mother customer service rep with a child in middle school. I took a job the previous summer as a delivery dispatcher. We were NOT rich folks
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Hell, it‚Äôs even been proven that white women enjoy the benefits of Affirmative Action more than any other group. And, FTR, as a black woman veteran who pays about $800/month to cover the costs of my previous studies, I‚Äôm OFFENDED when people say how we have it so easy.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump However, it would be disengenuous to pretend that white supremacists who would have, in the past, been Democrats are now overwhelmingly Republican. Social welfare programs are often used as the lure, even though whites overwhelmingly represent those who benefit from said programs
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not speaking on the origins or past misdeeds of the Democratic party. I feel it‚Äôs something that ALL voters should learn and understand. I am an avid supporter of a black woman who calls herself not a Republican, but a member of the Party of Lincoln.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Social welfare programs which helped advance the lives of many white people had a disproportionately negative effect, or non-effect, on black families due to Jim Crow era laws which, for many years, blocked black people from enjoying the benefits of said programs.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Under the leadership pf Nixon and Goldwater, which encouraged the Republican party to appeal to the racism of southern whites through the ‚ÄúSouthern Strategy‚Äù, many whites left the Democratic party for the Republican party.
@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Yes, at one time in history, blacks were overwhelmingly Republicans. However, the policies of presidents like FDR and the actions of presidents like Kennedy changed that.

Even without doing research, which I‚Äôve done, we can plainly see who supports whom.

@rn_gal @MahiMahi96781 @Tim70332636 @MtnMD @realDonaldTrump At this point, people like you either sound woefully ignorant or unscrupulously disengenuous.  You know there has been a major party switch since then.
@realDonaldTrump And, for the record, calling her a ‚Äúcrazed, crying lowlife‚Äù whom you ‚Äúgave a break‚Äù by hiring her for a position making six figures of taxpayer dollars does NOT make you look like the bigger person here.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, boo freaking hoo! You BOTH were who you were when you hired her! She knew you were a racist misogynist, and you knew she was unscrupulous. It seems to be a trait you favored when hiring your staff. You both sound like immature scorned lovers. It‚Äôs sad.
@hausmuva Hell, most of us LOVED Scandal (me included) and she behaved the same way when in the public eye on the show. She was a Republican black chic who cheated to get a Republican white man elected &amp; had an affair with him. Yet, we loved her.
@hausmuva She was smug, arrogant, and unscrupulous, BUT, most successful business people are. She just chose not to hide it and accepted herself for who she was. She deserved to be cancelled for the Trump worship, but why did we hate her before that?
@hausmuva She had been cancelled by most of us prior to her stanning for Trump. And while I still can‚Äôt forget her damn near worship of that man during the campaign and after, I‚Äôm now wondering why she was initially cancelled. ü§î

@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders And for the record, what good is freedom of speech if you're going to be demonized for exercising it by peacefully protesting? What they did is the SUBSTANCE of he very freedom I fought to protect and defend. It's what makes thhis nation great. I'm proud of him.

Or the fact that Republicans and Democrats pretty much switched sides when the parties took on these ideologies? Or did you think the Democrats of yesteryear are still the same today? You're old enough to know better.
@ModiFiedIndia_ @Earleneleonar13 @realDonaldTrump @earleneleonar13 Why? I would really like to know. And PLEASE don't regurgitate memes for me. But as a wife of a former DoD IG, why is Trump the BEST president EVER to you?
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Forgive my typos, please.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Umderstand that Scandanavian countries have been doing this successfully. It makes us look bad. Freedome of speech and the press is already on the line. That's not OK. We want athletes to stand for the pledge but what does it even represent anymore? We MUST do better!!
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders You shouldn't be OK with the fact that healthcare is the #1 cause of debt. Or that college education is right behind it. All to live the American dream. I didn't get it for free but that's why I fight for those after me. I want my country to represent that.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I don't doubt at all that you love your country. But understand your countey is nothing if we fail to care for our citizens. If you love your country, you should WANT free healthcare and college education.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders And because I know what I know, I know we can be better. I also know that many politicians are bought and Trump failed us with his promises to drain the swamp. He hired the swamp onto his administration. I didn't vote for HRC because I felt she would have done the same.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I believe in capitalism on paper. As a woman who has done contracts for the DoD, as well as commercially, I see that capitalism can soon turn to a monopoly with the right amount of greed. And that leaves far too many of my fellow citizens behind for me to be comfortable with.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Maybe I'm being sensitive when you tey to attach my desires to lesser countries. My point is this. I ALSO LOVE my country. If I didn't, I wouldn't have served. But "love" means pointing out when we're getting it wrong.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Imagine a world where the US is still the good guy. We were still the head of negotiations. AND we provided healthcare and college education for our citizens so we could still be the best and brightest into the future. THAT is what I want and what I fought for.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders You, however, seem to be attached to a mindset. And not open to anything else, even in the face of facts. That is unfortunate, but not my struggle to fight. That, madam, is entirely up to you.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders The bottom line is I want what's best for my fellow https://t.co/FCDDUIqBAY's why I volunteered to fight to begin with.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I hold fast to NO political stance. I am a progressive. If we tried progrossibe policies and they don't work, I'm open to libertarianism.If that doesn't work, then anarchy...
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I am not trying to argue with you frivolously. I'm trying to get you to see another point of view. I have agreed that we should have a strong military. That has been your only point. But you refuse to listen to my FACTS that say we can have that AND other things for Americans.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders *contracting
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I was brought on as someone who could teach a certain military branch how to conduct conteacting after they overspent over a billion dollars fpr somethong they'll never be able to use! I KNOW what I'm talking about! Madam.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Do you know how it works? Everyone tries to spend all the money allocated so they don't lose funds. I've seen squadrons ise the money on flat screen TVs no one will see, bars on the flightline, and ill fated projects, etc. It really is a travesty.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Sweetheart, the AF1 is the LEAST of our concerns as it pertains to spending. This year's single increase in military funds would have funded funded the free college for our graduates, and then some. We can better spend this money.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Understand that I handled appropriated funds DIRECTLY. As an airman as well as a citizen. I know what I'm talking about.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders We are conditioned to be afraid when we are the force that the world is afraid of. The US spends more on our military tham the next ten countries COMBINED! I think we can affors to reroute some of those funds. ESPECIALLY based on what I've seen us soend money on.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Exactly WHAT should I stop?
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders But he didn't. And we still haven't. We ignore all the atrocities while aending troops to further our imperialistic hold. You should ask "why" instead of insulting me because I believe those tax dollars could be better used serving Americans with healthcare and college ed.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I KNOW what I fought for. I KNOW what my family and friends and comrades have fought for. Don't insult me with your ignorant anecdotes and opinions.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I don't believe in putting American lives on the line for reasons that will NEVER benefit Americans. I view things thru a different lense as a vet with the job I had. But you cant say I dont want a strong military because I want strengths at home, as well.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders You are trying to twist my words. I have already stated to you that I believe in a strong military. Again, I'm a vet. I have military family and friends. I want them protected. Bit that doesn't have to mean excessive spending by the DoD which only makes SOME rich.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Obama deported more illegal immigrants than all presidents before him - combined. But I STILL feel it should be done in a humane way, which he did. Our current president uses loopholes and calls them laws and blames it on democrats. that is not strength.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I mean, sheesh, Obama reduced the number of homeless vets by 30% during his presidency! He implemented programs that made it easier for us vets to start businesses. But he also increased the number of military conflicts. That is problematic, as we citizens have aeen no benefit.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Once again, madam, the issue far more nuanced than you are making it out to be. We can still have the strongest military in the world and take care of our citizens right here at home!
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders As a DoD contract administrator, I have seen how funds are spent. It's a travesty. If most people knew, they would revolt! I served in the military! I come from a long line of veterans. I believe in a strong military. But I don't believe in excess.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders When have I EVER said I don't believe in a strong military?! I haven't! What I DON'T believe in is imperialism or feeding the military industrial complex with funds that could be used to make this country better for its citizens.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Yet we commit crimes in the name of "protecting" ourselves and our allies from people who are far less mighty than we are. Look at all the lives that have been lost in these wars since 9/11! How can you "support" the troops while supporting using them as pawns?! Stop it.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Saudi Arabia and Israel are committing horrible crimes against humanity. You call yourself a Christian, a follower of Jesus. There is NO WAY Jesus could be the man we have all learned that he was and support what the IS is doing. We are the world's last Superpower...
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders For the record, "peace thru strength" is a bully slogan. Sounds a lot like 1984's "War is peace/freedom is slavery/ignorance is strength" Look at the fact that many of the countries we have issues with since 9/11 were already on a list to be toppled prior to 9/11.
@trueblackpower "Better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war."
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Good for your husband. However, unless you're absorbing his knowledge via osmosis, it's irrelevant. I said I am a veteran who administered government contracts as a job. I then worked for DoD after being discharged. And you respond by saying your husband knows a few things...OK?
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders No other country has a military that spends as much as ours and is in as many other countries as ours, so yes, it's expected that someof our citizens will have some complaints. And righfully so. Look at defense spending, ESPECIALLY after 9/11! It's become outrageous!
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders People who may disagree with you on this issue are not "witching". The fact that you'd call it that shows that you are coming from a closed minded perspective. That's unfortunate, as the issue is quite nuanced and there are good points to be made on both sides.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders HOWEVER, there is also an enormous amount of money wasted in the name of "defense". I know we could maintain a strong military AND better use those tax dollars on programs that would benefit all Americans. It doesn't have to be either/or.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders If we're going to engage in dialogue, do not put words in my mouth and profess to know what I "like". It comes off as ignorant and profoundly obtuse. Furthermore, I have no issue with having a strong military. And we have the strongest in the world ...
@CNN This job is breaking her.
@denacamp1 @RobertDuchene7 @freedom_moates Well, it's the people who make up the parties. Ever hear of the Southern Strategy? The partirs essentially switched because people on both sides switched parties. What Robert said is true. Posts like this ARE disengenuous.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders Why should he go to Cuba? He's the most popular American politician currently and he wants to improve the lives of fellow Americans. He's exactly where he needs to be doing exactly what he should do. You have a good night.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders What is so wrong with using our tax dollars to ensure every person receives healthcare and college education? The best healthcare system in the world is in Switzerland (universal healthcare). These are things that would benefit all of us. Not just the military industrial complex.
@Earleneleonar13 @SenSanders I'm a vet. You don't need to try to school me on our military. I administered DoD contracts. I know FIRSTHAND that we could be using the bulk of that money on other programs rather than empirialism.

They will do EVERYTHING they can to make GZ the "victim" even though he has proben himself to be an aggressive asshole. Shit, they blame THAT on PTSD. When people are hellbent on defending a murderer, you have to stop.

@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 other than the fact that he called the cops while chasing him down.
i think they should hve someone on the piano playing "America" during the flag anthem. #NFL
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 He has done that and more. Did you ever think that people like you are being used to take away from the actual cause to make it about something it is not?
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 A wise man told me "don't argue with fools", because people from a distonce can't tell who is who. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. SOMEONE WHO DEFENDS MURDER IS NOT WORTH ARGUING WITH. THEY WILL NEVER RELENT. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A REASON.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 The fact that it even happened is shameful.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Tso black &amp; white friends chose to ignore. On their way home, they had to stop for gas in this town. It was during the end of a KLAN meeting. My black friend reclined his seat as my white friend pumped the gas. They were terrified.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Yes, I was in Florida's panhandle.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Maybe he made his way back to the RT because he knew how to get home from there since he didn't actually live in they development. I did the same when I moved to the burbs. I was used to city blocks, NOT suburban layouts.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Shit, Trump says he's a billionaire. Far more money than the average athlete. What has he done as president to absolve all of these issues? Nothing stopping him from using his money to do so.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Are none ofnthem doing anything?
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 DO they all own 8 cars?
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 And what does that have to do with their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS? MANY celebrities make millions and do nothing. SHOULD THEY NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO EXERCISE 1ST AMD RIGHTS, EITHER?
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 So, in your opinion, GZ did NOTHING wrong. Ever.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Come back to where? He had already begun following Trayvon so wherever Trayvon or GZ was when he started running was NOT where Trayvon "returned" to. Maybe he was just walking around the neighborhood after he thought he shook GZ. That happens, too.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 FOLLOWING
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 I'm a member of an actual neighborhood watch. When I saw someone peering into my neighbor's car, I called the police, gave a description, and notified my neighbor the next day. THAT'S what neighborhood watch does. NOT hunt down people.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 How afraid could he have been to not even follow in a car, but rather on foot.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Not sure if you have a child, but if someone stated they weren't following her, but going in the same direction to see where she was going, I THINK YOU'D FEEL DIFFERENTLY.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 He did follow him. He said he was "going in the same direction as him so I could see where he was going." That is following.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 His neighbors stated that he was not a part of any recognized neighborhood watch. That has been established. I'm projecting nothing.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 When I tried to explain things to get this cop luntic to calm down, he brandished his wepon at me &amp; told me to shut the fuck up. I called the police. Nothing was done.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 There was no report of a break in because there was none.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Look at how police deal with us. I had an off duty drunk ass cop brandish his weapon while accusing my delivery driver of breaking into a car on my street. Just so happened my driver was lost so I was outside to see him turn on my street. I also saw my neighbor enter her own car
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 You mean to tell me if GZ had seen a white girl walking in his development, he would have acted the same way?
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Yet you excuse a man who did. If YOUR child was walking home from the store to a family member's house &amp; being followed &amp; felt threatened, would you tell him to wait until he was attacked? Or to stand his ground?
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 My apartment was broken into twice by the maintenance men. It clearly affected my PTSD and ability to feel safe. Never ONCE did I attack maintenance men or men in general. PTSD is NO EXCUSE for his bullshit.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 I have PTSD. I know many who do. Don't use it to excuse his BS. It's a fucking insult.
@mindweapon @Bearkat38 @JaimePretellEsq @johnpike15 @timjacobwise @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner So, the plumbers, the water bureau, electricians, and the department of energy. got it. I know people who work in all capacities. my taxes &amp; tips pay them well. I also thank them often. I'll be happy to let them know they are "SUPERIOR MEN".
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 It's tragedy for Trayvon. GZ is proud of what he did.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Sometimes I walk my dog at night. If I felt I was being followed by a man &amp; called the cops, only to see him run, I'd be headed for the safety of my home. I wouldn't kill him.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 He WASN'T neighborhood watch. he was an armed man following a teenager who was doing nothing wrong. You truly sympathize for a murderer. I see why I muted you.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 He came home terrified! He was still just a kid regardless of size. I guess that gives him an excuse to act out. because it certainly wasn't the 1st time it happened.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 When he's really just a kid. While down the shore, a group of white college kids followed him home and harassed him because they didn't know black people rented out shore homes on that block. He was simply talking on the phone to his girlfriend &amp; wanted to FT from the beach.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 so being "maligned" is an excuse to display the behavior he has? An excuse for making threats &amp; using a pic of Trayvon's dead body to support those threats? REALLY? I have. 6'1" 15 y/o nephew. I have seen him be accused &amp; suspected of all types of BS due to his size.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Overrepresented how? And why? I've seen people try to educate you for days.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 It seems you defend the most abhorrent of behaviors based on prejudices. You have done the mental work to humanize GZ more than you have Trayvon. And its evident.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 A person who is NOT murderous who has had to kill to defend one's self just doesn't do things like that. But even after I ended our dialogue, I see you still here defending a murderer.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Over the past few days, due to the fact that you and I debated about GZ, I have seen you continue to defend him murdering Trayvon. Even though GZ has since done things like make blanket threats on social media using the pic of dead Trayvon.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 But you interjected yourself into a conversation in which I was calling out said behavior to someone who condoned it. It's like you look for a reason to cape for bullshit.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 THAT was never my point &amp; while I'm not condoning that behavior,have you ever heard of the term"The hate that hate created"? Black people have no real systemic power. The system is still controlled mostly by white men who determine the laws we must abide by &amp; the repercussions.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 They did. The NFL imposed fines. HOWEVER, the president calling off an event to celebrate the winnig Superbowl team, even if only TWO planned to attend, is shameful. His supporting reasons borderline on government crackdown of free speech. Shameful
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 ..."Go home, nigger!!"  I said what I said because the woman I responded to was claiming that taking a knee is disrespectful to black troops. I feel that being told I have to avoid ANY part of the country I have taken an oath to defend is what is ACTUALLY disrespectful.
@JaimePretellEsq @LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 Were you serving in the military at the time? I mean, there are towns near where I grew up that we were told as people of color to never enter. I went to a mostly white Catholic school and had white adults drive past me throwing trash out the window yelling...
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 But we were told to understand that we are fighting for their right to exist. That is what makes this country "great". This wasn't the 40's or 60's. I joined in 2002! And it's STILL that way today.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 The KKK was active in a town right outside of my military base. I was actually ordered to NEVER enter that town. Imagine serving the country but being ordered to avoid certain parts because people there have been known to practice violence against people of color.
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 What is shameful is demonizing these athletes for practicing their Constitutional rights because you don't like when or how they choose to do so. 2/
@LRashidioun @JasonHardung @TalibKweli @knowingispowr @JaimePretellEsq @BlunderBusket @seriouspersona @PommyGooner @Bearkat38 I'm a vet. I served my country as the first woman in a long line of vets.

@Robotoid_Roy @the1res You don't quote what you infer. ESPECIALLY as it pertains to essentially calling someone a sexual predator. Furthermore, he was explaining why he thought there was something between them that wasn't. They had traveled together unrelated to tours, as well.
@VicenteCasulli_ @Mary_Behaves @TalibKweli @the1res @Indiegogo You believe what??
@CauseAndCulture @the1res He said they traveled often together on tours as well as travel unrelated to tours. This incident was before she was signed to his label. It all just sounds super messy.
@Robotoid_Roy @the1res where did you read that he felt he was owed a kiss??
@realDonaldTrump Right! I see why you love the poorly educated!
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke It actually shows that she's been wanting to use this incident to manipulate something out of him for some time since her first threat to expose him (that we know of) was four years ago.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke Smoking gun? All that email proved was that he hit on her once (which he admitted to) &amp; she seemingly tried to use the sitution to expose him to his wife. She never showed what was said in the prior email.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke And before you call me sexist, understand that there have been A. MANY women who were willing to trade sexual favors for status just like many men with power have withheld status for sexual favors. It's the world we live in. B. I NEVER said she did.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke For the record, I NEVER mentioned BJs! I've seen no mention of BJs aside from YOUR tweets. Where's THAT come from??!
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke Just as she has accused him of lying but NEVER said what he lied about. So I ask, why PROOF do you have that I haven't seen?
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke Her response to him mentioned lies he believed, but never indicated what was a lie.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke I ALSO said based on info he was priveyed to (according to him, I can't confirm or deny) she has had sexual relationships with men for room and board. He stated that in the email to her which SHE provided.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke Then we ended up in a hot tub together, I would understand his confusion &amp; reject any unwanted passes. HOWEVER, it's worth noting that AT THAT TIME, he wasn't her boss. She wasn't signed or working for him.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke #2 Never did I EVER say ANYONE, established singer or otherwise, was a sex worker. What I SAID was if I knew as an employee that I wasn't producing any work &amp; my boss who stated that he was attracted to me was taking me on trips where I wasn't working...
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke #1 When ws he accused of sexully harassing another woman? I'm asking seriously. I've NEVER heard of this.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke You seem young. And hopefully have a lot more life to live. I would go easy on being so readily willing to basically call someone a sexual predator in a situation with more holes than swiss cheese and a timeline and receipts that seem to prove otherwise. #WatchYourKarma
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke And if I AM in a hot tub with him, and he tries to kiss me, I would understand his confusion, decline if uninterested, and try to avoid those types of intimate situations in the future. He said it happened ONCE and she didn't deny that.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke I don't know about YOUR job, but if I have one and I'm not doing it, but my boss takes me on trips (even though I'm not productive), verbalizes his interest in me (which she said he did), I'm NOT gonna be in a hot tub with him!
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke She LITERALLY just called him broke and made fun of the fact that he only owns one home and is renting a place where he currently stays with a roommate. How that translates to being "rich" and able to afford the best lawyers is beyond me.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke He didn't seem mad that she didn't get any work done, but rather that she was threatening to "expose" him (seemingly to his wife) for a situation in which he felt he'd done nothing wrong.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke He mentioned that there were other trips during which she didn't work that he took her on. He said he tried to kiss her once and she said no. She didn't deny ANY of that.
@P3rs0naN0nGrata @TalibKweli @TypeLexi @the1res @Alb3woke Actually, I think you interpreted that incorrectly. He stated that she has a track record of trading sex for room and board. Since she hadn't produced any work during or prior to this trip, he mistook it as one of those situations which made him feel he had the green light.
@the1res Sis, are you saying that after you turned him down in PR, he continued to hit on you? Because I'm not understanding why you would sign with him after that if that was the case. These are MAJOR implications.
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) And c. as it pertains to the music, she's saying things like she wants to handle it outside of court and asking that you drop the case, but then when she's fired up about her claims, she's gung ho to go to court. It's mad suspect. /fin
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) This is problematic because a. NONE of this is "sexual harassment". b. there are women lining up supporting her and demeaning your character and it's not cool use people's sympathy/empathy to try force someone else to do something. 8/
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) This is what I've gathered from what you said and the document you produced as well as the email she showed. She hasn't denied ANY of this, but has called you a liar without stating what you're supposedly lying about. 7/
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) NOW, it's NOT just that you, at one time, were hitting on her. But what you did with OTHER WOMEN (who were consentually involved in these situations) made her uncomfortable. 6/
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) You tried to work with her for ancut since your verse was used. She relented. You sued. Then she claimed you sexually harassed her and since she spurned your advances, she's claiming you refused to release her music. 5/ (I think lol)
@TalibKweli ...(ctd) She had a crowdfunding campaign to indepentlybfinance a project. But as an incentive to donate, she released music with you on it which she didn't have the rights to. 4/
@TalibKweli Necause it sounds like there was some innocent flirting. you shot your shot. she wasn't with it. You apologized. Your shots stopped. Later on she signed with you. You spent $ on her project. Nothing came of it. She was dropped. 3/
@TalibKweli ...(ctd.) So when did she actually sign with you? 2/
@TalibKweli I have a couple ?s. As a female fan who HAS been sexually harassed, there are just some things that aren't adding up for me. #1 Did she ever tour on your tourbus with you prior to signing with you? #2 I understand the PR thing happened BEFORE she was signed...1/

A black kid walking home is viewed as "out of place behavior" and fucking bigots like you find that acceptable. THAT is being murdered for fucking EXISTING. PERIOD.
@JaimePretellEsq @knowingispowr @TalibKweli @temorolls_kind @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 His neighbors reported that he was a self appointed "neighborhood watchman". He was NOT a member of any officially recognized neighborhood watch organization. So FOH with that, too. You are LITERALLY making excuses for a murderer.
@knowingispowr @TalibKweli @temorolls_kind @JaimePretellEsq @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 He was in his father's neighborhood. Casing houses?! WTF?! We know he walked to the store and was walking back home. He had a right to be in that neighborhood. No history of breaking and entering. CASING HOUSES?!! FOH
@knowingispowr @TalibKweli @temorolls_kind @JaimePretellEsq @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 To even talk this "guilty" shit, having all the facts we now know, shows that you really are a POS. You're still coming up with excuses for what we now know was inexcusable. It was murder.
@knowingispowr @TalibKweli @temorolls_kind @JaimePretellEsq @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 He wasn't a cop. He was a fucking stranger. Guilty people stalk and follow people, too.
@knowingispowr @TalibKweli @temorolls_kind @JaimePretellEsq @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 He fucking ran. He may have been taller but Zimmerman was heavier. He was a fucking minor breaking no law. HE RAN. WTF is WRONG with you people?!
@TalibKweli @knowingispowr @temorolls_kind @JaimePretellEsq @orangejuls1975 @bleeker185 @blk_slv_master @GrimmzTesla @DavidPiercy18 Whenever I read this, I check the fact that he ran. He was obviously aware he was being followed and afraid. He didn't have anything illegal on him. He was entitled to be exactly where he was. He was breaking no law. And he ran from a grown ass man and ended up dead. SMFH
I was caping for her, too. My bad. I guess she just KNEW how "little niggers" should be treated versus her. Surprise, surprise, b*tch. I bet she was on that "All Lives Matter/Blue Lives Matter" tip, too. Well, chickens do come home to roost. Might as well welcome them! https://t.co/BOx1tiJ6oN
@Darrenevans1983 @Fear_the_Dome87 @marcelle_is_fat @ctwan @aclink33 @GMA @GioBenitez Oh! üò≥ Well, there you have it. May not be "one of these little niggers", but you got treated like one that day, boo. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Makes it hard to feel bad.
@DKinchenFOX29 @FOX29philly Were they attempting to arrest her for that or for not giving her last name? I'm a bit confused about THAT part. As for the punching her in her face, that was clearly out of anger. There's no excuse for either of them.
@DKinchenFOX29 @FOX29philly OK, I'm from Jersey so I've been down the shore like a million times in my life. I've seen people drinking wine, hard liquor AND smoking weed. Honestly, every time we go we smell weed smoke. I understand that she was drinking underage, but is that normally cause for an arrest?
@Fear_the_Dome87 @marcelle_is_fat @ctwan @aclink33 @GMA @GioBenitez I know I'm asking for a lot, but can you please tell me what moment she said that on the recording. I have listened to it several times and I don't hear it.
And even if you're depressed, and today was a "don't want to get out of bed" type day, it's OK. You are deserving of love and admiration simply by virtue of your mere existence. I sincerely hope you know that. üòò
So for the sisters working 9-5s (OR 3-11s or 11-7s), or are unemployed looking for work, or are just confused about what the next step should be, know that there's power in your perseverence. 3/
Many of us aren't doing things deemed to be "magic" in our day-to-day lives. And social media movements meant to celebrate our sisters doing amazing things (which is much deserved) can sometimes leave you feeling a bit "less than". 2/
I really LOVE the #BlackGirlMagic thing. But sometimes, I just feel less than "magical" and more like #BlackGirlAverage or #BlackGirlMediocreAF 1/
@KyleKulinski I doubt it. I believe he said she has a fat ass, but overall bad body. I don't really think she's his type. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@Rocky_Soundtrk @LaurieBrownstei @jeremyscahill Only, because we don't have her level of celebrity, our voices aren't heard.

If he was truly concerned, I believe that would be an admirable and effective 1st step. 2/
@Rocky_Soundtrk @LaurieBrownstei @jeremyscahill And THEREIN lies the issue. She didn't go to discuss broad, systemic issues with the prison industrial complex, but rather to discuss one person. And that's fine, but you can't expect her to be heralded as some advocate by the masses when so many folks do the same. 1/

@Yeshuaschildren @the_USO People are now more privy to how corrupt the military industrial complex is. It does nothing positive for us as vets and military members. Understandable, but not necessarily fair, as a standing military is necessary.
@Yeshuaschildren @the_USO I disagree. Many blame us for the corrupt reasons we are sent to war, rather than understanding that we volunteer to protect and defend (which is needed) and don‚Äôt profit from the corruption. As an Iraq war vet, I was told not to even wear my uniform in public!
@llp611 @tyler_MBA @the_USO That is true. But a military is necessary. Don‚Äôt blame the issues on those who volunteer to protect and defend. Place the blame where it‚Äôs due. On the corrupt companies and politicians.
@llp611 @the_USO My First Shirt was made to retire in his sixties. We lost a wealth of wisdom and fatherly love when that happened. Thank you for your service.
@BelleAvocat @karl_kamp @the_USO We may not do it for the recognition, but it IS deserved. We put our lives on the line to protect and defend the country. And we‚Äôre paid very little to do so. Not nearly what the job deserves.
@clintonkoenig @BelleAvocat @karl_kamp @the_USO As a vet, believe me, the support ALWAYS counts.
@DarrahHarold @the_USO I‚Äôm sorry you had to endure that. As a vet of the Iraq war, I remember being told it was dangerous to wear my uniform in public. We sometimes bear the burden of the ugly reasons we are sent to war. Misplaced blame. We volunteer to protect and defend the US. Not fight BS wars.
@DebraSueHartma1 @DarrahHarold @the_USO It wasn‚Äôt really fake news. It‚Äôs just that our military members are used as pawns in wars they have no say so over. As a vet, in a long line of vets, I will always support our troops. But the REASONS we send them to war need to be worthy of the lives willingly put on the line.

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends What about the woman who was physically assaulted at one of your rallies?? Why did you never speak out in support of her?! Oh no, you offered to pay the assaulters' legal fees. You're disgusting.
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty It is what it is. But I blame myself. I just didn't know to push harder when she said I was OK. I went to my doctor, told her my concerns, but didn't educate myself as to what to do AFTER that. I stayed stuck there for years. And now, here we are. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 I see that now. She's oberworked and underpaid and this is what hapoens when THAT happens. Women like me who are in overall good health slip theough the cracks. I was put on a low FODMAP diet when what I REALLY needed was attention to my uterus.
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 I agree. But I can't afford insurance so I go to the VA. She's my PCP as well as my Gyno. She is the PCP for tons of vets and the Gyno for us local female vets. It's not even like she can focus on her specialty. She would look at my health OVERALL and compatmentalize my uterus 2/
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 THAT's what got her to send me for the ultrasound and begin taking things seriously. That's how large my biggest fibroid is. My freaking stomach is on top of it! 5/
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 I told her fibroids run in my family. My aunt died from an aggressive form of cervical cancer at 45 in 2016. She didn't pay much attention to it until we felt this huge mass on the left side of my abdomen which my stomach is resting on. 4/
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 I could wake up to put on a fresh ten hour pad at 4am, THEN by 7-8am when I'd ise the bathroom for the first time in the morning, I'd have to run to the bathroom so I didn't track blood. Blood would be all over the toilet and a puddle on the floor. 3/
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 I would bleed through a ten hour pad in 3-4 hours. Periods started lasting 7-10 days. Cramps were hellish. Energy levels were in the basement. And she ignored it all because my paps were normal and blood tests were normal - other than my extremely low iton levels. 2/
@Melinatedbeauty @nightnurse38 My paps have never been abnormal, which is why, for years, she's said there's no problem. After the ultrasound showed them, NOW she's in urgent mode! I *think* she feels bad for ignoring them for years when I told her I felt them! 1/
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty It sucks because I want children but these things are huge now and I really just want them out. I can't sleep on my stomach. And even when I lay on my sides, I can feel them.
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty I should have trusted myself more. I began taking multiple herbs to handle what I thought was inflammation.  I felt great, but my belly kept protruding more and more, my periods got heavier, cramps got worse, low iron reached anemic levels.
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty My uterus is now 4" x 9" x 9"!! INCHES!! It's above my belly button and pushes my organs out which is why I look pregnant. I'm super pissed that she didn't catch them when I told her years ago. But it's taught me to be more proactive with my doctors, if nothing else. 3/
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty After putting me on several different diets to no avail, as they were continuously growing, I visited her because there was a mass in my left abdomen. She sent me for an uktrasound and the 1st words out of the radiologist's mouth were, "Your uterus is HUGE!!" 2/
@nightnurse38 @Melinatedbeauty I suspected YEARS ago that I had them. But my doctor said everything was fine. I even thought I felt one, but she said it was just my muscle wall. Fast forward two years later and I look like I'm pregnant. I thought I had intestinal inflammation issues. 1/

I'm 100% convinced this has more to do with his relationship with Jay Z than we even know. Jay was embraced by Obama while Ye was seemingly shunned.

@crddavis14 @kanyewest In more ways than one.
@kanyewest It's problematic to me that he gained so many "fans" by demonizing black people. Making false and disengenuous comments. These people don't love him. They love what he currently stands for.
@kanyewest You have left those of us who supported you for saying that. And it hurts. Free thought is one thing. Ignorance is something totally different.
@kanyewest Growth and evolution are natural. But that's not what this is. You seem REALLY FAR REMOVED from reality. It's scary and your comments were hurtful. You have solidified the opinions of the ignorant who hated you when you said "Bush doesn't care about black people"

@RealiTeaRead @Kimzolciak You are welcome to have your interpretation. But you can't really fault people for taking what she said at face value. Like "being attacked by 5 Aftican American women!" Someone ALWAYS gets attacked at the reunion. It's the nature of the show.

@MetroGranny @shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado You know, when I went to basic training I met white women who had NEVER been around black people. I understood their ignorance. Kim is an intelligent woman who has been around black people forever, and in the south at that. I'm just not buying it. But hey, agree to disagree.
@jboslicious @ms_behold @YVee1223 @JasenKaplan @MrWright4UIKNO @Andy @KenyaMoore @Kimzolciak Then it was the nonsense with the trip to Africa. It was then that she started acting like she was just so above the other women.
@jboslicious @ms_behold @YVee1223 @JasenKaplan @MrWright4UIKNO @Andy @KenyaMoore @Kimzolciak The rumors of Kim being lowkey racist didn't start until she went to see Kandi's new home and claimed she was so "afraid" to get off the highway at that exit because it was in a "bad neighborhood". Even though it's a huge home in the same neighborhood as the mayor. ü§îüòí
@IamSheree @Kimzolciak @NeNeLeakes Now that she's being dragged for her comments, and digging the hole deeper by insinuating that it's because she's the only white woman on the cast (which she had always been), she's blaming the big bad black women. It's disgusting, just as your unwillingness to call it out is.
@IamSheree You blatantly ignored the racist undertone in the things @Kimzolciak said simply because you don't like @NeNeLeakes. That was such an unprincipled stance because it's bigger than that. Kim was a fan fave to a majority black audience for YEARS. 1/
@lafmtiffkita @Andy @RadioAndySXM ESPECIALLY when she was a fan fave to a predominantly black audience for YEARS. She REFUSES to take accountability for ANYTHING!
@Andy @RadioAndySXM Can you PLEASE address @Kimzolciak playing victim because she's white when the women attack on EVERY show in this franchise? As well as her comment about no other white woman being willing to be on the show?
@CaraSkyler @shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado @Kimzolciak This has more to do with her comments and behaviors than her being the only white woman on the show.
@CaraSkyler @shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado @Kimzolciak Have you seen the other shows in the franchise? Or even Kim's first few seasons? The women ALWAYS attack. That's the nature of the franchise. And she managed to be a fan fave on a show with a predominantly black audience for years. 1/
@jboslicious @ms_behold @YVee1223 @JasenKaplan @MrWright4UIKNO @Andy @KenyaMoore @Kimzolciak Things MAY happen "on both sides", but that doesn't negate HER behavior and words. To assume that would have happened to ANY white woman placed on the cast is a reach that is more opinion than fact.
@jboslicious @ms_behold @YVee1223 @JasenKaplan @MrWright4UIKNO @Andy @KenyaMoore @Kimzolciak But Kim faced off with black women on the show since season 1 without being accused of being a racist. The viewing audience is mostly black women and she managed to be a fan fave for years. The tone of her comments and her attitude began to change at a certain point.
@BillSwaim2 @StasiaDeEtte @MrErnestOwens @Kimzolciak The white kids I went to school with had the privilege of safely walking to school while I had to deal with adults throwing things at me and calling me a nigger as they told me to get out of their neighborhood. Privilege exists and takes on many forms.
@BillSwaim2 @StasiaDeEtte @MrErnestOwens @Kimzolciak When I served in the military and was stationed in the south, privilege meant being able to go to any neighborhood you wanted while black people like myself were ordered to stay away from certain towns because the KKK was active and it was dangerous. 2/
@BillSwaim2 @StasiaDeEtte @MrErnestOwens @Kimzolciak Well, there have been a multitude studies done that disprove your theory. I feel I'm successful, but that doesn't mean I haven't confronted racism. 1/
@RianHilton @SarahSaysS0 @KeyshiaKaoir @BrielleZolciak @Kimzolciak That is what you're inferring from what she said. Not what she said. When she was single and being kept by a married man, the way she dealt with the other women was different. When she got with Kroy, she began to act a bit "above" them all.
@shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado She doesn't deal with the black women like peers. She's rude and dismissive unless you kiss her ass. Even with the lady on the elephant room episode. Her behavior and tone were totally uncalled for.
@shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado At the end of the day, even the statement regarding "5 African American women" being against her was off considering the fact that the women behave like this on every other RH show. It's NOT JUST the black women.
@shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado There is something off even in how she responds to visiting her black friends' homes. And I SAW the episode of her show when she went to her assistant's home which had NOTHING on the homes of her cast members. NONE of that negativity was there.
@shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado The condescension is unnecessary. Of course you can. But the racist undertone of some of her comments were explained explicitly. She feigned ignorance.
@crissles @Andy According to @biermann71, you seemingly left somehing substantive of the conversation out. Did we miss something?? I doubt it, but I figured I'd ask. Sounds like sour grapes to me. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@ETCanada Smart move. I actually used to be a fan of hers, but she seems to have changed quite a bit over the years. I used to love her old "tell it like it is" attitude. But she lies and backpedals so much now. It's hard to have any respect for her. She refuses to take accountability.
@biermann71 @Andy @True_Ent Well, they couldn't show an entire 45 minute conversation, but Andy DID say it took place. I think they simply showed the gist of it. Was there a point made that was left out? Her comments don't seem to have been taken out of context. She said what she said. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@CheReal85 @Tasham315Tasha @MochaDream @DamienRDelgado THANK YOU!!!!!
@shezsoambitious @DamienRDelgado It didn't become her "going up against" anyone until she started making disparaging statements and not wanting to own them.
@lfuckworking @Kimzolciak Kandi &amp; Nene are both rich with beautiful families. Cynthia and Porsha are both beautiful, successful, and happily dating after their respective divorces. And Kenya seems to be happy with her new husband.  Jealous of what?? ü§îü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@lfuckworking @Kimzolciak I don't know how one gets to be "jealouse FROM" anything, but I DO know none of these women have a reason to be jealous of her.
@Essence The deal is, on EVERY SINGLE RH franchise, there has been a season where one or two women fall under the scrutiny of the other members of the cast. It's not about it being "5 African American" women. SMFH

WHY do I feel Bernie is about to be given more press about straw-man sex worker issues than when he was in the running for president?!
@emo_comey @souzou_no @DirtyAsh92 @AP The police didn't know Starbucks allowed non-customers to sit on their premises. Which is the reason for this apology. They were arrested for NOTHING! You should be MORE upset about THAT as a citizen.
@emo_comey @souzou_no @DirtyAsh92 @AP that was only for paying customers. He complied. Then officers were called. WE DO NOT live in a police state. So when an officer orders you to leave and you are breaking no law, you have a right to say no and ask why.
@emo_comey @souzou_no @DirtyAsh92 @AP Witnesses have gone on record to say they had done nothing wrong and were never asked by any employee to leave. NOTICE that even Starbucks has NEVER said an employee asked them to leave. One of them asked to use the restroom while waiting for a colleague. Was told...
@emo_comey @DirtyAsh92 @AP THEY WERE NOT ASKED TO LEAVE BY ANY EMPLOYEE. THEY ASKED TO USE THE BATHROOM. WERE TOLD IT WAS FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS ONLY. THEY COMPLIED. THEN POLICE WERE CALLED. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HAPPENED.
@h4abworld @CBSNews NO employee asked them to leave. They were told the bathroom was only for paying customers. They adhered to that policy. And continued to PEACEFULLY wait for their colleague. Then the police showed up. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@MissLysiNyc @maggicarter @SenSanders I DO feel that something should be done about trafficking uneilling participants. I used to strip. Which is LEGAL. I don't see what he did wrong here. 2/2
@MissLysiNyc @maggicarter @SenSanders But Bernie DOES work to address many of those issues. The trafficking of sex workers who are unwilling participants is not the same as women/men CHOOSING to work in that field. I AGREE that sex work should be legalized. But... 1/2
@TMZ Makes sense. I heard their products were really cheap and flimsy. I doubt they even carried Good American or Yeezy's line in their stores. They are a powerhouse brand. I don't think the stores ever lived up to that.
@quadriderinaz @CNN STILL, her punishment seems harsh. Although, I'd expect that behavior more from a new recruit fresh out of high school than from a grown person who has already served. She should have the maturity and respect of rank to KNOW how improper that was.
@quadriderinaz @CNN I took the oath in 2002. Graduated from trainee to airman in January 2003. I agree with you! Hell, I cried on BOTH occasions. Especially upon graduating from BMT knowing how much I worked to be the first woman in my family to earn the title of "airman".
@thegrapesofbath @CNN This is a serious oath. You're volunteering to out your life on the line for your country. I'm not a stickler for a lot of things, but taking your oath should not be made a mockery of. I do, however, appreciate her volunteering to do what most won't. That alone deserves respect.
@thegrapesofbath @CNN TBH, all I can think of is accessories while on duty and in uniform. Possibly some obscure rule that can be found in Air Force standards. I've been out for 13 years, so forgive my ignorance. IMO, the punishment was FAR too harsh. However, I DO find it embarassing as a vet.
@lxst__sxul @CNN Do you have any evidence of this?! That's INSANE!!!!!
@BoltsandNoles @creepyasterisks @SailorDave164 @SeanFC18 @CNN @FSUmanager Hell, we have to have the highest scores just to GET IN! I don't even flinch at the term "chair force". The most intelligent people have always worked smarter, not harder. However, I don't know WTF they're doing in our reserve branches. This is embarassing! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@Rattwalk @OMAKAROCKS @CNN I do agree that what they pulled was a bit of a mockery, deserving of some form of punishment.
@Rattwalk @OMAKAROCKS @CNN As a vet, I have to disagree that acknowledging that men AND women serve by simply stating "and woman" should be considered as PC.  Hell, I come from a long line of men who served and being the first and only woman to do so is celebrated in my family. Nothing wrong with that.
@OMAKAROCKS @CNN I'm a vet and I've witnessed many parents and grandparents reenlist in front of their children. That's really not an excuse. I appreciate her volunteering, truly I do! But this was just out of order.
@OMAKAROCKS @CNN There are men who are accused of sexual assault in the military who receive NO punishment at all. So I DO believe her punishment was more than a bit harsh. However, there is a certain level of decorum that's expected on any serious occasion. I don't get why she did this.
@AnnoyingTFF @fluffykoalaa @chadders1995 Never even heard about these incidents.
@CNN I know I cried when I took my oath. Cried even more when I graduated from basic training and crossed over from "trainee" to "airman". I've seen women crossing the "burning sands" into sororities take it more seriously. I guess I just want to know what the joke/purpose was.
@CNN A LOT missing here. WHY would she do this? What was the purpose?? I'm confused.

@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Your black nanny is why your best friend happened to be black? Are you serious? I have a black nephew. He's friends with all the kids in his class. That's what WE enforce. And though we're all black over here, we welcome all. Your sentiments make zero sense.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich What are you even talking about?
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich I have no clue what you're talking about. But if Trump is your spiritual vision, I would suggest you pray some more.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich It's 50/50 for me. My Catholic after school program manager was like a second mom to me. And my friends in the program were like family. The rest of the kids? Well, they were products of their upbringing.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich And there's NEVER a reason for racism.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Those "pockets" are pretty freaking big.
When the fuck do our rights, and the lack thereof and racism meet? Because, by demanding rights, I'm CLEARLY WRONG in this country. So it MUST NOT be in the same place as the rights of whites.
Police tell me to stop breaking a law I'm not breaking - COMPLY.
Policy doesn't dictate that we need to buy something to be in the building...buy something anyway.
It's SOMEHOW ALWAYS OUR FAULT.
Twitter consistently exposes me to people who praise this country for its freedoms while simultaneously telling me black people should give up ours if we don't want to suffer the consequences.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich We are not living in a fascist regime. Saying people should act as though we are takes away freedoms and makes tgis country less great. You should be arguing for their rights. But you are not. I wonder why... ü§î
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich They were actually well within their rights to say no to the police since the employees never asked them to leave. They were breaking no laws. We DO have rights in this country.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Disputes &amp; misunderstandings DO, in fact, happen everyday. But according to all accounts, it didn't become an issue to these men until police showed up.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Or disprove one, for that matter.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich I don't know why people like you act like it's so hard to believe that rampant racism still exists on a level that would/could affect many of us.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich I was born in 1980 and while attending an all white school in the last predominantly whote neighborhood of my town, I had things thrown at me and was called a "nigger" by white adults in that neighborhood. We were afraid to venture into the next town over due to racism...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich We aren't too far out from Jim Crow. As a matter of fact, I'm almost middle aged and my own parents were born when my grandparents couldn't vote. Plenty of horrible things were said about them because they were black while growing up, due to ignorance...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich I mean, look at what you said. You DIDN'T back it up with facts. You merely said you "can't help but to think..." I'm a veteran who comes from a long line of vets. While I'm the only woman, many of the men dealt with racism in the south. While enlisted.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Did you ever, at any time, think that maybe people are just racist/prejudice? And THAT really could be why. Sometimes people are looking for the ONE incident to prove a prejudice.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich People sometimes have their own prejudices. I should have known since I went to an all white Catholic school while being the only one living in the "bad/black" part of town. People have prejudices.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich ...harass my delivery man. I was pissed, but I was a vet with a whole force behind me. In that moment, I felt so bad for my delivery man who had done nothing wrong, ESPECIALLY NOT what he was being accused of. That incident changed my outlook on things.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich ...the car down the street. When I told this drunken off duty cop he was wrong. And that it was actually my neighbor going into their own car. Because I'd witnessed the whole thing. He brandished his weapon at me and told me to shut up. Then continued to...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich ...he shined his headlights onto my lawn to help me find my phone. While doing so, an off duty cop who was a guest of a neighbor pulled up. He was clearly drunk. He jumped out of his car and told my Asian deliver man to freeze, then accused him of breaking into...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Once I got out, while living in MD, my delivery man got lost. I went outside to meet him. Before he showed up, I saw a neighbor down the street enter their car then go back home. While waiting on my delivery man, I dropped my phone. When he showed up...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich As an airman, there were certain places I was ORDERED to not venture into because the KKK was active. So WHILE I was serving my country, there were places I couldn't go IN MY COUNTRY because of incidents with the KKK...
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich What I can tell you is this. I'm a vet and I'm pretty nonconfrontational when it comes to things because I know what it's like to wear a uniform. You just have to do your freaking job to the best of your ability...
@SMFPitt @ProfessorMac @Cernovich You CANNOT be serious. What a disgusting, unfounded, prejudiced comment to make.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich The fact that YOU "can't help" but to think that in many of the cases individuals of color are the perpetrators speaks volumes about YOU and YOUR opinion of people of color.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich I've waited for friends at Starbucks without ordering anything. Why order a product you don't want to avoid a situation you didn't even know was a situation until the police arrived?
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich Notice that in none of the statements released by Starbucks did they say it is their policy to ask individuals to leave if they haven't purchased anything. Nor have they countered the men's statements that no employee asked them to leave.
@ProfessorMac @Cernovich They were waiting to meet a colleague. They were never asked by any employee to leave. When one asked to use the restroom, he was told THAT was for paying customers only. He complied. Witnesses have even stated that they did nothing wrong.
@MustangGirl3 @Cernovich (ctd) Which is why I think Starbucks never said that was their policy in any of the statements they issued.
@MustangGirl3 @Cernovich Employees of Starbucks have spoken out saying they were confused about the situation because people often come in and read the paper or do work without buying anything. They said there's no policy against that...
@MustangGirl3 @Cernovich Actually, people often hang out at Starbucks without purchasing anything. I feel their products are subpar and overpriced, but I've waited to meet friends there before and never have I been asked to leave.
@GodziIIia @MustangGirl3 @Cernovich What makes you think "MOST LIKELY loud"? Witnesses there that day said they had done nothing wrong. They were real estate brokers waiting to meet a colleague. One asked to use the restroom and was told it was only for paying customers. None of the employees asked them to leave.
@BodyAlchemist7 @KevinHart4real @Starbucks A witness stated AT THAT TIME, ON VIDEO, that she had watched the entire event take place and that the young men did nothing wrong. Multiple Starbucks employees have stated that there is no policy against people sitting in a Starbucks without buying anything.

@jack4u2b @pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL SO, WHEN you force a mother to birth a baby she doesn't want to have, or isn't equipped to take care of, WHAT do you THINK happens, GENIUS... https://t.co/QaFwmIRPSX
@jack4u2b @pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL BYE Felicia?! WTF are you talking about?! I PAID FOR MY OWN SITUATION! DEPENDED ON NO ONE! I TOOK IT ALL ON MYSELF EVEN WITHOUT THE FATHER IN EVERY WAY! OR A TAX PAYER!
@jack4u2b @pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL I HAVE PRAYED AND DONE ALL I CAN. I KNOW my child will be waiting for me when I leave this place. And if given God's wisdom, will understand.
@jack4u2b @pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL ARE YOU REALLY? Adoption is REALLY expensive!! LIKE tens of thousands of dollars! FAR MORE than an abortion! Same with housing unwanted children. Are you also fighting for their mental health treatment. Because I CAN TELL YOU, that pot is dwindling!
@pooemogie @jack4u2b @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL BUT when you're dealing with a child with these issues who wasn't wanted, the chances of them being offenders is higher and we end up paying their jail costs. SO, often times, we pay either way.
@jack4u2b @pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL I paid for my own.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL They do! THAT'S WHY ABORTIONS ARE DOWN!! When "pro-life" people oppose funding to Planned Parenthood, that's what suffers! PREEMPTIVE CARE!
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL I've worked to adopt children in my family born to women who should NEVER havVeda children. I'm able to be a great mom NOW. But that wasn't always the case. There should ALWAYS be a choice.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL I was TOTALLY unable to make decisions on my own. Let alone care for a child. I WAS JUST diagnosed with a large fibroid tumor on FFriday. I may never be able to have children now. I HATE my decision, but I'D STILL NEVER take that choice away from other women.

@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL I would LOVE to see more prolife people step up to handle issues like this effectively as much as they criticize women who are prochoice. That would lend MUCH credibility to a movement that seems to be more about dictating what a woman can do with her own body than child welfare.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL Often times, multiple children can be removed from a home and separated which causes issues in and of itself! And there just isn't a lot of help out there for them.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL Minority children, children with health/behavior issues are far less likely to be adopted. ESPECIALLY as they get older!
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL My friend manages group homes. Unfortunately, babies of mothers who abused drugs and/or alcohol during pregnancy have health issues/behavior issues that most people don't want to/or simply can't take on.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL For there to be SO MANY people who are "pro-life", I truly do not understand why there are SO MANY children in the system waiting to be adopted. Pro-life people should be stepping up to the plate before any and everyone else!
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL Well, getting her child adopted and adopting it yourself isn't the same thing, but I'm glad it worked out for your friend. Truly. It was a beautiful thing that she had the support system she did. Unfortunately, that's often not the case.
@pooemogie @RepMaloney @bosslady2898 @NARAL If you knew a pregnant woman who had no desire to be a mother, would you be willing to promise to adopt her child upon birth?

@NicholasASmith Our view of Jesus absolutely is. But our view of God, from what I see, seems to be the same. But as I said, I have so much to learn.
@NicholasASmith I have so much to learn.
@NicholasASmith And so whether I call Him Yeshua or Jesus or God or Jehovah or my cousin calls Him Allah, it's all the same?
@NicholasASmith So it's the Spirit and not the name? NOT saying that like I'm gonna call Him "Harry" or something! lol But you get it!
@NicholasASmith I guess we're depending on the Spirit of the name versus the name itself. Which only makes sense. But why not educate us so as to be as exact as humanly possible?
@NicholasASmith As it pertains to our Lord and savior, why aren't we more exact? The knowledge is there. We know better.
@NicholasASmith There's no real power in my name beyond being able to read an "ethnic" name properly.
@NicholasASmith Listen, I am a baby in this thing. So I would NEVER profess to know more than you do. But I remember having a girl from Poland in my class in 6th grade. My name is Lahkeisha. She and her parents called me "Lukesha". Maybe this is the same type deal. But I'm not Jesus.
@NicholasASmith WHY don't we use Jesus' actual name? Or at least a more correct representation of it. We say at that name every knee shall bow. We talk about the power in that name. But, historically, due to the alphabet and phoenetics, it seems that wasn't His name. WHY do we still use it?

@cathymcmorris Who of you is devoting as much energy to assist the child who is suffering in silence at the hands of a parent/foster parents/adoptive parents/family members/etc?? Or the child forced to be raised by workers at a group home? This issue is nuanced.
@cathymcmorris MANY people are ill equipped to rear children, let alone children with disabilities or behavioral issues.
@cathymcmorris If you're going to take the stance that every woman who is pregnant should be forced to birth a child, you (and the entire pro-life community) should be working much harder to ensure a decent quality of life for each and every one of these children. And that's not the case.
@cathymcmorris He dealt with children as young as four and as old as 17. The levels of abuse and neglect these children have been forced to deal with is HORRIBLE. And later in life, many of them, unfortunately, become predators against others in society due to maladaptive behaviors.
@cathymcmorris My ex-fiance worked in the social services field, first with adults with lifelong disabilities, then for years with children living in group homes. These are children either given up at birth, later in life, or taken from parents and/or adoptive/foster parents.
@cathymcmorris The reaponse to that last statement is normally, "Well, there's always adoption!" But there are already far too many children lost in the system and those with disabilities are less likely to be adopted/fostered.
@cathymcmorris So often people declare a child's right to life without addressing quality of life. Children with disabilities are more likely to be abused than those without. I have seen firsthand that not EVERY person who conceives a child is fit to be a parent. (thread)
@heyitsromy @thenyyboss @cathymcmorris @washingtonpost @GOP Then you haven't looked very hard. Pretty much every person I know who has adopted/fostered a child (or is actively doing so) is a liberal. For me to say only liberals do such work would sound about as ignorant as your statement.

@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG I would HOPE Jewish people are in tune enough with the issues to not feel that way.
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG No one...I repeat, NO ONE is saying Jewish people don't face challenges and/or discrimination. Actually, some do! But they tend to hate black/brown people, Muslims, and immigrants, too. So, there's that. We ALL know the challenges we face.

@AntiMedia Nor does it make it easier to get a good shot in an atmosphere of people running around. I got a grade of "Expert" with the 9mm when I was in the military. But that was with a standing target. Even professionals don't always prepare for scenarios like this.
@AntiMedia Even IF he didn't, should we have expected him to enter a high school with kids running frantically and just start shooting? A 19 year old surrounded by a bunch of people who looked just like him doesn't make for an easy target. 1/2
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG But when we go out into the world, I have no advantage over them in a system in which black people have no privilege. So, with all that thought and consideration, I STILL don't think it's the proper term. 2/2
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG FTR, I also think that term fails to encompass the full issue. For instance, I was born in Camden, NJ during the crack era. My mother never did crack so that gave me a relative advantage above my peers who had 2 crack addicted parents vs my 1 crack addicted parent. 1/2
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG The goal isn't to make people feel comfortable by calling their "relative advantage" something other than "privilege". The goal should be to dismantle a system that gives any advantage of one group over another based on race/religion/gender/etc. 3/3
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG NOT trying to belittle your point, because you made a cery valid argument. But focusing energy on semantics as it pertains to issues such as these just feels like misplaced energy. 2/3 (not 2, as I indicated in the last tweet).
@ToolsofControl @TalibKweli @MONTYOG I hear you, but here's the thing. The first synonym you'll find for privilege is "advantage". So, say we use your preferred term, "relative advantage", would that make you feel comfy cozy? 1/2

@nazihuntingbot @HelpfulWrits @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb a huge number of his supporters are. Unless you've been living under a rock, you already know this.
@ToolsofControl @MONTYOG @TalibKweli So, while you may not like the "term", which is your right, it seems a bit less than serious when discussing the entire issue. I mean, a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet. And privilege, by any other name, is still privilege.
@ToolsofControl @MONTYOG @TalibKweli Groups who speak out in defense of violence against oppression of black people are demeaned or accused of being reverse racists, but you can't even speak in defense of Palestinians without being accused of anti-Semitism or denying that Jews deserve to exist. THAT is privilege.
@ToolsofControl @MONTYOG @TalibKweli There are no African nations that receive the level of funding and military support that Israel does. It's so prevalent that hurricane victims in freaking Texas were instructed to never protest against Israel if they wanted to receive relief funding! 3/
@ToolsofControl @MONTYOG @TalibKweli After 400 years of slavery, then Reconstruction, Jim Crow laws, etc., descendants of slaves have still never received reparations. While the US has given money to survivors of the Holocaust. When WE discuss reparations, it's as though we're asking for a handout. 2/
@ToolsofControl @MONTYOG @TalibKweli Here's the deal. The UN organized to create the state of Israel which the US continues to fund and protect as it simultaneously loots and pillages in Africa, while excusing these atrocities by throwing change at Africans under the guise of "aid". 1/
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb No other race of people are discriminated against atound the world like black/brown people. I mean, these are all facts. But what is the underlying point you're attempting to make?
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb And the violence that arab nations receive from Israel &amp; the US (often under the guise of protecting Israel or anti-terrorism) is unmatched anywhere on the globe. It would be disingenuous to say that these issues don't go hand in hand at this point, IMO.
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb What is the point that you're trying to drive home? You appear to be moving the goal post a bit. At first you insinuated that the discrimination (or opposing privilege) didn't exist. Once it's been pointed out that it does, now you want to argue about which oppression is worse.
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb I never said that. Religious discrimination is to be expected in any theocracy/borderline theocratic state. Doesn't make it right, but it also doesn't make sense to deny it.
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb It's also not exactly new news that Muslims have regularly complained of facing discrimination in Israel.
@nazihuntingbot @TalibKweli @Demandor @thatdeb Well, what we do know is black Jews in Israel routinely face discrimination, vs their white counterparts. I'm not saying Jews never face discrimination, but white Jews do enjoy a certain amount of privilege in some cases. I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging it

@marcorubio Which is why we need continued easy access to guns, right? Because shooting people is the best way to overlooking an offense. Please stop twisting and misusing Bible verses in an attempt to defend your cowardice and refusal to take a moral stance as it pertains to this issue.
@seriouspersona @jonnyc863 @TalibKweli @Lilogreen8 I'm a college educated entrepreneur. I had to go to the military in order to afford a college education. I wasn't given any "extra points" for being black. Stop getting your talking points from racist memes and bots. It's beyond insulting.
@seriouspersona @jonnyc863 @TalibKweli @Lilogreen8 Your comments seem to insinuate that black people are not making advancements based on merit. While white women are the overwhelming beneficiaries of affirmative action, black women are the most educated in the country.
@seriouspersona @TalibKweli @Lilogreen8 If you're so upset about affirmative action, THAT should be the source of your outrage. Not because much needed legislation was implemented. "When you're accustomed to privelege, equality feels like oppression."
@seriouspersona @TalibKweli @Lilogreen8 The entire purpose for attempting to legislate behavior with affirmative action laws was because qualified individuals in minority groups were often passed over for positions/college entollment BECAUSE they were minorities.

@blklabs4u @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Arw you saying you feel this is a false flag?
@blklabs4u @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich BUT, the fact that you think this is confined to CNN speaks VOLUMES. Even considering all I know, I don't want regular citizens having automatic and semi-automatic weapons. I see how they're being used. We, as citizens, can have weapons. But WHY THESE??
@blklabs4u @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich You're speaking to me as though I'm not familiar with the Deep State. I'm a student of history. COINTELPRO and James Wormley Jones are both topics I've researched, along with Mockingbird. I know how this government works. 1/2
@nyclittleone @KimKardashian He had his day in court. They decided otherwise. Why condemn that man (AND HIS ATTORNEYS) even though he's been acquitted? And to post this on his daughter's tribute to her father? For what? It's so ugly.
@dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Have you seen ugly from the right, as well?
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Do you REALLY think an automatic or semi-automatic weapon will protect you against the government, if need be? Unless you have some tanks, fighter jets, and strategic weapons systems, I'd say you're already at a loss.
@blklabs4u @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich The fact that you find it easier to believe that a room full of people mourning the deaths of loved ones and fellow students rushed a stage yelling "burn her" (with no proof) speaks more about your beliefs about these people than it does the mainstream media.
@blklabs4u @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich I'm aware. I look to NONE of these as sources for absolute TRUTH. However, they have a platform and the people involved in this catastrophe used it.
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Hey, there was someone there who was armed and supposed to help in matters such as this. He froze. Even with 35 years of experience. So maybe more people with guns isn't the answer, either. Especially when the facts support that more guns = more gun violence.
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich FTR, these people aren't committing mass shootings with handguns. Individual shootings are an issue unto themselves. And we need a multifaceted approach to ALL of it. But banning automatic/semi-automatic weapons seems like a really good start.
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Most gun owners don't own guns like that. We mostly own handguns. I just don't see the need for common citizens to own those types of weapons. You're entitled to your opinion. As I am mine.
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich I don't feel we're punishing law abiding gun owners by saying we could use some new/stricter gun laws. And if someone breaks into my home with a handgun, I stand a chance. Most of us can say that. But when you're talking about someone with an automatic or semi-automatic, c'mon!

NSA warrantless wiretapping and surveillance of citizens  was "OK" under Bush because "anti-terrorism", even though it violates the 4th Amd, but now we're so concerned with the Constitution as it pertains to guns that mow down dozens in minutes. OK. Got it. #BanAssaultWeapons

@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich NSA surveillance programs (introduced under Bush/expanded under Obama) ALREADY infringe upon our 4th Amd rights. And so many are OK with it because "safety", "anti-terrorism", etc.
@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich I don't think we should get rid of the 2nd Amd. NEVER said that. Tanks are arms. Fighter jets are arms. We don't need them as citizens and shouldn't be able to legally possess them. We can own guns without them being automatic/semiautomatic weapons.
@marcorubio I actually applauded you for being the only Republican politician to show up. It looked as though your only thought was "FML" last night, and I felt kind of bad for you. And less than 24 hours later, this is what you're doing. You're a pathetic sellout who couldn't care less. 2/2

@OSRSKID @dementedlibs @Today69420 @barry_donovan @RealSaavedra @Cernovich Yeah, I NEVER threatened to. You sound crazy. I'm a vet. Expert shooter with my handgun of choice and have no deaire to give it up. Just not comfortable with the idea of citizens owning military grade/type weapons. 1/2

@abiolatv @YouTube I have been a longtime fan &amp; I have a very real question. How do you find yourself being able to maintain positivity in light of so much negativity. I know that we must be the light we wish to see. But sometimes I'm just in awe at how so many are so positive they seem unbothered.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola And even still, there are chances of dealing with undercover cops while trying to obtain illegal weapons. Being able to do so legally makes it far too easy.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola I once said the same thing. I felt like imposing gun laws was like imposing robbery laws when robbers don't follow laws anyway. However, I don't know that people who commit crimes with legally owned guns even know how to obtain them illegally.
@Doncone8 @the_undersore @johniadarola Should I walk away from this dialogue saying "Yet another conservative gun nut suggests we do nothing and allow these situations to continue"? Because I won't. Even though you've offered no substantive suggestions.
@Doncone8 @the_undersore @johniadarola People like you think in terms of either/or about issues that are far too nuanced to successfully do so.
@Doncone8 @the_undersore @johniadarola You're doing a LOT of inferring. And you aren't really good at it. Do me this favor, PLEASE don't walk away saying "I had a dialogue with a liberal, and she said..." Because you've been putting a LOT of words in my mouth.  So it would undoubtedly be a lie.
@ClayTravis @Outkick Misleading tweet. They have zero evidence of who did it. Saying they have "zero evidence of any racist graffiti" sounds like there's no evidence that it even existed.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola The approach MUST be multifaceted. But gun control MUST be a part of the solution.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola Gun control is ALSO an important component. People with mental health issues or a propensity towards violence should never be able to legally obtain guns.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola I believe in the latter half of what you said, as well. I grew up in Camden, NJ during the height of the war on drugs. I know that people with something to lose are less likely to do these things. I know access to mental health options is vital. BUT...
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola As it shouldn't.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola She asked why we joined. Family benefits? Many cheered. Education benefits? Even more cheered. Then she said NO. We joined to fight the enemy and drop bombs on targets. You have NO CLUE the mental conditioning that goes into this.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola After that, a senior officer took the stage saying that when we saw that, we should have been applauding at seeing our fellow patriots fighting for our freedoms! Then showed it again to allow us to cheer. I didn't. I thought it was all just creepy. 2/

@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola Know better than what?
@Rockenrobbinn @johniadarola Not EVERYONE should have a gun! A person who makes it clear that they have a desire to commit violence against innocents should NOT be permitted to legally obtain a weapon!
@Rockenrobbinn @johniadarola No, you don't. How about a vetting process that doesn't allow people with extreme mental dysfunctions to purchase weapons. Like the legislation Obama put in place that Trump ended last year.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola I come from a long line of vets and I've seen the affect the flashbacks can have on a person and family. So I agree on that point.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola My nonprofit works with the homeless. I recently met a Vietnam vet who is unable to function in society because of his delusions about the Viet Cong coming to get him at night to make him pay for what he did.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola And I DON'T support using our troops to conduct violence overseas that only advances the agenda of the elite and does nothing to make us safer at home.
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola I'm a vet. I know MANY "Johnnies" (as you put it). So I hear you; however, the guy who did this wasn't a vet, so...
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola I actually agree with you on that point. BUT...You said democrats twice in your original post. Never mentioned Republicans.
@Doncone8 @the_undersore @johniadarola Uh no.  I know MANY educators and NONE of them want to be charged with using a gun to protect themselves or their students. In the heat of the moment, there's no guarantee that your average teacher or citizen won't freeze or shoot the wrong person by mistake.
@Rockenrobbinn @johniadarola Who said repeal the 2nd Amd? And WHO said we should STOP at gun reform?
@Mongwau_Mochni @johniadarola Do you REALLY believe this is a Democrat thing?? Do you think Republicans aren't doing the exact same thing??

@peidays306 @SadBoiiMoe @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow Unfortunately, deregulation seems to serve the regular man horribly.

@peidays306 @SadBoiiMoe @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow The most recent market decline was due to higher wages. Which is why the stock exchange is never indicative of the greater market.

@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow That's just not true.

@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow But it shows that what you said is not true.

@peidays306 @SadBoiiMoe @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow It's honorable to support them. But even more honorable to have your own opinion. As I said, I come from a long line of vets. But in this information age, we know more about the actions of our government. I support their courage, but am willing to disagree on policy.
@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow But our continued support of disgusting actions by Saudi Arabia and Israel advances a global agenda which does not benefit us. Global empirialism does not benefit us. Yet they continue under Trump. Trump has even amped up the drone program which kills more civilians than anything
@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow Although I can't even begin to fathom how one could be proud of how Trump handles himself on the world stage. He reinforces all of the awful things other countries have suspected about us. It's utterly embarrassing to me.
@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow That is YOUR right. I disagreed with MUCH of Obama's foreign policies and well as some that affected us at home.  I abhorred his drone policies. But I can feel this way about Obama and still not be a fan of Trump.
@peidays306 @SadBoiiMoe @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow You wouldn't understand because you've never done it.

@peidays306 @SadBoiiMoe @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow He's actually right.

@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow You're spouting off far right talking points. Politics and people's political opinions are dar more nuanced than that. Be more open minded.

@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow Do you realize the president, at one time, had one of the most popular shows on television? Very few people started out just disliking him. I was open until I heard much of his campaign rhetoric. And I'm not even a Clinton fan.
@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow GENUINE appreciation IS appreciated. But we shouldn't be used as props to inflate someone's ego. Most of us recognize this ploy for what it is.
@peidays306 @BrandonMSparks @OttoTitsling @That_TimGuy @billupsdonald01 @Ben_M_Berry @jorozco31 @jodycourtney @MattWalshBlog @SteveDeaceShow I come from a long line of vets who have fought in every war since WWI.

@realDonaldTrump I would MUCH RATHER my tax dollars be spent on #UniversalHealthcare and #FreeCollege for Americans than nation building and maintaining the "empire". #HealthcareIsARight I believe most Americans would agree if the topics were discussed without the spin.
I sometimes wonder if she would still be here if she had adequate healthcare and didn't have to depend on ER visits for "treatment". Universal Healthcare shouldn't even be a debate. #HealthcareIsARight
She received emergency medical treatment and the doctors discovered that she also had developed an aggressive form of cancer. She died 2 months after her diagnosis. #HealthcareIsARight
A few months before she died, my mom found out about her addiction when she went missing. My mom notified the police and went knocking on crackhouse doors to find my aunt. The police found my aunt passed out in one of the houses. #HealthcareIsARight
At that point, she secretly started using heroin.  She became addicted. When she died, her affected leg was 4X the size of the other leg as the clot was blocking off the flow of blood. #HealthcareIsARight
Before my aunt died, she developed a bloodclot in her leg that was tangled in an important artery so it couldnt be removed. As it grew, the pain got worse. Eventually she could no longer afford her pain medication (an opioid). #HealthcareIsARight

@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump What is this? "I know you are, but what am I?" OK, bot. Get lost. You're here to cause divisiveness and nothing more. You've proven NOTHING. Most you did was present a deleted tweet. I see what this is. Get a life.

@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump But I'm not. Cool as a cucumber. Waiting for some evidence to your claims that non believers are the biggest victims of Islamic violence. And something to prove that you're NOT a bigot. Bored with your BS, if anything.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I said Islam is a religion and not a race so I'd never call you a racist based on the fact that you ARE a bigot. Sectarian. Against Islam. Clearly. Backpedaled where??
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I haven't backpedaled about a thing I've said. When you felt you were unable to prove your point, you claimed I called you a racist. I never did. I've shown you the definition of a bigot, which you fit.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump #1 victims of Islamic terrorism/violence are other Muslims. #2 MAJORITY of violence in the West is NOT done by Muslims. #3 MOST Muslims are nonviolent/peaceful. #4 Many nonviolent Muslims speak out against violence done in the name of Islam. PROVE ME WRONG.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump You've disproven NOTHING I've said.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I never spewed false accusations about you. I called out the false accusations you spewed about Muslims.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Your ignorant statements of Muslims said enough about you. I'm a Christian and I see that. What facts do I not have straight? Please...educate me.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I know Muslims of many races. So it wouldn't make sense for me to do so.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump You WANT me to feel your a racist. But Islam is not a race. So I'd never call you a racist based on your bigotry against Muslims.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump You looked up racist. A racist is bigoted based on race. But a bigot is not necessarily a racist, as bigotry does not depend on racial bigotry. I never called you a racist. Therefore defining what I called you based on a search term I never used is where you are wrong.

@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Anyone who searched for Muslims speaking out against Islamic terrorism or violence would find it. Anyone who heard that Muslims never speak out against terrorism done in the name of Islam and actually tried to find something contrary would find it.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Have you even TRIED to find Muslims speaking out? You're asking me to prove something to you that is clearly there if you chose to look for yourself. Which is why you cannot prove otherwise.  It's OK to be incorrect.

@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I don't believe we should EVER, as a country, say one thing and do another! It makes us look hypocritical! If you want to call out "Islamic terror", you damn sure shouldn't be arming Islamic terrorists!
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Yes! Yes, I WAS outraged! I was especially outraged at the increase in drone strikes considering that they hit innocent civilians about 90% of the time! Were you asking because you thought my answer was "no"?! I doubt it. üòí
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump That's the entire point! It's a small percentage of Muslims OVERALL! So WHY demonize an entire religion over the acts of a small percentage of them? ESPECIALLY when they are the overwhelming victims of Islamic violence!

@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump If that's not substantive, I don't know what is. You certainly can't provide anything to prove otherwise. If you hate Muslims, then you just do. But it takes NOTHING away from what I've said. It just speaks volumes about YOU and your ignorance and bigotry.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I told you more Muslims die at the hands of Islamic terror than we do. Fact. I told you more violence is done here by nonMuslims than Muslims. Fact. I told you many peaceful Muslims speak out against terrorism done in the name of Islam. Fact.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Your president did a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia! An extremely violent Muslim country. How in hell is that putting America First?! We armed the Mujahhideen in the 80's and they've attacked us. We're doing the same now! That's NOT America First!
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I guess, AS A CHRISTIAN, I care about PEOPLE FIRST! Nowhere in the Bible does it say I have to do anything else!
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump We were discussing how nonviolent Muslims feel about violence done in the name of Islam. The fact remains that only a small minority of Muslims are violent. I was responding to your OPINION of that FACT.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Whoa! An "apologist for Islam"?! WHY on earth would I EVER have to apologize for ANY religion?! Give me a break! Violent people own their OWN actions! Period!
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Being disappointed in Obama should NOT mean supporting Trump's nonsense. And it CERTAINLY shouldn't mean ignoring it.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Trump uses his platform to attack Americans who disagree with him or call out his BS. The difference is Obama normally ignored those people, which is why so many called him arrogant. Bush said plainly who "his people" were - the haves and the have mores.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I'm not any politician's cult member. I find it bothersome that so many Trump supporters ignore the fact that not only has the same agenda been continued, it's seemingly been put into high gear.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I had many unmet expectations of Obama, as well. But what I've actually seen is that it's a continuation of seemingly the same agenda, no matter WHO is in office. I voted for Obama, but I never backed down when I had very real criticisms (especially with the drone program).
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump (Ctd) And allowed them to help draft this tax legislation. He even had two former GS executives present it to the American people! What a slap in the freaking face!
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I'm more concerned with what we spend on unnecessary wars and nation building abroad. Trump promised he was against that, as well as being against Goldman Sachs. Yet, he brought the former president of GS into his administration (the one who helped cause the Great Recession)...
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Well, you DO know that the US has a cap on what they give to the UN. I believe it's a percentage of GDP. And the percentage has remained the same since 2001. It wasn't new under Obama.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump (Ctd) But they feel it often falls on deaf ears. Muslim organizations have even raised money for people in the West who have suffered violence from Islamic terrorists. But that's almost never discussed by MSM. And it damn sure isn't presented in far right media, mainstream or not
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump And #2, they don't see other American groups being held accountable for other people's acts of violence when it's a nonMuslim offender. It's seemingly a quagmire for them. That's when I learned of all the Muslim organizations that speak out against Islamic violence.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump They said how unfair it feels because #1, Muslims are dying pretty much daily at the hands of Islamic terrorists. But no one seems to care about that. Nonviolent innocent Muslim civilians are even often killed by attacks from the West. But there's no outrage for that.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Many Asians and Middle Eastern people frequent said market and they were terrified because whenever there's an act of Islamic violence that affects people in the West, they deal with harassment. Even though they're just trying to live their lives peacefully.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump One evening I was listening to Michael Smirconish and a guest of his was saying how Muslims need to step up and speak out against a recent terror attack or they'd have to own it. It just so happens that I was on my way to my local international market.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I fully trust NO corporate owned media. But, being that I live in an EXTREMELY diverse area of NJ, I was born and raised around Muslims and still do live around many. Being that I'm an entrepreneur AND I have a nonprofit, I regularly network with all types of people.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Of course you can cite sources when you use Google. You DO know that, right? And NOT following MSM is just the beginning. You should ALSO learn to not be so quick to assume things about others. You're lacking in that area.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Fox is shamelessly skewed to the right, MSNBS is shamelessly skewed to the left, and CNN's owner got his formatting plan from ESPN so that's normally a shitshow. Plus if I hear anything else about Russia I might jump off a cliff!
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Whatever tweet you forwarded to me is unavailable now, so... But who said I watch MSM? I don't. I listen to both conservative &amp; liberal news radio and follow independent media.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump This stuff isn't hard to find. You can easily search Google for examples. Have you ever researched your claim before stating it as fact?

@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I just find it a bit disingenuous when people talk about how horrible he was without acknowledging what he inherited vs what he left behind.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump When Obama took office, the unemployment rate was at 9.3%. He cut that in half. He also inherited the worst economy since the Great Depression! The markets DOUBLED under Obama. What he inherited from 8 years of Bush was ATROCIOUS! And I'm not even a fan of all his policies!
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump About 2% of active duty military members use food stamps and about 1.5 million veterans depend on them! When I was active duty, I saw other members have to get second jobs to support their families. And many of the homeless I serve are veterans. These issues are pervasive!
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump FAR MORE people who NEED the assistance are using it properly than those who are not.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Also, food stamps amount to roughly $1.50/meal. And that money goes to groceries, cooked food items aren't covered. Improper payments -which includes welfare fraud - amounts to roughly 10.1% of all those receiving benefits.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump The government passes legislation which affects all of us. We can't pat the government on the back when we're doing well as a country, but fail to hold them responsible when we aren't.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Republicans voted against that, too. Would that be the case if job creation was REALLY the goal?
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump And for the record, Dems tried to include an Amendment in the current tax plan that made cuts for middle class Americans permanent. EVERY Republican member voted against it. They also tried to make it mandatory for corporations to translate tax cuts into jobs...
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump ALook at where Islamic violence overwhelmingly takes place! It's normally against other Islamic sects. NOT nonMuslims! This is FACT! And multitudes of Muslims CONSISTENTLY speak out against Islamic violence!! However, it's normally not covered in right leaning publications.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump But I dig your enthusiasm.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump CHIP has been refunded for two months. But this tax plan (which overwhelming gives more help to people earning FAR MORE than most of us) was so important it had to be pushed thru in the middle of the night?! It shows where his loyalties lie. And it's NOT with us.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I live in NJ. This tax plan affects us on ALL levels (including state and local taxes).  This idea that cutting taxes for the rich or corporations and expecting it to magically translate into more jobs has been proven uneffective in the past.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Medicaid and Medicare are NOT community support issues. Healthcare is so much more than a community support issue. And I've been working with the homeless since I was a Catholic schoolgirl in 4th grade! This has been an issue far longer than the past 10 years!
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump It's not ALL ABOUT YOU just like it's not ALL ABOUT ME! There are real human consequences to the legislation that gets passed and the propaganda this man spews.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump My nonprofit also services children of poor people who depend on programs like CHIP and school lunch! They DO NOT feel supported. I work with poor children of illegal immigrants. Children who have broken NO LAWS. They DO NOT feel supported.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I'm a college educated veteran entrepreneur. Although I have VA benefits to fall back on, many in my family and immediate circle depend on the ACA, Medicaid, Medicare, welfare, etc. They DO NOT feel supported.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump I volunteer with the elderly who depend on Medicaid and Medicare. They DO NOT feel supported. My nonprofit works with the homeless, some of which are working poor people. They DO NOT feel supported.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Good for you!
@RepBuddyCarter You have no soul.
@NJTrumpWarrior @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump 1- nonviolent nonAmerican Muslims are the greatest victims of Islamic violence; 2- the overwhelming majority of violence in the US happens at the hands of non-Muslims; 3- only a small percentage of Muslims are violent. It's a non sequiter.
@germaineevent @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump But it doesn't mean he supports them. That's the point.
@worried_trucker @chandleraggie @Catherine3684 @realDonaldTrump So many of you Trump supporters LOVE to say that! Why didn't you follow that advice during Obama's presidency? ü§î If you had, we wouldn't be dealing with the nonsense we're seeing now.

@GeraldoRivera The man interviewing me even said so himself. He wasn't sure that bringing me back aboard would be good for morale. You have NO CLUE what we sacrifice when we report these things!
@GeraldoRivera Even though I had previously done the job I was interviewing for and the same man interviewing me had previously told me how great I did and not to hesitate if I ever wanted to come back, I wasn't hired BECAUSE of the fact that I reported the harassment. 2/
@GeraldoRivera I was first sexually harassed at a job at the age of 18. I reported it. The owner of the company made him apologize. But I still had to face this man daily. When I interviewed for a position at another company location, the fact that I reported harassment was brought up. 1/
@GeraldoRivera Sexual harassment is RAMPANT because, like you, many men feel their UNSOLICITED ADVANCES are merely flirtations.
@GeraldoRivera You sound INCREDIBLY ignorant.

@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube (Ctd) He told me THAT'S why black men prefer women of other races. Black women want too much. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We're not willing to help a man build! Mind you, I'm 37 and he's 41! This was a few years ago, but still. He was a temp manual laborer with a sneaker fetish. Like, grow up!
@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube Also, I have a homeboy who dates white women and Latinas exclusively. He once showed interest in me and I told him it would behoove him to move out of his mother's house into his own (for the 1st time) before he considered dating...
@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube And called me disloyal when I finally left. Chile...
@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube His mom left his real dad and chose the stepfather, but taught her son to be like his real father. He was her "other husband". She taught him to be what she needed and not what a woman would need.
@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube My ex always said his step father was a HARD menace, but dude always provided for his mom which is why he was raised by his stepfather and NOT his REAL dad.
@KremeDeLaKreme_ @kimmaytube And SO MUCH of that depends on how we raise these men. I spoke with my ex's father when we were together and he ASKED ME what I was bringing to the table to provide for his son while his son was unemployed! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@kimmaytube @KremeDeLaKreme_ (Ctd) Dude has a warehouse job, graduated before her and refuses to go to college. Even when she paid for a semester of community college FOR HIM! I want her to remain focused, but ALSO know that love isn't just "black love". She has options.
@kimmaytube @KremeDeLaKreme_ I'm showing this thread to my little sister! She had a child with her H.S. sweetheart. Studying nursing full time and working full time to keep my nephew in one of the best preschools in the area. She tried to stay loyal to his father...
@kibirdie @kimmaytube "Black love" is beautiful...but, hell, what "real love" ISN'T beautiful? I'm beginning to open up my options more. And if I find what I want/need in a non-black man, I'm not really here for the BS guilt trip.
@kibirdie @kimmaytube Yes, it's anecdotal, but I have black me. Who tell me often the ONLY reason a white man would want me is to fulfill some sort of "slave/owner fetish". It's also only black men who shame me for wanting a man who has his stuff together, calling me a "gold digger".
@kibirdie @kimmaytube It was the white men who took time to help me tweak my business plan and encouraged me. The brothas were more focused on themselves. It just gave me a different perspective on how I was approaching dating.
@kibirdie @kimmaytube I recently attended a weeklong workshop for vet entrepreneurs. Saw some brothas and was thinking "black love/build empires". They ALL were checking for Kim K. types, while several white men told me daily how beautiful I was.
@kimmaytube I honestly don't see how that can be debated debated based on statistics OR anecdotal evidence. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I know we're supposed to stay silent and respect the code. But no. The fact that we're told to deal with it is shameful.  #metoomilitary

...that what they have been defending is a lie. They are masters in redirection. It's almost scary. #Trump
When presented with facts,they are either "too tired" to continue,or they claim they want to unite. But they NEVER own up to the fact #Trump
One thing is for certain,WHENEVER I debate a @realDonaldTrump supporters (when they are open to debate), they NEVER admit he's wrong. #Trump
@billtown111 @brianefallon Thank you, as well, for attempting to be as open minded as I guess you can be. I appreciated the conversation. I'm glad it didn't end badly.
@billtown111 @brianefallon It's cool. Read it some other time if you care. But back to my original point, Gen Kelly was wrong. And needs to be accountable. GN.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I'm hesitant to use the term "insensitive" because I don't want sensitivity. I just want people to acknowledge and speak on right and wrong!
@billtown111 @brianefallon This is NOT just small potatoes for many of us. And being told to ignore it because "who cares" is beyond insulting and insensitive.
@billtown111 @brianefallon This was a superior in my squadron whom I had to trust to have my back if need be and he was a blatant racist. And I was told to stand down.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...choice. I spoke back to him in a term that was deemed "disrespectful to his rank". I was the one chastised and told to ignore it.

@billtown111 @brianefallon Where are you from?
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...some surrounding areas due to safety concerns with the KKK. What matters not to you is a huge matter for others.
@billtown111 @brianefallon You really don't get it. As I said, while wearing the uniform that "fly speck" was pervasive enough for black people to be told to avoid...
@billtown111 @brianefallon It's EASY for YOU to say "who cares?"  Me? Not so much. üòí
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...because the KKK was active. Out of a fear for my life and my safety. WHILE I WORE THE UNIFORM!
@billtown111 @brianefallon When I served, I was stationed in Panama City, Florida. There were areas within a half an hour of base I was ORDERED to stay away from...
@billtown111 @brianefallon You're better off simply saying you can't understand or ATTEMPTING to use empathy.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Who cares? I care! People who look like me care! When these people feel emboldened, Lord knows what levels they'd stoop to!
@billtown111 @brianefallon I hope it was based in facts and not conjecture or "feels".
@billtown111 @brianefallon And exactly where did you get your ".2%" figure?
@billtown111 @brianefallon But let me point out how quick you were to knock down what I said or act as though it had no merit.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I NEVER said he was! Don't put words in my mouth. I may have my opinions, but I don't speak on "feels" I speak on facts!
@billtown111 @brianefallon Then both (as well as supporters) have come out in support of Trump's rhetoric and his presidency altogether.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Richard Spencer/David Duke and followers have said they feel the white race is superior. Textbook definition of racism.
@billtown111 @brianefallon They SAY they are emboldened by him. How can anyone deny that when they say it for themselves?
@billtown111 @brianefallon Or how Trump supporters can BLATANTLY IGNORE the fact that bro nazis and racists consistently speak out supporting what Trump says!
@billtown111 @brianefallon I'm speaking on the meme about black violence.
@billtown111 @brianefallon THEN turn around and support a man who has retweeted racist tweets - that only exist to demonize black people -that have been proven wrong.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I STILL don't see how someone could take that ONE statement and turn it into an entire presidency being racially divisive!
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...they made a wrong choice.
@billtown111 @brianefallon It seems that no matter what he does, his supporters support him. Some have even said they ignore the bad because they don't want to feel...
@billtown111 @brianefallon But JUST as I stood and fought with people for supporting that mentality, I don't see Trump supporters who are doing the same.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Plus, THAT, to me was politically unsophisticated.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I knew there would soon come a time when a black man wouldn't be in the running. So it didn't make sense to support that mentality.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Hell, I was told I voted for Obama JUST because he was black. Even though I fought with people about doing so! It just seemed silly!
@billtown111 @brianefallon And it doesn't make it cool when Trump plays to that base.
@billtown111 @brianefallon It doesn't excuse it.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Not really minor if you look at the implications of the statement.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...would look like Trayvon. And what that means to certain people in this country. And that's just the truth! That shouldn't be divisive.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I think because MANY black people have dealt with this, Obama was trying to say, "It's wrong. I get it" by saying if he had a son, he...
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...throw things at me and call me nigger while telling me to "go home!"  But I had a right to be where I was, just as Trayvon did.
@billtown111 @brianefallon The SAME ugliness inside of Zimmerman that made him get out of the car and approach this kid is the same ugliness that made those racists...
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...looking, to Zimmerman, as though he didn't belong exactly where he was. A young black kid armed with nothing but Skittles and tea...
@billtown111 @brianefallon He never said "it would be Trayvon". He was addressing the fact that a teenage boy was approached and accosted for no other reason than...
@billtown111 @brianefallon The white woman who ran the after school program I attended taught me about it.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I was never warned of it. My mom never taught me about race because she never wanted me to feel inferior based on this country's history.
@billtown111 @brianefallon It didn't make me believe EVERY white person was racist! I had MANY white friends! But I knew it existed. And THAT'S how I found out lol
@billtown111 @brianefallon My mom sent me to a mostly white private school in a white neighborhood to keep me out of Camden, NJ's failing public school system.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I'm only 37 and as a child I had a car full of white adults drive by me and throw trash at me while yelling, "Go home, nigger!"
@billtown111 @brianefallon Hell, my mom is younger than you and when she was born in 1963 her parents couldn't vote! And look at what THAT took!This wasn't so long ago
@billtown111 @brianefallon How? I've always asked how he divided the country along racial lines and I never get an answer. Please explain this to me.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Roger Stone, the man deeply involved in Trump's campaign, admittedly played on people's racial biases to get Trump elected.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...unaddressed for another 20 years just to get leaders of the south on board. That set an ugly political precedent.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...issues of racism in a country that was built on racist ideals. At the Constitutional Convention, it was agreed that slavery would be...
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...that people had certain expectations of him as the first black president that were unrealistic. There was NO WAY for him to heal...
@billtown111 @brianefallon I certainly didn't agree with many of his policies. And I felt there were times he could have done much better as POTUS. But I also think...
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...or apologize when he's offensive. He merely plays further to his base while attacking the rest of us Americans! His base does the same!
@billtown111 @brianefallon But, you must be honest, the president doesn't help that cause. His ego is his downfall. He refuses to admit when he's wrong...
@billtown111 @brianefallon For a long time, he had one of the highest rated TV shows! People of ALL races loved him! It was the things he said that changed that for us
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...that, I get it. HOWEVER, that doesn't make it OK to defend his blatant unpresidential behavior now that he IS president!
@billtown111 @brianefallon I think many people ignored the ugliness of much of his rhetoric and chose to focus on his populist message. And while I don't agree with...
@billtown111 @brianefallon No. We've never had a discussion about WHY you support him. I know there were millions of Obama supporters who voted for Trump! Literally!
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...because they feel Trump is attacked simply for being Trump! It's hypocritical and divisive! And honestly, politically unsophisticated.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...against Obama for fear of being called a "racist", then turn right around and disparage anyone who speaks out against Trump just ...
@billtown111 @brianefallon Politicians and government officials OWE US loyalty, NOT the other way around! Many Trump supporters say they felt they couldn't speak out..
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...with simply because I knew SOME of the people doing so we're doing it based on race and not merit.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...who disagreed with his policies was racist. And it didn't mean I had to sacrifice my own morals to defend him on policies I didn't agree
@billtown111 @brianefallon After Obama was elected, I SAW racists say they'd never accept a "nigger president". But that didn't mean to me that every white person...
@billtown111 @brianefallon Viewing things thru that lens will make you unwilling to accept facts about his missteps or even defend the indefensible.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...lie to defend the POTUS. It's not only disheartening, but more than a little alarming.
@billtown111 @brianefallon I served with people whose political beliefs were totally different from my own. But I have never seen so many distort facts or blatantly...
@billtown111 @brianefallon She chose not to. It's STILL not a setup.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Most of us don't. I'm just more than a little put off by the propensity of Trump supporters to constantly ignore the missteps of this Admin.
@billtown111 @brianefallon An Army vet buddy of mine served with this man. Everyone in the car heard the conversation because it was on speakerphone.
@billtown111 @brianefallon How was this a setup?
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...collect his remains from the airport. There was no way for her to know POTUS would call then. The widow chose to take the call on speaker
@billtown111 @brianefallon No because she didn't know those families. She actually has a long history with this family. She was asked by the family to join them to...
@billtown111 @brianefallon If POTUS' message was misconstrued, the presidential thing would have been to clarify. Not to turn it into a Twitter battle.
@billtown111 @brianefallon General Kelly agreed that what she said POTUS said WAS actually said. They seem to differ in opinion about the spirit of POTUS' words.
@billtown111 @brianefallon But I'm still wondering why General Kelly telling a blatant lie in order to disparage her is a fact so many choose to ignore.
@billtown111 @brianefallon ...it was racist. This was before I heard the Congresswoman say anything of the sort.
@billtown111 @brianefallon In all fairness, after the widow said she felt her slain husband was disrespected by POTUS, I heard people of all races saying they felt...
@billtown111 @brianefallon Are you saying General Kelly did not bring up the unrelated 2015 incident and lie about it? Or are you simply choosing to not address it?

@billtown111 @brianefallon ...on the part of the president. But there was NO REASON to bring up a totally unrelated event and lie about it other than to disparage her.
@billtown111 @brianefallon Also, he agreed that what she quoted the president saying was actually said. Maybe there was a miscommunication as it pertained to emotion..
@AnnCraw70443950 God bless you, as well.
