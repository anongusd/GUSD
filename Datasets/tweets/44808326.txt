@dpkronmiller You can’t tell the gender or skin color of these people in that shot? Really? https://t.co/HFaLw4kLIb
Why is this relevant you ask? In 2016, one of Bernie Sanders’ biggest problems was that, while he did well in states where Democratic voters were largely white, he struggled with more diverse states. He lost black voters to Clinton 76-23 &amp; lost heavily among women over 24. https://t.co/5r02aBE3BW
@ten4noswitches I never said why those things happen. You asked me why I thought much of his support is personality driven. The surveys demonstrate that policy is not the main driver. Of course it was for some. For a larger number, though, it was not.
@offgridfarmer The fact that his base of supporters of disproportionately white and male was a problem for him in 2016 that prevented him from winning the nod, and these majority white male crowds in *Brooklyn* suggest he still isn’t winning over women and POC.
@offgridfarmer Surveys in 2016 showed him losing the vote of non-white voters to Hillary Clinton by large margins. Here in Mississippi, he lost the black vote to her 90-10, and it was similar in other Southern states. The only demographic he beat her among (not by huge margins) was white men.
@come2homercles Hundreds of the backs of brunette haired heads doesn’t count as people of color, you know. Did you even zoom in on the faces near the top of that photo?
@wickdchiq @Calamitatis I am gay. I also know that most LGBT people, including most gay white men to a slightly lesser extent, tend to trend towards identifying with the same crowds/coalitions as women and POC, and not the ones that are predominantly made up of straight cis white men.

These wide shots of the crowd that came out to see Bernie Sanders in Brooklyn today, which is majority non-white, show a largely white, mostly male crowd.

@rafaelshimunov Notice that the shots I tweeted are wide shots that include dozens upon dozens of supporters, while yours are selective shots that either include only a handful or are of the supporters the campaign positioned behind the candidate.
Not saying we need to hold women politicians to lower standards or that I won’t scrutinize them at all, but there’s no shortage of scrutiny of women prez candidates. We won’t undo systemic political sexism overnight, but can help correct the imbalance if some of us focus on men.
Why I scrutinize Bernie more, &amp; will scrutinize Beto &amp; Biden more if they run. It’s not that women in politics don’t deserve equal scrutiny. It’s that they already get a disproportionate amount of it, &amp; for things men don’t get the same scrutiny for. Let’s correct the imbalance. https://t.co/SRDMjO9t65
@dhanuraashi @ten4noswitches Agreed.
@Getover161 Find a photo of a crowd at another Democratic candidate’s event, or even a Trump rally, where you can find a shot of any similarly sized segment of the crowd that is that heavily male.
@ImNotOwned All candidates select who stands behind them at rallies, yes, but Hillary Clinton won black voters in North Carolina by 3-1 against Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries. I doubt her crowds in Charlotte were overwhelmingly white and male.
@sayarita @ZeldaFan180 @BernieSanders @MrDane1982 There are dozens upon dozens of people in that shot. It’s not like it’s zoomed in on a select group of 10 people.
@Calamitatis If you’re suggesting that a lot of black supporters really are in this photo, but they’re just nearly all light-skinned... well, that’s *quite* a weird take and poses new questions.
Another shot of Bernie’s Brooklyn crowd. https://t.co/LR1amFj3pI
@MelissaAGarriga @LisaTalmadge Here’s another section of the crowd, though you’ll have to zoom likely. But it’s hard to find a shot of so many people in a crowd that is that heavily white and male for any candidates anywhere. Maybe if there had been just 10-15 people in the frame you could argue that. https://t.co/kfhGpQFiBW
@Karl_Dilkington You should ask Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
@Calamitatis Faces are things
@ten4noswitches I‘ll be honest, though: I’ll spend more time scrutinizing men who have personality-driven, messianic auras around their candidacies. Why? Bc there will always be more than enough scrutiny of women, &amp; less of men—who often avoid scrutiny for things that would kill women’s runs.
@ten4noswitches The media applied a much higher level of scrutiny to Hillary Clinton in 2016 than to Bernie, &amp; part of that was bc she was the frontrunner. This time, Bernie is a frontrunner. If Biden, who I’ve already scrutinized some, jumps in, he’ll get the same treatment as a frontrunner.
Here is another crowd shot from another angle. Still overwhelmingly male, largely white. https://t.co/r9yWbYKqWO
@ajagbeadewole Your implicit suggestion in this tweet, btw, is that “people of color” and “the left” are separate entities, as if the left is a white entity. Many of the most important and formative leaders on the left have been people of color.
@anaphoristand There is no other candidate I can think of where you could take a screengrab of that large of a group of crowd and it be so overwhelmingly white *and* male (a Trump crowd would be that white, but not that male). But I digress. I’m posting these again. https://t.co/pHLs22dmV9
@ajagbeadewole Your implicit suggestion here is that, on the left, only a majority of white are smart enough not to fall for the alleged “propaganda.”
@ARDFootball @stetayen Imagine using the same argument to argue for Bernie Sanders’ diverse appeal as Mark Meadows used to argue that Trump wasn’t racist even while he used a black woman as a prop at the Cohen testimony a few days ago.
Brooklyn is only about 35% non-Hispanic white, 36% black, and 20% Hispanic.
Here’s a Trump crowd for comparison. Very white, but a far larger percentage of supporters are female than the crowds who came out to see Bernie Sanders in Brooklyn today. https://t.co/Jwssfu7a0t
This crowd at Bernie Sanders’ Brooklyn rally is almost as a white as any Trump crowd, but significantly more male than any crowd at a Trump rally. The #BernieInBrooklyn crowd appears about 85-90% white and male. https://t.co/dNJxpSNOsA
@ajagbeadewole The group behind him is not 90% white and male–it looks far more like Brooklyn. The crowd in the picture in front of him, though, does appear to be about 90% white and male.
@ARDFootball @stetayen Trump has hired people like Ben Carson, Nikki Haley and Omarosa. But that doesn’t mean his campaign’s base is very diverse, now does it?
@ARDFootball @stetayen I’ve been to a lot of campaign rallies. I’ve never been to one, even a GOP rally, where you could find a group of people that large where 90%+ were white men. And the crosstabs from the 2016 primaries back this up.		But here are more images of the crowd. https://t.co/Nd7zyx9wLp
@stetayen @ARDFootball ARD is suggesting that demographics don’t matter, which is something Bernie himself suggests. Of course, we all know you can’t win with just a majority of white men in a Democratic primary.
Brooklyn is 36% black, 20% Hispanic, and 35% non-Hispanic white. Presumably, around half of Brooklynites are also women.
The supporters positioned behind Bernie Sanders in Brooklyn today looked a lot more diverse than the group of supporters standing in front of him. #BernieInBrooklyn https://t.co/Vg7TyATYXO

That argument also pretty much rules out most Democrats in red states, which are often inelastic, from national political ambitions, locking Democratic voters into choosing among blue state candidates. No Ann Richards allowed?
Democrats will make plenty of arguments for or against Beto O’Rourke. “He would be a bad candidate because he wouldn’t even win his home state” is an odd one, though. The man who sits in the Oval Office right now lost his home state by 22.5 points. In 2018, Beto lost Texas by 3.

When Bernie Sanders visited Moscow in 1988, 43 million Soviets lived on less than $173 (2019 dollars) a month. He praised their youth programs &amp; “absolutely beautiful” train stations with “beautiful chandeliers.” But homeless Soviets were using those stations for shelter. https://t.co/JrEufn8Wrp

@ten4noswitches And that’s not a knock on Bernie. People learn, grow, change. And hopefully politicians respond to changes in voters’ demands. I’d be more concerned if a politician never changed their views over 30 years. Consistency of integrity is more important than immovable views.
@ten4noswitches Even Bernie doesn’t have that consistent track record. He used to be far more friendly to gun manufacturers than he is now. He voted for the 1994 crime bill. As recent as 2006, he opposed an effort to legalize gay marriage in Vermont because he said it’d be too controversial.
@ten4noswitches If Bernie, a white man, is an outlier, then, surely, the woman who, out of nearly 50 Democratic presidential nominees, is the only one who was not a man, is also an outlier. Right?
@ten4noswitches And people called her “the establishment” for beating that system and resting control of it for a few months, as if she was born into it. We force women to play by men’s rules better than any man, then when they beat that system, we act like they are the entitled ones.
@ten4noswitches There’s a difference when it comes to “establishment” women. To succeed in politics, women have had to play by rules set up by and for men, and they’ve had to be 10x better. For the first time in history, a woman seized control of that establishment in 2016.
@ten4noswitches Are you really trying to argue that Bernie Sanders, a 30 year member of congress, is not part of the historically powerful and not-oppressed white male establishment?

@MayorHalMarx See also: Tulsi Gabbard is a woman of color, but the same people in the Democratic Party who are anti-Bernie tend to be just as strongly opposed to her as to him if not more. And that’s because they don’t like her policies and record. Her identity doesn’t override that.
@MayorHalMarx I mean, I didn’t see any of those Dems voting for Sarah Palin to be VP in 08, or Herman Cain or Michele Bachman in 2012, or Carly Fiorina or Marco Rubio or Ben Carson in 2016. That’s because while, yes, many like breaking barriers, the policy + record is primarily why they vote.
@MayorHalMarx If voters wanted to “check off a box,” they could’ve chosen Al Sharpton 4 years before Obama. And instead of “Obama or Hillary?” in 2008, they could’ve chosen a black woman in 2004–Carol Moseley Braun. But they didn’t, because the consideration is always more than just identity.
@MayorHalMarx Democrats want diverse representation, sure. But implicit in Bernie’s argument is that people would only vote for, say, Kamala Harris, because she’s a woman of color. But she is highly accomplished (moreso than Bernie in less time).
@MayorHalMarx If the non-white male candidates did not have equal or better qualifications than him, it might make more sense. But the other candidates are all just as qualified or more, and the female senators running have more policy substantive successes.
@MayorHalMarx Nope. But his defensiveness on the point seems to be based upon the fact that he is now running in the most diverse field in history. Half are women, about 70% are white—which is really close to the actual demographics of the country.
Now, with multiple women running for president, and with several of them being women of color, and with AOC in the spotlight, Fox News has kicked its “reporting” on scary women into overdrive, casting them as dangerous and stupid, knowing their viewers will angrily eat it up.
Fox News’ biz model relies on feeding viewers’ addiction to a sense that they are being culturally victimized. For a certain demographic, assertive women untethered to men’s interests are triggering. That‘s why Fox spent the last 6 years as the “LOOK WHAT HILLARY DID” channel. https://t.co/6lzZEp9JTy

@ten4noswitches Were you as concerned that white males were nullifying votes of non-wm Clinton supporters in 2016 when they called her “the establishment?” 		White men have been the establishment for centuries. Women, LGBT, &amp; POC had to fight 10x as hard by rules rigged against them to compete.
@MayorHalMarx 43 out of the 44 people who have been president were white, and 44 of 44 have been men.		The way Sen. Sanders (a self-described socialist btw) talks, you’d think he was struggling to break a glass ceiling for white men.
“I charge you to drop every paltry and insignificant thought for any man's success. It is nothing; I am nothing...But do not destroy that immortal emblem of Humanity—the Declaration of American Independence.”	—Lincoln, 1858, arguing against slavery 		https://t.co/3o5G9ZPhpm

Lincoln was arguing that the spirit of the Declaration should always be considered when looking at moral and Constitutional questions. “All men are created equal,” for him, was an ongoing revelation—not something the founders or any one era of Americans would fully grasp.
Abe Lincoln warned of “the tendency of prosperity to breed tyrants”: “When, in the distant future some man, some faction, some interest, should set up the doctrine that none but rich men, or none but white men, were entitled to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness...” https://t.co/WidpphCySw

@ThinkingWoman9 The way I understand it, unless your ancestors were African slaves on American soil, ADOS says you don’t count the same way.
With Matt Schlapp so close to the White House, one has to wonder: Where did he get the idea that Bill Barr’s conformation will lead to the end of the Trump/Russia investigation? Where did he get the idea that the new AG is there to do Trump’s bidding—not to uphold the law?
No, your tweet is a weird tweet, @maggieNYT. The tweet you call “weird,” by lobbyist @mschlapp, whose wife is the White House Strategic Communications Director, is chillingly celebratory &amp; pro-authoritarian. It claims AG Barr will end the Mueller probe at Trump’s behest. https://t.co/SrcytWkvmb

@kimmurphy100 I think the fact that Andrew Jackson is Trump’s favorite president and Abraham Lincoln is Obama’s favorite president speaks a lot to the way the parties have changed. @KevinMKruse has a really good thread on this. Let’s see if I can find it.
How Jacksonian ideology came to play a role in the Trump White House: https://t.co/HiRiOuCEel https://t.co/j0MrJfCDLF
Trump made a deplorable reference to the Trail of Tears this evening,l. After his inauguration, he had a portrait of Andrew Jackson—a key purveyor of that genocide against tens of thousands of Native Americans—hung in the Oval Office. He regularly invokes Jackson as a favorite. https://t.co/kGPZ4dMYN0
@DonnerKay The backstory on the portrait and Bannon’s peddling of Jacksonian ideology: https://t.co/UQCDI49HDG
@DonnerKay Me too. That’s always made me feel icky even when I’m enjoying being there.
@DonnerKay New JFP editorial idea to the city: “You change your name, we’ll change ours.”
@DonnerKay And one of the key purveyors of that genocide, Andrew Jackson, has been named by Trump as his favorite president. He hung a portrait of him in the Oval Office right after his inauguration. https://t.co/WiOZVRs45m
Trump hung a portrait of his favorite president, Andrew Jackson, the first Democratic president, in the Oval Office.		By contrast, Barack Obama's favorite president is Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president.
"Indian removal was not just a crime against humanity, but a crime against humanity intended to abet another: By clearing the Cherokee from the South, Andrew Jackson hoped to open up more land for cultivation by slave plantations."		https://t.co/RzzfORj51N
Donald Trump's favorite president is Andrew Jackson, a key figure in the forced removal and ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of Native Americans in what became known as "The Trail of Tears." Note how Trump caps "TRAIL" here. Jackson was the first Democratic president. https://t.co/sEpMxPBLN5

Tate Reeves’ fraternity had a reputation for racism at Millsaps when he was there. In a 1994 opinion piece, Kiese Laymon wrote: “At Millsaps, I know we’ve overcome racism, and if the word ‘n**ger” is ever uttered, it could only be echoed from the walls of Kappa Alpha House.” https://t.co/WIfdATGcaR
One of Lt. Gov. Reeves’ yearbooks shows images from his fraternity’s Old South Ball — where they dressed as Confederate gentlemen and ladies. In some cases, with Confederate flags accenting even their waistbands. https://t.co/Wob45hNsPW
@strangedeadfish Their frat pages in the yearbook are always full of nonsensical stuff like this. In jokes, I assume
Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is running for governor of Mississippi, has not shied away from Confederate flags in his post-Kappa Alpha days. In this photo, posted on Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith’s Facebook page a few years ago, he’s holding one in a display case. https://t.co/n85Ew4qmCt
A 1994 issue of Millsaps College’s student newspapers describes an incident in which members of Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ fraternity, apparently wearing blackface and Confederate flags, shouted back and forth at black students on campus, and caler them “n**gers!” https://t.co/kTWdkRP27X
In this screenshot, you can see a reference to Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (then a Millsaps student” being “at the Robert E. Lee bar.” To the left is a photo of two Kappa Alpha members dressed in drag, one wearing an afro. May be from a “black and white” party they refer to. https://t.co/hriJrOvpkk
Mississippi Lt. Gov Tate Reeves’ frat, Kappa Alpha, was known for chanting “1 2 3! Robert E. Lee! The South shoulda won!” They still describe Robert E. Lee—slaveowner &amp; Confederate General who whipped &amp; poured salt into the wounds of escaped slaves—as their “spiritual founder.”👇🏻 https://t.co/g1AGHCrqpu
On the page for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’  fraternity in the 1993 yearbook, they feature a photo from 1966, showing how new recruits were invited to join Kappa Alpha by a mammy-like figure. https://t.co/w3MFUXOH1P
Each year Reeves was there, the Kappa Alpha page included highly offensive photos, like this blackface photo. On the page next to all of these photos, you can see photos of all members, including Reeves (note: left photo is from 1993; right 1995) https://t.co/lJAZcXJ1uM
THREAD: For days, I’ve been scanning Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ Millsaps yearbooks.

@ShondaMac1 Black people should never be costumes nor any oppressed minority, but I can remember in kindergarten having a day where teachers had us all dress as Indian chiefs &amp; princesses. School taught me racism was personal, individual thing. I had to learn about systemic racism on my own.
Worth asking: Why are no Dems polling ahead of Trump (who is extremely unpopular) by double digits the way HRC, running for a third Dem term, was polling against nearly all potential Repubs in 2013/2014/early 2015? Is it just bc the GOP is so consolidated around Trump?
Biden doesn't poll that high against Trump &amp; while over 60% of Dems polled at this time wanted HRC, Biden draws 20-30%. Also, there are big Dem stars on the field that weren't known in 2015 (Kamala, Beto, etc.). And it's not a 3rd term—it's a 1st term after highly unpopular Dem.
Difference: After she left Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton's approvals were 69%, and she was the most popular pol in the country. Dems were also trying to win a third term for the first time since the 1800s, and early on she polled 15-20+ points ahead of most Repubs. https://t.co/xKqHsxLO7L

@Tammy_Beth @DonnerKay In this case, he was interviewed by a gay man who was once a closeted, activist evangelical as a teenager. I didn't let him off the hook on the subject. ;)
Sometimes, "it's the rare case of rapidly decompensating maternal heart disease or a delayed diagnosis of anencephaly, where the fetus forms without a complete brain or skull, that bring people to these decisions."		Hardly about "convenience."		https://t.co/03ywWz3p82
I have spoken to a conservative, evangelical woman who called herself "pro-life" and desperately wanted a baby, but had an abortion at 7 months because the fetal deformity was so severe the doctor told her it was suffering "excruciating pain" and die at birth.
As an aside, "late-term abortion" is not a medical term, and the procedure it refers to are done "often because a fetus has a condition that cannot be treated and will never be able to survive—regardless of the gestational age or trimester."	https://t.co/03ywWz3p82

PS: Though the Student Printz did not publish the photo, I did obtain a copy of it later and write a blog that included the photo (that blog is long since gone).
Sad thing is, I thought I had a pretty good grasp on America’s history of race and civil rights bc I despised the Confederate flag, &amp; also bc I knew about the Emancipation Proclamation &amp; Rosa Parks on a bus &amp; Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. But I knew so little.
Ignorance is no excuse for sorority girls wearing blackface. But our education system in America really has no excuse for letting white students leave the school doors as ignorant about our nation’s history of white supremacy as they (or as I, an A student) apparently were.
While in that class, I read “White Flight: Atlanta &amp; the Making of Modern Conservatism” by @KevinMKruse. Suddenly, I was making connections between Atlanta in the 60s &amp; the Mississippi I live in today. It even helped me understand the Trayvon Martin case.		https://t.co/J1vgkMAmxW
I didn’t believe him, but by 2011, I really, really wished I’d taken that class. Finally, in college in 2013, I signed up for a “Civil Rights Movement” history class that changed my life. There, I learned about Mississippi’s Fannie Lou Hamer, my favorite civil rights hero.
I asked a white student who was in that class (not because he chose it, but because he had been placed in it because he had no other options) what it was like, and he said, “It’s just a class where they try to make you feel guilty for being white.”
Why wasn’t rigorous civil rights and racial history required in high school? I remember we had a “minority studies” elective that I almost signed up for, but I wasn’t sure what it was and it conflicted with another class.
It really made me resent the shallow education I’d had so far when it came to civil rights history and the history of white supremacy (which I still just called “racism” then). I should have already known about blackface before it became a story at my college newspaper.
It was this incident that made me read up and learn all about blackface, and why even without exaggerated features and intended as a depiction of TV show characters (or for ex Michael Jackson), it was just as horrific.
Here’s what I’m almost ashamed to admit: I believed them when they said they didn’t know what blackface was, bc until that incident, I really didn’t know what it was either. I’d seen historic, obviously offensive depictions &amp; exaggerated features. I didn’t know the word for it.
“The six students (were) placed on probation by the national sorority and chapter sanctions (included) multiple diversity and cultural competency educational requirements.”	https://t.co/zwjs7EelMp
I was on the Student Printz at the time, &amp; we debated whether or not to publish the photo because some worried about publicizing their identities. I argued that the photo should be published, and suggested black bars over their eyes. It wasn’t published, though.
In 2011, a group of Phi Mu sorority girls at Southern Miss dressed up in blackface as the Huxtables for a 1980s themed party.

@cynthiaetheri11 Examples of parts of the left sweeping concerns of anti-Semitism under the rug? Jeremy Corbyn remains the leader of the Labour Party in the UK, doesn’t he? And he draws admiration from parts of the US left. Concerns of anti-Semitism remain re: leadership in the Women’s March.
@cynthiaetheri11 No, it doesn’t look like she’s sweeping it under the rug. And part of the reason for that is because people called her out for it and made her aware of their concerns. And I hope she continues to engage with her Jewish supporters and really seeks to address those concerns.

@mudlarklives @AOC With Corbyn, though, I do think a lot of left wingers in the US who love Bernie see him as a Bernie from across the pond.
@mudlarklives @AOC She similarly waved off concerns about her participation in the Women’s March, saying we should take concerns about anti-Semitism seriously, however... (needless to say, she did not challenge members of the WM who have engaged in anti-Semitic behavior).
@Tavalani3 What do you mean exactly? Would like to hear your full thoughts with examples.
It’s possible for someone to like AOC but still call her to account for embracing a UK politician that 85% of British Jews consider anti-Semitic (and not without cause). We should hold all politicians accountable—even ones we like (or love). Them especially, some would say.
*Corbyn. I really wish autocorrect would stop
@cynthiaetheri11 I am saying that the left often overlooks Jewish concerns about anti-Semitism and brushes it under the rug. That doesn’t make you an anti-Semite, just like brushing sexual assault under the rug doesn’t make one guilty of sexual assault. It’s a blindspot that needs addressing.

@AnneScheer @mccrummenWaPo @nytimes @washingtonpost @Fahrenthold So I think articles like this are really helpful, &amp; will be quite helpful to future historians and reporters when they’re trying to debunk the inevitable “It wasn’t about race” myths.

@AnneScheer @mccrummenWaPo @nytimes @washingtonpost @Fahrenthold As someone who spends lots time on history &amp; debunking myths about what white people thought &amp; why they did things (like set up 100s of private schools after integration), 1960s articles where white racists spoke openly are so helpful in debunking “It wasn’t about race” myths.

@debr3322 @realDonaldTrump Not always true. I’ve gotten spray tans before, but only after careful research to make sure I knew how to do it without looking orange or cakey or uneven. I also never do it more than a couple shades darker. You can get a nice, even, light brown shade if done right.

@AnneScheer @mccrummenWaPo @nytimes @washingtonpost @Fahrenthold For me, I thought it was far better than sinister, boogeyman portrayals of overtly racist, white Southerners—because it reflects the reality of most racists: People who think they are good people, who appear kind to neighbors, who are friendly, don’t wear blackface, etc.

@AnneScheer @mccrummenWaPo @nytimes @washingtonpost @Fahrenthold Did you read the entire story? Because I actually find a really nuanced portrayal of the insidious nature of Southern goodness—of how people who pride themselves on being nice, not-racist people perpetuate racism and never feel compelled to understand the racism others face.
@smartstatistic And I think part of why white liberals are so slow to forgive may be because having obvious, blatantly racist boogeymen like Northam in blackface helps give them, like you said, something to point to so as not to deal with their own more subtle racism.
@smartstatistic And maybe it’s because he thought it would be unforgivable so it’d be better to hide it. But in my experience, black people overall are far more willing to forgive something like this when someone is sincerely repentant than white liberals.
@smartstatistic Ralph Northam could have had a really powerful moment if, after Charlottesville, he had given a speech on the scale of Mitch Landrieu’s Confederate statues speech and talked about when he did blackface, and his racist past, and how he saw his past self in those racist tiki Nazis.
@smartstatistic This. What politicians like Ralph Northam don’t get is that there is a hunger to see white people, not to have a perfect record on race, but to publicly wrestle with those demons honestly as an example to other whites. People love a redemption narrative.

@tjm1208 Lincoln writes at the end of the letter: “I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.”		That is precisely what he is doing with the letter itself to preserve support among northern Republicans and for the emancipation proclamation he’s about to sign.
@tjm1208 In other words, Lincoln wasn’t actually entertaining the idea of preserving the union while letting slavery remain intact. He just wanted nervous northern Republicans to believe that he was considering all options so that they’d accept his signing of the EP when he did it.
@tjm1208 Context: At the time Lincoln wrote that letter, he already had the Emancipation Proclamation on his desk ready to sign. That letter was to assure nervous Nothern Republicans that whatever decision he made, it would be for the union. But his decision was already made.

Some say they are shocked that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand did not immediately call for Ralph Northam to resign—after all, didn't she immediately call for Al Franken to resign? No. The photo and allegations first surfaced on Nov. 16. She called for him to resign on Dec. 6.
@FakeEmily65 @MickIrishMuslim @SenGillibrand And then other Dems followed. But she only called for him to resign after he'd had ample chance to explain himself publicly. Still, we're talking weeks before she made the call that other Democrats followed. Not days. Maybe Dems are just quicker to react to racism than misogyny?
@FakeEmily65 @MickIrishMuslim @SenGillibrand So, if Kirsten Gillibrand had called on Al Franken to resign the same day the sexual assault allegations and the photo first surfaced, I think you'd have a point. But if you look at the timeline, the photo/story first hit on Nov. 16. She called for him to resign on Dec. 6.

@NYCtoCincy @M_F_Ninja You’re making connections between unconnected things.		The wall is not getting built at least in part because the person who proposed it never put any thought into the politics and policy that would be necessary to get it done, and just relied on slogans and vague promises.
@MelissaAGarriga The “you” was the general “you politician proposing this” you, not the personal you you.
@MelissaAGarriga So give me details on how &amp; where you’ll cut the defense budget w overinflated areas identified, show math on tax plans for revenue, etc. I’m not saying it’s far fetched. I’m just saying, politicians *should* be expected to bring research &amp; details to back up policy proposals.
@MelissaAGarriga I’m probably spoiled.		But this is probably something that needs to change about American political culture more general.
@jbenmenachem @MelissaAGarriga I did specify candidates who have announced. Bernie has not. Still, I want to see more details on his plan here, too — like the math that backs up the claims of how much he says things will cost/how much those taxes will raise.
@MelissaAGarriga There have been some vague plans floated before by various different groups, but none of the candidates so far have released detailed plans that show their work (like, what’s the math/research showing *why/how* this plan will work?).
@BRandleTheatre I can’t speak for the msm. Anyone who reads my reporting knows I hold Republicans’ feet to the fire. I don’t know about you, but when I support something, I *really* wanna see a plan of action because I want it to work. Trump voters settled for a slogan. Do they have a wall? No.
@ZezeSwanson True, Trump did not come up with a plan to pay for a wall—and he doesn’t have a wall, now does he? Just a slogan. Why wouldn’t you wanna see a plan of action for policies you support?
Demanding that politicians have a plan of action for “Medicare for All” is necessary unless you want it to just be another “Build the Wall!”
It’s absurd to me how many people seem to think this is an unreasonable request. Like, don’t you want to see detailed plans of action for the policies you support?
@Airmit106 Maybe you should actually read some of my reporting at https://t.co/rQwNx6yvKW and you’d see why your statement is so off the mark.
@ZezeSwanson This is like a Dem equivalent of, “Yeah but what about her 33,000 emails and Uranium One?”
@BRandleTheatre Is Trump now the basis by which Democrats set their own standards?
@donneyjackson The wealthy paying their fair share is a slogan. What do the details of that look like? What’s the revenue? How much of a share is necessary to pay for M4A?
@braden_crimmins Except I dismissed nothing. I said they should offer details+math. Every policy Hillary Clinton introduced in 2016 included details &amp; math. She even chose not to introduce a policy she wanted–a universal basic income–because she couldn’t make the math work yet. Why lower the bar?
@NYCtoCincy @M_F_Ninja Hillary Clinton never proposed a policy in 2016 til she had details and math showing how she could make ‘em work. Are Dems gonna lower the bar for nominees in 2020?		Unless Democrats want “Medicare for All” to be just another “Build the Wall,” they should demand details.

This isn’t is to say Medicare for All is necessarily the solution. Switzerland has an effective &amp; affordable system that is a mix of private insurance, means-based subsidies, an individual mandate, &amp; strong regulation. 		But it’s an error to call private insurance “free market.”
“(There‘s no) reason the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life...the case for the state helping to organise a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.”	-Libertarian economist Friedrich Hayek		https://t.co/3Gj7lITbhP

If you’re incapacitated in a wreck &amp; an ambulance rushes you to an ER, you’re billed for services you never requested. You didn’t make a market decision &amp; send for an Über to earn that $2000 ambulance bill. That $30,000 ICU bill wasn’t for a fancy hotel you booked. Free market?
With private insurance, your decision to buy or not tangibly affects cost to others beyond ordinary demand/supply.		If you don’t buy, businesses/hospitals still have to treat you for free if you come to ER. Don’t pay &amp; those who have insurance have to subsidize it. Socialisty?

Sarah Palin did everything Donald Trump did—except backwards and in high heels. Republican voters decided she was too stupid to even be considered as a presidential candidate. Trump became president.		Identity politics benefits white men.
Even in 2019, identity politics *still* favors white men and works more against women and POC than it helps. That’s why racist, sexist dog whistles are still so potent. They work. Minority candidates embrace their identities to neutralize identity politics—not to get a leg up.
So let’s make sure, when we talk about identity politics in relation to presidential politics, we note the obvious: Identity politics was the formative action that excused mediocrity and put none but white men in the White House for 220 years.
Women, POC &amp; LGBT people have to fight from the bottom of the ladder—often with rungs knocked out—to earn power, compromising to win a game whose rules were written to make them fail.		None reached serious presidential potential based on “identity.” You’re thinking of white men.
Straight white men have controlled the levers of power for centuries thanks to identity politics weighed in their favor.		Sure, women, LGBT &amp; POC now feel emboldened say, “I’m proud of the diversity I bring”—but that does not mean they are succeeding based on those identities.
We in the media have got to stop going along with the narrative that presidential identity politics suddenly sprang up with Barack Obama &amp; Hillary Rodham‘s ascendence.		It didn’t. It’s just that white men started noticing it when they were no longer the default beneficiaries.
When white men push back on “identity politics” re: women &amp; POC and say we aren’t focused enough on ideas, that IS identity politics.		Do you think we elected the first 43 presidents based on their superior ideas, &amp; it’s just coincidence that they all happened to be white men?

@save1me1jebus He implied that such candidates and supporters exist, and he keeps invoking the existence of such people. He must think there are plenty of them on the Democratic side if he keeps feeling the need to stress this point.
@filosofella @KristianKeanna Not sure how that relates, but it‘s inaccurate to say that Bernie was “there in same-sex marriage” 20 years ago. He didn’t endorse it until 2009.

@daguz80 @Only4RM Pretty sure that’s the exact opposite of what this thread is saying. Which you’d know if you read it.

@plooger I didn’t say he did. Point is, you can see why so many Americans don’t realize how heavy her speeches were on policy because of what the media focused on instead. Bernie, on the other hand, went against her one on one—he knew what she focused on in her speeches.
@plooger The quote in the video clip is from late 2016. The one about people who are “big on diversity” is from 2 days ago.
@filosofella The false narrative is the suggestion that there are women, LGBT, and candidates of color who are running primarily on “identity politics” rather than policy. It’s just a non-existent issue that he keeps invoking whenever the topic of diversity comes up. Why?

RT @BakeUpLilSuzy: @ashtonpittman 1. Representation MATTERS. 2. This: https://t.co/hJiMcfR9JZ
@VonBlowseph Go back and the read the full thread please.
A thread about how, whether you're team #Bernie2020 or #NeverBernie—or not even a Democrat—it makes no sense to suggest that any of the women, people of color, or LGBT candidates running this year (or who ran in 2016 or 2008) skipped policy to run on, "I'm xxxx, vote for me!" https://t.co/pebLUJKq6e
So far, all the candidates seem to be running on policy. So again: Who is Bernie talking about when he mentions candidates/voters who are "big on diversity," but don't talk or think much about policy? I haven't found those candidates or voters. Not even in the #NeverBernie trend. https://t.co/XwFIEOizOU
I get that #Bernie2020 needs to find a way to argue that, despite the Dem base's craving for candidates who represents the party's diversity, they should vote for him bc of policy. But it's false to say non-straight white male candidates are running on, "I'm xxx, vote for me!" https://t.co/dCe5YcoZ64
I also doubt that any of the LGBTQ people excited about Peter Buttigieg's historic run would vote for, say... Caitlin Jenner. They probably aren't fans of the notorious villain from history, Roy Cohn, either. https://t.co/v8nJGv6Xvx
Another thing: Who are the voters Sen. Sanders alludes to who would vote for these candidates based only on their gender/LGBTQ identity/race? Sure, some Kamala Harris supporters say they want a WOC as president. I doubt any would vote for Condi Rice or Omarosa. https://t.co/P0As7eJwe2
While women, LGBT people, and POC don't feel they have to sweep their identities under the rug &amp; act like policy machines lacking in self-awareness, I'm not sure who the candidates are Bernie is talking about who are running solely on their race, gender, or LGBT identity. https://t.co/ze7n7TRW0O
Truth is, it's a new phenomenon for so many women/minority candidates for president to so freely talk about the diversity they bring to the table without worrying much about backlash. Barack Obama didn't talk about being black much in 2008 (though everyone else did). https://t.co/5ihVahrQ8Q
Bernie was not your average American consumer of politics in 2016—he was Clinton's rival. He was well aware of her policies and what she talked about. He knew she talked about her qualifications, her record, &amp; which policies she discussed. He knew it wasn't about being a woman. https://t.co/rsqtXX7o04
While some Democrats criticized Hillary Clinton for not talking enough about being a woman in 2008 (her most significant reference to her own historicity to "glass ceilings" in her concession), by 2016, Bernie Sanders was suggesting she ran on, "I'm a woman: Vote for me." https://t.co/StTavLVHVI
A 2015 CNN article celebrated the change in the calculus for female candidates for president between Hillary's 2008 run and her 2016 run: "THIS TIME, HILLARY WILL RUN AS A WOMAN," it proclaimed, noting that she "spent much of 2008 running away from the fact that she is a woman." https://t.co/uAcQwYOrfT
Irony of Bernie suggesting Hillary ran on "I'm a woman—vote for me" in 2016: In 08, she got the opposite criticism: She didn't talk about being a woman enough. Political wisdom then was that female candidates should emphasize masculine qualities—not remind people of their gender. https://t.co/60REdXL3j2
There is something pernicious about suggesting Hillary Clinton's 2016 message was: "I'm a woman, vote for me." Explicitly highlighting her gender with #ImWithHer was a big step. Female candidates in the past were expected to treat it like an elephant in the room. https://t.co/KfCFRYMGPS
Jobs, economy, workers, and college were the words Hillary Clinton used most in speeches, but what Americans heard about her in 2016 was quite different. Per Gallup, the most common words Americans heard related to her included: Email, lie, health, scandal, pneumonia. https://t.co/0kFAIdtNHN
Despite Bernie's suggestion that Hillary ran on being a woman &amp; not on policy (he refused to say "I'm With Her" in a campaign ad), a Vox analysis of her speeches found she spent relatively little time on identity politics.		The 3 most common words she used: Jobs, Economy, Worker. https://t.co/rlZEhukQ1K
Does he mean Peter Buttigieg? Yes, he does not hide the fact that he's a gay man, or that he has a husband. But he shouldn't have to. He is the millennial Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and he highlights policies that millennials care about:		https://t.co/cazfvT3iwE
Does he mean Elizabeth Warren? She supports many of the same policies he does, and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She recognizes the sexism of being judged on her "likability," but she has never said: "I'm a woman. Vote for me."		https://t.co/tsxBy4okQK
Does he mean Kirsten Gillibrand? Sure, she's upfront about the fact that she's a woman. She's big on #MeToo. She talks about being a mother.		But this ad doesn't say, "I'm a woman: Vote for me." It's about her record &amp; policies she supports:	https://t.co/fNk2HfHFpo
Who exactly, though, are the women, candidates of color, and, presumably, LGBT candidates Bernie Sanders is talking about when he suggests there are a lot of "diversity" candidates who are just running on their skin color, gender, or identity, and nothing else? https://t.co/UkOBu0JeQj
Weeks after the 2016 election, in the speech in the video above (h/t: @Only4RM), Bernie said: "It's not enough to say, I'm a woman: Vote for me"—implying that Hillary Clinton ran on her gender, rather than her policies. In the #NeverBernie trend, you see disdain at this comment. https://t.co/IFRFl31jEw
In a GQ article 2 days ago, Bernie tied some diverse candidates and their backers to tokenism: “There are people who are very big into diversity but whose views end up being not particularly sympathetic to working people, whether they’re white or black or Latino." #Bernie2020 https://t.co/mD28efwf2P
THREAD: Since 2016, Bernie Sanders has repeatedly suggested "diverse" candidates often run tokenism, not policy. For example:		"It is not good enough...to say I'm a Latina, vote for me...I have to know whether that Latina is going to stand up for the working class..." #Bernie2020 https://t.co/b1ubQ0G91F
”As soon as we start talking about some of the benefits and conditions medical marijuana could be used to treat, senior citizens’ ears perk up and they say, ‘Hold up, I know somebody who deals with that,’ or, ‘I deal with that.’”		https://t.co/TXNMKmroEU
Kamla &amp; #Bernie2020 will both have civil rights elements to their records to run on, &amp; both will have questionable moments to examine. It happens when you're in politics for decades. But the "black woman is a cop" vs "white man is a civil rights hero" framing is just ignorant.
By the time Hillary Clinton was going undercover in Alabama while working for the Children's Defense Fund to root out segregation academies, for example, Bernie Sanders' Civil Rights activism had long since dissipated. Kamala Harris was still quite young at the time.
And while some may try to cast Bernie Sanders as a major proponent of Civil Rights and Kamala Harris as a "cop," the truth is, Bernie's Civil Rights activism was short-lived.
Kamala Harris' criminal justice record is not all bad, either. For example, she pushed for reform to the bail money system—a big deal, since many poor people languish in jails because they can't afford bail, while the wealthy are able to bond out on rape and murder.
For example, Bernie Sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill. So did Joe Biden. So did members of the congressional black caucus. Bill Clinton signed it. Intentions were good. Still, it's been identified as one of the worst criminal justice reforms in modern history.
THREAD on this "black woman is a cop" vs. "white man is a civil rights hero" frame. True, @KamalaHarris was not active in the Civil Rights Movement—she wasn'td born until 1964—a year after MLK's "Dream" speech. Her criminal justice record needs examining. #Bernie2020's does, too. https://t.co/mSERFJ3WEI
The Mississippi bigotry is real. You can criticize one Mississippian without smearing all the good people here. @NerdGoneRogue_ agreed with @DustyGerald’s criticism of Petal, Miss. Mayor Hal Marx. And then, without realizing Dusty is also from Mississippi, wrote this to him: https://t.co/noR5R9v886

@LamarWhiteJr Well...
@DustyGerald We all know the court is too political. But if you’re a minority in America, you want justices on the court who believe civil rights and liberties extend to more than just straight, cisgender, white males.
@DustyGerald We‘re talking about transgender rights right now. I know you’d like to make this a “both sides do it” comvo, but if you’re transgender servicemember today, you look at this SCOTUS split and you see 5 non-Obama-appointed justices voting for a ban on your service to go forward.
@DustyGerald It is what it is. Republicans since the 90s have consistently chosen SCOTUS nominees who use conservative social views to inform their decisions on civil rights and civil liberties. Used not to be that way. Most liberal court in history was led by a GOP-appointed SCOTUS justice.
@brynstole @tannerdwatson ☝🏻
@brynstole Agreed—I’m thinking more of in the future, say a Republican beat her in 2020 and implemented one.

@terrie3056 @DonnerKay I get the impression that people who lump Farrakhan and Sharpton together have never bothered to compare the two men beyond the fact that they’re both black.
For the record, I have written, on multiple occasions, about Louis Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism, misogyny, homophobia, &amp; overall bigotry. But unless he is relevant, I’m not going to write him into a story about racist whites just so folks have a false illusion of balance.
The deflection never ends. Write about racism among whites? “What about Sharpton and Farrakhan?” Wrote about abuse in Christian communities? “What about Muslims?” So many in powerful majority populations prefer to deflect rather than reflect &amp; take responsibility. https://t.co/7727imDyNj

RT @ORgrannie: Important thread about journalism. The passionate pursuit of truth is what makes it so important. https://t.co/hT8bO9fhzq
And sometimes, it’s just to share something nice and hopeful about humanity. Because journalism should be about humanity and it should be fair, yet it shouldn’t be cold or detached.
My passion for journalism is fueled by a desire to shine a light on injustice; to build up &amp; defend democracy w accountability, truth and transparency; to uncover oppression &amp; disempower oppressors; to make the world a better place for kids born into poverty, bullied, or abused.
People like to know journalists are human, not just information robots. Because again, it builds trust. We have enough bots in our Twitter feeds and Facebook timelines. And we don’t trust them.
And I think it’s also important for journalists to share their own stories and not pretend to be detached from everything. Why do you care about the stories you report? What about your own stories fuels your zeal for truth? Show you are human to build trust.
You can make your values and passions clear as a journalist, while remaining fair. In the social media age, &amp; at a time when journalists are targeted as “fake news,” I think it’s important for journalists to remind people of who they are as people, their humanity, passions.
I think it’s an impoverished view of the role of journalism that says journalists must act like undecided robots about everything. That breeds distrust (bc who trusts robots?) That’s why I’m clear about where I stand on things like racism, LGBT rights, misogyny, etc.
On two occasions, I’ve had Tea Party groups tell me that my coverage of them was the fairest they’ve received of any local coverage...Even as left wingers read that same coverage and thought it validated their own views.
Paraphrasing, but it’s not rare for people from both sides of the aisle (&amp; especially Republicans) to tell me they trust journalists who take stands (even when they disagree with those stands) more than ones who always feign neutrality &amp; pretend everything is a big question mark.
A GOP campaign aide told me: “I respect and trust your reporting because because I know where you stand [he meant in terms of values, not partisanship]...if a reporter follows campaigns &amp; politics and doesn’t end up having beliefs or passions, I don’t know if I can trust them.”
@peskyspoll I agree with that. And thank you for following and admiring my work, even when we disagree.
@MayorHalMarx @DonnerKay Trying to define LGBT-supporting people out of Christianity is just as bad as trying to define anti-Trump conservatives out of conservatism. Those who are reflexively anti-Christian don’t like to acknowledge pro-LGBT or LGBT Christians, either.
@MayorHalMarx @DonnerKay Pastor Brandiilynne &amp; her wife, Susan, are on the left, &amp; they don’t try to discredit Christianity. That’s why they started a church in Hattiesburg for ones like them whose home churches rejected them. University Baptist Church in Hattiesburg also welcomes &amp; affirms LGBT people.
If BuzzFeed is right about the crux of its story, then either there is at least some small detail they got wrong or the SC isn’t telling the truth (unlikely). The SC statement was vague enough that there likely is at least *something* wrong in the story, if not the main gist. https://t.co/if1iVRViW3
@peskyspoll @thedailybeast Chuck Schumer had already been calling on Franken to resign behind the scenes. Why no blame for him? And why do all the male Dem senators who joined her get a pass?		And what of the 8 accusers? Do we just dismiss them? 		Franken didn’t mount a very strong defense.
@Shannon_Eubanks @janwat @DonnerKay To be clear: I went to public school for 8th grade, but had I stayed at the academy, I would’ve had the same teachers from 7th-12th. Teachers who were paid significantly less than public school teachers.
@Shannon_Eubanks @janwat @DonnerKay When I went to a private academy in 7th grade (until my parents’ were able to get me to a public school at the new house we were repairing), it did not even have a band. I had been in a 300-kid jr high band at my prior public school in 6th grade. No arts. Same teachers 7th-12th.

@MayorHalMarx @DonnerKay You may interpret criticisms of Christian institutions as people “having a problem with Christianity” itself, but that doesn’t make it so. Plenty of the people on the #ExposeChristianSchool trends &amp; the #Exvangelical movement remain Christians &amp; practice Christianity.
@MayorHalMarx @DonnerKay Plenty of people who are in the #Exxvangelical movement &amp; who are sharing their #ExposeChristianSchools stories ARE still Christians and DO have Christian beliefs &amp; values. You wrongly assume people who speak out about abuse in Christian schools left Christianity. Many didn’t.

@DonnerKay @MayorHalMarx I get the same thing when I *do* share stories of abuse in Islamic environments. “But what about the Christians why aren’t you talking about them?” 🤦🏻‍♂️ Deflecting rather than dealing with problems in our own communities is why these stories are still stories.
@MayorHalMarx If former Islamic students start a similar trend, I’ll gladly share that bc I believe in exposing religious abuse &amp; have never been opposed to doing so when the religion was one other than my own. But deflection isn’t going to convince me to make up stories for false balance.
