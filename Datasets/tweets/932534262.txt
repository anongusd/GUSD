@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren The U.K. is a parliamentary democracy. Scotland has its own parliament, and will soon vote for independence again. The Hanoverians on the throne are just very wealthy figureheads. No actual authority or power anymore.
@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren Same with the NHS. That‚Äôs among the reasons for the Scots  are vying for independence. Westminster has been stealing all the oil revenues from Scottish North Sea oil fields, too.
@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren Your missing the fact that there are many universities in the U.K. that are tuition free. And England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland actually all have differing systems. The English have been eat up with privatization for some years now. Rich gettin richer, etc etc etc.

If they pay what they paid in the 50s and 60s, they‚Äôll still be richer than everybody else on the planet. And we‚Äôd have the country our forefathers fought for. Don‚Äôt ya think?
@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren Surely you see the reasoning behind this, right? Our ancestors built churches and schools and courthouses and hospitals and parks and reservoirs and roads and bridges and communication infrastructure to serve the public. Not to serve as profit centers for the wealthy.
@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren Many hands make light work. Remember that adage? And your insurance worked on the same principle. Everybody else paid for your surgery, and in turn, you helped take care of others. Only the company rips off all of you by reducing coverages and raising member contributions. So..
@TimMcG4 @lacedtight @linux_and @ewarren And I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre willing to help pay for fire trucks, because someday your house might catch fire, but, unless your in a big city or suburban area, your likely to have few or no volunteers, cause they‚Äôre too busy workin multiple jobs, so....
