My biggest challenge in business was not my competition. It was the tape inside my head keeping me back.
When things don’t go as planned, you need to label discouragement as self-pity. And once you do that, you declare it the enemy. Check out my full interview with @vinazine here: https://t.co/xjxps3OFpU

You can’t avoid failure. The trick is getting back up fast before you have time to feel sorry for yourself. #MotivationMonday
Everybody has a great idea because ideas are easy. It’s running with the idea and staying with it that’s hard.

Great entrepreneurs always delivers more than expected.
I’m pretty good at change. I don't spend time fighting the past so that I can spend my time building my future.
Once I realized I might be far more capable than I thought I was, everything got easy.
I never have never enough time, yet when when I want more time, I always make it.
Negative people see a problem in every opportunity and positive people see opportunity in every problem.
It’s never too late to become what you might have been.
I've been afraid my whole life. But I've learned it's easier and better to blast through it than to spend my life with regrets.
I don't know a single person who got rich by just saving their money.

Podcast listeners, tell me what you think! Do you like longer interview episodes (30+ minutes) or quick tips (8 minutes)? Tell me why below...
Opportunity is not what you think it is. It doesn't sparkle, it isn't loud, and it's almost always found on the flip side of failure.
I try to stay positive, not about the outcome, but about knowing I'll survive whether things do or don't work out.
@MitchKominsky I loved chatting with @guyraz, it's a great episode! If you want more like that, check out my podcast as well, called Business Unusual.

Failure is the mother of everything.

You can take all the time you need getting there as long as you just keep going.
Most of life is not about what happens to you, but how you chose to respond.
All of us are more capable than we think, but you don't find out how capable you are until you throw yourself at something that seems too big to get through.
The best way I know to built your courage and confidence is by getting through adversity.
Feeling rich has nothing to do with what you've got. It's just feeling you want very little.
Don't ever think yourself too old to try something you really want. It took me 8 years to have my first child at 46.
The harder I work, the luckier I get.
@michaelstrahan @GMA heard you're offering lobster to the fabulous @ClemsonFB team. I know the perfect guys to help with that @cousinsmainelob – what do you think?
Hardships prepare you well to accomplish amazing things.
In the end, people regret the things they haven't done, not the things they tried at and failed.
Here’s what 1 facelift, a gifted makeup artist, a new colorist, and a new stylist gets you...TEN YEARS! #10YearChallenge #AgeChallenge  https://t.co/RBPSV8NpAY
@IDEABUYERcom @OnDeckCapital The beauty of social media is you can grow a following w/o delivering any product. Create a buzz around your product &amp; come up with a gimmick to get attention. Post something catchy &amp; get ppl talking. If your product is any good, they’ll be lining up to get it when it's ready.
@jimdebetta I don’t feel I have the right to take anyone’s dream away/discourage from trying. But it’s almost mean send them down a road you don’t think will yield results, so I also feel the obligation to speak the truth. It’s not what you say, but that you say it/how you say it that counts
@SHOTGUN999999 Pay attn to what you get done in the early AM vs when everybody else is hard at work. I was always at my desk an hr before everybody else &amp; got more done than I could in the next 6 hours. Try going to work an hr early every day for 2 weeks &amp; you'll want to do it for a lifetime!
@AaronWayCasteel There are rich people who are greedy &amp; poor people who are cheap. But the most successful “wealthy” people I’ve met in life weren't greedy at all &amp; earned every $ in their pocket. You can’t build a big success if you’re greedy b/c you have to lead people to make a success happen.
@mvillafan It's common to hit plateaus. Like walking up a flight of steps w/ your shoe caught in the riser. You can see the next step, but you’re pushing so hard to get there you can’t move your foot. Hire somebody to help you, to push you so you have to move onwards and upwards.
@Ceo_Branding Being a great ent &amp; a great parent is tough. I've found that kids get in the way of focus, energy, time &amp; task. I couldn't have built my biz if I had my children earlier. With kids, you can only throw 50% of yourself at your biz, so find another 50% to help build the business.
@q50andbeyond You sound like you might be disappointed on some level, like your hard work is not paying off? Maybe it’s time to regroup. I would suggest making a list of everything you like &amp; don't like about your job, and find a way to do more of the things you like/less you don't.
@tokyougirl2020 When you’re made fun of as a kid &amp; have no way to defend yourself, it's a blow to your confidence. But here comes the good news: when you grow up, you’re bigger &amp; more able to see a bully as a bully &amp; you have an equally big mouth to call someone out when they’re out of line.
@TheDavidShoup Most critical phase is getting it started. I meet people daily with ideas they’re very excited about vs only 1 person who actually starts. Once you get it going the 2nd step is to see if people will pay for it! Many failed ents I’ve met got done &amp; found out that no one would buy.
@InzaneWorld It's tough process! But I’ve always seen setbacks as a wakeup call. Chance to make abrupt change. It's painful in the moment b/c you’ve lost the control, but it looks like the best thing that happened when you look back. Good pause for thought and a chance to change direction.
@Surajkudachi You don't need a business plan to get off the ground! I always say, you don't have to get it right, you just have to get it going. Find out if there's a customer willing to pay for your product or service and hit the ground running.
@WorldOfEyome There are a few things I can't survive w/o. A 2 min hot bath every morning/night is a great trick for ridding myself of the day &amp; starting the next day fresh. Today the most stress comes thru cell phones. Putting down my phone to actually live life gets rid of a lot of stress.
@themoneyjourna1 I’d have to know what kind of business you’re planning to start here to give you any specific suggestions. But if you do have a specific business idea in mind, you should Google it, as you can readily find what kind of groups meet to discuss that kind of business.
@CyclopzSamurai @OnDeckCapital The difference between the 2 is intent. Are they saying that to really help w/ something you can actually change? Or is it a comment meant to say what’s wrong w/ you or what you're doing? As adults we often overcomplicate other’s comments.
If you're going to succeed in business, you'll need a partner to help you get there. I talk about why that's the case on today's new episode of #BusinessUnusual. Listen here: https://t.co/wAoX6b5V6j Presented by @OnDeckCapital. Visit https://t.co/g5nOUDiyvy to learn more.

I try not to resent. Nelson Mandela said it best: “Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and waiting for your enemy to die.”

The best business partners have opposite strengths. I chose my partner because she was brilliant where I was terrible. Together we built a huge business.
Funny thing. Positive, effective people seem to always hang out with positive, effective people.
Most wildly successful entrepreneurs are simply getting over an early adversity in life.
Business is a contact sport, and if you’re afraid of getting hurt, you can’t play to win.
I couldn’t have accomplished a single thing worthwhile without the right people. First there was my mother, then my partner, then my whole smart team. After that, things got easy.
@stocking_u I meant more that when you focus entirely on making a success &amp; working your buns off you don't recognize the progress you make along the way b/c you don’t have time. When you finally have outside proof you built a big success, you’re rather surprised that you got there!
@letsgoyark @WIMPIAMAPPAREL You definitely need the help! And you better get someone fast who can communicate clearly what your business is to the average Joe. If your vision is impossible for someone else to understand or share on your behalf, then your business won’t fly without a partner.
@PeterMcLeanRE4U W/ rentals, you get more tries up at bat to make your customer happy than w/ sales. There are typically a lot more rental deals to be had in most markets than places to sell. Don’t let go of your rental business because it pays often and pays fast.
@carrie_glaude Good for you to get this far! You’ve just made the same mistake most new  entrepenerus make: blowing all your cash on getting started/getting a patent. See if someone will write you a check for a preorder - if not you really don’t have a product that will sell &amp; need to rework it
@redearthvet @letsgoyark There’s always someone - look hard! Find part-time employees - moms w/ spare time while the kids are @ school, students after class, retired people looking for something to do. Fluctuate hours &amp; wages based on what you can afford, they’re more flexible than the average worker.
@letsgoyark @sharonlew The key to any business is selling. Keep your eye on that ball. Selling your client &amp; selling the person to hire your client brings in the $. Delegate everything else if you can accept it at 80% as well as you do. List all that's not direct sales. Get rid of it, it’s in your way.
@Rachael23878599 @OnDeckCapital Invent a way to stand apart from the pack. Find a gimmick that draws attn from the community &amp; local papers. Use your imagination. Ex. the co-op boards started asking to meet pets w/ new buyers, so I taught dogs how to shake hands w/ board members &amp; behave properly! Press loved.
@FindLVCannabis @OnDeckCapital I woulnd’t be afraid of negative reaction, because I’ve learned over the years in business that for a young business, even a negative review builds the business. Take advantage of the controversy that’s out there. Not every type of business can do that.
@FindLVCannabis @OnDeckCapital Stigmas are great for business. It attracts opinion/press. People picketing in front of your dispensary will make the local papers &amp; put you on the map. Or commission a survey as to how the community thinks about the dispensary for facts &amp; % that you can send to the press.
@ImmanuelProdGRP @OnDeckCapital The rule is usually that you need to pay all expenses/employees before yourself. New business owners who don’t pay themselves anything &amp; spend every penny wisely b/c they’re short on cash do well. It's like a baby that needs coddling while I forget about my own needs for a while.
I’m a greedy son of a gun. Every time we accomplished something good, I couldn’t figure out why we shouldn’t go for great.
Most of my successful entrepreneurs have low IQs. When you smash them on the head they pop back up. They don’t even think to lay low.

I work hard and can tell you that all the money, all the planning, and all the dreaming you can do is no substitute for the sheer persistence and hard work it takes to get you there.

I’ve always appreciated that my success was half me and half potluck. The luck was the fun part!
You have to be crazy to think you can change the world. And there have been quite a few crazies out there to prove it.
I over-prepare for everything I do. I’m too scared to get there and let people know I’m stupid.
You’ll need courage to take a leap of faith because it’s never the right time to try something. But once you jump, life has a way of keeping you up.
Good bosses work for their employees. When I started my business, I felt it was my child. As I built it, I did everything in my power to spoil my children.
I’ll try anything I can visualize that might have a shot at working. And that keeps me too busy to count my mistakes.
Nothing really good happens unless you surround yourself with good people. Good people make good things happen.

Once you’ve had a good run, it’s easy to think you’re a big shot. You’ve got to remember you can lose your business as quickly as you’ve earned it.

@oscam33 When I'm hiring people, I don't look much at the resume. I ask them about their family and see how they respond. I figure if their parents couldn't give them a positive attitude in 18 years, there's no chance I could turn them around.
All good entrepreneurs ask a lot of questions but really don’t listen. They rely on themselves to make every right decision.

Think every winning entrepreneur has a fancy degree hanging on the wall? Not so fast! Listen to this week's #BusinessUnusual for tips on using your streets smarts to get ahead. https://t.co/Dx4I4oXASx https://t.co/Xr9BQa7aVu
I’m always better off facing my fears and forcing myself to do what I’m scared of. It’s a sure shot way to build confidence.
People who ask for raises always get paid the most. If you want to get a raise you better learn to ask.
Every superstar is willing to take a leap of faith. They’re naturally comfortable with risk.
My must-have item as the days get colder? @OriginalComfy of course. My Season 9 Shark Tank investment is on @QVC and you’re not going to want to miss this deal. They even let me pick out my own color that I don’t plan on taking off!  https://t.co/EC8dRf34OT https://t.co/xQzY2lTSW7
I built a big brand and put my name on it. And when it came time to sell, they paid more for my brand than they did for my business. Branding is everything.
Which do you think matters most in business: book smarts or street smarts? Listen to this week's #BusinessUnusual to find out what I think. https://t.co/2fAZ6SGnTt
I picked out an all new color for @OriginalComfy, what do you think? Grab one on @QVC tomorrow, I have a feeling this one's going to go fast! https://t.co/ErNKMhzmiF
You don’t need to be everything to succeed in business. You just need to be smart enough to hire people who have what you don’t got.
Most people think good negotiation is simply reaching an agreement on price, but it’s never that easy. The key to good negotiation is keeping the romance alive and both parties thinking they’ve won.

It’s never too late to reinvent yourself and start again. You can’t change your wiring, but you can repackage it.
I really believe in the equality of duties in marriage. I do 100% of everything, and my husband does 100% of nothing.
Melissa from @GraceandLaceCo is live NOW showing you how to wear their terrific new reversible vest. It's the next best thing to having her in my closet each morning! https://t.co/3eGuAApK4x
Got an Android? Here's how you can listen to #BusinessUnusual! https://t.co/htAP81nAub
@ScottCrab I spent 1/3 of my time planning fun for my employees. Not the usual fancy Xmas party, but bizarre dances &amp; too much alcohol &amp; lots of surprises. Every event has a gimmick to surprise and delight. In return you get loyal employees who recruit other great souls into your biz.
@JohnKel71235949 Look for the person in a social setting who's always smiling and engaging other people in conversation. Look for high energy, go-getters always have lots of energy because they feed on their own enthusiasm for life.
@jeremyizhere Hire your opposite w traits you wish you had. 2 kinds of people at work: expanders &amp; containers. Expanders push the biz forward &amp; containers keep it in check. Successful businesses need both. Know what you do well &amp; choose a partner w opposite skills to help build your business.
@mikrobx That's a tough one! Sit down &amp; list categories of work handed to you &amp; how much time each takes. Go to your supervisor &amp; ask for their priorities b/c you can’t manage it all. You need paperwork so they know you're not complaining, but responsibly want to focus on what’s important
@ZurSells I ask about family b/c I want to identify a happy person &amp; that's something you only learn from family. Happy people make great workers &amp; team players. The way I see it, if a their family couldn’t teach them positivity by 18, there’s nothing I could do as a boss to change that.
@JoRu89 All the money and all the planning and all the dream you can do is no substitute for real live customer who is willing to give you the cash. That’s where every person should get started.
@thornegreen @ABCSharkTank It takes a lot of courage, but once you can scratch out enough $ from it to cover your very bare essentials, it's time! There's something in the universe that rallies to the brave of heart &amp; takes care of you. Your business will answer to that call once you're 100% committed.
There’s no such thing as work-life balance. The best I do is separate my life into chunks stay hyper-focused on each one at a time.
Saving up for that fancy degree before launching your business? Forget it! On this week's #BusinessUnusual, I'll share the street smarts that get my most successful entrepreneurs to the finish line. https://t.co/Dx4I4oXASx
The most valuable employee is the one that takes stress off their boss's plate. #NationalBossDay

RT @TheSharkDaymond: If you let broke beat you down, if you let it break you, you’ll never find a way to thrive or even survive.
If you have a question about how to build more camaraderie at the office, how to not lose to your competitor, or just plain how to get a raise, ask me here and I just might feature it on #BusinessUnusual.
There's nothing more exciting than hanging out with someone who dreams big and is willing to work very hard to get there. Success is contagious.
On the latest #BusinessUnusual, I caught up with @ilovedaisycakes to chat about how she went from selling her first cake at just 10 years old to building her cake empire! You won't want to miss this special extended episode. https://t.co/9Ve1QRLQFu
RT @bobbirebell: Have you ever spent money you didn't have- and then that motivated you to earn the money asap. It worked for @BarbaraCorco…
The real competition in business is not the next guy. It's the voice inside your head that tells you you can’t.
@mcuban you're my hero! #SanaiaAppleSauce #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I know many successful entrepreneurs who built their business as a side hustle. Not everyone can walk away from their stable salary. #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
It's Season 10, there's no holding back anymore. #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I'd definitely pick up #SanaiaAppleSauce at the store. But for this deal to be worthwhile for me, I'm going to need a big bite. #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Which packaging do you like better? #SanaiaAppleSauce #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Wait, what?! Where did that number come from? #SanaiaAppleSauce #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Sounds delicious, tell me more! #SanaiaAppleSauce #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Did anyone notice @kevinolearytv kept his tatas on for the entire pitch? @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Hey Mark, let her finish! Erin needs to be happy with the deal for it to work out. @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Do you think Erin should take Lori's 50-50 offer?
As a Shark, I like to know that my entrepreneurs are in it for the long run, not just that one viral bump. @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Wait a minute…these numbers are going a little off track. @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
@kevinolearytv the girls look great on you! @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I must admit, this product doesn't cater to me. @tatatowel #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
"Like your girls are on vacation," that's a good one! @tatatowel #SharkTank  @ABCSharkTank
@CB_Fulmer @LugBugHandle @ABCSharkTank If you take the time to get a patent before you know you've got interested customers, you'll waste a lot of money protecting something people might not buy. Once you know there's a need, then a patent can come in handy.
You've got to prove you have customers before it's worthwhile to spend time and money on a patent. @LugBugHandle #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I love a good salesman, but good judgement is important too. I'm not so sure Nathan's got it. And for that reason, I'm out. @LugBugHandle #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Wow. He's put a lot of his savings into this. @LugBugHandle #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Patents are nice, but I want to hear the sales. @LugBugHandle #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Hello Hudson, hello Haven! #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Have you been working out, @robertherjavec? @LugBugHandle #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I wonder what little Max would look like in one of those? @ShedDefender #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank https://t.co/gM4kbCLwGW
Hey @kevinolearytv, how do you say "Barbara's my favorite shark" in dog? @ShedDefender #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
More SKUs does not equal more sales. These guys need to hone in on their top sellers. @ShedDefender #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
It's great to have a proven customer, but I like to know what you plan to DO with those customers to reach your goal. @ShedDefender #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
WOW those are some sales! @ShedDefender #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
New #SharkTank starts NOW on ABC! RT if you're watching with me!

Every great entrepreneur is wired the same way. They're aggressive, competitive, and they get people to follow them.
My good friend Don Reis needs a kidney to live. I’m praying for a miracle, and he needs an angel with a B or O blood type. If you’d like more information on donating a kidney, visit https://t.co/wqmbQ3pG5j. If you’d like to reach out to Don, email kidneyfordonreis@gmail.com. https://t.co/JZ88ixX58j
Some of the worst entrepreneurs on Shark Tank have the best credentials. They often come from right schools and have fancy degrees. I put my money on the really street smart people who can think fast on their feet, because those are the people who make me a lot of money.
@cousinsmainelob in New York City, what could be better? https://t.co/MnzEP3wbXR
The secret to delegating is to delegate! My best trick was to leave for frequent vacations and tell everybody not to bother me. People rose to the occasion, learned to make decisions themselves, and I got the powerful management team I wanted.
It’s stupid to sit around thinking about what you should do next. If you go outside and get moving, all the good ideas will find you.
Don’t assume what motivates you motivates next guy. Everyone’s different. If you can spot what floats someone’s boat and tap into it, you’ll have a very well motivated employee.
@JuliaNotaryOH I had 22 bosses before I started my company &amp; only 3 of them were eager to move me forward. The rest were obstructionists. You can take a shot at meeting with your boss about concerns, but chances are if you want to move ahead you’ll have to move on and get yourself a good boss.
@Ceo_Branding I realized years ago that if they couldn’t learn to be positive by age 18, there’s nothing we could do to make them turn their attitude around. You’re far better off surrounding yourself with positive people to begin with, as there’s nothing you can’t accomplish as a team.
@AKA_KEVIN_ALEX You won’t be naïve for long! Everyone starts out fearless in business because they haven’t been slapped around by reality. After you get through your first 3 giant obstacles, you’ll find you’ll replace fearlessness with resilience, or you won’t be around long in business.
@Joelbtweeting It depends on your energy. I have more energy at 69 than most people have at 29, and it doesn’t seem to be running out. I plan on starting my next business on my 80th birthday. 50 is likely not too late.
@stephre4u I started by renting apartments, not selling, because I could get commissions within the week. My advice? Keep focusing on hooking people in so you get customers to work with &amp; make sure you’re spending 80% of your time in the street showing apartments vs behind the desk.
@raheja_hitesh Get yourself a pair of earphones! If you can't wear large headsets at work, slip in little AirPods &amp; listen to something keep you positive, like my podcast! You’ll waste valuable time &amp; energy trying to change people who’d rather gossip. You’re better off buffering yourself.
@Nastenka3715 Progress in the workplace is a result of good motivation + clear deadlines. Delays are a result of the opposite. Be clear on the action steps you want &amp; make them excited about getting there. Most people are motivated just by accomplishing something, it feels good to get it done.
@thehometeamNYC There’s nothing you can do to make them happy if they're constantly complaining. Make an appointment, cite the complaint &amp; ask what you can do about it. In short, you want to ask how you can make them happier. If that doesn’t work, time to look for a new boss.
I never worried about money. If I used my thoughts to worry about money, I’d have no time to think of the next great idea that would be sure to make money.
I never look at the resume when I'm hiring. It gets in the way of getting to know someone. And besides, you never know who wrote it!
When I’m overwhelmed with more than I can handle, I simply make a list of what’s at hand and ask, “What brings me joy?” Then I get rid of everything that doesn’t.
The key to getting through tough times is to believe against all odds that you’ll find a way to get to the finish line. There’s something in the universe that rallies around you when you throw yourself at the problem 150%.
Modern parents have a lot to juggle, but the SitAlong Toddler Luggage Seat from https://t.co/TjX5ER85iQ makes traveling with kids a breeze. I'm giving one away to one lucky winner – RT to win! Contest ends Tues Oct. 16th. https://t.co/xr9YLAF2Gx
When you start your business, every dollar is precious. It’s a waste to spend money on a patent before you find out how many people are willing to buy it.
In school, I was labeled the dumb kid just because I couldn't learn to read. But in business I'm judged by what I can do!
You can’t reverse a failure, but you can stay in the game and not feel sorry for yourself. Sooner or later you’ll get a good card.

$20 for a straw? Sounds expensive to me... #finalstraw #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank

We've got a mermaid in the tank! #finalstraw #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Who's offer would you take? #leglue #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Some of the best entrepreneurs don't start with a passion. They simply recognize a problem and create a good solution, just like Trip. #leglue #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
I love seeing young entrepreneurs enter the tank! #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
@newcreationron If the product has a line of hungry customers, I'm interested.
That's quite the deal @LoriGreiner! Season 10 off to a roaring start. #SharkTank @ABCSharkTank
Patents mean very little until you've gone out and proven the customer will buy your product. #SharkTank

Attitude gets you a lot farther than experience. It’s what gets you through the bad times as experience tells you to quit.
You don't have to get it right, you just have to get it going.
How do you pitch a Shark? We shared our best tips with @VanityFair, watch here: https://t.co/DmXmmoKV2K
It’s never too late to start a business. Youth has the advantage of optimism while age has wisdom.
Your worst enemy is yourself. I’ve worked hard to replace my thoughts with, “Barbara, you’re f-ing amazing!”
I'm LOVING this giant fashion release from @GraceandLaceCo! Melissa does live Q&amp;A's to help you style it too. Which of these styles is your favorite? What should I order? https://t.co/xsRxp2tPGe https://t.co/55ZXCrbS43
If you feel burnt out, nothing will change while sitting at your desk. If you take a day off and go play outside, you’ll come back with good solutions to getting un-stuck.
Every great entrepreneur has a crystal clear picture of who they want to be. It’s more powerful than a business plan and a lot easier to follow.
What would you want in a $150 million dollar home? I chatted about this extraordinary property with @followconcierge and @cheddar – tune in for my favorite feature! https://t.co/tLLMe62yHA
Nothing worthwhile comes easily. I always expect opposition, but keep enough optimism to barrel through.
Everybody has something they excel at. You need to figure out what yours is and build a life around it.
I know a thing or two about the romance of a good negotiation. Listen here for my best tips #BusinessUnusual https://t.co/PMB6S6c7qT
The most important quality in an entrepreneur is their ability to get knocked down and be stupid enough to get back up.
I'd rather have one hard working passionate person by my side than an army of people who are just showing up.
Fun is the most underutilized tool in business today. Happy people always make good employees.
@VasimSayyed3 Many of the best entrepreneurs start their businesses on the side. Get a partner to help out with half the work - 2 halves make a whole! Set a deadline for quitting your job once you've built up your side gig.
@AFWhope That's terrific Angelica! No doubt you will succeed. I had all my best successes on the heels of my biggest failures. It's just a matter of your ability to bounce back.
All my best successes came on the heels of failure.
The big challenge in business is not the competition, it's what goes on inside your head.
Lobsters are a Shark’s best friend! https://t.co/J0RMNDBgyD
Lots of fun at the @Tribeca festival Sunday night! https://t.co/sRlN4e7WNu
Selling is nothing more than playing up the positives and shrinking any negative.
There's great power in an insult. You can use it to prove the world wrong.
Preparation is underrated. I over-prepare for everything I do.
In business, you need to create a sense of demand, not wait for demand.
It took me 20 years to kill that little voice that said "You can't do it!" Replacing that self tape set me free.
RT @GMA: TOMORROW: @GMA swims with @ABCSharkTank! Share your pitches with us! 🦈🦈🦈 @BarbaraCorcoran @TheSharkDaymond @LoriGreiner⁩ @kevinole…
Worse than not being taken seriously was being dismissed by the men I competed against when I was starting out. 	I learned that I had to get my own attitude on straight, and then I went out to prove them wrong. https://t.co/XpvAnJjLDV

Every great entrepreneur is wired the same way. They're aggressive, competitive, and they get people to follow them.
I started my business when I was young when I had nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up.
I already ❤️ @bflay because he’s a New Yorker like me. I love him even MORE because he’s having my favorite cousin @sabinlomac on his show.  Watch tonight on @foodnetwork at 10 p.m. I know I will!  #BeatBobbyFlay https://t.co/uWba7lQOZs
I knew that if I was going to succeed, I'd have to work twice as hard as the next guy to get there.
Ignorance is a wonderful thing when you're starting a business because you don't know what to be afraid of.
The real challenge in business is never the competition. It's what goes on inside your head that always defeats you.
If you can't sell your idea, you won't be in business very long.
If you have real knowledge, you have a shortcut to earning the customer's trust.
To build a great business, you have to be able to sell your idea. Passion is just not enough.
People smarts are 10 times more valuable than book smarts. I was the dumb kid in school but I'm a great entrepreneur.
1 negative person on a team of 20 happy people brings the energy of the whole team down.
Good business partners have opposite strengths. That's what creates synergy and ultimately a big business.
Have you heard the latest #BusinessUnusual yet? Catch up here: https://t.co/xWwLjd1j4Q
We all do well at what we really love! If you want to succeed, you'd better find something you love.
The most powerful way to build any relationship is to make someone feel valued by really listening.
I stay away from negative people. They kill any creative spark I might have and take away my energy.
If you can’t stand your supervisor but love the company you’re with, tell me about it, and I’ll tell you how to fix it. #BusinessUnusual
We are all slow to learn that we are far more capable than we think we are.
If you're not wired for taking risks, you won't build a big business. Business is all about taking risks.
I've been reading Roald Dahl's stories to my daughter Kate since she was 3. She has a hard time sitting still for anything, but she settled right in and fell in love with literature because of him. #RoaldDahlDay
Don't waste time getting fancy. Everyone responds well to people who are themselves- just be yourself.
I was motivated to make a name for myself because I didn't want to work for a boss.
New episode of #BusinessUnusual! See what unusual advice I'm offering up this week... https://t.co/xWwLjd1j4Q
I walked past the small red firehouse on East 85th Street yesterday and shuddered with the memory of seeing that firehouse covered with 8 flower wreaths representing the the firemen who had died just the day before 17 years ago. Taking time today to remember the victims.
September 11 is the nation’s largest day of charitable service. Together, we’re turning a day of tragedy into a day of doing good. Join in at: https://t.co/YeIInEPF8A #911day
Everyone remembers 9/11, a day of enormous loss and utter disbelief.  I still meet New Yorkers in the neighborhood who lost a father, mother, son or daughter, and I can’t imagine how they found the courage to move past such a personal loss.
You don't need an MBA to launch a business. What you need is street smarts and a lot of grit.
The big guy may have the corner on money but the little guy has the corner on creativity and can move faster.
Great entrepreneurs are risk takers and salespeople at heart.
If you want to get ahead, you have to be willing to flop a lot.
My dad never liked any boss he ever had. He should have been an entrepreneur, but he had 10 kids to feed. 8 of his 10 kids grew up to be entrepreneurs.
Right-brainer struggling to organize a business plan? I've got some advice for you! Listen to this week's episode of #BusinessUnusual for more. https://t.co/kxKVCRMLna
Success is contagious. There's nothing more exciting than being with someone who dreams big and is working hard on getting there!
You have to know what market you're selling in. In a buyer's market, the buyer's right. In a seller's market, the seller's right.
Just 30 more days until the premiere of @ABCSharkTank Season 10! What are you looking forward to most?
Think you have a disadvantage because you’re the smallest company in your field? Tell me what you're struggling with, and I’ll show you how to take advantage of your size. #BusinessUnusual
Stop comparing yourself to everybody else. If you're busy minding their business, who's minding yours?
RT @TheSharkDaymond: My friend @BarbaraCorcoran's got the right idea for #ReadABookDay. What book are you reading? https://t.co/tS9QoiNBsQ
If you waste time feeling sorry for yourself, you're never going to make it.
You can't motivate people with money alone, you need to make them happy.
You might think hiring the right people is the key to success, but firing the wrong ones is just as important. Listen to #BusinessUnusual to find out why! https://t.co/4qroPeO6l2
I used to hate feeling embarrassed, but then I realized nobody's watching and nobody gives a damn!
Every time I listen to my gut I make money. Every time I don't, I lose it.
@TonyMon23970487 I answer as many as I can! Tweet me your questions and I just might feature it on my podcast, Business Unusual with Barbara Corcoran as well.
@AdrianaMedina88 It’s an absolute waste of time and money to patent anything before you test your product by seeing if anyone will be willing to buy it! The time to make the attorneys rich is once customers are buying it and you know you have a hit.
@TomLShields Year 2 of any business is tough. The key to getting thru tough times building a business is to believe against all odds that you’ll find a way. Stay focused on getting to the finish line. Something in the universe hears your battle cry when you throw yourself 150% at a problem.
@doctorgbrar Make plans with a friend for some physical exercise. Once you're in motion it's easier to create motion. Then sit down with a pen and paper and write down all the things you like and dislike doing. Your new path will present itself, and it's sure to be something you enjoy doing.
@FuzeSNgcobo It's not a good idea to announce in advance, but you should test your premise. Try putting them in a leadership position &amp; go away for a few weeks. See what they do running the business while you're away &amp; if people like reporting to them. Get feedback on to how well they did.
@feelngroovee Make yourself a prototype &amp; if you can’t afford that make a really good 3D drawing. Take it out to get feedback from people who would actually buy it. Not all ideas are great when you actually test them in the marketplace - so it’s smart to test before you invest a lot of time.
I look for the same traits in every entrepreneur I choose- character, enthusiasm, and genuine sense of thankfulness.
My grandfather and his 5 brothers were immigrant dockworkers in NYC. He told us that Labor Day was THE most important day of the year, because that was the day his brothers and he were not invisible. He said that was the day they marched as proud Americans. https://t.co/RyUSB4IRSF

The best time to take a risk is the moment you think about it, because if you sit &amp; analyze it, you'll always conclude it's a stupid idea.
I'd rather have one passionate person by my side than an army of people who are just involved.

The most valuable employee is the one that takes stress off their boss's plate.
The person you work for has more to do with your happiness than what you do for a living.
Whenever I feel stuck, I go outside. I've never had a good idea sitting at my desk.
Be very proud of when you fail. If you do enough of it, it's proof you'll be successful!
In sales, when you're nice, people like you. When people like you, they're willing to entertain your idea.

I worked for 22 bosses before I started my own business. I liked the jobs, but I never liked having a boss.
Even today, it can be a struggle for women to make it to the top of the heap in business. I built a huge empire with women when everyone else in the game a man, and you know what my secret… https://t.co/15SN2tDVWr
All the best things that happened to me, happened after I was rejected. But I just kept swinging to even the score.
You can't waste time feeling sorry for yourself when things don't go as planned. If I had done that I would have never become successful.
I'll take a shot at anything if I can visualize it and see that it has a chance of working. And that keeps me too busy to count what ain't working.
If you think you’re missing new opportunity and don’t know how to find it, maybe I can help. Ask me here! #BusinessUnusual

It's very normal to get stuck, everybody does! But it's stupid to stay stuck.
The best reason for going for it is you won't live to regret it.
I love written to-do lists. The delete button never gives me the satisfaction that crossing off a task does.
@RickSkewes (2/2) If you haven't been invited in for interviews than your resume likely needs to be improved. Have a good friend read it thru and suggest how to improve it. Resumes are like curb appeal, they should invite the employer in.
@RickSkewes (1/2) Without the details, its hard for me to advise what's going wrong. Check your interview skills, your resume and your social media profiles. If you’re going out for interviews but haven’t gotten any job offers, then you probably need to practice how to interview.

@if_luc You'll need extreme optimism to begin the pursuit of anything great. But as nothing worthwhile ever comes easily, you'll also need to expect a good deal of opposition but still have the optimism to barrel through.
@casarikie Teach yourself to propose new ideas in a language she respects and understands. Learn to present your idea logically and with brevity in outline form. Present the problem or challenge and show the steps that logically leads to your desired conclusion.
@okemoney86 (2/2) One week later when I sent the list of secret addresses, we sold all 88 apt in 1 hour flat because just as I expected, curiosity had the salespeople all bringing many customers. My company averted bankruptcy, and we made $1.3 million with the apartments all snapped up!
@okemoney86 (1/2) During a real estate recession I thought I’d go out of business. I took unwanted NYC apts that couldn’t be sold, priced them at one price, and held a secret apt sale. I told my sales staff to each bring one customer each for the best apt of the lot if they came early.
@casmholmes You don't wait! You push and push like you know something is sure to be right around the corner and stay alert enough to spot the hint of the new opportunity sure to come. And then you take advantage of it and make it happen.
If it bugs you to work for someone, chances are good you should be an entrepreneur.
When I built my business, I felt it was my child, an extension of my body, my soul, and my mind.

Procrastination is the quiet enemy of success.
Entrepreneurs are dreamers and they dream a lot bigger than can fit into a business plan.
Every failure has an equally big upside if you are willing to stay in the game.
Most of the companies I've invested in are run by two people with opposite skills and talents.
No one can be good at everything, it takes a real team to grow a business.
Opportunity can hide in the worst situations, and finding it is a matter of believing it's there.
All phenomenal salespeople know how to take a hit.
There are two kinds of people at work: expanders and containers. Expanders push the envelope, take risks, &amp; spend money. Containers love detail and plan well. You need both if you want to build a business.

Most wildly successful entrepreneurs are proving themselves better than an early adversity in their life.
You’re starting your own business, so you figure it’s time to brush up on the areas you're less good at, right? Nope! Listen to #BusinessUnusual as I explain why you need to lean into your strengths and natural abilities, not fix the stuff you’re bad at.  https://t.co/gVZOtw3pl1
The most underused tool in business today is making sure your people are having fun.
Most successful entrepreneurs start their business on the side of their day job with just a wing and a prayer. Putting in lots of hours.
The best entrepreneurs don't work to get rich, they work because they love what they do.
People think I'm not insecure, but it's my insecurities that drove every success!
Building a business is a contact sport. If you're afraid of getting hurt, you can't play well.
I don't look at the resume. It gets in the way of sizing up the person in front of me.
When you're the boss, you have the power to make your career what you dreamt it would be.
Never hire a mediocre person. You're guaranteed to get a mediocre job.
Business plans are overrated because the minute you get out on the street they won't work.
It's Thursday and @SabinLomac is back at it again on "Seaside Snacks and Shacks!" This week he's going from "Maine to Miami" with another episode of #SeasideSnacks. Watch TONIGHT on @CookingChannel beginning at 10 p.m. ET 7 p.m. PT. https://t.co/TGOTRn9fM7
The guilt of not doing something steals your energy.
Being poor gave me the drive I had to succeed. The way I saw it was I had nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up!
I'm well accustomed to struggle and everything I treasure most in life is a result of a challenge I had to overcome.
Most entrepreneurs are right-brainers. They dream better and act bigger than they are able to write business plans.
Many of my best entrepreneurs were lousy in school like me. But in the real world, success is measured by what you can do.
You have an ingenious gadget that you want to get into the market. Listen up as I tell you the only steps you should be taking to get your product off to a great start, how your price it, and what not to waste your money on! https://t.co/gVZOtw3pl1
My biggest challenge in business was not my competition. It was the tape inside my head keeping me back.
I don't care so much how talented someone is, but I care very much how persistent they are.
Attitude is 99% of everything. If you have the right attitude opportunity has a way of finding you.
Get away from negative people. Run for your life! They're like thieves in the night, quietly stealing your energy and your ability to get ahead.
You're crazy if you wait for a big opportunity. Every successful person I know simply solves problem after problem.
My best strength in school was my imagination. While every other kid was learning to read and write, I had 7 whole hours a day to daydream.
Circled Nebraska for 2 hours yesterday waiting out the storm in #NYC. Luckily I got the last bottle of wine and the last (healthy) salad from the frazzled flight attendant! 🍷 🥗 https://t.co/JupqcmEgbK
In school, I was labeled the dumb kid just because I couldn't learn to read. But in business I'm judged by what I can do!
Most of my successful entrepreneurs didn't have a passion. They simply recognized a problem and created a solution.
The best way to keep yourself motivated is to work toward a good result but to brace yourself for a bad one.

You have to know what market you're selling in. In a buyer's market, the buyer's right. In a seller's market, the seller's right.

Selling is nothing more than playing up the positives and shrinking any negative.
If you have real knowledge, you have a shortcut to earning the customer's trust.
I always over-prepare. I feel no one can win against me when I'm over-prepared.
To build a great business, you have to be able to sell your idea. Passion is just not enough.
Every great entrepreneur is wired the same way. They're aggressive, competitive, and they get people to follow them.

There were 85 others priced the same competing w/ it. I had the owner build a half-wall in the living room &amp; advertised “1BR+Den $340”
Passion is overrated. In business, the most important thing is your ability to sell and pushy people always deliver.
I think mentors are over-rated. I've been a mentor to more than 70 entrepreneurs and the most successful ones listen, and then do what they damn well please.

There are two kings of people at work: expanders and containers. Expanders push the envelope, take risks, &amp; spend money. Containers love detail and plan well. You need both if you want to build a business.

Get away from negative people. Run for your life! They're like thieves in the night, quietly stealing your energy and your ability to get ahead.
In school, I was labeled the dumb kid just because I couldn't learn to read. But in business I'm judged by what I can do!
The best way to keep yourself motivated is to work toward a good result but to brace yourself for a bad one.
I'd rather have one hard working passionate person by my side than an army of people who are just showing up.
I stay away from negative people. They manage to kill any creative spark I might have in business and in life
We are all slow to learn that we are far more capable than we think we are.
I love to invest in entrepreneurs who already know hardship, who need to prove something badly and are hungry for success. These are the ones I make a lot of money with.
Most of my successful entrepreneurs didn't have a passion. They simply recognized a problem and created a solution.

@ChandlerHelms So sit down &amp; think through and write answers to all the who, what, where, how, and how much questions for yourself first, and then have the writer make it cohesive and put it all in good order.
@ChandlerHelms I always think it's smart to find someone else to do what you’re not good at. With being said, the smart ideas of how you’ll start &amp; grow your business will have to come from you.
If you're not wired for taking risks, you won't build a big business, because business is all about taking risk.
Everyone responds well to people who are themselves. Don't waste time getting fancy - just be yourself.
Stop comparing yourself to everybody around you. If you're busy minding the next guy's business, who's minding yours?

@RealYungbizniss Mentoring is a 2 way street. Mentors choose people who can help them in return. So figure out what you have to offer and make your pitch.
In school, kids are too narrowly judged by how well they can read and write. In business, you're judged by what you can build.
The more well-educated the entrepreneur is in business, the less I trust them. The ones that do it for me are the scrappy ones, the ones who have something to prove.

@BillMe77 I am a consummate expander. Luckily I had my business partner Esther Kaplan, a container all the way. We balanced each other out to form a team that couldn't be beat!
I've found there are two kinds of people in business: expanders and containers. Expanders like to push the envelope, take risks, &amp; also spend money. Containers are more detail oriented &amp; conservative. They keep you from losing money.

Opportunity hides in the worst situations. Finding opportunity is a matter of believing it's there.
@DineHUBcom But most of the best sales stars I’ve worked with taught themselves how to sell. They watched other people, listened to tapes, joined toastmasters groups to learn how to be persuasive &amp; built their confidence bit by bit to become the superstars they deserve to be today.
My dreams literally came true when I purchased my penthouse! I feel like it really was destined for me. https://t.co/HnTbkqQtsH

I’m one if those b/c in a family of 10 kids I had to learn how to compete for my mother's attention &amp; be heard. That gave me an enormous leg up when I started my business.

@concussionawar3 But as years go by, you grow more successful and you have a lot more to lose. Today, I'm far more conservative in what I invest my money in. But I'm lucky enough to get my kicks by investing in the young entrepreneurs I find on #SharkTank and they eagerly take the risks for me.
@concussionawar3 I learned very young that I naturally thrive on risk as it wakes me up, turns me on and brings out my best! I could have never built a huge business if i hadn’t been comfortable with huge risk, and it's easy when you have nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up.
Of all the businesses I am introduced to on #SharkTank, the most successful ones are often run by two people with polar-opposite skills and talents.
Every single failure has an equally great upside if you are willing to stay in the game.

@Lenabean33 The problem is that you are “getting ready” instead of getting it going! The longer you procrastinate, the less likely you are to do it. Most successful entrepreneurs started their business while keeping their day job, on just a wing and a prayer with little preparation.
If someone is super intelligent and answering all the questions right but they're not a salesman, I'm not investing. If they can't sell it, it's not going to go.
What is the best named company?
In a buyer's market, the buyer's always right. In a seller's market, the seller's always right.

The more sickly competitive someone is, the more likely that they will be a great entrepreneur.
The best business partners often have different strengths and skills. All of these qualities will create a synergy and complement each other.
The worst business partners I've had hung on my every word.
The number one most important quality in an entrepreneur is the ability to get knocked down and not spend any time feeling sorry for yourself.

All the best entrepreneurs are not working to become rich, they’re working to solve something.

If you're not wired for risk, you can't build a big business. Business is all about taking risks.
It’s easy to spot a future entrepreneur at five years old!		https://t.co/oj5WlwumYo
When you think you're failing, you feel like people are watching you. I found that nobody is watching and all they care about is themselves.
Mind your own business! Stop comparing yourself to everybody around you. If you’re minding someone else’s business, who is minding yours?
Every single one of my great successes was a direct result of a failure first.

You could have the best business idea in the world and I wont touch it if I don't think the person standing in front of me can be a star.
Entrepreneurs are right-brainers. They often dream better than they write business plans.
To build a big business, you have to be able to sell your idea to every single person you meet. You have to be able to present your idea as simply irresistible.
You can try, but you can't fake passion.
The hardest thing in business is overcoming rejection. I learned to move forward fast!
In school, kids are too narrowly judged by how well they can read and write. In business, you're judged by what you can build.
In sales, everybody wants what everybody wants and nobody wants what nobody wants. You have to create the illusion of demand, even when there is none!

Being a working mom is hard. It's like asking your heart to be in two places at the same time.
There are only 2 women on Shark Tank, but together we've built more successful businesses than all the men combined!
I've never met a successful entrepreneur who couldn't sell. If you can't sell, you're not in business!
All of us can do a lot more than we think we can!
I'd rather have 1 excited worker with common sense than 100 big shots any day of the week!
Character isn't something you can teach. But if you demonstrate it, that's leading by example and others will surely follow.

I don't look at the resume until the end of the interview. It really gets in the way of sizing up the person in front of me.
When hiring someone, nothing is more important than finding that person with the best attitude.
Business is a contact sport. If you’re afraid to get hurt, you won’t play well.
If you're determined to grow a successful business, you've got to expand before you are ready!
To stay focused,  I divide my world into two parts - my business and my family - and I keep them totally separate.
RT @ABCSharkTank: #TFW you're ready to party @mcuban style #FridayFeeling #SharkTank https://t.co/JwqYgirl5A
When you’re your own boss, you have the power to make a life for yourself exactly as you dream!
I always hire attitude over experience. I can give someone experience, but I can't change a bad attitude.
If you stand back and analyze the best way to do something you’ll be standing there forever. Follow your gut and jump right in!

Adversity is always a great motivator.

There are hundreds of reasons not to do something. You only need to find ONE good reason to do it.
The best time to start a business is at the moment of conception. Wait a month and the idea is less attainable.
I learned to see the enemies coming long before they arrived which was a key to being able to survive in business and do what I had to do.
If you surround yourself with capable and positive people, they will connect you with other capable and positive people.
I used to walk a mile to avoid a failure and embarrassment, but they come anyway. It’s best to deal with failure head-on.
There’s great power in moving forward, whether you’re moving in the right direction or not.

Attitude is 99.9 percent of everything. If you have an attitude that you will find an opportunity, you will find that opportunity.

You're always smarter under fire than you are standing on the outside assessing a situation.
Confidence is the result of overcoming the negative tape you play over and over in your own head.
You're crazy to wait for the big opportunity. Every successful person I know hops from one little one to the next.
When business is bad, creativity wins and will always get you out of your slump.

Business is the most creative sport in the world. People who say business is not a sport have never played with me!
If you take people out of their comfort zones and have a little fun, even the most boring people in the world can come up with a creative idea. Fun is GOOD for business.
You have to stay with it and truly believe in the prize in order to find success. Some people give up way too early!

If you're not wired for risk, you can't build a big business.
You cannot change someone's bad attitude.

It’s normal to get stuck, but stupid to stay stuck.
Good leaders are not born, they are people who try hard to be exceptional!
Everybody has a certain skill set they excel at. Figure out what yours is and stick with it!
If you can’t read or write well, you learn to talk well. And talking is how I made my fortune.
If you don’t like your client, you can be sure they don’t like you. Drop them and focus on finding their replacement.
Just go for it. You don’t want to end up with regret.
The hardest lesson to learn is that you’re more capable then you think you are.
Mind your own business! Stop comparing yourself to everybody around you. If you’re minding someone else’s business, who is minding yours?

My best advice is to play up what you’re good at instead of sitting around criticizing yourself for all the things you don’t do well.
Procrastination is the biggest enemy of success.
Don’t moan and groan or bitch. I’ve never tolerated that because it’s contagious.
When you think you're failing, you feel like people are watching you. I found that nobody is watching and all they care about is themselves.

Every single one of my great successes was a direct result of a failure or an insult.
All the best entrepreneurs are not working to become rich, they’re working to solve something.
As a kid, I was dumb in the classroom, but it taught me not to be afraid to be different which has been a key to my success.
When you think you're failing, you feel like people are watching you. I found that nobody is watching and all they care about is themselves.

Good business is all about staying on the move and pushing yourself to get to that next level.
The most valuable employees are the ones who learn to take stress away from their boss.
My to-do list is in charge of my life, so I give it the proper respect it deserves and rewrite it daily.
In the real world, you don’t define someone’s intelligence as we do in a school system.

My mom showed me the gift of imagination and with it, I learned to fill in all the blanks.
Good leaders are not born, they are people who try hard to be exceptional!
Don't be afraid to fail! It's proof you'll soon be successful.
I never look at the resume until the end of the interview. It gets in the way of really sizing up the person before me.
I imagined every great thing that happened in my life. Then I worked like hell to make every detail come true.
People often think that I don't have insecurities... but I do. I just use them as fuel to succeed!
I can't work off of a to-do list that isn’t on paper! The delete button will never give you the kicks that crossing off tasks will give you.
Biggest mistakes small business owners make = pissing away money on patents and PR before they even have a product.
When business is bad, creativity wins and will always get you out of your slump.
I’d rather have 1 excited worker with common sense than 100 big shots with Harvard MBAs.
You could have the best business idea in the world and I won’t touch it if I don’t think the person standing in front of me can be a star!
I am never afraid to be different.
You're crazy to wait for the big opportunity. Every successful person I know hops from one little one to the next.

Never feel sorry for yourself when things don’t go as planned!
If you’re going to be in business, the single most important thing is the ability to communicate your idea to every single person you meet.
I'm accustomed to struggle. The way I see it, each of the things I most treasure in life is a result of extreme struggle.
You can teach any skill, but you cannot change a bad attitude.
You've got to find a way to stand apart from the crowd if you want your brand to be noticed.

My key piece of advice to budding entrepreneurs? Don’t waste time thinking about it. Get out there and do it!
If you can’t communicate well, you’re never going to make a sale. And you’re never going to build a business if you can’t make sales.
The difference between successful people and others is how long they spend time feeling sorry for themselves.
The best time to start a business is the moment you think about it for the very first time.
High energy is the secret sauce to pitching your business to investors and walking away with the money.

If somebody wastes time feeling sorry for themselves, I know that they’re never going to make it.
Attitude is 99.9 percent of everything. If you have an attitude that you will find an opportunity, you will find that opportunity.
Play up what you got and forget about what you don’t have.
My favorite combo is when I get two entrepreneurs equally talented, but with talents in different arenas.
The press never needs a story idea, they need statistics. Whatever industry you’re in, be able to give stats + you will be quoted in press.
If you could build a big brand, the business takes care of itself, I’ve always learned.
There’s great power in moving forward, whether you’re moving in the right direction or not.

I've learned that you need to treat obstacles just like opportunity -- quickly without much thought and move forward!
Building a business is little more than a series of quick opportunities followed by a big a series of big obstacles.
I learned to see the enemies coming long before they arrived which was a key to being able to survive in business and do what I had to do.
On Shark Tank, all the pitch is is the first date. It is the building of the business that is the marriage.
The best way to fund any company is bootstrapping. You spend your money smartly, because you don't have enough.

There are hundreds of reasons not to do something. You only need to find ONE good reason to do it.
If you can present your business as irresistible and back up your claim with real numbers, most people will believe you.
I go for someone who has high energy over someone with a high IQ every time.
Becoming a mother is the most satisfying work I've done.
Money is not the only thing that motivates employees. It's about making them happy.
Women in business: know and trust what you deserve and then aggressively pursue it!
RT @pattistanger: Love this statement. Amen! https://t.co/XhwKs57N31
It took me 20 years set myself free &amp; kill that little voice inside that whispers "Don't go there. You can't do it. Don't take the chance."
Negativity is a blood sucking, poisonous, good-for-nothing weed that kills any creative spark you have in business and in life.
Everyone recognizes and responds well to people who act like themselves. You don't have to be fancy, you just have to be yourself.
In our house, the sofa was ripped, so my mother covered it with laughter.
I'm on @iHeartRadio tomorrow morning at 9:15am et talking all about my book and answering your burning real estate questions. Tune in!
Be careful! You can catch a great attitude from optimistic people.
Stop putting it off!  Procrastination is the enemy of success.
If you don't have the desire to win, you won't.

Adversity is always a great motivator.
The great thing about failure is you can learn something and try again.
The only time I got off track was when I decided to know my competition. What a mistake! It was much better when I didn't give a crap!
If you can’t communicate well, you’re never going to make a sale. And you’re never going to build a business if you can’t make sales.

I certainly got the competitive gene and it has helped me tremendously in the business world.
I inherited my money attitude from both my mother and father who believed the purpose of money was to be spent!
Great decision on @DancingABC last night by NOT eliminating anyone! In honor of the Las Vegas tragedy. No room for more bad news.
The most valuable sales lesson I learned is that everybody wants what everybody wants and nobody wants what nobody wants.
Life is too damn short to work so hard only to find out in the 11th inning that you didn't have enough fun!
I tripped over my biggest success when I was running like hell to get somewhere else. I wouldn't have found it if I had been sitting down!
New entrepreneurs think that getting into retail is the Holy Grail, but be careful! Your margins are immediately cut in half.
Being a terrible student and labeled a dunce in school was freeing. It taught me to overcome what sets me back.

If someone doesn't fit in your company, you have an obligation to get rid of them because you're holding them back from excelling elsewhere!
If you plan to be a big success in life, don’t pace yourself or rely on a business plan -the key is biting off more than you can chew.
If you don't like your client, you can be sure they don't like you. Drop them and focus on finding their replacement.
Imagine exactly what you want your business to look like once it’s successful. Then make a to-do list to make your daydream a reality.
People imitate their leader. Lead by example.
Don't get cocky just because you've had a good run. You can lose your business as fast as you've earned it.
Growing a #smallbusiness into something big takes street smarts - not the kind of smarts you learn in school.
My entrepreneurs didn't seek out their passion, they stumbled upon it as they recognized a problem and created a solution.
Check out my interview with real estate coach @JoshCantwell. I reveal the KEY ATTRIBUTES of successful entrepreneurs https://t.co/m9D5UYlJPY
You know what creates credibility? A total belief in what you’re doing.
Your heart must always be in it. That's part of an entrepreneur's DNA.
Over the years I’ve developed huge muscles in my brain and my body to stand back up and take another shot.

If you don't have a demand for your product or service, create the illusion that there is.

If you’re going to be in business, the single most important thing is the ability to communicate your idea to every single person you meet.
Don't spend your time sitting around criticizing yourself for all the things you don't do well. Instead, focus only on your strengths.
Never feel sorry for yourself when things don’t go as planned!
Your heart must always be in it! That's part of an entrepreneur's DNA.
The only dream I ever had was to be the "Queen of New York Real Estate." It took me 22 years to get there but I did it.
I can't work off of a to-do list that isn’t on paper! The delete button will never give you the kicks that crossing off tasks will give you.
Good business is all about staying on the move and pushing yourself to get to that next level.

Business is a contact sport. If you are afraid to get hurt, you won’t play well.
I'm not afraid of competition, I actually thrive on it! Sometimes I compete for things I don't even want just for the rush of competing.
Life is funny. You get what you give. If you spend your time doing good things for others, they will lift you up and carry you to the top.
Great entrepreneurs are like racehorses. They’re high strung, run fast and love to compete.
I liked each and every one of my 22 jobs. But what I didn’t like was someone telling me what to do all day.

In the real world, you don’t define someone’s intelligence as we do in a school system.
The best way to stay motivated is to never feel sorry for yourself when things don’t go as planned!
RT @TheSharkDaymond: “Stretch and try things and feel free to NOT succeed. That’s how you build an innovative business.” - @BarbaraCorcoran
If your business risk doesn’t turn out the way you hoped, find a way to cover your rent and start a new business on the spot!
The secret to starting a successful business is following a hunch that what you love is what a lot of customers are willing to pay for.
I love to invest in people who are turned on by risk.
People often think that I don't have insecurities, but I do. I just use them as fuel to succeed.
As a kid, I was dumb in the classroom, but it taught me not to be afraid to be different which has been a key to my success.
All the best entrepreneurs are not working to become rich, they’re working to solve something.
You’ve got to believe you are deserving of good luck if it’s ever going to find you.
Business plans are overrated. The minute you get out on the street they don’t work.
Never keep a job you don’t enjoy. If you can’t find the courage to fire yourself, you better hope that someone else will.
I’ve made money on every investment I made listening to my gut, and I’ve lost money every time I ignored that little voice inside.
People always ask me what it takes to start a successful business. It's simple. You need street smarts and grit.
There is nothing more important than a positive attitude!
The #1 mistake entrepreneurs make is saying YES! The problem with saying yes is that you're saying yes to someone else's agenda - NOT yours!
All the best things that happened to me happened after I was rejected. I knew the power of getting past no.
If you hang around after your worst failures, there's always a prize for you on the other side.
When you think you're failing, you feel like people are watching you. I found that nobody is watching and all they care about is themselves.
Change is tough! But when we are truly in a tough spot we learn and grow the most.
RT @ABCSharkTank: There's a new guest Shark in town! 📷: @BarbaraCorcoran #SharkTank https://t.co/lkVHuQqvdG
There's no better time than now to start a business. Why? Why not!
We all do well at what we love. If you want to succeed, you better find something you love.
My best advice is to play up what you're good at instead of sitting around criticizing yourself for all the things you don't do well.
Feel free to NOT succeed. That’s how you build an innovative business.

When business is bad, creativity wins and will always get you back on top!
When someone crosses the line and undermines me, I don’t accept it.

You cannot study to be an entrepreneur. You just have to take the first jump.
The truth is you can teach any skill, but you cannot change a bad attitude.
The way I see it, every mistake makes me smarter and pushes me ahead to bigger and better!
@arisytner Not yet! We are still looking for an A or O kidney donor.
If you’re working for the love of money, you won’t get any.
In business, it’s very easy to spend money but very hard to spend it wisely.
To stay focused,  I divide my world into two parts, my business and my family, and I do whatever it takes to keep them totally separate.

The most valuable sales lesson I learned is that everybody wants what everybody wants and nobody wants what nobody wants.
If you want me to invest, you've got to know your numbers, have enormous energy pitching and have real passion for your product.
Entrepreneurs are right-brainers, they often dream better than they write business plans.
Knowledge is the best shortcut to earning a customer’s trust. Make sure to always do your homework. I over-prepare for everything I do.

Good publicity is the fastest and cheapest way to set your business apart from the crowd.
If you’re working for the love of money, you won’t get any.
You can teach any skill, but you cannot change a bad attitude.

Every single one of my most successful entrepreneurs found their passion when they stumbled upon a solution to a problem others didn’t see.

Don’t underestimate the power of your imagination.
All success is born out of action.
I invest in people who are turned on by risk.
I didn’t find my passion - I discovered it by accident while I was working my ass off.
Most of my successful entrepreneurs started their businesses while they had a full-time job.
People smarts will prove 10 times more valuable than book smarts in business.
If you can’t read or write well, you learn to talk well. And talking is how I made my fortune.

I started my business young, when I had no mortgage, had nothing to lose, and was too stupid to know any better.
Passion is overrated. Persistence, not passion, is a measure of success!

You could have the best business idea in the world and I won’t touch it if I don’t think the person standing in front of me can be a star!
Knowledge is the best shortcut to earning a customer’s trust.
If you plan to be a big success in life, don’t pace yourself or rely on a business plan -the key is biting off more than you can chew.
Stop putting it off!  Procrastination is the enemy of success.
Business is one of the easiest ways to touch people’s lives + make a difference.

Finding opportunity is a matter of believing it’s there.
I was never afraid to be different.
When you look for ways to expand your business, the real pot of gold is usually the same stuff that’s already proven successful!
You can’t make unhappy people happy, no matter what!
Happy Mother’s Day! https://t.co/TgywcRR9X1
Imagine exactly what you want your business to look like once it’s successful. Then make a to-do list to make your daydream a reality.
I’ve made money on every investment I made listening to my gut, and I’ve lost money every time I ignored that little voice inside.
The hardest thing in business is overcoming rejection. The best lesson I've ever learned is to move forward FAST!
You're crazy to wait for the big opportunity. Every successful person I know hops from one little one to the next.

You're going to see 1 thing on Shark Tank tonight you'll never see again and I'll give you a hint- it rhymes with Venus! @ABCSharkTank
There is no substitute for an entrepreneur who is confident, has something to prove and is really good at taking a hit and getting back up!
Fretting about what other people think often stops you from trying in the first place. Just go for it. You don’t want to end up with regret.
I gave up on the concept that you can actually have balance in your life - it's a phantom chase. You can have it all, just not all at once!
Leaders come in two flavors, expanders and containers. The best leadership teams have a mix of both.
I always say confidence is overrated. It’s when we’re uncomfortable and looking for answers that we learn and grow the most.

Preparation is grossly underrated. I over-prepare for everything I do.
The biggest confidence booster is looking back on how far you've come.
I always find that business plans are highly overrated. The minute you get out on the street they don't work.

Remember, the bigger the failure, the bigger the boom on the other side!
Mind your own business! Stop comparing yourself to everybody around you. If you’re minding someone else’s business, who is minding yours?
The second a new idea pops into my head, I immediately move on it. Start that fire and get it burning immediately, it’s everything!

Don't be afraid to fail! It's proof you'll soon be successful.
Forget about perfection! It doesn't exist.
People always forget that perception is reality. Create the image of success whether you have it or not!
Don’t moan and groan or bitch—I’ve never tolerated that, because it’s contagious.
Happy Derby Day! https://t.co/cfjLx0WtWY
If you want me to invest, you've got to know your numbers, have enormous energy pitching and have real passion for your product.
It seemed my mom could do 100s of things at once, all while keeping at least one of her blue eyes on her 10 children. Moms are superheroes!
Whether you have a tiny business or a big business, if you don’t jump on a fresh idea right away, it’s like a bird flying by – it flies off.
Entrepreneurs are right-brainers, they often dream better than they write business plans.
Knowledge is the best shortcut to earning a customer’s trust. Make sure to always do your homework. I over-prepare for everything I do.
It’s always smart to focus on what’s already working in your business rather than what’s not.
I’m always looking for a salesperson because there is no such thing as a company that succeeds without a great salesperson selling it.

Want to be a great leader? I find that the best leaders ALWAYS do 1 thing in common. They inspire others to join their parade!
After enough embarrassing failures I learned that in the end, nobody’s watching and nobody gives a damn!
The secret to moving your business ahead is to fail well, get up fast + be assured that the next big thing is right around the corner.
The only way to start anything worthwhile is to stop talking about it.
You've got to expand your business before you are ready. It's the only formula I know for aggressive growth.
Being a working mom is hard. It's like asking your heart to be in two places at once.
Stretch and try things and feel free to NOT succeed. That’s how you build an innovative business.
Every single failure has an equally great upside if you are willing to stay in the game.
The biggest challenge in business is not the competition, it's what goes on inside your own head.
If people like you, they’re going to want to do business with you. If they don’t, you have an insurmountable obstacle to overcome.
Procrastination is the enemy of success. Guilt deflates energy and it's all downhill from there.
Indecision is poison. Even when you make the wrong decision, you're at least moving and have the chance of stumbling into something great!
I worked for 22 people before I started my own business. I loved every job, but I sure hated having a boss to report to.
The best way to fund any company is bootstrapping. You spend your money wisely, because you don't have enough.
If I told you your mortgage was a waste of money, what would you say? First, read this: https://t.co/6RclQmB3q8 #spon
The essence of a great entrepreneur is the ability to bounce back... from anything!
Always create a sense of demand for your new product, rather than waiting to have demand.
Make sure you know what NOT to do.  Everyone should have their own ‘Not To Do’ list.  I’m updating mine now!
You don’t need an MBA to launch a business. You need street smarts and grit.
I don't care how talented someone is but I do care how persistent they are.
Attitude is way more important than knowledge. RT if you agree!
My mom showed me the gift of imagination and with it, I learned to fill in all the blanks.
I’m always looking for high energy. Why? Because I’ve never seen anyone succeed without it.
I’m doggedly determined and extremely insecure. These together have contributed greatly to my success.
The best way to stay motivated is to never feel sorry for yourself when things don't go as planned!
If you're going to spend 10 to 12 hours a day doing something, you better love doing it!
The way I see it, every mistake makes me smarter + pushes me ahead.

If you can communicate your passion and the logic of your idea clearly and succinctly, you're going to get a fish on your hook.
