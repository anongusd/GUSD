I just logged back onto Instagram after 6 months off. 		One observation, purely mine: It's so much about being an influencer now that it feels more like advertising than it did before. It's so blatantly fake, making it less depressing (via peer comparison) and also less sticky.
How many companies would you name that would *ever* go on record to respond to M&amp;A rumors from a major tech player like that? Most would at best say, "err we're not looking to sell right now." (code for "unless it's the right price") 		https://t.co/ZDYz8EB4lK
Judy Faulkner's response to the idea that Apple could buy Epic:	1) She's in charge: "we're not going to do that." 	2) She's proud that Epic has its way of doing things, which wouldn't align with Apple. "Nobody questioned it. That was a real achievement"	https://t.co/kcTfQJvank

@MarioATX_MD Not a perfect analogy I'll admit, but imagine you're buying your coffee, and the barista keeps pushing you to order two lattes, or maybe three. And add in some tea and scones while you're at it. And your latte could cost a thousand dollars. Or $2. You don't know.
One thing I kept hearing over and over at #JPM19 is the term "incentive alignment." 		It might sound boring, but this is in fact massively important as many people in health care want to do the right thing. They are hampered in a system that trades on volume, not value.

@qhardy ^^^ if all that was achievable by most people, we wouldn‚Äôt have the public health problems that we do. Hence the interest in new ideas. Or new takes on old ideas. Keto has been used as a treatment to better control epilepsy since the twenties.
@qhardy There‚Äôs a lack of evidence in general when it comes to nutritional science so I like to take a more guinea pig approach. It seems to be more fun to read/watch, too, rather than review what other people think.
@qhardy Why not?

@ArthurAllen202 In my mind, that changes if I approach my doctor with some data, whether it's as simple as a food log as a jumping off point to talk about nutrition. Or, in the future, BP readings from my Apple Watch. It's a way to start a new kind of conversation.
@ArthurAllen202 Yep, and we'll see more of that. Purely anecdotally, in all my experiences with a doc, I get "we'll run these tests, and then you'll do that." Oftentimes I never see the results, and I rarely discuss them over with a doc. Plus, we rarely touch on proactive health; only sick care.
@ArthurAllen202 I suspect that more &amp; more will expect to be able to present their own data and talk it over with their doctor. Docs who expect only to "lecture at" vs. "discuss with" will be increasingly a thing of the past.
@ArthurAllen202 I don't think it's just about the aFib feature (which is just the beginning for Apple, per our reporting). And more about how patients are starting to rethink about their relationship with a doctor, as they're getting more access to their own health data.

@venkmurthy @fordvox @EJSMD @Apple @AppCardiogram @AliveCor Yes so what your saying makes sense. But it is the opposite of what broad consumer logic would dictate. I would assume that if I got more tests, you smart MDs would find stuff that needed to be found. 		Education is key.

@venkmurthy @fordvox @EJSMD @Apple @AppCardiogram @AliveCor The problem is this: most people in the medical world argue that more health data doesn‚Äôt make you healthier. More health testing isn‚Äôt healthy. 		But that runs counter to what Silicon Valley believes (and that seems illogical to folks here). More data is always better.
@venkmurthy @fordvox @EJSMD @Apple @AppCardiogram @AliveCor And that‚Äôs all of our challenge
@venkmurthy @fordvox @EJSMD @Apple @AppCardiogram @AliveCor From my vantage that message is out there. A lot of reporters are asking questions.  The challenge is in reaching the public as these are less sexy ideas than a lifesaving wearable. These concerns need to be explained in a way that‚Äôs palatable outside of cardiology circles.
