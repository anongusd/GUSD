@AmandaMorin @washingtonpost @emmersbrown @ByMoriah @timcraigpost @slarimer I see. I was thrown off by the supposed expulsion. But according to the Miami Herald, and contrary to the WaPo piece, he was NOT expelled, which would have been more consistent w/ the school’s having held a manifest. det. https://t.co/RNRpZdHVGJ
@AmandaMorin @washingtonpost @emmersbrown @ByMoriah @timcraigpost @slarimer I agree about great reporting and the schools’ efforts! But I didn’t notice  a manifestation determination — just an expulsion followed by a transfer to an alternative school (?).  Wondering about that last placement — whether it was appropriate and what services he got there?
@ByMoriah @emmersbrown @timcraigpost @slarimer Okay, thanks. Do we know anything yet about the “alternative school,” like if it’s a public school in the same school district? what sorts of services/supports it provided? whether he was placed there by the school district? what happened there in 2017?
@emmersbrown @timcraigpost @ByMoriah @slarimer I am unclear. At first it says here (and in other reports) he was “expelled,” then later it says he “transferred to an alternative school” after the threat assessment. Can you clarify?

@matthewladner @Dyrnwyn @RbnLake @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext Yes, outdated sped weights are in massive need of revision to make the ESA program fair, not to mention to provide public schools w/ funding that bears some rational relationship to needs of the students they serve.
Charter schools should embrace criticism and become better https://t.co/o5B3lkd2AR

@matthewladner @Dyrnwyn @RbnLake @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext I’m waiting for anyone to come through.
@matthewladner @RbnLake @Dyrnwyn @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext IMHO, adequately-resourced public schools are the only legitimate solution.  ESAs seem attractive to parents who are tired of fighting — until they realize the limitations. https://t.co/XkZMdnvvNQ @brianmrosenthal @HoustonCVPE @HoustonBen @DDTX12 @LoloSube
@matthewladner @Dyrnwyn @RbnLake @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext Yes, that’s totally cool — for families who can afford for 1 parent to quit work and homeschool.  (I tried this for 1 year w/ my daughter w/ #Dyslexia). But what about the ones who can’t afford to do this?
@matthewladner @RbnLake @Dyrnwyn @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext My original tweet was unclear. What I meant was state NAEP comparisons don’t tell us how “choice” policies have affected groups w/in Arizona. Is there any data that compares, for example, students w/ disabilities in charter v district v ESA within AZ?
@matthewladner @Dyrnwyn @RbnLake @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext That’s  a good point. I come to the debate more from perspective of students w/ disabilities who often have no real choice, whether it be a charter OR another district.  Nor do ESAs solve the problem for them (not enough $ — plus private schools can reject them).  It’s unfair.
@matthewladner @RbnLake @Dyrnwyn @rickhess99 @AlexLMedler @GreatHeartsAcad @mrmrvt @NAEP_NCES @Ninacharters @EducationNext Thanks for the data. Still not convinced. Correlation doesn’t equal causation, as we all know.  Moreover, data show an inverse relationship between “choice”/unregulated charters  and segregation. Some of us are more bothered by this than others, I suppose.
@NEPCtweet @JanResseger Great work. I follow the ESA issue closely, and this is the best analysis I have seen so far with regard to how ESAs seem to play out here in AZ. But bottom line is we need more data/info, and no one is collecting it!
