@RedNightHawkAKS Again: Show me where she said he was disloyal to America. Disloyal to Khashoggi maybe. But not the country.
@RedNightHawkAKS And her tweet on Trump implies a financial incentive to be a Saudi apologist. It doesn‚Äôt question his patriotism.
@RedNightHawkAKS Because that is the implication of her remarks on Israel. That American Jews and elected leaders are more loyal to Israel. Which is simply crazy.
@RedNightHawkAKS Missed that, thanks. She gets it. Now show me where she said Trump is more loyal to Saudi Arabia than America.
@MajJackDowning I think there is no doubt Khashoggi‚Äôs murder has changed the equation but I don‚Äôt think anyone expects the regime‚Äôs influence will markedly change.
@gabebecerra Her comments were clearly intended to single out American Jewish leaders as disloyal to America in favor of Israel. That‚Äôs a trope as Engel said. If she said American policy toward Israel too often turns a blind eye she would be taken seriously.
@MajJackDowning Even an alleged extrajudicial killing of a newspaper reporter ordered by the Saudi monarch can‚Äôt measurably change U.S. policy.
@MajJackDowning Well it is pretty clear the Saudis and other oil-rich regimes have wired every major Washington think tank with all their financial support. Shrewd way to shape American policy.  Just seems the Israel example is highlighted more often than other influencial allies.
I‚Äôd be curious her views on how beholden American leaders are to non-democratic dictatorships like Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/nnMmQX4V6b

@JeffSchogol @nancyayoussef And the more the sources are not willing to be identified the more likely they are wrong or only partially accurate.
@JeffSchogol @nancyayoussef They can still be wrong and it have nothing to do with how good they are as reporters.  Defense officials talk out of school and share inaccurate information ‚Äî wittingly and unwittingly ‚Äî all the time.
And I know I will be personally attacked for these comments but I expect nothing less from a crowd that claims to have all the answers, has no doubts and a well earned reputation for arrogant pomposity.
But I should make clear that the CIA did order the assassinations of foreigners. That‚Äôs historical record. But there is no evidence the CIA leadership ordered anything of the sort when it comes to the Kennedy brothers.
That doesn‚Äôt mean that individuals who at some point worked for or were trained and supported by the CIA weren‚Äôt involved. They very well may have been. And the agency very well could have covered up for them. But that is very different than ‚Äúthe CIA‚Äù killed the Kennedys.
@nancyayoussef @dave_brown24 They put out a press release labeled ‚Äúexclusive.‚Äù It was breathless. I almost lost my breath reading it. :)
@dave_brown24 @JeffSchogol @nancyayoussef Nah. I bet it is different sources describing the same thing. Smaller exercises. Maybe with a different name but focusing on same type of training. And they probably have t actually decided yet the details. S&amp;S deserves some credit for this report.
@nancyayoussef That's if the NBC story is correct. With no on the record confirmation I am not convinced. :)

@Rand_Simberg Personal attacks are all the rage these days from the top on down and I believe it is to the detriment of ‚Äúliberal‚Äù democracy.
@Rand_Simberg I don‚Äôt know enough about her record or her story to judge her intelligence or fitness for office. Maybe she is an idiot. But I‚Äôm not gonna take your word for it with no backup. And such gutter tactics help none of us to make positive contributions.
@Rand_Simberg Sourcing yourself? Lol. I do enjoy the ‚Äúconversation.‚Äù All labels are simplistic and meant to divide. No one truly free thinking is ideological one way or the other. And I put some individuals over groups and some groups over individuals. Depends on the day and circumstances :)
@Rand_Simberg You certainly can but you made no analytical case. Just called her an idiot.
@Rand_Simberg I will read it but this is how you get judged unfortunately. We all do. No one reads what we write for the most part.
@Rand_Simberg You just reinforced your bias with your McCarthyite leftist trope. Do you know what a real leftist is? ‚ÄòCause I think there aren‚Äôt very many of them in this country in this era. Certainly not with any real political power in our corporatocracy.
@Sirsquiliam @DefenseBaron @hughhewitt I think the criticism was fair in the sense that Hewitt lets the Assad regime and Russia off the hook. They are far more responsible for the misery and death of innocents than ISIS and Obama policies combined.
@Rand_Simberg I thought you were a serious tech and space policy writer and analyst. Trying to be objective and focus on objective facts. Your anti-liberal bias is just as bad as the anti-conservative bias you obsess over. Worse. At least you don‚Äôt hide it. Points for that.
@Sirsquiliam @DefenseBaron @hughhewitt Ok I‚Äôll acknowledge that logic but where does Trump fit in? How has he succeeded in Syria where the humanitarian crisis is still epic and the war criminal Assad has gone unpunished and unchecked minus a few pin pricks. And Russia has been empowered?

@CJelz1854 @highthink1905 @HillaryClinton I was talking about Hillary's deplorables comment, as my response makes clear. Not about your comment.

And anyone with any knowledge or who cares about facts knows the chief diplomat's email would not contain identifies of undercover CIA agents
@KBMAGAFL @HillaryClinton This entirely non-sourced conjecture article has been totally debunked. Just FYI.
@AnthonyLiuzza Having said that, not all cigars are created equal.
@AnthonyLiuzza I think you can believe not every human being has the same intelligence, physical abilities, or other innate qualities and still believe that all races, ethnic groups and religious backgrounds have among them the smartest, strongest, most simple-minded and weakest.
@DefenseBaron I think we should file a joint application. We have a good track record as a team. I won't cuddle, though.
@highthink1905 @CJelz1854 @HillaryClinton I'm not defending her. The comment was atrocious &amp; politically stupid. My real point: His awful behavior is commonly defended by pointing out the awful behavior of others, especially HRC. Two wrongs don't make a right. I learned that when I was about 5.
I hereby appeal to @elonmusk and @yousuck2020 to consider a journalist among the artist-astronauts you now plan to invite on the first private trip to the moon on @spacex's #BFR spacecraft -- to chronicle first hand the milestone. #politicospace.

@roguechimp99 Well, we were talking about the assault accusations. Now you are making it about something else. I think we should move on.
@roguechimp99 If he is guilty I am pretty confident his defense will not hold up. Other accusers will come forward, etc. But he deserves to defend himself.
@roguechimp99 I never said or presumed any of that. But do men have no rights at all when they are accused by a single woman of such crime? She is almost certainly truthful, in my view, but we do ourselves no favors if we uniformly take your strident, damn-the-accused approach.
@roguechimp99 And I‚Äôm not sure why you felt the need to call me an idiot. Why does the discourse here always need to be so ugly? I‚Äôm not ready to make any conclusions yet about her very credible story. Certainly not so firmly as to call someone else an idiot.

@luke_j_obrien @AaronMehta We agree to disagree.  I would not have said it publicly of any defense contractor I cover. Saying SpaceX is doing well is fine. That is a fact. Her role in it is not. It is an opinion.
@luke_j_obrien @AaronMehta How about he is the best chairman of the Joint Chiefs I have covered? The best SECDEF? I think it is a good rule of thumb to keep personal opinions about folks we cover to ourselves. I'm sure Aaron is objective but appearance matters, too.
@AaronMehta We all have different viewpoints. Seemed off to so blatantly &amp; publicly laud head of defense contractor you cover by name. Yes, SpaceX is now a defense contractor, as you know. When I read an interview you conduct with her I will remember that you said she was the bees knees.

@Rand_Simberg I hear you. I just think it is irrelevant. If we think the climate is changing in a way that is a risk to humanity then we should give a big damn about it and the things we might do to minimize the impact. Yours is an argument often used  to justify  doing nothing.
@Rand_Simberg Yes and humans have been here even less than that.
Reminder: the power to create a  #SpaceForce as a separate military branch rests with the legislative branch, which is vested with the authority in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to "raise and support Armies." Pentagon can reorganize but only to a point.

@weinbergersa @kristina_wong The story feeds the Russian narrative that this is all hyped and there is nothing to it. Which is a bald-faced lie. It didn‚Äôt take much on their part to have a significant impact due to the nature of technology. I think we downplay it at our peril.
@kristina_wong We can just agree to disagree on this one. The indictment on Friday should spin your head on what the Russians have accomplished and what they are still doing. They don‚Äôt need our help to get their lies out.
@kristina_wong I‚Äôm not suggesting we should ignore the propaganda. Pretty hard to ignore, anyway. Our free press doesn‚Äôt need to help a government that seeks us ill.
@kristina_wong Yes but I doubt that was the take-away for the average reader. In fact, that was probably a lot more newsworthy. The fact he didn‚Äôt deny what Putin does in the face of a maintain of evidence. I doubt you could have published that.
