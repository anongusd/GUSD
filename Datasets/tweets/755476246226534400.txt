@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dude, you want to limit freedom of speech. Fuck off.
@KingRiptor @KilledKennyJr @KamalaHarris You are more than welcome to come and take them then. You seem to forget what happened last time a government tried to ban rifles all together. I have no problem killing anyone who comes to take my "assault rifle" since you are so ignorant to realize there is no such thing.
@KamalaHarris Come and take it.
@ABC Tool.
@IlhanMN Because you are a traitor to the constitution with your belief system. When you finally do try to implement sharia law in any way shape or form dont be surprised when it end in an all out revolution and #wethepeople will not be taking prisoners.
@TeamPelosi You can make any poll have any outcome you want. #pollsareworthless
@TeamPelosi Get ready, feb 15 is another shutdown if we dont get the wall. Considering how federal wage is higher on avg. and the incompetency of so many ABC agencies #wethepeople dont care if you dont get paid. 8 yeas of lost VA digital medical records, #IRScustomerserviceisworst
@tedlieu @POTUS Yea....GFY. We want the wall. We will get the wall.
@AOC Or the software needs more work... too simple eh...
@tedlieu This is why an unrestrained 2A is critical. If they had not surrendered their furearms peacefully, then they could not be rounded up peacefully. Fuck govt. Keep it limited. Make sure govt fears "we the people"
@IlhanMN Letting the people keep their weapons is a good place to start. ALL govt is necessary evil, meaning ALL govt is evil.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump won fair and square...you are all just butt hurt you lost.
@AOC Just shut up. Because you say something doenst make it true. You open your mouth and we see how dumb you are.
@dosorio911 @SpeakerPelosi The democrats want a civil war, thats what happened.
@GonzoVeritas @SpeakerPelosi Hope you are ready for civil war!!
@SpeakerPelosi No it does not. We voted for Trump.
@TeamPelosi #PelosiSchumerShutdown its your turn to compromise. Build. The. Fuckin. Wall.
@TeamPelosi No it is time you compromise.
@Alyssa_Milano MAGA hat is free speech. Fuck your censorship.
@TitaniaMcGrath Free speech is free speech. Enslaving another human being cant even be compared. Because something offends you doesnt mean it cant be said. Fuck off... see offensive but it still free speech.
@athoughtz @TeamPelosi Its called import tax. But considering we wasted 2B on a fuckin website that sucked balls. We can spend 5.7B out of 4.4T on national security. #feelingsdontcount #NPCthinksOrangeManBad #buildthewall
@RN_LibDem @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi No we don't!!!!!!!!!
@TeamPelosi #pelosishutdown Build. The. Wall.
@Hugginsme1 As someone with a Bachelors in Elementary Education with an emphasis in math this question is fucking stupid. The "new" math is a mental mind fuck. Math is already difficult for 50% of the population and now it is being made more difficult to line peoples pockets with $$$$$.
@lizzwinstead @IlhanMN @IngrahamAngle Annnd go fuck yourself. Cant wait till we can skip to the civil war.
@IlhanMN You are a disgrace. No head wear, no exceptions. Also if you see Israel as evil and your enemy then you see the USA the same way. Side note fuck any culture that thinks female genital mutilation, slavery, child brides, honor killing for converting to another religion is okay!
@AOC Any poll can be tailored to produce any outcome.
@MrCool01937254 @DjCraigPlague @dicey__ @amottsevert @AOC @FoxNews If she is wrong factually then she is not motally right by default.
@dicey__ @DjCraigPlague @amottsevert @AOC @FoxNews Maybe she will run a train on you too....lol...😂😂😂😂😂
@EAStarWars @EA I hate you EA for canceling the Orca project. If it requires effort and has no microtransactions you dont give a fuck about it. You as bad and as greedy as Disney. Please do stat wars fans a favor and let someone else make star wars games.
@jasonschreier I hate you EA. If it requires effort and has no microtransactions you dont give a fuck about it. You as bad and as greedy as Disney. Please do stat wars fans a favor and let someone else make star wars games.
@AOC ICE dentention is lawful. If immigrants dont break the law coming here they wont be detained. For profit prisons need to end.
@RepMaxineWaters Getting a job is based on skill not skin.
@RepMaxineWaters @realDonaldTrump Nice propoganda piece you have there...too bad its just an opinion and not anything factual.
@Alyssa_Milano Actually the everyday main street american does want the wall. Just sayin.

@sharicedavids @RepDavids Diversity is not the key to success. Having the skill set to do the job leads to success.
@AOC Robert Byrd, HRC mentor... I will just leave this here...
@NYDailyNews Hahahahahaha. Love it.
@kimgoodwin @cydharrell Are they breaking the law? If yes call the cops. This includes loud noise after 10pm. Loitering where there is a no loitering sign. Etc. Crazy but if you dont break the law people dont call the cops.
@kimgoodwin This is why PC is stupid... and thankfully tolerance for PC is dying.
@Statebird2 @krassenstein Being able to quite apostles creed doesn't get you into heaven. Just sayin. Even satan can quote all of the bible.
@krassenstein We don't vote for preacher. Draining the swamp, building the wall, and removing government regulations from the economy do not require someone to be a christian. He won because he was not a career politician. He won because he is a business man.

@realDonaldTrump About time!!!!
@TitaniaMcGrath Yea....No! Free speech is free speech. You want to restrict free speech we can just go ahead and skip to the bloody civil war as soon as possible.

@benandjerrys @netargv @womensmarch @ColorOfChange @HonorTheEarth I am very much looking forward to the death of political correctness and "social justice." You all are such a miserable lot of people being professional victims that you must destroy everything fun in life. This move seems to indicate you would like to have a failing business.
@washingtonpost Don Lemon is a joke... but hey keep on spitting bull shit like this... there is no way all this hate could ever lead to a civil war...
@AuthorTroyASkog @amyklobuchar #NPC ^^^
@rxsanity @Dulu_Kruser @amyklobuchar NPC much with your comments...
@amyklobuchar Free speech is free speech... hurt feelings dont count and the actions of one person are NOT controlled by another... study up on natural rights and individual sovereignty please
@CNN Hard target versus soft target. No weapons allowed = unarmed easy targets. About 50% of society is now a professional victim making them soft targets. I open carry on Mo. I have concealed carry before where ever I want since no one knew I had it anyway... screw sensitivity
