@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @klairsara @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The pro-abortion argument was destroyed many years ago, when science declared life begins at conception.

@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Because of the special interests involved in the legislative process, it's simply pragmatism to avoid jumping on the bandwagon &amp; buying the propaganda. Instead, dig deeper to find out who stands to profit &amp; how much from choosing the winners over the losers.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Actually, sounds more like pro-aborts want to remove the option of keeping the child. Every Q &amp; scenario presented thus far has the underlying assumption that letting the child in utero live wld be horrific, dangerous, traumatic, etc. Why is pregnancy so abhorrent to pro-aborts?
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Between forcing abortion &amp; killing a child in utero or letting the natural process that is pregnancy proceed until viability, the more humane course of action is let Drs assess depth of mental illenss/disability to allow child to live &amp; DON'T force sterilize anybody (Ôæâ)‚Ä¢œâ‚Ä¢(„Éæ)

@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump "Sangar shaped the eugenics movement in America and beyond in the 1930s and 1940s. Her views and those of her peers in the movement contributed to compulsory sterilization laws in 30 U.S. states that resulted in more than 60,000 sterilizations of vulnerable people,
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Luckily, she wasn't pregnant?!?! (¬∞Ôæõ¬∞*)!!	Are you saying forced sterilization of the intellectually disabled is right &amp; just? (¬∫–¥¬∫)		Eugenics is the progenitor of abortion. Margaret Sanger, founder of PP, was a eugenics enthusiast bc she knew abortion &amp; eugenics go hand-in-hand.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Natural Law is not the law of nature, although it is common to confuse the 2. They're 2 entirely diff things. Not enough data to comment on that poor girl's fate. The underlying assumption you make is had her child lived, it would've been worse. Why? Do you have evidence of that?
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The worst thing to do is decide on emotion or on the basis of personal or political ideology. That's why my stance is pragmatism &amp; logic, which is the core of the Natural Law. If we can save 2 lives, let's do it.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Drs will need to evaluate the 11 yo first &amp; foremost. You can't just give drugs or do surgery willy-nilly. Abortifacient drugs are designed for adults &amp; have known risks in adults.  Their use on kids is not established. An abortion could result in sterility or death.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The best that can be hoped for is that the 11 yo child is surrounded by people who show her love &amp; empathy, who value both her &amp; her baby &amp; who help her in processing such unimaginable horror &amp; tragedy while making a decision that validates both children's lives.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump She may feel revictimized. Her innocence was taken by force &amp; then her child was taken by force.  As Bernadette rightly noted, the 11 yo is forced to acquiesce bc she's a child &amp; can't fully process the complexities &amp; consequences at that stage.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The 11 yo herself will be forced to do w/e the adults say &amp; live w/the consequences of the adults' decision. In adulthood, that same 11 yo may speak of the trauma of being given an abortion &amp; of preferring to have let the child in utero live. She may feel guilt over it.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Abortifacient drugs are de factocadult drugs. They're tested on adults. There's risk. With surgery, whether c-section or abortion, there's risk. The adults involved in care should opt for the safest course of action to preserve the life &amp; health both children in their care.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump I've answered the Q multiple times. It's just not an answer that jives w/your point of view. The best approach is to remember the 11 yo is the victim &amp; so is her child in utero.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump It discusses Roe &amp; other SCOTUS decisions, past &amp; presnt. Really good primer on Natural Law &amp; U.S. Constitutional Law.

It was designed for 1st year law students in the U.S. who are basically newbies fresh out of college.		https://t.co/gtJnhGXFtG
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump An in-depth study of Natural Law answers those questions. We're bound to obey the positive law (i.e. man-made law) or else (i.e. fines, jail, etc.). Man-made laws are as flawed as the humans that make them, but the closer they mirror natural law, the more logical &amp; just they are.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Sadly, that's reality. I've worked in family law too &amp; it awful.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Do you now see the fundamental injustice written in man-made laws? In man-made laws, the is always a winner &amp; a loser. And the winners &amp; losers are chosen by folks who usually have something to gain from making the choice, i.e. lobbyist $, reelection, more power, etc.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump And, both her &amp; her child are treated as cattle to the slaughter. The 21 yo in the other hypo can do to her child in utero what the law does to the 11yo &amp; her in utero child. She can act according to man-made law or break it, according to the natural law or in defiance of it.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump I don't think u follow. The law is saying she, as a minor, has no voice, can't make the decision &amp; is at the mercy of adults forcing her into an abortion or c-section. The 11 yo in your hypo is entirely a victim &amp; as helpless as the child in her womb. That's what the law says.

@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump To put it plainly, best approach to regulating natural law rights is for govt to be subjected to the most stringest standard of  judicial review. A rational, balanced approach to gun policy ensues when govt must prove a compelling, narrowly tailored interest for its intervention.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump So, my position is in favor of strict scrutiny for gun control laws since they target an inalienable, natural law right: the right to self-defense. Any laws passed under a less stringent standard should be brought up for review under the strict scrutiny standard.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump regulations on a core, inalieable right, in this case the right to bear arms. This is called "Strict Scrutiny." It is the most stringent standard of judicial review used by U.S. Courts. If govt passes the test, the law is constitutional.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump In U.S. Const. Law, the govt may wish to this inalieable right for reasons that may be entirely rational. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) &amp; similar have resulted in Courts demanding govt must prove it has a compelling, narrowly tailored interest to impose
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump My stance is grounded in Natural Law, facts, evidence &amp; principles of U.S. Constitutional Law. 		We humans have the inalienable, natural law right to self-defense. Whether it be w/bare hands or man-made weapons, the right to save our own lives when attacked is indisputable.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @bhughes06548766 @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump In your scenario, if I understood correctly, the baby had passed but was not ejecting natually, so medical intervention was req'd to bring the baby out &amp; make sure you were safe from developing infection. That is completely unrelated to intentionally killing a child in utero.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The govt compels her to pay taxes, buy health ins, ease up on the gas pedal. She's already forced to engage in many behaviors against her will to avoid fines &amp; jail. If govt adds not killing her own child in utero to that list, tho, suddenly the govt is intrusive? No. It's not.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Ultimately, no one has the right to take another human's life. The law gives the 21 yo the absolute power of life &amp; death over the child in utero, a body that's not her own, but the positive law upon which that power is premised is derived from a legal fiction, not Natural Law.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump A woman's life is not over bc she has a child, regardless of how the child was conceived &amp; whether she was planned. Again, the child in utero is as much a victim as the 21 yo. Being conceived in rape was not her fault &amp; is no reason to kill her.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The 21 yo here needs support: mental, medical &amp; financial &amp; there are plenty non-profits that provide it. She can still finish college &amp; have a career. She can put the child up for adoption if she doesn't want to raise her herself.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Having a child is not an impediment to getting a degree. At 21 she'd be a junior in college if she was taking full loads. Most of us who worked through college took 5-6 yrs to finish bc we didn't have someone paying our tuition &amp; costs.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump And to be clear: the 11 yo was not refused the abortion. Her legal guardian was. The LG calls the shots. We don't know if the 11 yo even understood the implications of surgical abortion &amp; if she didn't want it but was having it forced on her. She has no voice under the law.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The 11 yo is barred by law from being her own child's legal guardian, so an adult will be appointed. It's tragic. It's a cruel world. But there are options that don't involve killing.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The go-to, knee-jerk reaction is to kill, which says a lot about the state of humanity. But, I digress. The 11 yo is undrgoing surgery no matter what. If  c-section is chosen &amp; the child in utero survives, she can be adopted out or kept by the 11 yo's family.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump &amp; her body invaded again &amp; it's the adult that calls the shots. So, seeing that the 11 yo's fate is sealed, let's give a thought to the child in utero. To kill or not to kill, that is the question.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump At this point the choice is forcing the 11 yo to undergo 1 of 2 invasive procedures under general anesthesia so as not to further traumatize her. An abortion is an invasive medical procedure. So is a c-section. Both procedures are surgery. In either scenario, the child is drugged
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump I'm not keen on repeating myself.  I've read several of those stories. In such rare, horrific scenarios, the abused child &amp; the child in utero are both victims. The 11 yo, by law, has no right to decide the outcome. Her legal guardian calls the shots. Now what are the options?

@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump Actually, studies show a mentality shift, at least in the U.S. on abortion, w/more &amp; more rejecting abortion as an option. Roe v. Wade galvanized opinion &amp; ended up causing a backlash against abortion. BC wasn't the precipitating factor. Things are probably different in Aust.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Aust is Aust. America is America. Each country has its own positives &amp; negatives. You sound like you're happy to be in Aust &amp; proud to be Aust. It's good that you're happy where you live &amp; have pride in your country.
@TheEternalAbys @bhughes06548766 @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump Pregnancy is indeed a natural biological process.

@TheEternalAbys @bhughes06548766 @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump True, the father is deprived of any rights under U.S. abortion law. He cannot have his child aborted. He cannot stop his child from being aborted. He is devoid of rights over the child in utero. No sense to demand responsibility from men when they've been stripped of all rights.

@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Abortion is not self-defense. So taking a life in utero is not justified.

@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The natural law right to self-defense is written into the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as well as in other laws &amp; charters, such as into the text of UN Charter article 51.		https://t.co/tza8aijeNY

@TheEternalAbys @bhughes06548766 @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump Agreed. The hardcore 1960s &amp; 70s pro-aborts are in rapid decline. Today, the youger gens see Roe's based on bad, outdated science &amp; cannot fathom taking a child's life in utero given the incontrovertible scientific evidence that the child in utero is human &amp; separate from mom.

@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump That's fine. Australia can do as it pleases. The majority of Americans don't want to go on Medicare or Medicaid.

@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump Actually, no. The right of the people to defend themselves from their govt means the people's fire power needs to match that of the govt. The govt doesn't use muskets anymore. They've upgraded. It follows that the people have upgraded so they stand a fighting chance.
@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump At any point in time, the govt through its judiciary branch can overturn Roe v. Wade &amp; compel a woman to carry a child to term, as it was pre-Roe. The govt has the power to do this. That's why there is ongoing debate in the U.S. over how much power to grant the govt.
@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump The right and power of a government to enforce its decisions and compel obedience is known as "authority." The govt compels behavior through threat &amp; enforcement of punishment. This is how they get us to pay taxes, stop speeding, buy Obamacare, etc.

@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump That said, that's a good point you bring up, Bernadette. The U.S. is a unique country w/a Constitution like no other that enshrines among other things, the right of the people to bear arms to defend themselves against their own govt. It really is unlike anything out there.
@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump There's been a push by politicians on hard Left to make Medicare universal &amp; abolish Medicaid, employer &amp; free market ins.

@bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @klairsara @realDonaldTrump That's how the MSM couches it. The reality is different on the ground.

Why do you insist ending life is the best &amp; only solution? It is not. Natural death is always better than an artificially induced death for both the child &amp; for her mother's physical &amp; mental health.

@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump An ad hominem argument is not an argument, but rather an admission of defeat. Suffering is inevitable, whether the child is killed or dies naturally &amp; pregnancy is not a pathology. An abortion doesn't magically make suffering disappear.

Women have always received treatment by Drs or midwives.
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump "Prior to legalization, 90 percent of illegal abortions were done by physicians.[2] Most of the remainder were done by nurses, midwives or others with at least some medical training."
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Since the days of the Ancient Greeks, midwives did it at the woman's house. Throughout the ages, all over the world that was the norm. The term "back alley" abortion is a recent invention. 	 https://t.co/xWXi2TFp5t
@klairsara @bhughes06548766 @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry for your loss. That must have been devastating. I can't comment on your case since I don't know all the details. However, I am aware sometimes the deceased child is not ejected naturally &amp; the mother requires assistance through inducement, D&amp;C or medication to eject.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump Truth be told, there's never a medical necessity for it. Sanger herself admitted to that, openly promoting it for eugenics purposes. So, I will have to respectfully disagree.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The backyard abortion myth's been debunked. You need to do your research .
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Abortion is a huge money-making machine. That's what the political ads are all about, what the suppressing of data on the number of women left sterile or dead by abortions: securing tax money. Take out the incentive &amp; everyone will bail. They couldn't care less about women.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump The science isn't there yet, as you've made clear &amp; misdiagnosis is common. That's why it's best to leave it to nature. The mechanism's already built in. Why this burning desire to inject saline, provoke cardiac arrest, dismember? What's the incentive? Money. It's a biz.
@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump Backyard abortions are  a myth. Midwives have always been trained in providing abortions, it was an open secret, &amp; the medical community couldn't care less until they realized midwives were cutting into their profits. Hence the changes in laws.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump I disagree, but you are entitled to your opinion.

@bhughes06548766 @klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @realDonaldTrump We currently are nothing but a bunch of cells &amp; DNA can be damaged at any stage of development - from conception to old age. DNA damage is, in fact, occurring to our cells all the time. The distinction is insignificant.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump And no one should've been forced to pay for Obama's golf trips if they didn't vote for him either. 		That's a valid argument. 		Why are we forced to pay for stuff we don't want? Bc the law forces us to. If we don't, IRS comes after us. They can fine folks, send them to jail.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump Given that most miscarriages happen in 1st trimester, pretty early, a lot of children w/severe defects die before Drs can even confirm the presence of severe defects. Nature has a way of dealing w/problems w/o requiring humans meddling with everything.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump My position is let nature take its course, in utero or outside. Drs misdiagnose defects too often. Unreliable. So, there must be no cut off point. Most severe cases, where the child is incompatible w/life, usually end naturally in miscarriage or stillbirth, so it resolves itself.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump According to your principle that "No one should be forced to do what they don't want to" every taxpayer has a say as to whether tax $ should be used to pay for abortion, so every taxpayer's opinion matters, including mine. You've proven that it does matter what I think. Thank u.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump You say "No one should be forced to do something they don't want to do."		The child in utero is being forced to do something she doesn't want to do: die a violent &amp; often painful death.		Taxpayer are being forced to something they don't want to do: pay to end the child's life.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump There's lots of evil in this world that happens, that we can stop. Rapes, murders, abuse, etc. Yes, it's going to happen bc humans are capable of brutality. To cheer it on, fund it, condone it or remain silent in the face of unspeakable horrors is what perpetuates evil.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump I'm bent on the facts. Your body is not your mother's body. It never was, it never will be. The law may tell your mother she has absolute power over your body while you're inside her, but truth is, it's your body she's deciding take the life from, not her own body.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump As for watching the baby die, in the olden days only Drs &amp; midwives saw the child &amp; remained w/child until she naturally died. They never took the child to the mother unless the mother asked for the child. Undertaker was then called &amp; child sealed in casket, given proper burial.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump Usually such defects are confirmed later in pregnancy, making it even more dangerous. Yes, mom should be advised to take safest course of action &amp; generally that's leaving the child where she is until her mother's body naturally ejects her. Why risk sterility or mom's death?
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump A 12 yo by law has a legal guardian making decisions for her. She's as helpless as the child in the womb. The grown-ups decide what is done w/her body.	A child w/severe birth defects can be born naturally. Artificial, forced extraction carries serious health risks for the mother.
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump I provided the stats. Extremely rare occurrences due to various causes, incl. med mal, pre-existing condition, etc., are not an argument for abortion. Many woman have ended up sterile or dead after abortion. It's a myth that it's safer than pregnacy.		https://t.co/nahRoVbKFa
@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump By giving absolute power to your mother, you are disenfranchising yourself &amp; stating that you must be denied your right to choose whether to be born in spite of birth defects, being product of rape, etc. Whose rights should prevail?

@klairsara @TheEternalAbys @19jess35 @bhughes06548766 @realDonaldTrump And that's exactly why the maternal mortality argument is a strawman. It's simply a side argument injected into the abortion debate to detract from the actual crux of the debate: whether your mother has the absolute right to end your life before you have any say.

In any case, arguments for reparations prolly made more sense in Lincoln's day. Freed slaves were logical beneficiaries, former owners the logical payers. Like after the Shoah, pmt beneficiaries were survivors &amp; immediate heirs of deceased &amp; payers were the folks actually there.
There'd have to be an arbitrary timeframe &amp; geographic location imposed. Folks who didn't become American, returning to UK after the Revolutionary War, &amp; whose descendents are in UK were never under U.S. jurisdiction, but English jurisdiction throughout. UK'd have to contribute.
On a related note, it'd be a nightmare to trace everyone's ancestry to determine who owes who &amp; how much. Black Africans sold fellow Black Africans to English, Spaniards, etc. doing commerce w/the New World where slaves were then bought/sold/kept by Whites, Blacks, Natives, etc.
Ditto. A lot of us came here post-WWII or later &amp; our ancestors had no connection to the slave trade at any point in history according to genealogical research. Why should we be expected to pay for other people's sins? https://t.co/cU0PEVKZQg

@FrDarinSchmidt My assessment is that there's far more to that story than reported. The article is very sympathetic to the Saginaw priest &amp; singles out some parishoners. However, there seems to be much more to that story.		My tweets are in response to the comment thread spawned by the article.
The language barrier is &amp; remains the biggest impediment. The common adage "The Tridentine Mass is universal:  you could go anywhere in the world and not understand what was going on." has little to do w/parts &amp; everything to do w/the language barrier.
That said, knowing the parts does very little to help folks follow Mass in a foreign language. They can figure more or less where they're at in the liturgy, but they're not understanding what's being said &amp; can't pray along. So, bothering to learn the parts is insufficient.
Granted most folks do not have an in-depth knowledge of the parts of the Mass. They don't know the terminology for each part (Introit, Doxology, etc.) or the theology. And that's a failure on the clergy's part. It is the clergy's responsibility to instruct.
The intro of Latin &amp; Gregorian chant, however, does affect people's ability to follow at Mass. Folks either remain silent during Latin parts or butcher them w/o fully comprehending the meaning of the words they're butchering. If entire Mass is Latin, following is even harder.
This fact is highlighted in the article that spawned these comments. Of the changes introduced by the Saginaw priest, the use of Latin was the most transformative. Adding bells &amp; changing the altar boys' dress code, in fact, doesn't affect the people's ability to follow Mass.
This despite the majority having a general grasp of the parts. Even w/a booklet on hand w/the full text, following Mass in a foreign language is  an arduous task.		 Therefore, the impediment to understanding the parts of the Holy Mass is &amp; remains the language barrier.
The TLM &amp; NO essentially mirror each other, w/TLM having more repetition &amp; extended prayers. The difference is not as radical as some would like to make it out to be.		The further away liturgical language is from the local vernacular, however, the harder it is to follow the Mass.
.@FranktheMc2 duly noted that "One thing a priest told me that's true about the Tridentine Mass.  It was universal:  I could go anywhere in the world and not understand what was going on."		The chief complaint w/liturgy has never been understanding the parts of the Holy Mass. https://t.co/KgE8bFTXYu

Quid prodest strepitus oris muto corde?		(St Augustine, In Io. Ev. tr. 9, 13)
So, it would behoove the clergy &amp; Latin Mass enthusiasts to properly learn Latin themselves before expecting others to.		Most of all, focusing on language when liturgical abuses &amp; sacrilege abound in both TLM &amp; NO is counterproductive. Reverence &amp; prayer must be taught first.
The congregation is a mix of folks silent &amp; passive bc they don't know Latin &amp; of zealous traditionalists butchering Latin alongside the priest. 		The mispronunciations can be grating &amp; hilarious at the same time.		The butchering of the liturgy, however, is irreverent.
Truth is there's no learning Latin at church. Latin is invariably butchered by traditionalist clergy at Holy Mass. Thick American accents &amp; poor diction &amp; pronunciation are cringe-inducing. The readings are left in vernacular. Then back to buthering the Latin liturgy.
So they all could understand &amp; pray.		At Holy Mass, instead, folks remained in silence. They did not pray at Holy Mass. They were forced into passivity.		People should be encouraged to pray &amp; to pray often &amp; that is not happening at both TLM &amp; NO Holy Mass today.
St. Francis composed his prayers in the vernacular.		Our Lady of Lourdes prayed the Rosary w/St. Bernadette in the vernacular.		Our Lady of Guadalupe spoke to St. Juan Diego in the vernacular.		Why?
And it wasn't bc they couldn't be bothered to learn. Literacy was not widespread &amp; only the wealthy could pay for instruction to learn Latin. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, in fact, Latin was the language of the erudite elite. The masses spoke only the local vernacular.
In post-WWII Italy, for ex., many souls cried out for intro of vernacular liturgy bc they wanted to understand God's Word &amp; they wanted to pray to God at Holy Mass. Only the elite could pray in Latin. The majority was barred from understanding &amp; praying at Holy Mass.
With all due respect, Fr., the underlying assumption that those who did not learn did not "bother to" is a huge &amp; fairly condescending  assumption to make. Majority had no accesss to Latin instr., which was purview of the wealthy elite, &amp; literacy not widespread until recently. https://t.co/MnsyBMJ4rO

Verdict: Not climate change. 		Reports attributing extinction to climate change are: 		#FakeNews	#FakeScience	#JustAnotherHoax
"It is this author‚Äôs opinion that the human contribution to their extinction is limited to the utter inadequacy of the Recovery Plan for the Bramble Cay Melomys, Melomys rubicola prepared by Peter Latch in 2008."		i.e: Failure to start captive breeding prgm when pop. # dwindled.
"The official cause ‚Äî climate change ‚Äì is speculative and partially based on predictions of future sea level rise and future increased storminess and intensity of storms."
"Bramble Cay suffered at least one (Spring 2014)  or more (or a series of) weather events that inundated the island[.]"		[I]t is doubtful that there were in fact any remaining melomys at that late date.  No melomys had been official recorded on Bramble since 2004."
"The main contributing factor to this degradation is the success of other species, primarily the Green Turtle and various sea birds, ... which resulted in increasing  disturbance and destruction of the vegetation required by the melomys for survival."
"The area of the cay that supports vegetation, the main source of shelter and food for the melomys, has been shrinking since 1998, down to less than 10% of the 1998 area in 2014."
"Their extirpation was almost certainly caused by environmental degradation resulting from the very nature of Bramble Cay as a ‚Äúgeologically temporary..[island]..of considerable instability""	https://t.co/fpFNO4Z7J7

‚öñÔ∏è Lex mala, lex nulla ‚öñÔ∏è - A bad law is no law. (St. Thomas Aquinas)		Bad laws have been passed &amp; repealed. Humans are fallible. Keeping an open mind, identfying author biases &amp; potential gains &amp; thinking critically results in more logical &amp; consistent laws.		Thanks for reading.
Finally, financial gain is often the impetus for passing laws. Legislators will suspend their intellect and orgs will lobby in order to profit. This is where data that stands in the way of profits gets censored &amp; the semantics games begin.
In order to overcome such arbitrary &amp; inconsistent results, debates on matters of law &amp; terminology must be grounded in science, logic &amp;, therefore, the Natural Law.		Having blind faith in philosophies &amp; ideologies impedes critical thinking &amp; produces bad &amp; inconsistent laws.
Slavery laws, on the other hand, denied that African adults &amp; children were human, in clear defience of logic &amp; science.	In other words, "ideas" &amp; philosophical debates on matters of law &amp; semantics  have proven to be inconsistent &amp; arbitrary.
Each of the above phases has, in fact, been subjected to these debates. Estate law recognizes the embryo &amp; fetus as a human person for purposes of inheritance. Criminal statutes idem, thereby allowing 2 charges when the victim is a pregnant woman: homicide &amp; feticide.
The scientific capability to ID human DNA &amp; confirm that each human has his/her own unique DNA distinct from his/her parents exposes the debate as to "when foetuses become human" as the result of a reliance on faith in "ideas," to the exclusion of science, evidence &amp; logic.
The law can actually choose any one of those phases &amp; state that a human being was not human before that stage. And, throughout the course of history, it has done so. However, it is arbitrary &amp; illogical given current science.
recognize that a human being is such &amp; has rights. A human being goes through various stages of development (embryonic, fetal, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adult, elderly, death).
It is a proven scientific fact that a human being can only reproduce a human being &amp; that a human does not change species or DNA to "become" human at one stage of development instead of another. The cited debate is, therefore, grounded in semantics &amp; law, i.e. when the law should
Thank u for the link. Having read it, I can say w/certainty their are logical fallacies in that argument. The first is encapsuled in this statement: "which has altered ideas about when foetuses become human beings with human rights" https://t.co/hUg08vsVV2
@chrislowndes @Spencer_MOOD @hooahzach @peterjtromp @NathanielDunn17 @ChristianO0214 @FocusCheryl @IlhanMN That's a strawman. Its etymology is Latin meaning "offspring" or "child." Medical professionals know (or should know) this when using the term in medical journal. Politics have led to the censoring of the etymology of the word.  The plebs must be kept ignorant.
@chrislowndes @Spencer_MOOD @hooahzach @peterjtromp @NathanielDunn17 @ChristianO0214 @FocusCheryl @IlhanMN *does not change science
@chrislowndes @Spencer_MOOD @hooahzach @peterjtromp @NathanielDunn17 @ChristianO0214 @FocusCheryl @IlhanMN Roe v. Wade is based on 45 yo science &amp; NY law defies logic &amp; science. Prenatal, perinatal &amp; neonatal medicine is light years away from what SCOTUS based itself on way back in the dark ages (1973).		Current laws should, at a bare minimum, be based on logic &amp; the latest science.
@chrislowndes @Spencer_MOOD @hooahzach @peterjtromp @NathanielDunn17 @ChristianO0214 @FocusCheryl @IlhanMN The origin of the word is therefore,  often obscured, either out of ignorance or a willful act driven by a political agenda.	In any case, fetus is the Latin word for "child" or "offspring."		Ultimately, the war of semantics waged on the political stage does change science.
@chrislowndes @Spencer_MOOD @hooahzach @peterjtromp @NathanielDunn17 @ChristianO0214 @FocusCheryl @IlhanMN Etymology is the origin &amp; history of the word.		Fetus is Latin. It means "child," "offspring." 		British English spelling: foetus	American English spelling: fetus		Granted some dictionaries do not include etymology &amp; only define the word based on standards known only to them.

St. Peter's Basilica proves it can be done &amp; that it enhances the experience for everyone involved.		Side note: I'm glad Fr. Matthew chose the priesthood despite the actions of one rude priest. Some people stop going to church altogether over negative experiences. My best to him.
At St. Peter's Basilica, staff give folks a shawl to cover themselves to enforce the dress code. I once saw them approach a tourist lying on the floor to take pics &amp; made her get up off the floor. They were firm, civilized &amp; reverent all at once.
In other words, be pragmatic. Use common sense. And to priests, use your resources. Properly train ushers or designated church volunteers &amp; encourage them to be assertive.
The whole family doesn't have to be at the same Mass at the same time, esp. when an infant or very small child is not 100% up for it. One parent can go to the 10am, the other at 12pm. If only 1 parent, arrange for a sitter &amp; go to earliest Mass, which tends to be short.
Finally, too many times I've seen parents making their infants  miserable by taking them to Mass (or stores or other public places) when they don't have to. This is esp. true when child is sick or suffers from colic. There's no justification for it.
Parents can do the same. Sit near the exit. Go out into the vestibule or even your car if necessary. Then come back once the situation is resolved.		This is common sense.		And reserving pews near exits is not hard to do.
Ex. I know a disabled lady who sits near the exits so she can step out &amp; pace in the vestbule w/o causing disruption or distracting the priest when her back pain becomes unbearable.		Problems arise when the pews near exits are taken by folks who don't need easy access to exits.
The ushers can also help parents by seating them near exits, so it's a quick dash out the door to quickly resolve the disruption. 		Cry rooms, a fairly recent invention, make things worse. Better for the pastor to simply reserve pews near exits for parents &amp; others in need.
There are ushers at Mass, just standing around.  Why aren't they trained to assist the priest w/disruptions during Mass. The ushers are right there next to the pews &amp; don't have to interrupt Mass from the altar to approach the parent &amp; politely accompany him or her outside.
While priests need to provide guidance &amp; educate parishoners on how to conduct themselves at Mass &amp; how to handle disruptive kids, interrupting a homily to tell off a parent is crude &amp; irreverent toward sacredness of Mass. There are civilized ways to handle disruptions at Mass. https://t.co/Pptd9xwWRA

Kids' behavior is a reflection of the parents. So, parents, take responsibility &amp; raise your standards.		You had a failing today? Take responsibility, then reassess, raise the bar &amp; try again.		Just don't expect everyone else to take responsibility for you. The burden is on you. https://t.co/TKm9kKmRJt
However, shifting the burden onto priests, parishoners, airplane passengers or shoppers, etc. is simply a cop-out.		Adults need to act like adults &amp; take responsibility. Not whine like 2 yo that they're getting the stink eye when their kids misbehave, disrupt or injure folks.
Parents bear the burden to instruct &amp; model. Children crave guidance &amp; thrive w/in a clear &amp; consistent structure.		Parents need to set higher standards for themselves &amp; their children &amp; take responsibility for their own failings. 		Instead, the trend is to shift the burden.
Same thing for air travel, stores, etc. Parents only told me once how to behave &amp; never had to tell me again. My parents were consistent &amp; they modeled the behavior they expected from their kids. They set reasonably high standards &amp; it was rewarding to meet their expectations.
My parents only told me once how to behave in church. They never had to repeat it again. I never ate, played, chattered, left my parents' side etc. at Mass. Instead, I followed along, responded, kneeled &amp; prayed. If I could do it, tiny as I was, any kid can.
And priests too terrified to say anything or actually encouraging dangerous or disruptive behaviors at Mass by both adults &amp; children. 		Adults need to be adults, take responsibility for their kids &amp; set age-appropriate boundaries for them
I've been to Masses w/a woman disrupting several pews of parishoners with her breastfeeding, kids running around as prishoners come in - very dangerous as I've seen unruly kids crash into &amp; injure the elderly in public  - &amp; kids simply screaming for the entire duration of Mass.
I have been at Masses w/toddlers running around the alter &amp; throwing the altar chair pillow about, diapers being changed at or behind the pews during Holy Communion, children eating, chattering &amp; hitting each other throughout, while smug or indifferrent parents look on, etc.
Sadly for the lady, the priest was right so long as he was polite about it. The burden is on the parent to anticipate the child's needs &amp; sit near the exit so he or she can step outside to do their duty as a parent.		It is very bad that priests no longer give guidance on conduct. https://t.co/AURYdxGbHL

@WARRIORBUSH @LegaSalvini @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Il ministro ha il dovere di proteggere la nazione e i suoi cittadini. Adempiendo al suo dovere non e' seminare odio.
