@spectatorindex Erdogan is not better than Saddam,Assad and Rouhani
@AFP an old dream that never comes true
We all knew this going to happen after #Trump announced the pullout. 	Heavy clashes breakout between Turkish-backed rebels, Kurdish forces near border-town https://t.co/mo4grXQjUK via @thearabsource
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS traitor!
@realDonaldTrump Traitor!
@WSJ who is the editor,i mean the idiot? ISIS is far the Turkey's border just 200 km away!
@PressSec A president is not worthy of being praised while he has never visited troops.
@jimsciutto It was a bad decision but Trump wakes up when Iran hurt Israel through Hizbulla and Hamas plus Erdogan's annihilation of Kurds. I doubt simply this won't be a trap to separate Erdogan from Russia's policy.
@TabloIbrahem sure thing, hold her hand and help her.
@realDonaldTrump You can't have it both: from one side saying we have defeated ISIS while Brett McGurk was leading the coalitions against ISIS and at the same time you accuse him of being a man who supported Iranian regime by loading up airplanes with cash!
@LindseyGrahamSC Few options or scenarios may emerge, disharmony of relation between Russia,Syria and Turkey, or Trump leaves behind a trap for Turkey to align her with his policies in the area.
@Saraabim horrible
@realDonaldTrump You want only one wall, but I think you need 4 walls.
@saraasar54 should we run away from them?
@realDonaldTrump By Turkey?Iran?or Syria?. Better stop tweeting and act as a real president.
@realDonaldTrump 4 walls and an iron net for you is perfect
Congratulations !! ISIS nasheed , massive convoy towards Manbij. #Syria #Kurds  #Turkey https://t.co/y8iGASqvNh
@LindseyGrahamSC @SaraDawo94 Let's see how Iran harasses Israel and Erdogan annihilates Kurds!
@shanya_am love it
@JZarif Please stop praising while no one is happy in Iran
@sybarzinji heartbreaking,so sorry to hear that
@Khaaasteh he was a bad man, killed so many innocent people, Allah put him in hell ,enshalla
@krassenstein @SaraDawo94 Even Trump left Israel behind, the area now is dominated by Iran, Russia and Turkey, by the way, Hamas and Hizbulla get much support to hurt Israel further and Kurds will be annihilated massively by Erdogan.
@HoshangMohamed @WarrMartyn Hi Hoshang, it is excellent, keep up the good work
@mahsti25metana1 horrible
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul then your efforts regarding Iran are useless and no need to make yourself tired.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Erdogan annihilates Kurds as you have mentioned them as great people, your Mr. Kurd!
@Ahmadinejad1956 @realDonaldTrump war with Iran inevitable
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul you want just to get rid of the government, an acting administration finally.

@Scrounger1000 @netanyahu @JackPosobiec wrong
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Really disappointed to have expanded Trade with anti-Semitic dictator,Erdogan!
@emprestheodora exactly
@realDonaldTrump simple question, when does he leave similar to Mattis and McGurk?
RT @AfrinsNotAlone: #France's #Macron says deeply regrets #Trump decision on troops in #Syria		“To be Allies is to Fight Shoulder to Should…
@srway_ sounds fair openly
@netanyahu @JackPosobiec US pullout was a grave mistake, Iran and Turkey will support Hamas and Hizbulla, their only goal is to conquer Jerusalem and annihilate Jewish people. TIME TO TAKE ACTION, MR PRESIDENT.
The first day I joined #twitter ,I tweeted that #Erdogan of #Turkey is anti-Semitic dictator. https://t.co/KYAAM0iMX9

@parosh_aiub hhhh
@realDonaldTrump he resigned not his term up to a stop, due to your Syria pullout, security of Israel and US ally Kurds are in danger.
@realDonaldTrump Is accuracy guaranteed in term of not having a negative impact of the pullout? specifically, security of Israel and US ally,Kurds. If not guaranteed, then better to resign such as McGurck and Jim Mattis.
@dannydanon @LePoint @JZarif Danon, let's be a little bit wise over this, US withdrawal benefits Iranian regime only similar to Iraq case which has been handed over to Iran. Now Israel State has been circled by Hamas, Iran,Syria and Hizbulla and even US ally,Kurds , are at the brink of elimination by Erdogan
@paveehh excellent
@s__lst please stop it , we are all Kurds, not only south of Kurdistan but all, north,west and east!
@mahsti25metana1 source?, thanks
@GalesMeandro @IsraeliPM Erdogan is dictator and killing Kurds. Kurds do not hate Turks but hate Erdogan, a facist man! end of the story.
@ulviakarcay @amberinzaman @Telegraph You are not American why do you lie? you are a stupid Turk,end of the story
@CaptainBillyBas @leethurman @Dr_HawzhinAzeez At this catastrophic moment, exactly when we are at the brink of elimination by dictator Erdogan, no need for us to lament or outcry, we have suffered a lot in Iraq,Iran,Turkey and Iran. What need to do is to find a way of survival and getting support from others.
@mallison1414 yes,true
@IsraeliPM Do something to protect Kurds in Syria and eliminate Iranian presence over there. The pullout was a grave mistake.
@sybarzinji Unfortunately internal hatred is quite visible that destroyed most of the Kurds
#Kurds are quite different from #Erdogan thinking. https://t.co/sQp9jsiK4c
@realDonaldTrump Iran remains there, is that threat Ok to be active near Israel?.
@cfpierce Erdogan is a dictator, he has supported Hamas leaders in Turkey against Israel.
RT @SenRubioPress: Earlier, I joined @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss why the President’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from #Syria is…
@amberinzaman @Telegraph we are a nation of over 40 millions of Kurds, we have been annihilated by regimes of Turkey, Syria,Iran and Iraq frequently. We all are Kurds for one purpose,A Free Kurdish Viable State.
Finally a good news . #Turkey #Syria https://t.co/0LCoP052Gr
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/3cxeSpnR4U
@realDonaldTrump This is his resignation not retiring! https://t.co/ulYtDbSAyJ
@itssvvee u r not alone, that is totally gross
@realDonaldTrump Syria withdrawal is a precious gift of Christmas to Russia and a redrose to Iran.
@amberinzaman After Iran is Turkey, change should happen, today not? tomorrow maybe
@LindseyGrahamSC After US withdrawal, Erdogan annihilates Kurds in Syria and Iran refuels Hizbulla to an extent that they pose a great menace to Israel security.
@1rogueguy @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Simple, incapable of leadership
@realDonaldTrump grave mistake, no need for finding justification.
@marklevinshow Even Hizbulla does not need tunnels anymore because Iran can easily transfer weapons into Lebanon. Turkish military commanders planning to make a gencide against Kurds, US ally.
@HeshmatAlavi @almostjingo @drawandstrike @DebbieAAldrich @SecStudiesGrp @HNIJohnMiller @LVNancy @ClareMLopez @steph93065 @GeorgWebb @GaetaSusan Putin stops Trump from doing any action against Iran such as we have seen it in Syria withdrawal
@ulviakarcay @CaptainBillyBas @realDonaldTrump fuck off filth Turk
@AllaPayadar wow, nice place
@realDonaldTrump @drawandstrike ISIS resurgence is inevitable due to give Turkey greenlight into Syria and US withdrawal.
@MajeedGly @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Horrible data
@heveen7 ئەم ناشیرینە چی ئەڵێ؟
@shanya_am is that she?🤨
@kilmeade Brian, we have lost trust there, Kurds as ally and Israel as main interest. IRAN is happy now in Syria
@ReutersIran But US handed over Syria to Iran
@LindseyGrahamSC US withdrawal leaves a grave opportunity to Iran and Turkey in posing danger to Israel as they support Hamas and Hizbulla, US main ally ,Kurds will be annihilated by Erdogan.
@Joyce_Karam Similar to Iraq case, Kurds get statehood in Iran,Syria and Iran- a slow move but on the international table. France leads and other west countries support gradually,not now but started already.
@JZarif Yalda is beauty and happiness, did you leave a space for people to live happily?!!
@marklevinshow Hizbulla,hamas ,Syria and Iran circled around Israel, on the other side Erdogan annihilates US allies in Syria. Grave mistake by Trump.
@Sanasallayy2 agar change color bbwaya ba Miss Kurdistan chi abu🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump Then no need to change the regime in Iran!!!

@amberinzaman There is a game here, let's wait a little bit more, Bibi called Trump today and no statements yet
@LindseyGrahamSC @marklevinshow US allies are at big stake, Israel, Kurds and other local partners. Iran has started transferring weapons this late evening time (local time) into Deralzur
@realDonaldTrump and what are you doing in Afghanistan and Iraq?

@D_abdulkader then why leave Syria?
@AmbJohnBolton You have just handed over Syria to Iran which is the biggest threat to Israel. congratulations
@LindseyGrahamSC Is there any gurantee that Erdogan does not attack Kurdish nation over there.
#Iran has transferred weapons to some locations in #Syria , two persons have been arrested over taking photos of the convey. https://t.co/9pjulovAoY
@LindseyGrahamSC The move puts Israel security at stake
@RosLehtinen @EvaDuranRamos Iran prepares herself for Israel
@LahavHarkov This is totally dangerous for Israel
@Dr_HawzhinAzeez @negar_cello This is a disaster to Israel as well,not only the kurds alone
@IsraeliZara @masoud_barzani thank you
@Musakan21 @olembogo @ca11iopE @AmichaiStein1 You are lying totally, monster!
@marcorubio Israel is at stake and Iran gets closer after the US retreat announcement
@realDonaldTrump But Russia announced victory even before you announce the pull out
@JenGriffinFNC @mutludc and the door is open now for Iran just few kilometers away from Israel
@realDonaldTrump what is your response if Erdogan annihilates Kurds in Syria?. No answer
@AP Iran can be a great threat to Israel in Syria, Turkey as well to annihilate the Kurdish nation in Syria.
#Houthi missile battalion fired missiles towards Saudi army positions last night, let's wait Iran, Hizbulla and Turkey doing the same in Syria after US withdrawal from #Syria .
@CrissCrosse thanks
@This_is_Sheelan awesome
@IsraeliPM Hizbulla no more needs the tunnels because they are free to move to Syria after US withdrawal, Iran as well.
#Iran gets the main benefits from this and Turkish army is open-handed in killing kurds. https://t.co/CDRas5MaHz
@realDonaldTrump , this is the support you have mentioned during the press conference when you called the journalist Mr.Kurd?. @LindseyGrahamSC is right that you made the wrong decision. https://t.co/An7zCdyYm7
@Reuters @AbuJamajem Finally Turkish army collapses as the west and Russia planned in advance
@LonaAfrasiab better not to skip lectures, specifically, literature.
@haaretzcom Good luck with Hizbulla

@LindseyGrahamSC So it is better Kurds join Russia,Iran and Syria ,I mean to be their proxies similar to Houthis,Hizbulla and Hamas
@AmichaiStein1 Turkish army make gencide similar to Armenian one
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorShaheen @marcorubio @SenTomCotton @SenAngusKing @SenJoniErnst Russia elected this president and he will abide by all decisions they made.
@realDonaldTrump Russia has announced the victory right after your first tweet, you are too late Mr. president to announce victory. Russia, Iran and Syria won the game.
@DanCrenshawTX No, absolutely we did not learnt, basically Trump handed over Syria to Iran and at the same time we hail Albanian government in expelling Iran diplomats.Quite hard to take Us policy at word.
@JSchanzer exactly
US withdrawal from #Syria is a disaster first for Israel then for #SDF . #Iran takes over #Syria effectively.
@SecPompeo @HeshmatAlavi but you have handed over Syria to Iran, better stay silent before Trump fires you.
@simple_blksmith @RandPaul What about Iran in Syria? is it fine Iran poses the great threat to Israel? then it is fine.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Can you tell us when does Russia celebrates the victory?.No answer from you for sure
@amberinzaman No, absolutely no, because this is a US plan to trap Iran and Turkey.
@Krissy_Caster Trump and defense officials announced. Tell us about GCC!
@Kurdishaf dorma plus ketchup? I will try
@LawkGhafuri Although somehow different but US could save Kurds. History tells us that US is not serious in supporting Kurds generally specifically when it comes to commercial issues and trade with other regional countries
@AmbJohnBolton But left Syria and handed over to Iran!
@sfrantzman @CaptainBillyBas Better to be released because their detention cost is high?Just Asking....
RT @CaptainBillyBas: If the US abandons NE Syria, we abandon these people to Turkey's ethnic cleansing policies.	Please RT. https://t.co/jP…
@LindseyGrahamSC I see this as a surrender to Russia's policy and plan in Syria.
@NicholasAHeras Yes, I confirm
@RandPaul I see this as a surrender to Russia's plan in Syria
@realDonaldTrump You said Kurds are great, we support them, and ...so on. What if Erdogan annihilated Kurdish people in Syria?
@JoumanaGebara__ I know administration announced that but the situation will not be like that exactly, there are many outlined policy secretly and carefully will be watched. Iran is on notice.
@marcorubio some people think this is to trap Iran, it can be right also
@drjohnfuller Turkish military commanders have met this evening on how to exploit the situation after US withdrawal
#US withdrawal from Syrian,  This is to trap #Iran?can be a guess. A 4 billion arms sale deal with #turkey? again can be another guess.
@JoumanaGebara__ I think it is not gonna be like that.
@D_abdulkader Exactly, clearly explained
@JonathanLalon12 @ScyTwi @IDF You are in Canada, you do not know what is going on
@JonathanLalon12 @ScyTwi @IDF You have replied yourself and proved Iran is the main problem.
@GollSaya نەخێر
@SarwanBarzani_ @HeikoMaas @PMBarzani @GermanyInKRI To be honest, European countries have no valued plan to support Kurds during conflicts rather than commercial interests. US is playing mainly in the middle east mostly.
@IDF Those who are blaming Israel under the pretext of peace, is a sheer machine of supporting terrorism of Iran,Hizbulla and Hamas. Iran is the greatest menace to world stability, specifically, Middle East.

@Cirincione We can say Iran does not yeild easily, Iran has threatened wiping Israel off the face of earth from time to time by some hardliners. But the war will be quite difficult to end as Iran deep rooted proxies in Syria,Lebanon and Iraq.

@shanya_am more than trash
@shanya_am why ya3?
@sfrantzman ford is my guess
@Pucemargine @sfrantzman @Jerusalem_Post This is not news, it is an ongoing process long time ago based on Iran's request to have the maximum presence in Syria.
@amberinzaman @AlMonitor congratulations
@Clarissimata That is an amazing answer
@StateDept @SecPompeo @HassanRouhani He is saying so because his regime possesses approximately 120000 missiles
@mdubowitz true
@Clarissimata It is obviously excellent but hope including KRI cuties as well while still a significant figure of IDPs are remaining to be stable.
@zenobeiaa cute
@i24NEWS_EN @RJBrodsky @MichelleMakori So how US can convince Iran to handover or demolish 120000 missiles?.Too difficult huh
@zina_haji_ 52😂😂😂
Does #US take these words into exceptional consideration? #Iran has a dangerous plan to threaten EU as well. https://t.co/6idr5JK8AO
I am curious to know if @SecPompeo has knowledge of transferring the Iranian missiles to Hizbulla through Syria?.
@khamenei_ir So far no reaction from Iran, reason?

@Joyce_Karam I read all the statement and the middle east doesn't relax simply.Thank you for sharing the statement here
@SecPompeo @HeshmatAlavi @USTreasury Since the sanctions are not tough similar to those on Iraq during Saddam Hussein, I do not think the recent sanctions having great impact while we see Iraq and Turkey have still big trade deals with that regime. NEED TO CHANGE THE GAME RULE Mr.Pompeo.
@AylinaKilic English briefly?
@DailySabah Not defending IDF but can you tell us how many journalists, Kurdish political leaders, officers and women are in Erdogan jails?! Well, we have seen a lot if you can not tell the world , we will tell them from now on.

@DJundyani زۆر تەواوە
@totor39 @tparsi Totally different. We are talking about Iran that some paid and so called journalists portraying the regime properly.
@SecPompeo @JZarif Iranian companies are taking massive medicine from Iraq plus huge exchange of US dollar &amp; Iranian Rial.
@tparsi The regime in Iran hangs people continually, do you have any thing to say on this?the regime kills kurds on daily basis, do you have any thing to say?regime assassinated many people abroad, do you have anything to say?. This rogue regime collapses accordingly.We watch together.
@sheharyarhasan2 @JZarif @SecPompeo Haven't you ever heard of Ahmedi Nejad that said we wipe Israel off the map?

@DavidMWitty1 US sanctions on Iran
@sheharyarhasan2 @JZarif @SecPompeo Would you read from Washington Post https://t.co/SjMhrFdN7e
@simesorkh @JZarif @SecPompeo Well, do you know how much spent on military and proxies from 2008 to 2018?. How about spending 230 billions of dollars in infrastructure, agriculture, education...etc instead of military and proxies?.
@sheharyarhasan2 @JZarif @SecPompeo Yes,many other countries possess even upgraded ballistic missiles but the question here is: Did those countries threaten US,Israel or any other countries with missiles or chemical weapons  except the government of Iran?
@dbongino I do not think Acosta is doing the job professionally
@sheharyarhasan2 @JZarif @SecPompeo I see you are answering indirectly, so Iran needs the missiles to destroy Israel? or Saudi Arabia?.
@LawkGhafuri Recently ISIS emerge became an open news among people and mass media, are there further details?. Wish safety for all.
@JZarif @SecPompeo The point is ballistic missiles, any reason you need these missiles? The world leaders now thinking of that. More sanctions maybe come forward.

@Rewards4Justice One day comes that US will do similar to Turkey as happened to Iraq,Libya, Syria and now Iran. Take this seriously!
@tparsi Concerning Iran, the decision remains unanimously which all of them support Donald Trump. Let's see....
@LauraLoomer reason of suspension?I am far from you thousands of miles but I always read your good tweets.

@SecPompeo @NileGardiner US not against the people of Iran but against the regime
@DrWifeQuotes @Reuters The reason is already found

@StateDept @SecPompeo There will be a big problem in the Straight Of Hurmoz as we read this statement and Rouhani statements too.

@JSchanzer #Khashoggi case made the Iran focus less important these days, 4th of Nov there will be no more other issues rather than Iran
@srway_ By the way, these two letters are quite far from each other in the keyboard.
@Farberyanki don't these people have families! Really a bad move
@ragipsoylu but FM of Turkey said that they will not share anything!
@itsShvan @sybarzinji unfortunately ,no mom to ask. Thanks for your information.
@miinaGull yes
RT @issacharoff: Just love the Middle East. A Turkish dictator, who butchered and slaughtered tens and hundreds of Kurds, assisted ISIS and…
@kateaustin496 @TestySally @Reuters absolutely NO
@YasserAlhakbani @JavierBlas @tictoc The majority of the attendees were Arabs from Gulf countries, very very few global companies and personals.
@AwwadSAlawwad @alekhbariyatv Hello Mr. Minister, it seems my letter not reached you. Improvement and amendment to Saudi Arabia Media needed more than ever. With Respect
@sybarzinji yapraxi sur?🙄
@shanya_am should be?
@realDonaldTrump smart leader! During Dems in power, US never seen such progressive level.
@IamJustMB @tomgara He doesn't want to be there, his eyes tells a disastrous event,the handshake hurts him more,take a closer look on how security guy hands on gun,
@SarahinKRI @JonWilksFCO including women, civic engagement through town hall meeting and community members workshop are important. The beginning is important.
@Ostrov_A @Isaac_Herzog @JewishAgency hope see him, indeed
@ragipsoylu The leaks will continue but he plays with time to see if there will be future promises by USA or KSA then gradually real investigation results will be released in case there were no benefit for Turkey.
@negar_cello خێر؟
@ragipsoylu something goes on irregular
@LisaDaftari You see?
Totally against his killing, Now the #Khashoggi  case turns into something else, do you feel the same?. #Trump #Erdogan #SaudiArabia
@realDonaldTrump through #Khashoggi  case ,they want blame US for having ties and interests with Saudi Arabia lol
@realDonaldTrump And they want you withdraw from Saudi Arabia and later they run for them
No justification is logic to kill #JamalKhashoggi but as we all see this issue politicized indirectly to make #Europe to force #Trump to reconsider #Iran and review policy towards #SaudiArabia . #Erdogan plays on a rope that may be dangerous.
@MsLeahCatherine @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump do not mix things, you are behind in news
@DailySabah The majority of the city were Kurdish and have been displaced gradually by former regimes ,similar to what Turkey is doing now in Afrin city.
@EmriyeC @ragipsoylu Anyone know what happened to @ClaudiaAlMina and @EndiZentarmi?
@USAmbUK Yes, go ahead
@ragipsoylu Can you tell us who decides who is right and wrong?. And tell us how many journalists are missing in Turkey, killed and jailed?.I am just asking...
@shanya_am One important point, do not give up, stay strong and never get despondent
@FranTownsend @RT_Erdogan you have said part of it but the purpose is bigger behind this case
@linnaa_ hug is one of the most necessary move that lead to easeof mind between two persons
@Sarajojo998 کەواتە ئەوەی من تەواوە، چوار موجودە و بەرەو پێنجەم لێ ئەخوڕم 😂😂😂
@manal_alsharif I did not understand these people are jailed still?
@ajmurgent new story?
@manal_alsharif @KarenAttiah @washingtonpost I do not think Saudi Arabia remains in the last months image internationally.
@WarrMartyn @ukinerbil @ChevKurd In 1994, the name of the scheme was changed to Chevening, after Chevening House in Sevenoaks, Kent – currently the joint official residence of the British Foreign Secretary and the British Deputy Prime Minister.
@ChraxanRafiq دەست خۆش، نموونەی سادەیی

@AP we felt he has been killed from the first , but the question where is the body?
@ragipsoylu I have already stated that (problem solved: Royal family not involved)
@AlArabiya_Brk وين الجثه ..!
@AJEnglish Middle East is horrible for journalists and  minorities. It is a hell.
@Alankurdistani7 پیرۆزی بێت بە خۆشی، منیش دەمێکە بە تەمام پاسکیلێکی ebike mate بکڕم و پارەکە تەواوی ناکات 😂😂😂😂
@naifco so where is #khashoggi ?
@008Albasha @monther72 @Kafalsaud78 Photoshop
@AlyssaRosenberg plus, there is another play behind enlarging this case though Saudi is not good
@KyleWOrton This is a game, otherwise hundreds of journalists have been disappeared in the world and no one has taken action.Hmmmmm
@A_Sloat part of the game presumably
@amberinzaman @AlMonitor @NicholasAHeras @CNASdc problem solved: Royal family not involved in the killing.
@ajmurgent problem solved: Royal family not involved in the killing.
@AdelleNaz not only it divides, but further destroys
@realDonaldTrump horrible
@manal_alsharif @JKhashoggi image**
@KarenAttiah @manal_alsharif Saudi government will be changed after Iran issues
@manal_alsharif @JKhashoggi cutting body to pieces! what a horrible kmage!

@dannydanon well-done

@FLOTUS And where is Hillary?
@BREAKING_PTV They did not attack Gaza, they did as a retaliation against last night rocket from Gaza
@AmandaShouting @alibazi2 @SecPompeo I am against killing or kidnapping people but this case is totally turned into a political agenda between states. It is no more a matter of a journalist.
@AmandaShouting @alibazi2 @SecPompeo do you think the human right is protected everywhere except in Mr.Khashoggi case?
@realDonaldTrump Why there is no president like you in the entire Middle East?. You are doing great. Amazing.

@tparsi Are there other missiles to be fired after first week of Nov.? similar to zero harassment of US Navy since Trump became president?.hmmm let's wait .....
@HeshmatAlavi bio-chemical site
@StateDept @SecPompeo @POTUS US should be more serious as IRGC Deputy Commander Hossein Salami said: “I announce to the Zionist regime prime minister that he should practice swimming in the Mediterranean, because he will soon have no path but to escape to the sea.”

@JesuS69718708 @tparsi Yes, because there are some stupid people on twitter and they think there is no winter aming the four seasons.
Explosions in #Kirkuk 🙄🙄 #Iraq https://t.co/fYTR3y9WTc
@JesuS69718708 @tparsi That's why wee see December as a disaster for the regime?.
@tparsi But all the indicators on twitter and other social media  tell us that the people are quite upset. What about those people who were protesting even inside Iran are backing the regime?!.
A tactical game started, confirmed.#USsanctions #Iran #Yemen #SaudiArabia and #Iraq
@This_is_Sheelan Division among the Kurds have been the first reason behind every failure. I hope one day our journalists, intellectuals, academics and mainly politicians learn to act towards unity.
@marcorubio well said Marco
@SecPompeo is quite right,not only Iraq but Syria,Yemen and Lebanon as well through its proxies. https://t.co/za44Ut5nWE
@JZarif Too late,right?
#Iran plans extensively in the region, some indicators tell us that even #Iraq faces obstacles in economic.
@qubadjt Excellently explained
@ChraxanRafiq well, let's see specifically starting from the first week of Nov.
@ChraxanRafiq Iran's malign activities in the region lead to disastrous and chaotic prices.

#Iran made the area unsafe and State Department might close #Basra consulate. https://t.co/1nepyiXP3l
@dannydanon @netanyahu @nikkihaley bibi is great and Nikki is amazing
@SecPompeo I think the people of Iran (majority) have no more patience, TIME FOR ACTION
@This_is_Sheelan That is Iraq
#Iran started revenging in a response to the attacks in Ahwaz, #Basra today witnessed what we said already. #Iraqi Territorial status not clear and not under full Iraqi government.
@This_is_Sheelan Maybe it has come from Erbil or Sulaimaniyah 🤔🤔🤔

@W_K_Martin_III @D_abdulkader Not having any difficulties in language translation, politicians are guiding the people here and people followed them for the referendum. it means the people decided on that.
@W_K_Martin_III @D_abdulkader Sorry, not agree with that, the best option that Kurds decided on referendum. This paves the way in future for east,north and west of Kurdistan to follow.
@W_K_Martin_III @D_abdulkader And now Iranian regime suffer from US sanctions and we congratulate them😂😂
@W_K_Martin_III @D_abdulkader some PUK figures betrayed Kurdistan

@mrubin1971 @dcexaminer @AEIfdp For decades,since history, Turkish terrorists like Erdogan created massacre against Kurds and Armenian nation. PKK,YPG,PUK,KDP and others are representing Kurdish people and Kurdistan. That is all. we do not want to hear lies like (we are not against kurds but PKK).

@SecPompeo @brett_mcgurk @POTUS Can you confirm the rights of Kurds are kept within that new-formed government?.
@AimeeCerka somehow predictions, take a look at few months ago of my tweets😁😁
@SecPompeo we have already stated that two Iraqi airports have been used to transfer Iranian weapons to Syria and Iraq as we.

@Schuldensuehner @welt Turkish Lira falls slightly now, any reason?. 6.17
@Schuldensuehner Lira falls again once the market get opened on Monday.
@oirdcomss @SputnikInt totally ridiculous
@ChraxanRafiq It is absolutely a complex issue,you are right, other administrative sections to be considered as well.
@Ahmadinejad1956 Go back to power or economy collapses to zero point
@ihsan27562934 @spectatorindex But what type of government? Ask the world not me 😂😂😂😂
@spectatorindex well,Turkey is not Europe
@i_mxrr 37
@FoxNews it is good,why does US should pay without getting anything in return?.it does not make any sense.
@BitarSaif Muslims even among themselves kill each other then why do you blame Israel while it is their land.
@LaurieMylroie @AmbJohnBolton @WHNSC The puzzle is difficult to identify, Iran and Turkey have joined Russia for many mutual interests, thus US so far could not do anything about Turkey.
@Kcha_Koyii ئێژم هەردەم سەرکەوتوو بیت
@LawkGhafuri That is why I think referendum was a good idea though we have lost many things but Kurds sent a message for Iran and Turkey as well through it. Iraq is a cursed country and life is not an option to choose here.
@DailySabah But after Bayram, Lira falls again as we all know. how come?
@FoxNews @POTUS @FLOTUS Great POTUS

@realDonaldTrump Turkey stands against us and Pastor not released
@realDonaldTrump After holidays, bad luck for #Erdogan Lira
In comparison to last year, level of tourists traveling to #Turkey made a headache for #Turkish government. Gradually,year by year,less and less. This is due to distancing itself from democracy and international attitudes.

@ekinci_meric @nytimesworld @SalehMaslem As you know there are other political parties in south,west and east. Now South is free, east maybe soon, west is somehow in a better situation. The big FOCUS is on north now.
@realDonaldTrump Rogue regime like Turkey which Erdogan leads should be put more sanctions to give him a lesson not to detain US citizens
@nytimesworld @SalehMaslem PKK is not a terrorist and they fight for the rights of over 12 millions of Kurds in the north of Kurdistan.
@UnitedNUR @TRTWorldNow @trtworld Kurds are Muslim also, why do you kill them?.fuck off!
@USEmbassyTurkey @coalition Delist PKK from terror list = problem solved with Turkey. (It means Eedogan is doing whatever you want)

@EllieGeranmayeh @peterjsalisbury to some extent ,it is totally right but remember geopolitical importance is going to be changed if big trade deals comes in front of Russia by US.
@Daniel_Sugarman one more tweet from Mr.Trump with one more sanction will take Lira to ground

@khamenei_ir "There will be no war"but Iranian army destabilized the countries Iraq,Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. This is ALREADY a war , isn't it?
@EndiZentarmi Erdogan declared war on America . Let's wait for Trump reaction.
@anadoluagency This will not stop the Lira fresh fell. As the banks can not provide facilities for major exchange internationally.
@spectatorindex now we all know that Erdogan has ruined his country and Turkey is not strong.
For #journalists this is right? @CNNWorld @FoxNews @ABC @washingtonpost @TRTalarabiya @trtworld https://t.co/eQz24MSL8e

@canokar Clear but disastrous for the entire Turkish and Kurdish nation inside Turkey
@ada236 I do not know Turkish language but I translate. Well, same situation happen to Turkey, similar to Iraq in the past and Iran economy recently.
some #Erdogan #Turkish followers starting taking #Dollar to pieces. What a disgrace !!@CNNWorld @nytimesworld @TRTalarabiya @FoxNews @DailySabah @anadoluagency https://t.co/VcAEyBSjE5
#Turkish  finance minister supported #ISIS to enter #Kirkuk in #Kurdistan so that he will be able to take Kirkuk oil via ISIS. Let's see how Lira plumges to record lower ! https://t.co/sBvZ5h6nJR

@AlArabiya_Brk any website to watch live?
@Sapmi4 @russian_market Thank you so much dear
@russian_market I checked now it shows 6.43 on https://t.co/hQG3MFjJzf
@Sapmi4 @ragipsoylu exactly
@realDonaldTrump  is absolutely right concerning decisions on Turkey. I have a friend in Turkey said that Erdogan rich followers burn US dollar to show the world that this is dollar value. More tarrifs on #turkish products may emerge from #US . #economics  #Trump https://t.co/MNY9gJ7oPI
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends Do you know that every year Turkey benefits 900 million USD from US companies ?!!! really too much. TIME TO WITHDRAW US COMPANIES FROM TURKEY.
@ikalin1 @nytimes The recent Turkish administration failure is big. Lira never gets back to previous years. It was quite wrong to enter Syria and suppress Kurds. You see how country currency fell rapidly? You see how economy will be collapsed within the next 6 months?.come on!!!
@AhmetDo85715668 @ikalin1 @nytimes Kurds are a nation of over 40 millions, they deserve a free state and freedom. I fully support Kurds and Kurdistan
@Total_Exactness @ErkutOzdamar @paulkrugman @lattedenborsaya Exactly,well-said but in few situations even point 2 does not work well.
#USA has full right to defend while #Erdogan try to take US officers hostage. https://t.co/SoxZBju923
@spectatorindex Erdogan= bus driver
@anadoluagency What ally?do you remember during toppling Saddam Hussein, Turkish so called parliament vote against US admin to use Incirlik air base? hmmmm Lira is ready for another fresh fall?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Turkish case went beyond the Pastor, economy fell lower more, China rejects trade through Lira as well.
@PressTV he is real president and takes care of his. own nation.
@macergifford @ca_onurcan Yesterday it became when the lira fell more
@spectatorindex Iraq is not in the list 🤔🤔🤔
I have repeatedly mentioned this in May. #Turkish lira #Erdogan #Kurdish #Kurdistan https://t.co/CpDJZhVB1G
@Ibo_CaKiR @spectatorindex then congratulations for collapse of Lira 😂😂😂
@realDonaldTrump Erdogan threatens US interests, aligning with Iran and continue trade with Iran. Mr. President send out another tweet to Turkish sick puppy,Erdogan.
@spectatorindex Turkey is 1000 🤣🤣

@DailySabah 😂😂😂
@tcbestepe Lira never comes back to previous postion
@ErkutOzdamar @paulkrugman @lattedenborsaya in case borrowers can not pay back, the situation gets worse.
@ErkutOzdamar @paulkrugman @lattedenborsaya World financial system is outstanding now, Turkey is out of the system now as Lira lost value in remarkable percentages. Let's if the debt can be paid back.
@AshtyMamade paku
@MEtr55 @spectatorindex wait for other tweets by President Trump, he knows you ONLY.
@MEtr55 @spectatorindex The enemy is terrorist Erdogan not Turkish people because even Turkish people hate him and consider him as a big problem for Turkey
RT @paulkrugman: Turkey follows the old Asian crisis script https://t.co/hCzl4wPZHt
@ErkutOzdamar @paulkrugman @lattedenborsaya simple: Turkey can not pay back the debt because of financial crisis but other can pay back though they have debt.
@MEtr55 @spectatorindex Congratulations for the Lira fall, sorry I mean toilet paper 😂😂😂😂
@spectatorindex https://t.co/qWoy7H4E4M

From the beginning, the picture was clear that neither Erdogan nor his son-in-law can restore #TRY. @realDonaldTrump  is quite smart on how to work on world economic. https://t.co/L6oypHg56y
@ahmadalissa But not able to do anything in Minbaj and Afrin?
@ikalin1 Erdogan spoiled the lives of millions of Turkish citizens, aligning with Russiaand Iran is not a good point that he referred to in his yesterday's speech. Thus, Turkish Lira fall further within the next two months
@Naz_xan دڵ ڕەقەکان هەمیشە براوەی ئەم سەردەمەن
@Schuldensuehner Do you think Turkey can pay back the debt with that?
@Razhan_aziz jar jar basha bas ba hiwayat nabe
@anadoluagency It will be soon stopped for Kurdistan because of fallen Lira
@Razhan_aziz شەڕ مەکە
@srwa_ranya ئەقڵ تاجی زێڕینە بەڵام لەسەری ئەو برادەرە نیە هههه
@DailySabah Take care of fallen Turkish Lira rather than KSA and Iran
@JZarif two weak economy countries,Iran and Turkey.
@anadoluagency Lira collapses more and more as the Turkish banks and companies will not be able to pay back the debt they have borrowed from countries and international banks.
@realDonaldTrump Turkish economy will not be stable again. Goodbye Erdogan.
US has prepared another sanction which ruin Turkish economy fast!
Erdogan has not finished the speech that #TRY fell to lower records, what he said, people did the opposite in market and exchange stations.Well, more happens! YES, IT WILL
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Take Incirlik out of Turkey as US spends millions of dollars per year. More sanctions on Turkey works very well.
@erncyln6 @Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford This is the first time the US says "goodbye" and it is the last one😂😂😂😂
@erncyln6 @Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford You are mistaken absolutely, era of Erdoganism and 4 fingers have been given a goodbye
@erncyln6 @Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford There are over 12 Million Kurds in the north of Kurdistan, how can you deny it while the world knows?! I think Kurds are against wrong policy of Erdogan and AKP leaders not Turks because Turks are respective as communities and residents. Yes, it is their land.
@realDonaldTrump  made the right decision today, he is a great President. https://t.co/6j0ftyKlYT
#کوردستان_ولاتێکە_و_نابێ_بەچوار https://t.co/PFe5ZHuJsb
@erncyln6 @Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford The Kurdish political parties are Kurds and represent Kurds, you like it or not ,this is a FACT. US realized that PKK is no longer a terror organization besides Mr. Fetullah Gulen.

@anadoluagency You must say that😂😂😂😂
@anadoluagency Do not use the word (should) because Mr. Trump will tweet again and Lira becomes the bottom of the glass.
@canokar A very noteworthy tweet today I have read
@shvangoran @realDonaldTrump it will go beyond 10
#TRY loss continue as @realDonaldTrump tweeted now. 1 USD  will be 7 TRY soon
@canokar you are right bri
@realDonaldTrump It is very fair, put US first as ALWAYS
@pierpont_morgan seriously?
As Erdogan adresses right now,Turkish Lira quickly plunges to lower records of 6.1 https://t.co/q0hGWEE0Yb
@rozanhiv @Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford You misinterpreted my tweet. in a simple way: Kurds are not terrorists as Erdogan shows to the world.
New Turkish economic model failed from the first step. #TRY  plunges to further lower records by this evening.
@AmedElih 200 parcha
@BarbarossaKaya hmm
@Jake_Hanrahan @macergifford They are not terrorists as Erdogan portrayed them, they are freedom fighters for their own nation

@anadoluagency one US dollar traded in 4.9 Turkish Lira, is this a gain?. Day by day ,Lira gets devalued. Please ask commerce trade experts
@mahsti25metana1 The rogue regime need to be changed
@mahsti25metana1 Inflation is different from devalued currency as I heard from commerce experts. Rial got devalued very low by sanctions.
@ashnaa45 unfortunately I do not understand Persian language
@yenisafakEN They are freedom fighters not terrorists,secondly the news is fake
@anadoluagency PKK are Gurrelias, Houthis are terrorists, PYD are freedom fighters....etc
@Khaaasteh Reason: The government no longer csn afford the massive cost of military,Sepah and Quds force.
@DEFCONWSALERTS Not clear why we have listed PKK as terrorist for years, now it is time to delist. Erdogan is the bad man who assisted Hamas terrorist groups against Israel.

@VP @D_abdulkader @POTUS As we all know that Eedogan is a dictator,we as the nation do not want him because he is putting Turkey under damaged economy and sanctions
@hellonazli @VP @POTUS Eedogan is a dictator, all of us know. Pastor must be released before sanctions take effect
@anadoluagency hmmm
@PressTV @realDonaldTrump she was a sick puppy under Obama rule
@PressTV @realDonaldTrump What kind of resistance?!!! Let's take a look at Iran economy and currency now
@realDonaldTrump useless paper
@Ostrov_A exactly
@tparsi You must be kidding! more than half of Iranian want to be freed from that rogue regime, come on!
@anadoluagency Turkey should free the Pastor otherwise faces tough sanctions and delisting PKK as PKK represents all Kurds in Turkey.
@ahmadalissa @unikgirl11 Trump and his Allies are not against the people of Syria but it is the regime itself who kills his own people on daily basis. A photo does not represent that regime, should I send you the photos of people who are gassed by dictotor Assad?

@FCSMELO @Kurdistanjounes @brett_mcgurk @SRTFUND Turkey is no longer important to NATO and fell to Russian plan against US in the region

@VP @Mike_Beacham @MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures @FoxBusiness a blow has given to Turkish economy
After my prediction came true regarding wrong Turkish policy with #US and #turkish economy losses. Turkish foreign minister blocked me as I have reminded him in a tweet. Thank you Mr. minister. https://t.co/RABfj95V20
@SecPompeo @abdullahawez @MevlutCavusoglu Turkey hand in hand with Iran and Russia plays a dirty game in the Mideast,thus Erdogan of Turkey puts his country at the risk of big financial failure status and Lira gets devalued much more.
@paikarazad A puzzle game
@NadiaMuradBasee @EwanIsmael @VP @SecPompeo excellent
@ReutersWorld Iran,Turkey and Syria are in big trouble
Turkish economy will be at big stake https://t.co/Q3bmuoX91x
After @realDonaldTrump  tweeted concerning putting large sanctions on #Turkey, #Turkish merchants and people started changing their Turkish currency Lira to US dollar.
@borsa_hastasi @dilaraaa_1881 @realDonaldTrump You do not know how the sanctions work that's why you replied to me like this.
@MevlutCavusoglu What will you tell your people when Lira gets devalued after sanctions, if happens?
@ragipsoylu funny
@HiTurkiye @YkselSakarya2 @realDonaldTrump Turkey gets freedom one day
@dilaraaa_1881 @realDonaldTrump Let's take a look at Lira value if Turkey does not release him
@realDonaldTrump cut ties and put sanctions until detained US citizens get released.

@heminhawrami congratulations Hemin, keep up the good work.
@FazelHawramy @Kurdistan We all know who get benefit from the trade deal
@realDonaldTrump If they won't, then you have full right to put america first
@nikkihaley @WorldJewishCong @USUN core of the matter
@AdelleNaz I think President Trump better to reward the fake news sources so that the world know them better.
@Khaaasteh @HassanRouhani Do you know how muchh Iran currency (Tomman) is equal to 100 USD? do you know what happens according to US plan in Nov?. Let's see how Iran closes Strait of Hurmiz!
@khamenei_ir Again under the name of"Palestine" !!! Too old and useless
@JZarif Let's wait until Nov. and then I willbe back to this account to say HELLO.
@realDonaldTrump Time to blow up or still intelligence agency does not certify the the clearance?
@realDonaldTrump I have never ever read a single article in that paper! why? Fake News at all
@SaraQaradaghi @Stephenthejp1 maybe not
@AghazadehHadi @khamenei_ir You must be kidding! Well, why Quds Sepah so far could not take over Jerusalem from Israel?. The regime now is under heavy sanctions,why the Sepah can not attack the US forces in the Arab Gulf states?. so many many unaswered questions.....
@realDonaldTrump Keep awarding fake media so that the world knows them better. You are a great president, love you.
@khamenei_ir Did the US and West hanged those people in Iran?.On daily basis, innocent people would be hanged in Iran!
@khamenei_ir Let's say you can block the Straight of Hurmz for few days, or even few months, are you sure your army can tolerate the allied forces few days to stand in front of them?.come on! Give up before the innocent people of Iran suffer due to your wrong policy of government.
@khamenei_ir Then congratulations to the economic situation you have now in Iran !! Saddam Hussein said the same but his entire army collapsed within days.
@anadoluagency congratulations to Turkish Lira devaluation, 100 USD=479  Lira
@politicalelle Since sanctions has been toughened on Iranian regime, Hamas has been feuled to make a noise. We all agree Hamas is a terrorist organization and no hesitation.
@SecPompeo @USUN @antonioguterres @StateDept Keep focus on Iran as well

@realDonaldTrump Solution: Europe for Russia, Middle East and Asia for US?

@realDonaldTrump Any update on Iran?
@lrozen mine poor, only.800 and some 😂😂😂😂
#EU agrees finally to suport #US_JCPOA withdrawal in return not to block #European companies to get benefits from.#US .  Thus, what #Iran  can do?.

#Turkish Lira !!! #IranRegimeChange sense affects or not?! https://t.co/bIYfCBaY0i
@masoud_barzani @brett_mcgurk excellent president
@TimesofIsrael then Israel is right that explains the regime danger in Syria
@realDonaldTrump @USNavy From now on, this will be like :		2018: 0	2019: - 7	2020: - 15	2021: -20
@realDonaldTrump @USNavy sanctions works slightly now but after November 4th it works very well
No sanctions worked so far on #Iran until declaring a stopage to Iran oil export by #US . Well, 4th of Nov is somehow far but Iran stands firmly to find something and it will not be successful finally. #IranUpdate
@khabatali بۆ خۆمان باشە و ترسی نیە
@khamenei_ir I am sure about Iran to be freed but do not know any clue about Palestine
@JZarif It is you that Isolated Iran with Khamenei, Nov is waiting you guys to welcome the toughest sanctions
@SharareMishavam @JZarif it is just a show,no less no more
@golnarkgr @JZarif Let's take a look at Iran economy and money!!!! The regime plays wrongly in the region
@EfritehChin @JZarif topples economically and  gradually
@JZarif Iran oil export being stopped,Strait of Hornuz closed?The war starts?yes. Iran economy already in a tough collapsing. You must be kidding Mr. Zarif.
@AgnesCallamard @cfpierce Iran is not able to face international sanctions that were set by US ,therefore; the only thing the regime can do is to hang innocent people.
@JZarif the current regime need to be changed
@HanaComani @abdullahawez @nabihbulos I have noticed that you are lying for few buck of money. They could not take Erbil as there were shere resistance of Peshmarga forces. You know nothing about plotics and Iraqi issues that is why what you write and wrote, will soon be refuted.
@Drx661 @Tufan12358883 what is this?
@LindseyGrahamSC Turkey collapses and it is just a matter of time, their economy is first.
@DavidMWitty1 It seems they are busy over there.
@Shahanomer @Sara97AHA One day we will see how Turkey collapses but first let's pray that Turkey continues sticking to Russia and Palestinian slogans.

@WhiteHouse @FreeeIran Keep the sanctions tougher and the regime collapses gradually
@JZarif Take a look about your country currency vs US dollar!!take a look at the Iranian demand right now!! Think about China,Turkey and India when quit purchasing your oil!! take at the events after November.

@SecPompeo In my early tweets I have mentioned that Iran economy collapses specifically after Nov.
@IlluminatiKills @khamenei_ir Try to answer the questions I asked then we go discussing Israel and Palestinian .
@khamenei_ir What about killing Kurds and bahais in Iran? is that righteous as well? is that justice you are referring to?

@SecPompeo @StateDept @POTUS The agenda: Tackling on N.Korea denuclearization, Toppling Iranian regime, teaching Turkey a lesson concerning a stop to fuel Hamas agression towars Israel.
@AsaadHannaa already started but the process is slow because of Russian presence in Syria

@anadoluagency This year, Tourism will be less as %10 comparing to last summer. Thus Turkish Lira loses more value and expectation for this issue will be 100 USD equals to 1000 by 2019. This is NOT natural.
@PressTV Really funny as Iranian rials almost lost its value in the international trade. US make the world to consider their trade deals with USA and thus Iran loses the game.
@eu_eeas @FedericaMog EU can not save the deal and Iran is ignoring the world as usual.
@HDNER Lira will lose more values and for right now there is no solution. A slowly collapsing of economy and this is NOT natural.
#Turkey loses %4 of its USA and its allies tourists for this summer and the Lira loses more value against dollar, specifically, in 2019, might equals 100 USD to 650 TL.
Well, I am just predicting on #Syria , #IranNuclearDeal and #Turkey not a journalist or political person so no need for Turkish and Iranian newspapers request to interview me or giving articles. Hope for a safer world without war and nuclear bombs.

@cfpierce during Turkish military operation in Afrin, I have said that Turkey has a very soft economy which is not natural , will collapse gradually. Now Lira losing value more and more against US dollar.
@Jerusalem_Post Turkey is on the agenda as well due to have big support for terror group such as Hamas and Iranian groups as well. Turkish Lira and Iranian rial lost values against US dollar first.
RT @Jerusalem_Post: Kurds in Iraq adrift after Iraqi election https://t.co/3xlaM1BXJR

Why tourists aroind the world avoid traveling to #Turkey ?is it because the #ISIS over there kidnapped the tourists as announced lately? reasons behind Lira that lost its value is one of these outcomes?....Hmmm

@JacobAWohl That is why I say let's say hello toTurkish Lira that lost its value against US dollar
Well, Now #Israel knows how #Iran sends weapons to #Syria through #Iraqi airports then to Syrian border. Hmmm, I have already mentioned this and now they show the reality of the case.
@realDonaldTrump @Marianhouk Eliminate the source of the "force" is essential
@hareznamiq کەواتە حەڕڕڕااااااامە

@abwaanweedhsame @USAmbIsrael @EmmanuelNahshon @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes, it is clear
@mahsti25metana1 @mdubowitz @rich_goldberg @WSJopinion The Rial loses in big vs US dollar. The Iranian economy collapses within five years if does not give up ballistic missiles program and nuclear program as well.
A common demand: Iran must leave Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria but USA demands something very different. Conclusion is a war in the region but within a very slow mothion of calendar.#IranRegimeChange
@AdelleNaz @BreitbartNews Iran wants to control him like Maliki and PUK. Mcgurk competes well in Iraq as he has been discussing issues with the Kurds as well.
@BinyaminMurad گریانم بۆ ئەو گەنجە داماوە دێت
@nikkihaley @SecPompeo @USUN Tonbe brief, if Iran will not be stopped, US allies will live in danger in Mideast
@SecPompeo @BenWeinthal @POTUS Regime change within few years. BUT the important point is to reduce the disasters in the region during the war on Iran
@Zendette staffs at White House are busy
@Abc11Ab What I am thinking of is different from mathematics measures . You may see sooner not after 10 years.
@Abc11Ab Three years ago, 100 USD = 300 TL, now as of today 435=100$, local market exchange. No difference?
@Abc11Ab But not healthy natural economic growth, compare Lira value to three years ago.
@SecPompeo very simple: no regime change, Israel is at stake
@netanyahu I have already said that countries need to compete opening their embassies in Jerusalem. Let's wait a little bit more...
@SecPompeo doomsday for Iran regime, is a change
@_taban_ maybe yes maybe not, only God knows

@NazaninBoniadi yes, it can be felt unfortunately
#IraqiElections2018  : within few minutes they will announce final results.
@StateDept @mdubowitz @SecPompeo @Heritage Regime change is not like drinking water but many other ways should be on the table to bring the regime to knees.
@BitarSaif @jnj_kahl @nikkihaley but when someone tells you shut up, then you need to leave him when he speaks, sounds good?
#US and #Iran are competing over forming Iraqi goverment after election. A sneaky game of Qassem Sulaimani and Brett McGurk with the #IraqiElections2018 political figures.
@dannydanon Iran does not let Gazan to live in peace, always feuls Hamas. Other side is Ramallah , normal life.
@SecPompeo @StateDept A new strict strategy is needed to put more sanctions and pressure on the regime until brings to knee.
The Turkish currency Lira has been steadily losing its value against the dollar, from now on, further to follow. Erdogan makes his country economy and currency at lowest value. Many reasons...... #Turkey #ErdoganNotWelcome #Trump #Israel

@Shuriyakurd1 @brett_mcgurk @masoud_barzani Give me a break, this is related to reduce Qassem Sulaimani effect visiting  Iraq and Kurdistan?.Oh the situation is somehow tense as Iran is operating very well in the region.

@magatwatter @cfpierce @AmericaNewsroom @JulieBanderas @SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump I think you have no idea about Kurds.
After #Trump  announced withdrawal from #IranDeal , the regime informed its proxies in #Iraq, #Syria,#Yemen and #Lebanon on how to arrange themselves. From now on ,the situation will be a disaster.

@USConGenErbil nice photo
@Elizrael Let me tell you briefly, if Iran stops fueling Hamas, problems will smoothly get solved. No need to put the blame on others.
@mahsti25metana1 Between 1994-1997 ,one hundred dollar were equal to 9000 Iraqi dinar. Today, Iranian rial recorded lowest value , the same situation will happen as happened to Iraq and finally the regime of Iran will collapse
@IsraeliPM Top priority is Iran?
@cfpierce not new, during the operation into Kirkuk and other areas, Kurdish official raised this concern and Tillerson said it is fine
@PressTV and today Iranian rial rcorded the lowest value vs US dollar.
#Iranian rial today vs #us dollar! BumBUm. Similar economy that Iraq experienced in the 90th. Iran tries to print money as Saddam  Hussein did previously during the sanctions.

@Hana_For_Kurd Sound is measured in units called decibels. Sounds of less than 75 decibels, even after long exposure, are unlikely to cause hearing loss. However, long or repeated exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss.

The coalition forces will stay in #Syria to have a new Syria. #Russian government struggle to work on lift of the sanctions rather than defending Iran and Syria.
I have noticed some paid journalists wrote on behalf of Iraqi PMU and Turkish government just because they get bucks of money.

@abdullahawez @nabihbulos I was there at that time. If Peshmarga forces did not resist , for sure the PMU would take Erbil . When the bridge has been exploded, PMU understood that peshmarga fights accordingly.
@realDonaldTrump Does Russia loosen her teeth concerning Iran if the West lifts the sanctions? Kremlin already responded to this question.

I analyze the coincidence of @realDonaldTrump  decision on Iran and Iraq's election on 12.May. #Russia can ease her sanctions by obeying the West countries demands on #Iran and #Syria
@WhiteHouse @VP He needs one year only to repair the damages and corruption that made by Kerry's mistakes concerning Iran .

@realDonaldTrump ''Mission Accomplished'' means not intending toppling Assad from power. It means purely not firing missiles into Syria. The biggest threat is Iran.
3/3* US wanted to test Russia capability of defense in Syria, Russia might agreed as well (Trump said arm race sometimes). * After Syria- Iran and Turkey fall into financial crisis so that they became puppet of other countries. KSA wins somehow.
2/3 *Russia will withdraw from Syria if US,UK and other countries promise to hold off sanctions. * Turkey spied very closely with Russia and Iran, in return Russia consider revenge. * Iran can not survive in Syria so easily as Iran could not respond to any missiles by US/UK..etc
We are 5 lovely friends and we have discussed #SyrianStrikes #Russian #Iran vs #USA ,#uk ,France ,KSA..other allied forces , Here I am going to write it briefly and hope you have time read it and correct us if there are something wrong with this. 1/3

The three,@realDonaldTrump ,@EmmanuelMacron @theresa_may are quite sure that CW has been used in Syria but still they have not decided to strike. Reason: Iran quite close to Israel and active on the frontline, secondly: If Russia answers, there will be uncontrollable war.

@Joyce_Karam Erdogan of Turkey wants to get benefit from both side, US and Russia,as well.
@ofirgendelman @IsraelMFA Maybe they meant Erdogan's army that calls for massive and strong army to occupy Jerusalem?

@Stephenthejp1 a good news
@ClaudiaAlMinah but Trump announced they coming out of Syria very soon.
@realDonaldTrump Please do not leave the Kurds behind in Syria.
unfortunately https://t.co/GYQQHkOlcm
@cfpierce @RudawEnglish I have seen the video and it is true but we hope Trump will regret or AIPAC makes him withdraw from that option.
@RudawEnglish This news is not true so far, I have checked CSPAN transcript and other official government channels. No confirmation emerged yet.
@TimInHonolulu Yes you are right,man. I have checked his twitter as well, and white house readouts and some other breaking news as well but so far no confirmation pops up.
US withdraw from Syria?
@Stephenthejp1 yes, possible
@JulianRoepcke The world is pot that boils the innocent people ONLY.
I tried much to figure out how US made tanks and US small weapons reached the hands of Houthis in Yemen,not a surprise as there is a link between Iraq PMU and Iran, but theough Iraq to Yemmen is the puzzle. #Yemen #Iraq

@RebelNoia_ And for EU, they are silent too because Turkey is migration filter to massive migrants into Europe.
@RebelNoia_ Quite needed for Iran because US has only gulf states,Turkey (ainjirlik) and Afganistan to confront or attack Iran therefore the US will be outstandingly silent for these days.

Prediction comes true : US will expel over 50 Russian diplomats in the coming days. #US #Russia #UK
@ClaudiaAlMinah By Aug. Turkey will no longer be a tide in the political storm.
@ChiefPentSpox but again Turkey maybe not allow US to use injilik airbase against Iran or for other purposes!
@steffanwatkins @TheWarOfNow where to head?
Turkish planes are flying over Sinjar right now. #Iraq #Kurdistan #US
4-(mostly unlikely to happen): US make a better fence around Israel, in another term, building the next Israel (connecing parts of Kurdistan in Syria,Iraq,Iran and Turkey) to solve the Mideast problems as well. #Iraq #Syria #Turkey #Iran
3-US does everything to persuade Turkey to disobey Russia in weakening NATO role internationally, thus again Kurds may get sarificed as well. #Kurdistan #Turkey #Iraq #Syria
2-Iran may confront Turkey if increases her presence in Syria and Iraq because thus Iran's role will be downplayed automatically. #Syria #Iran #Turkey
1-US may again sacrifice the Kurds to appease Erdogan of Turkey, it seems Erdogan promised Trump to use Injrlik airbase against Iran. @FoxNews @cnni @BBCWorld
