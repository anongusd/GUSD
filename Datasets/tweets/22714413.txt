@davecannFSED @UCOMMBlog @banditelli The texting we had was very clunky had to create lists by but only worked if we had good data that we could legally text ( bc wasn't p2p). Which is a whole nother can of worms re labor.
@davecannFSED @UCOMMBlog @banditelli Oh, I don't know who is doing what with this tech as far as labor. I left my local last March to do politics. I will say it was never easy to get buy in. We had texting and some other basic stuff, but there isn't a lot of support for innovation in labor. This would take pol will.

@davecannFSED @UCOMMBlog @banditelli There is all this distributive campaign technology that is used in politics now that labor just needs to retrofit.

@davecannFSED @UCOMMBlog @banditelli Reaching out via social media using targetting software, Mail, I also really like using Hustle to blast out stuff to big lists via txt. Really high volume with like a 90% read rate.

My epiphany in all of this was the shallowness of the right-wing rhetoric of being willing to "fight" for a "freedom" that is by default conceived of as a society where they and their families they hold up as sacred are permanently impoverished and exploited. https://t.co/uhW13AsHn5
In summary, white supremacy isn't just an ideology of hate and oppression of others. It is the key force weakening the working-class from shaking off it's chains. It is an ideology of subservience to corporate and oligarchic power.
Where I have usually seen this change was in workplace organizing where conservative white workers usually split over supporting organizing with one part uniting with their coworkers to form a union or win a contract.but the ideology always keeps some on the side of the boss.
The hold of white supremacists is so intense that they never even consider directing that rage at the forces ACTUALLY impoverishing them and their families they claim to hold so dear. This force would compel someone to never even consider rebellion over their own actual interests
This folks have not one reason to feel any loyalty to the powers that be. Yet, for all their rhetoric about family, bravery, loyalty, and freedom they choose to focus all their rage &amp; rhetoric on manufactured enemies declaring their determination to fight and die to defeat them.
Thread-	I run across a lot of #MAGA C.H.U.D.S where I live in South Fulton County. After getting a eyeful of various Uber patriotic, NRA, InfoWars gear the other day, I had an epiphany about the strength of white supremacist culture and the power in has over white working people.

@MatthewWolfsen There is actually pretty extensive history.
By that I mean that where possible we win them away through finding a multiracial populist narrative that trumps racism, but also should look at ways that we can demoralize and atomize their forces who are beyond persuasion, (ie the bulk).
Where a "new" majority coalition is possible, obviously that is the path to win, esp in the south. At the same time more thought has to be given on a strategy to undermine right wing influence over white workers. By persuasion where possible, by disillusionment where necessary.
White supremacy is the chief barrier to social progress in America today. #Mississippi's election results are the latest example. It is the misguided perception of social equality as a threat that leads working-class whites to make common cause with billionaires and big banks.
