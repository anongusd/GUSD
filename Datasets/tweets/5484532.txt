@MarkImpomeni Yep. Who knows?
@MarkImpomeni All good points. I wouldn't object at all.	Just seems they've been more interested in Machado, and I'd like to see them add 1 of the superstars available this offseason.
@MarkImpomeni I think they tried to get another starter this offseason. I'd take 1 of the best players in baseball - young and semi-cheap - and create options w/ Andujar while seeking another bullpen arm.
@VictorinoMatus One or the other, Vic. I'm not gonna gorge myself here.	Gotta keep my svelte figure.
@jameswester Heh.	That's my take. Plus he's young, the price isn't that high, in baseball terms. Seems a no-brainer to me.
