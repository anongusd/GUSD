@Mormonger Meaning, perhaps the vessel of the body is not necessarily intertwined with the spirit and those spirits could be assigned other bodies if an abortion is performed. How about 1st trimester miscarriages? Was that miscarried body that assigned spirits one chance at life?
@Mormonger But not permanently fixed to the body until live birth. I think this also opens up the possibility that the movement of souls to different bodies is much more fluid than ee currently understand doctrinally
@Mormonger In 3rd Nephi, Christ is still speaking as the Lord a day before He is born. Opening up the possibility that the soul's movement is fluid throughout pregnancy. I believe the verse says "For on the morrow come I into the world" I think a soul could be assigned at conception...
@calvinjburke Finally blocked them all huh?
@McconneyMichael He's just a super nice guy who's a little too controlling. He once stood at the ppit and said that Pres Nelson was the only person we could trust in the world.
@Matt____FL Cal is very well read at least. I think all members should be acquainted with Bushman and Quinn at the very least.
@calvinjburke Probably for the best...
@MormonDisc Any firm dates on your Jim Bennett interview release?
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir I guess I view it in a different way. Thats alright! It is true that the early church members described these things in a physical sense. I think they were much nore open and believing than the church of today.
@riding_tapir @ConflictJustice Its unfortunate that this account views the physicality of the event as necessary for its validity and truthfulness.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir Thats unfortunate, how do you reconcile that woth the 1844 account of the first vision and the written experiences regarding D&amp;C 76?
@riding_tapir @ConflictJustice I have no fetching idea. Its a huge disappointment once you start studying church history and stop dismissing anything that isnt approved by the church.
@riding_tapir @ConflictJustice I think a good argument to that is that it doesntnecessarily make those spiritual things less of a reality for many people. Ive spoken to hundreds of people who have claimed to see Christ in vision. It makes early church history more down to earth.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir In your view, is seeing the first vision as a spiritual event degrading to your understanding of its reality? If Joseph saw it within his mind, would that make it less real?
@Matt____FL Very true, im not trying to. Im simply pointing out that the apostles and prophets today cannot claim the same boldness as Joseph Smith. I wish they did, and the D&amp;C type revelation rolled forth again.
@riding_tapir @ConflictJustice For some reason, church members see the spiritual visions of the early church as less real or true than physical visitations. A great historical example is Joseph and Sidney rigdon receiving the vision of the 3 kingdoms with other people in the room.
@thekwakuel Joseph sure wasn't shy with sharing what the Lord had spoken to him. But I respect your faith in Nelson that his words are the words of the Lord.
@Matt____FL Brigham Young, Heber J. Grant, and president Monson have all publicly stated they have not. Heber is famous for saying he didnt k ow of anyone who had seen the Lord since Joseph Smith.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir I respect your belief and the side you have taken within the historical narrative. Unfortunately, there are just as many quotes on the other side of the argument. But I respect your choice to choose faith and trust in Joseph Smith.
@JPBellum The Jews were pretty hard core with their excommunication
@Matt____FL Prophets who never hear or see the Lord they claim to serve? Impressions are great, but where is the "thus saith the Lord" prophet found in Joseph Smith? Is our bar so low in the church that policy changes and a determination to protect doctrine is the only bar a prophet hits?
@thekwakuel Do policy changes and administrative decisions equal revelation? I long for the days when those claiming to be prophets were bold like Joseph Smith, who sought legitimate "thus saith the Lord" type of revelation. Joseph had cahonas if nothing else
@ConflictJustice I think at times their attempts at lds shock value and catching people off guard with an information blast is just easier than having a thoughtful discussion. A lot of them are hurt and bitter and angry.
@JPBellum I guess Christ was a proud heretic. His presiding authority did have Him crucified after all
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir It also allows members of the church to seek after their own spiritual manifestations if they understand the mechanisms behind them. The fact that the Father and the Son appeared in vision in the 1844 account doesnt make it less of a real historical event.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir It definitely is though. That doesnt make the visions of Joseph Smith or the witnesses fake or irrelevant. Understanding how D&amp;C sections like 110 came about is paramount to the understanding of mormonism. Joseph Smith would describe his visions within his mind as very real.
@JPBellum Christ was called a heretic by the pharisees. Don't be a part if the modern day lds generation of vipers.
@calvinjburke @Luv2GoFly Great observations. I had a question for you, of the current top 15, who do you give the best chances of making the biggest impact and policy changes for the lgbt community if they were prophet?
@hankrsmith In a spiritual sense the imagery of fire and brimestone never made sense to me. Outer darkness sounds cold though
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir In scripture this is referred to as "the eye of faith" "the eyes of our understanding" and the "spiritual eye". Eastern religions call it the 3rd eye.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir ...not the first visitation. Josephs first vision account as listed in the 1844 wentworth letter where we derive the articles of faith from explains this beautifully. The 3 witnesses of the BOM additionally received their visions of the plates spiritually as well.
@ConflictJustice @riding_tapir In my opinion, we have emphasized physical and nstural visitation so much we no longer understand how the spiritual processes of the early church worked. Everyrhing they saw was with the spiritual eyes or secularly known as second sight. The first vision is called a vision..
@calvinjburke @Luv2GoFly So you're saying the BYU's are all we have left? Good golly...
@LordwhiteD It hasnt been a voice since the 1840's. Its all about those feelings now.
@calvinjburke @Luv2GoFly Thank you for the correction. I didnt realize it was that low. Where'd you get that from?
@SLCnotUTAH @jakedayton26 @AntiCommieSoc @calvinjburke From what ive seen, it is a constant struggle between two worlds. The religious standards and doctrines of the church, and an orientation that is often rejected and demonized within that same system.
@SLCnotUTAH @jakedayton26 @AntiCommieSoc @calvinjburke Not at all, I'm assuming you may not personally understand the full cultural and practical implications of the experience lgbt latter day saints experience. It is a position with no doctrinal answers, and that  leads to a lot of pain and loneliness.
@AntiCommieSoc @calvinjburke Members like Calvin are in pain, and desperately want to make the church work with the hand they've been given. I think both sides see each other as attacking each other. Mormon twitter is definitely not Zion.
@Luv2GoFly @calvinjburke With a 40% active rate dometically and a 30% active rate internationally with stagnant percentage growth I wouldn't necessarily call that flourishing. Those same plagues of inactivity are affecting all sects currently but the church isnt stixking out much on that trend.
@calvinjburke They are scared, and also convicted in what they believe. Similar to the pharisees, to them they are maintaing and preserving a dying way of life and interpretation of mormonism. You can see this in their admiration of leaders like Young and Packer.
@ConflictJustice @Matt____FL @overheardinmor1 Are the terms dismissing and white washing preferred? Denying that these things were taught as doctrine and not policy is dishonest at best and gaslighting at worst
@sug_knight The very real fear that this life is all there is and my consciousness melts away into oblivion once my brain activity stops. Sometimes even that isnt enough though so im grateful for my wife and kids
@Matt____FL @overheardinmor1 It was at the time though. And denying it was openly taught as doctrine by prophets and apostles for 100 years is gaslighting at its best.
@OfSifter Im one of those I guess then. I think that if Joseph was a prophet, the jeys died with him and the Lord is working among many christian sects to bring about his work.
@hankrsmith How successful do you think the members are at being born again? We hardly see any kind of ecperiences like the lamanites in Helaman, or like Lamoni, or like the nephites in 3rd nephi.
@calvinjburke I feel like I understand your view nore than ever before. Thank you for sharing your sacred experiences and for being vulnerable so we can all learn to be better allys
@OfSifter Also, the rlds have become incredibly secular, and reject the spiritual portions for the most part of mormonism's history. Or at least they welcome that view.
@OfSifter Some are or are spread out among dozens of lds break off groups. If youre referring to the remnant movement, the general belief is that the keys died with Joseph Smith and he retains them to this day.
@Matt____FL What will your personal reaponse be if the preaident of the church issues a change like that? Would you support it at that time?
@ConflictJustice Faith is really a choice on both sides. I wish both sidea understood each other better. There ia room for faith in the historical facts of the church, but there is also ample evidence to choose not to believe in it.
@gopTODD Its amazing how ignorant and arrogant you can be all at the same time. Please never run for national office.
@MormonDisc Hey Bill! Just dove into your podcast and RFM about 2 weeks ago. Thanks for all you do.
@Mormonger @JCBontheDL Some even beleive he had a body on this world and that outer darkness is actually where those who are evil want to br and grow their own evil dominions
@Mormonger @JCBontheDL Some alternative mormons believe satan can be forgiven and even start over. A lot of varied possibilities like that in the lds remnant/ denver snuffer crowd

@Matt____FL The church is doing better now than they have historically with posted essays but those essays still arent common knowledge among the members
@Matt____FL Even if those sources don't tell the whole picture? It seems like even Saints left out significant details regarding Joseph Smith and his early life. If the church's sources are going to purposely omit certain details what can you do?
@bobdaduck @JPBellum I struggle especially with Brigham Young personally. Blood atonement, Adam-God, the priesthood ban, and sexualized polygamy are my biggest issuee to overcome.
@JPBellum Great response, i appreciate your answer
@JPBellum How do you personally view the views and doctrines of past prophets that have been disavowed by current lds leaders? How do you justify it in your own mind?
@calvinjburke I think its important to point out that both the telestial and terrestrial kingdoms are kingdoms of God. Its an incredibly merciful doctrine.

@LatterDayOK I sincerely with all my heart wish there were real answers to the way that Brigham lived his life and led the church. It honestly breaks my heart he wasnt the firebrand prophet I was raised to believe in as our sole source of apostolic authority.

@JPBellum @calvinjburke I am infinitely curious what #deznat would do or believe if the LDS church did implement the doctrinal changes or adjustments that @calvinjburke advocates for.  I believe many of them would funnel off into modern fundamentalist schisms believing the church was fallen.
@JuliaGoolia9 @calvinjburke Many would say thats what the modern lds church teaches and enforced with their active members on many social issues. Many within the social right are posting real quotes from past LDS leaders. I think many feel those past positions are being attacked anf mayne thats a good thing
@DmAllisonWyles @calvinjburke It sure does. I guess I am just tryi g to point out the very real and raw emotions coming to a point on both the left and right sides of lds twitter.
@JuliaGoolia9 @calvinjburke Whether that is true or not, that is how this geoup feels and how they felt they needed to respond to the Liberal LDS majority found on this platform.
@JuliaGoolia9 @calvinjburke This is just my personal take away after following both sides for quite some time. #deznat seems to be the natural conservative and defensive response to what many hardline mountainwest lds members are seeing as an attack on their leaders and doctrine.
@calvinjburke @AmateurWrites Ya know whats funny is until deznat was a thing I would say the Denver Snuffer movement was closer to an Alt-mormon group.
@calvinjburke My point was a reaction such as #deznat was inevitable when this minority opinion is plastered as the face of current LDS thought. You and many others helped create the apparent need for this kind of reaction.
@calvinjburke This may be your take on it. However, it appears disingenuous and dismissive to doctrine as it currently stands within the LDS church. Although your views and other LDS liberal views are the majority on twitter, they are the minority within the physical church.
@ConflictJustice Offensive may take it a little far. This isnt meant to demean or mock the church, if anything its pure indifference by people like @religiongal who have contributed to LDS issues through many LDS administrations
Individuals like @calvinjburke seem to be pushing for real doctrinal change in practice and in theology which is unacceptable to #deznat individuals. Whoever is on the right side of lds history may see schisms in either direction like the FLDS or the Ordain Women movement.
.. And has created the movement and reaction we are seeing today. Both sides share some responsibility for what is happening. Liberal LDS twitter for falsely classifying their views as approved doctrine and the hardline lds members for a failure to listen to those who are hurting
Looking from the outside in, it seems that #deznat is the forceful reaction to the online lds community being taken over by an incredibly liberal and lgbt agenda that does indeed stand in contrast to modern teachings coming out of SLC, that frustration seems to have boiled over..

@RepBenMcAdams @SLIndivisible I appreciate your moderate approach. This is why republicans like myself voted for you.
