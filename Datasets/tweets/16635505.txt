Bossie and Lewandowski credit Pence’s nephew — Indiana attorney John Pence who joined the campaign in August 2016 — with helping come up with the “crowd-building” system used for campaign events.
Bossie, who worked for former Indiana Rep. Dan Burton, had known Pence since he served in Congress. Pence’s daughter, Charlotte, had interned with Bossie’s conservative advocacy group Citizens United.
In Lewandowki's and Bossie's book about the 2016 campaign, Bossie said he was the one who “had the privilege of informing Governor Pence” that he had just been elected vice president. 	https://t.co/F6SriXzuOB

Christie described himself as not willing to lobby for the job of No. 2 as Trump held a final meeting with Pence in Indiana.	But @ANealAuthor has written that Eric Trump's driver heard Eric say Christie had repeatedly called his father during the meeting.
When Christie confronted Pence by phone, “he hemmed and hawed but had no real explanation” for the lack of warning, Christie wrote.		But Trump calmed down “a bit” after learning how much Pence had praised Trump while officially backing Cruz.
“Are you kidding me?” Trump told Christie after Pence endorsed Cruz. “You take me out to see this guy and then the guy screws me? He stabs me in the back by endorsing Cruz? And how come he didn’t give you any heads-up?"
Christie wrote that Pence asked him for an introduction to Trump in 2016 when he was deciding whether to endorse a GOP presidential candidate. Pence's camp has said it was Trump who reached out to him.
Christie wrote that Pence begged him to attend a fundraiser for Pence's 2012 gubernatorial campaign. “Chris, please,” Pence said, according to the book. “This donor says he’ll raise a huge amount of money if you’re here. Please.”

Conclusion: While the combination of lower Dem support in rural areas &amp; higher Dem support around cities may help Dems in more urbanized states like TX, it’s a bad trade for them in states like these &amp; may make winning a majority in the Senate, with its small-state bias, harder.
What probably saved Montana Sen. Jon Tester is that he didn’t drop off by as much in sparsely populated counties as other Democratic senators did. In counties with fewer than 20,000 residents, Tester’s average dropoff was 8 percentage points. Donnelly’s was 27 percentage points
Donnelly’s loss of rural support, coupled with his inability to make up for those losses with more votes in urban areas, sealed his fate.
After winning by 6% points in 2012, Donnelly lost by 6 points in 2018. Donnelly improved upon his 2012 performance in only three counties — Boone, Hamilton and Monroe  — and even there, just barely. https://t.co/V9HJdJXmD4

If he were asked to help make Pence funny, Parvin said he would urge Pence to surprise the people who think they know him.		“Show me a little more sinner and a little less saint,” Parvin said. “I think that would relax his persona some.”
Pence’s own sense of humor is a mystery to many.		“He’s deadpanned. Which is potentially good. But he’s deadpanned stern, not deadpanned funny,” said Republican speechwriter Landon Parvin.
Bill Horner, who co-authored a book about Saturday Night Live and the 1976 presidential election, sees the jokes that paint Pence as being prudish, homophobic and super-religious as revealing an underlying fear from the writers of what would happen if Pence replaced Trump.
The effect of political humor on a politician’s reputation varies, according to experts. But it’s more likely to have an impact on the image of someone like Pence, who did not have a national profile before becoming vice president, than on President Donald Trump.
Of the 80 jokes targeting Pence on the late-night talk shows in 2017, most were about his alleged dull personality, prudishness and homophobia, according to a database compiled by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University.
“He is really portrayed as a Christian fundamentalist, very homophobic, the whitest person in politics,” said @EdoSteinberg. “He’s a very sinister character.”

Clarification: Pence's trip to Indiana is a quick in-and-out today. He won't be there all weekend.
Obst, Ayers, Pitcock and Marc Short, who was Trump’s first director of legislative affairs, are part of a tight circle of Pence advisers. Obst is someone who can talk to Pence and give him bad news, according to one Indiana Republican.
Pence’s first  VP COS was Josh Pitcock, who had worked for Pence as governor and in the House. Ayers and Obst were working together on Pence’s gubernatorial re-election campaign when Trump made Pence his running mate.
If Pence needs to find a new top aide, it's unlikely he'd do so without consulting Obst, his senior political adviser. And after playing other big roles for Pence, would Obst now want to be COS? That would be consistent w/ Pence’s practice of putting long-time aides in key spots.

Donnelly's resounding loss in nearly every corner of the state shocked Gregg. He doesn't think any Senate candidate has campaigned as hard as Donnelly in decades. Donnelly, he said, made a point to come home frequently and hit every county. https://t.co/tFBDDqJJqT
"We have to find issues that cut across some of the typical lines," Buttigieg said. "I strongly believe we should contest every county in every part of the state."
Mayor Buttigieg thinks the path forward will be different than the traditional Indiana Democratic strategy. He cited an AP poll that found the only age group that voted as a majority for Republicans Tuesday was 65 and older.
Political scientist Andy Downs said Donnelly's formula was wrong &amp; the result was a lower-than-expected turnout from his base. “Every election is winnable, but Dems have to ask themselves if the model that was so successful for them in the ‘80s and ‘90s is still the right model."
Kip Tew, a former Indiana Democratic Party chairman who ran Obama’s 2008 Indiana campaign, said Donnelly did little to excite African Americans and those in the left wing of the party, a coalition that helped propel Democrats to victory elsewhere in the country.
Despite Donnelly's loss this year and Bayh's 2 years ago, Bayh said he doesn't see how a different type of Democrat could do better in Indiana. https://t.co/G90a5hKV7B

If Mueller's report makes R's wary of sticking with Trump, Pence's extensive campaigning for lawmakers could tip the scales.		“Who has friends among House members?" said @EKamarck. "It ain’t Donald Trump. It’s Mike Pence.”

Groups like Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, which have organized protesters at some of his events and say opposition to Pence’s record has helped them raise money and motivate their voters, are trying to prevent him from flying completely under the radar.
If Trump dominates the headlines, Pence has amassed a different measure of impact. He’s raised more than $70 million for fellow Republicans and made more than 140 candidate rallies or fundraising events, according to his political team.

Pence declines to publicly weigh in on battle for next GOP leader in the House when asked in a Politico Playbook interview if he supports Rep. Kevin McCarthy. Pence said McCarthy has done an outstanding job but he will leave the decision up to House Republicans.
Pence said he still believes, as he did when he pushed in Congress for a media shield bill, that the only check on government power in real time is a free &amp; independent press.		"President Trump believes that as well," @vp said. "Unquestionably."
“I’m a Hoosier at heart, to my core,” he wrote.

But the Senate race ranks only 16th for the amount of $ spent on Facebook and Google ads from May 31-Oct. 15 -- $203,200.
Indiana ranks 3rd (behind FL &amp; MO) for the most $ spent on Senate race advertising this cycle -- about $44 million.
About half of the ads on Donnelly's side were about China/trade.		About four in 10 of the ads on Braun's side mentioned health care.
On Donnelly's side, Dem grups ran more ads than Donnelly did or the party did.		On Braun's side, he ran more ads than outside groups or the party.

Indy's densely-populated and fast-growing suburbs are a significant chunk of the statewide vote. Two years ago, 423,406 voters in Indy's suburb cast a ballot in the presidential election — far more than the 370,498 who live in blue-leaning Marion County.
Trump carried 56% of the vote two years ago in Hamilton County, ten percentage points fewer than Mitt Romney won in 2012. The drop was clearly aimed at Trump as down ballot Republicans still won more than 70% of the vote.
Donnelly opened his first campaign field office in April in Carmel and he's held more than 60 events in Indy's suburbs, including launching his "Women for Joe" constituency group.
Braun is working to protect that turf, connecting with voters and bringing in big-name Republicans to the suburbs to bolster his chances.

@derekwillis Too bad the ranks of the Washington-based regional reporters and local political reporters who go through the reports have been greatly diminished.
@bykowicz Republicans know Braun has his own $ and they have to give to others to keep up with Dems fundraising surge for congressional candidates?
If you subtract the $685K that Braun has spent on loan repayments to himself, he's spent about $11.5 million overall compared with Donnelly's $10.4 million. (Braun won a 3-way GOP primary and Donnelly was unopposed for the Dem nomination.)
Braun raised about $413,000 in small-dollar contributions from individuals in the last quarter.  Donnelly raised about $740,000.
Braun said after the primary that he wasn't going to spend more of his own $. Despite fundraising help from @VP, he's had to kick in his own funds for the general after all.
About 42% of the $5.6 million that @braun4indiana raised in the 3Q came from his own pockets. In all, he's loaned his primary and general election campaigns about $8.8 million.

@dshesgreen @USATODAY “China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections,” Pence said in a highly anticipated speech to the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.

Charlotte Pence has advice for future occupants of Number One Observatory Circle: Tell the vice president to drive the golf carts.
The @vp's daughter says her parents would have been supportive had she become an atheist. "At the end of the day, it’s more important to them that we aren’t just following along and that we have our own convictions and that we hold tight to those," she said.
She also got some advice from Michelle Obama about how to handle what was to come. After the inauguration ceremony, Charlotte and Audrey shook Obama's hand.		“Hold tight to each other,” Michelle Obama told the sisters. “You’re all you have now.”
Pence said she wanted to write “an uplifting positive book with stories that could hopefully encourage people.”		She does make an opaque reference to challenges, writing that her family was “not immune to the divisiveness the election brought out in people."
Charlotte Pence doesn’t reveal what it was like to go through some of the controversial campaign moments, such as the release of the "Access Hollywood" recording in which Trump bragged about groping women.
After the election, when the Pences were invited by outgoing Vice President Joe Biden to see the home that would soon be theirs, Charlotte hid in the car because she didn't want to look disrespectful for having worn blue jeans.
The day her family started receiving Secret Service protection, Charlotte wrote in her journal: “They do not like revolving doors. Honestly, who does?”
Arriving in New York City for Trump’s announcement of his running-mate, Charlotte clung to the edge of her dad’s suit coat so as not to get dragged behind with the crowd as they fought through a mob of reporters to enter their hotel.
Pence’s book includes glimpses of what it’s like – even for someone who grew up as the daughter of a public official – to be thrust onto the huge stage of a presidential campaign.
The lesson the Pence family took away from misunderstanding a congressional event for families -- and bringing their menagerie of pets to Capitol Hill was: “If you take yourselves too seriously in D.C., you miss all the fun.”
Charlotte Pence says she would not have wanted to share the 2016 election with anyone besides the Trump family. 		 “Their kindness, inclusion, and generosity was something I have tried to learn from and emulate in any capacity,” she writes in her new book.
.@vp's daughter was impressed by @HillaryClinton when they met at the post-inauguration lunch. Clinton addressed her, not the man next to her, &amp; took a personal interest in her.		 “Of all people, she would have been somewhat justified in being curt to me, but she was not.”
.@VP keeps in his top desk drawer a Father’s Day present he received years ago. His daughter compiled into a moleskin notebook the lessons she’d learned from him. 		Ride horses every chance you get. Call cashiers by the name on their nametag. Never shout. Anger does not inspire.
The @vp's daughter explains why her "heart broke" when the cast of "Hamilton" addressed her dad after the 2016 election.
Here's the Donnelly ad his campaign didn't publicize to the media yesterday, in which he fights back/attacks on outsourcing charges. (Note: He has his own blue shirt.)		https://t.co/86rlg1u6lX

"Voters with a college degree support Donnelly by 10 points, while those without a degree go for Braun by 3 points."
"Men are more likely to back Braun by a 9-point margin, while women pick Donnelly by 11."
Interesting near-even divide among IN voters on how Donnelly should vote on Kavanuagh:		"If Donnelly votes against Kavanaugh, 30% say it would make them more likely to vote for him, 32% say less likely, and 34% say no difference."
In reversal from last Fox poll, Donnelly is ahead of Braun. But I think we can still call this race a tossup. https://t.co/bh4TwoCcJ8

@BrianJSmith22 @JoeforIndiana @LucyBrenton The pollster told me that if you give a 3rd party candidate option you tend to overestimate their vote share. If you don't, you underestimate, so it's a judgment call. If Brenton is mounting a serious candidacy, she could get more than the 3% the poll shows for "other," he said.

"I do believe this fall's election is challenging," Perkins said. "But I do believe the values voters who are more in tune, and more astute, than they're given credit for in the media know what's at stake.
The Family Research Council is launching a bus tour of 12 states, building up to a 90-minute national simulcast event the Sunday before the election to talk about key issues and to pray.
The message they’re sending this year is that if Democrats take control of Congress, they will try to take Trump down and they will stop approving his nominations.		“That’s what’s at stake: impeachment and judges,” Reed said.
“I am worried about intensity among liberal and Democratic voters,” said Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition which has launched its most ambitious voter outreach campaign ever. “The other side is coming, and they’re coming in record numbers.”
About half of voters said this summer that they are more enthusiastic about voting this year compared with previous congressional elections. 		But only 47 percent of white evangelical Protestants were more enthused, compared with 51 percent of all registered voters.

.@OpenSecretsDC calculated that 28.5% of Donnelly's itemized contributions came from women.  That compares with 52% for Tammy Baldwin, 49% for Bernie Sanders and 48% for Dianne Feinstein.
Donnelly has received a smaller share of his contributions from women than nearly all Senate Democrats facing re-election this year, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Amid speculation that the allegations against Kavanaugh will make it extremely difficult for Donnelly to vote for him without being shunned by the Democrat base, I'm reminded of one sign that he could already be having trouble with women.

Both the NBC and Fox polls rate the economy/jobs and health care as the top issues for likely voters. Immigration is third.
Demand Justice, which opposes Kavanaugh, is touting its poll that shows most undecided voters in IN don't care about the nomination but about 1/3 of Donnelly supporters say they would be less likely to vote for Donnelly if he backs Kavanaugh.
Fox poll asked registered voters if they are more or less likely to vote for Donnelly if he votes against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 		-- 21% more likely to vote for Donnelly	-- 29% less likely to vote for Donnelly	-- 39% no difference
Pence tops Trump, Donnelly and Braun for favorability rating in Fox poll.		Pence net fav: 17% points (56% fav-39% unfav)	Trump net fav: 10% points (54% fav - 44% unfav)	Donnelly net fav: 13% points (52% fav - 39% unfav)	Braun net fav: 9% points (47% fav - 38% unfav)
Here's the difference on Braun's fav/unfav among likely voters:		NBC poll: 39% favorable; 32% unfavorable.		Fox poll: 47% favorable; 38% unfavorable.
Here's the difference on Donnelly's fav/unfav among likely voters:		NBC poll: 48% favorable; 31% unfavorable.		Fox poll: 52% favorable; 39% unfavorable.
Another difference is Trump's approval rating among likely Indiana voters:		NBC poll has Trump approval 48%; Disapproval 46%.		Fox poll has Trump approval 54%; Disapproval 44%.
There's an odd difference between the polls on support from women.		NBC poll has women favoring Donnelly 53-37%.		Fox poll has women favoring Braun 46-41%.
This contrasts with last week's NBC poll which had Donnelly ahead of Braun, 44-41 percent. (MOE 5% pts.) Libertarian Lucy Brenton got 8% in NBC poll and 3% in Fox poll.
A Fox News poll of Indiana likely voters shows Republican challenger Mike Braun ahead of Donnelly by 45-43 percent. Margin of error is 3.5% pts. https://t.co/GwSuvAlqPh #FoxNews

John McCain: Four things to know about Vice President Mike Pence's American Legion speech https://t.co/NopDPIIFzA via @usatoday
Pence: It is the soldier, not the minister, who has given us freedom of religion. It’s the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press.
Unlike his boss, @vp talks tough on Russia (though he lumps Russia together with China.)		"Today, Russia and China are challenging American influence wherever they can," Pence told the American Legion. "America is no longer ignoring these threats."
As reported in @HoosierHoundDog's biography of Pence, he relied heavily on the “Growth and Development of the American Constitution” by Loren Noblitt to prepare for the speech contests. His coach said Pence read it over and over and it “obviously had an influence on his life.”
Pence said the American Legion's speech contests "began my lifelong love for the Constitution of the United States."
Pence at the American Legion: "I can assure you, America will always remember and honor the lifetime of service of United States Sen. John McCain.....By honoring him, we also honor all of you. "
Introducing @vp at the American Legion, the emcee notes that Pence won	the American Legion’s Indiana Oratorical Contest as a high school senior. 		"I guess that scholarship was put to good use," she said.

The armed service will require approval by Congress. The Air Force, the newest of the armed services dating to 1947, has the largest stake in space. It already contains a Space Command, which it established in 1982.
Pence says the administration will ask Congress to fund Space Force in the budget request it will submit early next year.
Pence says the administration wants it established by 2020.
The new force would likely be carved out a chunk of the Air Force, creating two smaller, weaker services, according to military analysts.

What you need to know about Joe Donnelly's and Mike Braun's records on abortion issues https://t.co/qPkkYmL926 via @indystar
“I’ve been on record from the get-go that I’m 100 percent pro-life,” Braun said when asked why he doesn’t support any exceptions.
Anti-abortion groups are also critical of Donnelly while praising GOP challenger, Mike Braun, who says he s “100 percent pro-life” — including opposing abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the woman. Donnelly makes exceptions in all three cases.
“I am, and have been, disappointed in his continued failure to advocate for Hoosier women and families regarding issues of reproductive justice,” said Emily O’Brien, vice president of the Indiana National Organization for Women, which is pressuring Donnelly to reject Kavanaugh.
Donnelly — one of three Senate Democrats who voted in January to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — needs Republican votes to win re-election. But he risks alienating motivated Democrats if he backs a Supreme Court nominee who might overturn Roe v. Wade.
Still, Donnelly is one of only 3 Senate Democrats who does not have a 100% voting record with Planned Parenthood, voting with them 67% of the time.		The National Right to Life Committee counts Donnelly as having voted their way 57% of the time.
“I am comfortable that he got to a point where he’s supportive of the funding of entities that provide health care, particularly to the less fortunate,” said Betty Cockrum, the former longtime leader of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.
Donnelly used to vote to block Planned Parenthood from receiving government funding for non-abortion services but changed his position in late 2015.
Donnelly was one of the final holdouts on the ACA, not agreeing to vote for it until Obama said he would sign an executive order stating none of the new health care funds could be spent on abortions. Both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups opposed that compromise.
“What that says is, all life is critical from conception to natural death,” Donnelly said. “To me, pro-life is actually a broader discussion.”
Both Donnelly and Braun say their anti-abortion views are rooted in their Catholic faiths. But Donnelly emphasizes that he follows the “seamless garment” view of a “consistent ethic of life” on issues including not just abortion, but also euthanasia and social justice issues.
Anti-abortion groups are also critical of Donnelly while praising GOP challenger, Mike Braun, who says he s “100 percent pro-life” — including opposing abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the woman. Donnelly makes exceptions in all three cases.
In a year when women are breaking records for campaign donations, Donnelly has received a smaller share of his contributions from women than nearly all Senate Democrats facing re-election this year, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Donnelly is again being targeted for defeat by anti-abortion groups while not getting help from abortion rights advocates — despite the fact that both sides say he’s been with them on more than half of their most important votes.

Pence Tuesday: "Yet it concerns us that many states still don’t have concrete plans to upgrade their voting systems, and 14 states are struggling to replace outdated voting machines that lack paper trails before the next presidential election. "

NYT: The 4 states also include significant minority communities that do not always vote enthusiastically in midterms: mainly black voters in Tennessee, Missouri and Indiana, and Hispanic voters in Arizona.
“These are states that you need to do everything to win,” Mr. Dunn said. “You have to have close margins in areas that are harder for Democrats, but we also need to increase participation in areas where we are strong.”
Paul Dunn, a strategist for Senate Majority PAC, told the NYT that Democrats need both to drive up turnout among left-leaning voters in those states and to make inroads in more conservative communities.
NYT: For Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of those states, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states.
Since Donnelly left the House for the Senate, the 2nd CD - which used to be a swing district - is now Republican. But the tilt is small enough that it's one of the seats Dems think they have a chance of picking up if there's a big enough blue wave.

The campaign arm of Senate Republicans transferred nearly $50,000 to Braun’s campaign.
Members of Messer’s finance committee who have given the maximum contribution to Braun include former state GOP Chairman Al Hubbard and John Hammond, one of Indiana’s representative on the Republican National Committee.
Some of the top backers of Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer have since contributed to Braun’s campaign. For example, Dan Dumezich, who was Rokita’s finance chairman, gave Braun the maximum $2,700 general election contribution, as did his wife.
Of the $243,400 Braun raised from PACs in the last Q, about 70% came from PACs controlled by GOP senators. More than half of the 51 Republicans in the Senate contributed to Braun, as did House Speaker Ryan, Vice President Pence, and a PAC supporting President Trump’s campaign.
People who did not contribute to Braun’s primary race can give a max $2,700 to help him retire his debt. PACs can give $5,000.		Braun received more than $260,000 in debt retirement contributions while essentially shifting debt from the primary to the general.
He’s repaid himself nearly $100,000 in four payments since the primary, while almost immediately loaning his campaign equal amounts.
Braun, a Jasper businessman with two companies, had said he would not self-fund his general election campaign after spending about $6 million of his own money to win the May primary.
The disclosure report Braun has since filed with the Senate shows nearly $1 million of his $2.5 million raised was in personal loans. Of that, about $350,000 was loaned after the primary. Braun told CNN after the primary that he would not self-fund the general election.
Braun raised less than Donnelly in the 2Q when not counting personal loans. His disclosure report contradicts a misleading press release from his campaign this month. https://t.co/9E3RcuVVJb via @indystar
Neal interviewed the motorcade driver who spotted the plane's flat tire and alerted the Secret Service. The driver was told that a faulty brake caused the flat and a repair part had to be ordered before Trump could leave.
Neal debunks a CBS News report that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort lied about the plane's mechanical problems in an attempt to get Trump to pick Pence over New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Even when amending RFRA become inevitable, Pence felt trapped between personal conviction &amp; political reality. “Pressed by some of his most loyal supporters to veto or amend the fix, Pence briefly wavered,” Neal writes, but was told legislative leaders would no longer negotiate.
On Pence’s radio show, he regularly featured people with different opinions. One station even dropped Pence’s show when he refused to stop talking to the editor of NUVO, the alternative Indianapolis paper.
When Pence told the mother of a childhood friend that he wanted to be a priest, she replied that he should be a stand-up comedian instead. Imitating Darth Vader and other impressions was among the ways Pence entertained his friends.
Pence isn’t the only notable former member of the Columbus North High School speech team. One sits on the Indiana Supreme Court. Another became a Hollywood actor, singer and songwriter. And Bob Paris, a body-builder, went on to be the first openly gay man to win Mr. Olympia.

She provides the fun detail that Pence got a congratulatory text from kin in Ireland with a photo of a red Trump hat on their door knocker with a note: “Gone celebrating.”
And while other authors have written that Trump’s campaign did not expect to win election night, Neal writes that “at no point in the evening did Pence envision defeat.”
“Are you kidding?” Neal quotes Rex Early, chairman of Trump’s Indiana campaign and former state party leader. “At this point in his career, how many chances is Pence going to get?”
Pence never expressed reluctance to align himself with a candidate rejected by some within his own party, according to the book.
After Nick Ayers was told that Trump would be calling to ask Pence to be his running mate, Pence &amp; his top aides prayed together for wisdom, for “a peace that surpasses all understanding,” and for protection for Pence and his family.
Neal has the scoop that Pence considered replacing his first lieutenant governor with Alex Azar, the former Eli Lilly executive who is now Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services.

"This is not a fun job. It’s a meaningful job. But it’s not fun," Coats said. "Tell me the bad things that happened since I fell asleep."
While there are days when he thinks "what am I doing," Coats said there are a lot more days when he thinks about how critical his mission is.
"As long as I have the ability to seek the truth and speak the truth, I'm on board," Coats says when asked if he's ever considered quitting.
"With this president, we have consistently gone overtime," Coats said. "He does ask a lot of questions. He does have a lot of curiosity."
“They’re relatively regular," Coats says of Trump's daily intelligence briefing. "He wants an oral presentation. We use charts. We use a number of things."
Asked if he believes North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, Coats says time will tell. While the U.S. shouldn't assume that it will work, "why not give it a shot," he said.
Asked if the president is "really engaged" in trying to prevent cyber attacks, Coats doesn't mention Trump specifically when saying it's "clearly one of our top priorities."
"I spent a lifetime trying to get my name in the paper back home," Coats said. "I have a job now where it’s just the opposite."

Donnelly's campaign just sent out an "I’m extremely disappointed" email to supporters. Instead of asking for a contribution, the email asked people to vote on whether Trump's meeting with Putin was a "setback for our national security" or a "positive development."
I haven't seen any comment from Mike Braun about this. But his campaign did send out a fundraising solicitation tonight highlighting this quote:		"Mike Braun will stand with President Trump." - Vice President Mike Pence
Democratic Rep.  Carson, a member of the House intelligence committee, had stronger criticism of Trump: "Never before have we seen a president so dramatically set aside a vital American interest to appease the expectations of a foreign adversary."
Donnelly: When given the chance to stand up for our country and its security interests, President Trump instead emboldened President Putin and disregarded the consensus conclusion of the hard-working and patriotic Americans in the intelligence community.
Sen. Donnelly, by contrast, criticized the president even though he's been careful to not be too critical of Trump as he faces re-election in a state Trump easily won.
Pence will be joining Trump for that meeting with lawmakers tomorrow. https://t.co/uAiRcxY4Py

Walorski: It is undeniable Russia interfered in our election.		Banks: I’ll take the word of a Hoosier over Vladimir Putin any day.
Here are some of the comments from those who explicitly backed Coats and the intelligence community.		Young: I have no reason to doubt the clear conclusions of the intelligence community when it comes to Moscow’s attempts to undermine our democracy.
I haven't seen any comments from Reps. Messer and Hollingsworth.		Rep. Rokita's statement doesn't say whether he believes Russia interfered, just that he sees no evidence of a conspiracy b/w Trump’s campaign &amp; Russia so Mueller should provide evidence or end the investigation.
Among IN's 8 congressional Republicans, Sen. Young and Reps. Walorski, Banks, Brooks &amp; Bucshon have put out statements explicitly backing the US intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in the US election.

Besides Steve Braun, other losing primary candidates who spent a lot of their own $ include:		Yatish Joshi spent $570,550 of his own $ in the Dem CD2 race that was won by Mel Hall.		Jonathan Lamb spent about $470,000 of his own $ in the GOP CD6 race that Greg Pence won.
The IN candidate who spent the most to NOT win a primary is Republican Steve Braun, who spent $1.24 million (of which about $840,000 came from his own pocket.) Braun came in 2nd in the 7-way GOP primary to replace Rep. Rokita. Baird got the nomination.
On type of fundraising, Greg Pence raised the most from individuals this cycle:  $1.4 million		GOP Rep. Jackie Walorksi raised the most from PACs: nearly $1.3 million.
GOP Rep. Susan Brooks had the most $ in the bank at the end of June among IN's House candidates: $1.7 million.
On the spending side, Republican Greg Pence spent the most 4/19-June 30: $439,017.		Pence also spent the most overall of any winning primary House candidate in IN: $1.4 million. (His top GOP primary opponent, Jonathan Lamb, spent about $517,726.)
Of the May primary winners in IN House races, Dem challenger Mel Hall raised the most since mid April (thanks to self loan): $611,240. The incumbent he's challenging, GOP Rep. Jackie Walorski, has raised the most overall this cycle: nearly $2.1 million.
The 4th is one of the 2 open House seats. In the other, the 6th, Greg Pence had $254,512 in the bank at the end of June after spending $1.4 million. Dem primary winner Jeannine Lee Lake has not reported raising any $.
@davidkeller You're correct that I should've said the numbers were from the reporting period of 4/19 through 6/30. I shorthanded that to say 2Q because of Twitter's character limits. 	So for the most recent reporting period, which in IN is April 19-June30, those 3 incumbents were outraised.
To be clear, this is not a full Q because IN's May primary required a pre-primary report that covered the beginning of April. The latest numbers are for the reporting period of April 19, 2018 through June 30, 2018.
I'm not sure I've ever seen such low cash totals by both House candidates four months before an election as was just reported in IN's 4th District. Republican Jim Baird had $30,347 in the bank at the end of June. Dem Tobi Beck had $16,544,
In all 3 Districts, the GOP incumbent still led in banked cash at the end of June.		2nd: Walorski had $1.3 million; Hall had $479,452,		3rd: Banks had $502,401; Tritch had $310,866.		9th: Hollingsworth had $608,576; Watson had $471,348.
IN House challengers who outraised incumbents in the 2Q:		-2nd District: Hall raised $611,240 (mostly from self loan); Walorski raised $418,264		- 3rd District: Tritch raised $168,786; Banks raised $165,849.		- 9th District: Watson raised $486,549; Hollingsworth raised $228,942.

"Because most originalist scholars believe Roe was wrong, there is a belief that most originalist judges would at the very least be skeptical of Roe," Adler said. "But there's still that next step. We have a legal system that relies upon precedent."
Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said that even if a justice believes a previous case was wrongly decided, there are still reasons why he might not vote to overturn the case.
Critics of that judicial philosophy say a Supreme Court dominated by originalists could not just reverse Roe v. Wade, but could also put in jeopardy LGBT rights, race-conscious remedies for discrimination and laws like the Affordable Care Act and the Voting Rights Act.
While Young does not draw a direct line between the judicial philosophy he favors and overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion, others who oppose abortion have -- including @vp and Indiana Right to Life.

Asked how an originalist would decide abortion rights &amp; gay rights cases, @SenToddYoung said that depends on the facts of a case. 		"I want a judge that applies the law to the facts of a given case, as opposed to coming up with sweeping statements about particular policy issues."
Young said his initial sense is that Kavanaugh is an "originalist... someone what wants to apply the constitution as written, as opposed to reading into it things that aren’t there." 		"I campaigned on a platform of getting more originalists on our federal court system," he said.
.@SenToddYoung tells reporters the only scenario in which he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh is if "he is a person who makes decisions based on political biases or personal preferences as opposed to objectively applying the laws as written to particular cases."
More Young: "The prosecutor for whatever reason has not yet opened up an investigation. My expectation would be that that is either going to occur in the very near term – it certainly seems appropriate that it would occur. If it doesn’t, perhaps he could explain why."
Asked whether @AGCurtisHill should resign, @SenToddYoung says the Marion County prosecutor should investigate. "These are horrible acts and they undermine public trust. We need to be held to a higher standard as elected officials."

Pence still has a negative net approval rating among women. But female registered voters like him more than Trump.  Sixty percent of women surveyed in June had a negative view of Trump, a nearly 20 percentage point increase since February.
Among partisans, both Trump and Pence saw a decline in their net support from Republicans since February while improving their standing among Democrats and independents.
Pence now has a net positive rating among registered voters, unlike President Donald Trump and both the Republican and Democratic parties.

A big reason for the 2018 hikes was uncertainty over whether the federal government would keep compensating insurers for discounts the Affordable Care Act requires they give to lower-income customers.
CareSource's requested 10% increase for 2019 compares with a 20% increase from 2017-2018.		MHS/Ambetter's requested half a percentage point decline in average premiums compares with a 36% premium increase last year.
In other states where proposed rates have been filed, requested 2019 premiums for the most popular plans are up 15% on average.
I'm not able to pull up the supporting documents from the Indiana Department of Insurance website to read their justifications behind the proposed rate changes.

One thing about Bob Grand, he usually returns reporters' phone calls. Notably, former Pence COS Bill Smith &amp; Pence's commerce secretary Victor Smith, who have also been lobbying the VP office, did not talk to the Washington Post.
WashPost article says North American Midway Entertainment hired Grand last year after it didn't get enough visas to operate its rides. After later receiving a batch of hundreds of emergency visas the company owner made the max donations to Great America &amp; Greg Pence’s campaign.
"At times, it is hard to decipher when Grand is operating as a friend, a donor or a lobbyist."
"Few examples better illustrate the dynamic than Pence’s bond with Bob Grand, a veteran Republican lobbyist whose firm billed corporate clients $3.3 million over the first 15 months of the Trump administration for lobbying that involved the vice president’s office."
“His staff is very accessible,” said the lobbyist, who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing future access to the Trump administration. “If you can’t get high up in the West Wing, they are your best bet.

Trump says IN can send a "really incredible swamp person like Donnelly back to the Senate, or can send a swamp drainer like Braun.		"Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!" the crowd cheers.
Trump says "Sleepin' Joe" says one thing at home and then vote for the radical, liberal agenda in Washington.		"You think you have their vote. But they always raise their hand for the radical left of Nancy Pelosi."
So Braun thinks the nickname for Donnelly is "Sleepy Joe" not "Sleepin' Joe." https://t.co/b09Saaero0

Per pool report, some rally attendees had traveled from at least five states to see Trump in Elkhart: Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Pence says the Americans held in North Korea were released because of the "strong, clear, resolute leadership" of @VP.

While the RNC refers to the tax plan as "Trump's signature piece of legislation," Donnelly has a different name for it. Donnelly, who has been careful to not be too critical of the man who carried Indiana by 19 percentage points last year, calls it the "McConnell" tax plan. https://t.co/pc7t04efQg

IN has one of the longest-serving House members -- Visclosky, who was first elected in 1985. The next most senior House member is also a Dem -- Carson-- elected in 2008.		But the most senior House Republican -- Bucshon -- was first elected in 2011. https://t.co/heaRqFTQFZ
DCCC also says Donnelly, who will be on the top of the ticket this fall, has a "unique appeal in his home district, particularly with the same type of working class voters that Hall will be working to persuade." https://t.co/avCZt7ZW10

@ChairmanHupfer called IN"s Senate race the Number 1 targeted race in the nation, per @starwatchtim. "We've got the ground game. We've got the message," Hufper said. "And tonight we've got the candidate."
.@braun4indiana received a congratulatory call from @vp and a text from @GovHolcomb from Tel Aviv, per @starwatchtim.
Braun told reporters that his primary race came down to whether people were happy with business as usual. If that's the case in the fall, he has to hope voters will blame the (Dem) incumbent -- rather than the party that controls both the House, the Senate and the White House.
Assuming Jim Baird and Greg Pence win their general election races in their heavily GOP districts, IN's congressional delegation could have 2 more veterans -- joining @RepLarryBucshon, @RepJimBanks and @SenToddYoung.
NRCC spox Maddie Anderson on state Rep. Jim Baird's upset win in the 4th District: "He will serve the people of Indiana well as a tireless advocate for our veterans and true conservative principles."
IN Dem Chair Zody on tonight's primary results: "We’re building the bench and expanding the battleground."
RNC Spokesperson Michael Joyce: "Mike Braun is already well positioned to defeat Do-Nothing Democrat Joe Donnelly in November due to the infrastructure built out between the Republican National Committee and the Indiana Republican Party. "

Not surprisingly, this is a harsher statement than anything Donnelly himself said to reporters tonight. https://t.co/jxMbWGRtPL
IN Dem Chair  Zody on Braun's win: "Hoosiers will come to understand why Rep. Braun funded his own primary campaign with the profits he made from importing auto parts from China at the expense of Hoosier workers."
DSCC spokesman David Bergstein on Braun's win: "With no more childish primary antics to hide behind, Rep. Braun will be forced to run on his record of self-dealing and using the power of the Statehouse to enrich himself."
Can Hoosier political historian types give me some perspective on how unusual it is for a guy who served in the state House for 3 years (after voting in Dem primaries) to beat 2 members of Congress (one a former Sec of State and the other a former state party exec director)?
Asked if Braun's win is a sign that voters want an outsider, Donnelly says:	 "As far as I know, he served in the state legislature."
Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser says her group "will be on the ground every day until the election, reaching out to pro-life voters who don’t always get to the polls" in hopes of defeating Donnelly.
Holcomb seems to be echoing voters' interest in an outsider candidate....		p.s. Holcomb was running for the Senate in 2016 when Pence made him Lt. Gov. https://t.co/0g14TBstzR
Gov. Holcomb on Braun's win: "I’ve long said that we need to see less of Washington in Indiana, and more of Indiana in Washington. Mike Braun will take a message of purpose with him to Washington as a U.S. Senator, and be a strong partner for me and for all Hoosiers.”
NRSC Executive Director Chris Hansen on Braun's win: “Mike’s success in creating jobs for Hoosiers as a business owner is a stark contrast to Joe Donnelly’s history of shipping jobs to Mexico, and his record will ensure his success in the general election.”
Donnelly apologizes to reporters for getting "too technical" when, in answer to a question about trade, said of concerned farmers: "We're out planting in the fields right now." https://t.co/6xXoL3KaKe
More Donnelly: "What people are hungry for and want is just a focus on their lives, their issues, the things that are important to them, the future of America." https://t.co/cq13ikpdsM
