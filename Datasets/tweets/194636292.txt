@us3katz @McWean @EWErickson @jpodhoretz Yes I was responding to Erick, who seems to be actually arguing that genocide was a stated objective of the Nazi Party
@SAJ0822 @us3katz @EWErickson @jpodhoretz The original comment was ‚Äúthere were many steps‚Äù before genocide. Erick wrote ‚Äúexcept Nazism was Nazisim from day one‚Äù, arguing that mass murder of Jewish civilians was always a clear and inevitable aim. That‚Äôs wrong. You asked me why. I gave you an answer.

@LahavHarkov Indeed, the Secretary of State just said they‚Äôll happen in August if North Korea doesn‚Äôt act in good faith. I think a rush for Nazi Germany comparisons, a notorious agreement with a tyrant who was actively conquering territory, is a bit much.
@LahavHarkov The Munich Agreement followed the Anschluss and the takeover of Czechoslovakia. Nazi Germany was expanding and actively conquering Europe. Also, nuclear weapons didn‚Äôt exist. Also, the military drills can be un-suspended at any time.

@p_inc_p Why do you do that? It's weird.
@p_inc_p Let the players speak for themselves. Which they are doing.
@NTarnopolsky @LahavHarkov I don‚Äôt have to understand Argentina‚Äôs football culture to know that saying that players didn‚Äôt pay attention to the Gaza developments (knowing they‚Äôre headed to Israel) and that no one cared or identified with the movement, is a prejudicial conclusion. Show me a quote.
@NTarnopolsky @LahavHarkov Riots; and wouldn‚Äôt have talked about traveling to Jerusalem less than a month later with their coaches; is nonsensical. I don‚Äôt know Argentinian footballers, nor speak Spanish. But I‚Äôve interviewed pro athletes, and this approach infantilizes them. That‚Äôs my point
@NTarnopolsky @LahavHarkov We‚Äôre getting into the weeds here; but yes‚Äî athletes are aware of major international news, have opinions of them; discuss them. It‚Äôs as true for NBA and NFL stars as international soccer players. The idea that players weren‚Äôt aware, of let‚Äôs say, the May 14th
@LahavHarkov @NTarnopolsky The Associated Press at least confirms cancellation; and Iawmakers already saying its fait accompli. Messi isn‚Äôt the team. None of the other 10 starters had a strong opinion about Israel‚Äôs use of force? Expressed it to management? It didn‚Äôt factor in any way? Please
@NTarnopolsky @LahavHarkov But the idea that the players weren‚Äôt aware of the Gaza situation, the deaths and weeks long rioting, the debate over use-of-force; and that this issue ‚Äúno way‚Äù it factored into their unease about the game-it beggars belief. Will there be an quote today from a starting player?
@LahavHarkov @NTarnopolsky It‚Äôs easy to understand concerns about death threats; family safety; travel time and prep; mass international protests; but of course the Israel-Palestinian Gaza violence was a big issue for the players, coaches, management, government.
@LahavHarkov @NTarnopolsky That‚Äôs a tough position to believe, reasonably. Even Argentina‚Äôs national football association VP said canceling was the right call: ‚ÄúThe stuff that happens in those places, where they kill so many people, as a human being you can‚Äôt accept that‚Äù.
