To meet Muluneh and see her work, visit the Fountain Gallery in Lafayette tonight at 5:30 PM for a reception. https://t.co/LbeVwzJCKU #COM407 #MemoryofHope
“As we age, hope at times becomes illusion when in our youth it was a distant mirage in the desert of optimism...Now we stand at the shores of our future seeing in the distance the memory of hope.” -The Memory of Hope, Aida Muluneh #COM407 #MemoryofHope https://t.co/DNgBTe3xLW
Muluneh says she uses mostly primary colors in her work because they “speak to her the most.” Her process usually involves painting the models’ bodies for her work and then taking the picture. #COM407
“My main goal is to tell stories.” -Aida Muluneh #COM407 #photography https://t.co/tY7lQGpBx4
Octavia Butler’s book Patternmaster, sparked Muluneh’s interest in #afrofuturism, as well as music and art surrounding Afrofuturism. #COM407
Muluneh discusses how her experiences as an African immigrant shaped her work as a photographer, especially when she returned to Ethiopia to photograph the place where she was born. #com407 #photography https://t.co/Bdw1sLrdDR
“The first time I saw my photography developed in the dark room was really a magical moment.” -Aida Muluneh #COM407 #Photography
“A visual journey: photography and Afrofuturism” will be starting soon! #COM407 https://t.co/2ojLK11Qkm
Muluneh is originally from Ethiopia and has lived in Yemen, England and Canada. She also attended Howard University. Her photography uses bold and striking images, asking “provocative questions about the life that we live as people, as nations and as beings.”  #COM407
Today, I will be live tweeting the talk with photographer Aida Muluneh at 3 PM in Matthews Hall for #COM407. Muluneh will discuss her artwork and her exhibit, The Memory of Hope, which is now open at the Lafayette Fountain Gallery. https://t.co/YJLqt4zlvX https://t.co/rQZ3exYo8X
