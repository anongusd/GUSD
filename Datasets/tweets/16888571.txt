RT @sjlsafety: @NATCA @Hamghaffari Hard working providers of the safest ATC on the planet.
@bschultzy No. There are thousands more applicants than open positions to fill. Funding has affected the hiring process. Our fear is another shutdown.
U.S. air traffic controllers are working seven percent more operations in just the past 4 years, despite staffing reaching a 28-year low.
@Ctribby66 Yes, smaller. But you raised the "other countries" issue. Ultimately our system is so large &amp; complex that it needs its own unique solution.
@Ctribby66 Canada has succeeded. Controllers there just signed new contract. We won't support anything that does not protect members' rights/benefits.
@Ctribby66 What we know is the current unstable funding system is broken, unsustainable, and unacceptable.
Finding a stable funding stream would have many benefits for the ATC system. But easing the majority of flight delays is not one of them.
@DartTalk @BostonGlobe @GlobeOpinion What exactly are you alleging and where is your proof?
@PaulRinaldi We are not able to modernize New York airspace and facilities due to funding. Efforts started and stopped four times. #RTCA2017
