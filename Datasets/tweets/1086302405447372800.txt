#askaspaceman if you were to drop an object from a considerable height on a neutron star what would the combined effect of time dilation and that massive gravity yanking on the object have on your perception of the time it takes that object to fall?
@TheHalliCJShow @GOP Prepare for the dollar bill to be worth 1 1/2 pennies.
RT @JackieVhmedic: @GOP #ImpeachTrumpPenceNow https://t.co/oeyq8xwPm7
@GOP @realDonaldTrump So it's only okay to hang out with celebrities at Maralago? Republicans have put two TV stars in the office of president now.
@senatemajldr How can you and the president complain about holdups in nominees when you said that you would never allow Obama to appoint a supreme court justice? Stop this partisan madness. You, leader McConnell, could do it if you wanted to.
@senatemajldr I don't see the big reason not to. Choose your battles sir.
@WhiteHouse That quote doesn't sound anything like what he would say. He's rude and condescending, a braggart and a con man.
@JPV55 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump The whole scene was so extravagant: a big orgy and "No one touches Donald's penis," it's just too over the top.
@JPV55 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump I don't like Trump any more than you do but this is not very believable, at times comical.
@realDonaldTrump All of these people willing to break NDAs (you known you could stop them from making any profit, and they know it) should tell you something.
@RepDonBeyer @HouseDemocrats Hold on. Democrats have shut the gov't down and Trump only shut it down once, so the plural is completely inaccurate. And while I respect Federal workers as much as any reasonable American I know that we shouldn't spend more money while we're in debt. Be smart.
#GOP Donald Trump is vulgar and racist, quick to tweet vile things about his enemies and give them lude nicknames. That is not the Republican party. Fix this. Get him in line or get him out.
@KamalaHarris I like you. I want to see more of a centrist position from my candidate. No extreme take all give none platforms. Someone who can get things done. I like you. Please be that for us.
@GOP Please do not nominate Donald Trump as the 2020 Republican Presidential candidate. Please.
@senatemajldr @POTUS Have you learned anything yet, Senate majority leader? You cannot control your president.
@KenCalvert Both parties must come to grips with that reality.
@RepLeeZeldin @SpeakerPelosi Why should she? The senate won't vote on anything she sends through.
@GOPLeader This is inflammatory and false.
RT @WSJ: Five people were killed in a shooting at a bank in Sebring, Fla. https://t.co/F3Rm4fxETj
@CNN These are the scary things you see in European countries.
@RepNewhouse @POTUS What's with saying obstruction? Ken Calvert said the same thing...new GOP talking point?
@KenCalvert Why say things so inflammatory? You just bad mouthed voters and brought up obstruction, a felony that a sitting conservative president has been accused of! Act like a congressman and speak like an honorable man.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Anyone with Twitter gets more Trump, GOP and Democrat propoganda than they want.
@senatemajldr Enough non political and bipartisan fact checking has come out that everyone knows about how screwed up the asylum and dreamer clauses are. It's not fair and it's not in good faith and it would be equivalent to negotiating with a terrorist, a policy made famous by a conservative.
@FBIAgentsAssoc @SenJeffMerkley Fix this.
RT @CNN: A construction worker used a mechanical digger to wreck the lobby of a new hotel in Liverpool, UK, in an apparent dispute over unp…
@CNN That's hardcore.
@senatemajldr @GOP @POTUS Then get it to him and reopen the gov't.
@nytimes I have lost all hope in US gov't. 5-4 split along party lines in the Supreme Court, an institution supposedly immune from political polarization. I'm tired of republicans and democrats. Who represents moderates? No one.
RT @KYprosecutor: If we’re gonna pay Federal workers “back pay” anyhow, why not just pay them now but let them stay home till Washington so…
@CNN You allow this madman to confuse the situation by bringing him on your network and giving him a platform!
RT @TheDemocrats: Working Americans have been in limbo for the past 30 days because of the #TrumpShutdown. They've had to apply for unemplo…
@TheDemocrats I want to see an honorable American become president. Remember that most of us are not extremists on any issue, and moderates get swing votes. Trump has made a lot of swing votes possible, don't lose them by losing yourself in the left.
Saints have this one, over the threshold at the top of the second half. #NFCChampionship
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse So not only are you holding the federal workers hostage, but the dreamers are just bargaining chips for you? You are cold Mr. President.
@CNN My moose is bigger than yours.
@CNN Of all the horrible stories I've heard about gov't worker hardships this is the worst.
@Patience9662 Don't promote this.
@ralphgriffinjr @DesignationSix Donald? Is that you?
@nytimes What did they expect to find?
@NatGeo Does this mean that my wife has to drop her panties when I lift up my shirt and bang out "We Will Rock You" on my belly?
@Transwork1 @CNN Yes. Although I condemn the means by which he did it, he learned a lot, which is the reason that a lot of Nazi doctors and scientists recieved pardons.
@CNN These are the people that die for you.
@BBCWorld She has to. Trump never should have revealed war zone trips for members of congress. Political polarization is strangling us.
@BBCWorld It's a Catholic school. You can support LGBT rights while living in accordance with your personal values.
@CNN Smells like politics. They met to discuss gene sequencing, not promote a race agenda. Experts aren't always savory but we need their knowledge anyway.
@realDonaldTrump I want to see that request in writing.
