@SenFeinstein Please take a good look in the mirror today.  The way you treated those children was very Trump-like.  It's all about me; I won an election.  I can do anything I want.  You can't vote.
There was something teenage like in her comments in that interview.  She said that she knew she would have to serve jail time like, but in the way she said it, it sounded more like she was thinking she would be sent to her room.  I'm not sure she quite gets it yet. https://t.co/5VmQihmCOj
@SRuhle I think you forgot the added complication that her father was a diplomat (perhaps) at the time of her birth.  There is some complication apparently about whether she is a citizen.
@mitchellreports Kevin McCarthy said nearly exactly the same thing when he talked about the Democrats &amp; their "Jewish Bankers".  But I don't remember you belaboring that the way you have Rep. Omar's comment on Twitter.  She's young.  Do you remember being that young?
@morningmika What's important is that Trump can't attract or keep decent staff either.  The next President, male/female, will have ENORMOUS damage to undo. They'll need to be able to attract &amp; keep the best &amp; brightest staff.  For the sake of the country, this becomes an issue. https://t.co/giLpY2E7eq

@JohnCornyn, @TedCruz, Last week we were leaving Syria.  Yesterday we were staying in Syria until things were more stable.  Today, the Army is moving equipment out of Syria.  A lack of mental stability?  Where are the Republicans?
@JohnCornyn, @TedCruz, When are the Republicans going to do something about a President who seems to just be mentally off the rails? The whole government is broken down, now he's going to take disaster money from Texas? And you two will allow this to happen?
