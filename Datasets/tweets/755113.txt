@shannoncoulter @BernieSanders Then I wasn‚Äôt speaking of you. But if you saw his speech yesterday, and just found it to be a bunch of hot air and bloviating, it wasn‚Äôt a function of the speech, but how you see him. All of us, myself included, see people through our own filter
12. I‚Äôll end with this. 		@BernieSanders cares DEEPLY about race, racism, discrimination, and the systems that are maintained by white supremacy &amp; bigotry. 		I mean he cares deep into the marrow of his bones, his soul. It‚Äôs who he is. 		If you insist otherwise, that‚Äôs on you.
11. Yesterday Bernie spoke of race, racism, &amp; at least 11 connected issues tied to both.		I know because I helped review and edit the speech. For those in attendance, and those who don‚Äôt have open animosity toward Bernie, it was great. 		People who loathe him, loathed the speech.
10. When @BernieSanders gave this line, @_waleedshahid is right, it pained him. 		I saw his family crying. 		For those who hate Bernie, it was nothing. But for those of us who love &amp; know him, it was a breakthrough. A revelation. 		https://t.co/ie67Mjfs2X
9. As Bernie and his brother Larry grew up, all around them, all over their neighborhood, were families with numbers on their arms. Many escaped alone. But it was endured by most, observed by most, in utter silence. Even at home.		And Bernie carried this silence through his life.
8. @BernieSanders was born the year the Holocaust began. 		The next year, while Bernie was a baby in Brooklyn, Hitler‚Äôs barbarism ravaged Bernie‚Äôs entire family -killing aunts, uncles, cousins, children, elders, and more. 		But back in Brooklyn, that trauma was endured silently.
7. And as I started to ask why - why did @BernieSanders keep so much of his origin story to himself, it was there that I learned it had EVERYTHING to do with the Holocaust and with the early death of his mother and father. 		Bernie‚Äôs dad escaped the Holocaust. His family didn‚Äôt.
6. But @BernieSanders revered leaders of the Civil Rights Movement of the South so much, that he never wanted anyone to think he was using his early activism for his personal/political gain. 		I have dozens of more stories. 		But he kept them all to himself. Even from family.
5. Bernie was the head of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee at the University of Chicago. 		He led the first ever sit in there. It was protesting horrible segregated housing for Black students on campus. https://t.co/3eNgi4r4sB
4. Bernie stood in front of bulldozers and chained himself to two Black women to protest the horrible conditions of Black school children. 		He was arrested here - just days before he would attend the March in Washington. 		He LOVED Dr. King. Idolized his world view. https://t.co/21U5D2aRGm
3. For his entire life, @BernieSanders has flat out refused to explain the powerful stories behind these images. 		It‚Äôs so deep. His mother and father had each just passed away. Both were young. All alone in the world, Bernie threw his entire life into the Civil Rights Movement. https://t.co/vpcmDibxfJ
2. It was a speech that @BernieSanders has resisted his entire life. He has kept so much of the pain of his past to himself. The speech was beautiful and honest and transparent. And hard for him. He spoke directly of the horrible impact the Holocaust had on his family.
1. When you don‚Äôt like someone, or even worse, if you hate them, you see everything that person does, even the genuinely good stuff, through the filter of your hate.

I loathe anti-Semistism. I literally track and bring Neo-Nazis to justice as my personal hobby. 		Simultaneously, I am a public critic of the ultra conservative Trump loving Israeli government and many of their most problematic policies. 		Both of these can/must co-exist.

Dear @NYPDONeill,		You are going to have to find a way to ensure that people cannot create anonymous false reports in which cops are dispatched to someone's home like this. 		It's the second time in 6 months the system has been weaponized against my family.
The cops then say someone gave them my home address for the last known location of a missing 15 year old girl from Queens. 		They literally wanted to search our home. 		Again, the NYPD has been weaponized against my family. 		They refused to say who gave them this stupid ass tip.
I get downstairs to see what in the world the problem is. It's two uniformed NYPD officers. One Black. One White. 		What they said next damn near gave me a heart attack. 		They said they were there for a "missing child report." 		I have 5 kids. I thought they meant MY KIDS.
In our apartment, when we have a guest, a house phone rings, and we can see them. 		Phone rang. I picked it up. 		Was the NYPD - two officers - telling me to come to see them immediately. 		My heart sank. I thought something bad had happened to my wife or one one of my babies.
