@realDonaldTrump We already pay for it with taxes,Medicare taken out of or paychecks ,insurance ,copays. 	Yet healthcare service providers are not reimbursed for extra paper work justifying referrals to drs,therapy,testing,medications as the reimbursement rates are not worth the effort .
@realDonaldTrump Treating healthcare as a "cost loss "is why our healthcare systems, policy ,infrastructure cost more for less access to proper treatment. Investing in more businesses and employment opportunities while creating commerce paying ourselves back .
@realDonaldTrump We the people are going to use $$ from sales of oil, goods ,n services to pay for healthcare for all Americans . Change health insurance model to healthcare administration service,reimbursement  providers.  Insurance does not work.
