National assembly is not bourdilon rules by tyrant,if lagos is under siege,nigeria can't be....dino will never appologise for doing no wrong
Dino has done no wrong because he didn't insult her nor slap her but remi called him dog and thug,charity begins at home,she is no goddess
@trafficbutter @heraldng that's absurd,remi lacks respect for calling fellow colleague dog,thug.
