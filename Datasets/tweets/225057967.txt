@MelissaKahn7 I had a bad morning and I am deeply sorry for even responding.  Please allow me to rescind my stupid comment.
@MelissaKahn7 You said you should forgive.  I was asking to what extent should you forgive.
@MelissaKahn7 Would you forgive if a guy that killed your best friend after you saved his life? Would you forgive the same guy for hiring Mark Geragos to convince people you killed your best friend and drag you through court for 7 years?  Would you still forgive if this destroyed your health?
Like cocaine, sugar will kill you eventually. if you are on the Keto/Paleo diet, why would you take TUMS? If you are a top performing athlete why would you take Rolaids?Pregnant women are making the wise switch, maybe you should also? We have been using xylitol 10 years. #Axia4 https://t.co/lXAlrFXYvn
