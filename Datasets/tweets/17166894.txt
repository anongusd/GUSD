The esteemed Lab√®que sisters join the CSO to perform Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos on May 3-5! Learn more here --&gt;https://t.co/4Q9YeCsWNp https://t.co/erHuK9rxMt
The beginning of the four-movement concerto is based on a melody that Bruch heard at a Good Friday procession on the Isle of Capri. It‚Äôs followed by a bright and rhythmic second movement, a richly lyrical third movement, and a finale that returns to the Good Friday music. https://t.co/BnRRuneekt
In 1970, a box of Ottilie Sutro's effects was sold to pianist Nathan Twining for $11 at an auction. It contained Bruch‚Äôs autographed score. He and Martin Berkofsky then reconstructed Bruch's original version and recorded it for the first time 1973, with the @londonsymphony . https://t.co/creZquAYeG
After rehearsing the piano concerto in Berlin with the Sutro sisters, Bruch gave permission to have it performed only in the United States. It was performed just a few times before the score disappeared. https://t.co/I6QTDJelYX
