It's a good thing the truckers didn't strike before Christmas...
Yesterday, we told @MarcoRubio and the U.S. Senate that truckers feel neglected &amp; not listened to and while I tried to avoid it, you may strike.

Our Lobbyist reports Michael's Law is not going into the criminal justice reform bill. The Senate changed the entire text of the bill and left Michael's Law out. This is your government at work.

@NRA What happened to National Reciprocity? We had a Republican President and Congress for TWO YEARS. The House is now going Democrat in 19 days and there is no movement in the Senate. Is this why you are bankrupt?

@FMCSA is like your Big Brother who sometimes unfairly pushes you around. Congress and the President are Mom and Dad, whom you can appeal to in pursuit of justice. Exercise your Democratic right to appeal.
SBTC finds it amusing how some trucking media reporters are writing stories about FMCSA's denial today of 10 ELD Exemption Applications without mentioning how the SBTC's ELD Exemption application remains under consideration. You should wonder why they would leave fact that out.
@philkillerlain You can tell @FMCSA at the moment, we feel special.

Time for a public apology to truckers, @CityOfMidland... before this gets real. Ball's in your court. We're waiting...
CBS 7 just told us that the official position of the Mayor of @CityOfMidland is that trucking companies should but their own parking lots and the city has no obligation to provide parking. So all 350,000 motor carriers need to pave paradise &amp; each put up a parking lot in Midland.
CBS 7 would like to interview a trucker in Midland Texas TODAY on camera regarding the truck parking problem. Who wants to do it? Message us and we will put you in touch with the reporter.

@SecElaineChao Why is @FMCSA allowing ELD Manufacturers to hold themselves out as being "FMCSA-certified" (i.e. https://t.co/NycyudArnv). FMCSA doesn't certify ELD products. ELD manufacturers register and "self-certify" whatever that is. @FTC allows this?https://t.co/bvQo5Ze5KK
@FMCSA @Research_USDOT @PHMSA_DOT How do you reconcile this? https://t.co/ti3DnWc5df

@NatSecCNN @CIA @WHNSC @SecNielsen @NSAGov @DHSgov @ODNIgov @DHSNUSA @realDonaldTrump @Influenstrategy This is a matter of #nationalsecurity. Given terrorists' use of trucks to plow people down, it is only a matter of time before terrorists hack into #HAZMAT trucks' computers.

The SBTC is still waiting for a response from @RandallReilly on this June 7th @OverdriveUpdate matter https://t.co/jxMr2viebl So the crickets don't drive you mad, here's some hold music: https://t.co/E1A5AZdCep
Why would @OverdriveUpdate Tweet an article from 7/4 today which states: "The agency is accepting public comments on the SBTC’s petition until... Thursday (July 5th) night. " UNLESS they are really trying to confuse drivers into thinking it's too late to file comments? #Fakenews https://t.co/Bfrwrj9iNS
How do YOU spell  B-E-T-R-A-Y-A-L , Driver? https://t.co/bSPxMvxVxs
So shall it be written, SBTC members, so shall it be done. https://t.co/9zV92WuE5f
We believe this is why Overdrive did not show Drivers how to file a comment on our ELD Exemption Application until we blasted them for it. FOLLOW THE MONEY, Drivers. We'd start boycotting Randall-Reilly if we were you. They are making money off of you but not helping you one bit. https://t.co/mrRNLg0K6y

Hey, @OOIDA What's more important? That you get credit for an ELD exemption for small carriers, or that small carriers get an ELD exemption? We CHALLENGE you to ENDORSE the SBTC's ELD Exemption Request and ask your members to file a comment in support before July 16th.

Like ELDs because of higher freight rates? What goes up, must come down. Rates are cyclical. Once the capacity situation resolves itself and volume balances capacity out, you will be stuck with both lower rates and ELDs. Now is the time to comment in support of the ELD exemption.

"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."--Spock.  The ELD rule was effected by ATA representing just 10% of the industry. The needs of the other 90% small business carriers and one-man owner-operators outweigh the needs of the mega carriers.

I have been doing advocacy for 30 years. There are two types of people in this business. The politically correct politician who advances his own interests, and the passionate warrior who fights for real justice. Today, we saw the real deal in action standing up for what is right.

CALL TO ACTION. I'm thinking EVERYONE should just email FMCSA's Cathy.Gautreaux@dot.gov and tell her what you think about ELDs. She is set to replace Daphne Jefferson who retired this month as No. 2 in charge while Ray Martinez awaits confirmation

UCR Board sent out an email to its distribution list, attaching email written by a FMCSA's Frederic Wood, in which Wood apparently refers to me-- quite unprofessionally and maliciously in my opinion--as a "turkey" -- in an apparent attempt to harass me in retaliation for lawsuit.

Watch for an article on the SBTC's BILLION DOLLAR lawsuit against Indiana in Transport Topics...
BREAKING NEWS: SBTC takes its First Amendment case against ELDs to Congress; asks House &amp; Senate Small Business Committees to review SBTC's ELD Complaint to the Small Business Administration.
The SBA Office of the National Ombudsman has assigned Case Number 1711220002 to the SBTC's Complaint (https://t.co/rZzwgy52kI) regarding the ELD Rule and advises it intends to forward SBTC's concern regarding the FMCSA’s ELD rule to the USDOT with a request for high-level review.
Today is Small Business Saturday. Support your local small businesses.
Thank you, Driver, for bringing us that THANKSGIVING feast.

SBTC to report to Federal Judge today that UCR Board did not open UCR on Nov 1st and FMCSA is proceeding with unlawful UCR fee rulemaking.
UCR Board is waiting for FMCSA to (unlawfully) adjust fees and has no idea when 2018 UCR will open.
FMCSA states during UCR Board call they are moving forward with UCR fee rulemaking despite SBTC pointing out their rulemaking is illegal.
SBTC asks FMCSA to advise intentions regarding whether it will abandon unlawful rulemaking https://t.co/rdoxg3YANc
