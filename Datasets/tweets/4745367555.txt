@psychodadbod Also, if you're purchasing them in a store, ONLY refer to them by brand name. Most states have weird laws around it and they have to kick you out if you say the 'p' word.
@psychodadbod I'd recommend you trying it solo during a jerk off session.  It will get you used to it and you won't be pressured to perform or bottom.  That's how I learned, put on a porn and beat it like it owed me money.  It can really enhance a j/o experience. It dialates the blood vessels.
@psychodadbod I've seen some guys spray black maxx into a cloth and huff the cloth.  Handling a bottle with lubey hands is a nightmare and if you spill it, your bedroom will be cancelled.
@psychodadbod It usually lasts between 3-5 minutes and is recommended that you don't do it more often than that until you learn how your body will react.  More advanced people can handle it.		Every brand is different and should be treated with caution at first.
@psychodadbod It impacts blood pressure so if you have blood pressure issues or are on any sort of medication that alters your blood pressure, poppers could make you pass out or worse.		If they're fresh, they're more potent.  Take smaller whiffs in the beginning until u learn how it affects u
