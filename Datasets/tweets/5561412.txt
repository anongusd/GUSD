.@MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP believe support for Israel is essential to extending freedom, peace and democracy throughout the Middle East.
.@BarackObama‚Äôs failure to take a coherent and decisive stand on Jerusalem reflects his Administration‚Äôs vacillating policies toward Israel.
Yesterday's floor fight and begrudging platform reversal at the DNC should be seen for what it is ‚Äì a case study in political posturing.
Now is the time for the Obama Administration to follow the requirement in law to recognize Jerusalem as part of Israel on U.S. passports.
Dems correct to reaffirm Jerusalem as capital of Israel, but the Administration's continued mixed signals undermine our commitment to Israel
For thousands of years, Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people. We need a leader that stands with Israel.

.@HughHewitt Saw your tweet and agree, we do not support raising taxes - it simply isn't what this economy needs to grow and create jobs.
Just met with a group of entrepreneurs at the University of Texas, truly fascinating discussions, very innovative ideas.
Moments ago, the House passed two bipartisan jobs bills that allow entrepreneurs to use crowdfunding to get off the ground and create jobs.

The House continues to pass bipartisan jobs bills, many of which even have President Obama's support, yet the Senate refuses to act.
Diana and I are looking forward to sitting down with @VP and Jill Biden for dinner tonight.
Interesting discussion on crowdfunding RT @SteveCase The Way Companies Are Getting Financed Is Completely Changing http://t.co/ShhGboR2
Over the past three weeks, the House has voted on bipartisan jobs bills that have the support of the President.  Yet, Reid refuses to act?
To the people who are asking where the jobs are, they are stuck in the Senate - that's where the jobs are.
This week's schedule includes several legislative items designed to foster job creation, including areas of agreement with the President
The entrepreneurial spirit of this country is the key to getting our economy moving again, creating jobs, and spurring innovation.
The House will keep passing legislation to get this economy moving again - the Senate needs to act!
It is the start-ups and entrepreneurs that will grow this economy and create jobs - not Washington's partisan divides.
Next week, the House will vote to repeal the 3 percent withholding rule to remove uncertainty and burdens on job creation.
Today's signature on the long-awaited free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea will help create thousands of new jobs.
Enjoyed today's discussion on job growth at Virginia's BioTechnology Research Park!
Congrats to @SnagaJob on being named the #1 small business to work for in America!  Startups like this are crucial to our economic growth.
RT @ChadPergram: Cantor to speak Friday at Wharton School about economic development.
We want the President to work with us, find the common ground between our economic plan and his, to get America's economy moving again.
This week was indicative of how we can come together, we passed three big trade bills that have been over five years in the making.
The House took action today to reduce the regulatory burden on job creators, legislation is now on its way to the Senate.
Was honored to welcome South Korean President Lee Myung-bak for his speech before a Joint Session of Congress.
Now that the Democratic Party-controlled Senate rejected his plan, I hope that the Pres will temper his campaign rhetoric and work with us.
Tonight, the Senate rejected the President's jobs bill, proving that neither side of the aisle supports his all-or-nothing approach.
.@SteveCase Entrepreneurship is of vital importance¬†to job growth & the economy. ¬†The House is¬†moving legislation to empower entrepreneurs.
This week, per the Sep 16 memo on areas of agreement, the House is going to act on two areas we agree w/ POTUS on.  Hiring Vets & Free Trade
The House has passed bipartisan proposals to ease regulatory burdens and help job creators - the Senate has failed to act.
There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs invention does not better my family's life. Thank you Steve.
Saddened to hear the news about Steve Jobs - he changed the world and made it a better place.
Ditto! RT @billburton716 Ran into @EricCantor in the green room at msnbc -- even off camera he is on message.
We have bipartisan bills coming out of our committees to the floor that will help entrepreneurs grow and create jobs.
While the President seems to be in full campaign mode, we in the House are going to try and find areas of commonality to work for the people
Actually @uthanda, I have outlined several specific areas of the President's proposals that House Rs want to work with him together on.
It seems as if the President is in full campaign mode; his all or nothing approach won't work.  It doesn't even work with the Senate Dems.
If the President would join us in trying to do some things that actually help people, we could create an environment for job growth.
The President's all or nothing approach is unreasonable; there are many issues where we can work together.
The disaster relief money is in our bill, double the President's request.  There is no reason Reid is holding this up other than politics.
The House has funded FEMA, we actually doubled the President's request.  Harry Reid has the bill, he should stop playing politics & pass it.
The point is this: there is no brinksmanship, Harry Reid is holding a bill up with no reason but for politics.  The House has funded FEMA.
People don't expect Republicans and Democrats to agree on everything, but they do expect us to overcome our differences and work together.
Real pro-growth tax reform, sensible regulatory policy like the TRAIN Act, and other reforms will restore confidence in America's economy.
We have to start making it easier for small businesses to create jobs in this country so that the unemployed can get back to work.
Repairing and improving our nation's infrastructure can play an important role in economic growth; both parties should work together on this
While an all or nothing approach might make sense to some communicators, I hope the President realizes it would be better to work together.
Good people can have honest disagreements without having their morals or commitment to country being called into question.
@BillBell2010 @bogusky I am scheduling a House floor vote on H.R. 2005 for Tues. of next week. I support the bill and am working to pass it.
@armymdc4 I am scheduling a House floor vote on H.R. 2005 for Tuesday of next week. I support the bill and am working towards its passage.
@cabbobby I am scheduling a House floor vote on H.R. 2005 for Tuesday of next week. I support the bill and am working towards its passage.
.@Alyssa_Milano I support HR2005 and expect the House to take action on it very soon.  #autism #insurance
Congratulations to @BobTurner9th and @AmodeiNevada - Welcome to Congress!  Let's work together to get this economy moving again!
Make sure to watch my friend Chairman Paul Ryan on @GretaWire tonight!
We need to work together towards the solutions that will meet the challenges facing our country today.
Let's try and lower the volume of the rancor in Washington, and focus on what we can do together to grow this economy and create jobs.
We want to join with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to find areas where we agree, to make sure the American economy succeeds
We have an opportunity to all work together and find areas of agreement, so we can foster an environment of economic growth and job creation
Ten years later, the tragic events of September 11th remain in the forefront of our hearts and minds.
While we should discuss how to do it, smart infrastructure investments are important for the country and we should work together on them.
Let's try a better way and admit that good people can disagree, but not let those disagreements stand in the way of getting results.
Infrastructure investments is an area where we should work together it is important for our country's roads and bridges to be in good repair

The engine of America's economy is small business and entrepreneurship - we need to foster an environment where they can create good jobs.
The trade agreements are something @JohnBoehner and I support.  @BarackObama should send those up - we'll work together to pass.  #JobsNow
We believe that fixing the existing system will achieve a better flow of funds to construction projects.  So, let's work together and do it.
Good people can disagree; let's find areas of agreement to produce results, so the middle class can get back to work in this country.
I welcome the President to Richmond.  I hope he hears the same message I do back home, it is time for Washington to get out of the way.
Let's take the items where we agree and pass them.  Hopefully, we can work together and foster an environment for creating jobs.  #JobsNow
Reforming unemployment insurance, similar to Georgia Works, is an area of commonality.  We should get to work on it right away.  #JobsNow
Let's work together and quickly pass those areas where there is common agreement, so we can grow this economy and create jobs.   #JobsNow
Good people can disagree.  We should work together to find common ground and quickly pass where we agree to grow this economy.  #JobsNow
President's speech had policies that both sides can work on: unemployment insurance reform, small biz tax relief, streamlining regulations
We should work quickly to pass the areas that we can agree on to help people immediately and grow this economy.   #JobsNow  #4Jobs
There are certainly goals the President outlined that we can work with him on.  We should work quickly to pass the areas where we agree.
Good news - the Senate just passed the America Invents Act, which was passed by the House in June.  It is now on the way to the President.
The economic reality in our nation's communities requires that we transcend our political differences and reach points that we can agree on.
Obviously, achieving bipartisan agreement requires more than one side declaring a proposal as bipartisan. It requires that we work together.
Happy to join the @CSMnational lunch to discuss the issues facing our country and the solutions going forward.
Republicans and Democrats don't agree on everything, but we are not going let differences get in the way of common sense solutions.
We should continue to discuss the different paths to job creation; but, differences shouldn't prevent action where there is common agreement
@Pnthrgrlgail People are sick of the rancor in Washington; the focus must be on results, on where we agree on an agenda for economic growth.
Importantly, there is the area of trade agreements - studies show that we create hundreds of thousands of jobs that way.  So, let's do it.
In the area of unemployment benefits, we should look at successful reform programs that get people back to work, such as Georgia Works.
In the area of infrastructure, by giving the states more flexibility, it would free up existing resources for more projects.
You are right, @withrick - let me outline some specific areas where I think the House and the President can produce results.
We need to work together, focusing on areas of common agreement, to deliver results to the people of this country.
Plain and simple, my point is that good people can disagree.  We need to focus on the areas where there is agreement and grow this economy.
While we disagree on how we should grow America's economy, I do not question the President's motives or his commitment to our country.
.@andersoncooper As I have consistently said, with natural disasters when the President requests aid, he will get it. He hasn't requested it
RT @ReincePriebus: Kudos to @SpeakerBoehner for calling out the White House‚Äôs latest move for what it is: a pure political play.
As I've said continuously, we will find the monies for disaster relief.  In fact, the House has approved funding; the Senate needs to act.

The President spent ten minutes on TV last night, a lot of words, but didn't say what he is for. There is no evidence POTUS has a plan.
RT @JimmieJohnson I'm curious... Big government or small? Im for small.  #stopthespending
The House plan responsibly prevents default - the President opposes this plan to avoid an election year fight on spending and taxes.

The national debt has grown into a malignant cancer on our economy; this is why the House will vote on a balanced budget amendment next week
This debate is not a question of personalities; it is about doing what is right for the country.
The reality is that tax increases can not pass the House, the constant demand for them makes coalescing around a final bill less likely.

Anyone who hopes to rein in the debt should support amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget.
Next week, the House will vote on a balanced budget amendment.
On the way to the White House to continue discussions with the President.
Raising taxes is not the answer for America's economy, we need to focus on fostering economic growth and job creation.
If the President wants the debt ceiling raised, the House will not raise taxes. That is just what it is.
As @JohnBoehner has said, there is no way the House will support a tax increase. #TCOT
Deficit reduction is based on cutting spending and growing the economy, not raising taxes.
On the way to @WhiteHouse - will reinforce that we all support tax reform and simplification, but the House Majority will not raise taxes.
Take a moment to welcome Ron Barber back to work!  Yesterday, he returned as the District Director for @Rep_Giffords http://t.co/EITZ9Lj
House Republicans have offered a series of real reforms to grow America's economy; it is time to get government out of the way of job growth
Regardless of the progress made, the tax issue must be resolved before discussions can continue. The House doesn't support tax increases.
