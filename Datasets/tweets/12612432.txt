You better stay clean as a whistle or Rep. Clay Higgins will arrest you along with the thousands of men he has already arrested
Pretty soon the Republicans on the committee are going to get together and sing "Little Boxes" with a barbershop quartet arrangement.
Apparenlty many of the thousands of men Cong. Higgins has arrested are negotiating over book deals as we speak
Cohen: I had boxes returned to me by the authorities	Congressman: I call on authorities to seize the boxes	Me: Is there room on the next Israeli space shuttle
"I have arrested several thousand men" is a line you don't hear every day
Cohen is suffering, let's be clear, not because he toed the Trump party line but because he ran a criminal scheme involving New York City taxi medallions and cheated on his taxes.

@Nanisimo @SacTownSid @benshapiro so sometimes maybe you should err on the side of someone not noticing something instead of accusing others of bad faith. It would be, you know, civilized to do that.
@Nanisimo @SacTownSid @benshapiro Is your point that the adults polls are way lower than the RV poll? Fine. I didn't actually notice that Fox was doing RV until the list you just tweeted, which I think is odd at this point in the game.
@Nanisimo @SacTownSid @benshapiro A reg/likely screen nearly 2 years before an election is nonsensical.
Until the 1950s news was a low margin business. Proprietors made a small profit. Unique trends made it a cash cow. The trends—mostly having to do with monopolization—ended in the 1980s. But people still think there should be billions to make. And they scale up only to crash. https://t.co/yPWRvvp7FU

If indeed Cuomo's solution to the L train problem was available in 2016, it stands to reason somebody stood to benefit from going with a shutdown or a six-year plan rather than following it. So who benefited? And why?
@RalstonReports Daniel Day Lewis, I guess

Hello, I am a professor in a movie. I say that there are traditions that suggest mummies can be reanimated, and when the hero says, "that's just superstitious mumbo jumbo," I take my pipe out of my mouth and say, "Yes, but most supersititons are based on actual fact."
In preparation for the 2020 debates, Trump should start memorizing "The Song of Hiawatha" now.
Hello, I am a doorman in a movie. I'm just delighted to see the star coming in because I know he will banter with me for 15 seconds and demonstrate how he is just a regular person able to commune with the lower orders.

@dpcassidyC3 @DavidAFrench I saw it. As I said on here, I've seen many, many worse movies. But that doesn't mean this ain't a stinker
@BrianHartPR Here's a message for you: Anyone who hires you should have his head examined.
I believe @DavidAFrench is a wonderful person with many important and deep things to say. But...you really shouldn't take his word on movies, is the thing.
It's simple. The death of a 26 year old from a sudden illness is a tragedy. Period. Nothing else need, or should, be said.
AQUAMAN is a movie whose theme is that we need to build a bridge between land and sea. In other words, we all drown.
@PeterNHess Yes. Yours.
@SohrabAhmari That's totally insane. You think children were present at a Victorian wedding? They weren't even allowed downstairs!
@pegobry OK, Ann Landers. Thanks so much
@pegobry Don’t be ridiculous. No one is obliged to have babies at weddings.
@RudyGiuliani Actually it’s been a year and a half but it’s hard to count when you’re drunk.
@pegobry You are allowed to have a wedding without babies at it. Sorry.
@pegobry No. The point of a wedding is for the people to get married.
I love you but this is nuts. No reason to take offense if people don’t want babies at weddings. https://t.co/WlwurgWQAX

@JazzShaw Let's ask Matt Whittaker's panel of self-ethicists
Mulvaney is going to be acting secretary of defense, isn't he
The one type of person who seemed to draw Trump's respect and even deference was a military man. So as president, he systematically laid the military men low. First McMaster. Then Kelly. Now Mattis. They had a dignity and standing apart from his, and that wasn't permissible.
@ZekeJMiller https://t.co/x8li7Dwspa

Rudy criticizing Cohen for being a serial liar while he's working for Trump.
If they pay off Stormy and McDougal before the election for the purpose of keeping them quiet until the election, then the money was being spent on an election related matter and is therefore a campaign contribution.

@TerryTeachout1 you wrote a whole piece without mentioning Cary Grant!
I'm thinking tonight of Charles Krauthammer, whose decision to sign on as a contributor in 1995 was one of the moments that made it clear that this was a serious thing that was happening. What a column he would have written on the Standard's end.  https://t.co/EHDM3wuCJG
5/ This approach brings writers and editors and readers into a rare meeting of the minds. I've sought to mirror it in the work I do at @Commentary. Something ineffably valuable to the intellectual life of our nation was killed off today.		That is all.
4/ It just published 48 (I think) issues a year in which it sought to tell the truth about what was happening, to develop policy arguments consistent with conservative principles as we saw them, and to be unapologetic about the moral basis of any practical politics.
3/ The Standard didn't review books to do favors. It didn't write back-scratching pieces about politicians to which it wished to suck up. It didn't trim its sails to have an easier ride in a company town or in a party or movement whose loyalty tests became ever more demanding.
2/ The Standard assumed its readers were exceptional and rounded people interested in everything and curious about everything, imbued with love of country and of the West and its traditions, who saw a continuity between the politics of the front and the culture in the back.
Tonight, Standard staffers from every moment in its 23-year existence gathered for a wake/shiva. The bonhomie was irrepressible. We knew we had been a part of something spectacular and important, and had taken the kind of pride in it unknown to the untalented suits who did it in.

3/ I say again--never in the annals of American publishing have I heard of such a thing. Anschutz and his man wouldn't even entertain AN OFFER.
2/this is not normal behavior. This is not business behavior. The business side rep, one Ryan McKibben—who was not content to have run several newspapers into the ground—had either decided on his own or talked the owner Anschutz into, killing the Standard.
1/To help you understand why what happened to the Weekly Standard was evil: Its owner agreed to allow its editor Steve Hayes to try and find a buyer. A VC firm in New York agreed to be the broker. Then the owner's business-side rep ordered Steve to cease all contact with the VC.

Me: 		https://t.co/rNKZuLiyt8
There were buyers. Potential buyers. In September, Clarity Media told those looking for buyers to stand down. Why would a company not wish to entertain a potential sale? Because it wanted to kill the magazine and harvest it.
So there are non-disparagement clauses in the severance packages being given to the staffers at the Weekly Standard.		I'm not a staffer.		There will be much disparagement in this space and elsewhere, and factual disparagement as well.
Clarity Media said everybody had to leave Standard by 5, and didn't provide boxes for people to put their stuff in.
People at the Weekly Standard have been told to clear out their offices by 5 pm today, in case you were wondering what Clarity Media is like.
Stand by for my take on the murder of the Weekly Standard.

Two years after the big-city woman learns what Christmas is all about and marries the hunky widower who does manual upscale labor, she is arrested after using a baseball bat on a man with a big bushy white beard as she shouted, "I had an apartment in the Beresford!"
After the big-city woman who finds out what Christmas is all about marries the hunky widower who does upscale manual labor in the small town, she goes into the bathroom and uses one of the hand towels and he comes in and says "I TOLD YOU THE HAND TOWELS HAD TO LINE UP PERFECTLY"
Why don't these women in the Hallmark movies realize the hunky widower doing upscale manual labor probably killed his first wife and she's next
You know, someone should look into the epidemic of hunky widowers doing upscale manual labor in small towns around Christmastime. For one thing, how are there so many young widowers anyway? Is there a Christmas wasting disease that passes exclusively through young married women?

@cjane87 actually, no. The whole point of using Soros as the reference point for liberals is precisely to put it out of bounds on the grounds that he has been the subject of anti-Semitic attacks outside the U.S.
@cjane87 I'm sorry, but it's only "newsy" because of the use of Soros's name, as you indicate, which you take to be a factitious smear--but what if t's likely some of his money went to the group? is it "newsy" then?
@SonnyBunch few things could be worse than the second Jack Reacher movie. Maybe strychnine.
@cjane87 Why? because all you have to do is say Soros and you're an anti-Semite? I reject this categorically and find the idea bizarre in the extreme. Soros is a funder of left-wing activism, and organizations he funds consort with organizations that fool around with anti-Semitic tropes.

@Rikleen STOP FOR GOD'S SAKE IN THE NAME OF GOD
There's going to be a surprise tomorrow night, and by surprise I don't mean that someone whose race has been closely studied is going to win or lose. I mean something big will happen in a race no one has paid much attention to.
@Rikleen you're being tiresome. I made a snarky joke about the idea that it was relatively easy to model a forecast whose outcome is unknown. Please stop before you tweetstorm.
@AaronBlake @brianstelter that's an important poll! It single-handedly brings the generic average under 8!
@Rikleen then nothing invalidates it. If you can say there's a 10 percent chance I'm wrong and then you're wrong the idea that you are somehow cleansed of fault for having acknowledged you might be wrong is wrong.
@Rikleen the probabilistic approach must still conform with reality; saying, well, we said there was a 10 percent chance this could happen doesn’t validate the approach.
@Rikleen No, really, it doesn’t.  If the forecast does not reflect the final, then it was off.
How will you know this is true before Wednesday morning? https://t.co/ZbReLhquRu

i replied: "I heard you raped a 3 year old. Prove me wrong. you're disgusting." She has chosen to make this public. fine. I still say what she said was disgusting. But obviously what I said was ugly in spirit and manner, and unbecoming, and I apologize.
Virginia Heffernan put out a tweet saying in effect it was no big deal to accuse someone of gang rape if he didn't do it. I called it depraved. She DMed me jokingly about the word depraved. I responded by DM in a manner intended to parody her disgusting contention.
@kevinholtsberry It's my taste buds! It's not me! They have a mind of their own!
important from @NoahCRothman -- the depiction of the Gorsuch nomination and hearings from Democrats and liberals wanting to claim fairness in their approach on Kavanaugh is a load of hooey. https://t.co/b9nupP8OmG

I don't know about you but having a president who's clearly a goniff isn't my ideal.
So far the polling I'm seeing suggests some blowback to the anti-Kavanaugh narrative among voters.
Hats off. This is just an astonishing story and makes it clear Donald Trump and his siblings are a bunch of goniffs. Nervy. But goniffs. https://t.co/YLZK03zS2o

@meganmurp @conncarroll Don’t accuse me of bad faith. How dare you.
That’s not a fact, it’s a marketing slogan. https://t.co/5z6ukBZOiK
@meganmurp @conncarroll Your condescension is duly noted.
@jaybookmanajc The story is you’ll believe any claim. That’s the story.
Wait. “Accused of throwing ice.” This story is the Ed Whelan of the Left.
He threw ice. 		Are you people aware of what you sound like???
So far no one has said they saw him passed out. No one. Prof Chad said he never saw it and he issued a statement saying K had in his view drunk enough to pass out. So this is a...lie?
Nate Silver just said in his podcast that K saying he never passed out while drinking is 99.99 % likely a lie. Really?

We can’t allow anyone in the Supreme Court who was questioned by police and not charged with anything. We’re better than that.

@benshapiro you do when you're losing and you swing your arm across the table and knock over all the chessmen
@matasar listen, a troll doll would make a better Tony than Richard Beymer did
Kavanaugh was untruthful about how he drank enough to pass out, said ludington, who then said he never saw Kavanaugh pass out
So Ludington said Kavanaugh was not telling the truth when he said he didn't drank until he passed out and then said he never saw him pass out
"I have seen Brett drunk to the point when he could easily be passed out" but he never saw him pass out and "he downplayed to a great degree the possibility that he could not know what was going on" -- quoth Chad Ludington in the most ludicrous statement in history
Chad Ludington sounds like a Chad Ludington
@jackshafer @DavidCornDC not any longer.

@glenngarvin I remember vividly when SOB came out that people acknowledged it was not actually the first time she had done nudity even though that is how they had decided to sell it
@timothypmurphy I read it. Thanks. Now let me find you some right-wing propaganda.
@DavidCornDC Oh wow David gee what a find he's a prosecutor huh let me introduce you to 1,000 of them. Cut the disingenuousness. It doesn't suit you. You're a leftist working for a leftist publication looking to destroy the guy. Own it.

I really liked CASTLE ROCK, although it's very heavy-handed and there's a central plot point it never explains (where'd they find the boys).

Confirmed 90-9.
A man was confirmed to the Supreme Court who said, under penalty of perjury, that he had never even had a thought about Roe v. Wade.
@Adam_Langer boof or the term "bufu" which appears in Frank Zappa's Valley Girl as a derogatory term for homosexual?
Sissy Spacek should win a Nobel Prize for her performance in Episode Seven of CASTLE ROCK. One of the greatest feats of acting in memory with a heartbreaking callback to CARRIE 42 years ago.
Episode 7 of CASTLE ROCK is like if SLAUGHTERHOUSE FUVE were good.
@Adam_Langer I'd like some evidence of that.
@CathyYoung63 @emdeardo @roddreher Whatever it was, it's a term I never heard and I'm pretty sure I heard them all.

@Patg62 Trump says it isn't so. I know he's not believable, but the NBC story wasn't confirmed by anyone else.

@TheFienPrint @ArevFTW You seem to have me confused with a Trump supporter, which pretty much assigns you the role of "Twitter Village Idiot."
@terryteachout His preening solipsistic windbaggery--including his nauseating citations of his own "expertise"—really gives the game away.
Man am I glad I muted this pompous ass. https://t.co/Db4XmWCgO4
@mattzollerseitz I'm not "afraid" of anything. And I've been disappointed in your views over the years too.
For all the Yankee bashing on here, I note they won 100 games. So shaddup.

@terryteachout there's better location photography on YouTube. The movie is written in an incredibly stilted way and the post-dubbing is awful. And the plot is ludicrous. Other than that it's great.

@noamscheiber where does it say Flake wanted an investigation into Swetnick aside from your own overheated and hysterical twitter feelings
The fact that serious people are objecting to limiting the investigation in a way that doesn't deal with Swetnick's transparently absurd charges brought forth by a porn-star lawyer addled by his sudden fame is among the many disturbing aspects of the present moment
