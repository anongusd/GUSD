@AlizaMarcus Is Turkey a NATO member &amp; ally of the US or part of the Russian-Iranian-Maduro axis? Is Erdogan regime a Jihadist one? Is AKP a Muslim Brotherhood style party or Jihadist one? What is relationship between AKP and Jihdists of ISIL, Al-Nusrah,  Al-Sham, &amp; Turkmenistan and others?
@AlizaMarcus AKP wants to establish an Ottoman style Islamist Caliphate
@AlMonitor Some pro-ISIL  locals!
@AlizaMarcus Safe zone for the Turkish regime means a wild zoo ruled by predator Jihadist-Gray Wolves and former ISILs! Just like the current Afrin which was converted from a secular safe haven to a Turkish-Jihadist zoo!Turkey is a state built on terrorism.
@AlizaMarcus Peace for Turks means the surrender of Kurds to the Turkish nationalist belief " I am only Turk. I am happy. I am superior"
@nordicmonitor Because Europe soled human rights in Turkey to the Sultan in exchange of stopping poor Syrian migrants from crossing the Turkish border. Ironically, the Turkish MIT collaborates with human-smugglers in order to keep the migrants crisis on for the purpose of blackmailing Europe!

@cananwilliams @ICC @NATO @UN This is a  routine practice by the terrorist Turkish military, security forces, and Turkish paramilitary and Turkish backed Jihadist gangs against Kurds not only in Turkey but also in Afrin, Syria. Turkey is a terrorist state and the Kurds are the main victim of its terrorism.

@ForensicArchi @openDemocracy I do not think that any PKK militants were around. This is similar to the narrative of Turkish regime who already threatened Elci! Imagine such a play 'PKK militants passed by, while the Turkish security forces watching Elci and ready to kill him!  Elci was killed deliberately .
@USCIRF @SalehMaslem @anurima @nadinemaenza If the US troops withdraw without provisions to protect civilians, Kurds, Christians and others will definitely face massacres of revenge by Turkish military and pro-Turkey Jihadist gangs.

@AmbJohnBolton The only aim of Islamist regime of Eerdogan is to ethnically cleanse the Kurdish and Syriac Christian cities and towns on Syrian-Turkish border, and to settle Jihadists there as they did in the Syrian Kurdish Afrin and other areas in the north of Syria.

@MansfieldWrites @ParvanehMedian2 Thank you Mr Mansfield. Now, Kurds, Syriac Christians, and Arabs of N-E Syria will face massacres by Erdogan &amp; his Al-Qaeda affiliated gangs, if Turmp continued to appease him like this. Erdogan and his Al-Qaeda affiliated gangs  are massing much more troops to attack us.
@realDonaldTrump Advantage! We Kurds lost over 12000 brave woman and man in this war because we believed in values that we thought that you believe in, but you seem that you only care about your business with Erdogan who had business with ISIL and Al-Qaeda gangs! Shame
@ColinKahl @ParvanehMedian2 + other Jihadists who act in Libya, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere!
@ColinKahl @ParvanehMedian2 Erdogan is the big brother of Al-Baghdadi and the speritual leader of Al-Qaeda affiliated gangs of Al-Nusrah, Al-Sham, Sultan Murad, Yugur Jihadists, Turkestan Jihadists; all these gangs and others take support from Turkey to kill and destroy in Syria!

@StateDeptPM @StateDept @EURPressOffice @USAandEurope @USNATO Erdogan has an Ottoman mind of conquering for an empire! Therefore,  the soft language of US administration can never appease a dictator with such a mentality. It is similar to the case of the Europeans who paid a heavy price as they failed to satisfy Hitler! Use tough language!
@LennoxGina @RudawEnglish I think the tone and only one sentence by Trump can work  like 'we will not accept another Turkish aggression'. Erdogan &amp; his staff are coward more that many American officials think. Erdogan army is cautious not to enter a war with other country's army even against Assad army!
@LennoxGina @RudawEnglish Still I think the only deterring option is that the US administration to use a different language with Erdogan.
The case of pastor Brunson also proved that the best language to use with Erdogan is the language of pressure! @brett_mcgurk @realDonaldTrump @VP @OIRSpox @StateDeptPM @SecPompeo @USATODAY @CIA @coalition @Jerusalem_Post @RepTomGarrett @CJTFOIR @CENTCOM @BBCWorld @UKagainstDaesh
Erdogan has an Ottoman mind of conquering for an empire! Therefore,  the positive language of US administration can never appease a dictator with such a mentality. It is similar to the case of the Europeans who paid a heavy price as they failed to satisfy Hitler! 1 @brett_mcgurk
@LennoxGina @RudawEnglish The US administration can never appease a dictator with such a mentality, exactly as Europeans were not able to do so with Hitler and they paid heavy price because they did not used the proper language that matched Hitler mind. The case of Pastor also Brunson proved this!
@LennoxGina @RudawEnglish The best and most reliable option is that the US administration change its language when it deals with this file with Erdogan. Erdogan has an Ottoman mentality of conquering and establishing an ISIL like empire. The only language he understands is the language of pressure.
@LennoxGina @RudawEnglish The other issue is that why we assume that would dis-consider any aggression if the Peshmerga were stationed on the border? Turkey has repeatedly invaded Iraqi Kurdistan where Peshmerga are official force! As an alternative Peshemrga is good to act in Rojava under the US command

@Jerusalem_Post Edrogan has an Ottoman dream of conquering the land of others and spreading fundamental Islam. The only language that such a dictator can understand is the pressure language. The case of Pastor Brunson proved this.  2
@Jerusalem_Post I do not think so as long as they are under separate command. This will complicate it even more as it was the case of Iraqi Kurdistan during the 90s. What is needed is to change the language of the US administration when they speak with the Islamist dictator Edrogan. 1

Nowadays if you want to study Syria from the perspectives and researches of the US and UK research centres, first you have to know who fund the centre or individuals involved. The Qatari money has shaped several arguments about certain conflicts and regions.
@cspan @AtlanticCouncil So the US there and the Kurds and their partners are fighting hard to achieve a Turkish-Qatari Islamist project similar to that of Al-Nusrah in Idlib because Mr  Heydmann sees this correct!
@cspan @AtlanticCouncil Mr  Heydmann wants the US to impose a Muslim Brotherhood or Jihadist Al-Nusrah-Ahrar Al-Sham like system similarly to the regions of Idlib and Afrin, or to hand the area to Assad, which matches the Turkish wishes!
@AlArabiya اردوغان كذاب ولايخجل من نفسه في تكرار كذبه وخسته وفي معرفة الناس بانه كذاب ونذل!
@cspan @AtlanticCouncil Mr Heydmannswho seem to be pro-Qatar money as he showed antagonism to the SDF and described it as the body that rules although SDF is a military body and the ruling body is Syrian Democratic Council that gathers Arabs, Kurds and Syriac Christians for the first time!
@cspan @AtlanticCouncil Mr  Heydmann claims that pre-2011 during Al-Assad rule, there were autonomous systems in the North East Syria, which is a big lie.

@USEmbassySyria The best language to use with Erdogan is the language of pressure. This proved itself in the case of pastor Brunson! It is wise that the US administration use the case of Kurds in Turkey or any internal Turkish case for such pressure over Erdogan.
@USEmbassySyria He can never succeed in appeasing the Turkish regime because Erdogan &amp; his staff have the Ottoman dream of invading the neighbouring nations either through Jihadist proxies or directly.Islamist Turkish regime sees Kurdish-American friendship as an existential problem for Turks!
@Dr_HawzhinAzeez Many brilliant Kurdish activists who admire the Western values of democracy have been persecuted (or prosecuted) by the Western authorises only to appease the Pro-Jihadism Islamist Turkish regime who devalues the Western values! Shame!

@ibrahim_ghassan نظام اردوغان هو الذي مهد لقتل خاشقجي بعد ان وعدوه بالضمانات والحماية. كان خاشقجي متواصلا مع مستشار اردوغان قبل قراره زيارة القنصلية السعودية. الهدف هو ابتزاز السعودية في الملف السوري وماليا.
