@SusanShipley11 @reddog_2711 @gatewaypundit @Barnes_Law I watched the videos and saw that black group taunting, but those boys had taunted girls walking by along with the rape comment which u must not have seen.

@ganganpg4 Not sure how politically knowledgeable u r, but anything good for the middle class has come because of Dems, not Pubs.  A Republican is generally a Democrat who got free education &amp; flipped to keep others out of the $$ or they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
@ganganpg4 Nope.  Do you happen to know anyone who knows him &amp; his friends &amp; their ways &amp; attitudes?   Just like you don‚Äôt believe Trump socializes/is a mobsters because you don‚Äôt know anyone who knows him, u don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúaccusations‚Äù are truth.
