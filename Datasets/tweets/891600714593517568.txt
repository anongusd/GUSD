@Diamond_Grisha @gmcdeez already made me one.
@TheFrostySky @MeIsPhantom Fine. I will. I wish @MelsPhantom didn't say that, and I also wish Gage didn't share the chat of you with Gage to me as well. So no more discussion. Don't do this again.
@MeIsPhantom @TheFrostySky I understand it is a joke, but other people might take this seriously. You should also be aware of others.
@MeIsPhantom I've experienced too much grief in my life. First, @TheFrostySky threatened to kill himself, and I saved him from death, now you're saying you want to kill yourself?! Threatening violence against others and yourself is also violation of the Twitter Guidelines. Don't do this again

@Miahthefrog1 I love it, and I used the flute instrument as the vocals, and the harp as the piano.
@Miahthefrog1 I did it all by ear. No MIDI files. All in Note Block Studio.

@ImExalite I never cringe.
@ImExalite I'm not good at coming up with great titles. I'm too busy and uncreative at what I should upload. I don't know what to say at times.
@ImExalite I don't like Roblox, Fortnite, CS:GO, or .io games. I shouldn't say if I live by myself or not.
@ImExalite I don't have any friends IRL. I hardly have time to visit my family.
@ImExalite Yeah. The whole thing.
@ImExalite I use OBS to record my videos. I'm getting a HP OMEN Gaming Desktop PC for Christmas. My graphics card is fine. I'm using tutorials to not get any lag from the recorder.
@ImExalite I would watch it if I were someone else. I would really watch it.
@ImExalite I use Windows Movie Maker to do my video editing. I try to make my videos HQ.
