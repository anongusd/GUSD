@DrMike_adenuga Good my brother. Keep doing your best to make us a better nation
@fkeyamo Producing what! We are only starving to reduce the importation budget sir. Have a blessed Sunday
I’m highly inspired and will forever be inclined to see change in Nigeria. Thanks @MBuhari
@MBuhari Ride on sir. Let’s them keep crying. Punishment awaits them for all they’ve have caused all Nigerians
Nigerians wake up. Don’t be dull not to see a good thing. Nigeria is young in its independence and so we have to be watchful of predators. @MBuhari will take us through this path. This is just the beginning. Second tenor awaits. God bless Nigeria
God bless you sir @MBuhari. You will grow from strength to strength. They can’t pull you. I see your vision as a patriotic Nigerian and forever will follow your lead.
@_MyPurpose True. Takes a man of vision to see
