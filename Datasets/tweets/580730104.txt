I will be coming up with a foundation to carry out this task and will need membership of Nigerians who are selfless to achieve the objectives
We need selfless youths amongst us to help de-radicalizing our brothers who have be radicalized by ethnic and religious bigots before becomes too late for us.
Instead of fighting bad governance, we are busy fighting ourselves.
Ignorance amongst both educated non educated youths have cost us a lot. Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Ijaw, Idoma and all the tribes in Nigeria are all victims of bad governance especially the youths
Fighting is never an option in any situation. Diplomacy is far better than fight
We can do better without religious, tribal and political sentiments.
In every contest, a winner must emerge. All we need to do is give whoever wins our maximum support. With our support, he will do better. We should avoid any action capable of destabilizing the government that may come in after the election.

@NGRPresident  and @followlasg  should be held responsible for their neglecting their duties to protect the lives and properties of the Igbos in Lagos state Nigeria
There is an intentional conspiracy by the @NGRPresident and @followlasg to punish the Igbos applying the popular #conspiracy_of_silence_philosophy
The @NGRPresident  and @followlasg must pay every penny we lost to election and perpetrators of this evil act brought to justice.
@MBuhari and @AkinwunmiAmbode owe explanation to why the Igbos are being punished for their choice candidate. We are not going to swallow this without a fight. But we will fight back through legal means
How could people born other people's vote and properties and even order them not to come out or open their shops because of their choice of candidate? What has the @PoliceNG @HQNigerianArmy  been doing in Lagos state? Sleeping? Or any secret agenda?
I sincerely wish to appeal to anyone who do not agree with result of the 2019 election to seek justice through legal means. Let's not take laws into our hands.

Candid advice for all men out there!	1. Don't accept sex offers from ladies who drunk; you may wake up next morning to see rape case(s) hanging on your neck.	2. Don't stay in an enclosed environ with any lady; you may wake up next morning to see rape case(s) hanging on your neck.
@iamJoshuaAlade The Nigerian educational system is already too cumbersome and no need adding extra load.
@iamJoshuaAlade The education institutions should rather focus on producing quality graduates instead off all these garbages called graduates in Nigeria. Are u not worried that we produce engineers who cannot even identify working tools let alone use them?
@Ralph_MUFC @DanielC11631389 @derWinterbach @Cristiano @DerSPIEGEL Let the feminist focus their effort on obtaining justice instead focusing their effort on blackmailing and extorting people. This whole drama shows that they consider rape victimism as a business. Let us fight rape insisting on justice for all victims. Don't sell out!
@Ralph_MUFC @DanielC11631389 @derWinterbach @Cristiano @DerSPIEGEL Please let the victim insist on justice now. It makes no sense reopening the case whenever she is broke. My stand is very simple.
@RealJamesWoods I love to hear this
The choice of @atiku and Obi truly proves that the PDP wants Nigeria out this economic quagmire.	@obyezeks should emphasize patience for these men to save Nigeria. I will truly support a female President after the leadership of his Excellency Atiku Abubakar.	#IamAtikulated!

Justice gives permanent healing to emotional trauma while compensation gives temporary one. Any man, woman, boy or girl who experiences abuse should insist on justice. Monetary compensation encourages abuse. #metoo

@Ralph_MUFC @derWinterbach @Cristiano @DerSPIEGEL I am also worried about such widespread but let us not use it as a tool to blackmail and extort people. The best thing to do right now is to seek justice through a competent court of law and not social media trial and conviction.

@RealSaavedra If he actually abused substances, he is also a culprit as well. Substance abusers do things that they don't even remember after the act. Substance abuse can lead to nothing else but crimes.

Saraki moved out because he wanted to contest for the Nigerian presidency which is no longer attainable in APC since Buhari is recontesting.

@swachhbharat Is your toilet a WET?
For purchasing, enquiry, or retailing,  Call or text or whatsapp us @ 07037219815 or visits us at shops 11/12 Amaeze Plaza (opposition Leja park) Along Aku Road Nsukka. Our product has been tested for over 5 years &amp; through the help of WaterAid Nigeria, now officially certified. https://t.co/j1hDjmbc2z
4. It is the cheapest amongst all; even cheaper thhan the pit latrine. 5. U can convert any other type of latrines into WET or install a fresh one ( if you don't have any other). https://t.co/NOZ0RPap07
Advantage over other types of laterine?: Yes: 1. It is odourless; closes as soon urine and faeces enters. 2. Water economy; one satchet of pure water can flush it 2 times. 3. Infection prove; there is no pit heat as in pit latrine and no water splashing on the anus of the user. https://t.co/gwH6jGh740
The WET group' presents 2 you the Water Easy Toilet (WET).How does the WET work?: It automatically opens immediately the user defecates or urinates; allowing urine/faeces to enter &amp; closes immediately. Is it costly?: It cost just about N4,500 depending on the design u want. https://t.co/wZFM3Ia7QM
