@catholictruther why assume discoveries are one-time events?
@catholictruther of course.   and which church magisterium approved the Old Testament Canon that Jesus quoted so freely from?   how did the Old Testament canon come to be known and accepted?
@catholictruther in an interesting way, the Bible actually creates the church.		faith comes by hearing the word of God.		faith is how we get saved.		thus, since the Word leads to faith which leads to saved people, it can be said that the Bible creates the church.		you have it backwards.
@catholictruther you didn't read the articles then.   the church didn't CREATE the Canon, it DISCOVERED it.  Roman logic astounds me.   your fake conundrum has been answered all over the place.  try this for a nice general overview of why your view self-destructs:  https://t.co/kZxM0qUPdW

@catholictruther there's no scriptural basis for the papacy, youre in a cult that dictates to you what to believe - Sola Ecclesia. The Bible teaches Sola Scriptura, and its advice is sufficient to please God &amp; to do every good work		The Prophets &amp; Apostles laid the foundation, we build on it.

@LinuxGal @x3na you've likened morals/truth to something like choosing a favorite flavor of ice cream ... PERSONAL PREFERENCE (since you're a subjectivist). 		i view truth/morals as an inoculation:  you choose what works, not what's preferred.
@LinuxGal @x3na yes, by saying that morals are subjective, you are absolutely saying that good and evil are not real.  by definition, if the SUBJECT can determine what good and evil are (subjectivism), morals become illusory.		thus, you cannot cry "evil" when someone lies, steals, etc.
@LinuxGal @x3na thank you for openly admitting that abolishing slavery wasn't a GOOD thing (since GOOD doesn't exist in your worldview).		since good doesn't exist in your worldview, neither does evil.  		so i hope you're consistent and have never condemned Christians as evil, immoral, or bad.

It may generally be remarked that the more a government resembles a pure democracy the more they abound with disorder and confusion.    - Zephaniah Swift, Author of America's First Legal Text
In democracy . . . there are commonly tumults and disorders. . . . Therefore a pure democracy is generally a very bad government. It is often the most tyrannical government on earth.    - Noah Webster
A simple democracy . . . is one of the greatest of evils.    - Benjamin Rush, Signer of the Declaration 		Pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state, it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage.    - John Witherspoon
[T]he experience of all former ages had shown that of all human governments, democracy was the most unstable, fluctuating and short-lived.    - John Quincy Adams
We have seen the tumult of democracy terminate . . . as [it has] everywhere terminated, in despotism. . . . Democracy! savage and wild. Thou who wouldst bring down the virtuous and wise to thy level of folly and guilt.   - Gouverneur Morris, Signer and Penman of the Constitution
A democracy is a volcano which conceals the fiery materials of its own destruction. These produce an eruption and carry desolation in their way. The known propensity of a democracy is to licentiousness which the ambitious call, and ignorant believe to be liberty  - Fisher Ames
Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.   - John Adams
Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have, in general, been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.   - James Madison
