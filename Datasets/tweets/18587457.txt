Ain’t sorry. Rape, assault, abuse black women?  I am not for ya.
One down. One Lt Gov to go. “Judge approves arrest warrant for R. Kelly, charged in sex abuse case”  https://t.co/RLNFpXs8vd
It is cowardly of Virginia General Assembly to pretend they cannot move forward with a process for addressing credible allegations against Lt Gov Fairfax simply because there are no criminal charges in Massachusetts. #BlackWomenMatter
Virginia Democrats have been happy to ride into office on the backs of black women voters for decades, but have fallen silent now.  This is not a hard choice. Create a fair, open, process for addressing these claims. Do it now. #BlackWomenMatter
Despite hyperbolic performances by the  Lt Gov &amp; some of his supporters, Fairfax is *not* similar to a lynching victim.  Never in the history of USA has a group of white men formed a lynch mob to protect black women from sexual violence #BlackWomenMatter
Silence and inaction by the Virginia General Assembly sends a clear message- performing symbolic violence against black men by wearing black face is more important that enacting actual violence against black women. #BlackWomenMatter
Enough is enough. The VA General Assembly has a duty to address the multiple, credible allegations of sexual assault leveled against Lt. Gov Fairfax.  Hire independent investigators. Conduct a full investigation. NOW. #BlackWomenMatter

In recent days all of us who have long known, respected, and loved Vanessa Tyson have wept and screamed in collective grief and powerlessness as we read and believed her account. Sexual assault, like lynching, violates more than the victim, it terrorizes whole communities.
Girls in the criminal justice system are disproportionately survivors of sexual violence. They are also disproportionately girls of color. https://t.co/KiseOOrtM0
We Need to Include Black Women’s Experience in the Movement Against Campus Sexual Assault via @thenation https://t.co/tnlyaQuRlf #blackoncampus
Studies show men found guilty of raping black women receive shorter sentences than men found guilty of raping white women.
Approximately 40% of Black women report coercive sexual contact by age eighteen.  https://t.co/lk4iysq5Uf
Now observers are wringing hands over the “racist v rapist” dilemma facing Virgina. Welcome to the intersection where black women live.
There are many reasons survivors don’t immediately report the sexual violence against us. For many black women we have been taught &amp; trained to “keep our brothers” even when they assault and violate us.
From my vantage point it took Most national Dems too long to express their support of Prof Vanessa Tyson. There was a “tidy” ending to Northam racist photo if a black man became VA governor. Now we must contend with whether violence against black women matters in our politics.

Follow @EdTrust and their Exec Director @JohnBKing for careful research about the causes and consequences of educational inequality. #EducationVoices
Ok allow me to share a few sources with far more expertise than me in many of these areas. #EducationVoices
I believe the unique value of research &amp; teaching universities like @WakeForest is not as a training ground for good first jobs, but rather as a site of robust, unfettered, democratic deliberation --including discussion of our own failings. Individually and collectively.
A single university does not and cannot have all the answers to addressing inequity within the Academy or in our communities. But institutional leadership has a responsibility to openly engage these issues even if it doesn't make for neat and tidy press clippings.
So part 2 is about universities as meaningful actors of significant influence in their communities. And private colleges like @WakeForest that benefitted directly from slavery &amp; Jim Crow have particular responsibility in Southern towns.
Inequality is real in our city. African-Americans are 5x more likely to be food insecure and nearly 2.4 times more likely to be born with low birth weights than white residents. As compared to nearly 70% of white 3rd graders, only 27% of black 3rd graders perform at grade level.
In Winston-Salem @WakeForest and its affiliated hospital are the largest employer by far. The pervasive @Aramark 10 month contract effectively creates an effect in working class W-S that is a bit like having this recent government shutdown-- EVERY YEAR.
On #MLK Day I raised one aspect of this complicated question- how the @wakeforest contract with @Aramark creates hundreds of 10-month employees who are essentially laid off each summer &amp; rehired in the fall.
Communities have an interest in holding colleges &amp; universities accountable to their interests. They too need a seat.  Unlike faculty who have a vote, students who have a voice &amp; donors who have dollars, it can be hard for community folk to have a say.
Remember- Universities are not solely sites of instruction and learning.  They are employers. Often they are significant players in local land use, zoning, and planning. They are contractors for everything from food service to major construction projects.
So part one -- Tuitions rise. Students &amp; families are burdened with crushing debt. Professors- who have significant debt themselves- make little more than two decades earlier. All the while university presidents earn millions in compensation packages.
And I am certain there is no need to remind y'all what the student debt trend line looks like. https://t.co/CiiZ1wK7cA
Here too @WakeForest participates.  In 2017 Wake Forest University President Nathan Hatch was the most richly compensated university president in the entire country. https://t.co/UllbLz4KKV
Meanwhile salaries of university presidents are soaring. https://t.co/KBeN0ycct9
This pattern holds true @WakeForest where full professor salaries outpace our colleagues in the state but assistant professors and continent faculty earn "league minimum" https://t.co/4pEfJzPwqb
One factor driving stagnant salaries is an increased reliance on part-time and adjunct faculty who typically have short contracts, can be easily terminated, and operate without academic freedom or governing power. https://t.co/FGroU9OufQ
Even as tuition and fees soar, professorial salaries remain stagnant.  Data from the USDOE show only those who attain the rank of full professor have experienced noticeable improvements in their pay. https://t.co/UIzMcfPyGA
College costs have risen much more swiftly than consumer prices or housing prices. https://t.co/p5XPD0h951
It is dramatically more expensive to attend college today than it was in 1980. Private colleges universities tuition hikes have outpaced public institutions. @WakeForest total costs of attendance have increased 123.72% from year 2000. https://t.co/UpkQOaVoU1
Just seeing many of messages of support. Thank you. Please know in big picture this issue is not about me. I raised issues about university labor practices because so many colleges including @WakeForest participate in actions that increase inequity for students, faculty, staff.
Thank you @jtlevy.  We have been friends and colleagues a long time. I deeply appreciate your belief in me. https://t.co/3fdy1UroMD

So @rtkersh and @WakeForest administration should be clear. I am NOT leaving or being silent. This is my alma mater. This is my home. The betrayal is painful &amp; scary. But I will not break  #notforsale
There is no question that I am a “difficult employee”. I don’t play nice or toe the line or pretend injustice does not exist. On Monday I reminded our community @WakeForest benefited from slavery &amp; Jim Crow and  we should raise questions as it encroaches downtown.  #notforsale
Meanwhile, even though I am full professor and hold the Maya Angelou presidential chair. @WakeForest has failed to even provide me with a faculty office this entire academic year— I taught 3 classes last semester. With no office. #notforsale
In 2016 I was raped in a public place by someone unknown to me. I was on a @WakeForest trip at the time but I never allowed my personal trauma to slow my commitment to me students. I led the program for months after the attack even through my terror of public places. #notforsale
Since 2014 I established and grew the @AJCCenter at @WakeForest including leading a collaborative of institutions of higher education to commit nearly 100 million in resources for the study of girls and women of color. https://t.co/QLJOOuRy70  #notforsale
In 2016 I worked with the team of @phiwfu to implement a groundbreaking bipartisan program @WaketheVote. Most of the resources for the program came from me. Not @WakeForest. But students regularly cite is a top reason they have an interest in the school. #notforsale
I have also been “difficult” to work with because even though I love @WakeForest I see the inequities of the place. I call them out even as I have worked to give students faculty and staff all I had. #notforsale
I have given my lifeblood to @WakeForest in recent years- leading two centers @phiwfu and @AJCCenter without pay. And giving tens of thousands as contribution to their work. #notforsale
Academic freedom is truly dead @WakeForest. Two days after a public MLK address where I called into question the university’s labor practices Provost @rtkersh sends an email “inviting” me to eliminate @AJCCenter as a university entity &amp; offering a “goodwill” payoff. #notforsale

Respectfully, I think you are likely an outlier on this issue. RK is massively successful recording artist &amp; songwriter. But I agree it has long been an “open secret” which is what I mean by ignored. Many compartmentalized the abuse allegations as though irrelevant. https://t.co/x5aBr1g9rl

Whenever I am tempted to write off Dr Angelou’s lesson of shared humanity I remind myself that she survived being raped as a young child.

I certainly plan to remain @WakeForest because I believe that at some point the truth of who we are as an institution will have to return. In the meantime it’s painful to watch students, faculty, and staff labor under this “leadership.” #DoBetterDeacs
I’ve worked @WakeForest since 2014– and for three years I donated more to the university for service and educational programs than I made in salary. I literally worked for free because I believed in our mission. But now the cruel and disingenuous administration has changed that.
Having graduated from @WakeForest more than 20 years ago and returning to serve on faculty 5 years ago I have always believed we were a place who truly cared for our students &amp; faculty. But under this new leadership. We are not even though some folks try. It’s very sad.
How depressing to receive a holiday message from @WakeForest administrators indicating the extent to which the motto #ProHumanitate (For humanity) is a lie and exclusively a marketing gimmick.

Nope. That hour belongs only to @tamronhall and if never return to a network that pays millions to rapist Lauer and racially insensitive Meg while nearly bankrupting my family for just telling the truth. F —- Andy Lack https://t.co/AOR9tsCOCY
@anjanaturner @NBCNews @megynkelly Such a lovely thought. That hour belongs only to @tamronhall! But it has been painful to see racially ignorant (Kelly) and rapist (Lauer) paid millions while my family went nearly bankrupt because I told the truth.

It's human to be moved by Kavanaugh's open grief abt losing so much- friends, opportunities to develop skills &amp; gifts, privacy- and to believe it is happening because someone is targeting you just because of identity. EXTEND THIS EMPATHY TO FAMLIES OF SLAIN UNARMED BLACK CHILDREN
It matters to see black women's vulnerability as well as celebrate our strength. Her voice may never have wavered, she may never have wept in public, but I assure you, what Professor Hill experienced was deeply deeply painful. To truly understand &amp; respond matters.
I hope @JoeBiden watched today and could see the attempts (though clumsy and often insufficient) made by many Democrats to offer Dr. Ford some shelter in this storm and noticed how different it was from the utter disdain &amp;disregard with which Prof Hill was treated by all.
I was shocked to learn from Prof Anita Hill that even though 25 years had passed since the Senate confirmation hearings,  @JoeBiden had never offered a personal apology to her. In 2017, he did make a public apology. https://t.co/eRxRSBK7fN
Today's hearings have me thinking again and again and again of what I learned while interviewing Anita Hill for @ESSENCE https://t.co/RdlOHegX9C
I’m an alum of this fellowship. It let me finish first book &amp; start second! @AAUW Fellowships and Grants applications are open! Over $3.8 million in funding available for women in #highered and community projects serving women and girls: https://t.co/i8tlu8PdeL
Pledging to spend today thinking of how to invest in minds, souls, talents of girls and women and sharing resources as I am able.
“To secure these rights, Governments are instituted among [persons], deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” Consent of the governed is the foundational principle of the American experiment in self governance. If women are citizens we must consent.
The disqualification is not the refusal to respect the right of one woman to consent in one moment. The disqualification is the refusal to respect the right of ALL women to consent at all times.
And despite the depth of daily trauma I live with as a woman who was raped both when I was still a child and when I was an an adult — I am pissed that ONLY the trauma of rape and sexual assault against women seems to get public attention.
As I’ve watched this moment unfold I’ve thought of the chairs, deans, provosts who missed my genius. I’ve considered the nasty brutality with which I was treated by media bosses who protected themselves and their positions.
As I’ve watched this moment unfold I  think of my childhood friends trapped in low income communities that provided little economic opportunity. And my college friends who’ve struggled with gender and racial bias in the workplace.
As I’ve watched this moment unfold I  think of my both my African American Grandma Rosa and White grandma Ann who were denied opportunities to explore the full extent of their  genius through education.
I have no illusions that “telling our stories” makes us strong. I know it can destroy our lives.
The second time a man raped me was the summer of 2016. There are people I told within hours. I have never reported it to the police. I learned from decades of living as a survivor, a public figure that reporting would only bring more pain, not justice.
The first time a man raped me he was an adult. I was 14. He was my neighbor. I did not tell anyone for nearly a decade.
I’m on the way! It’s going to a fantastic night. #CCCat50 https://t.co/bwFz8Yk4tw

Happy Mother's Day to author @MsTerryMcMillan. The day I spent hanging out with @IamLindseyG in Terry's shoe closet talking sex and politics is still an all time favorite. https://t.co/PLit9HKowV
Happy Mother's Day to my girl @YNPierce!  One of my greatest professional honors what speaking at her installation as the first woman Dean of @HUSDIVINITY. Her daughter also spoke. We both wept. So much love and respect for this steadfast servant, scholar, and friend!
Happy Mother's Day to @LucyWins2018.  Her son, Jordan Davis, was shot to death at a gas station by a man objecting to the music playing in the car. Lucy never stopped being Jordan's mom. Now she's running for Congress in Georgia's 6th.  Happy Mother's Day Lucy! We See YOU mama.

I adore you @JoanneNSmith, but you let folks at @GGENYC think the work they loved so much was mine. As you said, we only shine because of the team. Traci Curry, Rachel Sladja, Kai Ma, @JamilSmith, @ericsalzman —-they don’t always get the huge credit they deserve. 💕 them
As @GGENYC praised our work, I could not keep tears out of my eyes thinking of @ProfAsbury @collier @TraciProduces  &amp; the beloved young women producers of self proclaimed “curly corner” of former #Nerdland who insisted on diverse and relevant content.
Such overwhelming appreciation for @ShantaCovington after hearing so many girls and young women at @GGENYC tell me former #Nerdland was a place they felt their stories mattered. Shanta always FOUGHT to center girls &amp; women of color in the lineup. Always.
Feeling deep gratitude for @MichelleCumbo. During 15th Anniversary gala for @GGENYC I was reminded of her daily commitment to media diversity as we watched multiple clips of former #Nerdland featuring the extraordinary young women of @GGENYC &amp; other young voices Michelle booked.
Dear former #Nerdland producers, last night I shared the stage with @TheBarbaraSmith during the @GGENYC 15th Anniversary &amp; learned she regularly watched &amp; took notes during our 4 years on air. Even more than 2 years since the end  I remain so grateful to ALL of you. Keep shining.

There are certain things to which I am proud to be maladjusted ... I never intend to become adjusted to discrimination...or to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few.-- Dr. MLK,1967
Also worth noting, the Memphis sanitation strike does not end until April 16, 1968. King is assassinated April 4. The federal government passes landmark legislation April 11. These workers do not win the right to form a union until April 16. It took 65 days.
A week after his death, Dr. King, was still responsible for changing the landscape of American Civil Rights. April 11, President Johnson signed the National Fair Housing Act. It was MLK's death that gave him the leverage to finally win its passage. https://t.co/d7IkbTI4na
Four days after his assassination, Dr. King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, and his four young children go to Memphis where they march alongside the still-striking sanitation workers. 4 days! https://t.co/MQwqV530Or
How swiftly the end came for Dr. King! Final birthday Jan 15. Memphis sanitation workers Cole (36) &amp; Walker (30) killed by garbage truck Feb 1. Memphis strike begins Feb 12. MLK marches in Memphis where police kill 16-yr-old Larry Payne March 28. MLK gives final speech April 3.
In January I remembered Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his birthday, recalling him through a favorite photo and reflecting on the emotional toll of activism https://t.co/lKEeGJq5MD @ELLEmagazine
April 4 is the birthday of my beloved mentor, the late Dr. Maya Angelou and the day Dr. King was assassinated. When I knew her, the day evoked mixed emotions- joy &amp; sorrow, life &amp; loss. Even now Il stand in these intersections. Trying to remember and learn and teach.

It is crucial for media outlets to insist women of color aren't eliminated, erased, or overlooked in discussions reporting &amp; analysis of gender race  or economic vulnerability. It's far too easy for observers to pretend black &amp; brown women are super strong or just fine. We aren't
On balance this study seems to say "making it" to middle income or even wealth does not have an intergenerational protective capacity for black folk. Wasn't that manifest by murder of Jordan Davis or near death post childbirth of Serena Williams? Black life remains fragile.
Also wondering about use of tax returns as measure. Thinking of insight in Venkatesh's "Off the Books" that families in economically marginal communities often have more income than is reported. familieshttp://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674030718
Wondering why researchers chose to track mean (average) household income of children instead of mean? Isn't this subject to volatility because of a single (or a few) year(s) of atypical earning? especially given the time period crossing the late 1990s?

@litslime @sallykohn Not irrelevant 😂
I want to know if the personal staff, serving staff and custodial staff of 2018 Golden Globes experiences a discernible shift from prior years. That would be a great story. Perhaps someone has written it. That’s where I want to see the work manifest @sallykohn from the bottom up.
Feminism should ask “what truths are missing here” @sallykohn. So I would ask you and anyone with a platform “what do we miss when writing about Oprah?” “Whose story was NOT told?”
Seems to me @sallykohn that our collective national enthusiasm about POTUS Oprah is childish. We want some good adult to fix what is broken. But we are the adults. We have to fix it. What if the best POTUS candidate in room last night never got 🎤 because she’s not famous?
All good. I screwed all the way up recently relative to disability rights &amp; my article framing. Appreciate the response. Also want all of us to think of how we act as though removing 45 is THE answer. Racism, sexism preexisted and will persist. https://t.co/3olpTvpBKN
Zero beef w/ @sallykohn personally but come on. No one person, no matter how fabulous, can eliminate inequality. (ref see Pres Obama) Democracy is hard, messy, iterated work belonging to all. Magic is for fairytales &amp; hashtags. Stop it. https://t.co/nskaDrU7pp

Banning #TheNewJimCrow is unjust. Thinking it is the only source for understand race, criminal injustice &amp; American history is limiting.  What else would you include on #TheNewJimCrowIsBannedList?
"Just Mercy" by Bryan Stevenson has been hugely impactful in this space as well. #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
Add Beth Ritchie's "Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence, and America's Prison Nation" to understand how the system responds to black women's victimization my making them inmates.  #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
Crucial to add @MoniqueWMorris "PushOut: The Criminalization of Black Girls in Schools" to understand  contemporary generation and gender dynamics of the insidious system of criminal injustice. #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
Douglas Blackmon's "Slavery by Another Name: The Re-enslavement of Black Americans from Civil War to WWII" is core scholarship for 13th and Alexander  #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
"Worse than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice" is a foundational text on Mississippi's Jim Crow justice from which Alexander draws. #NewJimCrowIsBannedList https://t.co/c3KA33F8SF
"Marked: Race, Crime &amp; Finding Work in an era of Mass Incarceration" by @devah_pager is necessary to understand how powerfully race &amp; formerly incarcerated status interact to limit economic opportunity #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
"The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime &amp; Making of Modern Urban America" by @KhalilGMuhammad the former director of @SchomburgCenter now of @Harvard is a perfect start for #NewJimCrowIsBannedList
The injustice &amp; inhumanity of banning Alexander's The New Jim Crow for New Jersey's incarcerated readers seems obvious, but while @ACLU battles, let's remember there are many sources for this knowledge.  I'll suggest titles in next tweets. #NewJimCrowIsBannedList https://t.co/gDzM4BPIw6

And then there were the nights with @aliciagarza ....#mhp2017 https://t.co/9ZJK3lcEUx
That too was an epic evening complete with our all time most amazing “third wheel” @MayaHold3r and a late night battle dance with @SymoneDSanders at the Buzzfeed after party. 🔥🔥🤣 #mhp2017 https://t.co/SxLeOxEJQQ
Ate only veggies for a week and put on one of my “Dorian Dresses” to hang out with my fave plus1 &amp; @tapfreedom cohost @dorianwarren at the @iamsambee #NotTheWhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinner https://t.co/wH5v8bz1zS
And we lost Mark and I forget. sometimes I pick up my phone to text or call before I remember he is gone. It is not bearable. #mhp2017 https://t.co/qjAttasD9N
And there were so many lectures, and flights, and hotels, and audiences, and power point slides. But I work hard to make each unique and to remember each one.  #mhp2017 https://t.co/t6yDECrUHT
And you know, there was family.  😂#mhp2017 https://t.co/M337cAXeYV
And @ProfessorCrunk hugged me in a NYC bar because I was more sad and more exhausted than I ever tell anyone but she knew and she always knows. So she hugged me and I let her because God I needed the rest. #mhp2017 https://t.co/UtBWiYbIpO
Then the brilliant @annthuynguyen caught me cutting up with @DaniParker81 in a NYC Starbucks just after we saved her unborn baby from too tight pantyhose &amp; just before we went to see @Baratunde and @Questlove That entire night was freaking epic.  #mhp2017 https://t.co/3ezSuVC1Np

So you understand nothing huh? I owed taxes because I DID NOT cheat. I owed because I earned and reported. I didn’t hide or shelter. Notice media didn’t report 30 days later when bill was paid in full. Be gone. Talk to POTUS 45 about his taxes. Stay out my timeline. https://t.co/2KjhQlWy9K

@ArtbyAWOHS No not al all. Didn’t feel like a landmine because there was no spirit of war/ destruction. The word deaf didn’t evoke that meaning for me, but when writing I want to know what words mean to my readers. It’s why I write.

Hey @dorianwarren! Reading this final paper I see you must have spent at least an hour talking politics, protest &amp; generational change with my @wakeforest student. Thank you. I remember that day. You'd flown cross country, spoken on a panel &amp; barely slept. You're the best.
I am moved by the candor and depth of analysis @eveewing offered my @wakeforest student during the interview granted to her for a final paper.  Thank you!

Hey @unrulybabyhair, thanks for the 🔥🔥 interview you granted to one of my @WakeForest students. You covered Thomas Hobbes, capitalism, race, the social contract, the Confederacy, the efficacy of protest, &amp; modern policing.... in 20 mins! 👍🏾
@rgay I really really really suck at “self care” ask @aliciagarza I’m not for it. 😂 I’m like “help me girl” in the middle of the night. It’s why I keep West Coast friends.
@rgay Love ya. Call on me. I’ll get you when you can’t get you. And you get me when I need it ok? We can be #squad
@rgay We aren’t supposed to take care of ourselves. Others are supposed to do it. And we for them. #SquadCare https://t.co/uNQr5Cm5bP
@rgay This is among the many reasons I strongly object to the self-care imperative. It is another thing for women “to do.” Another thing we are supposed to be good at.  Another class in which to earn an A. Guess who doesn’t take of themselves ? 👀
@rgay I call bullshit.

After Nov 2016 ppl asked me why I'd long predicted a Trump victory, There're many reasons. We're in the midst of one. There are "p---y grabbers" in power everywhere &amp; it borders on delusional to pretend it is a disqualification for winning.

@Jillove1 Indeed.
@leavyrdailyhell Cognitive negativity bias -focus on perpetrators/ shooters/ assailants not survivors. Evolution needs us to identify threat. But it sucks.
@TsaraShelton I’m not sure there is some “other side” we reach.  Survival, shame, distress change with seasons but I’ve never found some end point.
@SbayitSeshat I’m so sorry you’ve been ignored, disbelieved &amp; dismissed. It’s a brutal additional trauma and the perpetrators know it.
@Poverbs_3 Often spent days recovering and I️ think this news cycle would have buried me.
@Poverbs_3 Appreciate this but I’ve never been happier not to report the news. It was always hard to do rape/sex assault segments on live TV.
@katieervincarl Thanks for responding. Take good care.

@kelleycalkins Thank you.  Yes the posturing is maddening.
@nikkilaird99 Valuable question. What’s next? Firing/ shaming perpetrators is insufficient in the long run isn’t it?
@renegademom Hang in there. Surviving is all we have to do some days.
@kelleycalkins Tell me about hopeful. Genuinely interested. What feels hopeful? I’m sorry your story was met with crickets. I️ understand that completely
@rawlingseliza Considered that. But for me that’s not all of it. Feel real solidarity with survivors across race &amp; class.
@renegademom Please know I’ll keep you in my heart. Do you have a community to offer support?
@ElisaWilding Thank you. Maybe it’s spending years alone with it then having it reported by media as though speaking alone heals. It doesn’t.
Exhausting yes. I️ share that. But lots of other aspects bothering me. Maybe just how it’s being reported.

And oh yeah @WakeForest don't try to control me with vague emails to staff. #ThatAintGonnaWork #HaveALittleCourage
No need to fear disruption, difference, disagreement @wakeforest The #FirstAmendment allows more ideas in the marketplace. Good. Compete.
If @wakeforest students want to protest, disrupt &amp; speak, then we should teach &amp; support so it's safe &amp; effective. Not threaten &amp; sanction.
All of @WakeForest must be able to speak &amp; to disrupt. Tenured &amp; contingent faculty. Citizens &amp; undocumented. Liberal &amp; Conservative.
I LOVE @WakeForest. It's my alma mater &amp; where I want to work until I retire. But I will not be silent when it goes astray. #FirstAmendment
Lesson 1 @WakeForest: if you claim to "welcome feedback" then don't flip when it is critical, public, loud &amp; lewd. Be honest.
It's like performance art each time @WakeForest sends totalitarian emails abt proper behavior &amp; plans to sanction disruption #FirstAmendment

And you know it took #SquadCare to survive #Ferguson. @TheEricaJ is bringing us that story later this week. https://t.co/vzVTf59Hde

Each scholar chose a different aspect of #SquadCare https://t.co/KzSp07K6Az
The process was #SquadCare in action: @AJCCenter scholars worked together for months &amp; Prof  @SherriWrites had my WHOLE ENTIRE back! https://t.co/ywN2IgDHXz
Ma'am! Listen https://t.co/M90WJ99vd0
And of course the whole point being that a t-shirt is furthering the entire capitalism circle..... #irony #SquadCare #comedy #ReadAnnsPiece https://t.co/nuEFLeLuIG
Yes. Can't wait for your stories to @Mankaprr to drop this week as part of #SquadCare They make it absolutely clear. https://t.co/ejE8SZ3jWB

Yes, we can watch each other's kids, but damn it, how about some affordable child care? #SquadCare https://t.co/Tsp2AWRvvo
This is the hardest part right? What if your whole damn squad needs care? That is why public policy must be part of it. #squadcare https://t.co/Tsp2AWRvvo
Yup. What if self-care is just another way of  saying those with the resources to take care of self are *good* those without are *bad*? https://t.co/vtcaxJaM1U
Agreed and #SquadCare is about different kinds of squads. Friends, family, but also government &amp; public policy. HEALTH CARE is #SquadCare https://t.co/x1Ih31DYRo
Fair! Not mutually exclusive. Just encouraging us to be careful about the *self* aspect.  TBH I worry self- is another item on to-do list https://t.co/21yThX1en0
Self-care continues to focus on what you can do for you. I want us to think about our responsibilities to have each other's back. #SquadCare https://t.co/Fqr6Mywz29
