7) The American people deserve some honest answers about the most glossed over scandal in American history. The resistance leaders in the House should not be allowed to ignore the FBI scandal as they attempt to destroy President Trump with their hyper-partisan subpoena cannon.
6) Sen. Graham must do a deep dive into why Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page and Baker have all either been fired or have resigned as a result of their destructive activities at the FBI. As Rep. Jim Jordan describes them, ‚ÄúAll unelected and all plotted against the president.‚Äù
5) These inconsistent answers that have twisted McCabe into a pretzel underscore the need for a thorough ‚Äúinvestigation of the investigators‚Äù by the Senate Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
4) What‚Äôs also unbelievable is what McCabe told Savannah Guthrie in his recent interview on NBC. McCabe claimed to have no recollection of the infamous ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù meeting in his office with former FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
3) In a blatant attempt to get more unhinged resistance Democrats to buy his book, McCabe is busy weaving tall tales about his biased investigations against candidate Trump, as well as his knowledge of a failed deep state coup attempt against President Donald Trump
2) McCabe is espousing the qualities of a desperate man. He‚Äôs been under investigation by a federal grand jury for months for allegedly lying under oath and is actively trying to impugn the integrity of DOJ IG Horowitz, the career investigator who made the criminal referral
1) McCabe and Comey have a lot in common. They‚Äôre both leakers. They‚Äôre both liars. And they‚Äôre both lousy political hacks who‚Äôve written books that attempt to bleach history just like Hillary Clinton did with her emails.

3) And why were the homes of Trump associates raided before dawn, while Clinton confidants Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson were granted immunity in exchange for nothing? Special Counsel Mueller should address these issues as a way to restore some trust.
2) For instance, why was National Security Adviser and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn prosecuted for making false statements to the FBI, while high-ranking Clinton aide Huma Abedin was given a free pass?
1) The American people are also still waiting for answers about the clear double standard in investigative tactics when comparing the Russia investigation and the Clinton email investigation.
9) and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper‚Äôs alleged leaking.
8) former CIA Director John Brennan‚Äôs August 2016 political stunt in conjunction with former Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada;
7) former FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs alleged false statements to Congress;
6) Former British spy Christopher Steele‚Äôs collusion with Russians on behalf of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign;
5) Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court application abuses;
4) The Obama administration‚Äôs failure to confront Russian interference;
3) Since the special counsel was given the broad mandate to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, it will be telling to see if the Mueller team followed every investigative lead.  This would include:
2) After almost two years of secrecy, it‚Äôs time for some transparency.
1) If Mueller decides to send a final report to incoming Attorney General William Barr, that report should be released in full so the American people and Congress can see exactly what his long and expensive investigation found, did not find, and how it was conducted.

A rushed vote on a Balanced Budget Amendment this week gives wavering Members of Congress the excuse they need to vote against it.  Have a real debate and make the case to the American people!
An issue as important as a Balanced Budget Amendment deserves a robust national debate.  If Republican leaders in Congress truly want this to be a successful endeavor they should do it the right way.
Citizens United supports a Balanced Budget Amendment.  Federal spending is totally out of control and everyone knows it.  However, holding a vote on the BBA this week with little to no debate is wrong.
