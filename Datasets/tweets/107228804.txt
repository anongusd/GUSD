@KarlBode u got the wrong guy. Still not a QWEST fan.
@KarlBode agreed. QWEST sucks. Innovations/responses that destroyed UTOPIA's divinations. Netflix, Comcast, cell growth.
@KarlBode i get your point on ILECs, esp. QWEST, but that's not the point. The response to a bad provider, QWEST, was a boondoggle, UTOPIA.
@KarlBode r u saying that the innovations that ruined UTOPIA's projections r failures?
@elforesto @j_kane @karlbode Yes, mktplace innovation surprised folks - like I said it would. But, UTOPIA is the 1 screwing taxpayers.
@elforesto not just data, buddy. We've been talking about UTOPIA's triple play market competitors, like cells, Comcast, Netflix, etc.
@elforesto @j_kane and, u might want to check w UTOPIA. 1 of their blown-projection excuses is cell usage.
@elforesto @j_kane if u r correct, and he says mvmnt from landlines to cells is insignificant, @karlbode should be a UTOPIA advisor.
@elforesto @j_kane in 7 years houses w/ o landlines moved from 3% to 25%. More w/ younger users. Plz name 1 unimpressed "expert".
@bbart76 UTOPIA said C and Q cherry pick; Govt should back it for ubiquitous service. "Ubiquitous" must be big word for cherry picking.
@TySpace well, if u let the Downs Syndrome kids do it, then . . . well, I guess u then show that basic decency still exists. Geez.
@J_Kane wireless now is huge triple-play competition. Franchises/street ezmnts less crucial. (Of course, wireless too is very consolidated).
@J_Kane @elforesto yes and yes.
@elforesto I was wrong. Comcast has invested $500M, not $200M, in Utah last few years. UTOPIA was charlatans finding chumps. #utpol
@elforesto Comcast at least $200 million. But real answer is enough to get all the customers that UTOPIA divined it would get. #utpol
@elforesto Are you unaware of the 100s of millions that UTOPIA competitors have invested? That's why they're #winning. #utpol
@elforesto Exactly. "With demand" = cherry picking. Non-taxpayer subsidized entities also r eager to serve areas w/ demand. #utpol
@redsoxunixgeek sure, but, in mktplace & to users, telecom is networks, not FCC definitions. UTOPIA competes w ILECs, CLECs, Comcast, etc.
@elforesto @TySpace U really need evidence that UTOPIA cherry picks? West Valley citizens can't get UTOPIA. #utpol
@TySpace but UTOPIA is using taxpayer $ to cherry pick same high-value areas served by others (WVC pays w/o benefitting). #utpol
@elforesto Maybe that's the prob. UTOPIA doesn't realize it's in telecomm sector. Comcast and AT&T realize it. #utpol
@elforesto they can't; roads are socialized. Just like that kills mkt for private roads, WVC used citizens' money to deter comp'n. #utpol
@elforesto yes! Roads, water, power are socialized. Slow-moving, patient capital industries. Huge mistake to socialize fast-mving telecomm.
@elforesto though some words invite hyperbole, that doesn't mean they're not spot on at times. UTOPIA = telecomm socialism. #utpol
@elforesto mkt refused to fund UTOPIA, so backers turned to govt. If that's not "socializing" the project, what would you call it? #utpol

@thesidetrack no way. Contrary to EK's non-quote summary, Beers actually said dynamic sit'n called for $4T in debt reduction. #utpol.
@thesidetrack sort of, but u forgot the step, "It shows they likely won't figure out long-term way to reduce debt to GDP ratio." #utpol
@thesidetrack Beers didn't say raising ceiling enough. Said sit'n called for debt reduction plan. EK made up summation = hack (EK). #utpol

@thesidetrack Jason, missed yr point earlier. But S&P didn't mention frosh dysfunction. "Brinksmanship" applies to both. O demanded taxes.

@jdartute I didn't. I said "if", pointing out the need for the exec to have measured the effects after the sudden declaration.
@jdartute entire state budget based on fiscal notes of every bill. If this one is wrong, internal service fund will handle the costs.
@jdartute no, previously the paid workout time was during lunch. Thought was the mid-day break revived employees for rest of day.
@jeremyvotaw I link to the audit in my blog post. The audit is what I was saying is so solid, not my bloggeriffic musings. OLAG rocks #utpol
@nataliecgordon we think we r doing it right fiscally. Fiscal note was zero. We go by that. If Gov says needs $$, he can come back. #utpol
(cont'd) . . . no lunch breaks, managers' concerns, the paid home exercise. Exec needs to see how those things affect productivity.
@jeremyvotaw OLAG points out weaknesses in programs and management. In this audit, for ex, they pointed out tired workers, . . . (cont'd)
@jeremyvotaw I truly am sorry. Wished for Untweet button.  But your dismissal of a thorough audit was awfully flip. Sorry again though.

@elforesto Exactly my point! So, you've gotta include separate (huge) UTOPIA install costs when comparing monthly fees.
? @elforesto I don't follow.
Any ISP, incl UTOPIA, will give great rates . . . if you pay to run fiber to your home. That, @ethanmillard, is the weird contract.
@elforesto, they all say "serving all UTOPIA cities"; it's just not true. UTOPIA cherry picks w the best of them. WVC is left out.
@elforesto, tell Fibernet. It just told me WVC people not already on UTOPIA should look to Qwest.
Um, @ethanmillard & @elforesto, perhaps you've forgotten WVC residents can't get a new UTOPIA connection. No = slow. But keep paying!
@lanhel, @elforesto, private sector evolved (faster & more wireless). UTOPIA cities left w burden and no better service or pricing. #utpol

@elforesto From your lips to Justice Kennedy's ear.
@windley In truth, "inadequate" means they don't have the specific one I want at that very moment.
@TySpace My daughter: "I'm sick of rain." I don't take that desert rat to Houston enough. Virgin River quite low earlier (considering).
@TySpace Lots of rain. Some snow now as temp drops. Been snowing hard (for us) just above SG. Ugly, but that's winter. It happens.
@TySpace @elforesto Ya, it's Utah. Greatest snow on earth, and all that. Social media has super freak-out powers.
@windley Do you find instant play choices adequate? I've quickly looked (mins before flight) and thought selection was pretty thin.

@elforesto Amen. Govt can pick winners and losers like no one else.
@elforesto details unimportant to big govt types. Point is more Govt control. Results: less capital, less innovation, even more govt.
Net neutrality: because we need Govt to protect us from fake monsters.

@Utah_Guru You're right. Here r acceptable i.d.s. http://bit.ly/b7xuwJ. (But, they don't need to be produced for DPC).
@Utah_Guru @RobAlexander possible solution.  Legal aliens produce biometric i.d.  Illegal aliens do not.  T/f, easy to create alias.
@J_Kane @RobAlexander yes, to crimes.  Identity theft.  Will do post Mon on lax standards and ease of creating sanctioned alias.
@RobAlexander @J_Kane not at all the case (my understanding, based on talks w/ local/fed cops); cards used virtually everywhere.
@RobAlexander that's my understanding.  Easier w/ card, but possible w/o.
@cboyack @elforesto shouldn't it, though?  More rigorous testing needed?
