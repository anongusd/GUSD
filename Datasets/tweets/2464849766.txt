@SecretarySonny @POTUS 10 million metric tons more than under Obama? No. 10 million metric tons more than zero, which was a crisis that required a bailout completely manufactured by the Trump administration.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/N7IeSB55TL
@realDonaldTrump Those are the fences you said were useless. You said you would have Mexico pay for a real wall. Instead we are paying for the same fence Obama made us pay for.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Trump takes Putin's word over the US intel community's word. Does that count as a denunciation?
@ProvostMindy @deejayquai @GamingWithNuke @realDonaldTrump Trump golfed a day or two after he declared a National Emergency. Are you fake or stupid?
@realDonaldTrump Those are the same fences built during the Obama administration. You said they were useless.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @vpotus They can't apply the 25th without the VP or cabinet. If they had reached out as you suggest, it would have actually become a possibility. Are you pretending to be stupid or do you hate the constitution?
@humberto0802 @LoydTFell1 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Why are they unwelcome if they walk to a port of entry on the southern border, but welcome if they build a boat and float to Ellis Island?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews You guys will have so much to complain about when you're playing handball together in prison.
@swainjk @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Why is it different if they build a boat and float to an island?
@pleus_ryan @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump How is seeking asylum illegal?
@Leon24879657 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump What process do they go through now?
@LoydTFell1 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Why are they unwelcome if they walk to a port of entry on the southern border, but welcome if they build a boat and float to Ellis Island?
@realDonaldTrump CA gives more than it takes from the federal government so it supports the southern welfare states that make up your base. And speaking of wasting money, you signed a bill that cut taxes and increased spending sending the national debt to 22 trillion dollars.
@realDonaldTrump @MjrCitiesChiefs @MCSheriffs We love it when you pretend to like cops.
@DonaldJTrumpJr A co-conspirator didn't find any evidence? Shocking. https://t.co/N7IeSB55TL
@PressSec She writes this not realizing that she's in line.
@SebGorka @KamalaHarris Do you constantly misinform people for fun, profit, or are you willfully ignorant? Tax refunds are lower because deductions were eliminated. Go read the spin that was written when the bill was drafted and get back to us.
@seanhannity The worst part is that everyone gets their information from you instead of reading it themselves and creating their own thoughts about it.
@dbongino Collusion has already been established unlike the wall which isn't already being built.
@realDonaldTrump And it's 60 of 2,000 miles. You are the best negotiator. #promiseskept
@realDonaldTrump By "wall" you mean the same fencing that was built under the Obama administration that you mocked as useless?
@seanhannity If it's not David Pecker you are wrong.
@HowardSchultz Let's put Americans' interest over billionaires' interests and elect people who actually represent us instead of people who have spent their lives making money off of us and want to use it to buy an election. Washington was a General in the Revolution. What has Schultz done?
@realDonaldTrump Good job. You read all of the words with very little slurring. A solid C.
@NatEnquirer How dumb do you have to be to blackmail Bezos? Who next, Robert Mueller?
@NatEnquirer Are you going to publish the Bezos pics before you go to prison?
@HowardSchultz Why don't you do something good for people who are struggling in the city of Seattle first and then ask to lead the entire country? You can start with everyone sleeping under I-5.

@DonaldJTrumpJr These cats are scared and feral	The flag pins on their lapels	The truth is anybody's guess	These talking heads are saying	"The king is only playing a game of four dimensional chess" 	- @better_oblivion
@senatemajldr You obstructed for eight years and then sold the United States of America to whoever owns you now. I hope you come clean. Have fun in the history books.
@michaeljknowles Wasn't he the guy with the porn star who led the authorities to Michael Cohen where they obtained enough evidence to send everyone to prison?
@SebGorka Wasn't he the guy with the porn star who led the authorities to Michael Cohen where they obtained enough evidence to send everyone to prison?
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit Whoever told you Mueller is done is fake news and you are gullible.
@realDonaldTrump Too bad reading a speech off of a screen isn't an accomplishment.
@TurboKia @TrumpsareNazis @williamlegate @Xaenie I write topical humor and sometimes I see my thoughts show up later that night on Colbert or the Daily Show. Anybody know a good attorney?
@JoshNBCNews @PressSec "Creative environment" is definitely one way to describe @foxandfriends .
@RepMarkMeadows It has already been established that the people within the campaign were colluding. This is beyond "playing politics." Why are you still riding the ride?
@RealJamesWoods https://t.co/5CYdieyeWu
@DanCrenshawTX Brady makes about 15 million per year, so 5 million of that would be subject. However Belichick makes under 10 million and would not be subject to the tax. Are you asking for Brady?
@realDonaldTrump Democrats have built more walls than you have. They are cost effective and strategically placed. They are not going to give you 25 billion to erect 2000 miles of reject prototypes across a desert.
@DanCrenshawTX The president should have taken the 892 million that was sent to him to get started.
@rororxyz @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Says the very important somebody.
@realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Only gullible people who can't see you constantly contradicting yourself and displaying your inability to lead or negotiate will be on the edge of their seats. The rest of us will be laughing or asleep.
@TulsiGabbard Are you still affiliated with the Potomac Square Group?
@ericbolling @HowardSchultz Because living in government subsidized housing and relying on third world labor to sell drugs is "self-made." He will probably take a lot of votes away from Mike Pence.
@ABoyBrushedRed9 @shaunking Maybe you should read the eighth amendment.
@KatTimpf The mushrooms are pretty good in Portland.
@seanspicer @nytimes @katierogers Orange face is still acceptable and popular despite the outcry of oompa loompas everywhere.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Democrats have built more walls than Trump. They just don't want to pay 25 billion for 2000 miles of reject prototypes across a desert.
@rainspatrick86 @CBSNews You haven't heard of @HowardSchultz?
@GeorgePapa19 We are happy to see that you are involved in helping opioid addicts with cannabis. It sure beats making coffee for the president. That guy does not need any more speed.
@mitchellvii They had nothing to gain to begin with. If you outplay people who weren't playing did you really outplay them?
@greggutfeld @KatTimpf CNN's @ErinBurnett did a segment on why that question is important. Maybe you were watching Fox.
@GeorgePapa19 I thought the president's former barista would be friendlier than this.
@DanCrenshawTX What happened when you alerted authorities?
@realDonaldTrump I can't wait until Howard Schultz becomes the GOP nominee after he beats Mike Pence in a primary.
@realDonaldTrump We read your tweet where you called them naive, passive, wrong and needed to go back to school while contradicting everything they said. How else were we supposed to interpret that?
@JasonM1980 @mitchellvii If nobody lied about the wall, Mexico would have already paid for it.
@GeorgeTakei He is going to take a lot of votes away from Mike Pence.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why are the Democrats trying to fund the ports of entry when all the drugs are coming in at the ports of entry? Maybe if your dad stop paying border patrol again it will solve everything this time.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Just saw your dad on TV. I think he's having a stroke.
@seanhannity Why are the Democrats requesting funding for ports of entry when all the drugs are coming in through the ports of entry?!!!1!! Maybe if we stop paying border patrol again it will solve the problem.
@realDonaldTrump Listening to you speak now. We have a wall, we don't have a wall. It's being built, it's not being built. People are flooding over, we're keeping people out. You say literally everything. If you were anyone else you would be evaluated in a padded room.
@TaxReformExpert I had know idea she was Venezuelan.
@RealJamesWoods Sorry, fellow American, we had to write bigger welfare checks to the farmers and cut taxes at the same time, but don't worry. We will keep using you as a political tool for immigration.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Is this part of your "I'm retarded" defense for your indictment?
@mitchellvii If Trump can't build a wall, Schultz will! #MAGA
@TheBossBeach @GOP4Schultz @shrobb2 @williamlegate I'm at PerfoTech HQ but on my breaks I'm on the Schultz Train. #MAGA
@GOP4Schultz Too many quad tall americanos. PerfoTech thinks I'm a meth head. I might have to switch to 5 hour energy, but I feel like it's discrimination.
@GOP4Schultz I doubt it. I get drug tested all the time and I still work here.
@GOP4Schultz If it's not a drug why do I want to destroy everything until I get it?
@GOP4Schultz Schultz is a genius. Get out of government funded housing by marking up a popular drug 1500% and sell it on every corner. If only everyone else in the projects was that smart.
@mitchellvii He waited two years for Republicans to do it themselves. How much longer does he have to wait for the opposition to do it for him?
@HowardSchultz @WSJ You are going to take a lot of votes from Mike Pence. Good luck on your run as a conservative.
@HowardSchultz Schultz knows that the answer to getting out of the projects is to mark up a popular drug 1500% and sell it on every corner. Why won't any of you listen to this condescending savior?
@ScottWalker I hear you'll do just about anything to stay warm. https://t.co/bgsCFfS5LU
@realDonaldTrump For the sixth time in a year! WOW!
@HowardSchultz @Morning_Joe You are like Trump but without the gullible fan club. You need to lie more about how great you're going to be.
@realDonaldTrump Are these tweets today part of your future legal defense when you have to convince a jury that your brain is rotten mush?
@CDAEllen @EricTrump @amazon @washingtonpost It sounds that way because the voice in your head that reads to you is a jealous teenage bully.
@PerfoTech has learned @JacobAWohl has cancelled his services @PerfoTech . Please contact us at anytime and we will send you coupons. We have everything you want and everything you need. Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@JacobAWohl It tells you they are too weak to overcome the United States overthrowing their government and turning it into garbage.
@sdt927 @NRA Please remain calm. Help is on the way. https://t.co/yGENKFgNOy
@EricTrump @amazon @washingtonpost Appeal to hypocrisy is the Trump family's only weapon. They are horrible people because everyone they know is a horrible person and that justifies their lack of ethics and morals. It is also a primary tool used in Russian propaganda.
@KatTimpf It exists because people are watching it and that is the insane part.
@DrJillStein Let's fill the void with corporate billionaires.
@PatrickRuffini You can prove anything with four to five hundred randos on Twitter.
@DrJillStein @FoxNews @HowardSchultz @CNN @MSNBC Will you clarify if Schultz owes money to Trump or to Putin directly?
@brithume Conservatives cut spending when they cut taxes. Why did they throw away everything they believed in for Donald Trump?
@NRA If your loved ones give money to criminal organizations, it doesn't mean you should stop loving them nor does it mean those organizations are no longer criminal.
@senatemajldr By "their friends" do you mean "American citizens?" That's better than helping "your friends."
@JulieBanderas @BreitbartNews They were probably confusing you with Judge Jeanine Pirro.
@HowardSchultz @TheView Why don't you just pay whatever you owe Donald Trump in cash instead of preforming these political circus tricks?
@ebarrymccarthy @JulieBanderas Why would she get out of the kitchen when she's burning the stupid people pretty good and all they can say is that her eyes water?
@JudgeJeanine Since you care so much about the people what are you going to do about it?
@JackBla51417423 @Captain_X_Gogo @CheriJacobus Do you believe that a real Russian asset would charge rubles?
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump makes decisions when the TV tells him to, or more importantly, when the people stand up and shut down airports.
@ClueHeywood Continue highlighting the absurdity of marketing campaigns and if comedy is your thing start an open mic at your dive bar.
@michaelglassner With this lawsuit the Trump campaign is confirming that the book tells the truth. Cliff Sims should send you a thank you gift for the increased sales.
@ayejayD @williamlegate @thehill His entire campaign was a list of grievances. Can you remember a time when he wasn't mad?
@bigricanman @jules_su @mattapuzzo @adamgoldmanNYT You should work for ICE and cause illegal immigration.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump February 22nd would have been a better time.

@charliekirk11 Do you live in a cave?
@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner @FoxNews When the propaganda arm of your tyranny turns on you it's going to be a bad week.
@HowardSchultz If you want to help challenge the president in a primary.
PerfoTech is coming.
@e_vansmack @gatewaypundit @KatyinIndy They are all prostitutes but some of them wear suits to hide it.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump The only promise he kept was when he said he would shut down the government.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump If it's an emergency he should do it now. That's like if I chopped off my finger and waited three weeks for it to grow back before I went to the hospital.
@charliekirk11 Socialism is about tariffs and bailouts. Too bad both parties normalize socialism and there's not a conservative with a spine to be found. https://t.co/ozeH7geExm
@JudgeJeanine @David_Bossie How did you go from being a judge to rebelling against the entire justice system? What was the turning point when you finally decided that a system of law and order with due process was garbage? Or is the law just for poor people who don't watch your show?
@JudgeJeanine @David_Bossie I can hear you screeching from the other room where you are invading the dreams of an old man at rest with government propaganda. It's really effective because he's clueless, but how do you sell drugs and mesothelioma books when half of your audience is asleep?
@realDonaldTrump I like how you keep talking as if people still take you seriously. You can't negotiate and it's obvious to everyone. Call an emergency now so we can accelerate your circus to its predictable conclusion.
@RealJamesWoods What channel are you watching? The media is spending every second following the self destruction of the GOP. I can't remember when I saw a story about anything else.
@realDonaldTrump Anybody down for a game of tu quoque? If everybody else in the world was a giant liar, it would not mean that Roger Stone was not a liar.
@charliekirk11 Grand jury convened Thursday and 12 sealed criminal indictments were filed in a DC court Wed and Thur. Anyone who can put a five piece puzzle together could have figured out something big was coming today. They are probably still parked outside of DJTJ's house.
@CNNnewsroom @DanaBashCNN Twelve sealed criminal indictments were filed this week in DC.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe it was the rare Thursday grand jury meeting or the twelve sealed indictments filed Wednesday and Thursday that alerted them. They were probably staking out your kid's house also. Maybe next week.
@realDonaldTrump Do you still love wiki leaks, stable genius?
@FoxNews Is this account for sale? I would like to place a bid.
@SheriffClarke @GOPLeader @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Let's be honest. The president wants to burn this country to the ground and the GOP has been inexplicably complicit for two years.
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump The president is not your lord and savior. If you are being compromised or blackmailed please go to law enforcement.
@senatemajldr You had a chance to prevent the shutdown when the president vetoed the bill you passed a month ago. Who has your balls in a jar, Mitch? Law enforcement can help you if you just start talking.
@realDonaldTrump We are happy that you found someone who will call you out on not knowing anything about the United States government and how it works.
@realDonaldTrump Longest shutdown in history created under a government completely controlled by the GOP. President took responsibility on 12/11/18. We are witnessing the end of a party. If you are actually conservative and not a part of Trump's destructive nihilism, start building a new party.
@senatemajldr The president is not lord and savior you spineless fool.
@Mommabarb54 @susanmitch7 @Franklin_Graham @VP @mike_pence @SecondLady The only thing Graham has inside of him is Mike Pence's penis.

@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr If they are united, why didn't they fund it when they had the chance? Are you blackmailing Cocaine Mitch?
@realDonaldTrump Border patrol is increasingly susceptible to bribery as each day goes by with no money and Latinos like Trump more? Shocking.
@realDonaldTrump They relied on your drunk puppet Papadopoulos who dished to foreign statesmen. Glad to hear though that you are admitting that there is evidence.
@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Look at this retard trying to rally the coastal elites he rails against to make his case. What a sad sack of crap and gullible people are going to eat it up.
@senatemajldr You have to start striving before you keep striving. Reflect on your motivations for destroying the country and share them with us so that we can figure out what to do with you.
@williamlegate The Kremlin gets what the Kremlin wants.
@SebGorka Conservatism is dead. Now we have neoliberals and Trump. Going to have to find another party.
@JacobAWohl You were just calling for the abolition of the first amendment yesterday. Now you want other people to move? GTFO
@SebGorka Nope. Everything is punchable, really.
@Ackrinyc @integrity_2017 @SecPompeo @StateDept McConnell could open the government tomorrow. Don't expect Democrats to fix GOP error.
@acdavid25 @garret_hancock @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow He's either holding out to throw Trump under the bus for stabbing him in the back on the first bill or he's entwined and being blackmailed. Or maybe he's just a piece of shit. Place your bets.
@garret_hancock @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow The Senate could open it right now.
@realDonaldTrump We will look back on this time and remember that we elected a retarded man to lead us and then constantly made fun of him for being retarded.
@realDonaldTrump Then tell Mitch to open the government silly tard. I assume he is working for you.
@realDonaldTrump You stopped paying border patrol and they are increasingly susceptible to bribery as each day goes by. Why wouldn't they love you?
@Marvel28768 @charliekirk11 Fails to mention your household is accumulating $11,000 in new debt every year with no end in sight and last year you agreed to take a giant pay cut.
@charliekirk11 Maybe Democrats are as stupid as Republicans. Have you ever thought of that?
@senatemajldr @POTUS YOU can reopen the government anytime you like, Mitch. Are you throwing the president under the bus or are you just too mobbed up right now to do anything about it?
@JacobAWohl Robert Mueller is to investigate and report. Only the Senate or his cabinet can remove him. For the love of God, read a book.

@dbongino While making fun of Buzzfeed D Bong spreads fake news about the dossier on Tucker's show who even more hilariously is ranting and raving like a loon about how journalism shouldn't be emotional.
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Is it even worth telling people that Trump is a globalist? Nobody will believe it after they see this sketch of him in a safety vest.
@senatemajldr It's time to vote, Mitch. Blink twice if you are in trouble. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump Fake news. Yesterday your lawyer told us it's not a witch hunt.
@senatemajldr Russians have your balls in a jar or you are a soulless traitor to the United States. Which one are you going to pick when the reckoning arrives?
@realDonaldTrump You are looking in a mirror. Not even your lawyer can keep his story straight. This is going to be so much fun.
@realDonaldTrump Because as soon as the government opens your ass is in a frying pan and you refuse to accept that for anything less than five billion dollars. If anything else was true we would have seen your amazing negotiating skills by now.
@RogueUSMint Here's some ground beef that hasn't been inspected sitting out for hours. CONGRATULATIONS!
@charliekirk11 Breaking news! Corporations own America and all of our politicians. That's not news anymore. Campaign finance reform would be news.
@realDonaldTrump Swamp hasn't been drained, nobody has been locked up, ACA has not been replaced, and if the wall is built it won't be the wall you sold and taxpayers will get the bill. THANKS A LOT!
@charliekirk11 Article 1 Section 8.
@charliekirk11 Why publicly call for criminal behavior? If you are so concerned vandalize those stars yourself.
@JacobAWohl Private citizens donate hundreds of millions of dollars to PP every year, but you are technically right because most of them also pay taxes.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Legal plunder is socialism.
@realDonaldTrump When the president starts drunk tweeting you know the news is going to be off the hook tomorrow.
@realDonaldTrump If Donald Trump, often referred to by me as a national menace, repeated Kremlin talking points from a prison cell or a mental institution instead of Washington D.C. with his wife dressed in an orange jumpsuit, it would be a smash!
@realDonaldTrump If Donald Trump, often referred to by me as a national menace repeated Kremlin talking points from a prison cell or a mental institution instead of Washington D.C., with his wife dressed in an orange jumpsuit, it would be a smash.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I went through an airport yesterday and TSA was hardly doing anything. First time since 2001 I didn't remove anything and walked through a metal detector. Unpaid border patrol is a gateway for bribery. The US is vulnerable and it is all on your inability to be a leader.
@realDonaldTrump They should wait until you go to prison and have the next person sign the bill so that the signature means something.
@realDonaldTrump If you are not working for Russia you are the stupidest man on the planet.
@realDonaldTrump Farmers get more welfare, border patrol works without a check and the government is not functioning but taxpayers are paying for it anyway. If you wanted to make America great again you should have started two years ago.
@realDonaldTrump COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOOOOOO!
@realDonaldTrump California should cut you off and stop sending welfare to your base in the south.
@realDonaldTrump You told us ISIS was defeated and now we are fighting them. Did the New York Times tell you they were defeated or are you creating your own fake news?
@realDonaldTrump Osama bin Laden was the leader of that attack and he has been dead for years.
@realDonaldTrump Ask Bill Clinton. He will tell you everything.
@realDonaldTrump The story is that you gave many billions of dollars to your rich, criminal friends and now the American people are going to start filling the pot back up every time they go shopping.
@realDonaldTrump Ask Bill Clinton. He presided over a successful budget and the economy was doing great at the time. He had 73% approval among EVERYONE after the impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump Fake news you gullible dotard.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats love how your hate for the military is so transparent.
@realDonaldTrump You couldn't make a deal if your life depended on it. See Mueller investigation for details.
@realDonaldTrump Does he talk about why he wears the Vitezi Rend medal? Is that why he fights?
@IvankaTrump The only way your dad will be happy is if you or his other wife blow him, so please consider if you are sincere. We would love to see happy tweets.

@realDonaldTrump I bought a nice hat in 2013 and I still wear it. That doesn't mean I want to over pay for a stupid hat now.
@realDonaldTrump I agree if somebody wants to build a wall around themselves they should be free to do so without relying on the government.

@realDonaldTrump You should get your party together and vote on it without Democrats.

@IngrahamAngle @FLOTUS Melankala chose to enter porn to bait a rich, gullible American. In Slovenia, that's a good sign.
@FLOTUS Like the decision to enter the porn industry to bait a rich, gullible American? What school did you go to?
@realDonaldTrump Based on the fact that you are super paranoid today and the walls are closing in, you will find another way to communicate with your handler.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS If Christ came back today you would be yelling, "Lock him up!"
@realDonaldTrump You need to start making a lot more sense if you're going to get through this.
@RealJamesWoods That's why everyone voted for Trump so that he would continue to do all of the horrible things Obama did. Nice work, everyone.
@realDonaldTrump You created a hostile environment for business because you are ignorant and too mentally ill to recover. You are tearing this place apart from the inside on every level and disguising it through a list of constant grievances that are never actually addressed.
@realDonaldTrump You are acting desperate. Maybe you have more in common with the caravan than you think. Which way are you going to run? Better hurry before the walls go up.
@realDonaldTrump Did Kim Jung hack your account?
@realDonaldTrump Everyone is aware now that you are not intelligent enough to collude. At the very least though you were duped like a sucker for decades and we can't wait to hear all about it.
@realDonaldTrump Large, violent protests by truck drivers in other countries on the other side of an ocean aren't thinking about the US? Shocking.
@realDonaldTrump Okay. https://t.co/wwpGyQJayM
@realDonaldTrump We are waiting for the check from Mexico to clear.
@realDonaldTrump Except for vets, farmers, journalists, the DOJ, the CIA and anybody who lives in California!
@IvankaTrump Here we see Ivankala tweeting as she prepares for the future. Don't worry, they will probably incarcerate your entire family.
@realDonaldTrump So funny to see that you are an eight year old crybaby in the body of a 72 year old man.
@realDonaldTrump The Republican Party is rudderless and on track to self destruction. Good luck maintaining relevance.
@eScarry The liberals must have looted a Dillards yesterday because they are all wearing clothes today. When will the terror end?
@realDonaldTrump Veterans haven't received GI Bill benefits for months. They need food and shelter. Please stop talking and start doing.

@realDonaldTrump Is everyone sick and tired of hearing about this investigation? Register Republican and vote for Jeff Flake in the primary.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you call Mueller and get the answers instead of crying to the whole world? Everyone thinks it's weird that the ramblings of a POTUS sound like the diary of a ten year old crybaby.
@realDonaldTrump They should drop you on the fire line so you can suck the oxygen out of everything.
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is a national tragedy. Everyone register Republican and vote for Jeff Flake in the primary.
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is a national tragedy. Everyone register Republican and vote for Jeff Flake in the primary.
@realDonaldTrump How can we tell whether or not it's fake news?
@realDonaldTrump You are a horrible human being. Why do you want everyone to know?
@TuckerCarlson Who are these "people" and why are they cowards?
@realDonaldTrump He's coming for your job. Everyone register Republican so you can vote in the primaries.
@realDonaldTrump This tweet vomit suggests you have no understanding or concern for law and order.
@PressSec Are you hiring actors to produce more fake videos or is this the only one you will be releasing?
@realDonaldTrump NBC is fake news, retard. Everyone loves the so-called Mueller Investigation.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC This neat thing called the internet has replaced all that garbage. Nobody over 70 anymore, okay guys. This is getting stupid.
@realDonaldTrump We want names and pictures ASAP. A government that insists there is an enemy among our ranks but refuses to ID said enemy is as dangerous as the enemy.
@pfuchenbutz @PatrickThonies @ladylinda156 @realDonaldTrump @Speech7x7 In the US we have elected representatives instead of rulers.
@realDonaldTrump Nike was thinking "How can we bait the President of the United States into advertising for us?"
@realDonaldTrump Why did you work for them for so long?
@realDonaldTrump Your own staff continually betrays you. How do you know it was Bloomberg?
@realDonaldTrump How can you incorrectly cite polls that are produced by the Fake News Media and then accuse the Fake News media of being incorrect? You have 52% disapproval overall and not one poll has you over 46% approval. You are completely insane.
@realDonaldTrump NO RIGGED - HUNT WITCH COLLUSION!
@realDonaldTrump Revoking security clearances without reason only undermines our national security. A political hack is one whose intentions are more aligned with victory than personal conviction. Do you own a mirror?
@Schatt1_ @Stewcat2006 @SAMDHWV @fredakalina @realDonaldTrump Everyone voted for Trump so that he would do the horrible things that Obama did.
PerfoTech is coming.
@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine The answer to the question that ends with a period is, "no."
@balderdash64 @zackbeauchamp @JamieOGrady Like a sponge bath from his mother?
@realDonaldTrump We are paying you to be the president and you protest 24/7.
@realDonaldTrump Will he build a wall around Kansas?
@realDonaldTrump Our records indicate that you are the dumbest man on television.  For example, you are watching what you say is fake news and then let it trigger you. How god damned dumb can you get?
@realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about it now?
@realDonaldTrump @SecAzar So the prices are the same as they were before? That makes them "lower" then?
@realDonaldTrump Is that where the farmers will work when the tariffs kick in and they have to sell their farms to China and Bayer?
@murphymike @Lawrence They are called concentration camps, @Lawrence.
@realDonaldTrump Is it difficult to have a moral compass when satan's cock is hitting the back of your throat?
@Zack_Szalajeski @tarastrong @mbom2009 @realDonaldTrump That's why everyone voted for Trump - so he would do everything Bush and Obama did.
@realDonaldTrump Why stop providing food, shelter, security, medical care and education in a foreign language to illegal immigrants with our tax money by writing an EO, when we could build more camps and make it an election issue while the camps ultimately grease the hands of GOP donors?
@GreyhoundBus @SixFlags Has @GreyhoundBus offered a statement regarding its passengers' constitutional rights? https://t.co/E8OJZccw8C
@realDonaldTrump No, everyone is still laughing at your North Korean propaganda footage.
@realDonaldTrump Everyone is registering Republican so they can vote in your 2020 primary.
@stach_tiffany @Ms_Apprehension @TUSK81 @IvankaTrump If the premise is true, it indicates Trump acts like Obama even when it's wrong. Why do you still support Trump if this is true?
@realDonaldTrump WTF are you doing in Somalia?
@Red_White__Blue @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Trump's presidency is mostly Trump acting like a butthurt chump on Twitter.
@realDonaldTrump Someday you will be the president and you won't have to worry about these things because you will be so busy.
@realDonaldTrump Not a law and order president today? We realize it's hit and miss when your brain is oatmeal. Maybe tomorrow. PS Are you investigating all the cops or just the cops that you have something against?
@realDonaldTrump Your brain is oatmeal. Where is your cabinet and the 25th amendment? Are their brains oatmeal also?
@realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about it?
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Real American People would DEMAND due process.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump @RepDanDonovan It is a socially acceptable way to make fun of retarded people.
@realDonaldTrump @KimKardashian Next you should meet with Stone Cold Steve Austin to discuss military strategy.
@realDonaldTrump What will we eat, then?
@realDonaldTrump You are running out of time, but you are also horrible at acting innocent.
@realDonaldTrump You act super guilty for being super innocent. Is that a strategy? Most innocent people would remain silent and allow their lawyers to deal with it so they can remain focused on their job and family.
@mollodonn @DavidMDrucker @kellysadler45 @realDonaldTrump @johnmccain2016 It would have been different if it was a joke, but it was instead a disregard for human life and a jab to all veterans and sitting Senators. Fuck what they think, right?
@realDonaldTrump So, what are you going to do?
@ACR_POKER Is Kim Jong mad about his avatar?
@sueincc @shawnxstl @DeplorableMeAZ @GlutenFreeGanja @mldrieling @KellyScaletta @jabuvia @Cherib1965 @AWarner87 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Fox News debunked uranium charges. Trump's DOJ is free to investigate what they want. You go back and forth insisting if one is guilty the other is innocent while we have determined it entirely possible that all of these people could be garbage and none of them will go to jail.
@cheryl574 @Epluribusunimus @michmains @vsopatrick @stripnotary @BookofJonah @realDonaldTrump It is possible to both detest religion and desire a totalitarian government at the same time.
@IsaacR____ @stegman_candy @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/cjM3gIajcK
@realDonaldTrump Please stop complaining and do the god damned job you applied for.
Perfotech is coming.
@realDonaldTrump You have given us nothing but words. Four hundred is greater than zero.
@realDonaldTrump Nice to see you are supporting the rule of law today. Tomorrow you will talk about how cops are crooked and investigations are witch hunts. If it weren't such a socialistic idea, we'd suggest you share your drugs with the rest of us.
@KarenRob77 @ladiebug7575 @realDonaldTrump We at PerfoTech are not liberal but Trump's political philosophy is not conservative. People who subscribe to conservative political philosophy do not like Trump. Please do not blame only liberals for hating on your cult.
@wiley_x_041 @JulianSvendsen @CONNORFORTRUMP @realDonaldTrump Conservatives censored themselves by throwing away conservatism. So now you're both jokes.
@realDonaldTrump Postal Service gets zero dollars in tax funding. If USPS increases their rates, costs will be passed onto the consumer. Also, the price USPS charges Amazon is not Amazon's fault.  We hate that you are retarded but we would hate you if you weren't.
@realDonaldTrump That's because the election is over and they are talking now about how you are retarded.
@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson It is all irrelevant. Less than a few million people watch those channels. Human beings have the internet. @EricTrump lives in the past when this meant something and he is therefore also irrelevant.
@realDonaldTrump Nobody is legally forced to watch TV. This is America.
@nosfleursdumal @AndrewTait67 @jakk_d0e @SonOfGodAndMan @CaseyMcgregor @B_QUICK_1 @liammaclo @Capetown_Eagle @realDonaldTrump The president has declared a trade war earlier. Either tell him he is wrong or accept that our leader has declared a trade war.
@realDonaldTrump He will need tremendous courage and grit when the American justice system throws him in a cage.
@realDonaldTrump Who in their right mind tweets likes this? You hate when people protest the police but do it constantly in front of god and country with misspelled word salads. You are an American disgrace. Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump Congress can use reconciliation once per fiscal year on budget issues. You suck at this game. Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump You are either extremely retarded or working for somebody else. Please choose an option.
@realDonaldTrump "If you can't make a deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you" - Donald J. Trump, 2016
@realDonaldTrump "I know how to negotiate, believe me. That will never happen if I win." Donald J. Trump, 2016
@realDonaldTrump "If the government shuts down you must blame Obama because ultimately the president is responsible." - Donald J. Trump, 2013
@realDonaldTrump Please learn how the government works. Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump Russia Collusion Hoax is dead, except you bring it up all the time, and it's an active investigation involving everyone around you. If fake news disappeared these two facts would remain facts. Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump Please remain calm. Help is on the way. #perfotech
@realDonaldTrump Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
@realDonaldTrump It would be the biggest story on Earth because his entire administration was not being investigated by the police. There are bigger stories now.
PerfoTech is coming.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfrlends Please remain calm. Help is on the way.
PerfoTech is coming.
PerfoTech is coming.
