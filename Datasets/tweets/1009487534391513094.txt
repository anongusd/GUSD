I'll say it again, but perhaps to some more individuals. @AOC @DNC @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @BernieSanders - Sirs and madames, can we start the trend of speaking truth to power. I believe its imperative in these times that we speak out. We all have to speak #truthtopower now.
We need to do more than raise the wage. We need a new, "New Deal". What we need is security and peace of mind for millions in poverty. The American Dream is on life support. Brought to you by corporate money, lobbyists and poltical pawns. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/DVcAMgJ7OR
After the failure that was the administration's responce to Hurricane Maria, they suggest this. It goes to show who they care about. They'd rather appease a nationalistic base, than keep funding secure for at risk communities. Sickening. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/S2U9bMHNhg
Adjusted for inflation and the rising cost of living,  minimum wage should be closer to $20/hr and whoever says the corporations cannot afford this - ARE LYING. Small mom and pop shops should not be issuing this wage. But Walmart can. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/o6s6Lss6BI
Absolutely maddening! These aren't just "federal workers" - these are mothers and fathers, individuals with rent payments over due, struggling folks who have overdue student loan payments. This is not funny, and it should outrage everyone. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/SayQKeVFZC
We all have to speak #truthtopower now. It is our responsibility as citizens of the world to hold everyone to account on their blatant lies. Humanity is quite literally at stake. I cannot stress enough, we all MUST speak #truthtopower now.
Brexit is to the benefit of the autocratic regime of the Russian government. The U.K should stay within the European Union because if they leave - NATO will be degraded, and the European Union will be degraded all to the benefit of Russia. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/imkO02Gk5c
When we fundraise off the misery of hundreds of thousands, to rally a base wildly out of step with the mainstream of American society. When the backwards views of the last century are now becoming policy in the 21st century. Madness. We all have to speak #truthtopower now.
When a federal worker, works for over sixty hours and goes without pay, as a baby is on the way and our politicans just sit and talk and smugly smile. When young migrant children are dying in cages and people only care to talk about the latest gossip on television. #truthtopower
@AOC @DNC Can we please get #truthtopower trending? People all over this country need to start speaking the truth that they see daily. Whether it be police brutality, or the experiances of federal workers going without pay - any inequities in our society that we are sick of.
This country astounds me. We have a govt. shutdown with 800,00 federal workers going without pay, the possibility of food stamps for 34 million Americans running out and both parties do nothing. Both parties do not represent the people. We all have to speak #truthtopower now.
Yet you do nothing and block investigations and cover for a man who is under high suspicion of directly or indirectly being a tool of the Russian government to undermine the interests of the United States.  You sir, are the true mockery. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/lOpUCNK3A2
You obstructed the 44th President of this country for eight years and are attempting to undo his legacy to this day. You sir, are a vile lackey for corporate interests. Beholden not to the American people but to those who cut your check - We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/Y0yyxGhCUT
Lies. The International Far Right is a threat, a total threat, to all decency that exists in the world. They pose the greatest risk to our democratic ideals we hold close, and they must be stopped. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/86m9FDAXVI
And it's not up to me, as a humble citizen of the United States, to lecture the Brits on what to do either - but I am in total agreement with @guyverhofstadt, put politics aside and get something done for average citizens of a great nation. We all have to speak #truthtopower now. https://t.co/45wEPJPy4f

#Vote and tell all your friends and family to vote.
Get out and vote. This is a sacred right. Overseas people wage costly wars for the right to free and open elections. So #GoVote .
#VoteToday.
Not everyone in our international community is afforded this sacred right. So, please - please. #Vote!
Everyone should #govote today, find time - bring your friends. Bring your family. No matter your political persuasions, today is #ElectionDay. So go and #vote!
The Democrats should then if they retake the house, and perhaps the Senate - and there is a great "if" there - introduce legislation on comprehensive immigration reform and tackle the issues of great poverty, crime and desperation south of our border and put this debate to rest. https://t.co/NLAd5kNzbX
We may have a great many differences. But always, without avail, if we look deep and hard enough we can see the light of that which binds and unites us shines brighter than any force that would seek to divide us. Our common American ideals ring true, we need only let them. #Vote.
This is a sacred right we as Americans share. We shouldn't waste it, and we should not shrug off the responsibilities entrusted to us.
No matter your party, no matter your political allegiances, no matter your ideological standing it is paramount that you get out and #vote.
The upcoming general election is on of the more important in our time. Certainly in my own time, come November the people of the United States will face a referendum on the presidency of Donald J. Trump.
Just voted - it is imperative all registered for either major party, or the smaller third parties vote today to have a say in who you believe should represent your party in the upcoming general.
