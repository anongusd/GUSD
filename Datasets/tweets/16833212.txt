@WalshFreedom @TimothyODonnel2 I'm not fine with any declaration of emergency that is not an actual emergency.  Examples of true emergencies.  9/11, Katrina, Houston floods, CA wildfires, Hurricane in Puerto Rico.  You know where many Americans are affected and in true danger.

@Green_Footballs I attended CPAC once at the invitation of Andrew Breitbart in 09. I'm a ppl watcher &amp; I observed 100s of people wandering around waiting to be told what to think. It was eye opening. Those people refused to question anything or think for themselves. I took a step back after that.

@_NIKD_ @Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS And independents will run more serious candidates when the voters stop embracing they will lose anyway mindset.   I honestly understand your perspective but please consider what I am saying.   And thank you for a civil constructive conversation.
@Aimee_Abq @_NIKD_ @RF_P0TUS BUT why is there big money in only two parties? Because we have been trained to support the two parties even when it is not what is best for this nation and us.  Truly I understand what you are saying but things have to change and it starts with mindset.
@_NIKD_ @Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS Sigh..  and whom has controlled politics for the last couple of centuries in this nation?   The Democrats and Republicans. So yes it's based on your knowledge which is based on generations of being trained to stick to the parties.
@_NIKD_ @Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS Because the political parties tell us that is how it is suppose to work.  NO WHERE in the constitution are parties mentioned. I 100% get what you are saying but I also see how trained this nation has become to think  only D or R when they vote.

@RF_P0TUS I completely understand but I am also saying if it appears that enough people are finally fed up and are backing a good person who is independent we need to stop denouncing 3rd party as a certain fail. Anything is possible so do not write it off completely.
@_NIKD_ @Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS I've been hearing that for 30 yrs.
@Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS Not saying I am going to vote independent just saying consider the possibility that we do not have to toe a party line.
@Aimee_Abq @RF_P0TUS Well it's not which is a proven fact.... but an independent candidate might actually be the best option and most popular  but too many simply write them off because they are trained to follow one party or another.  Step out of the box they have us in.

@RF_P0TUS What if... the best candidate and the most popular candidate happens to run independent and we the people can piss on both parties????

@texasps @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends highly-misleading number that reflects all votes cast from 1996-2016, or 10 different elections.That means the number is 5,800 or so (not 58,000).	Also 50,000 Texans become naturalized every year and it‚Äôs unclear if these NEW citizens were simply casting votes LEGALLY.
Ok the next Presidential election is over a year away. We don't even know all our options yet. Stop fighting over and tearing down candidates. Sit back and watch them, research them and see what they have to offer then respond instead of reacting.

@flatspaddler1 No one is saying to not give the speech they are suggesting that it be given from a place that doesn't impose additional security risks at a time that security is NOT being paid.
@flatspaddler1 Well that's deceptive. Speaker Pelosi simply stated that with the shutdown, security for a Joint House meeting would be difficult and that Trump should give the speech from the Oval office. Trumps shutdown means Secret Service and other security are NOT getting paid.
@seanspicer @beachkatie @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS She asked for the State of the Union to be delayed, that is not revoking his invitation.  It's actually a move that would most likely benefit Trump since the state of the union is piss poor at the moment.

@Buddha23Fett @SenFeinstein Actually I had kids in school in the 90s and 2000s and they never went through active shooter drills.

@charliekirk11 From Jan. 14th 2018, Mr. Trump: "The other thing‚Ä¶so the wall. The wall‚Äôs never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas..."  We have walls where they were needed. Trump said so.

@Robin32459 @racingdanger @DanielTurnerPTF @Paydirt50 Ok how am I bearing false witness? I can't find any media coverage that insults Melaina Trumps boots and I stated boots were probably better than heels for the location.  What do you call false?
@racingdanger @Robin32459 @DanielTurnerPTF @Paydirt50 *bearing*  false witness.  The 9th Commandment. That Bearing false witness. Lots of people forget that rule which is why I research things..... a lot.
@davidmweissman Here's the problem with support them no matter what... that got us Trump. We don't need another one of him with a D behind his name.   We ALL  need to be more active in the primaries so we get a candidate that is worthy of voting for!
@DanielleFudge It's your friendly welcoming smile. ;)
Thank you.. the American public did need to hear what is truly happening.
@GoboMontaco @Dianykinns @POTUS @MrWyattEarpLA @QmagaMike @BPPope @VP Also most illegals fly into the US and over stay their VISAs.  Thank you for playing,I hope you learned something.
@GoboMontaco @Dianykinns @POTUS @MrWyattEarpLA @QmagaMike @BPPope @VP Actually a wall would do a great deal of damage to the environment and would cost individuals their land.  Walls throughout history have been proven to be unsuccessful in actually stopping people from getting to where they want to go.
@GoboMontaco @Dianykinns @POTUS @MrWyattEarpLA @QmagaMike @BPPope @VP And illegal immigration has steadily declined since 2008 withOUT  wall.  Even Trump admits the Border Patrol are doing their job very well.
@IamPolly2 @DanielTurnerPTF @Paydirt50 Honestly I don't care about her shoes. Not even sure why anyone else is. But for the record, heels in a combat zone would not have been a good idea. Boots were a good choice.
@DanielTurnerPTF @Paydirt50 I have looked and looked for where her boots were complained about by the media... all I can find is a mention of them and that wasn't derogatory, but simply because they were mentioned the rightwing has gone into overreaction mode.
@votevets I just noticed the Checkerboard Vans bag.. and I love this picture even more.  Long story but let's just say that is like a stamp of approval from the other side of the veil.

@kashanacauley @Mikel_Jollett Actually 8 children have died that we know of.  Only two made headlines.

@cvpayne @AP Ms. Payton's death is sad, as is anyone dying so young. But do not act like conservatives have not behaved as badly when their were deaths in the liberal community. Neither side has behaved well.  It's the new American way in this New divided United States (pun intended)
@thejimjams No Liberals hate the military being used as political props by the rightwing conservatives. So please stop doing it.
@freedom_moates How many people upset over this tweet are just as upset that a child died at the border?
@realDonaldTrump @GarCasey Currently Republicans (your party) control both the House &amp; Senate &amp; have enough votes to pass your stupid budget for a stupid wall but they haven't because it's STUPID!  Even you admitted Border Patrol is doing it's job. Hell illegal immigration has steadily dropped since 2004.
@Amy_Siskind Round two of oh poor me I currently have  Republican control of Congress and still can't get my way.
@tonyposnanski So you are saying Trump will replace her.
@jzmurdock I understand what you're saying and agree.  So my question is does religion create the crossing of those wires?  Does it create roles that make men abuse women and women accept such abuse?  With more awareness of these abuses being unacceptable is that why religion is declining?
@markjuelich So sad when so one so young dies. My heart hurts for her family and friends.
@jzmurdock Not all men I agree.. in fact not even most but religion is designed to protect the weak and condemn and control the strong. Weak men treat women badly.
@jzmurdock Religion (yes all of them) has always blamed and made women responsible for men being weak and immoral.

@bacon_texas The truth is no one really wants a fence.   Immigrants are too important to our economy.
@ReaganWorld It is a very well done series.  I also suggest visiting Gainesville TX in the spring when the MOH guys gather.  Sitting and talking with them is amazing. I was so lucky to get to sit with  Lt. John Finn when we still had him with us and have him tell me stories. Simply Surreal!!

@Joanne5617 @GOPPollAnalyst @joethepatriotic @BillyBobBobo1 @Alyssa_Milano You are vile.  I suggest you try reading for content.
@GOPPollAnalyst So maybe you see why I am more upset about the death of a child than most and my concern is less about the politics of it and more about the child.  That poor child and the parents grief should never be minimized or lost in the debate.
@hellion2172 @GOPPollAnalyst @joethepatriotic @Alyssa_Milano And I was appalled and saddened by those deaths also.
@GOPPollAnalyst @joethepatriotic @BillyBobBobo1 @Alyssa_Milano My statement was a general statement but if you want to lace up those shoes and dance be my guest.
@Ritchfive @GOPPollAnalyst @joethepatriotic @Alyssa_Milano I am not blaming anyone I am still processing that a child died and so many people are so cold about it.

@ifilmbands @votevets But today military support is fashionable. It's all bumper stickers and show. There is very little actual support.
@ifilmbands @votevets And I disagree with you statement that respect for the military has risen since Vietnam.   It is all show these days... it's all  "look at how much we care" but ask them what a Gold Star family is or to donate to help a Veteran....  they become completely tongue tied.
@ifilmbands @votevets You missed my point... it's terrible that the President had no respect for the military and no concept of what they do. It's HORRIFIC that he mirrors the majority of the US population (even those who didn't vote for him)

@AnOpenSecret It's not illegal in all states.  You can drink with your minor child in some states. That said it was a Drag COMEDY  show...  did you bother to even watch it or did you instantly get horny and make it sexual?
@DNBGal @AnOpenSecret @desmondisamazin It's a drag comedy show.   Have you even bothered to watch it? It's not sexual except for perverts like YOU!!!
@BtterThanDayman @AnOpenSecret @desmondisamazin He never stripped! Stop making shit up. He performed which is what he enjoys and gets paid to do.  Just like any other child actor.
@matthewevan71 @AnOpenSecret @desmondisamazin You let your kids go to church and there s a lot more abuse and grooming going on there than a performance where a kid is getting paid to do what he loves doing.

@RussianBot617 @brhodes Sadly his attitude towards the military reflects a larger segment of our society than most want to admit.
@GlennKesslerWP Trump has yet to realize that as President he has many rules he must abide by and people he answers to.  Of course many Americans don't understand this fact about the Presidency.
@realDonaldTrump Let me see if I can explain it to you... Special Counsel (&lt;-- Note spelling) does not have to be approved by the Senate.  However  the AG does need to be approved.. even if they are just the Acting AG.  As President you have rules you MUST follow.  You answer to many others.

@BeccaGramby @ProfMJCleveland Who cares how long?
@BarbEpple @ProfMJCleveland And Trump was trying to intimdate @Acosta from doing his job.  Are you more concerned about intimidating a intern who keeps looks at her leader like Squeaky Frum look at Charlie or the intimidation of the Free Press?
@PhilippeReines @cliffritter101 @NancyPelosi Actually I think that appointing as Speaker  @BarackObama ( because the Speaker does not need to be an elected official  per the Constitution) would make heads spin and add a element of hope and dignity to the the House and Nation.
@stevesilberman After this the media/press need to all just stop covering WH press conferences. Daily and otherwise.  There are other ways to get to the news.

@JammieWF @PressSec NO!   Truth is truth. She is out and out lying and there is video of the incident.  Stop being calm and start calling out the lies.  I can handle different  views but lies are lies and I refuse to stand by and allow the freedom of  anything or one be taken via lies!
@PressSec Seriously please stop calling yourself a Christian.  You lie for a living to protect a man who treats others horribly.  How do you face your children?  You traded "success" for morality?  But then your daddy is worse so I know where you get it from.
@PressSec You do understand there is video of this incident and you are lying?  Trump lost his shit because he got asked a tough question that proved he is a lying ass who uses race and fear.

@DaddyDaddymac Trump is more like a dildo, AKA a fake dick.
@TomFitton @beachkatie @realDonaldTrump Article II, Section 3 states, that the Pres. ‚Äúshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.‚Äù Nothing in that Clause gives the Pres. an ‚Äúabsolute right‚Äù to control specific enforcement matters at DOJ.

@Arizona_momma @realDonaldTrump @Tex8Down @dougducey So you missed the  coverage Mass murder in Pittsburgh last week?
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey I say due process which is outlined by law  for asylum seekers.
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey So you don't think the law should be followed.
@ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump People slow down to watch wrecks.. human nature.
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey So what would you say should happen to these people in the caravan?
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey You prejudged those seeking asylum....  how does it feel?
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey Did I say that???? NO I did not!!   I do believe I said they deserved to go through the process in a legitimate manner.
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey The majority of those in the caravan are women, child and business owners who have been threatened by  gangs and cartels in their nations.  Good people just wanting hope for their families. Facts... if you care to actually  seek them. But they are brown so you probably prejudged.
@Arizona_momma @realDonaldTrump @Tex8Down @dougducey BTW I have been a register republican for 33 yrs.  and will still not support anyone who supports trump.
@Arizona_momma @realDonaldTrump @Tex8Down @dougducey Honestly don't know who is running in AZ. But if they support Trump and his hate.. nope!
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey Actually the law is write that  ports of entry hold no criminal repercussions ( although trump ignored that law) and other entry is a misdemeanor ( equal to jay walking). Again.. facts are pesky things.
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey I see facts are not your first choice of information.
@ralphreed  Got a pre recorded call from you tonight.  Questions. Do you actually practice the bible or do you just use it to justify hate?  Curious also why I receive a call after your office hours? Do I not deserve family time uninterrupted like your staff?
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey And when and if the caravan gets to the border process them through the system as it dictates by LAW for asylum seekers.
@Tex8Down @realDonaldTrump @dougducey I propose letting Border patrol do their job and let our Military be home with their families after 16 yrs of combat in other nations since the military is legally very limited on what they can do.  Also maybe wait till the caravan actually  gets closer than a 1000 miles away.
@JammieWF I love my brother but I once throw a whole coke on him for being a jerk.
@realDonaldTrump @Tex8Down @dougducey How about u show our military some respect and not send them to the border to be the logistic guys  over a group of asylum seekers due here in 2 months.  Let those men and women be home with their families for thanksgiving. Not out playing president's prop for photo ops. #VOTEDEM
@madriannorman @Bitter_Grizzly I call bullshit.
@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends You just described Trump's GOP.

Why are we sending nearly twice as many troops to the Border for immigrants seeking asylum that are still 2 months away than we have in Afghanistan that is an actual combat zone?

@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 I never said too soon.  Like I stated before I have lived this nightmare.  Just do not speak for the dead unless you actually knew them.  They are not public property simply because they were murdered.
@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 What happened in Pittsburgh is horrific and wrong.  But I did not know those who died. What I do know is we live in a time that racism and bigotry has been enabled. I also know I don't need the deaths of others to condemn that.
@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 No I am saying you can speak of the atrocity without speaking for the dead.  You didn't know them so how do you know what their thoughts would be?  State YOUR opinion without interjecting what you think those who have died may or may not have thought or lived.
@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 Comes down to this.  When a person is murdered they do not become public property.
@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 I know you don't see that you are being disrespectful. If I thought you were doing it intentionally I would have already gone off in a completely different manner.  Sigh..  I understand you do not even comprehend what you are doing and it makes my heart hurt for the families.
@markjenkinson @Nicoxw1 And now you have made them political props which dehumanizes them.  Please just stop.  I get your meaning but I have lived this nightmare.  Unless you knew the victim personally  please just send your condolences. Don't try to speak for them.  Just don't.

@paulkrugman Not even congress can override the US Constitution. More grandstanding shiny bullshit to make the basest of the right wing base stick around.

@DLWilsonsWorld @dbeldr @tedcruz Obamacare was national insurance not universal medical coverage. With Universal coverage you would not have to pay for care out of pocket because it would already be paid for and it would cost MILLIONS less than the crap going on now.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld Just because you call something socialism doesn't mean it is. And no one is calling for socialism here  we are asking for a better way. Socializing medicine, like we do police and fire protection and schools, would save money and lives. Period.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld The insurance company is literally waiting for her to die so they don't have to pay. She's been paying premiums for 15 yrs but they won't cover her heart surgery.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld Venezuela lives under a dictatorship not socialism. Wait times in nation with national medicine depends on need. I have a co-worker waiting on life saving heart surgery right now because the Insurance company refuses to cover it.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld Complete nationalization of all health related industries and reform of the malpractice system would save at least $87.2 billion per year.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld A national health service would save $65.8 billion: $38.4 billion on health administration and insurance overhead, $4.9 billion on profits, $3.9 billion on marketing, and $18.6 billion on physician's incomes.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld national health insurance would save $42.6 billion annually: $29.2 billion on health administration and insurance overhead, $4.9 billion on profits, $3.9 billion on marketing, and $4.6 billion on physician's incomes.
@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld That has been proven false. Do a little research beyond twitter and facebook. Try reading actual economic facts from actual economist.
@DLWilsonsWorld @dbeldr @tedcruz Exactly... which is a form of socialism. When everyone chips in for the good of everyone.

@dbeldr @tedcruz @DLWilsonsWorld Oh and you are wrong on socialized medicine.  When people have to have resort to gofundme to supplement insurance to  get medical treatment that is a nation where people die. Not one that actually provides medical care.

@MelissaTweets And if you were a victim of sexual assault I am sorry you had to suffer that... but why would you attack another victim  over politics?  What could Dr. Ford possibly gain from coming forward?  Death threats?  Not a likely motive.
@MelissaTweets The democrats have supported a full FBI Investigation. Same as Anita Hill got.  How else would you like the  accusation handled?
@MelissaTweets I'm going to assume you have never been a victim of sexual assault; otherwise you would understand how horribly wrong you comments are.  Sometimes it takes years to find the confidence to speak about what has happened to you.

@MelissaTweets @tedcruz You do understand that Cruz has received 8% of donations from California/ Hollywood.  Equivalent to the amount  Beto has... same with New York donations.  So again why do you support him?

@tedcruz  Stop using my son in your  political ads. You didn't know him so you don't know if he would support the take a knee protest or not. You do not get to speak for him or any other Fallen. (Spc. Micheal E. Phillips KIA 24 Feb 08)

@Southern_Yang @Pink_About_it The Gold Star card doesn't work on me. I have one too. And my son fought and died to defend freedom and equality. So if someone is protesting in a peaceful respectful manner to bring light to a group that are not receiving freedom and equality I defend that protest.

@gregcool1 @TIMENOUT Perhaps? Seriously you think that makes what Trump said better?   Just admit you hate the military. It would be easier to understand why you would remotely defend this crap.
@gregcool1 @TIMENOUT As for the Gold Star father he has every right to speak out about how his son was being attacked for his religion when his son had fought and died for this nation so again trump is the one who started it by stating no Muslims could honorably serve this nation!!
@gregcool1 @TIMENOUT That is NOT what trump said. Here is the actual quote ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a war hero,‚Äù said Trump. ‚ÄúHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren‚Äôt captured.‚Äù ~ Trump
@ReaganWorld I personally think the slogan is spot on.  We should all be willing to sacrifice for what is right.
@gregb94 @BenHowe I remember when mudslinging political ads were seen as a sign of weakness and lack of qualification.
@gregb94 @BenHowe It's become win at all cost not matter whom or what is destroyed in the process.  I remember when sports didn't have a mercy rule, if you gain so much of a lead you simply maintained it without trying to humiliate the other team. now it's don't stop until the other guy is ruined
@valor4us I honestly believe gun violence is less abt gun ownership &amp; more abt the fact people today can't be good losers. WE have become a nation of win at all cost no matter whom you destroy in the process.  Don't get a date with someone? Shoot them. Don't make the team? Shoot them.

@forewit @ISPVersailles I understand that... BUT  the left  lane should be for those going the posted speed limit and passing those who are going below the speed limit int he right lane.

@sadnky @ISPVersailles If they are going over the posted speed limit they are the ones braking the law.  How hard is that to understand?

@jimycrakorn @ISPVersailles Who's Angie??
@jimycrakorn @ISPVersailles But if you are passing above the speed limit you are breaking the law.  Thus my  statement.  I spent time in Indiana.. I know you inbreeds can't drive for shit.  And following the law is not in your mental capacity.
@ISPVersailles If the vehicle was going below the speed limit.. good for you. At or above...you should have waited and ticketed everyone who sped up above the speed limit and passed.

@sevenlayercake What kind of sick being makes suicide about politics?
@itsonlywords Sadly these days being right ( whether they are or not) is more important than considering other POVs or getting along. Sigh. Vicious is in fashion and it's sad.
@itsonlywords Not saying YOU do but it happens more than it should.  A person's beliefs are personal. It belongs to the individual.  No one should try to stop a person from holding their beliefs BUT  nor should others be expected to cater to the individual's beliefs.

@VargasMcPherson @JoeTalkShow @DaggettBeaver @Big_Hunt98 You just admitted you did it.  Who are you to speak?
@CrockettLives @mitchellvii @ptco911 Emma was wearing the Cuban flag.. it's been the Cuban flag since 1902 Cuba has been Communist since the 1950s.  Her wearing the Cuba flag is no different than t you flag your Confederate flag. Heritage and stuff. The raised fist is a Human rights gesture. Do your research.
@VargasMcPherson @JoeTalkShow @DaggettBeaver @Big_Hunt98 BTW I have purchased guns at gun shows... I had to stand wait for my background to come back.  If you are purchasing guns from trunks of cars you are a criminal and should be jailed.

@SaintRPh That has been the Cuban flag since 1902 . Cuba became a communist state in the 1950s. How is it any different than those  honoring your heritage than those who wave the Confederate flag or Hyphen their identity?
@SACoughlin1993 @tcotlatino That has been the flag of Cuba since 1902.. Cuba became a communist state in the 1950s. So she honors her heritage. Big deal!  Not unlike people who sport the   Confederate flag or use hyphened identity.  IE:  African - American Irish-American

@ptco911 @mitchellvii I have already stated we do not have to agree with what they are saying but at what age do they get to be heard?  17? 18? 19?  What age? Come on it's not a hard question. Why are you afraid to answer it?
@_Makada_ @LWLBrentwood That has been the Cuban flag since 1902. Cuba became a communist state in the 50s.  So she honors her heritage. Do you call yourself an African- American?  Same difference.
@ptco911 @mitchellvii So Soros  is behind the skyrocketing  gun sales and NRA memberships?    But again the question I asked has not been answered.
@mitchellvii @ptco911 Bill, I'm seriously asking.. at what age do they get to be listened to? 17? 18? 19?  Not saying we should do what they say but at what age do are they old enough to listened to?
