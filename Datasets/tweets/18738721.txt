Lots of talk about who wasn't there today. Negative fallout from the Iowa Press Conference. Check out this one from  HAWKEYENATION.COM
White calls it 'a slap in the face,' as BH Gaming denies Honor Flight $ request, Courier reports in today's edition.  http://bit.ly/dJOB31
As expected, the now-13 hospitalized players  have received intensive IV fluid intake.
Paul Federici hints, but hasn't said it out loud--the workouts this time of year are often tougher than during the regular practice season
Mr. Poggi says the players want to get out of the hospital and return to workouts as soon as possible--other players have been visiting.
Mr. Poggi says he's spoken to Coach Ferentz 4 or 5 times. Says his son had hard workouts--Monday's was a mainly lower body leg workout
Freshman linebacker, Jim Poggi's Dad is now speaking--says he son is doing well and getting fantastic care at UIHC
Director of Iowa Football Operations, Paul Federici, talking about Iowa hawkeye rules on use of supplements by players.
Iowa Press Conference 'Live" right now  on  kwwl.com   13-players now hospitalized---
@kvnrbnsn  TV coverage on main channel---kwwl.com Home Page will also carry  and run entire Press Conference, even if nothing new comes out
KWWL-TV to provide 'live' coverage of the 3:30 Iowa Press Conference. If nothing new comes out, we'll go back to regular programming
Just speculation, but one doctor tells me it's possible the Hawkeyes players could even have undergone kidney dialysis as a precaution.
Would be interested to know if any of the players felt a strange, achy feeling in their kidneys. You aren't sure what it is the 1st time.
Sounds like players are recovering from a muscle fiber breakdown called Rhabdomyolysis-lack of fluids 7 overexertion-Quick hydration needed
Hawkeye players likely undergoing aggressive fluid (IV) hydration which will also flush the kidneys to help prevent kidney damage
University says the Hawkeye players are responding well to the treatments--likely being fully re-hydrated while still in the hospital.
I have kidney stones now and then and know what can happen when you don't drink enough fluids during tough workouts.
Now hearing the Hawkeye illnesses may be related kidney problems from strenuous workouts.
Blue Man Group ticket holders being told to keep their original tickets for use later.
GBPAC says it's working to find new dates for Blue Man Group performances sometime in the future, but nothing set in stone yet.
Bummer---Gallagher Bluedorn cancels all three Blue Man Group performances this week, due to the burst sprinkler head on the stage.
Again, my wife is right and also reminds me (as did my son) the law is HIPAA, not HIPPA--Health insurance Portability & Accountability Act
My medical professional wife just reminded me HIPPA is the 'law'--that the University is not 'using'  it  as an excuse  in no names release
Players could give permission for public release of their names and conditions.
University uses HIPPA-Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act--University 'can't' legally release names if they are in hospital.
University is investigating to find a 'common thread' in the players' illness, says KWWL Sports Reporter, Mark Woodley.
University won't say why the 12 Hawkeye football players were sent to the hospital for treatment. My guess would be food poisoning or CO.

@PaulYeager  Sorry Paul--would like to assist, but, I am fresh out of Fran photos.
Family members confirm to KWWL-TV Dr. Mike Welton and friend Roswitha Marold are the 2 victims of Colo. plane crash in Dr. Welton's plane
Well known Dr. Welton made frequent trips to Arizona with close friend of recent years, Roswitha Marold; former owner of The Victoria Room.
Positive identification of 2 bodies inside Dr. Welton's plane not expected until tomorrow, say Colorado search authorities--No survivors.
Dr. Welton's plane located--two people on board--NO survivors...names not made public yet. Missing in bad weather in Colorado mountains.
Dr. Mike Welton's family headed to Colorado, says his office. No official word on Dr. Welton's fate. One passenger believed on board plane.
Still no word if Dr. Welton was piloting his plane-now missing in Colorado--he did make an emergency landing west of CF in 2009 we covered
Update: Plane registered to Waterloo Dr. Mike Welton missing in Colo mountains--No names yet on the pilot or passengers--bad weather Sunday
Airplane registered to well known Waterloo Urologist, Dr. Mike Welton, is missing in Colorado mountains. No word on whose is on board.

Bottom line from Press Conference:  No other Hawkeye players involved in DJK  situation. All other players will make the trip to Tempe
Barta says Iowa spends $ 70,000 a year just on drug testing--Press Conference has ended.
Barta says there are some areas we need to tighten up.  Players must lie 'on campus' only one year.
Ferentz says there is 'clearly' a reason for the DJK arrest. Doesn't know of any other players who knew  DJK may have been using drugs
Barta again expresses the mis-information being circulated on social networks.
Parents have called coaches --Ferentz says he doesn't like reporters calling parents.
Ferentz again says DJK arrest should not be lumped in with anything else going--He expects all other players to make bowl trip.
Coach tells Bob Brooks the team practiced four times over the weekend.  Team talked about the DJK situation at the first practice .
Coach is always pretty low-key, but seems to me to be particularly tired or worn down today. Who wouldn't be?
Ferentz says be careful not to 'lump' everything together when talking about Hampton, Robinson, DJK, etc.
Bartz says UI  campus drug testing focuses on marijuana, alcohol and enhancement drugs.
We are not going to turn our heads in this-Ferentz says.  IC Police let Ferentz know about the DJK arrest.
All you have to do is being on the team and you're a celebrity--Ferentz referring to attention  his athletes get
Drugs are part of our culture, Ferentz admits---we have been very pro-active--
Coach Ferentz praising other Seniors --Barta says Iowa's GSR=Graduation Success Rate of all Bowl teams is 12th in nation
Ferentz says he had no idea DJK might have been using or might have a drug problem.
Ferentz says when you win 11 games, everything's fine---when you win 7, there is a whole new level of scrutiny.
Ferentz says the program does not do background checks on player room mates, girl friends, etc..but will consider it.
Barta says they have not 'caught' anyone trying to get around a drug test.  "We have to tighten up," Bartz says.
At this point, no other Hawkeye players are involved or implicated in DJK investigation.
Barta says an athlete's refusal to take a drug test is viewed as a positive drug test. That's kind of like Iowa's 'implied consent' rule.
Bartz says there have been drug tests since the DJK arrest. Ferentz says 10 athletes were taking a drug test when DJK was being arrested.
Bartz & Ferentz news conference is being live streamed now on kwwl.com
Barta admits there are some flaws and inconsistencies in the drug testing which enables athletes to 'get around' the drug testing.
Barta says the University chooses to do drug testing. It is not mandated.
Athletic Director Gary Barta says Dr. Del Miller has been hired and is working with Hawkeye athletes--there is Big 10 and national testing.
Ferentz says 92 athletes have undergone drug testing this season.
Ferentz says Iowa is pro-active when it comes to drug testing, More so this season, he says.
Coach Ferentz calls Robinson situation a suspension. Press Conference underway--talking about behaviors.
Waterloo School Board unanimously passed revised dress code. Details on the KWWL-TV News at 10.
Iowa A-D Gary Barta will join Coach Ferentz @ Tues 10:00 News Conf. Straight talk or sugar coat. Time for some real answers, I'd say.
Ferentz holds 10:00 AM Press Conference Tuesday. Might be asked about rumored failed drug tests to NFL agents on campus-Who knows.
Coach Ferentz confirms Adam Robinson will not play in Iowa bowl game due to team policy violations-Hampton gets release as expected
I really don't care for rumors posted on message boards, but students who know Hawkeye players often get fairly reliable info
Look for Coach Ferentz to hold Press Conference Tuesday morning. Likely not a bowl-related discussion-but hopefully to calm the rumor mill
Still not exactly sure what to expect amid all the rumors, but look for an announcement from the Iowa Athletic Dept within the hour likely
Still waiting on some kind of new announcement out of the Hawkeye Athletic Office. Lots of interesting rumors out there right now.

Great honor for Robert Smith-former Hawkeye wide receiver has been selected as the Back Judge for BCS Title game Jan 10-Oregon vs Auburn
I suspect prosecutors are going after even bigger drug fish, and will try to get DJK to 'roll over' in exchange for some kind of deal.
Sealed search warrant return tells me the DJK drug investigation is far from over--will be interesting to see where it leads--and to whom.
In watching DJK court video, I conclude the costliness of his situation has yet to hit him-like in signing bonus money down the drain?
If DJK lived in a 'drug house,' as the IC charges indicate, you have to wonder how many other people knew about it & frequented the place
DJK makes no comment as he leaves Johnson County courthouse. Video on KWWL-TV Homepage  http://www.kwwl.com/
Derrell Johnson-Koulianos posts bail following arrest on drug charges. Expected to make initial court appearance Wednesday morning.
D-J-K expected to make initial court appearance in Johnson County Wednesday morning. Police had search warrant for D-J-K's residence.
Amazing development--D-J-K, Iowa's all-time leading pass receiver is in jail on drug charges in Iowa City. Coach Ferentz suspends Koulianos

Creighton makes it official:  Greg McDermott will leave Iowa State to coach BlueJays--gets long term contract
Remember, if Greg McDermott takes Creighton job--he'll be coaching against his son, Doug, at UNI. Gotta love a sports storyline like that.
I have to go to my UNI class now--so someone please keep me up to date--I say, if the offer is there--Greg takes it-he deserves it-Good fit.
Creighton job is one with high expectations, given Altman's success. Courier reporting McDermott has no comment.  http://bit.ly/crK95e
You have to figure McDermott would accept the offer, but there is nothing yet 'official' out there that I have heard.
As we say in life, timing is everything---Greg McDermott gets great offer at Creighton-thank Oregon later.

I will be a bit surprised if Coach Lickliter is out--I know they had a bad year but, I was told he'll get at least another year. We'll see.
Notice, I am optimistic Iowa women will make the NCAA field. Bluder's Bunch deserves it this year, especially with all the injuries.
With UNI, ISU & Iowa women all in NCAA, along with UNI Men, our sports guys will be out of town. That means I get to do sports. Yeah.

Judge Carroll told jurors not to be concerned about the potential consequences to Becker--
I'm not there, so my take is pure speculation, based on the note we will show on the air tonight at 5. Jury has gone home for the weekend.
In note to Judge--Becker jury seems concerned about what will happen to Becker if they find him insane---perhaps--would he ever be set free.
Judge is telling jurors not to watch any TV or read any newspapers about the Mark Becker case--there will be no deliberations this weekend.
No verdict yet---Judge Carroll sends the jury home for the weekend....will resume deliberations at 10:00 am Monday.
