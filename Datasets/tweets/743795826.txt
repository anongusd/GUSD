@matloff @kanumankalwa @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon tons of studies have proven net positive effect of immigration. high skilled immigrants have even higher contributions to US economy. US is already out of top 10 in world innovation ranking. discouraging high skilled immigrants will further erode it.
@matloff @aroonmurty @Indyscent @kanumankalwa @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon there is high demand for ML/AI professionals than dot net professionals so you would see more wage growth in ML/AI. wage growth depends on skill set, specific industry. there was 3.1% wage growth for all Americans, I can safely assume it will be much more for STEM graduates. 2)
@matloff @aroonmurty @Indyscent @kanumankalwa @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon there are 7 million open positions and millions in STEM.

@matloff @kanumankalwa @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon you said you are concerned about impact of immigrants on jobs? how 300k legal high skilled immigrants already present here be given GC after waiting decades will have impact on job market? how I/C immigrants with twice the median household income have any negative impact?
@matloff @kanumankalwa @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon wait time will be equal for all applicants applying on a given date in the same preference category regardless of country of birth if HR392 is passed into the law. current ROW applicants will have min impact. there is a 3 years transition period to accommodate existing applicants
@kanumankalwa @matloff @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon there are extreme right and extreme left elements who oppose all or a set of immigrants. extreme right oppose all non-whites, extreme left oppose high skilled immigrants who compete with them for white collar and knowledge based jobs. extreme left has no issue with low skilled.
@matloff @kanumankalwa @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon Progressives have no issue that 82% of DACA applicants are from a single country, no issue in giving weightage to immigrants who have no regard to US immigration laws over who followed all laws, contributing to US and waiting patiently for decades.	https://t.co/CQoPgvsbVf

@matloff @kanumankalwa @Indyscent @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon wait time will be equal regardless country of birth after HR392. there is no buyer for increasing GC or auto STEM GC in capital hill. you have all assumptions to oppose HR392. I mentioned in my previous tweet the 4 reasons of GC backlog. for per country limits HR392 is answer. 1)
pros of HR392 far exceed any real or perceived cons and for that reason previous version of country quota bill passed in house with 390 yes and current version has 330 cosponsors. everyone is entitled to their opinion so not going to debate you further. peace. https://t.co/q7heHe5hIH

GC wastage due to red tape at @USCIS, @StateDept, @DHSgov 	4. AC21 increased H1 3 fold for 3 years without increasing EB cap
@matloff @LegalDreamer1 @rajeshsiia HR392 wont increase abuse in H1 or EB GC, instead will help reduce it. it will eliminate bonded labors, it will reduce quick GC in 6 months for ROW and they would need to spend more time under scrutiny, it will reduce jumping from F1/J1 to EB against F1/J1 visa intent.
@aren7019 @rajeshsiia @matloff a first come first served fair merit based immigration system will be good for all nationalities. why Japanese, Korean or any other nationality wont wait for their turn?

@matloff @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon You are the one who is deflecting. I gave reasons HR392 won't increase h1 fraud instead will reduce it. Then u asked if ROW wait will increase. I said for future applicants who have not contributed to US whereas backlogged immigrants contributing for decades. What's the problem?
@matloff @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon It will slightly increase for FUTURE applicants from other countries and will be same for all countries including India/China. Existing ROW applicants have minimum impact due to 3 years transition period.
@matloff @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon Can you guarantee Rest Of the World applicants have zero fraud? I can point you to a study where before Trump admin H1 RFE and rejection rate for ROW were higher than India. Again Hr392 is not going to increase H1 fraud, instead will reduce it.
@matloff @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon Assume its quiet light. my point is 2 countries are vetted repeatedly and other skips scrutiny after 6 months. making the system FIFO where everyone will go through same scrutiny, same number of time will help curb fraud. hr392 will help reduce h1 abuse.
@matloff @rajeshsiia @FrescoLeon Go back and read my tweet again. 2 persons applying on same date in same EB category will have same wait time regardless of country of birth and let me ask you again what is the issue with a fair First Come Served System in merit based immigration?

@David_J_Bier @BarackObama is like Chameleon. he said things to get elected, did opposite when elected. In 2014 EO he ordered to solve #GCBacklog through rule makings, but backtracked after DAPA was stuck. Idea was to use legal immigration fees to fund DAPA. He fought against legals in court.

@lauradfrancis @USCIS US(CIS) is living in fools paradise. Toronto created more tech jobs than silicon valley in 2017. The mass exodus of skilled immigrants has already started and jobs are leaving with them. Companies are nearshoring/offshoring jobs as the result of harsh immigration policies.

@lauradfrancis @USCIS This implies existing EADs will be canceled. With DACA/TPS they gave 6 to 1.5 years cool off period and allowed renewals of EADs, and EAD would be valid through their validity period. US treats Legal/High Skilled/high tax paying immigrants harsher than illegal immigrants. #Shame
@lauradfrancis @USCIS Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.
@lauradfrancis @USCIS DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees EAD are terminated

@lauradfrancis @USCIS US(CIS) those jobs will leave US with those high skilled h1/h4. It has already started and will accelerate. The ultimate motive of Miller/Cissna and company is ethnic cleansing of America with the stroke of a pen, not to improve situation of US workers.
@lauradfrancis @USCIS is pathetic, "some US workers would benefit by having a better chance of obtaining job". BS if someone can't find a job in current economy they have serious problems with their skillset. It's better to be reskilled than blaming on #H4EAD, which are &lt;0.01% of US workforce.
@lauradfrancis @USCIS US(CIS) wasted billions on a case management system which had ten times cost overrun and it can process only a single form. This rogue agency is disgusting. It should be shutdown and privatized. They scoop all those billions by giving few weeks visa extensions and exploitation.
