The Vatican is the devils romance don't be fooled
He is already denouncing the gospel saying a relationship with jesus is false and dangerous doctrine
To the worlds 1.2 billion Catholics your faith will be tested. Dave Wilkerson before he died said that the Pope is gonna be more like a world leader
Jesus said in the end times many Christian's would abandon their faith
Ppl claim that their prayers are not answered. That Jesus has abandoned them.
There are approximately 250,000 latino muslims living in the United states
In these days u see a lot of ppl abandoning the christian faith and going to other religions
God says in the bible who ever loves their children more then me is not worthy of me
Always put god first in everything you do
When jesus ask Peter who do you say I am Peter replied the christ. Jesus said bless u Peter you will be the rock upon where my church will stand.
If you don't think you need god remember what the gosble says. I am the way the truth am the life, no one goes to the father excepted three me
Job was one of gods loyal followers. Satan put him to the test, he lost everything and not once did he curse god. When on doubt call on the name of the lord
When the devil was testing jesus he said command these stones to become bread. Jesus answered man must not live on bread alone but on every word that god says

Thanks for helping me reach 25 followers! Whchristians o else do you think should be following me?ppl who believe in effective change that god is the solution to the worlds problems
One of the reasons why the Jews are persecuted in the world is because they are gods chosen ppl and the devil rules until jesus retun.
Lucifer means light bear, then he started to glorify himself (they are Benito me why should I serve then) sin created the devil
In Hebrew satan means adversary to oppose. In gods kingdom the weaker serves the stronger. This angered Lucifer, Lucifer means
Pastors in church they talk about the benefits of following god, but not enough if u don't. Hell is real and if u do not choose him u choose satan
God is an awesome god he conceded death so that u and I can hv life. If that's not love I don't know what is.
If you are feeling down or lost or hopeless diapering. Remember we hv a god that can do all things, can give hope to the hopeless, joy

Ask and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened.
What do u think about what's going on in the world, I'm not just talking to the Christian's. U hv every right to be upset to want change. Only jesus
Are u seeing what's going one with the country everything is divided. This is how the New World Order begins. Throwing ppl off
Groups like black lives matter, sons of odon, are a grander part of the devils scene to divide and concede and deceive christians.

In christianity u definatly hv to make sacrifices. Violent video games rated r movies. These are just some ways the devil handles us from god
God says it's easy for a camel to go into the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
In gods kingdom the stronger serves the weaker.
Love the lord with all your heart all your mind all your strength. Love your neighbor as thyself.
Ask yourself if the rapture were tomorrow would you be ready to go with jesus. Do u know the messia
I'll take jesus 100000000000 to 1.
Trump is not doing everything wrong there is a devil. The world needs to wake up before it's too late and realize jesus returns.
I think it can be dangerous when you mix religion and politics together under one banner. But look at what's happening in the world, it's hard not to. Trump cannot be blamed for everything that is happening in the world. I'm a Democrat and I'm saying this. He's
