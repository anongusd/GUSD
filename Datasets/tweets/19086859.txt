@KathaPollitt btw, I get that you might watch same video &amp; think "eh, not so bad!" We see it differently! What's striking is people reacting to those who did think it was bad claiming we're naive pawns of Veritas-style manipulation &amp; belong on Fox. No...I just don't think she handled it well!
@KathaPollitt She cited her victory as evidence of why she‚Äôs right &amp; they‚Äôre wrong, suggested that bc they couldn‚Äôt vote their voices weren‚Äôt relevant, didn‚Äôt acknowledge urgent timeline (short of ‚ÄúI have grandchildren!‚Äù Which is not the point) doused their enthusiasm rather than stoking it.
RT @fivefifths: This is a good read: https://t.co/2h6Vqo67cq
I‚Äôm saying she handled this horribly, &amp; if we cannot criticize the handling of (to my eye, righteous &amp; necessary) protest we‚Äôre fucked. I want our representatives, incl those in my party, to do better and I applaud those who push them hard &amp; publicly. She didn‚Äôt do well here.
AND FINALLY: what is this going to the barricades for Dianne Feinstein? As she‚Äôd apparently be happy to tell you, she just won a big election, a new six year term. No one is threatening to impeach her or saying that she‚Äôs worse than Trump or Republicans. I‚Äôm just criticizing her.
Those talking about ‚Äúusing‚Äù children (informed, engaged children) to further a cause‚Äîthis is also a protest tradition meant to drive home to those in power very real, very serious points about vulnerability and the future (see, for ex, the Children‚Äôs March).
Activists being ‚Äúrude‚Äù to senators is goddamn patriotic, civic responsibility. It‚Äôs protest. Also, no one, save Feinstein, was particularly rude! Telling environmentalists she knows better bc she got a million vote plurality is rude (&amp; wrong! Winning doesn‚Äôt confer infallibility)
Activists streamed the whole thing: they therefore offered full context AND a short digestible version, standard practice. Long version shows aspects that bothered me most (‚ÄúI just won a big election;‚Äù ‚Äúactually you didn‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù) are intact &amp; in context in the edit.

@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti &amp; Steve, this is not a man on death row, nor (at the moment) facing criminal charges. He‚Äôs being asked to step away from job in which he is supposed to work for/represent constituents, in which he wields huge power. The comparison mocks those who do face incarceration &amp; death.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti by affirming that the harm done to them doesn‚Äôt have to be paid for, that their stories don‚Äôt matter, that the cost of a man‚Äôs career is greater than the cost of not believing their (amply backed up, public, credible) stories of the damage they claim he did them.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti That is exactly my point: women pay a price for all of this from every angle. But deciding that the man who‚Äôs been credibly &amp; multiply accused is the one who should not be asked to pay does not fix damage done to women: it compounds it...
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti I know all about the false stories, Rolling Stone, the history of white women leveling false allegations. And yes, women are hurt by a lot of this, including having their lives careers reshaped by assault AND the disbelief and pushback that greets their stories about it.
RT @darakass: Just look at the pictures @CNNPolitics used for him and her- you will start to see the subtle and often unconscious was bias‚Ä¶
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti But what‚Äôs being evaluated here is an entirely different question: whether he should keep a powerful, high-status job when he has been multiply  &amp; credibly accused of assault. (Also my earlier point: what costs his colleagues are incurring for his behavior, no matter what)
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti But I don‚Äôt find these charges capricious or random; I find them highly credible &amp; so do enough of his peers that they have expressed their desire to see him go. None of this is about his legal presumption of innocence: if he stands trial, of course he should receive due process.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti ...When their continued presence on the job is deemed to be damaging to their colleagues or their workplace (party)‚Äîas Fairfax‚Äôs is. And I‚Äôm not arguing for silly-nilly firings; in fact, I support unions precisely to protect workers against unjust and capricious dismissal.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti People lose their jobs all the time after far less inquiry &amp; benefit of the doubt than Fairfax has received, when, for example, they are accused of bad behavior credibly enough that they lose the faith &amp; support of their colleagues, as Fairfax has.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti But suspending normal criteria applied to criminal law is appropriate when you‚Äôre....not dealing with criminal law. That law and those presumptions are built for a criminal justice system in which the accused is being threatened with a loss of physical liberty.

@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti Also, Steve, a tip: my comments here have nothing whatsoever to do w women being monolithic, which of course they are not. I‚Äôm talking about something totally different here. Your righteous objections would be more powerful if they were in response to what I was actually arguing.
@iwrotesham @JessicaValenti I believe in both due process and the presumption of innocence wholeheartedly! They apply in the matter of criminal law, not in questions of whether a politician, credibly accused of violent assault (or who has admitted to wearing blackface), should resign or lose his job.

This last point‚Äîthat the scrutiny on the reactions of black women is particularly acute‚Äîis addressed directly in the Times piece, at the same time that the dynamic‚Äîscrutiny on their reactions‚Äîis recapitulated.
Also here: Fairfax‚Äôs suggestions that this is a smear meant to bring him down as he ascends to historic job (in light of real history of sex assault claims made to discredit black men) makes it hellaciously more fraught for black women-his accusers &amp; colleagues asked to evaluate

The reporters stand outside to talk to THEM. The press and party and voters react to THEIR RESPONSES. It‚Äôs a massive and unjust price, constantly paid by women, even as all the official handwringing is about whether the accused men are being treated justly or not.

For example, this person believes that the ‚Äúsocial fabric of democratic civilization‚Äù is degraded by uncomfortable cab rides/dinner party convos &amp; that the discomfort he experiences in those situations is tantamount to being policed and publicly executed.
One thing I‚Äôll say in favor of this letter: it conveys a huge amount of information about what this men‚Äôs magazine editor conceives of as a human experience, whose challenges register for him, the forms he imagines hardship taking.
Putting everything else aside, anyone in media who easily elides Fox News and CNN/MSNBC as comparable and opposing forms of ‚Äúagitprop‚Äù is being not just careless or imprecise but dishonest (or stupid? But probably dishonest)
This editor‚Äôs letter is...unspeakable in its awfulness (&amp; blindness to everything that might in fact be worth exploring about whiteness &amp; masculinity!) Oh and for clarity: I‚Äôm not burning anyone at a stake, nor operating a digital guillotine. I‚Äôm just writing some mean tweets. https://t.co/qX6ACq8gP4

@coldxman Women regularly campaigned against their own enfranchisement. By your logic: Does that tell us that the disenfranchisement of women wasn‚Äôt sexist?
@coldxman *Is NOT a form of gendered discrimination.
@coldxman As for your framing: is racism ALONE responsible for why people hold such a belief‚Äîit‚Äôs never that simple. All kinds of systems are built around biases to make expression of those biases practical, sensical, appealing‚Äîso that the embrace of them isn‚Äôt officially about the bias.
@coldxman Part of my point is that racist gestures, acts, ideas &amp; systems are broadly acceptable to lots of people, including some of those they marginalize. Plenty of women also find sexual harassment acceptable; that doesn‚Äôt mean that harassment is a form of gendered discrimination.
I‚Äôm perplexed by the idea that we‚Äôre supposed to be shocked by the popularity of racism and sexism. I mean, right, this is the whole point: this behavior is ACCEPTABLE amongst many people. It‚Äôs always been a lie that social disapprobation had eradicated bias. https://t.co/Zu0qQbRXkY

Okay, pretend I haven‚Äôt been paying attention: which Fyre doc am I supposed to watch?
Once you notice this dynamic--the less powerful challenging the abuses of more powerful getting cast as disruptive/problematic, while abuse of powerful being normalized to the point of invisibility--you see it all the time, every day.
This is why I write how after Freddie Gray was killed, news said "the violence started when protesters threw rocks." Violence started when he was murdered! But powerful acting on the less powerful was normalized. The challenge of powerLESS was aberrant, visible, deemed dangerous.
Yes! Yes! This dynamic is so common &amp; important! "calls for civility almost always redound positively to the oppressors, because incivility against the oppressed is so normalized, it ... can barely be detected as oppression" (that quoted part is from my book) https://t.co/qrRKNLumEn

@CathyYoung63 @JacobusCuesix Okay so THAT‚ÄôS where you believe my theory is ‚Äúblown to bits,‚Äù right? It‚Äôs not that the poll complicates it (it reinforces it) it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt believe white patriarchy exists in the US...
@CathyYoung63 I'd say that these data bolster the argument that a lack of investment in or benefit from marriage is tied to lefter politics, which is not at all at odds with what I've written in the past. It's just that I've been writing about the women, not the men.
@CathyYoung63 I'd venture that those numbers suggest that married white men, who benefit most from white patriarchy &amp; the institution that has historically organized power &amp; labor within it, are the most likely to support the political party that supports the furtherance of white patriarchy!
@CathyYoung63 But even amongst white male voters, I've seen other polling showing a marriage gap, in part attributable to age, and--while I don't write about men's patterns, so I'm spitballing here--
@CathyYoung63 I'd be curious about these numbers broken down by race. It's with white women voters that you really can see the marital split; unmarried white women are the only marital category of white women likely to vote Democratic: https://t.co/Z40yL71ozQ
@CathyYoung63 Why? I guess I'm not understanding your reasoning. The marriage gap for women and men overlaps with age and race (factors that also relate to investments in white patriarchy and its benefits, fwiw!) It's not surprising that the marriage gap applies to men as well as women, is it?

@armandodkos @daphna27 I thought it was worth retweeting.
@tomwatson @armandodkos @daphna27 And yes, this is also real bad.
@armandodkos @daphna27 I RTed Adam. My career is (in part) covering women in politics, including HRC, so if you want to call my commentary about her careerist, fair enough. But the careerism isn‚Äôt in either piling on or praising her. It‚Äôs in saying what I think. Here, I thought her to be wrong.
@armandodkos @daphna27 I don‚Äôt cover John Kerry. I have covered Hillary Clinton for a long time. But to your point: I did not link my later tweets on this to the one about her precisely because I didn‚Äôt want to suggest that she was the only one to have made this argument.
@daphna27 @armandodkos Again, this is certainly not the first time I‚Äôve been critical of HRC. I wrote a book in 2010 about my long history of mixed criticism of and admiration for her. I thought these comments were bad and said so.
@daphna27 @armandodkos Also, I don‚Äôt think I ‚Äúlashed out.‚Äù I sent a single tweet calling HRC‚Äôs comments bad. I later tweeted about the broader error I believe many make when they argue migration or social disruption/movements are to blame for punitive right wing politics/policies.
@daphna27 @armandodkos Hi to both of you, just seeing this. I have written about HRC for many years &amp; have always been critical when I felt critical. I was upset by Guardian comments (still am).

This is a lesson to be drawn from longtime arguments against humane immigration policy, as well as against progressive social movements. The fight for more equality does not conjure inhumanity; it responds to &amp; further reveals the inhumanity that has undergirded the inequality.
Migration, integration, insistence on humane treatment of those who have been treated inhumanely‚Äîthese do not CREATE racism, right wing extremism, misogyny and violence where those impulses did not previously exist.
Grateful for the new generation of women and men who are going to take Democratic politics into the future.

@nhannahjones This is chilling.
if you're really concerned with the truth why wouldn't you want an investigation and to hear from the witness.

27 years later, almost to the week, there will be another hearing into alleged sexual abuses of a SCOTUS nominee. Also almost a year to the week of the Weinstein story, two years to the week of Access Hollywood tape. 229 years since women‚Äôs riot kicked off French Revolution.

Obviously I agree w general sentiment: nominate/elect women, work toward actual representative democracy. But in white capitalist patriarchy, there are always going to be women whose very value is, and whose rewards stem from, a willingness to uphold the power structure.
Though, unfortunately, that‚Äôs likely to be their next move, should they need one. Getting a white woman to do the work of overturning Roe (&amp; circumscribing voting, workers rights) thereby doing disproportiate harm to non-white women. https://t.co/zmv3WuwhP1

If you had him bringing in a basketball team of girls (whose reproductive autonomy we've been promised by the president he'll take away) as testimony of how great he is to women, you MIGHT have an inkling that he's not great for women.

1. "He never did anything to me" has no bearing on whether or not he did something to someone else. 2. "'He's cool in carpool' says local woman" was ALWAYS intended to defend against the (correct) charge that he'd do grave harm to women, whether individually or via the law.

Anyway, my big lesson is: don't be like me; tell your friends &amp; family to not be like me. Check your registration, keep trying even if site is down. There are a hell of a lot of affidavit ballots out there tonight marked for candidates who didn't win, and that sucks.
I knew that NY voters had been purged in the 2016 primaries, knew that voting this year had been made particularly difficult &amp; that I should double check. BUT I'd also been getting mailers, canvassed, texts from campaigns &amp; primary info packets. I wasn't worried (enough).
A week ago, I was reminded, via this from @rachelbtiven, to check my registration, but as her tweet noted, the BOE site was down. I tried several times that day, but site remained down. And then I forgot to keep trying. https://t.co/Me7dklUkqn

@cmanego @TaranaBurke Absolutely correct.
@cmanego Same to you. And your observation wasn‚Äôt wrong! I wish you well and will continue to follow your work.
@cmanego If your argument is that white women shouldn‚Äôt profit from these inequities in part by not addressing them in their work, then fair enough. But I believe that integrating them into our work, while citing &amp; amplifying work of non-white colleagues &amp; critics, is crucial.
@cmanego Yes, I profit, professionally, from my writing, some of which is about these very dynamics, so that‚Äôs fair! But my response was not exactly to plug my book, rather to respond to your (also fair!) tweet that this is something I pretend isn‚Äôt a reality.
@cmanego May or may not match your view of the dynamics, but I don‚Äôt pretend that white women aren‚Äôt complicit in nor profit from the subjugation of non-white people.
@cmanego I write at length about exactly these dynamics, and this history‚Äîfrom abolition/suffrage through 2018‚Äìin my upcoming book, fwiw. Also addressed them here: https://t.co/eOxe6iNYRK and elsewhere in my journalism.

As if THAT were the question of culpability to be asked in the aftermath of assault. Anyway. Carry on.
It‚Äôs funny bc on this run, having read Wapo piece, I‚Äôd been recalling how last year I‚Äôd been running in Prospect Park on day a woman runner had been assaulted there at 5 am. As I ran past, a tv reporter had yelled to me, ‚Äúwould you ever run alone that early in the morning?‚Äù
It‚Äôs 2 pm, busy city street, I‚Äôm 43 and dressed in my most embarrassingly ugly running clothes. It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, where you are or how old you are, being approached, hassled, leered at, yelled at and worse is just a reality.
I was not in physical danger. He didn‚Äôt threaten or touch me. It was on a busy street &amp; another man had caught my eye &amp; signaled he was seeing what was happening as the guy came toward me. I mention it because it‚Äôs just so, so common and in many other circumstances, terrifying.
So I just finished a run. Walking home when man, clearly unwell, crossed busy street, erratically &amp; fast, to approach &amp; ask if I had a cigarette. I said no. He came much closer, leered in my face ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tell daddy!‚Äù then yelled as I walked away quickly, ‚Äúwon‚Äôt tell your daddy!‚Äù

This is also a good explanation for why they send out Nielssen and SHS to do the monstrous lying and then do outrage cycles about how we're all sexist for not being civil to them.
Wait hold up @traister_a just explained it to me: "Tactic is to make Melania the target so the left comes for her &amp; when some blogger calls her a whore the WH can say look the left is sexist &amp; then the story will be about Melania being bullied." Ding ding ding. That is correct.
OR--and here's where I'm going with this, I guess--your reaffirmation of monstrosity IS tactical insofar as it entails entirely purposeful messaging of white supremacist attitudes aimed directly at your base.
Yeah yeah yeah it's a distraction. But when your distractions accurately reaffirm the nature and degree of the monstrosities in question, they might not be the tactically genius maneuver you think they are.

then we should make sure that we take advantage of this view of monstrosity to ensure that the end goal should be not a return to quotidian horror, but rather that we become FAR BETTER than we have been historically.
America is not "better than this." It rarely has been. These policies have long been inhumane, before the cages, yes of course--under Obama. But if it takes this abomination to make a vast number of people understand and reckon with the inhumanity...
Let's make sure that the aims here don't end with getting rid of the cages, or even reuniting kids with parents, but rather with offering people, these families and others, true refuge, resources, support--with the long overdue revision of our horrific immigration policies.

@Kascadingbrook @matator358 @octothorpe_kmg My husband is a public defender. He works all day to keep people who shouldn‚Äôt be in jail out of jail. He comes home crushed by the family devastation he sees at the hands of our criminal justice system. And Jeff Sessions works every day to put more vulnerable Americans in jail.
@Kascadingbrook @matator358 @octothorpe_kmg I do care about American citizens. Many of the same people horrified by this express equal horror, and have for years, about the criminal justice system. They donate and send links to bail funds, protest unlawful arrest practices, advocate for lighter sentences &amp; prison reform.
@Kascadingbrook @matator358 @octothorpe_kmg Many of them have had to flee THROUGH Mexico, evading kidnap &amp; cartel violence, to get to border.
