@TribTomWharton I think expansion to 100% is a step in the right direction.  I will tell you we are quite self reliant in Piute County 57% of my constituents voted against expansion.

@ShawnMilne I couldn't agree more!
@TribTomWharton If anything I did only passed with 53% I'd be damn nervous.
RT @Kevin_Shipp: Hillary set up the Trump tower meeting. It was a Clinton set up. PUT THIS WOMAN IN JAIL. https://t.co/7WvaGtaJ2m
@TribTomWharton Let's be honest Tom, it was 53% slightly more than a majority.  Poorly written, executed, and funded, this is why you don't legislate by initiative.  I think it is wise to clean it up today, vs. deal with a disaster (which it will be) in the future. #utpol
@TribTomWharton well if you can do the math now, why wait until you are bankrupt, I don't see the logic in that either.  It's easier not to put 28% more people on the roll than it is to remove them in the future.   I have faith we are able to to the math today.
@TribTomWharton The other thing that is a big question mark for everyone including the utahleg is the question of a waiver at the federal level.  Even when done, I don't think you have seen the last of this issue being debated in the utleg.
@TribTomWharton I don't think that is 100% correct in the long run, remember this federal reimbursement is a sliding scale.  Eventually Utah will eat the lions share of this bill.
@TribTomWharton I've talked with many and the issue really is sustainability and expense.  Watching our finances and keeping our financial house in order is paramount! #utpol

@gumshoe77 what kind of question is that?
@gumshoe77 no history to destroy. It's already had excavators, dozers, graders, front end loaders and is driven daily/weekly in a pickup
@gumshoe77 wrong, it was an area closure not a road closure and it specifically excluded ROW‚Äôs and existing valid uses / claims.
@gumshoe77 make the story fit your agenda, that‚Äôs fine. I was there, were you? I know the canyon do you? I‚Äôve hiked it have you?

@sall54 there is absolutely nothing unconstitutional about it as has been shown in several studies

@sall54 what is unconstitutional is  that the states west of Cowere not admitted to the union on an equal footing with those east of Co

@celliott406 So after a little research about you, I see you stand against a lot of things.  Do you actually stand for anything??????
@BryanWatt2 v.s. the current agenda which will have you entirely locked out in a few years.  TPL=Sustained Yield, Local Control, Access.
@RepChrisStewart go gettem!!!
@BryanWatt2 the economist in their live presentation talked of many revenue enhancements they didn‚Äôt explore due to time limits and scope
@BryanWatt2 study shows coal and timber as limited revenue, all economists agree those revenues will increase under state control.
@BryanWatt2 study assumes State Mgmt will cost as much as Fed Mgmt, nobody in their right mind will be that wasteful and inefficient.
@BryanWatt2 this country will continue to develop energy resources whether you like it or not.
@BryanWatt2 since when is mineral royalties abstract? Take a look at historic oil prices and price trajectory, quite obvious!
@celliott406 apparently you can‚Äôt read either, I have told you three times!  #wasteofmytime
@BryanWatt2 yes you know all about a nice try, you want to talk all the cost none of the revenue #wasteofmytime
@celliott406 apparently you have comprehension issues.  #troll #wasteoftime
@celliott406 I make no apologies for supporting @AmericanLandsCn, it‚Äôs the only solution big enough!
@BryanWatt2 yeah you apparently failed to read the revenue side.  Nice try.
@celliott406 the map comes from the Feds not me.
@celliott406 doesn‚Äôt mean that they are desired to be transferred!!!
@celliott406 the map is a map that show Federally controlled land, you can‚Äôt dispute the facts.  It also shows Ntl Parks, monuments, rec.
@utahhousedems I guess we have to consider who said it.
@BjaminWood yet opposed the Transfer of Public lands that could help Ed funding immensely
@celliott406 if that‚Äôs the case then they obviously don‚Äôt understand the policy statement or legislation that has already been passed.
@celliott406 I‚Äôm not saying anything, they aren‚Äôt included in the transfer, therefore I make no claim about those lands.
@celliott406 you don‚Äôt understand the difference and you are arguing with me?? Seriously?
@celliott406 the map shows federally controlled land it doesn‚Äôt show the desired transfer.  Read the bill!
@BryanWatt2 quite obvious
@celliott406 I‚Äôm waiting for you to substantiate your rhetoric.
@celliott406 read Utah HB 148, 2012, they are off the table.
@celliott406 substantiate your claims!  Your mouth doesn‚Äôt count as facts!
@celliott406 I proud of our support of @AmericanLandsCn, and we have constituents with brains and they support our efforts!
@celliott406 counties started @AmericanLandsCn of course we support them.  Corporate Lobbyists??? Maybe you should do some homework!!!
@celliott406 I know every bill that‚Äôs involved, not a single dime goes to @AmericanLandsCn
@celliott406 substantiate a single claim, I‚Äôm waiting....
@celliott406 nice try!
@BryanWatt2 read the study!
@celliott406 it would be great if you could substantiate a single claim!
@celliott406 and had you read the article you would notice there is far more that land transfer involved.
@celliott406 did you read the article? Where does it say @AmericanLandsCn gets $$$$
@celliott406 you have yet to substantiate any of your claims!
