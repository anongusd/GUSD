For as obnoxious as his entrance was, Usman’s interview was surprisingly gracious. #UFC235
Dang, that guy was good. #UFC235
Usman does not *even* look tired. 😬 #UFC235
Usman’s entrance is actually a miniseries. #solong #UFC235
@willfnye I thought so, too, but then he was clearly so alert when he popped up after the stoppage.
Well, that was not a good way to end that. #UFC235

@rmcclarty @rawman1 Yes, you are, in addition to lacking basic reading comprehension—something with which Mr. Munhoz could probably help you, in his first or second language.

Tecia and Zhang illustrating the same amount of personal space my children give me during that first round. #UFC235

@secupp True story: Both Dolly and Jolene were on the list for my second-born before her dad died, but I felt like they’d be a lot to have to live up to. And then I went a different	direction to try to honor/include Jake, so I let ‘em go.

@bethanyshondark BOOKER
I think I basically agree with this. The debasement of “Jolene” is not evident in “Tennessee Waltz.” Dolly lends “Jolene” dignity, but it is devastating. One thinks TN Waltz gal might’ve waltzed onto other things. https://t.co/xnTE80OcJY

@Karl_Dilkington @RammerJammer017 I mean, Trump’s has some kind of attempted justification vs. Obama’s TOTALLY made up thing if you’re looking for a distinction, but I’m willing to call both bad.
@michael_steel @s 😬 FAIR
@JenniferBeavis @phillyvol5 Like, including today. Did you actually watch? I was calling him out long before you liberals who were just watching him burn down the Republican primaries and enjoying the hell out of it.
@JenniferBeavis @phillyvol5 It’s like you’ve literally never watched me. Again, have a good night, partisan lady!
@bigdogup Nope!
@fledtothesouth I’ve been taking a break. I had tech neck. Bad scene.
Sadder song: “Jolene” or “Tennessee Waltz?” Please submit your rationales with as much emotion and logical abandon as the rest of your @s bc it’s actually appropriate here.

@JenniferBeavis @phillyvol5 Are you high, Jen? I don’t judge.
@JenniferBeavis @phillyvol5 Um, Obama’s party had control of Congress... for two years of his presidency.
@michaelsnarky When it comes to politicians, yes, this is your best bet.
@realbly1 Yup, I’m glad you understand perverse incentives.
@johnboy409 @snarky_life Neat, sorry your values changed! But to each his own!
@snarky_life The rationales are always entertaining. “This was different bc I liked him and what he wanted to do with his overreach, &amp; I really disliked his opponents.” #moralcompass
@RammerJammer017 I know, it’s insane.
“I can’t believe you pointed out This Guy I Like did a thing This Guy I Don’t Like is also doing! Don’t you know that was different bc I liked him?! You have no moral compass!”
@phillyvol5 @JenniferBeavis That is indeed what she is saying. Cool standard, bro!
DACA was executive overreach, and President Obama was obliging enough to say so many times bc he didn’t believe he had the power to do it until he decided he wanted to after Congress didn’t act. Sound familiar? It should. You have two standards, not I. https://t.co/bYtCl3XCHk

@amyfigarelle When you have two standards, just own up to it.
@amyfigarelle How Trumpian/Clintonian of you. He was fired for knowingly and repeatedly lying under oath. You do you and excuse lies in people you happen to like that serve your political/personal needs, husbands or politicians, but I don’t.
@amyfigarelle It’s a fair characterization from the Inspector General. You should read up on it.
@Redrage1972 I never said that on air or here. Your binary partisan tribalism is forcing you to assume that bc I take one proven liar’s stories with a grain of salt, I’m excusing another’s lies even though I’ve said the opposite. You’re the one with two different standards, not I.
@Redrage1972 He was fired for lying his ass off under oath.
@amyfigarelle Did your husband lie under oath and lose his job for it? Bc that’s a pretty big deal and if he had, you should take his future stories (especially in the process of selling a book) with a giant grain of salt.
Lied. Under. Oath. Parse all you want. You have two standards, not I. https://t.co/z4GjHdHGf8

McCabe was let go for lying under oath. If you think the President’s lies are pertinent (they are!), then so are McCabe’s. Documented incidents of lying affect people’s credibility. You’re the one with a different standard for people you happen to like, not me. https://t.co/ZV47toTDxf
@Redrage1972 He got fired for lying. It does no good to ignore that very pertinent fact, especially if you think the President’s lies are pertinent, which they are BECAUSE LYING IS A TAX ON ONE’S CREDIBILITY.

Also, the wedding isn’t everything. Try to make it. If you can’t, you God willing, have a lifetime to spend w them &amp; their kids. My dad &amp; his best friend didn’t make it to each other’s wedding bc of military deployments, life, etc. They’re still besties w 40+ year marriages. https://t.co/1LQVmUQXjy
I mean, fair. Just don’t make it on a Saturday in the fall. I recently went to a Sept. wedding and was like “This is lovely, why have I never been to one before??” #seclife #itjustmeansmore https://t.co/WMyyxdL7Xk
@AlbertDickson1 Lions fan!
Kids were welcome at my wedding and would be welcome at another bc they are super fun, but I get if people make other decisions for cost or taste reasons, and if they do, they should be ready to lose some guests.
Eh, I dunno. This seems like a relatively edifying thing about which to argue. People have differing opinions, are sharing from different life perspectives &amp; there’s a lot of grey area. I’m not mad at it. https://t.co/zIFnqHVKLy
@JohnEkdahl @Dr_Shatterhand I will say, I respect someone’s choice, but kids in wedding party is slightly different and in general, I have never been to a wedding reception (in particular vs ceremony) where the kids were anything but delightful. Everyone’s drunk, kiddos dance, no one’s upset.
@MichaelRWarren 😂
@Dr_Shatterhand @JohnEkdahl If they’re in the wedding party, they should be invited to the reception.
@JohnEkdahl I have kids. I understand kid-free weddings completely. If they offer childcare, HUGE BONUS. If you’re a parent and you can go, great. If not, no biggie. Bride &amp; groom should understand they will lose peope (whispers:: maybe that’s why they did it and that’s okay)!
@JohnEkdahl Yup, after you’ve planned your own wedding, it’s very easy to forgive whatever decisions people make for theirs. If a bridezilla isn’t straight-up abusing her bridesmaids, let it be. Go or don’t go. You have a choice.

@mpetrie98 Yeah, I corrected.
@cjane87 I’m legit mystified by people who bother to argue it’s NOT a Christmas movie.

BUT MY POINT ABOUT MCCLANE AS CHRIST FIGURE TOTALLY STANDS.
Oops, “Christmas in Hollis” may show up earlier and then it ends with “Let It Snow,” another totally non-Christmasy thing. Sorry, I need to rewatch, which I may do now.
@George13287 @IAMMGraham @SonnyBunch @BillKristol Agree, why knock a Christmas movie off the list simply bc it’s more enjoyable than others year-round?
Not to mention the theme of a misfit man of duty with notably impaled feet putting his life on the line on Christmas for a bunch of people who reject him. But sure, it has nothing to do with Christmas.
Also, the middle, which I hasten to remind you all happens at a CHRISTMAS PARTY, includes the iconic “Now, I have a machine gun. HO-HO-HO,” &amp; the movie ends with “Christmas in Hollis.”

@EsotericCD @katherinemiller @allahpundit Call me the Mayor of Cucktown. This is all Twitter is good for.
BUT, I have news for you. “Hocus Pocus” was released in July, too. And I dare you to claim “Hocus Pocus” is NOT a Halloween movie for this reason. These studio/economic decisions are not defining. The movie content is.
MY GOD. https://t.co/4w1Fi2GEJq
@BiasedGirl OH MY GOD HER NAME IS EFFING HOLLY
And not that the Internet needs me for this, but since we’re on the subject, perhaps the strongest argument against “Die Hard” as Christmas movie is that its theatrical release was July, not Dec, so it was not *intended* as a Christmas movie. So the haters say.
FURTHERMORE, the establishment of Holly’s character is a phone conversation with her daughter from the Christmas party warning her not to snoop around for presents &amp; it includes a reference to Santa. I mean...come on.
@cjane87 WE ARE TRULY A NATION DIVIDED WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT SEE THESE PLAIN FACTS

Also my 5-yr-old: “If you don’t come upstairs I’ll turn you into a sandwich! I have superpowers!” I am not upstairs and also not a sandwich, so take her judgment calls as you will.
5-yr-old on “The Sound of Music” opening scene: “Her voice is more beautiful than Kathy’s.” “Kathy?” “Kathy Selden from ‘Singin’ in the Rain’.” “Dang, #shotsfired.” #savage
@imlunchy Haha, a lot of people have noticed that. My best guess is Mary Katharine is a nun’s name and he preferred it to Ham.
Also, if you ever feel the need to ask or complain that I post a lot of nonsense on this site (as many apparently do), I’d just note that it seems pretty clear this site is best suited for nonsense.

“Ocean’s 8”* Sorrrrry.
I’m also giving a seminar @uchipolitics today but probably not on this subject. Probably. It’s a pleasure to be here!
Anyway, I enjoyed watching them pull it off. They are an extremely charming band of criminals. For future reference, I cannot hack, &amp; am only available for heists over a 2-day period with my girlfriends bc of childcare limitations.
I’d be like, “Deb, maybe let’s do some warm-ups at the local estate sale before we go Met Gala.” Is heisting ability genetic &amp; she has just been saving hers or PERHAPS it’s a Highlander situation &amp; there can only be one Ocean, so once Danny’s gone, Deb inherits his powers.
AND ANOTHER THING! Debbie was small-time enough before this that she was duped by middling-hot art guy into a bad con, but as soon as she gets out, she’s not only moved on to the ballsiest heist of all time but is able to convince 7 other people to join her?
Twitter 🤷🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/DDWTG2SPi5
Also, Con Mom comes in from the suburbs to pull this heist for THREE WEEKS? That is a LOT of childcare, y’all.
Anyway, point being, maybe you’d like to have an idea of who you’d like to fill that very important role BEFORE you start selling your “flawless” giant heist plan. Amita the diamond chick (Mindy Kaling, who should be in everything), OTOH, knew Debbie &amp; she knew her skills fit.

Nine Ball secures their sloppily protected heist lair, hacks the Met security system, bugs an office in order to hack the Met security system, creates the necessary blind spot to pull the heist, &amp; is a magical solution to 11 other problems, including but not limited to
And, maybe I’m mistaken, but doesn’t Debbie get out and basically be like, “We need a hacker. Anyone know a hacker?” I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW INTEGRAL AND NECESSARY NINE BALL IS TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS ENDEAVOR.
And then convincing said starlet to take a middling-hot art dealer to the biggest event of the year instead of, like, Ryan Gosling? Nah.
Which, I get it, any heist is gonna have a few “will it won’t it” moments or it wouldn’t be a heist. But meeting a fashion designer who happens to be Wintour-approved, down on her luck, &amp; capable of convincing a young starlet to let her dress her for the Met Gala?
@Coffeehousejoe SPOILER ALERT
Debbie spent 5 years+ coming up with this intricate plan in the slammer, but when she gets out, the plan is dependent upon, like, 4 GIANT unlikely contingencies.

@realdirtylarry @svtjer I said “sanctioned drama,” not predetermined outcomes for a reason. And also, who cares what uninformed people think? It’s one tweet among thousands, *many* of which have been pro-NASCAR. People can deal.
@cat_benjie Aww, thank you! Appreciate you sticking around for a while and giving me a chance.

Yeah, yeah, I know there’s “bad blood.” That was literally the promotional name of the fight, which is what precipitated the second half of the tweet. Still, if he’d held it together for 20 more seconds &amp; taken his W, he’s better off.

@teneip Thank you!
@PellyRichard I know the history, hence the second part of my tweet. Still, if Khabib keeps it under control for 20 more seconds, he’s better off.
@svtjer True, that man is a treasure. Great fight and great interview.
@svtjer What you’re not getting is that I KNOW ALL OF THIS AND FOLLOW BOTH SPORTS. I’m not just making it up, dude.
@svtjer Yes, I noted that in a tweet to someone else around here. It’s what precipitated the last part of my tweet.
This all could have ended with an awesome, peaceful interview about hot balls and smoking weed. #missedopportunity #ufc #KHABIBvsMcGregor
@ashsoles Agree about the buddy.
@svtjer Meh, I like NASCAR (covered it, in fact) but they do pretend to be upset about some drama when really they like it.
@richmartinez_jr Already seen it. And UFC promoted and clearly enjoyed it, which is what precipitated the second part of my tweet.
RT @redsteeze: Thank you Harry. https://t.co/orfV5urWqz
Dang good fight. Stupid end by a sore winner. Why throw a bunch away on a random attack after it’s over? (Also, as with WWE &amp; NASCAR, I’m always unsure how much of this is sanctioned drama &amp; how much they really are upset about.) 🤷🏻‍♀️
👀
Khabib on the ground is like watching a slow-motion David Attenborough vid of a boa strangling his prey. #ufc #UFC229Live #KHABIBvsMcGregor
My take on who will win: One of these dudes is very fookin Irish, but the other is Russian and probably literally trained with bears so 🤷🏻‍♀️. #botharesavage #ufc #KHABIBvsMcGregor
My take on weigh-in drama: One of these dudes looks like Toad and the other is wearing his undies. #ufc #expertcommentary

On repeat for 1200 miles or so. This was bearable a) bc it’s a childhood fave of mine b) bc I have the exact vocal range of a Broadway version of a teenage newsboy, which means I’m great at every part except for, ironically, the plucky lady reporter.

Rest in peace &amp; eternal reward, Sen. McCain. You will be missed. I’ve often thought about what it took for him to be tested in a way few can imagine &amp; emerge optimistic &amp; determined.

@babydocwhit It’s more tense than scary, but it’s pretty tense.
That was very good. The first scene, one of the best and most heart-wrenching I’ve seen in a while. A weirdly beautiful movie and message, too.
I’m watching “A Quiet Place” by myself, guys. I’m sure it’s fine.

@byrdinator People are weird. Enough people told me to change my avatar to something “more attractive,” it’s been the same since 2011.
@NathanWurtzel Yeahhhhh, I noticed that, too.
TFW you’re sick &amp; your kids go to bed earlyish &amp; quietly &amp; you didn’t think you could possibly love them as much as you do for the simple favor of just shutting their yaps so you can crash. Angels.
@karol Such a bummer!
@stephenfhayes I keep saying this! But not as well as you.
It was obviously Omarosa.
Came home from @jaketapper’s show to find the house very hot, the babysitter no doubt confused, as was I. Someone had jacked the thermostat up to 99 degrees. I can’t imagine who...👧🏼...it...👱🏻‍♀️...was. 🤷🏻‍♀️
This is a legit great suggestion. It’ll really give some life to my “you know, when *I* was a kid, we couldn’t just pick whatever movie we wanted &amp; it magically showed up! We had to go to a store to get it &amp; hope it was there!” lecture. Kids: 🙄 https://t.co/RSiblun5j4

I would also like to apologize to the universe for not having known before now there was a Carrie Underwood song feat. @Ludacris??!
It is my official position that every song that merely “feat. @Ludacris” has its priorities wrong. That being said, a Spotify playlist of “feat. @Ludacris” songs is pretty great.
Can’t ask for much more than that. Kid’s straight from Heaven.
Fixed the toilet today. NBD, but one of those things on “the list” that I can mark off. I told my youngest daughter it was fixed. “YAY, my toilet!” She doesn’t even use the toilet. Runs to flush it, smiles as if I’m made of magic, runs to hug my leg. “Oh, THANK you, Mama!”

@crousselle For the record, my dad is still with us, but I’m no longer “mon petit chou.” 😂
@crousselle My dad called me “mon petit chou.” 😂
But “Darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be.” Life, right? I will always miss the singing.
These days, most people assume he could sing in a “sure, his wife thinks he could sing” way, but nah. A voice like an angel &amp; a PERFORMER. The kind you never feel unsure about onstage, a pleasure watch.
Him: “Like a river flows”	Me: “Doo-woo”	Him: “Surely to the sea”	Me: “Doo-woo!”
And I, with a serviceable but far less special voice, would sing the steel guitar part, usually from another room while doing laundry or changing a diaper or something.
He used to sing “Can’t Help Falling In Love” to me regularly. His Elvis was extremely convincing.
I happened to dig up a memory when I did a @FDRLST podcast on Elvis, &amp; it’s gonna sound crazy I didn’t remember this, but I was so...everyday.
Almost 3 years later, the thing I miss most about my late husband is the singing. He sang CONSTANTLY, &amp; perhaps bc it was such a part of everyday life we have almost no video of it.
What’s the thing you miss about a lost loved one that surprised you most? Tell me. I’ll start.

@kabunkkabunk @thechetmiller @Ryan_Reilly78 @ddeeb61 @jaketapper @ninaturner The show is about politics. We are political analysts. You should not be surprised that this happens.

@thedroopyfushia @keithboykin @ninaturner You probably will.

But first, I’ll fix my running toilet bc my life is glamorous and the preternatural ability to always please everyone comes with all these perks.
It was extremely clear it was satire from the beginning. https://t.co/jX2s6E20D8
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner I get that you have an issue with honest brokers with vaginas who speak their minds. It’s a thing you could reflect on.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner Just live your values, dude.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner Nope, not specious. You’re a man who is very dedicated to reflection on possible misogyny who sees a woman disagreeing with people regularly as a “problem.” Not just today in this argument, but in general. So, reflect.
As always: https://t.co/tpraiVkQYB
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner Maybe reflect on how often you tell women not to make a habit of disagreeing then? Since you’re very dedicated to that.
My menchies confirm I am a little bit of Two Minutes Hate for both ends of the ideological spectrum tonight so I think my work here is done for the evening.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner Oh, is it uncomfortable &amp; fundamentally unfair &amp; uncharitable for me to project all previous experiences &amp; grievances w a specific group of people onto you &amp; assume you mean harm when I know nothing about you or your background or your intent? Funny that. Careful not to smirk.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner Met plenty of men who have issues with it.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner I don’t. I just don’t hide it when I disagree.
@kabunkkabunk @thechetmiller @ddeeb61 @jaketapper @ninaturner “Appearance” is charitable to me. Thanks! It was not malicious. I have a resting whatever-that-is face.
@StormXMunroe @Gigamesh @mychartedlife Of course she can understand both. I was just talking about the political implications (again, literally my job) and she was talking about something very different.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner People should have more tolerance for being disagreed with.
@JonahNRO @DavidAFrench (The movie, not Denzel. Denzel’s not simple. That was confusing.)

@spearjosuebrenn @allcityfive0 It’s not the be-all. end-all, but it is what I’m called in there to do.
@piedpenguin @keithboykin @ninaturner That’s why I agreed on that point several times.
@ameliannaelle @mychartedlife To be fair, I’ve done a little of both. I didn’t have much time to explain my view not did I want to attempt to take much more on air. It seemed better to let Nina have the floor.

@allcityfive0 Again, that is the purpose of the show and my job. I don’t at all think it only exists in her mind, which is why i vocally agreed with her several times, just not on every point.
@WGladstone It’s fine and so’s my face. We’re all adults.
@murphmachine No, I just slightly disagreed with her.
@gwenmcdonald1 A genuine thank you for that!
@JusSay_It @keithboykin @ninaturner We’re looking directly at each other in the clip.
@tweetygirl53 @joadroams Look, I get you don’t want me to engage, on air or here. But this is ostensibly what we’re all here for or why would you be replying to me? This dude can take it. He came here to talk.
@LFCKV @BKlaskowski @keithboykin @ninaturner Very real racism and racial disparities and sometimes horrifying criminal justice disparities are part of what America is. I just don’t think our problems supersede the fact that it’s the greatest *opportunity* for the most freedom in history of the world.
@LFCKV @BKlaskowski @keithboykin @ninaturner I’m pro-legalization for exactly this reason and have talked about it on TV numerous times citing EXACTLY the racial disparity problem you’re citing.
@gwenmcdonald1 Again, not malice, &amp; was just attempting to listen and converse in a tense situation. Try following me. I might surprise you. And if not, you can enjoy coming at me. Take care!
@joadroams How far?
@BreakBreadLines Ha, I actually smiled at the straightforward mean joy of this tweet. It is the true essence of Twitter. Thanks!
@gwenmcdonald1 I was calmly listening, occasionally pushing back and occasionally agreeing with her. I didn’t do it with the look on my face you wanted. It wasn’t malice.
@Crownbuslife I do all the time.
@SarahRamsingh I just meant that’s just what my face does. It’s not malice. Just my lady face in its state.
@richbiev I just meant that’s just my face. That’s what it does.
@allcityfive0 No, it’s bc it’s my job to analyze the political impact of things. That’s much of the reason why we’re there.
@ddclaxton @HeadleyEttennaj @BKlaskowski @keithboykin @ninaturner Nah, that’s just my face.
@gwenmcdonald1 I’m not awful and that’s just my face, which does that in tense, public situations.
@HeadleyEttennaj @BKlaskowski @keithboykin @ninaturner I understand that point, &amp; yet it does not allow for an exchange of ideas, which is what we’re supposed to be there for if it precludes my pushing back on anything someone says.
@cfrank149 @ninaturner @keithboykin I did.
@zyl_hala @loida615 @TheLeadCNN @ninaturner @DavidJUrban I’m not a Trump supporter, but other than that, nailed it.
@madam0526 @jaketapper @DavidJUrban @ninaturner @JoeTrippi @TheLeadCNN I barely spoke. She had the floor.
@Lavjones79 @TheLeadCNN @ninaturner Her argument was not new to me. I just didn’t agree with all of it.
@isaredherring @EbonieOne @ninaturner @keithboykin Why are you going after her? She seems like a great speller.
@sunshinecal47 @jaketapper @DavidJUrban @ninaturner @JoeTrippi @TheLeadCNN I didn’t say that.
@EbonieOne @ninaturner @keithboykin It is literally my job to comment on this, &amp; through a political lens, despite Nina’s objections. She didn’t want pushback. I get that. I listened &amp; agreed w several of her points but not all of them. It will happen again.
@ddeeb61 @thechetmiller @jaketapper @ninaturner I’m happy to discuss. I do it often. A discussion was not what was happening there, unfortunately, and I knew it so I said my small piece &amp; mostly handed over the floor.
@ddeeb61 @thechetmiller @jaketapper @ninaturner I smile at least a bit for almost all emotions, and particularly discomfort/awkwardness. This was, to be charitable, an abnormal professional moment.
@BKlaskowski @keithboykin @ninaturner That is perfectly accurate assessment of what happened. Talking about it through a political lens is literally my job. She didn’t want any pushback on her America-is-inherently-racist-&amp;-irredeemable talking point &amp; though I agree w others of her points, couldn’t let that one be.
@Gigamesh @mychartedlife No worries on language. I get your point on why things don’t poll well. I think 1 of reasons we were at cross purposes is bc I was explicitly addressing it electorally (my job description) &amp; she personally (understandable), so it devolved.
@Gigamesh @mychartedlife I was just trying to calmly listen and occasionally push back. If you and I (or Nina &amp; I) talked about criminal justice reform, for instance, we’d probably agree on quite a bit, but I’m just not gonna let the America-is-only-racist-and-irredeemable idea fly by uncontested.
@Gigamesh @mychartedlife I’m really not. Have a good one.
@kathymnh @jaketapper @ninaturner @TheLeadCNN @CNN I was literally listening to her for the vast majority of the time.
@ninaturner @keithboykin I listened and assented to parts of her argument several times, but it wasn’t meant to be a conversation. I get that.
@spearjosuebrenn @mychartedlife No, it’s not. But my job IS about that, so it’s part of the conversation we’re supposed to be having.
@CatMedrano @Justin_Higgins2 @ninaturner @POTUS44 @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN Literally conceded and agreed w several of her points. That’s the opposite of dismissing.
@mychartedlife Privilege*
@JasonOverstreet I listened to her incorrectly, I suppose. Literally just listening to her.

@OneFineJay I was a shin splint person until I switched. I could only run trails outside of races. My whole calf/shin/ankle/knee situation is stronger and takes less impact now.
@heatherhbrown Just start with very short distances and build up slow! It really works well for me.
@heatherhbrown You have to start slow and with short distances and your calves will BURN, but I did a marathon on my toes in ‘16 after I worked up to it.
@BiasedGirl I just land on my toes/ball of my foot with each step instead of striking with my heel, like a traditional jogging style.
One of the best fitness decisions I ever made was switching to toe running in 2016. Benefits include:	1) Boss calves	2) Most of my long-standing foot/shin/knee problems are gone	3) Of paramount importance, I get to buy super cute shoes bc I don’t need ortho-style support anymore.

@Johnny_Joey Colbert, on the other hand, roast, then lots of news and waves. You can pick a comedian who can do entertaining without roasting, but you won’t get headlines. To me, that’s a great trade-off, but WHCA hasn’t agreed.
@SirYussly @Johnny_Joey You’re not addressing anything I actually said.
@Johnny_Joey No, I would argue in the years it was dignified, it didn’t make news or waves (Craig Ferguson). In the years it was a roast, it did.
Anyway, decide if you want a roast or not. If you do, deal. If you want a dignified dinner, do that, but it won't make waves or news. Having both is really hard.

As for this yr, I thought Wolf was lewd, mean, &amp; often funny, which was a step up from my expectation: lewd, mean, &amp; unfunny. She was too nasty to SHS, &amp; it never would've happened to a female D PressSec.

@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING Then you’re lucky and you are delicate, and as you said, you may not be cut out for this. Since I am the author of exactly zero emails to you, I can’t speak to your inbox. But you’re not destroyed. Take care.
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING I’m already quite careful about exposing people to undue Twitter barrages, but as I’ve explained, you don’t get away w lobbing false charges unanswered. We can both take away that there are consequences for thoughtless actions.
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING Frankly, most people would think “My Lord, she’s still on about this?” If this “destroyed” you, the problem is most certainly not me or anything I said or did. Destroyed. It’s ludicrous &amp; it’s not my doing or anything I can fix for you.
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING This is so much drama over nothing. We both should have reined it in. Neither anger and certainly not this amount of crying is warranted. I tried a truce this am &amp; apparently you rejected that. Dunno why.
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING If *you* had a legitimate policy difference, you should have addressed it instead of making up the fact that I didn’t address the thing you were asking about. It’s not hard. I do it all the time even on Twitter!
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics @ING It is delicate. You lie. You get called on it. I do consider “not making snarky comments &amp; quote tweeting people who question me.” It’s most of my Twitter life. But not those who accuse me of something I didn’t do. There’s the difference.
@schoolofsmock @ByondPolitics You didn’t disagree. You said I didn’t address it, which was a lie. I don’t know why this is so hard to grasp. I haven’t sent you any mail.

@schoolofsmock @FDRLST You’re addressing a phenomenally complex issue in the developed world in a few simplistic sentences. This is egregious. It’s worse than boiling them down for an op-ed length piece. I’m frankly appalled.
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST You falsely accused me, take umbrage bc you were called on it, and then you come looking for some sort of weird solidarity or sympathy. Nah, kid. Just say you goofed up.
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST Great, then don’t start by saying I didn’t address something you later concede I did. I just didn’t address it to your liking as an op-ed did not faithfully regurgitate your exact 8 yrs of post-grad study.
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST Life comes at you fast. https://t.co/SgCS8RtOqr
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST Oh, so I DID address it. Seems you would have known that and not be backtracking if you had READ THE PIECE.
Re-up, whiners. https://t.co/tpraiVkQYB
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST Congrats on the degree, nonetheless.
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST We cannot have a conversation when I have EXPLICITLY addressed the exact thing you’re crapping on me for not addressing. Take your insults &amp; umbrage elsewhere. You should apologize to me for goofing up.
@schoolofsmock @FDRLST Read the piece before you come at me with this nonsense and don’t be a baby about engaging in public.

Kennedy left a woman to die to save his political career. Connections, wealth, &amp; the news cycle delivered him.

@mlwelch31 “Quote tweet”
A quick PSA. If you engage w me on Twitter, you are doing so in a public forum. As such, other people may also respond to you even if I don’t QT you (which I’m also free to do). Please don’t whine when it happens. Twitter, how does it work?
@HeathBilbrey Boo effing hoo, man. Don’t ask for pics you don’t want to see, and don’t do it publicly if you don’t want people responding to you. I cannot believe how low people’s thresholds are for this.
@AK49AT @feathersong @jaketapper I’ve said publicly I worry about that. It’s a real thing. Substituting activism or limelight for processing can be dangerous; seen it happen. But their smiles don’t discredit them.
@JGanthier @HeathBilbrey Because I disagree with them on the policy changes they seek. Simple.
@HeathBilbrey IT IS THE PHOTO YOU EXPLICITLY REQUESTED. Grown men complaining when they get into a public back-and-forth on Twitter &amp; discover that back-and-forth is actually, you know, PUBLIC, is my favorite lame Twitter.
@jpodhoretz Hard to keep track, tbh. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@HeathBilbrey It’s almost as if you don’t want your questions answered. You take issue with their advocacy, fine. Me too! Argue with that, not the smiling.
@HeathBilbrey Oh, so “show me a photo of people smiling while in the depths of grief, but not that one that shows you smiling with your childhood friends on the day of your husband’s funeral. That’s low!” Got it.
@georgealper @jaketapper  https://t.co/oIBom3LtGJ
@HeathBilbrey Your questions indicate it’s not their smiling that upsets you. If you’re upset about their activism, feel free to take issue with that (I do, too!), not the smiling. You asked for a pic. I produced one.
@jiffyjren I worry about that, too, and have said so publicly. Different issue, though. The smiling is fine.
I’m a little sensitive about this particular criticism bc it shows up in the bizarro fever swamp Internet conspiracy theories about me, too.
@pepsicocom Haha, paging @Travistritt!
@adavo1963 I’ve said publicly I worry about them burying grief in activism and spotlight. I don’t worry about them SMILING.
@ComplyItMatters @jaketapper Sure, I disagree with their stance. Not the smiling.
@HeathBilbrey You said you’d be happy to listen if you saw a picture of a group of grieving people smiling. Weird, it’s almost as if people are totally disingenuous on Twitter.
@mikeyt64 Sure, take issue with the proposals and arguments. I do, too. Smiling does not discredit them.
@HeathBilbrey  https://t.co/cx04XGn5OF
@ConstitutionMod Sure, be against their proposals all you want. I am, too.
Seen some tweets attacking Douglas students for *smiling,* as if it’s proof of ulterior motives. They are not expected to look sad every second of every day to pass some grief test. They’re still living, &amp; grief &amp; laughter are sometimes next door neighbors.

Although, honestly, I think the damage is done. The moral equation of me with mass child murderers on blast for a week straight didn’t make me wanna work with you.
I believe the point of the activism is more than taking Enterprise points from NRA members &amp; calling them child murderers, right? I mean, if that’s your aim, bravo.

@VanessaCarlton @MeghanMcCain Hi! I was on Jake Tapper’s show yesterday with a moderate liberal who advocated for a ban on semi-automatic rifles &amp; handguns. The honesty is refreshing. Please stop pretending no one wants this even if you don’t.
@loftontech @CrankyOne123 @glacy @MeghanMcCain Automatics have been banned for private citizens since 1968. If you want to regulate semis the same way, you are talking about banning them.

@CrankyOne123 @glacy @MeghanMcCain “No one is talking about disarming anyone.” “Actually, a major liberal spokesperson said all semi-autos to me on TV yesterday.” “Ignore that. It’s just ARs.” “I won’t, and taking a particular gun from someone is literally ‘disarming.’”
@CrankyOne123 @glacy @MeghanMcCain Yeah, that’s just not true. My moderate liberal counterpart on The Lead advocated a ban on all semi-auto long guns and handguns. It’s helpful when people are honest about it.

@JenniferArrow Uh-huh. You seem very dedicated. I can’t believe you would allow the status quo instead of going door to door &amp; convincing people to give you their guns. Or, letting police ransack everyone’s house. Get started!
@JenniferArrow I’ll check in in a week and see if you’re doing something other than bitching about the NRA. Make it happen, girl. There can be no excuses. You have to do better than this.
@JenniferArrow We had one federally. Connecticut had one at the time of Sandy Hook. These things are fantasy solutions, but that doesn’t matter. But get to work. You’re not working hard enough.
@JenniferArrow Have the courage of these convictions. Don’t just talk about it. Get it done. It’ll be really hard &amp; you’ll lose tons of seats in every state for years bc of it, but that’s obviously a price worth paying. Get started. Go all out.
@JenniferArrow Start confiscating tomorrow, just freelance.
@JenniferArrow Good luck with this. Seriously, get to work on confiscation. Get to work on amendment repeal. Get to work on giving federal police force authority to search every American’s house for belongings, under the direction of President Donald Trump.

Can’t get enough of that. 🙌🏻🇺🇸👶🏼🏈🎀 https://t.co/U1TkKtE7Dq
Oh, thank goodness.
If that is not a TD, nothing matters. It was two TDs. He breaks the plane with possession and he then recatches it.
All right, y’all. I have 4% &amp; I’m gonna spend 4th Q with friends IRL. I know it’s wrong &amp; bad, Internet, but Eli and Odell already won. Will check back if possible.
ODELL ELI DIRTY DANCING WINS EVERYTHING! #SuperBowlLII
@angry_blue_dot  https://t.co/uJz8g9RQgZ
Oh, thank goodness. That was the right call. #SuperBowlLll
Again, we must observe the standard for “control” of a completed TD pass against the Patriots. #SuperBowlLll https://t.co/BTFJdZKag3
Learn football during the second half, y’all! https://t.co/tCoMmKCy8A
I have heard that “Trolls” song no fewer than 67,000 times in the last year. It’s still good. #SuperBowlLI
PURPLE MINNEAPOLIS. I die. #SuperbowlLLI
Just let Justin Timberlake do everything. All the things. We can all stop resisting now. #SuperbowlLLI
I’m so excited to see the second best singer from *NSYNC perform tonight! That’s right, I said it! I do heart JT, tho. Boy can perform. #SuperBowlLII
#godawgs 😭
Is it possible the underdog goes into locker room at half convincingly dominant but nonetheless loses to the Evil Empire thanks to a series of unlikely turns? Asking for a friend. #SuperBowlLII
That’s just a brave play. If you fail, you’re a goat. But if you make it happen, you’re a hero. High risk, high reward. Name of the game...is a very obvious thing I would say if I were calling this game. #SuperBowlLII
THAT’S JUST GOOD EFFING FOOTBALL! #SuperBowlLII (and they should never try that again!)
Weird that Belichick’s butler cut the sleeves off a purple sweatshirt for him tonight. #SuperBowlLII
Dundee = all the Australian hot people I love with their real accents + Danny McBride. I am so on board. #SuperBowlLII
YOU HAD ONE JOB. #SuperBowlLII
@ComfortablySmug 😂
Was that just our house or was that a really ineffective, expensive reminder to be mindful? #SuperBowlLII #blackout
I am always up for slow-motion jazz hands in #SuperBowlLII. Better if it’s an interception.
It’s too much math to figure out how all these missed opportunities are going to haunt everyone later. Who has an abacus? #SuperBowlLII
I don’t like those colorful, tear-drop shaped markers of the downs on the field (if they’ve been there all season, they didn’t bug me til now). Is this the Lisa Frank #SuperBowlLII?
I CAME HERE TO KICK SUCCESSFUL CHIP-SHOT FIELD GOALS AND ASS AND I’M ALL OUT OF BOTH, said all the teams. #SuperBowlLII
Welp, I guess the Pats will lose by 2  now. That stuff will always come back to haunt you...is a very obvious thing I would say if I were calling this game. #SuperBowlLII
TFW you’re gonna have some highlight reel but you get nutzed instead. #SuperBowlLII
America wants to do the Dew but feel like it’s dignified and maybe even healthy. CLEAR DEW WITH MORGAN FREEMAN. BOOM. #SuperBowlLII
Cannot let Tom Brady have someone back there like that. Makin’ it too easy...is a very obvious thing I would say if I were calling this game. #SuperBowlLII
@bbeltz1 I did!
Welp, I guess the Eagles will lose by 1 now. That’ll always come back to haunt you...is a very obvious thing I’d say if I were calling this game. #SuperBowlLII
@KSoltisAnderson The @FDRLST audience will love this, @bdomenech.
This made me interested and I’m rarely interested in “Star Wars.” I’m a Star Pacifist and Glover gonna make me an Star interventionist. https://t.co/eQQg4ok8pz
Why has no one every told Bob Kraft French cuffs are, by definition, unAmerican?
A FG is not what the Patriots wanted out of this, but they are on the board and we have a tied game...is a very obvious thing I would say if I were calling this game.
@WildBillHitcoch It’s kinda my thing.
A FG is not what the Eagles wanted out of this, but they are on the board first...is a very obvious thing I would say if I were calling this game.
This is the best Sunday night awards show.
@MKahn84 Nah, it was convoluted.
Haha, I was a bigger girl then. https://t.co/u7UUaiBybY
I think I’ve told that story on Twitter before but it always makes me smile.
And he’d shout in practice every day for years, “Danielle! Danielle! Get over here!” And Dannell would always roll up saying “Yes, Coach” with a little smile on his face.
@ellerbe59 Back in the day, he was a tall, thin WR. I always knew he was a sweet kid bc the very good, kind, but elderly coach could never get his name right...
Haha, OMG, I’m so behind just realized @ellerbe59 plays for the Eagles now. I covered him in high school. He was smaller back then, nice guy, then a Dawg. So cool.
@genpopadopolous @guypbenson Yeah, sounds like sneering at her.
@d_hureau @guypbenson Correction: AP
@bruhoho @d_hureau @guypbenson Excuse me on the mistake on the outlet. You’re correct!
@Maxxxxxxxxxxed @d_hureau @guypbenson It’s pretty IN touch with people who like to have their Costco membership taken care of by a tax cut they thought they weren’t getting.
@d_hureau @guypbenson The universe in which normal people tell the NYT they like it bc it pays for their Costco membership?
@cfvarano That story is LEGITIMATELY AWFUL. I’ve read about it but haven’t written on it. Good idea.
@SonnyBunch @NoahPollak @scottlincicome Who say it’s strangers? Is your wife a stranger, @SonnyBunch? No, &amp; she might appreciate a balanced carton, secure in the knowledge all eggs held therein will remain whole until a time of her choosing.
@cfvarano You must be new here.
I think some think this is an argument in support of federal agencies &amp; against theories of their indulgences in abuses of power when it is definitely not that. https://t.co/wrNnVWX91T
RT @guypbenson: Ryan quoted a woman expressing her surprise and gratitude over a very modest tax cut that Democrats said she’d never get. S…
@scottlincicome @NoahPollak @SonnyBunch Does Sonny never take carton out of the fridge &amp; move it to counter? He’s acting as if he just empties it IN the fridge. If you’re gonna move it, balanced carton is optimal carton to handle, for anyone w any level of coordination.
RT @matthewfederman: Having a baby is like living with a velociraptor &amp; every day is the scene where it figures out how to turn a handle as…
@BiasedGirl That’s the way love goes, it goes, goes, it goes.
@hopefulhanna @HarvardIOP @guypbenson Thanks for coming!
@NoahPollak THANK YOU. Balance is of the utmost importance.
We always forget to take one AT the event. Thanks @harvardiop &amp; students for great Qs, even at 9am on Sun, which is basically Sat night in college time! https://t.co/dBXxlbhokl https://t.co/3ZHZkgsYvg
Heading home after quick trip to @HarvardIOP to talk free speech! Thank you for having us! Escaping the impact zone bf a Pats Super Bowl appearance. Ha. https://t.co/aZOpPnDu3z https://t.co/yWC7DavwrZ
@AllisonMcClell8 @jaketapper READING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND EVALUATING BASED ON RELATIVE CREDIBILITY INCLUDES THE MEMO. That’s “as much as possible!” We agree!
@AllisonMcClell8 @jaketapper Literally a sentence in the piece that says the opposite of what you just asserted I wrote.
@AllisonMcClell8 @jaketapper The one about “why is she comparing” is the whole point of the piece. Happy reading!
Awesome. https://t.co/nim1NX7Vvv
@AwakeandSober I am also not a fan of them, but they’re a crowd-pleaser apparently bc they’re everywhere.
@dc84pt92 Nahhh.
Send this to your n00b football friends before your Super Bowl party! https://t.co/tCoMmKCy8A
Maintain balance, you monster. https://t.co/sgGkuLlhGi
Thanks! https://t.co/WbkFmTG789
@bethanyshondark Whispers *boxing still exists and MMA, the more brutal lovechild of the two is very popular.*
Memo, released: https://t.co/4qtCDSb4L5
@JonathanLingo Ahh, I see. That one caption does make it look like an extra down. I thought you were referring to the actual writing. I changed it!
@JonathanLingo There are two options for a fourth down, are there not? If I hadn’t mentioned both, you’d be picking on that. Take care!
@JonathanLingo But let’s face it. Edith probably turned the ball over on downs.
@JonathanLingo There are four downs, total. “After three unsuccessful tries at 10 yards, a team will usually elect to use its fourth try to punt the ball.” It’s covered.
@JonathanLingo Your question is?
@BiffTannen34 Yes, obviously, or I wouldn’t be able to translate from one language to another.
@Tracinski Haha, it is a two-way translator.
Don’t know football? You probably do know “Downton Abbey.” If the “Jeopardy” guys had read this, they’d have won more money. https://t.co/tCoMmKCy8A
