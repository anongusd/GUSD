@Madelei69579894 Hi Madeline
not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death,
Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,  covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their  women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the  creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of  their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful;
even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and  unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
Happy Resurrection Day to all.It ain't about the Easter Bunny.......Its about Jesus Christ bringing abundant life to the world!!!!!!!!

Who will take a stand?
the day of the LORD's anger.
Seek the LORD, all you humble of the land, do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day
Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.
Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
To God be the glory ..Great things he has done!!!
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him ,shall not perish but have everlasting life!!!
Seek you first the Kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness and all other things will be added unto you!!!!!
