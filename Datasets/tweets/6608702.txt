Insightful commentary from Anna Navarro "I was impressed by the entire debate" ..she then says that Lincoln Chafee added "a lot of red meat"

I keep seeing people tweet that Hillary Clinton killed tonight. They must be referring to September, 11th 2012?
@AmeliaHammy i can never figure out how to work this kick phone...
Van Jones said Hillary was like Beyonce tonight. I think more like Brittany Spears: she peaked in the 90s, but is still on a stage in Vegas.
@AmeliaHammy maybe more of a Brittany Spears. She peaked in the 90s, but she's still on a stage in Vegas. ....oh, i need to tweet that out.
@MDuppler That sounds like a scary place.
Van Jones just said that Hillary Clinton was Beyonce tonight. I've always seen her more as a Solange...
@gusportela @CRNC @LincolnChafee in fairness to him, he said 99-5 before he said 92-5, before he said 90-5. #MetricSystem
One reason Lincoln Chafee wants America to adopt the Metric System is to make it harder to measure how poorly he did in the debate tonight.

@IBEW570 You might want to look up you LM-2 Annual Disclosure on the Department of Labor website. @jasonahart
@IBEW570 also, you took more than $1million in dues last year, but only spent 22% on representational activities? Amazing. @jasonahart

@IBEW570 I can proudly say that Franklin Center has different aims than any group across the political spectrum. @jasonahart
@IBEW570 that would be lovely if you could. @jasonahart
@IBEW570 but once again, that is a different organization. Not us. Thank you, try again. @jasonahart
@IBEW570 when have we ever argued they didn't? u have some really strained logic going on. How does that make us Koch funded? @jasonahart
@IBEW570 we bought some booths at conferences in the past - how does that make us Koch funded? @jasonahart
@IBEW570 in fact, we tout that extensively.  @jasonahart
@IBEW570 So our essential allegation now is that the Kochs are Franklin funded. @jasonahart
@IBEW570 This shows no funding ties &amp; most of this is baseless/false. Provide evidence, not links to unsubstantiated allegations @jasonahart
@IBEW570 Texas Watchdog is it's own 501c3 organization and no longer operates, but nice try. @jasonahart

Obama: "it's not the size of your economy, it's what you do with it." #sotu
So far my favorite part of the #sotu was when @KristineInDC made me mini corn dogs.
Obama wants to defend us against cyber attacks - I guess be still thinks Benghazi was motivated by a YouTube video...
Obama made America more safe, mainly due to the fact that Benghazi is not in America. #sotu
"Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote twice." #sotu
I lost my health insurance - where's my #SOTU shout out from Obama?
Let people keep their plan if they like it
Allow plans to compete across state lines
Repeal the medical device tax
"Obamacare is a success, let me tell you two anecdotes that prove this." #Sotu
"If you like your plan, you can keep it"
Did Obama just merge the words "home" and "ownership" into "homership"? #sotu
Is Obama stuttering, or did the TelePrompTer freeze? #SOTU
Obama proposes a 10.10 minimum wage. Stand by for Herman Cain's 9.99 response. #SOTU
Obama railed against unequal pay for women. How are his female staffers compensated relative to make counterparts?
"Did I tell you the one about the pizza shop owner who made some dough ...hiyo! Am I right?" #SOTU
Rosa Delauro (D - Hipster) is going wiiiiiild in the crowd over equal pay.
Obama believes students should borrow large sums of money and not be burdened by having to pay it back. You can't say he's not consistent...
Obama says a child's education is too priority, only 2nd to a teacher's union. #AmplifyChoice
Obama 2008: "Time for change!" Obama 2014: "but change is hard..."
Glad Obama wants Joe "you can only work at Dunkin' Donuts w/ an Indian accent" Biden to head up immigrant job training...
Obama just claimed that global warming is fact, that he wants the economy to thrive, and shrink the deficit...
When John Boehner wears a green tie, against the backdrop of his red face, he looks like Christmas.

It's sad to see Obama and the MSM in such a messy breakup. I really thought those kids would make a go of it.
Nothing says SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES like forcing the IRS Acting Director to resign two months before he already announced he was leaving...
Obama thinks there might be a partisan agenda behind the investigation into his IRS's partisan agenda...
Who should the next IRS Director be?
Just because employees at the IRS were doing online research about tea bagging, doesn't mean they were targeting conservative groups...
Given the Administration's lack of transparency, somebody should start a Snapchats from Hillary meme...

Rubio had great substance. At times had passionate deliver, but overall seemed nervous. As we learned from Jindal, delivery matters.
@Klstok I liked his substance, he was just clearly nervous. Unfortunately, for this kind of speech, delivery matters more than it should.
Time magazine called Rubio the Republican savior. Saviors walk on water, Rubio seems to have trouble even drinking some...
