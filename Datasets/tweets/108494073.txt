TRANSPRENCY IN CALIFORNIA		SHOULD ALSO BE NATIONALLY		‚ÄúWe have spent millions of dollars up and down the state in all our local jurisdictions to deploy body cameras and record the footage,‚Äù said Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco). ‚ÄúThis would provide greater transparency
Part 2		‚Äù Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at Cal State L.A. member of Black Lives Matter movement, said in a statement. ‚ÄúSB 1421 will finally shine a bright light on whether and how police departments are holding officers accountable for these abuses of power
Part 1	‚ÄúFor years, black, brown, indigenous, and poor communities have been subjected to systemic harassment, violence and brutality by police but left little recourse to pursue justice,
Supporters of SB 1421 hailed the decision as a move toward increased trust between law enforcement and the public. The backdrop of Black Lives Matter and other movements pushing for changes in the criminal justice system helped move the transparency measure forward, they said.
CITIZENS HAVE TO INSIST THIS MUST BECOME		NATIONALLY REGISTRY		California‚Äôs existing rules protecting the confidentiality of misconduct records not only prohibit the public from seeing them, but also deny prosecutors direct access ‚Äî a standard that exists in no other state
CALIFORNIA		Skinner‚Äôs measure, Senate Bill 1421, would begin to unwind a confidentiality law passed four decades ago by opening records from investigations of officer shootings and other major force incidents, along with confirmed cases of sexual assault and lying while on duty
CALIFORNIA LEADING WAY IN COP ABUSE		The bills ‚Äúopen up some transparency to help rebuild that trust between law enforcement and communities,‚Äù said Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), author of the open-records bill. ‚ÄúPublic safety requires the cooperation and trust of a community.‚Äù
TRANSPRENCY IN CALIFORNIA	POLICE ABUSE AND BRUTLITY		Supporters of legislation, which must be signed by governor to become law, said it would boost confidence in law enforcement at a time when multiple disputed police incidents have led to protests in California and nationwide
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT POLICE ABUSE AND BRUTLITY		Legislators approved two landmark measures late Friday, one that would give the public access to internal investigations of police shootings statewide, and another that would allow the release of body camera footage of those incidents
TRANSPARENCY ABUSE		Endorsing a dramatic departure from decades of secrecy surrounding policing in state, California lawmakers have moved to undo some of nation‚Äôs strictest rules keeping law enforcement records confidential, particularly involving officer killings of civilians

Impact of the Fight for $15: $68 Billion in Raises, 22 Million Workers via @NelpNews https://t.co/zhoFCs7liO
Here is the bottom line: Instead of us having a Congress that listens to wealthy campaign contributors, it is about time we had a Congress fighting to create an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just those on top.
The House should pass legislation to expand Social Security benefits and extend its solvency for the next 60 years by requiring that the wealthiest Americans ‚Äî those making more than $250,000 a year ‚Äî pay their fair share of Social Security taxes
Expanding Social Security. When 1 out of 5 seniors is trying to get by on less than $13,500 a year, we must expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity and security.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
The House should pass the College for All Act to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially reduce student debt.
Every young person in America, regardless of income, must have the opportunity to receive the education they need to get a decent job and make it into the middle class.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
Making public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially reducing student debt. In a highly competitive global economy, we must have the best-educated workers in the world.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
It should also pass legislation to make sure that Americans don‚Äôt pay more for prescription drugs than citizens do in other major countries
The House should pass legislation to require Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and allow patients, pharmacists and wholesalers to purchase low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other countries.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
Lowering the price of prescription drugs. Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because, unlike other countries, the United States doesn‚Äôt directly regulate the price of medicine.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
Congress should pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to address these needs while creating up to 15 million good-paying jobs in the process
The structures that most Americans don‚Äôt see are also in disrepair ‚Äî from spotty broadband and an outdated electric grid, to toxic drinking water and dilapidated levees and dams.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
A $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Every day, Americans drive to work on potholed roads and crumbling bridges, and ride in overcrowded buses and subways. Children struggle to concentrate in overcrowded classrooms. Workers are unable to find affordable housing.....		MORE CONTINUE&gt;
It is unacceptable that there are large, extremely profitable corporations in this country that do not pay a nickel in federal income taxes
Progressive tax reform. At a time of massive and growing inequality in both income and wealth, Congress must pass legislation which requires wealthy people and large corporations to begin paying their fair share of taxes.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
more than 11 million people in our country who are undocumented. And that‚Äôs exactly what we should do
Comprehensive immigration reform. The American people want to protect the young people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to move toward comprehensive immigration reform for the ....		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
Fixing our broken criminal-justice system. We must end the absurdity of the United States having more people in jail than any other country on Earth. We must invest in jobs and education for our young people, not more jails and incarceration.
Congress must pass legislation that shifts our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and renewable energy. We can lead the planet in combating climate change and, in the process, create millions of good paying jobs.
Bold action to combat climate change. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear we have just 12 years to substantially cut the amount of carbon in our atmosphere, or our planet will suffer irreversible damage.		MORE CONTINUE READING &gt;
Over the first year, it would lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 55, cover dental, hearing and vision care for seniors, provide health care to every young person in the United States and lower the cost of prescription drugs.
Medicare-for-all. The Medicare-for-all bill widely supported in the Senate has a four-year phase-in period on the way to guaranteeing health care for every man, woman and child.		MORE CONTINUE &gt;
Minimum wage to $15 an hour and indexing it to median wage growth thereafter. Current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage	This would give more than 40 million Americans a raise and would generate more than $100 billion in higher wages throughout the country
