@jangaye That’s so wonderful Auntie
@KevinARing Also what is the risk assement formula that will be used? How are we sure it is not bias towards minorities ? And what information will the FBOP use to make those assessments?

We can last forever come on baby won't you hold on to me ...
The right thing and the easy thing are rarely the same thing ...
Everything is falling together perfectly, even though it looks as if some things are falling apart ...
There are things we don't want to know but have to learn
There are things that we don't want to happen but have to accept
What you do every day matters more than what you do every once in a while #thepowerofhabit
Someone else doesn't have to be wrong for you to be right
Sometimes people don't notice the things others do for them until they stop doing it
People are more what they hide than what they show
When you stop chasing the wrong things you give the right things a chance to catch you
Giving up doesn't always mean you're weak ... Sometimes it means u are strong enough &amp; smart enough to let go &amp; move on
Sometimes you have to distance yourself to see things clearly
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together
Sometimes you have to be apart from people you love ...

It will continue to plant the seeds of racial supremacism in the hearts and minds of millions of people ...
long as this culture keeps painting Adam, Eve, &amp; Jesus white, despite the obvious...
If "America" wants 2 eliminate racism. Tell the truth about JESUS's color. Since biblical teachings was what inspired the founding fathers.
Ask yourself ... Why is the new world afraid of the truth?
This white Jesus that predominates in this culture makes absolutely no sense, except for a white supremacist agenda
Why does this false image of a white Jesus Christ appear everywhere we look? .
I have heard people say, Why does it matter what color Jesus Christ was? If it doesn't matter, why has the truth been hidden.
Imagine how differently The new world would be if we embraced the truth.... that JESUS was a man of color.

Can you remember who u were before the world told u who u should be?  Stop living for other people and their opinions.  Be true to YOU. ✊💯
You are not obligated to anyone more so than you are to yourself...
Expectations just get in the way of great life experiences...
First and foremost, you are not obligated to live up to everyone’s expectations.
Your needs matter too.  Don’t ignore them.  Sometimes you have to do what’s best for you and your life, not what’s best for everyone else.
You can walk with me but never in my shoes
