Question of the day: would you shield your child for $0.02 a day or $5.00 for the entire school year? The equivalent price of a box of crayons or a meal? We have brainstormed and have in fact come up with the... https://t.co/wytwIm9uzQ

@ILSenDems we welcome you to explore what many are saying could be the best all inclusive Active Shooter Shield and training tool app to hit the market. We have many Florida and Utah based beta participants lined up. Would like to be part of it? It's free. 	#gotshield https://t.co/Vbxp1SpZEs

Horrific!! Sadly, this is further proof that even though an event can happen a certain location, a shield must always be in place after that said event to assure it never happens again. 	#gotshield #activeshooter #sandyhook 	Shooter Shield App
Everyone should also be lobbying for a universal shield to help protect society while we wait for a change. There is no significant movement for this. We all can voice the need for change, bit we need to protect ourselves while doing so!	#activeshooter #gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/iIOW6bfDL7
@DierksBentley while we all work towards ending gun violence, we have a solution that will shield society while we wait for our voices to be heard. As of today, there is nothing in place that will protect us in the interim. Please join our movement. :)	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/rfvO0lgr4e
Can we agree that a protection and shield should be in place for #activeshooter events while society waits for their voices to be heard? The Shooter Shield, at the very minimum, can start saving lives, prevent injuries and scale our state of readiness! 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/jcYgvQMb9l
We can't wait to introduce the Shooter Shield into the workplace. No other app will even come close to the dozens of functions geared towards the preparation and readiness of active shooter events.	#gotshield #workplaceviolence #activeshooter #massshooting  @ShooterShield https://t.co/vvyaJqAWwe
When the Shooter Shield launches, parties evacuating would be automatically accounted for. Making the job of law enforcement that much simpler to control logistics. Just one of the dozens of benefits packed into our upcoming app.	@ShooterShield  #activeshooter #gotshield https://t.co/Rb1U0MoQwL
Even false "calls" or fake events catch everyone off guard. We need to be ready-- all the time! 	#activeshooter #gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/ar4eVlF30G

https://t.co/O71w7yCkIH
FACT: User location and injury status within an active shooter event have been lacking. Our Shooter Shield location function is a gamechanger. 	#gotshield #activeshooter @ShooterShield https://t.co/EWAN2HcBEO
Can't wait to help out the preparation worldwide. Create live simulations. Involve all of the parties. Research the data from said simulation. Rinse and repeat. #gotshield #ActiveShooter @ShooterShield https://t.co/zSkAdHeW1y
The sad part about this is they typically do NOT know how many shooters there are. Who's the shooter? Who are the innocent? Soon they will know much better, and they should, with The Shooter Shield. 	#gotshield @ShooterShield  #ActiveShooter #MassShooting https://t.co/7pENrkpJ7N
Not again :(	#gotshield https://t.co/1cCTJKhSfv
Our app will help boost that plan! It's time society elevated their preparation beyond what's available.	#gotshield #activeshooter @ShooterShield #massshooting https://t.co/G9PX9qQvFp
We could also increase the awareness and preparation while limiting injuries and even, sadly, deaths. Something must be done!	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/RksECDoPjK
We're working a solution that will unite parties in &amp; outside of an active shooter event. We would love to collaborate with your agency Chief. Society may not be able to prevent an event, the very least we can do is prepare and shield others from them. 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/qN46OxP55w
We agree! Stay tuned, our launch is coming in early 2019! https://t.co/Oqt2QsKx2Y
We're also working towards that standard and would love to collaborate.	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/xqwdFvIuMs
We would love to add our free shield to your training. Many other agencies are already standing by for our beta launch in early 2019. @gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/erecwy3ahz
Great point Matthew. And we agree that businesses and workplaces are in fact vulnerable. Which is why our upcoming launch of the Workplace Shield is geared towards every business location in the world.	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/cKszU8Vtmp
We agree congressman, but until something is actually done our leadership must start shielding society. It's the very least our elected officials can do while everyone continues to debate gun control. Help us shield society Congressman. Thank you!	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/gFMrnKN6SA
The numbers are staggering. Its time to stop fighting amongst each other and work together to shield society from active shooter events. Its the least we can do!	#gotshield Shooter Shield App https://t.co/h7kq7Ue8VG
The numbers don't lie. Its time society starting taking some action. While gun control lobbying is abundant, we have to do something in the meantime to shield ourselves! For more information on our upcoming beta,... https://t.co/3RwDEupfYQ
We are happy to announce that the release of our Shooter Shield APP will occur in January of 2019! Join our revolution, and let's shield the world, one location, and one person at a time!	#gotshield @gotshield @shootershield #activeshooter https://t.co/nVWYFVvlVa
Very true. We're teaching teachers and parents how to shield their kids with our Shooter Shield App. 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/ZbGmEg8NAD
Our Shield will provide peace of mind. Please take a look at what's coming soon! We've already been told this is a parents wish come true. But until our gun control voices are heard we have to have a shield in place for our kids!	#gotshield @ShooterShield  @momsdemand @Everytown https://t.co/gGqGJk5VEy
All first responders should have the shield! Elevate training, decrease injuires, boost readiness! #gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/TtsyHd6iek
We'd like to propose a 4th option-- The Shooter Shield. Coming in January. 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/6Dlev7Rlz1
They will be better prepared with The Shooter Shield!! 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/A0FMvGYyk4
Our Shooter Shield APP will, in fact, decrease the anxiety associated with these drills while increasing the level of readiness! #gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/PvOggxIaDH
Wow! Thousand Likes! Thank you! Word is catching on!	#gotshield Shooter Shield App https://t.co/0HciE3NqI7
Another horrific event in Tallahassee, just days after we spoke about another active shooter event in the same area. Besides schools &amp; colleges, there will be other shields for:  Workplace, Retail, High Rise, Resorts, Hospital's, Sporting Arena's &amp; more	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/NRiDrzjwrB
Sadly these will not end. We're working hard to get the shield ready for EVERY college campus in the world. We won't rest until we do.	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/If2GInb4MW
Check out our first intro video!	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/jtr37EJcWv
College's must and will be shielded. 	Timeliness is of the essence. If there was an active shooter at a campus building, every second would count! Timeliness is just one of the dozens of functions packed into The Shooter Shield.	#gotshield @ShooterShield #gonoles https://t.co/xF3am584rd
Sadly "readiness" is the new normal. 	Which is why its our mission to set the bar when it comes to readiness and response.	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/NFVz2Ju9tT
Would love to help that preparation. And what we're bringing to the table is already getting some amazing feedback from first responders. Our beta starts in just a couple of months. Get the tools you "don't have.."	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/1bCuP2NxxK
Its sad but great to see everyone training. We would love to add an amazing tool to that training! All school licenses will be FREE. 	#gotshield @ShooterShield https://t.co/eJoLN3GQgK
No matter where in the world, The Shooter Shield will do it's job! We must elevate our readiness and response!!!!	#gotshield https://t.co/spkdZeuZdm

No matter the side people take, armed campuses may never live up to the expectations society would have even if they were armed. But by adding the many functions of our app we could improve the odds for everyone involved in an active shooter event #gotshield https://t.co/L9PrgHkIf5

Truly a VERY scary situation at the MGM. Sadly it also shows the lack of structure and how chaotic things could turn very quickly whether or not the event was a prank or real. Our Shooter Shield is designed to alert the... https://t.co/R2fgtFmefX
Encouraging all PTO's to reach out to us as soon as they can. We have a soluton that will in fact prepare school's, staff and students like never seen before. Best part, real-time first responder and medic interfaces.	#gotshield https://t.co/YrlkYQ15l1
ANOTHER Horrific event. Our Shield will be available worldwide in 2019!	#gotshield https://t.co/wXL9hWlA0Z
Yes, every minute counts. But we're taking it one step further and saying every second counts which is why we developed the Shooter Shield for active shooter events, terrorist event, fires, and much more! Coming in January, 2019!	#gotshield https://t.co/vMBnS6yhNM
We are! Coming in January :)	#gotshield https://t.co/oIYq9urlEv
Add this to the pile of why a comprehensive solution such as The Shooter Shield is absolutely needed. #gotshield #shieldschools #shieldworkplaces #shieldoffices #shieldhighrises #andmore. https://t.co/B7JgMbqSGI
Yes. Our Shooter Shield will be military ready! #gotshield https://t.co/lyaqzRWiXP
With Shooter Shield you'll be able to create custom simulations including shooter path, student locations, who &amp; where the injured are, types of injury, administer medical aid before medics are granted access and creating comms w/ authorized admins &amp; emergency contacts #gotshield https://t.co/JWky4REfXo
With the Shooter Shield, law enforcement would be able to assess the situation faster, locate all employees and track the shooter. 	Below is another example why we need the Shooter Shield.	#gotshield https://t.co/jdxH4UFy5j
Good to see (and sad at the same time) this happening everywhere. Now imagine training with customized &amp; "programmed" simulations in schools using the "Shield?" Its coming. #gotshield https://t.co/Qb4BG9cUl8
The School Shield! This shield app will focus on shielding our kids &amp; the faculty who watch over them. This Shield unites students, administrators, police, medics &amp; parents during a real-time shooter event. Coming Jan 2019! For info please visit https://t.co/df0cmE4QkM	#gotshield https://t.co/n9MbCfnUyE
@MercedesCardona @sandyhook @StandWParkland @GunControlNowUS Reality is that's not going to happen anytime soon. Something must be done to deter &amp; protect so lives can be saved during a shooter event. Gun control will also not aid the injured or help 1st responders provide emergency aid to the injured during an event. We can. #gotshield
