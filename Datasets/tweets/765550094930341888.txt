@SenPatRoberts also told reporters the conservation title is still in the works and if that’s resolved “we could have a bill ready by Monday.”
@SenStabenow told me today “we actually have had some good conversations today so we feel like maybe some things are moving.”
ICYMI: Yesterday seemed tense for farm bill negotiatiors. But today lawmakers seemed much more optimistic.

@collinpeterson says he wants to get a farm bill done during the lame-duck session. The conference committee could get a final report as early as next week if remaining issues are resolved: @BGOV subscribers can read details here: https://t.co/dcWQLJhKAR
@RepGoodlatte is retiring and @RepLujanGrisham and @RepTimWalz ran for governor positions. 		The big question is if dems will try to stall during lame duck and wait until the new Congress to write their own farm bill without the SNAP work requirements proposed in the House bill.
House: Flipped to Dem majority meaning @collinpeterson will likely become ag cmte chairman. Making @ConawayTX11 the likely ranking member.		At least five spots will open on the committee because @RepJohnFaso lost his race and @USRepRickNolan didn’t run for relection.
