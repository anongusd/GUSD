@golfbollox @OldMarine1 @POTUS Not butthurt just puzzled by the clinging to the ignorant untrue excuse to build a totally unnecessary wall. A wall that will not work, just like any one who lives in a gated community knows, crime finds a way around wall.
@golfbollox @OldMarine1 @POTUS Let me be clear DJT is the modern version of a very badly conceived PT Barnum you guys are the #SUCKERS ,just sad.
@golfbollox @OldMarine1 @POTUS I am making no excuses for any crime, you are projecting your opinion of me and it is driven by your narrative, not based in fact.
@MartinTate2 @OldMarine1 I just laugh and laugh at the self righteous claptrap spouting idiocy about immigration. I am sure the Native Americans would love to have been able to voice their objections and been heard. The Hispanics occupied this land long before we showed up also. #History

@cosumo164 Nope , you have forgotten that I am American too. That my voice matters as much as yours, something you took an oath to protect but seem to have forgotten, hence my other statement.
@OldMarine1 No nationality is immune to racism. I know POC who are as racist as they as they can be,  but it still does not make it right!
@OldMarine1 Yes you are, everyone of you that believes a boondoggle wall will solve any Humanitarian crisis.
@OldMarine1 Why do you listen to AlexJones  conspiracy theories? Not because they are true but only because it fits your narrative. Even Alex Jones does not believe the shit he spews, and spouting that shit cost him his children .

@OldMarine1 Eight years,  miliions of tax dollars, your teatard buddy Trey Gowdy, found NOTHING! Blame him why don't you ? He is still responsible for supplying you the trough of lies you slop from daily!  Why are you not questioning him?
@OldMarine1 Again just because you personally don't like HRC (I do not like her either) does not mean that what you chose to believe about her is true. It just fits your narrative . Or you understand the written word is being twisted and You choose to believe lies.

@thebigjman57 @ottawajake @OldMarine1 Ok your turn, my idea of a true patriot comes in the form of my Congressional Representative Stephanie Murphy Look her up. You and the ilk following you are not Patriots! In my book you are the problem.

@OldMarine1 You started this,! LOL!
@JWCforAmerica @OldMarine1 It is a shame you are following racists and bigots as former service members. Try following @RepStephMurphy my Congressional Representative if you want to see true military values in action.
@OldMarine1 You are talking about Trump, Kushner, Pompeo  right?
@OldMarine1 One of them is my District 7 Congressional Representative, Stephany Murphy. Look up her military record and get back to me. She is what a military person represents in American values, not you, not any of you so called Patriots pandering to Trumpism.
@OldMarine1 And yet here we are, I never backing down, something you should understand. You may think that your brand of racist Military horseshit scares me , it does not. I know to many Vets and service people who do not subscribe to lies
