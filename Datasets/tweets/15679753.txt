https://t.co/dVoM9aLh0b https://t.co/DyngGnX7W0
@eva_wisner @AppleSupport Agreed. My father was even told by his scammers to tell the sales clerk at the Apple store the gift cards were for personal use. I asked him if the Apple clerk had pressed him - &amp; told him about scams - would he have paused - and he said yes.
takeaway is please be vigilant w/your parents/grandparents. Give them all the information available about scams. Don‚Äôt assume they‚Äôre not vulnerable, even if they‚Äôre otherwise sharp citizens. And don‚Äôt assume @AppleSupport gives a damn.
Update: The gift card numbers were redeemed - of course - at another Apple store in NH. So Apple sold $7200 worth of its merch to a thief, today and my 81 yo dad paid for it. Apple knows this is a problem &amp; was complicit. @AppleSupport.

@CaryVabreeze @bhaydon5 @AppleSupport Yep. My sister (lawyer) and I are on it...
@BrianMc_Fadden Right? There‚Äôs an inherent confusion, which is easily exploited. üôÅ
@chrisbeffa @AppleSupport Understood. But a simple ‚Äúis this $7200 gift card for your grandkids?‚Äù Q at purchase could yield a valuable answer, given that it‚Äôs an extremely common scam, aimed (sadly) at primarily seniors.
And he‚Äôs from the analog world.
I should add: My dad is (thankfully) not senile. He‚Äôs physically and mentally sharp.  His problem is he‚Äôs kind - and too trusting. üôÅ
And if you think I‚Äôm upset - my dad was devastated when he found out he‚Äôd been ripped off. 	@AppleSupport @tim_cook your stores should be sharply vigilant over this.	Being a retiree in the US is hard enough.	 	It‚Äôs heartbreaking.
A quick online search shows this is a well documented issue globally. @AppleSupport you need to stop being passive accomplices to the ruthless scamming of senior citizens.
As you can imagine @tim_cook I am very upset. Seniors purchasing large $$ of gift cards at an apple store should trigger a red flag.
So: while being mercilessly scammed, my 81 yo dad dutifully went to his local Apple store and purchased $7200 worth of @AppleSupport gift cards to give to his scammer. Why is Apple selling $7200 in gift cards to a senior citizen without some red flag protocol? üò°

@areynoldsbooks Duude.
My patriotism runs ocean deep. I choke up every time I read the 1st amendment, which encapsulates the principles - against all odds - of true human freedom.
Easy for me to forget that my act of thought, creativity, art - from which I derive so much enjoyment - can really piss a few people off. 		Which makes me a little sad sometimes. 		Sometimes.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling as a patriotic American. You don‚Äôt sound American on your greeting message, which makes your terrible cartoons seem even worse to me now...‚Äù		(I‚Äôve lived in the U.S. for 35 years.)
I could argue that‚Äôs both good - &amp; also pretty bad.
One thing is certain, more people than usual are highly animated/concerned w/the direction of our politics.
The fans kindly tend to say they love my work, and then offer up an idea of their own for a cartoon.		(In 25 years I‚Äôve never used another person‚Äôs idea.)		But I do appreciate hearing.
I could hear his wife in the background shouting instructions. ‚ÄúTell him he‚Äôs stupid!‚Äù
A fun ritual going through my VMs from my @NewsdayOpinion office (41 from Friday...)		About 50/50 fans vs. ‚Äúnon fans‚Äù		My favorite: ‚ÄúI usually skip your cartoon, sometimes tear them out so I don‚Äôt have to look at them - but THIS time you‚Äôve gone too far.‚Äù

@AnnTelnaes Oops. Guess I just wrote about it... üò¨
@AnnTelnaes Oh yes...Definitely. Very knowledgeable. But I was referring to how anyone can write about the complex, subjective social &amp; political effect of cartoons. For instance, I happen to know Colbert enjoys editorial cartoons, but he gets the ‚Äúinfluential‚Äù credit.
@AnnTelnaes TBH, I don't think anyone knows enough about editorial cartoons to write about them. Myself included.
Effluent and Influential. https://t.co/dVoM9aLh0b https://t.co/SzKjBYwCRC

@AnnTelnaes Today‚Äôs cartoons aren‚Äôt given enough credit for the power/influence they have (including btw, over Colbert, SNL writers etc.) And cartoons from the grand old days are wistfully given a little too much credit.
