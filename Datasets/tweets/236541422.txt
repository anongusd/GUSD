@patgriffin I always use the "free" term--free market, free enterprise, free minds--as opposed to "capitalism," though I deplore the necessity to avoid the latter, as it is a fine thing indeed. But we must swim in this rhetorical ocean, and swim faster than the competition!
@empowers35 @TheHRH @realDonaldTrump @IWF Fascinating take, given that science, intelligence, national security, and health and welfare are better served by welcoming all speech--@POTUS's goal--than by suppressing speech. 		You subconsciously project your own bias towards tyranny, the signal fallibility of the Left.

@dondan1943 Amazon certainly is capable of doing so--yet these incentives are offered all the time to all kinds of businesses. AMZ isn't alone. And, alas, NY's confiscatory, predatory, crony-favoring, vote-buying, taxpayer-abusing government isn't alone either--it's just particularly bad!
The real #Amazon wake-up call is that NYS and NYC's cronyism and greedy profligacy--buying votes in all communities, not only those nominally most in need--raises cost of living for all, drives business and taxpayers away, and, yes, makes govt less effective in what it SHOULD do. https://t.co/wNbMYLN5ya

@SeiKenja82 Agreed strongly that the stigma needs to be eliminated!
@SeiKenja82 I'm sure it did, and there are instances of drug-seeking and of careless prescribing. But these can be identified. Genuine need for opioids should be managed appropriately. One big problem is that patients too frequently don't receive sufficient individualized attention, therapy.
@SeiKenja82 It most certainly doesn't work that way. Some patients need long-term opioids, along with other measures. Yes, if opioids can be avoided, that's optimal. But not always possible.
@SeiKenja82 Is it better now with change in administrations? What can someone like me, with medical and congressional background, do to help on policy/regulatory level?

@realGregKarnes True! But the awareness may come too late to prevent significant damage, particularly if they're seduced by the promise of cradle-to-grave entitlements--and coerced into complying with govt. managing our lives instead of embracing freedoms in the marketplace.

Good sense from @NoahCRothman: shutdown disruptions are not the model of how govt could, should be made more efficient https://t.co/mO5SHa2PM8 via @commentary
@LordStanTheSlam @SenWarren @TheDemocrats We're in agreement. Govt. does cause wealth inequality--not the only cause, but its coercive power is decisive. Used remaining letters to point to Venezuela, whose corrupt collapse was predictable. Restrained (per Constitution, brilliant document), transparent govt. is needed!
@LordStanTheSlam @SenWarren @TheDemocrats Respectfully, no, because it applies to the robber barons as well. Right now our problem isn't too much government--it's concentration of power in the government, which wastes capital and elevates elites at the expense of the non-elites. Restrained, transparent govt is needed.
@LordStanTheSlam @SenWarren @TheDemocrats *checks notes* a nice touch!	N.B. that the robber barons did have a very cozy relationship with government; they bought the politicians wholesale, which facilitated commandeering of resources and monopolization.	And, yes, there's an optimal level of regulation. We far exceed it.

@SeiKenja82 @SenCoryGardner @GOP Yes, representing a swing constituency is a political conundrum: your party is at odds with about half of your voters, which precludes being the poster child for your Party's agenda.

@PPJudkins @IWF Respectfully submitted, we get the legislators we get--and they'll strongly tend to rationalize special favors/access, particularly when suppliers/contractors/industrial concerns are in their districts or states. Government should assure our safety and liberty, not run our lives.

@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD @AOC Think of the methane that won't be produced by hogs and cows...
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD @AOC Precisely. Mass transit works well where the population is dense, and that's fine. Also, #GND'ers should consider carefully that zero-emissions nuclear power would allow us to have our own electric-powered conveyances with, pretty much, environmental impunity!
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD Damn straight! And there's nothing socialists think government wouldn't do better. They're desperately wrong--and the worst part is that inherently they must rope all of us into their schemes in order for them to "work."
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD Yep, they're gonna confiscate our cars. They're probably also contemplating limiting your screen time--think of the energy savings!
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD Proponents of #GND are thinking holistically--govt. administers all societal good. I think holistically too: minimizing the coercion to which we submit for sake of certain organizational benefits from govt., and maximizing individual freedom, leads to best outcomes in all things!

@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD Agreed completely! The #GreenNewDeal, no matter how well-intended, would engender cronyism, corruption, bloat, waste, and politicization--imposing unacceptable costs both financial and, no doubt, environmental as well, due to misdirection of capital and thwarted competition.
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD I in turn am relying on the expertise of @ShellenbergerMD, who is both knowledgeable and credible--and whose arguments for urgent action deserve to be heeded.
@SeiKenja82 @ShellenbergerMD Nuclear submarines have worked for decades; smaller nuclear facilities are possible with fourth-generation technology, which will facilitate more distributed production. We need these plants and we need battery technology to advance to improve electric vehicle capabilities.

With no disrespect meant from the title of @ShellenbergerMD's superb pr√©cis in @Forbes, below, tells us that dry-cask storage is exceedingly safe, and that newer-generation nuclear plants will be able to re-use spent fuel eventually. https://t.co/7C2itUuIu7 https://t.co/1jN2upXg4X

And we can't give up working towards better. Whenever there's a teaching moment, we can use it. Crucial to educate kids in civics, economics.
@LordStanTheSlam @Education4Libs Ditto! One last thought, if I may: one reason socialism tends to appeal to folks w/lesser-paying jobs is that govt's intervention in consumer sectors (healthcare, education, housing/mortgages, etc etc) has inflated cost of living. Better value for $$ w/more free market üòä

@RochelleRitchie @Education4Libs 2) Second, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's bewailing high rents in DC points up the problems that accompany rent control, which always drives up the cost of housing both to rent and to own--and disincentivizes appropriate investment in maintenance of properties. Democrats favor rent control.
@RochelleRitchie @Education4Libs 1) Rochelle, agreed--not using campaign funds, honesty laudable. That said, her ignorance should worry us--breathtaking that her airy "well, we just pay for it!" rhetoric re $multiTrillion misdirections of capital is coupled w/distinct lack of real-life problem-solving abilities.
@LordStanTheSlam @Education4Libs My pleasure, and I like yours too, and agreed DC rents are insane! Rent control will do that. Larger point's still taken, respectfully: Ms. O C has made abundantly clear her utter ignorance about fiscal policy and economics, and now that she's in office it's not cute anymore.

@TheWorldWatch @KatTimpf Agreed completely re communism and fascism, and, yes, that's exactly what i intend. Fundamentally the tactics we're talking about are antidemocratic, whatever we call them; need to be called out and opposed. I appreciate that we can discuss all of this respectfully--thank you!
@TheWorldWatch @KatTimpf Thanks for challenge. I take your point. I agree there's a strong authoritarian element at play, and I think you'll agree fascism's a form of authoritarianism. My word choice is a response to its appropriation by "Antifa," whose tactics belie their chosen moniker. They're "Pro."
@TheWorldWatch @KatTimpf Using coercion and threats of harm, or indeed actual violence--as we've seen across the country--to intimidate or silence your political rivals--particularly rivals like Kat who seek first and foremost to limit and reduce the power of govt over the individual--is fascist.
"Liberal" #fascism in action. To those who have fantasized that this is 1932 all over again and they have to stop the Nazis, look in the mirror and you'll see who the modern-day brownshirts really are. 	"Juden Raus" tactics should frighten all of us.	@KatTimpf https://t.co/3MKMpxJvlw

@GehringTed @KennedyNation @NancyPelosi For many reasons, yes. There's enormous demand for spending by citizens expecting more from govt than sensibly should. Politicized pensions/benefits, healthcare, education, housing/mortgages, govt "investments" bloat budgets, misdirect capital--and "buy" votes. Needs to stop.
@GehringTed @KennedyNation @NancyPelosi Econ's growing is deregulation, tax cuts. Yes, military spending up. It's excessive. Bad budget deal last yr let Dems dictate higher non-military spending because GOP didn't break filibuster on passing legislation in Senate. We do need big cuts--GOP more inclined to do than Dems.
@GehringTed @KennedyNation @NancyPelosi Agreed reasonable taxes should be paid, and full value for money should be rendered in return. I submit to you that we're far from the latter in any area of govt expenditure, for many reasons, but the main one is that govt's fiscal responsibility is attenuated--not "their" money.

@Chascabass It's not. I'm asserting that Democrats' fiscal and economic policies in particular--and that's a lot of policy--have harmed communities of color, as they have all of us. Would I prefer to be post-race, post-gender, post-identity? Yes but that's not to ignore history.

I hope you won't be disappointed to learn that Hayworth is my married name, actually a substitute for my husband's father's surname at birth, which was Haimowitz. Nonetheless very glad to warmly greet a fellow Hoosier--I'm from Munster!
@Chascabass MUCH more importantly, WE need policy to win! It's not about ME at all. It's about all of us.
@Chascabass If I didn't care about what you think I wouldn't respond! :)	I've answered as best I can. I do what I do for the sake of policy, working within limitations of a system run by human beings. I'm partisan because of policy, not because I need a team to "win." I need POLICY to win!
@Chascabass AGREED! Just answered. Need a LOT more. And we need education reform--something Dems resist with all their might because they're highly beholden to public-sector unions who insist on minimizing accountability, maximizing work rules that deliver less quality for more money. Wrong!
@Chascabass You and I agree re criminal justice reform. Overreach and oppression have occurred on both sides of the aisle. Rand Paul and others in GOP are rightly calling for massive reforms, are rightly working with Dems--and I support them.
@Chascabass I've had exposure to more info via my role on House Financial Services Cmte. Human beings respond to incentives and assess risk. When govt finances bad decisions with taxpayer dollars, you'll get lots of bad decisions--hence the 2008 crisis. ALL government-facilitated.
@Chascabass They'd've done better if they'd busted the filibuster on passing legislation. Directionally, they've helped us. More-empowered government is provably bad--increasing inequality and concentrating wealth. Decentralize, return power to citizens. That's GOP direction. Good!
@Chascabass Please focus on policy. Human nature is flawed everywhere. Focus on policy. Well-meaning people can promulgate really bad policy and they end up hurting us. You have a low opinion of 45, I understand. Yet he has done many things that have helped our citizens/nation to do better.
@Chascabass I don't endorse the Willie Horton ad. The President has correctly characterized some illegal immigrants (regardless of where they come from) as criminals, including rapists and murderers. That's not racism. He also supports path to citizenship for DACA beneficiaries. Not racist.
@Chascabass There's no "zero willingness." But there IS manipulation--all human beings are capable of it. 	I'm not racist, the Republican Party isn't racist, the President isn't racist. Period. 	Democrats' empowerment of government has been proven to work against the common good. Period.
@Chascabass 1) (and thank you for the kind praise, which I reciprocate to you) Because I know the President and I know that he is determined to help communities and people of color and he's done much work to do so.
@Chascabass Respectfully, they offer a lot of alternatives that get little attention amidst the barrage of noise that accompanies any suggestion that more government isn't the answer. The alliance between Dems and blacks should be uneasy; Dems' policies hurt communities of color.
@Chascabass The deaths by violence in urban communities get only glancing attention, and yet the numbers are appalling. Policies of the past, including recent decades, have hurt. Public-sector unions and federalized bureaucracies hurt. GOP fights them and I'm glad they do.
@Chascabass Dreadful, dreadful history--infuriating. Its importance is not to be diminished by partisan condemnation; it is a call to every one of us never to repeat it.		I do what I do because I aspire for us all to do better as individuals and as a society.
@Chascabass That's a reductio ad absurdum, not a stated reason. Whatever the reason for the caravans' participants to approach our border at locations other than points of entry, they are breaking our law, and it's appropriate to assure that our border is secure.
@Chascabass Not accepting that premise in any way, you're right about that. Not in any way.
@Chascabass I treat you as the intelligent and thoughtful person you are. I'm being entirely straightforward. And I'd like to convince you of the dangers of government overreach and intervention and predation, which make every other problem we face commonly as flawed human beings worse.
@Chascabass The GOP in ascendance post-2016 has not sought to pass sweeping legislation imposing massive new regulations that further empower the federal government. They've sought to transfer power to citizens. Very different.
@jjpetrillo The ultimate paragraph of the decision reiterates a narrow scope: https://t.co/fz6j8oAGej
@jjpetrillo @fernandalopezhn Understood as well, but that doesn't exclude other action to define the conditions of citizenship for those born in the U.S. to two parents who are present in contravention of U.S. law.
@Chascabass Au contraire--I condemn unreasonable expansion of/intervention by government wherever it exists, and I have said repeatedly that GOP is far from perfect. BUT it is DIRECTIONALLY better. And EVERYTHING will improve when citizens vote to restrain govt, which they don't do enough.
@Chascabass Agreed re the need for cooperation, but, again, I'm not acceding to boiling down important disagreements on policy to "team" dynamics. That trivializes policy.
@Chascabass Focus on identity is the Democrats' specialty and they do it to cling to power. They have offered no economically or educationally feasible or sensible solutions to disadvantaged communities. Why don't they reform public-sector unions failing urban communities?
@Chascabass Bad lending patterns were facilitated, encouraged by misbegotten policies--some well-meaning but wrong, others clearly manipulated by folks in power to assure that they gained even more wealth and power. Take away taxpayer indemnification of bad decisions and they'll find sense.
@Chascabass I'm not deflecting. Please share your thoughts on these facts.
@Chascabass The Republican Party is not racist; I am not racist. President Trump is not racist. These accusations are leveled by Left and by Democrats to distract everyone, but especially communities of color, from the glaring fact that GOP fiscal and economic policies work and Dems' don't.
@Chascabass You haven't addressed what I said earlier re Democrats' long and disgraceful history--and I neglected to mention their position in the Civil War. They have far more to regret and explain. Regardless, moving forward requires the best policy as opposed to self-flagellation per se.
@Chascabass We should indeed work together and many Ds and Rs are endeavoring to do so. But we're doomed to fail, either relatively or absolutely, to the extent that our citizens/voters, regardless of party, view government control as the primary means of achieving societal good. It's not.
@jjpetrillo @fernandalopezhn Understood, thanks.
@Chascabass IF Republicans were "racist," why would we be foursquare behind our black candidates and eager to bring black Americans into our party? Your contention has no basis at all.	What terrifies me is that Dems have no arguments beyond manipulation--and that's all it is--re identity.
@Chascabass It's not about sports. It's not an exercise in partisanship for partisanship's sake. I am supporting a policy agenda that will provide the greatest benefit to our citizens regardless of identity or geography or position in life. And I support the folks who support that agenda.
@fernandalopezhn 2) I'm a believer in and supporter of legal immigration, the laws governing which should be modernized. 	I also believe that we should pass a new Constitutional amendment to grant naturalized Americans the right to become President.
@fernandalopezhn 1) I'm the daughter of a proud nationalized American (and legal immigrant) who believes our Constitution is the most humane and empowering document of government ever created.
@Chascabass Actually, I was there, and we did work with Pres. Obama because he had to work with us to keep the government functioning. But prior to the 2010 election, he told the GOP that he got elected and they didn't, so there. Hence PPACA, failed "stimulus," Dodd-Frank. Partisan and bad.

@Chascabass The reason our cost of living is too high is because govt empowers certain entities in healthcare, housing/mortgages, education, energy, agriculture, etc to do things that allow them disproportionate benefit/access/profit. Overregulation distorts markets and inflates costs.
@Chascabass I was one of those who sought to counter President Obama's and the Democrats' agenda--not for the sake of obstructing because they're the Red Sox and I'm the Yankees. It's because they were doing a lot of things wrong and they were hurting people more than they were helping.
@fernandalopezhn @jjpetrillo Respectfully, it is what you said: "proscribes by." 		To "proscribe" is to prohibit.
@Chascabass Respectfully, you keep missing my point: REDUCE the power of government to minimize this phenomenon, which is AT LEAST as prevalent among Dems if not more so because they're the party of government. 	This is NOT sports! And to the extent folks fail to recognize that, we suffer!
@Chascabass Much evidence that various of his businesses have lost money during his Presidency. He didn't become President to enrich his properties. President Obama conferred great influence (Secretary of COMMERCE) on the Pritzker family, the owner of Hyatt. Was that wrong?
@Chascabass "Swamp friends" exist EVERYWHERE. That's human nature. My goodness! You just made my argument yourself! "Enriching with policy" is done by IMPOSING more regulations--the Democrats' specialty. No one's perfect; minimize corruption by disempowering government!
@Chascabass Deregulation's generally a good thing. Total deregulation is not something for which I argue. As I've said MANY times, I'm for strong and effective environmental protections. Note "effective" well. And I've also said that misdirection of resources to pensions/benefits hurts that.
@Chascabass Correction: Housing laws in the 1950s-through-1960s' "Urban Renewal" initiatives. Democrat-led.
@Chascabass We've talked about this before, a good while back. What we haven't talked about is the Democrats' history with the KKK; about the fact that they passed labor laws in the 1930s SPECIFICALLY to hurt black labor; about how they passed housing laws in the 1950s to hurt minorities.
@Chascabass Realistically, conservatives were targeted--absolutely disproportionately, and purposely. And the larger point is that the Democrats are unequivocally the Party of Government, and they misused the power of government. That should worry all of us.
To "proscribe" is to prohibit. I assume that's not what you meant.		The pamphlet was succeeded by the 14th Amendment, which is what applies here. Wong Kim Ark was narrowly phrased; Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 also proves that 14A did not assure universal Jus Soli. https://t.co/1Kz1582jTN
Check out threads in my feed re #14A today. They illustrate how folks on #Left resort to invective and emotional appeals when they lack arguments and evidence.		This is what they offer instead of effective policy and reasoned debate about crucial issues.		#VoteRed2018 https://t.co/AVW4YhbGCs
Calling "#racism" is not an argument; it's a tactic, one that has been deployed by the Left (with regard not only to race but to every form of identity) as a substitute for argument. 	It is entirely arguable that 14A and Wong Kim Ark do NOT prove Jus Soli in every instance. https://t.co/zuzdqvzs6Q
@fernandalopezhn It's not merely "my" Constitution, it's the Constitution of the United States of America, as Amended, and it does not grant a right to citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil. If it did, then the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 would not have been needed.
@fernandalopezhn Then I'll rephrase my previous request: please provide the language in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that corresponds to the language you quoted from, I presume, English law.
@fernandalopezhn This would seem to support the contention against "Jus soli." I presume that you're quoting this as preamble to further argument?
@fernandalopezhn Please quote the American statute.
@fernandalopezhn Then please rephrase your previous statement, because it's not grammatically clear: "No case is...would claim that that Wong Kim Ark specifically applies to Hondurans." What are you trying to say?
@fernandalopezhn YOU were the one who quoted the Wong Kim Ark decision.
@fernandalopezhn Contra the contention, with which I agree, that I quoted earlier. Wong Kim Ark is a narrow decision on specific grounds--not applicable to the legal case being pressed on behalf of people who are currently citizens of Honduras.
@fernandalopezhn What's your point? Instead of name-calling, give us your argument.
@fernandalopezhn Give us your argument contra this position.
Wong Kim Ark stands only for narrow proposition that U.S.-born children of lawful permanent resident aliens are U.S. citizens.

@Chascabass 7a) To clarify: my reference to community banks above is meant to be FOR community banks--heavy regulations inherently favor big banks and make capital more costly for smaller players. Fannie/Freddie are long past any usefulness and only raise cost of housing. They should go!!
@Chascabass 11) Hillary Clinton picked up the theme by framing her opposition as sexist. And the Democrats have pursued this identity narrative with passion, because they see it as working for them. It only serves to tear us apart and deflect from honest discussion and productive solutions.
@Chascabass 10) Respectfully submitted, he also squandered an opportunity to take our nation beyond identity. Instead, he allowed opposition to his policies to be construed as racist, and this framing became pervasive. It's toxic and wrong. It took us backwards, which is awful.
@Chascabass 9) I didn't vote for Pres. Obama, but when he won I wished him well. I hoped he'd be a very successful President. If he succeeded, we all did. I also knew that the policies he proposed would likely hurt the country, and they did. Helped by Dems, he squandered an opportunity.
@Chascabass 8) Pres. Obama also failed to act in best interests of the world concerning the most toxic malefactors--especially Iran and North Korea. When the theocracy in Iran was on the ropes, they were rescued with the nuclear deal--KNOWING the $$Billions they got would be used for terror!
@Chascabass 8) Under Pres. Obama the power of govt was exploited to abuse and quench voices who disagreed with him and the Dems in power, when the IRS entirely selectively threw roadblocks in the way of Tea Party groups but not their counterparts on the Left. That's WRONG, deeply wrong.
@Chascabass 7) Were Pres. Obama and Dems wrong on all that? Yes! Does that mean GOP was perfect? No! But directionally they're better. Stopping federal programs that both limit access to capital (community banks) and encourage bad decisions (Fannie/Freddie and many others) is correct.
@Chascabass 6) As w/healthcare, YES the financial-services industry has been deeply flawed and needs fixing--but Dodd-Frank made it worse. The way to force the financial-services industry to behave rationally is to stop using taxpayer $$ to pay for bad decisions, and have more transparency.
@Chascabass 5) Dodd-Frank was bad too; it reduced smaller actors' access to capital. That's Main Street. Sure, they got buy-in from the big players--the big guys ALWAYS get access. And the rest of us are disadvantaged AND we pay the steep price in lost opportunity, higher cost of living.
@Chascabass 4) Under President Obama, our nation did less well than it should have, because of policy. The regulations he and Democrats passed made our health care more costly and less accessible. YES, we need to do things differently, but PPACA wasn't the answer.
@Chascabass 3) That doesn't mean govt has no role in our lives--it has an important role to protect us from malefactors without and within. Our social compact grants govt the right to use force to preserve ordered liberty. But we do best when we can run our own lives to the fullest extent.
@Chascabass 2) I witnessed firsthand how people will try--and succeed--to use govt money and power to enrich themselves. They talk with politicians and elected; they fund them; they get access. That's wrong. I fought that, to my personal detriment, and I'm proud that i did. But very few do.
@Chascabass 1) I have a different focus because empowering govt to intervene in what should be consumer sectors doesn't work. You don't "fix" things with statistics--statistics prove what's getting fixed. Deregulation and tax cuts WORK. The statistics prove it. And that makes inherent sense.
@Chascabass Principles DO matter. And to the extent that a Party represents certain fiscal and economic principles that transcend identity (in any form), I seek to advance enterprise- and citizen-empowering policies based on free-market principles. It's that simple.
@Chascabass 2) I'm not about "red team, blue team" bulls*t. But I also don't believe in assigning equivalent value to the differing policies of one Party versus another. It's not like mixing up a nice fruit salad. When it comes to fiscal/economic policy, GOP is oxygen and Dems are cyanide.
@Chascabass 1) But policy DOES work. This is NOT a game. Yes, we're dealing with human beings and human nature, hence many imperfections. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't discern the forest being formed by the trees.
@Chascabass 2) Deregulation and tax cuts work to empower citizens; honest profits (NOT inflated profits from regulatory capture!!) create useful wealth that multiplies.	Govt mechanisms are inherently coercive. Everything govt does, it does, ultimately, at the point of a gun. Power corrupts.
@Chascabass 1) Policies work or fail for reasons that can be identified and quantified.	Policies that empower citizens in enterprise and markets are superior to policies that empower govt. in consumer areas. Whenever citizens can control their own resources, take own risks, they do better.

@Chascabass @1580sean @BarackObama Respectfully, this analogy is is excessively reductionist. 	I'm an enthusiastic Yankees fan, but I know (don't tell anyone) that whether they win or lose won't change lives. 	Policy DOES change lives. And I'll work my heart out to help assure the right policies for our country.

@jwjwkowal @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst America's "military" is massively expensive thanks to chronically overpaying contractors. The USPS is insolvent. The closest thing we have to "socialist" medicine is the VA, which has been a disaster and a disgrace for decades. Consumer empowerment would be far better.
@LindaClawson3 @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst Actually, Medicare doesn't work, and there are better ways to help folks with chronic illness. Medicare costs three times what the average beneficiary pays into the program, which is why the projected debt from Medicare is tens of trillions of dollars--all on taxpayers.
@theRealDutch4 @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst The chart that you show represents DISCRETIONARY spending. A common fallacy. In fact, roughly two-thirds of federal spending every year is on MANDATORY spending in the entitlement programs: SocSec, Medicare, Medicaid. Of these, Medicare looms as the largest driver of debt.

@Fendi_Gucci_Gal @NBCNews @TheDemocrats Both Julie Swetnick and another accuser cited by Avenatti denied to NBC that they'd said what Avenatti contended they said--but NBC didn't report on their denials in a timely way, to say the least. They just sat on the story. Looks really bad for @NBCNews as a news organization!
