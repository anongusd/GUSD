@espiers @UlrikBaltzer @arlenparsa @nicknotned Yeah it's the most disappointing thing about this. Her biases clouded her reporting.
@espiers @UlrikBaltzer @arlenparsa @nicknotned It is a clear pattern in this book. Publishers sharing links becomes "giving stories to Facebook." Multiple references to platforms usurping the role of editors.
@dlboardman @GateHouse_Media @MediaNewsGroup Smaller markets, for the most part?
@UlrikBaltzer @espiers @arlenparsa @nicknotned Yes. Before publication.
@UlrikBaltzer @espiers @arlenparsa @nicknotned I genuinely thought someone in the process who was familiar with digital publishing would have read this. I was wrong.
@thisismaz Oh for sure. I was exposed to it through digital ad rates. It's pretty damn ubiquitous which is why this context stunned me.
@UlrikBaltzer @nicknotned I do not. However since Denton knows what CPMs are I find it unlikely that he would appropriate an industry standard in this way. But sure that explanation would serve.
@UlrikBaltzer @arlenparsa @espiers @nicknotned Oh just that. It's like the fifth small error like that in a cascade of them and I think it just broke me.
@espiers @BGrueskin @nicknotned I mean I'm having a hard time putting it down but at this point I feel duty bound to see how wrong it will wind up. Is that the basis on which it's recommended? (Only reading bc of my fandom of The Powers That Be, on which this is patterned)

@BGrueskin @espiers @nicknotned Not in the slightest. The subtitle is "The business of news and the fight for facts;" I admit I did not think the book itself would fight with me over facts
I'm sorry to pick on Jill Abramson's MERCHANTS OF TRUTH but this description -- Instant Articles is not called Instant Publishers! -- is something else https://t.co/TVXkwj8LpL
@arlenparsa @espiers @nicknotned https://t.co/MKlFyBysyD
@espiers @nicknotned There is a *lot* of that in here. A section that attempts to describe WordPress that you'd think someone with access to a browser mightve glanced at pre publication.
@dkiesow @andybechtel Alt subtitle: "I have opinions about things I clearly don't understand" or "every score I hoped to settle, expounded upon"
@dkiesow @andybechtel My wife and daughter are genuinely confused. "If it's bad why are you still reading it? And why would you want to tweet about it?"
@andybechtel It's just such a ubiquitous term. And it's really sloppy.
Seriously how can the publisher of this book not know what a CPM is
Also she really missed what @raju and @arctictony were doing. The lack of understanding of everything about digital is stunning

The sections on early BuzzFeed, Vice and YouTube are similarly frustrating. (I'm on page 65.) And the answers -- why do brands put up with the crap on these platforms? (Answer: It's super cheap to reach the right people) are gettable! But it's not here. 4/
... the business part matters! A lot! One example: The NYT's print section, created after 9/11 and reporting on its effects, carried no advertising. Abramson says this is dignified. It's also because advertisers likely didn't want to be near that stuff. 3/
I LOVE The Powers That Be, and the only reason I decided to read Abramson's tome is because it's patterned after Halberstam's, structure-wise. But things are just so, so different. And really, writing this book from the perspective of a journalist is frustrating, because ... 2/
So I'm reading the Jill Abramson book, MERCHANTS OF TRUTH: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts. And - plagiarism concerns aside - I really wish she'd reported out the business part of this more. I knew it would be frustrating. I didn't realize how frustrating. 1/

You don't have to look far to find cozy relationships with figures tarred with the #MeToo brush, for instance. And - as I said - while I love the idea of taking a hard look at those relationships... everyone needs to know the rules.
... to be charitable, has not been the case. Also, as my former colleague notes, this is a new level for everyone involved -- so what's the playing field? What are the rules? And how do they apply to figures that are a big part of what Variety's business model has always been?
It's an approach that puts an industry known for tolerating (encouraging?) this kind of behavior as long as it produces results on notice. But the way forward, IMO, is pretty tricky, and depends on a level of transparency with readers/sources/advertisers that...

@moneyries ... If what the suit alleges is true, it now looks like a dishonest umpire, too. (long but good section in the article that admits that point. :) )
@moneyries In a Tuesday WSJ article, many publishers dismissed the argument that the social network was solely to blame for layoffs. But Facebook wrote the rule book, owned the field, and served as the referee for the game that struggling publishers were trying to win.
@moneyries "Facebook can’t shoulder the blame for these layoffs alone. Media executives ultimately made these decisions, and journalism was an unstable industry long before the first Facebook video..."

We've gotten two rounds of investment since then. We've launched a site in Pittsburgh, @theinclinepgh, and joined forces with @Denverite. We've covered elections, and our cities, with an eye toward filling the gaps.

@tmcgev Ah. I read that as “they’re gonna need more whales to pull this off.” But admittedly I am not following it super closely.
@tmcgev I don’t think that’s a concern I’ve seen, especially given the ... elaborate ... governance.
@tmcgev From what I’m seeing the reaction seems to be “this thing might not get across the finish line” and also “this is hard to actually participate in.” Also “hey one person bought a big chunk!” ... I just wanna know how it’s going, vs whatever there is to compare it with.
@tmcgev Man I wish that had been clear from the giddyup. Has anyone compared them? Or are they all wildly different?

Did I mention Billy Penn broke news? Another Mark Dent scoop, published before other reporters confirmed his work: https://t.co/M76All6KLd
Billy Penn 1.0 didn't have beats. But we still produced insightful coverage of City Hall, like this gem, which came after the umpteenth time we were waiting (and waiting) for a Council session to start... https://t.co/q3IDw5B2Jx
And as a writer, he's a marvel. Stories like this, keenly observed and written with wit and pathos, were a joy to edit and publish. https://t.co/UY9h9kT3oR
He's just great at getting the story, in this case finding what happened after a frustrated cyclist forced a SEPTA bus to stop for a full hour, until police arrived. https://t.co/4IF1ClpAcb
Mark pays attention to what's happening in neighborhoods -- like this story about Comcast, which he'd later follow up with more about these mystery boxes, and how people who said they didn't want 'em on their houses had it happen anyway https://t.co/mYnOsn8rI9
Check the date on this story Mark dug out of the archives -- far before Cosby's *first* trail, which he covered for us. He covered the second for @DEADLINE, which is a pretty cool thing for a Philly writer to do. https://t.co/48wYOFSKwp

The problem is that the pivot to video wasn't about newsrooms and competing. It was about higher CPMs, "what Facebook wants us to do." To make some more quick money. That's a really, really bad idea.
Everyone starts this conversation with the NYTimes; I don't like to do that. But they are building out that realm.
.@NewsCEO -- there's a smart way to do video. It's gradual, adding things slowly. @dallasnews competes with local TV, and does it well -- but that took time.
We're willing to give up quality if it means a little profit. Synonym to the "pivot to video" - it took digital journalism a long time to recover from the initial rush to degrade quality. It cheapens your product.
There's a lot of good video the world needs. What the world doesn't need is cheap video with words on it, so you could watch it with no sound. It wasn't a story about adopting a new form of storytelling -- it was about how we make decisions in the media biz.
The math didn't work. But I assumed there were venture capitalists at work, wise people. Well, we waited. We saw for a year. We saw traffic fall off a cliff, 80 percent drops - death for an ad-supported site. We'd participated in our downfall.
A lot of the economics behind it afterwards - at Fox Sports, at Mic -- didn't make sense. It takes hours to cut video, to do it well. Seemed like an enormous investment, which doesn't save money.
"The pivot to video was something that I - like many journalists - had the privilege of ignoring until I and 50 of my colleagues lost my jobs because of it. (At Mashable)." -- @moorehn at #AmEast18
Hello from America East in Hershey, PA! Gonna live-tweet a couple sessions today -- @moorehn doing a live version of her "Pivot to Video" piece for CJR, another on the Post-Gazette's can't-believe-they're-doing-a-tablet-play-in-2018 talk.

@dkiesow @BenMullin the future of media loses more money than the media it's supposed to replace
"People familiar with FiveThirtyEight’s operations say the financial profile of the site is partly a result of ESPN’s lack of attention to developing the company as a stand-alone business." This is SO WEIRD, it's not an echo of Grantland AT ALL
"Potential buyers have been told it is losing about $6 million annually on revenue of about $3 million, according to one person familiar with the sale discussions." Yeah I guess that'll cut down on the suitors. 0_o
Also seems pretty obvious that the Trend Everyone Thought Was The Future 5 Years Ago (538, Grantland, The Undefeated) is not so trendy anymore. Tho at least The Undefeated is finally a thing.
Huh! FiveThirtyEight and Nate Silver could go to ABC News (kinda a corporate kick-around), The Atlantic (flush w/ cash, thanks Emerson Collective) or The Athletic (ditto b/c of VCs). Scoop from @BenMullin: https://t.co/3ckwn0GU7w

@elgray @CloutPage @pottsmark the typepad blogs were actually miles ahead of the creaky-ass clickability system, sadly. i could understand every decision that got the place where it was. that didn't mean it was in a good place!
@mikeorren Yeah.
@CloutPage @pottsmark My man, I tried.
Complicating things when i got there were dozens of Movable Type hosted  blogs that sat separate from the URL. (Am sure @pottsmark recalls this mess). Glad to see some progress with the WaPo’s Arc system.
And on the receiving end Clickability was a way to do a site without relying on developers as there were only a handful around - the legacy of Knight Ridder centralizing those ops in San Jose. So dev work was outsourced. Painful!
This system was old when I was there but functional; an InDesign overlay to track workflow and integrate wire services. You could export stories to the Web one at a time or in a nightly dump based on complicated and buggy tagging. To call it print centric is too obvious by far
It’s been 10 years since I left Philly for LA and the Inky is finally replacing the old CMS they use for print - a system developed by Italian magazine publishers called “Hermes.” And the creaky web CMS, Clickabilitu, is going too. Good riddance.

@ThatRebecca @mattdpearce I don't see it working. (and yeah it's worth debating whether it "worked" in any sense other than financial at Forbes) And the thing that bugged me more than that was implementing it *instead of* working with the newsroom. That sucks.
@busblog eh, he's led newsrooms before. and honestly hard to see he keeps hold of it after the levinsohn thing,
@MartinBeck Yeah, I get that. Piece reads as though the writer hates him.
@mattdpearce not disagreeing at all
Also lemme be clear, I personally stopped reading Forbes once the contrib thing started. Too much garbage. But as an executive, he raised the value of the business, which is something that'll get him another executive job. Capitalism baby!
Attempt to pin him down for resume inflation at NYT seems minor. Personally I wouldn't keep a newsroom from tweeting a NYT story but hey, his mileage may vary. And it might be instructive to include, for instance, how much Disney advertises in that publication, a valid concern.
But some of these other issues also read as people terrified as a person pushes to change how news is published - most everyone's traffic is overwhelmingly mobile these days, publishing with that in mind is smart, not wrong.
Like, sure, I get it, he's controversial. And yes, the contributor model deserves scrutiny and an airing-out, and there's no guarantee that kinda thing works for a metro paper as it might for a business magazine in a crowded field.
