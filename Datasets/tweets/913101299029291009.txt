@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Yeah I would definitely prefer to not have this long drawn out scandal I think the president should have dropped him immediately but Kavanaugh isn't entitled to be on the supreme court it's an honor
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Fairness to him doesn't matter we have to be sure we are putting the best people on the supreme court. Like I said earlier I wish senators or the president would essentially say thanks but no thanks and find someone else. We have a lot of people to choose from.
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU I don't need to he decided to put himself through the vetting process and a credible source comes forward with allegations. He shouldn't be on the court. There has to be someone better out there than Brett Kavanaugh
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU This is most likely not what you want to hear but I have a lot more sympathy for Dr Ford than Kavanaugh
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU He clearly is controversial or we wouldn't be talk about him. Another judge could be selected that doesn't have allegations against them.
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU I don't care to destroy him senators should be able to say he's a good judge but I want someone with less controversy/doubt on the supreme court
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU This isn't a criminal court. It doesn't have to be proven he did something wrong. He is trying to join eight other people that hear cases that can change our country. If there is doubt that he isn't worthy of that honor they should find someone who is.
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Let me amend my original statement	It is very likely Kavanaugh lied under oath and given that he is not the best choice to serve on the supreme court
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Many of his former classmates have come forward  saying they often saw him very drunk including Mark Judge
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Are you trying to argue there is no difference between hearsay and an actual witness?
@Salixarz @ACLU Donald Trump doesn't have the right to unilaterally put a creep on the court is also not a partisan statement
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU Exactly by the definition you provided hearsay would be if Mark Judge said he heard PJ talking about how much Kavanaugh drank but that is not what happened here.
@Alphawolfspirit @Salixarz @ACLU It's not actually hearsay. It's witnesses who saw Kavanaugh drunk and belligerent.

@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 I don't think abortion is morally wrong
@jasontrujillo_ @Amelia7840 @March_for_Life I think third trimester abortions are wrong unless the mother is at risk but those are incredibly rare
@jasontrujillo_ @Amelia7840 @March_for_Life I don't think 22 weeks is necessarily the right cut off and I think that removing the fetus to save the mother should always be an option
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 Well for now women have the right to choose
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 These laws have focused on the harm done to a pregnant woman and the subsequent loss of her pregnancy, but not on the rights of the fetus.
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 It still can't live independently and is part of the women
@jasontrujillo_ @Amelia7840 @March_for_Life I wouldn't say I absolutely agree but there is a valid argument for that
@jasontrujillo_ @Amelia7840 @March_for_Life I obviously meant outside the mother üòí
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 According to the Constitution, it's not a baby til it can live independently Until then it's part of the woman and abortion is legal it's a moral decision.  You can decide not to abort, but you can't force your morals on someone else.
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 Yes I am
@prettygrlkk1 @TruthMatters13 It doesn't have the right to use my body though
@jasontrujillo_ @Amelia7840 @March_for_Life If they can survive independently of the mother

@Cynecin @mitchellvii Ok if you think journalists don't look for scandals in the lives of politicians we obviously don't have anything further to talk about
@Cynecin @mitchellvii The accusers didn't suddenly come out they were found because of good journalism. There were also tons of people that said he was a creep and even Moore himself couldn't say he never dated a teenager as an adult.
@Cynecin @mitchellvii They can be dirty attacks but in this case there was too much evidence of wrongdoing for the people of Alabama to trust him
I believe in innocent until proven guilty but that doesn't mean women are liars until proven not
@Cynecin @mitchellvii I understand what you're saying but you are assuming the allegations are completely false
@corey_trumbower @WSJ @POTUS I know but I'm hoping that we are slowly going to start demanding better. I know it's a long shot but I really hope it's true
@ChrisRBarron @realDonaldTrump Really? Are we saying that Moore lost because he's anti-gay? Because I've been to Alabama and I don't think that was the problem
@WSJ I'm more excited about creeps not being allowed in our government honestly
@realDonaldTrump Yeah cause he's a creep

@goldrush3177 @WatchChad That does not sound at all acceptable for children. Children do deserve accurate information about their bodies but this is taking it too far.

@goldrush3177 @WatchChad Most kids don't get any sex education in school if schools are doing more than giving information they are few and far between

@Sammy_0ne You keep saying the same thing over and over why don't you go do something more productive?
@Sammy_0ne So you are admitting you are attacking me for something I've never said?
@Sammy_0ne How is it hypocrisy if I don't do any of those things? You just want to insult me for nothing
@Sammy_0ne You came out and insulted me for no reason.
@Sammy_0ne I'm not the one that feels the need to bully people online
@Sammy_0ne You don't know me
@Sammy_0ne Because I have nothing to prove to you
@Sammy_0ne I don't see any reason to.
@Sammy_0ne He is very confident
@Sammy_0ne I'm not here to field personal attacks and harassment I'm more than willing to talk politics tho
@Sammy_0ne It seems like you are into attacking people and not talking about policy
@Sammy_0ne Why are you so obsessed with me?
@Sammy_0ne @DNicoleMarsalek @SenGillibrand Well employers offer healthcare as part of a benefit package
@Sammy_0ne @DNicoleMarsalek @SenGillibrand Why should a employer be able to decide they arbitrarily don't want to cover a basic medicine?
@Sammy_0ne @DNicoleMarsalek @SenGillibrand Wanting your insurance to cover basic meds is not a crazy idea
@Sammy_0ne @DNicoleMarsalek @SenGillibrand It's part of your payment for working for the company
@TurningPt_News I think our society objectifies women
@dankramer101 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc Again there is no guarantee for this. Employers could say I hate birth control and not cover it across the board
@jkdewitt @ArnettK @BreitbartNews From a bio perspective there are other chromosomal combos and sex is determined by more than chromosomes including gonads and hormones
@washingtonpost Bragging about your ability to help people is the most tacky thing imaginable
@TurningPt_News Also why does it matter?
@dankramer101 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc Contraceptives do much more than prevent pregnancy for many women they are necessary
@TurningPt_News I'm not even sure why this debate happened
@dankramer101 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc Employers should not have the right to deny coverage for basic meds because they don't like them
I feel like this is becoming my catch phrase https://t.co/FHhKBJYzZM
@Bill1qazxsw2 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc The health insurance you pay for should cover your basic meds
@ArnettK @BreitbartNews Nope
@dankramer101 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc There is no guarantee that it would be covered in these situations and women shouldn't have to petition their employers to get basic meds
@WalshFreedom People want to health insurance they pay for to cover their basic meds not much to ask
@Bill1qazxsw2 @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc The health insurance these women pay for
@GithYankee @SenSherrodBrown @nwlc How is abstinence going to help regulate a period, reduce pain and treat dozens of disorders?

@Mutand2k_ Most women take BC for a reason other than to prevent pregnancy and they are asking for their insurance to pay for their basic drugs
@TruConservatv @fireheather @trumpology @SouthernKeeks the ACA is a whole other argument. Basic insurance plans should cover the pill since it is one of the most popular prescription drugs.
@realPolitiDiva In this case people want the health insurance they already have to cover their medicine this is a pretty common expectation of insurance
@TruConservatv @fireheather @trumpology @SouthernKeeks No one is being forced to cover the medicine we are talking about healthcare plans from employers

@DSAFed_ @BigVileRat @charliekirk11 @SusanBe35980777 Then the original statement is incorrect
@crickycarroll @FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump Rejecting the deal would not help Israel if that's what you mean
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Are we supposed to get supplementary insurance for everything? There is no good reason not to cover BC it's not expensive or a trial drug
@CBSNews That day is really going to help them feed their families
The only thing Trump wants is to undo everything Obama did. He has no ideas of his own

@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Many women take BC for reason other than preventing pregnancy. What about them?
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Is a basic prescription that's the obvious difference between BC and Tylenol
@Citizen_USA1 @SenatorTomUdall Employees health insurance is part of their salary and they also pay into the pool. Health insurance is meant to cover basic meds
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Why was it not included in the plan? Why should employers make that decision?
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews But why weren't they paying for it? When you get insurance basic meds like this are expected
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews People deserve for their health insurance to cover a basic and inexpensive medicine that's what they are paying for
@HeavensGutter @RealityOfItAll7 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Employees pay for their health insurance
@foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews People and their doctor's are the only ones that get a say in what meds to take
@stevenescott @ColorFiend @SpeakerRyan Employees pay for their fucking health insurance!
@SpeakerRyan So are we going to let religious companies deny coverage for antibiotics? What is the difference?
@Only1Tabatha @thisbishcan @SpeakerRyan That's what insurance is for!

@bison63648 @FoxNews @benshapiro The problem is nothing is stopping these people from going down the street into another city and buying a gun
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze I have done my research and I have never seen evidence that armed civilians save lives at a significant rate but I'm always open to new info
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze @DLoesch Where is the data?
@Datdeus @VotezPoisson @SenFeinstein I mean I don't really want to die at all but youre right I should have said I don't want to be shot
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze Do you have a source for that?
@FoxNews @dbongino The elevated levels are why there is more gun control!
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze Yes the right to life is more important than being able to have whatever kind of gun you want Remember the first part of 2A "well regulated"
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze There is no evidence that 2A stops crime at all
@RealWednesdayy Shamed how
@VotezPoisson @SenFeinstein And I don't want to die, deal with it
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze But it should. Something that was written down hundreds of years ago isn't worth letting people die for
@bison63648 @warrenvmyers @theblaze ..to produce less guns and stop the guns that make rapid fire easy

@warrenvmyers @theblaze It definitely helps
@mgm168 @MSNBC It's a complex issue but we need to discuss how we are going to keep guns like that out of people's hands
@theblaze We can't hold the values of people hundreds of years ago over the well-being of people today

@billjperry @LockeOfLiberty @SarcasticManat1 @Top12Gun @FoxNews @MikeEmanuelFox I wouldn't be against that
@kwh109 @Matthew_ender7 @BreitbartNews It makes sense they have conflicting views tho. Its hard to make money in HW without violence. Thats more of a societal problem
@Matthew_ender7 @kwh109 @BreitbartNews Yeah I do agree with you somewhat. We should not glorify violence especially as much as we do. But the actors can still have opinions
@FoxNews @guypbenson @POTUS this isn't a party thing I just miss the days when our president didn't have time to fight with the free press

@Anton_Af_Hjalm @MikaelChri @tedcruz 9 million children just lost health insurance with no backup plan
@Anton_Af_Hjalm @MikaelChri @tedcruz The problem is there are poor babies that didn't do anything to get in that position that won't be covered by the private sector
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP  https://t.co/QFG9yaluGm
@Anton_Af_Hjalm @MikaelChri @tedcruz It's hypocritical that pro-life people only care about babies inside of a woman and not after
@BradJonesWriter @JebBush @POTUS She was asking for more help didn't say anything about Trump until he called her people lazy
@LockeOfLiberty @SarcasticManat1 @Top12Gun @FoxNews @MikeEmanuelFox That's what we have to have a thoughtful conversation about. I dont have all the answers but we do need to limit guns and the damage they do
@Anton_Af_Hjalm @MikaelChri @tedcruz Congress just let CHIP the child healthcare program run out. This affects 9 million children in the US

@godeep8080 @Abierration @AnselValley @Oil_Guns_Merica @StephenAtHome except for private sales. which shouldn't be legal without checks and registration
@godeep8080 @Abierration @AnselValley @Oil_Guns_Merica @StephenAtHome Registration would make it harder for people who shouldn't be buying guns to buy them...
@godeep8080 @Abierration @AnselValley @Oil_Guns_Merica @StephenAtHome They had gun registration back then... And the 2A originally applied to muzzleloaders so how are you going to justify the fancy new shit?
@JohnLeFevre First off no, second people can easily transport guns all over the US
@godeep8080 @Abierration @AnselValley @Oil_Guns_Merica @StephenAtHome The first part of 2A is "well-regulated" the government is constitutionally allowed to regulate guns
@godeep8080 @Abierration @AnselValley @Oil_Guns_Merica @StephenAtHome I have.... Just one that wasn't printed by the NRA

@AlvionInvesting Aww thanks for noticing babe
@Fapzodia I can't wait
@AlvionInvesting Wouldn't trust someone with my money that doesn't know how taxes work
@EJayWells @theblaze They are top of their field they have impressive work ethics
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich Yes but cops are killing too many for no reason
@EJayWells @theblaze These players have pushed their bodies to the limit to earn their paychecks
If you want to argue you are smarter because I stop replying sadly I don't have the time but I try to get back to people with good arguments
@ElPapiOsoGrande @Lizlegs49 @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich Cool
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich I'm just trying to understand your argument
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics lower than the general population there are bad people everywhere doesn't mean we shouldn't help
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich It's not a straw man I was simply pointing out a fact and it doesn't detract from the rest of my points either
@ElPapiOsoGrande @Lizlegs49 @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich You just said you don't care that people are dieing
@EJayWells @theblaze I'm sorry they hurt the flags feelings when demanding equality
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich How so? They can't talk about racism until there is no crime?
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich If you were paying attention you'd know that wasn't even the main point in my argument
@BeavDaniel @seanhannity And the debt rises even higher with no way to pay it
@EJayWells @theblaze There is no disrespect here just peaceful protest
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich Everyone is within their rights so people should calm down

@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich The problem is black on black crime doesn't cancel out racism
@EJayWells @theblaze Exactly those people died for their rights so why give them shit for exercising them?
@EchoCharlie308 @SteveCreed99 @FoxNews @newtgingrich They didn't disrespect anything
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich Where is my straw man exactly?
@ElPapiOsoGrande @EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich I didn't say other sides couldn't protest

@seanhannity We are to smart to fall for that
@EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich The players have said they are protesting racism which means that their protest is about racism
@EchoCharlie308 @FoxNews @newtgingrich You can't say I'm wrong without backing it up...
@EJayWells @theblaze So they are risking their job to take a stand against racism? I'd say that's nobel

@EJayWells @theblaze They aren't protesting the flag they are protesting racism there is nothing more American than that
@EJayWells @theblaze People matter more than the flag
@MrPrincetrumpet @theblaze Fucking finally
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics I want to help americans get back on their feet and out of poverty. I dont understand what you are arguing
If you don't want to actually help the vets and poor you cant use them as a prop when arguing against other humanitarian efforts
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics You cant bring up an alternative and then not follow through. You either care about poor americans or you dont
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics They should but we aren't doing anything to help them and that is gross
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics So are we going to up welfare with the money we save from taking less refugees?
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics You cant only talk about poor americans when we are talking about other problems in the world they deserve more
@politico I don't understand how its so low
@FoxNews @dbongino Cool they aren't so we are good right?
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics What plan do you have for those people? I advocate for helping US homeless too but it usually falls on deaf ears
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Some people care about governing too not just winning elections
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics I am more than willing to help the poor and homeless too but I don't see a plan for that either
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics I'm saying we shouldn't put a hard cap on it we have to be flexible with changing conditions
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics It's the lowest number in a long time and there are more refugees everyday
@kcimary @kaufmannskrimis @CNNPolitics Not open but we should take in as many refugees as we need to. I can't give you a number since it changes all the time

@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal why? the op is also only one person lazy generalizing makes debating so much easier
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal The problem is that this tax plan doesn't reflect that view. I'm concerned that this will hurt small business
Wow @TruthTrails is trying to act like I completely agree with the entire democratic platform... #YouDontKnowMe
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal I am one person you can not put other peoples beliefs on me
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal I am talking about people making much more than that
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal we should absolutely support people starting a business our economy needs small business
@uselesaccounts @Fapzodia @sahluwal Do you have evidence of that?
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal I didn't say business cuts are bad. Taxes on wealthy individuals should not be cut
@TruthTrails @uselesaccounts @sahluwal I didn't say it was only the rich getting tax cuts just questioned if they needed them

@KevinTheMayor sorry it's just the truth
@Fapzodia @uselesaccounts @sahluwal I believe if you can afford to help your fellow americans you should Especially people who have millions laying around
