@Bubblebathgirl @RashidaTlaib @OversightDems @RepMarkMeadows Shame on you and your defense of a man who decided that because a guy has a black woman who works for him that automatically makes him not racist.
@pflinchman1 @RashidaTlaib @OversightDems I mean if you want to put blinders and not see the obviousness of why Meadows brought her there or not see that just because you have a person of color in your life in some way doesnt mean you cannot be racist or are immune from racism, that is on you.
@Bubblebathgirl @RashidaTlaib @OversightDems @RepMarkMeadows Also, the fact that he used his grandkids as props to show he is not racist is absurd. You can have people in your life who are people of color, work with people who are people of color, and still exhibit racist tendencies.
@Bubblebathgirl @RashidaTlaib @OversightDems @RepMarkMeadows She can decide for herself, but that does not negate Meadows intentions, which were very clear.

@angela_rye @LibsInAmerica Also, this op-ed doesn't bring up the cases mentioned in the other op-ed to defend her choices.
@angela_rye @LibsInAmerica She needs to explain herself in things like the Gaorge Case case, and also why she defended California's choice to deny sexual reassignment surgery to an inmate. I am very apprehensive from a crimincal justice reform standpoint based on some of these thigns in her record.
