Are being trafficked by criminal organizations. Just because they give them a bus ride doesn‚Äôt mean all those people aren‚Äôt still paying the trafficking organizations
It‚Äôs not a lie - you don‚Äôt get to pass through border towns without the consent of the drug cartels - I spent years covering the stories in Mexico - the Mexican government like government officials here perpetuate the behavior of the traffickers - they move people through that https://t.co/lmvWgvxzM7
Vital to national security but the humanitarian concern is also a major reason we should all be fighting for better security and laws.
And against changes in the law. Once they reach the porous border they just send them through with rehearsed asylum claims, no identifiers and coach them on how to game the system. Unfortunately, thousands of children and women are sex trafficked as well. Protecting our border
Think about this: Mexican gov is helping transport people for the drug cartels and criminal traffickers to the US border - illegal migrants don‚Äôt just get to walk in without paying traffickers - and the drug cartels are also counting on those fighting against border security https://t.co/mhL3Xt0aFR
