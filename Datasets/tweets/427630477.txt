Here’s what it looked like inside the room as that went down. https://t.co/QNVeRD2KPm
Cohen: “To those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did, I pray the country doesn't make the same mistakes.”
Cohen says he believes if Trump loses in 2020, there will not be a peaceful transfer of power.
Cohen in closing statement: “My loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything.”
I’ve never seen Mark Meadows this angry.
“My nieces and nephews are people of color,” Meadows says as she chokes up.
“I am not calling the gentleman, Mr. Meadows, a racist,” Tlaib adds.		Meadows is angry.
Rashida Tlaib just said Meadows’ use of Lynne Patton was racist. Meadows objects.		Cummings asks Tlaib if she wants to re-read her statement.		Tlaib reads the same statement.

Here’s the Trump campaign’s statement on Michael Cohen’s testimony https://t.co/vmixixCA0g https://t.co/6GuXmSzRUv
It’s a Red Bull for lunch kind of day.
Cohen says he lied to Melania Trump, at the direction of President Trump, about the president’s knowledge of the hush-money payments.
.@RepMarkMeadows has been staring down Michael Cohen this entire time. I haven’t seen his eyes deviate away from Cohen except when a staffer taps his shoulder.
When asked if Trump committed an illegal act not discussed today, Cohen said yes but he can’t talk about it because SDNY is investigating. https://t.co/vmixixCA0g
“Mr. Cohen’s statement is not true,” Roger Stone tells us in response to Cohen’s testimony about WikiLeaks/Assange https://t.co/vmixixCA0g
“What is the truth you know that President Trump fears most?” GOP Rep. Justin Amash asks.		Cohen calls it a “tough question.”
Cohen says he took Felix Sater’s old office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower when Sater left — same floor as Trump’s office.
Cohen says he is aware of other illegal acts committed by Trump, but can’t discuss them because of ongoing investigations.
“We are not fact-checkers for BuzzFeed,” Cohen says when asked why he didn’t publicly refute BuzzFeed story saying Trump directed him to lie to Congress.
.@AOC greets a 100-year-old WWII veteran who’s here for the Cohen hearing. https://t.co/2fy7SW86Mo
Rep. Virginia Foxx asks Cohen to commit to not pursue a book/movie deal about his time working for the president. Cohen says no.
When asked if Trump has ever threatened someone with physical violence, Cohen responds: “No. He would use others.” He referenced people who already worked for Trump.
“Everybody’s job at the Trump Organization was to protect Mr. Trump,” Cohen says.		“We knew we were going to lie for him — that became the norm.”
“You’re a pathological liar,” Rep. Gosar tells Cohen. Familiar theme from Republicans so far.
Michael Cohen says he briefed Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump on the Trump Tower Moscow project.
Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) lists off the guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation.		“My friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to bring any of these people before the committee,” Lynch says. “… Your side ran away from the truth.”
@davidgura actually quite chilly
Cohen tells Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA) that his former lawyer recommended that he reach out to Lanny Davis, a former Clinton aide and longtime Dem strategist. Republicans are scrutinizing the connection.
Cohen: “Everything was done with the knowledge and direction of Mr. Trump.”
Cohen tells Meadows he does not have tapes of Trump making racist comments.
Mark Meadows has former Trump Org official (and current U.S. gov’t official) Lynne Patton behind him. Meadows says “there was no way she would work for someone who is racist.”
Cohen claps back at Jim Jordan: “Shame on you Mr. Jordan.”
RT @timkmak: Michael Cohen says that his threats to me in 2015 were done with the "approval and sign off" of Donald Trump personally
Matt Gaetz — who is not on the Oversight Committee — is standing on the Republican side of the dais.
Cohen on Roger Stone: “He frequently reached out to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump was very happy to take his calls.”
Jim Jordan is reading Cohen’s threat to @timkmak when Tim was about to report damaging information about Trump during the 2016 campaign.
“There is no doubt in my mind” that Trump knew what he was paying for, Cohen tells Cummings.
Reminder as we listen to Cohen and view these documents: Trump repeatedly claimed, for months, that he had no knowledge of the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels.
COHEN re: June 2016 Trump Tower meeting: “I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: ‘The meeting is all set.’ I remember Mr. Trump saying, ‘Ok good...let me know.’”

As long as Trump/McConnell/Schumer/Pelosi/Ryan all agree, it seems unlikely that the House and Senate would need to do roll call votes &amp; bring all members back. They could UC/voice vote it, which is what the Senate did with their CR on Wednesday night.
The House has adjourned for the night and will come back in tomorrow. The Senate won’t have any more votes tonight and is likely to adjourn soon. 		We’re headed for a partial shutdown at midnight eastern time.
Translation: Senators will head home, and the government will partially shut down tonight at midnight. https://t.co/MCqPS5nHY2
This, obviously, was an issue earlier in the week when Pence told Senate Republicans that Trump would sign their CR. Trump blew up the talks and told them to go back to the negotiating table.
Under tonight’s agreement, the House &amp; Senate won’t vote on a funding bill until Trump &amp; D/R leaders come to an agreement.		Corker said he told leaders he’d only vote to proceed “under one condition: the president publicly comes out &amp; supports what we’re voting on.”

Mike Pence just spent a few minutes on the floor with Corker and Flake, two Trump critics who are retiring.
The motion to proceed has passed, 48-47, with Pence breaking the tie. McConnell said this gives the Senate “maximum flexibility” to work out a deal with Democrats and the White House.
“His wall will not have 60 votes in the Senate,” Schumer reiterates with Pence in the chair.
It’s now 47-47, and Mike Pence is likely to break the tie.		(This is the motion to proceed, which needs a simple majority.)
CORKER voted yes, and Flake just changed his vote to yes. Doug Jones also just voted yes.

The Senate is voting now on the motion to proceed to the House-passed CR (wall $ + disaster relief included). Needs a simple majority, and 60 for final passage. It won’t get 60, and it might not even clear this first procedural hurdle.
McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor, says the House bill is “quite uncontroversial in a more normal political moment.” Accuses Dems of prioritizing “personal fights with the president.”

NEW: The House passed a government funding bill, 217-185, that includes wall funding &amp; disaster relief. It’s DOA in the Senate, which has already passed a clean CR.
Meadows: “For senators to hope that this president is going to all of a sudden sign a bill that does not provide for border security—is not a bet I would take.”
Meadows, who met with Trump at WH today, says he’s convinced Trump would never sign a clean CR.		“He was serious about not folding without a fight.”
Meadows acknowledges the House bill can’t pass the Senate, but says: “When the pressure of, why can’t you give a few billion dollars for border security, becomes the message—not a shutdown message ... that’s a position that is hard to keep long-term.”
Schumer:		“Everything that indicates stability, everything that indicates strength, everything that indicates knowledge, is leaving this administration. General Kelly. General Mattis. So many others. McMaster. There is chaos now in this administration.”
Schumer and Pelosi are painting a dire picture of the United States right now amid Mattis’ resignation and the shutdown chaos.
Pelosi says Trump officials have left the administration either in “dismay” or “disgrace.” Says she’s “shaken” by Mattis’ resignation.
Schumer says Mattis was “one of the few items of strength and stability in this administration.”
Schumer: “The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall.”
“Everyone knows it can’t pass the Senate. It’s a cynical attempt to hurt innocent people,” Schumer says of House bill.

Still true.

Mattis made clear to Graham that he disagreed with Trump’s decision.		“He told me without any hesitation that ISIS has been hurt badly” but they are nowhere near defeated, Graham said.
Reed also cited the Obama admin’s decision to withdraw from Iraq too early as reason that the U.S. should remain in Syria.
“I don’t know how this decision was made,” Graham says. “It literally came out of left field. It has rattled the world.”
Graham: “I don’t want to hear any more about how much we love our troops. We all love our troops. … They don’t want to leave until the job’s done.”
Graham, who landed back in DC yesterday from Afghanistan, says he wants withdrawal to be determined based on conditions on the ground and in consultation with national security team.		Graham makes clear he thinks Trump made this decision on his own w/o following that advice.

Proponents are worried House GOP leaders will ignore the issue in order to save Trump from having to make a formal determination.		Corker has been trying to force the WH to name MBS as complicit. If House allows a vote, Corker might just get his wish.	https://t.co/gZJyYXR3v4
Make no mistake: the Corker measure would pass the House if it were put on the floor. It’s a joint resolution, so it would head to POTUS’ desk for his signature. Trump has thus far refused to blame Khashoggi’s murder on MBS. This joint resolution would force him into a corner.
Speaker Ryan’s office won’t comment just yet on whether the House will take up the Corker resolution to condemn MBS for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It passed unanimously in the Senate last week, and Corker said yesterday he spoke w/ Ryan who seemed amenable to the idea.
A short-term CR is “more likely than it was a few hours ago,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby says. This comes after Schumer rejected McConnell’s offer for $1.6B in border security plus a $1B “slush fund.”
Usual caveats apply. But it sounds like another short-term CR.

For context: Corker wanted to force the Trump administration to have to name MBS as being complicit in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, which would majorly upend WH Middle East policies. That effort now appears much less likely to succeed. https://t.co/gZJyYXR3v4
On the non-binding resolution, Corker says: “While this doesn’t affect policy, a strong denouncing of a crown prince and holding them responsible for the murder of a journalist, it’s a pretty strong statement for the United States Senate to be making, assuming we can get a vote”
“I’d love to do it this year. I’d love for it to be one of the last things we do. But it’s their bill,” says Corker, who only has a few weeks left as a senator
Doesn’t sound promising for folks who want to punish Saudi Arabia beyond a non-binding resolution (which seems the likeliest at this point). There’s the Yemen war powers vote, of course, but that’s less connected to the Khashoggi murder.
Corker tells me he wants to amend the bill to reduce the ban on U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia from two years to one year, “to see if behavior changes had taken place—they can always it extend it. So I mean, we’re talking about close to dancing on the head of a pen here.”

Corker seems optimistic about reaching a consensus on Saudi/Yemen legislation, but time is running out. He wants the Menendez-Young bill to get a hearing in SFRC. Lee-Sanders is “a very strong message” but “the bill that actually affects operations” is Menendez-Young, he says.

Corker: “Let me just put it this way. I think if he was in front of a jury, he would have a unanimous verdict in about 30 minutes. Guilty. A guilty verdict.”
CORKER: “no question whatsoever” that “he (MBS) murdered him (Khashoggi).”

Bottom line: Corker thinks it would be difficult for the White House, no matter what they do, to peel enough Republicans off the Yemen resolution. “I think there are 51 votes to proceed.”
He also notes that there are different factions of GOPers who voted yes: those who want to pull out of Yemen, those with “conditional concerns” about Yemen withdrawal, some who want to send a signal, and others (like him) who are angry over WH response to Khashoggi murder.
“Something would have to happen at the White House level, a strong policy toward the crown prince” in order for senators to drop off the Yemen vehicle on the floor, Corker says.
Corker tells me he hasn’t yet decided if he’s a yes on opening up debate on Yemen resolution. He thinks it has 51 votes regardless of his vote. He says he knows what he wants to see the White House do re: Saudi/Khashoggi but doesn’t want to telegraph it yet. Haspel briefing 11am

NEW, w/ @attackerman @ErinBanco &gt;&gt; the White House’s push to shore up support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen completely backfired ahead of a procedural vote on ending U.S. involvement https://t.co/C41pTDCBTo
More Corker: “The Goldilocks solution is, absolutely, the administration forcing Saudi Arabia to take ownership over what has happened with the journalist, and putting in place appropriate policies relative to what they’re doing as it relates to innocent civilians.”
Corker told me he asked Mattis and Pompeo to “share with us what they’d like to see us do,” but “they could not.” That has pushed him toward supporting (at least the contours of) the Yemen resolution.
This totally backfired on Mattis and Pompeo. It’s looking increasingly likely that Congress will end up taking action in response to Khashoggi because of what senators say is the lack of a sufficient response from WH.		Corker has historically backed the Yemen effort. Not anymore.
RT @AkbarSAhmed: This feels like a very solid possibility to me—@ChrisMurphyCT also hinting that might be the route https://t.co/wAAk8JvihM
Multiple senators now confirming to me: Pompeo and Mattis told senators that the White House decided against sending Haspel.
Corker wants to amend the Yemen resolution to “send the right signal” to Saudi. (It can be amended with 51 votes.) He sounds like he will vote to advance the resolution as is. It can be amended after the motion to table fails.
Corker just unloaded on the Trump admin. He’s angry. Inclined to back Yemen resolution.
(!!!) Durbin: “we asked why Gina Haspel wasn’t there” and Mattis/Pompeo responded that it was the White House’s decision
“The most persuasive chair was the empty chair,” Durbin says of Haspel’s absence
Menendez says admin is participating in a “coverup” by not having Haspel or other Intel officials there
FLAKE is unmoved after the briefing, will still support Yemen resolution. Pompeo and Mattis argues against it.
COONS says he is “dissatisfied” with what he heard and will therefore vote YES on pulling out of Yemen.
Interesting: Cory Gardner, leaving early from the briefing, won’t say how he’s voting on the Yemen resolution. Wouldn’t answer direct questions about what he learned inside.

On the Mattis-Pompeo briefing, Sen. @ChrisMurphyCT tells me: “They are going to come to Congress and tell us a totally different story than what was included in President Trump’s statement, and everybody’s prepared for that.”
Holding a vote on the Yemen resolution immediately after the Mattis-Pompeo briefing on Saudi/Khashoggi/Yemen could turn out to be the best thing for Murphy/Kaine/Lee/Sanders—who have lost this vote a few times already—in a long time.
Corker hints he could back the Yemen resolution depending what he hears in the Weds briefing: “I don’t plan on laying on the railroad tracks and I could even, depending on what happens Wednesday, be in a place that I haven’t been in the past as it relates to issues with [Saudi].”

Corker tells reporters he’s asked the WH to send Gina Haspel for the Wednesday briefing on Saudi. Right now it’s just Mattis and Pompeo.

So far, though, Senate Dems haven’t explicitly threatened to vote against the gov’t funding bill absent the Mueller legislation.
Schumer also said Democrats will “push to include” the Mueller protection bill in the must-pass spending bill (Dec. 7th): “We have urgent reason to consider it here on the floor.”

Among those added to Treasury’s SDN list: Saud al-Qahtani, a former top MBS aide and the alleged mastermind of the Khashoggi operation.

Rubio to @thedailybeast: “if a government is willing to murder a U.S. green-card holder in a 3rd country in a diplomatic facility... there’s a legitimate Q over whether such a gov’t could be trusted with nuclear energy &amp; the potential weaponization of it.” https://t.co/TXQoWdjKuo

ICYMI: Trump is escalating his anti-media attacks on the campaign trail as a major part of the GOP’s closing message. Their formula for victory: bash the media &amp; gin up fears over the caravan https://t.co/zOCrQHVcWq
Trump’s attacks on the press were part of his prepared remarks; usually, they’re off the cuff. Republicans clearly want it to be part of their closing message. The best messenger for it is President Trump. https://t.co/zOCrQHVcWq
My dispatch from President Trump’s rally tonight in Estero, FL (near Fort Myers), where his closing message for the midterms was clear: trust me, or trust the “far-left media.” https://t.co/zOCrQHVcWq
Trump pushes back: “Illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Constitution.”
Trump brings up birthright citizenship. He calls it a “crazy policy” that “costs billions of dollars a year.” (It’s more than just a “policy”—it’s a constitutional amendment.)
Trump: “But the media doesn’t want the media to hear your stories—not my stories, your stories. That’s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact, and I hate to say this, the enemy of the people.”		Crowd cheers.
Trump denounces “far left media” in aftermath of last week’s tragedies. Crowd immediately boos the press and starts a loud “CNN sucks” chant.

Worth noting that Pompeo’s statement was far from a commitment to slap human-rights sanctions on Saudi Arabia. If the administration declines to use Magnitsky, Congress has few options other than blocking future arms sales.
U.S. has identified some Saudis suspected to have been involved in Jamal Khashoggi’s killing, Pompeo says, and they include members of the intelligence services, the foreign ministry, and the royal court. State Dept is working to revoke visas &amp; possibly apply Magnitsky sanctions.

And the “support” statements start rolling in. Here's Sen. Portman, who says “no corroboration exists regarding this allegation.” https://t.co/wRJuH5c3Yl
Cornyn says the plan is still to vote in the committee tomorrow morning &amp; stay in session over the weekend to confirm Kavanaugh by Monday/Tuesday at the earliest.

Ted Cruz says both Kavanaugh and Ford “have been treated incredibly poorly by Senate Democrats and by the media.”
“You’re the first major target of a new strategy that’s developed here,” Tillis tells Kavanaugh. “It’s not advise and consent. It’s search and destroy.”

Congrats to Attorney General Lindsey Graham as of Nov. 6
Klobuchar to Kavanaugh: “Just ask the president to re-open the FBI investigation.”
No more Rachel Mitchell. Republicans are going all in for Kavanaugh.
This is weird.
Graham addresses his GOP colleagues: “If you vote no, you’re legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time of politics.”
“You're supposed to be Bill Cosby in your junior and senior year of high school. And all of a sudden you got over it,” Graham says, mocking Dems
Graham is yelling at the Democrats: “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life”
Sen. Graham has asked for the floor. He’s the first GOP senator (aside from Grassley) to speak today.
!!!!! Durbin and Kavanaugh really sparring right now over an FBI investigation.		“If there is no truth to her charges, the FBI investigation will show that. Are you afraid that they might not?” Durbin asks, drawing groans from the audience.
It’s getting heated in here. If it wasn’t already clear, a very different Brett Kavanaugh has shown up today.

“Explaining this to our daughters has been about the worst experience of our lives,” Kavanaugh says.
“Sometimes I had too many beers. … I liked beer. I still like beer,” Kavanaugh says, but adds: “I never sexually assaulted anyone.”
Sen. Cornyn is tearing up as he listens to Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh chokes up as he talks about his 10-year-old daughter.
This is absolutely an appeal to Trump. Direct and to the point.
Kavanaugh’s demeanor right now is strikingly different from earlier this week when he was on Fox News &amp; appeared more calm and measured.
Kavanaugh tells Dems, “your coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drive me out.”
WOW.		Kavanaugh says the allegations are a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” fueled by “anger at Trump” over the 2016 election and “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.”
“This is destroying my family and my good name,” Kavanaugh says.
Kavanaugh is going scorched-earth, attacking Democrats for a “good old-fashioned attempt at Bork-ing.”
Kavanaugh attacked Cory Booker (though not by name) for saving supporters of Kavanaugh were “complicit in evil”
Wow. Kavanaugh is getting political. “There has been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything...”
“This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” Kavanaugh says.
Kavanaugh is defiant so far, citing denials from alleged witnesses.
Brett Kavanaugh is sworn in. https://t.co/6jKCDERY7o
Brett Kavanaugh enters the hearing room, holding hands with his wife Ashley.
@mr_wess16 thanks bud!
Both Graham and Cornyn told me they still want to have the committee vote tomorrow.
Graham: “All I can say is that we’re 40-something days until the election and their goal, not Ms. Ford’s goal, is to delay this past the midterms so they can win the Senate and never allow Trump to fill this seat. I believe that now more than ever.”
Lindsey Graham is mad as hell. Says he feels “ambushed” because Dems are just trying to “delay” the process till after the midterms.
Harris notes that Ford has asked for an FBI probe, has done a polygraph test, and has asked for outside witnesses to testify.		“Judge Kavanaugh has not,” Harris says.

Hatch says Ford is a “good witness” and “articulate” and “an attractive person.”		Asked what he meant by “attractive” he said: “Oh. In other words, she’s pleasing.”
Coons tells me he went into the hearing with low expectations but has been satisfied so far with the “respectful” and “measured” questions. He thought it’d be more like a “prosecution” of Ford.
Half-hour lunch recess.
I get the criticisms over the time limits in this hearing, but it’s worth noting again that Ford specifically requested that each senator have 5 minutes per witness.
.@ChrisCoons asks Ford to respond to the “boys will be boys” dismissal of her claims.		“The younger you are … it has a worse impact than when your brain is fully developed,” she says.

Here’s what Ford is looking at right now https://t.co/7rHFechg6z
But @SenGillibrand, who doesn’t sit on the committee but was in the audience, walked by TV cameras and said: “I don’t know how any Republican watching this testimony could possibly vote for Kavanaugh after what [Ford] said.”
Chatted with a few Republican senators as they exited and re-entered the hearing room. They’re not saying much of substance, only saying they want to wait till later to comment. I asked for their initial reactions &amp; if they found Ford to be credible.
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch is here too https://t.co/1lxkCto1a1
First 15-minute break.

This is how the Senate works. It alternates between the GOP and Dem sides. Ford’s legal team had requested five-minute rounds. So after 5 minutes, it goes to the other party. https://t.co/6wYuUigZPj
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) got up from the dais, walked over to Ford’s table and handed her a cup of coffee.

Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has arrived.
Usually, hearings like this would take place in the Hart building, which has a much larger hearing room that holds 150+ reporters. Dr. Ford’s legal team specifically asked for limited press access.
Tbh, it’s not even this heavy when President Trump and Vice President Pence come here, which is a few times a month. All of this was requested by Dr. Ford’s legal team in order to ensure her safety.
The second floor of the Dirksen Senate office building is essentially on lockdown. Nobody can get off an elevator without an ID check, and security is the heaviest I’ve ever seen it.

Final point: if Ford testifies Monday &amp; comes off as credible, that does more damage to Kavanaugh’s nomination than anything else. Dems trying to delay the vote will only go so far when they have no power to drag it out.		@pkcapitol said it better: https://t.co/35Lq4IeLHr
Still, it’s going to be tough optics-wise if GOP moves to confirm Kavanaugh under these circumstances—without hearing from Ford under oath. They say she has an opportunity to do that on Monday, take it or leave it. Ford wants FBI probe first. But it’s all up to Grassley.
GOP arguments starting to come into focus after tonight’s news &gt;&gt; aide tells me they’ve been privately wondering whether Ford was collaborating w/ Dems. Her statement tonight echoing D calls for an FBI probe was a “strong indication they’re working closely together,” aide says.

This is correct. Ford’s announcement tonight shifts momentum back to Republicans. Yes, Dems want to delay this as much as possible; but they risk losing their one opportunity for Ford to testify.

Until the very end, he was the best advocate U.S. servicemembers could have ever had. The ability of his colleagues &amp; the journalists who covered him to recognize that simple fact transcends politics or partisanship.		Rest in peace, senator.
He was frail and weak. But his passion and support for the troops never wavered.		"We have cut and cut and cut to the point where we have accidents where our service members are killed and wounded because we refuse to give them what they need to defend the nation. It’s a crime."
He was venting to me his frustrations w/ the recent crashes in the Pacific that killed U.S. sailors. He said they happened because we as a country were not providing them with resources they needed. A staffer wheeled him into the elevator, but he wasn't done.		"Wait, wait, wait."
I could tell he appreciated that because every time he heard it he almost did a double-take. He always answered earnestly and, occasionally, it earned me some coveted elevator chats.		There was one such chat I will never forget. It ended up being the last time I spoke with him.
Many of our conversations with senators are robotic in nature. But in the weeks and months after his devastating diagnosis, I took it upon myself to always end our conversations with a simple, human question: "how are you doing?"
A few notes about John McCain.		I always made it a habit of following him through the tunnels of the Capitol after votes—even if I didn't have a specific question to ask. His presence alone was mesmerizing, and I learned early on that he was always good for a fire quote (duh).

Corker says Trump's skeptical comments about Russian meddling "help create additional disunity with the west" that Russia is already perpetuating.
Corker asks if State Dept. recommended that POTUS use the section 232 authority for steel &amp; aluminum tariffs. Mitchell doesn't answer, only says he supports Trump's trade policies.
Mitchell says Trump's trade policies are working. Corker does a double-take. Interesting exchange right now on tariffs &amp; section 232 authority.
Corker slams Trump's "undisciplined comments" which he says create problems for Congress, the country &amp; the witnesses at today's hearing.
Cardin asks Wess Mitchell, State Dept's Europe/Eurasia chief, if he has been briefed on sanctions-related issues that may have come up in Helsinki. Mitchell says he has the "appropriate information I need to carry out my job."
Menendez presses State Dept. Europe/Eurasia chief Wess Mitchell on why Russia hasn't been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in order to further deter Russian active measures
At hearing, Menendez says waiving some Russia sanctions "undermines the intention of Congress" and of the sanctions themselves. The FY19 NDAA allows some U.S. strategic allies to continue purchasing Russian military equipment without facing sanctions: https://t.co/GuIYsBuIWi
Corker presses State &amp; Treasury officials on whether their toughness on Russia is the "mainstream of the administration from top to bottom."

@benjienglander @united Pointless &amp; a waste of time. No flights leaving or arriving.
Deplaned again. Everything inside the airport is closed. Vending machines won’t take our money. @united won’t compensate hotels.
None. Not even hotel reimbursements for tonight. https://t.co/I2GkRMfppM
Didn’t think it was possible but the sunset just got even better. https://t.co/6aqDDrgt3r
@united Honestly, it’s too late for that. I was rebooked on UA2000 to Dulles tonight. But that’s not going to happen as we’re probably not even making it to Chicago. Would’ve been better if gate agents planned for this instead of assuring me that the Chicago one would arrive on time.
I hate the “X airline sucks” tweets as much as anyone. But @united has caused mayhem for all of us on this flight—including people who had international connections and now can’t get anywhere because they were assured we’d get to Chicago at some point. We’ve deplaned TWICE.
Look, folks. I understand that weather isn’t something the airlines can control. But it would’ve been nice if @united kept me on standby to Dulles instead of convincing me to stay on this Chicago flight and still connect through O’Hare to DCA. It was sheer incompetence.
That feeling when you’re about to take off, ground stop in Chicago forces you to stay on tarmac, and you’re missing your connection to DC and likely not leaving Indianapolis tonight. And traveling internationally in a matter of hours.		But at least there’s this. https://t.co/C7ncZL5pRt
