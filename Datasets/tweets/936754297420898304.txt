@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Well you have an interesting perspective on the issue.  I’ll pray that you never become pregnant.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Then why does it happen in the millions every year?
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline That is not logic at all.  If all the pieces of a biological puzzle come together and without intervention comes to fruition.  It was and is always a person.

@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline If it is supposed to be a person and without intervention becomes a person; it’s a person.  No sane individual would refute that.  May I ask, do you have some guilt that leads you to attempt to rationalize this?
@JediKeri @valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Absolute delusion is more like it.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Well it’s because it’s a living being.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Sure it can, believe me I know, but is it meant to come out under normal circumstances?

@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline No it’s science.  I haven’t made one statement regarding beliefs aka religion.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline But why?
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline A living being isn’t a philosophy.

@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline So you’re defining person?  Why if a woman is pregnant and killed do they charge 2 homicides?
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline So you have blossomed beyond science then?

@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline They are and again science has proven the entire purpose of the reproductive systems.  Are you refuting the science?
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Let’s try to find some common ground.  Explain to us how abortion is “healthcare” in your mind.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Yes they are.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline “Personhood”?  Not even a word.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Not when you become pregnant.  Explain the different DNA.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline If scientists declare cells on Mars life, how can you declare cells (not yours) just cells?

@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Again it’s science.

@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Well there you go, you just confirmed and while there may be medical complications that would lead to death, it’s done without killing.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline A consenting reasonable adult knows exactly the potential outcome of intercourse and in that a separate living being is created; anyone’s choice is since removed.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline You seem so knowledgeable.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline It is.  What is the purpose of the entire reproductive system in both genders?
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline It’s entirely material.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline The cells found on Mars, the scientific world declared it like, so the feeble excuse doesn’t hold any value.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline No it’s not, except in the case where the pregnancy is determined to be of an imminent threat to your life.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Yes it is, as is that of a fetus and here’s a simple tip: both parties can utilize birth control instead of irresponsibility.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Then why did scientists discover life on Mars?  Convenient but incorrect.
@valkmer2 @JediKeri @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Require or want?  There’s a stark difference.
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline PS a woman can not get pregnant alone; ever!  Not your decision alone and never should be!
@valkmer2 @ChrisLoesch @TerriersFan @RadioFreeTom @redsteeze @MollyJongFast @CathyYoung63 @DavidAFrench @xan_desanctis @EricaGrieder @SohrabAhmari @matthewschmitz @BulwarkOnline Self defense is the only justification for homicide.
