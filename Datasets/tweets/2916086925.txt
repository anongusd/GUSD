Last year‚Äôs First STEP Act was just that ‚Äì a first step.  There is still so much work to be done. Cedric and I will send a message to President Trump and Congress that we need to continue our efforts to truly reform our criminal justice system.
There are striking inequities in our criminal justice system and it is clear that we are over-criminalizing and over-processing certain communities and crimes.
For women, incarceration is up 700% with African American women six times more likely to be incarcerated than white women, and Latinas are twice as likely.
Half of African American men will be arrested at some point in their lives. Right here in NC, African Americans account for 52% of the incarcerated population and only 28% of the state‚Äôs total population

There is no rational excuse for low-income families, seniors, and veterans to be threatened with homelessness over an expensive, ineffective wall.
In the 12th District, we are already facing an affordable housing shortage. The loss of HUD‚Äôs rental assistance because of the #TrumpShutdown would be absolutely devastating for our community.
In North Carolina, over 135,000 low-income households rely on federal rental assistance to help ensure there is a roof over their heads and a safe place to sleep.
This reckless #Trumpshutdown must not continue. In addition to 800k federal workers potentially missing their next paycheck, millions of Americans including poor children, families, seniors, veterans, and persons with disabilities may soon be faced with irreparable harm.
@Potus continues to tell lies to instill fear using 800,000 federal workers as leverage to build a wall. It is cruel and cold hearted. House Democrats have passed legislation to reopen the government. Now it is his turn. #PresidentialAddress

As a former teacher and supporter of #ESSA &amp; the #AIMHigherAct, I urge @BetsyDevosEd to focus on the true purpose of her job FOR ONCE - promoting student achievement, educational excellence, and equal access. Guns do not belong in schools! #PERIOD
Title IV supports important educational programs - college &amp; career prep, arts education, mental health, drug &amp; violence prevention, &amp; so much more. Guns for teachers is not one of them. This proposal would be an unprecedented misstep by the #Trump administration.
What teachers need is funding for supplies and their classrooms, not guns! @BetsyDevosEd would know this if she spent half as much time in classrooms as she did scheming with her boss to misuse education funding and put our students‚Äô lives at risk. https://t.co/OgNpDDCOPV

NC farmers are already reeling from retaliatory tariffs from Canada, Mexico &amp; the EU and now they are being hit again. Our state is the 2nd leading exporter of pork, a $4 billion industry, but these tariffs will have effects that extend far beyond the farmland.
Trump's trade war is escalating tensions with our allies, putting the entire NC economy at risk. More than 1.2 million North Carolina jobs are supported by trade and over $1 billion in state exports are threatened by Trump‚Äôs tariffs.
President Trump‚Äôs misguided tariffs will only serve to raise the price of consumer goods, meaning our middle-class will soon be forced to do more with less. #JuneJobsReport
Last month, 213,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy. Job growth remains strong, but stagnant wages are harming our middle-class.
This is just wrong and it harms our military readiness by forcing current reservists to serve multiple tours of duty.		https://t.co/Px2Rg5fB9v
It's sad that President Trump's anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda is seeping into our nation's military. Many immigrant U.S. Army reservists honorably served their country, with the hope of U.S. citizenship, only to be abruptly discharged and possibly face future deportation.

I am calling on my colleagues in Congress to support a bipartisan, comprehensive solution that protects every American form senseless gun violence.
No one should feel vulnerable or threatened in these spaces. Children should not have to live in fear of the next mass shooting coming to their school‚Äîa place that is supposed to be a nurturing safe haven for all.
With the end of gun violence prevention month in June, we cannot lose our focus on putting a stop to this growing epidemic that‚Äôs facing our nation. Schools, churches, movie theaters, and, recently, newsrooms have experienced a massive and tragic loss of innocent life.
The next SCOTUS nominee is a deeply troubling prospect. These candidates are being chosen on political beliefs, not their merits or qualifications. America deserves a justice who will place the Constitution and the America people before any partisan issues or personal biases.
Today marks the 54th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act signed by LBJ. The act remains the gold standard for what we hope to accomplish as we continue to fight for the message behind it: equal rights for everyone regardless of your race, religion, country, or identity. https://t.co/0Wb4Ls7hn8

Across the nation, and in the NC state house, the right to vote has been under attack through voter ID laws and purging voter rolls. We must stand firm against repeated attempts to undermine our right to vote. Remember, civic engagement is not only a right, but a responsibility.
The Trump Administration has resumed its assault on Americans with pre-existing health conditions, this time removing protections under the ACA. This will weaken the market, and leave millions without health care. The fight is still on to #Protectourcare.

The President shouldn't &amp; doesn't have a blank check to go to war. One night of airstrikes does not constitute a thoughtful plan that keeps our military safe, protects innocent civilian lives, or holds Putin accountable for his role in enabling Assad. #SyriaStrike
Tonight‚Äôs attack was carried out without a long term military plan. President Trump must present Congress with a comprehensive and clear plan of action and secure an Authorization for Use of Military Force before any further attacks are carried out.
The latest chemical weapons attack against the Syrian people is a brutal war crime that demands a strong and strategic response. #SyriaStrike

I call on Congress to exercise its oversight power to investigate this report and dig deeper to identify the cause of this lack of progress.  It's time we take ownership of this issue and develop best practices to diversify our workforce as we move forward.
If our policymakers aren't a reflection of the diverse nation we serve, we cannot expect that the policies they produce will address the challenges faced by our diverse citizenry.
As we continue to challenge the private sector to increase diversity, we must take a hard look at our own diversity and inclusion practices to ensure our workforce and senior leadership reflects the American people who we serve.
