Very strange -- 		Trump did not wait for the Speaker to introduce him to the Congress, which is the protocol ... 		Pelosi looked surprised that Trump began without waiting for her to introduce him.
Trump will tell Congress: "Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century."
.@MarkKnoller reminds us, Trump has taken 19 trips to Mar-a-Lago since he took office, spending all or part of 81 days there.
GAO identified $60,000 in expenses paid directly to the Mar-a-Lago club for the four trips it studied.  The govt paid for lodging of WH Military Office personnel and operational space for Secret Service on site.		GAO says most Secret Service agents stayed at nearby hotels.
The full GAO report -- requested by congressional Democrats -- is available here: https://t.co/xbiwjkWh3v
For Trump's sons' travel --		The Secret Service spent nearly $400k to protect Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump on three trips, while they traveled to Uruguay, the Dominican Republic and the UAE in early 2017.
The lion's share of the cost estimate -- some $10.6 million -- is attributed to "operating costs of government aircraft and boats." 		Another $3 mil was spent on transportation, lodging, meals, incidental expenses for traveling govt personnel.
JUST IN: A look at what it costs taxpayers when Trump goes to Mar-a-Lago ... 		GAO dug into just four trips over the span of a month at the beginning of Trump's term, Feb 3-Mar 5, 2017.		DOD/DHS costs ran to nearly $13.6 million.

As reporters left the Oval, one asked him for more details of when he'll announce location/date for Kim summit, Trump again said he'd reveal that info "early next week" and then added, "probably State of the Union."
Trump says he discussed his views of Iran and NK with his intelligence chiefs today, and they responded by saying they were "totally misquoted" in the press.		"They said it was fake news," he told reporters.
"I think that we have made tremendous progress" in trade talks with China, Trump tells reporters. 		"That doesn't mean you're going to have a deal," he said. "But I can say there is a tremendous relationship, and warm feeling, and we've made tremendous progress."

BREAKING: Pelosi formally tells Trump in a letter that she will not put a concurrent resolution on the floor to convene a joint session of Congress to hear the State of the Union during the shutdown.
While leading Dems have suggested it would be unlikely for Trump to give the SOTU during the shutdown, they have not formally rescinded the invitation. 		In theory, the House could prevent the otherwise perfunctory passage of a joint resolution setting up the joint session.
Trump's letter adds, "It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!" https://t.co/SOd22epwFx
JUST IN: Trump sends Pelosi a letter advising her, "I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty" to deliver the State of the Union address on Jan 29th.
Read all about it, and see crosstabs and details on methodology, here:		https://t.co/gvmENJ4yjz
Americans in our CBS NEWS POLL are split down the middle over whether Trump should give the State of the Union address if the government is still shutdown.		Yes, he should 48%	No, he should postpone 48%
MORE FROM CBS NEWS POLL:		Who is doing a better job handling negotiations over the shutdown?		Nancy Pelosi 47%	Donald Trump 35%	Neither 10%
Economic optimism in America still prevails, though it is down from a recent high (74% in November said the economy was "good").		State of Nation's Economy:		Good 68%	Bad 30%
That said, the president's approval rating among self-described Republicans and conservatives has slipped a bit in recent months.		In November, 85% of Republicans approved of Trump's job performance. Now it's 77%.  		Among conservatives, it was 75% in Nov.  Today, it's 65%.
The shutdown has taken President Trump's disapproval to a new high in the CBS NEWS POLL. 		While approval rating is down 3 points since November, it has held relatively steady.		Approve 36%	Disapprove 59%
IS THE WALL WORTH THE SHUTDOWN?  		CBS NEWS POLL:		Yes 28%	No 71%		(However, most Republicans -- 56% -- say the wall is worth the shutdown.)
BUT ...  Among Republicans:		Refuse a budget unless it has wall funding 65%.		Agree to a budget without wall funding 30%
CBS NEWS POLL:		Which do you want President Trump to do now?		Agree to a budget without wall funding 66%		Refuse a budget unless it has wall funding 31%.
Rep. Peterson (D-MN) told Fox News earlier this month that calls from constituents in his Western Minnesota district, which borders Fargo, were running overwhelmingly in favor of the wall. https://t.co/SAuMVH8YQ3
Then again ... it'll be interesting to see what happens if/when the Trump proposal fails. How many Republicans might then vote for the Feb 8th House-passed CR, which the Senate previously passed unanimously before Christmas?
A showdown has been set in the Senate -- on the Trump proposal to end the shutdown, and a House-passed Democratic alternative. 		The key votes will begin at 2:30pm Thursday. 		Each measure would need 60 votes to advance, but neither are expected to.
We do, sporadically, have the opportunity to engage the president and members of his staff. 		But as @Oknox properly puts it, the "robust, public-back-and-forth" in the briefing room shows the country and the world that "no one in a healthy republic is above being questioned."

WH official offers these points to @FinnyGo: 	- Pelosi spent Christmas in Hawaii during the shutdown, while Trump remained in DC.	- Some Democrats went to Puerto Rico, and some were seen sunbathing, while Trump and the GOP were "waiting at the table."
WH official says Pelosi's trip "would have guaranteed" that federal workers remain without pay "because she would not have been here to negotiate any kind of deal."		Still, the official says, Trump "made clear in the letter she can still go, but must do so commercially."
White House sources tell @CBSNews the military aircraft flying Pelosi overseas was due to take off at 3pmET.  		Trump's letter 'postponing' the trip was released by the White House at 2:12pET.
Minority Whip Steve Scalise first revealed the trip in a session with reporters earlier this afternoon. @Steve_Dorsey reports Scalise staffers told him and other reporters they saw bags packed, ready for the trip, outside the Speaker's office.
The details of Pelosi's planned travel to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan -- particularly those destinations -- had not been previously announced. Earlier today her aides asked news organizations not to report that the trip would take place, citing national security.
As commander-in-chief, the president has the power to block the military from flying members of Congress overseas. This move -- surely a response to Pelosi's SOTU disinvite -- only heightens the tension between the country's two most powerful leaders.
Trump's letter calls Pelosi's trip a "public relations event," and says if she wants to continue on the trip by flying commercial, "that would certainly be your prerogative."
BREAKING: Trump sends Pelosi a letter, informing her that the trip she intended to take to "Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan" has been postponed.

JUST IN: Following letter from Pelosi to Trump citing security concerns during the shutdown, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer makes clear that unless agencies are funded, "The State of the Union is off." Hoyer made that statement in an interview with CNN.
Pelosi's letter notes that from the founding until Woodrow Wilson's presidency, State of the Union messages -- required "from time to time" by the constitution -- were delivered in writing.
IS HE UNINVITED????		If they do not "work together" to reschedule, Pelosi suggests Trump could submit his State of the Union address "in writing" on the scheduled date of the speech.
@SpeakerPelosi "I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date [for the State of the Union] after government has re-opened," Pelosi says in letter to Trump.

By a 424-1 vote, the House adopts Clyburn's resolution rejecting "White nationalism and White supremacy," meant as a rebuke of Rep. Steve King's quote in NYT. 		Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) voted no, arguing King should have been censured instead.
Earlier, Rep. Steve King said he would vote in support of the resolution, because he agreed with its "resolved" clause - he even said he'd make it stronger.
HAPPENING NOW: House is voting on the Clyburn resolution rejecting "White nationalism and White supremacy." 		It references the quote of Rep. Steve King in the NYT, among other recent examples of offensive speech, but does not call for any specific punishment of King.
On the House floor, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) forcefully calls for Rep. King to be censured by the House.		Trivia -- Ryan holds the seat once occupied by the last man to be expelled by the House, former Rep. Jim Traficant.
The Commandant of the Coast Guard has written his forces, who aren't being paid: "To the best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our Nation‚Äôs history that servicemembers in a U.S. Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in appropriations." https://t.co/amiAggmvAv
The House resolution condemning "White nationalism and White supremacy" is being brought up under suspension of the rules, requiring a 2/3rds vote. With Rep. King announcing he will vote for it, it may wind up passing unanimously.
King says he'll vote FOR the resolution meant to respond to his remarks. "I agree with that language," Rep. King says, referencing the Resolved clause.		King says he would "strengthen" it by adding a condemnation of "anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology" of Nazism.
The resolution references Rep. King only once -- and does not call for any censure or punishment of Iowa's only House Republican.
H.Res.41 begins: "Whereas, on January 10, 2019, Representative Steve King	was quoted as asking,'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization‚Äîhow did that language become	offensive?'"
HAPPENING NOW: Rep. Steve King is on the floor responding to Rep. Clyburn's resolution rejecting "White nationalism and White supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance."		The resolution's first whereas clause references King's recent quote to the NYT.

Trump is having lunch with nine members of Congress, aiming to "solve the border crisis and reopen the government." 		"Unfortunately, no Democrats will attend," @PressSec says.
DOJ spokeswoman Kelly Laco, responding to Furman's ruling, signals Trump admin will appeal: 		"Our government is legally entitled to include a citizenship question on the census and people in the United States have a legal obligation to answer."
Specifically, Judge Furman says a citizenship question on the census would lead to a decline in self-responses by noncitizens by "at least 5.8%," an estimate he describes as "conservative."
Furman says those who brought this case have "proved" that a citizenship question in the 2020 Census would lead to an undercount of noncitizen and Hispanic households.
Judge Jesse Furman's opinion says Ross's stated rationale for asking about citizenship -- to better enforce the Voting Rights Act -- is not backed up by the record. Instead, Furman says Ross had an "anxious desire" to insert the Q for unknown, pretextual reasons.
JUST IN: Federal judge in New York rules Commerce Dept cannot insert citizenship question on 2020 Census, that in trying to add it, Sec. Ross violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

"There is no path forward for the House bill," Flake says. "The next time that we vote will be on the agreement, not another test vote."

"It's now clear there are enough votes to proceed," McConnell says.

Pence is in the chair, set to break the tie on the motion to proceed.
Flake just changed his vote on the motion to proceed. Corker also voted for it.		Doug Jones (D-AL) also votes to proceed.
McConnell continues standing at his desk, waiting to speak. He's been there for more than 20 minutes.		The open vote to proceed to the House-passed CR now stands at 44-47, per C-SPAN.
A bill to fund government agencies would be the last bill put on the floor by House Speaker Paul Ryan.		His predecessor, John Boehner, was reviled for putting compromise bills on the floor over conservative objections at the last minute.
McCarthy says no vote is scheduled. The House is waiting for the Senate to act and will advise colleagues on next steps.		"There's talk," McCarthy says in a floor colloquy with Hoyer. "We have our bill over there..." but he hopes a compromise can be reached.

Some federal workers who had planned to travel, take time off over the holidays, would have to report to work if they're "excepted" from furlough. All pre-approved leave would be cancelled. And, of course, there's the mystery about the timing of paychecks.
Mick Mulvaney, the president's budget chief and incoming chief-of-staff, told reporters in Jan 2018 that the Obama administration "could have made the shutdown in 2013 much less impactful."		Mulvaney says the Obama admin "chose to make it worse" by closing national parks, etc.
In the Jan 2018 shutdown that lasted from Saturday to Monday, open-air national parks were kept open. Impacts were difficult to illustrate.		One intangible is the loss of productivity, in the hours that agencies spend shutting down their operations. There's a protocol.
Federal agencies are -always- closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  It just so happens that Monday and Tuesday are federal holidays.		Furloughed workers might not have to worry about what they'd have to do until Wednesday.
As of this tweet, it wasn't clear whether the Smithsonian museums would be open tomorrow if funding runs out tonight.		(Smithsonian policy says that if a shutdown occurs on a Friday night, the museums can STAY OPEN through the weekend and close on Monday!)
Lots of people are curious about the impact of a "partial shutdown." 		This is a challenge for us to explain.  		THREAD ...
RT @f_neiles82: @stevenportnoy @amandacarpenter And Dept of Commerce...forgot that one
This is happening because Congress only finished working on SOME of the appropriations bills that fund the federal agencies. 		The ones that were left on the table cover the agencies that would shut down tonight.		Anyway, that's why you'll hear the phrase "partial shutdown."
NASA would be affected by the shut down, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would stay open, fully funded.		It's quite random. And confounding for those of us charged with explaining it. Good luck, writers!
Rules on who is "essential" aren't consistent from agency to agency. FDA food inspectors could be furloughed, but USDA food inspectors would stay on the job.
But a shutdown would affect:		State / Homeland Security / Justice / Transportation / Treasury / HUD / USDA / FDA / Interior / EPA / Judiciary / DC Govt / Independent Agencies / White House
WHAT'S A "PARTIAL" SHUTDOWN?		Keep in mind, the following agencies have been fully funded thru FY19 and would NOT shut down:		DOD / VA / Education / Energy / Labor / HHS (mostly) / Legislative Agencies

Ok, folks. Standby for this newsy day to continue getting newsier.		Heading back to the WH for the briefing ...
NOTE -- Flynn's sentencing has not been set for March.  		A status hearing, at which both sides will report the situation then in place regarding Flynn's cooperation in other cases, will occur in March.
Sullivan concludes the proceedings by wishing the parties happy holidays.		And this dizzying sentencing-hearing-that-wasn't ends at 12:57pmET.
BREAKING: Judge Sullivan DELAYS the sentencing of Gen. Michael Flynn, sets a status hearing for March 13th.
A SIGNAL --		Judge Sullivan says he disagrees with the plea agreement that saw Gen. David Petraeus avoid felony charges.
Judge Sullivan repeats he won't make any promises when it comes time to deliver his sentence.
BREAKING: Flynn's attorneys say they are now taking the judge up on his offer to delay today's sentencing because he's still cooperating with prosecutors.
"General Flynn has held nothing back [from prosecutors].  Nothing," says his defense lawyer, Robert Kelner.
"I felt terrible about that," Sullivan says, after the prosecutor notes Flynn's conduct as a foreign agent ended in mid-Nov 2016.		"I'm not suggesting he committed treason," Sullivan adds, further apologizing for his remarks in the prior session.
Sullivan begins by BACKTRACKING on his remarks that Flynn was an unregistered foreign agent while working in the White House, and that he may have committed treason.
BACK IN SESSION:		Judge Sullivan reconvenes court at 12:42pET.
Flynn has reentered the courtroom, after taking the judge up on his offer to confer with his lawyers before moving forward to sentencing.		We're waiting on Judge Sullivan to come back.
Sullivan recesses until 12:30pmET because Flynn has asked for the chance to confer with his lawyers before moving forward...
DID FLYNN COMMIT TREASON?		Sullivan is now asking the special counsel's office whether it ever considered charging Flynn with treason.		Prosecutor Brandon Van Grack struggles to answer, saying it wasn't considered.
I gotta tell you folks, this is pretty good drama. 		It's a shame federal courts have decided the public shouldn't be able to see this on television.
Sullivan: "I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain, for this criminal offense."		Giving Flynn the chance to delay until he's finished cooperating, Sullivan says he "can't promise anything" about the sentence he's about to hand down.
SULLIVAN WARNS FLYNN OF A PRISON SENTENCE: 		"You were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the National Security Adviser to the president!  		"Arguably, this undermines everything this flag over here stands for! Arguably, you sold your country out!"
Sullivan repeats the phrase "very serious offense" to describe Flynn's crime... "in the West Wing!" 		"The aggravating circumstances are serious," Sullivan says.
Judge Sullivan is giving Flynn yet another chance to delay -- now telling him it's his "prerogative" whether to move forward -- because he hasn't necessarily finished offering helpful information to the government that might mitigate a sentence.
Prosecutor Van Grack says Flynn provided "substantial assistance" in the case announced yesterday, involving his work as an unregistered agent of the government of Turkey, and could have been charged in connection with that case.
Mueller prosecutor Brandon van Grack haltingly tells Sullivan it is a "possibility" that Flynn is still cooperating with the special counsel's office.
Sullivan describes Flynn's crime as a "very serious offense" -- a high ranking government official lying to the FBI, and doing it "while on the physical premises of the White House."
Judge Sullivan has sent Flynn and his attorneys back to their table. 		He says he wants to now go over Flynn's plea agreement and the facts that went into it.
One final time, and still sounding skeptical, Sullivan asks Flynn, "If you want to proceed because you are guilty of this offense..."		Flynn says he is, and wants to proceed.		Sullivan accepts the plea.
Saying he's "puzzled" by the documents he's seen, Sullivan makes it explicitly clear he was concerned by the circumstances of the FBI interview, but Flynn and his attorneys are *repeatedly* declining the judge's offers to delay or steer the proceeding off course.
Defense Attorney Robert Kelner says Flynn "fully accepts responsibility" and "stands by his guilty plea."  He says he included for judge information he "might want to see" for sentencing purposes.
Judge is still probing, asking Flynn's attorneys:		"My question is, how is raising those contentions about the circumstances [of the FBI interview] consistent with his acceptance of responsibility?"
Sullivan now asks Flynn's attorney if he believes his client was entrapped by the FBI.		"No, your honor," says the lawyer.
Sullivan asks if Flynn is ready to accept responsibility 		"I am, your honor," Flynn answers forcefully.		Sullivan asks if Flynn would rather postpone the proceedings.  He declines the offer.
Sullivan asks Flynn if he was aware that lying to the FBI was illegal.		"I was aware," Flynn says.		He is NOT taking Sullivan's offer to withdraw his guilty plea.
Sullivan asks Flynn if he wishes to challenge the circumstances under which he was interviewed.		Flynn says NO.
WHOA.  Judge Sullivan says the circumstances of Flynn's FBI interview, as raised by his attorneys last week, "concerned the court."  		Sullivan says they raise "issues that may call into question his guilty plea."
NOW UNDERWAY: Flynn's sentencing has begun. 		Judge Emmet Sullivan -- who was not the judge who accepted Flynn's guilty plea -- says he wants to "focus on some of the issues" before he moves forward.
Across town, the Justice Department has unveiled the final rule banning bump stocks, a year and three months after the Las Vegas shooting.

Recapping -- the Special Counsel has released two semi-redacted documents detailing the FBI's interview of Flynn. 		They flesh out the story Flynn's lawyers told in their sentencing memo this week, and reveal more inside baseball on Comey/McCabe/Strzok/Yates.
Here's the basis of what you've been hearing from Trump this week --		"Strzok and [redacted fellow agent] both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying. Flynn struck Strzok as 'bright, but not profoundly sophisticated.'"
This line pops out of the FBI report: 		"Flynn was so talkative, and had so much time for them, that Strzok wondered if the National Security Adviser did not have more important things to do..."
Months after the Flynn interview, Strzok told investigators that as he got a West Wing tour from Flynn, he watched as Trump worked with movers to decide where to place some artwork. Trump walked by the FBI men, "but nobody paid attention to the agents."
In documents filed by the Special Counsel, DOJ's caretaker Sally Yates, is described as "not happy" to hear that McCabe had sent FBI agents to the WH to interview Flynn without her knowledge.
"LTG Flynn questioned how so much information had been made public and asked if we thought it had been leaked," McCabe wrote. "I replied that we were quite concerned about what we perceived as significant leaks [REDACTED]..."
"LTG Flynn then explained that he had been trying to 'build relationships' with the Russians," McCabe wrote. "He then stated that I probably knew what was said [REDACTED]..."
McCabe, in his Jan 24, 2017 memo, writes of how he and Comey felt the FBI should interview Flynn "in light of the significant media coverage and public discussion about his recent contacts with Russian representatives."
The Special Counsel's office has filed a redacted version of one of the McCabe memos, written by him on Jan 24, 2017 ... the day he sent two agents (incl Strzok) to the WH to interview Flynn.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller reports taxpayers spent $4.6 million on his investigation between April 1 - Sept 30 of this year.

At the Capitol, Schumer tells reporters he didn't expect Trump to call in the press.
Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Schumer calls Trump's remarks in the Oval Office a "temper tantrum."
Trump: "I'll take it. You know what I'll say? Yes. If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through the military ... I will shut down the government."
"This is a most unfortunate thing," Pelosi says, lamenting the on camera back-and-forth. 		"But it's not bad, Nancy. It's called transparency," Trump replies.
Pelosi says 50 Republican lawmakers are losing their jobs. 		Trump tries to interject that the GOP gained in the Senate.		SCHUMER: "When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble."
"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward," Pelosi says, saying the conversation should focus on the needs of the American people. "People are losing jobs, the markets are in a mood..."
Schumer: "You're bragging about what has been done."		Trump: "By us."		Schumer: "We want to do the same thing we did last year this year. That's our proposal."
Pelosi: "Let's call a halt to this. We've come in here as the first branch of government - Article I. ... We're coming here in good faith to negotiate with you about how we can keep the gov't open."
Schumer starts in -- 		"The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios..."
"The fact is, you do not have the votes in the House," Pelosi says.		"Nancy, I do," Trump responds.
"If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session," Trump says.		"Go do it!" Pelosi says.  "Don't put it on the Senate. Put it on the negotiation."
"That's not the point, Mr. President," Pelosi says to Trump's 60-vote-Senate.		"The point is that there are equities to be weighed," Pelosi says. "I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this..."
Pelosi tells Trump, "You have the votes, you should pass it..."		Trump interrupts.		"No, we don't have the votes, Nancy. Because in the Senate, we need 60 votes..."
Pelosi, called on by Trump, begins by thanking him for the meeting, "so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people."
"I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown. We will see what happens over the next short period of time. But the wall is a very important thing to us," Trump says.
"A lot of wall has been built. We don't talk about that, but we might as well start," Trump says.
Trump jokingly calls the wall "the easy one" for Congress to tackle. He asks Schumer what he thinks about that. 		"It's called funding the government, Mr. President," Schumer responds, unsmiling.
Trump beings by saying it's a "great honor" to have Pelosi and Schumer at the White House, says of criminal justice reform, it "looks like it's hopefully going to be passing."
The Trump-Pelosi-Schumer exchange lasts 16-and-one-half minutes. I've just gotten a copy of the radio pool audio ...

It's complicated. But I do attempt to answer your (very good) questions here -- https://t.co/Z7BK05iyi9
This is, of course, not to say that one can't "report" without a pass. It's just to illustrate that there is a difference. Getting a "hard pass" is hard -- and it's mainly meant to ensure a more rapid flow thru security for those assigned to work here each day.
In the event of an impromptu press conference, late schedule add, other breaking news event, only those with hard passes can rest assured that they'll get to their broadcast positions in time -- especially if the Avenue is closed to all pedestrians except passholders.
Once your hard pass application is approved by the press office, you're then sent up for a Secret Service background check. This can take months. You still have to show your DL at the gate thou. With Penna Ave now more frequently restricted to passholders only, you might be SOL.
There are a lot of ways it can get screwed up thou. If there's a data entry problem (SSN or DOB typos), you won't get in. If the press office missed your desk editor's email, you won't get in. Etc.
To obtain a daily pass, a reporter's assignment editor must ask the press office to "clear in" the reporter the next day. Vital statistics are run thru the Sec Svc WAVES system. Each day, the reporter must show his driver's license at the gate to obtain a temporary pass.
Traditionally, you must first establish "frequency" as a reporter or technician on the WH beat before the press office will authorize the processing of your application, submitted by your news org. Such frequency is established by entries on daily passes.
This "hard pass" vs "day pass" thing is understandably difficult for anyone who hasn't had DIRECT experience with it to understand. I reported in Washington for 12 years before I got one. It's not simple to explain how one is obtained. https://t.co/1Cg6xY8t3s

The WH filing argues CNN has nearly 50 people (incl cameramen, soundmen, other techs) w/permanent credentials, therefore its interests aren't harmed by Acosta ban.		News orgs will argue that's irrelevant, if the WH takes away their right to assign who reports from the WH.
The question the CNN complaint raises is not whether the WH can block reporters from entering, but whether, if reporters are admitted, a particular one can be denied entry arbitrarily, for reasons other than security. 		The WH argues the president has full discretion to do so.
DOJ's reply to CNN's complaint relies most heavily on the notion that the president has "discretion" to decide with whom to engage or not, and thus what reporters to ban from the White House.		The president decided to engage with Acosta last week. In fact, he called on him.
In a joint statement, the following news organizations say they will submit amicus briefs in support of CNN, in CNN v Trump:		AP	Bloomberg	First Look Media	Fox News	Gannett	NBC News	New York Times	POLITICO	EW Scripps	USA Today Network	Washington Post
The announcement that Fox News would back CNN's lawsuit came just minutes before the 11am deadline for the WH to submit its response to the CNN complaint. The first hearing in the case is at 3:30pmET in US Dist Ct.

CNN's complaint claims the WH rejected Acosta's application for a day pass on Nov 8th, the day after his hard pass was confiscated by the Secret Service. https://t.co/0bu894hg5g
The regulation was drafted as a result of a federal lawsuit, won in 1977 by a writer whose application for a hard pass was rejected. The DC Circuit ruled the Sec Svc must devise "narrow and specific" standards for denials.
CNN lawsuit points to US Sec Service regulations (31 CFR 409.1), indicating its press pass decisions "will be guided solely by the principle of whether the applicant presents a potential source of physical danger to the President and/or the family of the President."

The legal difficulty for Trump is that Congress specifically extended asylum rights to anyone who comes into the country, whether at or between ports of entry. 		SCOTUS may eventually be asked to weigh the conflicting legal positions.
The new regulation aimed at denying asylum to those who don‚Äôt come in at ports of entry leans heavily on a law giving the president the power to bar ‚Äúany class of aliens‚Äù if he deems them ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to US interests. 		SCOTUS upheld that power in the travel ban case this year.

@dmartosko Yup - but that holding was later clarified/overturned in Wong Kim Ark (1898). The court held that because his Chinese parents had a "permanent domicil and residence" in the US, he was a citizen at birth. (A test case today, I suppose, could involve so-called "birth tourists.")
@dmartosko Keep reading - see Sen Conness's remarks on pg 2891. A Californian, he explains the amendment would in fact cover the children of those from China. Opponents raised the issue ... and lost the vote.
@dmartosko But the way that sentence is structured, without a conjunction, its meaning is ambiguous. One way to read it he was ONLY referring to the children of diplomats, casting THEM as "foreigners, aliens," and not, say, the US-born children of Chinese laborers--a key focus of the debate

Congress not only overrode Johnson's veto, enacting the bill by a 2/3rds vote in both houses, it subsequently passed the 14th Amendment, which was then ratified by the states.		Birthright citizenship was debated at the time. History suggests it prevailed in the debate.
The 14th Amendment was ratified after Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. 		A racist, he lamented that under the law, "the Chinese of the Pacific States," Native Americans, "the people called Gypsies," and "our entire colored population" would become citizens.

Trump met with West at Trump Tower after the election in December 2016. The two posed for pictures in the lobby. 		"We discussed life," Trump told reporters as West posed with his arms folded.
The president RT'd West and added, "Thank you Kanye, very cool!"

Interestingly, Judge Kavanaugh has cited Federalist 69 as one of his favorites. I wonder how he, as a textualist, would approach this view of the VP's power to cast a vote, vis a vis the appointments clause, in light of Langford's argument ...
Yale law professor John Langford blogs about his theory here -- https://t.co/AtrVwwDPDk
History has taken a different path, but it's worth noting that in Federalist 69, Hamilton suggested that VPs would NOT be able to cast tie-breaking votes to confirm appointments. https://t.co/HUPt6ssanF		("[I]if the Senate should be divided, no appointment could be made...")
The narrowness of the 1881 vote raises an interesting point -- there's never been a tiebreaking VP vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice. In fact, the NYT account of the Senate's Matthews debate reflects the then-common understanding that a tie vote would've been a *defeat*... https://t.co/SwWNGtqrIG
Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed 52-48 in 1991. 		The Senate last rejected a nominee in 1987, turning down Robert Bork by a vote of 42-58.
Justice Stanley Matthews, initially rejected by the Senate when put up by Rutherford Hayes, was renominated by James Garfield and confirmed by a vote of 24-23 on May 14, 1881. https://t.co/HkYq7hUFfk
A SCOTUS SENATE SQUEAKER:		If the 51-49 vote threshold holds, Brett Kavanaugh will be installed on the high court by the narrowest confirmation margin since 1881.

Because of the nature of the offenses, the amount of money involved, the sentencing guidelines actually RUN OVER the statutory maximum of five years for each  count.		In other words, the guidelines will not help Manafort here.
"I do."		Manafort agrees in court to "fully and truthfully" cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller.
Judge Jackson advises Manafort he could face up to five years in prison for each of the two counts he's pleading guilty to today, which could run consecutively to the sentence he'll receive in the Virginia case.
"I did."		Over and over, Manafort affirmatively answers judge's questions about whether he truly committed the offenses.

In his final appearance on @60Minutes, McCain told Lesley Stahl last year:		"I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say, wait a minute, wait a minute. You've been around a long time, old man. You've had a great life."
McCain said in 2008 he's the "luckiest guy" Scott Pelley would ever meet:		"Several plane crashes, several narrow escapes, several stories that just defy the imagination. I'm the most fortunate person that you'll ever interview and I appreciate it every single day."
In 2008 on @60Minutes, McCain told Scott Pelley it would be unwise for the US to withdraw from Iraq:		"I disagree with what the majority of the American people want. Failure will lead to chaos. Withdrawal will lead to chaos."
On @60Minutes, June 6, 1999:		WALLACE: Why is it that a lot of your colleagues roll their eyes when I ask them about John McCain? 		McCAIN: Mike, people may not like me for this, but I do believe that they respect me. And, frankly, at the end of the day, that's what's important.
In June 1999, McCain told Mike Wallace on @60Minutes, "My party is in the majority in both houses, and--and this pork barreling still goes on. It's just disgusting."
Returning to his Vietnamese prison in 1985, McCain told Walter Cronkite on CBS Reports: 		"There's no doubt that all of us were weak from time to time. I was. Unfortunately, not all of us can emulate John Wayne, but I think the overwhelming majority of us did the best we could."
@CBSNewsRadio @CBSNews On March 14, 1973, CBS's Bruce Dunning reported that of the 108 POW's released from Vietnam that day, John McCain was the "most seriously marked" by his time in captivity. 		"But his smile was broad," Dunning reported, as McCain saluted the commander of US forces in the Pacific.

Judge Ellis, OUTSIDE the presence of the jury, said he would be inclined to accept a partial verdict. But he urged jurors to keep working toward a unanimous decision on all 18 counts. Deliberations continued at 12:00pm. (2/2)
MANAFORT‚Äî WHERE THINGS STAND:		At 10:55am, jurors sent Judge Ellis a note indicating they‚Äôre hung up on at least one of the 18 counts Manafort faces. They asked what their failure to reach agreement on a single count might mean to the final verdict. (1/2)

"The simple fact of the matter is that Judge Gee has put this executive branch into an untenable position," Hamilton said in a conference call with reporters.
DOJ's Gene Hamilton says whether families will be able to stay together for more than 20 days is up to federal district court judge Dolly Gee, in whose court the Flores case sits.		"Are we going to be able to detain alien families together, or are we not?" Hamilton asked.
On a conference call with reporters, DOJ official Gene Hamilton was unable to explain how the order might impact the 2,342 children who were taken from their parents/guardians between May 5th and June 9th.
"We're keeping families together, and this will solve that problem," Trump said as he signed the order.		BUT WAIT ! https://t.co/XzIUejvMjw
JUST IN: Senior Justice Department official Gene Hamilton confirms the Flores settlement still controls, and that unless Congress or the court acts, the government can only detain families together for "up to 20 days."
Important note from @PaulaReidCBS -- For now, until Congress overrides Flores or it's modified, there's no guarantee families together in DHS custody won't be separated AFTER 20 DAYS.
WHAT DOES THE ORDER DO?		- Directs DHS to detain families together while parents are prosecuted.		- Orders the DOD to house immigrant families on military posts if needed.		- Instructs DOJ to seek a modification to Flores to allow detention of minors thru parents' criminal cases.
NEW: Executive order directs DOJ to seek to modify the Flores settlement to allow DHS to "detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings."
JUST IN: Text of the exec order, as posted by the White House, says it's the policy of the administration "to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate..."

Simpson, when asked about the meetings he had with journalists to discuss Steele's findings before the election, cited the First Amendment in refusing to disclose to Senate investigators with whom he spoke.
Glenn Simpson says Steele "stopped dealing" with the FBI by late fall 2016 because "there was a concern that the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people."
"To me, this was like, you know, you're driving to work and you see something happen and you call 911, right?" Simpson told Senate investigators.
Glenn Simpson, who hired Christopher Steele, told the Senate Judiciary Cmte that Steele felt "professionally obligated" to give his dossier to the FBI in the summer of 2016.

"Oh yeah, I think the summit's gonna happen," Trump tells @MajorCBS.
"The good news is, everybody wants us" to have the US-NK summit in their country, Trump says, adding it has the potential to be a "big event."
Trump says having talks with Kim at the DMZ is an "intriguing" idea.		"I like it because you're there. You're actually there," he tells reporters.
Trump says his reported "sh*thole countries" remark from earlier this year did not come up in his conversation with the Nigerian president.

Trump says he has a "responsibility" as president of the United States to reach deal with NK.		"If I can't do it ... it'll be a very tough time for a lot of countries and a lot of people," he says.
Trump is over hearing how to deal with NK from people who've "failed so badly" in the past.		"I get a big, big kick out of that," he says.

SESSIONS ON USING WIKILEAKS MATERIAL IN TRUMP CAMPAIGN STMNTS:		"I would be silly not to use it," AG Sessions told the House Intel panel in Nov 2017, noting the emails were in in the "public domain."		"So I used it, although I could understand somebody	else not wanting to."
WHAT HAPPENED IN MOSCOW?		Trump's former head of security is quoted in House Intel report as saying in 2013, someone "mentioned sending women to [Trump's] room." 		He says he replied, "Absolutely not, we don't do that."
Trump associates "had numerous	ill-advised contacts with Wikileaks," House Intel report alleges, adding there's "no evidence" they were "involved in the theft or publication" of stolen Dem emails.
MORE: "The Committee found no evidence that President Trump's pre-campaign business dealings formed the basis for collusion."
House Intel report says "none of the interviewed witnesses" offered evidence of "collusion, coordination, or conspiracy" between Trump campaign and Russia.
House Intel Cmte report says Steele dossier "formed an essential part" of the FISA application for surveillance on Carter Page.
Report also says Clinton/DNC used "a series of cutouts and intermediaries to obscure their roles" in procuring the Steele dossier.
As examples, House Intel report points to DJT, Jr's meeting with a Russian lawyer and calls the campaign's praise for Wikileaks "highly objectionable and inconsistent with U.S. national security interests."
Without finding evidence of collusion with Russia, House Intelligence panel report points to "poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns."

The list of unproven allegations being circulated by Senate Democrats also includes this:		-- "On at least one occasion, Dr. Jackson could not be reached when needed because he was passed out drunk in his hotel room."
Among the more explosive, still unproven, allegations: 		-- Jackson is prone to "screaming tantrums," and is described by one colleague as "the worst officer I have ever served with."	-- At a Secret Service going away party, "Jackson got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle."
In compiling the list, Senate Democrats say they have conducted more than 20 interviews with current and former colleagues of Jackson's.		The allegations, to date, are still unproven.
NEW: A summary of the allegations compiled by Democrats against Ronnie Jackson includes explosive new details and damning quotes from colleagues.

On the day in December 2016 that Kanye West appeared for pictures at Trump Tower with then-President-Elect Trump, I wrote the following as a tag line of a report on the meeting:		"Neither would say whether the pop star is being considered for any official post."
"We've been friends for a long time," said the then-president-elect.		West stood stoically, with his arms folded, as cameras clicked. https://t.co/Cqo6vMKfoe
In re: @KanyeWest ... 		West met with Trump in NYC during the transition, on Dec. 13, 2016.		"We discussed life," Trump told reporters after their meeting.... which took place hours after Trump announced Rex Tillerson would be SecState.
Key point - as argument neared conclusion, Kennedy pressed the lawyer for the opponents HARD on the idea Trump doesn't have it in his power to implement a #travelban.		"You want the president to say, 'I'm convinced that in six months we're going to have a safe world," he said.
Chief Justice John Roberts asked the lawyer for #travelban opponents if there is ever a "statute of limitations" on campaign statements.		Neal Katyal said Trump could reverse the legal issue by disavowing his past statements about Muslims, then re-issuing the order.
Justice Alito is the #travelban's strongest defender on the high court.		"It does not look at all like a Muslim ban," Alito said, noting most majority-Muslim countries aren't on the list.
Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared sympathetic to both sides' arguments, at one point suggesting an elected official's "hateful statements" aren't irrelevant... while later saying 180 day review period in the #travelban means it's not perpetual.
The justices appear split along traditional ideological lines, with conservatives defending Trump's #travelban order from the bench.		Liberal Justice Kagan questioned whether a hypothetical president who espoused anti-Semitic rhetoric could justify a ban on visitors from Israel.
Just got out of oral arguments in the #travelban case. 		Trump's campaign trail comments were a key focus of the back-and-forth.
Our preview of SCOTUS arguments in the #travelban case leads the CBS World News Roundup ‚Äî https://t.co/GaLTaIuN01

That wasn't an out.		That was a polite shove.
Trump now says he doesn't think Jackson should continue as the VA secretary nominee... 		"I wouldn't do it," Trump said.
"I don't want to put a man through a process like this," Trump says of Ronnie Jackson.  "It's too ugly."  		"So we'll see what happens. He'll make a decision."
WILL JACKSON WITHDRAW? 		"It's totally his decision," Trump says.
There will be a lot of different ways to interpret this Trump quote: 		"I told Adm. Jackson just a little while ago, 'What do you need this for?'"
DECAYED FOUNDATIONS:		Trump says he blames Congress and "a lot of people" for the Iran nuclear deal, which he describes as a "bad structure," one that's "falling down."
AFP reporter notes Macron did tell @FoxNewsSunday there was no "Plan B" on the Iran deal.
"It means they get rid of their nukes," @realDonaldTrump says, defining "denuclearization."
"We ... wish from now on to work on a new deal with Iran," said the French president. https://t.co/FKNkMmTDTZ

Based on the pool notes of his Cabinet Room meeting with military advisers, Trump had much more to say just now about the FBI's Cohen raids than he did on Syria...
BREAKING: "It will be met with force," Trump says of Syrian chemical strike, per pooler @CeciliaVega.

JUST IN: Pooler @CeciliaVega reports in Cabinet Room next to military leaders, Trump called Michael Cohen a "good man," refered to FBI raids as a "disgraceful situation."

Hard to know, Tanja... but we're looking for the basis of what he said just "came out" yesterday. 		Here's what he said in WV today: 		"Yesterday, it came out where, this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen before." https://t.co/nd5uoNQKLd
Migrant rape at the hands of coyotes was a topic briefly mentioned on "Hannity" on Monday night.		"They're raping them," Sheriff Paul Babeau told guest host Katie Pavlich. "We‚Äôve had countless cases in my eight years as sheriff where they have been raped multiple times."
Today, @juliannagoldman reports Pruitt's security lead was reassigned not long after he rejected the administrator's request to use lights and sirens on the streets of DC.
That door led to a condo just steps from the Capitol, which Pruitt occupied and leased for $50 per night, owed only on the nights he actually slept there.
Taxpayers had to spend $2,460 to replace the door broken by Pruitt's EPA security team when he was sick and didn't answer his phone.
Recapping what we've learned -- 		Scott Pruitt's EPA security team insisted he sit in first class (and not, say, the bulkhead of coach) because "certain security protocols" required that he "be near the front of the plane."
üö® https://t.co/phMwTOhyRe
EPA tells @juliannagoldman it has "no knowledge" of Pruitt's security lead being reassigned because he didn't follow Pruitt's orders to blast thru DC traffic with lights and sirens.		https://t.co/B6q6oI3op2

NOT GONNA BE BORING! 		Trump tosses his prepared remarks into the air in White Sulphur Springs, WV. https://t.co/Vl0hys2jnL
Trump just said "millions and millions of people" vote multiple times, insists it's "not a conspiracy theory."
"We're trying to hire thousands of judges. No other country in the world does that. We hire judges," Trump says.		"They can do whatever they want," Trump says of immigration laws in Mexico. "Which is the way it should be, to be honest."
"You have to go after the people that aren't treating you right," Trump says in WV, explaining his tariffs on China.

@jonmchenry Yes, according to this summary of Nielsen data from last year. 		2/3rds of radio listening occurs OUTSIDE the home, which means significant listening happens inside. 		https://t.co/GSNrkLtiCe		Also consider exposure in cabs, offices, school buses, etc.
MILLENIALS TUNE IN:		92% of adults 18-34 listen to radio each week, Nielsen says in its "Audio Today 2018" report.  		Each month, 72.5 million of them tune in to over-the-air AM/FM stations.
NEW NIELSEN NUMBERS:		228.5 million US adults listen to radio		216.5 million watch TV		203.8 million use smartphones		68.5 million stream audio		35.7 million tune in satellite radio		21.9 million listen to podcasts
STILL NUMBER ONE:		Nielsen announced today that AM/FM remains the nation's #1 reach medium, with 93% of Americans tuning to US radio stations each week.
If there‚Äôs one guy who knows a thing or two about ‚Äúmarket value‚Äù and rents, it‚Äôs @realDonaldTrump. 		Yesterday, his spokeswoman said he is ‚Äúnot‚Äù okay with the $50/night deal Pruitt struck.
‚ÄúMARKET VALUE‚Äù? 		Overnight, @CBSNews obtained an EPA ethics review of Pruitt‚Äôs rent deal. 		Officials ran an Airbnb search that filtered out rooms costing +$55/night. 		Rooms near the condo Pruitt rented typically go for much more... https://t.co/jeAwRE3rAX

The president is reportedly a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù but not a ‚Äútarget‚Äù of the Mueller investigation. 		We explain the difference on the CBS World News Roundup. https://t.co/MqgvWuh6Lc
The top of my World News Roundup piece this morning on Mueller probe-latest seemed eerily evocative of this -- 		"NARRATOR: In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups..."
JUST IN: @PressSec says Trump‚Äôs strategy to secure the border ‚Äúincludes the mobilization of the National Guard.‚Äù 		(His two most recent predecessors, Bush and Obama, also did this.)
.@PressSec says Trump "has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing situation in San Bruno, CA."
In 2010, the national guard deployment was described as "a force multiplier for the U.S. Border Patrol by spotting border intrusions and providing technical support." https://t.co/7KfukbEBNa
In "Operation Jump Start," George W. Bush sent 6,000 national guard troops to the border in 2006.		In "Operation Phalanx," Barack Obama sent 1,200 national guard troops to the border in 2010.
From the Pentagon, @CBSDavidMartin reports officials are readying a statement indicating the top brass is preparing options for the use of the military to help secure the border.
Seeing a ton of tweets today on posse comitatus -- 		The prohibition in the 1878 statute (as amended) is on the use of the Army or Air Force to arrest, "or otherwise to execute the laws," unless it is "expressly authorized" by Congress.
Obama also sent the national guard to the border in 2010. https://t.co/x6jpjRmST8
GW Bush sent national guard troops to the border in 2006. 		Texas Gov. Rick Perry dispatched his state's forces to the border in 2014. https://t.co/DGxG09IZ7j
Until we get clarification, it's hard to compare what Trump just announced ("We're going to be guarding our border with the military") -- with past national guard deployments to the border.
WH says Trump will call on ONE US reporter at the upcoming news conference with Baltic leaders.		He has likely made a lot more news by speaking on a wide variety of topics in today's Cabinet Room spray.
Trump just used "Crooked Hillary" phrasing in the Cabinet Room, referring to his "tougher" stance on Russia.
JUST IN: Trump says he'll confer with Sec Def Mattis -- that until wall is built, the "military" will guard the border.
"Two of the most incredible days of my life were spent in China," Trump tells reporters. But, he says, "We have to do something to seriously relieve that trade deficit."

Taxpayers were billed $2,460 last year to replace broken door at Capitol Hill condo where Pruitt‚Äôs security busted in when he didn‚Äôt answer calls. @ArdenFarhi reports the EPA admin had gone home sick and had taken a nap.
While the EPA administrator holds cabinet-level rank, he is not in the line of succession. 		Whatever his security needs may be, they don't touch on continuity of government. 		That makes them harder to justify.

The extraordinary thing we learned today:		The White House acknowledged the president's lawyers have gone to arbitration to enforce a contract that would keep a porn star quiet.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no hearing, there‚Äôs no due process, there‚Äôs no determination on the merits,‚Äù Avenatti told CBS News.  ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt even invited to the party.‚Äù
Avenatti says Cohen had the arbitrator issue the order without giving Daniels or her lawyer any opportunity to argue their side.
Avenatti insists Trump‚Äôs lawyers didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù anything.  He says Michael Cohen‚Äôs LLC, ‚ÄúEssential Consultants,‚Äù got an arbitrator with California-based ADR Services to issue a temporary restraining order against Daniels last week.
‚ÄúFor the White House spokesperson to stand up and claim that Trump won the case in arbitration is ludicrous.  I‚Äôm dumbfounded,‚Äù Avenatti said.
I just got off the phone with Michael Avenatti, the attorney representing Stormy Daniels. He says the WH‚Äôs claim that an arbitration case was ‚Äúwon in the president‚Äôs favor‚Äù is ‚Äúcompletely false‚Äù and ‚Äúbogus.‚Äù
A CLUE: In the purported "hush agreement" signed by Stephanie Clifford, there is a clause allowing an arbitrator to award "DD" -- purportedly Trump -- one million dollars for "each breach" of the confidentiality agreement.

Nunberg just called Trump an "idiot" for his Lester Holt interview and then having the Russian diplomats in the Oval.
"I am not a fan of Donald Trump. He treated me like crap," Nunberg tells @jaketapper.
"Gloria, we were a joke. Everyone was laughing at us," Nunberg says on CNN. "The idea that we were colluding with the Russians? Give me a break."

It's important to remember what's not referenced in this indictment:		-- Anything about the DNC hack.	-- Anything about Wikileaks posting Podesta's emails.	-- Anything about George Papadopolous/Carter Page/et al.	-- Anything about the Trump Tower meeting.
MORE from Trump in statement: "It‚Äôs time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia..."

Florida's governor says Trump-appointed FBI director should resign over mishandled Cruz tip.		"Acknowledging a mistake isn‚Äôt going to cut it," says Gov. Scott. "An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life."
JUST IN: House Speaker Paul Ryan says indictments indicate "a sinister and systematic attack on our political system," calls it "subterfuge."
Indictment alleges Russians emailed their news release for a July 2016 anti-Clinton rally outside Trump Tower to "over thirty media outlets."
One Russian operative is quoted in the indictment writing a relative, "I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people."
AFTER Trump's election, indictment alleges Russians ALSO organized anti-Trump rallies in New York and North Carolina.
At one Florida rally, indictment alleges Russians paid an American to "build a cage on a flatbed truck and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform."
Indictment alleges Russians organized a series of coordinated "Florida Goes Trump" rallies in FL in August 2016.
Indictment alleges Russians organized "March for Trump" and "Down with Hillary" rallies in NYC in June and July 2016.
Indictment alleges that in addition to Trump, Russian social media efforts also promoted Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. All in an effort to defeat Clinton.
Indictment says the Russians "used false U.S. personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach."
The indictment alleges Russian operatives promoted hashtags including #Trump2016, #TrumpTrain, #MAGA, #IWontProtectHillary and #Hillary4Prison.
The indictment depicts a round-the-clock Russian social media marketing effort, in which operatives were assigned shifts to align with US time zones.
Among the allegations -- Russians stole real Americans' Social Security numbers and dates of birth to open PayPal accounts, get fake driver's licenses and BUY SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING.
The 37-page indictment is remarkably detailed, offering new insights into an alleged Russian conspiracy to infiltrate American society and US-based social media platforms.
JUST IN: Senate rejects WH-backed Grassley immigration proposal, 39-60.		(Well, 60 senators could agree on at least one thing today!)

So here's what COULD happen.  		Paul COULD continue to talk until midnight.  		McConnell could seek recognition, begin a new legislative day, and hold the -*cloture* vote at 1am.

Only three members of the House have this "magic minute" privilege --		Speaker Ryan (R)	Majority Leader McCarthy (R)	Minority Leader Pelosi (D)
Pelosi has been speaking now for six hours. There is no readily-accessible historical record of anyone speaking in the House longer than Pelosi has today.
One of this town's true experts on Congress, @jamiedupree, has found a reference in Hinds Precedents to a House speech in 1820 that ran for "more than four hours." 		But Pelosi's speech COULD be longest, ever.
Pelosi's "magic minute" is going on nearly four hours ...
Pelosi's "magic minute" has nearly run 180 minutes ... 		Started at 10:04amET.  Still going, almost three hours later ...

Irony alert. The newly-released Strzok-Page text messages have the two discussing the FBI's text-capturing capability... 		In Aug 2016, Strzok told Page he's "not convinced" it "really deters anything."
Pelosi has now held the House floor for an hour. As minority leader, she can speak without a time limit. This is a rare exercise of that privilege.
Another PSA -- House Democrats don't have the power to block a budget deal on their own.  But their votes could be needed, if enough conservatives ALSO oppose one.

Pelosi took the floor at 10:04amET. She's been holding it since, under what congressional types call a "magic minute."		It's her privilege as minority leader -- the only Dem who has it.

"But Barbara, we are not getting support for the Democrats. You can say what you want, but..." Trump says in response to Rep. Comstock (R-VA).
WOW - Rep. Comstock (R-VA) rebuts Trump to his face... 		"We don't need a government shutdown over this," she says.
"If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety ... then shut it down," Trump says. "We'll go with another shutdown."
JUST IN: Trump says "I'd love to see a shutdown," if immigration reforms aren't passed.
House unanimously passes reforms to Capitol Hill's sexual harassment policies. 		"My hope is that this legislation will help make hostile workplaces in Congress a relic of the past," Speaker Ryan says in statement.
"Should Bannon maintain his refusal to return and testify fully to all questions, the Committee should begin contempt proceedings," Schiff says in statement.
Schiff says Steve Bannon's lawyer has informed House Intel that he won't answer questions "beyond a set of fourteen yes-or-no questions the White House had pre-approved."

@MarkSZaidEsq Final note - the Constitution makes just one reference to classified material, and it's a power given to the legislative, not executive, branch. One could read Art 1, Sec 5, Clause 3 and argue each house has the inherent power to make what it keeps secret .. public.
@MarkSZaidEsq A single member? No. Even if they read classified material into the record, they'd be subject to censure, even removal under House/Sen rules. But that's not what we're talking about here...
@MarkSZaidEsq Perhaps ... But (and forgive me for reading into this) your view presupposes that the people's representatives, who created and could abolish those agencies, have no authority in this area whatsoever. The Framers might have had an issue with that.
A May 2017 CRS report indicates the process the House Intel committee may use to #ReleasetheMemo has never been employed before. 		(See pg 3:)		https://t.co/Q7ljYHh5g3
@MomsThoughts @MarkSZaidEsq @DevinNunes "Transmit" is my phrasing. The rule is more broad. "The select committee may disclose publicly any information in its possession," subject to the process spelled out in the rule.
@MarkSZaidEsq @DevinNunes Bear in mind separation of powers. The way the House Rules are written, once material is transmitted to the House, it can do what it wishes with that material - as a body. Clause 11 of Rule X sees the House as the final arbiter of the public's right to know.
But the Rules of the House make it clear that the committee can decide to release "any information in its possession," and act as an arbiter of what the public should see, subject to the process outlined above.
He must do so "personally in writing."		Part (g)(2)(C) gives the committee the power to ask the full House to overrule the president's objections and #ReleasetheMemo anyway.
If the House Intelligence Committee does vote to #ReleaseTheMemo, House Rule X, Clause 11, Part (g)(2)(B) gives the president five days to object.
