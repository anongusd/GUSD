.@140townhall I will not rest until Obamacare is repealed.  You can take it to the bank.
.@140townhall Repeal Obamacare. It's estimated to cost 800,000 jobs, is a small biz killer, and unconstitutional.
.@140townhall Govt overregulation is the single biggest #jobs killer. The 3 biggest offenders are the EPA, #Obamacare, & Frank-Dodd.
.@140townhall 4 small biz: repeal the death tax, increase access to capital by repealing Frank-Dodd, & repeal #Obamacare to reduce HC costs.
.@140townhall Yes 3 priorities. Attract #jobs by cutting job creator #taxes. Keep $ in pvt sector by reducing govt #spend. Simplify tax code
.@140townhall No. There is no vital US interest in #Libya. Worse, we might be aiding terrorist groups by supporting the Libyan opposition.
.@140townhall We must reserve #military force for situations where we've been attacked, are threatened, or have vital interests at stake.
.@140townhall Our security requires a strong defense and wise leadership. I will preserve our #military strength while using it judiciously.
.@140townhall I support DOD efficiency but defense spending did not cause our budget crisis & we must maintain our military strength.
.@140townhall #Obamacare, the largest entitlement and spending program in our country's history
.@140townhall Lesson of '82 and '90 is promised #spending cuts never last while higher taxes persist.  No more biz as usual.  No debt hike.
.@140townhall As then Sen. Obama said in '06, raising #debtceiling is a failure of leadership. Need real spending reform not empty promises.
.@140townhall Only way to avoid future increases is fund. change the way we spend. We must #cutcapbalance and repeal Obamacare.
.@140townhall Obama failed. With ur help we can return the people's voice to the WH, restore fiscal sanity, & make Obama a 1 term president.
.@140townhall Fundamental change in how we spend #taxpayer $, & return to constitutional principles of ltd govt and personal responsibility
.@140townhall TY for this forum.  I'm running 4 POTUS 2 bring the voice of the people back to DC.  That voice requires fundamental changes.
