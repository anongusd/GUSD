I am humbled by the number of you who have reached out to me. However, at this time, I am enjoying spending time with my family and preparing for the next chapter of my career. I look forward to helping elect the GOP candidate chosen by the conferees.(2/2)
Congratulations to my good friend and colleague Tom Marino for his honorable and meaningful service in Congress. For the past several days, I have received many calls and emails from supporters, former colleagues, and GOP leaders urging me to consider running for Tom’s seat.(1/2)
From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! https://t.co/T4vwRgToVQ

Here's how PA Senators stack up vs @Bob_Casey:		Sen. Toomey, in office 4 fewer years than @Bob_Casey, has passed 50% more laws.	Sen. Santorum passed 3x more laws than @Bob_Casey.	Sen. Heinz passed 6.5x more laws than @Bob_Casey.	Sen. Specter passed 7.5x more laws than @Bob_Casey.
When pressed by the @KDKA debate moderators to name a policy he supported to grow the economy, @Bob_Casey failed to give even ONE example. #PASenDebate
Pretty amazing to hear @Bob_Casey bragging about 1.8 percent growth under the Obama Administration. Senator Casey has been in Washington too long to understand how to get the economy going. It's time to send him home. #Lou4Senate
I'd like Senator @Bob_Casey to tell us what policy he supported that got this economy going? Was it Obamacare? Higher taxes? Regulations? #PASenDebate
The best way to raise wages is to grow the economy, which is exactly what we're doing now. There are actually more jobs today than people unemployed. Let's keep it going. #PASenDebate

Another great Day of Action event in West Chester! Thank you to all of the activists and volunteers who care about the progress we are making! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/LYLikbuUiC
Great Day of Action event this morning in Reading! Thank you to all the activists and volunteers who came out to help us spread the word about the awesome Republican candidates on the ballot! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/3mdkpgbOoO
Today, we launched a newspaper ad campaign featuring Marine Corps Veteran Brandon Rumbaugh and  highlighting our commitment to veterans, the national anthem, and the flag. Where does @Bob_Casey stand? #Lou4Senate https://t.co/bcnmOpqamP
Great lunch with veterans and police officers in Greensburg, Westmoreland County. Thank you all for your service! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/TtQRmb8qxX
Great tour this morning of Dura-Bond Industries in Westmoreland County. Dura-Bond supplies steel pipe and protective pipe coatings for natural gas production. Our economic policies are helping them to continue to provide good paying jobs for Pennsylvania workers. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/a0Pi5GnJ8E
This morning I stopped at White Valley Volunteer Fire Department in Westmoreland County. Over 96% of Pennsylvania firefighters are volunteers and, as a former Mayor, I know the sacrifices they make every day. Thank you for your service. https://t.co/GO7pHvbEIh
Today is a day to unite together as Americans and remember those who lost their lives in the tragic terror attacks that changed our nation forever. May we never forget. https://t.co/RqMsTTRqFa
It is an honor to have the support of @foplodge1pgh. 	They will always have my strong support.
Great roundtable with members of the #Pittsburgh Fraternal Order of Police to discuss #SanctuaryCities. It’s insulting that @Bob_Casey thumbs his nose at federal law in defense of dangerous sanctuary city policies. Enough is enough. #Lou4Senate 		https://t.co/Fdhwz2RLfU https://t.co/ygIiXIMq3R
Great roundtable at CNX this afternoon with leaders of PA’s natural gas industry. PA can be a state among nations and become energy independent, but @Bob_Casey is teaming up with radical Hollywood elites to undermine natural gas production and kill good-paying jobs. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/ntw5t3GZRT
As Rosh Hashanah starts at sundown, I want to wish all who are celebrating a happy New Year!
.@Bob_Casey votes with Bernie Sanders 90% of the time. 18 years of Bob Casey’s radical policies? Don’t do it. 		#Lou4Senate https://t.co/NfWCFT1IHr
.@Bob_Casey came out against Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court before the pick was even made! This morning, I spoke with @ChrisStigall about how embarrassing Casey and Senate Democrats have been during Judge Kavanaugh's nomination hearing		https://t.co/XuVNhwGuDb https://t.co/LPX2fmxE7z
We must work to continue this great success from our policies. If @Bob_Casey gets 18 years in the Senate, his policies will make Pennsylvania workers and families poorer. Bob Casey is stuck in a failed past. I'm working for a brighter future. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/feainvWBJ8
Sen. Joe Manchin is right, there's no commonsense or reasoning behind @Bob_Casey’s refusal to fulfill his constitutional duty to advise and consent. How can you oppose a president’s pick for the Supreme Court before the pick is even made? #Lou4Senate		https://t.co/GNYARPwjH4 https://t.co/MdmZb3Z7TL
Even the left-leaning American Bar Association has said that Judge Kavanaugh is ‘well-qualified’ to serve on the Supreme Court. @Bob_Casey is no longer in a position to serve the people of Pennsylvania and to unite our country for the future. #Lou4Senate		https://t.co/tPhBmyp5p7 https://t.co/NPNP5gFEz9
.@Bob_Casey ’s blind obstruction to Judge Kavanaugh is a dereliction of duty to the people of PA. Casey was labeled one of the least effective Senators twice, and now he’s refusing to do basic responsibilities of his job. Enough is enough. #Lou4Senate		https://t.co/4mp0qnGxHn
Democrats in the Senate are now trying to completely stop the hearing on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court! @Bob_Casey even came out against Judge Kavanaugh before he was nominated... and Casey hasn’t even met with him. Casey must go! #KavanaughConfirmation
Today we celebrate the men and women who work so hard to make America great. Happy #LaborDay! https://t.co/0Vn8ERTrCN

Great tour of CHANNELLOCK® in Meadville this morning who produce over 140 types of pliers and hand tools that are American Made. They’ve been a family owned business for over 132 years and have hired 82 employees this year because of the booming economy. Thank you for the tour! https://t.co/WZYz89Vo9Y
Great rally tonight in Erie with over a hundred Pennsylvanians who care deeply about the direction of our country. @Bob_Casey wants to take us back to the old failed policies of the past. We can’t let that happen and I need your support to keep our progress going! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/unjrXJ3NPh
Whirley-DrinkWorks! in Warren designs and manufacturers all sorts of mugs, growlers, and tumblers for the most recognizable names across the globe, including Disney, professional sports teams, and Chili’s.

Main Street Tours of local communities allow for me to put my mayor’s hat back on. Today, Mayor Tom Riel of Bradford showed me one of their new development projects. The people of Pennsylvania need a Senator who has their back and is in touch with their issues. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/OjKT17wPmh
Great tour of @Zippo in Bradford! They employ hundreds of McKean County residents and produce over 40,000 lighters a day. Economic growth will keep these good paying jobs going strong! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/TsFvvAJssY
It was an honor to meet Vietnam veteran, and Purple Heart recipient, Harold Beck in Bradford this morning. Thank you for your service to our great country. https://t.co/aB8azq4TxC

.@Bob_Casey says he's pro-life, but while in Washington he had a 100% record with the abortion group NARAL. Now he has rejected debates in his hometown market of #Scranton. Casey owes Pennsylvanians an explanation. #Lou4Senate 		https://t.co/7NUrRyUggb https://t.co/SyeZbLCFBe

It is an honor to have the support of the men and women from Fraternal Order of Police lodges across Pennsylvania. As a former mayor, I know the risks our police officers take day in &amp; day out to keep us safe. As a Senator, I will always have their backs.		https://t.co/h3EGE14Ful

The tax cuts are winning in Pennsylvania. Because of the tax cuts I voted for and @Bob_Casey obstructed, a married couple will pay nothing in taxes on the first $24,000 of income. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/vAde6cpgZw
The tax cuts that I supported and @Bob_Casey obstructed are generating huge benefits in Pennsylvania. A typical family of four in the Philadelphia area will save nearly $2,500 in their taxes every year! #Lou4Senate https://t.co/yNvOXtnaKZ
Because of the tax cuts that I supported and @Bob_Casey opposed, Pennsylvanians are seeing lower utility bills. Excited to have Vice President @mike_pence join me in Philadelphia today to highlight the great progress we are making here in Pennsylvania! #Lou4Senate

Can you believe it? @Bob_Casey‘s liberal allies in the Senate actually BLOCKED a resolution supporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Bob Casey's far left shift is just wrong for Pennsylvania. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/3M4W1JGLBw
Day in and day out, law enforcement across America serve and protect our families and communities. Tragically, some never make it back home. Their service and sacrifice to keep us safe is why I #BackTheBlue. https://t.co/jWdphf7smC
.@Bob_Casey has moved so far left, he campaigned in PA w/ a far left Senator from California, who fights against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Bob Casey might be the right Senator for California, but he is just wrong for Pennsylvania. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/uluJvYwI88
It's embarrassing for me that Congress finds money to increase our own security, while children and teachers sit in unsecured schools. We are not more important than any child or teacher in America. https://t.co/oP6xt1GKpA

.@Bob_Casey should do his job like the people of Pennsylvania expect and meet with Judge Kavanaugh. 		If he cannot take the time to meet with the nominee for the #SupremeCourt, he does not deserve to hold office in the U.S. Senate. #Lou4Senate 		https://t.co/4Gcwx4X4Vu
How can you condemn a nominee to the Supreme Court before the pick is even announced?		@Bob_Casey decided he will not do his duty to give Judge Brett Kavanaugh a fair review. 		Obstruction is no solution. Pennsylvania deserves better. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/ByvOJoyuEl
.@realDonaldTrump’s nominee Judge Kavanaugh: "A judge must interpret statutes as written, and a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent." 		I fully agree with the Judge. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/6OAhuc5qFH
This process was transparent from the start, with the President releasing a list of potential nominees to be fully vetted by the American people. Judge Kavanaugh is well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and the Senate should move to confirm him without delay. (2/2)
I applaud @realDonaldTrump for nominating Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh is one of the nation’s most respected conservative legal minds and has a strong record of respecting the rule of law, as laid out by the Constitution. (1/2)
.@Bob_Casey now attacks judges he once supported as “hard-right,” because Casey has moved hard-left. What has changed during Bob Casey’s time in office? Bob Casey has changed. #Lou4Senate

Violence against law enforcement, who put their lives on the line every day to protect our families &amp; communities, is unacceptable. @Bob_Casey must immediately condemn violent protests against law enforcement. His silence underscores his lack of leadership https://t.co/q4yiRMdYnF
In 2007, @Bob_Casey said Judge Tom Hardiman, a PA native, had "an outstanding record both academically &amp; professionally." Today, Casey is dismissing @realDonaldTrump's list of potential #SCOTUS picks, including Judge Hardiman, as "hard right." What changed in 12 years? Bob Casey.
Yesterday families across Pa. saw lower utility bills because of #taxcuts		@Bob_Casey voted against the tax cuts that I supported &amp; continues to obstruct all the great progress we have made. Pa. can’t afford @Bob_Casey’s obstruction politics. #Lou4Senate 		https://t.co/62Blbjlp8C
.@Bob_Casey says he’s “pro-life,” but his record says otherwise. @Bob_Casey has stood w/ pro-abortion groups NARAL 100% of the time and Planned Parenthood 75% of the time. @nrlc &amp; @PAProLifeFed endorsed my campaign. It’s clear who is pro-life in this race. https://t.co/ewPLCgOBd5
The new vacancy on the Supreme Court shows how critical 1 vote in the Senate is for the future of our country. @Bob_Casey’s cont’d obstruction proves he has nothing to offer Pennsylvania in the Senate. Obstruction is not a policy that helps PA. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/KApX9AubYQ
“While Congressman Barletta has worked to unite people of all faiths, Senator @Bob_Casey is using these inflammatory tactics to divide us; this is gutter politics at its worst.” #Lou4Senate
.@Bob_Casey’s cont’d outrageous attacks on our campaign prove he has no record to run on. Here’s what prominent members of the Jewish community from across Pa. say about @Bob_Casey’s ugly attacks, compared to my record supporting the nation of Israel and the Jewish community. https://t.co/38zaLPTdOs
One vote in the Senate can shape the Supreme Court and our country for a generation. @Bob_Casey's obstruction and liberal turn could cause lasting damage. As Senator, I will support judicial nominees who will defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law. #Lou4Senate
Justice Anthony Kennedy served the American people honorably during his years in the federal court system. I wish him well in his retirement. The vacancy on the Supreme Court is another example of why the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania is so important. (1/2)
Today #SCOTUS upheld @realDonaldTrump's executive order pausing travel from certain countries identified as hotbeds of terrorism.

The #IranDeal made the world, and our allies like Israel, less safe. I commend @realDonaldTrump for keeping his promise to end it. @Bob_Casey cast a deciding vote for this terrible deal, giving the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism $100B &amp; a pathway to nuclear breakout.
Great profile from @pgPoliTweets of the @PittsburghPG . The primary is just around the corner. Remember to come out to vote next Tuesday, May 15! #Lou4Senate #Vote4Lou https://t.co/exeQi2Pquo
In 2016, Pennsylvania voted for an agenda of lower taxes, less government interference, &amp; a strong America that puts our citizens first. @Bob_Casey has consistently obstructed that agenda. PA needs a Senator who represents our values, not DC. #Lou4Senate https://t.co/R2nq9MVogo

Only when @Bob_Casey Senate assured a vote on DACA did Casey vote to re-open gov't. And I'm sure Casey will again deny funding for Americans on February 8 if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants. @Bob_Casey today proved he put illegal immigrants ahead of Americans.
Senator @Bob_Casey was willing to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. None of the other issues that Senator Casey said he cared about changed, other than the Senate agreed to hold a vote on DACA.
This government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of Americans, and Senator @Bob_Casey just confirmed it.

If @Bob_Casey really gave a damn about the kids, he would not have voted twice in the last two months to shut down the government and deny funding for children's health insurance. I plead with @Bob_Casey to stop hurting Pennsylvanians and vote to re-open the government.(4/4)
Senator @Bob_Casey needs to start telling the truth and stop deceiving people about his record. @Bob_Casey cannot deny the fact that he has chosen to protect 4,900 illegal immigrants in Pennsylvania over 342,000 children who rely on the CHIP program for health insurance. (3/4)
The House passed 5 years full funding for CHIP on Nov. 3. And then the House &amp; Senate passed $2.85 billion for CHIP on Dec. 21. @Bob_Casey voted against it. This week, we passed the longest funding extension for CHIP in history! @Bob_Casey voted against it again.(2/4)
Senator @Bob_Casey should not get away with misleading people and the media about his record. Casey is not telling the truth, and he needs to be called out. These are the facts... (1/4)

RT @realDonaldTrump: For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more…
Sen. @Bob_Casey is responsible for denying funding for Americans. There are 342,000 children in PA who benefit from CHIP &amp; 4,900 DACA recipients. By voting to shut down the gov't, Casey put illegal immigrants over health insurance for our kids. Pennsylvanians should be furious.
Those Senators who vote no on CR will be solely responsible for a gov't shutdown. If @Bob_Casey votes to shut down the government, he will be denying health insurance for more than 342,268 children to protect 4,900 illegal immigrants in PA. Pennsylvanians should be furious. (2/2)
I’m sure @Bob_Casey knows Senate rules require 60 votes to pass spending bills. Republicans only hold 51 seats in the Senate. Republicans passed a CR through House w/out needing Dem votes, but that can’t happen in Senate. Impossible to get to 60 in Senate w/out Dem votes. (1/2)
America should protect life and that responsibility starts with elected officials. @Bob_Casey claims to be pro-life, but he had a 0% voting record for life last year. When it comes to defending the most vulnerable among us, actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/X4yptdutYJ
House just passed government funding bill which includes the longest extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in history. Are Senate Dems &amp; @Bob_Casey really going to vote NO on the bill to shutdown the government &amp; deny funding for children's health insurance?

@POTUS Congress must prove to American workers &amp; families that it is serious about defending our national security &amp; protecting American jobs.
@POTUS We have immigration laws for two main reasons: to defend our national security and protect American jobs.
@POTUS We cant have conversation about those here illegally until we stop illegal immigration. First &amp; foremost, must secure borders &amp; enforce laws
@POTUS Media &amp; politicians focus on illegal immigrant. I stand w/ American worker &amp; legal immigrant whose jobs threatened by illegal immigration.
@POTUS By putting immigration policy back in Congress' hands, @POTUS is making it clear that no president has the authority to make immigration law
On DACA, I agree with @POTUS. President Obama never had authority to make immigration law by executive order. That power lies with Congress.

The dangerous &amp; irresponsible Iran Deal Hillary helped negotiate awards the world's largest state-sponsor of terrorism &amp; makes us less safe.
If Hillary's disastrous tenure and email scandal at Dept. of State taught us anything, it's that we must take seriously cyber security.
If Hillary really wants to keep us safe, she should focus on enforcing our laws and ending sanctuary cities.
Obama-Clinton have pushed our debt to $20 trillion &amp; what do we have to show for it? Bad roads, bridges, airports, crumbling infrastructure.
It's easy to talk about creating jobs, but it's much harder to actually do it. Only 1 presidential candidate has signed the front of checks.

Barletta warns California bill would turn state into a sanctuary - https://t.co/Z5YKVXOi9i via @Shareaholic
Many Trump immigration proposals same as my ideas since coming to Congress. Was proud to share my plans in policy paper I gave to campaign.
@realDonaldTrump laid out a smart, comprehensive plan tonight to enforce our immigration laws, secure our borders &amp; protect American workers
Visa overstay enforcement is crucial. Nearly 50% of those currently in the US illegally came on visas, the visas expired,&amp; they disappeared.
Unlike Obama &amp; Clinton, @realDonaldTrump will allow law enforcement to do their jobs, enforce immigration laws, &amp; keep our communities safe.
Homeland Security &amp; FBI officials have admitted to me they have no way to accurately screen refugees. We don't know who they really are.
Hillary Clinton always talks about immigration in terms of the needs of those here illegally. What about the needs of American workers?
Trump is right: Those who favor the needs of illegal immigrants over law-abiding citizens spend too much time in Washington.
We must end dangerous sanctuary city policies. Repeatedly releasing criminal illegal immigrants makes more violent crime inevitable.
If not for @realDonaldTrump, we would not be having a national conversation about stopping illegal immigration and securing our borders.
