In a sense that's how the entire border-security has played out forever and ever since, but especially today. Trump is going to El Paso to speak past it.
so there's an interesting echo between then and now‚Äîwhat Bowie High students fought against ~1992 was this entrenched idea that the security and rights of people *on* the border mattered less than the sense of security felt by those away from it.
Bowie High students and faculty fought back, filing a lawsuit in federal court over civil rights violations and eventually winning an injunction against the Border Patrol. A new sector chief came in not long after named Silvestre Reyes.
because it's *right* on the border (the border wasn't even permanently fixed until 1964), the Bowie High campus used to be swarming with Border Patrol agents, who would harass the predominantly Hispanic community before/during/after school https://t.co/XHtueuUq68

Texas is a good example of this. In the end, Democrats flipped two seats and came a few hundreds vote short of a third. But they had *eight* other seats in single digits.
I talked about this on the "pod" but one of the things that really stands about was just how big the map was. The Democratic candidate field was deep enough that it was sort of like whack-a-mole. You think you've won GA-07 and then...GA-06 pops up.

Stuff like this is why they rolled out the "Beto couldn't win Republicans" spin *before* the election. (Though it seemed obviously wrong.) When we talked about Clinton doing well in Texas suburbs...she still lost Tarrant County by nine points. https://t.co/su9nHoiYco

Cruz praises Me Too movement (they were both asked). Trump, who has been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women, is coming to Texas next week for a rally with him.
Cruz says, again, "we'd see utter chaos" in impeachment scenario. He describes this chaos: "an end" to rollback of "job-killing regulations."
An extremely Ted Cruz moment. He alludes to Richard Linklater ad‚Äîwhich calls him out for not fighting back after Trump went after his family‚Äîand says it goes after his family.
Cruz asked multiple times by the moderator about his rhetoric on deficit vs. deficit-busting tax bill. On follow-up, moderator tells him the numbers show the bill raises deficit. "No it wouldn't," Cruz says. "That projection is wrong."
if Tatum's finishing at the rim like this all year..

RT @3vanSutton: @timothypmurphy What is this "Florida" you speak of?
I guess a third thing here is that (of the donations above the disclosure threshold) most of Beto's money by far comes from Texas. Bill Nelson, for instance, has an entire Texas of donors he can tap, called Florida.
a couple things to keep in mind on Beto's $$ is 1.) unlike Jon Ossoff, he has to run in *36* congressional districts, and 2.) Greg Abbott had $43 million in a bank account in January. Texas is big and expensive!

It's sort of telling that the people who were actually fighting O'Rourke on eminent domain don't want any part of Cruz and the Club's attacks  https://t.co/kiH0bgV3w0
But Cruz doesn't really care about gentrification in El Paso. He's been there four times in six years, and one of the last times he was there, it was for a meeting with some of the same people who were the driving force behind the downtown project.
The actual eminent domain stuff is complicated. It was never used in the project. In fact, O'Rourke voted for a moratorium on its use. (Then the council extended the moratorium.) He did resist efforts that would have restricted the kinds of properties you could use it on.
O'Rourke tended to dismiss the opposition as a vocal minority, and it was. As he notes, he won the neighborhood when he ran for re-election in a race that was considered a referendum on the redevelopment plan.
O'Rourke was "white savior," per one critic. The fact that we was an Anglo pushing redevelopment for the Barrio, wasn't helped by stuff like this, a focus-group study approved by the city: https://t.co/JfVGdyuGRr
The downtown plan was explosive. Beto and his allies saw the city as "mediocre" and floundering, post-NAFTA. This would change that. But they weren't going to be the people really affected by the plan. https://t.co/kiH0bgV3w0

to some degree this has always been there with Cruz, but the survival instincts have really brushed everything else aside. It's just bunker mode now.
but six years later one of those movements is threatening to transform politics and and the other has atrophied to the point where its leading light is shouting Blue Lives Matter about a home invasion. Of course, one also has power.
Cruz's arrival on the scene that year was treated as sort of an earthquake, whereas O'Rourke was like a freak weather event, a tornado in Westchester, to be acknowledged before moving
they're useful to compare because both Beto and Ted came into national politics at the same time, and were both sort of at the vanguard of ideological disruption within their parties. O'Rourke on the border and drugs, Cruz on then in-vogue constitutionalism.
O'Rourke's comments are the product of a party in the midst of a rhetorical and ideological sharpening, an evolving movement in the grip of self-examination. Cruz shows what happens when an entire political movement grinds to a halt. https://t.co/XZEgjxCrN6

After a long riff on how he set his life straight, he brings up his "privilege...as a white man" that compels him to work so that "no one's mistake defines them for the rest of their lives."
O'Rourke asked point-blank if he tried to flee the scene of his DUI. He says no.
Cruz pivots to tax cuts, says, "yes, I could've chosen to make it about myself...but that would've been not doing the job I was elected to."
Cruz gets asked whether he "lost his dignity" by endorsing the person who trashed his wife and father.
Now we're on guns. "Thoughts and prayers, Sen. Cruz, are just not gonna cut it anymore," O'Rourke says. "I'm sorry that you do not like thoughts and prayers," Cruz says.

we're talking about a seismic historical event, the deadliest disaster in modern American history, just kind of flicked away, and there's no evidence that anyone in actual power cares
the juxtaposition of 9/11 remembrance and deliberate mis-remembrance of Puerto Rico is just kind of staggering. A defining message of the presidency is that some lives matter and some lives don't.
