Instead of asking to see Obama's birth certificate, she should be asking to see birth certificates of Trump's other children. Obama is fine. She better check herself. https://t.co/8wuqBvfwA2
Melania asked to see Obama's birth certificate? What nerve!! She can hardly speak the language, or so she would have us believe. She should be finding out what her husband was grabbing on those women, how much money he paid to porn stars, how many children he really has. https://t.co/8wuqBvfwA2
While John McCain was a POW, Trump was paying doctors to say he had bone spurs, and giving him shots to keep STD's away. His words. Oh yes, and cheating people out of the pay they had earned. Failing to pay off debts. Thats what you AND your friends say about you.
He has the nerve to give himself an A+ for job he has done as president so far.  He really believes. That coming from the mouth of the man who said Pres Obama barely has a high education . He should really be a shame.
Amen for Joe Scarborough. Trump is such a clown. I can't get over an 'elegant' name for a trade agreement. Google is printing 'fake news.' I hope there is a therapist on staff in the WH for Trump and the people he is driving crazy. https://t.co/POVjFhOCK5
He loves making deals like the one he made in N. Korea. We can sleep really good now because he has solved the problem with N. Korea. They are not making anymore bomb material. They love us. What a president. Greatest in history. He gave himself and A+!!

It was really an insult for Melania Trump to 'lecture' the Dems on reaching across the aisle and settle this problem.  This whole thing is pathetic. Don't insult people anymore with sending Melania there to utter 13 words. Lies.  Lies. Are we really to believe that?
@JamesRusso2d3d @liberallisa We don't care about Melania. She could have stayed in Washington. What good did she do. She will and did lie just like Donald Trump. She of all people saying someone should reach across the aisle and 'settle' this. They really do think we are stupid.

You had to know that these children will end up molested, beaten, in hospitals, and even DEAD. Just give it a  minute. Trump will immediately blame it on the Dems. Any and every body but him. And his hands are dripping with the blood of these little children. https://t.co/kRNWy7uEZg

So you think you have seen enough to make you cry? Wait until we start hearing the real stories about what is happening to the children, and how they are really treated. Trump and his entire administration is EVIL. There is nothing, absolutely nothing they will not do.
These children taken away from their parents will be sold like 'slaves.
'Tender Age' children. This is a crime. Every body responsible for this should be jailed for the rest of their lives.
These children taken from their parents is a travesty. The Trump administration has robbed these parents of their children. Most will never see their children. NO. Their is not a moral fiber in Trump's body.
Corey Lewandowski and others like him do not see those people has human. Anybody not white is worthless to people like him. https://t.co/IpVgPKSCaj

Remember, he had all of them, VP Pence and others 'thanking' him for the 'privilege' to work for him. And he is going to try and bypass the election. He just wants to automatically be given a second term as president. We have a DICTATOR for a president.
Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, and to be placed on that mountain with the other 'presidents.'  He wants to be a God. Just watch and see if he doesn't have them 'sitting and standing at attention.
Trump really wants people to sit or stand at 'attention' when he is speaking to them.  He was not joking. He is serious. Putin and Kim jong UN are heroes to Trump. Just watch what he does.
America, we are in a MESS. We have allowed Trump to put us in a mess.
