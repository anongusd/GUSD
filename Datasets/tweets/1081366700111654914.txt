It‚Äôs impossible to be a conservative woman in a required religion class at a small, private, liberal arts college.
The children deserve a life even if their biological parents cannot give it to them. Many people out there are ready to adopt newborns. #ProLife
When people have sex they are saying that they are ready to take on the responsibility of having a child #prolife

@SenSanders It won‚Äôt be a living wage if it is still a minimum wage! This country needs to get rid of the minimum wage to help grow a better economy!
RT @realJacobAirey: Why aren't more Conservatives talking about this? https://t.co/oDMvjIzO5i
@SenSanders By raising minimum wage you also raise the average cost of living. Countries with no minimum wage are a lot better off than countries with minimum wage.
@SenWarren What if you don‚Äôt get a pay check? Isn‚Äôt that only fair??
It is #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay so get out there and thank a police officer because they do so much that you probably don‚Äôt even know about.

@AOC Your proposed plan is like one child having enough money to buy a candy bar and has to give all but 3 squares to the teacher. Socialism does not work and neither do you.

@SenSanders Maybe the senators should not get paid in a shutdown. You did not come up with a plan before the holidays and then you all took a break for far to long. You should have been there between Christmas and New Years getting this straightened out. IT IS NOT JUST TRUMPS FAULT.

@DiamondandSilk When is this country going to start putting America First!
Congress should not get paid until the government is up and running #GovernmentShutdown
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees It‚Äôs not a trump shutdown. It‚Äôs a Congress shutdown. If you did your job we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.
@timkaine Or he is taking a stand for the sovereignty of the US. And a government shut down gives us the chance to take stock of the bloat of this gigantic bureaucracy.

I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that all of these politicians are acting like they won an academy award for getting elected... no. This is your job, and you are currently getting paid even though you aren‚Äôt doing your job... get the government running and then go make yourself friends
