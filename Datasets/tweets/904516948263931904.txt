I baked today using almond flour. Trying out some new recipes for my patients. Zucchini bread and chocolate chip cookies. Zuk bread was yummy. The cookies are cooling. They look good 👏
@deapoirierbooks Isn’t that attractive though? The bloody part?
@Fieldsandcows Super Friends
@deapoirierbooks Yes!
@JaneCaseyAuthor It’s unconscionable. I had a patient who told me sadly that her daughter (also my patient) would be so much prettier if she would just lose 20 lbs. I was shocked into no speech. I said something. I couldn’t just say nothing. It was horrible.

Hi all YA writers and anyone who’d like to read a fabulously done book The Universe Versus Alex Woods by @GavinExtence. It is a beautiful and unlikely story about love, relationships and human “ness” I cried and laughed it was a great ride! #writingcommmunity #booklovers
@Asher_Wolf My best thing was a book I read by @GavinExtence It was beautiful and made me cry with its portrayal of love and relationship. Lovely!
@vanessalemen @everydayorig OMgoodness beautiful!
@Archanejil Yes confuse them!
@GavinExtence Yes and I had to go to work. BTW I found your book at my local library.
@GavinExtence There was an excerpt of that book at the end of my Alex Woods book. I thought it was yours and I thought it looked good as well. I’ll read your other books and review Alex for you if you’d like just tell me where.
@GavinExtence How I wonder did it not do well here? It’s a beautiful story! And you wrote a story about a Melody.! What about the First Fifteen Lives of Henry August?
@GavinExtence You are welcome! What a beautiful story. You made my month/year with it. What other lovely books have you written?
@GavinExtence I just finished reading The Universe Versus Alex Woods and found you in the twitterverse to tell you how deeply this book touched me. It is amazing on so many levels and I cried for the love and the depth of the human spirit to experience life and death and so much more Beautiful

I think that mirror is what I will bring forward with me into the future. I will strive to be what Grandma saw in me. In achieving that, I will have made her proud and in this way she will always be with me. All my love grandma. I love you for always.
to a Life well lived, true love exhibited for all to see in a life that embodied a simple faith and a belief in the best in all of us because that’s what she always saw in me. And that is what she always saw in all of us.
There isn’t anything much better in life than a grandma’s prayers for you. 		I’ll miss those the most.  		So to my Grandma, I lift a glass of dry red wine (not too sweet) to toast to you;
She was very unassuming and very hardworking. I think I get my worrying from her. She would worry a lot but mostly about other people her loved ones and family who were having hard times and she would pray for us.
you have been lucky. And that’s what she thought. And so am I, a very lucky girl for having the privilege to have been her granddaughter. 		She has left all of us I think a bit of her luck, to carry on her memory and her legacy.
She told me just a couple weeks ago when we were talking that she considered herself lucky. She said, I have been lucky in this life haven’t I? I have had good health and I’ve been lucky don’t you think? I said grandma any luck you’ve had you’ve made yourself, but yes
would ever come. 		 She lived by herself till she was 94 and her driver’s license is still active until her birthday this December! She outlived two husbands and was independent for almost a century. That’s pretty amazing!
I was always happy to be near my gramma. It’s a love that isn’t bound by distance or space. It was always hard for me to realize that Grandma was growing old. I tried not to think about it.  She always seemed so young and vibrant and maybe I just refused to believe this
camper when I was a little girl to laying out in the sun in her back yard in the paradise that I thought was Florida when she and my grandpa moved here so many years ago.
sometimes despite all reasons not to. And she taught me. And If I can be half of that when I grow up I will be happy and she will be proud. 		How do you say goodbye to the gramma that was always there in your life. From the summers of camping with her and grandpa in their
Gramma was patient and forgiving sometimes it seemed to me, too much especially to people and in situations that I found intolerable. In those times she would tell me it was important to be patient and to forgive and she just did. And she loved no matter what,
She won’t pick up the phone when I call for a chat or just to hear her say she loves me.  She’s not at her little house waiting for me to have a visit and for us to talk late into the night and then share a cup of coffee in the morning
I saw her off from this Life and it was my greatest honor to do so. 		But I can’t go sit at her house now and have a cup of tea or glass of wine. She isn’t there to make me Mac and cheese and corn bread like she did when I would come home from college.
So many happy memories. We were very close and I feel like I’ve lost a special piece of love that is somehow just around the corner but I can’t quite reach it. 		I think that’s the hardest thing for me. I can’t go to her. I can’t find her.
nonsense. You would have to get up pretty early to get something over on my gramma. She loved deeply and strongly and taught me what love is. 		I had my gramma for almost 50 years. That’s a long time to know true unconditional love and I am extremely grateful.
We have my Grandma the best send off we could today. My gramma used to say The Lord helps those who help themselves. She had a framed piece of art hanging in her kitchen that had sayings from Thomas Jefferson that she lived her life by. She was practical and smart and no https://t.co/IvL184rMVv
