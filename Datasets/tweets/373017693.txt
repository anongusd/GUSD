@KennyCoble Yeah. That was interesting.
#TacCouncil is out of Executive Session and chooses... ...to postpone making a decision until 3/20.?. Guess they couldn‚Äôt come to a consensus quickly.
@KennyCoble Actually would seem odd to not be there if invested in the process
So...#TacCouncil has started the mtg but is back in executive session. The first item on the regular agenda is Resolution 39948 appointing someone to fill the District 2 position in CM Thoms‚Äô absence. Legislation here: https://t.co/b9uyNhm8Xx
New Hot Deal: Complimentary hearing test - Hear USA - Tacoma https://t.co/qdAvKBVc0m
Welcome New Member: Fortiphi LLC https://t.co/VTRSHrM2fv
Dan Voelpel was highlighted by several people in the audience as having the best interview in post meeting conversation. Nobody else mentioned. As a govt communication professional w time at TNT his knowledge of community issues really came through.
#TacCouncil wraps up interviews. Heading to executive session to discuss qualifications.
CM Thoms: Safety around school? DV: City and schools are working closely. Flashers are having a positive impact.
CM Beale: Public Safety? DV: wish I had a magic wand. We need to work on trusting public officials and building a larger force.
CM Ushka: Affordable Housing? DV: Been looking at issue for year from TNT, City &amp; kids/schools. Cities are doing innovative things like providing workforce housing. Need to evaluate success of current measures.
[Voepel is 3rd candidate who as worked at City, but no longer does]
For more on #wa2wa: https://t.co/q8QSvdOSgf
#TacCouncil goes to final candidate Dan Voelpel. Started w City in NETac in 90‚Äôs. Served 6 mayors and multiple school board members develop and communicate their policies. @Tacoma_Chamber shout out for #wa2wa Used to deadlines from work at TNT
CM Beale: Crime issues? RS: Not an expert on TPD (or on TFD anymore he notes w current Chief in room).  Need to use good data and get great candidates.
[RS has a cold. No fun being on television interviewing while sick]
CM Ibsen: How can whole community benefit from contracting opportunities? RS: Biz need to be aware of the opportunities. Need to level the playing field.
CM Hunter: Homeless? RS: Need more ideas. Worked on tiny home project which he could use.
Buzzered while talking about water quality, equity, education, and more on a bullet list. Finishing w safe routes to schools [4th time it‚Äôs been mentioned by a candidate?]
#TacCouncil Next up Ron Stephens. Highlights 35yrs in Tacoma Fire. Knows the city well. [odd comment about Thoms getting majority of votes]. Mentions need for better buffer between NE Tac &amp; Port. Links Homeless &amp; lack of affordable housing
CM McCarthy: Opportunities to partner w schools including public infrastructure? SR: Used to review school plans for Kent. Need to find safe ways to get to and from.
CM Hunter: Homeless? SR: Many Homeless are temporary. Says need alternative to criminalizing camping. Need more permanent fixes. Points to Seattle selling land to raise money for Homeless. Shouldn‚Äôt jail ppl who are homeless
CM Ibsen: Tideflats subarea? SR: Issues are environmental and buffering between industrial and housing. Not enough land, and need to find new ways. Need to implement environmental monitoring. Every day I drive by and smell the plant.
She has a list of ideas and organizations she‚Äôs going through. [gets award for most actionable ideas in 3min intro]
Next is Sarah Rumbaugh. NE Tacoma sml business owner. Serves on a number of boards. Expand sml biz, balance Econ &amp; Env. Streamlined permitting needed. Environmental restoration efforts are important.
Mentions Coffee Oasis. Lots of TNT shout outs: https://t.co/JcC3tXM4jO
CM Ushka: Sml biz &amp; Econ Dev. JM: must have energy &amp; drive. Need jobs w living wage
CM McCarthy: Homeless? JM: need to define who is. Prioritize families to break the cycle. Assessments towards right need match. [she might use full time here]
[she‚Äôs using her soothing voice on us. Feel like a nap.] [not boring, just soothing]
Next up Janey Mattson. Juvenile parole officer to social worker supervisor for kids to pvt practice counselor. Aims to help ppl in need.
CM Thoms: [using Ma‚Äôam] Key NE issues? AL: Port, 509 traffic, access to waterfront
CM Mello: Describe your advocacy AL: I‚Äôm not an activist. I‚Äôm not trying to stop the LNG project. I‚Äôm not a plant from an environmental group. I‚Äôm a professional
CM Hunter: Homeless? AL: I‚Äôm compassionate. Need to solve opioid crisis. Homelessness is not a crime
Volunteers to volunteer since her prior employer is paying her throughout 2018[? interesting]
#TacCouncil Ann Locsin is next. People of District 2 are only priority. ‚ÄúKeenly aware of promises Thoms has made to my community.‚Äù Volunteers on NE neighborhood council. Says won‚Äôt try to change the world in 6mos.
CM McCarthy: How can we make Tacoma more friendly to business? RH: it is relatively friendly, that‚Äôs why My biz is here. It is not about attracting some unicorn as we see they can leave and take those jobs with them. Look for the smaller wins.
CM Ibsen: Homeless? RH: Will take years but jobs &amp; housing are necessary
CM Mello: Excited about @SoundersFC2 ? RH: Very. CM Mello: Understand NE Tacoma? RH: Great excersise for me to reach across the table
Russ Heaton is up next. (Notes his nervousness walking down the aisle.) Highlights Business owner experience, #TacCouncil fiscal task force, minimum wage task force. Go Sounders finish
[AJG is probably the fastest answerer yet. Is it the CFO take?]
CM Hunter: Homelessness? AJC: Mental health funding is key. Sees it by the Tacoma Dome everyday.
CM Ushka: Balance growth with displacement/gentrification? AJG: Intentional balance to avoid displacement.
Qs: CM McCarthy: What should we look for in Econ Dev Director? AJG: We want to attract jobs from north of here. That provides revenue for city services.
Next up AJ Gordon: Need continuity of Thoms vision. Background of finance and tech. CFO of Tacoma based tech firm for 9yrs. 160k ppl leave Pierce everyday looking for work.
CM McCarthy: Ideas for transitioning away from fossil fuels in transportation sector? JC: Renewables are not scalable, but its imperative we find new ways
CM Ibsen: Economic Development ideas? JC: Growing tech sector like Union Club and @Startup253
CM Blocker: Addressing homelessness &amp; affordability? JC: more accessory dwelling units and infill housing options. Need lots of solutions, not just one.
Qs CM Mello: you mentioned commuting to King County, how would you have time? JC: I can adjust schedule to make it work.
#TacCouncil Justin Camarata is up next for his 3mins. Housing affordability, safe routes to schools, basic city services are at top of list. Subarea plan [for port/industrial lands] should build on green industry.
Bonus Q: CM Beale: Top 3 priorities? Busick: Homeless, Safety &amp; Infrastructure - they go beyond all council district boundaries.
CM McCarthy: How will your past employment at City help you serve. B: understands the way the City works and manages own $200M budget now. 5min buzzer goes off
CM Ibsen asks litmus Q: Is internet a public utility. B: No, but we are doing good work. Wants to help think strategically about how to grow City into 5G
CM Hunter asks about addressing homelessness. Busick suggests ‚Äúcreative but applicable way to allow citizens to help.‚Äù (B mentions it as $10M Q alluding to $ spent this budget)
#TacCouncil hearing 3mins from Busick. Highlighting experience in business, technology &amp; teaching. Says appointee should be consistent w Thoms positions.
Alphabetical order for interviews.
#TacCouncil and we are back... Reminder that the 9 are: https://t.co/D0dn9CbpDu

Hahn: I will be in the communities and neighborhood councils to make sure I'm representing everyone
Hahn: Priorities are homeless, chemical dependency, Econ development
Hahn highlights history and desire to make Council accessible to all.
Eric Hahn now presenting to Council on why he should be appointed to the Citywide position.
@MeridithHatch I don't think it was attraction, but rather current state of economy. She wanted to move away from such a reliance on pubfund
Baird: Homeless is complicated issue w multiple funding sources. City's attempt to fund beds &amp; faith based orgs is best approach
Baird says jobs will be attracted to Tacoma by making it a nice place to live while addressing social problems
Baird believes Tacoma should be more economically diverse by attracting more businesses. She notes 9 out of 10 jobs come from public funding
Baird unfamiliar w Project PEACE initiative but feels public safety is primary responsibility of Council. Police Dept is making strides
Baird says she likes the short term nature of the position. Would take a leave from UWT to hold position. Unlikely to run for seat.
Baird supports denser neighborhoods to achieve affordable housing #tacoma council. Also "decentralizing the business districts"
Katie Baird, economics professor at UWT, currently interviewing for #tacoma council opening

Tacoma Rail's budget will be $66.6M after a modest increase. [No comment on where this increase came from] https://t.co/G7rYsGUVAy
@candiceruud $20M is only half of projected deficit. Q should be, what rate increase would be w/o? Sounds like @MyTPU might provide later
Tacoma Water demand down due to Auburn reducing water purchase. Expenses up due primarily due to debt service costs. Combined, 4% rate+/yr
CM McCarthy asking for breakout of costs associated with Click all-in. TPU clarifies that only 1/2 of rate increase is expense related.
@MyTPU says $43M rate increase looks like almost 6% increase in 2017 AND again in 2018 https://t.co/Plm7CvMcje
@MyTPU says that declining wholesale combined with lower power usage &amp; increase in expenses (like click) means $43M in power rate increases
