@PARISDENNARD great work taking Mudd to the cleaners, a job well done, sirüëåüá∫üá∏ great job taking the high road and winning!
@codykeenan That was a fantastic speech-- I did not support POTUS BO in either election-- yet found this speech worthy of admiration. Thank you for giving it, Cody. -CN
@mrkdotnew That's a good point-- I think everyone has racial bias, and internal experiences and politics and social interaction create stimulus within those structures, I can certainly see the concern with the diversions which people do when asked questions. Thanks for the convo ‚úÖ
@mrkdotnew The item about not spending time in a community of color is not true--and that is important if I did not genuinely want to learn more about these perspectives I would not have spent time responding to hundreds of these comments.Unlike Angela discussion occurred
@mrkdotnew @angela_rye It was meant to be dismissive of her conclusion the country is not a nice place-but certainly not a helpful statement and a crass and unprofessional tweet. It lessened the value of the real issues. You win that. Her advancement of her positions I have objections to IMO
@mrkdotnew There was previous context /- but your point is valid. My problem is the declaration of the country is such an awful place tends to annoy people that served in the war of all backgrounds which she never did. The flight is jest to that. Employment numbers separate topic.
@icustaring Last I checked I served in a war and also appear on television. Angela appears on television and screams at people. I can cash the check I'm just over the discussion. I just want my veteran of war card with my white privilege card pleaseüëå‚úåÔ∏è
@icustaring Offering Angela a vacation has gotten blown out proportion üá∫üá∏.
@jedijohncurtis Co host* not autocorrect on Twitter. Notice she didn't want to debate or discuss w me. Just  ""throw me to the crowd". It's fine I am handle that many comments were insightful. I just want my vet label if I'm going to get my WP label. I want this country to be the best can be‚úÖ
@jedijohncurtis That's a fair point. I'm capable of more meaningful dialogue. I took issue with the co hair of her she alluding to her being "with a bat ready to roll" while disqualifying others from race discussion. Equality matter/ we need two way 1A for that IMO.
@jedijohncurtis The vacation offering was obviously jestful. My issue is the 1A one way street and the  crass presentation I've watched for some time from ms. R. I just asked if I could have my vet card w my #WP card. Did you read the hate ? I'm here to help on issues but 1A= should I be 2-ways.
@RandomDude_99 Promoting a narrative this country is a really really bad place when they make money and appear on cable television regularly essentially driving conflict. Can we agree most average Americans would love that job? Of course my comment was cynical-hence the jest/ flight out of üá∫üá∏
@RandomDude_99 At end of the day it's almost kind of interesting. 95% of my conflict in life has been with other white men. Why? They are in the majority. Had I made the same remark to Jim Smith white Democrat would I get the racist label? Not for me to decide. I take issue with someone on TV .
@RandomDude_99 @angela_rye Make people leave= offered someone a flight to leave a country they said was not great. It obviously got her attention. I did not hear her plan to increase minority employment at the White House or I would be all ears. The WP card drive by was the end to the means (Twitter) IMO
@davcole I gave it significant thought. I missed her debate where engagement on this issue was discussed? I just watched her screaming about X number of staff people are minority. Ok- i'm all ears to hear it- that's not her goal, David. Her goal is to keep her fans angry/entertained IMO.
@WeCU12 @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam That's a completely valid conversation to be had but it never got discussed because. I am skeptical that achievement is a genuine objective. Absent social engineering I'd support every single avenue to increasing that diversity.
@RandomDude_99 I survived a war it's amusing you think I can't handle a few thousand moaning Twitter sheep. We have now reached the point where offering a woman a free first class flight internationally is an identity politics thing. The point is she does like it here =it's all a rouse
@ravensgirl4eva @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam Only would offering someone a free vacation be considered an identity politics thing for the left. üôÉ The cerebral value of this discussion was pretty much had zero from the beginning.üëå
@Imnotbovvered @ohkaaae @fletcher_maxine @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam I guess that's my final point and I'm done wasting time with strangers, I have survived the war I'm not worried about people griping all night, having a cable news career in the United States would be pretty cool to the average American but for Angela =it's a platform to jab/run.
@fkwilliams207 @angela_rye I was in USA today yesterday knucklehead I work on policy I don't need to scream at people on television for ratings. #sheep leftists. Fun.
@RepaskyCrystal @angela_rye I never thought offering someone a free vacation would be considered sad. At least do me one favor consider this do you really believe her statement that America is not great when she has a cable news career screaming at people on TV? üôåcmon now

@Imnotbovvered @ohkaaae @fletcher_maxine @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam Being a veteran of war it's always just fun to watch people talk about how bad the country is when they have cable news careers where they are paid to create drama.

@Merbabe71 @angela_rye @POTUS44 She said it's not great. My muse it was basically how can being a professional and political success and having a media profession with access to American citizens how on earth is this country not great!? she won't take my vacation offer because she actually does like it here;)
@davehill77 @ausuar @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam And whether a coffee, a phone call or a televised debate, she wants none of that --she wanted to drop the white privilege card + light made  Twitter on fire tonight. Cool. I'm actually open to the conversation. At least the vacation comments are amusingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?
@davehill77 @ausuar @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam David, my issue comes down to one thing a conversation about policy to increase inclusion is something I would support but when you start saying things like the country is not great and qualifying who can say what because of their profile- what do we achieve?
@davehill77 @ausuar @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam Explain further-- I presume that I have an economic advantage because of my demographic? If I agreed lack of diversity in government employment was an issue . ok..disagreement will come in with the governments role-which is ..? Mandate hiring by gender/age/race? Quota ? Etc.
@Merbabe71 @angela_rye @POTUS44 It's amusing you think she has some mass following why is everyone asking me who she is? Better question is what people are accomplishing. She has no desire to have a conversation weather on television or in a coffee shop she just wants to queue the rage. üëå
@mayaherran Offering someone a free vacation? Sounds pretty generous to me.
@fletcher_maxine @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam I did I served in Iraq for one year I've also been around the world to 30 different countries and happen to think this country is great, I guess that's where Angela and I disagree. Instead of debating me she just says white privilege and runs. Why not have a convo? Idk
@ausuar @davehill77 @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam Google my name and CNN. Last I checked I spoke out against the president over the McCain ordeal. See-- it's just so easy to use a label and Q up the rage machine isn't it ?
@Merbabe71 @angela_rye @POTUS44 Actually I was published in USA today yesterday with a comprehensive plan to protect American schools and after this useless conversation is over I will go back to my professional work on REAL issues not #fake rage. And Angela does? Cmon now.
@LauraDoza44 @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam What about the ocean üåä? I just did China for three weeks- never been to Russia yetüôÉ.
@Merbabe71 @angela_rye I'm already on cable news --- is that me and @POTUS44 who worked on veteran mental healthcare legislation for our veterans? I produce policy that tangibly improves peoples lives. The debate offer stands... https://t.co/AbZrVFh776
@Holly_A_K @angela_rye No disagreement with that but when I hear her cohost talk about rolling around with a bat and I hear her dismissing minority enthusiasm for conservative views, I don't think discussion is her goal. Dismissive is/ she's angry. Hence vacation offer.
@davehill77 @angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam For now just Angela;) there are some nice countries I mean she should just take me up on the offer and go to Maldives ? America let's her scream at people on TV all day or that's not great what is ? If she takes the offer we can expand the program ?
@JennyCovinton I don't remember participating in that. She said America was not great so I happily offered to fly her to any country in the world that is great. What's wrong with that ?
@ScarletM1926 @angela_rye I thought I offered to fly her anywhere in the world last I checked most people would find that cool, she said America is not great I want her to go somewhere great. Maldives? Somewhere happy?
@WhoFdTheStork @angela_rye Her cohost advocating for violence against women is not that, and the idea that the government must engineer employment figures based on race is not healthy government policy.
@Holly_A_K @angela_rye I certainly did and we both have freedom of speech which is why a debate would be great. She thinks this country is not great let's watch her debate a veteran of war who thinks it IS great. Also her co-host alluded to violence against women. I find that objectionable? IMO.
@edwardbrowden @angela_rye I am? Last I checked I was lobbying against big pharma;)
@angela_rye @RealDrGina @DailyCaller @breakfastclubam You also are not entitled to a job because of your race. Let me know which airport you want to fly out of it I will pay to relocate you to any country in the world so you can be happy and not live in the dystopian United States.
@Orvieto2016 @charliekirk11 Ehhhhhhh wrong. Minimum wage is nothing anyone should strive for that is why we have colleges, trade schools, libraries, and free will to not get pregnant and prioritize personal economic advancement.
@angela_rye Nope, nice try. You don't know her experience and don't want to learn because you only have one technique = Angry at YOUR internal racial dystopic views. Which country do you want to move to I'll cover your costs I don't want you unhappy in this dystopian land mam.

@SenatorZero @TaskandPurpose @Harvard That is not correct and that is not a verifiable source.  I can show you the specific sources from Harvard.  There are two approved ways to present extension school degrees and saying you were from Harvard university in a public biography does not comport with either.fact.
@SenatorZero @TaskandPurpose @Harvard Wrong. I can show you the specific guidelines. Honestly, these cases people are misleading why not just write the extension school and be proud of it? It violates regulation and I can show you the sources. I attended University of Illinois at Springfield I don't say U of I.

@StevenPadilla8 @TomPorterDC @iava @Kenneth20622641 For airline transport pilot it's actually mandatory but for rotorwing industry is requiring it at this point. The hardest part is the training because it's expensive and you need FAA minimums and also instructor time. Tuesday's Bill oxymoron + during a pilot shortage.
@StevenPadilla8 @TomPorterDC @iava @Kenneth20622641 Agreed. I am going on FOXNews and doing some radio but might turn to the Senate since some of the vets groups are sleeping also the bill was a sleeping "rider" death pill. Thanks for speaking out Steve, any veteran advocate paid by donor dollars should be working on this 4 vets.
@StevenPadilla8 @TomPorterDC @iava @Kenneth20622641 Agreed. Add on: it's not just a pilots license, what is a bachelors degree and certified airline transport pilot commercial federal aviation administration hours. This is commercial training.

The Members of legion deserve it
@Harvard would someone please direct me to the appropriate email for where to report extension school graduates who boldly misrepresent professionally and on LinkedIN-- their degrees and lost them as Harvard University. It's a problem in Washington DC at a prominent vets org. Thx
@GOVCONOPS @AdamWeinstein That is false. @RileyTopping husband attended Harvard and I believe Rory has the specific document stating the year that he earned an extension school degree. Very very very strict rules on how those degrees are presented and he is in 100% violation of those rules. Lou is a phony
@GOVCONOPS @AdamWeinstein Lying Lou Celli should apologize publicly or be terminated next for his Harvard misrepresentations.
@GOVCONOPS @AdamWeinstein Well we don't want to hurt people unnecessarily or take enjoyment in someone's falling.

@rvrdlb Inside the Bill section 201 he cuts millions of dollars in public funding to veterans training to become pilots and fill the American job shortage. The bill is fine without that absolute death pill that pretty much on does the entire purpose of the bill.
@EricLMitchell @RepArrington Eric, i'm going on Fox and friends Monday you are closer with Sean Hannity, the congressman hasn't said a peep since he snuck this death pill in his job bill -- what's the point of a job bill if you take away the most valuable training? Let's work on getting a debate scheduled.

@tambid1 @RyanAFournier @RepArrington He is a newer Member OF Congress that I think means well but he has this horrible staffer (who never served) who sneaks this bill into bigger bills because he doesn't think vets should be able to fly in flight courses because our benefits in his view should only be liberal arts

@StevenPadilla8 @RepMikeCoffman I don't know that Coffman supports it at all-- he's been solid on vets but most groups today didn't know section 201 was sneaked into the TAP bill. Ask Coffman to have Roe drop it they have a few hours.
@JenBurch15 @RepMikeCoffman It is being led by a civilian staffer who doesn't think veterans should be able to acquire pilot training because of it's cost. In the hearings they vote "en bloc" and bundle the bills. As a stand alone they won't vote on it. @RepMikeCoffman could probably get Roe to strip it.
.@nikkiwentling @LeoShane we have a TAP bill tomorrow that is supposed to be a veteran employment bill with Section 201 that cuts millions of dollars from veterans education and aviation in the GI Bill Any coverage under consideration ? Talk to @AMVETSHQ

@Uber_Support It appears that Uber team has corrected the fare. I appreciate that and I believe that is fair considering the driver was heading to Canada and missed multiple turns. Most of the drivers are good, why not just remove these drivers from the fleet ? Thanks much for your time.
@Uber_Support Look at the route!!!!! We were stuck in the tunnel for two miles after missing 3 exits. Just look at the route. If heading to Canada was the destination he did a great job. If you want to defend this failure again I'll contact your executive team. Return the fare please. https://t.co/5JNxOWM96x
@Uber_Support I am going to put up screenshots of the route and this zero star driver driving miles in the WRONG direction your stock passive voice response will not work. Defending failure is not the customer service rubric to follow. I'll post those photos shortly
@Uber_Support Driving miles in the wrong direction should be cause for a full refund do I need to send screenshots of his insane drive path?
@Uber_Support The excess charges for the 4 mile detour were removed. That is deficient the whole entire business meeting was missed because of the driver missing three turns. Just please refund the $10.00 and check my ride history- 90% of your drivers are good. This driver should be removed.
@Uber_Support Cancelation fee what are you talking about ? I arrived at the Destination after heading 3 miles past it because I started manually directing the driver. I arrived at the destination what cancelation fee?
@Uber the nightmare continues every 200 Great drivers you have one incompetent moron that drives so bad that you want to quit Uber forever. This is that moron. Full refund please and a credit and please counsel this driver. He doesn't know DC from Bejing. https://t.co/ICX6BFbdr3

Hearing good concepts to lower prescription drug costs-- and for vets outside the VA- that's needed.Seems doubtful that Pharma companies will take the lead. #POLITICOHealth. Seems drug companies prefer to blame every other entity except them for skyrocketed costs
#PoliticoHealth discussion is interesting good event by Politico + Pharma. Agree w panelist K Bass about cost management at point of sale and more the "rubber hits the road" for patients. Many vets that don't use VA feel they overpay for medical drugs.
Enjoying the #POLITICOHealth event today @Newseum. Heard Pfizer CEO bob and weave and use my favorite cost euphemism "innovation" while complaining about premium reduction. I understand good quality drugs cost money. Never hear clear strategies on how they are reducing cost?
CEO of Pharma mentioned "market solutions" to bring down prescription drug prices, then pivots to finger pointing at PBMs and concern over costs "over there" insupply chain. Seemed like an overt side step and missed opportunity to hear how they are stepping up? #politicohealth

@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier Did you write that joke? I mean that was good. Really, your poll numbers jumped from .0% to .2%. You made a comment about smoking earlier. I thought you were peacing out but you are still babbling. What branch btw? Don't say Coast GuardüôÑ
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier Tell that to the vets with phantom pains that science can't identify the root of--- it should be studied and available for treatment. Besides opioids gritting and bearing the pain what other alternatives are there? Marijuana is illegal because of pharma lobby. That's it.
@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier I don't smoke. Wrong again bud. Good leave the advocacy for those of us in the field and in front of policy makers. Odd you aren't concerned about alcohol but spun up on marijuana. Cheers
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier I don't smoke and nice try. One is a bunk survey and the second is erroneous. The third was a trial that doesn't control or provide cohort characteristics. Did the youth have mental health issues outside of study? Genetic factors? Trials. These aren't scientifically conclusive.
@krileayn @AwareChicken @RyanAFournier Fair point but where are the studies that psychiatric drugs benefit patients? Recent study at Yale concludes it's all nonsense. So-- goes in both directions (conventional drugs v alternative).
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier Many choose suicide. What pharmacy drugs!? Opioids? ...., not so sure.
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier Stats? Sources?
@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier There is supposed to be an apostrophe in there. Make a dumb comment about the Internet brah + ya get some jazz. You should know how a duel works right? üòé
@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier Entrepreneurs get rich no matter they are doing. The point is the drug should be available if a veteran and their doctor choose and it eliminates excruciating pains such as phantom pains. You don't want the kids  on dope ? Me neither. For vets ‚úÖ if they choose
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier If marijuana is the biggest problem that's good. I know vets with missing legs that experience alarming phantom pains. The marijuana stops that pain. Not for everyone.
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier How are the suicide statistics doing? How many confirmed deaths from marijuana? Compared to alcohol it's an easy case. 92% of vets want to see the treatment available under doctor supervision.
@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier I'm not going to punch down, although it's fun. Don't make a dumb comment to a guy about checking the internet. No one is promoting mass marijuana. I represent veterans and they have issued opinions contrary. Cheers brah.
@Josephpthornto1 @jaaronroseok @RyanAFournier Not likely. I am running 7 companies. Little busy but I'll text Al Gore maybe since he created the internet he can round it up.
@LineyRvS @RyanAFournier The vets disagree. Check the surveys
@_starwarsdude_ @liberallycrazy @RyanAFournier Every now and again ? I've seen alcohol destroy lives and it killed my best friend. I think marijuana should be regulated- but certainly researched as a treatment for vets.
@Josephpthornto1 @RyanAFournier Feel the same way about alcohol? I have amputees that say otherwise. And the article is about research not legalization. Just FYI . Thanks. C.
@aaronatkinson20 @MGalaznik @RyanAFournier Agreed. Regulation. We don't need drunk kids either.

@DCVAMC @VeteransHealth I appreciate the response. I think there is a local leadership issue at the Washington DC VA. Every employee should refer ov 30 d for choice
@DCVAMC @VeteransHealth They told me I would have to wait two months for an appointment. I was seen today after explaining the choice program tenants to my PCT
@JJapgar @KrisGoldsmith85 @mabryant256 @DocFooch @laurenmla610 Healthcare is worthy of a long discussion. I'm skeptical of all parties. Dems want broke/disjointed healthcare GOP want unaffordable care.
@KrisGoldsmith85 @JJapgar @mabryant256 @DocFooch @laurenmla610 Also Takano won't tell you those millions of vets are bypassing much cheaper care in VA system designed for them. Can't have it all/ tax Cr.
@KrisGoldsmith85 @JJapgar @mabryant256 @DocFooch @laurenmla610 Kris is correct. But again, all vets are different and depends on their plan. Takano is doing what I hate, using vets as a pawn bucket
@JJapgar @mabryant256 @DocFooch @laurenmla610 @KrisGoldsmith85 If they have a private plan but VA healthcare proper is not impacted. Non-Va care(choice) referrals are a bigger issue for enrollees IMO.
@JJapgar @mabryant256 @DocFooch @laurenmla610 @KrisGoldsmith85 Veterans are also individuals or depends who you ask, some vets lose tax benefits if outside VA/ others have relief. Depends on individual
Despite clear posted graphics  frontline staff in health clinics @DCVAMC don't know about choice/ won't refer. Scheduling 60 days out. https://t.co/PL7pHThEiD
@VeteransHealth @DCVAMC Thank you, who on the leadership team can I email? Two clinics have frontline staff unfamiliar w choice program. That is a leadership issue
@VeteransHealth @DCVAMC Thank you--- the clinic and front line employees are not familiar w choice at DCVA. That is troubling. I'll talk to P.A. Staff. Thnx
