The senate should unanimously pass @SenatorLankford amendment #4121 to fix language in current bill that discriminates against Christian and other religious groups. Proud to sponsor this fix. Faith-based groups deserve full participation in federal prison system.
I'm proud to have @SenJohnKennedy, @SenJohnBarrasso, Senator Kyl, @SenSasse, and @SenToomey as cosponsors for this amendment. We only need 51 votes to make this bill a little better and safer. I urge all my colleagues to support it.
Now, please tell me which of the crimes in my amendment should remain eligible for early release time credits. Coercing a child to engage in sexual activity? Assaulting law enforcement? Assaulting a child? Carjacking? Bank robbery? Hate crimes? They should all be made ineligible.
Opponents of my amendment continue to push false claim it “would make virtually all federal prisoners ineligible for earned time credits,” so I’m posting analysis from bipartisan US Sentencing Commission confirming 62% of prisoners are still eligible if my amendment‘s adopted: https://t.co/ynwVta0e6E
I also strongly support @jiminhofe's amendment #4141 that would fix the unconstitutional, unfunded mandate in the First Step Act that could bankrupt local jails. This is a serious issue in the bill that has received little attention thus far.
And @SenSasse would also get rid of the section that reduces the penalty for repeat fentanyl trafficking in amendment #4142. Fentanyl traffickers deserve no leniency. I strongly support.
In amendment #4143, @SenSasse would fix the "productive activities" loophole that allows violent felons to gain early release credits by playing softball. Why do bill authors allow “productive activities” to qualify?
The @SenSasse amendment #4144 deserves support. It bans felons who assault police officers, violent bank robbers, and carjackers from early release. Violent offenders should not be eligible for early release to home confinement or to “supervised release.”
My colleague @Senorrinhatch has introduced comprehensive mens rea reform in amendment #4137 that I hope will be accepted by my colleagues. Disappointed this was not included in bill.
And @SenToomey amendment #4120 would provide more funding for victims of violent crimes. This is an outstanding and much-needed amendment that deserves my colleagues’ support.
I also support @SenToomey amendment #4119 that increases the penalty against violent felons who stalk children.
I am proud to support @SenToomey First Step Act amendment #4118 that would raise the penalty for felons who murder police officers or first responders by ensuring that capital punishment is an option.
While I still have concerns with First Step Act, I strongly support and am proud to sponsor @SenatorLankford amendment #4121 to ensure faith-based organizations can work with prisoners to improve lives and reduce recidivism. I urge my colleagues to pass this common sense fix.
It’s fair to disagree on the merits of offering early release as an incentive to “low-risk” violent offenders, but this claim being circulated is not true.
Proponents of the FSA misleadingly claim my amendment “would make virtually all federal prisoners ineligible for earned time credits.” But the U.S. Sentencing Commission confirms 62% of federal prisoners would remain eligible even if my amendment is adopted.
The Cotton-Kennedy Amdts to FSA exclude all violent felons &amp; sex offenders from any early release credits. Current bill allows 1,466 sex offenders convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2422 to qualify for time credits. Our amendment fixes this. cc: @SenJohnKennedy https://t.co/rkOVyanDwD https://t.co/cXhBSq1Fg5

Fake news? Then why did new bill change to exclude more violent felons? Unfortunately, new version still allows multiple classes of violent sex offenders to get early release. https://t.co/rrfyFX2HDY
I look forward to debating this bill on the Senate floor and introducing amendments to address its many remaining threats to public safety.
Crimes still eligible for early release in the latest version of the bill:	1. Bank robbery with a dangerous weapon (18 U.S.C. § 2113(d))	2. Assault against a child (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5))	3. Carjacking with intent to cause death (18 U.S.C. 2119(1))
Unfortunately, the bill still has major problems &amp; allows early release for many categories of serious, violent criminals. This includes felons who commit violent bank robberies with dangerous weapons, who assault children, &amp; who commit carjacking with the intent to cause death.
For months I’ve said the First Step Act allows violent felons and sex offenders to be released early. I’m pleased the drafters have finally acknowledged that reality and made changes to address some of the specific issues I pointed out.
I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass legislation addressing these malign activities of the Chinese Communist Party during the 116th Congress.

That’s why this bill’s sponsor list IS its whip list. In fact, the sponsor list is longer than the whip list because even some sponsors don’t want it to become law.
So when cornered by a zealous bill sponsor, most senators will hem &amp; haw, trim, &amp; hedge. They will say something abstract like, “I agree, we need to do something,” etc etc. But then they tell the whip they don’t want to touch the bill with a 10-foot pole.

Only thing worse than early release from prison of thousands of serious, violent, &amp; repeat felons is to do that in a spending bill with no debate or amendments, forcing senators to either shut down government or let felons out of prison.

This loophole is dangerous and should be removed from the bill. Current safety valve already allows truly low-level, first time offenders a break. Why do proponents want to let repeat offenders with lengthy, violent histories off the hook?
Many violent felons who served &lt;12 months would be eligible. Reduced sentence under safety valve = earlier release than current law.
According to DOJ, because Brock Turner only served 3 months for his crime, he will not be excluded from new safety valve if he commits a future drug trafficking crime. He is excluded today.
What’s a “serious violent felony”? Only a violent crime where a defendant actually served 12 months or longer. https://t.co/EkqZVTSWzp
First Step Act allows lengthy criminal histories to get reduced sentences, &amp; adds massive, dangerous loophole. Judges can waive criminal record requirements as long as defendant hasn’t committed a “serious violent felony” or “serious drug felony.” See text. https://t.co/6dGmXaIXxg
Today, ‘safety valve’ in fed law allows fed judges to ignore mandatory minimums and sentence certain defendants to reduced time. It’s meant for rare, truly first-time cases, so one condition is defendant must have no or very limited state or fed criminal history.
First Step Act says crimes are “serious violent felonies” only if prisoner served 12+ months. Brock Turner, who served just 3 months for sexual assault, is not a “serious violent felon” under the jailbreak bill. Here is why that matters.		https://t.co/2Qqm1xOhbJ

Last year, 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. Why does the bill reduce the penalty for repeat fentanyl and heroin traffickers?
Why not add these crimes to the 'exclusion from early-release' list?
1.  Drug-related robberies involving assault with a dangerous weapon (U.S.C. § 2118(c)(1))	2. Assault resulting in substantial bodily injury to a child (U.S.C. §113(a)(7)	3. Threats to assault, kidnap, or murder a federal judge or official (U.S.C. § 115(a)(1)(b))
While the bill excludes some crimes from earning the new early release “time credits”, why are the following crimes missing from the exclusion list?

.@SenMikeLee sunlight and debate are good things. Looking forward to a robust debate of bill’s text and its impact on public safety.
It’s true that for this new time-credit system, BOP needs to classify as “low-risk”, although other provisions in bill still apply to “high-risk” prisoners. But do you trust BOP to have perfect judgment about recidivism-risk? Why not just exclude?
Some criminals are ineligible for new credits, but many serious &amp; violent felons are eligible, because “ineligible convictions” list is inadequate. One example eligible for early release under the bill:  18 U.S.C. 113(a)(7) – assaulting a child resulting in serious bodily injury.
Drafter’s own fact sheet about new bill failed to mention this major change. You have to read bill’s text to learn that inmates can now get “release”, instead of just “pre-release custody.” https://t.co/MwQrvVuywa
House-passed bill said inmates only get “pre-release custody” for new credits. Senate drafters quietly slipped in “or supervised release.” Major change. Supervised release = check in with parole officer, i.e., “release.”
Proponents now say new “time credits” are not early release b/c inmates use them for “prerelease custody,” not release. Prerelease custody (also problematic) was the only option in the House-passed First Step Act, but not so in new bill. Take a look. https://t.co/oPSAoEaVw2
Here’s what Congressional Budget Office said about the House-passed version (a far more modest-bill, without sentencing reductions): “[the bill] would result in the release of thousands of people from federal prisons earlier than would occur under current law.” No early release? https://t.co/d3I6nhD7Mg
.@SenMikeLee: “Nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release.” But as I showed yesterday, the bill text – confirmed by DOJ –  is clear that repeat fentanyl traffickers can be released from prison in 1/2 the time under the FIRST STEP Act compared to current law.
My colleague @SenMikeLee and I have a good-faith, substantive disagreement on wisdom of the First Step Act. By looking at bill text, hopefully we can at least agree on the facts.

This trafficker went from 20-year sentence to out in about 10 years (or less, if combined with programs already in law) if low-risk and out in 15 years if high-risk. Yet proponents claim there’s “no early release.” Should we not hold a hearing on this bill?
If the trafficker in “low-risk” category, he can use credits to transfer into "pre-release custody or supervised release." In other words, he's out early. If high-risk, trafficker still gets 25% 841(b) reduction. https://t.co/Z52w29VLZL
Look at vague definition of "productive activities" that result in early release "time credits." Bureau of Prisons said this could include playing softball, watching movies, or playing cards. https://t.co/hxQZlrKtE2
Some offenders ineligible for this, but fentanyl traffickers are eligible. Only fentanyl organizers—under 10% of traffickers—are excluded. This was sticking point in negotiations. @NationalSheriff &amp; I wanted all excluded. Drafters said no. https://t.co/z9OsaPmkkz
Then, bill creates new "time credits" section, and trafficker can get 10 days credit per 30 spent in "evidence-based recidivism reduction programming or productive activities." 15 days if “low-risk.” This = up to 1/3rd of the sentence, or 5 out of 15 years. https://t.co/4gl4KzJbAo
Next, trafficker is eligible for expanded "good time" credits because bill allows offenders to earn 54 days credit for each year sentenced instead of each year served. This section is applied retroactively, too. https://t.co/RIGN8BSEdH
Assume this trafficker has a prior serious drug felony. Under current law, minimum 20-year sentence. Under the First Step Act, reduced to 15 years, or 5 years earlier release. https://t.co/2dwUeSNd0j
Proponents of the First Step Act have said that "nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release." But look at what the bill does to a fentanyl trafficker convicted of trafficking 1lb (enough to kill &gt;100K people) under §841(b).
Look at the bill. Inmates also get early release in many other sections, including retroactive application of Fair Sentencing Act, reduced punishments for trafficking fentanyl under 841(b), and retroactive expansion of “Good Time” credits. https://t.co/snCtIcHjJh
.@SenMikeLee no early release? Look at text. Eligible prisoners – including those who assault law enforcement officers with deadly weapons - earn new “time credits” for “pre-release custody or supervised release," which is why sheriffs call this dangerous. https://t.co/a8ahFebRVU
The "final" text of the FIRST STEP Act was only released yesterday, and details seem to continue to change. If it’s finalized &amp; ready for a vote, why offer to keep changing it?
Or that it gives early release to “low level, nonviolent” criminals who steal passports &amp; immigration docs from aliens who have been trafficked to keep them in captivity (USC 1592(a)). Hearings &amp; open debate would bring needed daylight...
There have been no hearings on this bill. Why are proponents afraid of hearings &amp; letting members find out what’s in it? Maybe because it gives early release to “low level, nonviolent” criminals like those convicted of assaulting police, even with deadly weapons (USC 111(a))... https://t.co/lQnYGfF1o0

By reversing the Obama-era Browning-Ferris standard, the National Labor Relations Board’s proposed rule returns to the time-honored definition of ‘joint employer.’
This EO signals to foreign adversaries that might try to influence or undermine our elections that we won't tolerate such interference &amp; will impose high penalties for it.

It’s rich for the Russians to protest the U.S.’s refusal to certify one of their planes for the Open Skies Treaty when they routinely restrict surveillance flights over Kaliningrad. The Open Skies Treaty is out of date and favors Russia, and the best way forward is to leave it.
The next time you pick up school supplies for your kids, gas up the car, or buy groceries for your family, remember the tens of thousands of Arkansans who currently spend their lives on the road, away from their own families, to make that all possible.

Pleased the amendment I introduced with @ChrisVanHollen &amp; @SenSchumer is included in the NDAA. The threat Huawei &amp; ZTE pose to our national security is too great to ignore. This amendment will help keep Americans' private info out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
Given their repeated violations of U.S. law, we cannot trust Huawei or ZTE to respect U.S. national security, and so it's vital we hold them accountable and pass this amendment: https://t.co/4thc5Gm5KS
Huawei &amp; ZTE have extensive ties w/ the Chinese Communist Party, as well as a track record of doing business w/ rogue regimes like North Korea &amp; Iran. It's only prudent that no one in the federal government use their equipment or services &amp; that they receive no taxpayer dollars.
My letter to Secretaries Nielsen &amp; Acosta regarding the increase in the number of H-2B temporary nonagricultural visas without "improving protections for American workers and visa holders and increasing enforcement of wage and workplace safety laws." --&gt; https://t.co/3ap2ScgMMO

This legislation will return audit requirements to the former standard, one appropriate for these kinds of firms and which will allow our broker-dealers to expand and help create more jobs: https://t.co/7SKt8bKmIG
It makes no sense to require our small non-custodial broker-dealers to get the same audits required of public companies. There's no evidence such a requirement has created a healthier investment environment; it has merely contributed to higher costs and fewer small firms.

9/9 Think instead of smaller working-class enclaves where wages have stagnated or dropped over a generation. We don't think of them enough.
8/9 But to extent Houston is relevant, I encourage you to look outside 4th largest city w/ robust oil &amp; tech industry &amp; high median income.
7/9 Your Houston vignette seems more of an argument for local housing deregulation, not higher levels low-skill immigration.
6/9 The powerful &amp; elite reap the benefits of constant influx of low-skill labor while working Americans &amp; recent immigrants bear the costs.
5/9 It's these 'forgotten' groups that my immigration bill seeks to help.
4/9 NAS report also shows low-skill immigration harms the employment of native teens, low-skill disadvantaged minorities &amp; prior immigrants.
3/9 It says while negative wage effects are 'very small' for all 'natives OVERALL' the effect is more severe for natives w/o a HS diploma.
2/9 You misquote the Nat'l Acad. of Sciences report. It DOESN'T say that negative wage effect on natives w/o HS diploma is 'very small.'
1/9 Hey @nytdavidbrooks, read your column w/ interest &amp; appreciate your taking a close look at my immigration bill. Some points in response.
