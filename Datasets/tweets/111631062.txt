Who else has great stories or anecdotes to share about @GDouglasJones? I know I sure want to hear them!!!
Did you know that @GDouglasJones is a huge proponent of criminal justice reform? If he was in office, we would have a much better chance fighting the private prison industry and ending the era of mass incarceration.
Did you know that @GDouglasJones is determined to see the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorized? Millions of families around the country could breathe a little bit easier if he was in office and able to reauthorize that very important program.
Having a Senator like @GDouglasJones could spur renewable investment and economic growth, creating thousands of skilled high-wage jobs. That would make a HUGE difference for Alabama families.
Did you know that @GDouglasJones is a big supporter of investing in renewable energy? Alabama has huge solar potential and great wind potential too, especially in NE AL and on the Gulf Coast.
Did you know that @GDouglasJones is a big supporter of raising the minimum wage? That's something that would make a HUGE difference to many Alabama workers who live near our below the poverty line.
@GDouglasJones That sounds like the kind of leader I want to see in the US Senate holding polluters accountable. Someone who has a track record of holding polluters accountable already.
@GDouglasJones But did you know that in 2004, he was court-appointed to lead the judicial enforcement efforts against Monsanto in an environmental clean-up case in Anniston, AL?
For example, most people know that @GDouglasJones successfully prosecuted the men who committed the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham that killed four little girls and traumatized the nation.
Hey everyone, let's take five minutes and write something about how awesome @GDouglasJones is. People vote for things they believe in more than they vote against things they are afraid of. And Doug Jones is worth believing in!

@UMich @LEOUnionUmich @UMich ran a $513 million surplus on $3.2 billion budget last year. Paid Lecturers only $85 million in wages and benefits.
@UMich @LEOUnionUmich @UMich has the ability to raise wages for low-paid Lecturers dramatically w/out driving tuition up. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
@UMich @LEOUnionUmich So @UMich system has over $14 billion in the bank. That's more than the entire Hawaii state budget for FY2016.
@UMich @LEOUnionUmich Don't forget, @UMich also has nearly $3.5 billion in non-endowment unrestricted assets. Annual budget for university is ~ $3.2 billion/yr.
@CodfishBambino Well. Hmmm. It's been a long time since anyone has ever referred to me as "tiny". Might not be able to swing that.
