.@MiningAmerica: "We're proud to support this comprehensive package. The noble goal of the ESA is to ensure conservation and recovery. It has failed in this goal. These bills will restore that mission, and they are crucial reforms." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/BnYuOD1LXU
.@NWRA_Water: "Everyone here supports the goals of ESA. But where we diverge is what's happening on the ground. ESA can be improved for species, and it can be improved for people. This is our home, and we must preserve this area we treasure for futr generations."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/6rgvUnlrwK
.@LimitGovt's Pres. Manning: "I know firsthand: logging was part of the fabric of the Western states including Washington. This is all gone now, and communities are withering. The owl meant to be protected by ESA regs actually ended up hurting its forest habitat."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/2lNrVJl0y1
.@azfb's @loveamericanAG: "I can tell you with 100% certainty that none of the listed species or critical habitat affecting our property actually occur there - and yet, layers of bureaucracy backed up by endless cycles of regulation continue to insist otherwise." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/3B8odzKeYJ
.@NAHBhome: "These are modernization reforms that improve the functionality of the ESA and take huge strides in helping our 140,000 members. Only 3% of species have recovered under ESA. Congress must make these reforms a priority for housing affordability." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/wTnfShD70l
.@API_News: "We think these bills make targeted and effective improvements to the ESA and we are proud to work with you on them going forward."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/pgVqjKnSaG
.@ceidotorg's Myron Ebell: "So many species were extinct when they were listed, or listed due to data error. When those data errors are delisted, they're counted as 'recovered'. The ESA in general is a tool for land control, a political tool rather than a species recovery one." https://t.co/O7fBvTpZXy
.@WesternEnergy1's Kathleen Sgamma: "ESA has become more about controlling land than protecting species. More resources are spent on litigation than on species conservation by far. We support these efforts!"		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/kDYBCsaz72
National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition: "Each of these bills is focused on fixing the problems our members have been telling us about for decades. We've learned many lessons since the bill's enactment and we need to implement those as soon as possible." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/STGWmhx00x
.@FarmBureau: ESA reform is a long time coming and these bills 'fit the bill.' We look forward to working with the Members to get them passed."		 #ModernizeESA https://t.co/lvA264VQLX
.@RepWesterman: "Outside groups flood the species petition system with thousands of unwarranted or understudied petitions - then sue @Interior when they can't keep up. The PETITION Act preserves legitimate listing processes but prevents those absurdities." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/yoQmYwuQqP
.@RepWesterman: "The problem here is the abuse of the Act rather than what the Act was intended to be. ESA is a vital component of our nation's conservation laws. But it's an 8-track law in a Spotify world." 		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/eypIGeerX2
.@RepRalphNorman "The goal of the ESA isn't wrong, but I'm a real estate developer. I know if you don't make changes to adapt, you fall behind. The ESA needs to be modernized, and so I'm proud to sponsor the PREDICTS Act."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/XtKK0XVufS
.@RepNewhouse: "The abysmal 3% recovery rate over 45 years - I think that's something we should all be concerned with. But whenever someone talks about reforming ESA, they're instantly called 'radical'. Look at these reforms: they're anything but radical."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/Pc7MFp4fee
.@NatResources Chairman @RepRobBishop: "I don't want to reject the ESA, I want to reform it. The goals ESA sets out are vague, so we can't tell when we have success. It needs to rehabilitate species, not just list them in the Federal Register."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/BLrVE6Z5TH
.@RepMullin "We're going to make meaningful changes to the ESA and cut red tape. The ESA has been implemented backwards, driven by litigation while not making species any safer from extinction."		#ModernizeESA https://t.co/WuDMRLPjV5
.@CongressmanGT: "This legislation needs to be brought up-to-date - into to the 21st century - and this legislation does that! We need to think about all species - including the human species. " 		#ModernizeESA @NatResources
