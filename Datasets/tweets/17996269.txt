A10: Big thanks to all the conference organizers out there. It's a tough job but I appreciate what they do to bring the community together. #ppcchat
A7: I really need some help with audience creation/updating/management and would love to hear a session on how people are handling it. #ppcchat
@JonKagan Amen to this. I didn't go to all the time/effort/money to get a sales pitch. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse @duanebrown I don't see you forgetting to pack things. Like ever.

@JuliaVyse @duanebrown I love t-shirts. But I probably wear them more often since I'm working from home. Definite no to pens, stress balls, junk. Sweatshirts/hoodies are awesome. Good quality hats &amp; water bottles. I use the stuff all the time so why not get it free. #ppcchat
A4: Gotta get 3-4 ideas that I can implement when I get home. That's #1. Networking is a solid #2. The conversations you can have with the people you meet often elicit the ideas from #1 above. Then it's always nice to have fun, eat good food &amp; bring home some cool swag. #ppcchat
A3: State of Search and Engage have always interested me. #ppcchat
@Realicity You should check out Pubcon in Florida. They do it in the winter, so that's nice.

The biggest weakness with privacy is that you can't regulate people into caring. It's not until the apathy "costs" them that people start to actively take action. A little personal responsibility perhaps? #ppcchat
@ferkungamaboobo It felt like they wanted a simple one-line answer when asking questions with complex answers. If you understand what you're asking then the questions should be more nuanced than "Is my phone tracking me right now?"
Agreed that the people making the regulations are NOT well informed. #ppcchat https://t.co/W3GG0e18wy
I think some privacy concerns are overblown. "Amazon knows my purchase history" - so did your grocery store checker in 1950. "My phone is tracking my location" - private investigators have been tailing people, legally, for a long time. #ppcchat #devilsadvocate
But does Google really have less data on us? Between Gmail, Google Analytics, YouTube, browsing history in Chrome, everything in an Android phone I think they might have FB beat. #ppcchat

@MarkIrvine89 @PPCKirk @ferkungamaboobo @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @bigalittlea You can excuse yourself now.
@MarkIrvine89 @PPCKirk @ferkungamaboobo @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @bigalittlea I think the bigger danger is a small advertiser with really high budgets that are being limited by volume. Google gets things going and spend goes way, way up. Advertiser is pissed off. That is what I foresee.
@MarkIrvine89 @PPCKirk @ferkungamaboobo @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @bigalittlea I agree is seems like it could work. The automatic opt-in is what drives me crazy.
@armondhammer @ferkungamaboobo @PPCKirk @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @MarkIrvine89 @bigalittlea Almost like this is a recipe for disaster...both PR and results. #ppcchat
This. #ppcchat https://t.co/bDyYlYHEug
@ericdfarmer @PPCKirk @ferkungamaboobo @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @MarkIrvine89 @bigalittlea That's your invalid clicks credit each month right?
@ferkungamaboobo @PPCKirk @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @MarkIrvine89 @bigalittlea I agree there are lots of small advertisers that could use help, and I think Google has a good idea here. It's the implementation. Sell them on the benefits to get the opt-in. Don't send an email, opt them in automatically and then take over when nobody replies. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk @beyondcontent @NeptuneMoon @MarkIrvine89 @bigalittlea Targeting non-MCC accounts is almost dirtier. Like they're after people who won't know any better. #ppcchat
A5: How many people approved the opt-out angle? Because every one of them needs to be reprimanded (not fired). Automatically opting in a user to such an intrusive "service" is a terrible customer experience. #ppcchat
@JonKagan Agreed. The bidding automation hasn't worked in Grants for me either. #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon Here it is - https://t.co/LywTAVywfn #noexcuses 		Let me know if you run into any problems.

Looking for recommendations on a VPN. What do you use? Why do you recommend it? Which ones DON'T you recommend?
@dr_pete If you went to men's sizing in women's jeans you'd need to take those numbers off the outward-facing tags.

@jstatad What is the split now?
If Bing let you use LinkedIn targeting on Display they could get publishers to switch from AdSense because the CPCs/CPMs would be much better. Solve some of the reach/traffic issues. #ppcchat
@ericdfarmer @amaliaefowler Should be easy since Microsoft owns both right? #ppcchat
A4: Double down on the LinkedIn targeting integration. #ppcchat
A3: Already mentioned the offline editor, so I'll give my 2nd request: Get some decent B2B targeting. We lost most of it in the past year or so and if they don't get it back they leave the door open for Bing/LinkedIn to take more budgets. #ppcchat
A2: Stop forcing "Smart" crap and automation on advertisers. If they're really that much better advertisers should gladly opt in. If they're not good enough to do that, then make them better. #ppcchat

@JuliaVyse You still watching this hearing?
@PPCKirk @JuliaVyse If you recall, Microsoft made a pretty decent offer to buy Yahoo right before they totally face-planted. I just think Spiegel is too proud to take it.
@PPCKirk @JuliaVyse I think the acquisition would be for the audience/user base, not the tool itself.
A5: Google seems to not have been affected on the revenue side despite all the controversy. Facebook took a hit, but not GOOG. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse I actually see SNAP as a very attractive acquisition right now, but I'm just not sure who wants it. Thoughts? #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse He could buy SNAP right now with his pocket change. It's less than $6/share and the total market cap is only $7.5B. If Bezos wanted it he'd already have it.
@JuliaVyse They just copied stories and stole SNAPs thunder enough that they don't need it. Spiegel should've sold when he got the first offer. #ppcchat
A4: I thought they'd just kill exact match as a name and call it "Smart Match" or something dumb. #ppcchat
@markpgus @Mel66 @MarkIrvine89 @BingAds Google axed Customer Match entirely until you spend over $50K (lifetime). #ppcchat

@Mel66 @bgtheory Yes.
@michellemsem About a month ago I got notified on a newer account. Google basically saying they don't trust smaller advertisers to correctly handle their data/lists. #ppcchat
@bgtheory Audience management. I can lay out a funnel, define audiences, etc. but as people start moving from one to another or get into multiple audiences it gets messy fast.
@robbettis I agree with @michellemsem. Anything unusual about this account?
A5: Cutting budgets on a flat percentage. For example, cutting all budgets by 25%. Needs to be a smarter approach. #ppcchat
@ferkungamaboobo I agree with this. Product decisions move toward less cost/higher value so you may have to promote different products. Same with services. #ppcchat

@markpgus @andreacruz92 @GoogleAds I was pleasantly surprised because it's the first good news I've had for my non-profit client in years. (regarding their Google Grant)
@andreacruz92 @GoogleAds I only run broad match in Google Grants and they changed something in their algo a couple weeks back. Actually tightened up broad match (fewer imp. but better CTR). #ppcchat
@ferkungamaboobo @duanebrown @NeptuneMoon I don't doubt it plays a BIG factor.
@amaliaefowler Just call it "Google Match". #ppcchat
A7: Stop calling it "exact" match @GoogleAds. Just stop. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse Another thing that blows me away is how much info people willing fork over to 3rd parties. Like apps where you scan your receipts to get a few bucks back. They're selling your purchase history. Loyalty programs too. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk But what if you're building audiences based on observations coming from customer service reps &amp; sales reps? You know, where they tell you a real age but then it doesn't match with the digital audience? #ppcchat
@duanebrown I think Google should be getting as much heat as Facebook. The big difference to me is that Facebook got busted. Google know soooooo much about people. #ppcchat
Side Q - If Google's audience data was as good as Facebook, wouldn't they be facing the same kind of scrutiny that FB has been getting? #ppcchat
A2: I feel it's the usual relevancy creep from Google. They loosen up the algo, it shows a bunch of crap, I add negatives, Google got high-quality QC for free, repeat. #ppcchat

Q7: Last question, what is the one piece of advice you'd give a new person in PPC on this topic? Be specific. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk @markpgus @jdprater @NeptuneMoon @BingAds Many of our stuff is 3 days on Prime. You have to really pay attention when buying.
@nateknox Feel free to chime in after the fact. @AzeemPPC makes a recap and will pick up your answers. #ppcchat
@markpgus @jdprater @NeptuneMoon @BingAds Nearest Whole Foods is Utah. Me and @PPCKirk live in outer darkness by shipping measures.
@PPCKirk Is the Harvest integration available on the free tier of Asana?
@jdprater @markpgus @NeptuneMoon @BingAds Now I feel like you're just bragging.
Q6: Already hearing a little chatter about this, but what effect is automation having on your efficiency?  #ppcchat
Yes, I would love a Facebook Editor tool. Would save me hours. #ppcchat https://t.co/jqG1dZlbbv
Q5: What tools do you use to improve your efficiency? #ppcchat		Hearing @asana and @harvest. I use @basecamp with some work too.
Q4.1 For spend efficiency, where are you getting the "truth"? Heard GA so far. #ppcchat
@jdprater @BingAds I think so, because you're right that Amazon is double dipping by taking the commission on the sale and charging for the ad spend.
@jdprater @BingAds My clients have products with healthy enough margins where Amazon makes sense. It's also a large enough growth opportunity that they're willing to shave a little margin to get the lifetime value (multiple lifetime purchases, most via email) #ppcchat
Q4: How are you tracking your efficiency? #ppcchat
A3: I get great efficiency from @BingAds when I can convince clients to fire it up. FB is tons more competitive over the last 12-18 months &amp; much harder to get the efficiency. Been getting more out of Amazon Ads for a couple ecomm clients recently as well. #ppcchat
Q3: What channels are getting you the most efficiency for your budgets? What channels are getting less efficient? #ppcchat
A2: I agree with @PPCKirk on email, but also struggle with audience updating/management. So many possibilities and so many of them need updating constantly. Thorn in my side right now. #ppcchat
Q2: In what areas are you struggling with efficiency? #ppcchat
Smart! #ppcchat https://t.co/fMTamIfB5V
@markpgus Both. #ppcchat
@duanebrown Nice!

@kristy I agree we need to be taking better care of the planet. One area that gets glossed over in these discussions is the people negatively affected (lost jobs, etc.) It will be hard to convince someone who is losing their livelihood.

@markpgus Well played.
@timothyjjensen They wouldn't dare take a 10-20% reduction in ad revenue.
If Google Ads really trusted their machine learning they'd turn on close variant and intent matching for negative keywords. #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @GoogleAds I think @LukeAlley hit it on the nose. Every negative KW is potential lost revenue. #ppcchat
They've built a great business with this strategy because churn was really high in the early days. https://t.co/FUafsbFHZ7

@Mel66 @GoogleAds Definitely a mistake on the rep's part, but this was a rep from their agency team. Doesn't instill much confidence when they don't understand basic policies correctly. #ppcchat
I need to start recording calls to @GoogleAds support. Today the rep told me that my ads needed to have exactly the same URL (not just TLD) to meet the "One website per ad group" policy.  #ppcchat
@jdb426 Google has effectively been doing this with extensions for some time now. Callouts being the main culprit. Given that most people scan and don't read blocks of text, I think the effect will be minimal, EXCEPT it makes ads look more like organic results.

A1: Both at work. Still more manual than automated. #ppcchat
@timmhalloran If the data @bgtheory used is from Adalysis customers, then it's likely they're accounts that are in better shape than average. And should be testing ads regularly, thus giving algo more to work with. Interesting thought.
@timmhalloran I'm actually surprised the Google-generated ads help up as well as they did. Some of the stuff reps have sent me over the years set my expectations pretty low.

@brie_e_anderson I have an HVAC client ad we excluded mobile from our regular search campaigns, built campaigns targeting only mobile devices, and only added call-only ads. That was my solution to ensure the call-only ads got the impressions. Hope it helps.
@brie_e_anderson In an existing campaign, Google Ads may just be preferring your regular ads because of their history. If in separate campaign you need to ensure your regular campaigns are excluding mobile to push all the impressions over.
@brie_e_anderson Depends on the targeting. Did you add call-only ads to a regular campaign or do you have them in a separate campaign?

Now to the meat of the discussion. I'll be asking followup questions.		Q3: How will you be handling it/making changes? Provide your logic because I think there are numerous potential solutions/workarounds. #ppcchat
A2: Courtesy of Google Ads allowing 2X daily spend &amp; the Labor Day weekend I would have anticipated lots of wasted spend that I would spend all day Tuesday cleaning up. #ppcchat
Q2: How large of a negative impact would you anticipate on your campaigns if no additional action was taken on your part?  #ppcchat
@amaliaefowler Haven't been to see it yet. Excited though.
A1.1 I am more likely to forget ad copy than forget excluding https://t.co/dA25cWWSrK in GDN campaigns. #ppcchat
@stevegibsonppc I have to agree with you on this one. Seems like a pretty shameless money grab. #ppcchat

@GoogleAds Also mention that once I save a set of columns, they're only available to select when in that exact area (i.e. keywords, search terms, ad groups, demographics, etc.) so I end up saving my columns in 50 different places too. #ppcchat
The most annoying thing about the new @GoogleAds UI is the 50 different times I have to customize columns when auditing a new account. Campaign, ad group, keywords, search terms, settings, devices, locations, etc. It's terrible and wastes my time.

A6: Never turn your back on automation. That's when it gets you. #ppcchat
@amaliaefowler @timothyjjensen @jdprater @markpgus LinkedIn gets a lot of revenue from memberships subscriptions and from job listings. The ad platform is the red-headed stepchild. #ppcchat @wilcoxaj
@jdprater @markpgus What's been interesting to me is seeing how fast Quora has evolved their offering and I know LI should have more resources. #ppcchat
@markpgus Yep. LI is way behind in pretty much every aspect of PPC. #ppcchat
I appreciate how the answers today are qualifying the how and why. There is so much nuance here that further explanation is vital. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse Remember that I don't trust any of them. @timothyjjensen made me choose between all the evils.
A4: I don't trust any of them, but since you asked in relative terms, I'd say I trust FB the most and AdWords the least. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse @timothyjjensen @jdprater It's true.
A3: Anytime you have low volume there's a risk the automation will go into a death-spiral. Either costs go stratospheric or volume withers. #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen Auto bidding on both Facebook and AdWords has worked well for me (when you've got enough volume). #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen I'm fine with automation when I can measure and see it's improving results (or saving me lots of time). Hate the black boxes. #ppcchat
@nikkijumpfly @adwords Can't belive Twitter let you publish that ;)
@NeptuneMoon @JonKagan I think they're opaque on extensions on purpose. Given how much copy extensions can add/subtract it gives Google tons of latitude to affect ad presentation and messaging. They basically write the ads for even sophisticated/control-freak advertisers.
@NeptuneMoon The one I got for the 10th specifically mentioned the ID of an MCC, not a "real" account. #ppcchat
@JonKagan Really would like to click on Extensions for a campaign and have a quick view of what's there with some metrics. The old interface wasn't great because it only showed one extension type at a time. The new interface tries to show it all but it's a mess. Have to filter.
@scottcowley Talk to @BryantGarvin or @coryhenke
How do you get a non-confusing view of ad extensions in the new interface? Both extensions view and associations view seem deficient. #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @adwords Just one more way @adwords is focusing on smaller advertisers with their redesign.
Anybody know if you can specify the email an automated rule notifies with in AdWords? Can't see how to do it. #ppcchat
How to train your tag manager? Teach it to do what you would do in person, but with digital context. #slcsem

@MilwaukeePPC @neiljcampbell @adwords The Grants program is aggressively pushing users toward AdWords Express with all these rules. It's kinda sad to see.
A2: For ecomm I'm equally enamored with Pinterest &amp; Amazon. For B2B I still fall back on LinkedIn Ads despite their glacial pace of innovation/improvement to the service. #ppcchat
Also LinkedIn. Anybody doing Twitter? #ppcchat

@25HrSolutions DM me your email and I'll invite you.
@25HrSolutions We're not very creative. The FB group is "PPC Chat" ;)
@25HrSolutions @wilcoxaj @michellemsem Try asking questions in the Facebook group or here. Take it to DM or private messaging if you need more depth. Off the record conversations are where some of the best stuff comes from.
A4: Curiosity is a big one. Helps with learning. Also, the ability to put ones self in a customer's shoes (empathy). #ppcchat
A3: Talk with other PPC practitioners (in person is ideal). At conferences, at meetups, etc. Ask questions and listen. This is a very giving community/industry. #ppcchat
A2: Movement from primarily keyword-based targeting to more audience-based targeting (which corresponds with rise of social PPC). #ppcchat
@markpgus Glad to have you join.
A1: Learn as much as you can. Read blogs, go to conferences, chat with industry people &amp; experiment A LOT. #ppcchat

@jdb426 @Matt_Umbro Right? What a mess.
@_GilHong @Matt_Umbro I'd love to see how they handle the "buckets" to have any confidence in their own testing data. #ppcchat
Thank you for joining everyone! Our hour together is up, but I truly appreciate your participation. #ppcchat
But it helps QS!!!! Ugh. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse You're welcome. Thanks for joining!
A9: I've always felt like AdWords made a mess of ads with more than 1 or 2 extensions. At that point there's no cohesiveness, messaging gets muddled and it's crap for readability. #ppcchat
@heyglenns Ouch! (and sorry) How'd you break your leg?
Q9: What are your thoughts on the ad spacing as pointed out by @Matt_Umbro today? #ppcchat https://t.co/VaFZonrqJ7
@JonKagan @DumkeBallZ I have not. You?
A8: This is where I think some transparency would help. If I know how the tech works, I know when it's best to use it, how it's best to use it, etc. Without the knowledge you're just a Borg. #ppcchat
Q8: How do we become "cyborg" marketers without turning into the Borg? (able to use the technology to improve our abilities) #ppcchat https://t.co/JjCAep6SXU
Q7: Let's talk a little automation in the context of transparency: Do you think platforms will open the automation black boxes? Give a little insight perhaps? Hide them better? Because it worries me how little I know about why they work/don't work. #ppcchat
A6: Two main issues. First, it is NOT faster. Don't care how many times they try to convince me. Second, why could default columns not carry over? It adds this huge switching cost that seems unnecessary. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse @_GilHong When they were in the old Opportunities tab they were just plain stupid/bad. They've come a long, long way.
Q6: What bugs you about the new UI or makes your life harder? &lt;rant&gt; #ppcchat
They've been making lots of improvements there for the last several months. I love that they renamed it to ditch the negative associations the Opportunities tab had. #ppcchat https://t.co/ZrgCYZaFvK
A5: I love the Promotions Extension. The custom affinity audiences are pretty cool too. And the new conversion tracking system is an improvement. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse The challenge of launching a new interface is huge. I get it, but the amount of resources needed to maintain 2 interfaces? Just astronomical. And for over 2.5 years! #ppcchat
Q5: What positives have you found in the new UI? (hold the rants on problems for Q6) #ppcchat
A4: I've been about 90% new interface for the last couple weeks. I'm getting used to it. #ppcchat
@KyleShurtz Mainly it was a limited number of products (dealing with the feed is a pain) so they were all being used in both. Just didn't seem to get the volume on keyword targeting.
@JuliaVyse I'm surprised by this. I thought all the new stuff was in the new interface to force power users over. #ppcchat
Q4: What are you doing to get ready for it? #ppcchat
A3: I would guess it happens sometime in the 30 days after Labor Day. If it ends up switching in October they missed their deadlines. #ppcchat
@_GilHong @JuliaVyse That's one way to do it.
Q3: Shifting gears, AdWords announced the old interface will be gone by the end of the year, but won't mess with the holiday season. When do you see it happening? #ppcchat
Great visual! #ppcchat https://t.co/z7B0XCsWKR
@pateast We've put 12 men on the moon, so you could be right.
A2: Amazon is a terrifying competitor and I think they'll light a fire under Google, Facebook, Criteo, etc. to do better. I will definitely give it a whirl when it comes out. #ppcchat
@JonKagan @NaciVela I wouldn't have been so harsh, but it has loooooooooots of room for improvement.
Q2: Did you see @PPCKirk's tweet about Amazon remarketing? https://t.co/0HxVRjmRTu This could be huge. Thoughts? Would this get you to jump on the Amazon bandwagon? #ppcchat
@JonKagan I've had a similar issue with volume. Even when I've found something that works great there just aren't levers to move to get more volume out of it. #ppcchat
A1: It's easy to set up and I've found the automatic targeting does way better than the keyword targeting. #ppcchat
A1: I've been doing more in Amazon this year and getting great results with sponsored products campaigns in the gardening space (seasonal, so you gotta get on it now). #ppcchat
Q1: What have you found that works on Amazon Ads? (their ad business generated $1.7B in revenue last year) Provide context around industry/product if possible. #ppcchat
@Howdy_Doughty Glad you could join!
Let's start with a quick poll since I'm curious: How many of you are using Amazon Ads in some way? #ppcchat

Welcome to #ppcchat. Today is PPC Potpourri, so we'll be talking about a lot of topics. First question in a couple minutes, but to start, please introduce yourself &amp; tell us your drink of choice on a hot day.
#ppcchat starts in 5 minutes. PPC Potpourri is the topic, so we'll cover a lot today.
@mindswanppc PPC Potpourri. Everything from Amazon Ads to the new AdWords interface.
@AndrewPPC They even put fruit in it. Awfully deceiving.
I swear Windows knows when I'm in a hurry and updates right then. Every. Time.
Today's #ppcchat topic is PPC Potpourri. I've got questions ranging from Amazon Ads to the new AdWords interface. If you've got a burning question, throw it my way.
@SEMFlem @wilcoxaj My understanding is that LI is matching every person who lists a company as their employer. Is it current employer only @wilcoxaj ?

@gabelong No. I was just giving people ideas (though I've used all of these at one time)
Great chat @ramonray but alas, I gotta run. #smallbizmatters 		Great seeing everyone!
@Shawn_Hessinger @ramonray Had to jump in after seeing all the good tweets. Good to see you as well. #smallbizmatters
A6: Your security is only as good as your weakest link, so each employee is important (or you end up with a Clinton email problem because Podesta got hacked) #smallbizmatters
@GrowMap @Lyceum @basecamp @asana @wrike @trello Any "gotchas" you found with Asana that you would point out for me?
@DreaVilleneuve @DIYMarketers Pretty sure I could walk out of my house without a shirt before walking out without my phone ;)  #smallbizmatters
@Lyceum @basecamp @asana I've been using Asana for a few weeks and I'm very impressed by it. #smallbizmatters
A5: Ignoring it (or just procrastinating). It takes time &amp; mental space which are two things SMBs are very limited on. #smallbizmatters
@ramonray Can't stay for long, but saw all the action and had to jump in. #smallbizmatters
@HeatherCooan @markkennedysem Personally, I don't want a conflict of interest so I avoid overlap anyway. If they demand it in the contract it signals they're high maintenance and into "legal" stuff. If they don't trust me to avoid the conflict of interest then the relationship isn't there. #ppcchat
A4: A good chat tool (Skype, Slack, Gchat), a shared online document repository (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive) and a project mgmt tool (Basecamp, Asana) #smallbizmatters

A8: I love quality t-shirts and quality bags (backpack or shoulder). Useful stuff like water bottles, hand sanitizer, thumb drives are great. And things for my kids at home. My daughter has a stuffed HostGator she loves. #ppcchat
A7: The informal conversations (face-to-face) that happen in/around a conference are where I get the best stuff to take home and implement. Every time. #ppcchat
A6: First reaction is breakouts all the way, but I agree with the comments about needing the change of pace/breaks of the keynote. And the quality of the keynote is important. Some get really sales-y and some are so generic they're useless. #ppcchat
I like this. #ppcchat https://t.co/uevsY6ss84
@jimbanks Adding 2 days to a conference would be hard for me personally, but I could see some attendees really digging the smaller group size &amp; emphasis on action. Especially people who don't like big crowds.
RT @SEOAware: @jimbanks Yep. Attendees are paying to learn, so teaching them is part of the responsibility of the speaker. #ppcchat
@jimbanks Never thought about it. How would the mastermind work? (I know the term, but haven't participated so don't know the mechanics)
A4: Don't let imposter syndrome stop you. Pitch what you're best at until someone takes you up on it. And maybe start with smaller local events to build some experience &amp; cred. #ppcchat
A3: Cost was the big one when I was trying to convince a boss to send me. #ppcchat
@jimbanks @ferkungamaboobo @Pubcon @affiliatesummit I've really enjoyed helping out new attendees with the @pubcon program. Having a familiar face can be huge for a 1st time attendee as well. #ppcchat
A2:		Networking - 60%	Takeaways - 30%	Get inspired - 10%	Swag is just icing on the cake.		#ppcchat
I also value the opportunity to talk to a speaker after the session to discuss my specific situation. Have gotten some great advice over the years. #ppcchat
As far as speakers, a lot of times I'll attend a session because I know the speaker is good, even if the content isn't exactly what I'm looking for. #ppcchat
@stevegibsonppc @adwords One of my big annoyances has been the columns not carrying over. Each account requires me to reset my columns for virtually every view. Now imagine the thought of doing that for every interaction you have throughout an entire day? #ppcchat

@scottcowley One day I hope that student learns that "black hat" and "white hat" are constructs of old Hollywood westerns. Oh, and that all the guys who wore black hats were still white guys.

I hope there is a team at FB working on an offline editor. Would be a godsend. #ppcchat https://t.co/jxjl6sXYhW
@jdprater @MattMasonPPC It DID take a connection to Trump's election to get people riled up. Obama rocked FB and the press gave him kudos for doing it.
A7: Facebook will quell the uprising and go back to providing an awesome advertising platform, because that's what drives the revenue and ultimately keeps the platform "free" for users. #ppcchat
@MattMasonPPC @akaEmmaLouise @jdprater @NeptuneMoon I am a chronic channel surfer on TV and radio. I almost never watch/listen to commercials.
@NeptuneMoon @jdprater I've got to believe that FB has been utilizing 3rd party data in their LAL targeting. Am I off base? #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @jdprater @timothyjjensen @andreacruz92 @ferkungamaboobo I wonder about this, because there is no way the US would go as far as GDPR even if they do choose to regulate. But if you're working in Europe anyway, why not get ahead of the curve? #ppcchat
@andreacruz92 @heroconf Count me in! Love that @heroconf hooks up the #ppcchat crowd
A4: We're putting some groundwork in place to shift budget if needed. For example, I've got my FB audiences cookied if I need to reach them via other channels down the road. #ppcchat
A3: Until the return goes down I don't have any advertisers looking to pull the plug. #ppcchat
A2: My clients have been generally aware that FB was in the news, but didn't know specifics (which is part of the problem; people don't know specifically how their data was being used/shared in the first place). #ppcchat

@mcgregor212 @_GilHong The ad suggestions will still be generated if you opt out. You'll be able to see them in the Recommendations area and can apply, edit or dismiss them. We'll see what Google comes up with. If they're good I'll use them.
@michellemsem Every time I go into the new AdWords experience I know I'll probably have to customize my columns about 5 times since literally every view has it's own setting.
@Matt_Umbro Pretty sure it was Iron Works. Also pretty sure I'm going back this year. That BBQ was delicious. Who wants to come? #ppcchat

Awesome chat everyone! Thanks for hosting @PPCKirk! Sorry I had to duck out a few minutes early.
@armondhammer @PPCHartman I've had a lot of luck with n-gram analysis. You find that question writers are peculiar. Phrases like "for example" or "give examples" pop out as do typical question phrases like "how much does". #ppcchat
@JeremyKrantz @PPCKirk It pains me to have to type TOFU. Hate the stuff.
@chezlars @BrookeOsmundson @nataliebarreda I love when they have call tracking and I can listen to calls. Some phone calls get answered by people who come across as salty/combative/moody and that will kill any previous effort no matter how good.
A4: If you go TOFU with keywords, you need to spend as much time on negative KW research since intent gets more fuzzy as you move up the funnel. #ppcchat 		Gotta get rid of kids searching for homework answers ;)
@nataliebarreda I think it's because in-house people are more focused. One "client" vs many allows you to go deeper. And most in-house people are interacting with the entire mktg team and probably sales too (like @BrookeOsmundson said) #ppcchat
And everyone who carried the baton wins, not just the person who crosses the finish line. #ppcchat https://t.co/lQm2emilCd
A2: I think in-house PPC people are doing better than agency-side, but overall it's an area of improvement for virtually everyone. #ppcchat
You've got to give us more time for a big ol' question like that @PPCKirk #ppcchat
A1: In one tweet? Tough question but here goes: Paying attention to users at any stage of the process from interest all the way to closed customer and marketing to them accordingly. #ppcchat
@SEMFlem @AzeemPPC I like hot teams and Michigan was on a roll coming out of their conference tourney. I've kept my eye out for them since Uconn and Kemba Walker a few years back.
For only the 2nd time in my life, I've won a March Madness bracket pool. Great effort from @AzeemPPC. Michigan winning in the Final Four gave me the edge. My final score prediction on Nova/Mich was 78-67. Only 6 total points off. Until next year #ppcchat https://t.co/1FsETwdJns

@markkennedysem Thanks for hosting! Great #ppcchat in the books.
A10: Testing ad extensions is virtually impossible because you have so little control over when, where and even if they show. The reporting also doesn't help much. Am I being too negative? #ppcchat
A8: This is my philosophy as well. And I usually have my CTA in the ad since I don't know if any ad extensions will show at all and the CTA is important. #ppcchat https://t.co/RZ58ZDdYXa
A7: The biggest benefit of ad extensions is the QS boost (or lack of penalty) that you get. Google wants them and has dictated the incentives accordingly. It's up to advertisers to utilize them for benefit in their situations. #ppcchat
A6: If calls are the goal, then Call Extensions. If long, considered purchase, then Sitelinks &amp; Callout Extensions. If you have an app, then App Extensions. Goals determine which are most effective. #ppcchat
A4: I'm avoiding them like a plague. Opted out. The English language is far too nuanced to trust to machines/automation/minimum wage employees with no background understanding of the company or product. #ppcchat
A3: Most of the time I'm using "Rotate indefinitely" (though Google doesn't seem to take it very seriously) and have 2 ads in rotation. For some high volume ad groups I'll work in a 3rd. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse If I just wanted to have lots of seemingly worthless letters in words I'd just use French.
@mitchellbwright @asana How does Wunderlist handle recurring tasks? Like something that happens every 4th Tuesday of the month?
A2: I still find the "perfect" copy with one too many characters all too often. But for descriptions I often find 10-15 characters unused. With the 2 headlines &amp; extensions I just don't need it. #ppcchat
A1: At this point, only a handful of STAs are still hanging on. #ppcchat
I'm here. #ppcchat
@BrookeOsmundson @asana Okay. Makes sense.
@BrookeOsmundson @asana I'm using it as a way to organize/manage the various tasks associated with my PPC clients. 		Also using it to keep me on top of biz dev, blogging, invoicing, etc. for running the business.
@mitchellbwright @asana I read Getting Things Done last year and totally agree. Trying to get it more into practice.		What's your method?
@BrookeOsmundson @asana Thank you for the vote of confidence &amp; any other tips you remember are appreciated.
@BrookeOsmundson @asana When a task recurs, does it keep the comments/thread? Or do you lose that stuff?
So I'm trying out @asana to get myself more organized. Two observations:		1. I'm amazed at the amount of stuff I've been "managing" through memory. Kudos to the human brain. 		2. Any Asana users out there have tips for me?

A8: I'm helping a business get PPC right for the first time ever and even basic stuff produces awesome results and is really helping grow their business. Very rewarding. #ppcchat
@mcgregor212 There is lots of potential to leverage new audiences when you capture more info. Would be interested to hear more as you get deeper into it. #ppcchat
Big thank you to everyone for participating. Feel free to keep chatting, but if you've got to take off it's okay. Tune in next week for a discussion about attribution! #ppcchat
@PPCJedi @SEMFlem My guy is in Home &amp; Garden. We use custom audience &amp; lookalikes of that audience. We promote pins of top sellers.
Last question. Feel free to toot your own horns here:		Q8: What is the coolest thing you're doing with social PPC right now? (can be big, small, crazy or simple) #ppcchat
@SEMFlem I've also got a client where we're getting more and more out of Pinterest. #ppcchat
@nikechik Thanks for joining today!
Q7: Which social PPC platform do you think is currently being underutilized? Why? #ppcchat
@PeterThistle For big brands, this is a major concern. Especially with the polarization of content on the web right now. #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen @MattMasonPPC LinkedIn has this problem too. Like how are they translating job titles into seniority? What is the threshold for putting a company/employee into a certain industry? #ppcchat

@MattMasonPPC Like FB dynamic ads not telling you which "flavor" is the winner? #ppcchat
A6: The privacy concerns are very real and data is being handled carelessly by many services right now. The EU is leading this charge, but I see this becoming a bigger issue that will limit advertisers more and more. #ppcchat
Going back to all platforms.		Q6: What concerns do you have about social PPC in the future? (esp. with the current FB situation) #ppcchat
Yes. Yes. Yes. #ppcchat https://t.co/lg6zzxqo3F
Time to dream!		Q5: If you could prioritize 1 feature for the @FacebookAds team, what would it be? Why? #ppcchat
I like this. #ppcchat https://t.co/SM8UCr836E
@timmhalloran Can you imagine if FB and Google could have become friends back in the day? Match up search intent with all the social signals? They'd probably have gotten broken up like AT&amp;T. #ppcchat
@SEMFlem @MattMasonPPC Given that Facebook is getting into job postings, I can't see them getting rid of job titles entirely. It brings in lots of B2B ad dollars.
Q4: Where do you see Facebook PPC struggle? #ppcchat
@MattMasonPPC @SEMFlem Same. Fewer available.
A3: Love Lookalikes for audiences I've created via engagement. #ppcchat
A3: I find that I can get away with more general targeting (interests, etc.) by using more negative audiences to weed out junk (@Aimclear shared some good ones at #Pubcon Austin, like people who are into freebies and people who primarily use cash) #ppcchat
@MattMasonPPC How does your time split by platform/channel right now? #ppcchat
Here's your cue #FBAdsChat peeps! https://t.co/o14ANsOFod
Q3: What targeting option(s) are you having the most luck with on @FacebookAds? #ppcchat
Hearing a lot about Facebook (obviously) so let's go down that rabbit hole a little. #ppcchat
A2.1: Social PPC gives my startup client a chance to find the right people BEFORE they start doing searches. #ppcchat
@mcgregor212 You could say that's a problem too though. Having "everyone" available makes targeting so much more vital. #ppcchat
Q2.1: Why do you think social PPC is doing so well for you? #ppcchat
@AndrewAllenVT It's a lot of similar skills, but you'll need people with more design chops to handle creative. The analysis skills are still key. #ppcchat
@SEMFlem True. I understand it helps keep the riff-raff out, but it's a hurdle that trips up a lot of campaigns. #ppcchat
A2: For my B2B startup on a limited budget we have a lot of success with layering seniority, skills, etc. in LI to generate leads for the sales team. Very niche service with low search volume. #ppcchat
Q2: Where are you seeing success with social PPC? (if you could, share channel, industry &amp; approximate budget size) #ppcchat
@SEMFlem Steep by the sound of it ;) #ppcchat
A1: I'm doing quite a bit with social, but it's still only about 33% of my time. #ppcchat
Q1: Are you are actively managing social PPC campaigns right now? If yes, what percentage of your time is social PPC vs. traditional PPC? #ppcchat
@AndrewAllenVT @timothyjjensen Nice! #ppcchat

@NeptuneMoon @JuliaVyse I'm usually more ad hoc about it. More a stylistic preference.
@JuliaVyse And a lot of the time I really want to test it too. I like finding new things that improve results. #ppcchat

A1: Conveying complexity in simple ways. #ppcchat
Hey everyone! Glad to be here this morning. #ppcchat
@iGoByDoc What days does it NOT drive you up the wall?
@PPCJoeC @adwords Does "resolved" mean it's actually helping?
@PPCKirk Every tween and teenager knows that you never do low angle. But this may explain the proliferation of beards. They're double-chin concealers.
@MattMasonPPC @AkvileDeFazio @jdprater @SusanEDub Would that need to be the actual conversion event or all pixel events (i.e. PageView, AddToCart, etc.)? #FBadschat
@MattMasonPPC @AkvileDeFazio Okay, so I'm not going crazy. And is there a published source on that? #fbadschat

What is the recommended number of conversions/actions for Facebook auto bidding to work optimally? 100/week? I read something and can't find it now. #fbadschat
Happy Birthday @bigalittlea!
Quick question for #fbadschat or #ppcchat How much do you use manual bidding in Facebook? Take this quick poll:
@ShaunKing But are we angry enough to reach out to loners in our schools? Our neighborhoods? To help them feel loved &amp; included. You don't have to wait for Election Day to start helping.
@bonpogorelc @PPCHartman @heroconf But.....barbeque!
@rudygobert27 What are you talking about? He's open.
@mcgregor212 @PPCKirk @adwords They should send him a mini-fridge for putting together this A-list focus group. Or a Google bike. #partnerrewards
@PPCKirk @adwords Give the Auction Insights its own tab in the Keywords section so I don't have to click "Search Terms" twice to see them. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk @adwords Bring columns over from the old interface. Huge time suck to redo them all in the new interface...for every account...when you have many. #ppcchat
A7: It took AdWords far too long to include a total row for filtered items (but it's there now) #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse Trust me, they won't accidentally change the model. It's not intuitive at all even if you want to. Go ahead and try. I'll wait. #ppcchat
A6: But seriously, no Display Planner link? And the Keyword Planner link takes you into the old interface. #ppcchat
A6: Dang. Instinctively clicked back to the old interface. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk HHI was in a dumb place before, but that's because the data is based on Census data by zip code. #ppcchat
Hey, don't skip Keywords! I have a serious beef with needing to click "Search Terms" twice to see my search terms. Give Audience Insights its own tab. #ppcchat
A4: Associations are awesome for extensions and make things easier...AFTER you get them all reconfigured. It was such a paradigm shift. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk The Promotions extensions is fabulous. Everyone should try it. #ppcchat
A4: With columns, I think that anytime CTR is displayed you should see Avg Position too (since they're very related) but Avg Position isn't a default column. #ppcchat
A4: The default view of "All extensions" is not helpful. Too busy and cluttered. #ppcchat
@Mel66 It's okay to be grumpy. The people at @adwords need to hear this from people who are in there every day. #ppcchat
@mcgregor212 I get the same feeling. Almost too clean.
A3: I don't like that they couldn't carry over the columns from the old interface. Doesn't seem like a hard thing to do &amp; would have really helped ease people into the new interface better. #ppcchat
The Opportunities tab has been getting much better over the past few months. There are some good suggestions in there for most accounts. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk There are actually some Opportunities that only show in the new interface. And they're more organized too in the new interface by categories. #ppcchat

@Mel66 @adwords They should send us all gifts for participating in the focus group. I've had my eye on that hoodie in the Partner Rewards store. #hinthint
A2: Lots of great thinking behind the Overview area. Some data visualization that I like. #ppcchat
@MarkIrvine89 Do you find the scannability (esp. for search terms) to be equal to the old interface? Maybe it's my eyes, but I lose track of where I'm at with all the cleanness. #ppcchat
A1: They should have put a big "Beta" label on it &amp; pushed it a little more conservatively. #ppcchat

@ToeKnee_C @heroconf They've got a couple HeroConf tickets left at $1250, but that deal ends tomorrow or Wednesday. FYI
@ToeKnee_C You should look at @HeroConf in April (https://t.co/A5AoeeXSYh) Several sessions that fit what you're looking for. Also, #SMX Advanced in June would be a good fit with what you're describing.
@ToeKnee_C What is your skill level, industry, and what are you trying to learn/master?
@PPCKirk Maybe I should change my LinkedIn to say something like "Premier non-former Google employee"
Would love to get better at this. Looking forward to it. #ppcchat https://t.co/xZf5l5YNIj
@PPCKirk @_ericm I think they've got @michellemsem lined up for May 16th at SLCSEM so it will be more of a PPC focus that month.

@AnnaCaseM I've known companies to assign unique identifiers there and match to any number of targeting criteria using VLOOKUP or such. Keeps potentially valuable info away from prying eyes. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk You got an FJ? Nice!
A8: The faster you learn &amp; master change, the better off you'll be in your job &amp; career. It's the ultimate job security. #ppcchat
A7: Depends on how much data the account can accrue to demonstrate the effect. Never shorter than a month though. #ppcchat

@AkvileDeFazio Love Little Cottonwood Canyon, Snowbird or Alta will do. Up in Idaho I hit Grand Targhee most of the time. Just on the other side of the mountains from Jackson Hole, but I can vouch for Jackson Hole. Epic terrain.
A3: I always let the client know. Be very upfront that I'll be gathering info &amp; researching for action plan. That way they don't worry because I've got it. #ppcchat
@mcgregor212 Had a campaign go 2X yesterday. Really throws things off. #ppcchat
@AkvileDeFazio I've never ventured even as far as Colorado. Just too easy to find amazing snow locally. Where is your favorite place to ride?

@PPCKirk @jessesem Purple is taking over everything
Good sports analogy. Do you draft and develop or pay for a proven free agent? #slcsem
@PPCKirk @jessesem You could split the difference and come to Idaho!
@jessesem Love Utah, but Idaho has me hooked as the place to live.
@IamCoy I put a lot of time/effort into my own education but it seems like the onus is heavily on employees/candidates but not on companies.
Seems like more education/training is needed. Not just recruiting perfectly qualified people (unicorns) #slcsem
So there is a talent gap and not enough people to fill open positions. What is being done to train people? #slcsem
@scottcowley @iGoByDoc It's a full house. #slcsem

A8: For me it's calendar reminders to go check on things at set intervals. #ppcchat #lowtech
@timmhalloran @NeptuneMoon @PPCKirk I know. Shouldn't psychics be the hardest industry in PPC?
@akaEmmaLouise Don't worry about being late. Glad you could join.
Naturally...		Q8: What safeguards do you have in place to monitor your automation? (and avoid a SkyNet or Hawaii missile alarm situation) #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @PPCKirk If someone says they've got their attribution nailed, they're a liar. #ppcchat
A7: Reporting that a human doesn't look at before the client sees it. #ppcchat
Now a more fun question...		Q7: What is the most "dangerous" automation? Why? #ppcchat
A6: I've found the logic of being proactive vs reactive is usually well received. Automation is coming if we like it or not. #ppcchat
Q6: How do you get buy-in, either internally or with clients, for testing automation? Or are you just going for it? #ppcchat
@armondhammer That would make a great LinkedIn title: Master of Black Boxes #ppcchat
Yes. This. I'm also hoping for some help on audience creation/management. #ppcchat https://t.co/kP0nggUoRn
Really good point #ppcchat https://t.co/ToC3dYjQV4
Q5: What automation do you think has the most potential in 2018? #ppcchat
A4: Kind of niche, but I've been using Maximize Conversions in an AdWords Grants account (since it can exceed $2 bid) and it has not impressed despite good volume &amp; data in the campaigns. #ppcchat
Q4: On the flip side, what automation has been the biggest disappointment to you? Why? #ppcchat
@PPCKirk I'm with you. You need analysis and narrative to do with that data in the reports. #ppcchat
Q3.1 Seeing a lot of budget answers. Is this do to AdWords getting a little loose with budgets recently? #ppcchat
@duanebrown @KurtHenninger I liken it to weeding a garden. It sucks. Nobody wants to do it, but results vary significantly depending on how diligently and how well you do it. #ppcchat
@LukeAlley @SusanEDub @BryantGarvin @slcsem @wilcoxaj @Matt_Siltala Keep me in the loop if that happens. I can usually make it down there by lunchtime.
@KurtHenninger @duanebrown I love n-gram analysis. Helps SOOOO much. #ppcchat
@clickyricky @_GilHong Keeping people in the loop is important. #ppcchat
Q3: What is the biggest gain (in efficiency, dollars, etc.) that you have seen with the adoption of automation? What was the automation? #ppcchat
@MarkIrvine89 Seasonality or time of day/week. #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen @PPCKirk @Optmyzr I'm warming up to the Opportunities suggestions inside AdWords. They're getting much better lately. More though behind them. Actually helpful. #ppcchat
Looks like bidding is winning, but I should have put "All of the above" it seems #ppcchat
@PPCKirk @SusanEDub @slcsem @wilcoxaj @LukeAlley @BryantGarvin @Matt_Siltala @heroconf I'll be at Pubcon Austin, SMX West and HeroConf this spring.
Q2: POLL: In what areas are you already using automation? #ppcchat
@SusanEDub @slcsem @wilcoxaj @LukeAlley @BryantGarvin @Matt_Siltala I'll get working on my schedule now so I can make sure I get there.
@nataliebarreda @point_it If you didn't see, @armondhammer said his favorite dessert is wine. #ppcchat
Q1.1: Are some features/tools/etc. more semi-automated? Which do you categorize this way? #ppcchat
@MilwaukeePPC Glad you could join.
@BloombergEric @DialogTech @QuartinoChicago Welcome to #ppcchat
@PPCKirk How right you are. Fruit is not dessert until paired with copious amounts of sugar and/or chocolate.
Q1: What features/tools/etc. do you consider to be automation?  #ppcchat
Welcome everyone to #ppcchat. Lots to discuss, so let's get things going.
We'll get started here in a couple minutes. Feel free to introduce yourself. Tell us your name, where you work, your favorite dessert. You know, the important stuff. #ppcchat

Next week for #ppcchat we'll be talking about PPC Automation: When to use it &amp; how to control it. I'll host. Would love to have you all.
A10: Multivariate sounds awesome and sexy, but if they don't have the traffic it's a huge waste. #ppcchat
@JuliaVyse @mcgregor212 @elanaleoni @Mel66 @Adalysis @unbounce CTAConf isn't on my radar. Details?
@elanaleoni @Mel66 For ad testing, a tool like @Adalysis is great. For LPs you can use platforms like @unbounce. #ppcchat
A2: Constantly. The number of tests depends on amount of traffic/data. Small budgets are much slower than bigger budgets. #ppcchat
@PPCJedi @LukeAlley That's legit. @LukeAlley owes you.
@JuliaVyse @nataliebarreda Do you have smaller hands or is that cup enormous?
@elanaleoni Depends on how much traffic you have to work with. Multivariate needs lots of data to validate. #ppcchat
@elanaleoni Don't be afraid to chime in. Everybody is nice here. #ppcchat
A1: Same here. Start closest to the conversion and work your way back. #ppcchat https://t.co/LrAvWZNf5o
@nataliebarreda Beware! @nataliebarreda and coffee are a dangerous combo. #ppcchat
@lchasse New quarter, new quotas.
Hey @_GilHong Happy Birthday!
@John_A_Lee @AndrewPPC @PPCKirk Nailed it!
@AndrewPPC @PPCKirk I feel this should be a GIF with googly eyes on something. #ppcchat
@PPCKirk You should hit up @FrancesDR @John_A_Lee or @purnavirji to see if Bing has some they could give you
@isaacrudansky 2017 huh?
Great list for you #PPC folks. Have a Happy New Year! https://t.co/euhbZYVPub
@peeplaja @annatalerico Preach brother!
@tedives @ClixMarketing Glad it helped. I know I've got work ahead of me too.
A6: If faced with a suspended account, anything is better than nothing, which is what AdWords is banking on IMO. But for some nonprofits that don't have a lot of time/resources to manage it, Express could be a better option for them. #ppcchat
@JonKagan @LukeAlley You can't believe how excited the nonprofits were when I told them the news. #iwantmy2dollars #ppcchat
@LukeAlley @JonKagan I have a hard time believing that they won't factor it in. Letting Grants accounts outrank paying customers is bad business. #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @ryanleecox That's in regard to Grants accounts that allow international targeting even though they're obviously US-based (or similar situations). #ppcchat
@JonKagan @LukeAlley There was a time when the bid cap was $1. They doubled it to $2 at the same time they said that any paying customer would outrank a Grants account, no matter the bid. #ppcchat
A5: Some keywords are just going to get deleted. #ppcchat		And there is still a chance to get matched on single-word queries because of exact-ish match.
@ferkungamaboobo I find that many Grant accounts end up targeting informational queries (less competition to outrank them) and with Google's answer box providing the answer on the SERP, it kills the chance for a Grants ad click. #rockandhardplace #ppcchat
@LukeAlley We shall see. The campaigns I switched to Maximize Conversions have GA-imported goals being included. #ppcchat
I've got a Grants account that utilizes imported goals from Analytics. Was easier than getting them to paste code snippets on thank you pages. #ppcchat
@LukeAlley Hasn't even been 24 hours #ppcchat 		I'll post findings somewhere and drop it here in a couple days.
A3: Already switched a couple campaigns over to see if I can get CTR to increase before Jan. 1 #ppcchat
@brettburky Yes sir.
@JuliaVyse @ryanleecox @LukeAlley Being totally cynical, I wonder if reduced corporate tax rate in future means they don't need as much charitable deductions (aka write-offs) from these Grants accounts anymore. #ppcchat
A2: Have to keep a closer eye on QS of new keywords. Probably gonna need a script to kill keywords if QS drops below 2. #ppcchat
@ferkungamaboobo @Realicity I understand the CTR thing, but when any paying customer outranks you and your average positions are 3+ it's hard to do 5% even for a home-run keyword for the nonprofit. #ppcchat
Q1.1 Anyone here actually work on a Grants account with over 5% CTR account-wide? #ppcchat 		Google says 5% is below the program average.
A1) The short time frame between announcement and enforcement. #ppcchat
Hey everyone! #ppcchat
@GinnyMarvin Enjoy the break! Merry Christmas.
RT @NeptuneMoon: My thoughts on the Google Grants changes announced last week "Google AdWords Grants - What Will Happen Next?" https://t.co…
@NeptuneMoon @GinnyMarvin I worked with a non-profit that used both AdWords Express and a regular account for their Grant. I was sorely disappointed by the results in Express then and wouldn't bet on better results now. And at the time Express maxed out at a 50 mile radius on targeting.
@PPCKirk I'm just giving you a hard time. If you are still wearing them in a month let me know. I may have some Christmas money to spend by then.
@PPCKirk You a Felix Gray affiliate or something?
@timothyjjensen @Mel66 @MarkRoll32 I'm with @timothyjjensen No dice.
@bigalittlea You'd better have an extremely high tolerance for risk.
@GinnyMarvin You know anyone at @adwords that I could talk to about this? I have some ideas of how they might adjust this (timeline and standards)
RT @sengineland: Google Ad Grants policy changes include 5% CTR minimum, up from 1% by @ginnymarvin https://t.co/o0dzNzEgnl
RT @GooglebAdWords: Let’s just make a start screwing over google grant advertisers just before Xmas. https://t.co/ACO5c8xfhl	#evil #scrooge…
@jstatad @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo I know right? Merry Christmas nonprofits!
@NeptuneMoon @keithaldrich @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo @adwords The only way to make this worse would be to push these nonprofits into AdWords Express. Like Donald Trump level making it worse.
@NeptuneMoon @keithaldrich @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo I'm just disappointed that @adwords is doing this to nonprofits. The standard is incredibly high &amp; the timeline is far too fast. If they really needed to clean up Grants accounts there are better ways to handle it.
@jdb426 @NeptuneMoon It's like they tried to slide it past people while everyone was paying attention to net neutrality vote.
@keithaldrich @ferkungamaboobo @markkennedysem And thus allowing Google to 1) have more control over everything and 2) give nonprofits their $10K but give them much less traffic in return.
@keithaldrich @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo And they won't know it until they get suspended. That's the worst part.
@duanebrown @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo This is really bad news for a lot of nonprofits
If you have Google Grants clients you need to read this - https://t.co/O04gJn2Di3		#ppcchat		Starting Jan. 1:	- CTR must be 5%+	- No KWs below QS 2 	- No single-word KWs	- You can go over $2 bid if using "Maximize conversions"		CC: @markkennedysem @ferkungamaboobo

@heyglenns I support this! #ppcchat
A3: Would like to see @BingAds get @LinkedInMktg demographic targeting in place as audience layer. Would be dope. #ppcchat
@heidiehammond They're in too deep to scratch it, but I'm not seeing the issues getting fixed which is concerning. #ppcchat

Thank you for the great chat @MetLife @smallbiztrends @Rieva and @SusanSolovic! #MetLifeSmallBiz
A5: The economy is so much more global now. Events anywhere in the world can affect your customers and business. #MetLifeSmallBiz
@DIYMarketers @MetLife With health care going up and up in cost, that is becoming a much bigger benefit too. #MetLifeSmallBiz
A3: Find people who share your vision &amp; passion from day 1. #MetLifeSmallBiz
@SusanSolovic @bhannan And people say things much more harsh on social media than they might face-to-face. #MetLifeSmallBiz
@Lyceum @AmexOPEN Better include a link to it.
@Lyceum Immigration is tricky because of social program costs, taxes, etc. The free market part is happening because of the internet. #MetLifeSmallBiz
@Lyceum I think it's becoming easier to utilize talent outside your local area, but many SMBs still need employees at the business physically. #MetLifeSmallBiz
A2: Tough to find employees with the right qualifications and after you train them they become really appealing to bigger businesses. Tough for SMBs. #MetLifeSmallBiz
Amen. #MetLifeSmallBiz https://t.co/uBFyZrX8y0
@smallbiztrends @DIYMarketers @Rieva @MetLife Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If the basics aren't covered they can't excel in their work/passion (hopefully the same). #MetLifeSmallBiz

@ryanleecox My use cases are all B2B. The high CPCs keep most B2C stuff out I've experienced
@JuliaVyse @markkennedysem Top-of-funnel &amp; informational stuff does well because people browse on mobile. Can actually get C-level people with defenses down. #ppcchat
@ryanleecox LI is incredibly limited in many ways. What specifically are you thinking?
A3.1 LinkedIn campaigns actually have lots less competition &amp; new year is good time to job search so LI good there too. #ppcchat
@markkennedysem Probably, but clients hate seeing old year keywords in their accounts. #ppcchat
A1: Also search your keywords for "2017" and update with new "2018" variants (not sure how AdWords variants work there) #ppcchat
A1: Do an extra pass to make sure all your holiday-related or year-end ads are off. #ppcchat
A2: User mindset is so different between LI &amp; FB. Gotta look at your customers &amp; assess where best to reach them. #FBAdsChat
A1: Usually pose as test. Then track &amp; let the effort justify more budget. #FBAdsChat

@timmhalloran I don't expect them to match, but the difference was so large it was startling.
@timmhalloran Literally overcounted. Conversion in FB was signup for contest. Database numbers with FB as source were 55% of FB reported "Results".
@SusanEDub Some go with GA. Others use their CRM (Hubspot) as final source of truth. #FBAdsChat
A3: My experience is that FB overcounts pretty aggressively. Like 55% discount of FB numbers aggressive. #FBAdsChat
@Gil_RunDMG @SusanEDub Do you have a customer list to upload for lookalike audiences? #FBAdsChat
@timmhalloran What's the most common objection for you? #FBAdsChat
@ferkungamaboobo Out of curiosity, how many fields are you asking for? #FBAdsChat
@timmhalloran Integrating directly (which I would include Zapier) is the way to go. #FBAdsChat
Q1: Are you using FB Lead Ads? If yes, how are they doing? If no, why not? #FBAdsChat
@LukeAlley It was a money grab. Big conferences like Dreamforce were the real target.

@michellemsem @Justin_Freid @BingAds I'm pretty sure the Bing color is teal.
@Justin_Freid @BingAds Just another reminder that I haven't made it yet. (but that's pretty cool)
@SusanEDub Somebody wore out the refresh button on that page.
@PPCKirk I got a hater too. Should have been more explicit in pulling out principles so agency experiences I shared could be equated to in-house.
@MilwaukeePPC @adwords I've also seen good results.
@MilwaukeePPC @adwords They took it out of beta. Pushing system-wide.
@stevegibsonppc @elevatedmrktng @timothyjjensen @rachelking237 And they wonder why I keep looking for a plumber/HVAC/electrician in one city while having an IP consistently in another state.
@rachelking237 @LukeAlley @NeptuneMoon Even with the high ticket prices they likely were going to lose money (even if it worked out). Wasn't exclusive enough. (40K people)
@elevatedmrktng @stevegibsonppc @timothyjjensen @rachelking237 Can't imagine what someone would think of my browser history ;) What a discombobulated mess.
A7: It's a business decision. Neutral. #ppcchat
@Mel66 @PPCKirk @NeptuneMoon Should have guessed health care. That industry is cray cray on the regulations. #ppcchat
@rachelking237 @LukeAlley @NeptuneMoon The lack of logistics was mind-boggling.
A3: Two words: readability &amp; scannability. People read differently now. #SmallBusinessWeek
@Mel66 I'm surprised they thought it so prevalent. Tech-related industry? #ppcchat
@stevegibsonppc @timothyjjensen @rachelking237 My Google info is clouded by my occupation. Lots of research. FB likely "cleaner" but we may be outliers. #ppcchat
@NeptuneMoon @LukeAlley And after the Fyre Festival debacle, the hammer is coming down hard. #influencers #ppcchat
@smallbiztrends Definitely a 2 monitor guy, though it's 80/20 on usage. Main monitor is centered #SmallBusinessWeek
@LukeAlley FTC could issue very clear language on influencer posts &amp; blockers could filter based on it. #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen @JasonJBDenny @stevegibsonppc @rachelking237 And who you target, because much of the Audience Network is mobile. #ppcchat
@heyglenns To some extent QS already does this. Ad must be relevant enough or Google just won't show any ads (incl. search) #ppcchat
@timothyjjensen @rachelking237 They wouldn't risk an anti-trust lawsuit (i.e. Windows and Netscape). #ppcchat

@jasonpoole Double the campaigns means double the work, reporting, etc. That's a cost to consider as well.
@jasonpoole If you need budgetary control of mobile, yes, split them. But with bid modifiers &amp; mobile URLs you have control in same campaign
@jasonpoole Most of them will be tom-a-to vs. tom-ah-to type posts. The question is if your customers behave differently on mobile/desktop

@Stu_Draper I know right? How do you get people to not bid on your brand name?
