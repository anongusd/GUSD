There's one main reason why they were swept (via @NoahYingling) https://t.co/5u2zfLsHHP
@TaylorHenry9 True.  Most closers do.
@TaylorHenry9 Possibly.  I agree with Davis in the 9th but kinda expected the results since he hadn‚Äôt thrown.  Might be different if up one.
@TaylorHenry9 I see it but you have to win two anyway and Marquez has thrown well too. If he hadn‚Äôt been, would agree more.  Not scoring makes everything moot. Looking at the season, most of the losing skids were due to hitting, not pitching.
@TaylorHenry9 Using Desmond set this team back for the future as well
@TaylorHenry9 What happens with Rogers?  Why didn‚Äôt he get a September call up?
@TaylorHenry9 McMahon has totally been screwed by this situation.  Stunting his growth
@TaylorHenry9 Oh but he‚Äôs a great clubhouse guy
@TaylorHenry9 Exactly. How many HR has Desmond hit the last 2 months.  Plus he‚Äôs not a great defender.

RT @SethDavisHoops: Not only dropping TCU out of the top 4 but down to 6? No logical argument whatsoever. None.
@TaylorHenry9 Bad thing for BXII is Baylor win and impressive OSU win probably moves TCU to 5 or 6.
@TaylorHenry9 OSU was impressive enough up 52. No dog in the fight here. Just a CFB fan. 8 teams might be best.
@TaylorHenry9 I don't disagree with you on that but it's just bad form. Crappy system that we are stuck with.
TCU up 52 with 5 minutes left kneels on the ball. OSU in similar situation spreads it out and runs it in. #CLASS

fav lyndipie7		What up.
Rain sucks!
sitting at hooters drinking a few adult beverages
Rough tournament in Arkansas, back to work this week.  We will hit better, tighten the defense up and we will be successful.
Great tournament from the girls!  Let's build from it.
Great weather for practice.  Getting some optional BP in tonight, weather permitting.
Updated practice schedule will be posted if rain comes.
Practice today, weather coming in, can we survive another rainout?
Work is dragging, need to get the day over and move on to softball!
Tournament again this weekend, Saturday at 8 AM first game, be there at 7:15.  Fingers crossed for the weather.
Tournament has been officially moved.  We will practice Wednesday 6 PM NW.
Have heard through other sources that the tournament was moved indoors.  We have pulled out if that is the case.
I know this is the rainy season, but sheesh!
Rainy day in doo dah.  Depressing.
Blaster Bash completed for 2009.  Many games completed, a few rained out.  Great tournament, other than the weather.
One day until the Blaster Bash, 56 games in two days, are you ready?
Blaster Bash this weekend, are you coming?
