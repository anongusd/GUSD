@PhilosophicalW @james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC @senatemajldr So left isn‚Äôt left, Bill Clinton is the destroyer the American political system that has been sliding right for 50 years. Got it.
@PhilosophicalW @james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC @senatemajldr It‚Äôs better to fight for what you believe, a combination of liberal and conservative ideas coming together, compromising for a better America.  Not putting party before the people just to earn political wins. Go extreme left, conservatives will win elections for a long time.
@PhilosophicalW @james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC @senatemajldr You do not make many proper assessments; I am not a Democrat.  You are more than somewhat of a socialist, you are a socialist.    But, not all socialist theories are bad.  It‚Äôs very nice to know that Kennedy was President last time you respected American politics.
@PhilosophicalW @james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC @senatemajldr You are ridiculous with your off the wall assessment. There is a spectrum however you are an extremist.  All conservative economic theories are not wrong just as all liberal are not right.  You appear to believe that anything left of center is pure socialism.
@PhilosophicalW @james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC Guess you‚Äôre an expert.  Bet you have a bigger diploma than I do.  You must have went to the @senatemajldr school of politics...party over people.

@james7coffey @justinbaragona @ChrisLoesch @AOC That‚Äôs the problem.  The right has gone extreme right.   The left has responded by moving to the extreme left.  Two useless parties that represent a very small percentage of the American people who for the most part are just right or left of center.
@justinbaragona @AOC I also hope the Democratic Party moves closer to center.  We really do not need two useless extremist parties.

@cravennewworld @mollylyons @MrDane1982 Extr. left wing is not practical.  Ideas are not bad in theory, could work in larger cities.

@brithume I wonder how the GOP would have responded if a Democrat refused to step down from overseeing their own election and narrowly won? Guarantee they wouldn‚Äôt take the L graciously.
@mollylyons @MrDane1982 I‚Äôm not going to attempt a specific rebuttal based on an entire ‚Äúmidterm campaign‚Äù. Republicans can go extreme because their base would rather have an extremist than opposition. Electoral college favors GOP, Alienating voters due to left extremist policies is a guaranteed loss.
@MrDane1982 Running hard on a far left agenda is a guaranteed way to lose an election. The right is fairly United, while the left is all over the board. Democrats cannot even agree on basic party platform.  To go far left is a way to alienate the majority of center thinking voters.
