Being tough or manly is not defined by ‚Äútoughing out‚Äù issues that seriously affect you, it‚Äôs defined by having the courage and honesty to ask for help when needed and support others when they need it.
@UnsatiatedBlood https://t.co/jnyjOSUZRs https://t.co/8dhm1XxLWU
Also 50% of suicides are via gun.
We need a serious movement to talk about Suicide in America and help men realize that talking about mental health and suicide is not only ok but encouraged for those with suicidal thoughts to talk about it and get help. But this all has to start with people talking about it.
-Having suicide prevention resources at gun shops such as pamphlets. 	- Child Acess Prevention laws	-Laws requiring that guns be kept locked and unloaded 	and more in the book.
The solution: 	-Waiting periods for all gun sales 	-Participation of Gun groups in educating gun owners on how they can have a friend babysit their gun in moments of crisis. 	-Teaching gun dealers about the warning signs of a suicidal person
In Austrailia following the National Firearms agreement there was a 74% reduction in gun suicide 		Read more about the ANFA here: https://t.co/PrXCRLY3rv
The Israeli Defense  Force had a growing problem with young male soldiers dying by suicide a couple of years ago and in response changed their policy to no longer allow soldiers to bring their guns home and saw a 40% reduction in suicide.
Another problem the book brings up is that the group that commits suicide the most (men) believe that their peers will see them as weak if they go and see a therapist or talk about suicidal thoughts. Compounding to the point that men commit suicide significantly more than women.
Their are serious problems with the mental healthcare system in America because theres a lack of therapists using evidence based treatments for suicide prevention and our current system focuses on making someone less suicidle not limiting access to methods.
One of the most common ways people attempt to die by suicide is by overdosing but 98% of people survive. While 85-90% of suicide attempts using a gun are lethal. This is important because 90% of people who survive their first attempt do not attempt again.
The book also talks about the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) basically saying, that most often for someone to develop serious thoughts of suicide they have to feel hopeless about two aspects of their life, Interpersonal connections &amp; their ability to contribute to society
In 2014 the total number of people that were murdered by any method in the US was about 21,000. That same year about 26,000 Americans died by suicide using a gun 		5,000 more people died as a result of Suicide via gun than the total number of people murdered by any method.

TL;DR: Policy change &gt; thoughts + prayers. Both Democrats and Republicans die from gun violence. Bullets don't discriminate and neither should our legislators. Let‚Äôs bring the people‚Äôs pressure to Congress and create the change this country needs to save lives.
In an average month, 50 women in the US are shot to death by intimate partners. A background check stopping domestic abusers from buying guns could have saved their lives. When a domestic abuser argues with a gun, they are 5x more likely to kill someone. https://t.co/o7gm2tncBY
And background checks work. When Connecticut adopted a background check law for handgun sales, the homicide rate dropped 40% and the suicide rate dropped 15%. https://t.co/OYyCuecEcE
If 97% of Americans agree on something, then it shouldn't matter if your representative is a Republican or a Democrat ‚Äì they should be fighting for #HR8, and we need to make sure they do.

PRINCIPLE SIX: Nonviolence believes that the universe is on the side of justice.	The nonviolent resister has deep faith that justice will eventually win.
PRINCIPLE FIVE: Nonviolence chooses love instead of hate.	Nonviolence resists violence of the spirit as well as the body.           		Nonviolent love is spontaneous, unmotivated, unselfish and creative.
PRINCIPLE FOUR: Nonviolence holds that suffering can educate and transform.	Nonviolence accepts suffering without retaliation. 		Unearned suffering is redemptive and has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities
PRINCIPLE THREE: Nonviolence seeks to defeat injustice not people.	Nonviolence recognizes that evildoers are also victims and are not evil people. 		The nonviolent resister seeks to defeat evil not people
PRINCIPLE TWO: Nonviolence seeks to win friendship and understanding.	The end result of nonviolence is redemption and reconciliation. 		The purpose of nonviolence is the creation of the Beloved Community.
PRINCIPLE ONE: Nonviolence is a way of life for courageous people.	It is active nonviolent resistance to evil. 		It is aggressive spiritually, mentally and emotionally.

This often can make the the amount of gun violence the trans community faces be reported as significantly less then it actually is. Which is horrifying because of how many hate crimes can go unreported when people are not identified as being trans.
While I was at the USCA I learned that one of the biggest issues the trans community faces when it comes to gun violence is that often times Trans people are misgendered by law enforcement, local media and even family members.
