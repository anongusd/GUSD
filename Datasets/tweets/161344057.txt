A #Halloween Treat - Congress has a chance to reform the outdated sugar program in the 2018 Farm Bill #SugarReform https://t.co/ztZZK3yeUu
US Sugar Program requires Gov't to buy surplus sugar and sell it to ethanol cos at a loss to taxpayers #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
The US Sugar Program has cost consumers and businesses at least $15 billion since 2008 #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
The U.S. sugar program was the ONLY commodity program not reformed in the last farm bill https://t.co/XFpa8i96Wb #ScaryUSSugarProgram
US consumers are paying nearly 2X as much for sugar than consumers worldwide thanks to US sugar program. #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
Happy Halloween! What's your best seasonal baked good - cookies, cakes, pies?
US Dept. of Commerce has found that for every job saved, the sugar program kills three manufacturing jobs. #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
Gov restricts the amount of US sugar processing companies can sell - artificially inflating the price #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
Frightening Figure - Since '97, &gt;125k jobs in sugar-using industries lost due to the US Sugar Program. #SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
#DYK The US sugar program costs American consumers &amp; businesses $3B/year?#SugarReform #ScaryUSSugarProgram
In honor of #Halloween we are sharing scary facts about the outdated US Sugar Program. Check out why we must reform the #ScaryUSSugarProgram
