For months we've been given the number 2,654 separated kids by the Trump administration.		Many of you have pushed us -- saying you think the number is higher. You were right. 		Administration *now* says number is 2,668 after discovering 14 new separated kids.		Keep pushing.

@southey @nhannahjones @MSNBC I‚Äôd argue my approach with those kids was exactly the same ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt debate them about why they weren‚Äôt choosing to vote, I listened to why they felt the way they felt. I didn‚Äôt go there to convince them to vote and understand why many dont.
@nhannahjones @MSNBC As far as the wall, I‚Äôve spent lots of time (majority of my airtime this year) challenging absurdity of Trump‚Äôs wall and the inhumanity of his immigration policy. But true, I didn‚Äôt choose debate her at the deli ‚Äî rarely do that. Totally fair for you to disagree with my approach.

Trump administration just floated possibility the stay on deportations of reunited families could slow down other reunifications. 		Judge wasn't having it. 		He said slowing down reunification "not an option" and "if space is an issue the government will have to make space."
Here's a key new number that just came out in court.		@HHSGov says 2,480 separated kids have been matched to parents. 		Only 71 are separated without an identified parent.
RT @AP: BREAKING: Judge temporarily halts deportation of families who were recently reunited after being separated by Trump administration.
@FarylPalles @ACLU Until then, no deportations of reunited families.
Important: At the start of this hearing, the Judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing *any* deportation of reunited families.		That came after a filing by @ACLU this morning. 		Government said they disagree, requested a week to respond. 		Judge gave them until 7/23.
Commander White describes red flags: "simple evidence of inconsistency" about family relationships, names of parents or other family &amp; who child traveled with. 		Next step would be DNA test to determine paternity or maternity and/or consulate verifiable birth certificates.
The Judge says the flow chart is "a good plan" and "a really good step." 		He's now hearing from Commander Jonathan White of HHS, who the government's lawyer says is the "architect of the reunification plan."		They're talking about "red flags" that would prevent reunification.
Judge Sabraw *again* just hit the Trump administration in court, saying its pushback to the order to reunify, made by @HHSGov Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Chris Meekins, was "exasperating to put it plainly."
Meanwhile, back at home, here's the Trump administration's flow chart plan -- filed yesterday -- to reunify the 2,551 still-separated migrant kids.

And remember. 		A DHS official told me many of the parents of separated kids like the ones who end up alone in immigration court have *already* been deported.
She told me not all kids have counsel.		They represent themselves with a "government trained attorney prosecuting them" and a "judge speaking a language they don't understand."		She says *no one* is equipped to try these cases but immigration lawyers, much less separated kids.
Just off phone with Lindsay Toczylowski of @ImmDef.		She represents that separated *three-year old* facing deportation. 		"Deportation proceedings in immigration court aren't designed for children."		No food.	No booster seats.	Must sit still though "feet don't touch the ground."

Another thing confirmed today on @HHSGov call we should be really clear about.		We were told the 522 kids reunited so far were reunited by @CBP. 		That means those kids were never handed over to HHS.		In other words, HHS may have only reunited a handful -- if any -- kids so far.

@IBStewards @DatelineNBC After the opening, it's *literally* the first thing we discuss: prevention through deterrence.
Also went over Trump talking points with Manuel Padilla, Border Patrol chief in the Rio Grande Valley.		He said separations *were* designed as a deterrence.		He also said a 300% "surge" in MS-13 members is 180 people. And they caught 187,000 total migrants last year.		#Dateline https://t.co/8xc2hOyXXe
On #Dateline last night I spoke with @SecNielsen right after zero tolerance was announced.		Defending it, she said families should declare asylum at ports of entry. I told her many get turned away.		She said spillover violence is a threat. I reminded her DEA says that's not true. https://t.co/EHAFPISgZW
This ended up on the cutting room floor of our #Dateline special. 		I met a coyote ‚Äî a human smuggler ‚Äî and asked if Trump‚Äôs wall would stop migrants. 		‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an obstacle for someone who is suffering from hunger, misery and poverty in their country.‚Äù https://t.co/pPubHbuvzG
Thanks for watching -- and sorry for the #Dateline tweetstorm.		The next chapter of this story is tent camps for migrants and indefinite detention for families.		And of course reuniting 2,053 kids still in the custody of HHS that were taken from their parents.		We won't stop.
We found Sintia this week months after meeting her in Texas.		She faces an uncertain future -- now that AG Sessions has instructed immigration judges not to consider gang violence in asylum claims.		We asked why she wants to stay here.		"To not live in fear anymore."		#Dateline https://t.co/3h0anu4j51
For the record, we requested a follow-up interview with @SecNielsen after I went inside the McAllen detention center, where I saw kids in cages.		She declined.		#Dateline
Just after the zero tolerance policy was announced, I asked @SecNielsen about family separations.		She said families should go to ports of entry.		I told her 130,000 were turned away at ports of entry over seven months, including asylum seekers.		#Dateline https://t.co/Zhv8F448Qq
Jeff Sessions called El Paso "ground zero" in the fight against MS-13 and gangs.		But when we got there -- we didn't see anything like that.		Only 100s of American kids walking across the border to school daily.		They weren't scared, at all. 		#Dateline https://t.co/2YbEpzSWgF
And violence isn't pouring in either -- as Trump says it is. 		That's exactly what the Tijuana coroner told us -- and his city is Mexico's most violent. 6 murders every single day.		20 miles away, San Diego is one of America's safest big cities. https://t.co/wbMYmYBQPF		#Dateline

Donald Trump is hardly the first president to try deterrence as a border strategy.		Bill Clinton tried it in the 1990's -- it stopped the flow of migrants -- but it also had tragic consequences.		Death rates skyrocketed.		#Dateline

On the single adult side it was noisy, detainees hollered at us as we walked through, flashing thumbs up, one shouting he was cold, some joked about food. 		On the family side ‚Äî much quieter. Eerily. Moms with kids in one cell. Dad and kids in another. And one just kids alone.
This facility is so slammed some migrants are being processed ‚Äî the point they get separated ‚Äî virtually. 		They sit in front of a *computer* and talk with agents in El Paso, El Centro or Corpus Christi to hear their fate. 		The 10 permanent processing agents aren‚Äôt enough.
There were only four contracted social workers to deal with separated kids &amp; others who need it in the processing center. 		There are 525 family members in here today. 		197 unaccompanied minors. 		John Lopez the acting deputy patrol agent in charge says they‚Äôre stretched thin.
RT @SpoxDHS: @jacobsoboroff Under the 2008 TVPRA, DHS is required by law to transfer unaccompanied alien children to HHS within 72 hours.
In terms of the facilities, migrants are detained behind large metal chain link cells. 		Mats on the floor. 		Mylar silver blankets everywhere. 		Temperature is 72 degrees.
Shockingly there are situations where a parent may be taken to court to be charged, a separation occurs, only to return the same day sentenced to ‚Äútime served‚Äù ‚Äî but their child has already been taken to another facility. 		At that point nobody knows when they‚Äôd be reunited.
55,000 square feet of this facility is for families &amp; unaccompanied minors. 		22,000 for adults.		One mother here since Friday hadn‚Äôt heard of the zero tolerance policy yet.		When a family is separated they don‚Äôt know until the last minute ‚Äî when they‚Äôre taken to processing.
Just finished our tour. 		They told us we only had 7 minutes to go through a 77,000 square-foot facility. But we stretched it out much longer.		They told us this is the biggest border patrol detention center on the southern border.		Currently total 1129 detainees.
Padilla says 1,174 kids have been separated from their parents in this sector alone since zero tolerance started.
Before our tour we are getting a press conference from Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Chief Manuel Padilla. 		He‚Äôs going through the sector talking points ‚Äî apprehensions here are higher than anywhere else. 		That‚Äôs also why this is the epicenter of separations.

Something I just told @chrislhayes: this place is a licensed child care facility with trained staff. There are 26 operated by the same nonprofit, @SouthwestKey. 		Its president told me that potential new tent cities that will be on federal property *don‚Äôt* have to be licensed.
I have been inside a federal prison and county jails. 		This place is called a shelter but these kids are incarcerated. 		No cells and no cages, and they get to go to classes about American history and watch Moana, but they‚Äôre in custody. 		Coming up on @allinwithchris next.
This mega-shelter is run by trained staff ‚Äî a nonprofit. 		I believe the worker looking after these kids who said she‚Äôd like to see a day when they don‚Äôt have to do this. 		But things are moving in the wrong direction ‚Äî capacity is 1497 and tonight 1469 boys will sleep here.
Instructions to employees in the lobby of the shelter if you encounter media:		1) ‚ÄúImmediatelt notify PD,‚Äù or the police department.  		2) Call the shelter communications director.		In that order.		For the record, nobody called cops on us. We were invited by HHS and the shelter.

Kids here get only two hours a day to be outside in fresh air. 		One hour of structured time. 		One hour of free time. 		The rest of the day is spent inside a former Wal Mart.
Moments after we walked in a shelter employee asked us to smile at hundreds of detained migrant kids in line for a meal because ‚Äúthey feel like animals in a cage being looked at.‚Äù
Officials here said they‚Äôve never had an MS-13 member here, ever.
This shelter, Casa Padre, is the largest licensed childcare facility of its kind in the country. Nearly 1,500 boys 10-17 in here now. They‚Äôre supposed to sleep four to room. Nearly every room has 5. They‚Äôve received a variance from the state because of overcrowding.
Just finished tour, don‚Äôt even know where to start. 		One of the first things you notice when you walk into the shelter ‚Äî no joke ‚Äî a mural of Trump with the quote ‚Äúsometimes losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.‚Äù		Presidential murals everywhere. But that one is 1st.
I‚Äôm a part of the first group of journalists to go into the shelter for detained child migrants in Brownsville Texas since the zero tolerance separation policy was announced. 1000+ boys here. 		Going in right now. 		More tonight w @chrislhayes on @allinwithchris @MSNBC. #inners https://t.co/NeLlaDdSKv

@MajorLippage @kwelkernbc @Eugene_Scott @TimAlberta @RepRubenGallego @LatinoDecisions @thelatinovote @julito77 @MSNBC Yes we mentioned the exit poll used by many networks &amp; media orgs. But more than any poll, for me, this is about listening to folks I‚Äôd never normally meet to better understand why we are where we are today. Value your feedback, thank you.
@scot23132 @kwelkernbc @Eugene_Scott @TimAlberta As Linda Richman would say, political science is neither politics or science. It‚Äôs BS. My philosophy is if you want to understand our country, listen to *everyone* especially is you disagree.
@MajorLippage @kwelkernbc @Eugene_Scott @TimAlberta @RepRubenGallego @LatinoDecisions @thelatinovote @julito77 @MSNBC Thanks, appreciate that. We went there because I‚Äôm interested in why these folks voted the way they voted. We didn‚Äôt hide who the show‚Äôs host is or what his politics are. There is value in understanding &amp; listening. This is not about 9/16 poll or exit polls. It‚Äôs about people.
@MajorLippage @kwelkernbc @Eugene_Scott @TimAlberta @RepRubenGallego @LatinoDecisions @thelatinovote As @julito77 &amp; yours truly have tweeted back &amp; forth about a bunch, that exit poll &amp; our 9/16 poll may very well have been off.

@julito77 And as you well know I‚Äôm one of your (and @InTheThickShow) biggest fans!
@julito77 You are completely fair, and raise important point about polling/exit polling as always. Whatever the percentage of Latinos for Trump in NV, IMHO, it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand why folks voted for Trump irrespective of his margin of victory.
@soccerlives1127 @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid Appreciate it, and keep watching.
@jonbyersphotos I‚Äôm not a defender of Trump agenda. Not talking about Trump agenda. Talking about you viewing *one* of my reports and falsely saying I‚Äôm not covering/haven‚Äôt covered Dreamers or Dems while at same time characterizing all Trump supporters as hillbillies. That *is* generalizing.
@jonbyersphotos When are *you* gonna stop complaining about seeing people you don‚Äôt agree with, generalizing who they are &amp; *actually* lying about my reporting? BS to say my report isn‚Äôt true bc it represents the opinion of those who support Trump, even if not the opinion of the majority.
@soccerlives1127 @MSNBC Many, many reports with Dems. Agree nobody does it better than @JoyAnnReid. My reporting philosophy is that trying to change people‚Äôs opinions or telling them why they‚Äôre wrong in the field is not my job. But when I‚Äôm behind the anchor desk or with TPTB, no doubt that‚Äôs my job.
If you want the truth about what‚Äôs happening in üá∫üá∏ perhaps look in the mirror sir and check your own (progressive?) assumptions. In response to a report about 30% of NV Latinos supporting Trump you call out ‚Äúhillbilly Trump supporters‚Äù at ‚Äúsome rust belt diner.‚Äù SMH. https://t.co/huXmBP1C66
Now *this* is a reasonable response. ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/QNxxroNTDS
Who cares? You should if you want change. One year ago today Democrats &amp; many in media were saying we all need to listen more closely to the folks who voted for Trump to better understand them &amp; learn from 2016. Folks already seem over that idea. üòêüòêüòê https://t.co/cwSl9vFdBU
@jonbyersphotos If you don‚Äôt like what folks who voted for current president have to say, perhaps put your energy into finding a way to stop that from happening again. It‚Äôs my job to report on what is actually happening in America even if you don‚Äôt want to see or hear about it.
@soccerlives1127 Simply not true to say my reports are only with Trump voters. It‚Äôs also not my job to convince them they‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs my job to tell our viewers what voters of all stripes believe and why.

@NickFalacci It's my job help our viewers understand why folks vote for who they vote for. Not to tell those voters why they're wrong to vote for someone. Thats the job of an activist. Different story if I'm anchoring &amp; interviewing an elected pushing policy or reporting on policy proposals.
@waltb31 @BeautyBind @KatyTurNBC I didn't say that. I said voters in this area are swing voters. It was a 7,000 vote difference in Duval County this year. Extremely close.
@NickFalacci Katy asked me about the regulations, and we talked about that he didn't bring up any specific ones and likes his tone over policy. So what am I missing? What was it about our 2015 Oregon shooting coverage you didn't like?

@DennisBarrowDC @SandraNordland That's fair enough. I appreciate that.
@Cy_Lanced My job is to report facts, not to inspire activism. You're welcome to cherry pick your least-favorite reports of mine. Any pretending here is *you* saying these folks shouldn't have a voice &amp; implying you know better. That's what fired them up in the first place. Godspeed.
@NotoriousSDA The difference in Duval County was less than 7,000 votes in 2016.
@JustMeMbMa @chrislhayes @daveweigel Exactly.
@Cy_Lanced If these folks supported Dems you'd want to hear from them. That's not journalism. Reality is they exist. Challenge for Dems is to understand &amp; either win them over or do better than '16. Dems did latter last night but haven't locked up these folks yet. Doesn't that concern you?

@OTIndivisible @MSNBC Thanks. But it's BS that we covered Trump as "disinfectant." We covered him because people wanted him to be POTUS.
@lblairhrc Normalization is happening by Trump, who says Johnson's peers are "very fine people." Ignoring what that means to Johnson et al. is foolish.
@HeatherHale88 You need me to explain to you what is wrong with someone saying races should be separated? Really? Extremism doesn't need an explanation.
@Anonfernow @MSNBC Sorry, but Trump is the one giving White Nationalists a voice. We're exposing them for who they are in hopes sunlight is best disinfectant.

Now a more important question, as posed by @MarkWarner to @mitchellreports: Will Trump's DOJ act on those words?
Two days after the #Charlottesville attack, POTUS uses word "racism" for first time: "This weekend's racist violence... Racism is evil."

@BrelandCraig @NicolleDWallace @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe And that legacy is shameful. Was also a health crisis.
@sharb1951 @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Absolutely.
@NicolleDWallace Thank you. Credit goes first to the officials and people in Montgomery Co. who invited us into their daily personal hell to educate us all.

@AmyA1A @mcohiosheriff You keep saying no evidence treatment works. I already pointed out how it has in OH. But doesn't fit your anti-government narrative. Later.
@StevenCSmith12 @djkirkstate @TODAYshow Agree.
@AmyA1A @mcohiosheriff Extraordinary to hear from someone against addiction treatment after seeing our reporting. I hope this epidemic never touches your family.
@AmyA1A If flow of fentanyl to US can be slowed, treatment works. It kills people instantly. Doesn't matter to you - you care about GOP politics.
@AmyA1A @mcohiosheriff I repeat: https://t.co/G5Cqt66vxp
@AmyA1A This is not a failure of treatment. Treatment is why numbers leveled off before fentanyl several years back. Get educated about this.
@AmyA1A @mcohiosheriff Our report is crystal clear: drugs stronger &amp; more dangerous than ever &amp; driving the unprecedented death toll. Not a failure of treatment.
@AmyA1A Why is it a swipe? Why is it gratuitous if it is true? The bill slashes funding to help a mass casualty event. How could anyone defend that?
@AmyA1A @mcohiosheriff It's a fact that the bill on the table would drastically slash addiction treatment funding. Senators asked for $45B they got $2B. Period.
@AmyA1A You clearly don't understand the problem including power of fentanyl coming via Mexico/China. Actually watch our reporting then let's talk.
@AmyA1A It took off because of globalization. Job loss. Despair. Exactly what @mcohiosheriff said in the report. Blaming Obamacare? That's a first.

@juliewhitebread which makes your lie about my reporting ok, right? try a different tack when looking for civil conversation next time.
@juliewhitebread you mean first IA piece where half the family supported HRC? At this point you sound pretty silly. https://t.co/0Vd9XkGgUC
@juliewhitebread literally last IA report was HRC supporter. Your complaints hollow when you don't actually watch. https://t.co/KbYUv6evQR
@juliewhitebread as HRC supporter your time would be better spent campaigning vs. complaining. been on trail since IA w countless HRC folks.
@juliewhitebread try not making things up, like this. all best. https://t.co/yte5AdDpEq
@juliewhitebread why? it is a lie to say what you said. nothing true about it. you made it up. not based in fact. take care.
@juliewhitebread you're wrong. keep scrolling. on days when I feature HRC supporters, I hear I'm in the tank for her from Trump folks.
@ThomasH_v99 @washingtonpost saw that!
@Abigail_036 it's all good I'm just teasing. And seriously thanks for watching.
@Abigail_036 many thanks. And why didn't you say THAT to my friend @JamilSmith? üòâ
@Abigail_036 I wasn't in Puerto Rico. That was @tonydokoupil. But thanks for watching, I guess.
@juliewhitebread then you know that saying I "ALWAYS respond with pro-Trump questions" is a lie.
@AVD911 @Merlin333 how can you say that when neither people in this spot are Trump supporters?
@coachwkm @SteveKornacki Trump supporters say I'm pro HRC. Which is it?
@VianneyMomTo3 @JamilSmith you're correct. She's not a Trump supporter.
@ijackmulcahy @SteveKornacki I spoke with the folks who came out on the street while the home demo was happening. Not scientific poll.
@juliewhitebread you a Clinton supporter? seems like it. Have you watched every piece I've done? Clearly not.
African Americans here in OH could make (or likely break) Trump bid. @stevekornacki helps explain. #UpForGrabsMSNBC https://t.co/ZdD7Z8MX5o
@juliewhitebread mostly pro-HRC ppl feel that way. When I do a piece w HRC folks, Trump tweeters say I‚Äôm for her. Hazard of my job, I guess.
@abigail_036 @jamilsmith happy to let my entire campaign season of reporting speak for itself.

@abigail_036 @jamilsmith what was leading exactly &amp; why? I simply asked about Trump. And the second woman I met is undecided. not for him.

@mettafora my job not to tell people why they should vote. Just reporting what I find. I would do that if I was Clinton campaign, though.

@INDIGOSKYY I guarantee you you're wrong. When you want to have a fact based convo feel free to get back in touch. Thanks for watching.
@Merlin333 @zesty_browns actually the woman said she thinks Trump can best fix her area. She's an undecided voter. Watch again.
@INDIGOSKYY @MSNBC I am only responsible for my reports sir, can't help you with other guests who have freedom of speech like yourself.
@INDIGOSKYY that's not how it works. I randomly meet most folks. More so, woman today was undecided as she said. Perhaps watch more closely?
@INDIGOSKYY who trashed Clinton today?

@DebMg88 @ChicoDelainky @craigmelvin specifically said Romney got crushed in that area and probably won't be different for Trump. Did I not?
@DebMg88 @ChicoDelainky @craigmelvin did I say otherwise?
@DebMg88 @ChicoDelainky @craigmelvin my job is to speak with voters and allow them to make up their own minds based on facts.
@DebMg88 @ChicoDelainky huh? When?
@DebMg88 @ChicoDelainky @craigmelvin what I'm doing is telling stories of real folks. If you don't like what they have to say, sorry.
@lyn_cade @craigmelvin she didn't say she was voting for Trump, she said she's undecided but thinks he could better fix her neighborhood.

@ferkslaw1 @dcexaminer dude you can send me a zillion articles. Doesn't change fact members didn't vote.
@ferkslaw1 @MSNBC wrong. Union leadership endorsed on behalf of members. Members didn't vote.
@nancylee2016 @realDonaldTrump it was the leaders, not members, who endorsed.
@nancylee2016 @realDonaldTrump not all, but some. And I was told they were not asked about the endorsement.
@LouiseVRuiz @MSNBC because Donald Trump's main policy proposal is the wall. So that's what we are talking about today.
@ferkslaw1 @msnbc actually, 11 members of the union‚Äôs leadership endorsed him. not the 16,000 agents.
@IrishTrump2016 @realDonaldTrump the 11 members of leadership did. Not the rank and file.

@Americassoul @MSNBC we absolutely do my reporting speaks for itself and will continue to. appreciate your feedback.
@Americassoul @MSNBC not this trip we went to a dairy farm and John Deere to look at layoffs but important questions &amp; hope to be back.
@SteelPenguin87 we did!
@Americassoul @MSNBC I agree and was in Waterloo yesterday.
@Americassoul @MSNBC don't I know it! But you can't deny Ag is central to the state right?
I would win the stepping on toes contest.  https://t.co/WwE80wTT1m
@straubmarie1217 @MSNBC no it's the second time you heard me say he won the caucus in Black Hawk County.

Come with me, and you'll be, in a world of pure imagination. #RIP Gene Wilder. https://t.co/FNpHueGEad
@MemphisNative2 @watchingall999 @CoolBreeze018 @MSNBC enjoy the rest of your day. You clearly just want to be a hater. Have a good one.
@MemphisNative2 being a genuine person. Not interested in a pissing contest. I respect &amp; appreciate your service. You tweeted me, remember?

@MrDane1982 thanks. and thanks for watching!
@rrbaker336 nah it's all good! job hazard.
@MemphisNative2 @watchingall999 @CoolBreeze018 @MSNBC when you are introduced to a stranger what do you call it? Not meet?
@MrDane1982 https://t.co/gZkHGej5kI
@fattybeans thanks. When I'm back would love to talk.
@MrDane1982 hello? you watch the clip yet?
@MemphisNative2 @watchingall999 @CoolBreeze018 @MSNBC all last week I was accused of being a Trump supporter. Which is it?
@MemphisNative2 @watchingall999 @CoolBreeze018 @MSNBC lowering? I have said many times it's a privilege to meet so many people across USA.
@MemphisNative2 @CoolBreeze018 calling someone half man isn't making fun of others? What was that line about glass houses &amp; throwing stones?
@MemphisNative2 @CoolBreeze018 anyone denying I'm awkward? You must only hang w people like yourself. I like learning about different folks.
RT @bakedbyyael: Should have carpooled w/@MSNBC to Waterloo, IA! Hope to see @jacobsoboroff at our Cakepoppery soon! #bestcakepopever https‚Ä¶
I think I'm more like a quarter-man than half-man. But citified and fish out of water is accurate.  https://t.co/w7KBhEQPUw
@BethP_STL should be there at some point soon!
@llamasjr you learn something new every day.
@joshuadswanson it's not my job to tell people why to vote for who they vote or what to believe. It's my job to tell you what they think.
@MollyBrown28 I do not, unfortunately!
@BrashPublicity @MSNBC @HillaryforIA when?
@1952_rfp LOL! You sound like my mom!
.@mrdane1982 your DVR must be broken then. Might want to call the cable guy. Watch this: https://t.co/31EPjuaV4H
@NotANumber123 @JoeNBC @morningmika that is ridiculously absurd and if anything is sexist it's you thinking that.
@bakedbyyael @MSNBC nice to meet you!
@AnthonyMAHughes was there last week! Piece airing soon. https://t.co/mMZz4sklTa
@shandy_d I'll be back next week!
@EdNavigation Clinton seems to be pulling ahead in PA. But hope to get there anyhow.
@fattybeans was in Tampa just a week ago. Hope to be back to the area soon!
@LONeal1523 was just in Tampa! Hope to be back soon.
@BeverlyHill1 doubt it. But I'll be there soon anyhow for another story!
@llamasjr what does that mean?
@debracarman2015 I'll be back in Iowa after Labor Day.
@quartocracks debatable. But I love Austin!
@KhalidEconomics maybe when the debate happens!
@SjBuehler @MSNBC hope to get there soon!
@MatthewPV @MSNBC @hughhewitt back to Ohio soon! If Hugh is from there I'm in!
@sjapssjaps @MSNBC what's simplistic is this tweet. The farmer quite explicitly explained the relationship b/t layoffs &amp; corn prices.
@NotANumber123 @JoeNBC @morningmika no, actually the farmer first said "he or she" so I repeated it.
@limitlesskait I actually discussed it with the farmers and they said, paraphrasing, it could happen to anybody.
@SeanCLE @OhioState was there recently! Will be back!
@latafiolesucree not here in Black Hawk County. Which is what I said. There are 99 counties in Iowa.
@MrDane1982 @CNN he won in here in Black Hawk County. Which is what I said. So your facts are wrong not mine, sir.
@ramsberry1 was there all last week!
@NotANumber123 @JoeNBC @morningmika huh?
@CharlieSheenGO @lciricillo @JoeNBC I admire @morningmika's candor. Why pretend human beings don't have opinions? We all do right?
@lciricillo @CharlieSheenGO what's sad you can't have a laugh. I do it at the expense of myself and politicians of all stripes regularly.
