Kenya recalled itâ€™s ambassador to Somalia because Somalia want to explore itâ€™s natural gas resources? So whatâ€™s the issue of Kenya? Bc distraction of Somalia is the prosper of Kenya.

Alshabaab Terror attack Dusin hotel in Nairobi Kenya claimed 14 innocent lives and wounded more, this is the legacy of not having clear strategic to root out these elements. How come 22k Africa troops couldnâ€™t overcome tiny terrorist elements? Taking advantage by donors#
Alshabaab attacked a hotel in Nairobi Kenya, attackerâ€™s are still in the hotel with hostages, Somalia neighbors will never win over alshabaab, unless thereâ€™s full commitment to cooperate with Somalia government to eradicate these elements of terror#
