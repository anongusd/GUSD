@KamalaHarris And @POTUS is what did @SenKamalaHarris do for California, or while in the senate? Lobbing statements is easy, getting it accomplished is another story, one still unwritten by you and your party.
Happy Birthday Juda!! how spectacular! The peoples @POTUS captures the moment! Proud to be an American!!
@TheDemocrats Californias $25B given to illegal immigrants has destroyed education &amp; state infrastructure investment. Your party punted the ball far too long, only realizing now, that you need illegals to get votes, as middle Americans have abandoned you!
The Democrats must be panicking as the President revealed the platform for Americans, not illegal aliens. We remain strong defending our nation and its people!

As a member of the foreign intel com. @IlhanMN you sure r indignant in such a position of pwr. #America  has enough enemies you &amp; other #Socialists r follwing the Karl Marx Communist Manifesto actively trying to destroy our country from within, deologically &amp; economically.
#BlackHistoryMonth this month honors the trailblazers who defined the ideals of America through their perseverance of adversity, as a nation we must rise above the modern-era vitriolic dialogue, remembering that were #StrongerTogether as One Nation, Under God! https://t.co/FXWKBNmLLT

@SenSanders What is fair by your standards? By ratios of taxation, Billionaires pay higher taxes &amp; contribute more to the economic engine. You can't earn what you don't deserve, stop the lies and mistruth, its ruining generations filled with ignorance of accountability!! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Sp3u36kmLs

@SenSanders Once again demonizing individuals, whose ability to save a failing company due to advantages of non-taxation for several years through the internet sales. #Socialism will not solve these problems only make them worse, can't give away what's not earned! https://t.co/uOFXEHWXME https://t.co/WAI1cDD5st
@DNC @SpeakerPelosi The house of cards built under the house of Clinton can only go so far before the people realize the demonic perspective of the reality in which you reside @georgesoros go after a simple #american bucking the system. Oh wait, I'm educated, not your demographic

@SpeakerPelosi this article reminds me of your statement https://t.co/UdxvF7hzmD. As an editor, we read everything that crosses our path FOR FREE, yet you as a millionaire elitist, don't bother to know what you vote for or how @americans will be affected, how #PatheticPelosi
@CSVtweets @DawnAdamsVA I agree. That is the after-effects of abortion. We at The American Standard delved into the realities of this humanistic travesty, providing the true view of the abortion experience. Remember, a reproductive system creates humans, not fetuses; despite leftist elitist ideology
WAKE UP middle-class #America, @HowardSchultz &amp; @realDonaldTrump two independently wealthy individuals being demonized by political elitist whose wealth benefited from years of rhetoric? How do you define the #AmericanDream, through action or hyperbole? Soros @DNC  puppetmaster! https://t.co/k9f6JOggmA

Margaret Sanger "Birth Control and Racial Betterment" Feb 1919.

#IllegalImmigration at what point will those who legally naturalized in America seek a refund from the government? Illegal crossings are granted an automatic waiver?  @realDonaldTrump initiate the refund process for all fees, show the @DNC whose in charge, citizens or illegals! https://t.co/ueKPp3B2r2
@FactsMathLogic @IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Facts are facts, will special needs &amp; viable deformed children be murder as a selective procedure? Can you defend these images, &amp; answer why taxpayers supplement @PPFA "heatlhcare" to provide #Infantcide srvcs. Lastly would u support ur daughters choice to perform this brutality? https://t.co/MPXEavmJKc
@AOC @RepAOC Answer pls: Do you support ur states late-term abortion bill?  Are special needs/deformed children considered non-viable? Can u define infanticide in ur own words? What is ur opinion on these images of abortion? Are Amer. Kids less important than illegal immigrants? https://t.co/rY1keRfi7Q
@Pontifex will you begin exposing the hypocrisy of an unfaithful flock who support late-term #Infantcide, by excommunicating them from the church? @GinaRaimondo @NYGovCuomo, they conflate truth to serve the interests of Satans will over the meek, weak &amp; vulnerable. Take a stand! https://t.co/tG42QfuNZW

@GovernorVA #infanticide as defined by you ‚ÄúThe infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that‚Äôs what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.‚Äù how sick minded u are! https://t.co/xH0RSJp9Wi
@DNC @KamalaHarris @DawnAdamsVA @RalphNortham watch and learn from a child whose at risk birth could have erased his story from history. https://t.co/g4sF12NefH	#Infanticide is murder amd you are all accomplices.
@DawnAdamsVA image this picture represents a 20-week old a special needs child, would this child be comsidered an at-risk pregnancy? Would you motivate your daughter to have a brutal later-term abortion due to special needs risks? #Infanticide is murder, &amp; ur an accomplice! https://t.co/kA5qBRHzFV
@ShannonBream @GovernorVA @foxnewsnight @FoxNews @DNC @SenKamalaHarris Margaret Sangers perspective as noted in Time "In a 1921 article, she wrote that, ‚Äúthe most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective"  are special needs kids at risk? https://t.co/rNS4V0PhUY
@KamalaHarris #infantcide is murder, @DNC historical of eugenics. Margaret Sanger said the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective.‚Äù https://t.co/ZpdtsKrZwY did She  her efforts in minority communitiesü§î? And today? https://t.co/LNKVPuauYa
@RalphNortham was this a delivered viable child whose mother &amp; doctor decided to abort. Will children with @Downsyndromecen or @SpinaBifidaAssn be considered a high risk late term abortion candidate? #truthbetold #America eradicate infantcide! https://t.co/YDweQPgAnw
@SenKamalaHarris @ConMijente @DNC @Downsyndromecen @SpinaBifidaAssn @GOP Will this child be torn from its mother?   onsider the facts folks, a non-viable pregancy has subjective objectivity in a world against life for all.
@SenKamalaHarris @ConMijente @SenKamalaHarris interesting stance your support &amp; the @DNC postion w/ late term abortion. Are @Downsyndromecen @SpinaBifidaAssn children at risk pregnancies? Was this child an at risk late term abortion. #facts of infantcide. Your a supporter of murder! 		@GOP expose the truth! https://t.co/2Gk1mWmgkq
Sickening. @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @seanhannity. Focus on the facts of everyday citizens to eradicate the nonsensical perspectives of the leftest elitist
Despite what this Administration says, children are still being ripped away from their parents. In this case, I‚Äôm so grateful for the advocacy of 	@ConMijente	 &amp; proud of my case work team who fought hard to reunite this 1-year-old with her mother at SFO last night. Ur words.
#Factsonly not hyperbole, https://t.co/wwNdEtjx97. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DNC.	Your words not mine;  highlight ypur desdain for struggling American citizens who depend on government to protect and defend the #Constitution, against foreign and domestic enemies
@SenKamalaHarris fighting for #IllegalImmigration is counteractive to supporting the needs of #American citizens your vitrolic lies of illegal immigration forgets over half of people in families with children who used shelter in 2016 identified as African American or Black.
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.‚Äù  @DNC @GOP. Violations of the oath of office are treasonous actions that threaten our American ideals.
Title 5, Section 3331 ‚ÄúI, AB, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely,
To the Silent Majority: Rise against the political elites destroying the ideals of the American Middle-class, standing aligned as citizenry servants who defend the American dream from that dystopian vision of the corrupt @DNC &amp; @GOP politicians who care for themselves over you!
Elite politicians express the desires of the people through rhetoric and hyperbole while aligning with radical political factions whose main goal is to decimate the American Middle-Class. The sheep are awakening to the demagogic excess &amp; deceit of the ruling class, @DNC &amp; @GOP!
