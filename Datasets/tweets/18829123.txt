#November2016 is one of the most important elections in my lifetime. We need a president who will bring America together - @HillaryClinton
The AA community has a lot to lose in voting for #Trump - the respect of the rest of the world, our unfettered right to vote, a living wage.
Yesterday, I joined a @HillaryClinton press call on #Trump &amp; his “appeal” to AA voters. My message was clear: My district is not a war zone.
I look forward to our ongoing efforts as we work together for a strong party &amp; a successful election. Together we make America Stronger.
It is an honor for me and the people of #Ohio.  I am happy to serve &amp; look forward to a great convention. #DNC2016

I was proud to stand w/ @CBCPAC today to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. #ImWithHer https://t.co/MuKaJdIcVm
I stand w/ Hillary because she understands America is only as strong as its people. She has been advocating for the AA community for years.
Income inequality is not new to my community and Hillary has known that most of her entire life. #ImwithHer
Hillary Clinton has fought to level the playing field for children &amp; especially children of color for her entire professional life.
Our next president needs to speak for all Americans. He/She needs to speak for me. Hillary has been fighting for my community for 25+ yrs.
Thank you @CuyahogaDWC for your support.
RT @CuyahogaDWC: Congrats to @mlfudge! We proudly endorse you!
Hillary didn't just start caring about the AA community. She's been a life-long advocate and a consistent voice for equality and justice.
I am a Black woman and I stand w/ Hillary. She is my candidate for president because she speaks out on issues important to me.
.@HillaryClinton is a LEADER who will get things done for the American people EVERY DAY. @BernieSanders “some days,” I guess.

The Women Succeed agenda expands the child care tax credit and promotes access to affordable, quality child care.
The Women Succeed agenda also includes the FAMILY Act, which would provide women more time to take care of themselves and their families.
We must strengthen working families and our middle class by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act &amp; increasing the minimum wage.
When women succeed, America succeeds is more than an agenda title; it is a statement of fact.
President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law more than 50 years ago. And women continue to earn less than men.
