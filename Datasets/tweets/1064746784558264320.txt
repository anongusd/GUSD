@andrewtfluck @BernieSanders @tommiesunshine Im advocating for	1) no free public schooling. If you want an education, pay for it	2) 100% inheritance tax. I don't believe in handouts
@andrewtfluck @BernieSanders @tommiesunshine Those little kids could support themselves if they laced up their bootstraps, and worked a little in the fields. That's what we used to do
@andrewtfluck @BernieSanders @tommiesunshine I totally agree. That's also why i believe in a 100 percent death tax. I don't believe you should be getting handouts, damnit
@andrewtfluck @BernieSanders @tommiesunshine Damn, you just owned me. Add another point to the triggered tally
@andrewtfluck @BernieSanders @tommiesunshine Anyone who wants any public education should have to pay their own tuition.

@spalkeen @MagnarOfCLE @VP @POTUS What is a single policy any democrat is proposing that is socialisn?
@VP @POTUS This is stupid scare mongering. First socials security and medicare were socialism. Then it was obamacare. Now it's m4a. It's weird that the gop calls policy that helps average americans "socialsim", but not policy that gives 20 billion a year to the fossil fuel industry

@RealAsianGuy @TankieSanders @Politics_Polls @UNHSurveyCenter Dude, i keep telling you, there is no evidence that hw lost because of perot. The econony was in the toilet at the time. That's why he lost
@RealAsianGuy @TankieSanders @Politics_Polls @UNHSurveyCenter Bush lost red states because he was unpopular. And his opponent getting 23 percent in a ptimary is an example of that. And I'm not saying trump won't win. Im saying a strong primary opponent could show he's vulnerable. Obama in 2012 and bush in 04 easily won primary, and gereral
@RealAsianGuy @TankieSanders @Politics_Polls @UNHSurveyCenter Last 3 incumbents who faced "serious" primary challenges, (ford, carter, and bush) all lost their general elections
@RealAsianGuy @TankieSanders @Politics_Polls @UNHSurveyCenter Perot took equally from clinton and bush. Also we're not talking abt kasich running as ind (although that would help dems in 2020 most likely). If he ran in gop primary and got 20-25% of vote, it would show trump is vulnerable. 	https://t.co/pv0wn1dwob
@TankieSanders @Politics_Polls @UNHSurveyCenter If kasich can get 17 percent nationwide, it could show signs of weakness in trump, making it more likely for a loss. Remember, George hw bush faced a primary challenger who got abt 23 percent of the vote. Bush then lost to Clinton

@thbucknasty @BernieSanders But the governments can take all of them away. The gov can nullify the first 10 amendments if they so pleased
@thbucknasty @BernieSanders Then we have no rights then. If ypu are saying that rights can't be taken away, we have literally no rights
@thbucknasty @BernieSanders That's just moving the goalpost. The U.S. gov gave us the 1st amendment, and they can take the 1st amendment away. We've nullified the constitution before
@_live_k @BernieSanders It's absurd how people say we can't afford #MedicareForAll. Every other major country on earth has universal care, and it would save 5 trillion over 10 years.

@dontreaddd @kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull Good job changing the subject
@dontreaddd @kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull He ended it because people on both  sides of the aisle were rightly saying it was immoral, so it is a bad look to try and defend it. No past modern President did what he did.
@dontreaddd @kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull That's not an answer to my question. If child seperation was ok, why did trump end it?
@dontreaddd @kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull If child seperation was ok, why did trump decide to end it with an executive order?
@StevenW79997830 @CathoConser @FCDallasMom2 @thehill They didn't have to be seperated from their families. That's the point. No administration before trump did that. Bush didn't do what trump did. Obama didn't. Even trump stopped after a few months of heavy backlash
@StevenW79997830 @FCDallasMom2 @CathoConser @thehill Except they didn't. Thats why they stopped after heavy backlash. That's why they didn't do it under bush or obama. Stop making excuses for the cruelty of the president
@CathoConser @FCDallasMom2 @StevenW79997830 @thehill Dude, they weren't being seperated from coyotes. That was policy under bush and obama. They were being seperated from their parents, causing long term trauma. The gop is fucking bankrupt morally, defending child seperation.
@CathoConser @thehill The gop supported seperating children at the border and baby jails like 3 months ago.
@kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull Fair enough
@kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull Trump was the one who introduced seperation of families at the border, is what I mean. It was so bad he had to sign an exec order stopping it. Not even Bush did it.  It was purposeful cruelty by him
@kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull *tolerance
@kmwsoon @RubyTumbleweeds @CalebJHull The gop trump administration were the only ones to implement the no tolerancr policy, boss. Not even Bush did what trump did

I'm sorry but literally everyone hates your platform. Most Americans think that the elderly should be able to get fucking health care dude
@Lee_Tourneau @BernieSanders Do you also oppose funding public k-12? Do you seriously believe that people will vote for someone who will let social security and medicare go bankrupt when they are the most popular programs in America?

@Thequarrybends @johncusack There was no legal precedent to try to get an innocent man back in jail after he appealed. The judge and the 9th circuit agree with me. There is no precedent to work with lawmakers to write the harsh truancy bill. There is no  preccedent to tell californians to vote no on prop 66

@FrankieKnuckle8 @HongPong @A_Zelinski @IlhanMN You're twitter literally says "history will not remember critics of maduro kindly". What are you on?
@HongPong @A_Zelinski @IlhanMN The President of the national assembly is acting president if there is no president or vice presdient. The elections held were in violation of the constitution
@HongPong @RussiawithoutBS @IlhanMN @athenogenes I didn't know canada has a fascist pm
@charliesoo1984 @FrostedVeins @IlhanMN Whos over throwing a south american governemnt? The elections were not valid under the Venezuela constitution, therefore an acting president can be appointes until an election is held

@rgdran @Reuters The constitution of Venezuela allows this to happen. I'd also say that almost every south ameeican country is saying juan is interim president

@Teddy_Stache @mklein2020 @FCardamenis @daveweigel I u mean oleg sanctions, he voted to proceed with the resolution.
@mannyvu89 @alurabrava @daveweigel He didn't? Lol gillibrand missed thr initial vote, not sanders
@KaJo503 @daveweigel It's way more obtuse to have to say. "All dem senators and independant senators did xyz" instead of "all dem senators did xyz". No one is confused when you lump bernie in with dems
@mklein2020 @daveweigel You're right. Why don't we run clinton again?
@mklein2020 @FCardamenis @Teddy_Stache @daveweigel Sanctions hurt poor ppl, not the people who are in power. Also, iran sanctions were lifted as part of the nuclear deal
@shayne571 @_geeberry @daveweigel Says someone who stans kamala, who supported trauncy laws that disproportionately affected poc and lower income ppl. And who also was against statewide standards for body cams, which was criticized by the aclu
@alurabrava @daveweigel *oleg
@brainylainie @daveweigel Voted to proceed with oleg sanctions, and for 2015 magnitsky ones. Other sanctions included iranian sanctions
@alurabrava @daveweigel Voted for 2015 magnitsky sanctions and to proceed with ileg vote, just to be clear
@nicolekn83 @longlivetheteam @drunkbysix It wasn't her job to go after truancy as hard as she did. It wasn't her job to oppose things like statewide standards for body cams, which even the aclu criticized

@AOCfanaccount @seriousprogress @politico Is an aoc fan account really supporting clinton over sanders? How dense do you have to be AOC SUPPORTED SANDERS 2016 CAMPAIGN. Lmao y'all are hopeless
@AOCfanaccount @seriousprogress @politico Sanders does better with poc than white ppl
@AOCfanaccount @politico Aoc is a sanders supporter.
@PhilipNight @GPollowitz @allahpundit Yeah, but its totally insider baseball bs. I don't care what letter is next to his name. I just want healthcare
@GPollowitz BeRNie iSnT a dEmoCRat
@JosBaskinRobin @SenSanders Gillibrand also missed a vote. No ones talking abt her views on russia
@JosBaskinRobin @SenSanders Voted for 2015 magnitsky act. Voted to proceed with vote on oleg sanctions.
@flywithkamala @SenSanders How about a president that isn't pro prison labor and who isnt a cop
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Exactly. I'm sure you had good reasons to support obama in 08. Just like i had many good reasons to support sanders in 16.
@FiveThirtyEight Maybe she should first explain why she didn't go after mnuchin, and is pro prison labor.
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Yall called obama supporters "obama boys". Also, not only does bernie have higher approval among men than woman, but "bernie or bust" is also a myth. 10% of sanders supporters voted for trump in 2016. 25% of clinton supporters voted for mccain in 08
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Bernie bros is a myth. Yall said the same thing about obama in 08.
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 So you are not going to say that her supporting prison labor was a bad thing? Are you not gonna say that truancy laws and her stance on bodycams were a bad thing?
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Im willing to acknowledge good things she's done if you will at least acknowledge her bad track recod as AG, which included prison labor, harsh truancy laws, opposition to statewide standards for body cams etc. This is not a winning fight
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Danielle, it looks really bad when a white person tries to defend a prosecutor who locked up POC and was in favor of prison labor. It's best to just say she did some things wrong as AG, instead of trying to defend her on this
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 So you're saying what she did as AG of cali was wrong? Because the article doesn't talk abt harris adressing her record as AG
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Tfw you're such a progressive you don't care about poor and POC being locked up, and prison slavery
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Its obvious satire lol. Also, it's clear that you can't respond to what i said. Im sorry that im right abt her background
@Deedee15644 @NateSilver538 She opposed releasing non violent inmates because she wanted more prison labor, didn't prosecute mnuchin and supported harsh truancy laws, which locked POC and lower class ppl up.
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Stood behind her decisions. It's concerning that she stood behind things like locking up POC and being pro prison labor.
@flywithkamala @SenSanders Harris opposed releasing non violent inmates because she wanted more prison labor. She didn't prosecute mnuchin and liked harsh truancy laws, which threw 1000s of low class and POC in jail
@IndyHawk0307 @siano2020 Kamala harris opposed releasing non violent inmates because she wanted more prison labor. She supported harsh truancy laws, abd didnt prosecute mnuchin.
@BipolarStyle @adamcbest Kamala harris opposed releasing non violent inmates because she wanted more prison labor. And if you were one of the thousands of mainly lower class and black Americans locked up under her, you might feel differently abt her
@dianatorp @elbalm @GregProops @JessicaValenti Kamala harris is a cop who didn't prosecute mnuchin and supported harsh truancy laws. She threw tons of poor black people in jail. Pass

@DearAuntCrabby @BobSull13 Tpp sucks ass. Bad policy

@idekbrendan @AmirAminiMD Brendan, just to be clear, you know what a primary is, right?
@Clodagh831 @MSNBC Kamala harris is one of the shitiest canidates I've ever seen. She's a cop who can't win the rust belt, and who let mnuchin off scott free
@RyanLEllis The right is insane. You literally want federal employees to starve and become homeless because you dont like dems
@StephenCrane71 @tonyposnanski Gotcha. So we shouldn't have a primary, and party insiders should pick the nominee. Glad we're on the same pwge
@MikeLee762 @TulsiGabbard You're the one commenting on her post

RT @benshapiro: Hey ⁦@BetoORourke⁩ https://t.co/RgrPI4bWi6
@leftyjennyc Its sexist to imply that people like AOC because of physical features, and not her strong progressive policy. But i guess you'd expect that from a Hillary clinton democrat
@ResistResource @ccbecker271 @BernieSanders He wasn't made aware of those problems. These kinds of thinga are unfortunately common, they even appeared in clinton and harris's campaigns
@LizAud @MeckleyKim @rizzoTK @SuzanneKelleher @DanEggenWPost @AOC Thats my point. I never saw the correction post. Had i not done my own research, i would be walking around thinking something false to be true.

@krossny1 @marx4all @DeahLieurance @SenGillibrand Idk why ppl keep bringing this up. He ran in 2016 so he could run in 2020. He is way more in line with dem values than someone like joe donnelly anyways.
@LAnatra_ @krossny1 @SenGillibrand She should explain why she wants wall street execs to support her. Wall street execs should hate dems, and we should welcome the hatred, not get their support
@krossny1 @SenGillibrand The article also says "She did not deny having conversations with Wall Street executives".
@DeahLieurance @SenGillibrand So? Doesnt make anything i said less true
@Rize2W @SenGillibrand Sirota didn't right it though. The articles from cnbc. It is also correct. Gillibrand never denied it
@SenGillibrand Try responding to the article
@DeahLieurance @SenGillibrand The story is from cnbc. The story is also correct

@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice Thanks. Happy New year
@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice Hillary clinton doesn't support medicare for all. Admit it. You just dont understand how much we need medicare for all. Its a crisis in America https://t.co/4tL0XVrxdy
@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice I have done my research. Clinton doesn't support medicare for all. She also supported the iraq war, fracking, and waffled on nafta. She also took hundreds of thousands of $ for wall street speeches https://t.co/eJcfwoCFPL
@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice In 2016, bernie was the only presidential candidate to support medicare for all. Thats not dividing the party. Its easy for you to like Clinton when you already have health care, but there is a reason she has 30 percent approval right now.
@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice He didnt divide the party. He pushed the party more left, so democrats would finally start supporting medicare for all. Im not going to try to reason with some canadian who doesnt understand american politics
@BrentMc482 @ProgressVoice I never mentioned history, i said politics. If you did understand us politics you would realize the country wants medicare for all, tuition free college. Thats why bernie is the most popular politician in the US

@poetguygabe @johncusack Biden has the whole Anita Hill thing and made it harder to get rid of student debt. Idk if he can even get the nomination but thats just my take
@AJVillali And as the AG she refused to prosecute OneWest for foreclosure violations. 🤔
@czthaday @PalmerReport You said he spoiled 2016. Im not lying
@czthaday @PalmerReport Its not my problem that you don't know what a spoiler is. Not my fault Clinton doesnt support medicare for all and takes corporate money. You realize that if he ran as an independent you would call him a spoiler, right?
@czthaday @PalmerReport Thats not a spoiler. Running against someone is not a spoiler. He dropped out months before the election. Im sorry if you're mad he brought up Clintons terrible voting record, like voting for the iraq war, fracking, flipping on nafta, and taking wall street  $ for secret speeches
@tomwatson @BlkHawkDowneyJr #bernie2020
@czthaday @PalmerReport You have not answered my question once. If you forgot, my question is what do you mean by "Spoiling the race is immaterial, he did that in 2016. "? How did he spoil 2016 like you're saying here?
@czthaday @PalmerReport The current head of the dnc said the dnc should not be biased towards one canidate or another,. Also, what do you mean by "Spoiling the race is immaterial, he did that in 2016. "?
@czthaday @PalmerReport Please explain what you meant by "Spoiling the race is immaterial, he did that in 2016. ". Also, the dnc can't discriminate against someone who is running. The people should be able to decide without interference from the dnc
@czthaday @PalmerReport You said "Spoiling the race is immaterial, he did that in 2016. ". Plus the leaked emails showed there was bias from the DNC towards him.
@czthaday @PalmerReport Can you please explain how he spoiled the race in 2016? More sanders supporters voted for clinton in the general than Clinton supporters voted for obama in 2008. Do you think we shouldn't have primarys?
@czthaday @PalmerReport How did he spoil the race by running in 2016? He endorsed clinton for the general.
@czthaday @PalmerReport Sanders caucuses with dems and is a lot more left wing than someone like joe donnelly. Plus, if he couldn't run as a dem, he would run as an independent in the general, which would spoil the race

@Tzipshmil @sheagrimm @brianschatz Dude, if the canidate says they dont know if they are progressive, they aren't a progressive.
@sheagrimm @Tzipshmil @brianschatz Exactly. Like how Kamala Harris decided not to prosecute Steve Mnuchins bank OneWest. And how she got a $2000 donation from Mnuchin in 2016
