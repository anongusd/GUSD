We all know McConnells an obstructionist dick but Hick is right, we need to overcome our fear of him and confront him into a solution. Him or Amy would probably be good at this especially the latter. https://t.co/rMAHO05VG5
@chrislongview I feel the tide has turned enough that ppl are more willing to be open abt Hillz, the fact that Gillibrand gingerly admitted her influence not long ago says smth
He can at least like most dem governors who were elected in 2010 (Brown, Dayton, Cuomo) credit himself with turning around his state without deepthroating voodoo economics https://t.co/NA6OxdlJA8
I don’t give hick much of a chance, but having Bill and Hillz as advisors instead of fake pollster Sean Mcelwee (lookin at u Gillibrand) is a very good and underrated idea. I hope he along with Amy and eventually Uncle Joe start telling the left to fuck off and get real https://t.co/JWj2AtBoLe
There I disagree..... Fox is the only news medium in huge parts of the country and we need to expose our ideas on there. There Tom is sadly right, the era where we could talk to our own bubble should be over https://t.co/UpgoNCQvjK

For my love of Hillz I definitely think her “coal miners out of work” gaffe cost her the election https://t.co/fh2tiv5FqT

@Leahgreenb The "compromise" you're talking abt has no doubt saved millions of lives and given many more the opportunity to enjoy the benefit of healthcare for the first time in their life. A lot of Americans don't know the ACA and Obamacare were the same thing. The ACA helped us in 18 btw

@SenhorRaposa @OfficialClayyy @politicsluo Largely due to reps who have universal appeal despite being quite progressive like Defazio and Blumenauer
@OfficialClayyy @politicsluo @SenhorRaposa WA dems usually win statewide not thru the hipster hoods of Seattle but in suburbs like Lynnwood, Renton, Bellevue, Lakewood and Everett. Theres a reason 6/7 of the WA dem house delegation are moderate
Fuck your whataboutism...... Both are wrong and should be condemned, however if were not taking LW and Muslim antisemitism seriously its a matter of time til my community is under threat https://t.co/h4xcrIuT6r
@SenhorRaposa @politicsluo Those of you who are replying "she isnt too far left for WA" obviously don't know Seattles suburbs that well. Theres a reason the WA state senate was red until last year. Also the GOP nearly won the Gov race in 12 by winning those areas. Most reps in that area are moderate dems
@AbrasiveObelisk @SenhorRaposa @abhiprofen That AG race was complicated.... Ellison had the most name recognition in a last minute free for all when Swanson retired on the filing day out of nowhere. Given Schumers reputation I don't see that happening
@SenhorRaposa @BenJKest @OfficialClayyy Would also not surprise me given her age that Watson Coleman retired, took one for the team and let her seat be broken up between Kim and Malinowski
@SenhorRaposa @OfficialClayyy Wouldn’t surprise me if she sought the now open SOS job
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa Tho I will also add it wouldn’t surprise me if several governors are looking at the Gillibrand route for a replacement like appointing Hilll, Craig or Sherill to replace Harris, Klobuchar or Booker
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa Doesn’t surprise me.... Kamala cleared the field almost when she announced back in early 15. Everyone and their uncle was considering running IIRC but he kinda waited until mid summer 15 and deferred to Harris.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa Barragan isn’t bad at all.... She and Hill definitely would be the frontrunners for an appointment by Newsom if Harris were to win POTUS
@42applesenergy @SenhorRaposa Wicks is more likely to replace Lee AFAIK. She and Schaaf are the frontrunners if Lee were to retire

@SheltieMac @earthdogelevena That’s true but it is true he won my generation in terms of raw vote even breaking even with young blacks, tho then again my generations turnout generally sucks so those who didn’t like Bernie as much might’ve stayed home
@SheltieMac And I warned ppl abt this awhile back yet they don’t seem to wrap themselves around it.
@SheltieMac @earthdogelevena Corny West is definitely someone you shouldn’t take seriously let alone have as an advisor
@SheltieMac @earthdogelevena Young ppl have more “woke”ish views but statistical evidence suggests not as much of a left identity as ppl think. Bernie’s support  among my generation had a lot to do (I think) with him being the NKOTB as well as naïveté after the progress between 2012-15 on some issues
@SheltieMac Also GA and to and extent MD.... Even tho Abrams never backed M4A her early courting national progressives like OR/DFA/DK didn’t help her case
@earthdogelevena I don’t think it’s the home state base as much as ppl think. Jersey and CA have a lot of areas that won’t vote for a liberal... I think it’s more they got one construct in early 17 (Hillz wasn’t woke or progressive enough) and stuck with it despite evidence pointing the other way
@earthdogelevena @SheltieMac I think Hillz is over criticized but this one is legit, we can’t go too far left or else we’ll lose
@earthdogelevena @SheltieMac I’m inclined to believe Sheltie here, contrary to popular belief I don’t think the younger generation (I’m one of em) is that left wing and that the ppl who are out protesting aren’t that representative. Smth to keep in mind
@earthdogelevena Gaffes can be hard to recover from tho you are right it is early..... I will say tho the drop of support for single payer is a message to Kamala/Kirsten/Cory that they need to do better than court the far left when they know they hate them including the woke left.
I toldya Harris "eliminate private insurance" gaffe was gonna damage us. Also the press inviting AOC to double down and bitch abt it as well as every 2020 candidate being asked abt private insurance isn't helping us. I hope every POTUS and sen. candidate gets off this train ASAP. https://t.co/wyxVSTNfXH
@SallyAlbright I don't view trying to talk to average joes and janes as pandering....
The 3rd is actually false, I cannot believe the far left is this stupid..... Rouda was backed by local electeds in the OC plus the DCCC in his primary. Yes the CDP did back another candidate but the CDP is only one organ https://t.co/GrEAC7GAQp
Agree with Alex...... Reparations is a dangerous road to go down that I don't think many average black Joes and Janes care abt. Most black ppl want their children to thrive and grow up in a society that gives them opportunities, respects them and treats them equally. https://t.co/9rYMQX6vZS
Is anyone surprised at this? This is a man who berated both Hillz and Obama for a long time https://t.co/T8TXftm5wS
I don't think any dem will win MO for the foreseeable future but Mccaskill has a point. You don't look down on ppl who haven't won your states https://t.co/h6LA4PBQKs
@DrewVanDrese @TheDemocrats Supporting expansion of voting rights..... I don't think most dems nor most Americans would bat an eyelid at that being a litmus test plus I think you'd be hard pressed to find a voter suppressing dem
@earthdogelevena The sad thing here is I think many dem leaders legiti fear the bernouts, tho those that have lost to them weren’t critical enough if you ask me. I don’t blame em especially after the doxxing of the CNN questionnaires but there is no excuse not to speak up when things are wrong
@earthdogelevena There are so many excellent reps who were never backed by JD/OR last cycle, the problem is that sadly (save for a few like Hill) many of em won’t talk to media like AOC/Ilhan/Tlaib, if real dems are to win we need to talk to every segment of the press from Fox to MSNBC
This is why I’m not a leftist..... Juan Guaido is the legit leader of Venezuela. Ilhan should never have been elevated to the foreign affairs committee in the first place due to the fact that she cared more abt Elliott Abrams past than the status of the Venezuelan ppl https://t.co/eZRENbLyMt
And the far left is still gonna attack dems for not being on board with fiction https://t.co/yCeXQUEuna
Proof that if democrats are to win back the white house and the senate they need to focus on pocketbook issues like health care https://t.co/XwylYO2h2B
@SheltieMac They don't want to learn and thats hella obvious
The fact that #madamespeaker has been cool at times with the far left ("I like Alan Grayson" she once said) is just unacceptable. AOCs conflict of interest with the justice dems will cost us the house if these moderate dems that won it back for us don't speak louder https://t.co/G2y9gCcVOP
@Here4Not Agreed, and extremely stupid as well but the truth is I think Harris is treading in some dangerous waters and could lose because of that
My no.1 beef with Kamala Harris (and its a pretty big one that cant be ignored) is that she seems to think that listening to woke ppl and leftists is gonna get her anywhere when the midterm results don't indicate that at all. Candidates that supported Reparations (Miranda) tanked
@JRubinBlogger As usual right on the bat...... Polling backs up this as well that most dems would rather beat Trump than be pure
What Jen said.... The silent majority of democrats are screaming "we want Trump out even if it means no unrealistic M4A or GND" and save for a few columnists/think tanks here and there plus Klobuchar the scream seems to be falling on some very deaf ears indeed. https://t.co/nnTCOQtNJq

Unpopular opinion but if Biden maintains his lead, more dems will see the light and quit their flirtation with the Bernouts and their far left policies.

@mattymonsterz @OfficialClayyy @GabeTheCentrist Shes great.... I would rather not have a non-latino take on Rubio next time as we need to cut the margins we saw in Hialeah among others against Murphy in half next time
One campaign was the rivalry between two great individuals with both the partys and countrys best interests at heart who afterwards came and fought together in the face of the worst economic disaster since the 30s		The other was another story, Bernie has neither at heart at all https://t.co/xBtseqZIXc

@roon0292 Hes been irrelevant in the Trump since he keeps being unable to swing races in primaries. His choices for both DNC chair and #migov lost, his film flopped and was panned by the Freep (most read paper in his home state) and he did nothing for the midterms at all
Passed under a "republican-lite", "DINO", "fake dem" prez....... Now tell me whos the fake dem now https://t.co/tW3CO7cVMX
@roon0292 Tho ive really been surprised how irrelevant hes seemed this cycle, abt the same if not more than he was in the later Obama years
@roon0292 I’m well aware of that plus him visiting Julian Assange in 2016 makes me think Mueller might have smth on him

@OfficialClayyy @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @politicsluo Her or Perlmutter
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @OfficialClayyy @politicsluo Agreed, I don’t think this quite adds up and. Given Romanoffs past and ties to Sirota I don’t think he’s the establishment choice. Given that I don’t know CO that well I’ll defer to CO experts here

My god this is a bad take from a DSA dudebro whos talking shit. Ask Kaniela Ing or Saira Rao how tryna surf demographics and assuming all POC are leftists worked?

@magi_jay We kept tryna warn ya..... We who saw the fools gold long ago, there's even a pre-primary video of her on GOP backed TYT where she says that the ACA is a failure and Obama didnt do single payer because he wanted to deal w/GOP and Health executives
@OfficialClayyy Says quite a bit when you lose the very grifty Sarah Jones
To put this in ppls heads the most common thing I heard during the Kavanaugh hearings while canvassing in multiple districts (mostly CA and NV) was not "Kavanaughs an evil sexist, I believe Dr. Ford" it was "my god cant you politicians quit squabbling and get shit done for me"
And if they do don't be surprised if Gillibrand ties Gabbard for last time if shes even in the race by then , Bernie tanking or Biden, Brown or Klobuchar winning. I don't think average voters care as much abt Washington as some think, so I don't think Amys staff issue will matter
Also they overrate issues like #metoo and feminism as being top concerns amongst voters. (as a canvasser even last cycle I wasn't asked once abt it). I could keep banging on but what Im saying here is that many are misreading the democratic primary in 2020 at their own peril.....
And lets not forget they minimized Hillz being the driving force behind this pink hued blue wave long before Farrow printed jack shit..... Also many backed Bernie in 16 and many more indeed bang on abt issues that don't even matter except to the far left like "imperialism".......
Want a far left SJW running the country whos woke AF. The #bluewave produced a lot of women and POC but the truth is many ran as badass kind of problem solvers some of whom had served the country in the past. Many of those profiled by "woke mags" lost primaries and generals.....
Doing a thread here abt what crossed my mind this morning abt woke ppl and their alleged influence among dem voters. The anti-Kamala diss round that was on AM Joy this morning showed how out of touch they were with reality in the DP in 2019. The truth is most democrats do not....

@james_feldman @SeanMcElwee Iraq seems to be irrelevant primary voters given that Carper and Feinstein survived and Ed Case snuck back in despite having a history of being a fervent Iraq war supporter as well as the antiwar Capuano losing
@SeanMcElwee Tom Carper and Difi are out of touch due to a misguided vote 15 years ago and last year paid the price.Oh right didnt happen so I guess maybe dem primary voters DGAF abt 15 year old events that are irrelevant in todays America. Anyways you leftists don't get Jewish ppl do you?
I cant believe the casual antisemitism of LW white dudes. the Iraq war is irrelevant now given that Feinstein/Carper survived despite their opponents using it against em.

@daralebrun Me neither.... dictator apologists are non existent even among primary voters and the more moderate/conservative white voters that bailed out Bernie last time won’t bail him out this time given Amy being in and Biden/Brown likely to enter
@OfficialClayyy She’s at least a democrat and someone who doesn’t have a toxic cult round her, tbh with ya I don’t think she has a chance
How I'd vote for each 2020 democrat if they won the nomination:		Enthusiastic vote from me:	Klobuchar	Harris	Booker	Castro		Huge meh from me but will still vote:	Gillibrand	Yang	Delaney	Warren		Wont vote for at all:	Sanders	Gabbard

Last I checked Whitmer, Sinema, Kelly, Rosen etc aren’t in your face kind of feminists a la Gillibrand

@bluebirdofunhap I would never vote for him. However I worry ppl are just refusing to get what's going on and squander away a winnable election. I wish personally someone whos better and a democrat is saying it in public but Schulz is right, the democrats are too far to the left
Trump (not that we should imitate him) shattered many illusions abt the GOP ca. 2015 like them actually caring abt the deficit, fiscal responsibility, pro-free market, pro-free trade etc.....
What Jon said. I myself am someone who's vocally concerned along with many dems that our party is too far left for America. Yet Howard would do better shattering the "dems want to move left"illusion by running as a dem or donating to a new dem instead of being a dickhead spoiler. https://t.co/oxejAVKDww

@RoKhanna @TuckerCarlson You continue to embarrass the South and East Bay by being nothing more than an opportunistic joke.
@witliftin The minute I saw the polling that there was relatively deep support in Queens and BX I called their bluff...... So many state and local politicians listened to vocal progressive activists instead of doing an old fashioned town hall, my biggest gripe w/many dems tbh with ya
Saavedra may not be the best source but this audio proves why nobody trusts spineless panderer Gillibrand. Im sick and tired of being called a Franken apologist for saying the truth. Open borders = losing for better or worse https://t.co/tP6fGeXdkw

An underrated point act the HQ2 fallout.

@robertbobmom I fbow never got round to the women’s march due to a shift I’d agreed to back in 17, but once I heard the rumors abt Sarsour/Mallory quickly jumped off ship. It’s sickened me to see resisters apologize for some of this as if we’re chopped liver

@LikeIGive_Adam @ryangrim @AJentleson Bernie, Feinstein and Schatz
Excellent guest choice @ericswalwell https://t.co/Ld0f7d735W
@jackcurran49 @SenhorRaposa Brenda Lawrence as well
They still had em available in offices well into the 00s https://t.co/w1YlQSDZob
Unless someone tells them to fuck off there seems to be a suicide push to the left atm https://t.co/tKeQXqIq5Q
More evidence of “I toldya so” abt progressives https://t.co/EPagVYLmLl
@sandyknauer @SenSchumer @TomPerez @2020candidates Sadly I'm already seeing ppl on my tl and on a forum Im a member of call for Fairfax to quit....... I said it when the Northam allegation came out, I said after Franken resigned, the right is tryna take advantage of our knee jerk reaction to throw out politicians with baggage
Completely agree https://t.co/28AUfgEYJO
I continue to believe this is a RW conspiracy until evidence emerges otherwise...... https://t.co/RsEJUYXAzH
Congrats Cory...... https://t.co/ArKUvzUFXV
Most dems want an electable candidate period. Were looking to the routes taken by Evers/Walz/Whitmer/Sinema/Brown/Klobuchar/Smith/Wolf/Casey/Stabenow/Baldwin/Rosen/Sisolak https://t.co/Tyf1shT8pq
As someone who's got connections to Kosova via distant family marriage I will say that she is 150% correct. Not speaking up and acting when the ppl are calling for the US help is malpractice a la what Obama did in Syria https://t.co/PeqXP6CGhh
The last section of the article is ridiculous, saying that Beto was too nice and that dems shouldn’t be civil. Also comparing white men to Northam.		The reason Kobach and Walker are out of work is that they didn’t face Avenatti like assholes but faced ppl offering a new vision. https://t.co/UIgQVy02nW
@jackcurran49 Not to mention it being selfish as well
@Ramsey_663 There are a lot of ppl who worship the goddess of Kamala/Abrams w/o looking at any of their flaws. The Abolish private health insurance would’ve been a gaffe if we didn’t have Trump
Precisely what I’m trying to get into fellow dems heads and nobody seems to be listening https://t.co/v5s0oYGd5R
@papa_sharku He should be headed to a job center and announcing his retirement
@politicsluo Tom Emmer IIRC......
@DazInSydney My rep 😍😍😍😍
@sandyknauer Also having Feinstein and Harris as my senators probably has you green with envy
@Ramsey_663 I don’t want her to run for POTUS, I would much rather she ran against Perdue for senate
Proud that my rep is telling bernouts to fuck off https://t.co/UoRIhZOJJK

@siano2020 Wouldn’t surprised and my reaction would be don’t say I didn’t warn you
@davidagordon9 I keep thinking “the GOPs behind this” for awhile
He’s kompromat...... https://t.co/n4dFe5GMx6
@IAmKrishanPatel Meant plenty of
Harry’s right here.....The truth is Bernie had his chance to give the SOTU response as a dem twice before and he didn’t care if it was Beshear, Kennedy or Abrams https://t.co/d3SlhD8lQ9
@IAmKrishanPatel There are of good candidates, Lammy would be my fave tho......

I’m not as against uncle Joe as many of my resisters on this site but my take is let him run but his chance was 2016 and he blew it..... Tho I don’t think his moderation nor his willingness to work across the aisle is as much a detriment as many progressives think https://t.co/p228vhPryb
@LikeIGive_Adam He put out a statement......
It is fake news https://t.co/74M6D2wU6S

@HillaryWarnedUs Brown
@politicsluo My first fall after high school jam 😍😍😍
@morganarae I worry the GOP and/or Russia is tryna run every distraction in the book to distract from its increasingly hard to deny tricks in 2016. I think Graham is acting up for the same reason, he fears being outed
@morganarae I completely agree with this all, but it’s looking very suspicious once you look at it. The Franken expose comes from a Hannity surrogate 3 days after K Gill says Bill should’ve resigned. Northam expose comes barely a day after “abortiongate” from a former breitbart/caller writer
@MaggyW5 Sounds good but I don’t think there’s demand for an all white ticket atm. Smth like Klobuchar/Harris or Brown/Harris would be fine by me
@MaggyW5 Brown or Klobuchar
@MaggyW5 Agreed but I worry abt 2020.....
@overlordjonny @_Political_Nerd Hard to know...... But every GA elected Republican who’s district overlaps #ga06 is looking at getting in
@_Political_Nerd Also MO had become too Republican for a dem to win it. Trump barnstorming her state repeatedly didn’t help
This may be a bit far fetched but I’m beginning to think that this and the Franken expose were done by Russia and its useful idiots to distract from the Mueller probe via surrogates..... He knew K Gill and other dems weak spots when he leaked these exposes. This is kompromat https://t.co/xZaX2d8OO8

@BenSasse Pissed abt nickelback not being the act eh?

@GabeTheCentrist Ppl don’t know Missouri at all, her genius act in getting herself a 2nd term by ratfucking the primary saved the MO dems ass.....
What Claire said.... Dems need to move middle or lose. For those that will dunk on me I will say that she was in a very tough state for a dem and sadly didn’t turn out STL or KCMO blacks and I think her Kavanaugh vote killed any chance of her being reelected. https://t.co/0suKqr8nws

This is making me sick. The Justus dems and the Corbynistas are working together to undermine their parties, AOC just like him got a lot of love from the media and nobody gave a damn.

@samgrande0 @msleen1970 @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio She doesn’t care abt anyone but herself, proud to have a rep that’s a workhorse that was among the first to call on Northam to resign. She waited til after that press conference
@msleen1970 @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio Rted it but sadly not her boro......
@msleen1970 @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio Not to mention Schumer or K Gill
@roon0292 @reesetheone1 I know but I’m still surprised that save for a few interviews here and there how much irrelevance he’s sunk back into I’m not surprised his movie flopped but it was still gratifying to watch
@roon0292 @reesetheone1 He did better when Trump first came on the scene in 2015 but I’ve been surprised at how quickly he’s faded back into obscurity (at least compared to where he was in the 2000s
@IndivisibleTeam Why not you thank @HillaryClinton for paving the way for this.
Thanks again for the umpteenth time @HillaryClinton... https://t.co/HRRykQ0Jcz
@jackjonesbabe @Kamalaallday He’s made so many ridiculous claims idk where to begin. Claiming that the dem base has more in common with AOC than Pelosi when all evidence has shown that white dems are more leftist/woke than POC.
@ghost_ready @msleen1970 @lynnv378 @MMFlint @chrislhayes Anyone who invites Waleed or Saikat should get the same treatment even tho I like Amanpour
@msleen1970 Completely agree, even tho I voted for repeal, CA voters twice kept the death penalty so she shouldn’t be blamed for following the will of the ppl
@SheltieMac He wasn’t that political back then..... There are quite a few ex-GOP who probably were nowhere near as stupid as he was back then
Gary’s right, I’ve seen so many ppl attack Northam for his republican past in the aughts, the thing is that the GOP has gone so wacko that a lot of ppl who once voted for them (my grandparents and parents included) are borderline partisan Democrats. https://t.co/xowaXtRXQ6

@reesetheone1 @clblps @rolandsmartin Bernouts attacked Castro for talking abt the same by saying “indentured to capitalism” which isn’t gonna fly among average Joes and Janes
@tomwatson Completely ignoring that Perriello did better in whiter “ancestral dem” areas whereas Northam blew out in black areas like Norfolk and Richmond.......
Nobody cares Bernie hoe...... https://t.co/LoHVJESdxd
@AlexDesormiers I supported Northam back then as I will always back the new dem candidate whether it’s Whitmer, Walz, Evers etc.
@AlexDesormiers The only reason he was considered remotely progressive back in 2010 was cuz he took some tough votes despite his district going to John McCain.....
@MMFlint Go fuck yourself idiot...... I’m not bothering to listen to your advice again. The truth is that new dems have beat back ppl like Kobach and Walker in addition to being the majority of new governors all across America w/o a racist bone in their body. The joke is on you guys tbh
Go fuck yourself. Northam won that primary by blowing out in black areas like NOVA, Richmond and Hampton Roads which makes it even more embarrassing that you don’t care abt anything than being a dick. Plenty of moderate dems won including in your home state that aren’t racist https://t.co/hzHZTehf4Z
@js_edit I love Amy despite being a Californian and based on who did well during this last cycle I think Amy is the best shot to beat Trump
With precisely a year to go before Iowans go to the polls here are my top 5 for president.		1. Klobuchar	2. Harris	3. Brown	4. Booker	5. Beto
@Temple91 There’s no obvious senate dem consensus choice like in 07-08 at this point given that both Reid and Schumer backed Obama early on.
@Temple91 Depends who CCM backs tho
@Temple91 Do not underestimate Harry Reid and NV...... Him endorsing Obama proved pivotal
Definitely not a cult......... In 96 being gay was banned in 10 states and even conservative Democrats were tryna get stuff thru that banned gay marriage alltogether so ppl don’t bother remembering context at all https://t.co/iQxUIGAqJ4
Somehow this didn’t come up when he ran for state senate in 07 and 11, when he ran for LG in 13, both 07 and 13 being contested primaries not heavily on ideological lines IIRC...... Going batshit left is suicide period https://t.co/NtMD3rRLim

@GabeTheCentrist It was revolutionary because IIRC it was the first major series with a gay couple starring a major role. A lot of my beliefs regarding that is because ppl were shocked when Romney said it was his favorite series when asked abt LGBT rights in 2012
@GabeTheCentrist Agreed, personally I think that Modern Family played a big role in that in the last decade. Remember watching that all these years ago w/my bros when it first came out back in 09ish.
@RelentlessYapp They tried to rename Russell after Mccain but Mcconnell blocked it as usual.....
The fact that in decade and a half we've gone from coming out being a career ending scandal to nobody giving a shit if their governors gay or not says quite a bit abt why I'm never gonna give up on this country. America always reinvents itself to be a more perfect union https://t.co/IkgeWqvuna

@GabeTheCentrist He really is that daft......

@GabeTheCentrist Ofc they dont, They think they can bully us and treat us like shit for a scandal from a candidate we supported. I remember Cenk saying after we lost the senate in 14 that Franken was what dems should emulate so they absolutely have no high ground not to mention Cenks past beliefs
For those concerned abt Ilhan being on this committee I will say that as someone who worked for Ami 4 times in the last decade shes in very good hands, Also a bit funny that a diplomat and a troll are investigating individual 1 https://t.co/PicWGe4P9l
@jmartNYT This doesn’t sound like someone who’s guilty...... Unlike Kavanaugh he’s actually doing what’s right by getting to the bottom of this even tho if it means having some uncomfortable conversations
Sounds to me like there is more to this than ppl think........ An innocent man would be scrambling to try to save his ass instead of throwing a temper tantrum on the senate floor a la Kavanaugh. This is getting bizarre https://t.co/yVWzUGTLmK

This is complete baloney.

Don't think it is at all.

@SER1897 I think that was mentioned somewhere in terms of potential liabilities tho then again nobody objected to Helms for a long time both inside and outside of NC, Took Carol Moseley Braun getting to the senate to end his cherishment of the confederate flag
@Nancy78316588 @wildmoon @reesetheone1 His gaffes were well known and well covered during his time as veep. Like his "chains" comment during 2012 campaign in NC

@DonnaFEdwards Pls don’t bring up crap like this when you ran one of the worst and dirtiest primary campaigns I can remember in 2016 and deserved to lose for the way your team went after Van Hollen, who is not Northam

@ChazNuttycombe Good. Tho many dem politicians only learned to love to hate gerrymandering after it cost them the house in 2012. Remember CA dems influenced the commission in 2011 as well as bob Brady and Dennis Kucinich cutting deals to save their own asses at the last minute in PA and OH
@Ramsey_663 Hard to know..... I do remember very well that black, Latino and Asian voters were very instrumental in passing prop 8.
@ChazNuttycombe You think Fairfax will gerrymander the state cuz AFAIK Northam was pro-redistricting commission only?
For we know the road to rebuilding our great democracy and perfecting the experiment that the founding fathers started back 1776 is not by flinching at every turn but by moving forward keeping true to ourselves and selling our ideas on the marketplace to every Tom, dick and Harry
Moderate dems can easily win primaries after this when you’ve got the usual suspects spreading the “see I toldya so abt corporate dems” crap. Time will tell tho and we who’ve seen many more moderate dems get elected up and down the ballot since then need to keep calm and carry on
Some of you who are feeling heavy hearted abt Northam and disappointed I will say I volunteered heavily for now disgraced ex-rep Ruben Kihuen back in 2016 and back then would’ve preferred him over Rosen to run against Heller. I know how you guys feel. Tho I do worry whether......
@ChazNuttycombe @ishabad Also I volunteered hard for Kihuen which doesn’t give me much to brag abt either
@ChazNuttycombe @ishabad He was the first race outside of the west coast I rly paid attention to.......
@_Political_Nerd Bobby Scott was rumored to be in line IIRC
I do worry and I hope not that Northam will be used against potential moderate dems running in other states https://t.co/cqxeaZnWHO
@marcushjohnson First since 15 after Deval left
@TheLastWord @MMFlint @AOC Stay in the 00s where you belong culturally, you're irrelevant especially after chilling with Assange while he was conspiring with Trump and Putin
Thanks CNBC for reporting on this......... https://t.co/pNSC8hcuyL
STFU....... You need to look no further than your home state for the way forward for dems and her name is Gretchen Esther Whitmer https://t.co/46ZQeZ4XUF
@Or4Now @Nancy78316588 @reesetheone1 Theres a whole generation of ppl who don't remember Anita Hill nor his record but admire him as Obamas veep
@Nancy78316588 @reesetheone1 Biden doesn't have those kind of skeletons except working with Jesse Helms whom a whole generation if not more doesn't remember who is (someone whos been dead for over a decade and last won reelection nearly a quarter century ago).......
@DanaHoule Backed the Stupak amendment IIRC
What Shannon said, also am kind of grateful that this came out now and not before because Northam set a path for other less damaged dems to follow by being a new dem instead of a leftist https://t.co/lhsK74AK9q
@EliStokols @nolesfan2011 Brown called for resignation in an interview with the Des Moines register
@dcg1114 @SenGillibrand Hard to know this early out....
@dcg1114 @SenGillibrand She said the same on pod save America the other day........
@dcg1114 @SenGillibrand The ppl who show up at such town halls this far out tend to be more progressive and passionate than the average primary voter, but its very hard to know
@polisciguy2011 @notcapnamerica I think Nina was too but somehow she became a trainwreck not long after
@notcapnamerica Dunno if Symone qualifies as in his orbit but shes definitely no grifter
@jclarks074 And that Perriellos pro-gun past killed him in black areas
@jclarks074 150% agreed........
Dont be a dick Laura........... I supported Northam myself and I don't think these shocking new allegations are a time to gloat but then again what can I expect of bernouts except not to be assholes https://t.co/2matV9Epi0
@lilbuddyspd11 @TheYoungTurks @cenkuygur Neither have I for a very long time
@lilbuddyspd11 @TheYoungTurks @cenkuygur He thinks dumb bartenders like AOC are preferable to typical politicians when shes the only one compared to the scores of non-politicians that the DCCC flipped from red to blue.
@lilbuddyspd11 @TheYoungTurks @cenkuygur I know abt Uygur being a complete dickhead.......

@LikeIGive_Adam A bit like the Joe Walsh child support scandal they discovered after he'd been elected
@LikeIGive_Adam Completely agree, tho the joke is on team Gillespie and team Perriello for completely missing this when it was in a Norfolk college library all those years.
@LikeIGive_Adam Busted for a racist college photo I guess
Dont think we can out Walz/Whitmer/Evers/JBE/Cooper/Pritzker/Cuomo/Raimondo or any new dem governor for being racist. The "we told you corporate dems are racist crowd" better STFU like 5 hours ago https://t.co/0OXX4L7zkQ

@SenhorRaposa Its an RW smear Drew, the school exists but the photo looks doctored and the blogger who posted this originally has ties to Breitbart/Daily Caller
@mcimaps I don't think Northam will resign. The posts report said the OP was someone who worked for Daily Caller/Breitbart
@virginianpilot I thought you knew better than to post RW smears by ppl who work for Breitbart/Daily Caller
@Temple91 Post confirmed that the guy who “found” the image was an ex-Daily Caller/Breitbart blogger so I think it’s an RW smear
The blackface/klan dude in the photo does not look like Northam at all, part of me wonders whether this is a RW smear attempt to salvage their likely to be gone in less than a year majority in the VA house and senate. https://t.co/Y7IfBYO3oE
@tomwatson I think this is an RW sting oppo. They're pissed abt someone in the "ole dominion" being a successful liberalish governor

@DMKSeattle @reesetheone1 FLs complicated (it’s getting a certain percentage of the white vote plus actually treating Latinos like a swing bloc and not “the base”). OH remains to be seen but IA can be won back (incumbent GOP governor almost lost, new auditor elected and 2/4 house seats flipped)

@papa_sharku Alabama is holdable with a bad candidate (Moore, Bentley, Ziegler, possibly Brooks) and Trump won't fly to AL to stump for whoever the nominee is when he's trying to run for reelection himself. If Byrnes the GOP nominee were screwed.

@Ange_Amene @BlueSteelDC @b_epdx That’s because they only heard what the bernout left had to say instead of going to Switzerland, the Netherlands or Germany which have far more in common w/ACA as originally intended than single payer. The Swiss have a public option for ppl who need w/private insurance common
@reesetheone1 @Ange_Amene @BlueSteelDC @b_epdx That’s because they bought a bunch of idiots ideas after Ossoff lost June 17. Had Northam not won on protecting the ACA who knows where we’d be at atm

@LikeIGive_Adam It’s just appreciation there tbh with ya...... Anyone but Romanoff is fine with me. His associations to David Sirota won’t help him
@OfficialClayyy I think she’s finished with local politics cuz IIRC Obama gave her the Perriello treatment and appointed her to smth in Washington.. Her 08 win was a fluke anyways as rural areas are far redder than they were in 08 and the only reason Gardner was saved is he gave Polis Ft Collins

@ChandanChintz @Patrickesque Lib dems are better than the Tories
@pommylee I completely agree. Cameron said he was gonna hold a referendum if he won a majority to appease the kippers and nobody took him seriously because they thought “Tories can’t win a majority w/o Scotland ever again”. Looking back I think Dave would’ve been the better leader of the 2

@pommylee We were distracted by far more in 09-10 than ppl remember..... Tho I think it should be made to this day.
@_Political_Nerd Dems could still win rural areas in the mid 00s plus Cubin got caught napping in 06 and open seats are much harder to defend
@pommylee We have an opportunity with the Saudis now after Khashoggi but idk whether we’ll let another chance blow away from us or not
@pommylee And they didn’t have nukes at the time. Hezbollah tbf he actually went after, they are actually quite weak compared to what they were before. Even tho everyone blames Mossad for the killing of Mughniyeh in 08, newly declassified documents show Bush and Hayden were behind it
@pommylee Iraq was largely because (these are rumors but highly likely to be true) he brought in his fathers advisors on foreign policy who he’d stopped in 1991 for going after Saddam. You’re right abt Iran tho, in 2002 Khatami was open enough to the west to be negotiated with........
@pommylee And sadly the damage it did to internationalism cannot be underestimated. The fact that bad actors could get away w/screaming “coup” whether it was a protest in Tunis, Cairo, Tripoli, Damascus, Kiev, Caracas, Tehran etc, it will take a generation to reverse this.
JFC they’re desperate https://t.co/1DbBhuAHJ0
@pommylee Looking back now it looks like many bad actors used the war to advance their careers w/o being particularly progressive (Greenwald, Sirota, Uygur)
@pommylee I’ve changed on the Iraq war as well (tho having a Kurdish friend did give me a little perspective I hadn’t had before), I’ve believed that we did the Iraqi ppl a service by getting rid of Saddam, tho there were better ways than then outright invading.
@pommylee I got that book as a Christmas present a few years ago (I think 2015 cuz IIRC it became popular again when Corbyn was elected)...... Excellent read that still makes complete sense to this day and can easily be used on modern phenomenon as well
@pommylee The guardian was notorious for promoting apologizm of him during the aughts as were several left wing politicians including Corbyn. The signs were there as far back as the mid 00s (there were already questions back then according to old articles I have since read).
@pommylee I completely agree with what you’re saying and I have wanted Maduro to leave for a long time. He and Chávez single handedly destroyed a once prosperous state..l I’m quoting this on the context of the Politico article here. I could do a whole thread on the apologists from the 00s
This article is full everything I tried to get into non-FL dems head for a few days now. The ignorance by progressives including some Latino progs like AOC is appalling.

@IAmKrishanPatel @AbrasiveObelisk @SenhorRaposa And completely failing his Latino outreach by picking a white running mate
@pommylee Seems right given that he later admitted he didn’t know what Palin was rly....... He says a lot of it had to w/someone on the campaign leaking the possibility of Lieberman as vp, effectively denying several competent ppl like ex-homeland security sec and PA gov Tom Ridge
@SenhorRaposa It’s gonna help him in 2020 if justice dem types continue their current schpiel.......
@pommylee Schmidt as well ironically given that he chose Palin. He’d been calling on the GOP to moderate years ago using the formula that reelected Schwarzenegger in 06, eventually denouncing the woman he’d helped push into the limelight

Not a good look........ https://t.co/1uKt7kz9ux
@Yukongold1898 Shit forgot abt Fairfax but precisely what I was saying....... The Black/Latino/Asian/suburban/trade union coalition is what wins us back the White House
M4A won’t help her one bit....... She’s going the Gillum/Beto/JealousAbrams route (Obama coalition on steroids) that isn’t gonna work. The coalition were gonna win back the White House with is the Northam/Whitmer/Walz/Evers coalition, especially Evers/Whitmer given their LGs https://t.co/qV7I8cuPMI

@ACMELeader @pplswar Democracy now has been a joke for a long time........

All those “you don’t like her cuz you’re a sexist pig defending Franken” idiots aren’t laughing now are they........ I hate Gillibrand apologists even more now. I told ya she was a useless blond opportunist https://t.co/fq31VSelse
@jackjonesbabe Chris Hayes is a Bernie Bro tho
Tone deaf statements like these is why I’m a no on Gillibrand atm...... Beto did plenty to elect dems in his home state (stumping with Garcia, Fletcher, Escobar and Allred). IIRC I don’t remember seeing Gillibrand stumping with Delgado, Rose, and Brindisu.... https://t.co/6M3spuiH0A
Thanks Wakefield and Jenny McCarthy https://t.co/H2VDSIGBZr
@pommylee I completely agree.......... It was kind of obvious before AOC, they were all in for a far left candidate for governor of Michigan in the fall of 17. The only center-left wonks they’ve ever interviewed are Neera and Jake Sullivan (both of whom I think are great)
@pommylee It looks like here at least mainstream liberals have had enough of some of them, Daily Kos is backing a primary against Gabbard for example, and them stumbling in multiple safe seats no doubt helped as well
Definitely not surprised........ And this was before she beat Crowley. Proves how much of the joke being on him her rise is....... For being such a Hillary Clinton fan (2x early endorser)   Joe should’ve stood with us and turned us out instead of appeasing them https://t.co/cFFbgFKOwr

@MatthewMcCrac18 @davidfrum @CaracasChron Completely wrong..... Venezuela analysis is run by someone married to the Chavista propaganda machine while Caracas Chronicles is run by real Venezuelans
This is what Frum actually was saying. Those of my fellow resisters who are attacking him for allegedly supporting Howard Schultz by reading the tweet and not the actual article pls STFU. This man has been a GOP “internal” critic for a long time and actually voted for Hillz in 16 https://t.co/iFnJ91MOI7

@MaggyW5 Agreed, but we cannot deny the trophy to its rightful owner, had she won she would’ve got that spot long ago
@chrislhayes Would prefer someone who won tho.....
She would be good, but any of the #bluewave victors would be better like Whitmer, Hill, Davids, Finkenauer and Sinema with DMP doing the Spanish response https://t.co/2yYvNedAfd

@subawashi @SenhorRaposa They held on a lot of places well into the 00s. As recently as 2011 we had dems from Arkansas and SE Oklahoma. Our last majority had a lot of blue dogs from SWPA, WV, TN, MS and rural GA
@subawashi @SenhorRaposa Local dems who did well on local issues like Ag....... Had a lot to do with the farm crisis in the 80s that elected former senate dem leader Daschle who built a machine

My take on this rumor. I’m not surprised and nor are many dems. Crowley was a jovial Irish guy who many dems believe was unfairly targeted by just us dems because he was close to Pelosi and a 2x Hillz backer who was a well liked member of the delegation 		https://t.co/0WO9H0YhO8

@reesetheone1 K gill said the same thing on pod save America..... My prediction of Trump being reelected is holding up quite well
@politicsluo Thats very similar to what they have in some European countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany IIRC
@LKoerber889 Im critiquing some fo her supporters for saying stuff like "guys stay out of this", or statements implying that Kamala should have the field to herself. Shes in my top 5 but as of right now I am undecided af (except for no Bernie/Tulsi/Warren) and kinda proud of it
Agree on everything but the last one Jon......... https://t.co/QjHHZJ2ZU0

@witliftin In the end it depends on the economy.........
Average ppl don't like tax hikes unless being told specifically what its for and Kamala understands this.

@queerBengali Its only January 2019 ffs..... I supported Hillary Clinton so don't @ me abt anointing ppl. I get that Kamala has enthusiasm but that doesn't anyone who isnt as well (Klobuchar, Brown, Booker, Beto) should be denied their chance at taking a shot
@queerBengali I and many others have a right to be undecided atm.......
If you follow this idiot keep in mind he's doing everything to clear the field for Bernie. Theres a reason they hate Cory and Hakeem as well, both worked to pass real bipartisan criminal justice reform while (as usual) Bernie didnt do jack shit. https://t.co/eVEvEIvap6
Proves how out of touch DSA gentrifiers are with reality. Most if not democratic voters do not like Wall Street bankers, but even fewer view the nomination as corporatist v progressive.

@marcushjohnson Bernies already condemned Maduro quite publicly, Warren has nothing to gain politically by attacking the sanctions except peeling off tankies who are already all in for anyone whos a green. Most dems running for the presidency will touch on this when they come to FL tho
Anyone who knows Berkeley/gentrified Oakland well knows that its full of Bernie bros, I don't think it will happen if Kamala holds a speech in a less democratic area https://t.co/ZXidRaRTjp
@Ramsey_663 @mariaso1200 @SheltieMac Florida’s still a tossup atm, what should be more concerning is Latino outreach by the GOP, Trumps acting fast on Venezuela to get Scott/Desantis numbers in Dade
@Ramsey_663 @mariaso1200 @SheltieMac I expect them fully to rig TX, FL, OH and GA...... AZ we got lucky due to the dem SOS winning as well as the whole Midwest
Do not underestimate Schmidt. He has a very good political pulse knack, he knew that the GOP establishment was hated when he chose Palin, he bailed out the terminator when everyone thought he would lose in 06. He called for the GOP to reform in 09 and hates the tea party. https://t.co/5z4nxQvWgf

@DrawFairLines @alfonslopeztena Things have gotten so bad in Venezuela that some dissidents even want it inside of VZ...... Tho a poll taken last year showed 2/3s of Venezuelans wanted Maduro out but not many (only 1/3) were keen on US intervention.
My rep tells it like it is, sometimes we have to fight to win the battle of ideas https://t.co/wn2bIwKzN0
@SheltieMac True indeed, Dave warned Bush was incompetent well before 9/11, he knew Romney would lose, that the tea party was toxic. He even said had the 04 campaign gone on a few weeks later Bush would’ve lost. Also warned someone was gonna take advantage of rust belt decline in 2014
Democrats better read the article before attacking Frum here. The truth is going very far left will get Trump reelected.

@Ramsey_663 Well, they’ve never set foot outside of NY or DC....... If dems want to win in 2020 they’ll have to head up to St. Paul, Madison or Lansing for a chat with Walz, Evers or Whitmer
@Ramsey_663 “Just another example of white male privelege” while the majority of Americans saw it as just another very good reason to eh cynical abt Washington, the dems rode that “Fuck Washington” sentiment with a good dose of kitchen table issues. They’re misreading America completely
@Ramsey_663 Same with Gillibrand sadly, the ppl who say “men don’t run, you’ve owned this country too long” are handing Trump his reelection when he most needs it. Also they do not realize what the silent majority of Americans thought after Kavanaugh, to them the Kavanaugh circus was........
@Ramsey_663 I think ppl who are backing her dont understand America and have learned nothing from 16 and completely misread 18. They think tripling down on identity politics works when the women that won (Whitmer, Rosen, Kelly, Mills, Sinema, MLG) focused mostly on kitchen table issues
@Ramsey_663 I think being cool at netroots won't get you the nomination like it did in 08. Amy or Brown have a better chance of being POTUS than many ppl realize. Kamala and Kirsten would piss off huge parts of America that are open to voting dem. I think many dems are misreading 2018 badly
I like Kamala Harris and proudly voted for her twice (was too young to vote when she first ran in 2010), however Mark is right, let us win it on the merits and let anybody get in whos a good actor, I don't care if they white, black, man, woman, gay, straight, may the best one win https://t.co/W1dZ0DKSC8
@CindyVVideo @regwag2003 I really don’t know, tho CA is an semi-open primary state so she wouldn’t have to. Many Bernie or busters here are indys
What @DavidAFrench alluded to in The Atlantic the other day.

@Ramsey_663 I myself am a proud resister yet I am getting a little tired of the Kamala cult......... Agreed. I don't think they get that a huge portion of the country is tired of division and partisanship and hates identity politics and many of those ppl are independents who would be open

@ghost_ready Where in the bay are you at?
As the great Winston Churchill once said "We will fight them on the beaches, we will fight them on the landing grounds, we will fight them in the fields and in the streets, we will fight them in the hills, we will never surrender" and that's a motto to keep this #residtance going
And I fear will try to smear Kamala Harris on her home turf......... The truth is it sadly may be too late to save the CDP (who knows and I still have hope despite the letdowns), but we must never give up in keeping our party in good hands with good actors running it, because....
Pls anyone run but Ellis and De Leon as they would do nothing but further continue the post-2015 damage instigated by activists..... I also worry that Ellis could do major damage on Super Tuesday as shes part of the "woke blacks" in Oakland that are out of touch w/most blacks....
For state assembly which was one of the worst races ive ever worked in...... It seems like we have few options at this point except to wait and see. I hope more mainstream leaders like @sfpelosi distance themselves from the vile conduct of Ellis and instead vote for someone else.
@ghost_ready I know, I tried to raise the alarm with fellow dems, but stopped some of it in #ad16 which has always had a more pragmatic dem party (Tauscher machine largely)
Kimberley Ellis whos basically the East Bays Nina Turner........ She cannot become chair because of her behavior and conduct including suing the CDP to try to get installed after losing by a razor thin margin (69 out of 3000 delegates). She also intervened in a contested race....

Choose delegates to the convention. Sadly Bernouts saw this as an opportunity to hijack the party and launched their own "anti-establishment" slates. Sadly many of em have been winning like open DSA members winning in #ad22.... In my district (#ad16) less progressive slates......
Last November here in CA was bittersweet as party chair Eric Bauman was outsted under a cloud of scandal as we were celebrating our major gains in the #bluewave which means this June we will be picking his replacement. The process works that assembly district chapters meet and...
Dear fellow resisters who are anti-Bernie, ive got a question for ya, don't just run for office if you want to but also become a party member and vote in internal party elections cuz smth alarming is happening here in the Bay Area that I want to talk abt, as some of you know.....
@mitchellscomet Agreed, she’s a complete bitch herself
@mcbyrne @KamalaHarris @neeratanden Many California dems know Steiner is awful trash and has been for a long time....... She sunk many progressives chances by backing them including a well rounded businesswomans chance to outst the CA GOP minority leader in a Hillary-won seat that overlaps Levins district
I disagree with Melissa on many things internally including on 2020, however she is right in calling out useless old bitch Lauren Steiner for her awful tweet. It isnt Neeras fault at all. She has been a conspiracy bird ive known abt for a long time who Ive warned others abt https://t.co/TO99ht1cAI

@JSapp_AR @_WeStandUnited @dailykos And even tho I like pod save America, I think all 4 of them are willfully ignoring any problems on the left, refusing to condemn Greenwald et al at any point, chilling with Mcelwee/Barkan/Kelton etc., and using the lefts language sometimes as well as attacking Hillary multiple x
@reesetheone1 My ticket for now is Klobuchar/Harris
@JSapp_AR @_WeStandUnited @dailykos Or at least had the Obamaworld attitude of “let’s make peace with and appease the far left”........
This isn’t a unicorn thing, many south Florida Latinos are offended by sentiments among parts of the left including those with no sympathy for Chavez....... If we ignore Venezuela and don’t call out the ones spreading BS abt Venezuela we will lose Miami Dade https://t.co/lDF5xfN5Z8
@JSapp_AR @_WeStandUnited @dailykos Markos is against Bernie running and so are many of its members, likely Bernie plagating the dem infrastructure as usual

If Yaschas behind than I will admit I underestimated my own junior senator.

Including some of their own left wing who screamed "we cant just be anti-Trump" for a long time while they witnessed us winning from Issaquah to La Jolla to Miami to Bangor..... The ppl were motivated all the way back in 2017 to #dumptrump https://t.co/frxYHV0cee

Finally useless conspiracy bitch Lauren Steiner (who I've warned abt for awhile given the crap shes spread on youtube)....... Gets owned by the #neverbernie ppl hard. Anyways why do bernouts spread the article from a conservative troll site instead of sharing the original? https://t.co/s64sIKBoXD
Bragging abt being part of a failed group is why many of us resisters still aren’t sold on you......... You may be a young beautiful badass woman but you’re still owned by bernouts, and don’t forget you made it due to low turnout, a split primary and an incumbent who fucked up https://t.co/8qtudL00gs

@Mel_Ankoly There were many who didn’t before 2016.... I had the foresight as a teenager to know that the GOP could come roaring back, Garamendi the guy I’d volunteered for in the fall of 09 barely scraping by was a warning sign and this is in the Bay Area
@Mel_Ankoly I was too young to vote back then but was able to pressure my parents to do so as my mom hated Arnold and supported Brown at the time... Also having been on my first campaign a year earlier (#ca11 special to replace Tauscher) I knew my then congressman McNerney was vulnerable
Also doing well in suburban areas, not getting blown out in SD, OC, Ventura, SFV and parts of the Bay (including the tri valley where I lived) allowed her to win a razor thin margin in 2010......... https://t.co/9HmgCcoMuZ
@Meghan_BB_ Completely agree and it’s why I became allergic to progressives due to shit like this. Had someone who watched me when I was in elementary school (early 00s) who had a Nader sticker on her car which also did me in early on
Again Bhaskar is as truthful now as when he told the Tribune staffers he wouldn’t fire them. The truth is that the wonks on the are indeed behind Warren as of now but the activists actually seem to be behind Harris atm. Center left wonks could back anyone atm tho https://t.co/QaEpKgCLlb
@jackcurran49 Shows you how much damage 187 did to the CA GOP if you look at CAs Dole-Clinton counties
This is why I was warning ppl abt the far left in 2016. My family knew ppl in Berkeley like this dude here who's likely an older hippie or a stuck up trust fund baby (mom knew latter I knew former). Living in the Bay Area gave me an allergy to leftism long before Bernie Bros https://t.co/OpuOWbJdG1
@OfficialClayyy I agree but id be very surprised if Stanton went for it.......
The man on the left made this possible dimwit.......... Unemployment is rising under Trump https://t.co/nM9YWcP6ys
He’s running. Definitely a dark horse to watch https://t.co/DljpOruR4p
@OfficialClayyy He would be but he’s too careful AFAIK, he passed up running for Governor before Sinema even entered the senate race. Hard to know I’d support, I like all of em tho. Grant is excellent but his GOP past could hurt in a primary, Gallego is better but might be a little too liberal
@IAmKrishanPatel Do not underestimate huge parts of the midwest plus PA and MD having after Super Tuesday..........
@OfficialClayyy Hell yeah...... Probably Woods, Gallego, Stanton and Kelly are probably jumping up and down with glee right now and I can envision Mcsally being like "WTF"

@CoolGreenPines @sandralhanlon However I think a lot of his support among my generation wasn’t his policies or anti-establishmentness at all. There was an anti-status quo attitude among my cohort but not blowing up the system. Also naivete as well “there can only be more unmitigated progress and no setbacks”
@CoolGreenPines Thanks.......
@CoolGreenPines @sandralhanlon I think many Bernie supporters have underestimated how much of his primary vote was anti-Clinton, to an extent anti-Obama instead of pro-him. He’s more unpopular than a lot of ppl realize....... Ppl haven’t forgiven him for 2016
@Patrickesque Amy Klobuchar
As a dem since before I could vote (2006 or so, as I hated Bush) and at age 24 I absolutely hate Bernie and know that most who aren’t prep school boys don’t either. Many of us millennials want someone new peirod. https://t.co/xaOjCHMGyF
@roon0292 Me too but the Hudson Valley has more in common with Ohio culturally than it does NYC. Personally I’m leaning toward Harris, Klobuchar or Brown (Brown would be my number 1 if we didn’t risk that senate seat). I want someone from the west as well as that’s where were growing atm
@roon0292 Gillibrand has so much potential but should immediately ditch Sean Mcelwee as an advisor. He’s just as bad as Mark Penn if not worse
@roon0292 I’m cautiously so, the recent announcements are giving mixed signals as Gillibrand is stressing her rural roots/bipartisanship and Kamalas taken the pragmatic route in terms of frontrunners I had concerns abt in terms of caving. It shows that Gillibrand hired ex-DCCC spox as well
@roon0292 True......
@roon0292 The Miami-Dade young GOP attempted to tie DMP to several of these members for a reason
@roon0292 Given some dems reactions from the midterms results and the fact that even someone I thought was moderate (Buttigieg) are embracing fiscally irresponsible crap like M4A and the GND. Also the Venezuela statements from certain new members and the silence from others is worrying
Underrated point from Drew....... Trump is in better shape than ppl realize especially with the race to the left among every candidate announced tho I don't think Amy will go down that route. The right candidate can beat Trump but Ive got a bad feeling abt 2020 https://t.co/mC4wX0Ewgi
Rting a long thread here abt Ilhan being untrustworthy..... IDK why the ppl of #mn05 supported her at all when 2 excellent progressives got beat in the primary. We need to be unafraid to use such a record against ppl even if we will be attacked as "islamophobic" https://t.co/3Hdbq8wnmP

@OfficialClayyy Tho Amy entering could scramble the race completely...... Even dems aren’t down on Gillibrand and I don’t see Booker winning. Tho Kamala seems to have taken the pragmatic route when it comes to ideology
Sadly true, and it’s what Bernie Sanders supporters wanted aka a coup d etat https://t.co/bKywdGRCvp

Even my uncle and aunt in #ma07 knew Cap wasn’t that good a campaigner. Also I’ve wondered at times if Crowley would’ve won had Cuomo been on the ballot on the same day and I’d say it’s very possible due to low info voters voting for Crowley when they came out for Cuomo https://t.co/A5QqCJE1xl

I hope @joshstein_ is reading this and on the phone with donors for a 2020 run https://t.co/HwfpAoY7lt
@atDavidHoffman @HIHKatharine To quote his fave rapper “now I ain’t sayin she’s a gold digger”.......
This primary gonna be a shitshow is all I can say....... Bernie acting like a dick around SCs black voters who already despise him, nuff said https://t.co/QiVgWBleaN
Looks like flipping the VA house and senate is a foregone conclusion at this point https://t.co/j1jwqw2bJY
@msleen1970 @ChrisMurphyCT He and Duckworth are probably the best candidates not running
@reesetheone1 Hope she has Amy on again sooner rather than later
This my friends is why real dems don't give up. We have made it unacceptable for anyone openly pro-Russia or a Putin apologist to win a primary and even forced loud mouths AOC/Tlaib/Khanna into a corner on this issue. We will never give up period		https://t.co/B91vlse6HN
@magi_jay Status quo basically is a nicer way of saying I’d love to see everything blown ffs as well as bein the same for fuck democracy, fuck everyone but bratty lil me
Sarah tells it like it is........ We must oppose antisemitism no matter who attempts it https://t.co/e0IA6sEVws
@phil_mckraken @tomwatson @dailykos Tho as for POTUS I’m undecided except #NeverBernie
@phil_mckraken @tomwatson @dailykos IIRC Trump made far more an issue of “emailgate” and whatever crap (her health f.ex.) the RW fever swamps cooked up than Iraq
@phil_mckraken @tomwatson @dailykos Biden had his reputation salvaged by Obama that’s why. Young ppl don’t associate him with Iraq or Anita Hill at all which is why he does reasonably well among them. I don’t think the Iraq war will be a relavant issue in 2020 just like it wasn’t in the 16 primary
Why I don’t trust JD/OR/BNC in one pic.  RTs Green Party’s veep in 08 aka someone who chilled with crank and antisemite Cynthia McKinney as well as double ratfucker Susan Sarandon and spoil king Ralph Nader. Clemente also supports multiple fringe positions like PR independence https://t.co/1pMpp1oBml
#muelleriscoming...... Anyone who thinks Trump will escape any scrutiny this time is wrong https://t.co/BdzSgMqRLc
What’s even more striking is many progressive activists who are resisters and voted for Hillz in 16 and like Obama would’ve laughed at me if  I said in 2013 “in less than a decade, Glenn will be a Fox regular while some conservatives will be on MSNBC” https://t.co/9Ge4Gzy3h7

@Glitchy_Ashburn @TheStagmania They'll blame Max Baucus and Evan Bayh when Lieberman did far more damage there.......... Wonder why they were willing to go after vulnerable red state dems like Bayh, Nelson, Baucus and Conrad when everyone knows Joe Lieberman basically killed the public option from day 1

@jackjonesbabe They really are incompetent...... Thought getting the media onboard a primary in Delaware wouldnt get Delawarans to turn out against them. They think ousting Cuellar on likely hight turnout Super Tuesday works. Not to mention their backing of numerous bad candidates
That puts another candidate along with Gillibrand and Warren in the category of "would vote for against Trump but not my cup of tea in the primary" due to chilling with this baby faced charlatan https://t.co/M84vVpm3Dn

My take on 2020. Let everyone who’s qualified for the job run and see how they do. Tbh with ya I don’t care if they’re white, black, Latino, man, woman etc. Just show me if your able to beat Trump and you got my vote. Except for Bernie and Tulsi that is as I don’t want them pls

@LeslieEscoto2 @AOC At least vice did a documentary on Hill...... I think part of it is because the media lives in the NYC bubble.....
@LeslieEscoto2 @AOC And it doesn’t help that the media’s literally drooling all over her...... If you didn’t know better you wouldn’t know that this freshman class had much more competent young members like Hill, Allred, Finkenauer, Lamb, Rose, Underwood and Harder

Stop complaining bout low turnout and fighting for POC when you won your race w/14% turnout IIRC which was off the backs of gentrifiers in Astoria/LIC and barnstormed across the country for Bernie bros against Davids/Murphy and didn’t help Ayanna up in Boston at the same time https://t.co/hs4jxIFX2l
Dave is sadly telling the truth...... Our “president” is making it OK to be an asshole instead of young men like me aspiring for the best like putting his country before himself with pride and devotion, like leading by example instead of being a fucking hypocrite. A must read https://t.co/FgpiTtLHX3
This is getting ridiculous......  Beto supported both @Lizzie4Congress and @lacongresista when he was in H-town and endorsed @vgescobar to replace him when he ran for senate.

This article shows here why #abolishice isnt gonna work...... While progressives don't get it because they don't know their own country they love to hate. The sad truth is its immigration, not taxes and guns that turns out the GOP base and some independents https://t.co/4H2yFg8HT0
@bluebirdofunhap @SenGillibrand Tho from what it seems from what I hear in Chicago, some may have moved to a smaller march out in Aurora where at least Casten, Underwood and Krishnamoorthi were speaking
@bluebirdofunhap @SenGillibrand Agreed, and would possibly attend mine in San Francisco if these idiots abandoned ship and let local orgs keep it local under a new name

@Amy_Siskind Our best shots are Gardner, Mcsally, Tillis, Perdue, Ernst, Cornyn and Collins FYI
They use it because they don't want to admit that they are among the 3% of POC who are progressives or 6% who are conservatives. A study showed that most POC are either liberal, moderate or unaffiliated and don't feel like nothing is getting done for them https://t.co/IRjaBeTCCH

@LikeIGive_Adam Completely agree, tho some that ran are ppl I’m fine with, many have shady ties or are into conspiracy theories which is a red line for me (establishment wants war with Russia I saw on several ex-just us dems)
@LikeIGive_Adam Yeah, also wrote a ridiculous op-ed abt Hillary last December IIRC
@AOC Cosponsor #hr8...... You need to honor the march for our lives kids and make #ny14 proud
Well these same political scientists aren't looking at any factors besides her to this #bluewave like the rise of social media (insta and snap didnt exist in 2010) and the fact that Hillz cracked some huge marks in that glass ceiling https://t.co/vavOfpgWLU

@CanadianKansan The former I’m not surprised by cuz what I’ve heard from family over there (largely center-right leaning tho) Venstre and SV were for legalizing dual citizenship before there was a push in the other parties back in 2016.
Putin wants to keep his biggest asset in 1600 Pennsylvania no matter whay https://t.co/PRHroPcsA4
@CanadianKansan They both have a similar very urbane, cosmopolitan coalition tho Venstre always gets extra votes from well off suburbanites in the well off parts of Oslo and its rich suburbs who'd rather labour not return to government (they usually vote for the center right Høyre mostly)

@SusanSarandon @nytimes Tell me why anybody should listen to a stuck up bitch like you ever again?

If we do get too woke..... A plurality of my generation identifies as moderate and is not that politically correct. Reason I’m pointing this out is I don’t want a repeat of 2016
My take on Gen Z (my lil brothers generation) is that the GOP blew a major opportunity in reinventing itself by nominating Donald Trump..... A healthy 2 party democracy has appeal to every generation. I do warn dems that yes my generation and the generation under could shift..... https://t.co/zuKSx12Amv
@AnnaNotaro22 @Deoliver47 @KevinMKruse @AlexisCoe @AOC Said on another thread that this cycles Chisholm/Jordan are Haaland/Davids
Ted and Dingell the elder have owned twitter w/o embracing a far left unelectable agenda and haven’t you guys missed Betomania.

@politicsluo The rev wright issue, but IIRC it was nowhere near the scandals mentioned by others, Palins Couric interview was more the “campaign ending moment” that cycle

@_WeStandUnited @PWM62 Sharice and Deb are fare more the equivalents of Chisholm/Jordan today
@queerBengali Completely agree, everyone in the field but Gabbard can be trusted on my radar in terms of merits and on patriotism. They no matter what background is qualified in their own way no matter if they’re a woman or a man, if they’re black or white etc. And Kirstens not in my top 5 atm
@queerBengali I don’t think this was coincidental, the senate voted on cloture the day before, so he knew. Gillibrand meanwhile was flying back and forth across the country cuz she knew the vote was one that will go down in history on whether you’re for real on this great republic of ours
My longtime rep tell it like it is https://t.co/AjHQx1082c
@queerBengali I will never forgive him for arranging that meeting while the senate was voting on Russia
The worst part is that Bernie managed to piss off 2 birds w/1 stone. He did this while the senate was voting to deny the lifting of Russian sanctions https://t.co/UID96RzRy5

@RyanLankford Anyone backed by Gillibrand AFAIK, Whitmer ran the most kitchen table campaign of anybody and I don’t think Gillibrand given her background and opportunism is capable of sticking to her guns in that case in running a type of campaign which won us back seats and can beat Trump.
@RyanLankford Well done, I never attended any of em, (was working a critical shift the day of the original in SF and quickly learned abt their toxicity not long afterwards). Gillibrands launch isn’t looking good. Talking bout Whitmer when she actually ran the least feminist campaign of.....

Priorities should be		1. Gardner	2. Mcsally	3. Tillis	4. Perdue	5. Collins	6. Cornyn 	7. Murky	8. Toomey	9. Burr	10. Alexander https://t.co/KscBHhyMxP
@LeslieEscoto2 And thank god for that, just in time as well I can’t even think abt how insufferable MSNBC would’ve been without getting a little sick. Even Maddow failed and she’s been good for a long time (invited the guy who’s now AOCs COS to discuss JD in May 16)
@jackcurran49 He’s definitely a 1oak
@LeslieEscoto2 He did a lot of damage in 2010 so MSNBC realized it then, tho I don’t think they realized how stupid the Morning Joe crew; Tweety, Bernie Bro Hayes and to an extent Putinist Schultz would be
@LikeIGive_Adam @SenhorRaposa Not bad, problem with CA is basically were spoiled for talent that could probably be used in many states, tho my top choice would be Swalwell (a little biased since my rep) who’d likely be the first millennial in the senate unless Finkenauer successfully beats Ernst

@nktpnd Congratulations......
Yourselves lucky if Jew hater Tlaib doesn’t draw a challenge from an ambitious black woman like lame duck former rep Brenda Jones who’lol have Duggan and labor backing especially if she keeps bashing GM and chilling with Jew haters.
I’ll just say finally to the just us dems, consider yourselves lucky AF. You had your window of opportunity you got your flagship runway model, but the era of you guys escaping scrutiny is over get ready for the new life nobody will be scrutinized like them. Anyways also consider
Conyers was busted under last years #metoo circus and Ellison retired during the filing deadline as well as getting 3 incumbents onboard. I would consider them very lucky if they mangage to outst Cuellar given that TX shares all its primaries on one day (Super Tuesday)......
Best interest at heart. They thought taking on the Reid, Madigan and Hawaiian machines with a one-size-fits-all message would work. They thought taking on popular longtime senators and governors would work, guess what both failed. If you ask me they caught a lucky break when.....
@msleen1970 I know, tho someone with the genius and the money should be dumping ads in NC, GA, possibly TX literally pummeling there jokes of senators up in 2020 on this. Especially given Cornyns background as a prosecutor
Crap spewed by the putincept every day didn’t get more attention than it did. They don’t know that AOC was their peak and with more attention comes more scrutiny. Going after vulnerable seat dems in WV, FL and NV didn’t help their case either and proves they don’t have dems......
Dems needed with these guys, save for a brand name change that Cenk executed, they seriously misunderstood their own party and seriously underestimated where the vibe was post-16. We were very lucky we stopped other attempts pre-AOC (#nv04, #wvsen) and very lucky the anti DCCC...
I hate conspiracy theories yet I’m increasingly wondering if AOC was step one of a hostile takeover attempt, her closeness to TYT/JD/BNC leadership and the fact that she seems to pop up in every promo of theirs. I personally think that Trump winning was the wake up call real....
@msleen1970 What’s even worse is Murkowski who allegedly has nothing to fear sold out her country......
@roon0292 I was dunking on him back in 2010 before it was cool.
@roon0292 Preach, it must be so awful for that buffalo to live in la la land
Lots of ex-pols get hired by media idiot...... Look at Donna Edwards for example. The novelty has worn off on Bernie and ppl have moved on https://t.co/8EQCBhvqm8
@msleen1970 Basically forcing us to rely on the GOP even more...... Wish dems would hammer Tillis and Perdue hard on this for not voting for this as compensation so were not relying on that idiot
Bernie screwed over the republic like he always does...... Fuck him for making us rely on another republican to secure 60 votes. Had he been on board, we could've bullied Tillis, Perdue or Murky to support this........ https://t.co/S9VR4LyWgi

@ZerlinaMaxwell @connie_rodeconn @SenGillibrand I’m not a fan of Gillibrand and I think the allegations against Bernie are ruining the reputations of campaigns and the experiences you learn and new ppl you meet and even develop feelings for. He festered a toxic environment that doesn’t represent our part
@mkraju Hope some of em can knock some sense in his head especially Gonzalez who reps a border district and Suozzi, Gottheimer and Philips having major airports near or in their districts as TSA workers need a break.
@hsterne @Axels15 @mkraju *resistancey
@hsterne @Axels15 @mkraju Staten Island and Bay Ridge aren’t exactly resistances places
Good luck but don’t get your hopes up tho I hope Gonzalez can knock some sense into Trumps head abt the border wall as nobody messes with Texas. https://t.co/kfvtOcJDPK
“There’s smth that don’t smell quite right with our main man Donald Trump”. As the months wore on, summer turned to fall and it got colder, Trump kept rising and my feed got more virulent in terms of sharing anti-Hillary/Pro-Bernie memes on both Face and Insta as time went on....
Started on the GOP smear campaign abt her emails that dominated the entire fucking campaign that the media knew they wanted to use against her while being played by Trump like fiddles...... In August 15 I was on vacation in PV and told a friend while at a party down there......
By Vladimir Putin and his cronies. Tho I will say I muttered “he’s after the West” after MH17 went down in the summer of 14. I also witnessed the media basically giving blowing Donald Trump at every second possible while spreading the Hillz email nothingburger don’t get me.......
Truth is she's not as despised as Cuomo upstate and had residual strength in 2012 from her time as a blue dog rep in the Hudson Valley https://t.co/RhavPSHAl9
As 2015 wore on I began smelling smth funny regarding both Trump and Bernie. Bernie somehow was able to go from a nobody to a viral trend like he'd been posted on youtube within 2 months. I did think Bernie was indeed a fad but didnt realize so many ppl had been duped back then..
@RickPetree Just want dems to understand all of America and using it as a metaphor to warn us to leave our bubble and talk to people from diverse ends of this great nation. I had a feeling Trump would win when I was in Sarasota over Columbus Day on vacation and saw nothing but Trump signs...
@reesetheone1 Methinks that Amy wins in an upset because of this in IA for this very reason
Another Acela dude who thinks he run the world....... Joe won in a state that voted 2 to 1 for Trump which is a feat we should applaud not deplore, he's not Lieberman in terms of actively spiting the party despite living in a favorable state for dems https://t.co/Xd6dLRGNt5
@reesetheone1 Even my bluish district couldnt be won by somebody like her at all...... I love Swalwell and wish every district had their own version of him
@CHURCHLADY320 Bingo..... Many (like Haley Stevens) are already holding town halls back home.
Black dude, not a single Latino, not a single Asian whatsoever given that every minority I know loved Obama and I live in a pretty diverse yet well off area. Furthermore things got even stranger the minute Trump was rolling down that escalator on 06/16/15 as we all know.......
@CHURCHLADY320 Which is why I won’t trade my rep for anyone else...... He may be on TV all the time but I love seeing him in the district with his young family at times
@CHURCHLADY320 Who knows hope she stays local

All the ppl who said Trump was the anti corporatists can head down to the sex shop buy themselves anything to go fuck themselves with hard.

@PWM62 From the day he became a US citizen
@PWM62 I’m well aware of that. There’s a reason my grandpa left a part of Norway called “the red county” where May Day parades and Moskovitches were common sights and was a Republican until 08 (tho did vote dem downballot sometimes)
@PWM62 I’m well aware of it, even my deep blue district wouldn’t vote for a socialist
@PWM62 Well aware of that
@shuboogie Candidate with good aide from The Putincept in that regard. It got so bad that the CA dem chair had to intervene and organize a truce plus it  gave Paul Ryan polo against Cisneros). The truth is in law “you’re innocent until presumed otherwise IIRC”
@PWM62 Agreed
@shuboogie As I’ve learned in CA politics is that you have to wait for the evidence. In the last year alone we had to false #meToo accusations (Senator Bob Hertzberg has a hitjob done on him by the cash bail industry and now rep-Gil Cisneros had a hitjob done on him by an OR-backed.....
@shuboogie It’s because so many of em live in a bubble where men are considered evil and being woke isn’t a detriment. I’ve knocked on doors in swingy parts of both CA and NV since a 2009 special election in my area and I find that there was a lot of concern abt false accusations

@phanthanhtom @SenhorRaposa Had forgotten that, which is why we should sue in state court abt those lines

@eclecticbrotha I wouldn’t hold my breath
Many just us dems and ppl who tried to emulate them (looking at u Beto, Abrams, Gillum and Jealous plus a few defeated primary candidates in the heartland) have generally lost. Moving to the Middle works period
That everyone who doesn’t fit his sham scores is right wing and out of touch as if the progressive Mike Capuano and liberal Joe Crowley were both (Joe was daft and out of touch, Cap wasn’t as strong as ppl thought but that was far more with ppl liking both than him being hated)..
@PhilRevard I’m not saying it as my opinion I’m saying what I’ve heard both directly and indirectly as a longtime volunteer in bot CA and NV
Finally what’s the most concerning is her usage of sham pollster Sean Mcelwee as an internal pollster..... This is a man who’s a just us dems ally thru and thru and even coauthored a “report” with them. He thinks M4A and Abolish ICE are popular (they aren’t). He also believes....
@pommylee That’s not quite what I’m doing, I’m pointing out she doesn’t have that broad appeal and there are concerns I have abt her bid.
@PhilRevard Ppl who don’t think the Al Franken situation was handled properly and lacked due process
Talk to every corner of America and ask them what’s on their mind and sell relevant kitchen table issues and opportunity as priority no.1 while bashing the GOP with a smile. That my friends is how a certain Barack Obama was able to win 2 back to back terms in both 08 and 12
Last but not least I will say that who knows what my take could look like 12 months down the line but anyone who thinks that Gillibrand is ideal or that Frankens defenders are sexists are deluding themselves to the same failure that cost us dearly in 14 and 16. We win when we....
Are gonna give us the nomination mark my words. The no east coast dem will be heard louder and clearer down the line as almost none of em know how to win a tough election.
The sad truth is that winning the presidency will be on merits, kitchen table issues and a contrast to Trump. One final thing I will say is that the track record for east coast dems winning for both POTUS and veep has been 0/14 since JFK. The south, the Midwest and the west.....
Among indys we need to win who went for Obama in 12, Trump in 16 but flipped back to us this cycle. Openly being “the feminist candidate” didn’t win us back a single seat. All the women who won last cycle focused on there resume and kitchen table issues “fix the damn roads”......
POTUS in awhile. She supported Abolish ICE and bashed the Clintons AFAIK based on opportunism not principles, same reason she was a blue dog while repping the Hudson Valley. Also her “I’m a righteous feminist” attitude isn’t gonna sit well with huge parts of America especially...
@Ramsey_663 @peterdaou Completely agree and I’ve lived abroad myself
@CHURCHLADY320 Which puts her heavy on the “Donna Edwards alert”...... Edwards constituency services (or lack thereof) cost her deeply when she ran for #mdsen in 2016 despite her being a progressive darling
As Clintonworld could support her but with a bad taste in their mouth as everyone who’s knifed the Clintons hasn’t been treated well by them afterwards. Also she’s not very principled and seems to have a more “go-with-the-flow” approach than anyone I’ve ever seen running for.....

Leftists who live abroad and write for foreign media do not know their home country at all......... Has she ignored who won the midterms and who flipped seats from red to blue in Obama-Trump and Romney-Clinton areas? Trump could be reelected yes but it isn’t a given atm https://t.co/oZEQkTowyh

Hillz. won’t. want. to. talk. abt. an. ancient. affair. and. would. support. Gillibrand. if. she. hadn’t. knifed. her. man. and. crossing. the. queen. is. a. big. no-no. in. many. dems. book https://t.co/8fPWtc3cam
@shuboogie That’s my concern with her is that she only goes with the flow as much as possible and doesn’t come up with her own ideas. I don’t think the ppl who say “Frankens a nothingburger” understand America nor segments of the dem base. Because of both Trump could easily beat her
On that note I might be willing to give Gillibrand a second chance....... Talking kitchen table issues won us back 400 or so seats up and down the ballot and is gonna win us back 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because in my experience that is what average joes and janes care abt https://t.co/ZhU11HbU82

@Kat41150B @PurpleReign14 The media hasn’t learned jack shit from 2016 so idk abt some of them. Tho I have wondered if they thought an attractive girl from the media capital of the world would be a good PR tool to advance their agenda in a media full of useful idiots to MAGA/Bernouts

You idiots don’t get that they interviewed a senator from NH where AOC definitely wouldn’t get elected and is critical to winning back 1600 Pennsylvania https://t.co/FyfskLx4qA
I may be a proud borderline partisan Democrat but for the sake of the country follow @randyfeenstra...... He’s the dude tryna retire white nationalist Steve in a very rural and Republican part of the state
Vanity fair is just being dishonest here...... The popularity of Beto shows that ppl want another Obama https://t.co/mMuA9VWvJr
It may be written by Hugh Hewitt, but it does have an important point. We can’t and shouldn’t capitulate to the isolationist and dictator blowing far left no matter what. We shouldn’t be afraid to say that striking ISIS =/= the next Iraq https://t.co/5s49HBECAw
The one to watch in 2020, especially in the Midwest https://t.co/AXZNzen6tO
AOC was a plant by angry bernouts in Williamsburg period...... I said this when she became a star. Sadly I fear like they did during the Obama years that the media is failing to do its job this time round. The just us dems are cheaters, liars and grifters no matter what ppl say https://t.co/49tppCoTdd
The truth is that these just us dems plus sham pollster Sean Mcelwee would love a permanent dem minority which makes them feel good instead of being workhorses. There are a myriad of failures by them including being in Delaware when an upset was brewing up 95 in Boston last Sept
The truth also is that the majority of reps no matter what ideology are in touch with their district and being out of touch wasn't what killed Mike Capuano in #ma7, what did him in was that both were well liked and well known yet one was more dynamic than the other and won.......
IDK WTF CNN bothered to publish this full of lies and ignorant POS article that isn't true whatsoever and can easily be debunked. The majority of the American people don't care if the partys bigwigs are wealthy and moderate at all. You fail to mention your myriad of failures btw https://t.co/ODFilwcqrQ
Congratulations, we've kinda missed you @clairemc https://t.co/B37wOZaplK
@Chrisnotmypotus True, there are so many excellent new reps I don't know where to begin
@docdebags @reesetheone1 @Dev0ra theres a reason its called the horseshoe
The best coast for a reason https://t.co/k8iEzCI3c1
Dems want border security period. I think someone other than AOC like Cheri, Hakeem or Davids needs to get on TV to point this out....... We just don’t want an unneeded and expensive wall that isn’t gonna do shit https://t.co/tAgQfn4TOS
@Chrisnotmypotus I have Sharice there because she defeated a Republican and that is kinda my litmus test here

There is far more evidence of Tulsi defending Assad than there was of WMDs in Iraq even before the fact or there was of Ghaddafi massacring his own people https://t.co/rTO42VjFIV
@pommylee It’s more likely she’s the second seat they eliminate in redistricing in 2022 as NY is slated to lose 2 seats. If she runs for statewide in NY she will lose which I think is more likely no matter how the redistricting process plays out
This changes everything in NY....... The era of the low turnout NY that produced AOC is coming to an end https://t.co/xtxJLZMV3c

Not voting for someone whos a flip flopper and knifes colleagues and mentors........ https://t.co/3XXEYfxkMH
Ridiculous claims that dems are moving away from Clinton in "one progressive direction" and that "Heastie and Stewart-Cousins need to redress Cuomo". The dem freshman class here is diverse from the far left (Salazar) to relative moderates who flipped seats in the Hudson Valley/LI
This defense of NYs unique (in the wrong way) and ridiculous "fusion voting" system proves what I said earlier that progressives are not real dems. Real dems got rid of the IDC and defeated GOP incumbents, not the WFP or DSA. I will also add that making..		https://t.co/ZPGzT1SHv1
@tomwatson This whole article was full of shit period. Even claiming that DSA helped defeat the IDC when they promoted a liar against someone who wasn't even close to the IDC. Tho then again the author is someone whos repeatedly apologized for ppl like Vladimir Putin multiple times
Most senator approval polls are only done in that senators home state and last I checked VT was quite blue and had 3 EC votes...... https://t.co/N20IC1OcSt
His cult knows no end of the bottomless pit to hell https://t.co/PxrJWfpStK
The reason why “progressives” won’t ever become like the tea party. The tea party was both ideologically extreme and partisan at the same time. Most progressives are very ideologically extreme yet not that partisan whereas partisan dems don’t tend to be ideologically rigid https://t.co/L8WqPBgK56

Hes hiring a bunch of losers is all I can say. FYI the guys who produced AOCs ad dumped vids on at least 5 other failed candidates in less blue, less liberal regions of the country https://t.co/OKZSNbKSQP

@LikeIGive_Adam IIRC someone leaked that to the post in December of 14 tho idk the link exactly. Tho you aren’t surprised bout that one?
@LikeIGive_Adam The media seems to have learned their lesson from 2016....... Looking back it felt like they never deviated from their late 14 plant after Trump got nominated which was to attack Bush and Clinton the hardest
Millions of Americans care and are appalled https://t.co/4F625vOhZ5
The Bernie crowd don't even know who they've fucked with here.......... Obamaworld aint gonna take it https://t.co/rXXoUq7Tuk
Again this article proves why the media hasn't learned jack shit since 2016. I don't trust em at all yet I never thought id seen an article so full of bernout shit as this one. Nobody interviewed from the parts of the country where elections are won and lost. https://t.co/Cy2MBLkrc2
Everyone including the media and many dems who are cheering on the far left like AOC are gonna be in for a rude awakening in 2020 if they don’t look at what happened these past midterms
There’s no way they’re gonna run and hide from this stuff much longer..... It won’t be long until smth else gets found https://t.co/wAaJPXAPbH
@M4X7MU5 They’re becoming increasingly irrelevant among dems for that very reason and no matter what ppl think of AOC, she alone can’t reverse the trends of the last 2 years. “Moving the Overton window” won’t get anything done whatsoever.
I don't think average joes and janes give a damn about corporate contributions nor know what third way is........... Tho none of this is surprising from the GOPs biggest useful idiot https://t.co/j41lKD1qXG
@Patrickesque Every economist with half a brain agrees that voodoo economics don't work int the 21st century. Theres a reason CA and MN are doing better than KS/WI
@SallyAlbright Also as a veteran of many campaigns I will say that Bernie had a unique problem he still refuses to deal with. AFAIK nobody on the multiple teams I’ve worked on besides Kihuen (tho that was a sweep into NV in late 16 w/Hillz, CCM and Rosen as well) has anything remotely close
@SallyAlbright I was never naive to believe that they wouldn't back him 150%. They called the Ellison allegations a "failed smear campaign" that almost handed the #mnag office to an RWNJ and rt sexual harasser Chariton all the time and are hypersensitive to any criticism no matter how legit
This is why we’ve got to confront Trump with a plan on crime, opioids and immigration https://t.co/B2APHh0HVp

@AOC The truth is a lot of reps are in far more vulnerable seats than you and can both be in their office and fundraising ppl can walk and chew gum at the same time........ I know this from having worked for multiple reps who flipped seats from red to blue in CA and NV
There are many members in marginal seats who need the money to win those marginal seats. Yet again AOC proves how stupid she is by not realizing members can walk and chew gum at the same time ffs. Winning vulnerable seats requires both fundraising and a presence in the district https://t.co/XrDAYEOoRI
@joncprevo She’s a drama queen with sex appeal so that’s why ppl give a damn........ Tho completely preach abt this, there is so much more that’s “valuable” in the news atm like the shutdown

@JAllen_BR And sadly many brits bought the “Dave’s saved the economy” lie...... Labour chose the wrong leader back in 2010 and is paying the price today, Dave Miliband actually had ideas to update the center-left into the 21st century back then.
@therealphilryan *still a lot
@therealphilryan And also I could be wrong but there’s a lot of anti-Tory hatred in the north for historical reasons
@JAllen_BR Completely agree...... Tho sadly a huge talent pool was wiped out in 15. Jo Swinsons the only ideal leader among them as she’s the only MP who’s relatively young and relatively experienced

@SallyAlbright This is wrong and no doubt could get leaked to the press one day. My take is the majority of people know the difference between casual flirting and sexual harassment. This strikes me as fear by someone who's afraid of her own shadow who doesn't get it

Sadly the AOC nontroversy proves we haven't learned jack shit abt confronting RW media since 09 https://t.co/XTMck2Clzs
@tomwatson @NydiaVelazquez Tho her gift of being placed on the financial services committee by the NY delegation is a test whether these "brogressives" are for real on containing Wall Street or just using it to spite liberals
@tomwatson @NydiaVelazquez She's praised both Maloney/Velazquez in the past as they were kinda her in the early 90s (Maloney upset the last silk stocking GOP in congress/Velazquez upset Steve Solarz in 92). Waleed tho has been unproductive and even misrepresented her statements (abt Pelosi among others)
#mutehannity https://t.co/ZCq2FJQUbo
Tho her being nominated to the financial services chairmanship as a gift from the NY delegation is a litmus test in terms of how real brogressives are on Wall Street or if its just another excuse for their temper tantrums
Wonder why they're not as much after Khanna who btw is just as much of a troll and got rewarded chairmanship of the CPC in his sophomore term? Tho as someone whos a proud Clinton/Obama/Pelosi/Reid dem I understand the frustration against her well due to her past behavior https://t.co/LGIIjs45f6

Again lots of shock but no surprises to any campaign veteran. Let me ask you this why aren’t we hearing stories abt potential Castro/Harris/Warren/Klobuchar/Biden or ex-Hillz/Obama hires?

@agraybee @BarackDaVote BTW I’ve been on many campaign up and down the ballot for a decade since Obama 08, so I know what I’m talking about and recent alum from Citrus Heights to Coronado to Cupertino to Henderson have said the same thing and some of even worked for Bernie at the same time
@agraybee @BarackDaVote I’ve tried to get it in their head that smth was unique abt the Bernie campaign and I canvassed for Kihuen (one weekend in late 16 tho along with Hillz, CCM and Rosen) and they’re “oh every campaign has a sexual harassment problem” which I’ve not found to be true at all.
@AdyBarkan @AOC @danielmarans You don’t see a single freshman on the list, do you Ady? Admire your work (especially on doing everything to save the ACA) but giving you a heads up that it’s not traditional for freshmen to get such high profile committees, progressives should’ve shot for Khanna/Jayapal instead

@Kelly__Decker I understand your point and completely agree 150% however Waleed is an anti-dem operative who looks up to the tea party ffs. I believe he’s out of touch with most young ppl 95% of whom don’t live in gentrified urban areas
@Kelly__Decker Read the whole thread, he’s misrepresenting what the young ppl want. He’s claiming ppl like AOC are “saving” the dem leadership (another lie). He still thinks abolish ICE is popular (it isn’t). He somehow thinks white progs and POC can be conflated and that occupy is relevant
Don’t just assume crap like this bro, assuming crap like this (progress is inevitable, emerging dem majority, we can ditch the blue dogs) cost us 2014 and 16 quite badly. Btw dem leadership did everything to advance POC and turn them out this year unlike you guys who ignored em https://t.co/ukLaNZfVjF

@tomwatson He just lost what little Latino vote he had here in the Bay Area as everyone in that community knows someone who’s undocumented. Doubt I’ll see a Bernie sign in working class suburbs of SF like Hayward or Redwood City or in the fields of the Central Valley in a year or so.
Pelosi and even AOC were direct responses to what Trump is doing, he won’t get a single vote in Redwood City, San Mateo, Hayward, EPA, Oakland, Richmond, San Pablo, South San Jose, Gilroy and Salinas come March of 2020 because of this. Many latinos are offended by shit like this https://t.co/kuqxrhzus8
@bluebirdofunhap @maddow Tho he’s made an almost Dick Morris like string of dumb predictions
@bluebirdofunhap @maddow Especially Shahid, he’s delusional.....
@bluebirdofunhap @maddow The AOC publicity stunt is being used against Pelosi among the rosebuds.....
Wonder why both Bernie and sadly @maddow undermined #madamespeakers excellent nailing of the president???

@Vruno @reesetheone1 Mainly Whitmer, Lujan Grisham, Mills, Kelly, Sinema and Rosen. Along with ideologically similar to Walz.
@Vruno @reesetheone1 My definition is mainly minorities along with progressives (tho im under no illusion shell get them) Im probably a bit careful with certain things after 16  tbh with ya...but I think Klobuchar fits many of the 18 nominees that were successful statewide last cycle....
Proof why AOC isnt moving any Overton windows...... Dems have supported tax hikes on the rich while relieving working families for as long as I can remember. Again her support from Nobel prize winning economists proves that she's a hotter sexier lefties version of a democrat https://t.co/dcolpL9UH8

Most of my generation are politically disaffiliated but not willing to go batshit left. Ive said the reason Biden is doing well among young ppl is that being Obamas veep carries huge significance among young dems/dem leaning Indies. I hope progressives get a rude awakening

So I haven't exactly done nothing tbh with ya
@RyanLankford Preach bro
@aimeemb24 @mcbyrne @NateSilver538 Agreed, but its people like Halper and Byrne that are the worst high profile trolls. Wonder why they're all women when his base looked more like Trump than a dem
@nathansnewman @mcbyrne @NateSilver538 Somehow it never got into Byrnes head that priority no. 1 was for some and should've been for many others to save America from fascism smth that has to be lauded for effort. Kos understood what was at stake in 2016 and this was the best shot for a liberal court in a generation
Center-right in bernout language means any dem who didnt join the cult		As for DK, plenty of bernout bloggers and leftists still there but the truth is many DKers had enough reality in their blood in 10, 14 and 16 to see the truth. DK was tryna save America from fascism in 16. https://t.co/prlWTAHHHm

@Patrickesque AOC is more Palin than Bachmann
Dichotomy that the media and the bernouts are still stuck in...... Contrary to the Just us dems I don’t find as many ppl care abt stuff like foreign policy as they did in the early 00s. And also few ppl cared abt the TPP in 2015-16 but are anti-isolationist and pro-trade today
In the 00s. Most people who cut their teeth in the 2010s usually are Obama fans and hate Donald Trump and will do anything to get him out of office and transform the country to a better union, tho they do support Pelosi and are indifferent to the false establishment v progressive
Line. However I think a more transformative and shocking moment was the election of Donald Trump along with the recession causing a lot of cynicism and anger about politics that has woken us up since 2016. Also Katrina is a distant memory proving why many progressives are stuck..
And btw Waleeds completely wrong abt what we millennials have experienced. The Iraq war is a distant memory at this point and irrelevant for 2020, I also think many leftists have overrated Occupys effect tho many occupiers became bernouts but it won’t influence policy down the...
I’m not surprised that Bernie Bro Chris Hayes would anti-dem operative Shahid on. He’s lying here, the leadership may be older but it’s last i checked almost all women and POC. Many non-JDs refused to take PAC money. Also you’re ignoring quite a few other freshman young dems https://t.co/UgbDz7uMYj

@TargetedInfo The activity of ppl like Waleed is worrying to me tho he kept predicting (almost Dick Morris like) that abolish ICE would succeed and that the DCCC would lose and that his candidates would win. Another mistake they make is conflating Pelosi with the old boys club

@OfficialClayyy Yeah
@OfficialClayyy In terms of resignations it wouldn't surprise me if Walter Jones health has him contemplating with some of the scandal plagued GOP under pressure as well. I definitely see Hagedorn, possibly Cunningham and Roy and  as one termers tho.

Iraq is irrelevant no matter how many times you, bernouts and the pod bros bring it up. Most dems who are considering running weren't in congress at the time of the Iraq War, no incumbent lost a primary over this plus AOC didnt bring it up AFAIK and Case was allowed back in #hi01 https://t.co/B34C26ah6G
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam @BenScionti @jackcurran49 Btw Hamtramcks in her district so that is even more important
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam @BenScionti @jackcurran49 She's a longtime ally of the Dingells so hard to know, openly bragging about working with the king himself in her battle against billionaire Matty Moroun (who I agree is a dick, forcing people to drive on his crumbling bridge to get to Windsor instead of funding a new one)
Apologizing for dictators and shitting on America is what dictators do best. Flint btw is a symbol of what happens when the GOP is allowed to be given the reigns to do whatever the fuck they want https://t.co/LF0bihUgKm
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam @BenScionti @jackcurran49 Which is why a major test if Tlaib can survive is the upcoming battle over GMs Hamtramck plant that is slated to close. She's attacked GM with the Detroit DSA which isnt a good look to the embattled GM workers. A UAW affiliate could definitely use that against her or smth

@cenkuygur @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You don't live in reality at all Cenk...... You were complicit in multiple dem losses by telling dems to stay home in 2010 and 14 and had ppl not learned after 16 you wouldve been complicit again.
@DestroyAllGods @feefer2 @KingTreezy92 @cenkuygur @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer No dem I know of is pro-CU even back in 2010, heck Obama tried to warn America while progressives did nothing for a long time. Hillz actually got a CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT to reverse CU in her platform when she first announced her run in March 15? Not status quo eh?
@NYC5609 @KingTreezy92 @cenkuygur @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer 14 and 16 were not good dem years. How many successful gerrymandering lawsuits did it take to reverse the damage done in 2010, when Cenk openly called for ppl not to vote for vulnerable dems in tough districts that were getting heckled by teabaggers? 4
Belittling #madamespeakers accomplishments proves how out of touch Cenk is with reality. His PAC didnt win shit even underperforming in a seat dems held pre-16, Pelosi and Reid were actually quite effective if you ask me but you spent all of 09-10 dissing dems at every chance https://t.co/EpC4XUEGyz

@IAmKrishanPatel Also blue dogs were from districts that are near damned impossible for dems to win today even with fair maps
@IAmKrishanPatel A lot of it has to do with gains in safe seats against retiring new dems/unafilliated plus redistricting that allowed dem gains in a few states like CA as well..........

Proves yet again that the just us dems are in it for themselves. Lantos was a legend in Bay Area politics and was my uncles rep for many years, has both a tunnel on highway 1 and the house human rights commission named after him. She isn’t even the first refugee woman (IRL was). https://t.co/dUhr2rEAJB

Leah says here what I’ve been saying for a long time.

This again proves your irrelevance since at least the 2010 or smth..... I knocked on doors from Tracy to La Jolla to Henderson this cycle and not once did ppl say "pls don't compromise".

This my friends is America...... whod have thunk once upon a time that the ppl taking down Trump would be an Irish dude, a black woman, a black man and two men of the tribe https://t.co/7LsOkYqzKJ
@MartinFranklinB @kenner116 I haven't decided on whom im gonna vote for (I have a shortlist). But it definitely wont be Bernie, Cuomo or Bloomberg in the primaries (CA early voting means ill be among the first to vote before Iowans even caucus). I will then get on the campaign trail again to throw Trump out
@kenner116 @MartinFranklinB Abt 88 Im sadly on the #hartwouldvewon train........ Gary Hart was unique and inspiring and a good fit for the 80s and able to reach out to huge parts of America that dems had kept losing from 68 onwards. There was a reason Lee Atwater leaked his affair to the press early on
@MartinFranklinB @kenner116 Completely agree......... Who knows who can create a movement so Putins Bitch can feel the earth shaking from under his feet when 2020 comes round
@kenner116 @MartinFranklinB Having Joe as a running mate from Scranton did help. Its more than that its style. Most west coast/western dems are badass just ask Pelosi, Feinstein, Kamala, Reid, Swalwell and Schiff with the Midwest not far behind. East Coast dems? Meh, not a fan, tho as a Bay guy I’m biased

Takei has a point. Im not afraid to say Bernie is Dukakis/Mondale/Kerry. Indies in the midwest and sunbelt wont vote for a "VT liberal" just like they didn't with Kerry in 04 and Dukakis in 88 also Bernie, like Mondale is anti-trade which doesn't sit well with our farmers https://t.co/TR0jT7w7IK

@Patrickesque Anyone who volunteered in 16 isn't surprised. Campaign veteran here whos been on many campaigns since Obama 08 up and down the ballot and there was smth a lil incel abt the Bernie volunteers (used to joke they were the least hot campaign with my Hillz/Bera/CCM fellows back then)
@AlxThomp As a veteran of several campaigns, I was always struck that there was some incel attitude to the bernouts that I never saw on any other dem campaign up and down the ballot
@FamishedCreator @zatchry @AlxThomp Right, written by Maggie Haberman, she and Maureen Dowd are the definition of women who easily get wet when they hear a peep bout smearing the Clintons
@SheltieMac @reesetheone1 Im not surprised either, given that Bernie was the whitest, most male campaign (used to joke to ppl on the Hillz campaign that they were so not) Ive seen and Ive been on many campaigns (mostly CA and NV) since Obama 08 often as the youngest guy. Online trolls are different tho...
The normalization of corruption......Stuff that would be blockbuster and would send a normal POTUS favorabilities nosediving are just blips on MSM radar https://t.co/Y2WFYvADY7
Btw I will add long before Weinstein and even before Access Hollywood someone tried to warn us in a medium blog post		https://t.co/rh3eELIzbd		To end this thread this does figure why Bernoutworld was shitting their pants even harder than before (despite losses and exposes before)
motherfucking campaign have looked like America ie relatively diverse, there have been times ive been the only young dude on some campaigns if not the youngest person on campaigns. Bernies campaign was almost exclusively white, male bearded types from hipster areas......
3/ Now TBF who knows what happened with women on previous campaigns ive worked for, but what I will say openly is every dem Ive done some sort of work for from Obama to Garamendi to Swalwell to Bera to Ruiz to Hillz herself to Rouda to Hill the volunteers for every.....
2/ who didn't even look that handsome at all tho don't get me started on the few women I also met while canvassing for Hillz in late May/early June 16.... And Given the general "bro" attitude of the campaign nobody and their uncle should be surprised either.....
@reesetheone1 This is old news and we all knew it		https://t.co/rh3eELIzbd
Thread here......		1/ As a young veteran of campaigns dating back the better part of a decade (Obama 08 at age 13-14) this doesn't surprise me one fucking bit whatsoever for one reason and one reason only. Every Bernie volunteer I met with in 16 (90% of the time) was a white dude https://t.co/Gir7pOuS97
@agraybee Not surprised they're requesting with him and Weaver personally as both share the same kind of macho brawler attitude to politics......
https://t.co/LDP0gcOeJ6		The Huffpost article states clearly that Hillz at least fired ppl while Bernie turned a blind eye to these bad apples and even before Weinstein there were troubling allegations against Bernies handpicked candidate in the #ca34 special last July
Im not surprised at all. Bernie always had an audience that was more "bro" like in attitude than any other dem campaign in recent memory. I doubt ex-Obama or ex-Hillz ppl are sending similar letters to Kamala, Amy, Cory and Uncle Joe. Hillz at least fired bad apples AFAIK. https://t.co/kOh6Cv0jtv
@Rize2W Klobuchar for me first with Harris or some other minority as veep...... A lot of POC won't vote for an all white ticket. I rly think ppl are underestimating Biden especially younger ppl who remember him as Obamas veep
Quoting anti-dem actors Adam Green and Waleed Shahid while barely quoting Kessler and not even quoting Neera sounds like you know exactly what dem voters want in 2020. Btw for the last time CNN, Bernie isn’t a motherfucking dem. Dem voters want a real card carrying dem as POTUS https://t.co/NaJ0WJkndx
Even the rose brigade is admitting Bernie rips ideas from ppl like a Berned CD (pun very much intended) https://t.co/vEKiNAYERS
Bernouts will never admit this but the tot at the DNC has a lot to do with Howard Deans beef with Rahm in the 00s that Obama never wanted/bothered to fix. Hillz tried to invest last minute in downballot by campaigning w/senate candidates in OH, PA, AZ, WI, NC, IL and NH https://t.co/rAxxIOlvI4
Bernie Bro Chris Hayes was (no matter how much ppl like Moore claim otherwise) the worst during the 2016 election in terms of apologizm in the MSM. It may not be as clear to ppl cuz unlike Lauer, Halperin and Rose Hayes kept his hands to himself but sometimes #factsmatter https://t.co/J0RdmEnV7J
@letat_lechat And they inflated their ranks by recruiting 3 incumbents to join them (including 1 (Jayapal) I admire), Grijalva and Khanna are showhorses and have been for a long time (Grijalvas antics almost cost him reelection in 2010)
@letat_lechat I kept tryna tell ppl they were dangerous and the media kept promoting them....... I’d say Tlaib is the most dangerous as she’s smart enough to keep her cards to herself with Ilhan being at best iffish and Ayanna being JDINO
Thank you for pointing this out. I tried to warn ppl not to put their own egos ahead of them in multiple districts and to take the threat seriously in most cases they did, in a few safe districts they didn’t and we will live with the consequences of that now https://t.co/VvXWGZ9eS5
No trust fund dickhead, what we say when we say that Bernie is no dem is that, if you're gonna be seek the DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION you should run as a dem. Trump ran as a Republican and was a republican from the Obama years onwards (even donating to now rep Lee Zeldin in 14) https://t.co/q2NhczgFeh
If Bernie runs it will get ugly because of privileged dickheads like you who fiddled while Democracy and this Republic berned.

@nickolaslangley @dondrapershadow @Patrickesque Amendment 4 passed in FL but Gillum lost, Medicaid expansion passed in 3 states that dems usually lose, all amendments outperformed Whitmer/Stabenow in MI. Ballot measures on issues =/= progressiveness
@Patrickesque @EvanstonPrint @dondrapershadow A colleague of mine who grew up a county over from where Limbaugh’s from actually got told in 12 “you’re n****r president won”, somehow bernouts don’t acknowledge red racist America at times
Is this all an open antisemite can produce? My counter-Maté argument would be longer than 280 characters ICYMI but I’ll sum it up in		A) He’s deluded	B) He writes up propaganda and lies all the time	C) “Russiagate” is fact and the resistance keeps on winning no matter what https://t.co/MvOuNLrQgV
@dondrapershadow @Patrickesque Hard to do in Limbaugh’s home state where WWC dem areas have become solidly GOP despite voting for Obama in 08 and 12
@neeratanden Agreed, Neera, the way things should be run is the motto “may the best candidate win”
@bluebirdofunhap The GOP by abandoning good-government politics completely in the Trump era alienated a lot of suburbanites period, even where I live outside of SF had a GOP state rep until this year (quite moderate tho)
@joncprevo @IAmKrishanPatel Even where I live in a bluish district a left winger wouldn’t win without major concessions to the good government types........ Porter only won in #ca45 cuz she worked hard to neutralize herself to the more moderate good government types
I guess I’m a little more conservative than I’d like to believe but still moderate https://t.co/2Bc7ENbf3J #BornRepublican # ChartsMe
@bluebirdofunhap She ran as a moderate and her pet issue was improving the ACA mostly, and also being ex-Obama helps in Illinois AFAIK
Agreed, many bernouts never figured in their "takeover" equation that Trump would win and a lot of their practices would be under bigger scrutiny especially since a big part of their narrative was "dems lost 1000 seats under this corporate, neoliberal leadership" https://t.co/JGKVARb7qK
@sharicedavids @joncprevo I’d love to have seen the look on KKKobachs face as he signed that certificate
@bluebirdofunhap Agreed Even tho I live in a blue area in a blue state, it’s absolute fantasy to think that everywhere is like a gentrified city. Where I live, you can’t win on abolish ICE or single payer despite it being a blue seat cuz it’s a suburban good government district
@IAmKrishanPatel I understand her bitterness pretty well. Its not easy to be a dem in a deep red formerly swingy state

@Mel_Ankoly Forgot to add mostly south of STL in blue collar union areas
@Mel_Ankoly She even claims she knows how MO operates based on one trip to STL. Yes CMC did ignore black ppl in KCMO and STL but what killed her was ppl who'd previously voted dem (even some for Kander/Koster) and were loyal to Gephardt/Carnahan who voted for Hawley and Trump
@Ocasio2018 What killed Mccaskill wasn't low turnout in STL, but the fact that former Gephardt/Carnahan strongholds south of STL trended away from us...... And you aren't helping us win back areas that Obama won ffs
If it quacks like a duck it walks like a duck. AOC already spewing TYT crap abt why Mccaskill lost.

Chuck Todd, both Chrises and to an extent Maddow were all in for Bernie in 16 ICYMI. Look yourself in the mirror bruh, your attacks on other multiple dems are alienating ppl
Cenk triggered that reality doesn’t match his own lil bernout world. Kornacki is one of the best and funniest elections analysts in America. ICYMI Chuck Todd, both Chrises and to an extent Maddow were all in for Bernie in 16. And I’ll keep saying this but the status quo is Trump https://t.co/wQvPZpG67a
@DanaHoule There’s a difference between little chance based on reality at the time and not trying. Parts of the GOP have flirted with climate measures at times (Gingrich in the 00s, Curbelo/Fitzpatrick signing on carbon tax legislation) but they’ve been all talk no action
Always taking credit for stuff you don’t know anything about?		Saying there’s little chance based on the political realities of the day (large GOP majorities in house and senate in late 16) is different than not pushing for it.

As much as id like third way to have influence over the dems...... They don't, the WSJ op-ed did damage to third way and forced multiple congressmen to leave the board of Third Way.

@keithellison Eh man, as the new #mnag will you do your job instead of spreading propaganda?
Eh Keith, I got a reques, instead of spreading pro-Bernout propaganda actually do your job as Minnesota AG by protecting them from threats like the ACA repeal https://t.co/g7p1FBjCTI
I continue to believe had Dave beat Ed in 2010 Labour would’ve won the 15 election and Brexit wouldn’t have happened. Dave actually had the vision and gravitas to renew the center left earlier this decade..... https://t.co/GQT1sCfkbT

@Ramsey_663 I think most ppl have an ability to have concern for the future and I’m single af.... Waldo sounds like the stuck up loser that I know usually supported Bernie
@SusanSarandon Shove this tweet up your pussy will ya you dumb bitch. You knew full well what you were doing when told ppl that Donald Trump was better than Hillary Clinton. You have blood on your hands you low rate cunt who I hope doesn’t get another movie role again for the pain you’ve caused
@kthalps Like behaving like an insercure bitch isn’t “projecting your insecurities on other ppl”?
@reesetheone1 Next presidem should like u said immediately shove the 13 gang of 8 bill down the congress throat no matter who’s in control
Bernie sounds like an angry grandpa if u ask me........ Obama, Beto, Kamala and even uncle Joe are at least 10x more charismatic than he is https://t.co/WtqhYGAIaE
Sirota has (like you) a record of anti-dem smears going back years into the 2000s (both of you have propagated the “no difference between dem and GOP” lie)....... Most ppl are looking at his journalism record not “digging up lame excuses” https://t.co/CrFPQuEs7a
@tomwatson Sarandon has blood on her hands
Fuck @realDonaldTrump and all his enablers like @susansarandon for allowing the policy that killed this poor kid. Ask me what u want I answer to every Trump supporter and enabler I’ll answer a huge fuck up ur ass. We’d have passed immigration reform had we elected @HillaryClinton https://t.co/egE8ULy9du
@DanaHoule Taibbis a shill for bernouts

@Proletariat___ @i_k_k_european @IlhanMN @reesetheone1 @HillaryClinton Yep and so quick to believe that doing nothing about genocide makes you holier than thou feel good
Merry Christmas to every not named Donald Trump 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
@livingpotato @ChazNuttycombe Because some ppl don’t give a fuck about Trump and want to relitigate every battle of the past instead of looking at the present and not being alarmed
More like: Imagine waking up every morning and having no shame in having helped elect a Russian backed fascist to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue https://t.co/r2OpqS57Wa
@Proletariat___ @IlhanMN @reesetheone1 @HillaryClinton That is nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands of Kosovars who would’ve been murdered had Milosevic been allowed to get away with murder in Kosovo. Seriously you guys only care abt ppls lives if it’s the west and their allies and not anti-western dictators
@AJD716 @JMilesColeman Yeah, had Joe stuck to his Hoosier values RV driving guy from the early ads he would’ve probably done a little better
ICYMI running as dems in states Donald Trump won by around 20 points or more isn’t easy at all....... Heitkamp became a class act in loss by doing the right thing even if it wasn’t convenient for her https://t.co/NmfVXdHHEd
@IlhanMN @reesetheone1 @HillaryClinton It’s precisely what Madeleine Albright said, there is a place in hell for women that don’t help other women and Hillz gets it. Good luck soon to be Congresswoman and show the ppl of #mn05 what u can do by working hard for them
Anyone who denies that this #bluewomanwave was paved by Hillary Motherfucking Rodham Clinton is being delusional https://t.co/NhTr1aXowA
The bernouts (this dude used to write for the Putincept) don’t know that the “Wall Street shill” attack line wont work in west Nassau where quite a few ppl actually work there and even those that don’t are fiscal conservatives that probably don’t mind his pro-business votes tbf https://t.co/ZtEBQPfyiB
@BenScionti Israel would’ve taken his spot had Crowley and not him retired in 16

This is what third way new labour achieved on the other side of the pond peeps. The far left hates us cuz they ain’t us https://t.co/uljkKDYE64
@reesetheone1 We all know what happened after that
@reesetheone1 There’s a clip out there of her former boss saying not to vote for vulnerable dems MS fucking NBC in back in 2010
@shaunking Thanks Shaun, the ppl want this upcoming primary campaign to be on “how can I best take on Donald Trump” and nothing else. The voters will reward them based on merit
@illyrianfields @socks_mcsandals @NoFortunate @NateSilver538 A horseshoe as I like to say
Never thought I’d say this but thank you Shaun King...... The way primary campaigns should be run is you run on your merits as to why you’re the best dem to take on Donald Trump https://t.co/1DBZnJlInP
@reesetheone1 I kept saying 4/6 senate flips would’ve happened in 12 if not for bad candidates Akin, Mourdock, Berg and Berkley were both bad and damaged at the same time
@neeratanden blocked you because none of us real dems are letting you get away with supporting fascism https://t.co/CYaziD5pih
Abt that out of touch, Sirota publishes his diatribe in a left leaning British newspaper that 99% of Americans have never heard of. This is the reason bernouts keep losing cuz unlike real dems they’ve never looked outside of they bubble at all and think the world = Williamsburg https://t.co/3BljInOJA3
@socks_mcsandals @NoFortunate @NateSilver538 ACA is still here, Cap and Trade was never repealed AFAIK and Dodd Frank is modified but not repealed.		Obama would’ve got far more done if you guys hadn’t spent a decade whining and demotivating the base in both 10 and 14, you would’ve had at least 10 more stimuli if you hadn’t
@neeratanden Remember the ppl doing this don’t have much to lose under 4 more years of Trump and will be screaming Bernie would’ve won when (this scares me) the notorious RBG is replaced with a RW hack 🤢🤢🤢
Pretty good read and true....... the truth is all Hillary supporters and soft Bernie supporters have moved on would love to work their fucking ass off to get rid of Donald Trump. Instead we have DSA dudebros who think relitigating 2016 is the shit and bullying other dems is cool https://t.co/Bate4ibRhm

A result I’d expect from a cult like North Korea not a real democracy https://t.co/EQg77OJf7o

@QueenMab87 I knew everyone who supported him was either a loser or a spoiled brat.......
@DylanDevenyi Save for Bernie that’s 150% true
@LeslieEscoto2 True, true...... even worse for me I’ve been accused of being a fake millennial and I was volunteering for campaigns in HS while they were just sitting in their basement playing video games
Again it’s one of those moments where I feel vindicated and right with a sick feeling to my stomach. I tried to warn about her and it didn’t get to nobody’s head not even Crowley sadly and he was no.4 in the house. Sadly most dems at the top are naive and stupid abt the bernouts https://t.co/WHm5HiC8AT
@_WeStandUnited I kept trying to warn ppl well before June 26 2018 and nobody listened, heck there’s a reason 2 of the just us dems founders Saikat Chakrabarti and Corbin Trent are on her team.........
We told you they were nazis however the rose brigade and all their useful idiots didn’t listen when everyone and their uncle screamed “this isn’t about Macrons alleged neoliberalism, this is fascism with a good dose of Putin and leftist apoligism”........ https://t.co/rF8AlCIVYW

@jackjonesbabe Done
@FEFelson @jonfavs Voters elected the real democrat in the primary process in 16 and elected Obama in 08..........
@KJ_Jeller @ianjay_ @FEFelson @jonfavs The majority of voters like ppl for different reasons, it’s called a democracy
@EmpathicSurgeon @Tzipshmil @jonfavs Part of Bernie’s appeal in 16 was being somebody new on the scene to average Joes and Janes........		They fear most losing my generation who already moved on in like Dec. 16. A version of UHC/ACA expansion will be passed in the next dem trifecta as health care is a winning issue
This is sickening........ As someone who’s proudly lived Bay Area values his whole life I’m shocked but not at all surprised the brogressives have spread their Jew hatred to the streets https://t.co/r1gULFYv5D

@bobcesca_go You were exactly right brother.	I even saw things like the “draft Warren” movement and the fact that so many liberals including those on the right side today refused to call out bad actors like Uygur/Schultz as well as poisoning the well by attacking moderate dems between 13-15
Bob is 150% right. The sad thing is many liberals bought the bait repeatedly between 2013 and 15 and refused to see the light until the DNC was hacked. Everyone who was watching knew that the “draft Warren” movement and the attacks on elected moderate dems was anti-Obama/Hillary https://t.co/u2h4fep87E
@joanwalsh @tomwatson @BetoORourke Bernouts are tanking among millennials outside of Williamsburg and it’s taken them 2 years to see that and when they do they blame the most popular ex-president among millennials
He’s already in deep shit with millennials and his surrogates attacking Obama isn’t helping https://t.co/giweGndI5t
A condescending trust fund boy asshole who thank god still doesn’t know anything bout the dem base and still doesn’t want to learn. Bernouts are in for a rude awakening in 2020 when Bernie places 5th in IA/NH and tanks in the south and southwest https://t.co/h3Vc5BlBrR

@Ramsey_663 @OurRevolution @SenSanders Agreed...... tho it proves they don’t have a problem with cranks, sexual harassers and dictators
They're so deluded..... Didn't even win a seat for state assembly in my backyard (Berkeley/Oakland) cuz they're so incompetent https://t.co/1uGtJfXlXv
When even the putincept has to call out DSAs Orwellian tactics...... https://t.co/m7fyYRbR2O
@BravenakBlog So many reasons out there, where do I begin?		The main reason tho is his toxic cult following that has looks more like Donald Trumps base than anything in dem politics that embraces conspiracy theories, dictator and autocrat fetishes as well as bullying and hate
@LikeIGive_Adam Im straight af but Id say between 13 and 16 tbh with ya, but was slightly older in my day and I graduated HS only 5 years ago
@magi_jay So true is all I can say....... A lot of former Bernie supporters in 16 love Obama/Biden/Beto. For example an old friend of mine from HS perked up when I mentioned Biden after saying "Bernie woulda won" and talked bout how she remembered the Obama/Biden bromance and missed it
@TomPerez @jonfavs I hope the moderators will ask Bernout some tough questions
I’m happy that Thom Hartmann is one of the few leftists who saw the light and decided to go sane https://t.co/ndp1kxYFb0

@politicsluo Rosenstein
@urbanmeemaw @eclecticbrotha You mean the putincept
@urbanmeemaw @eclecticbrotha Completely agree....... And hes an idiot as well given that he literally praised Hugo Chavez right as the disastrous effects of his regime were coming to light
@neeratanden These bernout trust fund babies don't even care about the poor and the disadvantaged at all......
Everyone knows these ppl share Trumps weird dictator fetish and aren't willing to admit that humanitarian intervention works and is a new Iraq https://t.co/yMXHQ1yAHW
@drj21h @neeratanden @cbeilinson There wont be a freedumb caucus on the left, cuz all dems understand that you need a good government while the bernouts and the GOP want to burn the government down
This makes me very sick tbh with ya.......... Spiting the millions of ppl whose lives were saved by the ACA is just wrong. Tho then again this is coming from a bernout who went on a long rant abt how dems weren't populist enough when America itself was on the line https://t.co/8Q1yFctGV8
To all those who said Hillz (thru blaming it on Bill) was responsible for the crash and said Trump was better for the economy can STFU cuz they don’t got anything to say https://t.co/i2ukvsuSh1
@reesetheone1 Tho my point stands that if Bernie continues his 44 bashing he’ll lose millennials of every demographic
@reesetheone1 I don’t support Biden myself yet most millennials know him as Obama’s veep not the person who botched the Anita Hill hearings
Read this list from my main man @Alex__Katz....... I nearly puked when I saw it but I’m not surprise, I hope but I’m not holding my breath for the media to actually investigate this and call him out on it https://t.co/IrakJ9IalB
Despite the repeated "GTFO" from the bernouts it looks like she indeed has a heart in the game now and the queen has indeed not been overthrown from her party https://t.co/SeqKspoy8t
@Alex__Katz Given that the guardian is doing exactly what they did before 2016 by publishing ppl they know they shouldn't publish it does almost feel that nothings changed at all
@tomwatson All I know is if Bernie retains the same anti-Obama ppl round him he's lost millennials. They call Beto a new Obama cuz they don't know my generation except for the trust fund babies in gentrified neighborhoods. My generation wants Obama back no matter what the cost, even Biden
@eclecticbrotha Sirota doesn't realize he won't win a single millennial vote by bashing Obama
There were many others who knew exactly what they were doing and don't want to own their mistakes like men. Cenk invited Stein on TYT when he knew damn well that Putin was paying her off like a stripper https://t.co/5f9bxWOHhX
@RoseAnnDeMoro STFU....... You supported Trump cuz your main man (whos not even a dem) didn't get the nomination and deludedly believed he would support M4A
Bernout who prefers working with Trump can shut her fucking mouth about other dems..... Shoving Bernie down the throat of the ppl https://t.co/JO1hWhDood
My rep tells it like is........ the sad truth is that Putin and Erdogan bribed Trump https://t.co/ocFmrJtwsl
Putin controls Trump period https://t.co/ZMRFVtJoJQ
@Michael2014abc Somehow not getting that this is leaving the beleaguered Kurds to the wolves of Putin, Assad and Erdogan when they need us the most........ Peace should be the solution but completely ignoring reality on the ground isn’t
@neeratanden The question is why the GOP never got round to aiding Trump with his wall?
Before anyone attacks us dems for not abandoning our principles, let me ask the rhetorical question, the GOP had a trifecta for 2 fucking years, why did they never get round to building the wall? https://t.co/euoJnlhHHx
Send this to every “centrists appeal to boomers only” idiot https://t.co/dCwuhhlmWj
@pizzmoe @WeAretheMedia2 @admiralmpj Same here but not surprised, Iraq I think blinded many progressives to certain elements of the anti war movement
@WeAretheMedia2 @admiralmpj Nichols is OK as well, tho i didnt know boehlert wrote for them
@Browtweaten @magsview77 @admiralmpj And btw we were never gonna anoint him. You haven't pushed back, youve made him more acceptable among high info voters who tend to caucus more and vote in more primaries
@Browtweaten @magsview77 @admiralmpj The somehow coordinated disinformation campaign and online abuse directed towards anyone who speaks up for a non-Bernie candidate is acceptable? More leftists elected than ever before, rly. Beto decides when he will run and the choice is up to the primary voters
@LucyWestmorela3 @femocratsrisin1 @pplswar Agreed
@magsview77 @admiralmpj You’ve been allowed to pummel and undermine us w/o so much as a peep from the MSM or DNC...... That time is over time to lose once more turn it up as we blow ya up.....  We aren’t going to allow what happened in 2016 and it’s time you felt a little pushback

@HillaryClinton Sickened to read what you all tried to tell us back in 16.... The ppl didn't know you were right all along #hillarywarnedus, anyways this makes me wish you were in the White House atm as Madame President. America and the world which looks to it are a poorer place without you
Hillz yet again warned us yet the bernouts and MAGAs made fun of her while the MSM stood idly by........ Again it makes me sick typing this but this is why I thought Hillz would've been an excellent president because she is the only woman that Putin and other dictators fear https://t.co/OJBFgvSboX

@LikeIGive_Adam @jacobfhsmith Tho recruiting a Sherill/Luria style vet given that its an Air Force district is a good idea here
@LikeIGive_Adam @jacobfhsmith She actually underperformed, the fundamentals for a split district that Bacon barely won in 16 and that both in 08, 10 weirdly and 12 we lost with similar margins that Eastman lost by and actually won this in 14 should’ve flipped this cycle with a 1 term rep......
@KamalaFanAcct @KaylaraOwl Sounds better.......
@pommylee Same here, always had a soft spot for Blair and Clinton years before I met my new “in laws”...... Btw I do hope next spring that Shorten and Labor down under do show a path out for us on the center left

@pommylee They also warned me about Putin years ago.......
@pommylee I’m well aware of the Albanian view of the west’s 99 liberation as one of my cousins married a 2nd gen Kosovar and he supported Hillary from day one and the whole family loves the Clintons, Biden, Dole, McCain and many other senators. There’s a Clinton Boulevard in Prishtina also
@KaylaraOwl It’s the horseshoe theory in practice
@pommylee They’ll never learn and just use every fucking excuse in the book.		They won’t care when I tell them that LBJ had to go incremental to implement Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.		They’ll call me a Warhawk when I mention that Trumps Syria pullout has Putin/Erdogan ties
Trump, the GOP and sections of the left are at least useful idiots or bought and paid for by Vladimir Putin https://t.co/6PYBn5Tpr0
@pommylee https://t.co/KxaEucCfk6
@pommylee I’ll get round to asking him but in the meantime I’ll post a screenshot down below

@jacobfhsmith I hope neither Eastman or Ironstache ever runs again..... Tho we’re not winning #wi01 until we remove Wauke$ha from it
@commondefense Do you guys even give a fuck that he resigned on behalf of this country? Anyone who doesn’t have blinders over their eyes knows that the Syria pullout had everything to do with Putin or Erdogan blackmailing him, Mattis did a lot more for the republic than ppl give him credit for
More like serious question is there anyone on the left who understands the consequences of the withdrawal and who might have asked Donald for a favor on that regard? https://t.co/a92my65f1u
Agreed..... anyone who didnt see that the republic itself was at stake shouldn’t have anything to say https://t.co/s3ApjyXUgE
@IlhanMN You don’t see this as a capitulation to Putin and Erdogan do ya?
@femocratsrisin1 @pplswar +1 he seems to be the only one besides me who was aware of the regressive parts of the left before 2016..........		He may be pro-Bernie and I don’t always agree with him yet he absolutely nails the bad actors hard
@RepBarbaraLee As a proud East Bay resident I’m more than proud that a statement like this telling the truth bout the Middle East would come from one of my own, stay classy Barb

@Ramsey_663 It’s like so many of em have contempt for the ppl they claim to represent, POC, the poor and working class, the disabled. Waleed reminds of all those Asian trust fund babies who basically not only have a trust fund but are in an elite school and drive a Benz from my hometown
@1sambase @cenkuygur @justicedems The status quo is Donald Trump in power period
@cenkuygur @justicedems A justice Dem winning in a state Donald Trump won by 20 points is pure delusion....... The ppl of MO want the status quo and that is Donald Trump in power unchecking, when will you idiots ever get real?
@jacobfhsmith He never has and it’s gone back nearly a decade. Thinking Alan Grayson could win after his infamous Taliban Dan ad back in 2010 when he was one of the worst defeats during the shellacking, saying Conor Lamb would lose this sprin, almost Dick Morris like in his takes but left wing
And KCMO as well as her copy/pasting GOP talking points on immigration but the sad truth is you just us dems are so fucking clueless on the issue of immigration, thinking Faux News/Sinclair won’t give a fuck bout Abolishing ICE once they have M4A is not only stupid but delusional
I’m so fucking sick and tired of debunking this charlatan but Mccaskill rightfully said emulate those who defeated the GOP.		On immigration I may add u thought abolish ICE was popular but it damaged Mccaskill dearly		I’m not a fan of her unwillingness to turn oh blacks in STL.... https://t.co/BP5Ron0Rxy
@davidagordon9 @politico_chris @JMilesColeman I admire several of em myself but agree with your sentiments, tho Cenk is the definition of an insufferable asshole
Again proves why you lot suck. You think a just us dem would’ve won statewide in MO? A state that Donald Trump won by 20 points. Sadly her constituents wanted the status quo of Trump and the GOP. Also Elizabeth Warren bragged about that same hearing aid bill recently. https://t.co/6EtDfEzyKZ
@BenScionti We call em the just us dems for a reason....
Thanks General Mattis for actually giving a fuck about this country and its foundations. Resigning while Trump listens to Putin and Erdogan is not only the right thing to do but it is heroic and future generations will look to ppl like you who has a spine when it was needed badly https://t.co/OypYAe5PJB
@queerBengali I literally want to throw up every time I read crap like “Obama was the rdporter in chief”. Or “Hillary would’ve done the same”
Proves yet again that Bernouts were more about a cult than about ideology https://t.co/7ZH8BwcCKC
@RepJeffries Well done king....... The bernouts hate you cuz ur effective in a real BK style
When will the beltway realize how dumb she actually is https://t.co/feTQ3oswUL
New dems be like: “all we do is win win win no matter whut” rub it in to all the bernouts will ya https://t.co/LikxVzxdVz
@jackcurran49 Williamson county is teabag central.......
@neogaia @pplswar I know Waleed is a lying POS, he’s like all the Asian kids I grew up with in the Bay, ppl who think they’re wack cuz they aren’t white but in reality everyone knows they’re rich phonys cuz they’re driving a new Benz, a place at Harvard and a trust fund
@DianeRavitch Stop spreading Russian propaganda ffs
@Ramsey_663 I’m well aware of that...... Like with Hillz, I will never forgive Crowley for not calling them out for what they are.
@JAllen_BR I’m well aware of my talents.....
@Ocasio2018 Retweeting pro-fascist propaganda...... Rly how dumb are ya? Don’t join the pro-Putin red brown alliance
Dumb drama queen deepthroats Russian propaganda I guess....... https://t.co/Tz2Bp8JIfP
@reesetheone1 As a Californian it wouldn’t surprise me if she and Castro were the top 2 vote getters
Madame speaker don’t hold no candle to fake empty suit https://t.co/hg8FNGY9qr
@IAmKrishanPatel @SeanMcElwee @PeteHarrisonNYC @JumaaneWilliams Yeah agreed and I will add I like a deep, qualified and high profile resume
@IAmKrishanPatel @SeanMcElwee @PeteHarrisonNYC @JumaaneWilliams Nah she’s the most qualified of the bunch having been city Council speaker for 3 years as well
@IAmKrishanPatel @BenRocheteau Everyone knows Vladimir Putin is at least egging them on
@IAmKrishanPatel @SeanMcElwee @PeteHarrisonNYC @JumaaneWilliams I’m pulling for MMV, James should be replaced by a progressive WOC and she qualifies
@oldladydem Even Sean Mcelwee cares about some of the new reps not named AOC or Tlaib (Neguse, Haaland, Hayes, Finkenauer)
@oldladydem They’re not gonna get AOC nor anyone else on ways and means.... Richie Neal knows she’s a grifter and will easily hand it to suozzi
Working class my ass, everyone and their auntie knows ur a conman bruh...... screwing over a longtime rep who’s dad was a cop and mom was an immigrant in #ny14 and turning him into some kind of big bad  corrupt millionaire, we cant trust you trust fund babies at all https://t.co/OH2S7Ycb65
I keep telling you this bernout propaganda machine exists and WTAF are ppl not learning their lesson????? The Beto oppo research seems coordinated as well as Kamala/Bookers low standing in the polls and the repeated attacks on Hakeem and Pelosi https://t.co/jSiX5sPWO7
@ThirdWayMattB Also Katie Porter in the OC did everything she could to desensitize herself to moderate leaning dems and indys, Eastman did no such thing......
@clairecmc Thanks Senator, the ppl of MO and America dont know what they will be missing with you and Heitkamp gone.....
As someone who’s never lived in MO I will forever appreciate the breed of badass woman red/purple state senator and sadly with Mccaskill and Heitkamp gone there will be 2 fewer of them. The country and their states don’t know what they lost. Thank you for your service Claire https://t.co/8rpTj2OPlB

@bernie20204eva @eclecticbrotha All the young freshmen will endorse different candidates period. I don't see some of the just us dems being on the Bernie train either, especially ppl like Grijalva, Presley or Omara
WTAF Sirota. theres a reason many liberals on both sides of the pond don't trust the Guardian. I will add for those who don't want to read that its regurgitated crap we hear form every bernout and its full of shit literally. Attacking other dems won't help them this time tho https://t.co/h0zOkKaIKZ
@BurgSkeletal @CMcGTweets @Patrickesque @Ohio06Memes @HangryKissinger @adamcbest A lot of mistrust between Dean operatives and dem insiders because of his beef with Rahm is a huge reason why the DNC fucked up as well as confronting a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis
@BurgSkeletal @CMcGTweets @Patrickesque @Ohio06Memes @HangryKissinger @adamcbest Mcauliffe tried his best to fix the DNCs problems but sadly thanks to 9/11, the GOP was inflated for basically 4 yrs or so
@BurgSkeletal @CMcGTweets @Patrickesque @Ohio06Memes @HangryKissinger @adamcbest But can't you see that its a bit tone deaf given that he's in a black city on MLKs 50th deathday anniversary..... It was a bit poorly worded tho the DNC could've been fixed if not for 9/11 cuz T Mac basically laid the ground for Dean to take over in 05.
@eclecticbrotha WTAF did he do now?
@BurgSkeletal @CMcGTweets @Patrickesque @Ohio06Memes @HangryKissinger @adamcbest It was tone deaf at best...... A lot of black ppl reacted quite negatively to it. He basically said "the business model of the dems has been a failure save for a charismatic guy named Barack Obama"
@AFreshPrincess @jackjonesbabe Supporting AOC over Suozzi on Ways and Means when freshmen usually aren't allowed on ways and means......
Im paging the new majority to investigate ICE atm....... I think the border should be enforced but Trump is scaring every minority group in America https://t.co/73qUksyaZQ
@lynnv378 His failed movie also seems like an attempt to distract from his irrelevance and his lies, like his work with the disgraced Harvey Weinstein as well as his ties to the Just us dems
@lynnv378 I will scream about Devines work with Putin ally Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia barely 6 months before Bernie hired him until someone listens
@TenXiaoLu @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump No that was Trudeaus decision after taking over from Harper in 15....... Im not blinded by nonsense but don't you see it as a little fishy that he does it the day Flynn is charged with helping Erdogan???
Not surprised that Taibbi is stanning for Bernie at all..... https://t.co/augt3rcKyA
@CMcGTweets @Patrickesque @BurgSkeletal @Ohio06Memes @HangryKissinger @adamcbest Yeah, his comments in Mississippi last spring about Obama should disqualify him. there are plenty of ppl out there who can appeal to a cross section of America w/a new vision but Bernie isn’t the one to do it this time round given that the midterm gains were driven by women/POC
@_noelove As someone who’s watched her career from just outside SF I’d say she’s pretty good tbh with ya...... Did a pretty good job as both SF DA and as AG here
I’m not gonna vote for Biden but I’m not surprised given that many young ppl associate him w/Obama that he’s more popular than Trump and what did I tell you about Gens Y and Z souring on Bernie because of 2016 https://t.co/Iqxgv6C0wZ
@subalternuplift They know and don’t give a fuck cuz they’d rather support fascism than liberalism
@aaronjmate Hope you snap out of your idiot trance sooner rather than later......... Mueller doesn’t give a fuck about Trumps policies, he gives a fuck abt this country and its integrity. Future generations will look to ppl like you as idiots and traitors
@RoKhanna @elium2 You don’t see Trumps dictator fetish regarding Syria do you? As a Bay Area resident I’m appalled you don’t call him out for taking advice from Putin and Erdogan
This tweet by the Bays liar and abomination is why I neither call myself a progressive nor support the left....... The unwillingness to see Trumps dictator fetish is not worthy of my vote period https://t.co/16167XEXMe
@jackjonesbabe Worst part is the very pro-Pelosi Daily Kos supports this crap. It won’t happen because Jayapal will stay put and there are already 3 ppl from CA on Ways and Means so Khannna won’t get it either. Hard to know about the others
They have a big ego problem period..... https://t.co/8B5kgGgqYr
@BudgetBen @ThirdWayKessler @RepJeffries @Ocasio2018 Meant unfortunately for them
@BudgetBen @ThirdWayKessler @RepJeffries @Ocasio2018 The rosebuds will never listen..... they live in their own world and won’t give a damn...... Unfortunately the trend of more ppl voting post-Trump isn’t going away and with NYs primaries being merged they won’t sneak thru another grifter like drama queen AOC
@repjoecrowley Thanks for your service Joe, a rare class act and a fighter if I’ve ever seen one. The drama queen replacing you can’t hold a candle to you. I’m telling ya right now pls come back one day in some shape or form as America needs your class at a time when it’s rare and needed
Always a class act Joe. will miss ya terribly especially with the drama queen replacing you. I believe that you will be back one day somewhere somehow given that your classiness and fighting heart inspires America and Americans. You never know what tomorrow brings man https://t.co/BNKB33m4Mn

@gingercaddy @EaleyGregory @neeratanden @staceyabrams @amprog The purity trolling from you guys got us here. 10, 14 and 16s losses could have been prevented if ppl like you didn’t have a knee jerk reaction to attack dems not part of your cult. I’m never gonna forgive Cenk at all for his coverage on MSNBC in 2010 that drove down dem turnout
@pplswar This along with Brexit will be Cameron’s legacy in Britain
This along with Brexit will be Dave Cameron’s legacy.......... Blair and Brown introduced tax credits which helped millions of poor and working class British children https://t.co/0si4hYfFqz
@gingercaddy @EaleyGregory @neeratanden @staceyabrams @amprog As for glass steagal repeal it wasn’t Clinton but 2 GOP reps and 1 GOP senator who were behind it back in 99.......
@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump No concern about Erdogan or Putin influencing this decision?
Cenk proves who he is, he’d rather attack the media than ask questions regarding Putin and Erdogan and their influence......... https://t.co/9HFrzqrLYi
@gingercaddy @EaleyGregory @neeratanden @staceyabrams @amprog Tell the lies you’re spreading about the ACA to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who gained health insurance after 2010........ As for Dodd Frank tell that to the millions of Americans who’ve recieved help from the CFPB. You’re purity trolling is screwing over Americans
Touching photo 😍😍😍😍, the Obamas are the best first family we’ve ever had and an inspiration to America https://t.co/VlSb6HANQW
@Ramsey_663 @maddow @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden @BetoORourke @SenSanders Yeah, Maddows my fave tbh with ya but I will add an advantage about Lawrence, he has insider knowledge of the hill which only Morning Joe shares with him in terms of knowing how the nitty grit of Capitol Hill works
@gingercaddy @EaleyGregory @neeratanden @staceyabrams @amprog “Actual progress” may be more incremental than you like...... Many of LBJs reforms started out much less potent than they are today (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security) so expanding and tweaking the ACA, Dodd Frank and many others is a good start
@finkelbuster @magi_jay @chrisdameanor19 @WalkerBragman I endorsed Clinton in March of 16 despite being undecided previously because I knew Trump was a threat to the republic and my dad was smart enough to tell me to actually give a fuck abt the court. Then again none of these bernouts ever cared for America at all and hate it......
@Ramsey_663 @maddow @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden @BetoORourke @SenSanders Agreed but both are the few TV anchors who are brutally honest about Donald Trump.... We need to stand with what we have, I fear that this republic can’t survive Trump getting reelected
@andyg_live @neeratanden @staceyabrams @amprog GTFO and spread your crap elsewhere
@chrisdameanor19 @finkelbuster @magi_jay @WalkerBragman And that is among many things, have long thought of writing a list of shit not to forgive them about...... Cenk and Markos bashed Obama’s court choice for example, even tho I like Markos I will not forgive him for some of the stuff he said
@finkelbuster @magi_jay @chrisdameanor19 @WalkerBragman The unwillingness to give a fuck about the court showed then and they’ll never be forgiven for that
That’s not true Trust fund boy......... Mangy called out idiots like you who not only supported Trump but egged on Putin in 16 and I ask cuz I’m not sure, do you even have a moral compass or a heart? https://t.co/IQEMYbNBUz
Not surprised that both Lawrence and Maddow are handing Tucker’s ass to him on the ratings market...... They right now are the most brutally honest programs in America https://t.co/4e5ZCmfpVU
@reesetheone1 I saw that sweep of the south and southwest on Super Tuesday and realized that Bernie was tanking among black and Latino voters. He couldn’t even win Detroit and Milwaukee ffs despite him winning those states, the politico article should’ve used exacerbated instead of exposed
@blanarph Waldo thinks he speaks for most of my generation. I’ll tell you that he does not, not even the majority of white men, many millennials have moved on and never actually gave a fuck abt if Clinton was a “status quo neolib” or not whether they voted for Bernie or not
Again Waleed is delusional, if you wanted “stronger LW institutions” actually attempt to build one ffs (Heritage was founded in 73 and laid the way for Reagan) tho Perriello and Abrams are Obama/Clinton dems. And you already have the Sanders institute which is no AEI/Heritage https://t.co/YENWnXKInF
@tomwatson You have a point but a rhetorical question what were Gores no.s in 02, Kerry’s in 06, McCain’s in 10 and Romney’s in 14? Ppl aren’t exactly forgiving towards presidential losers especially with the loss being relatively fresh
@CharlesPPierce @tomwatson It’s more like the “leaders on policy” are more like “leaders of a cult” anyways don’t give a closet Trump supporter a platform
@tomwatson Editor of “current affairs” I’d take it with a grain of salt, tho the guardian hasn’t learned jack shit from giving these idiots a voice pre-2016
@Ramsey_663 Kamala is in better shape then ppl realize tbh with ya..... however she never got the attention gillibrand did for some weird reason
@DanaHoule Thanks Dana for telling it like it is....
Again ppl like Dana prove the truth..... they won’t be successful in 2020 unless I’m missing a district given the fact that I don’t see a retirement in a very progressive district as of now as well as the fact that no one will be caught off guard after Crowley’s loss https://t.co/UWcYuZhU4l

@FoeToPrinces @OzKaterji This coming from someone employed by TYT is a little surprising
Anyone who hasn’t realized that the Bernie movement was one of the whitest non-GOP campaigns in 16 has their head in the sand. I take early polls with a grain of salt but don’t be surprised if Kamala cleans up CA with Castro in 2nd https://t.co/LhEnVHuDRZ
@ACampaNajjar This photo shows what America can be at its best period
@Brasilmagic She exposed herself as an empty suit and pissed off a huge portion of the dem base by dissing Bill Clinton........ She’s done nothing believing she could get away with everything including flip flopping and ourtright lying. Anyone who couldn’t see the Stone/Hannity ties was lying
My take on the Gillibrand thing is as follows, no matter what she and her defenders claim, the Franken issue as well as her subsequent anti-Bill diss exposed her as an empty suit looking to do anything to stay employed. Also how could she and so many not see the RW ties to there? https://t.co/mxndGuMVkV
@queerBengali As a white man myself all I can say is pls stay true to yourself gurl....... The world is a better place with ur honesty even when ur down/angry.......

@DanteAtkins The truth is Dante that the anti-DNC propaganda started seeping in well before the files were stolen...... Somehow Devine working for Yanukovich in Ukraine and Vucic in Serbia isn’t coincidental is it? Barely 6 months had gone between him leaving Vucic and being hired by Bernie
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 bravo to the financial times for standing up for the west’s values in a dark and dangerous time and finally doing what I’ve called on liberals to do for 3 years aka not be squeamish abt what the actual fuck they stand for https://t.co/QVH1xt7Rt1

The sad truth Aaron is the fact that half of Americans have social media as their top news source and that matters https://t.co/92cZGTwP8g
Unfortunately knowing politico and the just us dems well this is all i can say		A) AOCs a bernout drama queen who will do anything to be in the limelight		B) Politico will do anything to talk shit about dems and would probably win the Pulitzer Prize in “dems in disarray articles” https://t.co/v0Xm6SU3h0

@reesetheone1 My mom worked as a Dr. in West Oakland in the early 90s so I’ve heard the stories......Both her pastor colleague and many of her patients were relieved when the bill passed.....
@Ange_Amene Her coworker was beyond relieved when the bill passed. These bernouts dont know at all how it was like then and how I can venture into Oakland/Richmond without worrying bout coming out of there alive during the wrong hours
@Ange_Amene And I mean every night on the news there was another killing, another carjacking, moms who were afraid to send their kids to school because of the drugs and the gangs heck her colleague even worked as a pastor in EPA and had horrible stories to tell. Let me tell ya......
@Ange_Amene These ppl don’t know Jack shit.... as I wrote on my TL my mom worked in a bad hood (EPA outside of SF) as a doctor in the early 90s, it was so bad she refused to drive her Saab in there at first. She had patients whose boyfriends were killed. She heard gunfire every day at work..
@neeratanden Name and shame then Neera...... The American ppl have a right to know who gaslit the country in Putin’s behalf
The rosebuds hate Neera for a reason...... she’s not afraid to put the bernouts in their place https://t.co/lI7TPBtcau
@reesetheone1 Plenty id like remove, the black community will easily remove Cohen and Tlaib when the time comes. I’d love someone to remove Ro Khanna as well
@marcushjohnson @reesetheone1 I know her crew tried to spite my senator Dianne Feinstein and attempted to use a well liked black woman rep against Pelosi (Lee is a seat over from me)
@mikeyoranje88 @PortiaMcGonagal @eclecticbrotha He was always a class act and I don’t think we’ve seen the last of him...... I was one of the few who tried to warn ppl as far back as May that smth was up. Tho he was on borrowed time as an ethnic white machine boss in a hipster/POC district.....
@tomwatson The 2nd to bottom line 		- 3 IDC defeats came from NY-14		That’s a lie cuz Biaggi defeated Klein in the Riverdale/Westchester portion of the district and both hers and Lius are only partly in NY-14
@tomwatson Belittling the anti-IDC movement as well........ #classless
Baloney, Cenk was gonna Stan for Brent anyways and Abdul got far more attention than Whitmer even before you won. You didn’t help Tlaib at all in Detroit, Ilhan in Minneapolis and Ayanna in Boston. Public banking is DOA and abt that GND show me some legislation will ya? https://t.co/PPu9MPc2Je
@tomwatson Don’t be naive man.....
* and the 94 crime bill wouldn’t have passed w/o them. I find it sickening as someone who’s had to listen to harrowing stories from my mom and her colleagues in EPA ca. 90-95 to hear ppl who don’t know Jack shit bout whut they’re talking about talk out the side of their mouth
And had to park her Saab 900 in a different hood and carpool with her colleague. She witnessed a patient of hers have his boyfriend murdered among other things..... The truth is every black and brown person in America was begging for help and thru their persuasion got the 94.....
Communities of color all over America........ it was so bad that my parents never drove thru places like Oakland, East Palo Alto, Richmond and parts of Redwood City if they could avoid it. My mom as a physician worked with black and brown ppl in EPA in the early 90s......
There are many BLM supporters young and old who either remember or have heard of the background of the 94 crime bill. I think Hillz did the wrong thing by not defending it. But to those who don’t let me explain, in the late 80s/early 90s a crime wave hit America that decimated... https://t.co/0tumaEpy17
@mikeyoranje88 @PortiaMcGonagal @eclecticbrotha Tho Crowley was never gonna be Pelosis successor........ A white guy was never gonna succeed Pelosi period
@mikeyoranje88 @PortiaMcGonagal @eclecticbrotha Crowley should’ve hit her much harder than he did...... We can’t do a mr nice guy approach to these idiots,  tho it reeked from day 1, Looking back I think we should’ve defended Crowley........
@wastedtime01 @eclecticbrotha More like a drama queen tbh with ya, reminds of every drama queen I’ve dated
From one boricua to another, AOC should answer this or else face the wrath of the real dems who stopped most if not all just us dems in their tracks from Providence to Miami to Tucson to Vantucky https://t.co/jFiaL3h0DZ

@adum23 @eclecticbrotha True true man......
@BlackdragonSix @adum23 @eclecticbrotha I meant black voters especially black women dimwit.........
@JAllen_BR Who knows, NY politics will change forever the minute Cuomo signs the voting reforms anyways
@JAllen_BR I knew that part tho......
@JAllen_BR Wouldn’t surprise me if she retired out of fear...... especially if the primaries aren’t merged, tho I doubt it given Cuomo giving the thumbs up to a merger which makes an AOC situation less likely
@adum23 @eclecticbrotha Calling the backbone of the Democratic Party establishment? U have some nerve...... The more u bernouts piss off black voters the more irrelevance u become
@JAllen_BR She’s probably the incumbent in the NY area I want gone the most...... I’m unwilling to tolerate anti-vax views in our party at all
@eclecticbrotha I get the feelings and I agree, but politico has just about earned a Pulitzer Prize in “dems in disarray” articles
@JAllen_BR Someone like Crespo could easily mount a credible challenge....... Wonder why they’re not going after Maloney despite her support of the GND...... Proves yet again they’re a cult and don’t give a fuck bout anything else including severe personal failings and terrible views
@BenScionti Bill that made school vaccines mandatory in CA, passed overwhelmingly and signed by governor Brown in 15
@BenScionti I don’t have a problem with Meeks but as someone who hates anti vaxxers with a passion I want Maloney gone...... I was in Sacramento during the #sb277 hearings
@JAllen_BR It wouldn’t surprise me if she ran for Gov/AG especially if Cuomo retired....... Tish would be the frontrunner to replace him if that happened
@JAllen_BR She brags too much about being a BX girl to forfeit gaining more of BX if Engel were to retire
@JAllen_BR It depends what happens, methinks Engel retires, especially under a presidem, creating 2 Westchester seats along with handing AOC/Espaillat North BX..... wouldn’t surprise me either if AOC ran for higher office and got crushed that cycle a la Moynihan/Abzug in 76
@JAllen_BR My god they rly are delusional are they......  Thank god she lives in BX and not Astoria otherwise it wouldn’t surprise me if Cuomos incumbent protection commission drew a gentrified only district

@BenScionti It’s pure spite about losing to Lee in the caucus chair vote........
@GrantWoods @BenScionti Go get her Grant........ McCain’s raging  with anger from up there somewhere
@SheltieMac It wouldn’t surprise me given that her district is losing population that hers was broken up and combined during redistricting with one of the other NY dems..... it wouldn’t surprise me either if she ran a suicide run for higher office either (AG/GOV) that year
@notcapnamerica The black community needs to show them they mean it to GTFO by challenging Tlaib in Detroit...... She only won because of a split black field and snuck thru by less than a point. I’m sick and tired of her as well
Somehow not realizing that leaking this to the press will prove everything I know to be true about just us dems. The Jeffries attempt sounds like pure sour grapes after not being able  to use a black woman against Pelosi by using the exact same fucking strategy...... https://t.co/Mwn8V6pYzA

Mcfaul is right, Putin will lose the long game even further if we elect a presidem in 2020.

@Patrickesque @FT Well FT isn't doing themselves any favors by using a Corbynista.......
@neeratanden We who knew the truth got bullied for it because ppl were blind, paid or willfully ignorant of the truth...... I felt smth funny about Trump-Putin in August of 15 and never looked back
This thread is worth a read........ A lot of it (the rumors, the disinfo) is why I waited until March of 16 to back Clinton but did so because I did not under no circumstances want Donald Trump in the White House tho it wasn't support of her in the beginning I did come round https://t.co/SSTYQr41R3
@magi_jay Wonderful thread, you like so many dems have had (me included, tho I had a hunch already in 2015) to deal with a nightmare literally, we were used by the Russians who literally played on our feelings/sentiments just to put a Putin-freindly POTUS in the White House.
@weedlewobble @WASBAPPIN In the end we who are members of the tribe get screwed over......
And btw didn't u get paid by a RW donor once? And real dems aren't donor bought, they're elected by the ppl for the ppl unlike ur ppl who pay heavy dues to a sham pack and last I checked u and AOC along with other bernouts are on CNN/MSNBC all the time, heckJD  was on Maddow once
There are plenty of LW online stars that don't act like useful idiots to conspiracy theorists like Dave Pakman and the Pod Bros. Still butthurt abt u being fired from MSNBC eh? The only reason Faux news hires ppl like Tomi and Kirk is cuz there's no such thing RW talent....... https://t.co/ZHgPWTfHtT
@DrJasonJohnson The black community was begging for the crime bill u fucking grifter. My mom worked with a patient who's family was gunned down in East Palo Alto in the early 90s and some friends of ours got carjacked not long afterwards. The CBC and other black leaders begging for help
This people, is why they were easily able to cancel out disinfo by the putincept earlier this year https://t.co/aCCoduMjVV
Clinton immediately disavowed Mark Penn and many in Clintonworld despise him, Morris and Schoen pretty deeply. Meanwhile Bernie invites Nina, Sarandon and Cornel up to his retreat in Vermont, also there was far more at stake in 16 than in 08, like SCOTUS and this republic itself https://t.co/0b6xCxAYcp
@MrDane1982 Danny Glover
@msleen1970 @DrJasonJohnson @Lawrence These bernouts don’t get that the GOP hates the idea of anyone who isn’t white voting, oh I forgot they do to
The rising stars on the right ca. 2013...... https://t.co/AVDhQP2SFC
@notcapnamerica Not surprised....... My mom asked me about Abrams right before election and never about AOC. Ppl are inspired by the black woman stepping up a challenge and being a fighting class act instead of being a dumb drama queen
@tomwatson @AndreaSCousins Well just us dems don’t give a fuck about voting rights so I’d say yet again he’s wrong
@_waleedshahid @CynthiaNixon You wouldn’t love some of them cuz you lot don’t give a fuck about letting ppl vote..... You love voter suppression aka low turnout split primaries to ram more AOCs thru as well as not giving a fuck about implementing same day voter reg/AVR which Cuomo and Stewart Cousins do
If u actually read some of the proposals I don’t think ur old boss wouldn’t (like all bernouts) pushed for expanding voting since we know you guys love low turnout split primaries that produced bimbo AOC and anti-democracy caucuses. No new AOC gets rammed thru w/same day primary https://t.co/SIbHIn77cE
@reesetheone1 How stupid was Obama? He should’ve endorsed her in 2015 like Harkin and Sherrod did, ppl who could’ve made it far worse had they not endorsed her
@JAllen_BR Agreed, many young ppl just didn’t see what was at stake (at least until the summer) nor could they recognize the truth because a whole generation and a half didn’t remember KGB antics and many more forgot sadly
I endorsed Hillz and she grew on me in March of 16 as I realized there was way too much at stake including the republic itself....... The bernouts never could and never will understand it tho as many hate America and believe Putin over the CIA https://t.co/QmzsGz970J
There is a difference between Bernie voters who want to move on/see their mistake and those who are bernouts and grifters. There were quite a few like him among my friends, yet many have since told me (almost none of em thank god read the putincept or watch TYT) that I was right https://t.co/nGoahK2agj
@aseemru @BenScionti @LikeIGive_Adam Karen Handel is more (sorta)
@aseemru Jason Lewis
@Ramsey_663 I saw that....... it wouldn’t surprise me if he lost the entire Midwest if only one Midwesterner entered. Also he won’t earn a single state in New England either
Not surprising...... they say Hillary’s unpopular and despised but why are there far more Bernie caucusers who seem to be regretting supporting him? https://t.co/ZC35rnwThY
You know abolish ice is dead when a just us dem is calling for accountability........ https://t.co/7vyqyetnut
@ScottMStedman @razingarizona Devine had worked with a Putin ally in Serbia in 2014........ that should have raised flags
@hrcsupervol01 @ScottMStedman Literally teared up when I saw your tweet here. You felt the way I felt then. I myself tried to tell the public but they were unwilling to listen. I knew scrapping the TPP was pro-China, how Russia was at least using Trump and Bernie and how many progressives took the bait
@ScottMStedman @KaraCalavera Thank you for realizing your mistake....... Tho plenty of ppl out there knew it from day 1 and as an investigative journalist you should’ve looked around and asked more questions, especially to ppl who recognized this campaign style from Europe and warned us back in 2015
@lizrdeb @tomwatson @AndreaSCousins Didn’t the NYT have a scoop on gianaris efforts in among others recruiting Biaggi?
@notcapnamerica Despite being 90s kid af I got accused of being a boomer by the rose brigade. Triggered him probably when I said Obama was popular among young ppl
@tomwatson @AndreaSCousins They also credit her with disbanding the IDC.......... Not true when Gianaris/Stewart Cousins and several grassroots groups did the work well before she got on the scene
@stellaaaa @markos @RepBarbaraLee It’s because ppl like the Putincept and Cenk revise history to the bernout cult
Everyone who was paying attention knew all along.......... https://t.co/RLhy5ZmLK6
@BenScionti I don’t think Gallego will run with him in the majority for the first time in his career...... It’s what prevented many from stepping up in NY when Hillz became SOS
@dhmontgomery @travis_gaither PA is more 2 trends in 1 state with the philly area trending blue and SWPA outside of Pittsburgh trending red. Bush came within 2 points of winning it in 04, and Gore in 00. Clinton and Obama are the only 2 dems in the last 30 years to win it by a substantial margin
The truth is Idris is just speaking a fact of life. If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear https://t.co/7H0BUfrWjz
@kerril35 @RoseAnnDeMoro Public option not single payer but the original PO is similar to what the Dutch, the Swiss and the Germans use
@Carolinamidwife He reminds ppl of Obama without exactly being Obama...... The truth is everyone in this thread misses him prolly and also experience and the fact that unlike Trump, he's generally known and respected abroad
Fuck you. We don't give a fuck abt you bernouts and your sham hijacked union, We told you to fuck off when you thought Trump would do M4A and you told us to ditch Obamacare and guess what we succeeded and allowed the #bluewave to happen. Bernouts are losing cuz they hate the poor https://t.co/Eg0Aywkqcz
@RoseAnnDeMoro Have you no shame? As a nurse I thought you would actually give a fuck about the Americans who actually can get quality healthcare thru the ACA. Many who didn't have health insurance pre-2010 are able to get it thru the ACA, so pls for once stop fucking the poor ffs
@Deoliver47 As someone who's watched Kamalas career from SF DA to AG from 45 mins across the bay, Ive always had a good laugh at those idiots who claim she isn't a progressive or bothered to reform the system. Yet again it proves bernouts are in a cult and Bernard is Jim Jones/Charles Manson
@reesetheone1 @msleen1970 @Kamalaallday @SER1897 @RachelBitecofer Yeah
This shouldn't be coming from a Hillz/Holder/Schumer alum....... The judges that just fucked us hard were W appointees ffs and sadly until Trump dems didn't give a fuck about the courts https://t.co/Gtamx8rqeg
@msleen1970 @Kamalaallday @reesetheone1 @SER1897 @RachelBitecofer I also think the same about Gilchrist and Stratton.......
@roon0292 I support a public option 150% as I’ve seen it in action in the Netherlands.....
@roon0292 As someone who’s had experience with countries with UHC both with and without SP systems, Schumer is right. Somehow bernouts keep not mentioning the Netherlands which has private health insurance and a public option as well as Germany and Switzerland being similar systems
@reesetheone1 Who don’t bother to research that the ACA Medicaid expansion was neutered in 2012.......
@Mel_Ankoly @imillhiser Agreed, McConnell is sadly a man who’s willing (like most of today’s GOP) to shove whatever RW crap down the throat of Americans whether they like it or not.
@reesetheone1 Biden strikes me as Lieberman in 02 at this point....... Ppl know who he is but most ppl don’t know who the actual f to vote for come primary day
@armandodkos Its because we dems actually believe in government.......
Dont u know how to read a poll rose idiot??? The ones who least recognize economic realities are the GOP/conservatives which you "conveniently" pretend doesn't exist https://t.co/A07C6BX62o
Hillz is always a class act........ The #womanwave that she started after her loss wont be going anywhere. Be like Hillz and show some class and grace unlike #putinsbitch https://t.co/BWN7NpenvC
@Kamalaallday @reesetheone1 I haven’t made my decision who to vote for yet....... It’s too early but I’m open to anyone but Bernie, Tulsi and Warren
You were part of the anti Hillary smear campaign that elected Donald Trump......... https://t.co/O3zjzxBuZW
@Kamalaallday @reesetheone1 Like I said I know the bernouts head is full of shit regarding charter schools, I personally know ppl who were charter students their entire schooling and they’ve done quite well. And I’m not objecting to Bookers support for charters at all, I even defended Hakeem on that regard
@JConabicycle @reesetheone1 No, I just don’t think he’s that good a retail politician and his personality seems a little fake at times...... My opinion
@Kamalaallday @reesetheone1 I’m well aware the anti charter ppls heads are full of shit. I personally don’t think Bookers personality is that strong tbh with ya........ Btw if ur attacking me for being a bernout look at my tl
A lying POS, an asshole bernout, an uncompromising sore loser and an ugly podcaster walk into a bar nuff said.... https://t.co/QLQ98rKJTL
Putin’s at it again........ https://t.co/EmW6JgsFTk
@reesetheone1 Bookers inauthentic and I don’t trust Americans to vote for a vegan if they voted for Trump
@Maggy92824460 Catherine Cortez Masto...... the woman who succeeded him
@Maggy92824460 Agreed, while I like CCM, Reid is 10x the man Schumer is in terms of standing up to him. I’ve said for a while that he and Pelosi are the best parliamentarians of this century
@Maggy92824460 Ralston calls him that so.....
Prince Harry really built a dem infrastructure in NV...... https://t.co/79KQ1erjUN
@Patrickesque They were blown out...... I remember it well
My hometown paper is asking whut I’ve been thinking since 2015 https://t.co/hDkqKCQ9cZ
@Patrickesque I’m not surprised his Iowa faves soured after all the JD/OR candidates lost the primaries last June
@notcapnamerica John Edwards and Hillz led Obama in IA polls at this point in 06 so don’t get scared tho thank god Warrens in worse shape
Harris, Bernie and Warren aren’t in good shape here but time will tell https://t.co/IMM7gebPFg
@imillhiser Reid saw what was coming when he forced Obama to nuke the filibuster for lower court judges
Harry is quickly becoming the bernouts worst nightmare....... https://t.co/7d2NwizT5p
@SheltieMac Look at the polls in Dec 06		https://t.co/SeXo8VltGb
Say goodbye to all those most popular pol in America claims https://t.co/Ekrj9E1jBN
@GabeTheCentrist Same here plus I don’t think the USA will elect a vegan.......... I don’t have any faves atm but it wouldn’t surprise me if it became clear much later than we expected
For all this supposed claim of Bernouts midwestern strength, this is bad, Uncle Joe outperforming him and Beto within striking distance https://t.co/RWI15Ep6Zd
@GabeTheCentrist I have my feelings about all of em...... My only litmus test is a vision to get us to a better republic
@msleen1970 @AnnaNotaro22 Instead of her*
@msleen1970 @AnnaNotaro22 I wish they’d appointed Steve Israel instead of him when Hillz became SOS. Got a soft sport for him. Had Crowley retired instead of him in 16 he would’ve become caucus chair and spared us AOC...... I hate her with a passion, reminds me of the drama queens I’ve dated tbh with ya
@GabeTheCentrist @SheltieMac True true
@SheltieMac Idk..... this field is far too early to get a read on
@msleen1970 @AnnaNotaro22 I noticed her willingness to do anything to get elected long before Franken
@SheltieMac Not everyone got on the failed abolish ice train, she did
@AnnaNotaro22 @msleen1970 Gillum would’ve been a great governor........ I liked his slogan especially (we should use bring it home again), however I despise both Van and Kirsten with a passion. Vans a sellout and Kirsten’s a flip flopper who’s too much of a moralist to be POTUS
@armandodkos She has that Alan Grayson/Dennis Kucinich/Cynthia McKinney vibe about her..... plus she’s a bit of a bimbo tbh with ya
@OfficialClayyy Agreed, if she won it likely would mean someone not from NYC/LI/Westchester would be sacrificed.
Not that spineless blonde pls? She flip flops to appease the bernouts and pushed Al Franken out. She’s a lightweight as well https://t.co/Sr1cCyn15H
There’s a reason ppl call Cenk a hothead........ what did we say about Bernie being the political equivalent of Jim Jones. I’ve had enough of him, however ppl are listening to us and not them as they’ve lost all credibility https://t.co/OMmmHg3Fki
@notcapnamerica The shitty predictor does it again...... I remember him actually going to Europe when the VA election happened....
Hillz is not to be played with..... Calling out the right wing conspiracy in Matt Lauers face back in 98 and now this shows u who’s boss https://t.co/NEQPaVnzSt
@queerBengali Well truth is he doesn’t want ppl to give a fuck that he like Trump is a slave for Putin
@Nancy78316588 Especially if they choose to do so when the average Joe and Jane have yet to see a better living standard lately with the economy on the verge of another recession.....
Interesting.... there’s a reason the Russians and their useful idiots want Macron gone https://t.co/RairvPDTIy
Elections have consequences for the last fucking time https://t.co/jLwIhRNDib
@williamlegate Anti corruption measures
@SpryGuy @TheodoreFogel 150% agreed, and we all kept trying to tell everyone what we knew.....
@GutterGarbage Combination of fraud and Bruenig
@brianefallon There’s a reason Reid knew they had to nuke the fillibuster......
@elium2 And that’s up and down the ballot I may add
@elium2 Definitely GA-07, I had long felt that after last November’s results in VA that every slightly Trump/Clinton won suburban R was a sitting duck
Reese is right..... you laughed at us regarding healthcare and look where you’ve ended up, the callous disregard for the poor never ceases to surprise or shock me https://t.co/xLsm6vUSb1
@IAmKrishanPatel Which is quite sad...... The only dem prez who understood the courts had to be stuffed to the brim was Carter
@KaraCalavera Every time they diss Beto they lose more young ppl....... Young women soured on him at least after 11/8/16 and many of my closest friends who are girls are undecided or pro Beto cuz “omg he’s so handsome”
@toothbrshstealr @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg The free Catalonia thing shows you’re a Russian bot period
@toothbrshstealr @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg Not respecting the dead is a real class act? HW saved the ppl of Kuwait and refused to go after Saddam despite the fact that Saddam committed war crimes like gassing his own ppl
Doubling down on ACA repeal after the voters gave a huge FU to you this November https://t.co/KRlQPw1e9s
Also many Americans seeing the dark side of protectionism for the first time in their lives will make the bernouts “Beto supported TPP fast track” argument ridiculous
@toothbrshstealr @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg Liberals do not support genocide, the only reason you bernouts even pretend to give a damn is that the opposing part against Saudi is anti-USA
Not surprised at all about this polling, many Americans have woken up from Trumps shitting on America and not giving a fuck abt the world despite claims from certain Bernouts https://t.co/7AqeXNjS5w
@KaylaraOwl @pplswar As someone who grew up in the Bay Area I can’t say I’m surprised
@notcapnamerica They always drop the “paid whatever it is” when they lose the argument cuz they don’t have any sense of reality
@toothbrshstealr @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg Given your multiple revisionist and false tweets I’m not surprised you callled me pro genocide
You think the same GOP judges will give a shit about M4A? This is why I don’t identify as a progressivex10000 I’ve known their contempt for the poor is just as strong if not worse than the Kochs. I consistently saw bernouts reliving 09-10 while we were fighting to save our HC https://t.co/9Ota77OA3p
@ezraklein We can’t trust you progressives with defending ppls health care can we? Do you even think GOP judicial activists give a shit if M4A polls well? Obamacare won us back the house ffs
@toothbrshstealr @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg I’m not apologizing for what’s happening in Yemen troll, Im calling out your inability to see that ppl who have just taken new jobs back home have to transfer into those new jobs. You can’t be in Washington when you have a transition team back in Santa Fe/St Paul/Denver
@elizahecht @Cakedaddy4ever @DazInSydney @BernieSanders @SenSanders @TinaDesireeBerg They had a legitimate reason as they were taking offices in their home states and there’s a major difference between an abstention and voting present, abstain and absent were grouped together so we’ll probably never know who was present there and then
