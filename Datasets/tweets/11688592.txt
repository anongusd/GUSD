@nikkiusher And I'd argue that the trust that people have for local news (if they still have it) is a better entry point for these conversations than some national TV personality trying to do it.
@nikkiusher I surmise the loss of local news outlets is a big reason why people probably don't even think about local journalists as "journalists" in the context of this poll. Also, it's way easier to make a 1:1 connection locally than nationally.
60% of respondents to this @CJR poll think journalists are sometimes or very often paid by their sources. 		If this isn't a sign that local communities need facetime with journalists, I don't know what is.   https://t.co/vMNnERvpyx

@marinonachison I think the snarking was appealing, so we'll see
I just had to describe Twitter to a non-user:		"It's like Facebook except they don't even pretend to care about causing harm and instead of your friends and family, it is just made up of people trying to outsnark one another on their company's time."		 Did I do that right?
@DaveOBrienCT Yeah. He barely existed on national political Twitter and he absolutely does stuff like this to try to get attention from reporters with more followers. He has probably doubled his follows since yesterday. And for what? Not enough actual reporting out there to keep people busy?
@DaveOBrienCT On Twitter, this “bullying” amounts to a sad boy writing in his slam book, not shoving people into a locker. It would be lost in the stream if reporters weren’t tying to score cheap points by highlighting it. We need to stop giving oxygen to wannabe provocateurs.
For once in their lives I wish reporters would stop and think before rushing to shame, and thus far more widely spread, the hateful tweets of some nobody on Twitter.

@straussanator Low energy
You know things are bad in Mets country when fans won’t even heckle an opposing fan on the subway on the way to the game.
@emilybell I would add remembering that not everyone is on social media. Journalists and public figures make up like 90% of Twitter, it’s an echo chamber, not a replacement for actually talking to your audience/sources.
Aside from an interest in mid/disinformation, #misinfocon attendees also seemingly share an inability to whisper quietly while someone on stage is talking. It’s a small room, fam, we can all hear you. Use DMs, please.
@Indira_L @pulitzercenter An excellent choice on their part! Congrats!
As @Flygirltwo said at #misinfocon - visuals really sell dis/misinformation, especially real images presented in a false light. We see this daily in the work of disinformation purveyors like Infowars, my parents, etc. Easiest to find, hardest to judge or suppress at scale.

@eScarry @bennyjohnson It’s so comforting to know white male plagiarists will forever have no trouble getting work.

If publishers are relying on the platforms for their incoming ad $ and biz model, they are “already dead and don’t even know it” says @marklittlenews #nx17 👏🏻
Merely being a woman with a voice online is to be inviting abuse. I’d like to think we are in an era where the threats against women can be taken seriously, but what will actually be done? #NX17
@AntheaButler: Women of color experienced systemic abuse on Twitter long before Gamergate made headlines. We were the canaries on the coal mine. #nx17
Why do we undertake weeks of coverage of a terror attack in the US or Europe, but hardly a peep if it happens in ME or Africa? Panel: ”Terror is when the audience feel terrified and that happens when you can mirror yourself at the scene.”  Hm. #nx17

I’m not going to tweet about RT’s very defensive session at #NX17 because they have plenty enough of a fanbase to chatter on Twitter, but I’ll say it is full out bananas.
Publishers aren’t who FB should be asking for advice on how the audience wants to consume news - we have been guessing at that for years. I hope FB shares data from real people UX tests on Newsfeed. #NX17

@twone2 @filloux Sadly, they are already doing it and many parts of the fake campaigns we thought up we found were already real.
@twone2 As in, the fake campaign or the tactics? The tactics are already out there and in use right now, so journalists need to learn how they work.

@WKSUJeff I am! Just for a few days.
Of course there's some unidentified US Brolympian loudly, incorrectly narrating a Facebook Live video at Christ the Redeemer #rio2016 🇺🇸
While waking through #Rio's Rocinha Favela, we hear gunfire, which our guide calls "Mafia Whatsapp" #Rio2016 https://t.co/6UFSp2Publ
@nataliewsj I'll venture out later today for local food. Not much in the way of food options around the village, so breakfast will be a loss
Imagine the worst "free" motel breakfast you've ever had, but pay $9 for it. That is breakfast in the #rio2016 media village.
Google is the greatest. I've used the Translate app to talk back and forth w/the staff at the media village, such a lifesaver #rio2016
Admittedly, I'm geeking right the hell out over this #rio2016 passport stamp https://t.co/usFPBnnGzL
The moment I step off the plane in #Rio, I'm handed a gold bottle of Coca-Cola. And so it begins.
