It should be a MUCH bigger deal that during the Trump-Kim summit:		-Trump said the US and North Korea had a “special relationship,” a term reserved for our best allies		-Trump wouldn’t allow journalists to have free access, undermining a long tradition of American leaders abroad
Jared Kushner should never have been given a security clearance.		Another thing @realDonaldTrump has lied about.

Don’t believe anyone who tells you that you can’t protect the environment and grow the economy at the same time.		In California, we’ve made great progress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while experiencing excellent growth in GDP and per capita income.
Trump declaring an “emergency” over his wall would be an unconstitutional abuse of his powers as commander in chief.		He has completely failed to make the case that our national security requires his wall.		The House should repudiate any such emergency declaration immediately.
Reminder that while House Democrats were unified on two key votes to fund the government last week, five House Republicans voted with us on one bill and seven supported the other bill.		The Republicans are divided, not us.

Reminder that Democrats have offered options to re-open government that include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security — just not Trump’s ineffective, expensive wall.		Our new House Democratic Majority will pass legislation to re-open government on Day One.

Dear @DarrellIssa: did you really just say that it was “not unreasonable” for Trump to cast doubt on the conclusions of American intelligence with regard to Russian interference in the 2016 election?  Even for you, this is disgraceful. https://t.co/4ye3O9QH8C
This was a chance for @realDonaldTrump to call out Putin for his obvious role overseeing at least a dozen Russian officials interfering in the election.  Instead, he chose to side with Putin and cast blame on our intelligence agencies for defending our country.  It’s abominable.
Earlier today, @realDonaldTrump stood side by side with Vladimir Putin and called the U.S. investigation of Russian interference in our elections “a disaster for our country.”  Trump’s behavior, which some are calling treasonous, is inexcusable and must be addressed.

Trump’s latest move to undermine the ACA “will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small business owners” and “will undermine Americans’ access to affordable coverage, particularly those who need medical care the most.”  https://t.co/HbUbBAuZAg
Just a reminder that the Environmental Protection Agency came into being with support from Richard Nixon. The Clean Air Act passed almost unanimously with broad support from Republicans.  Working towards a cleaner, healthier planet should not be a partisan issue.
The Trump Administration refuses to stop insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more because of pre-existing conditions.  We can’t allow them to succeed.  This is not a partisan issue — it’s just common sense. #ProtectOurCare

It’s painful to ask every few days, but why is @EPAScottPruitt not yet fired?  Where are the Republicans who will stand up and do the right thing?  Total cowardice.
Dear @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP:		How many more children need to needlessly suffer before you stand up to this administration and demand an end to this madness?  Your political cowardice is astonishing.
“what kind of country... tells destitute victims of rape, domestic abuse and gang violence that not only are they unwelcome here, but we’ll punish them and their children by locking them up separately before shipping them back to the nightmare they fled?” https://t.co/DXQvDu8fLF

Our strength as a nation comes from our moral leadership.  This next election, nothing short of our standing in the world is at stake.
To restate the obvious, no law suddenly required separating young children from their parents. This was a deliberate policy decision by Jeff Sessions and others in the Trump Administration.  Trump created this disgraceful mess but lacks the humanity and judgment to clean it up.

We must fully investigate the conduct of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.  Use of taxpayer resources for personal gain is unacceptable.  Criminal statutes against public corruption must be enforced.

This campaign is about far more than me or any of the other candidates. This is about whether we have a Congress that holds this president accountable.
Some will say this primary election has left us more divided as Democrats. But the reality is that thanks to the efforts of the campaigns and organizations like @flipthe49th and Indivisible, more Democrats voted in this race than anyone expected.
In this critical election, we should be proud that our party had a great field of candidates to run for this office. I have not just competed with them as rivals, I know they are patriots who love America and desperately want to make this country better.
I have exciting news to share. Thanks to your hard work and commitment, we have built a substantial lead in the race for CA49 and we are ready to declare victory.  This victory is for YOU! https://t.co/nfcvbgieb5

Now the president says he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself.		Republicans in Congress stay silent. No inquiry. No scrutiny. No thought of any kind. Not because they believe in Trump’s judgment, but because they fear him.  		That's not democracy. That's authoritarianism.

My grandparents taught me to appreciate people of all backgrounds.		My mom’s parents emigrated from Mexico as children.  As my mom says, “the Dreamers of their day.”		My dad’s Jewish parents couldn’t use the name Levin in their business due to discrimination.		We can’t turn back.
When we lift one another up, there’s nothing we can’t do.  		When we appreciate our differences rather than divide on the basis of them, there’s nothing we can’t do.  		There are more of us who wish to unite than divide.  		That’s what made our country great in the first place.

Though difficult to imagine, it appears the president’s dishonesty is getting worse.  It is more important than ever that we take back the House.  He must be held to account.  https://t.co/v2TeViBZxg
The two leading Republicans in our race for Congress, @RockyChavez4CA and @DianeHarkey, both have “A” ratings from the @NRA.  We don’t need another member of Congress who is bought by the corporate gun lobby. https://t.co/9xExfy33HU
My grandpa fought in World War II and taught me about patriotism and American values.  He fought for the right for others to stand for what they believe in.  No doubt, he would have supported the right for those to #TakeAKnee.

Did Trump and Cohen break campaign finance law?  Short answer: if Trump knew about the payment, and if it was designed to help the campaign and it wasn’t properly disclosed, then it was illegal.
Trump’s tweets and Giuliani’s comments raise more questions.  If there was no affair, why did Trump agree to pay Daniels?  What were the details of Trump’s reimbursements to Cohen?  How does Trump explain his contrary statements while aboard Air Force One last month?
I don’t know why any country would make a deal with the United States after we told another country that we would no longer live up to a deal that we had just made.
@mlbosin Thank you!
Rudy Giuliani appears to have just admitted that Trump seriously violated campaign finance law by repaying Cohen $130,000.

Clean air should not be a partisan issue.  Shame on Trump and corrupt Scott Pruitt for wanting to undermine the right of California and many other states to fight for less pollution from cars.  We are fighting back.  It’s not going to happen!
Corrupt Scott Pruitt doesn’t care about environmental protection.  At this point, he only cares about protecting himself and the big polluters.		Congress needs to call on Pruitt to resign immediately.  He will go down as one of the worst cabinet officials in American history.

It’s long past time that we impose reasonable limitations on the president’s authorization for use of military force.  Congress needs to uphold its Constitutional obligations.  No more blank check — not for Syria, North Korea, or anywhere else.
Just a reminder that @realDonaldTrump repeatedly cautioned President Obama against taking military action against the Assad regime, saying “MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN” if the United States intervened.

I miss waking up and reading the news of the day without the President of the United States tweeting utter nonsense.
@fawfulfan I hear you.  We can agree to disagree on this one.  Plenty of other good and equally effective ways for campaigns to spend the money.
I challenge all Democrats running for Congress across the country to stop running any ads on Sinclair Media.
Now Trump wants to revoke California’s ability to set its own clean air standards for vehicle emissions.		This is the latest example of Trump’s unconscionable policy war on California.  		California Republicans are either with Trump or with our state — there’s no middle ground!
Sinclair Media is one small step above the type of state-run propaganda used by dictators.  We must protect our free press and relentlessly stand up for the truth!
Either @realDonaldTrump has forgotten or simply doesn’t care that over 80 percent of Americans support continuing DACA.		Dreamers contribute to our economy and our communities, and we must not stop fighting to keep hardworking families together and for a pathway to citizenship.

Thanks to my wonderful wife for speaking at the South Orange County Democratic Club while I was speaking at the Association of Cannabis Professionals meeting in San Diego https://t.co/b2ZU2ILzQH

Meet Diane Harkey, Darrell Issa's handpicked successor.  She's too extreme for our district.		Harkey once even voted against a bipartisan bill that required our schools to provide free drinking water to children.  		As a father of two young children, I find that unconscionable. https://t.co/dswVU2nv5p
Trump’s call to Putin demonstrated once again that with this administration we are no longer the moral leader of the free world.
Trump’s national security team wrote him a memo in advance of his call with Putin that said, among other things:		“DO NOT CONGRATULATE.”		Maybe Trump just didn’t read the memo — or worse, he read it and had motives other than our national security.		https://t.co/Gqblvc5ZB9
New polls from @ChangePolls and @ppppolls show our June primary election is very close, with Rocky Chavez and me advancing.  That’s where I beat Chavez by 8 points.

@OPSVeracity @MomsDemand Thank you!
I’m very honored to announce that our campaign has just received the Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction!  		Thank you @MomsDemand for standing up for gun violence prevention and recognizing gun safety. 		Join our campaign at https://t.co/SaNORatswF. https://t.co/ACTBkmJtUY
Yet another tragedy this morning at Great Mills High School in Maryland.		It’s time for every decent American to come to the table and stand for common-sense gun reforms. 		It’s time to stop blaming everything but guns for these tragedies.	 	Arming more teachers isn’t the answer.
Truth: “This is no time to obsess over party labels. Electing candidates of either party who will stand up to Trump is the first step in restoring a normal, decent, civilized America.”  https://t.co/VTIuxOpufe
If Democrats can win Congressional races in Trump country, we can win here in California’s 49th District, where Trump lost by 8 points.		With your help, we will win this seat and take back the House of Representatives!		Help us keep the momentum going!  https://t.co/WLBYaPIedP https://t.co/nRnwJmWyir
Cambridge Analytica must be investigated for illegal activity and prevented from doing further harm.  This is a disgrace.  https://t.co/SOEEw8yu7m
While Trump’s lawyers speak of cooperating with Mueller, Trump attacks him on Twitter.		Meanwhile, our country faces real problems and a president who can’t govern.		Trump continues to prove that he is incapable of providing the steady leadership we deserve from our president.
We need a Democratic Congress that will hold Trump accountable and begin to restore ethics to Washington.		Join @RepAdamSchiff and many others in supporting our campaign to take the seat currently held by Darrell Issa!		Chip in &gt;&gt; https://t.co/WLBYaPIedP https://t.co/Z96PqB8QkV

Yet another reason that no politician should take money from the NRA. https://t.co/ck3AN1zq1e
RT @kylegriffin1: WASHINGTON (AP) -- AP learns fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe maintained personal memos regarding President Donald…
Must-read: Cambridge Analytica stole over 50 million Facebook users’ data and used it to help Trump.  This is widespread fraud perpetrated against the American people.  They need to be thoroughly investigated and forced to delete the data they stole.  	https://t.co/KGPRvrkrT1
By firing McCabe, Trump acted out of spite, taking away the pension McCabe had earned after 21 years.  McCabe had already pledged to retire.		Trump also acted out of fear, trying to discredit an important witness in the obstruction case.		The American people can see through this.
RT @RepAdamSchiff: In the absence of the IG report, it’s impossible to evaluate the merits of this harsh treatment of a 21-year FBI profess…
Last week at our candidate debate, Republican @DianeHarkey was asked if she will take donations from the NRA.		She said, “Probably yes.  Why not?”		Why not?  How about asking the residents of Parkland, Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Bernardino and Sandy Hook why not? https://t.co/hAM92p70uo

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is worth at least $300M.  How about he reimburses taxpayers for unnecessary travel on military planes?  https://t.co/onu3aonHsQ
I was very honored when @RepAdamSchiff was the first member of Congress to endorse me.  Seven others have followed suit.
