This chapter will be a stain on @ScottforFlorida forever. Every day he delays is a day of suffering for one of us, for many of us! The cruelty and meanness is beyond the pale.
Likewise he could today, drop the state's appeal and smokeable #marijuana would be there for those who need it most:		Our veterans, our cops, our firefighters and all those with terminal illness.
Gov. Scott is smart, he read in the intent language the same thing Judge Gievers read that the voters approved, smokable cannabis was to be allowed. He must think we are all idiots. He is the Governor. He has veto power when he doesn’t like the laws passed.
.@FLGovScott says he's “just following the law” while denying the will of the people and hurting really sick people. Don’t be fooled. Gov. Scott did not want what 72% of Florida wanted; compassion for others.

Yesterday Tim, his wife, and my children flew back from Kentucky in our jet after watching three days of racing, some with our horses. We got fried chicken from a place we went to as kids and drank beer and talked about our good times.
Tim’s tragedy became my life’s work. I became enraged and used that fuel to build the largest personal injury firm in the history of the world. And then we brought medical marijuana to Florida for people like Tim. We knew it wouldnt happen in Tallahassee.
When it was all over I vowed that later in life I would go get the son of a bitches who tried to hurt those further after they had been hurt. I have never done anything but represent the powerless and I have never charged one penny by the hour.
Our mother had long since gone and she never saw Tim until 20 years later. His employer Walt Disney World, where he was hurt searching for a missing child in the lagoon treated him horribly, he was 18.
40 years ago today my brother Tim was paralyzed. The doctors told me he would not live ten years. I told them they were wrong and left the meeting.		We were poor people and the legal system chewed Tim up. We now know we chose the wrong lawyer but did not know better.
