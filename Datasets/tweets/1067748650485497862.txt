Thanks to the climate experts, infrastructure leaders, and state &amp; local officials who joined us for an important conversation this afternoon on Hampton Beach. The impacts of climate change are already here &amp; this crisis must inform our approach to infrastructure policy. https://t.co/O9xY2o9vSN

Small businesses across #NH01 tell me about the impact the #Wayfair decision is having on their bottom line. Today I visited C.B. Gitty Craft Supply, a family-owned store. They say #Wayfair will cost them a fortune. They don't deserve this undue burden. https://t.co/2XfiHAcNmK
This morning I visited Affinity LED Lighting. They’re proud to employ veterans, and their business is successful because of it. As a member of the VA Subcommittee on Econ. Opportunity, I want to encourage businesses to invite veterans to join their teams. https://t.co/skPJaMdBdS

We must put an end to the Trump Admin's domestic gag rule, which impacts more than 16,000 Granite Staters who depend on Planned Parenthood &amp; other providers.		#TitleX funding keeps NH safe &amp; healthy. The Trump Admin's decision to change the rule is putting NH women at risk. https://t.co/cSnGXqG5iJ
More than 16,000 NH women depend on #TitleX funding to access family planning &amp; other crucial services, including 11,000 at @PPFA alone.		I toured the Planned Parenthood Health Center in Exeter to learn more about how the Trump Admin's domestic gag rule puts NH women in danger. https://t.co/qzsslhnem3
The #CharlestonLoophole allowed Dylann Roof to purchase a gun and kill 9 people at Mother Emanuel AME Church. Closing this loophole will prevent sellers from proceeding with a sale without a background check after 3 days. This common sense measure will save lives.

Chairman @RepCummings is right. Today's hearing is about restoring faith in American democracy. Mr. Cohen has made severe mistakes &amp; he'll pay for them in prison, but his testimony was important in getting to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 election. https://t.co/ZS0F98utrh
Wishing @SenatorHassan a happy birthday! New Hampshire is lucky to have you fighting for them in Washington every day.
For the first time in nine years the House took a step to save lives &amp; keep people safe with common sense gun safety reform, passing universal background check bill #HR8. I was proud to co-sponsor the legislation, and we must do more to curb gun violence. https://t.co/ZRHIXSq8z2
This morning I joined @RepAnnieKuster for a joint “Constituent Coffee” event. We’re right across the hall from each other in the Cannon Building, Rooms 323 and 320. If you’re ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit the New Hampshire wing! https://t.co/UYWdf73sSy

I voted to protect the separation of powers &amp; prevent the President from violating the constitution in making his emergency declaration. We have too many real crises to justify a manufactured one, especially when it means upending our system &amp; hurting crucial funding elsewhere. https://t.co/4TEwsizMbZ
The House and Senate must act in a bipartisan fashion to stop President Trump’s unconstitutional emergency declaration. We cannot allow our democracy to be undermined so he can build the border wall that the American people and Congress refuse to support. https://t.co/ukQgPjRWbh

I've co-sponsored legislation to stop President Trump from making an end run around Congress with his national emergency declaration. The President’s power grab is unconstitutional, and we need leaders from both parties to say so.
During this morning's appearance on @CNN's @NewDay Weekend, @VictorBlackwell and I discussed President Trump's shameful transgender service ban that is politicizing our military and making us less safe. I am co-sponsoring legislation to oppose this discriminatory practice. https://t.co/RJ3Hi4CKYU

This morning I toured the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard &amp; heard more from officials about necessary upgrades to support their work &amp; our security. Pres.

The govt funding package will end another shutdown threat, &amp; I‘ll support it when it comes up tonight. It invests in evidence-based border security, improves our immigration system, &amp; keeps fed. workers paid. Let's move forward on the priorities Americans sent us here to address.
READ: While I'm encouraged by the attention the @EPA is now giving to this critical issue, the federal government must go further. We need a revised MCL consistent with recent research in order to impose meaningful regulations &amp; better protect the health &amp; safety of NH families. https://t.co/LjWqe64ikz

NH should be a leader on clean energy. Instead we've lost solar jobs for 2 straight years because of President Trump's misguided tariffs &amp; lack of state support. Renewables are a win for our environment &amp; economy, and it's time to step up our investments. https://t.co/9KJlBhRyVP
2 more days to get your #ValentinesForVets in. You can drop them off at my office (660 Central Ave in Dover) or @MayorJoyceCraig's office (1 City Hall Plaza in Manchester). Let's show New Hampshire veterans how much we appreciate their service to our country. https://t.co/lHwlYN2X9x
No deal will be perfect, but it's a healthy sign that House &amp; Senate members from both parties are working to craft a compromise. This is how democracy is supposed to work. Shutting down the govt never will be an acceptable strategy for getting your way. https://t.co/L0Onesy6ZS

With the shutdown over, I'm heading back to D.C. with an open govt for my first time as a member of Congress. We have work to do to end shutdowns for good, make federal employees &amp; contractors whole, and get back to the important work ahead.
This morning I visited the VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Tilton. As a newly assigned member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I'm eager to continue hearing from veterans and staff about how we can work together to improve services and care. https://t.co/ZuH8wQbRaH
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we pause to remember the millions of Jewish victims &amp; many others persecuted &amp; killed by the Nazis. 74 years ago today Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated. It serves as a sober reminder: we must always stand up to antisemitism &amp; hate wherever it lives.

We owe these workers—and all the American people—a new way of doing business in Washington that puts political brinksmanship and shutdown politics behind us. 6/6
Today’s development is not a victory for any politician in Washington, it’s a victory for the American people. I am grateful for our dedicated federal workers who only want to do their jobs, serve their country, and provide for their families. 5/6
But we should be clear that any future threat of a shutdown has no place in the dialogue of how to keep this country safe or pass comprehensive immigration reform. No President or leader in Congress should ever use federal workers and critical services as political leverage. 4/6
The President showed why shutting down the government is never a responsible strategy. Our democratic process is the way we must work out our differences. I'm eager to be a part of good faith discussions about investing in effective, evidence-based border security proposals. 3/6
I’m looking forward to getting to work on matters critical to the people of New Hampshire with the government fully open for business. 2/6
This agreement is long-overdue &amp; an enormous relief to the 800,000 federal employees who have gone 35 days without pay. The past 5 weeks have paralyzed critical govt functions &amp; cut services.

New Hampshire families shouldn't have to suffer because of Washington dysfunction. That's why I voted to #EndTheShutdown for the 10th time today &amp; increase border security by $1.6 billion. It’s time for Senate Republicans to re-open our government &amp; allow us to get back to work. https://t.co/QlGWuEAveR
Today I voted for the 10th time to re-open the government, including $1.6 for border security. We should debate immigration reform, but we can’t do it with the government closed. 800,000 workers are not a political bargaining chip. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/pbuT3wfe2Q
Today is #Day33 of the longest government shutdown in American history. On Friday, more than 800,000 Americans will miss their 2nd paycheck.

We’re on day 17 of the #TrumpShutdown.		A government doesn't function when it doesn't pay its workers. We become less safe and less effective, and to what end? The Senate needs to take action today or so many dedicated federal employees won't get their next paycheck.
A govt shutdown means food stamp recipients will receive $90 less this month. If it continues into March, food stamps disappear for a vulnerable population. Our social safety net can’t sustain this hit. For help or Qs, contact our office: 603-285-4300 or https://t.co/f7zG673Inz. https://t.co/0qzpoMO7DR

The basic work of our government simply isn't getting done. TSA workers are calling in sick &amp; eyeing other employment to keep their household afloat. If you're a federal worker with Qs or need help during the shutdown, contact my office: 603-285-4300 or https://t.co/f7zG673Inz https://t.co/x0h33HUaQG
Within 7 hours of being sworn in, we voted to re-open the govt. Senate leaders are abandoning their responsibility and sitting on their hands while 800K federal workers are a day away from their next paycheck being withheld. This is outrageous even by Washington standards.
I’ve been hearing from constituents who are looking at filing for unemployment to cover their most basic bills. This shutdown is hurting families in real ways &amp; its impacts will accelerate if nothing is done. Let’s end this embarrassing shutdown &amp; move on in a constructive way.
The Senate already passed the legislation we sent them to re-open the govt. It's absurd that @senatemajldr is doing the Admin’s bidding by refusing to take a vote. That's not how our checks &amp; balances work. Thousands of NH families are suffering because of this political nonsense
2,055 federal employees in NH are unpaid because of this pointless, political shutdown. The pain for these families and adverse impacts on services will accelerate next week if nothing is done. That’s why I voted to open the govt Thursday &amp; why the Senate should follow suit. https://t.co/UDu8vtrxIT
This morning I stopped by the @FIRSTweets Robotics Challenge Kickoff at @snhu. Great to see so many students ready to begin their next mission where they’ll build teamwork, leadership, and STEM skills. https://t.co/IUPPQRy96h
Some of my favorite moments from yesterday's festivities. Thank you #NH01 for your confidence and for sending me to Washington to work for you. By pushing for reform and passing bills to end the shutdown, we started off the term on the right foot. https://t.co/GW54iVTprV
It was a pleasure to celebrate a busy first day yesterday with friends, family, and fellow members of Congress, including @SenatorHassan &amp; @RepAnnieKuster! https://t.co/guaE1xvj7L
Last night I voted to re-open the govt &amp; fund it at levels agreed to by the GOP Sen. in December. A shutdown represents a catastrophic failure of our system. The American people &amp; our federal workers deserve much better. Let's get back on track &amp; work together to deliver results.
Thanks to everyone who stopped by our open house yesterday. Our offices will always be a welcoming place to those needing assistance or wishing to offer thoughts, concerns, and expertise as we face the road ahead. https://t.co/P3jU15sj5R
Congratulations to Captain Daniel Ettlich on being named the next commander of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. https://t.co/iiN6Z8GlAr
Francis Byrne was a hero of D-Day and WWII &amp; an exemplary Granite Stater. I'm saddened to learn of his passing &amp; we're all immensely grateful for his service. Before he passed, @SenatorShaheen helped him secure the Purple Heart he deserved. Rest in peace. https://t.co/JrzovcydBQ
This morning I'll join @NHPRExchange to talk about my vote to end the shutdown and my priorities in Congress. Tune into your local @NHPR station or online at https://t.co/SUX2J9nEMP at 9am to catch the interview.
On Day 1, I supported bills to end the shutdown and new House rules to restore regular order &amp; make Congress more transparent. 		There's a long session ahead, but we're already starting to see change take hold in Washington.
The new House rules will set a framework of reform and reaffirm Americans’ faith in their government. We must be able to take on bold challenges, defend hard-won progress, and restore regular order. These rules take us in that direction.
As someone who has run a small business, I could not imagine receiving a paycheck while any of my employees are working without pay. My first official act as a member of Congress is to reject a paycheck until Congress does its job and the government is re-opened. https://t.co/FpjPZfFi6s
