The Legislation stopping the National Emergency will pass and go to the President.		The question now is, by how much. Now that we know the 51st vote how many more Republicans will join on now that passage is certain?  And will that number be enough to override a veto?

@tpollyannas @futurebird @HtownDood @berningman16 @People4Bernie @The_Acumen @PrettyBadLefty I'm Team Kamala.  I have major major problems with Bernie, and taking near constant abuse from his more rabid follower, who in some cases may be Russian bots trying to worsen any divide between Democrats, but I have issues with Bernie.
RT @abracadabraNY: @admiralmpj @spifffan @MSNBC @maddow If there’s nothing in his returns, why won’t he show them?
@1x10e6 @Rubygirl123456 @denver_rose @baalat1 @MSNBC Too many schticks to keep track of.
@Toffyhammer2112 @suzyqjinx @MSNBC @SenSanders Not for me.  This is a standard thing that Candidates used to fork over without any question.  Then in 2012, Mitt Romney ducked 'em.  Four years later, BOTH Trump and Bernie ducked it.		This was never controversial.  Why is it now??
@futurebird @HtownDood @tpollyannas @berningman16 @People4Bernie @The_Acumen @PrettyBadLefty Nah, I'm Team Kamala.  And saying that, the person who has impressed me the most on the Returns issue is Senator Warren.  Ten years of complete returns on her site right now.  I expect the others to catch up, but Bernie's had a four year head start.
@TheMermaidsSong I've been sent the link...again.  I've looked at it...again.		It's a one year summary from 2014.  Nowhere near good enough for a candidate who's been running for four straight years.
@futurebird @HtownDood @tpollyannas @berningman16 @People4Bernie @The_Acumen @PrettyBadLefty This is not a gotcha question.  I don't expect to find anything controversial in his returns.  Bernie releases 'em, I stop asking about 'em. But there is a standard here we can't afford to @#$% with.  Mitt Romney tried it.  Donald Trump got away with it.  And so has Bernie.
@lollipops708 Those are the very people that I was talking about.
@Kat41150B @bookgrl5df @johnbates207 @noonski @MSNBC The funny thing is this shit wasn't considered controversial until Mitt Romney started @#%ing with it.  Now Trump and Bernie have followed suit.  If the Voters won't hold the electeds to this very reasonable standard...
@awelab1956 @chrislhayes Oh, I wanna count the number of questions he asks before he DOESN'T SOMEHOW touch on the returns.		Hell, I might even live tweet it.
@lollipops708 EXACTLY.

@futurebird @HtownDood @tpollyannas @berningman16 @People4Bernie @The_Acumen @PrettyBadLefty He's released one years worth from 2014, and it's a seven-page summary.
@IJefTomI @charrion @ConscienceColl @chrislhayes If you can't handle the questions from a LOCAL VERMONT NEWSPAPER, then you need to think about whether you should be running.
@stelladennard @AlasscanIsBack @chrislhayes Yeah, mine suck. 😬
@kgoebel We need this information.  He might be setting tax policy.  Shouldn't I be able to ensure he can't benefit from his policies?
@lollipops708 My main concern is that people who underestimate the White Nationalists of the world kinda let things like that happen because it doesn't affect them directly, and then they have the nerve to demand patience from those of us who are directly being affected.

@lollipops708 Ah, but is that what I'm saying?  My argument was not to lessen your experience but to highlight that even our staunchest allies may be underestimating the sheer evil coming out of the White Nationalist side.
@PortiaMcGonagal @chrislhayes I'm hearing he is.  I might watch just to count the number of times @chrislhayes DOESN'T ask him about his Tax Returns.
@IJefTomI @chrislhayes I'm supporting Kamala, but I gotta give Elizabeth Warren a lot of credit.  She has a whole page on her website just for returns.  Good on her.		The @DNC needs to enforce its rules, that's all we're asking.
@CandaceHorgan @MSNBC Chuck wants a race.  He doesn't care about the issues.
@Toffyhammer2112 Several State Governments (like California) passed it, but it our case our outgoing Democratic Governor (whom I like in all other respects) vetoed it.  He had questions over its constitutionality.
RT @IronSharky: Aaaaamen! https://t.co/qOSH01RqFu
@Toffyhammer2112 @suzyqjinx @MSNBC @SenSanders So do I, but for some reason, he's hiding something.		He's had four years to prepare these returns.		Where are they?		Release them and it's a one day story.		Hold them back, and...well, we gotta keep asking.
@Toffyhammer2112 @suzyqjinx @MSNBC @SenSanders She actually released 8 years worth: https://t.co/1e7CzFQL8y

@IJefTomI @chrislhayes Why Jay.		Whatever do you mean?		https://t.co/Vpz0SwwNKT
This is not a "gotcha" question.		We need to see at least one decades worth of returns from people who will be setting tax policy in the United States.		We can't demand of Trump what we aren't willing to demand of our own candidates.		Bernie releases the returns, the story ends. https://t.co/nXkBqjjoq1
Sample questions for @chrislhayes which I doubt he'll ask:		1) Where are your Tax Returns?		2) You've had four years to prepare for this question, why aren't they ready now?		3) How can we expect Donald Trump to release his tax returns if you don't release yours?
@libertyuprising @MSNBC Have you tried looking at the link?		It's a summary for one year (as @suzyqjinx) said.		He's been getting ready to run this campaign for four years.  FOUR YEARS before this, he was allowed to dodge the question of his tax returns.		Warren has a whole page set up.		Where are his?

@rachelknjgirl @MSNBC I'm a Kamala supporter, actually.		He did not release his returns.  This is a false statement.		Again, he released one year's summary statement from 2015.		Trump leased one year's summary from 2005.		Both of these are not good enough.		He's had four years.  Where are they?
