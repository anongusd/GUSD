@RepAdamSchiff Oh can it, Schiff-head.  Don't you have a meeting to go to?  Where you excuse yourself to the restroom to call up your Press-buddies while dropping deuces in the commode?!?
@JebBush @realDonaldTrump Low energy Jeb giving his Low-T response.
@laurawbush Why is this just now coming out as if it's Trump's fault?  He has tried to get Congress to do something about immigration and the Democrats are blocking anything from happening. Laura, I'm sorry you have been given bad information.
@laurawbush Does she know the law that is separating the kids from their family was in effect before Trump even too office? Why didn't her husband do something about this when he was in office? Why did Obama hide this when he was in office?
