@TeriLynne31 @albedobell @bonni_who @carruthers58 @cherieh1776 @KenDilanianNBC @FBI Quoting #FakeNews is weak! Try again.
Long have I pondered a #President that actually wanted to serve the #AmericanPeople Someone that kept their promises, someone that’s a shrewd business person. Someone that knows how to make money for America. Thank You for your service @POTUS !!!	You rock!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #VoteRed
Therefor I choose the person that has the most integrity. If they’re both crooked liars, I write in MY name. Not this year, this year, the first time ever...I won’t spend a second reading anything. I plan to vote straight red. Every Republican on the ticket gets my vote.
I think it’s counter productive to vote for a person simply because of party affiliation. Why? In my lifetime the only President I liked/trusted was #PresidentKennedy and I think we can all figure out who killed him. So that leaves me to choose from a group of dishonest crooks.
I really don’t like any party. And don’t want to be associated with any party. Mostly because they’re all (almost all),scummy politicians. And both sides work as a team behind the scenes, contemplating the various ways to steal our money, and trick us into liking it.
I have a unique style of voting. I vote for the person with the highest level of integrity first, then the most pertinent experience (peanut farming etc.), then I evaluate what they say they will do, and if I believe they will. Then I look at their party.

11. She is “afraid” to fly. Yet records indicate she does fly. 	12. She teaches psychology. Which means she knows how easy it is to manipulate people, and she’s quite good at it. It also means she carries an elevated level of self confidence. Yet she presented like a weak tween.
8. What she described was my brothers horsing around daily. Minus the he couldn’t take off my clothes because I was wearing a one piece bathing suit part. (We did much worse to each other).	9. Someone paid for the polygraph...not her. 	10. She had Finestein hire a lawyer 4 her.
7. She has no data. Doesn’t know who pushed her into a room. Has no witnesses. No data on time place. Claimed she could hear the boys talk, then reversed and said she couldn’t hear what they said.
5. She’s no shrinking violet. She holds three degrees, and is a Professor..in psychology. Think about that. 	6. She’s hyper partisan, active liberal in the heart of liberal land.
***Red Flag Warning***	1. Bomb dropped in 11th hr. 2. Crazy eyes, cracking voice indicative of drug use.	3. Hair in front of face like a scared tween. 	4. Baby talk voice (Over sold her “trauma”) https://t.co/QkrB9et7If

@DRUDGE_REPORT Bet that cop got an eyeful.
@Brocktune2 @PrisonPlanet It’s not their fault. We’re being bombarded non-stop with lies, half truths and deception. Seemingly smart people are really just reading from a TelePrompTer on your #FakeNews station. Watch their eyes go back and forth. They have no opinion, it’s their handlers opinion.
@KrisParonto @DNC @dncpress @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris Both parties are the same...Mitch M and Nancy P...the same. They work together to steal our money. Sure one seems kookier than the other because they brainwash us demographically. But make no mistake, they are all in on the free for all. One side just gets more candy.
@Brocktune2 @PrisonPlanet The main thing to keep in mind is that it’s on purpose. That’s why it seems so crazy for most of us. But the “leaders” of the world (some), want it this way. We can’t fight them if we’re too busy pulling knifes out of our backs.
@FoWLChi @LeeCamp That explains why drug slavery exists in America. You smoke a joint, go to jail, fight fire for free. That just incentivized arresting people.
@FoWLChi @LeeCamp Wow. Thanks for the Education.
@Brocktune2 @PrisonPlanet Guns are a metaphor in this case. What happened in the U.S. when we were flooded with paper impaired migrants? Everyone here has higher rents, lower wages, longer commute times, more crime, fewer jobs, fewer desks in school, college, less safety net resources. Etc.

Same thing happens when you open the prison doors and flood the hood with crime. People use resources like medical, food, shelter goes up, burn cars requiring new ones
@rakuenCallisto @homerforus @PrisonPlanet No. It’s partially about votes. Mostly it’s about shaking the bee hive and then selling smoke to calm the bees. We’re the bees. They’re the shakers. The smoke is everything we consume to deal with this mess.

@qwertyabcxyz1 @LondonBreed @GLIDEsf @SFFound @stanthonysf @CapitalOne A heroin clinic will have .gov official heroin instead of the CIA spiked crap we have now.

@clscjones @KatTimpf Such an easy task. What with the .gov complex being so honest and all. Kids are wracked with disease and #Cannabis is the only medicine that works for them and #Obama made #CBD a Schedule I Narcotic. Why? Corruption!!! It's the money...as usual.
@KatTimpf That's not his priority! He needs to keep those strangers away from that replacement medicine. There are a lot of hands in the pockets of big pill mill and .gov thinks it's their job to ensure big pill mill has the cash to pay all the palms up people. #Cannabis #Freedom #KatTimpf

@FiveRights Why did #Obama make CBD a schedule I drug?Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse Examples are:		heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), methamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, peyote
Why does the .gov complex want illegal Cannabis? It's the $. Big pill mills see a huge cliff coming with the truth (as seen on https://t.co/3cY1iHLWAl) that Cannabis is natures pure medicine.

@Snowden Nor do they understand that it's not the loss of individual privacy that's the main problem, it's our collective loss that needs to be the focus of their lacking imaginations. If cops can use roadblocks to keep the murderers out, they can use them to keep us in. Freedom 1st!🇺🇸
