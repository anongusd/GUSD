@Dasani_01 @MatBabiak @crooksandliars @Karoli @PressSec You Leftists are just deranged...here's Acosta on CNN saying he never touched her.		He literally says "I didn't touch her"		He did. He's lying. You're lying. Stop covering for him.		https://t.co/Iv4YgzP7GR
@hollis517 @AP Perhaps when you're done spitting on America and Americans, you can direct just a little bit of your anger at the 3rd world cesspools run by dictators and despots these people are fleeing from...is that even remotely possible?
@JacquesCalonne https://t.co/7rNIg8giKZ
@j_razor101 And just to be clear, I don't have to justify my violence, you have to justify yours. You're the one proposing new laws (force) to get your way.		Your side has to convince the other side to accept your laws (the threat of force). If they refuse, what are you gonna do about it?
@j_razor101 And again, this is not a new concept. This is how our own country was founded. The American colonists were subjected to unfair law after unfair law and finally said enough. Talking was no longer an option. War was the only remedy.
@j_razor101 An attempt to repeal the 2A will mean civil war. That is a fact. If people try to repeal the 2A, they're saying people do not have the right to self-defense. Then there can no longer be a discussion. So violence must settle it.		Same applies to the 1A and free speech.
@j_razor101 I say, "We already have laws that restrict those rights and we've accepted them and abide by them. But beyond a point, people will no longer abide by them."		You respond, "Ah, so you don't agree with any laws"		How old are you, 12? Do you have trouble understanding words?
@j_razor101 It's strange, I say something, then you say I believe the exact opposite. I'm not sure if it's ignorance or incompetence.		Here I clearly explained that we have laws that restrict those rights and we've accepted them. But there's a point in which certain laws will not be accepted https://t.co/Y7z8NmXUrT
@j_razor101 I'm not the one suggesting the remedy is violence.		You are.		I'm telling you the response to that violence will be violence.
@j_razor101 So to bring it back around to your original question...		If you're proposing to use VIOLENCE to trample on people's rights beyond a certain point, then yes, it will be met with VIOLENCE.
@j_razor101 YOU: "I don't want violence, I just want laws!"		You cannot have laws unless they're backed by violent force...otherwise they're meaningless.
@j_razor101 You're proposing laws to restrict people's rights. Laws are FORCE. Laws are backed by the threat of VIOLENCE. And you believe that's acceptable.		It's amazing you don't understand that.
@j_razor101 If you think you can convince 200M+ Americans to repeal the 2A, go for it.		I doubt you can though. In fact, I know you can't. And you know you can't. You just want to argue, because you're mad that you know you can't. 		It's actually getting boring...
@j_razor101 I promise you, my side won't lose the argument.		As I said, you need 38 states, you won't even get 1.
@j_razor101 I've stated multiple times that we have a process to amend the Constitution. You should really get to it instead of wasting time on Twitter...the process is long and difficult.
@j_razor101 You ask, "What if the people change their minds?"		The burden is on your side to convince them to change their minds. In fact, you have to convince people in 38 States to change their minds. You won't even convince 1.		But, if you want to waste your life trying, go for it.
@j_razor101 My 'side' won the argument 242 years ago.		However, if you think you have a better way, you're free to argue for it. It's incumbent on you to convince people that the current state of things is wrong.
@j_razor101 But, who knows...maybe Jefferson, Adams, Franklin and Washington were all wrong.		Perhaps one day, society will tear down their monuments and erect statues in your honor...though I tend to doubt it.
@j_razor101 Thomas Jefferson stated my view pretty well in the Declaration of Independence. Though he said it more eloquently than I ever could. https://t.co/ISkOOOcWhI
@j_razor101 I believe in the principles the U.S. was founded on. The freedom and rights of individuals.		You don't.		That's fine.
@j_razor101 It's amusing that the Left is proposing a 2A repeal because they want to rid the country of guns, yet don't seem to realize that to enforce it would require...LOTS OF GUNS...in the hands of Govt currently run by Trump.		"Trump is Hitler! Only his Govt should have guns!" #facepalm
@j_razor101 I'll be as blunt as possible so there's no confusion...		If there is ever any serious attempt to repeal the 2A, those leading the effort to repeal it will be killed. If it's ever repealed, there will be civil war.
@j_razor101 It would be. Just as it was justified in 1776.		That you think it wasn't and that we should still be ruled by a King/Queen is amazing though.
@j_razor101 Not at all. As I said, we have a process to amend our Constitution.		People are more than welcome to try and repeal the 2A.		It'll never happen though.		And if it ever did, there would be civil war.
@j_razor101 An effort to repeal the 2A (or the 1A) would be seen as beyond that point.		Then there would be violence.		It's all academic though, because those in Govt know this and would be signing their own death warrants. So they'll never be repealed.
@j_razor101 We've accepted as a society to restrict those inherent rights. To a point.		I'd caution those in Govt to be very wary about trying to go beyond that point.
@j_razor101 Ok, let me explain what I meant.		Free speech (1A) and the right to self-defense (2A) are inherent rights. And yet, our Govt restricts them both. And there has been no violent reaction to that.		But push it beyond a point and there will be.
@j_razor101 "that's the wrong choice"		Matt, I'm not sure if you realize this but...the Founders made that decision in 1776 when they declared their independence and fought a war to break free from Great Britain.
@j_razor101 No, you have it all wrong.		You seem to not understand the difference between Natural rights and Legal rights: https://t.co/x1U2AaT5DR		Again, you're literally arguing against the entire premise the U.S. was founded on and against everything the Founders stood for.
@j_razor101 I never said inherent rights were 'granted'...in fact, I said the exact opposite. https://t.co/Sx5PHdnrWm
@j_razor101 There are all kinds of laws that restrict people's inherent free speech.		That doesn't mean inherent free speech isn't a thing.		It is.		Then people infringe on it.
@j_razor101 What? I said no such thing.		I've repeatedly explained that People/Govts can and often do infringe on people's right to free speech. But just because they infringe on it, doesn't mean it's not an inherent right or it ceases to exist.
@j_razor101 You seem to be completely missing my point...		People come together to form societies. How? By discussing the rules that society will live by. How? Using free speech to discuss it. THEN...they pass laws to restrict that speech.		Why is that simple concept so confusing to you?
@j_razor101 And there's nothing 'imaginary' about my ability to speak freely requiring nobody else to grant it to me. I was making sounds since birth and eventually formed them into coherent words.
@j_razor101 You're literally arguing against the entire premise the United States was founded on.		There's a reason the 1A starts with "Congress shall make no law" instead of "The People are granted"		It's acknowledges an inherent right and restricts Govt.
@j_razor101 Look, this is obvious to anyone with common sense. We all have free speech. Every human on Earth does. It's inherent. Not granted.		It simply means people can say anything they wish. They don't need permission.		Then people/Govts infringe on that right thru force/laws
@j_razor101 That's why you have it backwards.		They all have free speech, come together, create a society, then create laws to infringe on that free speech.
@j_razor101 Do you see the problem with your 'logic'?		How are people setting up societies and defining 'free speech'...without free speech?
@j_razor101 amusing...according to you, people have no right to speak, they come together, without speaking, form a society, without speaking, then grant each other the right to speak.
@j_razor101 Wait, how are me and this other person even talking to each other to discuss this...without the right to free speech?
@j_razor101 If I'm the last person on Earth, I have no rights?		Then you might say, "No you grant them to yourself". That = inherent.		But if there's another person alive on the other side of the world, I have to seek him out to grant me rights?		Ludicrous. You have it completely backwards.
@j_razor101 You have the inherent right to speak freely.		Only someone else can infringe on that right. That someone may be a person physically silencing you or Govt (persons) passing laws (backed by force) silencing you.
@j_razor101 No, you're speaking nonsense. 'Inherent' simply means not granted by others. I don't require someone else to grant me the ability to speak.		We are not living in some commune. We are not "all in this together", comrade...		btw, I've dropped the other ppl not in this convo.
@j_razor101 @EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis You have it completely backwards.		The right to free speech is inherent. Then Govts and people infringe on it.
@j_razor101 @EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis I don't have the right to speak freely and worship freely until some special person grants it to me?		wow...
@j_razor101 @EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis If the 1A was repealed, would you abide by speech laws passed by Trump and the GOP?		Doubtful...nor would I. 		Free speech is an inherent right. I don't care what laws you pass, I will not abide by them.
@j_razor101 @EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis Here's the problem, the 2A doesn't grant rights. The 1A doesn't grant rights. The rights are inherent. 		The 1A and 2A restrict Govt: "Congress shall make no law", "Shall not be infringed"		Repealing them doesn't take away the INHERENT RIGHT which I will continue to assert.
@j_razor101 @EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis My response would be, "What guns?"		See that's the problem, people would just deny they have them.		So then we'll have to repeal the 4A also so Govt can search their homes...
@EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis And you're correct that the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992.		It was submitted in 1789.		So you better get on that 2A repeal quick, it could take a while...
@EliMuso @bmxafriq74 @Marina_Sirtis True, you just need to:	1. Convince 290 Representatives (2/3) to amend it	2. Convince 67 Senators (2/3) to amend it	3. Convince 38 States (3/4) to amend it	4. And once you do that, you then have to disarm 100M+ gun owners. You're gonna need a lot of guns to do that.		Good luck!

@saneman3000 Wrong. We have absolute free speech. Then others trample on that freedom...using violence and Govt (the threat of violence).
@saneman3000 Good point. But who decides which types of speech can incite violence?		Politicians, right? So the GOP-controlled Congress can pass a bill declaring which types of speech should be outlawed and President Trump can sign it into law.		Agreed?

"Sure, there's no evidence in the unredacted info that Carter Page was really a Russian agent, but I'm sure it's in the redacted stuff. Of course, there's no way I could possibly know that, but I'll assert it anyway because...well, I'm losing the argument"	- Bradley P. Moss https://t.co/OoCqCnLoiQ

You are just flat wrong.		How do I know this?		Because Carter Page has never been charged or arrested for anything.		You're talking out of both sides of your mouth. You can't say "We have the evidence on Page!" and then not charge him. https://t.co/ThOtiLDdem
And this is not a case of "They do that all the time!". No they do not. One political party does not use the full weight of the Govt to surreptitiously spy on members of another political party. Not without some accountability...

@Amaster101 When you determine what needs to be done, just make sure YOU do it first and lead by example.		That's all I ask. If you talk the talk, walk the walk.		Otherwise, don't lecture people about changing their own lives if you refuse to do so yourself.
@Amaster101 I agree. And when you look at that data, it shows that it's been hotter/colder before and co2 levels higher/lower than now many times over...LONG before humans even existed.		And that's why climate alarmists only show data going back to the 1850's.
@Amaster101 There's nothing unprecedented happening now that hasn't happened before. And climate alarmists know this. That's why their graphs only show data back to the 1850's. Because if they had to show data going back thousands of years, there would be nothing alarming about today.
@Amaster101 Climate alarmists: "It's the hottest year on record! This isn't normal!"		That record only goes back 150 years.		What's 'normal'? North America was once covered by a glacier for 10k years. Surely THAT is more normal than the last few hundred years.
@Amaster101 What science?		The 'science' that looked at just the last 150 years out of Earth's entire 4.5 billion year history and called that a "disturbing trend"?		Making conclusions from a .000003% statistical dataset isn't science, it's charlatanism.

@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus I don't believe I'm killing the planet...so I'm not the hypocrite.		Yes, climate change is happening. It's always happened. It's been hotter/colder than now and co2 levels higher/lower than now many times over billions of years.
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus If someone is really serious about it and walks the walk, I'll listen to them.		But if it's a climate scientist who flies around the world attending meeting after meeting while staying in luxurious hotels to discuss how my 5 mile work commute is killing the planet...I won't.
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus All of humanity is at stake!		Ok, I'm using hyperbole of course, I don't seriously expect everyone to do that, it's not feasible or practical.		My larger point is the hypocrisy of people preaching climate armageddon is coming...and not changing a single thing in their own lives.
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus If he does, great. 		But I've been repeatedly told by Climate alarmists: "Just me changing my actions won't help, everyone needs to."		ME: "Surely you should lead by example, right?"		Climate alarmists: "BLOCKED!"
RT @AriFleischer: Strzok: “I do not think that bias was expressed in those text messages.” Wow. Just wow. If Strzok’s messages weren’t bias…
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus You can't move to some open space and live a self-sustaining life? 		Humanity and the fate of the planet is at stake! (right?)		YOU: "Sure climate armegeddon is coming but...I really like my nice suburban home or apartment in the city. It's just so convenient."
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus He literally says humanity needs to radically change how we do things in society to prevent this global climate catastrophe.		Yet he personally refuses to do anything himself.		He's a hypocrite. And that's why nobody takes doomsday climate cultists seriously.
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus "he's not able to" &lt;= Wrong. He simply refuses to. People do it all over the world. It's just too much work for him.		Again, if he truly believes the fate of humanity is at stake, surely he would do everything he can to eliminate CO2-pollution from his own life.		Yet he doesn't.
@Amaster101 @EricHolthaus Why are you lecturing me? I'm not the one saying the fate of the planet is at stake, Eric is.		If he believes that, he would immediately change his own actions. Yet he doesn't.		YOU: "But he can't buy food if he does that!"		He should grow his own food, Earth is at risk...right?
It's Collusion or Nothing.		Anything else is just a political sideshow that will be mocked and dismissed. Obstruction? Of an investigation that went on for 2 more years and still found no collusion? The American people will never buy that.		Sorry, Leftists...Trump wins.
Nobody believes that.		Not even the most hard-core Leftist believes that. Sure they'll lie and say they do, but they don't.		This entire thing has now been successfully politicized. So unless Mueller can prove collusion happened (it didn't), Trump wins. https://t.co/ymNs4xA6Zr

Hillary simply paid a foreign agent to work with Russians to compile a discredited dossier which was then given to Obama's DOJ to secure a bogus warrant so the FBI could send a spy to infiltrate Trump's campaign.

Stefan Halper wasn't a spy!		He was just sent by @BarackObama's FBI on a secret clandestine mission to monitor Trump's campaign and then report his intel back to @Comey so they could plan their next moves.		C'mon...that's not even close to spying.		#SPYGATE https://t.co/KxOctTa1xl

@chrispanza @ColinTMitchell @Rebecca_Throck2 You said: "'ritual patriotism' is not a part of the game of football"		True, it's not part of the game of football, but it is part of the BUSINESS of NFL football.		And this is about a company and its employees that are affecting its profits.
@chrispanza @ColinTMitchell @Rebecca_Throck2 The NFL is a business. And like any business, if a company's employees are doing things on company time that hurt their profits, the company will tell those employees to stop or be fired. 		Everything an NFL player does when he walks into that stadium IS part of his job.
@chrispanza @ColinTMitchell @Rebecca_Throck2 Nobody is being 'compelled'. They can still take a knee, just not on the company's time and on the company's dime.		It's no different than if you were to march around your employer's offices yelling and protesting about a cause and your employer said knock it off or you're fired.
@chrispanza @ColinTMitchell @Rebecca_Throck2 You might have a point if not for the fact that NFL players aren't being forced to stand for the anthem.		YOU: "But they want to kneel!"

@fennelseedlings Trump can say his favorite color is blue, then tomorrow he can say it's always been red, then the next day he can say it's always been purple.		It doesn't matter, it still means exactly JACK FUCKIN SQUAT.		psst, President's can change their mind, they can lie. It ain't illegal.
@fennelseedlings No you miss the point...		Trump can say he never wanted to fire Mueller, then say he always wanted to tomorrow, then say he actually never wanted to the next day and so on and so on...it doesn't matter, it still means exactly JACK FUCKIN SQUAT.
If anyone thinks Mueller is gonna come up with some bogus "obstruction" charge of an investigation that found NOTHING related to the election and Americans will accept it, they are sorely mistaken.		If Mueller doesn't prove collusion (he won't), Trump and the GOP will bury him.
This goes one of two ways:		1) Mueller proves Trump colluded with Russia. Everyone know this isn't happening, because anyone with an IQ above 12 knows it didn't happen.		OR		2) Mueller admits there was no collusion. Then Trump mocks this whole saga as FAKE NEWS for years to come. https://t.co/zsxaLPVCyJ

1) Being here ILLEGALLY is a crime. So by definition, they all commit crimes.	2) I've worked in restaurants with illegals (very hard working, friendly people). They were paid in cash. Didn't pay taxes. Sent much of that $ back home and didn't spend it in the US. https://t.co/QuOCSEK8Ch

@lunchbreakkyok @soledadobrien Nobody has a "right" to protest at their job while on company time. Which part of that confuses you?
@mbrooksmd1 @soledadobrien And you don't understand that you don't have a "right" to protest at your job on company time.
Soledad also thinks you have a right to go into your job and just start protesting while on company time...amazing. https://t.co/wTyigW9Lmb
@soledadobrien Babe it doesn't work that way. Here in America, there is NO right to protest at your job while on company time and being paid for it.

@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet "Separate But Equal"...sounds sexist. #YourLogic
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior The male patriarchy setup a system which precludes women...sounds sexist.		#YourLogic
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet People don't have a choice not to commit crimes and not to confront cops while armed?
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior I'd respect these millionaire athletes more if they refuse to play.		Ali made a sacrifice when he protested.		These guys aren't.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior And a millionaire athlete kneeling for a few secs, playing a game and then going back to his mansion...ain't much of a protest.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior I've never said people can't protest, I simply question the manner in which they do it..."Cops Are Pigs!", burning the flag, etc.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior 100% of NFL players and 100% of NBA players are male yet Women make up 51% of the population.		Are those organizations sexist?
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet Just give a Yes or No...don't dance around it. It's your logic, defend it.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior Again, using that "logic" the NBA is racist because whites are underrepresented and NHL racist because blacks are underrepresented.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior You consider it "disproportionate" and "racial bias" if something does not reflect the same %'s as the general population?
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet Let's explore your "logic"...		More than 73% of people arrested are Male yet men only make up 49% of the population.		Are the Cops sexist?
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet The side that prefers to remain uninformed and that's against common sense.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior Agreed.		And as the facts I've given you show, it's NOT the epidemic the Left makes it out to be. 		Concede that fact...
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet I know math is hard for you guys but...2X as many whites (48%) than blacks (24%) are killed by cops every year. https://t.co/cCQ8eAXTWj
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior Now you're back to %'s make it racist??		Make up your mind...

@KurtVelvet A multi-millionaire athlete wore "Cops Are Pigs" socks, kneeled for 10 secs, played a GAME, then went back to his mansion.		That's bold...
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet You're both ignorant and uninformed.		In 2016, of the 963 people killed by police, 690 (71%) had a gun or knife.		https://t.co/OulKwgITzH
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior So it's not always racism??		@SouloJunior disagrees with you.
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet @KikiHavens @dangainor @rpm_thetown @Langdogg @DeSmithNFLPA @NFL It's amusing how you think a Black cop killing an armed black suspect is racism.
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet Thanks, I appreciate your honesty.	What if it's a white man being killed, is it still police brutality?	What if the suspect has a gun?
@KurtVelvet Help me out here...when Kaepernick wore these "Cops Are Pigs" socks, what was he protesting? https://t.co/KcfZvcsCYv
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet Which is racist?	Black cop kills black man.	Hispanic cop kills black man.	Asian cop kills black man.	White cop kills black man.
@KurtVelvet @SouloJunior So its not the % that makes it racist and there are black cops who've also killed black people...looks like you've run out of arguments.
@KurtVelvet wait...are you saying there are times when cops killing a black suspect is justified!?		I've got you defending cops now. This is too easy...
@SouloJunior @KurtVelvet @KikiHavens @dangainor @rpm_thetown @Langdogg @DeSmithNFLPA @NFL Using your "logic", NHL is racist because blacks are underrepresented and NBA is racist because whites are underrepresented.		Brilliant!

@KurtVelvet yes, yes...and white people are all racist.		I get it, you ignorant, uninformed bigot.
@KurtVelvet So even if a black cop kills a black person, it's still racism?		Brilliant!		When everything is racist, nothing is racist.
@KurtVelvet You do know there are Black, Hispanic, Asian cops too...right??		It's not just white cops who've killed people, you fuckin moron
@KurtVelvet @KikiHavens @dangainor @rpm_thetown @Langdogg @DeSmithNFLPA @NFL It's amusing...you actually think the Cops killing black people are all White, and so they're racist. How do people get as stupid as you?

@TrumpCucks FACT: If the FBI/Mueller can't prove Manafort was working as an "agent of a foreign power", then the FISA warrant was illegal.
@TrumpCucks "They had a warrant issue so it was no unlawful."		Yes, that IS literally what you said. Run along, moron. You just got owned.
@TrumpCucks shady business dealings in Ukraine is NOT an "agent of a foreign power"
@TrumpCucks YOU: "It can't be illegal if a Judge does it!"	YOU: "It can't be illegal if the FBI does it!"		What an idiot you are. Just amazing.
@TrumpCucks But you don't agree.	You believe it's perfectly ok to use FISA on Americans to achieve your political goals.	You're pathetic.
@TrumpCucks Mass surveillance of Americans is wrong.	Using FISA to wiretap Americans is wrong.	I don't care your political party...it's wrong.
@TrumpCucks If Manafort had shady dealings in Ukraine but was not acting as an "agent of a foreign govt"...the FISA warrant is still illegal.
@TrumpCucks btw, just to be clear...shady business dealings is NOT "an agent of a foreign govt". You understand that difference, right?
@TrumpCucks No, moron, I didn't admit Manafort committed any crime.		But Mueller better have something or he's in a world of shit.
@TrumpCucks I "cherry picked" the part of the FISA statute that spells out what happens if it's used ILLEGALLY?		What a fuckin moron you are.
@TrumpCucks "the statute creates a cause of action for private individuals whose communications were UNLAWFULLY monitored" &lt;= did you read that part?
@TrumpCucks Do you? Here, read up. I highlighted the relevant portion again for you =&gt; https://t.co/Oz7XRNortO
@TrumpCucks It's gonna be funny when Mueller's entire investigation only produces shady Manafort business dealings...in Ukraine. ;)
@TrumpCucks LOL...I don't give a fuck about Manafort. He's not in the Trump Admin.		I care about illegal use of FISA. So should you.
@TrumpCucks Either they indict Manafort or the FBI is in a world of shit for wiretapping Americans under FISA with nothing.
@TrumpCucks Judges and the FBI can act illegally.		Why is that concept hard for your tiny brain to grasp?
@TrumpCucks YOU: "Doh! You got me. I'm wrong."		admit it.
@TrumpCucks YOU: "Doesn't matter if they have ZERO evidence on Manafort and the judge was a Democrat, the FISA warrant is still legal!"&lt;= #facepalm
@TrumpCucks Can a judge issue an illegal ruling, Yes or No?		Answer the question, moron...
@TrumpCucks I have a simple question: Can a judge make an illegal ruling?		It's a simple Yes or No?
@TrumpCucks "The judge ruled, so it can't be illegal!"		What a fuckin moron you are.
@TrumpCucks That's like claiming a Judge can't act against the law, because he's a judge. #facepalm
@TrumpCucks You understand that right? The FBI can't get a FISA warrant to simply snoop on Americans. If there's no indictment...FBI is in trouble.
@TrumpCucks Must be working as an agent of a foreign power. So either FBI brings an indictment or they're in a world of shit for an illegal wiretap.
@TrumpCucks Read up, I highlighted the relevant section =&gt; https://t.co/vwEa3aoCox

@SaucedbySally Yes, I know you hate freedom. You don't need to repeat yourself.
@SaucedbySally Do you believe in the concept of natural rights? Or do you believe all rights are granted by Govt?
@SaucedbySally No, because you think some people don't deserve freedom.
RT @MattWalshBlog: If you equate the group on the left with the group on the right, you are a liar and a disgrace. https://t.co/5Cx2jakNNb
@SaucedbySally I recall a discussion I had with a Chinese national who told me the Chinese people couldn't cope with true freedom. You sound like him...
@SaucedbySally I've lived and traveled in many countries. The US has the most freedom and is the best. No coincidence we're also the lone super power.
@SaucedbySally You jumped into that convo demanding people's speech be silenced by Govt force.
@SaucedbySally How did you cope with people being able to freely express themselves without Govt forcing their silence with a gun?
@SaucedbySally I'm free to say whatever I want.	North Koreans aren't.	You Canadians aren't.	Yes...I'd say I'm freer.
@SaucedbySally Well let's see...you advocated for criminal prosecution of speech UNTIL I showed you that specific video, then you backtracked.
@SaucedbySally Sally, trust me, brainwashed people in North Korea believe they're "free" just as you do.
@SaucedbySally Oppressive speech laws will never happen in the US. We respect freedom too much. And we cast off the UK monarchy long ago.
@SaucedbySally take care...good luck with finding some consistency and a moral compass.
@SaucedbySally "targeted group" &lt;= so transparent and obvious...and so pathetic.
@SaucedbySally dance more...you amuse me.
@SaucedbySally you're so transparent and obvious...it's comical.
@SaucedbySally Sally, just say "You can't be racist against white people". You know you want to. Why the charade? Own your beliefs, stop dancing around.
@SaucedbySally Nope, never been to Canada. I've been to the UK where your Queen lives though. You know her, right? The Queen who still rules your country.
@SaucedbySally I guarantee if I had posted a vid of a neo-nazi calling for black genocide, you would unequivocally say he should be arrested. Admit it...
@SaucedbySally Thankfully he lives in a freer country where he can openly speak his mind and isn't subject to oppressive Canadian law.
@SaucedbySally You don't?? Just a few tweets ago you advocated the US adopt the same 'hate speech' laws codified in the Criminal Code of Canada
@SaucedbySally You think 'hate speech' only occurs on the far right and when the same is said by someone on the left, it's not 'hate speech'...admit it.
@SaucedbySally You're backtracking. He's calling for the genocide of an entire race, yet now you won't commit to wanting him arrested? We both know why...
@Clancy_1 @ombudsman4truth @nihilistcomhour guys, please remove me from this convo, thanks.
@SaucedbySally @TFinn82 @TheRickWilson Would you advocate arresting him for his speech? I wouldn't. I want him to speak. You would shut him up? Not me.
@SaucedbySally @TFinn82 @TheRickWilson He as given a national CSPAN platform. Leftists in the audience applauded! Is this "hate speech"? =&gt; https://t.co/Pq2x9996CG
@SaucedbySally @TFinn82 @TheRickWilson @charlescwcooke I agree with Sally. Pres Trump and the GOP-led Congress should decide which speech to ban.

@egavactip "There is no such thing as the Alt-Right". Agree or disagree?
@egavactip KKK is a thing. "Alt right" not a thing. Since coined, it has been used to refer to Trump supporters, FOX News, Breitbart and lots else.
@egavactip Let's explore your "logic". Who's the "Alt right"?. Let's see how many different groups you name...
@egavactip Mark, to go Google, type "Antifa", view images and videos. Then tell me those are just random groups of people.
@egavactip Sure, random groups all wearing the same outfit, carrying the same signs, chanting the same slogans....you're a special kind of stupid

@VinceValence @ScottB_503 @Mr_JamesLandis @KT_So_It_Goes wait, sorry, did you want to come visit me? I'll give you my address if you really promise to show up. No cops. Deal?
@rhysam You get that, right?		"Russia swayed the election for Trump"	AND	"Hillary won the popular vote"		Are mutually exclusive. Both can't be true
@ScottB_503 @VinceValence @Mr_JamesLandis @KT_So_It_Goes Now yell, "Elvis is still alive and he was the 2nd shooter on the grassy knoll!"
@rhysam But no, it doesn't really concern me that Russia meddled. Hillary won the popular vote, thus proving they swayed no votes.
@rhysam They didn't say there was collusion, they said Russia meddled. As they and MANY other countries always try to do.
@rhysam btw, it would be justified outrage...but for some reason the Left has a love affair with Communism that is simply given a pass
@rhysam I can only imagine the outrage if Trump campaign HQ had Nazi flags and Trump had Nazi propaganda posters in his home.

@nihilistcomhour @ombudsman4truth You defended slave owners. I appreciate you being honest and open about it.

@nihilistcomhour @kurteichenwald @ombudsman4truth btw, a quick history lesson for you: Slavery was part of the Constitution that George Washington fought FOR.
@nihilistcomhour @kurteichenwald @ombudsman4truth So you're fine with statues honoring people who owned slaves? Just say YES...I know you're struggling with it, but just own it.

@mythousandfaces Nope. Wrong. You can still read a person's tweets who blocked you by:	1) Searching for them	2) Logging out	3) Running in incognito mode
@mythousandfaces The legal challenge is that Trump, as President, can't block people from being able to read his tweets. Blocking doesn't stop them.
@mythousandfaces It only stops that person from seeing your tweets in their TL. Wait, you don't it's illegal for Trump not to read your tweets...do you?

@apokerplayer My point being, why would someone try to provoke a war they can't win? I know, these are clearly not rational people.
@apokerplayer We seem to get along with Japan just fine now. The entire world said: "Shit! We don't wanna mess with the US, let's be friends".
@apokerplayer Only one side is holding back here. We could literally nuke the entire Middle East in a day if we wanted. Let's hope it never comes to that
@apokerplayer Anyway, we'll see how my theory plays out...sadly for Europe, I expect many more terrorist attacks overseas as they soft-pedal their problem
@apokerplayer Bin Laden didn't want to die. That's why he hid for so many years letting other people die for him.
@apokerplayer People said Bin Laden wanted to provoke the West too. He's now dead and we have military all over the Middle East. He miscalculated.
@apokerplayer I think terrorists see Trump and think: "Damn, he's so unpredictable, he may actually nuke us...we'll stick to terrorizing Europe"
@apokerplayer If mere words can turn someone to violence, they're not rational people.
@apokerplayer I disagree politically, but don't think they're terrorists. Don't think she's Hitler.
@apokerplayer His rhetoric will push calm, rational people into going full jihad?		sure...I can see that. It's making the Left lose its collective mind
@apokerplayer Leftist's yelling "Trump is worse than Al-qaeda and his supporters are all Nazis!" bullshit is what made me, a Libertarian, reject the Left.
@apokerplayer you said they didn't know what they were doing...didn't know any better.
@apokerplayer ah right..."his followers are stupid, that's why they voted for someone worse than Al-Qaeda."		brilliant.
@apokerplayer We may disagree politically and I may even think you're a bit unhinged...but I'd never accuse you of being worse than actual terrorists.
@apokerplayer Imaginary? Ok you got me, you sure are smart, Zach...nothing gets by you.
@apokerplayer Agreed. I truly do cherish freedom of speech. See, I knew we could find common ground...even though I'm "worse than Al-Qaeda"
@apokerplayer ain't that just the damnedest of coincidences though!	I tell ya...world has gone crazy...nothing surprises me anymore

@pmejia09 "Flynn told Rice to hold off" &lt;= that was a recommendation. Not a decision. Not an order. A recommendation. Why does that still confuse you?
@pmejia09 Wait, you don't actually think Flynn was giving an order...do you? #facepalm
@pmejia09 Again, I'm waiting for you to say Obama...the President at the time...had no choice in the matter. So I can laugh and laugh.
@pmejia09 "Flynn told Rice to hold off" &lt;= that is a recommendation to Obama's National Security Adviser. Obama made the decision. He was President.
@pmejia09 He sure as fuck didn't make a decision because he wasn't the President, Obama was. "Flynn told Rice to hold off" = "recommendation"
@pmejia09 Flynn made a recommendation. You nailed that one. Now, who did he make a recommendation to? You're so close...I know you know it!
@pmejia09 It's a simple question: who was President? You can do it, I have faith in you. Don't give up so easily. You know this, c'mon!
@pmejia09 Yea...you're still not getting it. Ok, Flynn made a recommendation. You got that part right. To who? Who was President?
@pmejia09 I see you're still not quite grasping this. Hmm, ok let me walk you thru this:	Who was President Of The United States at the time?
@pmejia09 Obama was the President at the time. It was his decision. &lt;= if you need more help in understanding how that works, just let me know.
@pmejia09 You do understand that the President makes those decisions, right? You understand how being Commander in Chief works?
@greyballesq Just to clarify, you think he's now a traitor or that he just made some stupid decisions? I say the latter.
@pmejia09 Obama was the President. It was his decision. Flynn simply made a recommendation. These are the facts. Sorry if they still confuse you
@greyballesq Obama: "Don't hire Flynn"	Trump: "Why? Didn't you hire him in 2012?"	Obama: "I was an idiot...trust me."
@pmejia09 It doesn't matter what Flynn recommended. The ultimate decision at the time was STILL Rice and Obama's. Why does that confuse you?
@greyballesq Just to clarify, me pointing out the fact that Obama hired Flynn in 2012 is...trickery?
@pmejia09 Read the story again. Obama and Rice decided to delay it.
@greyballesq It was on Flynn's resume. ;) 		Seriously, I find it hilarious Obama hired him first. #ouch That's gotta suck for your narrative.

@sheeraf your story today wasn't about Kaspersky, it was about Flynn and your implication is clear.
@sheeraf  if I find that Kaspersky advertises on BuzzFeed, it may blow the roof off this entire story...
@sheeraf something "nefarious" is definitely going on...they cite you on their own website. https://t.co/p5MlBJfLhz
@sheeraf you implied it and you know it. @BuzzFeedNews
Just how nefarious is Kaspersky? They partner with Adobe, Dell and are used by millions of Americans. That nefarious! @sheeraf @BuzzFeedNews

@hi_imzoe can you point me to your tweet which addresses this specific issue?
@hi_imzoe you do realize barring a person from entering the country does NOT prevent them from speaking...yes??
@hi_imzoe "Unelected judges are the ultimate authority on national security" &lt;= yes, I understand your position.
@hi_imzoe isn't it strange how so many Muslim-majority countries aren't even on the list. Now that's some effective Muslim ban!
@hi_imzoe you don't understand your own words, do you?
@hi_imzoe help me out here...barring someone from standing in the US Capitol and yelling loudly is an abridgment of their free speech?
@hi_imzoe that's exactly what you just said. Judges need to be presented with nat sec evidence to decide =&gt; https://t.co/MvgNUbcSOJ
@hi_imzoe barring a foreigner who openly despises the U.S. from entering the country is trampling on their free speech? Amazing...
@hi_imzoe so these judges, who you say are the ultimate authority on nat sec, need to see classified intel to make decisions? Interesting...
@hi_imzoe @charlescwcooke and would the judge, who you say is ultimate authority on nat sec, need to see detailed military plans to decide?
@hi_imzoe @charlescwcooke Can Pres be barred from military action in a country if States claim it would affect enrollment in state schools?
@hi_imzoe unelected judges have ultimate authority to decide what's in the national security interest of the U.S...not the President?
@ajrichar non-Americans in foreign countries have no standing in U.S. courts...no matter what some Leftist judge may think.
@hi_imzoe the President is barred from protecting U.S. national security because a state college might see a drop in enrollments. #facepalm
@ajrichar @SeahawkBurrrton what's amusing is...you Leftists actually believe non-Americans in foreign countries have standing in U.S. courts
@ajrichar @SeahawkBurrrton don't blame me for your reading comprehension issues and your ignorance.
@ajrichar @SeahawkBurrrton are you thick? I just said that. Your argument is: "It's only disallowed if Trump does it".
@ajrichar you said it would be perfectly legal for Pres Hillary to sign the same EO, but illegal for Trump. @SeahawkBurrrton
@ajrichar Hilarious. This is why I, a socially moderate Libertarian, can't vote Democrat. The clueless stupidity it takes is simply amazing
@SeahawkBurrrton @ajrichar his argument isn't even "It's disallowed", his argument is, "It's only disallowed if Trump does it".
@ajrichar so the "loophole" around your claim of illegality is for Congress to pass a bill making the SAME EO as law and Trump can sign it?
@ajrichar @SeahawkBurrrton "It's not about the text of the law/EO, it's about what Trump said last year on the campaign trail!" &lt;= Amazing
@hi_imzoe just to clarify, you believe non-Americans who openly despise the US have standing in US courts to be let in?
@ajrichar Congress makes their intent clear: "We'll make Trump's EO the law of the land". Requires Trump's signature. Can it be challenged?
@ajrichar it's the same EO text...word for word. Congress makes no changes. Requires Trump's signature to become law. Can it be challenged?
@hi_imzoe that's not terroristic speech. Try again...
@ajrichar hypothetical: Congress passes a law, same text as Trump's EO. Trump signs it. Can it be challenged on the same grounds?

@ajrichar  no worries. When SCOTUS ultimately rules in Trump's favor on this...I'll get back to you.
@ajrichar you are wrong. This Leftist judge is wrong. Even legal scholars who dislike Trump and the EO still believe it's perfectly legal.
@ajrichar doesn't matter if you think the EO is good or bad, it's still perfectly legal. Here...read =&gt; https://t.co/7ya5WzwzWf
@ajrichar your side is simply wrong on this. Acting out of emotion instead of common sense/logic. SCOTUS will ultimately rule for Trump
@ajrichar there's no difference. Both actions are an exercise of his Presidential powers to defend this country
@ajrichar it would be legal for a Pres Hillary, but illegal for Pres Trump &lt;= absolutely fucking amazing that you actually believe that. Wow
@ajrichar amazing...you're so blinded by Trump hate that you're clueless as to the precedent this judge is trying to set.
@ajrichar hypothetical: if Trump orders the bombing of a Muslim-majority country, can a judge halt that bombing?
@ajrichar by the text of the law, not some Leftist judge's interpretation of intent.
@ajrichar amazing...you ignorantly believe the legality of laws and EOs depends on the person passing them and not the text itself.

@revmagdalen I know this time is still very difficult for you, but you have to accept reality. Trump IS your President.
@revmagdalen "leaks violate statutes" &lt;= you cheer on illegal acts because you're so unhinged that Hillary lost. Pathetic...
@revmagdalen true, the fact is Trump has done nothing illegal. The leakers are acting illegally. And you're applauding them for it.
@revmagdalen the leakers swore an oath to the Constitution. They're violating that oath by acting illegally. And you're cheering them on.
@revmagdalen so again, you cheer on ILLEGAL acts and spying on someone who's done nothing wrong. That's unAmerican.
@revmagdalen now you finally concede it's illegal...about time.
@revmagdalen "We don't charge for such things" &lt;= is you conceding that's it's still illegal, just not charged. You are wrong. I am right.
@revmagdalen in your example, the act is still illegal. Just because someone isn't charged with that, doesn't make it any less illegal.
@revmagdalen there is no "compelling public interest" exception to allow for classified into to be leaked to the media.
@revmagdalen That's not how it works. You're so wrong it's amazing.  Doesn't matter what the info is...leaking it is illegal. Period.
@revmagdalen bullshit. You are wrong. Completely wrong. Wrong in every way imaginable. It's the reason Manning went to jail.
@revmagdalen you are so far removed from reality it's amazing. Leakers don't have authority to decide which NatSec info they can release
@revmagdalen the law doesn't make distinctions between telling NatSec info to a NYT reporter and telling someone on the street. It's illegal
@revmagdalen you are cheering on ILLEGAL leaks and spying against someone who's committed no crimes. You are unAmerican.
@revmagdalen no. You are wrong. There are no exceptions when leaking to the media. It's illegal.
@revmagdalen  I promise you, 9/11 Truthers are as supremely confident in their own delusions as you are in yours.
@revmagdalen "whistleblowing" != illegally leaking to media because you're still upset your candidate lost the election.
@revmagdalen wrong. It's illegal. Period. There aren't exceptions when leaking to the media.
@revmagdalen "There's evidence Cheney orchestrated 9/11 to benefit Haliburton and steal Iraq's oil!"
@revmagdalen "There's evidence Trump acted illegally!" = "There's evidence a missile hit the Pentagon!" #insanity

@revmagdalen ...and Bush planted bombs in the WTC so he could invade Iraq to steal the oil. I've heard all the insane delusions before.
@revmagdalen ...and the 9/11 hijackers are still alive and the planes weren't real, they were holograms. I've heard the insanity all before
@revmagdalen there's no official conclusion...well except that there have been ZERO links found between Trump and Russia.
@revmagdalen will Trump go to prison before or after another 9/11 investigation prosecutes Bush and Cheney? https://t.co/EHtuPWznWd
@revmagdalen you saying this should go to court is like 9/11 truthers demanding another investigation. Insanity. Ain't happening.
@revmagdalen you cheering on ILLEGAL leaks is like cheering on a murderer because you dislike the people he's killing.
@revmagdalen that there is ZERO evidence Trump did anything illegal yet we know for a fact Leakers acting ILLEGALLY and you cheer them on
@revmagdalen I know, I know...and Bush/Cheney perpetrated 9/11 to benefit Haliburton. You sound just like a 9/11 truther...
@revmagdalen ZERO proof Trump acted illegally. A known fact the leakers are acting ILLEGALLY. And you cheer them on. Pathetic...
@revmagdalen There is only one side we know for a fact is acting illegally: The Leakers. You applaud it for purely biased political reasons.
@revmagdalen hilarious. Let me say it again: there is ZERO proof Trump acted illegally. Meanwhile, you cheer on ILLEGAL leaks.
@revmagdalen what does that have to do with Trump? The election wasn't hacked. It was free and fair. Trump won.
@revmagdalen what for? Lemme guess...Trump, who's already a billionaire, wants even more money?? #facepalm
@revmagdalen and 9/11 truthers are just as adamant in their unproven conspiracy beliefs as you are.
@revmagdalen "Jet fuel can't melt steel!"  = "Trump is a Russian agent!"...that's what you sound like.
@revmagdalen do you realize you sound just like deranged 9/11 truthers? You really do.
@revmagdalen there's no delicate way to put this and I say it with all sincerity and concern...you are unhinged.

@revmagdalen crazy talk...that would have led to Civil War. Trust me, Leftists don't want to go to war against the side with all the guns.
@revmagdalen no wrongdoing was found. There is no treason. No illegality. Well, except for Obama holdovers ILLEGALLY leaking.
@revmagdalen after the election
RT @RichardGrenell: Obama used the IRS against Republicans, why wouldn't he use other US government agencies against Trump?
@revmagdalen no, what happened was that Obama didn't think Trump would be President and would ever see the FISA warrants. Big mistake...

@MrHollices sorry, you don't get to define what is and isn't Fake News. Reporting lies without fact checking = Fake News.
@MrHollices sure, like reporting what a fake twitter account is tweeting and not fact checking to see if it's real first. https://t.co/AUz8dQjvTI
@MrHollices true, can you believe there are actually morons who think it's fine for journos to report lies and not fact check? Amazing...
@MrHollices how do you know if the sources are made up? Sources are anonymous. So just trust the media? They lost that trust.
@MrHollices I'm just amazed at your cluelessness. Again, the media is losing this argument. https://t.co/VdFjtnXM1x
@MrHollices "sources say [lies]" and no fact check needed. Don't even need to name sources. And that's...journalism?
@MrHollices using that logic, every journalist can just use "sources say" and then make up lies to push an agenda.
@MrHollices "It's not Fake News if someone else makes it up and we don't fact check because we want to push our leftist agenda" #facepalm
@MrHollices but reporting lies without fact checking to push an agenda is not Fake News...got it. #facepalm
@MrHollices and the media wonders why it's so out of touch and polls worse than Trump.
@MrHollices "It's not Fake News if we report lies and don't fact check" &lt;= you're still going with that...amazing.
@MrHollices "difference here is the source lied, nobody fact checked, they just reported his lies...so it's not Fake News" &lt;= hilarious
@MrHollices who defines what is and isn't Fake News?
@MrHollices using your example and logic...	Media: "Pope endorses Trump"	Media: "Correction, he does not"	Fake news or not fake news?
@MrHollices you fact check before you report, otherwise it's not journalism. There's a name for reporting lies...FAKE NEWS.
@MrHollices would you label this as fake news, blatant bias or just an honest mistake? https://t.co/fhrl1FjEOF
@MrHollices "Report lies. Don't do fact checking. Maybe follow up and correct later if they have the time" &lt;= you're going with that?
@MrHollices reporters jobs are to fact check. Which part of that confuses you?
@MrHollices "It's not Fake News if a complete lie is reported with zero fact checking" &lt;= you're going with that?
@MrHollices "sure the story is a complete fabrication and journos didn't fact check it, but that's not fake news" &lt;= you're going with that?

@umbrellaman92 the judicial branch does NOT get to decide what's in the US national security interest. I don't care how much they hate Trump
@umbrellaman92 Trump can wait it out, time is on his side. Meanwhile, the next terror attack is coming.
@umbrellaman92 the Executive branch makes National Security decisions, not the Judicial branch. It's in that pesky Constitution.
@umbrellaman92 Judge to Trump: "You deployed an aircraft carrier to the Indian Ocean. Why? 5,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Why?" Bullshit
@umbrellaman92 Gorsuch.
@umbrellaman92 foreigners living in another country have no right to enter the US, no standing, and no Constitutional rights. Sorry.
@umbrellaman92 if those 7 countries are no threat, then why did the Obama Admin designate them as a threat? Trump will win this in the end.
@umbrellaman92 nope. The 7 countries were identified by the Obama Admin, not Trump. Many Muslim-majority countries not even on the list.

@Shannon66672192 ok. I'm done. I'm not gonna get into insane crazy conspiracy theories perpetuated by unhinged losers. thnx for the convo
@Shannon66672192 he won = Milo won. And the vast majority of the country didn't vote for Hillary either...only 20% did.
@Shannon66672192 the game is: Who can spin the worst acts by the other side to their political advantage? This round goes to the Right.
@Shannon66672192 Yes Olbermann and Moore. And Reich said the violence was done by hired right-wingers...he's batshit crazy.
@Shannon66672192 yep, I'm not even a fan of his really. He's a provocateur and the Left fell into his trap. He won this one.
@Shannon66672192 the press has a worse approval rating than Trump.
@Shannon66672192 the press are liars. They are biased. And they should be free to speak so Americans can see it. And we see it.
@Shannon66672192 but the louder voices on your side say violence is acceptable simply to silence people...and they speak for you now.
@Shannon66672192 btw, you Leftists did a real good job silencing Milo. He got an audience of millions. Bravo! =&gt; https://t.co/JmYhTG2ivJ
@Shannon66672192 if people keep saying things you don't like?
@Shannon66672192 sure, you're welcome to declare yourself in rebellion. I say go for it. Don't be a coward.
@Shannon66672192 so if you want to get violent...just keep it contained to Leftist cities like Berkeley which give you a safe space to do it
@Shannon66672192 I'm telling you that if your side's preferred method is violence, the other side will respond in kind.
@Shannon66672192 because they are Leftist. https://t.co/odPayYxDrq
@Shannon66672192 Combat people's words and ideas with counter words and ideas. Because in a fight with force, the Left will lose.
@Shannon66672192 if you think violence will achieve results, go for it. But the right is heavily armed and most Cops/Military lean right.
@Shannon66672192 why bring up hypotheticals? Talk about what happened. A guy wanted to speak and Leftists responded with violence.
@Alifaruq @DylanByers 	And the Super Bowl loser had more yards! 	And the World Series loser had more hits! 	#facepalm
@Shannon66672192 solution to what problem? A guy wanted to simply SPEAK. Your side used violence to prevent it.
@Shannon66672192 if you think violence is required to silence those you disagree with, fine. But you will be hit back harder.
@Shannon66672192 you're bringing up things that haven't and will not happen. Your side wants to use violence...simply to stop ppl speaking
@Shannon66672192 I'm Libertarian. Socially liberal. People on the right can be persuaded to my views easier than people on the left.
@Shannon66672192 true, but you lean towards Govt dictating for others and I lean towards individuals deciding for themselves.
@Shannon66672192 yes. I'm not an Absolutist or Anarchist. We've agreed that Govt can also limit (infringe on) free speech too...to an extent
@Shannon66672192 the pharmacist quits. Can he be forced back into service? No.
@Shannon66672192 the freedom of movement we were talking about was in the context of legal rights. Govts control borders...setting limits.
@Shannon66672192 I agree that freedom of movement in the context you're describing can be seen that way. Then Govts set limits...infringe
@Shannon66672192  it's simply the ability to do something that requires nobody else to provide it to you and doesn't infringe on others.
@Shannon66672192 nobody grants someone free speech, it's an inherent right. Govts and people can infringe on that right and they often do.
@Shannon66672192 I keep telling you that natural inherent rights aren't granted, can only be infringed on...yet you seem not to understand.
@Shannon66672192 wow, I'm just amazed at how skewed and clueless your worldview is...but then, you're a marxist so...it kinda makes sense
The amount of clueless dopes who think @Evan_McMullin is actually standing up for principles...and not just here to make $, is hilarious
.@Evan_McMullin spun his failed Presidential campaign into a $ making scheme. I hope he dupes every sucker who RTs him into giving him money https://t.co/lFPSG9ssxq
@Shannon66672192 What if all Doctors quit? Can Govt force them to provide labor to care for you? (psst, that's SLAVERY)
@Shannon66672192 healthcare can be a legal right. Legal rights are not inherent natural rights.
@Shannon66672192 natural rights are inherent, not granted and require nobody else's involvement. Freedom of speech, religion are examples.
@Shannon66672192 free speech is an inherent right. It can only be infringed on. And often is by Govts and people, like your example.
@Shannon66672192 1A doesn't say, "The people are hereby granted", it says, "Congress shall make no law" &lt;= restricts Govt.
@Shannon66672192 No. The 1A recognizes it as an INHERENT RIGHT. It doesn't grant it, it restricts Govt infringement.
@Shannon66672192 if someone doesn't provide you a human right to healthcare, can they be taken to the Hague for human rights abuse?
@Shannon66672192 people can form Govts which declare healthcare to be a legal right, sure. But not a human right.
@Shannon66672192 everything that requires someone else, isn't a natural right, it can be a legal right.
@Shannon66672192 we can quibble on the definition...I'm saying natural inherent rights aren't granted and require nobody to provide them
@Shannon66672192 yes, tyranny would be the extreme. And that's why the 1A declares it is an inherent right and Govt cannot infringe on it.
@Shannon66672192 no. You don't have the human right to someone else's labor. That is Slavery.
@Shannon66672192 it is free speech, and sure someone can stop you. Free speech is inherent. It can only be (and often is) infringed on.
@Shannon66672192 controlling a piece of land is not a natural inherent right like free speech.
@Shannon66672192 if you declare something is a human right, you're saying it cannot be denied you. Doctors can be FORCED to provide labor.
@Shannon66672192 healthcare can be a legal right, sure...but NOT a human right.
@Shannon66672192 nope. It's all land with walls. Only difference is in your own head trying to grapple with your own hypocrisy.
@Shannon66672192 if they wanted to remain separate from the US, those States could. They chose to join the US.
@Shannon66672192 slave owners provided slaves housing and food. They made the same arguments you are justifying their right to slave labor
@Shannon66672192 it's amusing that you think your plot of land surrounded by walls can't be encroached on...but other land with walls can.
@Shannon66672192 Maine and Vermont are part of The United States of America. Those United States decided who can cross state and US borders
@Shannon66672192 I say you do NOT have the right to another person's labor...that's called Slavery. What say you?
@Shannon66672192  It's a simple question =&gt; Do you believe you have the right to the labor of another person to care for you?
@Shannon66672192 so you do agree Govt gets to decide who can cross which borders.
@Shannon66672192 Govt gets to decide who crosses. It decided people in America can freely cross state borders.
@Shannon66672192 lol...sure it is. It's a plot of land surrounded by walls.
@Shannon66672192 you believe you have the right to the labor of another person to care for you?
@Shannon66672192 you believe people have a right to freely cross the border, so long as they don't cross the border of your own home?
@Shannon66672192 "a country is different than a house" &lt;= the border you have around you is simply a smaller version of the same thing.
@Shannon66672192 do you believe healthcare is a human right?
@Shannon66672192 do you believe people have the right to cross the US border unencumbered? How about enter your home unencumbered?
@Shannon66672192 if you're an American who swears allegiance to ISIS and declares War on the US...that is against the law.
@Shannon66672192 do you believe in the concept of inherent natural rights or are rights something Govts grant people?
@Shannon66672192 that's not what I'm suggesting. I'm asking if a foreign terrorist who's declared war on the US has a right to live here?
@Shannon66672192 I did, you didn't clarify. Free speech, inherent right or granted by Govt?
@Shannon66672192 "everyone should have the right to free speech" &lt;= please clarify...it's an inherent right or granted by Govt?
@Shannon66672192 it's a simple question, do you believe ISIS has a right to live in America? I say NO, what say you?
@Shannon66672192 do you believe you have an inherent right to free speech or that Govt generously grants you that right?
@Shannon66672192 ISIS has a right to live in America? With you?
@Shannon66672192 you don't believe in individual rights. You believe in collective rights where a central Govt controls people's lives, yes?
@Shannon66672192 I thought as much. I appreciate your honesty.
@Shannon66672192 sure...ok. On a completely different topic, are you a Marxist/Socialist and do you hate Capitalism? Be honest.
@Shannon66672192 I have complete faith in my arguments. Measuring .000003% of anything and calling it a "disturbing trend" is pure quackery.

@Shannon66672192 measuring a tiny 130 yrs (.000003%) out of 4.5 billion yrs and calling it "disturbing trend", is not science. It's quackery
@Shannon66672192 nope. It's been much hotter/colder and CO2 levels higher/lower many times over in the past.

@StreeverWrites that Russia may have hacked the DNC and released info to Wikileaks is irrelevant to Trump's free and fair election win.
@mortalcassie either you believe the emails being released hurt her election chances or it didn't...which is it?
@mortalcassie the cover up of her personal server, destruction of her emails, the media collusion, collusion to defeat Bernie in the primary
@mortalcassie you believe the American people learned too much about the DNC and Hillary's corruption, so you want a do over. Nope sorry.
@mortalcassie hold on...then what exactly were in the Wikileaks emails that you believed influenced the election?
@mortalcassie You: "The DNC was incompetent and got hacked. Hillary's lies and corruption were exposed. I demand a new election!"
@mortalcassie it doesn't matter if there's video of Putin himself hacking the DNC. That's irrelevant to the election results.
@mortalcassie you're angry that the American people learned of the lies and corruption surrounding Hillary's campaign. Admit it...
@mortalcassie Sorry, we're not overturning an election because the DNC was incompetent at cyber security.
@mortalcassie no, you believe that emails being leaked provided too much information for Americans...and so you want a new election.
@paul_carilli if you thought it was treasonous, you'd do something about it. You're just a weak pathetic coward.
@mortalcassie no proof the RNC got hacked.

@mortalcassie let's assume that's true. Russia hacked DNC. Released info to Wikileaks. What's that got to do with Trump?
@MariuszKlimek hey dumbfuck, which part of this being an Electoral vote election where 270 wins confuses your tiny squirrel-sized brain?
@Boogar_Sugar LOL...ok, you just keep bitching on Twitter then. You're really accomplishing something, you fuckin weak coward. @nycsouthpaw
@MariuszKlimek @neur0atypical @webgenie01 this was an Electoral college election. Trump won. Which part of that confuses you?

@rorymcin @JuddLegum your side ran a terrible candidate. You're out of touch with middle America. You need to accept it.
