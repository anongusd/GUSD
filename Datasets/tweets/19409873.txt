Thank you @Ilhan for speaking truth to power. It's absurd that @Ilhan is repeatedly attacked for critiquing Israel for violations against the Palestinian people, while AIPAC has unchecked influence to protect Israel from accountability. ADC is proud to stand w/ @Ilhan!
For years now Arab and Muslim passengers have endured discrimination and profiling while flying. Physical assault crosses a threshold that we rarely see, and it’s dangerous. If @Delta does not take action they will be sending a message that they condone such actions.
ADC also filed a formal complaint with the Department of Transportation. We cannot let such actions take place without ramifications. The pilot must be held accountable for his actions, and @Delta must address this issue immediately.
This morning ADC attorneys filed a formal internal complaint with @Delta over the physical assault inflicted by one of their pilots on passenger @KhaledBeydoun. Such treatment in our opinion is a reflection of the pilots perceived negative bias towards Arabs and Muslims.

Khalaf: With [Arabs], even if you come from Sudan, on the Census you are considered "White".  #ADCConvention18
ADC President @SamerKhalaf: Due to the Asian Exclusion Act, Asians were the last to get the right to vote - including after women and African Americans. There was confusion in the government re: how to classify people from the Middle East, the Arab world &amp; India. #ADCConvention18
Vargas: In the course of discovery we have learned that Secretary Ross had conversations about having the citizenship question with people in the White House like Steve Bannon. #ADCConvention18
Vargas: There are six lawsuits pending to remove [the citizenship question] from the upcoming Census. All of them argue that the Secretary did not follow the proper procedure.... that he did it for political motivation... aimed at harming immigrant groups. #ADCConvention18
Vargas: This is not the Census that the Census Bureau has been planning for 10 years... Their efforts are being sabotaged by Congress and the administration. What will happen in 2020 is not the operation the Bureau has been planning due to: 1) lack of funding. #ADCConvention18
Vargas: The Census has never been accurate. There has always been an undercount of certain populations... not the rich. Not the people who have two houses. They are people who are poor, don't speak English, who are immigrants, children, African-Americans, Latinos, Arab Americans.
Vargas; The largest program that uses Census information is Medicaid. Then it's education. Then it's transportation.... that's how essential it is. And it's about distributing political power... it's about power and it's about money. #ADCConvention18

Mansour: We will not accept the US' blackmail of starving UNRWA. #ADCConvention18
Mansour: The US cut $300 million from UNRWA. We had to come up iwth $450 million deficit as a result. I am proud to say we were able to cut that deficit to $60 million. Our ambassador in Canada told me today the Canadians will give $62 million more to UNRWA.
Ambassador Mansour: @UNRWA schools [in Palestine] are remarkable with great, smart, and resilient kids who are not losing sight of hope. #ADCConvention18
Mansour: [Regarding Oslo] Many of us disagreed with Oslo and resigned from our positions... The agreements were not crystal clear in two areas: ending the occupation... and stopping settlement activities. #ADCConvention18
Mansour: Normalization [does not come] before withdrawal.... It should be honored and respected.
Mansour: [regarding normalization] Our position is clear. The Arab Peace Initiative... stipulates that Israel has to withdraw from all areas it occupies to allow for the independence of Palestine before normalization begins.
Mansour: [Palestinian and Arab-American organizations] cannot continue to operate as isolated islands.  #ADCConvention18
Nashashibi: If we consistently met with members of Congress about [the Palestinian] message, something can be done - we can start a tidal wave. #ADCConvention18
Mansour: It seems to me there is the possibility to have a large movement among (university students) ... Our children are becoming very active on their own.... We should listen to them and learn from them about how to organize under [today's] conditions. #ADCConvention18

@CallenFamily Refugee status is not about the host country. The fact is that all people have a right to live w/o fear &amp; persecution in their homeland.
@CallenFamily Majority of countries do not allow naturalization, only work permit or limited residency. Even where exist, there are specific eligibility.
@CallenFamily You cannot just change being a refugee. It is a human condition that is forced upon people like Palestinians who were forced from their home
@CallenFamily Refugees are people who cannot return to their home because they have effectively been forced out of their homeland based on their identity.
@JudeanPF All people have a right to exist. Palestinians have the same inalienable human rights as everyone, including the right to exist.
@Amani90__ No one can judge another's person's plight, persecution, and suffering under systematic oppression.
