Carly &amp; Donald have not mentioned to you that very hard times are forthcoming. Why? Because they want you to think they can prevent it.
Why is it that these experienced business candidates are not warning about this? Because they don't care about you. Only their own egos.
Besides, we are facing a huge economic crisis, so it matters little who is at the helm &amp; whoever it is will get the blame for it.
