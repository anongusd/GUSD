Today’s designation of Hamza bin Laden to the UN’s ISIL/al-Qa’ida sanctions list is a great example of international cooperation against the al-Qa’ida network. These sanctions bring attention to the destabilizing activities of al-Qa’ida and weaken its leadership.

“The final, fully verified denuclearization of N.Korea is the int’l community’s over-riding objective. The evidence no longer allows us to take Russia’s word that it shares this objective. Russia must now demonstrate by its deeds that it shares our objectives in N.Korea.”
“Russia has engaged in a concerted campaign in the Security Council to cover up violations of sanctions, whether they’re committed by Russians or citizens of other states. The United States has evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations.”
“The difficult, sensitive talks with North Korea are ongoing.  The Trump-Kim summit has set us on the path toward complete denuclearization.  But we are not there yet. And until we get there, we must not ease the powerful worldwide sanctions that are in place.”
Given recent efforts by some Member States to undermine &amp; obstruct North Korea sanctions implementation, the United States has called an urgent Security Council meeting. Amb.

“Peacekeeping is based on trust b/w the protected and the protectors. We, the Security Council, give them this power.  We are responsible for what they do with it – not just for the sake of the victims, but for the sake of the mission, the UN &amp; peacekeeping itself.”
“We ask our peacekeepers to go into dangerous situations and put themselves in between warring parties. We ask them to be brave and impartial and, above all, to protect some of the most vulnerable people in the world.  We ask this all in the name of peace.”

Once a wealthy country, today the Maduro regime steals food from its people, deprives them of medical supplies and profits off their misfortune. We won’t stop getting loud for the people of Venezuela. https://t.co/0xyOrB5wA4
“Corruption is not just something for us to dismiss as someone else’s problem. It’s at the heart of protests that are affecting international peace and security. Venezuela is a wake-up call. We urge all of our colleagues, both on the Security Council and off, to heed it.”
“Hugo Chavez’s perverse vision of a socialist paradise in Venezuela has transformed into a criminal narco-state that is robbing the Venezuelan people blind.”
“Something is very wrong when citizens of an oil rich country have to leave in order to beg on Colombian streets to feed their children.  That something is the corruption of the Maduro regime. This is a man-made crisis.  Period.”

“The fact is, corrupt regimes cannot be ignored, wished away, dealt with quietly or with whispers.  If the Security Council is going to deliver on its commitment to peace and security, corruption must be addressed.” https://t.co/wvAGNeZgcB
"Governments in places like Venezuela and Iran don’t exist to serve their people and happen to do a little corruption on the side. They exist to serve their own interests and corruption is the means by which they do so."
“9 of 10 countries that Transparency International considers the most corrupt in the world are on the Security Council’s agenda. But instead of reflecting on why this is the case, the United Nations is too often willing to ignore corruption.”

"To this day, the U.S. does more for human rights, both inside the UN &amp; around the world, than any other country. And we will continue to do that. We just won’t do it inside a Council that consistently fails the cause of human rights." #HaleyAtHeritage https://t.co/ZDhs3eLku0 https://t.co/plSIzgoYrV
Our thoughts on the UN Human Rights Council. For the full speech, visit: https://t.co/6AHsyVsdmu https://t.co/HZf3Jjs1Kq

"Our withdrawal from the Human Rights Council does not mean that we give up our fight for reform. On the contrary, any country willing to work with us to reshape the Council need only ask." -Ambassador Nikki Haley #HaleyAtHeritage
"No one should make the mistake of equating membership in the Human Rights Council with the support for human rights. To this day, the U.S. does more for human rights, both inside the UN &amp; around the world, than any other country. And we will continue to do that."#HaleyAtHeritage
"To speak freely, to associate &amp; worship freely; to determine your own future; to be equal before the law–these are sacred rights. We take these rights seriously–too seriously to allow them to be cheapened by an institution–esp. one that calls itself the 'Human Rights Council.'"
"Judged by how far it has fallen short of its promise, the Human Rights Council is the UN's greatest failure. It has taken the idea of human dignity...and it has reduced it to just another instrument of international politics. And that is a great tragedy." #HaleyAtHeritage
"We are a special nation with a special message for the world. We are a country founded on human dignity; on the revolutionary idea that all men are created equal with rights including, but not limited to, life, liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness." –Amb. Haley #HaleyAtHeritage
