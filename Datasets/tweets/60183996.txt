@EBoyajy Oops was talking about Kavanaugh. Trump will have a hard time finding a good reason to dump Rosenstein that can’t be construed as obstruction of justice. It’s Rosenstein job to initiate that kind of investigation if he thinks it’s warranted.
@EBoyajy Definitely. He’s toast. If Agent Orange were smart he would nominate someone else of his evangelical-approved list yesterday.

@ed4256 The death toll and lack of power are not opinions. No I don’t dispute the report. I dispute what wasn’t done. I disputed the results and I suspect the results are what they are because Trump, and his followers consider it another country (like you tweeted) and not part of the US
@ed4256 It’s not a country it’s a territory of the United States of America.
@ed4256 Actually I did know that. It’s no excuse after all this time.
https://t.co/CtxtAyXFGu
@ed4256 They didn’t get the hospitals up and running fast enough. They still haven’t gotten the power on. They could have sent more and better people faster. Is that specific enough?
@ed4256 No. Why. What’s your point?
@HarrietBaldwin Right each outcome is individual. From your tweet I can’t ever ascertain if you disagree with me.
@HarrietBaldwin @KLSouth Also it’s not the same network. ABC is owned by Disney. TBS is owned by Time Warner. It’s not a double standard in the normal sense if two completely different institutions are setting the standards.
@HarrietBaldwin @KLSouth There is no double standard because the standard is RACISM is unacceptable. Insulting someone in power for the positions they CHOOSE to support is not.
@ed4256 Fired I don’t have as much of a problem with. TBS is free to make that decision on their own.
@ed4256 Almost half the island still doesn’t have power. Over 1,000 died. The Americans in TX were happy with the response. The Americans in Peurto RICO are not.
@ed4256 Pretty sure you wrote fined.
@ed4256 And he is completely accurate concerning Trump’s inaction in Peurto Rico. What’s your problem with this? No one should criticize the great leader even when he obviously screws up?
@ed4256 Agreed. So you agree she shouldn’t be fined or is this just whataboutism?
For what? the word was bleeped and it was on cable anyway, not broadcast so Im guessing the FCC has no jurisdiction anyway. Irregardless do you want the next Democratic administration to be fining conservatives that criticize their administration? @ed4256 https://t.co/GxRccA5aaQ

Great set up, problem is you replaced bigotry and hatefulness for a punchline. https://t.co/RcNkO0SZNy

Are you sure you aren't just searching internet from gov websites? Can you give me link to policy? https://t.co/ZfXKxCZDcY
Google is just picking up rumor. Which gov website says we have a policy against Christians? https://t.co/ZfXKxCZDcY

No. All I'm saying is people can and do love their neighbor without Christianity. You said it's impossible. https://t.co/hkW0GhhhaV
Most of us don't need a book or a reason. https://t.co/UIwYEuS5CB
You were unable to love at all before you became a Christian. https://t.co/UIwYEuS5CB
Because it makes them feel good, because they can't help it. Before Jesus did no one love? https://t.co/UIwYEuS5CB
Just because some people don't love their neighbor does not mean it is impossible without Christ  https://t.co/Vds49OZPnY
I'm not an atheist. I don't see how ISIS is at all relevant. Fight, flight, and cooperation are all selected traits https://t.co/Vds49OZPnY
Because it's compassionate. You are saying no Jews are capable of loving their enemy? https://t.co/Yuwt5w2FTX
What? So because I know cooperation is selected for I support ISIS? What? Lol https://t.co/2bOcD87wAK
Can you prove that without a bible verse? Do you think you are winning this debate? https://t.co/i1LqotNF4u
Prove it. https://t.co/i1LqotNF4u
So Jews are incapable of loving their enemy? Agnostics? That is obviously untrue. https://t.co/9X8dnSnpnd
That is extremely simple view. Learning to love enemy and cooperate helps survival. Your tweet is patently wrong. https://t.co/Xi02rTsODP
So when I love my enemy that's not my brain. That's the supernatural? https://t.co/S2kciQFyOP
Can we experience Truth without brain function? https://t.co/fxeVduzsPd
Calling me "clueless" is not an argument. Love is a word used to describe a combination of brain activities. https://t.co/8ADhfOZAht
You are assigning beliefs to me I do not hold and you are not answering any difficult questions. https://t.co/LVduQ7SnVv
Reading from a religious text does not contradict a biological argument. https://t.co/fw1npc9053
If someone's brain stops functioning they cannot love. Don't you agree? https://t.co/fxeVduzsPd
Now you are using a different quote.  https://t.co/LJ3LDeo1wv
How long do you spend with these people before you judge their souls? Isn't that against Christ's message? https://t.co/fB1nvaVNz4
So you are saying the the human feeling of love is not generated by brain activity but the supernatural? https://t.co/HvkdLCLLq4
Ok what is the original Greek? Do you know? https://t.co/4Dw3tfCKDO
He had the same idea. Are you asking for the exact same quote in another language?  https://t.co/VESk3SiCSn
Can you be more specific? What kind of love? https://t.co/tbmONUf2Dl
Love certainly is particle. Your brain is made of particles. Are you claiming are emotions aren't biological? https://t.co/tbmONUf2Dl
