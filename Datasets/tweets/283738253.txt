@addicted_spurs @Hotspur_World I love Hugo.  I support him.  I don't badmouth him.  However, I don't think he's one of the top 10 keepers in the world (therefore undroppable) and he's in a rough patch right now. So he's not a must start for me right now.
@addicted_spurs @Hotspur_World I agree on the West Ham ones.
@addicted_spurs @Hotspur_World I've seen every game he's played.  How many of those goals do you put on him?
@addicted_spurs @Hotspur_World Hugo is a superior shot stopper to Vorm.  Vorm is a good shot stopper though and his distribution is better.  Hugo's confidence is shot at the moment, however, and I prefer Vorm for the FA Cup semifinal.
@addicted_spurs @Hotspur_World Wow, I hope not
@Hotspur_World Is this even a question?  Vorm has started every FA Cup match and has been great.

@realdealdanny I was most appalled by Dier and Lamela.  And I'm not sure Paulinho knows what he's supposed to do.
@realdealdanny @greg_jenner @pokeefe1 we turn @yedlinny into a right winger and he'll make Lennon look slow

@JimTrotter_NFL @AdamSchefter he probably will get signed.  How many chances did Lo Phillips get?
RT @SpursInTheBlood: Lamela is actually amazing. You wait till he gets everything together and watch it click like never before.

They way I see it, we only need to bring in another 9 decent players to contend for finishing top half of table.  #C0YS #THFC #TOTSTK
You know who was spot on regarding our players.  Tim Sherwood.  So depressing. #COYS #THFC
@MenInBlazers he's thinking he could walk back into Spurs and be there best player
Hoping for this XI: Lloris, Naughton, Vertonghen, Kaboul, Rose, Mason, Dembele, Lamela, Eriksen, Townsend, Kane #COYS #THFC #totvstoke
