@THEbitchiestgay @georgiarealist Clearly he's learning some lessons but he seems bent making the same mistakes 9vet.
@THEbitchiestgay @georgiarealist Tonaston is enigmatic. Normally you'd expect a bully to be cruel to animals. He's got baggage from his dad's death. The dreams with him bouncing back and forth in time, married to Polly and having a child.
@THEbitchiestgay @georgiarealist @TonastonTales Well I'll do what I can.
@THEbitchiestgay @georgiarealist I liked the chapter, Cliffhanger! Clever. But clever was on display. I'm trying to decide how to do an Amazon review without spoilers.

@georgiarealist @THEbitchiestgay That is a BIG loose end!
@THEbitchiestgay The end was unexpected. Tonaston growing 3 years in a few minutes, losing a hand in the process? That I didn't get but I imagine it'll make sense in book 2.
@THEbitchiestgay I finished it about 4 this morning. It was a real page turner! I guess you'd classify it as fantasy. Not sure if it's for children but I certainly enjoyed. Of course, there are lots of loose threads. When is book 2?

@Wordsmithpaul @molratty @scareduck It sure all would agree with me on that.
@Wordsmithpaul @molratty @scareduck I would say textualism is a subset of originalism. It's just original meaning of the words vs original intent of the authors since word meaning is less subjective.
@Wordsmithpaul @scareduck @molratty I think that was hyperbole but his point was well taken.
Followers - 13, Unfollowers - 19. I didn't know it'd be this simple. Get your daily stats via https://t.co/a14caTm1ZH.
@scareduck @molratty Agreed but Scalia didn't believe you could discern intent. Rather, he was a textualist, believing you have to get at the meaning of the words at the time they were written, not their meaning today.
@THEbitchiestgay Oh yes!
@THEbitchiestgay Chapter 4. Tonaston is headed into town on the hospital bad. The just got to the stream with the sharks
