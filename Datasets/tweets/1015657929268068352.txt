2/2 		To believe against all the evidence that something seemingly bad will turn out good, and to act accordingly. To love in a manner that makes you vulnerable, even when you know the other person will take advantage.
1/2 		The walk of grace is... :)		To reward instead of punish. To bless instead of curse. To give to instead of take from. To endure with patience instead of giving up. To hope against hope. To have faith in what is not seen.
