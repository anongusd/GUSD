@theresejones0 @councilofdc Again, Kids Ride Free is tracked separately. If a juvenile doesn't have a student card, there's a separate button for that.
@theresejones0 @councilofdc The "Kids Ride Free" program is tracked separately. Re low-income, there is nothing stopping any jurisdiction from creating a fare program for low-income riders. In fact, we would welcome that as an alternative to this approach. https://t.co/7n2R5Egif5
@BoozeFinger @councilofdc Unfortunately, that would put bus operators in a position where they could be assaulted. The goal has been to ensure that everyone pays their fair share, while protecting our front line employees from conflicts.

@Terpin8or @councilofdc Under DC's proposed legislation, the offenses you just mentioned would be decriminalized as well (e.g. littering on Metro).
@GRN96WS6 @councilofdc We have the same question.
@jamespizzurro @councilofdc Bus operators log each occurrence of fare evasion by pressing a designated key on their on-board computer. Approx 80% in DC.
Financial Impact of Fare Evasion: As @councilofdc considers making fare evasion no longer a crime, consider this: In first 10 months of 2018, with current enforcement, there were *9.35 million* actual occurrences of fare evasion on buses alone, worth ~$25 million annually. #wmata https://t.co/iM4Q8IwI9g
