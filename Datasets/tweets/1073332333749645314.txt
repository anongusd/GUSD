RT @ProtectUSWrkers: Please watch 60 Minutes tonight 7pm Est. Very Important episode https://t.co/llBuW5N3vV
I should add that I was staying with family and my iPad was on their WiFi. So the WiFi in the cottage and the wifi in the house where we talked about the chicken book were the same system.
@Jenn4Laughs See my other thread about the chicken book.
@Jenn4Laughs Probably the phone doesn‚Äôt record conversations (no $ in that), but it obviously does pick up key words to sell that info to 3rd parties. And that‚Äôs when the phone is not in use, just not turned off.
Apple probably just notes keywords, not entire conversations, so they can sell your info. But it‚Äôs still pretty creepy. In the future, what could possibly go wrong? (End)
I had never searched online for anything about any kind of farming or raising any kind of animals, much less chickens. The only way this could have happened is that the iPhones were picking up our conversation. (part3)
About 10 minutes later I went across the yard to the cottage where my iPad was. Turned it on and checked my gmail. Right away there was an email from Amazon advertising a book on how to raise chickens. (Part2)
What freaks me out with smart phones. True story: was joking with family about how we should get a book on chicken farming for a friend. I did not have a phone with me. They had theirs. (Part1)
@Jenn4Laughs And same phone #.

To top it all off, the internet went down so I had to start getting dressed all over again. I wonder if people in the third world know how hard we have it in the first world?
I then had a general protection fault (GPF) with the jacket‚Äôs zipper causing it to crash. Also, through some design fault, I could only match my left sock with my right shoe and visa-versa.
In pulling on my trousers I found that my left pant leg refused to talk to my right pant leg and so had to do a factory re-set on them and get them to recognize my wi-fi all over again.
