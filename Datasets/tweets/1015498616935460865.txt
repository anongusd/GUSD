Please @PoliceNG @PoliceNG_PCRRU I will like to know if the law is meant for influenced people to intimidate the poor. @segalink  sir, kindly help to look into this. the school again is Melville schools, No 9 Zion close opposite just rite off kosoko,ojodu berger. Thanks
The lawyer went to the School for enquiries but with a great surprise, the same DPO, called the woman on phone asking her why she will send a lawyer to the School that the school authorities are more influenced and she not try to anything stupid by suing the school.
The following day. After all the scenario of an innocent woman suffered for defending her daughter by those that think they are influenced, she withdrew her daughter from the school. This year she reported the case to one of her sister that's a lawyer.....
With the authority from the DPO Police Division Ajigboluja Police station. She was threatened to be locked up in the cell which she obliged but later released if she will pay sum of 10,000 Naira. She was able to raised 3,000 Naira with undertaken that she will bring the balance
But no remorse from the school authority but rather threatened to arrest the woman with police, the woman left the school and was arrested the following day by The proprietress they call her mummy G, Mrs Rita Adegboye, and Mrs Adeyemo..
They agreed to allow her stay till Friday that week. The following day after she came back from work her daughter start to develop high temperature, it was there that she learnt that the girl of 9years was asked to do 40 laps of frog jump. Next day she was in school for complaint
Around November Last year one of my friend daughter was sent back home from Melville schools, No 9 Zion close opposite just rite off kosoko,ojodu berger because of non availability of school fees, after paying part of the pay and plea with school authority,

No increment of salaries, no basic allowance, no checkmate on senior officers and no effective weapons in Affected areas of NE.
@DefenceInfoNG @HQNigerianArmy https://t.co/w6otXgwpu6
@bolanle_cole @HQNigerianArmy will soon prosecute those soldiers in the picture for exposing their weakness. Always blur the face of soldiers to avoid intimidation from their boss
@iameneji @MBuhari @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Your response dont even make sense
@iameneji @MBuhari @atiku @OfficialPDPNig Enough of all these political rubbish, 100 of soldiers died no Buharist even say anything about it. By the time things turn around there will be no soft landing for any politician in this country.
All the Generals in North East should be sacked and prosecuted, including buratai, #sackallNAgenerals @renoomokri @benmurraybruce @atiku
@HQNigerianArmy @DefenceInfoNG @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo im expecting The Generals to deny this, if @MBuhari did not sack and probe all the generals in NE including Buratai means hes level of incompetency is very high. https://t.co/0kIXqF0SUG

@geeweeny @cypher_2dajee @cchukudebelu Let's start from Arochukwu, ohafia ngwa, ubakala which is umuahia North, tell me where there's single good roads in those area, Aba is business empire of Abia state so they don't deserve to be ignored. With oil revenues Abia state can't be compared to Osun state base on amenities

@geeweeny @cypher_2dajee @cchukudebelu No major town have any good roads or dam for drinking water, I don't what development meant to you.
