Same with decades of attempts by northern Democrats plus LBJ, and their Republican allies to pass civil rights bills, which built up a consensus over time and told the country clearly, who everybody was and where they stood, for better or worse. Important part of politics.
When House Republicans under Paul Ryan repeatedly passed futile bills to repeal Obamacare or the ‚ÄúRyan budgets‚Äù that decimated the safety net, they didn‚Äôt pass the Senate but they were markers of what the party stands for. And repeated votes forced pols to take a side, publicly.
Lots of commentary on how unlikely any of this is to pass the Senate. But that‚Äôs not the House‚Äôs job - the job of politics is to lay down markers and then pass the ball. The senate votes on these bills, and whether they even get to the floor, are markers. https://t.co/IKUS3JRWoB

The most charitable reading is that Schultz's trial balloon is an attempt to terrify Democratic primary voters into nominating someone who vows NOT to raise his taxes to give broke people college and healthcare.
Oh and also Donald Trump's bad manners. So... the answer is to definitely not raise his taxes to give regular folks college and healthcare.
The flaw in this argument by Steve Schmidt is that Schultz isn't articulating a case about the broken electoral system. He appears to be motivated by anger that a Democratic president might raise his taxes to give broke people college and healthcare. https://t.co/KnAnRrSaHn

@Cybervox1 I think you've got a strong point there.
Hotter take than mine for sure: https://t.co/HW7BvGRGmn
Another not-so out there hot take: based just on the "on-10" reactions to their candidacies (both positive and negative) it seems that the two women in the race: Harris and Warren, are, at least for now, the Democratic front-runners.
Wouldn't that ground her trajectory to favoring Wall St regulation and a wealth tax in that background, and not ideology? Not so original hot take: the billionaires attacking Warren so reflexively (and defensively) probably helps her politically.
The weird thing about Howard Schultz, Mike Bloomberg and all of conservative Christendom attacking Elizabeth Warren as a "far lefty"socialist is that she's actually a bankruptcy law expert -- that's literally her field -- and former lifelong Republican from Norman, Oklahoma.

All of these Democratic candidates are going to have to pass that acid test. And giving a speech is a lot harder than it looks. You have to not just make your points and do the poetry but also move the crowd (including the TV crowd.)

@davydawg @TheLastWord and level three: if as you say the idea of building a wall is a waste of money, which every rational actor agrees that it is (including Republicans who refused to fund it when they controlled both houses), Congress has a duty to not toss money at the president to soothe him.
@davydawg @TheLastWord This is an irrational argument on multiple levels. Level one: the House, which Democrats control, has already voted 10 times to reopen the government. Level two: the Republican controlled Senate is who is refusing to vote to reopen government. ...

Would love to hear Republican Senators explain WHY they won't vote to reopen the government and restore paychecks to their own constituents. On camera.

FYI: trade deals don't produce cash appropriations to pay for border walls. The NAFTA update (not yet ratified by congress) is no different. #TrumpAddress
Trump is claiming that "the wall" -- now a "steel barrier" -- isn't his idea. It's now supposedly the request of U.S. border officials. #TrumpAddress
Opened with a Bannonite flourish attempting to appeal to African-Americans on the basis of employment competition from undocumented immigrants (which of course undercuts Trump's other argument: that there is no African-American employment crisis because he totally fixed it...)
This #TrumpAddress already sounds like a Stephen Miller speech.
Democrats have distilled what were a few different arguments down to one simple, obvious narrative, and they so far are sticking to it. They clearly have gotten the message from those who ask: "why even discuss funding a wall that Trump said Mexico would pay for?" https://t.co/tZLbLO3qmQ

@LkMoller13 Omg ok after this I give up: THAT is not the job of the Speaker of the House. They are not a campaign chair (DCCC and DSCC chairs exist); they are not party leader or spokesperson (See: DNC). They lead the CAUCUS. They organize the caucus. They negotiate bills &amp; parry w/ POTUS.
@T_FisherKing It‚Äôs a fair point. If he thinks he knows best for the caucus, he should run for speaker. Why hide behind another member?
@LkMoller13 I get the feeling you don‚Äôt know much about what a House speaker is or does... being on TV is not the job. The job is organizing and leading the caucus &amp; committees, bringing legislation to the floor and passing bills, raising money for members and helping recruit candidates.

What people forget is that becoming speaker means corralling more than 218 votes. No newcomer would have the chops to do that. The speaker usually has done a ton of fundraising for other members and been in the game long enough to develop relationships.
One Dem insider tells me: potentially the big beneficiary of the ‚ÄúGet Pelosi‚Äù drama could be her number 2, Steny Hoyer - one year older than Pelosi, in Congress just as long - but likely the only person who could put together enough votes to be speaker if she is toppled.

Viewed that way, the anti-Pelosi gambit is not unlike the old DLC push in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the same goal: push the Democratic Party to the right. That's a really weird response to what we just saw happen in the midterms.
This despite Pelosi leading the party back to the majority twice, pushing through Obamacare, which was THE issue that helped Dems win this cycle, and the failure of the GOP's strategy of running against her. Also, the wave was urban-suburban, young, diverse &amp; female-not converts.
Smart take from @CharlesPPierce, who reminds us that the anti-Pelosi revolt is not coming from her left (she's been demonized for years as a "San Francisco liberal") but from her right, by red and purple state Dems who want the party to woo Trump voters: https://t.co/OIka6ikv3U

@saychieeef Yup. And good public schools attract corporate and especially tech HQs as well, which requires property taxes. States that underfund public K-12 and even college education in pursuit of lower and lower taxes will only have more difficulty competing (though not for retirees).
@benjaminrgold As troublesome as it is, the MTA is the largest underground transportation system in America. It certainly can handle the volume. And I think for an influx of 12,000 jobs NY and NYC will be more than incentivized to improve it.

Also as some of you have mentioned in the replies, the Democratic candidate for Agricultural Commissioner, Nikki Fried, has now gone ahead of her Republican opponent in the recount, 50%-49.9%. Welcome to Florida elections, everybody!
@ProudLibPat Haven't heard that. What we know from local reporting is that Broward elections had trouble submitting results from 7 precincts electronically so they had to put the data in a truck and drive it to election headquarters.
@DillyPlate Yep, that happened as well. Provisionals and absentees are shifting the race ever so slightly toward the Democrats.

For Rs, the main takeaway seems to be that Trumpism, especially in its rawest forms, has proved durably compelling to the GOP base, including white GOP women.  Especially in Florida, which I think could now credibly be classified as a red state.
Also expanded Medicaid in multiple states, reinfranchising 1.4 million in Florida and electing some 100 women, POC, LGBT, 2 Muslim women... overall the party fared well. AZ and Tester could even limit the Senate loss.
