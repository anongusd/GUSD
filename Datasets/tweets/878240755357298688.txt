@DanCrenshawTX Let’s suppose that the house caves and grants funds for the wall. What kind of wall will be built? Steel slats can be sawed through. How much more will it cost to maintain such a wall over however many miles it covers? What’s the exact (or rough) plan for the wall going forward?
@kasubo @truthoverhate @sjashta @ServiceSleeper @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump I’m not debating the names of the parties. Only the ideologies behind them, and which modern day parties hold these values. I’m also not holding either party responsible for abolishing or upholding slavery, just clarifying the ideologies that did so
@truthoverhate @sjashta @ServiceSleeper @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Those who wanted a smaller government supported slavery, those who wanted a larger federal government supported abolition. Which one of these two sounds like the modern conception of Republicans and which one sounds like Democrats?

and become exactly the kind of nation on display in that courtyard. A single flag, surrounded by reminders of our former friends.
Economic partners, and perhaps the most important role of all, as the source of the immigrants that make our country the torch of liberty in a world that often favors power over people, we will cease to be the great country that we are,
While I usually tend to give these kinds of things the benefit of the doubt, I would like to remind everyone that while a belief in American exceptionalism is not necessarily wrong. If we forget the roles that other nations have played in our history, be it as allies in wartime,
But I was struck by the fact that someone would actively choose to remove the flags of other countries from their poles, when (at least to me) there seemed to be no reason to remove them.
The multitude of flags from countries around the world had been removed, and the American flag stood alone at the center. I realize there is nothing inherently wrong with this.

@HumanistReport The older (and often infertile) males can be aggressive towards other animals and kill younger, fertile males. This is an especially bad problem for elephants during breeding season (“must”).
@HumanistReport I’m going to play devil’s advocate here.  A lot of wildlife preserves will offer tourists the opportunity to hunt older males in a population, and use the proceeds to fund conservation efforts.
@DavidCornDC And can be aggressive towards other elephants (especially during “must” breeding season). This can cause them to kill younger, fertile males and weaken the population
@DavidCornDC I’m going to play devils advocate here. A lot of wildlife reserves often allow tourists to purchase licenses to hunt older males in a population. They use the money to fund other conservation efforts. This is because older males tend to be infertile (cont.)
@yashar Older bulls are often unable to reproduce successfully, and can become aggressive (especially during breeding season) and kill younger, fertile bulls, which harms the population as a whole.
@yashar I’m going to play devils advocate here. In the article attached, it says that this was done legally on a conservancy. It isn’t unheard of for wildlife reserves and the like to offer hunts on older males and use the money for conservation purposes. (Cont.)
