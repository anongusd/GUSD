The time for action is now and Congress needs to seize this opportunity to scale up vaccination and screening rates around the world to save more women‚Äôs lives. Give the full report a read at https://t.co/hl7Efm46en
We are asking Congress to dedicate a portion of US global health funding towards improving access to preventive vaccines, screenings and treatment through international health initiatives.
Great progress has been made in the US in the fight against this disease over the past 30 yrs, resulting in cervical cancer death rates dropping by 50%. But incidence rates are much higher in other areas around the world, particularly in low and middle-income countries.
Today #ACSCAN released a report calling on Congress to join the global movement to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer. Working together, we can end the pain and suffering from this disease. Read our statement regarding the release of the report https://t.co/IIWbNZG0kv

‚ÄúWe look forward to working with you to build upon the foundation of the ACA and strengthen health care coverage."
‚ÄúWe urge the Committee-&amp; the Congress-to find bipartisan solutions that benefit patients. Such a process must ensure that individuals w/pre-ex are protected from discrimination, that essential health benefits are maintained, &amp; that coverage is made affordable for individuals.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs a result, the patient community is having to respond to policy changes that are chipping away many of the critical protections that were included in the law.‚Äù
‚ÄúUnfortunately, recent executive orders, legislative proposals and regulatory actions are putting some of these important protections at risk.‚Äù
‚ÄúPassage of the Affordable Care Act, with its many patient protections, significantly changed the landscape for cancer patients ‚Äì and all Americans...Enactment of the ACA has allowed Americans with cancer and other serious conditions to get the access to care they need.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the environment of the health insurance market prior to the ACA, cancer patients &amp; others w/serious illness could not always rely on having ins coverage to protect them when they needed it most. This had devastating effects on health outcomes, finances&amp; quality of life.‚Äù

Wrapping up here at the #ACSCAN National Forum today. Thanks for a good beginning to a conversation on #clinicaltrialbarriers. ICYMI: New report on clinical trials can be found here: https://t.co/o5h0Q2rfmu
Dr. Fashoyin-Aje on workforce diversity (or lack thereof): Linguistic or cultural issues may not be as readily apparent to research staff that aren't familiar with that culture. #clinicaltrialbarriers
Dr. Fashoyin-Aje: We have to be more adventurous in thinking about bringing other types of investigators or clinical sites into the fold. #clinicaltrialbarriers
Dr. Lola Fashoyin-Aje from @US_FDA addressing disparities in enrollment: We need to look at how and where a trial is deployed, what is the sample size and what are the eligibility criteria? #clinicaltrialbarriers
Archie Tse from @Merck: It's a hyper competitive field to attract patients with thousands of new therapies in the pipeline. #clinicaltrialbarriers
Jeff Allen from @CancerResrch: Often times eligibility criteria takes an "If it's not broke, don't fix it" approach; lifting criteria from previously approved trials #clinicaltrialbarrier
The final panel of the day will address trial design #clinicaltrialbarriers with representatives from @ASCO, @CancerResrch, @Merck and @US_FDA
Chair of @ACSCAN's board Dick Deming hosts a lunch panel to hear from patients about their personal experiences with clinical trials #clinicaltrialbarriers https://t.co/np8W1gw9Qm

.@clar_inet_sax In the long term, we need to make sure patient treatment goals match the trials they are participating in. #clinicaltrialbarriers
.@AnjeeDavis We have to be open to adapting to meet patients where they are &amp; develop a feedback loop for patients to share findings to turn them into champions to get more people to join clinical trials. #clinicaltrialbarriers
@RANAdvocate's Smith: To improve best practices, we have to have a central location for information sharing and break down the silos. #clinicaltrialbarriers
.@aesfCEO Is there a way to compensate sick patients as well as healthy patients to incentivize participation without violating ethics: #clinicaltrialbarriers

Next up is our panel on #clinicaltrialbarriers for patients featuring @LUNGevity's  @aesfCEO, @CancerSupportHQ's  @clar_inet_sax, @FightCRC's  @AnjeeDavis and @RANAdvocate's Mary Lou Smith.
.@AACI_Cancer's Hofacker: To increase diversity in trial industry should consider holding more trials at community sites. #clinicaltrialbarriers
.@docjcrews A great way for an institution looking to start trials for the first time in a resource-strained environment is to get together with partners who have prior experience. #clinicaltrialbarriers
Janie Hofacker from @AACI_Cancer Large majority of trials (75%+) occur at large academic institutions. But funding is available for regional cites to implement trials at well.  #clinicaltrialbarriers:

Barbara Lubejko from @OncologyNursing : Staff retention is an issue. Turnover is relatively high among research staff. This can affect trial completion. #clinicaltrialbarriers
.@ME_Fleury There are major disparities in clinical trial enrollment. #Cancer is a disease of the aging, yet older Americans are disproportionately underrepresented in trials. #clinicaltrialbarriers
