It's pretty pathetic that states whose laws constrict and constrain opportunities to start charters and therefore opportunity for students to attend them would rank in the top ten of anything. Seriously? https://t.co/4QuhggnBgY
There's a deal? Teacher in LA will get back to work. At what cost to kids? To the public? There is a better way. It's called freedom. Let teachers choose how to work, parents choose WHAT works for them. Districts are yesterday. Education, regardless of time and space, is today.

When you think about #teacherstrikes &amp; UTLA, consider what happens EVEN to best &amp; brightest in a 150 yr old system. Education is broken, people! That's the issue in LA not unions, or party politics. Don't believe me? Read 4 yourself https://t.co/SJTvO71M6p this story from Boston. https://t.co/ZDKsnKfEtb
Sorry for typo so let me correct and restate - it's PURE HYPERBOLE!!! And drama, and quite astonishing. You were a superintendent. Your SYSTEM received funds and distributed it to schools and individuals based on your decisions, not parents. That's the problem. It has to stop. https://t.co/CZRomBJwM9
(2/2)  PARENTS, not SYSTEMS, drive, not drain, the education funds the public allocates for education to the school that best meets their needs, and without charters and choices there would be NO such driving. Parents would remain stuck in neutral, as they have been for decades. https://t.co/CZRomBJwM9
(1/2) Josh this is per hyperbole! There is no draining of money from one place to another anywhere in education, unless you also consider people not having babies draining the potential for money, or one textbook vendor winning a contract a case of draining money from the other. https://t.co/QQJ1POVuQI
