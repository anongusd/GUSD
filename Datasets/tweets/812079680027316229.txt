@BretStephensAss @BretStephensNYT Thanks Bret. If I find noteworthy information sitting in the heart of the bluegrass capital of the world, I will forward any tid bits to you for your perusal.
@BretStephensNYT @realDonaldTrump By the way Bret, I personally try to follow your work wherever I can.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@BretStephensNYT @realDonaldTrump Thank you Bret. This 68 year old certainly respects your discussions, concepts and truthful opinions regarding current events that impact our everyday life.
@mattyglesias This is my point: both men are and were very admirable, intelligent, thoughtful and courageous individuals. America can be proud to have two such individuals leading our country during troubled times.
@bpolitics I feel Michael told the truth. Why? Well what does have to loose, nothing, he's already lost his freedom.
@SantorumsNose @RepThomasMassie Well BTresale did you happen to watch today's proceedings? Decorum can carry a tremendous amount of respect rather than over zealous rants.
@RepMarkMeadows Mr. Meadows, i feel you demonstrated very poor "Representative" work today on the Cohen Hearing. Sir you may want to ask your Republican friends for help in how to properly present proper political ideas on National television.
@NRCC No
@RepThomasMassie Mr. Massie, you may try working with a shovel or pick ax digging ditches to lay sewers because your questioning of Mr. Cohen certainly needed to be flushed to a sewer. I now question how you received the necessary votes to be my Representative in Kentucky.
@essenviews @liviapolise I think Mr. Rice should be held accountable for his contradictory statements.
@dcexaminer @KellyannePolls I can only believe Americans now understand where Ms Conway's allegiance lies.
@funder @TheDemCoalition I'm pleased that this man has now received a court ordered gag order while he awaits his trial hearing in Washington, DC.
@CBCPolitics What scientific training has this women received which would allow her to make a statement that sounds very similar to Trump's statement regarding what happened at Charlottesville.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseJudiciary @RepDougCollins Thank you sir for your tireless work in the Congressional Hearings involving Michael Cohen. I ask sir that your Hearings and all future Litigation regarding Trump related matters be made public to all Americans.
@senatemajldr Senator a Wallis not an answer. It is total waste of millions of dollars that can be directed to severe problems all Americans suffer now within our boundaries now.
@JoaquinCastrotx @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika Senator, I had the opportunity to watch your time this morning on Morning Joe. I support your opposition to a wall at our Southern Border. I hope you muster all necessary support to stop Trump's construction of an unnecessary monster of a wall.
@MoveOn Thank you Jon. I had the opportunity to see your national broadcast yesterday on "Morning Joe". You are so right, as time goes by American's memories diminish. I support your requests for all of America's Capital Giants to remember the ongoing 9/11 physical calamity in NYC.
@CaposSF @Caviar @tonyspizza415 @goldbelly Hey thanks. I'll see if I can't order something.
@Myminimine @dscc I stand corrected, 3 people including the weak Senator from my home state.
@CaposSF @Caviar Is it possible to have your pies shipped to Kentucky?
@guardian Thanks. Wish you had more. I had to get to sleep before the show ended.
@TerryMcAuliffe @Morning_Joe I buy my health insurance thru my wife's School policy's availability. Check what policies might be available for you thru all private as well as local governmental concerns.

@GMA Hey I'm the first person who is intrigued with suspense but I am fearful of heights, especially such heights as shown in the pictorial advertisement. So can I handle this documentary?

@Ireland0828 @mhvward @MollyRaePatric3 @PAngo329 @allypatauld @spokanetom @bwcjmc @MelodyGoetz @bc766 Assault rifles MUST be banned for public sale. Deer, squirrels and rabbits haven't a chance against someone with this rifle, so why do we want someone hunting humans with such a destructive weapon?
@RepAdamSchiff @khagar Thank you Representative Schiff. Sir you speak the word of all of America.

Why? Decisions and directions that he has made during his life has cost thousands or possibly millions of people a comfortable retirement in life!
@BernieSanders Bernie, your statements of current living costs, current Governmental Decisions and our Country's general direction are all what America requires and needs, yet what can retired individuals expect for a comfortable future?
@mayaharris_ @amjoyshow @KamalaHarris @JoyAnnReid Kamala's you are NOT addressing how retired individuals on a extremely limited income can deal with continued rising living costs.
@KamalaHarris Kamala's, I'm 68, retired on limited SS funds. I have not heard from you how you can handle the difficult economic difficulties that retired individuals suffer with.
@rainerickson @girlsreallyrule The Senator is correct. If all of the Republicans vote no, the bill to s dead.
@sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Senator Feinstein,		I have practiced the profession of Architecture since 1974. Senator, with all due respect, we ALL have to take a more concerned effort to limit the use of natural fossils for everyday use.
@SenKamalaHarris @Emolclause This man has certainly forgotten his history classes in high school. Trumps own great grandparents were immigrants. So, are we all to assume his daughter, granddaughters and future descendants, not obtain professional careers?
@SenWarren @12chicken @fred_guttenberg @NRA How many God fearing Americans feel Kavanaugh should be sitting on the Supreme Court? Supreme Court Judges should be elected NOT appointed.
@pkbmd @CREWcrew I agree JustSayin'. Also Russia keeps finding its way into Trump's vocabulary.
House Democrats introduce measure to revoke Trump's national emergency declaration https://t.co/CxciLWY7qK		We all believe in a safe place to raise a family, work in a vibrant economy and profess their beliefs in an after life. I DO support a wall, a wall around Trump Tower!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump has not listened to our Country's energy Advisers. He's always looking at investments for his company's welfare not the American public.
@TheRevAl Reverend , I had the pleasure to watch your interview this morning regarding injustice by Trump on Feb 22. Sir our Lord has blessed you with years of experience of injustice and a gift to  express the injustice to everyone in this Country.		Thank you 	Michael Schenck
@WritesTruths @vickihls @jack Stone should sell his home, hoc all his jewelry and sell his abhorrent clothes to good will.

@the_madcrawdad @AudreyOcean143 @MollyJongFast Hey Mike do you think Trump's "habit" is by his own design?
@GurlChef I'm sure Rand Mcnally has gotten the presses oiled and primed for the 100's of manuscripts that will require publication as soon as it is possible. McCabe himself may be spoken about in history classes like Washington is today.
@MeetThePress @benensonj Joel I hope you find yourself in front of National television more often. You are so correct, Democrats are NOT professing socialism, Democrats believe in justice for all not for just the major donors!
@MeetThePress @chucktodd Thank you Todd. You seem to have a very interesting take on our Country's political climate but more importantly your comments regarding Trump are always true to form.
@dakma5 Intriguing, obviously original, technologically enticing and I think enjoyable.

@MeetThePress Mr. President, many Americans look towards your leadership, your wisdom and experience to help better understand the problems which confront everyone from day to day. Your comments would certainly help lift our morale from the dismal "trumpian" life ways of today.
@dscc The Republican Party once garnered respect, a Governmental Party that gave this Country wise leadership with men like Lincoln or the first Roosevelt. This party is now on the verge of closing it's doors all due to two men; Trump and Putin.
So why not try to think like how our Lord taught us to live, to love and respect each other. You must be very content in living with your buddy in a house with an 	un-inviting entrance to anyone of color or of different ideas that differ from yours!

@DeadlineWH @FrankFigliuzzi1 @NicolleDWallace Thank you Frank. I hope a political group has eyes on you to hammer out a run for a National Political Role. Our Country needs someone with your "Law and Order" experience to guide us out of this Trumpian debacle of a Presidency.
@nytimes You sir are a hero!
How does a person with NO previous Governmental experience become President of the United States? His current performance in Governmental Decision Policy has proven very cumbersome. He needs to go!
@GOPLeader Sir you are demonstrating very reckless language, including ANY leadership skills you may posses by your attacks regarding anti-Semitic discussions in itself.
@DailyMirror This man needs years of physiological help.
@KamalaHarris @AlbaJeremy Kamala, good luck in South Carolina. We need your leadership, your honesty and your "vision" brought to the Deep South. 		My disabilities and income will not allow me to attend your mobilization. I hope your travels will eventually bring you to Lexington, KY. Again good luck.
@AlbaJeremy @KamalaHarris Thank you Jeremy. Rest assure I've already spoke to my wife and children regarding my personal backing in Kamala's political beliefs. Her statements coincide with my desire to end the Trumpian rhetoric we are currently suffering with.
@NightlyPolitics This man has serious problems in places of public restaurants. Someone should try to speak to or teach him how to live in public spaces.
@JackieSpeier @TeamPelosi @realDonaldTrump Though I'm a retired individual, my voice can still be heard. America's leadership must be brought back under capable hands. Hands that lead with as much heart as wisdom, with as much servitude and morality as conviction can allow.

@_SJPeace_ @reytenstiel I first watched this news blip on our local newscast. As I stated then, this gentleman who himself represents the wording in our constitution, should have a national sidewalk marker dedicated in his name set there in Washington, DC.

@AnaCabrera @rhondashane Ana, I'm not sure if this man was appointed any accolades or medals during his service during the Vietnam War, he certainly should receive an award today from all of us as we sit in our homes today. The fabric of our Freedoms have always depended upon men like him.

@electroboyusa @lfkraus @SpeakerPelosi @WisePaxCat @KapeciaResists @ellievan65 @ElastigirlVotes @tizzywoman @TrinityResists Whate is "yuge"?
@electroboyusa @lfkraus @SpeakerPelosi @WisePaxCat @KapeciaResists @ellievan65 @ElastigirlVotes @tizzywoman @TrinityResists Yes
@dkdkindub @thomaskaine5 Oh how I agree.
@senatemajldr Senator, again as a constituent of Kentucky and our Great Country the United States, why are you hiding? Stand up for us and open up our Government! You know Putin is so pleased that Trump is doing exactly what Russia wants. Is Trump Putin 's Puppet?
@hardball @billmaher I watched you Bill. I've missed seeing you. I can't afford HBO any longer. Both myself and my wife are living on meager retirement funds now. So it was nice to see you with Chris Matthews tonight.
@anthony_comella @senatemajldr And by the way Mr. Comella, I'm married to a women who was born and raised in Cleveland. She has 5 brothers and only one has decided to live and raise a family in Cleveland. 		I love Ohio, so please understand not everyone in Kentucky voted for Mitch.
@anthony_comella @senatemajldr Why do you think all Kentuckians voted for Mitch. I happen to be a registered Democrat living unfortunately in a red State. Kentucky is where I was born and it's a wonderful place to live. Unfortunately a lot of Republican farmland exists in Kentucky.
@Mantzarlis @GlennKesslerWP Very loving family. They certainly know how to treat one another. I wonder what they do for gift exchange at Christmas time.
@dscc Your site won't accept my response w.ithout a donation. I'm completely broke so I can't send a response. I agree with the 71,114 other Americans; Trump must reopen the Government.
@leftcoastbabe @RepMikeLevin @AdamParkhomenko Well about 535 miles. Plenty of distance to remain lost in.
Amy, I Michael Schenck, ask that this shutdown end as soon as possible. Thank you for your work towards this direction. https://t.co/IUoFMJs6Sw
@amyklobuchar Amy, I happen to live in Kentucky. I so wish that someday you may find a reason to find this great State your place of Governmental direction. I, a lifelong Democrat, support your direction in this abhorrent time during the "trumpian" closure of our Country.
@Eugene_Robinson Eugene I know your fan base is great. Please count me as one of your many. I love your commentaries on MSNBC. I hope to see you on many episodes to come.		Michael Schenck 	Lexington, Kentucky
@senatemajldr Mr. McConnell, you must not unilaterally agree with Trump's decisions! Sir I live in Kentucky. You are my elected Senator. I'm extremely disappointed with your statement. This Shutdown must end. Putin is receiving his exact direction!
@rickwtyler @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Rick I so agree with your assessment of Trump and what he should do with the shutdown. Trump should accept "failure of the wall and move on."
@DanRather @AgentHillResist Sir I so much agree with you. I believe this man is in total dependence to Putin.
@thehill This man, and I also think Putin, are trying to drive this Country into a recession. I feel sorry for the people who currently hurting with his insane action to close Government.
@robbwebb1 @kasie @AliVelshi @MSNBC And I also not only extend my thanks to Kasie, I also want to thank you Robb for your salutation.
@AdamSchiff So Congressman Schiff, I oppose this shutdown. Trump is acting like a boy under the influence of his father, Vladimir Putin! Thousands, if not millions of people are under sever financial difficulty. TRUMP MUST END THIS SHUTDOWN !
@AdamSchiff I have to limit the costs I can spend. I have several times tried to respond to this survey unsuccessfully because a donation is required. Upon completion of the survey I'm asked for a donation which I cannot afford and the completed survey fails to send.
@ProudResister @PennelopeLouise @realDonaldTrump Trump the boy, certainly doesn't understand how a government WORKS, well at least the American Government. 		Open the Government!!! Why do Americans have to suffer because of this stupid bigotry! 		What do you have to prove? What do you think your mother thinks of this suffering?
@MichaelSteele @CapehartJ Hey Michael I had similar moves too! I happen to be 68, a little bit older than you and also a caucasian. I always though found myself dancing with my Afro friends and my name is also Michael. So the world is smaller and closer as it should be; as God intended.
@RepBarbaraLee I now fear for my future Social Security Reimbursements which might also be in jeopardy. I, as many more Americans contributed to the fund their entire life. It is my only source of income.		Trump has lived on gifts his whole life. I really do now believe he's indebted to Putin!
@replucymcbath Lucy I hope you now extend your sponsorship to all of the United States.
@neal_katyal Neal, I trust people like you, individuals of high caliber will pursue the special counsel decisions. And the United States Citizens along with the General Public in whole all await in high anticipation Mueller's report.
@johnupton Second this atrocity, if the act is true, aligns itself with the stupidity that the "shutdown" itself presents.
@johnupton I was never aware of such of a unique park until now during this shutdown. Obviously I think TWO horrible atrocities are in place with this story. First the individuals who perform this banned activity are of limited intelligence and;
@SRuhle @MSNBC @GeoffRBennett @JuliaEAinsley @Yamiche @RyanCostello @BasilSmikleJr @TammyLeitnerNBC @alivitali @GarrettHaake @glennkirschner2 @ByBrianBennett Stephanie, I always watch your broadcast. Your 	questioning, your interrogations and your own personal beliefs of the unique morning's news align with my own opinions. Thank you again for your continued operations.
@burgessev Hmmm?
@ABCPolitics @Havemercy_2 So I guess the current living previous Presidents must have been "taken over by drugs" since they also ignore the "drug problem" at the southern border. I wonder how he's going to curtail shipments of drugs by sea and air?
@BillKristol Bill, gosh I hope your right. This shut down has gone on way too long. Trump should have NEVER ordered this action. This procedure has created severe unsafe problems throughout the United States.
@UGM_Rock @PodcasterMG @jordananye @SceneCreep @UndergroundMikz Nice.
@KamalaHarris So Kamala how can a shutdown and the constricted flow of funds improve our economy?
@KamalaHarris Hey, I voted Red one time and only one time way back in 1969. That year I turned 18. Wow I could vote, but also be drafted. My draft number was 19. I was going to Vietnam! So I voted for tricky Dicky! Oh he ended the war, like 4 years too late!!!
@KamalaHarris Senator Harris, this shutdown hurts all of America. Our economy involves the free flow of individual income. This "shutdown" is constricting our economy. I fear a recession which may result from the constriction of the flow of funds from 800,000 individuals.
@SpeakerPelosi @santarchy @SenSchumer Thank you Senators Pelosi and Schumer. I agree with both your "decrees". As you both have stated and implied, America provides a land to live and profess ones faith free from Governmental control. One which welcomes foreign individuals from tyranny not a 30' high wall!
@RBReich @Cruellaisdevine Sir you are so very right. Not only did an employer violate the law, if it continued to fail in paying it's employees more than three consecutive times the business may be forced to close it's operation.
@halilikTR This shot will never leave the air waves. We all know a parents love  and especially a mothers protection!!!
@New2018World Thank you Madam Secretary. I too am proud to say I'm a liberal. We all look forward towards your progressive and honest leadership.
@NBCNightlyNews @NBCInvestigates @annenbcnews Why? How many times will they cite R&amp;D !
@LouDobbs @Jabbadaddy2016 Most of this Country are aware that very few people now smuggle drugs or people thru our Mexican southern  border. This man borders on hyperactive irrationalism. Our Country should seriously and medically look at his mental ability to hold this most powerful position on earth.
@Nativeesoul I say a 8
@DanaScottLO @ElastigirlVotes @SenSchumer Yes, he must be getting coaching lessons from his private cellphone line early in the morning from someone he admires across the waters far, far away.
@kylegriffin1 Kyle have you personally ever met or seen anyone more pretentious and conceited who thinks he's smarter than anyone else in the contemporary world!
@KentuckySports @heraldleader I've been a staunch UK fan since 1969. While playing ball at UK, Scot Padgett provided such an honest and likable student decorum he quickly became the spokesman for the entire team during his entire tenure at School. I find it hard to understand this "dust-up" involving Scott.
@i_iove_nature @chrisvader316 Just amazing and also so wonderful to be able to see God's design's work with everyday life.

@catwoman1351 @realDonaldTrump Thank you Sharon. I'm so glad to see some rational thinking in Hollywood.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi congratulations. I enjoyed your acceptance speech this past evening, this January the 3rd. With children, including your own grandchildren, stand with you during your acceptance ceremony certainly portrayed our Founding Fathers original concept of our Constitution.

@RepAdamSchiff Sir, I'm certain that Eugene Robinson with the Washington Post would love to assist with your efforts investigating any/all individuals involved with leaks within the White House.
@MirrorTech @DailyMirror Doesn't the moon rotate also?
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator, I like you a lifelong Democrat, have admired President's Bush life committed to the betterment of all America. He indeed was a man that this Country so desperately needed today as well as for tomorrow.
@AmyAdamsNet Amy, obviously your an amazing actress. I like so many other fans await your next role to hit the screens. I know your craft requires a tremendous amount of work and I wish you support and continued strength for all upcoming roles.
@BruceFeldmanCFB @wildcatnews Well the SEC had as many wins as all of the schools that Conference USA were invited to bowl games. And there are two more SEC teams that haven't yet played in their bowl game so Hold On!

My son and daughter-in-law have now completed a safe journey to our house. The bird is in the oven and our feast will begin soon.
@BillKristol @serark Bill, Trump keeps sticking both of his feet, both of his hands as well as his mouth out in the wind of honesty and he quickly finds the majority is now understanding that he lies. His lies are also now more obvious and predictable each and every day.
@SEC @iamnickrichards @H23Ash @UKAthletics @KentuckyMBB Ashton you look like you thoroughly enjoy your selection to wear our Widcat Blue. Our color and our name "Wildcats" are known not only across the United States but more notability, the World! We all are so glad your decision to play ball at the college level was at Kentucky.
@CNNnewsroom @SenatorCardin I agree with every word Senator Cardin has stated in this interview. Trump wanted a shutdown to lay blame on the Democratic Party and strengthen his ties to the die hard Republican leaders. His political life is dependent on confusions and chaotic times which he is creating.
@CBSThisMorning @senator_cardin @NorahODonnell I voted for President Bush for his first term as President. Once his promises seamed to be merely political maneuvering after taxes were raised, I changed my political alliance. I now believe Mr. Bush may have been this Country's most astute contemporary Leader in my lifetime.
@Princezolu @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump No Trump's interests lie with the interest of the dollar.
@1IronMan2018 @2HawkEye2018 General Mccafery, sir I ask for your personal help thru this Country's dire need of Governmental direction. May you please assemble the most qualified individuals who may correct the downward spiral that our Freedom Bell is currently experiencing.
@realDonaldTrump Can't you recall your very own statement yesterday regarding the shutdown. Is it possible that you may be suffering a bit with memory lapse?

I happen to be a few years older than you but your work fills my heart with honesty and facts.
@ABCPolitics Thank goodness to the Rule of Law in the United States of America. Prosecution must, no is required to carry itself straight to the Top.
@ProudResister Ryan I reall admire you and your brother. I always look forward to your comments, satir, and general remarks down grading our current President and his Administration. Sir you do define the concept of a Proud Resister.
@RepTimRyan Tim I live in Kentucky. I married a women born and raised in Cleveland. One of her brothers still resides there near Cleveland. Sir I feel you have a long and fortuitous life ahead of you. Sir keep your campaign life alive and well.
@RepTimRyan Congressman I certainly agree with you. It so nice to see a Democrat in a supposedly red State speak with his whole heart which rhymes with my heartfelt feelings also. Thank you for your lambasting of the House today. From another Democrat living in a red state.
@RollingStone Everyone must know that this man, this General, this person of Scripture carries more honesty in one of his shoelaces than Trump can ever muster in his entire life. Trump must not believe in an after life or he's already sold his soul to the deep dark pits.
@Eugene_Robinson @Cubfan1324 Geez, she must think, or Trump maybe, believe that this decision was in the best interest of the local government. Each day it appears to this old body Putin is now making decisions for the White House.
@KellyO @senatemajldr Kelly, and to all of your followers, Secretary Mattis provided a sense of decorum and certainly a knowledgable degree to the ways and means for the defense of American beliefs and standards world wide.
@BaltRevolution @SenDuckworth Sir, oh how I so agree with your thought process. In all of my 67 years of existence, I question now how we, the United States of America, have let such a devious, lying and cowardly person become the leader of the Free World!
@NBCNews Certainly the whole Country, in fact, the whole World awaits his report. I personally await for the beginning of my total belief in righteousness, in what America Must stand for and that All crooked, deceitful people must pay for their crimes.
@NatashaBertrand Hey Natasha I agree with your pronoun "What", regarding how the Russians were monitoring our Countries sensitive email transmissions. I would change the verbiage a little "What the Hell"!!!!		What else can shock this nation, except what Mueller's final report will contain.
@VanJones68 @CNNTonight @cut_50 Van Jones thank you for this noteworthy update to all Americans. More importantly I thank you for my Grandchildren. America must start thinking towards the future, for our grandchildren and their children.
@Voize_of_Reazon I have no doubt that the Trump family has deep financial ties to the head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin.
@Voize_of_Reazon Jeannie King has scratched the top of the nail that we all hope someday, and hopefully that day comes soon, which will start closing the top of Trump's Presidency. We all need to contact our Senators to begin the process of Impeachment!

@aravosis @anncsborne @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Hey John, rest assured I happen to be a Democrat straight thru my whole life, yet I find your working equations somewhat hard to believe. If your right certainly Ms Huckabee's salary should be called to the taxpayers attention immediately.

@Htygrett1 @ProudResister @GOP What a picture! I compliment the photographer, or should I say the Dreamer?
@thehill Great, corruption must always receive flames of justice.
@Newsweek Michael Flynn, because of his 33 year history with the Federal Government, knew that lying to the FBI carried  serious consequences. Flnn should receive the maximum penalty due under law.
@CNNPolitics To everyone, I'm currently watching "Out of Many, One, the Immigrant's Story". Trump should certainly watch this short true documentary telecasted by Netflix. I was born here in the United States and this film has sworn my allegiance to this Country once again.
@Wolv_2018 I wonder if Manafort will try to start a savings and loan esquire while serving his time in prison. He could possibly get Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos and even the top dog himself make "in kind" contributions toward lame duck justice accounts.
@jacobsoboroff @NatCookResists Jacob this Administration should somehow try to pay homage to this little girl, her family and the entire party they were traveling with. What is wrong with Trump? He must think his ancestors were born on the Hudson or did they also migrate to this Land!
@latimes It all smells like a cover up that's far from convincing.
@AliVelshi Ali, I watch your NEWSCASTS each workday every week. Now regarding today's newscast regarding individuals lying about contacts with Russia. Ali would you not also lie regarding communication with Russia if your children's life depended upon your silence!
@sahilkapur @brendalee1313 It must now seem to every American that the deficit will survive with all Americans long to come. I'm a Grandfather of 6 beautiful children and I pray my children will welcome more to this world. Trump will not survive past 2020, and hopefully his current term will end sooner.
@Voize_of_Reazon Oh, how I so extremely agree Mr. Reazon. Cohen, who shared the same floor of trump tower, basically listened to trump rant and rave about Obama, Obama's beautiful Administration and how the Country was operating so well.
@chrislhayes Chris I have begged everyone who publishes a derogatory story regarding this current Administration to come back with any sort of a solution to help correct our troubling state of affairs.
@McFaul @KatyTurNBC Congratulations Katy from someone you obviously don't know. Pray he is born as beautiful as you and without any problems. One of my grandchildren, who happens to be 10 now, was born suffering with autism. He is loved by everyone and is a joy to be with.
@Amy_Siskind @anncsborne Geez Amy what can I do? My Senator is everyone's friend, Mitch McConnell. I'm 67 and somewhat disabled. All I can do is speak to friends, family and anyone who will listen that this current Administration is sending America's Policies and Freedoms down the Toilet!!
@danielsgoldman Daniel I believe your poignant comments on MSNBC are a required staple to my morning life just as important as my bowl of wheaties.
What has the president been ‘smocking’? https://t.co/ywf70iR9J7		Thank you Eugene. Your writings and poignant commentaries on MSNBC have both made my days certainly more enjoyable as well as enlightened during the "Trumpian" days of the White House.
@WMM_podcast @audible_com I, a Democrat, have fallen in love for 41, for his principals and his total Dedication to our Country. I know he now once again holds his hands with the mother of the United States, Barbara. I pray a couple like the Bushes can once again find their residence in the White House.
@Acosta Jim does Trump acknowledge you during any Q&amp;A sessions now?
@DeadlineWH @MichaelSteele @NicolleDWallace Michael, oh how I enjoy your analogy of the political climate now burning in Washington. As the "trumpian" period begins to disintegrate our great grandchildren will all ask how you, me and all of our loved ones were able to survive during this current meltdown.
@maggieNYT He must feel a bit wheezy right now.
@ProudResister Thank you Ryan. Man your a news forecaster for all of the web casters of today.

@MaddowBlog @MSNBC Rachel why or how can the United States Government pay a lifetime annuity to Flynn for his military service, a person who has conspired with one of America's most devious opponent, Russia. I feel his lifetime "annuity" should be served within a 6x8 foot cell!
@Newsweek Why were the cats being sent to this slaughterhouse? Do people in China consume cat meat?
@TBro_6and12 @DrDenaGrayson @SRuhle @GOP Oh, I certainly agree with you Tom. How can the Party of Abraham Lincoln sink to the mud hole where the Party Leaders breathe one lie upon another false truth. I feel someday a word "trump" will be redefined as "evil, one without morality or truthfulness".
@RepMikeQuigley @CNNnewsroom Thank you Mike. I watched you this morning on CNN. Two of my children and their families live in Chicago. Your comments regarding the current Administration in Washington is heard and appreciated across America.
@comboverwhelmed Hey thank you. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Senator Blumenthal. I feel he has repeatedly put himself in front of a shooting gallery to present the true meaning of our Democracy. I look forward to when the Democrats moving into the House, including the White House.
@FrankFigliuzzi1 @MSNBC Oh how I personally hope so Frank. After the release of last Friday's partial Investigative information Americans must now believe Russia has tried to take control of our Democracy.
@comboverwhelmed Thanks. Do you know who "the Dick" refers to?
@joncoopertweets Thank you Jon. I've been stating your same comment for several weeks. If I'm correctly informed Article II Section 4 of our Constitutional Standards states that the President and/or Vice President shall be removed from office upon conviction of Treason, Bribery.
@jdillon05 @Kentuckyweather Well Jeremy are we expecting a white Christmas this year?
@RepAdamSchiff Flynn has forfeited his lifetime Governmental retirement benefits. While employed with the United States Government he conspired with a Foreign adversary, Russia, all to enrich himself personally. He should be serving a lifetime benefit behind bars in prison.
@comboverwhelmed What is this man speaking of?
@KamalaHarris Senator I was born in 1951. My father served in WWII. During my early childhood I was taught the meaning of devotion, servitude and love for our country. I feel the current Administration fails with all beliefs I hold true. I look to your Senatorial direction.
@SenWarren @DHSgov Senator, our Country must somehow stand up and show the World that we still can help people who have lost everything and who are seeking safety within our borders. I still believe we are a land of the free and must Pledge our Allegiance to all who seek shelter.
@davidhogg111 @cowgirlup1a David I happen to be 67 years old and soon I'll turn 68. David I still can remember my times while I spoke my Democratic views and lived a life of trust and hope. I admire your work and certainly wish you success with your endeavors.		Michael Schenck
@MichelleObama Michelle you, like your husband, have demonstrated what a God Fearing, loving life educated to believe in each other has meant to so many people of the world. Thank you for your examples to all young people that dreams can be achieved by faith and hard work.

@Lawrence @TheLastWord Lawrence please advise your audience this evening (Friday) the process to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. I base this question on today's public proceedings of Cohen's investigation.

@TheLastWord It's finally being correctly noted that Nobody is above the law.
@UKFootball Wow. We are so proud of you Coach. I Graduated from UK with a 5 year degree in 1974. I have seen very little excitement with our gridiron Wildcats during all of those years until you began sewing your building blocks. Thanks Coach, we are all so excited for all to come.
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you Senator. As the years continue to pass many people begin to forget or even are not aware of why we entered into this World War.
@leesarhoden Oh we can only pray somehow this Country can provide someone with his intelligence, fortitude, and love of our Country as he showed in his 8 years of service. I again question if Joe Biden might be elected as our next President and he name Obama his Vice-President.
@SenBlumenthal Sir we must perform a "Full" investigation. Also America trusts in your skill and direction to uncover all improprieties.
@GOP I happen to be 67 years old, born 6 years after the surrender of Japan ending WWII. My father served in the Navy, in the Pacific Division, during WWII. My childhood was filled with stories, battles and general disgust for the Japanese Government and their Navy.
