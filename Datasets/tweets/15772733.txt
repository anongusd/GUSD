@ananavarro The only way Dems are going to win is with a clear vision of core principles, and convincing indies that this vision is the best one. Not by watering down principles. Notice how Republicans don't water-down their beliefs to reach left-leaning indies.

@sebastian_byron True, the app-based notifications are a great way to keep people informed. Not sure how it funds the news companies but it might be a good start.
@sebastian_byron I think you're right, though if they click through to those stories and hit a paywall - they likely go back to scrolling the newsfeed. The consequence is that readers are less informed and publications don't get any clicks. There's got to be a solution in there somewhere.
I'll finish this thread by looping back to my first tweet - check out @JackCraver's article on the State of the @Statesman /end	  https://t.co/ArCJll2jdI
Is this news industry in part hamstrung by outdated business models as much as it is by new economic landscapes? I don't know, but it's an important dialogue for us to have. /7
One of the problems real news has competing with "fake news" is that fake news is free while real news is parked behind paywalls. I realize these papers need to exist, but also realize that most consumers can't/won't pay for subscriptions to more than one or two papers. /6
In a world where @netflix, @Spotify, and @AppleMusic have carved out niches in their various sectors, why can't there be a similar subscription service for news that isn't limited to one publication? /5
The non-profit route seems to be a viable option for media, specifically online- only productions that emphasize social and video. But there are limits here, too, as most markets will reach saturation among donors at some point. Which leads me to my main point... /4
Some news entities have found a way to adapt, stay solvent, and still provide a service - most notably @evanasmith's successful @TexasTribune. But we can also look at @NPR and @KUT as models that have worked for a while now. /3
The for-profit model of news is not viable anymore. And not just due to a lack of advertisers, but also due to the high expense associated with operations. But this reality has hit other businesses as well, in particular retail. /2
I just finished reading @JackCraver's excellent piece on the state of the @statesman, which presents a gratuitous opportunity for me to share my own thoughts on the state of the media. Here's a short thread... /1

@jneutron1969 @EricaGrieder I agree, yet there are hoards of Republican voters who love it only because he channels their emotions. So while many candidates won’t be able to pull it off, it doesn’t mean they won’t *try* to. Thus my thought that they are in the woods either way.
@daveweigel Remember when that Republican congressman from Montana punched a reporter? No one else does either! That was all the way back in May of 2017, man. We were so young.
@jneutron1969 @EricaGrieder If he survives in any form, then he’s a GOP role model to copy. If he goes down, we get a GOP civil war over whether or not to change course or (if they blame Dems) to stay the course. Either way - the future is in the woods.

Ultimately, this isn't an ideological argument, it's a values argument - and values are what most Americans will get behind. /end
Here's the thing - moderation is dead because no one wants a candidate who waters down all of their positions to try and win votes from all people, they'll get votes from nowhere. We need to re-think moderation in terms of pragmatism - how can we fight for what we believe in.
He suggests we look at the moderates who won in 2018, which I agree is a good case study. Many of them ran on access to healthcare and public education and guess what - those are considered progressive issues. It is possible for something to be progressive and mainstream.
McAuliffe writes about the risk: "the stakes are another four years of Trump degrading our country." I agree, but the Governor's prescription appears to be for Dems to tell people what can't be done instead of telling people what we believe in. That's also a risk.
We can take the words of James Carville, "Don't complicate the simple," and update it to "don't complicate the message."
McAullife's call for a "more realistic alternative sounds like Mondale's "I'll raise your taxes" speech. Most voters don't have time to keep up with specifics of legislation, but they know what they believe and they want someone to fight for it.
I agree w/ McAuliffe that we can't simply play negative but do need to draw and contrast. In other words: when they go low, we go high and low.
I'm normally a fan of @TerryMcAuliffe, but his latest Op-Ed essentially states that Democrats need to ditch values messaging and embrace realistic messaging. Which is a perfect example of why Democrats need help with all messaging. https://t.co/nBRk7Pqg96
@elreyalto What I'm getting at here is that too often people are using the term "biweekly" to refer to things that happen every two weeks. That's not what biweekly means!

@JackCraver @SomewhereinATX @DanKeshet I’ve been focused on a class today, so to clarify my previous comment on this matter - I agree with your post. Those who were wary of single member districts didn’t have a great system among the at-large to begin with.
@JackCraver @SomewhereinATX @DanKeshet I read it
We cannot be transformative if we only talk to like-minded people. We have to prepare to converse with others. Not in battle, but in discovery of how interpretation changes on the subject of race...that we are challenged to listen to those with different perspectives.
We need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. “All of this racism but nobody’s racist.” How does it exist in each of us, how does our racism take place?
Reality vs. telling a colorblind story: https://t.co/O9GbPqyuo4
To say “we talk about race too much” is to say “you talk about race more than I’m comfortable with it.” If we’re not noticing, we’re not noticing what’s all around us: https://t.co/j88CfkaVMj
To say we are a colorblind society is to sanitize our history, it ignores racial inequity. We should not ask “do we have racial disparity” and instead ask “why do we have it?”
We often blame inequality on poverty and economics - we do this because we take econ classes and not race classes. But data shows that we have a racial gap at every income level, and within income levels: https://t.co/blpxwSeKW4
When it comes to race, we don’t have the same perspective because we don’t have the same experiences.
I’ll be tweeting some notes from @Lead_Austin’s class on race today. Our session is led by @courageousdove. I’ll thread updates here.

Age is a better predictor of voting behavior than national origin, @pbump, so the question shouldn't be "Did you move to Texas?" but rather "WHEN did you move to Texas?" Every other piece of data suggests you'll get a starkly different result. /end https://t.co/8sSlfw5anf
People moving to Texas are mostly younger (under 50) and almost entirely heading to the urban areas. Both young voters and urban areas are blue and getting bluer. The suburbs are also moving towards Democrats. /3
An 80-year-old voter who moved to Texas in the 1960's could be included in the "not from Texas" group, but it would also not be surprising for that person to vote for Cruz. Age, ethnicity, and the urban/rural split are better predictors of someone's voting preferences. /2

On a personal note, I'm very proud of @PaigeForAustin for her first place finish in Austin City Council District 8 last night. Don't call it a comeback! This one was well earned. Now let's finish what we've started. :)
Democracy is like a muscle - you have to exercise it to keep it healthy.		And that's why last night's election shouldn't be the end of your civic exercises! It's not about the wave, it's about the work. And to build a stronger and more inclusive Texas, our work continues. /end
Elections are not the beginning or the end of politics, but rather they are a part of a process that includes legislative advocacy, activism, and more.
But consider this - when somebody votes once, they are highly likely to vote again. And Texas has a whole mess of new voters that Democrats can go back to in the coming months and years.
And while turnout was higher (esp. for a Texas midterm), we still have work to do - relative to voting age population, we're still a low voting state.
Democrats also flipped Williamson County (another Austin suburb) and Tarrant County (Fort Worth). As far as Texas counties go, flipping Tarrant is akin to flipping Arizona or Missouri in the electoral college.
Good morning from Texas. A few thoughts as the dust settles this morning:		- Democrats picked up 12 seats in the legislature.		- 2 more seats in the State Senate.		- An important county executive position in Harris County/Houston, as well as Hays County (an Austin suburb).

@swimsaturdays Austin is the county seat of Travis County - so, very blue.
Travis County/Austin turned out 372,388 votes during the Early Vote period this year. That’s 200 more than during the Early Vote period in 2016.

@wyethwire That's true, early vote has climbed as a portion of the total vote almost every year in Texas for the past few election cycles. However, turnout is already at record levels again today so it's likely up across the board - but we won't know for sure until it's all over.
@GeoBfield Right, I offered a clarification in another tweet based on your reply - thank you for your comment! My point is that only those who are over the age of 65 are allowed to vote by mail without an excuse in Texas. Everyone else needs a justification, which doesn't make sense.
@GrizzlyMan901 @WalshFreedom My concern with making Election Day a national holiday is that many people might take Monday off and make it a long weekend w/o voting. Much in the way that people do not go to the cemetery on Memorial Day or honor the Labor movement on Labor Day.
@WalshFreedom These campaigns go on for more than a year, the debate is concluded. The only thing left is surprise attacks that opponents cannot respond to, which isn't really a service to the voters (especially when the attacks tend to be embellishments).

Clarification: Texas offers no excuse vote-by-mail for people age 65+, but requires a justification for anyone else who wants to exercise that method of voting. It’s a different standard that doesn’t seem to be rooted in fair election law.
Question for election lawyers: Texas only allows absentee voting for voters who age 65 or older.		How is it legal to offer an expanded method of voting for one class of citizens but not for others? https://t.co/srkSGAJJmJ
Thoughts on that NBC story about Early Vote favoring Republicans:		1- The team that produced the data disagrees w/ NBC's conclusion (see previous RT).  2- NBC posted data at 10am on 10/22 thus NO early vote tallies! Only mail ballots, generally reserved for TX voters aged 65+.

@trowaman @cd_hooks Turnout was still 5% overall in this election. There were 40,000 votes cast in the Dem primary in 2016, which was not really competitive even at the statewide level. But it might help to have Hillary and/or Obama to spend some time in San Antonio before November 6th.
@cd_hooks Here’s the problem- today’s turnout was low, and rural counties supporting Flores are arguably not Latino (I don’t know the demos, I’m assuming). The likely voters in today’s poll are based on 2014, which was the lowest turnout in a decade. These numbers aren’t representative.

Ok I'm being told by the teachers unions that they don't think there were enough votes to create this swing
The UT-TT poll called every race w/ accuracy except Rep LG, where ed. groups encouraged crossovers. The poll said 88/12 but vote was 76/24. The "block vote" may have put 185k D  votes into R primary. Otherwise final tallies might’ve been R 1.35 mil, D 1.285 mil #texasprimaries
@eramshaw The TT/UT poll was correct in all of it's predictions except the LG race. This is too important not to noice.
@eramshaw Check this out: The TT/UT poll showed Dan Patrick winning 88/12, but an organized effort by ed. groups had some Dems crossover to vote against him creating a margin of 76/24 - an increase of 185k voters. If those voters didn't cross it would have been R 1.35 mil and D 1.285 mil.

Thoughts on the #TexasPrimaries:		D turnout of 1.1 mil = up more than 100% from 510k in 2014.		R turnout of 1.54 mil = up 14% from 1.33 mil in 2014. 		Dems broke record for primary turnout by 35 votes.		Early Vote was 47% of the total vote for Dems.		Still lots of work to do.

This year there are 5, only 1 has 3 candidates campaigning. Compared to other counties seeing a ton of candidates, this could be why Cameron is the outlier.

Final thought: Electoral data from 2004 to 2016 shows that Texas Democrats have been steadily improving while Republicans have been standing still. If Democrats can get over the hump in a midterm, and 2018 is looking good, then Texas R’s have reason to worry.
@86thLegislature @GOP Do you think businesses feel that a Dan Patrick-led party is still a business-oriented GOP? Not trolling here, genuinely curious if you think the last session was hurtful to the brand.
@86thLegislature Gracias - and a very happy Boxing Day to you (I'm so glad that we can say that again).
Thus it's more accurate to say that Trump did not under perform in Texas - when he did exactly what he was he was supposed to do - but that Texas Democrats over performed by expanding the electorate. 3/3 #txlege https://t.co/wevGTeHMrX
While it's true that his margin was smaller than that of previous Republican presidential candidates, it is also true that he received roughly the number of raw votes that he was supposed to get. In fact, he received more votes than any Republican in Texas history. 2/3

@Pinboard So again, yes, it's important to give early and to support your people. On that we 100% agree. But the reason is more so because DC Democrats rarely have their act together this early on.
@Pinboard It's true that candidates can raise money now, but a quick scan of the Green Pages shows that most states haven't closed filing yet which means candidate fields are not set yet: https://t.co/9jklW1NerJ
@Pinboard Anyone who has worked at a DC political committee (I'm one of them) will tell you that landscape memos come from input among many, many people and issue groups, and generally happen after a primary. Nothing along the lines of an "intern with a spreadsheet."
@Pinboard So yes, early money is important, but it's important for a different reason: because the grassroots have a stronger voice right now. You, too, can pick winners instead of following them.
@Pinboard Institutional money, the standard lobbyist PACs, is like horse racing in that "the smart money breaks late." But early money? Those are the issue-groups working to push their candidates forward. Enviro, Repro rights, unions. These groups don't follow leaders - they make leaders.

@JohnDonisi @rgratcliffe Right. As I wrote, the reason is different. But the ensuing predicament is the same, in that they both could’ve impacted the validity of an eventual party nomination- which is the topic at hand.

@rgratcliffe Ultimately the TCDP resolved it by suing everyone, and a courts decided to leave everyone on the ballot. And then a third candidate won anyway (Margaret Moore, who is now the DA). Here’s the story of the initial predicament: https://t.co/Sr8bB0nAWn
@rgratcliffe Travis County case was a candidate who didn’t qualify for the ballot due to a lack of valid sigs, but was eventually allowed on and so a primary opponent sued. The problem would have been: what if the primary winner is later disqualified? R would have run unopposed in general.
@rgratcliffe I believe the Travis County Democratic Party had to deal with something similar in the 2016 primary for District Attorney.

@HCookAustin Yeah that is a very specific way to save $2k he just outlined lol
@johnegibson @EricaGrieder That's true. And I do agree the pragmatic approach is normally to build coalitions, though I think our current state of politics relies on running up the score with the base. Gerrymandering, I tell ya.
@johnegibson @EricaGrieder You can’t win on persuadables alone, they need to be layered on top of a solid base. So then... Perhaps it’s the 1-2% that needs to grow up to realize the strength of their vote relies on the strength of a strong base vote.
@johnegibson @EricaGrieder So then equivocate on your positions to win over 1-2% and erode a substantial portion of your base?

@v2aggie2 @EricaGrieder More... https://t.co/q3o0klr9Xi
@v2aggie2 @EricaGrieder Republicans have had an advantage, for sure. But their vote isn’t growing. In prez elections since 2004, R’s have grown by 150,000 voters whereas Dems have grown by 1,000,000. Yes, a favorable environment can change that in a midterm - and 2018 is looking very favorable.
@v2aggie2 @EricaGrieder Those 15-20 point gaps are skewed by low Dem voter turnout (and two Republican wave elections).

@EricaGrieder @sooner930 “I was young, I needed the money!”
@sooner930 @EricaGrieder I hear ya, man. Little-known fact: I myself am a recovering Republican.
@EricaGrieder Consider this: if they exist in meaningful numbers, then what's stopping them from crossing over? I would say that notion more than anything else results in it being less about bashing them and more about giving up on them.
@sooner930 @EricaGrieder Ok - May have been more accurate to say “virtually non-existent.” Come on over there’s plenty of room in the big tent!
@EricaGrieder The responses in this thread is a perfect example of why Dems need to stop trying to win "Republican crossover votes." Because they don't exist. Also - laughable that R's calls Dems extreme lol
@ImaPaleoVegan @EricaGrieder The same GOP that passed a "show me your papers" law? Called ICE on Latinx protestors (without knowing their legal status)?

The political world and the electorate are very different  now than they were in 2014. Oh and Trump is underwater in Texas.
A poll going around today is based on a likely voter screen that is 75% based on those who voted in 2014. What? Yeah, dumb.
Texas midterm elections are a different animal - While 2016 was the highest turnout in history, 2014 was the lowest.
One problem: it's difficult to poll new voters. They don't always make it through a pollsters "likely voter" screen in a meaningful way.
The notion that Clinton did well in Texas due to Trump crossovers is NOT supported by data.
Over the past 10 years, the TX Republican vote has been stagnant while Dems have picked up a million votes. https://t.co/V4m0eosOYW
What this means: there are two sleeping giants. The Latino one, and the Transient one. And the Transient one appears to be waking up.
Of that 1.8 million, voter file suggests 500k are Latino. The rest may be explosive growth - people who just moved to TX.

@bushnellmike @cd_hooks Probably not very many - but that's not the angle of the story.
@cd_hooks City Council races in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are regularly contested with Dems in the race.
@cd_hooks Also worth noting: the @texasdemocrats Project LIFT that played in 33 local races since Jan. (state parties usually play in state &amp; fed).
@cd_hooks Worth noting: many run for Congress because most people can't leave a job for five months every other year, and live off of $7,600.
@cd_hooks "The nationalization of politics sucks" would actually be a better headline, given the numerous holes in your story.
@sethdmichaels @cd_hooks The author complains about a lack of local organizing then omits that the State Party has played in 33 local races since January.

@SpryGuy @JasStanford To sum this all up: my exact point is not the issues, it's how we message the issues.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford As @GeorgeLakoff eloquently states, people are not rational - they are emotional. Strong messages should strike emotional chords.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford And I get that "Better Deal" contrasts with "Art of the Deal" and is a call back to the New Deal. But still, no thanks.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford "Better Deal" implies we're getting a deal at all, at a time when people are sick of "deals" in general. It lacks emotion.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford No he doesn't. Nothing on voting rights, foreign policy, enviro, ACA. But my point is the weak message, how we sell it.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford I agree with all of those issues - and even in the form of a list they are a better message than "better deal."
RT @chrislhayes: What the hell is "skinny repeal"? NO ONE KNOWS BECAUSE IT WAS INVENTED TODAY, THE DAY THEY'RE VOTING https://t.co/mtTKzq33…
@SpryGuy @JasStanford My entire rant, the one you replied to, is solely against the "Better Deal" framework (Whereas I liked "Stronger Together").
@SpryGuy @JasStanford Being against bad guys isn't enough. If it was, we wouldn't be in this situation. We need proactive messages that resonate w/ our voters.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford I'm listening, but I don't like what I'm currently hearing.
@SpryGuy @JasStanford I'm critical of Dems for not having a message to fight the exact thing you describe.
DC is a Dumpster Fire and instead of riding in on a fire truck of hope we're giving the world the Pontiac Aztec.
Midterms are a game of bases and we've got overly focused group messaging meant to appeal to the middle. There's no middle in a midterm.
Schumer also doesn't mention debt, college or otherwise. No mention of attacks on rights (voting, abortion, immigrant, or otherwise).
And while Chuck Schumer's Op-Ed in yesterday's @NYTimes mentions prescription drugs/ Medicare - it shies away from defending the ACA.
It's so blatantly processed that it's akin to canned meat at a time when the voters want something real.

@cd_hooks all said it's a good subject - but the criticism was premature. The resistance in 2017 is swifter than the one in 09.
@cd_hooks good point, but also emphasizes mine- why hit the left for not having a movement in Dec? Tea Party didn't mobilize until April 09.
@cd_hooks AFP and Freedomworks played a major in creating the movement, that is significant in leading to a drumbeat.
.@cd_hooks thanks for the replies, Chris- I appreciate it. I certainly wasn't angling for my group in those tweets (we focus on media).

@cd_hooks you're saying Dems don't have a movement, yet this activity happened in January. Tea Party movement got going in ...April.
@cd_hooks for anyone who is curious what I'm talking about, here's the story in question: https://t.co/j0QIWHxopP
@cd_hooks maybe I'm wrong but I just feel like there are a lot of holes in your story, Chris.
@cd_hooks my organization has seen more grassroots involvement than ever. One event for 50 people - has more than 1,000 people interested.
@cd_hooks not sure if you know this but the @ACLU broke major fundraising records last week.
@cd_hooks curious- did you talk to any progressive groups? Record number of activists showing up at Dem Party mtgs in places like Tarrant.
@cd_hooks also, maybe we don't have a movement. Maybe the women's marches were an abbiration. Maybe the airport protests were fake news.
Also @cd_hooks assertion that Tea Party "activists did it themselves" conflicts w/ stories about Freedomworks and AFP involvement in '09.
