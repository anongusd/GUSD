The GOP swamp captain, Romney, isn’t ready for the necessary fights ahead. He has neither the guts, nor the fortitude, to legislatively do what needs to be done to save this country for our kids. He’s the embodiment of a broken, egomaniacal political class obsessed with power.
Romney IS the reason sane Americans have zero faith in both the filthy swamp, and the rats 🐀 that occupy it. I love this country. It’s everything to me. And I’m ashamed that this class of imbeciles has the power to ruin it. God help us.
These anti-Trump Republicans are nothing more than enormous frauds. They didn’t have balls to confront the libs when the important fights stared them in the face but, all of a sudden, they’ve “discovered” their “courage” &amp; decided to attack the POTUS? 	#Frauds #Hypocrites

@Montel_Williams Needing attention again, I see? Thirsty Montel is in the desperation portion of his lifecycle. I unblocked you to laugh at you, I needed a chuckle.
Romney wants to talk about “character”? How about a guy who aggressively attacks Trump during the 2016 campaign, after courting his support in 2012, who then jumps at an opportunity, AFTER attacking Trump, &amp; being forgiven, to interview for Sec. State? 	#Fraud #Hypocrite
Romney didn’t have the spine to take on Obama yet jumped at the opportunity to SELL US OUT before even being sworn in. This guy is a disgrace and I’m begging the Democrats to claim him. We don’t want him. We don’t need him.
Romney represents EVERYTHING wrong with the shell of a Party called the GOP. They’ve sold us out for too long &amp; gotten away w/it. I’m done apologizing for these imbeciles. Either get on the train towards fixing the disaster you swamp goons put us in or get the hell out of the way

@AshaRangappa_ @TheyCallMeTarz @MikeNicolella Care to answer why you feel it’s appropriate to refer to people as “boy”?
@AshaRangappa_ @TheyCallMeTarz @MikeNicolella Because I’m saving your “boy” tweet (not a good idea to call people “boy” @cnn) and I’m planning on using your embarrassing, amateur hour analysis of the Flynn persecution for material.
@AshaRangappa_ You’re curiously quiet about calling people “boy,” why? Do you feel this is appropriate? Does @CNN? A yes or no will do.
@AshaRangappa_ Why do you call people “boy”? Is this appropriate for an @JacksonYale employee? Does @cnn approve of you calling people “boy”?
@AshaRangappa_ You were an investigator? Yet you call people “boy” and you can’t piece basic facts together? Jim Comey: it’s “something I probably wouldn't have done or maybe gotten away with in a more … organized administration.”
@AshaRangappa_ Does @cnn approve of you calling people “boy”?
@AshaRangappa_ Are you fond of calling people “boy”?

@EWErickson I want to know how’s he turned an accurate comment from his “source” staying that “I didn’t renew” into I false headline about me being “dropped,” which was subsequently picked up by liberal media lemmings in an effort to damage my reputation. The story is false and I asked NRATV
@EWErickson I didn’t return a comment because I don’t deal with left-wing media types anymore. He managed to turn an accurate story, that I did NOT renew, into a headline about me being “dropped,” obviously insinuating that I’d been fired. This is 100% false.
@EWErickson We agree on one thing here, my departure from NRATV is in no way worthy of the attention it received. However, here’s why I’m troubled by their disingenuous story.

@KenMeyer91 you’re even dumber than the other two. That’s impressive. They humiliate themselves by reporting a BS story (which I’m eagerly awaiting their apology for) &amp; you double down on stupid. Just when I think you zeroes have hit the stupid ceiling you break right through.

4) Many of them are frauds - They know full-well that they’re doing liberal ACTIVISM yet, they continue to pretend they’re doing journalism.
3) Many of them pretend to fight against stereotypes while simultaneously stereotyping their ideological opponents - Dare to question nonsensical liberal media narratives and you can expect to be immediately labeled with a word ending in “ist” or “phobe.”
2) Many of them revel in the moral lapses of others while having ZERO morals themselves - In my prior line of work I witnessed some pretty disgusting behavior from holier-than-thou media folks who take pleasure in calling out others’ failings.
A listener asked me why I have such an issue with the lib media. Here’s why:	1) Many of them are prolific liars -When I ran for office I dealt with lib media-types who would deny the existence of basic (and easily researched) facts in order to lie and advance a narrative.

This story will get little play in the liberal media. Facts are hard for the loons in the liberal media. Yet they continue to wonder why Americans think they’re a laughingstock. https://t.co/QAXFN4ZEbH
Your disgusting efforts to weaponize the intelligence agency you ran in order to attack your political enemies is nothing more than police state tyranny. You’re a stain on our country, your Party, and anyone associated with you. You remind me of a failed tinpot dictator. 👇🏻 https://t.co/7J30nbbYIX
Make no mistake, the liberal media hacks, and their extremist liberal allies, have entirely lost control of their border narrative. These liars are in a panic and they’re desperate to keep their open borders agenda quiet. Stay vigilant &amp; continue to keep your eyes on this story.
Mueller, &amp; his band of Democrat witch hunters, are destroying the “justice” system. His outrageous abuses of power will backfire. All of his targets will weather this storm &amp; will, ironically, grow their profiles in the future as the real story of the Mueller witch hunt surfaces
Mueller is drunk with power and the liberals, the media, and the swamp, are celebrating his grotesque abuses of power. History will judge Mueller harshly when the real story of his tyrannical witch hunt comes out and those who supported him will be shamed.
The Vox, Think Progress, Media Matters bubble of idiots is in a panic. They now realize they’ve  completely lost their misguided, anti-border-security, propaganda fight. I can feel their desperation in their pathetic, feeble attempts to make you believe the caravan doesn’t exist.
I don’t want any liberal banned from twitter. But I also want twitter to stop pretending that they’re a neutral platform. They clearly don’t want conservatives on their platform.
Liberals, and their activist media pals, are terrified of the media coverage of the caravan. They are desperate to lie and hide the truth from you. In response I’ll be sure to maintain constant vigilance on this topic.
Did you own the libs today? If not, then get on it.

Vox and Think Progress on the caravan -&gt; There’s no caravan, there’s no caravan, there’s no caravan. #Imbeciles
Incredible reading the imbeciles at Vox trying to make pretend that the chaos at the border isn’t happening. #Idiots

@Louise3254 I can’t believe you are still twitter venting despite the fact that my show was dedicated to destroying this story today.
@LisaMei62 Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@Louise3254 Screw me? Maybe you should spend a moment listening to my show today (where I spend 30mins debunking this scheme) before you start twitter venting at me.
@jacflack22 @LisaMei62 No. It isn’t. My show is MY story. But whatever makes you feel good.
@LisaMei62 I cover the entire scheme on my podcast today. It was simply a bad headline.
@flttrbydragnfly @LisaMei62 Okay thanks
@LisaMei62 It’s not “my story.” It’s news content generated by writers for my site. Listen to my show today for details.
Twitter should just come out and admit they hate conservatives. Why continue to pretend? I’m expecting to be banned soon too so if you’d like to follow you can still check us out at https://t.co/OlR2AMUrOV.

Bob Mueller is entirely out of control. When the clear eyes of history look back upon his abomination of an “investigation” he will be viewed far differently than the hacks in the media choose to portray him now. This “investigation” is a disgrace to civilized humankind.
The hypocritical, phony Democrats are obsessed with police state tactics and weaponized govt when it comes to abusing their political enemies. Yet these same police state FRAUDS are complaining because Pres. Trump chooses to defend our border. Total frauds.
Twitter needs to make a decision ASAP. Does Twitter want to be an open platform or does Twitter want to be a publisher? Which is it Twitter? Because you cannot be both.
Twitter crossed the Rubicon this week. I’m not sure they understand the hornet’s nest they’ve disturbed. Big mistake.

@nickpwing @DLoesch @MrColionNoir @CamEdwards Let’s talk about it. You’re welcome on my show anytime to discuss the details of the case. How about this week?
