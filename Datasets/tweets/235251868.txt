South Dakota is not ready for industrial hemp. Why move ahead with something that could jeopardize law enforcement, expand our drug epidemic, or threaten the livelihood of existing crops? USDA has not issued federal guidelines. We need to press pause and consider all factors.
For me, supporting the 500-page Farm Bill is about protecting and promoting our farmers and our food supply ‚Äì not about legalizing industrial hemp. Anyone who implies otherwise is incorrect.
In light of recent discussions, it‚Äôs important to note the Farm Bill set the stage for states to have discussions on industrial hemp. I‚Äôve always believed most decisions are best made at the state level &amp; I supported the right for states to debate the specifics of industrial hemp
Other Farm Bill provisions:	‚úÖExpanded support for rural broadband	‚úÖAdded CRP acres	‚úÖSupport for SDSU‚Äôs Wokini Initiative	‚úÖ500+ pages of programs to reinforce the foundation of American ag
THREAD: While in Congress, I helped lead the House in passing the 2018 Farm Bill ‚Äì a critical safety net for SD producers and for America‚Äôs food supply. Here‚Äôs what it included: 	‚úÖStrengthened crop insurance 	‚úÖBolstered livestock disaster programs 	‚úÖImproved commodity titles

I fight the #DeathTax b/c it‚Äôs a double tax. I know exemption levels have changed since my dad‚Äôs death. But if you think simply moving the exemption levels makes this tax ‚Äúfair,‚Äù you‚Äôre misdirected.My principles don‚Äôt change because the dollar amount does. https://t.co/POdjhg434k
I have heard the recent debate over whether our family did estate planning effectively. To that, I ask: What does it matter? If a tax is only levied because someone didn‚Äôt pay lawyers enough before they died, then there‚Äôs a problem with that tax. https://t.co/POdjhg434k
