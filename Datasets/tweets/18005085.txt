@BrianGMattson @DavidAFrench Neither David nor I are being bitter or stupid. I'm not upset by his tweets at all. We disagree on the Trump-Russia conspiracy. That's fine. Almost everyone in DC has disagreed with me on this for years. We shouldn't pretend we agree so that you're comfortable on Twitter.
@DavidAFrench I'm extremely proud of my journalism about the Russia-Trump conspiracy, yes. I wrote this on January 17, 2017, when nearly everyone else was at the very height of Russia hysteria. It was difficult to stand up against it, but I'm so glad I did. https://t.co/Kh8gwE92Bt
@coollatina76 @davidharsanyi she has a lengthy history of writing error-riddled screeds.
@DavidAFrench your Russia-Trump conspiracy writing certainly speaks for itself.
@DavidAFrench Exactly, I think people would be forgiven for expressing surprise you align yourself with the concerns of the Trump-Russia skeptics at this date, given your previous writings on the matter and how those skeptics have been treated by the various Resistance elements for years.
@DavidAFrench And on that front, you were writing things like this around the same time. https://t.co/H0JY9QePhP
@DavidAFrench Except BuzzFeed was the hero of the dossier story -- it's only because they published it that Americans know just how ridiculous it was (and therefore how ridiculous the IC's selective leaks were). Better to aim fire at the partisans who weaponized it inside the U.S. government.

@Ugogodents Yes, he called me a liar. But I don't think anybody believed him then. And they certainly can't believe him now. My piece holds up quite well, I think.
@Klab2424 people tell me this all the time, but I have no idea what to do about it.
Media will help Schiff and Dems seamlessly transition from 2 years of Russia collusion allegations to other investigations, because media is just as complicit in Russia hoax as Democrats and so they need the transition just as much as Schiff/Dems do.

There's not enough support (inside or outside of Congress!) for returning to proper Constitutional order. Pinning hopes on Trump losing a legal battle is unwise. How to reassert authority without appearing to be blinded by Trump hatred is difficult and such reactions don't help.
Pundits acting like Trump crossed Rubicon with emergency order makes it harder to push back on harmful expansion of Article 2 at expense of Article 1, a problem going back many, many decades. As one scholar put it, if he crossed Rubicon, he joined many previous presidents there.

@jabeale So he's claiming he notified them *after* he launched the probe?
For those asking: Republicans in Gang of 8 at that time were Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, Richard Burr, Devin Nunes. Only one of those individuals (Nunes) has performed any real oversight of FBI -- and done so in face of major opposition from Resistance (media/Dems/NeverTrump).
Unclear if McCabe is telling truth now or then (i.e., even if briefing happened, doubtful that he disclosed thin basis, or 25th Amendment/wearing wires plots etc.) But unless you're a Russia conspiracy theorist, you might be concerned that McConnell/Ryan were so cavalier about it
McCabe says he briefed Gang of 8 in 2017 that FBI was going after Trump. Top GOP guy on House Intel says he can't comment on briefing but adds it would be "preposterous to deny that the FBI was investigating Donald Trump from the moment it opened its investigation in mid-2016.‚Äù

@Jhic709365 Too kind -- they have a "Watergate" in the story of the weaponization of a DNC info op re: Russia to undermine Trump -- and they cover it up.

@Ironicglasses Presidents have declared quite a few emergencies, and the republic has survived, but I wish Congress would retake its Article 1 Authority and not delegate everything to the executive branch. And I wish they would finally do something about border security.
@Ironicglasses Well, I prefer Congress to handle border issues. Trump's move is lawful -- Congress gave presidents authority to declare emergencies and use appropriated funds, and they previously authorized a barrier from the Pacific to Gulf. But I still wish Congress would handle this.
@allyourbits Perhaps, but the fact that literally tens of millions of people would be reasonably shouting that in this case should give the "Resistance" (which is, it's worth remembering, a resistance against the electorate) even more pause than usual.
@jeremymstamper @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I could be wrong, but I don't think your absurd hyperliteralism is a Constitutional reason to remove a lawfully elected president. Though perhaps reason for you to get checked out yourself! Best.
@jonk2525 Defending the Constitution isn't necessarily defending Trump, even if he is the lawfully elected head of the Executive Branch. Calling for its abuse, regardless of who you're emotionally reacting against, is definitely not conservative.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Abuse of the 25th Amendment, such as is suggested by the Resistance, is dangerous to our Constitutional system, yes. https://t.co/Nuh072SKov

@JonahNRO Obvious response would be deal with conservatives to elect him, despite himself, and in return he'd advocate for their goals, from judges to Paris Accord. Perhaps too early to say definitively but NATO commitments, other ForPol threats, outdated trade deals getting updated, etc.

@geoffreyking Actually, Paul Ryan was probably more honest about his lack of interest in border security than some leaders currently in office who speak one way and then take actions to undermine any border protection.
Learning how to resist the pressure to succumb to a mob is a really important survival skill right now. https://t.co/QLg43RHbFn
They don't accomplish protection and enforcement of the nation's borders and her rule of law because they rather obviously don't want to. Democrats are fairly open about their support of porous borders. Republican leaders try to hide from voters their intense support of same.
Strong argument to make that it's Congressional Republicans who bear heavy blame for failing to secure the border and protect rule of law, not just in this fight, but in all the previous ones. Yes, obvious bipartisan failure, but Republicans not covered in leadership glory here.

@KyleC7511 @78cuiserFJ40 @DavidAFrench It is worthwhile to distinguish between news reporting and analysis. David does *analysis* and as such, his speculation that Trump has committed nefarious offenses is a different thing. Further, he fully discloses to readers his anti-Trump views, unlike many reporters.
@MinnesotaVoice That's also bad. And makes it somewhat difficult to feel bad for him that he's a victim of a crazy conspiracy theory peddled by his legion of enemies. But that doesn't mean it's good to fall for a stupid conspiracy theory or excuse bad actions taken by government officials.
@MitchDonaldson4 @NewsLitProject Many reporters do, myself included -- which is why a news literate reader needs to know how to evaluate their use (and, in our current moment, rampant overuse).

Many media "fact" "checks" aren't checking facts but are matching Democratic talking points entirely. Which on the one hand makes sense, since they're both operating as political operatives in this debate, but unfortunate, because impartial, fact-based journalism is missing.

@ShermentS Except .... The Constitution gives Congress the authority to handle immigration laws. That they've failed (and that's true of both parties in recent decades, obviously) is true, but they're still the branch that needs to step up here.
Democrats' message: In some ways it's a crisis, in other ways it's not at all; orange man very bad; and trust us, this time we'll do the things we and our Republican cohorts have failed to do for decades if you give up your one piece of leverage.
Trump message: on long-standing national sovereignty, national security, and humanitarian grounds, we need major changes in border laws, infrastructure, and enforcement and only way to get Congress to do what it needs to do is by forcing the issue now.
Everyone likes to talk about winners and losers, and obviously tonight went better for some than others, but just in general, it's very healthy for our political leaders to debate things publicly.

@hellofootball11 @LintonPhillips Comey told Gowdy he was merely saying that they were alone in the room having a conversation, which is obviously ridiculous. No need to defend such silly statements. What's more, one can take meaning from the dishonesty and game-playing on display.
@OrinKerr @ProfMJCleveland That is just flatly not true, Orin. Feel free to disagree with her but don't make false claims about what she wrote. I have to wonder if you even read it. https://t.co/PG2vHOBXnI
Comey, who was yesterday pontificating on rule of law, says when he assured Preibus that a conversation he was planning to memorialize for various reasons (including to enable leaking to compliant media) was private, he just meant that the two guys were talking alone in a room.
Here's the beginning of that exchange (it goes on in this manner for a while, but here's the gist): 	Mr. Gowdy. What did you mean by "it was"?	Mr. Comey. That the two of us were speaking together alone,	that there was nobody else participating in the conversation. https://t.co/ZyX5mUICQm
So that's the context for the next line. Which is: "He then asked me if this was a 'private conversation.' I replied that it was." Trey Gowdy asked him about this and Comey's answer is so slippery and on-its-face ridiculous that it's really something.
I'll personally note the clumsy briefing of false/silly dossier items had to feel like blackmail to the incoming administration even before it was immediately leaked to compliant media. Anywho, Priebus asks if FBI is leaking and seems to have real concern about it.
Trey Gowdy asked Comey about his memo regarding a meeting with Reince Preibus on 2/8/17. His answer was fascinating. First, let's recall memo says Priebus wondered what was up with the bizarre briefing of the pee tape and dossier and how everything was leaking to the press.

The only reason we know Hillary Clinton and DNC secretly bought and paid for Russian info operation was because they leaked that fact to friendly WP reporters on the eve of a court forcing disclosure. Republican oversight forced that revelation, fought vociferously by Adam Schiff

Rosenstein's conflicts are obvious. But many people at top echelons of DOJ conflicted. Leakers, obstructionists, admitting they ran resistance. Many have been fired, forced to resign, demoted, etc. HUGE STORY, implications of which have been downplayed and ignored by media. https://t.co/4ugkVolUf4
Weissman's zealotry is worthy of coverage, particularly given his track record of being overturned years after damage done. And the curious choice by Mueller to hire him and Democrat partisans is worthy of coverage and interest by all people. These are legit concerns. https://t.co/5YbJGnzgLB
Again, Mueller literally once led the agency that is implicated in multiple ways in "Russia" probe. And Weissman's prosecutorial past is deeply problematic. You may not like Trump, but these are legitimate concerns. People should not be afraid to admit that. https://t.co/0lzPTsku8v

@JerylBier @jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy This take somewhat begs the question. Because these things are *arguably, at least* related to the same issues we're discussing: Holding the in-group accountable for crimes committed and/or not letting the out-group go down in blatantly political prosecutions.
@jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy The law, which can be fierce, should be applied consistently, yes. Prosecutors have wide discretion, which is fine. But they can't let friends go free and enemies be imprisoned for same things. Choosing one standard and sticking to it is important for trust in institutions.
@ProfSimonton @TPCarney @jimantle @realDharmakirti @yesnicksearcy FYI: people can in good faith disagree about whether global businessmen should retire before running for office. And they can even disagree about whether politicized investigations or lack of consistency in rule of law is a bigger problem than trying to do business with Russia.
@jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy OK, leaving deflection convo aside, I'll just note if Trump is guilty of treasonously colluding with Russia to steal the election, he should be held accountable. Also true: rule of law requires consistency, not supreme leniency for political friends and ruthlessness for enemies.
@TPCarney @jimantle @realDharmakirti @yesnicksearcy Well, it's certainly not the only question, and it seems to dramatically miss the forest for the trees in terms of whose politics are criminalized via limitless special counsels and whose are not, but I guess it's *a* question.
@jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy It was a deflection, I didn't say you defended Biden or Clinton, and we didn't even discuss Mueller or Trump, so I'm not sure what you're talking about. Was just commenting on your dismissal of the reader that seemed to miss his point.
@rhodeislander @TPCarney @jimantle @realDharmakirti @yesnicksearcy It is not.
@jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy Super cute deflection. But of course Biden was VP when family made deal. The argument that while VP is fine but not after launching a campaign for president? Convenient, if odd, distinction for who gets probed and who doesn't.
@jimantle @realDharmakirti @TPCarney @yesnicksearcy Is the Examiner calling for a wide-ranging, limitless special counsel to investigate both Clinton and Biden?
@TPCarney @yesnicksearcy Not sure what you're referring to exactly, either what in particular was being denied, or what deal you believe was made.
@TPCarney @yesnicksearcy Though obviously many people forgot the many stories, the many hours of testimony, etc. Or never read up enough on the Russia conspiracy theory to have a grasp of the details.
@TPCarney @yesnicksearcy FWIW, editorial falsely claims "This has been brought to light, after years of obfuscation by Trump adherents, by a guilty plea from the president's shady former lawyer." In fact,efforts have been public and written about -- and testified about in Congress -- for years.
@TPCarney @yesnicksearcy Whitewater/Russia probes share a few similarities and many, many, many differences. Either way, not sure doing global business is the same as the married man schtupping the intern, even if it's wrong to lie to federal authorities about either.
