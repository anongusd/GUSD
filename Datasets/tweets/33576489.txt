We need less confrontation and more collaboration, fewer outbursts and more outcomes, and less heat and more light
These exhausting distractions tear us apart, preventing us from working together and making real progress.
Genuine leadership doesn’t embolden hate; instead, it should promote kindness and understanding.
Each of us bring our own strengths as individuals but we are wise to recognize we are significantly stronger together.
Each of us face our own struggles but they are better overcome when we are united rather than divided.
I am proud to call Bflo - the ‘City of Good Neighbors’ - my home.  As a country &amp; as humans we could all benefit from being more neighborly
This display of intolerance is hurtful to individuals and the noble principles that genuinely make our nation great.
We are witnessing a dangerous and dismissive attitude toward some people as less accepted and less valued than others
