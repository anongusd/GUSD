@kidgolferman @tru_kells I posted several photos, magnified and changes of contrast, etc., when this came out and nobody really ran with it.  It‚Äôs from a surveillance units video of the so-called Bomber.  As you can see, the drivers side of the van has no windows.  Makes you wonder... https://t.co/kYVfWGOaKx
@MaxBoot Max the Bootlicker, what‚Äôs obscene is your daily charade of acting like a Conservative on the ‚ÄúMorning Joe with Dweedledum and his Moonbat wife Minkles‚Äù.  Your no different than your Communist employers, your simply a shill for the Globalists and the Communist Left.  MAGA 2020...
@AOC ‚ÄúLike‚Äù stick to your roots AOC, you ‚Äúlike‚Äù can‚Äôt fool Capitalists or Conservatives, just ‚Äúlike‚Äù be honest with yourself and ‚Äúlike‚Äù everyone else.  ‚ÄúLike‚Äù you might have ‚Äúlike‚Äù read the Cliff Notes on The Communist Manifesto, so ‚Äúlike‚Äù stick with your hero Carl Marx not Teddy.
@RepTedLieu @davidhogg111 ‚ÄúTruth with Ted‚Äù üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£.  Lying Lieu, this guy is such a con man, he‚Äôs the used care salesman of the Communist Left.  You make everything a partisan issue, every time your mouth moves it causes another division.
@RepTedLieu @davidhogg111 Get the facts straight #LyingLieu.  Most importantly guns don‚Äôt commit violence, people do.  When someone commits suicide, the gun doesn‚Äôt pull the trigger.  Over 2/3rds of those killed with a firearm are suicides.  None of those deaths are by ‚Äúevil black assault riffles‚Äù.
@lisamurkowski I hope and pray Alaskans will finally understand that Lisa Murkowski is not a true Conservative and not a true Republican.  Just a RINO.  Alaska can do better and must do better, the lower 48 needs your help.  Vote for a true Conservative next election, our Republic depends on it
@lisamurkowski who take our jobs and tax money away to pay for all their welfare benefits.  Then as a Senator, you turn your back on the vast majority of Conservatives, when all you have to do is support our President and fight for the funding we desperately need.  Alaskans, must vote you out.
@lisamurkowski RINO,	I guess you and your constituents, who have a natural barrier that keeps them safe from the Illegal Invaders from the south, could careless about the majority of Conservatives who have to deal with the drunk drivers, rapists, murders, drug dealers, pedophiles and illegals..
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Biff,	You‚Äôre a coward, the Mexican Narco Terrorists own your ass.  Your Communist party has sold this Republic out for money and you stand by watching our kids die from their poison. There are millions of us out here, most highly trained ex-military, who are watching you traitor.
@TheAllenBennett @MarkVadik @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Allen, I don‚Äôt know if your familiar with the Red Letter laws being passed in some states.  Others are looking into passing these draconian laws.  Anyone saying your a threat can get the ball rolling for a warrant to seize your weapons.  You get a knock and there they go.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Please convince your father to go on the offensive now and release the FISA related documents.  Do it before the Weissmann/Mueller report fuels the other investigations.  It‚Äôs now or never...
@realDonaldTrump Remember you are the head of the DOJ, if Barr doesn‚Äôt open a real Investigation on Clinton Russian Collusion/Foundation/E-Mail you know you‚Äôve been played.  Please, wake up and fight for America.  The Communist Left is destroying our Republic.
@realDonaldTrump Weissmann/Mueller report leak out to the press.  You are getting played, if you don‚Äôt strike now, the other investigations will seem credible to the brain dead population.  It‚Äôs now or never President Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Have the Texas Rangers seize the server.  If you want the truth to come out, you better go on offense before it‚Äôs too late.  Your new AG is a Bush family loyalist.  He‚Äôs going to convince you to not release the FISA abuse and other documents.  At the same time, allow a copy of ..
@vermontgmg @brianstelter Outsider win the Whitehouse.  To make matters worse the MSM operates hand and hand with this cabal.  Perhaps one day the whole truth will be written, but you know what they say.  The ‚Äútruth‚Äùis written by the winner, the loser has no say in the matter.  The whole thing is a canard
@vermontgmg @brianstelter However, the corrupt leadership of the FBI and DOJ will protect their institutions above all else.  That‚Äôs why all we see is process crimes.  They know they can hide their transgressions behind redactions and national security.  Not to mention the Uniparty will not allow another
@vermontgmg @brianstelter illegal information to assist the Clinton campaign.  When that failed they had to cover their illegal crimes and start the current Coup that we are still dealing with.  The entire FISA warrant was criminal and therefore all cases based on this information should be overturned.
@vermontgmg @brianstelter Republican campaigns beginning in 2015.  Obama officials were caught illegally unmasking U.S. citizens.  Fusion GPS began spying on the Trump campaign in late 2015.

@StormIsUponUs @mama_od I like to call it what it ultimately is, COMMUNISM.  They like to hide behind words like Liberalism and Socialism.  We have to define the Left properly, so that we can show those who are uneducated about the horrors of Communism the truth between our Republic and their Evil.
@rendabeltzer3 @Surfermom77 @DanaRuxi123 as well.  The delay in release will allow the media to cloud the issue so much that when released, it will be to late and the other investigations will finally take the Trump family down.  If he doesn‚Äôt release and go on offense before the release of the Mueller report, it‚Äôs over
@rendabeltzer3 @Surfermom77 @DanaRuxi123 when Sessions was fired he would be seen as a Trump ally.  Trump went with AAG Whitikar, we know he wrote negative things about the investigation.  Barr is a Bush family loyalist, we know how much love they have for POTUS.  He will also convince Trump to not release the FISA info
@rendabeltzer3 @Surfermom77 @DanaRuxi123 Unfortunately, I have zero confidence in AG Barr.  He is old establishment, I believe he is a Trojan horse.  From the beginning I knew something wasn‚Äôt right with Sessions.  Sessions set Trump up and Barr will finish the job off.  I believe Barr wrote negative things, so that...
@helbent51 @Surfermom77 The DNC will not let the FBI near the server.  Why in God‚Äôs green earth would they not allow the worlds top internet forensics investigators look at the original server.  Do you not have an ounce of intellectual honesty in your being?
@Surfermom77 @katscan27_kim If President Trump doesn‚Äôt release all FISA abuse, Coup and all other related documents right now.  He is a fool to think the Uniparty won‚Äôt leak the entire Andrew Weissmann hit piece.  If he doesn‚Äôt show this was an illegal Coup, the other investigations will take him down.
@redsteeze @rosieca76713254 For those that haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, the Communist Lefts agenda is to destroy Capitalism.  That‚Äôs why they want cradle to grave governmental power.  Their goal is complete control of the population.  So in a sense, it is a Ponzi scheme.  However, this one takes our freedom
@tictoc That Wall sure will put a crimp on Hawaii.  I wonder how much of their tourism sector will take a hit.  Please, can someone come up with an actual damage Hawaii will suffer.  Before la-la land, a plaintiff actually had to suffer damages.  Half of these states lack standing, zilch
@MichaelAvenatti I‚Äôm curious Creeps, are you doing this case for the limelight (free press and cable TV) or another payday?  Or is there more, I‚Äôm just curious because you always have an ulterior motive?  Because we know you have absolutely no moral compass and lack a shred of ethical fiber.
@Moonlight_the @unscriptedmike @AOC Since you ran out of characters Kevin, I figured Maoist Dirtbags was on your mind.  Oh yeah, I forgot Racist Race-Baiters should be on the list.
@steph93065 @BreitbartNews I wish the next victim of violence, while wearing a MAGA hat, brings a lawsuit against the MSM, Democratic politicians, Hollywood personalities and various pundits for creating this violent environment.  They continue to incite and encourage violence towards Trump supporters.
@KamalaHarris We need another four years of MAGA.  Trump/Pence 2020.
@KamalaHarris Please, you‚Äôve already done enough damage to this Republic and my pay check.  We need someone who places the needs of America children First.  Someone that doesn‚Äôt blame an inanimate object for committing violence.  Also, someone who doesn‚Äôt support illegal Sanctuary cities,state
@KamalaHarris As a Senator you have fought to spend our tax dollars on Illegal Invaders.  You fight to increase taxes on our citizens, so we can pay their welfare benefits.  You fight to spend our taxes on their children‚Äôs education.  You fight for gun free zones and against hardened schools.
@KamalaHarris I‚Äôm glad you won‚Äôt see the White House.  Medicare was never intended to take care of someone from cradle to grave.  We don‚Äôt have the money, you guys have put us in a $22 Trillion dollar hole.
Poor Jussie the drug addict, he wasn‚Äôt in his right mind.  The guy gets some molly and now he has a drug problem.  This guy is going to get away with a slap on the wrist.  Reverse the races and this guy would be absolutely destroyed in the public arena.
Wow, forcing myself to watch AC 360 on CNN and Cornel West (prof. At Princeton) just said Jussie Smollett might have s drug problem.  He thought it might be the reason why he committed this crime.  It‚Äôs sad, I can see this as the false narrative the MSM and Liberals run with.
@delwilliams Jussie Smollett is racist.  He falsely accused white conservative men of using racist and homophobic slurs.  This is the narrative he constructed, he knew the Left would buy it hook, line and sinker.  Then you ran with it and blamed all White Conservative men.  That‚Äôs racism.
@delwilliams It‚Äôs not compassion Del, Liberals always have a knee jerk reaction based on emotion.  You guys talk and believe everything your told before you actually think about things logically.  That‚Äôs really the difference between Liberals and Conservatives.  We use logic and reason first.
@delwilliams Really, can‚Äôt you just believe the bastard lied to the whole world (you too).  No, you would still rather blame the White Conservative for all the worlds woes.  All cases have leaks to the media, even ones based on White people.  Quit making excuses for this dirtbag.
@delwilliams Truth hurts Del, come clean and apologize for your preconceived false narrative tweets.  Try not to look at everything based on race but on how individuals of all races actually treat you.  You don‚Äôt like stereotypes and neither do White Conservatives.
@delwilliams @JussieSmollett What‚Äôs sad is the number of false accusations perpetrated by the Communist Left.  Leftists of all ethnicities continue to engage in hate hoaxes.  Air Force Academy, Covington and now Jussie are just three of the latest.  The MSM and DNC continues to push these false narratives.
@delwilliams The truth was obvious when it hit the headlines.  Only those who have hate in their hearts try to find blame in those who were falsely accused.  You wanted to believe this hoax because it would justify the the hatred you carry in your heart.  It fit your preconceived narrative.
@delwilliams Apologize Del, it will set your conscious free.  Two weeks in and you still believed this Liar ü§•, it either shows a lack of good judgement or the lack of intellectual honesty.  Which one is it Del?
@delwilliams Are you going to call half the country and apologize for your blind racist bigotry?  Is Jussie going to apologize to America, no he will play the role of a victim and blame all for his transgressions.
@delwilliams @kanyewest Most Black men around the country laughed when they saw these headlines, especially those in Chicago.  Only an idiot believed these over the top accusations.  I wish the Communist Left had an ounce of intellectual honesty left in their souls, however, we all know they don‚Äôt.  Sad
@shondarhimes @delwilliams @JussieSmollett Your right, I called Chicago police when this hit the headlines and told them it was one of Jussie‚Äôs girls.
@RicWilson @delwilliams Yeah, that red hat really beat the sh!t out of Jussie üòÇü§£üòÇ.  You guys are the ones that carry out violence against an inanimate object, it‚Äôs time the Left gets some therapy for their mental health.  MAGA....
@delwilliams Still waiting for your apology to half the country Del?  Let me guess, Trump triggered Jussie and even though Jussie lied it‚Äôs still Trumps and MAGA people‚Äôs fault for the whole incident.  Yoda would be proud of our Jedi mind control powers.
@delwilliams @MichaelAvenatti Also, let me educate you on one thing.  Every aspect of life is political, it‚Äôs that simply.  So please look into the mirror and let out a good laugh at what you see, then sit down and shut you up.  Pedophiles deserve no respect or sympathy, they are heartless sick monsters.
@delwilliams @MichaelAvenatti Reading comprehension might help some Del.  Creeps tweeted ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over‚Äù, so I got excited and thought he would finally go back to his roots. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs not, but a dirt bag named R. Jelly (a pedophile) might finally pay for his crimes.  Do you support R. Kelly?
@MichaelAvenatti Damn, I thought you where going to permanently go back to chasing ambulances üöë.  As for Leftist R. Kelly, another pedophile bites the dust.  It‚Äôs a great day!!!

@hopeful45890551 Not to mention the number of mixed individuals that always identify as the minority heritage.  Something is mentally wrong with these individuals, they are so easily persuaded by the Marxists.  It‚Äôs victimhood politics, they prey on the sheeple.  It‚Äôs just sad.
@hopeful45890551 Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of sad.  I think Everyone should be proud of their whole Heritage.  Instead, white man evil and you should exercise and cleanse the white away.  I can‚Äôt tell you how many white Communist Leftists that would grate their white skin off that I‚Äôve encountered in life.
@hopeful45890551 If they don‚Äôt blame the brothers, they will take the same course as they have in Virginia.  It will be pushed out in time,so people will have other controversies on their radars.  He will get a slap on the wrist and then embark on his Redemption Journey.
@BostonsBullies @AKinkhabwala How about your owner today, solicitation in Florida.  2 counts and an arrest warrant from a sex sting.  You won‚Äôt see a Rooney looking for a ‚ÄúHappy Ending‚Äù in a day spa.

@MarkDice @2sly4i @therealroseanne Because he‚Äôs not White.  You can get away with anything if you blame the White man.  They will say he suffered at the hands of Whites his whole life.  Then add on the White homophobes excuse.  It will never end and they will always be victims.  Sad and Pathetic...
The Communists Representatives on the Left continue to threaten to sue for the full release of the Mueller Report.  We must put pressure on President Trump to finally release all documents pertaining to FISA Abuse and FBI Corruption.  Those involved in this Coup must be destroyed
@KamalaHarris Did you and Al Sharpton work on this pathetic statement this morning.  You ought to follow Al‚Äôs coattails and become a professional race-baiter.  It pays well, just ask Al and Jesse Jackson.  Plus, your going to need something to fall back on after you don‚Äôt win the nomination.

It‚Äôs time to once and for all put a stop to these sanctuary states and cities.  Ice could have gotten him on 4 separate occasions, Democrats should be ashamed of themselves.
If you still have conversations with anyone on the Communist Left, share this video with them and then ask them to re-evaluate their version of compassion.  Tell them to have some compassion for our law enforcement and their own citizens, not these criminal monsters.

@BostonsBullies @AKinkhabwala The difference between the AFC North vs afc east.  The North is the most physical division in football.  You guys have zero competition in your division, every one in awhile you guys fall asleep and find yourself in a game.  Sorry, your knowledge is superficial BostonSissies.
@BostonsBullies @AKinkhabwala You know you guys have cheated, you would sale your mothers if needed to win.  It‚Äôs cool your a homer, the rest of the league knows the gift calls you guys always get.  The fact that you can‚Äôt breathe near tb because you‚Äôll get a flag.  Filming teams illegally, stuff like that.
@donaldtrumpforc @RobertL75172141 That ought to piss Gavin off.  This is why I love this guy, he‚Äôs a counterpuncher.  He‚Äôs a straight shooter until you jack with him, then he drops the hammer üî®.
@NahBabyNah It sounds like this guy was consumed with hate. I wish those in charge of our government and media would realize their actions and biases can fuel a fire that burns in these types of individuals.  The Communist Left continues to spread the false narrative that MAGA=Nazi.
@RepSwalwell @cta @AFTunion Biff,	We have more than enough resources to adequately educate American citizens.  If you guys would take care of our children and not the illegal Invaders kids, we could have smaller classrooms and more money for teachers.  The Communist Lefts border policies are to blame.
@BostonsBullies @AKinkhabwala It‚Äôs not just the organization that people hate (years of cheating), it‚Äôs the fans as well.  They always chime in on topics they know nothing about and then they invoke the name of their deity tb12.  There will always be several asterisks next to their SB wins.  AFC East=weakest
@nowthisnews @AOC What do you suggest AOC, empty Super Max of it‚Äôs drug kingpins?  How about making El Chapo President of The Pot Dealers Association.  How about you make your drug dealer into an executive.  That way your buying from a legal dealer and you could help bring that ratio down some.
@AOC All that money from Obama‚Äôs executive order ran out.  The Bureau of Propaganda had to let go of Communist activists who were parading as journalists.
@AOC It‚Äôs actually Communism, you guys like to water things down with semantics.  Also, we are a Republic.  I know you guys hate to say this word because it blows your whole popular vote mob rules narrative.
@KamalaHarris Says the Communist hack from California.  You practice and preach diversity politics, you have done everything in your power to help divide this nation.  Your initial Tweet on the Jussie Smollett case tells us all we need to know.  Your an enemy of this Republic Commissar Kamala
@TheAllenBennett @MarkVadik @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The Communist Left will then add new categories to the psychiatric guidelines to take the guns away from law abiding citizens on the Right.  I wish you guys had the balls to be honest and just say you want to confiscate all firearms.  That‚Äôs your real aim, control the opposition
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Biff,	We don‚Äôt want your California policies.  Just remember this, you are creating your own defeat.  Keep infringing on the 2nd Amendment and see how this ultimately plays out.  I promise, you will witness the destruction the Communist Left in this Republic.  As for you, prison.

@Wade_Hummel @steph93065 @DonnaShelley2 @realDonaldTrump They always said they would destroy us from within.  Isn‚Äôt funny how they used the Motherland to frame this attempted Coup.

@NotSnapTheJap @NachoDonut @idaho_boss @JohnRossBowie are leaving your state.  Overtaxation and regulation are killing business owners in your cesspool of a state.  The majority of the population is morally bankrupt and your elected officials are corrupted to the core.  So please, stay there and give your paycheck to these people.
@NotSnapTheJap @NachoDonut @idaho_boss @JohnRossBowie Need to lay off the drugs son, your conflating reality and fantasy.  It‚Äôs also funny that you didn‚Äôt talk about that postage stamp you live in.  The  two topics you chose to elaborate upon, truly shows how benighted you are regarding economic issues.  It‚Äôs a fact business owners
@NotSnapTheJap @NachoDonut @idaho_boss @JohnRossBowie Well all your business‚Äôs, retirees and over taxed are coming here in droves.

@lee_borden @steph93065 @DonnaShelley2 @realDonaldTrump You speak the truth, I pray we can stop this before things get violent.  Unfortunately, I think it‚Äôs heading that way.  The Communist Left doesn‚Äôt want to coexist with the Conservative Right.  Their tactics and actions tell us everything we need to know.
@steph93065 @DonnaShelley2 @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs really sad is the fact that we have so many delusional people that  buy it hook, line and sinker...  We are truly at a crossroad in this country, I‚Äôm afraid rhetoric won‚Äôt solve our problems.  The Communist Left is truly vicious and they intend to destroy our Republic.
@brianstelter Please Mr. Censorship, just be honest with the American public.  You are a Progressive (Communist) script reader.  You work hand and hand with the radical Communist Left political regime.  We all know this already (low ratings), just man/woman up be intellectually honest for once
@NotSnapTheJap @NachoDonut @idaho_boss @JohnRossBowie However....   Are you talking about the number of false hate crimes perpetrated by the Left to frame Conservatives.

@JohnRossBowie @idaho_boss Give me a break John, I‚Äôve looked over your posts and retweet‚Äôs.  You happily share your love for the right.  Your party lives by diversity politics and you support them.  Unfortunately, the Left doesn‚Äôt want to a united country and your blind.  Thanks and have a good evening.
@JohnRossBowie @idaho_boss Unfortunately, you guys have done this hundreds of times.  Air Force Academy, Covington, now Jussie.  These are just three of the latest big ones.  Your Party and Media live off this crap.  Maybe you should use your logic and reasoning and not let your emotional side rule first.
@idaho_boss @tomselliott @brianstelter Barb,	I‚Äôm sorry you were convinced to hate your ancestry and skin color.  I‚Äôm sorry you would rather believe the lies Jussie told than the real truth.  I‚Äôm sorry your mentally unstable and that you allow the Progressive MSM take advantage of this illness.  I hope you can get help
@SenGillibrand What‚Äôs your revised statement 2020 Presidential Candidate Gillibrand?  Praying for White Conservative Americans and the hateful treatment they continue to receive in the MSM and from the Democratic Party.
@IsaacHayes3 @JussieSmollett How about saying it‚Äôs wrong to falsely accuse anyone of this kind of event.  Unfortunately, this Progressive tactic will continue and the MSM will spread the deceit as truth. What‚Äôs sad is Progressives only care about how it makes them look and not how the victims might feel. Sad
@MichaelAvenatti Wow, Mikey has one shred of decency left.  I have a feeling you‚Äôll be the only Progressive to do so.  This has happened dozens of times and the Communist Left continues to utilize this tactic to divide this nation.  Air Force Academy and Covington are other hateful examples.
@SeanAstin @JussieSmollett Waiting for your apology Sean Aston, the evil chill stirring in the hearts of the hateful Progressive Left continues to hurt and divide America.  Celebrities like yourself, continue to blame Conservative White America for racial issues.  Smollett is another example of this hate.
@tomselliott @brianstelter More Fake News from the Communist Left.  Air Force Academy, Covington and Smollett are just the latest in a long string of false narrative attacks against Conservative White America.  One thing I can guarantee, there won‚Äôt be any apologies.  Just crickets and more Fake News...
@AB84 Your family AB, sometimes families fight but they always work it out.  You will always be know as the best WR in Steeler history.  In San Fran, you would never achieve that distinction.  Steeler Nation has your back if you have ours.  Work things out...
@and_so_it_goes @Gunntwitt @Valnofux You are correct, the pants do not match.  Black line runs through the white areas on one and not the other.  Also, the shoulders don‚Äôt match, Northam is on the left and perhaps the other guy is the trash on the right.  All you need to know is that he admitted to being in the pic.
@KamalaHarris Build the damn wall then, how much money are you guys getting from the Mexican Cartels?
@brianstelter Do you prefer this one over the other?  I think it shows your vest for censorship and propaganda.  #AlexJones https://t.co/KA9zpGh8bc
@MichaelAvenatti @jack @TwitterSupport Your only worried about this because your Progressive buddies got caught trying to vilify these children.  You bastards do this with every story that hits the news cycle.  You destroy someone, like you tried to do with Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh.  You only care about 2020.
@FrEdwardBeck How many different ways are you going to screw these boys (Yes, I went there)?  No comment on the other racist parties.  Your destruction of the truth in this story, shows who you ultimately represent.  Your a coward Ed...
@ACTBrigitte @ksteven37 They are just spelled differently, both are evil.
@SeanPMonahan @AOC Nope, talking about your useless idiot.  Sandy from the Bronx.
@AOC And your saying to yourself, ‚Äúfooled these idiots‚Äù.  Your just a scam Sandy, people are figuring it out.  Even those idiots the Bronx.
@AOC Sandy,	Tweeting all day doesn‚Äôt equal Representation.  If you took the time you spend on Twitter and actually applied it towards learning your new job, you might help someone.  You‚Äôve got a long way to go.
it‚Äôs all said and done nobody wants you to leave.  All you guys need to work this thing out.  Everyone needs everyone.  But as a fan, I need to put on my Black and Gold 84 on Sundays.  I just can‚Äôt imagine a game without 84.

@AB84 I just wanted to say thanks üôè for all the joy you‚Äôve brought to my life.  Your life story is inspirational and your work on the field is unmatched.  I really hope you continue to write your legacy as a Steeler.  You still have a chance to win multiple SB and cement your...
@brianstelter @barbarastarrcnn I can picture it in my mind right now, dozens of lifetime military men running around the Pentagon dribbling crazy nonsense while slamming Red Bull.  How do you idiots come up with this üí©.
@brianstelter @barbarastarrcnn The same Barbra Starr who dresses up like different witnesses on news stories, the original fake news reporter.  If it‚Äôs not your Censorship, it‚Äôs your fake news.
@MichaelAvenatti @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs wrong Creeps, no longer getting all that free airtime.  Remember 2018, you had your chance and you screwed it up.  You‚Äôll always be known for 2018 and that‚Äôs it.  #BastaCreepsNapoleonatti
@RepMarkMeadows You should all have to stay on the border until you figure it out.  Nobody is talking about the 20,000,000 Illegal Invaders already here.  Both parties have allowed this cluster f#ck to happen, each are to blame for the current crisis.
@GordonAtkinson_ @DRUDGE_REPORT Since your the smart one Gordo, you do the math on this one.  Conservative number of Invaders living in America =20,000,000.  Your telling me out of that number there is only one Jihadi Invader.  Your the delusional one Gordo, you and the other idiots on this thread.
@magus721rn @NYCAntifa Because it might cause the remaining two brain cells in one of you to rub together and wake up from Antifa Dumbass phase.  Every once in awhile it works, call me soft hearted if you will.  Who knows, if you get a job and pay taxes for awhile it might be you.
@KamalaHarris Your really not cool üòé Kamala, most Americans still know what a rude, bitchy, condescending, disrespectful and generally cold hearted woman you really are.  No amount of touchy-feely Tweets will change these perceptions.  Even the Left isn‚Äôt stupid enough to vote you in for 2020
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Then get off your ass and do your job Tool.  Go talk to your Grandmother Pelosi and take care of all Americans, not just the Left and the Illegal Invaders.
@Comey How long do you you have to sit in front of the mirror saying this dribble over and over until you believe it to be the truth.  Your a TOOL Jimmy, who lost his decency decades ago.
@magus721rn @NYCAntifa No need to project, I hate them (The Original Klan, founded by Democrats) like I hate you worthless two year olds.  Go to Venezuela, North Korea or China and live out your grandiose visions of being the next ‚ÄúChe‚Äù Guevara wannabes.
@NYCAntifa Your the the new political ‚ÄúKlan‚Äù, you guys cover up like cowards because you know your in the wrong.  You try to gang up and beat on women, old people and any one else who stands up against your communist bullshit.
@AOC Do you sometimes forget to take your meds?  Also, that second blurb of thought is what a Conservative is and does.  You out to try it sometime, you might like what you see in the mirror.
@AOC Let‚Äôs hope the people in the Bronx that voted for this moron can somehow pull their heads from their rectums in 2022.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Tool,                                                        His story has yet to be written, you on the other hand have been in office since 2013 and your record of lying ü§• to constituents is epic.  Get to work and quit Tweeting like a 13 year old little pronoun...
@SteveScalise @krissyshouse Because it‚Äôs a vast Right-Wing Conspiracy Steve, we‚Äôve been at this sh!t for decades.  We‚Äôre that damn good.  All jokes aside, they live in the Twilight Zone.  That‚Äôs the most plausible thing I can come up with anymore.
@AOC Your really using our time spell-checking on Twitter.  You realize we pay you to do important things not to be the Twitter spelling Nazi.  Grow the f#ck up Sandy!
@MJC63335086 Probably gave them shiny bank cards, filled with our hard earned tax dollars.  Glad I didn‚Äôt take the family to the movie tonight, I‚Äôll need that money to pay the IRS a little more this coming year.  Do you ever say to yourself, that this is just f#cked-up and how did we get here
@sxdoc @t_scott73 @SebGorka @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Libs have no souls, this poor woman can‚Äôt even talk.  They should (but don‚Äôt) feel terrible using this woman like a ‚ôü.  She could be dead already, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.  They will try to get through as many cases as they can.  They are truly sad...
@sxdoc @t_scott73 @SebGorka @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Can‚Äôt wait!!!
@RepMarkMeadows All of you guys and gals need to take your a$$ down to the border where there is no wall and camp out for the weekend.  Work the weekend with the Border Patrol and ICE.  There might be a few that find their souls and decide to back the POTUS.
@brianstelter @CNNPR Gollum Stelter, Mr. Censorship.  Your calling Hannity out?  You don‚Äôt even have enough credibility to say the mans name.  Just go look for your ring, Gollum....

@RepSwalwell Then back it up with action Rep. Tool.  No more sanctuary for the Illegal Invaders.  Shut the border down and build the damn wall.
@AOC I can‚Äôt wait to see Sandy wearing an eye patch and channeling her best ‚ÄúSnake Plissken‚Äù imitation to escape the Bronx.  When she can‚Äôt deliver all the freebies her ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are going to eat her alive.  Can‚Äôt wait to watch this train wreck...

@AOC @FoxNews @DailyCaller The voters from the Bronx are either the cheapest bastards around and don‚Äôt want to pay for a damn thing or the dumbest bastards around.  How can you believe anyone talking about politics and asking for your vote and also smells like Starbucks at the same time.  Baffling...
@AOC @FoxNews @DailyCaller Let‚Äôs learn about this, shall we? Can anyone else see her on the campaign trail with a white board in hand. With a column of freebies (Free College,Healthcare,Yoga, Botox,Morning After Pill,Viagra- soy pronouns have a hard time, etc,)on one side and a big check on the other side.
@ChelseaClinton Tell the Illegal Invaders from the south to get theirs, I imagine they are the ones who are infecting New York and the rest of the country.  By the way, it‚Äôs not just the measles they are infecting us with.  This is another cost we are forced to deal with, thanks Chuck &amp; Nancy.
@charliekirk11 You can even maintain the wall and help pay for border security moving forward.  There is one thing this government is good at and that‚Äôs regulation and tax collection.  Make them pay for their crimes, not the American Taxpayer.
@charliekirk11 And you pay for the WALL with a Remittance Tax on the Illegal Invaders.  They send the lion-share of the money they make back home without paying a dime in taxes.  They wire or send international money orders to their families.  A Flat Tax Rate on every dollar will build the wall
@MichaelAvenatti Maybe he needs a Creepy sleazy ambulance üöë chasing lawyer?  Wait that sounds just like you, a dirt bag representing a dirt bag.  Sounds like a win-win, you and Pedo Kelly can sing together on CNN and MSNBC.
@realDonaldTrump It will be a income tax and s penalty tax for breaking are immigration laws.  Tax all wires and money orders going to Mexico and other Latin American countries.
@realDonaldTrump Have the Illegal Invaders pay a Remittance Tax on all the money orders and bank wires.  The make money here and send it all home, then receive welfare benefits.  Make them pay a Flat Tax Rate on the amount they send home.  Not only can they pay to build it they can also maintain
@MichaelAvenatti hopes to be cast in the next comic book movie.  However, I would like to see a death match between Creepy ‚ÄúThe Tool‚Äù Napoleonatti vs Jim ‚ÄúThe Texas Hammer‚Äù Adler.  That would be one hell of match, pitting a slick California attorney vs a tough as nails Texas lawyer.
@MichaelAvenatti Has anyone else taken a couple a seconds to really look at Creeps profile photo.  I‚Äôll bet a million dollars he took an hours worth of selfies trying to get this one photo.  The perfect shadow and all, I thought this guy was an attorney.  Maybe he‚Äôs really a Mexican wrestler or..
@RepAdamSchiff @Teresa_Denemy You missed all those briefings because you were on CNN and MSNBC every fricken day, hell most people think you work full time for both networks. The other times you‚Äôve missed were do to meeting and colluding with the Chinese and big Corporations on keeping the border open.  Tool.
@SenSanders @Teresa_Denemy Well Idiot, you can start putting people to work on the damn wall!  Then have them retrofit every school in America with the proper security and entry systems to protect every child every day!  That‚Äôs lots of jobs, then start the other infrastructure.  Our safety first.
@KamalaHarris Liberal hellholes that are bankrupt and tax their residents into oblivion.  Like I said too many reasons.  Kamala loves to make them feel like victims and if they just follow her to the promise land, all will work out.  Unfortunately, the university‚Äôs lied to them about reality.
@KamalaHarris There are two many reasons why they are in the position they CHOOSE to be in.  Most feel entitled to live at a standard comparable to the one their parents have achieved.  They don‚Äôt understand these things take years of hard work and sacrifice.  They also CHOOSE to live in .....

@RepSwalwell And Eric, your an every day TOOL to America.  Promising poor people in your district more freebies to become their Representative is fraud.  Your an All-America fraudulent TOOL.
@AB84 AB, show the world your the better man in this situation.  Be the reason number SB 7 will happen next year.  Play for God, you, your family and Steeler Nation.  Steeler fans know the offense runs through you.  Ask ownership for a balanced offense.  Have a sit down, your a Steeler
@MichaelAvenatti @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson your doing is not who most Americans are.  You are a parasite and cancer who lives and works to take and destroy others.  One day this will all catch up to you.  Someone will give you a taste of your own medicine. When it does I hope you remember this Tweet.
@MichaelAvenatti @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Creeps,	Everyone doesn‚Äôt think or believe like you.  In America we allow people to voice their concerns and opinions.  However, we don‚Äôt believe in trying to destroy someone‚Äôs livelihood or the livelihood of those who work for companies that advertise on a news channel.  What ...
@MichaelAvenatti @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Are you still at it Creeps?  Your that kid that keeps on picking on someone, then gets his ass handed to him.  Tucker owned you, you had your chance face to face and you looked like the fool you are.  You blew your 15 minutes, your just annoying now.  Crawl back under your rock.
@MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr So we shouldn‚Äôt call you Creeps Nostradanatti, I guess I‚Äôll stick with Creeps Napoleonatti.  It fits your Little Man Complex.  That being said, I want to thank you for the daily dose of Progressive lunacy.
@MittRomney Mittens,	Your Uni-Party (Dems + Never Trumpers) have done everything short of killing this man.  He and his family have been under attack from the day he declared his candidacy.  Conservatives outside of Utah, see through your sanctimonious bullish!t.  You are part of the problem
@MittRomney Mittens,
@brianstelter @peterbergencnn And Stelter is at war with the truth.  Stop your censorship Brian, the First Amendment applies to Conservatives too.  #AlexJones
@KamalaHarris That‚Äôs a nice story Kamala, unfortunately, when everyone is stuck with Medicare there won‚Äôt enough resources to treat cancer.  Instead, you might have already died from the common virus because you can‚Äôt get in to see the doctor in a timely manner.  No need to worry about cancer.
@brucemartin68 Yeah, I grew up in the Valley and live in Houston now.  Things are getting worse on a daily basis.  There are places here that have illegal families that are crammed on the land.  No plumbing or electricity, basically living on dirt floor shacks and tents.  People have no idea...
@ewarren I wish America‚Äôs would ask themselves how any politician making $174,000 a year, can retire with net worth‚Äôs into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  The amount of quid pro quo surrounding their families is criminal.  Then they have the nerve to act like their helping us.
@BarryEhlert You can see the happiness and joy in her eyes.  You and your wife have obviously given her a tremendous amount of care and love.  She‚Äôs a blessing to this world
@MichaelAvenatti stay relevant.  Crawl back to your hole Creeps, the worlds a better place with you there.  As for the rest of you, you guys wish for worse outcomes to President Trump on a daily basis.  Stop with the moral outrage...
@MichaelAvenatti That‚Äôs rich ‚ÄúCreepy‚Äù, you know there‚Äôs not a specific personal threat from this individual.

@Steigerworld I hate to tell you John it‚Äôs 2019.  Your head is still stuck in the 2970‚Äôs.  Those guys were great for their time and will always receive nothing but respect.

@AdamSchefterson Don‚Äôt you have something better to do for New Years Eve, your worst than the National Enquirer.  You guys only deal in gossip, never in the truth.  He‚Äôs not going anywhere, Steeler for life.  For the haters, if you weren‚Äôt there you don‚Äôt know sh!t.
@LesterTele @no1mate @TomFitton True.  All you have to look at is the Senate Intelligence Committee.  They have played a part in this Coup and are Deep State through and through.  Too many to list by name.  What‚Äôs sad is people continue to vote for them.
@wamandajd your destroying your party and the majority in this country see through your deceitful and divisive politics.
@wamandajd What‚Äôs sad is the people in her district believed her fairy tales enough to vote for her.  Going door to door promising the poor more benefits and freebies should be frowned upon.  Instead, the Left has showcased this political fraud as the future of the DNC.  Please keep it up..
@MichaelAvenatti @LindseyGrahamSC ‚ÄúBig Boy‚Äù, coming from the man who suffers with Napoleon complex.
@brianstelter Brian, the National Enquirer is more trusted than these hucksters.  Another secret  ‚Äúadministration officials‚Äù claim by the NYT, why is everyone afraid to reveal their names?  Let me guess, because they don‚Äôt exist.  You wouldn‚Äôt know ‚ÄúReal News‚Äù if it bit you on the behind.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Why don‚Äôt you bastards pass a real budget?  Of course you passed it, everyone wanted their vacation time.  It‚Äôs not about the money for the wall, hell, you guys piss off more than that on a daily basis.  It‚Äôs just resist the will of the people and President Trump.  Your cowards.
@KamalaHarris It‚Äôs Child Abuse to do this to children.  If I did it here in the states, I‚Äôd be in jail right now.  It‚Äôs the parents fault you idiot.  For once, blame the right people.  All they had to do was go to a port of entry.  They made that choice, not me not you not the Border Patrol.
@KamalaHarris Bad things happen to children when you drag them through the desert for unknown miles.  No water for three days=DEATH.  It gets really cold at night in the desert=DEATH.  Hardly any food for thousands of miles plus the walk itself=DEATH.  Add any existing medical problems=DEATH.
@Ocasio2018 I thought enough people in New York would have the common sense to see through this woman.  You guys know everything she promised won‚Äôt come true, you had too.  She needs another 20-30 years of reality before she‚Äôs capable of representing her district.  I‚Äôm trying to be nice here

@RepSwalwell Wall = Flat Tax on all remittances the Illegal Invaders send home.  They can pay for the build and maintenance.  They send all their money home to their families and then collect welfare benefits on us.  Enough is enough, time for them to pay.  Time for you to work for America.
@RepSwalwell Another Swalwell lie...
@cephalocide @AntiFashGordon @NYCAntifa You Snowflakes are all the same, trust me if you work for someone they are the higher authority.

@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @CongressmanHice @RepScottPerry should be charged a Flat Tax based on the amount being sent.  This would serve as a penalty for violating our immigration laws.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @CongressmanHice @RepScottPerry Border Wall = Make the Illegal Invaders pay to build it and maintain it.  Pass a Flat Tax on every remittance they send home.  They send all their money home to their families and then receive welfare benefits.  Every international money order and bank wire sent by non-citizens.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS @FoxNews @seanhannity Border Wall = Tax the damn Illegal Invaders when they send their remittances home.

@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs Charge the Illegal Invaders a Flat Tax Rate on all remittances they send home.  They can pay to build it and to maintain it in the future.  Every week they send all their money home to their families.  Then they receive welfare benefits on our dime.  You tax all money orders...
@RepMattGaetz If it‚Äôs one thing you guys do well is taxation and regulation.  This would also be z punishment for violating our immigration laws.  They send all their money home every week then turn around and receive welfare benefits.  Enough is enough.
@RepMattGaetz There is a way for the Illegal Invaders to pay for and maintain the wall.  You need to have your colleagues introduce a bill calling for a Flat Tax Rate on all remittances they send home.  All international money orders and bank wires for non-citizens would pay this tax.
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan This would build the wall and then maintain it.  One thing our government is great at is Taxation.
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan Wall=Flat Tax Rate on all remittances sent abroad by the Illegal Invaders.  All international money orders and bank wires would be charged this tax for non-citizens.  If they can send all their money home and then live on our welfare system, they can pay a tax on their earnings.
New Shiny Wall=Flat Tax on all remittances sent abroad by the Illegal Invaders.  They can pay to build it and maintain it in the future.  Every week they get paid (often under the table or under illegal I‚Äôd) and send it home.  We need to Tax this income.

@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump One thing our government is great at is tax regulation and recovery.  These people work and send non taxed income abroad on a weekly basis.  It would also serve as a punishment for violating our immigration laws.
@LouDobbs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump There is a way to have  the Illegal Invaders build the wall and maintain it.

@charliekirk11 Let the Illegal Invaders pay for the wall.  Congress must pass a bill that calls for a Flat Tax on every remittance sent abroad.  Every international money order and bank wire sent home.  Why should the American Taxpayer have to pay when these Invaders can build the wall and ....
@AntiFashGordon @NYCAntifa Before you destroy a persons livelihood you might want to think twice about that decision.  When you back someone into a corner, you might be the one who ends up on the wrong end of things.  They might bite back harder and you end up dead.  Take everything away at your own peril.
@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, we already know the Uni-Party and Wall Street will never allow this to happen.
@realDonaldTrump You need to pass  a Remittance Flat Tax on all international money orders and bank wires sent by Illegal Invaders.  This tax would not only build the wall and maintain it, it would cost the American Taxpayer nothing.  One thing our government knows how to do is tax and regulate.
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt worry they don‚Äôt send cash for fear of it being stolen in their postal services.
@realDonaldTrump All international money orders and bank wires would be charged a flat tax on the percentage.  This would also serve as a financial punishment for violating American immigration laws.
@realDonaldTrump We can make the Illegals pay for the wall and the upkeep and maintenance right now.  It‚Äôs time to levy a Tax on their remittances home.  With the proper regulation and recovery efforts, the American Taxpayer won‚Äôt have to spend a dime.
@NurseBeth3 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr All that has to happen is a Tax on their remittances.  They all send international money orders or wire their funds abroad.  With a little regulation and tax recovery the illegals would pay for everything.  Hell you could pay for most other border patrol expenses.
@NurseBeth3 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr It won‚Äôt cost American taxpayers a dime.
@NurseBeth3 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr We can even make them upkeep and maintain the wall forever.
@NurseBeth3 @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr We could make the Illegals pay for the wall today, it‚Äôs really easy.  However, the Uni-Party and Washington D.C. won‚Äôt place our needs above theirs.
Unfortunately, the Uni-Party that is Washington D.C. will never do something that makes sense and looks after Americans First.....
systems.  You can make regulations that will cover ways they would try to get around the system.  If there is one thing our government is good at, is the ability to regulate tax and recovery.  This way not only saves the Taxpayers a dime, it also punishes the criminal invaders.

@KamalaHarris Who‚Äôs going to pay for that?  Do you idiots ever think before you open your mouths?  Of course it won‚Äôt come out of your pocket.  We already pay for their K-12, if they want more education they can pay for it like I have had to do.  You‚Äôll say anything for a damn vote.
@RepSwalwell Don‚Äôt you have anything to do,?  I‚Äôm sure the poor idiots in your district would rather see you working on their behalf, than posting on Twitter all day.  Your like a 12 year old girl spreading gossip 24 hours a day.  Grow the f@ck up Eric...

You guys eat your own really quick.  You thought Tucker took you to the woodshed, wait till Antifa gets a hold on you...
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Creepy is a Liberal to the bone, they have to destroy anyone who challenges them and shows how small and petty they are.  Tucker put a label that perfectly describes the man.  Now he‚Äôs driven with hatred and rage, that‚Äôs how Liberals deal with things.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Poor Creepy gets owned and now wants to take  Tucker‚Äôs livelihood away.  I think someone kicked Creeps a$$ in middle school, I mean really bad.  So he paid (all the money he conned from his family) a big high schooler to not only beat the kid really bad, but to break his legs too
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The only Mob family in action is your family Eric.  You might as well put the poor man out of his misery, but you won‚Äôt because you want to inflict as much pain and misery as you can.  He‚Äôs an outsider and you guys will never allow this to happen again.  Your a pathetic con man.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump This coming from a Foot Soldier in the DNC criminal family.  It‚Äôs amazing you guys all make $174,000 to $223,500 per year.  Stay there for life and retire with several $100,000,000‚Äôs.  You guys are doing everything in your power to absolutely destroy Trump and his family.
@RepSwalwell future where are children arefree from your chains.
@RepSwalwell Democracy after just two years.  How detrimental do you think 535 individuals with unlimited terms might be?  Eric, you are part of a much larger and more dangerous stain on our Republic.  But you are correct, we must not become so jaded by your corruption that we fail to see a..

@RepSwalwell Trump‚Äôs corruption?  Scrub?  The only stains of corruption come from decades of Congressional Lifer‚Äôs pillaging the coffers of our Nation.

@brianstelter CNN and Stelter love to utilize various Propaganda techniques handed down by history‚Äôs greatest Despots.
@brianstelter ....and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.  Definitely Brian‚Äôs Favorite.
@brianstelter CNN‚Äôs #1 Propaganda Tool and Brian Stelter‚Äôs personal favorite:  the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily;  ....

@SampathPanini @jimmaiella @brianstelter @TIME @efelsenthal @ReliableSources Crowdstrike doesn‚Äôt count because it‚Äôs a private company.  Does the resistance from the DNC (not willing to let law enforcement look at the server) cause any concern for the Left?  Until a government agency examines the server, there is no hack.  The whole case will be thrown out
@SampathPanini @jimmaiella @brianstelter @TIME @efelsenthal @ReliableSources Not quite, since the DNC has never allowed the FBI, DOJ, or any other governmental agency access to the server.  Until this happens, the shot you claim is just a blank.  You would think the Left would want the worlds preeminent law enforcement agency (FBI) involved in this matter
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @THR Another example of the Lefts constant attack on Free Speech.

@KamalaHarris Instead of wasting $155+ billion per year on welfare benefits for illegal aliens, we should spend that money on the wall (wall=saving $155 billion per year), health care for Americans, infrastructure for Americans and sensible environmental matters.  If only Kampala really cared.

@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate I‚Äôll pray for your parents, that you‚Äôll either marry or get a job.  Unfortunately, you have a mental disorder called Trump Derangement Disease.  It‚Äôs fatal so ill still pray for you, even though you don‚Äôt believe in a Creator.
@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate Your an early 20‚Äôs Snowflake that probably lives on the coast.

@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate I hope you can find some peace in your heart that‚Äôs not tied to someone‚Äôs destruction.  Anyway, like it or not, you have to share this country.
@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate Listen to yourself, your the one who wants control.  You guys are Authoritarian in nature.  You can‚Äôt say this, you can‚Äôt think that, you can only do what I think is right.  Your no better than those old White Guys you hate so much.  Life is too precious to be eaten up with hate.
@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate You also have absolutely zero understanding what a Civil War in this country would look like.  The cities would eat themselves alive, try to leave and you‚Äôll deal with guys like me.  I‚Äôve been there and done that, you?
@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate You guys have too much hate.
@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate What you don‚Äôt understand is they all (both parties) have done this to our (even though you don‚Äôt believe I should have a say) country.  It‚Äôs not just the GOP, it‚Äôs your guys too.  I‚Äôm just the honest one here.  If it goes to a Civil War, I‚Äôll stand with the Conservatives.

@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate You sound like one of those White Progressive Liberals who hate the color of their own skin.

@DeniseMMurray @Swrobles @JosephJFlynn1 @mflynnJR @BarbaraRedgate That‚Äôs all you guys have is hate in your hearts, you call for diversity yet always show your true colors.

@thehill Why is it so hard for Liberals to see the truth.  It‚Äôs like the Truth is the color Red and when seen causes there vision to blur.  To clear this discrepancy up, Liberals pull out their Democrat issued glasses so they might see blue again.
@thehill I‚Äôm sure she lives in a beautiful GATED Community.  Her property more than likely has a Tall, Thick and Strong WALL.  Behind that Wall, I‚Äôm sure she has Armed Security.  If someone trespassed all the way to her front Door.  I‚Äôm sure her Security would take some sort of action.

@Majestik12 @TomFitton @Aaron70780527 @gatewaypundit You guys are sad...
@Majestik12 @TomFitton @Aaron70780527 @gatewaypundit And you could be there when it happy and would still deny it because the truth doesn‚Äôt matter to people like you.  The only truth you believe in is the one the Democratic Party tells you to believe.  You can look at a red crayon, pull out your Democrat issued glasses and see blue

@MoozhanT @Topdawg_ejc @Jim_Jordan But when do Libs care about the truth, it‚Äôs only used when it‚Äôs convenient....
@MoozhanT @Topdawg_ejc @Jim_Jordan as a political football....
@MoozhanT @Topdawg_ejc @Jim_Jordan Those that don‚Äôt know history are doomed to repeat it.  Your beloved Ocan‚Äôtdowrong administration had complete control of Washington D.C. when he was elected.  The Messiah chose to not lift a finger for his Hispanic brethren, instead he and his den of Vipers continue to use them

@djchubakka @brianstelter @MattMackowiak Even Larry King, might be before your time, recently said CNN was no longer a news channel.  It‚Äôs just Anti-Trump news 24/7, MSNBC is also the same thing.  The Left is no different, you just can‚Äôt admit it.
@djchubakka @brianstelter @MattMackowiak Then I guess your TV only gets Fox, Harvard University has analyzed ALL the other news media and its 93% negative (Anti President Trump).  Of course, you like to be told (programmed) what to think.  Your feelings (Libral Bias) can‚Äôt handle the chance that you might be wrong.
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey Dream on my friend...
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey always be a fool.  Take off the rose colored glasses the state requires you to wear.  Question things, look beyond your partisan source of limited propaganda...
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey The DOJ and FBI investigates themselves.  The establishment always protects itself.  Trump won‚Äôt Declassify because they are threatening Obstruction charges.  I have no dog in this fight, they are all crooks.  If you are too lazy too research everything on your own you will...
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey Apparently your from another planet.  Investigation like this never see a real court.  The FISA court released a 99 page ruling on all the corruption going on regarding unauthorized use and abuse of the NSA databases.  It will never show up on The Hill or any other MSM source...
@brianstelter So Penny Wise, that‚Äôs how you got your start with balloons.
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey Is Government oversight.  The Committee investigators are all attorneys, trained to find corruption.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll back the Democrat Committees and every word the say.  Unfortunately, you guys are always blind when one of your guys does something.  However, you‚Äôll crucify us..
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey Unfortunately, the left and those conflicted and those corrupted will always hide behind Methods and Sources.  Those in charge of the DOJ and FBI, it matters not what parties in charge, will always defend the institutions and coverup any corruption.  Sometimes all you have...
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey haven‚Äôt read hardly anything.  Unlike you, Lady Justice isn‚Äôt blind.
@Telandria @MissKeefe @Comey Have you read any of the court and government documents.  Have you read the IG report, cover to cover, not just the summary.  Have you read the text messages, not the cut and paste crap in the MSM.  Have you read everything available to the public.  You and I already know you...
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley You as well.
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley He‚Äôs just a man who has a lot of strikes against him and there is a pattern of behavior that he‚Äôs running from.  Karma is a bitch...
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley I didn‚Äôt really catch your last tweet.  I‚Äôve taken the time to research the judgments and this new incident will require some more digging.  If the truth really matters to you, you‚Äôll take political party affiliations out of the equation.  That‚Äôs the biggest hurdle you face.
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley He‚Äôs an ambulance chaser, lots of theatrics but lacks the mind of real attorney.  Better Call Avenatti, because Saul‚Äôs minor league compared to #Basta
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley With the Trump judgement for legal fees.  That‚Äôs half a million, she‚Äôll be dancing for another 30 years.  Then add the unbelievable claims in the Kavanaugh hearings.  The guy is broke, he wants to run for President so he gets a huge payday.  Add it all up, lots of smoke.
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley I‚Äôve known lawyers like him.  A silver tongue can only get you so far.  Follow the money, it usually leads to the truth.  Multiple decisions against him for screwing over former partners.  Big judgment by the IRS.  Now this pops up, not to mention Stormy is getting stuck with....
@MichaelAvenatti @TMZ Wow, I guess if you tell yourself a lie over and over it becomes the truth.	Not much more to say....
@MichaelAvenatti @TMZ Have you lived with the abused women since January 2018?	#Basta- Yes, I‚Äôve been in a long term relationship with the Abused and lived together since then.	So your telling me this actress has played a role in a Right Wing Conspiracy?	#BastaTheVictim- Yes, Trump has orchestrated it
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley One shouldn‚Äôt tweet something if it has zero substance to add to a discussion.  If you have zero knowledge on a subject you should read instead of tweeting.  You might stumble upon the truth and change your current mindset.
@BullinsClaude @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley There you go, you just proved my point.  Instead of examining (main stream press not FOX sources) the evidence in regards to my post.  You go straight to calling me a purveyor of Conspiracy.  On a topic that has nothing to do with #BastaWomenBeater	You can see the court filings.
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley It‚Äôs all a vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The IRS got together with the Courts in California, the LAPD, the US Senate and conspired with Senator Grassley to destroy #Basta.  That feels about right.....
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley It‚Äôs sad reading these Tweets, if the Ambulance Chaser was a Conservative you guys would be calling for his head to roll.  You would cheer Antifa on when they stalked him home and made threats of violence.  Because he‚Äôs yours, you lie to yourselves and call it a Conspiracy...
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley You better start practicing your ability to hold on to the soap, a little guy like you will make a nice girlfriend on the inside.  IRS, Beating Women, fraud and Congressional Investigation.  Looks like a Tri-Fecta to me.  Start squeezing those glutes Basta.  #BastaGoingToJail
@MichaelAvenatti @TheFive Funny how the #MeToo warrior tried to destroy Justice Kavanaugh‚Äôs reputation with the help of the politburo.  How‚Äôs that BOOMERANG feel, kinda like miss timing an ambulance and getting your ass ran over.  Don‚Äôt worry the Left will help cover up your assault.  #BastaBeatsWomen
@RepSwalwell Also, please ask your friends on CNN and MSNBC to cover the defamation lawsuit Carter Page has against the DOJ and FBI.  About the fact he‚Äôs asking for no damages, just his destroyed reputation back.
@RepSwalwell But you won‚Äôt because you‚Äôll continue to hide behind Sources and Methods.  Keeping half the country in the darkness of your party‚Äôs fraud and deception.  Better known as the Russian Hoax...
@RepSwalwell Why don‚Äôt you support full transparency Commissar Swalwell?  How about you call for all FISA warrant and 302‚Äôs surrounding Carter Page (still no indictments for false claim of being a Russian Spy) and the Ohr‚Äôs role in this fraud against the FISA court.  Release everything...
@MichaelAvenatti I hope you know a ‚ÄúReal‚Äù attorney, you know what they say about representing yourself.  Only a fool...
@KamalaHarris There are American Children who don‚Äôt receive the multitude of services and care these children receive.  You have sex trafficking and others who prey on children.  You have to make sure the real guardians are who they say they are.  I hate to tell you Americans see through you..
@SaraCarterDC ‚ÄúThis link may be unsafe‚Äù  it might contain truth
@SaraCarterDC Really sad Twitter tries to scare people away from Sara Carters article by saying it‚Äôs a scam or malicious content.  Way to go Twitter, more suppression against Conservative content.
@RepSwalwell @snopes @DailyCaller Gun owners have the right to safety too, it‚Äôs called the Second Amendment.  When Tyrants like Swalwell decide to confiscate our guns, We the People have the God given right to say no.  Swalwell, just keep screwing up your district and state.  Leave the rest of us alone...
@RealTimers @RepSwalwell @ericswalwell @NancyPelosi She doesn‚Äôt even know what year it is,  she needs to go to a retirement home and you a mental facility.
@MichaelAvenatti I doubt you‚Äôll make #BastaWomenBeater
@THR @Cernovich #BastaWifeBeater
#BastatheWifeBeater
@Cernovich CNN will treat this like they treated Acosta.  Blame the women.  Mikey is a Chump.
@bobbyding2345 @Cernovich CNN will destroy the wife, poor Mikey is the victim of a Alt Right Conspiracy.  What a Chump...
@Cernovich We all knew you were a dirtbag, but beating on Women.  Your lucky your a Libtard, CNN will say it never happened.
@MichaelAvenatti With all that said, you will probably receive tremendous support from the deranged left.  Until then, keep chasing those ambulances and keep the comical accusations flowing.
@MichaelAvenatti You single handily sunk the Democrats pathetic efforts to smear and destroy Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh.  You‚Äôve swindled countless business partners, who have multiple judgments against you.  You have defrauded the U.S government and all tax payers by cheating on your taxes.
@MichaelAvenatti So your telling America an obnoxious ambulance chaser, who engages in fraud, tax evasion and exhibits creepiness like no other is the right man for the job.  You failed Stormy, poor thing will probably be dancing and acting in porn the rest of her life.  	 ...to be continued
Hey Mikey, I just heard an ambulance in the distance....
