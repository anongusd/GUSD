@nafeezi Foolish
@thecableng @MBuhari Who cares did they vote for Buhari in 2015.who cares how they feel
@codshalom77 @vanguardngrnews Where is the igbo solidarity for one of your own Eminently qualified kingsley moghelu to rule. I am bothered that majority of the igbo nation are shouting for PDP who is fielding  Northern as candidate.The man is regreting that he is an igbo man
@Donald_Duke Mr Tinapa you are a corrupt irredemabble irrendentist. your God father obasanjo the grand commander of looters can you call him that name.
@DemolaRewaju @MBuhari @greetingsmedia PDP can never rule Nigeria again. Like sponsor people to go and be jumping into the highway for trailers to climb over them it is the people's business to chose to die for thieves
@MathewOnoja3 @officialKolaO @MBuhari The foolishness of fools shall distroy them so says the Holy book.when a goat collects some sums of money and mention criminals to be his president and people like him.I laugh.
@segalink I taught  before now that you are responsible after I read your write up I don't have any respect  for you never again.
@DrJoeAbah Great woman.
@benmurraybruce @MBuhari You have minsters from every state of the federation. Head of service of the Nigeria is from where? You don't  know  anything about security  what else should  I expect  from you all you know is all about Beauty  peagents following your track record over the years.
@chiefow @bukolasaraki what is your own script?
@bukolasaraki Just as you have done so far, cutting the budget of 🔑 key projects like the second  Niger Bridge, iron ore rail line to Ajakuota  steel plant, Lagos Ibadan  road, East West road etc. Delayed budget passage.
@MrStanleyNwabia @bukolasaraki You are shouting saraki not even ashamed of yourself.The man saraki is he from the East? A corrupt 👨 man true and true amongst so many other https://t.co/6H2R8rW6fU he more qualified than Kingsley moghalu.Yiu don't remember Ndi igbo now all you hypocrites.
@renoomokri @MBuhari In the military Seyefal should by now proceed on retirement training since he is due to retire next year
@renoomokri @MBuhari I know alot of reasonable  people would prefer that a competent person should be made to occupy a position, to when your master  and his party PDP looted Nigeria https://t.co/Cern5iadkb comments that make sense not tribal sentiments that you are promoting.
@benmurraybruce @MBuhari You don't  tell him where to appoint his security chief https://t.co/ETJ3Z6RImW senator you don't just talk because  you just want to talk.Alot of people have been saying you don't have any constituency projects to show the people. Quit the social media.
@OfficialPDPNig @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @officialKolaO @UcheSecondus @atiku @renoomokri @GovAyoFayose @GovWike @AWTambuwal @bukolasaraki @enoidem1964 What is the business  of busy body looters institute PDP. Defeat him next year if you can, not with filmsy nonsense excuses.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @OfficialAPCNg @TheEconomist @OfficialPDPNig Wake from your nightmare that lnstitute of 😂 looters called PDP will defeat President Buhari in 2019
@SKSolaKuti Show proof of  🐶 Dogara picking the PDP form.

@bukolasaraki @OfficialPDPNig False camaraderie wait till after the primaries of pop before you can then say the word commadarie
@DeleMomodu Why do want him to waste his 💰 money? What kind of miracle  do you want him to perform  in how many months?
@MBuhari Greatest president.i wish you long life, good health,success in next year elections.
@kcnaija What about your state in the East?
@Maybeks you igbo talk without thinking you celebrate the thieves  in your region.	Who have not done anything to advance your region always quick to call Tinubu names.
@benmurraybruce You and your PDP are worse.What have you done in Bayelsa state.
@nicholasibekwe Just got tired of you igbo people.
@AyannaPressley I love you for loving  God.
@renoomokri @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo Before  the Elections of https://t.co/fqMYwukWaR many Bullion trucks left CBN. What about the PDP red color filled with dollars envolpes you were sharing  round the country.

@OlayinkaLere @codshalom77 The whole world saw how you rescued  the people of Ekiti state.
@ProfOsinbajo @PremiumTimesng Sir, you are not on the same level with Atiku.When he was the Vice president why didn't  him and his boss Obasanjo restructure  Nigeria then.Wailer like Yinka odumakin and their gang didn't  force Jonathan  to restructure  Nigeria.
@SKSolaKuti Think before you tweet
@kcnaija How much did your PDP looters collect whilst in office as president. O wailer
@john_danfulani @SKSolaKuti I now see why you wrote the nonsense  you wrote about president Buhari. You are proud that you belong to the institute  of looters called PDP.
@AriyoAristotle @codshalom77 @ProfOsinbajo What have you done for any poor person. Why complain over nothing.
@codshalom77 @officialKolaO Shakaru is gone from your fold,you have lost your only hope of sharing Kano with Buhari
@codshalom77 @MobilePunch Christians don't  make such comments.
@FoxNews Rest in peace
@ynabena @Zahrahmusa Tell that to the dogs
