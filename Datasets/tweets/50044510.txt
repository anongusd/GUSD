Republicans at the #HouseOversight hearings are ferociously shredding #MichaelCohen's credibility, but in so doing raise an uncomfortable question: if Cohen is such a lowlife scum, why did @realDonaldTrump continue to employ &amp; trust him for more than a decade?
Amazing, isn't it, that 44 of the 47 Senate Democrats voted AGAINST the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. We hear, and discuss, highlights and lowlights of this revealing Senate debate:	https://t.co/WnDLkAe7aZ
This could be described as the "Share the Wealth" #Oscars. All major contenders (#BlackPanther, #BlackKlansman, #TheFavourite, #Roma, #Greenbook, #BohemianRhapsody, #AStarIsBorn) won significant awards. Even the lame, overrated #Vice won the only award it deserved: best makeup.
Is it possible that @GreenBook won its surprise victory for #BestPicture because a few environmentally sensitive Academy voters, who didn't bother to watch all the films, thought it was a message movie about combating climate change?
The victory for #OliviaColman as Best Actress will (besting #GlenClose &amp; #LadyCaga) counts as one of  the greatest #Oscar upsets in history. I was not a fan of #TheFavourite, but Colman's heartfelt, stunned, touching acceptance speech made her triumph a sweet surprise.

@RadioFreeTom @rosco Absolutely right, Tom.  Fortunately, I believe that the beard makes him far less punchable.
One of the dumbest lines of the moment: "Only women candidates get asked about their #likeability. Men never do." Really? Ask #AlGore, #TedCruz, #JohnKerry, #MikeDukakis, etc. Remember the old question, "would you like to have a beer with him?" Isn't that about likeability?

Something nostalgic &amp; old-fashioned about @SenSanders and his new campaign. No, it's not "new &amp; fresh" but old, familiar-- recycled promises of LBJ's "Great Society", offering "free" goodies to everyone, financed through the magic of "soaking the rich." Venezuela, here we come!
In @USATODAY, #ChrisTruax writes brilliantly: "Nothing can justify opening the door-even a crack- to the idea that a president is entitled to rule by decree when politics and our constitutional system of government become inconvenient." Amen &amp; Amen.
The Constitution's language is occasionally ambiguous, but what's ambiguous about this : "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law" (Article 1, Section 9)? NO money, it says; not even $8 billion for a big, beautiful border wall.
MISLEADING to say "no incumbent president has lost a primary challenge in his own party since Chester Arthur in 1884." First,: no primary system in 1884! Second, both #Truman in '52 &amp; #LBJ in '68 planned to run for reelection, but dropped out after weak showings in NH Primary.
@RadioFreeTom Sad! Tom, it's not a "banana republic" -- it's a "BANANAS republic".
Amazingly, @JohnKasich just spoke sensibly on @CNN about "Nat'l Emergency" declared by @realDonaldTrump and #Amazon driven from NYC. "We're not operating rationally in this country right now. That's what I'm concerned about," he said.He is totally right. Thank you, Governor.
@larrywilmore There already is a big fence, made of steel (as @POTUS prefers) with see-through abilities and  spikes on top. And it didn't even cost $1.375 billion!

Why is it obscene and idiotic to declare a #NationalEmergency over the border? Because there is NO Nat'l Emergency- by every standard the border is more secure than it was ten years ago, even 20 years ago. This is a despicable political stunt that subverts the Constitution.

Amen, Max. We just replayed on air the audio of her disgraceful (and brain dead) attack on "Mr Adams" (as she called him). At least her performance removed all doubt she should be dropped from the Foreign Affairs Committee. https://t.co/iAAk7GhLhe
Props to @charlescwcooke for his brilliant piece in @NRO about the laughably gauzy "Green New Deal."  On today's show I cited  his column and gave @senatemajldr appropriate credit for wanting to force a vote on AOC's inane wish list: https://t.co/SbORtHyZal
Yes, Rep Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) should be dropped from House Foreign Affairs Comm, but hope she doesn't resign. Republicans should go after her seat, and make her the Democratic "poster girl" in the GOP's national bid to take back the House in 2020. Let the Dems try to defend her!
Always a privilege to speak with Senator @BenSasse on my show.  Today, we discussed his important fight to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  Audio, here: https://t.co/hJHl9VaRsM
In responding to #BorderWallCompromise, @realDonaldTrump promises that he'll find another way to fund the rest of his wall, even without authorization by Congress. How? it's obvious: MEXICO will pay for it, remember?
Serious question: after shutting down govt for 35 days, @POTUS got LESS for the wall than Dems had offered before. So how would another useless, asinine #shutdown somehow get him MORE? Please, Mr. President, #TakeTheDeal!
Amen, Senator. Hope to welcom @SenSasse on the radio in the next few days. https://t.co/2aplRnAsSd
The great debate: @POTUS just said the border wall/shutdown issue is really "very simple." #HLMencken said: "For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong."

With @amyklobuchar &amp; @RepBetoORourke  both preparing to enter the race, it's more likely than ever that @JoeBiden wins the nomination. With a dozen candidates splitting the young &amp; fresh vote, Joe should hold the 30% (or more) who prefer somebody old &amp; stale-or at least familiar.
To cope with this latest revelation, I understand that #SenatorWarren is convening a serious pow wow involving her top staff. https://t.co/3DSuT1WUfy
Two big winners when (not "if" anymore) #ElizabethWarren drops out of the Presidential race:		1) @KamalaHarris --anyone still supporting Senator Warren most likely will go to her 		2) USA, spared any chance this divisive, dubious politico will come anywhere near the presidency.
Has anyone started investigating the state Treasurer? https://t.co/HEd5MYIvOe
Sure, @StaceyAbrams came across as sympathetic, with a formidable, articulate TV presence in her #SOTU response. But her laundry list of complaints, and tendency to blame Republicans for all problems, contrasted with #Trump's soaring optimism in a way that won't benefit Dems.
Sure, there were debatable points in #SOTU- it's wrong to suggest that "investigation" must inevitably block "legislation." But the White House guests were skillfully selected &amp; movingly presented; those emotional moments will register more deeply than any rhetorical excess.
For the most part, @realDonaldTrump sounded reasonable and serious in #SOTU- so much so that if Dems fail to reach a sane compromise on border security within 10 days, they'll be blamed for the shutdown or "declaration of emergency" that follows.
Congratulations to @POTUS on the most constructive, best-delivered speech of his presidency.He was warm, dignified, self-assured-a far cry from the angry ranter of tweets-and-rallies. If this more Presidential Trump keeps showing up,he'll be a formidable favorite for re-election.
The separate response to #SOTU by the venerable @SenSanders makes it clear why Democrats emphasize impassioned opposition to @POTUS over any positive agenda of their own. #TrumpHatred is, in fact, the only priority than can possibly unite this deeply divided party.
It's sickening that @BernieSanders insists on delivering his own response to #SOTU. What, @staceyabrams isn't radical enough for him? Another demonstration of the increasingly unhinged and fractured state of the Democratic Party.
He certainly counts as a leading candidate for US Senate's MVP -- Most Virtuous Politician. Proud of you, Senator Sasse. https://t.co/zRyjaK0any

How could @RalphNortham, as a med student in '84, feel so proud of his Klan/blackface photo,he posted it in his yearbook? Could it relate to his Democratic Party's Senate leader at the time- RobtByrd- who not only wore KKK garb in his youth but rose to rank of "Exalted Cyclops"?
Who deserves more condemnation? 		A) A medical student in 1984 who posts a despicable blackface/KKK photo in his yearbook, or		B) A sitting Governor who defends legalized infanticide?  		My guess is MSM will choose A), but that's the wrong answer.

I get that Dems, above all, don't want to give Trump a victory. But they'll be doing just that, if they continue fighting any form of #PhysicalBarrier at the border. One way or another, he WILL add some additional fencing to supplement the 650 miles of it that already works well.
On #PhysicalBarriers on southern border: #Dems have gone from stubborn to ridiculous. What moral issue is even arguably involved in opposing ALL fences (or walls), even where they clearly work? This extremism is also politically moronic:the public doesn't support them on this!
The big argument for #HowardSchultz: if the only choice is #Trump and, say, @KamalaHarris, then tens of millions will want someone else to vote for. Problem with that: it's much too early to concede that some crazy leftist (and Trump) will win their parties' nominations.

So, the substance of the deal: #Trump agrees to re-open the govt (what Dems have demanded all along) &amp; to turn over the job of enhancing border security to a bi-partisan commission. Why couldn't #Trump have offered such a sensible solution in, say, the 1st week of his presidency?
If @realDonaldTrump does announce a workable deal to end the shutdown, who cares how @AnnCoulter &amp; the "right wing echo chamber" react? Only mainstream media are obsessed with that reaction: in order to make #Trump &amp; conservatives look fringy &amp; weak.
Alas, @POTUS is late in delivering the eagerly-awaited news that he's agreed to end the shutdown. Actually, about 33 days late.
Great question. Of course, the estimable Mr. Stone also, has a long association with the Libertarian Party. By the way, in 2008, Trump was quoted in the New Yorker saying: "Roger Stone is a stone cold loser"; he had briefly advised Trump in his aborted 2000 presidential campaign. https://t.co/rbQxXuqWks

Bravo, really, to @realDonaldTrump for agreeing to postponement of the #SOTU-- a good indication that he's finally serious about ending the stupid #shutdown. Unless Dems are truly monomaniacal economy wreckers they should now negotiate a common sense deal that helps everybody.
@TheGeeScott Thanks for the kind words, Gee.
No, @SpeakerPelosi didn't "cancel" #SOTU: she demanded postponement (till shutdown idiocy ends) or a change of venue. @POTUS could rise to her challenge by ending shutdown NOW (while continuing debate on divisive issues) &amp; staging on-time SOTU to celebrate new, cooperative spirit

Today's the day: If #EdgarMartinez, greatest DH in #MLB history, gets into the #BaseballHallofFame today (as he obviously should), it will make up for a lot of stupidity &amp; bad news on other fronts that we're sure to hear about.
@BSBVAULT A no-doubter!
Media treated well-behaved #CovingtonBoys as thugs, blameworthy for a "dangerous confrontation". Worse, they turned a non-violent exchange into crime &amp; horror. Media regularly exaggerate catastrophic nature of every incident. It's not a news business. It's a bad news business.
What was so "scary &amp; menacing" about the "confrontation" at the #LincolnMemorial? Nothing. Kentucky school boys, Native American activists, even #BlackIsraelites exercised 1st Amendment rights with non-violent restraint. Only media messed up-by rushing to unwarranted conclusions.
For some on the left, the mere act of wearing a #MAGA cap may be offensive, but the episode in front of the #LincolnMemorial should remind us all that even in times of intense polarization, not everybody who disagrees with you is a bad guy, and not all on your side are saints.
To paraphrase #DrKing: "Judge people on the content of their character, not the color of their...#MAGA caps." It was wrong to condemn Kentucky school boys of #CovingtonCatholic without any evidence of bad behavior-as if political leanings mattered more than personal conduct.

Is the @BuzzFeed story a smoking gun, fatal for @realDonaldTrump? Hardly, but it is more serious than prior charges. My take, here: https://t.co/jiOkIrHI0E
2 reasons that the @BuzzFeed charges are more serious than prior attacks: 1) the alleged felonious acts (suborning perjury) occurred while #Trump was president, not before &amp; 2) the source of these charges is NOT @MichaelCohen212 but, allegedly, "federal law enforcement officials"
On new charges that #Trump, AS PRESIDENT, asked @MichaelCohen212 to lie about Russia: even Trump loyalists must acknowledge that these charges,IF true, are impeachable. And Trump critics must acknowledge: the @BuzzFeed story isn't nearly enough to embrace the charges as accurate.
Big announcement! @SenBobCasey (D-PA) just stunned the political world with the shocking revelation he will NOT run for President! Why so shocking? No one even knew (or dreamed) he was considering a race for the White House.

Why is it suddenly inappropriate to view the difference between citizen &amp; non-citizen as a meaningful distinction? My grandparents celebrated when they became naturalized citizens! Erasing the distinction doesn't honor immigration; it dishonors citizenship &amp; Americanization.
In the  #shutdown debate, slogan #WallsWork should be replaced with #WallsHelp, It's dishonest to suggest a new wall solves all problems or ends illegal immigration. But also wrong to claim physical barriers won't HELP, denying their necessary role in enhanced border security.
Collusion is not a crime — but conspiracy is. Former prosecutor @AndrewCMcCarthy provides necessary perspective on the latest Manafort revelations, Michael Cohen’s coming testimony, &amp; more. Our conversation starts ~ 22 minutes into today’s show. Listen: https://t.co/QPG6jm6H8c
I hate the idea of #Trump declaring a #NationalEmergency but I've got to admit it might put him in a stronger position. He's helped if the debate shifts to arguments on whether an emergency exists, but he's hurt if we argue over whether the wall's the best (or only) solution.
Dems can make a strong case that the border isn't an "emergency" but they can't (and shouldn't) deny that it's a real problem. If they insist a #BorderWall won't help that problem, then they should put forward other solutions that would work better to improve the situation.
Why is #BorderWall compromise so difficult? Because this isn't an ordinary argument about rival solutions to an acknowledged problem, but a core dispute over whether a problem even exists. Dems should acknowledge the border IS a mess, and suggest some better ways to fix it.

Now's the time: I've suggested it before, but in light of the current obsession with #Shutdown politics, those who want to eliminate the name #Redskins from DC's NFL team ought to consider a new moniker: #TheWashingtonShutdowns.
@EsotericCD no one should applaud AOC on anything, ever...but the more that those of us on the conservative side choose to criticize, or at least correct her, the more the left feels the instinct to rally to her defense. the best policy, seems to me: ignore the ignorant ninny.
Dems, be honest: even if #Trump got all $5billion for border security, would it truly be a disaster for America? And for Trumpsters: even if he got NOTHING for the wall,would the US be badly damaged?Answer to both questions: obviously no-so split the difference, get back to work.

If @POTUS declares a Nat'l Emergency and orders the military to build his wall, what can Democrats do in response? I'll speak with #RepAdamSmith (D-WA), new chair of House Armed Services Committee, on my radio show today (3 PM ET)
In history of #impeachment, why was #Nixon different, driven from office? The crisis climaxed in the midst of '74 midterm campaign (in which GOP ultimately lost 5 Sen seats, 48 in House!) In a desperate bid to mitigate looming disaster, Senate leaders begged Nixon to resign.
Dem #impeachment dreams: utterly unrealistic. In both #AndrewJohnson &amp; #Clinton impeachment trials, NOT ONE Senator of the President's party voted to remove him from office. To dump #Trump, Dems would need at least 20 GOP Senators to join them (if they held solid). No chance!
If  we face a #NationalEmergency that requires a wall, then when did that crisis begin? We had more unauthorized border crossings in 2016 than today,so why didn't Trump push the wall in the two yrs the GOP controlled both Houses- rather than waiting for hostile Dems to take over?

History shows Dem #Impeachment obsession is currently a destructive waste of time. This process has never succeeded without BIPARTISAN support--only time a President was driven from office (Nixon), 7 of 17 GOP members of House Judiciary Comm voted to impeach (on Abuse of Power).
How could GOP gain 2 Senate seats while losing 2/3 of the races and lost the popular vote 59%-39%? The Dems were defending so many more seats (24) than Republicans (only 9). GOP won't have this favorable map in 2020 or '20 &amp; desperately need a broader-based,more positive message.
Final results on '18 midterms show SENATE numbers even worse for GOP than the House! Dems won 22 Senate races (11 for GOP), taking 59% of total popular vote. In House, Dems won at least 235 races (GOP at most 200), and 53% of total popular vote. Little encouragement for GOP!

In comments at WH, @POTUS echoes this morning's tweet,saying "You can't impeach somebody who's doing a good job." Actually, you CAN -but you SHOULDN'T. Nixon was doing a good job on big issues-particularly foreign policy-but they were about to impeach him if he hadn't resigned.
In today's remarks, @POTUS says again &amp; again, "if we build a wall, they won't even come, they won't even try"-meaning no one will attempt to enter US illegally. But the majority who now enter without authorization, do so as visa over-stayers - so a wall has no impact whatever.

Amazing! Rep #LizCheney (R-WY) took a bold, courageous stand in favor of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote! The whole GOP stood up and applauded -- appropriate, since Republicans were more responsible for winning women's suffrage than were the Dems
In support of "NDP" as he called her, the very formidable Rep #HakeemJeffries (Dem NY) just gave a better speech than #Pelosi herself has ever delivered
New Senate being sworn in: youngest member is the great conservative #JoshHawley (R-MO), who just turned 39. The oldest Senator is 85-yr-old #DianneFeinstein (D-CA). Good news about DiFi- she could be the only Democratic Senator who is NOT running for President.
@EsotericCD Gotta consider #LadyGaga on the basis of her soon-to-be Oscar-nominated role in "A Star Is Born"
How does 78-yr-old #NancyPelosi, who was sworn in as new #Speaker the last time some 12 yrs ago (under Bush), represent the bold new directions/bipartisan cooperation, that most Americans say they want? It feels like "DejaVu, all over again" (as #YogiBerra would describe it).
Question for Trump's base: did you believe him when he said he'd make Mexico pay for the #BorderWall? If not, then why did you cheer him when he said it, again &amp; again? If you did believe him, then wasn't it a gross deception, showing how little he respects his own supporters?
In his rambling WH discourse, @POTUS just said regarding #Afghanistan that "the Russians were right to be there" -suggesting they were going after terrorists not, in fact, advancing their #EvilEmpire. This contradicts the assumptions of not only Reagan &amp; Bush, but even of Carter.
Yes, @MittRomney sent a clear message that he won't be another mindless pawn, unquestioningly defending every Trumpian quirk. But the most constructive way to do that would be to exert independent leadership to end the stupid #shutdown - better than an op ed in WaPo.
Congratulations to @SenWarren on her new "exploratory committee"! Perhaps she'll follow the noble example of famous explorers of 500 years ago, and, somehow, accidentally, stumble upon the discovery of America.

Isn't it obvious that "cutting off all aid" to starving, violence-torn Central American countries (as #POTUS has promised to do until he gets his wall), would send thousands more destitute people to our border, desperate to overcome any fence (or wall)?
Just a simple question: if @POTUS really does "close the border" as he promises to do, shutting down all legal immigration and commerce, wouldn't that create pressure for vastly more illegal immigration and illegal commerce?
Obvious deal to end stupid #shutdown: Dems give Trump the money for the wall, he gives them a #Dreamers fix. Another idea:find the funds for border security,then match that, dollar for dollar, with Central American aid to stop future waves of desperate migrants before they begin.
When @POTUS travels to Iraq to support the troops, that's great, sure. But when he tells them, "We're no longer the suckers, folks!" isn't he implying that all who served prior Commanders-in-Chief were suckers themselves to do so? Is that appropriate?
Among liberal message movies, @vicemovie is worse than expected, but @onthebasisofsex is better. VICE is a joyless hatchet job wasting a talented cast. Sure, #RuthBaderGinsburg film is reverential to its subject, but it's also a touching portrait of a loving, functional marriage.
For those who believe @realDonaldTrump can do no wrong, how is it smart to taunt the world's most evil killers by repeating, endlessly:"We have totally destroyed ISIS!" This can only encourage them, like slasher movie villains, to re-emerge from death with murder weapons in hand.

Looking back on #Putin's positive reaction to @realDonaldTrump's #SyriaWithdrawl, what's most notable isn't that Vlad approved - of course he would. But in his statement, Putin didn't just praise "PresTump"; he hailed "Donald." First name basis shows a real desire to be buds, no?
More #POTUS trivia: presidents who appeared on 4 nat'l tickets: #GHWBush: VP, '80, '84. Pres '88, '92. #JohnAdams also 4 times: VP 1788, '92; Pres '96, 1800 (but before formal parties, nominations). They join 5-timers FDR &amp; Nixon, 3-timers Cleveland, WJBryan, arguably HenryClay.
Not sure I understand the logic behind #Trump prolonging the #shutdown. Why should he expect to get a better deal from the new Congress, with 40 more Dems in the House, than he could with the lame ducks, where GOP controls both houses. Why prolong the agony, as your side weakens?
Presidential Trivia: Only 2 men have been nominated as part of a national ticket five times. Who were they? FDR: for VP in 1920, for Pres in '32,'36,'40 &amp; '44. Also, amazingly, Richard Nixon: for VP in '52,'56; Pres '60, '68, '72. Both men won four of their races, lost only 1.
Which side's most irrational? Some in #GOP have been nutso to  demand a shutdown if they DON'T get a wall. Now Dems look even crazier by insisting on shutdown if we DO get a wall.Even if you think it's a wasteful, stupid project, how, exactly would more border wall damage the US?
The obvious choice as the #Mattis replacement; former Defense Secretary #RobertGates. He served both a GOP president (W.Bush) and a Democrat (Obama) with honor &amp; distinction. Would he even consider accepting a #Trump appointment.
What happens if #Turkey interprets Trump's #SyriaWithdrawal as a green light to begin slaughtering Kurdish fighters - with Russian air cover? What's the next step for the Mattis-free Trump administration. The prospects are horrifying-- hope the nightmares are averted.
The horror over the abrupt #SyriaWithdrawal is entirely appropriate, but the most troubling question isn't "why", it's "why now?" With govt careening toward bone-headed shutdown, why this disastrous decision, forcing the #MattisResignation, at this already fraught moment?
I'm pleased to be honored by the new Gryphon Editions version of my book--it gives THE AMERICAN MIRACLE the leather-bound, gold-embossed treatment that any author would appreciate. https://t.co/JZiw8PL2Ib https://t.co/KDH8lsmPw1
"There's absolutely no excuse to shut down government on this issue or any other issue" #SenatorSusanCollins, R-Maine		Bravo, Senator, and Amen!
Best thing to be said about a #Shutdown is "it'll only do MINOR damage to a few govt employees &amp; the economy...no biggie." But doing any damage at all to the private sector &amp; to any law abiding citizens for sake of a pointless political stunt isn't just pathetic, it's shameful.
What, in heaven's name, is the logic of doing a #BorderWall shutdown in order to delay a decision until after Dems take over in the House? Why should anyone expect a better outcome AFTER 40 more Dems take seats in Congress?
Congrats to @MickMulvaneyOMB, a great choice as new WH Chief of Staff. He's  already doing a fine job as head of OMB &amp; chief of CFPB. Now, even he'll only agree to take over as this year's #Oscars host, we'll really make America great again.
Caught up with @GreenBookFilm - a legitimate Oscar contender in multiple categories, particularly for the superb #MahershalaAli as Supporting Actor. His dazzling performance brings new life to a remarkable musician (and polymath): the late (and great) #DonShirley.
I'm so gratified that my book THE AMERICAN MIRACLE is a bestseller AGAIN--this time as an eBook. This is no doubt the result of the amazing bargain right now--$1.99 for the eBook on any platform. A great and inspiring treat for the holidays: https://t.co/iVntHvTjiS
The new movie #VICE, for all its critical acclaim and awards nominations, isn't so much a political biography as it is a monster movie - with #DickCheney (in an uncanny impersonation by #ChristianBale) devouring DC just as ruthlessly as #Godzilla destroyed Tokyo.
Very pleased to see multiple #Grammys nominations for Beethoven's "Eroica", with the superb #PittsburghSymphony &amp; their great maestro, #ManfredHoneck. From the talented-engineers at #ReferenceRecordings, surely one of the best-sounding Beethoven performances in a generation.
Beware #FakeNews, phony tweets, outright lies from any and all sources. #HannahArendt wites: "The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is someone for whom the distinction between fact &amp; fiction, true &amp; false, no longer exists."

The funeral service for #GHWBush was as noble &amp; remarkable as the man it honored. It was also deeply, unapologetically, Christian --a worthwhile reminder that neither the Bush family, nor the nation it has served, has ever been secular,
Apt &amp; important, always.... https://t.co/lS5UJi0eAM
Filing on #MichaelFlynn may be heavily redacted, but it's still revealing. #Mueller's request that Flynn get no jail time because his "assistance" was important, suggests he implicated someone more important than he was. Given Flynn's top post at NSC, who could that possibly be?
In all the tributes for #PresidentGHWBush, the same words keep turning up, citing his "goodness", "decency" and "kindness." In the last 10 yrs, since the other #PresidentBush left the WH, hard to think of another major politician who would evoke similar praise.
This line of questioning ("...too nice a guy") also goes with the wretched press harping on the "wimp factor" as being a handicap for GHWB. Considering his heroics as a Navy pilot, that's especially pathetic. https://t.co/eE4ABt2tnm

I've been enormously inspired by the magnificent new biography of #Churchill by @AndrewRoberts, #WalkingWithDestiny. To read of this gigantic life in this era of pygmies, produces both hope of what leadership can be--and heartache for what it seems to be today.
I see @marclamonthill says he believes in 2 state solution with '67 borders. But since he's willing to kill for "free Palestine from the river to the sea" where would Israel exist? East of the river-in Jordan? Or in a man-made island in the sea? He's not just a liar, but a fool.
Attention political cartoonists (#DavidHorsey &amp; co.): With all today's attention on 2016 plans for "#TrumpTowerMoscow", some creative soul should do a rendering of a possible architect's vision for that proposed "8th Wonder of the World"
Most troubling part of #Trump comments this morning: his insistence there's "nothing wrong" in "running my business" while running for Pres. Nothing illegal, perhaps,but raises questions about priorities when, inevitably, nation's welfare clashes with personal business interests.
An old friend, @TheHRH (HeatherHiggins) has written a persuasive piece on how conservatives win in 2020: by not just rallying the base, but expanding it. She joins me of the radio show today.
Apparent victory for Sen @CindyHydeSmith in MS runoff is a big deal for the GOP. It means that for any future judicial appointments Dems would need 4 (!) GOP Senators to join them to block it. If @POTUS sticks to the #FederalistSociety list, that's not bloody likely.
@jpodhoretz Yeah, but come on: the idea that his "toeses were roses" is just fake news, John.
Of course, seeing destitute mothers and children choking on tear gas is upsetting, but what is the alternative on the border? To let protestors hurl stones at security personnel and climb the fence? The responsible authorities deserve credit for a limited, appropriate response.
At #WHPressBriefing, reporters pushed #JohnBolton relentlessly to listen to the #Khashoggi torture tape. They demand an emotional reaction, rather that  a rational calculation of national interest - and display the same priorities re' "tear-gassing kids" at the border.
Sen @cindyhydesmith must have led a near blameless life if the only scandal Dems use to smear her is a dumb off-hand remark about liking her host so much she'd accept his invitation to a "public hanging." Sure, insensitive; but so outrageous it should wreck an entire career?
As I've said on-air many times: every day should be the occasion for #Thanksgiving for those lucky souls who live in The Greatest Nation on God's Green Earth. But for any who pass up chances for daily gratitude, we still have this one, great national holiday to catch up!
The relevant question: what broke the Democrats' "100 years of futility" in 1932? Two factors: 1) major depression (duh!) &amp; 2) a supremely charismatic, effective nominee (FDR). Dems may be hoping for one (or both) of these factors to help them win in 2020.
Epic losing streak: for 100 yrs, between 1832 (Jackson) &amp; 1932 (FDR), NO Democrat POTUS nominee won clear majority (MORE than 51%) of popular vote. Only 1 hit 51%: Tilden/1876, but he lost the electoral college (disputed election). In same period, 10 GOP nominees won above 51%!
Every reason Jews should feel intense spirit of #Thanksgiving for this amazing nation where an Austrian bodybuilder (and former Gov) can serve breakfast to CA fire-fighters, and very comfortably use the Yiddish word "meshugenneh" (to describe #Trump's approach to the fires)&gt;
Among other things, when the president designates outstanding jurists #Gorsuch &amp; #Kavanaugh as #TrumpJudges, he only makes it more likely that they'll rule against Trump, to highlight their integrity &amp; independence.
#CJJohnRoberts is right: bad idea to label anyone as an "Obama Judge" or "Trump Judge." Did #JusticeBlackmun write Roe v. Wade as a "Nixon Judge"? Did #JusticeBreyer join the court majority as a "Clinton Judge" in tilting the election against AlGore in Bush v. Gore?
Amen, bro. https://t.co/pbHgzreW6b
Seasonal Fantasy from #DavidAltschuler: A US President says: "I'm  not pardoning a turkey,wasting tax-payer funds,citizens' time. No finer end for any turkey than gracing a grateful family's table, invigorating their purposeful lives. Why cheat a lucky bird of  this opportunity?"
The problem with the revered tradition of @POTUS pardoning a turkey for Thanksgiving is that it implies that turkeys have done something wrong-- wrong enough to deserve the death penalty and requiring a pardon to spare their lives.
Suddenly, a White House  headline that may not be controversial: "TRUMP PARDONS TURKEY".  Fortunately, this has nothing to do with the #Erdogan regime.
Turning against our murderous ally #PrinceMohammed in Saudi Arabia to uphold "morality", would echo the dumping of the morally compromised #Shah in 1979 Iran for the evil terrorists of the Islamic Republic. How does that benefit decency or advance the national interest?
On @CNN, #AlexMarquardt says #Trump's position on #SaudiArabia puts "money over morals." Actually, our links with the Saudis aren't just about $, they're also about nat'l security. Always easy to criticize #Trump, but what would US gain by undermining-or repudiating-this regime?
Bravo to @FoxNews &amp; #ChrisWallace for a tough but fair interview with @realDonaldTrump! The @POTUS may not have liked the questions, but they showed that for Wallace &amp; some of his colleagues, #FNC provides more than propagandistic, pro-Trump puffery.
The overall impression from the #MedalOfFreedom ceremonies has to be very positive, even unifying. @realDonaldTrump is clearly savoring the moment, and honoring a group of wonderful Americans who certainly deserve to be honored.
In honoring #ElvisPresley with his #MedalofFreedom, @realDonaldTrump beamed at his rendition of "How Great Thou Art." This is one of #Trump's favorite songs - especially when he thinks it's sung about him (rather than Him).
Totally appropriate and admirable that @realDonaldTrump honored the memory of #JusticeScalia with the #MedalOfFreedom. Also, good for @POTUS in being so gracious in acknowledging the sitting justices present for the honor: including #RBG, Kagan,Alito,Roberts, Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh.
To suggest that Dems only won the House because of voter fraud in '18 is just as stupid as to say that #Trump only won the White House in '16 due to Russian meddling. Exaggerating the problems of fraud doesn't make Trump &amp; GOP look strong; shows them as weak, ineffective.
During campaign in '16, @realDonaldTrump complained bitterly about rampant #VoterFraud. But if, after 2 yrs in power, he says fraud is just as bad as ever, who is he indicting? Better to say "we had a problem, now it's better, and we'll make more progress in yrs ahead."
No honest FL recount could possibly change outcome of FL Senate race! Of nearly 5,000 statewide races between 2000-15, only 3 saw outcomes reversed by recounts: WA '04; VT '06; MN '08. No recount shifted more than 440 votes; @SenBillNelson needs to shift more than 10,000 to win.
My favorite headline of the year: "SATANISTS BATTLE TV WITCH OVER GOAT-HEADED GOD" -- in @nytimes, about copyright lawsuit by #TempleOfSatan against that other temple of Satan (#WarnerBros) concerning "The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"

All the controversy swirling around "acting AG" #MattWhitaker raises one obvious question: why didn't @POTUS line up a permanent replacement for #JeffSessions before firing him? Sessions has been AG for nearly 2 yrs-why not take another few weeks for a less haphazard transition?

Intensely discouraging that @kyrstensinema has now taken a thin lead over @MarthaMcSally in the crucial AZ Senate race. It's not just that Martha deserves to win - she does - but that Sinema so richly, and profoundly, deserves to lose.
Anyone who really believes there's no real difference between left &amp; right when it comes to mobilizing mob psychology on behalf of ideology, think about this: an angry mob menaces the home of @TuckerCarlson, but #JimAcosta (fortunately!) has never provoked similar attacks.
Anyone with a soul wishes #JusticeGinsburg speedy, complete recovery and  many more yrs of service to our country. BUT this sad incident is a reminder of why GOP gains in the Senate mean more than our losses in the House: the Senate-not the House - confirms judicial appointments
I'm grateful for nearly 22 yrs with #SalemRadioNetwork and wish all my friends and colleagues only the best.
Regarding today's announcement of schedule changes on Salem Radio, I want to make it unequivocally clear that our show will continue, without interruption, 3-6 PM EST as always--and on a new network after January 1st. Also, we're launching a new history podcast. Stay tuned!

Glad to take credit for one of the big republican victories in Virginia — against Hollywood’s anti-American, anti-Israel candidate. Bigfoot helped deliver us from Leslie Cockburn. https://t.co/EhhrhJtDyd
News flash: in response to a question, #Trump just asked @MikePence if he'd repeat as the president's running mate. The VP stood up and nodded his agreement. Not a big surprise, but still significant.
The big take-away from questioners at @realDonaldTrump press conference is the obnoxious,inappropriate rudeness &amp; disrespect from prominent reporters. Don't they realize that this conduct only supports #Trump's complaints about unfair media bias?Like it or not,he's the president.
The Republicans have already locked up 199 seats in the House - 5 MORE than the Dems held before this election. #GOP is also likely to win at least 6 more seats half of those still unsettled -before the vote counting is done.
In his opening statement, @realDonaldTrump sounds shockingly pragmatic and reasonable--making an admirable plea for bipartisanship to "keep the American economic miracle going." Said nice things about #Pelosi. Right tone, right message. Good to see!
Extremely discouraging that last-minute votes from big cities (Bridgeport, Hartford) have flipped the results in CT - giving victory in the gubernatorial race to ultra-liberal @NewLamont over an able and pragmatic Republican, @bobforgovernor Stefanowski. Too bad, really!
For defeated Dems #Heitkamp, #Donnelly &amp; #McCaskill, the surprise isn't that they lost-- it's the margins that #GOPWinners piled up -- 10 points in both IN and ND; 5 points  in MO. These didn't turn out to be close races.l
Wouldn't it be stunning if @POTUS, in his post election press conference, announced he will fully, constructively cooperate with all investigations the Dems choose to launch with their new House majority. #Trump loves to confound his opponents;this approach would make them crazy.
Perspective is crucial: In their first midterms, @BillClinton lost 54 House seats, @BarackObama lost 63. Now @realDonaldTrump, in HIS first midterm, loses (at most!) 36 seats. Grading on a curve, he earns at least a "B" for limiting his party's House losses.
In one sense, #DemHouseTakeover may help #Trump. An economic downturn (or slow down) is almost inevitable at some point before Nov 2020. Now #Pelosi &amp; Pals will be around to share the blame.
Since he gave up his House seat &amp; didn't win for Senate, adoring Dems need to find #Beto a job as he plots to become #POTUS. How about chair of the DNC? Surely, the young Mr. O'Rourke could do a better job than the feckless #TomPerez.
Key message of results: old idea of "red" vs "blue states" no longer applies. Bluest states in US (VT, MA, MD, CT) gave GOP big wins on governorships; some of reddest states (KS, SC, OK) chose Dems in House or gov races. Local issues &amp; quality of candidates, still matter most.
New numbers in NV (with 75% of precincts reporting) show @SenDeanHeller down by 58,000 votes. Ouch! Looks bad for him, and for Guv candidate @AdamLaxalt. Too bad. Hope for a turnaround?
In MT, #MattRosendale pulled 3,000 votes ahead of incumbent Dem #JonTester, with 60% of votes reporting. If Rosendale holds on, along with #McSally in AZ, #RickScott in FL &amp; #Heller in NV, (all with current leads), #GOP would get 56 Senators (!) to Dems' 42 (2 Independents).
New England is returning to its Republican roots: GOP governors elected or re-elected in MA, CT, NH, VT. That means only RI and ME resisted the red wave! Maybe that corner of the country is still euphoric (and grateful) over the @RedSox.
Before #BetoBelievers get too excited about #O'Rourke's showing in Texas, it's worth recalling that he did no better than @MittRomney did against #Obama in 2012: both candidates lost, 51-48, after a hard-fought race. Congratulations to victorious @tedcruz!
With 89% of all votes in, @FLGovScott inched ahead of Bill Nelson for Florida Senate - glorious news! If Scott's lead holds, no real prospect for Democrats to take the Senate. But Miami-Dade still has 25% of votes to come in.
HURRAH! Republican @Denver4VA Riggleman just declared the winner over the awful, America-hating, anti-Israel radical Democrat #LeslieCockburn in Virginia. Wonderful news - and Riggleman is also seriously interested in #BigFoot. Hearty mazeltov to the new Congressman.
No reason to worry yet, but with 17% of Texas vote already in, @BetoORourke is far ahead of @tedcruz -- by about 15 pts. Maybe that reflects Beto's emphasis on winning the early votes. Alarming to think he could win - or even make it close.
For those who think party ID doesn't matter, how do you explain that @AndrewGillum and #BillNelson - two very different Florida Democrats - have virtually identical vote totals in their two close races?
With 83% of votes counted in Florida, Governor's race is TIED. This state is crazy - shades of Bush-Gore 2,000?!
.@JenniferWexton declared winner by CNN against @BarbaraComstock in Northern Virginia. What a shame! Comstock was a responsible, smart, mainstream conservative member of the House, and didn't deserve her characterization as "Barbara Trumpstock."
Not a #BlueWave (yet) but certainly a blue ripple --Democrats currently running ahead in so many GOP Congressional districts in so many different states, that it looks increasingly far-fetched to think Republicans hold the House.
Nationwide exit polls: 47% say #Trump's immigration policies are "too tough'; 16% say "not tough enough"; only 32% say "about right". This suggests that this issue may not provide the magical boost that #Trump wanted and expected.
Exit polls in Indiana very encouraging for #GOP candidate #MikeBraun: of all voters, 34% said they wanted to vote FOR #Trump, 30% said Trump was not a factor. That's only a third saying they wanted to vote AGAINST Trump - the only reason to back #JoeDonnelly
.@JohnKingCNN said in #GOPDreamScenario, Republicans could win 3 senate seats. Actually, we could easily win FIVE: gaining IN,MO,MT,FL,ND &amp; holding NV,AZ,TN,TX. Not at all impossible- and then there's MI &amp; NJ, as bonus prospects!

Sickeningly dishonest that media continue to deride @GOP as "the party of old white men." Noteworthy that some of the most exciting Senate nominees this year break that mold: @JohnJamesMI, @LeahVukmir WI, @RepMcSally AZ, @MarshaBlackburn TN, @Susan_Hutch WA, and more
#MarthaMcSally will be a VERY welcome addition to the Republican caucus of the US Senate. Maybe  chance to revive the "singing Senators" of 20 years ago! https://t.co/aslJPI3TwC
To close this campaign, #Republicans should try to make people feel better about America, not to make them feel worse- more terrified and apprehensive. It's not only smarter politics to stress the positive, it's a better fit with the natural optimism of free-market conservatism.

OK, correction: it wasn't Roy Lichtenstein who created the memorable panel "Nuclear War? There Goes My Career!" It was #MarkVallen (in 1980). https://t.co/FpzUMcLDs3
In one of his most recent rallies, @realDonaldTrump complained that the would-be bomber and synagogue shooter ruined his political "momentum." This reminds me of the Roy Lichtenstein panel that shows a starlet saying: "Nuclear War? Oh NO! There Goes My Career!"
Yesterday,@realDonaldTrump urged soldiers at the border to shoot rock-throwers in the caravan. He did so in front of a painting of #TheodoreRoosevelt. TR, a true battlefield hero (who earned the Medal of Honor), would be appalled at the idea of abusing our military in that way.
Reasonable points. Also worth noting: under OBAMA, three-quarters of those presenting themselves for asylum were turned down. Why should anyone expect that USA becomes more "welcoming" under Trump? https://t.co/WZ0eZ3n3o8

Words are stubborn things:"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the  jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States". Not some lefty tweet:it's the Constitution(14th amendment). Originalists can't pretend the words don't mean what they say.
It's bizarre to suggest that any criticism of @TomSteyer is, by definition, anti-Semitic. His mother &amp; wife are both Christian, and for more than 20 yrs he's been an active in the Episcopal church. Attacks on him may be unfair, but that doesn't mean they're anti-Semitic.
It's outrageous that a little-known "progressive" Jewish group called #BendingTheArc has proclaimed that @realDonaldTrump is "not welcome in #Pittsburgh" because they dislike his policies. He is our president; great majority of American Jews (and Pittsburghers) would welcome him.
After #Pittsburgh, we need clear distinctions on "Antisemitic hate crimes." This one is the real deal: explicit Jew hatred,murderous violence.But it's irresponsible to apply similar terms to all insults or rude remarks. Such insults still wrong, but not necessarily "hate crimes."
Reasonable to say that #Trump's crude, hostile rhetoric (designating his opponents as "evil") has contributed to tribal rage in our politics. But it's WRONG to suggest that he has fostered Antisemitism. He's unequivocally pro-Israel, &amp; proud of his Jewish grandchildren.
What a lovely man he was - in every way. And what a beautiful neighborhood Squirrel Hill is. https://t.co/wP17EN2Imj
I first heard about #Pittsburgh this morning when I walked to our synagogue for Shabbat services. I heard, because a dear Christian friend, Charlie-a Marine vet, NRA life member and opera singer-turned up on his own initiative to offer protection and support. I love America!
Lou Dobbs has a sick fascination with conspiracy theories. Remember his deep concern about diabolical plans to form a "North American Union" that would replace the Yankee dollar with the "Amero"? https://t.co/GzYWv1Ze6E
Media describe #Pittsburgh as "the deadliest attack on Jews in US history"- an astonishing fact demonstrating America's status as a uniquely blessed home for our people. In this good, Godly land for more than 300 yrs, we've been remarkably protected from killing and persecution
Thank you @KarinHousley. Can’t wait ‘till you are U.S. Senator Housley! It was great meeting you at the event last night and your victory can seal GOP control of the U.S. Senate for 2019 and the foreseeable future. https://t.co/YdvbTUx7qS
Remarkably quick apprehension of the #BombScare suspect is a great blessing for USA and should also boost the standing of #JeffSessions, #ChristopherWray &amp; the #FBI- leading @POTUS (and the rest of us) to appreciate them more appropriately.
"These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country." The fine remarks by @realDonaldTrump at WH today make it much harder for anyone to associate @POTUS with messages or actions of #CesarSayoc-- who is, in fact, properly classified as "deplorable."
As recently as last night (when I was on a panel in Minneapolis), some serious conservatives speculated that the #BombScare was a "false flag" operation by libs. Doesn't that ridiculous (obviously mistaken) assumption expose the dangers &amp; idiocy of conspiratorial thinking?
The van of bombing suspect #CesarSayoc shows leading libs with gun-sight targets over their faces, along with the message: "I Am Donald Trump &amp; I Approve This Message." Now @realDonaldTrump should make unmistakably clear that he does NOT approve this message, or any part of it.
Great point made by my producer @TomlinMedia. https://t.co/sSJ67o3iMs
Media are attempting to lump together various phenomena: #BombScare, #KhashoggiMurder, Trump's attacks on "fake news" &amp; praise for body-slamming MT Rep #GregGianforte. But distinctions are crucial: first 2 are EVIL,last 2 just embarrassing &amp; stupid. Hardly equivalent--or related.
It's clarifying to watch the response by NYPD,@andrewcuomo,@BilldeBlasio &amp; others to the bomb scare. Whatever the shortcomings of such liberal pols, they're NOT the enemy, they're just opponents. The enemy (of all) is the evil scum who sent out the bombs-and other America-haters.
Whoever sent #bombs to liberal icons (Clinton, Obama, Holder, Soros, etc) must be apprehended, prosecuted for attempting mass murderer. But using this incident for political advantage while we still know NOTHING about the perp may be irresistible, but it's also irresponsible.
The  first three synonyms for #nationalism are listed as "patriotism, patriotic feeling, flag-waving." What, exactly, is wrong with any of that?
Thank you, Senator https://t.co/6QJ8F6e9p0
Yes, it's true TR's #NewNationalism program of 1912 was part of his campaign with the Progressive Party after he left the Republicans. But he came back to #GOP in 1916, and played a lead role in their unexpected 1918 midterm gains that gave GOP control of both houses.
Those pundits who are freaking out over @realDonaldTrump daring to describe himself as a "nationalist" should please recall that one of the greatest of all Americans, #TheodoreRoosevelt, dubbed his reform program "The New Nationalism" in his "Bull Moose" campaign of 1912. Bully!
The original Halloween movie (1978) was hailed as a “minimalist masterpiece”.  Does the new version (the 10th sequel) live up to the original? My review: 	https://t.co/LMYha8Z5LL
For those of us who favor comprehensive #ImmigrationReform, making distinctions is crucial. "Dreamers" have nothing in common with the #Caravan. Most undocumented living here want to work with the system to move toward legal status. #Caravan wants to overturn that whole system.
Concerning the #Caravan from Honduras, @POTUS has made his position clear: this organized challenge to an orderly immigration process can't be allowed to succeed. But what do Dems say? We know they hate Trump, but how would they respond to this obvious effort to erase the border?
Coming up to the #midterms, @SenSasse of Nebraska remains the most compelling, credible voice on behalf of the #GOP - and how to push back against polarization. He joins the radio show today (Thur) at 3 PM ET.
If govt agents kill a journalist anywhere, it's reprehensible &amp; evil. but to commit murder inside a consulate-a closely guarded govt facility-is utterly stupid. If #Saudis did it, how did they expect to get away with it? Arrogant stupidity is almost as scary as reckless cruelty.
....Kavanaugh's alleged misbehavior occurred 36 yrs ago, in a (still unidentified) private home. Saudi crime: just days ago,in a prominent govt facility. Most important: you can't equate a drunk teenager allegedly groping a girl with govt agents committing murder &amp; dismemberment.
.@POTUS made a hideous error in comparing #Saudis to #Kavanaugh, demanding presumption of innocence for both. First, Kavanaugh is an jurist with no prior charges against him, ever. Saudi govt is a corrupt, brutal autocracy, guilty of a long record of cruelty &amp; killing. Second...
No, @SenWarren's DNA test  doesn't mean #Trump "lost his bet" and must pay $1 million to "Pochahantas"! Trump said he'd pay if she "proved she is an Indian." No tribe, ever, has authorized membership based on just 1 of 64 great-great-great-great grandparents-Warren's best claim.
The @StormyDaniels' defamation suit tossed out of court -which is good news for @POTUS, obviously, but also good news for America. Why? Because it's bad news for @MichaelAvenatti -- AND because the President can concentrate on even more important things.
So sad to hear of the passing of our Seattle neighbor, #PaulAllen, at age 65, after a long battle with lymphoma. His philanthropy and business leadership benefited all of the Northwest-- all of America, in fact. May his family and friends be comforted in their loss.

Contemporary liberals (this means you, @SenWarren!) do have this in common with Nazis: a sick obsession with one "drop of blood" (or strand of DNA) defining something important about you, even after 6 generations.
Question for @SenWarren never was whether her family had some distant Indian ancestor. So what if genetic tests say she did have one Native American family member 6-10 generations ago? It's absurd that this remote heritage should qualify her as a "diversity" hire for Harvard!
New @CNN poll shows 54% approval for @MELANIATRUMP; only 41% for @realDonaldTrump. So? First Ladies almost always have higher approval rating than their husbands. Most notable exception?: @HillaryClinton.

How do you designate a #NeverTrumper who's "come around"? Is he/she a "Reformed (or Recovering) NeverTrumper"? I never accepted the "NeverTrump" label in the 1st place (never is a long time in politics). I prefer "Trump Curious", or "Trump Skeptical", or "Not-Yet Trumper." Okay?
Why the high-profile #WhiteHouse visit for #KanyeWest? Was this an audition for our next UN Ambassador?
One silly theory about what happens next with @nikkihaley, connecting her to GOP hero of the moment, @LindseyGrahamSC: #Lindsey replaces Sessions as #AG, then #Nikki is appointed to fill his Senate seat. Problem: we NEED Lindsey in the Senate, and why would he want to be AG?
What's driving Dem passion in the midterms? @SenMarkey of MA had a succinct explanation on CNN: "We lost when we should not have lost. There's nothing in politics more motivating than that." In other words, re-asserting their sense of entitlement.
It's true: @nikkihaley has done such a superb job as UN Ambassador that she'll  be difficult to replace. One name that's surely in the mix is @JonHuntsman: he's been ambassador to China AND Russia, and was a fine, solidly conservative governor in Utah.
In 2009, #KanyeWest insulted @taylorswift13 at VMA. At that time, how many conservatives felt more sympathetic to Kanye? But now, with #Taylor backing Democrats in TN, and #Kanye expressing his fearless support for @POTUS, are we ready to rethink our take on that 9 yr old spat?
Left's habit of demonizing decent, dedicated public servants goes beyond #Kavanaugh. New movie #VICE apparently portrays #DickCheney as diabolical, dangerous. #ClarenceThomas still pilloried as "strange justice." These are admirable Americans who deserve gratitude, not smears.
Final reason crazed #Kavanaugh hatred discredits Dems: it shows that #Trump's rudeness &amp; crudeness didn't create present polarization; real source is today's vitriolic, fanatical leftism. If they can't work with a mainstream, respected figure like #JudgeK,who CAN they work with?
Why is #Kavanaugh fight damaging Dems? 1) They're going to lose, and they won't lose gracefully; nobody likes sore losers. 2) Hysterical Dem attacks unite #GOP, giving #Trump a broader base than ever. Libs aren't just out to destroy #Trump, they want to obliterate conservatism.
If the Senate votes down #Kavanaugh's confirmation, it's an implicit guilty verdict on charges against him; his career &amp; life would be ruined. But if they vote to confirm, what harm comes to his accuser? #DrFord would still be hailed as a courageous martyr to the #MeToo cause.
For #RichardBlumenthal and the other smear-crazed, reckless Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, PLEASE recall the immortal words of #JosephWelch to #JoeMcCarthy: "Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness... Have you no sense of decency?"
Most Americans HATE the nastiness,the pettiness, the politics of personal destruction exemplified by the #Kavanaugh fight. If you want more of that toxic gridlock, you'll vote Democratic in November. If you do hope for a change of tone -results over resistance- you MUST vote GOP.
Amazing to watch cable news today: instead of emphasizing new revelations from #DrFord's former boyfriend (which raise questions about her credibility), they focus on tasteless but irrelevant rally comments by #Trump, in an effort to shore up her "suffering victim" status.
Bravo, @realDonaldTrump! Sitting alongside the Pres of Chile, asked about @JeffFlake &amp; the delay in the final #Kavanaugh vote, #BlazeyFord's testimony, etc, he struck just the right tone -respectful, unifying, presidential. This is an amazingly positive development.
You're exactly right, Greg. Knowing Senator McCain well for years, I'm sure he would have been just as passionate as Lindsey -- though with even saltier language - in backing an outstanding appointment to #SCOTUS. https://t.co/7F2S2UiGKH
Right now, @SenWhitehouse is revisiting his obsession with "boofing" and "the Devil's Triangle" and "ralphing" and other dubious references in the #GeorgetownPrep year book! This is even more peculiar than the the deep concern over pubic hair on coke cans 27 yrs ago.
Dems ask: why no public testimony by #Ramirez, #Swetnick, or other accusers? Real question: why was PUBLIC testimony by #BlazeyFord necessary? What possible purpose was served that couldn't have been better accomplished with the private interviews that she, apparently, preferred?
Democratic invocations of "FBI investigation" as ultimate solution on #Kavanaugh, absurdly suggests that same institution that can't figure out what occurred among public figures &amp; Russia 2 yrs ago, can magically determine exactly what happened at private teen parties 36 yrs ago.
Indication of the depths of our polarization and partisanship: @SenFeinstein suggests, this morning, that the US Senate must invest time &amp; resources to investigate obviously absurd, utterly groundless #Swetnick charges of drugging &amp; gang rape at high school parties 36 yrs ago.
Thank you, @JeffFlake. His announced vote to confirm #JudgeKavanaugh places conscience over convenience, decency over personal destruction, and assures that his service in Congress (both House and Senate) will be remembered as honorable and admirable.
Time for a Senate "Resolution of Censure" to be voted against @SenFeinstein for her wretchedly incompetent handling of the #BlaseyFord charges, hurting both #JudgeKavanaugh AND his accuser. GOP Senators hate her anyway - use that majority!
Remarkable and impassioned comments by @LindseyGrahamSC. https://t.co/cz31uCmA7m
Bravo, @LindseyGrahamSC -- you are the best! Your comments in the #Kavanaugh hearings will serve to redeem this moment in history. We will replay them on the radio, to help Americans see what's at stake in this confirmation process, and this election. Thank God for your clarity!
Cast your vote to decide: Which Democrat in the Judiciary Committee is the most obnoxious and insufferable?
Sure, #RachelMitchell (the GOP's designated interrogator for the Judiciary Committee) has drawn her share of criticism for a "baffling" line of questioning. But at least there's this: no Democrat can accuse her of brutality, aggressiveness (or high drama) in handling Dr. Ford.
Of all the obnoxious Democrats on the #JudiciaryCommitte, who's the most insufferable? Tough choice, but with due consideration for #Blumenthal, #Harris &amp; #Spartacus, my vote goes to the sickeningly self-righteous @maziehirono, the disastrously dim senator from HI. Mahalo!
Timing? #JulieSwetnick says she attended "well over ten house parties during the yrs 1981-83." She also alleges she was "gang-raped" at one of those parties "in approximately 1982." If she kept going to such gatherings till '83, why would she continue partying with her rapists?!
.#JulieSwetnick says she was gang-raped 30+ yrs ago, and #Kavanaugh was present, but didn't participate. So if she accuses HIM, who she says did NOT rape her, why not identify those who actually did? Why does she remember an observer to her rape more than the perpetrators?
Surprising that #Swetnick recalls some 10 house parties where gang rape, drugging was going on.But instead of reporting the criminality, she kept attending those parties. She says many guys, beyond #Kavanaugh &amp; #Judge, participated in the assaults. Why not name &amp; charge them now?
If we are supposed to believe that #BrettKavanaugh was a criminal degenerate as an adolescent, doesn't it raise questions as to how he got into Yale (and later Yale Law),  let alone making it to the Appellate Court- where he's served with spotless distinction for 13 yrs?
Concerning the grotesque charges from #Swetnick &amp; #Ramirez, isn't it possible that these lurid, so far unsubstantiated accusations, may only serve to undermine, rather than re-enforce #BlaseyFord's prior claims?
Gang rape? Drugging victims? The most troubling question about grave charges from #JulieSwetnick: why, if ANY of this is true, didn't prior investigations of #Kavanaugh for top White House &amp; Appellate Court positions, uncover some these alleged high school horrors?
Would #AnitaHill have become a liberal icon if 3 Senate votes had switched in '91, blocking #ClarenceThomas from the Court? Probably not, and #DrFord will probably gain more (books, lecture tours, prestigious prizes) if #Kavanaugh's on the court &amp; she can play the martyred saint.
Absolutely right. If Clarence Thomas had withdrawn, he'd been remembered only as the guy who had destroyed his career by harassing an associate. As with the great #JusticeThomas, once he is on the court the allegations will fade into clangorous background noise. https://t.co/T0QxB7gVSu
Even without qualifying for the playoffs, this year's M's have earned support and devotion....With a few tweaks (one more quality starting pitcher) and 2019 can be magical. https://t.co/67F32Heicg
After all, why is long-ago drunken groping by a 17-yr old more worthy of prosecution than more recent groping or self-exposure by Clinton as Gov &amp; Prez? Of course, it's absurd to prosecute him now (despite evidence) but far more absurd to prosecute #Kavanaugh (w scant evidence).
A @nytimes column suggested that if #Kavanaugh is confirmed, Dems should impeach him when they win House majority. @maddow suggests prosecution &amp; prison even if he's on the court. Any thought here about prosecuting the far more recent (and egregious) assaults of @BillClinton?
Superb @DallasWinds have done it again: their new CD- #JohnWilliams at the Movies-is one of the finest collections of film music ever recorded. These arrangements of classic scores arranged for wind band are stunningly recorded, artistically rewarding. Bravo to all concerned!
How can Democrats oppose #Kavanaugh at same time they back #KeithEllison for AttyGenl in MN? Ellison's accuser cites a PATTERN of RECENT abuse while he held high public office. Kavanaugh's accuser claims one instance of abuse, 36 years ago, when the alleged perp was 17 yrs old.
New movie from #MichaelMoore, @Fahrenheit11_9 suffers from directorial ADHD, jumping from topic to topic (Trump's election, water crisis in Flint, Parkland shooting, Bernie's greatness etc) with no rhyme &amp; little reason. Two hours of muddled hectoring with no laughs &amp; few gasps.
CA legislature passed law fining corporations if their boards don't include specified # of females. These hypocrites weren't elected to control corporations; they do control govt. Why not legal requirements for female representation in the legislature, every govt dept.Fat chance!
If #ChristinaBlaseyFord does testify, 1 question she should get: why did you make these charges in 7/18? Even if it's true that you were first able to face them during 2012 during marital therapy, why wait another 6 yrs before coming forward? Kavanaugh was already a judge in 2012
In the case of alleged workplace harassment (#AnitaHill) it's at least plausible why the victim would tell no one for 10 years. But with allegations of physical, criminal assault (#Ford), it's less credible the victim would tell NO ONE until marital therapy 30 yrs later (2012).
Analogies between #AnitaHill &amp; #ChristinaBlaseyFord are misleading, tiresome. Beyond differences in timing (10 yrs after incident v. 36 yrs) &amp; setting (federal office v high school party) there's a key distinction in nature of charges: workplace harrassment v physical assault.
....coming in handy....	a great call! https://t.co/jO4BaQ50Vl
For #DrFord to come forward now delivers obvious POLITICAL benefits for Democrats. But what possible PERSONAL benefit can it provide for her? If she is truly haunted by memories of the alleged assault, won't she be damaged further by the process of making her charges public?
In 2012, #DrFord revealed to her husband &amp; therapist that she was haunted by   #Kavanaugh's alleged assault 30 yrs before. But she maintained public silence for 6 more yrs. So - what changed, other than #Kavanaugh's appointment and political desperation by Dems to block it?
How can @SenFeinstein possibly explain sitting on the letter from #DrFord for two months-- IF she thought the charges were credible and disqualifying? Isn't her delay conclusive proof that she initially disregarded the charges as irrelevant to #Kavanaugh's confirmation?
Great piece, Greg....should receive wide attention. https://t.co/f22GvTlp9m
See that #DrFord's husband says charges against #Kavanaugh are disqualifying because judges need "a moral code of their own to determine right from wrong." But isn't it a common pattern  that even those who lack clear,consistent moral codes at age 17, might develop one by age 53?
If Senate holds further #Kavanaugh hearings, one line of questioning his accuser MUST face: Do you, personally, believe the incident you describe disqualifies him from serving as a federal judge? If so, why didn't you come forward before his appellate court confirmation?
If any US Senator tries to justify voting against #BrettKavanaugh by citing a spurious,uncorroborated allegation that he tried (but failed) to "force himself" on an unidentified girl when both were in HIGH SCHOOL...well, any such Senator should be driven from public life,forever.

Yes, @POTUS faces a real challenge in responding to #FlorenceHurricane2018: if the federal response isn't perfect, #Trump will be blamed. If it IS perfect, he'll still be blamed - because #NorthCarolina gets better treatment than #PuertoRico.

The former campaign director for @realDonaldTrump has just pleaded guilty to "conspiracy against the US" &amp; may be cooperating with prosecutors. What sort of partisan blindness does it require to view this development as "a big win for the president"?
No. GWB won 51% of popular vote running for re-election in 2004.  Same percentage as Obama when he ran for re-election in 2012. https://t.co/jH77ozulCm
@Lazy_Contrarian @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @algore @GeorgeHWBush But neither Hillary, nor Al, nor Bill Clinton managed to win 51% or more — and neither did Truman, JFK, or Carter.  Ike, Nixon (‘72), Reagan 2x, GHWB (‘88), and GWB (‘04) did win clear popular vote majorities.
It's horrifying if @realDonaldTrump actually believes that reports of 3,000 deaths in #PuertoRico are only due to Dems trying to make him "look bad". Even more horrifying: if he thinks that making this obscene observation will help him - or GOP - politically.
Good for @RonDeSantisFL to emphasize the failures of socialism in his campaign! First, his opponent is connected to the #BernieSanders "Democratic Socialist" wing of DemParty. second, many of FL's Latinos are refugees from socialist nightmares: Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela.
The personal appeal of @BarackObama has masked the weak standing of the DemParty-- for the last 74 yrs! Since FDR, O's the only Dem to win two majority victories. In last 18 Prez races, only Dems to win clear majority (51% or more): #LBJ in '64, Obama (2x). Some "majority party"!
In today's #WSJ, former @BillClinton advisor #WmGalston warns progressives: "Abolishing ICE has nothing to do with enacting sound immigration reform." Of course he's absolutely right, and the point is important.
After two days off for #RoshHashanah, the Jewish new year, I'll be happy to rejoin the fray on Wednesday, on the air live---so much to cover, especially with a fateful election just 46 days away!
Compare #Trump's rollicking, often ridiculous rally in Billings with #Obama's sober, substantive, tedious drone in Chicago &amp; you'll see why Trump survives,even thrives.POTUS amuses the audience &amp; he's having a great time; O is performing a chore-and it's a chore to listen to him.
Exactly right, Ben. Is it possible that O is deliberately trying to come across as even more boring than usual--in the mistaken belief that after too much "excitement", too many chills &amp; thrills, from #Trump, we all long for the good ol' days of Obamanian boredom? https://t.co/G0vvHKZDS9
Isn't #FakeHistory even worse than #FakeNews? @POTUS says press generally "excoriated" #GettysburgAddress as "too flowery." NO!--The only criticism of the speech (most reaction was very positive)- said it was too brief, too plain, not "too flowery." Actually, the truth matters.
Author of #AnonymousOpEd claims he/she remains anonymous to keep working to rein in "amorality" of @POTUS. But if that's a priority, how does publication help? The piece only undermines effectiveness of any insiders who MAY want to save #Trump from his own worst instincts.
Grandstanding by @CoryBooker to flout Senate rules demonstrates same dangerous thinking that drove the #AnonymousOpEd: that somehow, the need to block #Trump and all his works is so urgent, that rules, norms, loyalty &amp; common decency no longer matter.
In #Trump's worldview, it makes sense to describe the #AnonymousOpEd as "#TREASON." If treason is "giving aid &amp; comfort to our enemies", and IF media are "the enemy of the people," then doesn't the notorious editorial give aid and comfort to this particular "enemy"?

Former Att'y Gen'l of AZ, @GrantWoods, just completed a eulogy for his one-time boss, @SenJohnMcCain that was exemplary in every way - eloquent, folksy, funny, deeply touching, patriotic, profound. Woods provides exactly the sort of voice the #GOP needs to hear today.
2nd reason more sadness over death (same cause) of #McCain than death of #TedKennedy: when EMK died, Obama was POTUS--Ted's candidate for "continuing the legacy." For McC, #Trump was not his choice, &amp; displays different style &amp; values- making "Maverick" seem like last of a breed.
.@SenJohnMcCain died 8/25/18--9 yrs to the day as his Senate colleague, #TedKennedy. With MCain, however, the mourning is more intense, the praise even more lavish. 2 reasons- McC truly exemplified honor &amp; high character; EMK, with the problems in his personal life, not so much
Republicans rightly slammed Obama's Attorneys General for their partisan political focus, and #Trump is wrong to criticize his AG, #Sessions, for trying to avoid partisan agendas. The answer to a politicized pro-Dem DOJ isn't a pro- GOP DOJ; It's placing Justice above politics.

Passing of @SenJohnMcCain reminds me of why I'm proud to be Republican: even those who disagreed with him knew the Senator was decent, noble, patriotic, admirable.That was true of all our Pres. nominees for 32 yrs: Reagan, GHWBush, Dole, WBush, McCain, Romney.May it always be so.
As tributes pour in for gallant @SenJohnMcCain, worth considering the admiration he inspired from all sides of the partisan divide. He exemplifies the  "Greatest Generation" emphasis on duty, honor &amp; "Country First"- his slogan in his 2008 campaign. May God continue to bless him.
How many people out there - conservative, moderate or liberal - wouldn't prefer #PresidentPence  to a flailing, preoccupied, grievously wounded President Trump? Nixon  knew a resignation was better for his party, his country--and,  ultimately, for his own place in history..
In 2016, #Trump True Believers always said, "We need to defend him: the alternative is Hillary!" But now, the alternative is MIKE PENCE. I don't think I'm the only conservative who thinks a timely resignation is preferable to a drawn-out impeachment fight that sinks the GOP.
Does reported federal immunity deal for #DavidPecker mean that @POTUS will now stop campaigning for a #PulitzerPrize for the #NationalEnquirer?
The new line by @POTUS ("How can you impeach somebody who's doing a great job?") echoes Democratic defense of #BillClinton in '90's ("Why impeach while the economy is booming?"). Both arguments ignore the idea that law-breaking- even by a president- must have consequences.
@ericmetaxas No, Eric, these 2 were investigated because of ties to RUSSIA, not simply ties to the Pres. Manafort harvested some $60 mil in Kremlin-related funds (which he hid from IRS) and offered "private briefings" on the campaign to a Russian oligarch. Why defend these creeps?
It is an inane and embarrassing talking point to keep insisting that #Manafort convictions "have nothing to do with Russian collusion." The convictions are all about mishandling millions-and the source of those millions was Russia,acting through its Ukrainian puppet, #Yanukovich.
Reading indictment of Rep #DuncanHunter &amp; wife is truly sickening-makes #Manafort&amp; #Cohen look like paragons of virtue.Could @SenBlumenthal be right that this is a "Watergate moment"? Feels like it, with multiple Republicans simultaneously exposed in seemingly unrelated scandals.
Die hard #Trump apologists say the reason so many of the members of his inner circle face legal/ethical issues is that "deep state" has targeted them for attack. But isn't it more logical to begin to question the President's dubious choices in assembling that inner circle?
Thank you, Jay -- your generous words are profoundly appreciated. But doesn't it appear that the events of today are, somehow, clarifying -- like brisk winds blowing away the smokey haze from wild fires afflicting us here in the west. https://t.co/nfjUbwlGEt

@TheGeeScott Very cool --- I'm smiling broadly and very grateful. Could be my only chance for big applause on Oscar night!
If defending @POTUS now requires a defense of the convicted, shamelessly shady (and indefensible) #PaulManafort, then pro-Trump Republicans are cooked.
Insistence by @POTUS that #Manafort's conviction has "nothing to do with Russian collusion" ignores a sensitive fact: the core of Manafort's legal problems involved $60 million he took from Putin's deeply corrupt puppet-president of Ukraine--  and hid from IRS.
.@realDonaldTrump calls #Manafort "a good man" and cites his work for Reagan, &amp; Dole to justify his selection to run Trump's campaign. But he served Dole &amp; Reagan BEFORE taking $60 million from Putin's (corrupt) man in Ukraine. He worked for Trump AFTER those ill-gotten gains.
Today on my radio show, callers reacted to news of both #MichaelCohen and #PaulManafort found guilty in fed'l court, by claiming "witch hunt" or calling for new investigation of #Hillary. That response is a sad reflection of the moral collapse of much of the conservative movement
Left's ongoing attempts to canonize Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg are fascinating. Why did it take quarter century to suddenly claim her as one America's greatest heroines, ever? The good news: at least RBG counts as a more wholesome model of female empowerment than, say, #Madonna.
Listening to speculation on the #Manafort verdict, you'd think there's consuming public interest in this case and breathless anticipation over its outcome. Sorry, Manafort isn't OJ: who can even name the legal all-stars on either side of this trial?

@mattklewis Maybe you're right, after all, about the "SuperVillains" bit ---consider the names  of the operatives pictured in this great photo: "Dr. Gorka, The Mooch, Omarosa and Corey ("Womp Womp") Lewandowski...
@mattklewis Not SuperVillains --- the Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight
Question for @realDonaldTrump: have all your tweets about the unspeakable @OMAROSA meant more publicity for her new book, or less? The answer is obvious and so is the next question: why are you continuing to promote her career?
Amusing @nytimes frontpage headline: FRACTURES IN THEIR MOVEMENT KEPT WHITE SUPREMACISTS HOME. Fractures? Why would a "movement" with dozens of adherents dissipate its "strength' in factional strife? And why is it news that a mass demonstration of craziness failed to occur?
@BillKristol Concerning Trump's assault on #Mueller: Conservatives should think about how we would have reacted if Obama had daily denigrated the investigations of Fast &amp; Furious, or Lois Lerner; of if Hillary had tweeted every day to belittle and discredit the Benghazi probe.
On the anniversary of #Charlottesville, both sides are pushing the idea that the riots represented something deeply meaningful. How can mindless thugs on either side- Nazis or Antifa- suggest there's something worth honoring in such pointless violence?
With #RepChrisCollins arrested &amp; indicted, no should try to blame  "deep state' actors in the #FBI for making the case against one of  #Trump's top backers. It will only go badly for #GOP if we try to explain corruption by attacking law enforcement--in this case &amp; others.
With Stalinists pushing to remove #Trump's star from the ""Walk of Fame" because they hate his politics, what's next: erasing Reagan's star because he was anti-communist, or #CharltonHeston's star because he supported the 2nd Amendment?
Another sign today's left doesn't represent a serious, sustainable political force: determined efforts by West H'wood's City Council to force removal of #Trump's star on the #HollywoodWalkOfFame. Actually, that star isn't even in the city of West H'wood. What spiteful idiocy!
On Tuesday, @JohnKingCNN said that if the GOP lost the special election in #Ohio, then we must put impeachment "on the table." Now that Republican @Troy_Balderson has apparently prevailed, can we take impeachment off the table, please, for the sake of the Republic?
Yes, it's #PrimaryDay here in WA, and yes I'm voting: of the 29 (!) candidates for US Senate, only one can offer a credible challenge to the awful Democratic incumbent, #SenMariaCantwell: I'm proud to support #SusanHutchison and believe she can run a strong, competitive race.
You can't succeed in "Making America Great Again" if you persist in making yourself look small. By hurling personal insults at basketball stars, beauty queens, TV reporters and movie stars, @POTUS makes himself look small. He doesn't hurt them; he wounds himself.
Diehard fans of @realDonaldTrump hail him as "a great counter-puncher." Does that mean he should now punch back at #Melania, since she reacted to his insults to #LebronJames by praising the basketball king?
@MeghanMcCain @TheView You make many of us proud, Meghan --- your great father is one of millions. Keep up the great work and congratulations.
Historical Stunner: In 1912, POTUS #WilliamHowardTaft placed 4th in CA with less than 1% of vote! Ahead of him: former Pres TRoosevelt (who carried the state), NJ Gov WWilson, AND Socialist Eugene Debs. Taft got only 23% of national vote- weakest showing ever for a GOP nominee.
If @realDonaldTrump honestly believes Russian meddling is a "hoax" (as he said last night), isn't he obligated, logically and ethically, to fire his entire nat'l security team, which very plausibly described a real threat just one day before?
As @TomlinMedia says: @POTUS could say: No, press in general isn't "enemy of the people", but a dishonest and one-sided press is a real threat to democracy.
.@Acosta of @CNN pushes #SarahSanders to reject "enemy of the people" label for the press. Right answer: "Speaking personally, I don't see any reporter as my 'enemy'- my critic, certainly; my nightmare, sometimes. But for the nation's sake, we still work together every day."
Press briefing (with #Bolton, #Coats, #Wray, #Nielsen &amp; co) is a home run! Bravo to #BillShine and WH communication staff- brilliantly staged way to assure USA that the president takes election meddling seriously.
The announcement that General #JohnKelly will remain as WH Chief of Staff till 2020 is good news for @realDonaldTrump, for the GOP &amp; for the nation. It also shows this fearless leatherneck hero is willing to complete a tough, risky, thankless mission for his country.
Only way for #GOP to win 2018 is to adjust to battlegrounds. For Senate, it's red states- WV, IN, ND, MO, etc. The #House presents a different fight,with 23 key GOP seats in districts HILLARY carried. Rallying the base isn't enough to win those seats, or other suburban districts.
Drives me nuts when over-confident conservatives reassure themselves about 2018 with polls showing "90% of Republicans love Trump!" True, but GOP now holds 23 seats in districts HILLARY won. Our candidates could win 100% of Republicans and still lose those seats--and the House.
.#RepSteveCohen (D-TN) just appeared on @CNN &amp; described the President's announced eagerness to shut down the government as "#mishugass". He used that highly clinical, psychological term without apology or translation-- guessing, I suspect, that most viewers get the idea.
In campaign to hold the House, focus for @realDonaldTrump &amp; entire #GOP should be on economic numbers &amp; Dem threats to stop growth cold. Please!- stop bleating &amp; tweeting on govt shutdowns, trade wars, #Mueller probe &amp; other self-destructive distractions.
Well said, Governor Bush --- a reason to celebrate for you, and for all conservatives! https://t.co/YDfhbmTx76
Just now on @CNN, @jeffzeleny read aloud the latest tweet from @POTUS deriding "Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer...." BUT Jeff left out the word "Crooked" when reading the tweet on air. Censoring a crucial adjective from the sacrosanct text of presidential tweets?! Horrors!
The drive by the #FreedomCaucus to impeach #RodRosenstein is a self-destructive move of indescribable inanity -and a gift to #Democrats who seek to seize the House. With no chance of success, it's a futile stunt as pointless &amp; preposterous as Dem bids to impeach #Trump.
Results in #GeorgiaPrimary not just a victory for @realDonaldTrump but a resounding endorsement of Trumpism within the #GOP. #BrianKemp, the @WhiteHouse endorsed candidate, didn't just beat Lt. Gov #CaseyCagle (who led in the first round), he crushed him-more than a 2-1 margin.
Basic truth on tariffs that @realDonaldTrump desperately tries to hide: it's not foreign nations or companies that he's hitting with a new tax.  It's American consumers who will suddenly pay more for products we buy-and have no choice about those added costs.
Sometimes you find #audiofile gold in unexpected places. @naxosrecords CDs, reasonably priced, offer several of the best-sounding recordings of recent years, featuring @JoAnnFaletta &amp; #BuffaloPhilharmonic (Gerswhin Piano Conc; Wagner Orchestral, more). Bravo!
Glad that @POTUS released #FISA info re #CarterPage but that application in no way "proves" #MuellerProbe was based on false premises. I don't think the investigation will find evidence of collusion, so why fight to delay/discredit its speedy conclusion- and #Trump's exoneration?
I've enjoyed @MarkDuplass as a guest on my radio show &amp; appreciated his good work in Hollywood.  It's a shame that such a sincere, talented artist should succumb to the twitter mob.  Mark, don't let the clamors of shrill, closed-minded leftists block a search for common ground! https://t.co/sTl3wuKUVr

Implacable media hostility to @realDonaldTrump means even simple, two-letter words produce confusion. When he said "No!" Wednesday, was it "no" to more questions, or "no" I don't believe Russia is still meddling? Honestly, the tape doesn't provide an indisputable answer.
News today: #GOP setting new fund-raising records for a midterm election. Contributions of more than $200 million (so far) doesn't guarantee victory but does indicate that Republican enthusiasm is surging.
Are you kidding?! People died at Pearl Harbor, on Kristallnacht. Who died here? Can you imagine that decades in the future, school kids will say, "Oh yeah, July 16th- that's the Day of Infamy when #Trump embarrassed himself in #Helsinki? https://t.co/U38X9PGeXB
Back up or shake up: if @realDonaldTrump really does believe #Putin is right and our own intelligence community is wrong about #Russian meddling, then he must do an intelligence shake-up, pronto. Otherwise, back up our personnel.
The core problem with #Helsinki wasn't what it showed about @realDonaldTrump's attitude toward #Putin. It's what it showed about his attitude toward his own staff--disregarding them entirely, and relying on instinct, on his own "golden gut" to make crucial decisions.
Is it true #MainStreamMedia over-reacted to #Helsinki? Of course. Is it also true @POTUS perpetrated one of the biggest disasters of his presidency? Sure. If #Trump doesn't straighten things out in the aftermath, #GOP will suffer in November.
So @realDonaldTrump thinks "both sides are to blame" for US-Russia tensions?! Does that mean that he agrees with his good buddy #Putin that the destruction of #SovietUnion (victory of #US in Cold War) was "the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th Century"?
Seriously, how can US Intelligence officials --CIA, NSA, military intelligence -- not resign unless @realDonaldTrump reconsiders his dismissal of their conclusions on Russian meddling? (Not collusion) Especially after #Putin himself confirms (today)he DID want to see #Trump win?
Without question, @JonHuntsman is a patriotic public servant. Unless @POTUS can walk back current message of trusting #Putin more than US Intelligence, #Huntsman should resign as Ambassador to Russia. The Senate fight over confirming a successor would be clarifying &amp; important.
Good for @realDonaldTrump for promoting "constructive dialogue" with #Russia. But he should consider the same approach to #Democrats - instead of attacking them at the Helsinki press conference &amp; treating them as implacable enemies more dangerous to America than #Putin.

Former Sec of Defense #WmCohen made an interesting point: #Trump began NATO summit by shaming our allies for under-spending on defense. He should begin #HelsinkiSummit by shaming #Putin for waging cyber war against USA-but that's probably unlikely.
RT @TomlinMedia: https://t.co/9vDle0Eatc
@realDonaldTrump says #BorisJohnson "would be a great Prime Minister...I think he's got what it takes." Considering #Trump's popularity in UK, will the president's unsolicited endorsement help or hurt his political future?
@SenSasse, as usual, a refreshingly clear voice -- https://t.co/2GUjifJRNT
Dems in Congress (@MarkWarner, @RepAdamSchiff) are calling for @POTUS to cancel the summit unless he makes the Russian #Indictments a major focus. Actually, the demand should be on Putin:  we cancel, unless he agrees to order his govt to cooperate with ongoing investigation.
No media speculation yet, but isn't it conceivable that #Kremlin will CANCEL #HelsinkiSummit --unless @realDonaldTrump disassociates himself from the #Indictments just issued by his own #DOJ? No chance, please God, that #Trump even considers such a move!
Yes, #PeterStrzok is a disgrace, whose text messages display his bias &amp; undermine #FBI. But today's #Indictments prove that a cyber-attack on our election by Russian military intel, represents a far more dire threat to USA and our institutions.
The new indictments-all 12!-are members of #Putin's govt: Russian military intelligence. If #Putin doesn't promise full cooperation with US investigation, @realDonaldTrump can't possibly conduct a successful summit on Monday.
Is there a double-standard in dismissal of #MuellerInvestigation by many Republicans? If #Putin hacked GOP, would we still write off investigation of his crimes as a #WitchHunt?
With new indictments of Russian operatives announced by #RodRosenstein,it's increasingly undeniable that attempts to interfere with our election were serious &amp; significant.@POTUS can't continues agreeing with Putin that investigation is a #WitchHunt without hurting himself &amp; USA.
Sometimes justice does prevail. https://t.co/vaMhOV7oz2
Why do GOP #SCOTUS choices so often turn left?And why do Dem picks so seldom shift right? Answer: "judicial activism" means more power for the judiciary, less for other institutions.Judges like power just as well as anyone else;there's a natural tug left, once they're installed.
.@nytimes editorial puts #Kavanaugh in terrifying context of "a global movement against the idea of liberal democracy...Trump and Senate Republicans appear happy to ride this wave to unlimited power." Unlimited power?! With closely divided country &amp; Congress? Are they kidding?
Yes, the story of the #ThailandCaveRescue is inspiring: real heroes, innocent victims, international cooperation, profound dangers, nightmarish difficulties, triumphant outcome. The movie version (sure to come) should be a worldwide hit.
@senatorshoshana How about asking them to spell "Kavanaugh"?
Of course #BrettKavanaugh is a superb choice. #Trump's most important promise was to select #SCOTUS appointments from #FederalistSociety list; keeping that promise has been his greatest achievement. Validation-no doubt-for those who argued this was reason enough to elect him.

It's true that the Dems would fight most ferociously against #JudeAmyBarrett. But it's also true that they would damage themselves most seriously - with Catholics, moderate women, &amp; religious believers of all stripes - in the process.
.#JudgeThomasHardiman, one of the "final four" for the #SCOTUS job, faced Senate confirmation in 2007 for his post on Court of Appeals. The vote wasn't a squeaker: 95 to 0! How could some 30 Dems who voted for him, explain why he's now-suddenly-unworthy to join the Supremes?
Good for giving this wider circulation, as sickening as it is -- we should do it on the show. Democratic red state Senators should decide whether they want to be associated with this point of view, before they even consider voting against the new #SCOTUS nominee. https://t.co/EfKEjMsHft
When @realDonaldTrump meets with #Putin, he should begin by talking @FIFAWorldCup: "Congrats on hosting, Vlad, but how about losing to #Croatia? You have 36 times the population, 300 times the land area, and you lost to THOSE guys?!"

Why does @POTUS continue to attack #ElizabethWarren (@elizabethforma)? Possible method to this madness: by sliming "Pocahontas" (groan!) he only boosts her among Dems- and the closer she comes to actually winning a Pres nomination, the worse it is for Dem prospects.
With @MichaelCohen212 hiring #LannyDavis to represent him, is it good news or bad news for @realDonaldTrump? Who knows, but it's great news for Michael Cohen. Lanny, an old friend, is one of the best lawyers in America and one of the world's smartest political &amp; media minds.
Oh no, the world is coming to an end! @CNN is highlighting "the overwhelming amount of sexism" on display at the #WorldCup? Unimaginable that soccer fans 7 players aren't models of elegant and enlightened behavior!
What's with the bizarre fantasy of @realDonaldTrump nominating #MerrickGarland? If @HillaryClinton had won, reasonable to expect she'd put Garland on #SCOTUS. But isn't it also reasonable for #Trump to assume that the people who voted him in wanted to go in a different direction?
Why has the story of #ThailandCaveRescue captured the public imagination as it has? It's a narrative of miraculous survival, potential heroic rescue &amp; deadly danger - with no bad guys!
Saddened &amp; shocked to hear of the passing of #EdSchultz. We did two raucous (packed house) live debates together, often guested on one another's shows. We disagreed on almost everything, but he was a total pro-- who passionately loved his country &amp; his countrymen.

Most likely  #SCOTUS appointments, according to multiple sources: #AmyConeyBarrett &amp; #BretKavanaugh. Both are young (46 &amp; 53), brilliant, charismatic, likable &amp; very difficult for Dems to demonize. Great choices- what a blessing either one would be!
Even those conservatives most deeply alienated by @realDonaldTrump, should support @POTUS in the upcoming #SCOTUS confirmation fight. For better of worse, #Trump will be done as Prez in 6.5 yrs; the new Justice will impact the country for 20 yrs more -- at least.
Are you kidding me? @BarackObama reportedly tells a fundraiser that @NancyPelosi was "one of the greatest Speakers we ever had"?!! After just 4 disastrous yrs as Speaker? I thought only @realDonaldTrump could get away with this sort of hyperbole.
If @realDonaldTrump does get a THIRD #SCOTUS appointment (#Ginsburg? #Breyer?), he'll be the first president since #Reagan to have that much influence on the way our Constitution is understood.
Another reason for Democrats to panic: Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg is 85, with long history of health issues. She should live &amp; be well, but there's a good chance #Trump gets another SCOTUS seat to fill--especially if he wins 2nd term.

There's a reason for that: there has been ZERO evidence, anywhere, of any form of alien (non-earthly) life. But there is lots of evidence (some of it dubious, of course) going back 100 years for existence of a previously unidentified hominid in the Northwest. https://t.co/qgyFedqVEB
Matthews also cited a slogan from the Spanish Civil War, "They Shall Not Pass", to apply to SCOTUS nominee. Problem is, that slogan ("No Pasaran!") was used by the Communist side in that war -- and they LOST, bigly (or big league). https://t.co/oGtja4PxNo
Democrats indignant effort to block a Republican president and Republican Senate, from replacing a retiring Republican justice in an orderly, timely way, demonstrates the hyper-partisan gamesmanship that voters rejected in 2016, and should reject again in November. 4/4
This time, it's the President's own party, not the opposition, that controls the Senate. Dems are a Senate minority, with no chance of a Democrat president taking office till 2021--at the earliest.  Empty Supreme Court seat for more than 2 years?! 3/4
Liberals argue that Republicans delayed consideration of Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, until after the 2016 election. But that time the opposition party – the GOP – already controlled the Senate and hoped to win the White House in a mere five months. 2/4
The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, led Senate Democrats to make a ridiculous demand: insisting that the majority Republicans delay approval of any Trump nominee in case Democrats win control of the Senate, and can then block the president’s choice. 1/4
Dark horse for #SCOTUS? The President of Portugal, Marcelo Robelo de Sousa, spoke beautifully at the @WhiteHouse about our long alliance with his country, showed real chemistry with @POTUS, and announced that he's a Professor of Constitutional Law. So.....
If #ChuckSchumer and company try to rally the base with a "Revenge for Garland" rallying cry ("Remember the Merrick!") it will appeal to activists &amp; insiders while assuring the defeat of Democratic efforts to capture the Senate.
#Primaries show Dems are moving far, far to the left. Open socialist Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) wins NY upset; @BenJealous wins in MD; @jaredpolis in CO. Meanwhile, for #GOP, mainstream (and #Trump-endorsed) candidates won in NY, SC &amp; elsewhere. Sets up great shot for GOP wins!
You've got to hand it to #JusticeKennedy: announcing his resignation after a series of recent rulings where his votes with the pro-Constitution majority demonstrated his conservative bona fides &amp; shored up his legacy.
It's true that @realDonaldTrump likes to appoint people to high office from @FoxNews. Does this mean that Judge Andrew Napolitano (@Judgenap) and Judge JeanninePirro (@jeaninepirro) are on the short list for #SCOTUS?
An open seat - a swing seat! - at #SCOTUS. Is it possible there will be a "spirited" confirmation fight? If @POTUS &amp; @SenateMajLdr move quickly enough, shouldn't they try for a confirmation before the election?
Part of the idiocy: even if you believe SCOTUS ruling is anti-Muslim and reflects "religious bigotry", how, in the name of heaven, does it amount to "racism" - when Muslims are white, Asian and black as well as "Middle Eastern"? https://t.co/lZjRQBGT8h
RT @JamesHasson20: Damn the Supreme Court and its obsession with...legal rules. https://t.co/9dTIC5uILZ
Today's #SCOTUS decision makes sense since the latest "#MuslimBan" isn't really a Muslim ban. Distinctions based solely on religion may be unconstitutional but it's sensible- and legal -to treat travelers differently if their countries of origin support or tolerate terrorism.
Posthumous Medals of Freedom have been presented in the past. @BillClinton, for instance, presented the medal posthumously to the tennis great, #ArthurAshe.
.@POTUS should award a posthumous Medal of Freedom to a great American: the late #CharlesKrauthammer. I know there was bad blood between Charles and #Trump, but the president would show real class (and disarm his critics) by presenting this great (well-deserved) nat'l honor.
Wow! FOR @glennbeck, his courage and sincerity come across powerfully &amp; unmistakably in his @CNN confrontation with @brianstelter. Agree or disagree on politics or policy, you have to appreciate the concern for this polarized country he's trying to express.
Sometimes, people can be great-looking- truly stunning -but still empty-headed, clueless &amp; dumb. That's also the case with some movies: #JurassicWorld2 is one. It's gorgeous to look at, impressive to behold, but still incurably silly. Will review on radio show today.
There's one aspect of @MELANIATRUMP 's "jacket flap" that is entirely defensible: press reports indicate that the Zara garment she wore cost only $39- very reasonable for a woman in her position. The jacket's message? Not so reasonable.
While govt reorganization is well worth pursuing, the idea of a new  #SpaceForce is not. That doesn't mean #NASA can't be reformed and improved, but let's not do so in a way so easily mocked as "Space Farce".
The @realDonaldTrump plan for govt reorganization is excellent, really - the handiwork of administration MVP @MickMulvaneyOMB. The idea of rationalizing a sprawling, disjointed fedl bureaucracy is long overdue. Here's a priority to unite all conservatives.
So unspeakably sad to lose the wonderful #charleskrauthammer at this painful moment in our national conversation! Even when you disagreed with him, you had to admire him; in contrast to some prominent politicians, where even when you agree with them, you can't respect them.
Rather than simply declaring "good riddance" to Republican defectors like #SteveSchmidt, why not challenge the thinking behind such defections? Yes, #GOP is imperfect in representing conservative principle, but what conservative- or even moderate- principles do Democrats uphold?
All agree immigration system is broken; why not fix it? #ImmigrationCompromise that House considers today is flawed, but still an improvement. Why expect a better chance for conservative reform next year? we'll have FEWER #GOP members- even if Republicans do keep their majority.
If anyone doubts the real problem of #MediaBias, consider the contemptuous coverage of @MELANIATRUMP visiting the border to meet with migrant kids. @FLOTUS is demonstrating compassion, after she helped her husband do the right thing yesterday. Why the snarky, dismissive tone?
RT @RubinReport: On with @MedvedSHOW right now!
An obvious contradiction in justifications for #Trump policy regarding migrant families? On the one hand, apologists say it's just a continuation of tough #Obama polices; on the other hand, Obama (and other Dems) get slammed for being "pathetically weak", favoring "open borders)
You know it's a real, Code Red crisis: @POTUS went so far as to cancel the Congressional Picnic! Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Hurray for @SenAlexander (R-TN)! At WH meeting he just urged @POTUS to follow example of #NixonInChina by making unexpected, bold progress on real immigration reform. No one could suspect Nixon of being soft on Communism and no one suspects #Trump of being soft on immigration.
OK, I'll claim a very welcome "I toldya so": since the issue emerged, I've assured radio listeners that @POTUS would END family separation at the border &amp; would do so by the end of this week. This is hardly a triumph for the WH, but at least they're ready to cut their losses.
.@jeffsessions says Nazis "tried to keep Jews from leaving the country"?! Not true! Hitler drove out German Jews (like my mother &amp; her parents) then stole their stuff. Problem was: US (and most other countries) often unwilling to take them. Fake History is as bad as fake news.
With the economy humming along - surging growth, low unemployment, rising wages - why should @realDonaldTrump mess it up with a new trade war against the world? How about "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" or the Hippocratic rule, "First, do no harm"?
Current #Trump strategy of blaming Dems or Congress for govt dysfunction (chaos &amp; pain at border; dysfunction in DOJ/FBI) won't work. @realDonaldTrump is guy in charge- if he can't control the executive branch, he looks weak-undermines his preferred image of power and strength.
@AlexBerezow @TomlinMedia Are you kidding? A 3 to 3 tie doesn't stir my soul. But still, in honor of your wife (and other reasons) I'm rooting for Poland (and England) to win it all. But all of what, I don't know.

Dems should stop freaking out over @realDonaldTrump saluting back at a NKorean general. Simple courtesy of two "officers" (Trump is Comm-in-Chief) saluting one another. When @BarackObama bowed to Saudi #KingAbdullah in 2009, however, the monarch made no attempt to bow back.
Who's worth supporting in the #WorldCup? England, of course--to keep the world safe from angry English soccer hooligans-- and Poland, because a Polish victory would deeply annoy the tourney's Russian hosts.

Starbuck's #HowardSchultz is a good guy and his challenge to Dems ("How're we gonna pay for all this stuff?") is encouraging. Even if he doesn't run for President, he could win in 2020 as an Independent  candidate for Governor of Washington State.
It's reasonable to worry that pardon policy from @POTUS might send a message that  celebrities deserve special handling. But in the case of @DineshDSouza, he got harsher, not more lenient treatment due to his celeb status- with punishment wildly disproportionate to his crime.
You can make the argument that both @therealroseanne barr and @iamsambee (#SamanthaBee) deserve firing; you can also say they both deserve forgiveness (my producer @GregTomlinShow does). But the only basis for firing one, while forgiving the other, is ideological bias.
On #Gaza, the @nytimes describes "24 hrs of cross border blows"-equating #Hamas mortar attacks &amp; #Israel's retaliatory raids.The distinction the media ignore: #Hamas aims at civilians, #Israel targeted 65 MILITARY sites; Israel seeks to halt violence,Hamas wants to perpetuate it.
Okay, both epic @WhiteHouse meetings (@KimKardashian &amp; @realDonaldTrump ; #Nixon &amp; #Elvis) involved drug enforcement: Kim to get a pardon for a questionably incarcerated dealer, Elvis to get a badge certifying him as a special agent for the #DEA. (not a joke).
Those who are mocking @realDonaldTrump for meeting with @KimKardashian should just remember: the most requested photo in WH history shows #PresidentNixon conferring with the other Leader of the Free World at the time: #Elvis.
Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. @kathygriffin deserved career wreckage after her #TrumpBeheaded "joke", just as @therealroseanne earned harsh consequences for her vile jest about terrorists, apes and #ValerieJarrett. What did she expect?
Idea for @ABCNetwork: why not write the #Roseanne character out of their show (she suffers a sudden deadly accident?) and allow the other talented people in the cast to carry on the story of the newly single Dan Connor? The creators, co-stars of the show did nothing wrong here.
Supporters of @realDonaldTrump should be particularly pleased that @ABCNetwork has canceled the new @therealroseanne show. Why would any American patriot want to be represented on TV by a racist, conspiracist nut?
Nearly all American families include someone-cousin,grandfather or ancestor-who made the ultimate sacrifice. On #MemorialDay worth considering what they died for--surely not the petty,degrading politics (on all sides) that presently prevails. As JFK suggested: "We can do better."
Yes,?#JohnBolton was wrong to invoke the "Libya model" re'#NKorea &amp; for @VP Pence to repeat the analogy. Isn't it predictable that a dictator under pressure to give up nukes might react badly to talk of a prior denuclearized dictator whose mutilated body was dumped in the desert?
Those who condemned @realDonaldTrump for agreeing to a #NKorea summit should now congratulate him for canceling it. But instead, those who hate him will hate everything he does, and those who love him will hail every decision, no matter how dubious, as a masterful maneuver.
If scheduling the summit with #NKorea was a magnificent achievement, worthy of a Nobel Prize, how can canceling that summit also be a great thing? Too many observers judge every development based on their attitude toward #Trump, not the nature of the event itself.
Breakthrough in the Texas primary? @nytimes hails 70 yr old Democrat @LupeValdez as "the first openly gay and first Latina nominated for the state's governor." Hey, this is #Texas --what could possibly go wrong?
Saddened to hear of the passing of #PhilipRoth at 85. I had no affection for his leftist politics or atheist hostility toward Jewish faith,but as a writer he was amazingly productive, often brilliant. Hard not to sigh at his legacy; he left behind some 25 novels, but no children.
Dems hope to win #Georgia governorship, hailing "excitement" of their base. But number of voters who cast primary votes for GOP candidates (608,000) much higher than all who voted on the Democratic side (553,000). @staceyabrams may be be impressive, but faces an uphill struggle.
Missed the last three days of news bulletins, baseball scores and even tweets---  on Saturday, for the sabbath, and then the Jewish holiday of #Shavuot (Pentecost, Feast of Weeks), Sunday &amp; Monday. Eager to get back to the fray - and the show- on Tuesday!

When conservatives express outrage it's usually over some awful action-terrorist attack, cop-killing, theft,vandalism. When libs express outrage it's often over some awful comment-offensive tweet, cruel insult.But actions speak louder than words;we win this argument every time.
Yes, @POTUS is right: #MS-13 thugs ARE animals. But so are all human beings, ultimately, right? Of all the "Much Ado About Nothing" #FakeNews nonsense about @realDonaldTrump , this is among the most embarrassing for the media - and hardly Shakespearean.
.@Janefonda, #DianeKeaton, #CandiceBergen &amp; @MarySteenburgen seem to enjoy themselves immensely as stars of @BookClub movie. And despite scattershot aim of the comedy, that spirit of frisky fun is infectious for the audience.
Only 2 choices for Israelis as they face thousands of angry "protesters" trying to destroy the fence and swarm into Israel. Violent activists need to be stopped at the border or else halted after they've crossed that border.And that second choice would cause far worse casualties.
The media would still cover Palestinian protests obsessively , even without bloodshed. But what is Israel supposed to do about 40,000 crazed fanatics with molotov cocktails and chants of "death to the Jews" pledging to march to Jerusalem to "make the Jews burn"?
Yes, violence is ugly at the Gaza border and a simple change by one side could avoid it easily in the future. easily. Palestinians can still stage huge, noisy protests but if they held them on their side of the border, far from the fence &amp; Israeli troops, no one need die.
Choice for #Israelis at the Gaza border was to stop violent "protestors" before they broke through the fence,or stop them only after they crossed into Israeli territory.If they had waited to turn them away till they entered Israel,death toll would have been thousands, not dozens.
Of course, there's a reflexive media tendency to blame @realDonaldTrump for everything that's sick or ugly in our world, but how can you blame him (or the embassy move) for the sick, ugly, fanatical Jew-hatred of #Hamas--which began decades before #Trump ever ran for president.
@nikkihaley spoke beautifully at #UNSecurityCouncil. "No nation in this chamber would have acted with more restraint than Israel has."
If real #Palestinian motivation is to live under Palestinian control, then why risk death to march OUT of Palestinian-controlled #Gaza into #Israel, with its 75% Jewish majority? This is not a "March of Return" but a March of Destruction-to eliminate world's only Jewish state.
RT @IMAO_: I think you're always going to have tension in the Middle East when there's people who want to kill the Jews and Jews who don't…
.@RajShah45 doing superb job at WH press briefing. One inane question: "Shouldn't Israel take some blame for Gaza deaths?" He could've answered with another question (in Jewish tradition): what other strategy COULD have minimized Gaza deaths, given #Hamas desire to maximize them.
Those claiming #Jerusalem embassy move CAUSED the violent "protests" in Gaza, forget that this date has been considered "#Nakba Day" (Catastrophe Day) since 1998 - when designated by #Arafat. Palestinian terrorists oppose Israel's existence, not just the location of our embassy.
Only thing dumber than cable news obsession with a promised WH apology for an aide's awful remark re' @SenJohnMcCain, is the lack of just such an apology. Why not say "sorry",then go after the wretched leaker who passed the private remark to the press,&amp; quickly fire him (or her).
With all the criticism of #Israel regarding the handling of the violent demonstrations in #Gaza, I've heard nothing suggesting a better approach. It thousands of fanatics who are loudly committed to destroying your country are rushing the border, are you supposed to welcome them?
Absolutely right. https://t.co/W7LImwl7Oz
Headline at @CNN: "Dozens Killed in Protests as U.S. Embassy Opens in Jerusalem." True, as far as it goes, but deeply misleading: does anyone believe that if the embassy (@usembassyjlm) hadn't moved, Hamas would give up its  demonstrations calling for Israel's destruction?
I've never liked @soccer (the wrong "football"), but this is both amusing and touching. Maybe the team will now win so much that its loyal Israeli fans will get tired of winning. https://t.co/flVfsp8QFq
If it's true, as General John Kelly says, that illegal immigrants don't "easily assimilate," how does locking them in permanent illegal status help their assimilation? Since we want all immigrants to Americanize, wouldn't a demanding path to earned legal status aid that process?
The year is young, but #SuicideOfTheWest, the great new book by @JonahNRO (Jonah Goldberg), is sure to be one of the best of 2018. He's on the radio show today, 4 PM, ET. Can't wait!
My friend @SenJohnMcCain has always enjoyed controversy and sure, there are some good folks who hate his guts. But right now, at this stage in his illustrious career,he's the most powerful unifying force in our country-God bless him. How proud he &amp; his beautiful family should be!
Yes, derisive comments about @SenJohnMcCain by WH aide @kellysadler45 are regretable, but the bigger villain here is the staff member who leaked those comments to the press. That's the WH aide--whoever it is-- who ought to be identified, condemned--and fired.
On the show today, two of the best possible voices, from #Jerusalem, on the current situation in #Israel: #MichaelRubin of @AEI &amp; #JonathanMedved (who I know very well) of @OurCrowd .
The biggest, unanswerable question regarding last night's Iranian attacks on #Israel: what's the provocationpretext? The very existence of a Jewish state in the Middle East may be offensive to the #Mullahs, but it's hardly a recent development.
Great statement from unidentified Israeli security expert, regarding rocket attacks from Iranian assets in Syria: "If it rains in #Israel, it will pour in #Iran."
Govt ought to encourage helpful conduct, discourage destructive behavior, right? But #SeattleHeadTax does exactly the opposite. Taxing the biggest employers to provide more "homeless services" means punishing job creators to reward those who camp in public parks, under freeways.
.@nytimes story "Thrifty Brooklyn Secretary Leaves $8 Million for Needy Students" has sparked universal praise, but what if she had left her $ to kids of her own, or other designated individuals, rather than organizations? Libs then would want to seize most of it in death taxes.
Listen to WH legislative director @Marcshort45, setting the stage for #IranDeal decision by @POTUS, it's obvious that he is- by far -most effective, of #Trump's press representatives. Reasonable, articulate, judicious - reassuring rather than alarming. Compare to Rudy G!
If Dems believe that #GinaHaspel is "disqualified" from heading #CIA because of her long experience loyally implementing the agency's policies, aren't they saying, in essence, that only a director from outside the agency is acceptable? What an idiotic notion.
Greg (@TomlinMedia) nailed it! It's obvious here that white students were also hustled off stage when they showboated and delayed an already tedious ceremony, not just black graduates....or should black students get more time on stage to make up for past injustice? https://t.co/0v26wJ1lrs
Former GOP Senator &amp; Sec of Def #WilliamCohen just suggested on @CNN that @POTUS should make a noble, timely gesture &amp; honor @SenJohnMcCain -NOW!-with the #MedalOfFreedom. This would help heal the sad, unnecessary rift between @POTUS and a great patriot. Do it now!
Sound advice! https://t.co/NARs556uKI
The essence of the fight between conservative media &amp; "mainstream media" is over what kind of movie Americans are we watching in the #Trump era: is it a scary monster movie, or a thrilling flick about a superhero? But both sides agree it's a thriller.
"Where does it end?" When @CNN's @jaketapper joins me on the show today, I'll ask him to anticipate outcome of media obsession with #Mueller probe &amp; charges of collusion- also talk about his fine new novel, #TheHellfireClub.
Congratulations, #RudyGiuliani! Your @FoxNews interviews inspired controversy regarding "hush money for a porn star," but your comments about @jaredkushner will surely find a place in #BatlettsFamiliarQuotations. Quoth Hizzoner: "Men are disposable." Feminists may intone, "Amen."

Message for Hollywood from weekend: #WHCorrespondentsDinner bombed (bigly), but #AvengersInfinintyWar set box office records. Why? The DC event gagged on unfunny lefty smugness, while the #Disney/#Marvel movie avoided politics for entertainment value. Very different results!
At this weekend's  #MichiganRally for @realDonaldTrump, the crowd reportedly chanted, "Nobel! Nobel!" Whether or not you support @POTUS for the #PeacePrize, it's a lot better to hear that than hear "Lock her Up!", isn't it?
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is stuffed with lovable characters, classy actors, battle-scenes, nifty special effects and a few welcome laughs, but did it really need to last 2 hours &amp; 40 minutes? My review:		https://t.co/dyDsZc2DEF
Deutschland wins this one: the German-speaking translator for the Merkel-Trump press conference is infinitely more competent than the halting, incomprehensible  translator from the French at the Macron-Trump press conference. Wunderbar!
The most popular line in @AvengersInfinityWar comes in the final stages of this long, lavish epic (2 hr 40 min running time). "The end is near," the villain Thanos intones and many audience members will applaud.
Amazing moment! In addition to the stunning news from #Korea, there's this: considering Germany's history between 1870-1945, isn't it breathtaking to see a US President urging a German Chancellor to spend MORE on her military?
Gotta say it: this is a golden moment for #Philadelphia sports: @Eagles are #SuperBowl champs, @VillanovaU won NCAA, @sixers looking great in NBA playoffs, &amp; even the once-hapless @Phillies unexpectedly strong- right behind the @Mets. How to explain this sudden good fortune?

On #FoxAndFriends, @POTUS said that the "witch hunt" against him is a "disgrace", perpetrated by the DOJ &amp; "a lot of people who shouldn't be there". As chief of the executive branch (including Dept of Justice), isn't he obligated to clear out "people who shouldn't be there"?
That's TWO great men of dignity and honor. Thanks for posting this, Russell. https://t.co/nHDfnQaLx5
Mainstream media spin even #GOP victories as dire warnings of impending conservative doom. In #ArizonaSpecialElection, Republican candidate #Lesko wins her Congressional seat by 5.2% against a lavishly funded Dem, and their side absurdly claims "moral victory". Balderdash!
Market flirting with a 500 pt decline (#DJIA) today: powerful reminder that economy isn't the most important thing, it's the only thing. (Paraphrasing V.Lombardi). If growth continues, #Trump likely survives, succeeds. If economy crashes, an incalculable disaster for GOP--&amp; USA.
Honestly, #Macron exerts a powerfully positive influence on @POTUS. Their joint press conference, at least so far, offers one of #Trump's most capable performances in this sort of setting. Maybe not "magnifique" but "tres bonne".
Maybe #Macron can solidify his "special relationship" with @realDonaldTrump by helping him replicate that big, beautiful military parade that @POTUS so much admired when he was in Paris last year!
.@realDonaldTrump could hardly look more bored &amp; confused than he does listening to #Macron speaking lucidly, at some length, in French. I know they're  great pals but this beautiful friendship is being undermined by language barriers and a lame, struggling translator.Sacre bleu!
.@nytimes runs admiring headline, "Transition of Power in Cuba Sends a Signal on Diversity, Too"; photo caption notes "members of Council of State are notably diverse." Not true! They are all COMMUNISTS and loyal backers of a murderous regime-not "diverse" at all.
And yes, this is also a great moment for South Korean #PresidentMoon. If this leads to meaningful agreement, and peace for the Peninsula, he will be a candidate for a #NobelPeacePrize - more worthy than Gore, or Arafat, certainly! Meanwhile, remember: trust - but verify!
News on #NorthKorea sounds amazing - and wonderful. What a beautiful way to go into the weekend. Now, can #MikePompeo get some credit for his meetings with Kim that made this possible? Confirm him now! Congratulations to @POTUS- potentially, a profoundly significant achievement!

Latvian composer #EriksEsenvalds is the real deal: a 21st Century artist of sincere spiritual depth. The recent release of mystical choral music on @naxosrecords "The Doors of Heaven" is a revelation, in stunning sound.
Calls to fire #Mueller, or #Rosenstein might appeal to true-believers in #Trump's base, but they do a disservice to both president &amp; country. Trying to block an ongoing investigation wouldn't end the problems for this presidency; it would extend and deepen them.
If @POTUS DID fire #Rosenstein or #Mueller, it wouldn't stop the investigation or prosecutions. #MichaelCohen is now a criminal target of the US Att'y in Manhattan, aside from Mueller. To try to block that office's efforts would open #Trump to new, serious charges of obstruction.
Challenge for both Dems and #GOP: we all know what you're against, but what are you for? What's your positive agenda for 2019? With reformist idea-man @SpeakerRyan, GOP had a powerful advantage in facing that challenge. And now....
I try to see good side of everything, but what's positive-for USA or GOP- about the news that @SpeakerRyan is leaving Congress? No one's been more important in keeping Republicans together &amp; focused. At least this could be good for the #Ryan family. I hope so; they deserve it.

Should we stop police shootings by taking guns away from all cops?Absurd! Better to focus on handful of troubled cops who don't deserve a gun-or a badge. Same logic goes for civilian gun-owners: guns no problem with law-abiding folks, but problematic for the violent or unstable.
If the #CohenRaid was authorized by the (Trump-appointed) US attorney in NY, then firing #Mueller (and #Rosenstein) wouldn't end the investigation. He'd also have to try to can US Att'y #GeoffBerman, FBI director #ChristopherWray, and more. Good luck with that.
.@POTUS alleged federal agents staged a "break in" at his lawyer's  office- claiming Special Counsel, US Attorney in NY &amp; the FBI Director-all appointees of his administration-colluded in a "disgraceful...attack on our country." #Pence &amp; Bolton beside him looked uncomfortable.
The worst part of @realDonaldTrump's explosion about the #CohenRaid wasn't disrespect for #Mueller, it was disrespect for the gravity of the situation with #Syria. He would have done much better to focus his righteous wrath on a murderous dictator, not an American prosecutor.

The connection between "killing" and abortion is obvious, if debatable. But the connection between killing and support of gun rights ranges somewhere between remote &amp; non-existent. How, then, does @NRA, but not #PlannedParenthood, have "bloody hands"?
If pro-life conservatives claimed that politicians who supported #PlannedParenthood "had blood on their hands", they'd be condemned for irresponsible hyperbole. Why, then, do anti-gun activists who make similar claims about politicos backing the @NRA hailed as courageous heroes?
The #MuellerInvestigation must be serious &amp; sober-about foreign meddling to undermine democracy. If the #SpecialCounsel got distracted by probing #Trump's alleged one-night-stand with a porn star, it would cheapen &amp; discredit his whole operation. He won't go there-and shouldn't.
On @60Minutes, speculation that #RobtMueller's investigation might involve #StormyDaniels thru @MichaelCohen212 connection. Obvious analogy: @KenStarr got involved w #Lewinsky through non-related Whitewater probe. But I can't imagine Mueller would follow Starr's ill-fated example
I expected my reaction to the #StormyDaniels interview would be disgust, but actually it's sadness. One ends up feeling sorry for Stormy, for #Trump, and  (oddly) for his whole family &amp; staff. Least sympathetic characters in the melodrama? The media sharks, feasting on the story.

And as to the #MarchForOurLives  idea that they're marching for "real change," enhanced gun regulation would bring notable change only for those law-abiding firearm owners (or would-be owners) who choose to follow the details of federal, state and local laws.
Painfully earnest youngsters of the #MarchForOurLives claim they are marching for "change" &amp; "justice." How does "justice" demand restricting access to firearms for your law-abiding, sane neighbors? How is it "unjust" to allow them to choose to acquire guns for their own defense?
.@POTUS is right to sign the spending bill AND to promise that he'll never sign such a bill again. He is wrong, however, to demand an end to the filibuster rule in the Senate. Some day, without doubt, there will be a Dem Senate and we will be thankful for the 60 vote threshold.
If @POTUS really vetos the #Omnibust budget, he may please his base but he'll wreck prospects for GOP to hold its House majority. If Republicans preside over 3 (count 'em, 3!) govt. shutdowns, with no progress at all on deficits, how do they make the case to keep them in charge?

In new movie @7DaysInEntebbe, the lead German terrorist (played by #DanielBruhl) is called Wilfried Bose (spelled with an umlaut) - real name of the real character.  God (or fate's) sense of humor: Bose (w umlaut) means "wicked" or "evil" in German.

@amychua , best-selling author (BATTLE HYMN OF THE TIGER MOTHER) and Yale Law School professor in- studio to talk about her new book POLITICAL TRIBES. Always great to speak with one of the most provocative minds in the country! https://t.co/04CX71g8A7
When @realDonaldTrump meets with #LittleRocketMan, will they dine together? Big question: what's on the menu? Honor #Trump with Big Macs, or show cultural sensitivity to #Kim by dining on dog?

Columnist @LeonardPittsJr1 urges @POTUS to "ignore April 4"-50th anniversary of MLK killing-because of #Trump's rocky relationship to the black community. But if #Trump actually took this advice, wouldn't it amount to a callous insult &amp; a real blow to the cause of American unity?
What's so terrible about tribal societies? The tribes waste all their time fighting one another, rather than building for the common good. Prof @amychua of Yale Law School, famous as the "Tiger Mother," joins the show Thurs to discuss her new book #PoliticalTribes, 4 PM ET.

Wouldn't it make sense for #GovPhilBryant to appoint @HaleyBarbour to the soon-to-be-open MS Senate seat? No, this DC insider wouldn't help "drain the swamp" but he'd give MS significant clout and immediately become an influential force for conservative reform.
Ha! @CNN features a big graphic under the heading DEPARTED that features photos of all the cabinet members, WH staff who have resigned. Reminds me of the "Clinton Circle of Death" charges 25 yrs ago! At least no one accuses #Trump of murdering his former aides - so far.
Two possible explanations for contrasting treatment of #StormyDaniels &amp; #PaulaJones: 1) the accusations of Paula seemed more credible or 2) standards have changed in 25 yrs, with press &amp; public more forgiving of personal, presidential imperfections. I go with the 2nd explanation.
When #PaulaJones sued #BillClinton it became a media obsession and led, ultimately, to impeachment. With #StormyDaniels suing @realDonaldTrump, it's barely a blip &amp; few expect serious consequences. Why the difference- especially since media loathe #Trump, but loved Clinton?
Conservatives slam @CNN,@MSNBC for giving so much time to #SamNunberg despite his addled, possibly inebriated state of mind. Fair question, but it raises another question. Why would #Trump campaign ever have given such an individual a position of responsibility in the 1st place?
Job opportunity: @EmmaWatson says she has an available "tattoo proofreading position" after omitting the apostrophe in the "Time's Up" script inscribed on her forearm. Should @BrownUniversity ask her to return her degree?
Is it merely coincidence that it's a gloriously sunny day in #Seattle - best of the yr so far - just as it becomes official that the peerless #Ichiro is coming back to the #SeattleMariners? O joy O rapture unforeseen/the sky above is now serene!
The day after, a plaintive theme emerges from last night's #Oscars: "We've learned our lessons!" : Learned lessons about 1) #MeToo , 2) #OscarsSoWhite and even 3) about giving #WarrenBeatty the right envelope for #BestPicture. Not deserving of hosannas, but well-intentioned steps
I know they were making a big deal of this being the 90th #Oscars, which is why they began with that odd black-and-white footage. But the result was a show that felt tired &amp; old: despite #RitaMoreno's amazing vitality &amp; grace at age 86.
One mystery of the #Oscars how did they ever come up with that glitzy, incredibly tacky set? More appropriate for a chintzy revue at a 3rd class Vegas hotel, or a 1950's edition of #IceCapades. Or maybe it was borrowed from a touring company of the upcoming musical of #Frozen.
A big night for Latin-Americans at #Oscars: Wins for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Foreign Film, Best Song, Best Animated Film. But even though director of #ShapeOfWater is proudly Mexican,the film's only Latino character is the silent #RiverMonster, captured from the Amazon.
Few explicit slams on @POTUS at #Oscars, but #JimmyKimmel did target tjhe VP. "We don't make movies like CALL ME BY YOUR NAME to make money," he said. "We make them to upset #MikePence." That's almost true: many "Oscar-bait" projects are more concerned with messages than money.
Inevitable that #MeToo would receive numerous mentions at the #Oscars. But despite the horrors of #HarveyW &amp; co, and #FrancesMcDormand's demand that all women in the gilded audience "stand up", it's ludicrous to see the women of H'wood as an oppressed group of perennial victims.
Highlight of #Oscars: appropriate tribute to US military "serving around the world." Unexpected; refreshing. Lowlight: #FrancesMcDormand's BestActress acceptance speech, with its manic cackle, invocation of female victimhood.

Why is #HopeHicks departure such an intense media obsession? It's not just her status as long-time loyalist in the Trump inner circle. Part of it, as everyone knows (but won't say), is the way she looks. Images of a beautiful woman grab attention. Period. Hope, we hardly knew ye!

An uncomfortable question for #GenJohnKelly: if @jaredkushner can't get a top secret security clearance, could @realDonaldTrump? The same objections would probably apply--though more than 60 million voters clearly wanted to override them.
.@CNN gleefully described @jaredkushner "roaming the halls of the White House with his downgraded security status" as if he were lost, exiled, all doors closed to him. He may be a misguided choice as a top aide but the president has a near absolute right to pick his own advisors.
.@LannyDavis, a loyal supporter of @HillaryClinton, joins my radio show today to argue that #JamesComey improperly tilted the election. A blistering attack on #FBI corruption &amp; malfeasuance -- from the center-left! Will @realDonaldTrump enjoy it? Listen at 5 EST.
@SuePrager Corporations don't want unlimited new immigration, but they also don't want mass deportation of current employees.
@SuePrager Actually, if you look at the immigration plan that President Bush pushed in 2007, it emphasized E-Verify as a crucial element -- so did the "Gang of 8" reform that passed the Senate with 14 Republican votes in 2013.
@brianschatz This is not the way to get things done, Senator.  May play to your base, but won't persuade any of your more reasonable colleagues.  How about trying to convince those who disagree, rather than "beating" them?
Even among all those who love @realDonaldTrump and celebrate his real accomplishments, do you think it's a good idea for the Leader of the Free World to use his #CPAC platform to do a dramatic reading of "The Snake" for the 1,000th time?
Is it too much to hope that this will be the last #CPAC, ever, where the  crowd chants "Lock Her Up" &amp; "Build That Wall"? A year from now, may border security be effectively enhanced, and #Hillary retired as a target &amp; as potential president.
In #Trump's speech at #CPAC, his ebullience was infectious, and he admirably energized the troops. But really, was it necessary to attack @SenJohnMcCain? Sure, I wish McCain had voted differently on #Obamacare, but @POTUS still needs his vote, and we all want his speedy recovery.

Yes, it's ridiculous to rank #Trump as our #WorstPresidentEver after just 1 yr in office...but even more absurd to list #WilliamHenryHarrison as 3rd from the bottom when he served as POTUS just 30 days-most of them when he was dying from pneumonia! How did he hurt the country?
#BlackPanther is good news for Hollywood, great news for America. Regardless of the movie's shortcomings (I saw many), a film with a predominantly black cast won overwhelming enthusiasm from predominantly white audiences-showing racism is not as toxic in US as activists may fear.
The desperate desire to "do something", anything, after a hideous crime is natural, inevitable, but irrational. How about taking time to do something constructive? We could start by agreeing that a troubled 18 yr old like Cruz should never get legal access to an AR15.

Is it fair to blame @realDonaldTrump for what he doesn't say? No, it's monumentally UNFAIR. @CNN headline just now says, "TRUMP DEFENDS EX-AIDE, EXPRESSES NO SYMPATHY FOR WOMEN." Weasel words! Actually, "not expressing sympathy" is very different from "expressing no sympathy."

Watching #DefenseSecretaryMattis at the #WHPressBriefing one thought is inescapable: we should feel grateful that this wise warrior is serving our country, right where he is. God bless him!
Hot debate over #Trump's #BigParade is embarrassing! No, it's not an outrage if @POTUS wants a big celebration of our troops. And no, it's not "Un-American" to call it a waste of $. When posturing politicos can't even agree on a patriotic celebration, something's terribly wrong.
.#BudgetDeal announced by @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; @SenSchumer: it's a positive development. Wish they made corresponding cuts to cover all the new spending,but putting long-term (2 yr) plan in place should persuade voters that #GOP controlled DC is,finally,functioning for USA.
Will @POTUS now sing: "I love a parade,the tramping of feet/ I love every beat I hear of a drum/I love a parade, when I hear a band/I just want to stand and cheer as they come. That rat-a tat-tat, the blare of a horn.	That rat-a tat-tat, a bright uniform!"-Cotton Club show, 1931
When @POTUS says "I'd love to see a #shutdown" it makes it much easier to blame him for such a development - if it happens. Fortunately, it sounds like cooler heads will prevail, with a deal pending on the Senate side. Let's hope!
RT @TomlinMedia: .@jordanbpeterson is LIVE on the @MedvedSHOW now.  Listen here: 	https://t.co/YsbSuM06c2
Did @realDonaldTrump, looking ahead to the election, just say, "from '16 to '20, that's only two years...."?! (Well, Obama visited all 57 states). Do we remember fuzzy math? But @POTUS does seem to be in an especially sunny and genial mood, despite the market (@DowJones down 626)
.@CNN is running @realDonaldTrump live, bragging on and on about the economy, while an enlarged graphic on the right side of the screen shows the @DowJones plunging 530 points, dipping below 25,000. Ouch!--with another nasty, not-so-subtle jab at @POTUS.
Problem with the #immigration debate is that both sides talk about "giving something up." But what are Dems "giving up" to go along with enhanced border security? What is GOP giving up to allow a path to citizenship for American-raised young people who want it and deserve it?
Credible reports say @POTUS assured GOP Senators he will go to NV to campaign for @SenDeanHeller in his primary campaign against #DannyTarkanian, who'd be a sure loser in the general election. Bravo- this is the way a responsible party leader helps to protect his Senate majority!
Hey, Jamie! Thanks for the support on this ----in a day of madness and dismay, with a crashing market and humiliating GOP dysfunction --- great to get encouragement from fellow members of the #SanityCaucus. https://t.co/BpzIwy6UGh
#DowJones just sank 500 points since today's open...now way below 26,000. Just think about the exultant mood 3 days ago, after #Trump's fine #SOTU speech! Another reminder (along with pathetic #Memo kerfuffle) how quickly things can change in politics &amp; life.
I want @POTUS to succeed - so do nearly all conservatives. But how does it help #Trump to re-focus attention from an #ImmigrationDeal &amp; #GOPTaxCuts to the #RussiaConnection debate? Why tie fate of our President to compromised, fired, one-time "volunteer advisor" #CarterPage?
No one's damaged @POTUS more than #DevinNunes. Instead of basking in the glow of an outstanding #SOTU address, here we are, back to #WWF mud-wrestling over a disastrously-timed, brain-dead #Memo, focusing again on a #RussianConnection story that can't possibly help the president.
Most damaging allegation in #TheMemo is that surveillance of #CarterPage was political, based on Trump hatred, not nat'l security. But how is it "anti-Trump" to monitor a FORMER campaign aide, identified as a potential Russian agent years before Trump's campaign even began?
One incontestable fact: FBI concern over #CarterPage as a Russian agent began by 2013-long BEFORE Trump even began his campaign. How, then, is it "political" to seek surveillance of Page AFTER his short-lived, tangential participation in that campaign had ended?
Sorry, but all the hyper-ventilating over #TheMemo is ridiculous, embarrassing. How does it indicate illicit spying on the #Trump campaign--when #CarterPage RESIGNED from that campaign BEFORE the FISA application ever went through for surveillance on this one-time "advisor"?

Hate to break the news, but #DACA is more popular than #TheWall. New poll from Pew shows 74% back "permanent legal status" for Dreamers; but only 37% favor "expanding the wall along US border." Any deal combining wall expansion with very popular backing for DACA is a big GOP win.
To his great credit, @realDonaldTrump made real efforts to limit the damage &amp; inconvenience of the shameful #SchumerShutdown, in contrast to #Obama's malevolent determination to intensify pain from equally silly #CruzShutdown of 2013. Glad the idiocy ended more quickly this time.

#DACA was based on executive order-no Congressional OK. Revoked the same way-- and yes, @POTUS could extend the program past March  on his own, protecting DREAMERS from deportation while Congress works on permanent fix. Enough so Dems save face with their base, keep govt open?
With @SenSchumer closeted (ahem) with @realDonaldTrump at the White House the question is: what kind of smoke will come from the chimney? White smoke? (We have a deal!) Dark smoke? (Boo-hoo). Marijuana smoke? (Groovy-TGIF).
OK, last note on this (need to prepare a show): why not promulgate a new, highly relevant hashtag: #ShameOnSchumer ?
Everyone's asking the wrong question on #CountdownToShutdown. The issue isn't what DAMAGE a shutdown would do. The real question is what GOOD it would do. The obvious answer: it does no good at all. Helps no one, achieves absolutely nothing-- other than embarrassing all involved.
#Hollywood may love #TickTockThrillers--where you get just minutes to snip the right wire or the world blows up -- but government shouldn't. This "countdown to shutdown" isn't exciting, or meaningful, or defensible - just embarrassing. Shame on @SenSchumer, all the rest!

.@SenTomCotton &amp; @sendavidperdue now say they don't recall @POTUS using the  ugly "specific" phrase so often cited. They're trying to help, but this will only prolong the controversy: which GOP Sentator is telling the truth about "what the president said, and when he said it."
Just wondering: #Guatemala &amp; #Honduras were among only 8 nations that voted with USA at the UN General Assembly on the crucial issue of #Jerusalem. Do those Central American states also qualify as "***hole countries"?
.@SpeakerRyan spoke beautifully on his family's immigrant history, leaving unsaid the fact that many would have deemed 19th century #Ireland a "s***hole country." The "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" didn't often leave the most functional,prosperous nations of the world.
Then: religious conservatives rightly horrified with "expletives deleted" in #Nixon's White House tapes, but when #Trump uses even worse language in far more public settings, it's defensible? Or is that just a sign of 50 years of decline?  2/2
Contradictions?: #Nixon never was a favorite of religious conservatives, despite his long, loving marriage, honorable military service, etc. #Trump IS a favorite, despite checkered marital history, promotion of gambling casinos, beauty pageants, etc......1/2
Here's an example of the sick impact of partisan polarization: for decades, values conservatives have complained of debasement of public discourse. But when @POTUS says "s**hole countries" to Senators, and media report it, we blame CNN, not #Trump. Both sides deserve censure!
Immigrants ought to be judged on who they are, what they offer the US, not where they come from. That's the problem with the insane "diversity visa lottery." It's also the problem with @POTUS preferring Norwegians (any Norwegians!) to any folks from "s***hole countries."
#Arizona has 3 of the WORST imaginable choices for US Senate: #JoeArpaio?! #KyrstenSinema?! #KelliWard?! Fortunately, there will be a better alternative. @RepMarthaMcSally - your party (GOP), your state(AZ) your country (USA) all need you in this race!

Wow! @CNN is heaping praise on @POTUS regarding his engagement,his reasonable approach, on the immigration issue at WH meeting.If nothing else, the session today should end talk (for now,at least)that he's not "mentally fit" for the job. Today, he looks unequivocally presidential
Outstanding comments by @POTUS after his meeting with Congressional leaders of both parties - not kidding! #Trump sounds reasonable, constructive, informed, truly concerned about making progress on immigration reform. This morning should reassure all #DACA kids &amp; rest of America
How would @Oprah run against seasoned hard-left rivals like #Bernie, #Kamala, #Elizabeth, #Kirsten, etc? She'd campaign as practical problem solver vs strident ideologues; uniter vs dividers; positive energy source vs negative complainers. Victory in Dem primaries:easy to imagine
In upcoming #StateOfTheUnion, @POTUS will emphasize his 1st year's strengths: strong economy, progress against ISIS &amp; Iran, cuts in taxes &amp; regulation. Dems will focus not on state of the union but the state of #Trump's mind -a subject far more likely to inspire worry &amp; concern.
The conservative agenda would benefit from more focus on events in Iran, or avoiding a govt shutdown, and less debate on the President's mental health &amp; intelligence. But how can we avoid that debate when those concerns are raised, aggressive and repeatedly, by @POTUS himself?
Sorry, @POTUS: assuring the world that you're "stable" is not generally understood as an indicator of stability; reminding people that you're "like really smart" and a "genius" isn't frequently taken as a sign of high intelligence.
Among primary powers of any president is ability to set the agenda for public debate. Now, even Trump True Believers will find it tough to explain why it's a good idea to launch a spirited, new national argument over whether @realDonaldTrump is, in fact, "like really smart."

Core issue surrounding #GOPTaxBill: does a boost for US business mean a boost for the nation at large? The answer's an obvious yes: if business thrives it means more jobs,more raises, more profits, more opportunity. How does success for US corporations hurt ordinary Americans?
"Golden Oldie" @BernieSanders is going back to his greatest hits: denouncing "trickle down economics" and proclaiming the #GOPTaxCuts as "a disaster for the American people." Does that mean #UncleBernie is now so invested in that prediction that he will become a @DisasterArtist ?
The shocking truth: even on @CNN, commentator Abby Phillips acknowledges: "Let's be clear. This is a REAL tax cut. People are going to see more money." Hallelujah!
Hope that @SpeakerRyan uses that giant gavel to pas the bill a 2nd time: it's like #Mjolnir, the magic hammer employed by the Mighty #Thor. That's been described as "one of the most powerful, fearsome weapons in existence."

@jpodhoretz Don't forget The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)....or the Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930) which (contra Pat Buchanan) helped considerably in provoking world wide depression? So many other candidates for this particular Hall of Shame

On @CNN, @MaeveReston says: "Republican strategists felt they had to have this victory." OK but it would be worth adding: "For nearly all Republicans, this is a matter of deep conviction; they're taking big political risks to do something they believe will help the country."
It's both amusing and amazing to watch mainstream media struggling to portray the #TaxCuts (the @HouseGOP is starting to vote now) as something other than a massive, historic victory for @GOP, conservatives and Trump Administration.
Biased @nytimes headline: "Unified Vote at UN Highlights Isolation of US on Jerusalem". More appropriate: "At UN, Veto of Anti-Israel Vote Shows US Resolve on Jerusalem." As PM @netanyahu said: "You lit a candle of truth. You dispel the darkness." #HappyHanukah!
Most outrageous element of hostile media reports on  #GOPTaxCuts: on eve of passage, big emphasis on how "unpopular" the bill is --without giving Republicans credit for their integrity &amp; courage, following conservative conviction rather than pursuing short term political gain.
Crying doom is not an effective long-term strategy. Dems suggest end of net neutrality means end of the world, as do GOP tax cuts, as does withdrawal from Paris accords, &amp; etc ad nauseum. At some point, wolf-criers expose themselves (ahem!) as over-reacting hysterics.
Nine Christian worshipers killed by a suicide bomber in Quetta, Pakistan, in church on Sunday. As Americans celebrate this cheerful #Christmas season, worth remembering the courage it takes to practice Christianity in troubled Pakistan, riddled with Islamic fanaticism.
Good for you, Bethany....and maybe we should point out (as some no doubt have) that those children who "fill our lives with joy" (yes they do) will also fill Ms. Coulter's bank account by funding her social security and medicare. Chag Sameach! https://t.co/2ySdFFDuU5
Terrible news on derailment of #AMTRAK train in #Dupont, WA, not far from our #Seattle home. May the injured &amp; mourners be healed, comforted. Painful reminder of how media work: our out-of-the-way corner of the continent gets national attention ONLY when the horrible happens.
@jpodhoretz So you don't want "the world to feel relieved." I loved Adam Driver in "Patterson" by the way, but here I can't believe that the fate of the universe depends upon such a callow and unimposing character
Well done, @SenBobCorker! That's what politics should be about -- moving from "no" to "yes", and embracing the good without demanding the perfect. https://t.co/WG7BwVqEyo
🎞️@starwars: The Last Jedi	Starring: Daisy Ridley, @JohnBoyega, @HamillHimself,	Effective &amp; competent, legions of devoted fans will embrace it, but....	My review: https://t.co/VQRYAS7Uza
The world can feel relieved that #StarWars:TheLastJedi is solid entertainment &amp; worthy addition to the series. BUT..miscasting of Adam Driver (#KyloRen) leaves a hole at center of the movie. Character meant to be be magnetic, potent, powerful, seems whiny-feckless, not formidable
@ReaganBattalion Thanks, honored by the hat tip! If there's one lesson above all others to take from President Reagan it's that affability and optimism trump anger -- big league (and bigly).
Will we ever be the same?!! https://t.co/bnvBeSFWeD
Major discovery in time for holidays: the Brit group #Septura is one of the best brass ensembles ever, with 5 glorious programs on the great @naxosrecords label. The Christmas album in particular is a timeless treasure.
In his 12/13 "Campaign Statement" #RoyMoore not only refuses to concede but attacks both Dems and GOP, saying "not a dime's worth of difference" between the 2 parties. This directly quotes another disgraced Alabaman: #GeorgeWallace. Is Moore also looking at a 3rd Party future?
RT @RepByrne: Joining the @MedvedSHOW right now to talk about last night’s election results and where Alabama goes from here. Tune in!
Yes, #RoyMoore lost badly with women (57-41%) but with WHITE women he WON big: 63-34% (even bigger margin 72-26% with white men). This shows core problem for Moore,Trump &amp; GOP in general isn't gender, it's race.Without better showing among non-whites,victory's all but impossible.
#Hanukkah Nightmare for secularists?! In Seattle's Westlake Center the city installs a sign to warn of a suspiciously religious "structure" (actually, a menorah) installed just outside the scrupulously non-religious "Holiday Village". Protecting purity of Solstice for Snowflakes! https://t.co/I6wKG1XXrL
Another message from #Alabama: if #GOP can't do better among black voters we won't win, and we won't deserve to win. #RoyMoore got 4% (!) of AL black vote; even #Trump did better (8% in 2016). An attempt to sustain a party based on white votes alone is doomed- even in deep South.
Biggest lesson from #AlabamaElection: Republicans can't win by merely energizing their base-not even in one of America's most conservative states.There must be some outreach to moderates, independents, alienated voters. #Bannon's strategy stands exposed as a formula for disaster.
Thank you, Mr. President. https://t.co/1A84J1HKlU
Very pleased, and relieved, to see this gracious and appropriate tweet from @realDonaldTrump. History will show that this is a good night for America, for the #GOP and, ultimately, for @POTUS. https://t.co/TcnV1Goem8
Why is #RoyMoore campaign focusing on Jews on election eve? At final rally, #KaylaMoore proudly announced to a wondering world: "One of our attorneys is a Jew! We have very close friends who are Jewish." Wow! Jewish population in #Alabama is 9,400, 0.2% of total--
Weakest defense for #RoyMoore claims whatever he did, it doesn't matter because he did it more than 30 yrs ago. But if any of the women are telling the truth then Moore's lying--not 30 yrs ago, but RIGHT NOW-on election eve. Shouldn't a pattern of lies disqualify any candidate?
Bad news is that two fools in the #Senate are calling on @POTUS to resign (fat chance) due to charges of sexual assault, harassment; good news is that they're not ridiculous enough to push for #impeachment (yet).

🎞️@ITonyaMovie 	Starring: @MargotRobbie, @AllisonBJanney, Sebastian Stan. 	Yes, the performances in this film will get serious Oscar consideration.	My review: https://t.co/FgE9yMN1oN
One of the worst ideas of the #Trump administration so far: embracing #RoyMoore &amp; doing a rally in Pensacola (near AL border) to support him. How can it possibly help @POTUS to link himself &amp; his administration to this deeply dubious nominee?
Movie fans know @MargotRobbie as a Hollywood glamor girl but her performance in I, TONYA shows her in a new light: front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar. This de-glamorized, brilliant performance does for her what MONSTER did for #CharlizeTheron.
.@MooreSenate inspired controversy by suggesting that the last time America was "great" was when slavery existed. But remember, that was also the "golden age" before women got the right to vote.
I'm no apologist for @realDonaldTrump, but today's @CNN obsession with Don Jr. and the infamous "Trump Tower Meeting" begins to seem obsessive, excessive-bordering on sick. Enough already! Wish that #Mueller would complete his work so we can begin to move on.
Good for Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) on @CNN: she rightly acknowledged the nuance and balance in the excellent statement by @POTUS: leaving final boundaries of #Jerusalem subject to negotiation.
Years ago psychologists talked about "reality therapy."That may be the function of Trump's #Jerusalem statement. Here's reality: no sane Palestinian could ever expect Israel to move its capital as part of some settlement.They haven't even made that demand in ongoing negotiations.
Strong statement by @POTUS recognizing #Jerusalem as Israeli capital: "This is nothing more than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do."
Palestinians want to "return" Old City &amp; East #Jerusalem to their control, but when did they ever exercise that control, exactly? All of Jerusalem has been Israeli since '67; Jordanian before that: 1948-67. British control, 1918-48, Turkish 1516-1918. Palestinian control? Never.
.#MainStreamMedia say @POTUS is "reversing" US policy on #Jerusalem but our policy has been a muddle for 50 yrs. We've always recognized J'lem as Israel's functioning capital,but pretended we don't. If #Trump handles it well, he won't "reverse" anything, could clarify everything.
Yeah, but this pathetic Murray-Murray embarrassment was ancient history, right, another era? Six months ago. Here in #Seattle, Mayor Murray's name has been conveniently scrubbed from all records and memories of local libs. https://t.co/9njReg2pWT
With #Democrats rushing to demand that @alfranken resign, is it too early to look back nostalgically to the "old days" (this summer) when this "Giant of the Senate" was considered a PRESIDENTIAL POSSIBILITY? Al, we hardly knew ye!

But the real #Churchill never fell for the comforting, pretty populist notion that leaders can take inspiration and direction from ordinary citizens. He knew- as did #Reagan, #Lincoln, #Thatcher - that great leaders must inspire and direct the masses, not the other way around 2/2
Yes, @DarkestHour is a great movie but one crucial scene sends a deeply misleading message. In the film, an uncertain #Churchill rides the Underground and gauges opinions from the common man before delivering his famous "We shall fight on the beaches" speech .......1/2
In midst of great #Pocahontas debate (is the name an ethnic slur when used by #Trump?), worth recalling that hard-core Native American activists don't like her: real Pocahontas married a white Englishman,converted to Christianity,changed her name to "Rebecca",died at 23 in 1617.

Grateful this holiday season to pianist #KirstenJohnson; her new CD #PatrioticPiano on the #Centaur label is a loving rendition of classic songs celebrating America, and added to our #Thanksgiving joy.
The only logical conclusion: @alfranken must keep the post to which he was elected (no matter how disgusting his pre-Senatorial behavior) &amp; @MooreSenate must be seated in the Senate if AL voters make the mistake of electing him.
If conservatives want @alfranken driven out of the Senate, then why would they support voting @MooreSenate into the Senate? Because Al admits to his 1 (so far) incident of harassment, but Roy (implausibly) denies his 9?

Heard an unforgettable, electrifying performance of #BerliozRequiem with @SeattleSymphony &amp; Morlot. A reminder: no matter how magnificent recordings may sound today, they can't touch this sort of live experience.
#RoyMoore proves his dubious character, not with disgusting conduct 38 yrs ago (which may or may not have occurred) but with selfish behavior right now. By refusing to withdraw &amp; allowing a conservative write-in candidate, he puts ego &amp; pride over the cause he claims to cherish.
Tweets, statements from @MooreSenate never deny specifics of charges against #JudgeRoy. Does he even know the 14 yr old allegedly involved? Was he ever alone with her? Did he ever date the 3 other teenagers in the WAPO story? Relevant questions to answer for puzzled voters.
@TheOnion Great idea! He co-starred in THE SOUND OF MUSIC, didn't he?
Economic advisor #GaryCohn used the term "trickle down" to describe GOP tax bill- disastrous branding for a good planl! The term "trickle down" implies that the govt is providing a money stream - a golden shower, so to speak- rather than letting people keep their own money.
Hurrah! #Detroit delivered a crushing blow to identity politics: this recovering, black majority city gave dynamic white mayor #MikeDuggan a landslide re-election victory (72%!), defeating attempts to play the race card.
Yes, #Virginia: voters did see election as a referendum on #Trump. Exit polls show @realDonaldTrump with approval rating of 43% in state. GOP nominee @EdWGillespie got 44%. Coincidence?
The argument that #EdGillespie would have done better in #VA if he had associated himself more closely with @realDonaldTrump makes no sense when @EdWGillespie actually got a higher percentage (45%) than #Trump did in 2016 (44.4%).
In #NJ also, this year's Gov. nominee (#Guadagno) actually did BETTER (43%) than #Trump's feeble performance a year ago (41%). Results in NJ &amp; VA show 2 things: 1) It's tough for #GOP to escape taint of Trump &amp; 2) he's done nothing to expand Republican base since November, '16
Problem in #VirginiaGovernor race wasn't that #Trump "silent majority" didn't show up. GOP nominee #Gillespie got 45%-actually BETTER than the percentage #Trump received (44/4%) 1 yr ago. @realDonaldTrump majority isn't just silent; it's non-existent.
Gotta love justice system of #SaudiArabia: pickpockets may get their hands amputated but political prisoners are housed in the RitzCarlton.

Also disappointed by right's implicit instinct to insist that current gun regulations are absolutely perfect and can't possibly be improved.

Bad news for @realDonaldTrump: 14 more months of @BobCorker in Senate. Bad news for the country: 38 more months of an erratic White House.
What defines presidential "strength"?Self control, ability to focus, build coalitions, unify, inspire.By that standard, how strong is Trump?
Bad news: @POTUS attacks a senior Senator of his own party. Good news: he's not attacking a gold star widow, or his own Secretary of State.

On #DACA, cancel Obama's dubious program,sure; but why not present decision together with replacement legislation, then rally GOP behind it?
Yes, GOP in Congress even less popular than #Trump, but nuking your (necessary) allies is short-sighted and dangerous. Trust Dems instead?
With #DACA cancellation, new #budgetdeal, @POTUS throws Congressional GOP to the wolves, telling Republicans "fight among yourselves"
Great to hear two outstanding young conservatives in conversation..... https://t.co/0L6m3SwpkZ
...but because of politics.Employers who hired Dreamers legally, with valid work permits,will lose employees they value, for no reason.Fair?
Under #DACA,Dreamers passed background checks,got legal status for work, school,etc. Now they may lose that status,not for their behavior...
Instead of uniting to push tax cuts, control spending, GOP will now divide over prospect of mass deportation of Dreamers. Why's that good?
You win in politics by uniting your side,dividing the opposition.Prospect of deporting Dreamers bitterly divides GOP &amp; totally unites Dems.
.#DACA=DEFERRED Action for Childhood Arrivals,not CANCELED action. Decision by @POTUS defers action for 6 mos. MORE so follows original idea
It's true #Obama had no legal right to protect "Dreamers" but #Congress definitely does-and must. #Trump should say he WILL sign the bill.
The #DACA decision gives #Congress great opportunity to break the stupid partisan logjam&amp; protect deserving "Dreamers"--do it the right way!

For @POTUS, all admirers (even Nazis) qualify as "fine people"; all critics (even powerful GOP Senators) are "so dishonest" &amp; "really bad."
For @POTUS,a single standard divides good from evil,"so great" from "total loser". Only question that counts: what someone says about #Trump

Years before #Trump,lib bias hurt media credibility.But with each attack by @POTUS,their hostility gets more obvious&amp; credibility's reduced.
@POTUS .@POTUS understands that insulting media won't earn him better coverage. But he'd rather undermine their credibility than get more balance.

Is the #SolarEclipse the ultimate in fake news? Perhaps NASA staged it on a top-secret movie set in Nevada to build ratings for cable news.

It should be natural, easiest thing in the world, for any president to denounce #KKK, #Nazis. Why is it difficult for Trump?Who can explain?
"The right" can never unite under racist banners, or blame "many sides" for racist violence. @POTUS : speak more clearly for conservatives!
In #Charlottesville, #Nazis &amp; #KKK rallied under slogan "Unite the Right." That's why conservatives must respond: real "right" isn't racist!

.@POTUS is right that prior #KoreanComments weren't "tough enough." Vague threat of "fire&amp;fury" isn't tough or credible; it's unhinged,weak.
The #KoreaCrisis sends an unmistakable message: an unprecedented presidential approach can be refreshing, constructive, OR deadly dangerous.
.#Trump loyalists say that unprecedented @POTUS language on Korea is exactly why millions voted for him:he's different from all predecessors
Why do media seem "more disturbed' by #Trump than by #KimJongUn?Because Krazy Kim, is behaving as expected; @POTUS acting like no prior Prez
"Fury" is defined as "wild or violent anger." Is that a promising basis for effective statecraft? Please, choose another word,Mr. President.

Rejecting #NeverTrump label, lets you to applaud @POTUS when he deserves it, and to react w (rhetorical) "fire &amp; fury" when he deserves that
Since the campaign I've been a "Never Never-Trumper"--can't say (or hope) he'll NEVER succeed with conservative reform,and if he does, great
I despise the term #NeverTrumper - absurd to describe a political point of view based on reactions to the (erratic) personality of one man.
Think about movies: who looks stronger, more formidable - #JohnWayne, #GaryCooper characters or out-of-control DeNiro characters?
What's the point of "speaking softly"?It demonstrates self-control, and self-control conveys true strength-more formidable (&amp;focused) force.
TR urged: "Speak softly, but carry a big stick." US military provides a very big stick, but promising "fire and fury" isn't speaking softly.
If @POTUS succeeds in defusing #KoreanCrisis without death &amp; devastation,he'll soar in popularity,with good chance for successful presidency
Aside from cost in lives,destruction,military conflict in #Korea could crash the world economy, thru devastating damage to SKorea &amp; Japan

Even at the time of his firing as campaign manager (8/2016) all press accounts focused on concerns about @PaulManafort's #Putin connection.
Inescapable question for @POTUS: If there was no evidence-ever-of Russian connections to your campaign, why did you fire @PaulManafort?
New tweet from @POTUS blames (GOP-controlled) Congress - not Putin!-for poor relations with Russia. How does this help him, or GOP, or USA?
Leading Libs (Hillary, Gore) also guilty of imaginary triumphs. HRC landed in Bosnia under enemy fire, Al visited TX floods- never happened!
False claims by @POTUS re' congratulatory calls from presidents of Boy Scouts, Mexico? Yes that's stupid,reckless, but hardly unprecedented.

Final thought: when Schlesinger wrote about #JFK administration he called the book, 1000 DAYS. @Scaramucci's upcoming book "11 DAYS"1
With his resignation, @Scaramucci showed that he was a master of communications: he managed to talk himself out of a job.
The @Scaramucci era is over already? Mooch, we hardly knew ye! If new chief-of-staff #JohnKelly is behind it, that's a very good sign.

Most stunning aspect of @POTUS NYT int'view: he speaks more harshly of his loyal backer #JeffSessions than he does of the dictator of Russia
Beyond his military service, @SenJohnMcCain IS an American hero: for his love of country and admirably old-fashioned sense of duty &amp; honor
Looking at long career of @SenJohnMcCain, it's possible, occasionally, to question his judgment, but never  to question his character.
The three big stories of today --#McCain, #OJ, and @POTUS vs. #Sessions - share a common theme: character counts.
Watch:media will assign great significance to the fact that the 3 GOP Senators who killed "repeal only" were female:Capito,Collins,Murkowski
Pathetic that #CNN treats #Trumpcare collapse as a loss strictly for GOP. How about the impact on millions already damaged by Obamacare?
Re' the emphatic suggestion by @POTUS to "let Obamacare fail": allowing pain and damage to the people is never a smart political strategy.
Message to @POTUS: "Make America Great Again!" was an inspiring, effective slogan. "Let Obamacare Fail!" is not.
At climactic moment of @dunkirkmovie,soaring music surrounding makeshift rescue fleet is borrowed, tastefully, from #EdwardElgar. Perfect!
Just saw the @dunkirkmovie, the latest from #ChristopherNolan, and it's stunning in every way. Opens Fri; sure bet as one of year's best.
With @SenJohnMcCain in the news (he should be well!),not helpful to @POTUS or GOP to play old tape of Trump questioning his war hero status.
Hard to say nasty new @CNN weapon to slam @POTUS is unfair: playing "greatest hits" video of his embarrassing statements during campaign.

But arguments for Trumpism (&amp; Putin alliance)assumed  @HillaryClinton was mortal danger to USA, not just extension of failed lib governance.
Reluctant Trumpers said backing #Trump equated to helping Stalin to beat Nazis. Sure,if Hillary=Hitler,embrace Donald &amp; Vlad-like Uncle Joe!
Sure, it's normal, natural in a presidential campaign to want to defeat your opponent but that's not the same as trying to destroy an enemy.
Worst part of #DonaldJr e-mail chain? It treats #Hillary as the ultimate enemy  &amp; views Russian govt as an appropriate ally.
Menu change? #JimAcosta/CNN says "the #nothingburger now looks like a #SOMETHINGburger &amp; opponents see steak dinner with all the trimmings"
.#Impeachment is a political process,not a legal one.Still VERY unlikely @POTUS removed,but needs better response or damage will be dire.

Attention #SteveBannon: on your idea to raise taxes on "the rich"?! Problem isn't that it takes away money. It's that it takes away freedom.
For #July4: What does a "free press" mean? For press, you SHOULD criticize the govt. For govt (and @POTUS) you SHOULDN'T attack press.
All who honestly support this president MUST decry the self-destructive tweets.To defend them is like urging an alcoholic to keep drinking.

I know @VP Pence can't say anything publicly, but I hope he'll privately counsel @POTUS to stop the self-destructive tweets.Time to refocus!
Who hurts @POTUS most?Trump himself,obviously but runners-up are media toadies who defend every self-inflicted wound as a sign of "strength"
We disagree politically, but find common ground in doodling before TV interviews. Thanks, @GovInslee for the drawing! Not bad for a Democrat https://t.co/Kx4zZiMpbJ

.@GOPChairwoman defends @POTUS saying:@Morning_Joe insulted him 1st so he "pushes back" &amp; "acts like a human." Yup, like a 4 yr old human.
Message to Tweeter-in-Chief: please note that @Morning_Joe isn't the most immediate or dangerous threat to the nation, or to your presidency

In MidEast, @POTUS shows that role of Prez is different from role as candidate. Rehashing campaign rhetoric is a lame media obsession.

Does #ComeyMemo amount to "obstruction of justice"? Maybe not, but it certainly does mean obstruction of the constructive GOP agenda.
.@POTUS says: "No politician in history has been treated worse &amp; more unfairly." Really?! Self-pity is NOT an effective defense strategy.
Is #ComeyMemo story perhaps a response to #Trump taunting about possible WH tapes? Comey saying: no, I don't have tapes, but I've got memos!
If reports on #ComeyMemo ARE "fake" or inaccurate, @POTUS must say so - and soon. Certainly before his departure for important foreign tour.
Those who doubt current #crisis is real &amp; serious - check out the market! #DJIA down nearly 250? Chaos is terrible for #Trump, GOP- &amp; USA.
If #Comey denies the memo story, it's deeply damaging for the @nytimes. If he confirms it, it will be be deeply damaging for this presidency
It's not just the #Trump presidency on the line; it's the @nytimes as well. It's all up to #Comey, the sudden star of an unfolding melodrama
Like it or not #Comey is suddenly the 2nd most powerful man in the country. If he does confirm NYT memo story, then @POTUS faces dire threat

If @POTUS wants quick confirmation for new FBI Director, #MerrickGarland is perfect. How could Dems oppose him? Unimpeachable integrity.
Judge #MerrickGarland really would be smart choice for FBI chief. Former fed'l prosecutor in big anti-terror &amp; political corruption cases.
Deeply-compromised #GenMichaelFlynn was allowed to resign on 2/13/17; he wasn't fired. Why didn't #Trump extend the same courtesy to #Comey?
Today @RandPaul, only Senator to vote AGAINST confirming #Comey for FBI, joins us on the radio.Maybe he can explain timing of #ComeyFiring.
When #Comey was confirmed as FBI Director in 2013, the Senate vote was 93-1. Lone dissenter: @RandPaul.
If @POTUS asks @MikePenceVP to go out there to defend #ComeyFiring, please, Mr. Vice President: Just Say No! Remain unsullied on this one.
More than any other story, this one proves the breathtaking incompetence, ignorance &amp; stupidity of the worst White House staff in history https://t.co/RrUkfALrNj
I can respect the argument that #Comey deserved firing, (though I disagree),but can only gasp at any claim #Trump handled the firing well.
... #FBI will remain directionless for foreseeable future as #Trump and US Senate feud and fret over new director during confirmation fight
..but this firing isn't punishment, it's redemption: re-making Comey as a martyred hero, and no new direction for #FBI either, because...
Only 2 plausible reasons to #FireComey: 1) to punish him &amp; 2) to steer FBI in a new direction......

For new FBI director, 1st question in confirmation hearings: "Can you help us understand why Pres.Trump needed to fire #Comey so abruptly?"
Names mentioned as #Comey successor: @ChrisChristie, #SheriffClarke, #RudyGiuliani-- but any Trump-loyalist will face a tough confirmation
3) Why not line-up successor ahead of time, and present new #FBI Director at same time you thank #Comey? Then it's less insulting,impulsive.
2) Why not approach #Comey &amp; press him to resign,keep his dignity?Do Rose Garden ceremony w his anointed successor, thanks for service, etc.
3 questions on #ComeyFiring: 1) Why now? If @POTUS did it in 1st wk in office-or after Russia probe finished - no biggie.What's the urgency?

If @POTUS has any evidence that this is true, why has his staff failed to share that evidence in the 2 full days since he made his charge? https://t.co/8KBQ9HopqQ
.@hughhewitt Absolutely right, Hugh. @JeffSessions, an honorable man, here makes the honorable choice.
Thanks, Tim! The greatest blessing for any author is appreciative readers - I'm  grateful.  @TnTmcNeil https://t.co/bKiGSdD4Od
Note to @jeffsessions , @clairecmc, @CNN: I declare,unambiguously, I have NEVER met with the Russian Ambassador and I refuse to recuse.
Looking ahead 9 yrs to 250th anniversary of independence gave a good frame to #TrumpSpeech.Smart to invoke hopeful spirit of 1876 Centennial
The feeble #DemResponse  by @SteveBeshear was aimed at #TweetTrump, not the more unifying #TeleprompterTrump who showed up tonight. Sad!
I had prayed that @POTUS would deliver a speech emphasizing aspiration over anger, cooperation over confrontation.He did it -&amp; did it well.
The #TrumpSpeech was a YUUGE step in the right direction- showing a Prez approaching the opposition ready to deal, not ready to kill. Bravo.
What's the deal with #Pelosi and other Dem gals all dressed in pure white? Are they so upset by #Trump they're taking orders as nuns?
.@POTUS is making great use of the visitors in the gallery - sounding genuinely concerned &amp; compassionate when he tells their stories.
Yes, an obvious contrast between #TeleprompterTrump and #TwitterTrump. Wouldn't it help GOP (and USA) if the latter took a long break?
A shame that Dems refused to applaud for #Trump's call for BI-PARTISAN immigration reform. He listed 3 core principles- all reasonable.
Yay! @realDonaldTrump mentioned his "great,great wall" but(thank God) said nothing about "getting Mexico to pay for it." Welcome to reality!
.@JustinTrudeau, of all people, gets the honor of the first friendly shout-out in the #TrumpSpeech. Who would have predicted it?
Is blue tie (instead of red) a magic talisman for @realDonaldTrump, helping him cool down his rhetoric and its delivery? So far, promising.
.@TomlinMedia @benshapiro "Less is more" generally a great rule of speechifying, but @POTUS has ability to hold attention longer than most
@TomlinMedia @benshapiro  So @POTUS is splitting the difference between SenEdwardEverett and Lincoln at Gettysburg: he'll speak 1 hr, not 2.

Rewatching #Oscars meltdown:most striking thing is that even astrain-wreck unfolds, losers deliver victory speeches, no one takes charge.
After tonight, maybe we should go back and check whether #JackPalance really announced the right name (@marisatomei?) for the '93 #Oscars.
the whole world is watching...and embarrassed ....by the #OscarsSnafu https://t.co/hKft31L32I
Deep symbolism in #Oscars show? maybe best opening, ever (Justin T) &amp; certainly most embarrassing conclusion, ever. Not funny, painful.
Yes, 3 #Oscars winners from @LaLaLand are absurdly, indecently young, but their likeable,even humble,thank you speeches nearly madeup for it
2 important #Oscars (editing and sound mixing) for @HacksawRidge at least demonstrate #MelGibson is back (deservedly) in industry esteem
What if some #Oscars presenter made an unscripted DEFENSE of #Trump or his agenda? Can you imagine the boos? Or the riot likely to follow?
If you were playing an #Oscars drinking game where you took a shot every time they slammed #Trump,you would probably have passed out by now.

At press conference, @POTUS wanted to show he was firmly in control. But he showed the opposite- not in control of events, or of himself.
Last word on @POTUS press conference: wild, unhinged--and utterly compelling.He shows transparent humanity- emotional,vulnerable, alarming.
Yes, @POTUS just said, regarding travel ban: "The roll-out was perfect." Why even say that?To prove that his team is "finely tuned machine."
Too bad @POTUS allowed press conference to shift focus from outstanding choice of new Labor Secretary.#AlexanderAcosta is ideal for the job
@jpodhoretz @Jamie_Weinstein Hey, jpod: isn't SCHINDLER'S LIST Milo's favorite comedy?
Please, Mr. President: it's time to stop attacking @HillaryClinton. You won. She lost. Time to get over it. Don't be a sore winner!
Any contradiction when @POTUS says "I'm not ranting &amp; raving" while insisting "my administration is working like a fine-tuned machine"?
If @POTUS objects that the press is "out of control", who does he think should be exercising control? It's a disturbing question, isn't it?
Yes, @AlexanderAcosta is an outstanding choice for Dept of Labor! But saw was @AndyPuzder--too bad he fell victim to toxic politics.
@POTUS just said the press is "out of control." Does he really believe they should be "under control"? Hope not.

Israeli Ambassador #RonDermer gets it right:Palestinians don't believe in negotiation based on give-and-take. They insist on take-and-take.

Efforts to encourage# "FaithlessElectors" regarding #Trump's victory are un-American. No one who reveres the #Constitution can endorse them.
If #GOP allows Dems to make Russian interference into a partisan issue, it's an awful mistake.Issue is one of patriotism, not partisanship.
Evidence of Russian hacking in no way invalidates #Trump's election, or suggests #Trump's direct involvement. Why dismiss that evidence?

So @realDonaldTrump stuns the world by keeping a campaign promise: challenging the voting results, alleging fraud. Never mind that he won!
No question: any and all #recounts would be more likely to expose #VoterFraud (if it occurred) than to conceal such fraud.Simple logic,no?
If @realDonaldTrump actually believes massive voter fraud occurred on 11/8, wouldn't he enthusiastically welcome #recounts?
The sudden tweet-storm about "millions" of illegal votes serves no purpose at all and simply serves to change the subject-not in a good way.
.@realDonaldTrump promised to entrust his business empire to his kids after inauguration.Why not entrust his Twitter Empire to same kids?

Seeing it another way: if #Democrats see they have a problem with working class whites,how does picking #Ellison,slamming #Bannon help them?
#Dems are nuts to focus fury on #SteveBannon, promote #KeithEllison at DNC. Those swayed by charges of "racism&amp; hate" are already with Dems.

With so few House,Senate seats switching parties,2016 was most PRO-establishment election since '88;only 1 sitting gov (in NC) MAY lose seat
Was 2016 really an "anti-establishment tidal wave"? If so, why did only 2 Senators lose their seats, only 12 House seats change parties?
Finally,if @realDonaldTrump puts @SenTedCruz on Supreme Court he removes from politics a potential challenger for GOP leadership,nom.in 2020
Thinking ahead: if @SenTedCruz goes to SCOTUS, could #RickPerry replace him in Senate? Why not? He could easily defend the seat in 2018.
@SenTedCruz argued many cases before SCOTUS, and is strong originalist in @Scalia mold. He'd be replaced in Senate by an appt from GOP Gov.
Yes,@SenTedCruz would be confirmable for SCOTUS.Senatorial courtesy helps,&amp;  many of his colleagues,both R &amp; D,glad to get him out of Senate
@SenTedCruz is right guy for SCOTUS: young (45);1st Hispanic ever; brilliant legal scholar, former Solicitor General of TX. Cofirmable?....
Most significant appointment by @realDonaldTrump? SCOTUS, of course, and to replace #Scalia he should choose @SenTedCruz. Don't laugh....
Fine speeches by @HillaryClinton, @POTUS follow classy example of @realDonaldTrump,Yay! Despite fears, stock market up!America still works.
It's a blessing that the victory speech by Donald Trump was gracious, dignified, re-assuring. All patriots must wish him success now.
1more big winner tonight:@AlecBaldwin, who should have steady work on @SNL for the next 4 yrs. His #PresidentTrump performance is YUUGE!
Another exit poll surprise #Trump, supposed to have problems with white college grads, actually won that group 49-45%-like prior GOPers.
Hindsight:did #Trump need to hit "crooked Hillary" so hard? Obama beat her in '08 without it. Now &amp; then,people wanted change,something new.
Also,contrary to all expectations of #NeverTrump, more Dems deserted #HRC for #Trump (9%),than % of GOPers who deserted Trump for HRC(7%).
Secret of #Trump victory? He seems to have won a bigger % of men than #HRC did of women. Yes, there was a gender gap -that helped him.
Pence,Trump looked stunned &amp;-amazingly -humbled-in claiming victory.Hope @HillaryClinton's concession speech (tomorrow?)shows similar class.
It's a blessing that the victory speech by @realDonaldTrump was gracious, dignified, re-assuring. All patriots must wish him success now.

.... but character SHOULD trump ideology, shouldn't it? Political perspective doesn't define goodness, or evil, in the lives of most people.
The standard for "goodness" for Dems: supporting lib ideas. For GOP, the standard has become supporting conservative ideas....
The problem is that we've replaced any honest character tests with tribal party loyalty-- Dems=Good; GOP=evil, and vice verse.
:#Trump loyalists say #HRC is unacceptable on character grounds.If she were GOP nominee,wouldn't you back her? Wouldn't Dems back #Trump?..
Instead of chanting #"Lock Her Up" (or "Lock HIM Up") wouldn't it be better for rally crowds at this point to chant, "Lift Us Up."?
In #WorldSeries both teams deserved to be there,beat playoff competitors fair&amp; square;in POTUS race,hard to explain why/how the nominees won
Also, in #WorldSeries , #Cubs &amp; #Indians led by great YOUNG players with great futures; in POTUS race, 2 aging boomers facing "last Hurrahs"
#WorldSeries had 2 great teams, where both deserved to win; in #Trump-Clinton race, 2 damaged candidates both of whom deserves to lose.
Why did most Americans feel so good about the recent #WorldSeries while we feel so lousy about the upcoming #PresidentialElection?
Since when does handing someone vast power improve his character? Doesn't power corrupt? And how often do we change personalities at age 70?
Of all arguments for #Trump,the strangest is that once he's elected, his character will improve; he'll become mature, self-disciplined, etc.

If @HillaryClinton were smart, she'd DEMAND that #FBI review the new e-mails IMMEDIATELY. But she's not smart-in anything regarding e-mails
@realDonaldTrump's play on new #FBI probe? Get out of the way of the story. Let #Hillary melt down in a spotlight she can occupy all alone.
If system's really rigged, why didn't the #FBI get the memo? Opening new probe 11 days before vote does maximum damage to #Hillary campaign

@GovPenceIN, GOP VP nominee,on the radio show today. Will ask: why does he think the ticket has been rising so dramatically in the polls?
1 reason @realDonaldTrump is surging in polls: predictable collapse of Libertarian #GaryJohnson, and many of his backers going for GOP.
Bad news for @HillaryClinton,even if true that 54% say "things are going well in US": many of those satisfied citizens won't bother to vote.
New #CNN poll says "54% think things are going well in the US." If that's true, why is @realDonaldTrump surging in some polls?

My reaction to the #debate for @USATODAY, and in defense of #NeverTrumpers  https://t.co/45x7ZqGtQf
When, near the end of a tough #debate , you snarl of your opponent "she's a nasty woman!", is that a sign you think you've won?
#CNN sees #Trump's big problem was refusal to accept results of the election if he loses.But many more problems-including general demeanor.
#ChrisWallace asks strong question about Social Security running out of money. #Trump gives rambling answer about repealing Obamacare. Sad!
#Trump: "I disagreed with Reagan very strongly on trade...Nobody ever gets it right. I'm gonna get it right."  If you believe in magic..
What in does #Trump mean when he says "Hillary shouldn't have been allowed to run"? Who would have prevented it?She has a birth certificate.
Isn't it significant @realDonaldTrump in this final #debate admits he pays no federal income taxes.At this point, why not release returns?
#Trump on not paying income tax: "We're entitled..so we did it." Another #debate  line that will turn up in ads.
At #debate :"No one respects women more than me. No one!" Dems will probably use that line in ads w tearful collection of women who disagree
The candidate enjoying process more comes across as winning any #debate. In first 40 minutes, #Clinton seems more comfortable, confident.
@HillaryClinton calls #Trump Putin's "puppet." His witty response: "You're the puppet! No, you're the puppet!" (repeated for emphasis)
Why is @realDonaldTrump giving #Obama credit for deporting "millions and millions" of illegal immigrants. Shouldn't he applaud such action?
Ouch! @HillaryClinton says @realDonaldTrump "choked" with Prez of Mexico, and employed undocumented to build Trump Tower.
@HillaryClinton seems younger, more vibrant in this debate than previous 2. Why? Because she's speaking more quickly, more forcefully.
"We have some bad hombres here and we're gonna get 'em out!" Inspiring words from @realDonaldTrump at #debatenight
#Trump begins #debate saying 2nd Amendment is under "trauma" right now. Fortunately,gun-grabbers haven't won many recent battles,have they?
Score one for #ChrisWallace right off the bat on #debatenight -- he pronounced Nevada correctly: Neh-vadd-a not Ne-Vah-da. Way to go!
Closing time - at #debatenight!Trump gets 1 last chance to make a pitch for the lovely lady, Ms. Liberty,to leave the club in his company.
How does America-at-large respond to angry, ceaseless chants of "lock her up"? Is this a hopeful, healing movement you yearn to join?
Why did #Trump bring #MalikObama to the #debate? Why position himself against Obama, who's popular now, rather than #Hillary, who isn't?
Love this! If @Evan_McMullin does much better than expected it can send a powerful message on the future of the GOP. https://t.co/epT75UC8wO
1st question in debate on Wed: "Do you believe the election is rigged?If so, how? And will you accept-or challenge-the results if you lose?"
What does #Trump gain, by repeatedly saying the election is "rigged"? Will that make his true-believers more likely to turn out, or less?
tough to disagree...... https://t.co/IrTuZAMQDV

Speaking of 3rd symphonies: shouldn't @realDonaldTrump appropriate the #Eroica as a personal tribute?
Yeah, tops for Mendelssohn, but except for big hymn in last mvmnt the music is pleasing, but hardly weighty.The Nielsen really is astounding https://t.co/OfUJyX90iU
Just listened 4 times to amazing #Nielsen3rd 1st mvmnt:#Bernstein '65 recording,stunning,explosive;1 of great performances of any music,ever
What's the greatest 3rd Symphony? #Beethoven, sure, but runner-up:#CarlNielsen. "Sinfonia Espaniva": electrifying, life-affirming, glorious.

Heraclitus says: "Character is destiny." Not ideology;not TV skill; not wealth - character. #Trump's destiny? To prove the point.
If you argue "character doesn't matter in politics", should we be less selective in choosing POTUS than the NBC brass that fired Billy Bush?
.....But if you've been wavering at all, don't the latest charges-and his handling of them- indicate a candidate of low character?
If you've been strongly pro-@realDonaldTrump all along, then the latest allegations won't sway you-and shouldn't. But .......

Key question:does #Trump believe #Hillary cares about US?He says today: 'The Clintons are criminals.Remember that." And post-election unity?
"To the Af-Am community I say, 'What the hell do you have to lose?I will fix it.I will make it good." And the lame shall walk, the blind see
@realDonaldTrump just described his campaign as "a journey to heaven. Is he running for President, or for Deity? "I alone can fix(heal)"
#Trump just tried to discredit assault accusations by #PeopleMagazine reporter by citing her looks, saying "look at her - I don't think so!"
Yes,#Trump has disqualified himself,but NOT because of attacks on women; but because of attacks on #PaulRyan,rest of GOP. How is this sane?
This #Trump's core problem:wildly attacking targets (Ryan,Rafael Cruz,Khans, Miss Universe,McCain,Judge Curiel)who should not be his enemies https://t.co/9Lnl0dv2ko

The Best Presidents Ever--in movies. Check out my list for the Intercollegiate Review:	https://t.co/WeoidewxYq
Why is #Trump determined to throw #Hillary into jail if he defeats her? He always asks himself "WWVD?" (What would Vladimir do)
3 bases for questioning idea of  #Trump as POTUS: 1) his competence 2)sanity 3)basic decency. Did #debate eliminate any of these doubts?
Yeah, but "the Hispanics" love him! Remember the Taco Bowl on Cinco de Mayo. https://t.co/4YcgdHbEcl
Ask #Trump:he says his #AccessHollywood video doesn't reflect who he really is.Does that mean it's the only time he made similar comments?
OK, mysterious 15%- what is it about the #AccessHollywood video that made you like #Trump more? Their wit?Substance? Insight? Sensitivity?
CNN poll says 16% f #debate watchers liked #Trump MORE after hearing his comments on #AccessHollywood video.*#%!!! Who are these people?
Poll (CNN/ORC) showed 63% said #Trump did better than expected,only 39% said same about #Clinton. The #debate advantage of low expectations!
CNN/ORC POLL shows @HillaryClinton won #debate 57-34% - solid margin, but less than last time. That sounds about right to me.
If @GovPenceIN accepts #Trump's rebuke on foreign policy in a docile or (worse) servile way, he'll have no future after November's debacle
Does @realDonaldTrump really want to make US a banana republic? Isn't that what it means to promise to jail the candidate you defeat?
....on my husband are a desperate &amp; shameful attempt to deflect attention from your own collapsing campaign."
#HRC could have said: "My husband served as a successful 2 term Pres of US. He left office at peak popularity, 16 yrs ago. Your attacks...
@realDonaldTrump promised to jail @HillaryClinton if he's elected. Would someone PLEASE ask him what the specific charges would be?
In the human drama, soap opera aspect of #debate (what everyone tuned in to see), wasn't @HillaryClinton more sympathetic than #Trump?
Could it be that @HillaryClinton failed to defend Bill in #debate because they plan to have Bill rise to his own defense, go after Trump?
Probably correct, alas. https://t.co/l7ew4Igje7
Early in #debate@HillaryClinton should have defended her husband- passionately.He remains highly popular;ould have made her more relatable.
An absolutely great point; and if he could have recalled any of the names, could he have pronounced it correctly this time? https://t.co/Jb46AcFIZ8
@HillaryClinton uses an awkward phrase, repeatedly: "If I am so fortunate enough to be your President." It's annoying; she should drop it.
"She has tremendous hatred in her heart" ?--This from @realDonaldTrump, the well-known apostle of love and brotherhood?
@realDonaldTrump's big advantage in #debate He speaks far more rapidly than @HillaryClinton, getting in far more words even with same time.
"I will give strength to our people, I will give economics..." Is #Trump running for president, or for God?
If plurality of Americans embrace idea of this sniffling, ignorant phony as our president,then the country's in worse shape than we thought
In the @debate, #Trump has amplified both the whining against  the "unfair"  moderators, and, appropriately, the sniveling.
Here's an idea: @realDonaldTrump should draw attention from his current problems by attacking #MissUniverse again at 3 AM this morning
.....deserting a sinking ship......still, timely &amp; honorable https://t.co/NQvfculX2d
Proud of the #GOP that is finally moving to cleanse itself from the stain of @realDonaldTrump and #Trumpism. About time! #CharacterCounts
Since I never supported #Trump in any way, I'm proud to be one nationally syndicated radio host who WON"T need to reconsider or apologize.
Big problem in @realDonaldTrump (2005) admitting he tries to score with any hot woman, isn't lust itself; it's that he's so proud of it.
Hurricane Sandy blew away Romney in '12; will #Matthew sway election of '16? Do disasters help Dems by emphasizing importance of goverment?
In facing @HurricaneMatthew, strong response by GOP govs (Scott,Deal, Haley) could end up helping GOP cause. Prayers for victims of storm!

How @GovPenceIN won the #vpdebate last night -- my Wednesday morning commentary  https://t.co/dQn3VlRY0j
Sympathetic GOPers saying @realDonaldTrump should alter approach,follow Pence example in Sun. debate. How will his titanic ego respond?
General rule on televised debates:candidate who looks more relaxed,enjoying the process, wins.This helped JFK,Reagan,Bill Clinton-and Pence.
The "temperament issue" which obviously works against @realDonaldTrump works very well FOR @GovPenceIN.Pence deliberately channeling Reagan?
@GovPenceIN won on likeability,easily,but @timkaine did better job in defending his running mate,attacking opposition.Still,net gain for GOP
Bloated,loopy @realDonaldTrump criticizing #Machado for her weight gain parallels his criticism of @HillaryClinton for her temperament.
In #VPDebate, @mike_pence will be asked:do you support #Trump's attacks on #MissUniverse as appropriate?What is he supposed to say?
My friend Mark makes big point:worst danger for POTUS isn't lack of integrity (though that's bad enough),it's lack of impulse control.
@realDonaldTrump was RIGHT-he did have a problem with his microphone at the @Debate. Problem: the mic was on, so you could hear his words.
Think how much better things would be for @realDonaldTrump if he had tweeted NOTHING in the last 24 hrs.Why not close the account?
Problem for poor @GovPenceIN: in upcoming VP debate,his main challenge will be defending @realDonaldTrump's temperament&amp;character.Tough job!
Who can defend #Trump's wee-hours attacks on #AliciaMachado? Why should we expect him to become suddenly sane&amp;decent the day after election?
@realDonaldTrump: displaying the rhetorical strength to keep us safe from our most dangerous enemies--like that diabolical #MissUniverse!

Isn't @realDonaldTrump's obsessive,angry, lying rant about always opposing the Iraq proof he doesn't have "best temperament" for POTUS?
"We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and we have to do it fast." What the hell does that mean? Is that a policy?
Why does @realDonaldTrump continue to defend the lie that he always opposed the Iraq War?Can't Rudy, Chris or Kelly tell him it's pointless.
On question about cybersecurity, @HillaryClinton should have offered another pre-emptive defense on her e-mail scandal -Trump will slam her
@realDonaldTrump sniffling again,with sucking noises (really),in midst of talk on birtherism, race,lawsuits against him for discrimination
@realDonaldTrump shockingly unready for questions on birtherism.No explanation for maintaining it long after birth certificate prodcued.
"Implicit bias" is a problem for everyone in our country, @HillaryClinton says.A bad move with a schoolmarmish,guilt-inducing tone.
@realDonaldTrump has now used the term "law and order" more than 10 times. He does know the value of endless repetition in advertising
@realDonaldTrump arguing with @LesterHoltNBC about stop-and-frisk, and Holt is allowing him to win. Not a great moment for the moderator.
@HillaryClinton: "The gun epidemic is leading cause of death among African-American men." What, guns are like germs?Medical solution needed?
@HIllary:"...several years he didn't pay anything in income tax." He intergjects: "that makes me smart." Maybe, but makes our system stupid.
@realDonaldTrump is denying that he ever said climate change is a hoax? Well, @LesterHoltNBC should ask:does he believe it's real, or not?
@realDonaldTrump is sniffling,licking his lips. Allergies?Talking of "stopping" companies from building plants abroad, but not saying how.
Ouch! @Hillary says that "Donald" believes "the more we help wealthy people the better off we'll be." Denounces "Trumped up trickle down."
@HillaryClinton Clinton took less than 30 seconds to mention her granddaughter - but then today's her birthday.Both candidates look nervous.
@VanJones68 says re Trump:"You can lose your job in a trade war started by this man....lose your LIFE in a hot war started by this man."
@LesterHoltNBC welcomes the audience and sez  "...and I hope you enjoy the debate." Never thought that enjoyment was the point.
Okay, so Big Dawg (@billclinton) not backstage -- front and center, even shook hands with @MELANIATRUMP (better than hugs&amp;kisses, obviously)
#debate commission officials explaining everything is reminiscent of Academy Officers making obligatory appearance at the Oscars.
Last advice from @billclinton to @HillaryClinton before show-time? "Win this one for the gipper?"(probably not). "Kick his a--"? (maybe)
Reportedly @billclinton will watch debate back stage, not from audience-will give #HRC last words of encouragement before she goes on stage.
Recognizing Sheldon &amp; Miriam Adelson sitting near the front row at #debate, presumably as guests of @realDonaldTrump. They look confident.
Debate audience has been ordered to make no noise at all in reacting to the candidates. Anyone believe they'll follow those instructions?
@GovPenceIN: outstanding on CNN pre-debate interview-likeable, earnest, credible. As often noted,if he were the nominee it wouldn't be close

Tough #debate question for both candidates:Regarding recent police shootings, has Obama handled them well?How would you respond differently?
With this debate so popular, we need more: FIRST SPOUSE DEBATE: @billclinton Vs. @MELANIATRUMP. Don't you think he'd go for it?
Potential Undercard, for "World Debate Federation": MARK CUBAN vs. GENNIFER FLOWERS! Why not?
In debate @HillaryClinton could ask:Should rich people like Donald pay even less in taxes than they do now? And how much does he pay,anyway?
Best debate line for @realDonaldTrump: Ask yourself: do you want more US troops in harm's way- or fewer? More immigrants, or fewer?
? for @realDonaldTrump: If you didn't admire @HillaryClinton, why did you contribute to her campaigns? What did she do for you in return?
Question for #HRC: If you didn't feel close to @realDonaldTrump, or admire him, why did you attend his wedding? Did he pay you to come?
Finally!On debate eve,@realDonaldTrump raises key issue for decision '16: relationship of #BillClinton &amp; #GenniferFlowers 25 yrs ago. Sad!
Debate question for HRC:most of your big, past projects failed: Hilllarycare,Russia reset,Arab Spring.List the past efforts that triumphed.
Debate question for DJT: You say wall WILL be built. If Mexico doesn't pay for it,will you still build it?If Congress doesn't fund it, how?
@tedcruz problem:not dismissing insults to wife,dad,but ignoring key conviction of #NeverTrump:on character AND issues,DJT is unacceptable.
Question for @tedcruz: what changed in @realDonaldTrump's candidacy between the convention and now that made him a more plausible president?
@MLB player #Clevenger suspended for stupid, racially offensive tweets, then why honor #Kaepernick, despite socks showing cops as pigs?
This will decide debate: if overall theme is change vs. more of same, #Trump wins. If theme is unity vs more division, HRC wins.
Debate question that helps @HillaryClinton: "With America painfully divided by race, why are you the one to bring us together?"
Debate question that helps @realDonaldTrump:"Does America need a big change, or more of the same?" HRC can't answer comfortably.
Debate question @realDonaldTrump should be asked: "Did you ever REALLY believe #Obama was born in Kenya? If so, what changed?"
Debate question @HillaryClinton won't be asked: "Why did you go to #Trump's wedding? Do you now regret that you did?"

If this campaign comes down to a fierce fight between "The Deplorables" vs. "The Deportables" then I'm afraid we all lose.
Prior candidates with secret health issues-FDR '44,JFK '60- were gifted politicos who made it easy to overlook infirmities. But Hillary?
Hillary hurts herself by slurring Trump supporters-no matter how "deplorable" a few might be. Attack Trump- isn't he deplorable enough?
@realDonaldTrump could win FL,OH,NC,IA,GA &amp; still LOSE,if he loses in PA,VA,MI,WI,CO &amp; the other states that look solid for @HillaryClinton.
If weather holds t'mow &amp; we're up early enough, headed to Mt. Rainier - choice of 5 great trails. Still feels like glorious summer.
Re #BasketOfDeplorables: Main impulse to support #Trump is to defy political correctness so @HillaryClinton only helps him by invoking it.
Right response for @realDonaldTrump to #BasketOfDeplorables: show a Basket Of Adorables featuring all the great folks who do support you.
What's a leppo? Don't you remember @GovGaryJohnson? Jesus healed a bunch of them in the New Testament.

What, Jay,you don't see Trump's brilliance in praising Putin&amp; disclosing what he learned in his secret CIA briefing? https://t.co/IFcTDBrIg5
Poor @GovGaryJohnson! He's pilloried just because he doesn't know that "a leppo" is an endangered, leopard-like species in the Italian Alps

Also appalled at their dishonesty and incoherence. Somehow, they made Matt Lauer look like an intellectual titan. https://t.co/t202DP3Duh
Will @realDonaldTrump stand by his claim that Putin is a stronger, better leader than Obama--preferring the Russian Prez to the American?
A prophet without honor in his home state. https://t.co/61blFlSkEW
@NickKristof Even more appalling: lying (or hallucinating) about CIA staff in his top secret briefing criticizing Obama and Clinton!
@stuartpstevens You're exactly right. Or if Obama has claimed that CIA briefers had expressed disagreement to him about the sitting POTUS.
@marklarsonradio Okay, Mark, which one is Kenny Loggins?
If Trump's lying (or hallucinating) about his top-secret intelligence briefing, he must be held to account. How could he be president?
It Trump's telling the truth that CIA briefers told him Obama disregarded their advicethose briefers ought to be fired. If Trump's lying...

#LoganAct (1799) made it illegal for private citizens to negotiate w foreign leaders, undermining US govt. Is #Trump's Mexico trip exempt?
@realDonaldTrump says he'll use state/local cops,not "deportation force," to round up illegals. What if some locals refuse to cooperate?
@realDonaldTrump used "U Can't Always Get What U want" after immigration speech&amp; acceptance speech.Comfort for those wanting better nominee?
Will @realDonaldTrump benefit from his Mexico meeting? Probably, but for me It's disturbing to imagine him actually functioning as POTUS

@realDonaldTrump backer Darwin Dawson describes the nominee as "a raw piece of ore that needs to be molded into something." What, exactly?

The most puzzling question regarding #RNC response to @SenTedCruz: why would anyone choose to boo the idea of "voting your conscience"?
In his acceptance, @realDonaldTrump should stress The Art of the Deal. Deals are  agreements.He seeks agreement among Americans &amp;all nations
More Joe Kennedy/@realDonaldTrump connections:both relying on the slogan "America First" &amp; linked to glamorous women.Gloria Swanson/Melania)
The Trumps &amp; the Kennedys? Is the Donald like Papa Joe,too nasty &amp; bigoted to win POTUS, but the pampered kids are all credible candidates?
In historic terms, why is it a good idea to blow up NATO - or the GOP (by reading out @SenTedCruz &amp; his enthusiastic followers)?
@SenTedCruz message: work for ALL candidates who you think defend conservative principles, Why is that unacceptable?
Is it possible for voters to strongly support GOP&amp; its future without boarding the #TrumpTrain? Portman, Ayotte, Toomey, etc better hope so.
@SenTedCruz handled himself with dignity &amp; courage last night-supporting conservative principle &amp; GOP. Those who booed him - not so much.
Sorry, BenCarson,but your tortured connection between Hillary, Alinsky &amp; Lucifer is probably a bit much for an already weary crowd to follow

1,237 delegates comprise a majority-in Trump-speak,"some artificial number,randomly set by somebody". Unique sense of how conventions work.

@realDonaldTrump returns to his comfort zone: "Let's make a deal." Could "deal" be the single most frequently used word in this debate?
Of 49 trial heats since May between Hillary and Trump, she won 45, they tied 2 &amp; he won 2. Facts are stubborn things https://t.co/6JBmILDxWf
@realDonaldTrump just claimed the requirement for nominee to get a majority of delegates is "some arbitrary number". Majority is arbitrary?
When they come back from the break @MarcoRubio or @SenTedCruz should go after Trump for lauding Putin above Merkel. What a boob!
@realDonaldTrump praises Putin,condemns Merkel?!!! Really? Under her, "Germany is a disaster"?!!  Please, stop the madness-or visit Berlin
If @SenTedCruz managed to speak more quickly,he'd lose that off-putting, melodramatic, televangelist sing-song that undermines his content
@MarcoRubio superb on climate change. Great point that you can't pass a law to change the climate-and damage Americans in the process.
I wish this part of the debate, exposing @realDonalTrump's fatuity on foreign policy, had come at the beginning when everyone was watching.
You go, @SenTedCruz! Highlight the contrast between serious candidates and the puffy buffoon who "has many friends, and many properties."
For @realDonaldTrump is this a presidential debate, or an audition for a job as host for new TV version of "Let's Make a Deal"?

I'm no fan of @SenTedCruz but the Trump charge that he favored "amnesty" is disgusting, irresponsible and dumber than dirt.
Good for @SenTedCruz to go after the vacuous and abominable @realDonaldTrump, who courageously congratulates himself on civility.
The strenuous effort to look presidential,without showmanship &amp;insults, may expose the innate stupidity of @realDonaldTrump more than ever
Where would @realDonaldTrump be without the cozy dodge of "waste, fraud and abuse." Making @MarcoRubio's candor look good by comparison.

@JohnKasich! Aargh! He just said he supports the big govt bullies in forcing florists &amp; bakers to provide services to gay weddings.
Okay, Trump did just defend Planned Parenthood. Will that help him in GOP primaries? Are you kidding?
@SenTedCruz is SLAUGHTERING Trump on the issue of religious liberty &amp; SCOTUS. Home-field advantage for the Texas home boy? Good going
It's obvious it hurts whole GOP that they've now spent nearly an hour on immigration.Even in NV, only 20% listed immigration as issue #1.
Hey, @JohnKasich: wrong Jack K! Jack Kennedy (JFK) talked about a rising tide lifting all boats before Jack Kemp.
Another strong answer by @SenTedCruz on his identity as Hispanic AND conservative.This debate performance should assure victory in TX.
Ready to Rumble! How about a @realDonaldTrump vs. Vicente Fox debate--on who will pay for the effing wall.
Anyone notice: the "also rans"-- @RealBenCarson &amp; @JohnKasich-- were BY FAR the most reasonable and convincing on immigration.
Stylistically, if not substantively, @SenTedCruz is much improved-so far, his strongest debate performance. Strong, almost...presidential
Battle of opening statements:@JohnKasich &amp; @SenTedCruz best, most effective; @realDonaldTrump most pathetic-just hackneyed Trumptalk.
During anthem, only one candidate had his hand over his heart, inside his jacket, Napoleon style. No, not @realDonaldTrump-- Ted Cruz

We know @realDonaldTrump's against illegals, free trade,political correctness.But what's he for? Big govt or smaller?More defense $-or less?
@realDonaldTrump says don't "belittle my victory."' But what, exactly, does that YUUGE victory mean?How would Pres Trump change America?
OK, so @realDonaldTrump won again. But who knows what he would do if he did win it all? He keeps scoring, but there are no goals.
Trump: about winning, nothing more.But winning means nothing if the game has no rules,or referees, or goals. Scoring, sure, but no goals.

How about polling trial heats matching Pope Francis against @realDonaldTrump? Woud Pope win any demographic-even Catholics?
Now @marcorubio and @SenTedCruz  will be asked if they agree with Pope that @realDonaldTrump is "not a Christian."They have to defend Trump.
For me,problem isn't Pope opposing idea of big border wall; it's his proclamation that (non-Catholic) @realDonaldTrump  is "not a Christian
What do we learn about Pope from his unfortunate attack on @realDonaldTrump? This Pontiff may be nice guy, but not infallible.

If #SCOTUS vacancy means a 4-4 deadlock for many months, wouldn't that reduce Court's power? Isn't that healthy-maybe needed?

I just watched the opening of the debate (had to wait till end of Shabbat). It really was an Emperor's New Clothes situation for #Trump

@BenCarson lowers the temperature in the room and, like Kasich, comes across as reasonable and constructive-providing refreshing perspective
Nice going for @JebBush-"Reagan didn't tear people down like Donald Trump. He tore down the Berlin Wall." Quotable, appropriate.
I love @realDonaldTrump calling out Teddy Shutdown as "the biggest liar on this stage." Cruz is getting close to a cringe-inducing meltdown.

Does it make it better, or worse, if President Trump gets Congress to collaborate in punishing a particular company with targeted taxes?
When @MarcoRubio declares "Ted Cruz just tells lies" isn't it obvious that every one of his fellow candidates (aside from Ted) would agree?
@JohnKasich spoke for most viewers who feel disgusted and alarmed at the mud-wrestling aspect to this debate. Good for him!
If Obama appoints an older (65+) moderate conservative to SCOTUS he would be confirmed. How about Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of 4th Circuit?
In NH, GOP &amp;DEM voters sent same message: they want a sharp break, and reject Obamunism.Candidates who offer more-of-the-same--no chance.
Tonight's Lesson: Debates Matter! Trump skipping IA debate ruined him there, while Marco clutching in NH debate ruined him there.
If Kasich &amp; Bush stay in the race-along with Trump, Cruz &amp; Rubio- PROPORTIONAL primaries make anyone's 1st ballot victory even less likely.
For years, conservatives have been saying Democrats are really socialists. Tonight in New Hampshire, they proved it.
After NH, which party looks crazier? 2/3 of GOP voted AGAINST the vulgar billionaire,but only 40% of Dems opposed a cranky, aged socialist!
@realDonaldTrump wants to bring back waterboarding. Good. Would he start with @JebBush?
#ChrisChristie is an effective brawler,but he picks the wrong brawls.Does it help conservative cause to treat@MarcoRubio as Public Enemy #1?

@GovJimGilmore,bless his heart, can claim 12 votes in Iowa; not 12% - 12 actual votes. Can we find and interview these true believers?
Entrance polls:24% of IA Dems say most important quality was that candidate is "honest &amp; trustworthy."They backed Bernie over Hillary 83-10

Cruz over Trump by 6,000 votes, but Trump only 2,000 votes ahead of Rubio. Near tie with Marco shows Trump's weakness as much as Ted's win.
Trump's whole appeal was image as unstoppable winner. With the aura of inevitability badly dented in IA, his lead could melt quickly in NH.
Record-setting 180,000 GOP caucus-goers- many1st-timers? Conventional wisdom said big turnout meant Trump victory.Wrong again!Congrats,Ted!
Credit to TeamRubio: great job of managing expectations! Never claimed they'd win IA,so virtual tie with Trump for 2nd looks like a big win.
@realDonaldTrump says he might "buy a farm" in IA?When you say someone "bought the farm" doesn't it mean he DIED? Is Trump politically dead?
By 4-1,polls showed IA voters cared more about "shares my values" than "tells it like it is." In a nutshell, that's why @Cruz beat Trump..
Humble question: why is #JimGilmore still in the race? Or is this an appropriate question for my wife, the clinical psychologist?
@MarcoRubio is running closer to #Trump, than Donald is to @TedCruz. If @realDonaldTrump finishes 3rd in IA, it could be a fatal blow.
Most GOP voters in IA said their top concern was a candidate who "shares my values." Looks like @TedCruz attack on "NY values" worked well.
Huckabee now suspending his campaign? Does Cruz benefit? Or will speculation prove accurate that Huckabee will endorse @realDonaldTrump?
Message from IA voters:@realDonaldTrump made mistake to skip last debate.Had he participated,he wouldn't be under-performing his polling.
1 thing for GOP to celebrate:strong showing by Bernie in IA.Even if Hillary wins nomination, Sanders campaign has exposed her vulnerability.
New poll shows Trump winning Iowa w 28% -means less than 1/3 of delegates. Winning like that in other states: no majority, open convention.
As long as 2 or more rivals stay in the race,Trump could win most primaries but with less than 40%: meaning no 1st ballot majority.
Why wouldn't Trump win in Iowa mean victory at the convention? Ddelegates awarded proportionally-but you need 50%+1 for 1st ballot win.
If @realDonaldTrump wins Iowa comfortably, doesn't mean he automatically will win nomination, but it does mean that Ted Cruz won't.
Quoth Cruz: "Gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage!"- Does that mean he would SHUT DOWN the debate?
Will #BenCarson give founding father Governeur Morris credit for writing his closing statement: the preamble to the Constitution?
Maybe Trump's strategy worked: in his absence, chief rival Cruz had his worst debate, by far cuz he couldn't benefit by comparison w Trump.

Another gold medal: #Cruz gets award for plugging his website most often in the debate- 5 times? Also cited Rep.Steve King at least 5 times.
OK, #Christie &amp; #Marco win joint gold medal for toughest, most uncompromising rhetoric against Hillary.#Carly got the nod in the Undercard.
In midst of a generally thoughtful performance, #Rand stumbled/contradicted himself on whether abortion policy is a state or fed'l issue
Kasich says: "The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country." Does that mean he wants even more attention to Trump?
Fox panel got the dubious idea to ask Rand, Christie, Bush&amp; even Rubio the same obnoxious question: if you're so great, why are you losing?
Questions have been enormously tough:as harsh on Bush, Rubio, Christie &amp; Cruz as anything aimed at @realDonaldTrump in last Fox debate.
IAnyone buying what #Cruz is selling on his immigration record? Llooks like he's suffering gastric distress, utterly exposed by video record
Sorry, #Jeb!-Puerto Rican statehood is not an issue that helps in any GOP Primary. If he ever got traction, can already see the attack ads
If #Cruz wants to win anything, anywhere, he MUST tlearn not to talk like a bad, slimy televangelist. Breathy, melodramatic phoniness.
#Jeb! gets better every debate and, amazingly, the crowd seems to love it. Somehow, same crowd doesn't seem to love "frontrunner" Cruz
RandPaul says purpose of Gang of 8 bill was to "give citizenship to illegals"- but fact is most of of that bill was about border security
@MarcoRubio gains by not begging for questions, arguing with the moderators&amp; talking passionatel, unapologetically on the Islamo-Nazi threat
Hard not to notice:#TedCruz never answered #ChrisWallace question about squaring his tough talk with his past record of backing defense cuts
OK, maybe Kasich and Carson don't seem more formidable - but then debates have never particularly helped either of these two.
Is it an accident, or my misperception, that all of the contenders seem bigger, more formidable, with the absence of @realDonaldTrump?
Undercard debaters have kept focus on attacking Hillary, Obama - not each other. Hope "Varsity" contenders can do the same!
Fantastic takedown of #Obama by #SenSantorum! This "Undercard" gang is over-achieving.
"I don't see how anyone with IQ about plant life thinks we'd be better off if the govt had all the $...I'm not feelin' the Bern" - Huckabee
#CarlyFiorina just did something BRILLIANT:defending pro-life credentials of #SenatorSantorum.Joyto see conservatives standing together.
Challenging #RickSantorum on not attending the March for Life?!! Who's been more passionate on the pro-life issue than Senator Santorum?
#Carly rips Hillary effectively, brutally, in fact. "If my husband did what Bill Clinton had done I would have left him long ago." Ouch!
@GovMikeHuckabee deserves more consideration than he's received this cycle.He shines in the Undercard &amp; other candidates can learn from him.
@GovHuckabee&amp; Santorum remind us why they won Iowa in the past. Now,tell me,why are Trump&amp;Cruz "serious candidates" but Huck&amp; Santo are not?
Most fanciful phrase of the night: "When Jim Gilmore is president of the United States... "But he does speak well, with a great resume'
On poverty/compassion issues, #Santorum and #Huckabee sound authentic- like they feel it; Carly &amp; Gilmore, not as much.

#GOP debate: an occasionally nasty brawl,maybe fun with a few drinks. But Dems: trapped with a bickering elderly couple in midst of divorce.
If voter is torn between Trump &amp;Cruz, would anything tonight tilt him to Ted? Don't think so. realDonaldTrump had his best debate.
Only way GOP can win: getting some voters who backed Obama TWICE to go for us. Could Rubio or Christie do that? Sure. Others.....?
To those praising "spirited exchanges": they don't help if those exchanges seem silly-about birtherism, NY values, obscure Senate votes,etc
#Christie's closing statement strong, focused, very effective.
Struck me for 1st time: #Jeb doesn't echo his father or brother, but seems to channel his inner Ike--no great communicator,but safe,decent..
Who won the Cruz-Rubio shoot-out? #ChrisChristie, obviously. Maybe even Jeb-who seems solid reassuring, compared to his younger alternatives
The protesters/interrupters were chanting, "we want Rand." Hardly an auspicious gesture as the Paul campaign's last hurrah.
@realDonaldTrump gives a GREAT answer about turning his company over to his children."Go ahead, kids, run the company. Have a good time."
#Christie wins points by his sneering reference to the Cruz-Rubio exchange: "I hate to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate...."
Did Maria B. just promise "another terrorist attack" after the break? That should make everybody stay tuned.
If Trump-Cruz are #1#2 in Iowa,real race is for #3#4. If Christie,Rubio,Carson,Kasich or Bush fall to 5th or worse, they're probably through
Leave aside any questions of substance:in terms of presentation&amp; confidence,@realDonaldTrump is clearly having his best debate so far
Even in SCarolina, #Jeb gets big applause for plea to #Trump to reconsider his Muslim ban.Very revealing.Much stronger performance for Jeb
The impact of the debate format will improve when Carson &amp; Kasich "graduate" to the Jr. Varsity. More chance for sharp, meaningful exchanges
@realDonaldTrump scores against#Cruz on "NY values." Why would Ted want to insult/write-off all NewYorkers?In FL,many voters are NewYorkers
Llove #Marco, but in the exhange with @ChrisChristie, he lost big time-Chris responded in exactly the right bemused and generous tone.
#Trump very effective, even magnanimous, in responding to the Nicky Haley question-and even more so with her smiling image on split screen.
On issue of the  #Cruz loan controversy, neither questioner nor candidate mentioned the source of the loan - GoldmanSachs - did they?
FoxBusiness  panel is asking each candidate questions that play to his respective strengths and needs--allowing strong opening shots
@MarcoRubio is supercharged compared to prior debates - far more firey and impassioned than before in talking about the need to destroy ISIS
#Jeb attacks Hillary effectively, suggesting she might have to spend her 1st hundred days going between the White House and the Court House
#Trump, #Cruz, #Jeb and #Carson: red ties. #Rubio, #Kasich, #Christie, blue ties. Significant? Probably not, actually.
Santorum,Huckabee,Fiorina: 3 great,formidable candidates (incl last 2 Iowa winners). Seems demeaning that they're consigned to Jr. Varsity.

In the battle of the closing statements, strong performances by Carly, Carson, Christie -- the three C's....
@realDonaldTrump gives reassuring, statesmanlike answer about supporting the nominee and eschewing 3rd Party big. High point of debate!
@realDonaldTrump asked whether he still considers #Cruz a "maniac", says Ted is now "just fine." What changed?

nice point https://t.co/Ub2Rhc9nsP
5 people in the hall who keep shrieking and squealing for every single answer by #RandPaul are an increasingly embarrassing distraction
#JebBush gives clear, forceful, credible answer on immigration-- had this Jeb appeared in prior debates, he might be among front-runners
#ChrisChristie shows class,stature in ignoring #RandPaul's nasty taunt about Bridgegate staying focused on overriding issue of security
#JohnKasich wants to "punch Russia in the nose"? Echoing Mayor Thompson of Chicago 90 yrs ago, saying he'd "punch King of England in nose."
#JohnKasich embracing the "Biden Plan" for partition of Iraq?!!
Not that it changes the campaign fundamentally, but #Jeb! is having -by far- his best debate.
#CarlyFiorina is absolutely right to identify #Trump with #Obama on issues of war, peace &amp; the Middle East
#TedCruz sounds pathetic and defensive in trying to defend his pro-Putin position in retaining the genocidal Assad.
Could this, finally, be @realDonaldTrump's Emperor-has-no-clothes moment? His shrugs and winces suggest that possibility.
@MarcoRubio's authoritative,passionate delivery puts him in a class of his own when speaking of fighting ISIS, confronting Assad
Great question by #HughHewitt about #DrCarson's toughness, and great answer by Dr. Carson concerning his surgical experience
Snickers of smirks of #TedCruz while listening to #MarcoRubio don't hurt Marco,certainly don't help Ted-not in debating defense budget
#Trump wants to control the internet by "using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds." Anyone believe he's one of them?
#ChrisChristie scores points in emphasizing importance of executive experience over meaningless debates on Senate floor.
#ChrisChristie scores big points in emphasizing the importance of executive experience as opposed to meaningless debates on Senate floor.
Yes, it's superficial,but #CarlyFiorina's large brass cross is highly visible, prominently displayed.Surely deliberate,emphasizing her faith
#MarcoRubio deftly turns a question about @realDonaldTrump into a passionate indictment of Obama. Very effective.
Honestly,does anyone believe that @realDonaldTrump's opening statement was in equal to those of the other 8 candidates? Did he prepare?
#JohnKasich makes an effective, folksy plea for unity... good start, more effective style than prior debates.

4 times in debate, &amp; in closing statement, @LindseyGrahamSC slammed Cruz &amp; Paul as "isolationist". What's the strategy?
Another good line from the standout in the debate: "Sequestration is Latin for doing really dumb things."- @LindseyGrahamSC
"We don't need a draft, we need a commander in chief that knows what the hell they're doing." - @LindseyGrahamSC, again.
"The reason they don't partner with Obama is that they just don't trust him." -- again, well said by @LindseyGraham
"I'm tired of bashing on George W. Bush. I miss President Bush. I wish he were president right now!" - Amen,@LindseyGraham
If #Huckabee is making a case for giving Assad a pass for crimes against humanity, it's a serious mistake.
#GeorgePataki should be Secretary of State,NOT his Yale classmate John Kerry. Forceful, persuasive-a strong advocate for a great nation
Little 4 of the "Undercard" are looking like the BIG 4. Discussion of war &amp; terrorism is so smart &amp; substantive,wish all US was watching
#GeorgePataki's tribute to US troops, and his 2 sons who served as officers in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, moving and appropriate
#LindseyGraham: "I am in this to win this war, not containment." Strong statement, strongly delivered.
"If Islam is as peaceful &amp;wonderful as its adherents say,shouldn't they welcome us to come in &amp; hear their sermons?"-Good point by Huckabee
Lindsey Graham calls #SenPaul and #SenCruz "isolationists" -- not a way to win friends, or unify GOP, alas
@LindseyGrahamSC makes sense but looks uncharacteristically uncomfortable,as if he's suffering through the"undercard" debate,not enjoying it
They call it the #Undercard but listening to #Graham, #Pataki,#Santorum &amp; #Huckabee,but no doubt any one of these guys is preferable to HRC.

In 2012,59% of voters earned $50K or more, and went decisively (52-46%) for ROMNEY. Obama won on big margin with minority earning under 50K.

#Bernie dodges immigration question by shifting conversation to "living wage" - very slick, and panel doesn't catch it.
#O'Malley gets big applause denoucning "Immigrant bashing carnival barker Donald Trump." Alert media: Trump not popular with Dems!
#Hillary: "This cannot be an American fight."	#Bernie: "Actually, it is America's fight." Doesn't Bernie win this exchange?

RT @PeterBeinart: harsh truth is that if terrorism dominates election as much as it has this debate, Dems will likely lose #DemocraticDebate
#Bernie says "I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower." Is he agreeing with Birch Society that Ike was a secret commie?
@greenfield64 @richlowry  Yeah, she believes all middle class failies work hard. Maybe not true, but a popular notion.
GOP's scary reality:watching #Hillary in 2016 debates,she's VASTLY improved from 2008.The notion she'll be easy to beat is foolish &amp; blind.
Impossible to watch real #Bernie without thinking of #LarryDavid's spot on impersonation--making it even harder to take him seriously.
#Hillary won't accept idea we're at war with "radical Islam"?Keeps saying don't condemn ALL Muslims.OK, but aren't we fighting the radicals?
Given the truly APPALLING calibre of her 2 Democratic opponents, #Hillary turns a "debate" into a long commercial for her campaign.
Can anyone, seriously, imagine #BernieSanders as Commander-in-Chief? Among other things, he keeps talking about "Moooooslim" nations.
#BernieSanders blames invasion of Iraq for Paris terror?!! When all else fails, it's an unfailing Democratic instinct: BLAME BUSH!
I'll be reviewing @SpotlightMovie today on my show at 5:40pm ET. Does it deserve its status as an Oscar frontrunner?
Can anyone doubt that John Kasich wins the "most embarrassing" trophy?
Best: Rubio, by far. Most improved: Carson, strengthening his candidacy big time. Rand should also gain by staking out how he is different.
The panel did a great job, really....and I think we can all forgive #Neilcavuto for botching his Bernies (saying "Sanders" not "Madoff")
If #Cruz could deliver his message without such phony-seeming threatricality, he'd fare much better.Stop the melodramatic,stagey perorations
#Carly scores with a superb,concise and hugely effective closing statement. "Take our GOVERNMENT back"- much better than "take COUNTRY back.
But how big is Kasich's belt buckle? https://t.co/JJ2pl7WYuA
#Kasich &amp; #Cruz argue about big banks, with no mention that Kasich worked for Lehman Bros &amp; Cruz's wife is a sr.executive at Goldman-Sachs
They're doing the jobs Americans won't do https://t.co/fg8JH3lY2A
yes, agree. You go, Marco! https://t.co/Ldhqwv5XNU
#Cruz trying to wriggle &amp; twist rather than answer #Cavuto's direct question: would he let B of A go bust, or rescue it, somehow?
#NeilCavuto called Bernie Sanders a Wall St crook &amp; Ted Cruz agreed, backing his prosecution.Did Neil, perhaps, have another Bernie in mind?
Bold stand by #Kasich: against Wall Street greed, for Wall Street values
amen to that https://t.co/AQS0PZysQn
Is it my imagination, or is #Jeb, "Mr. Low Energy', getting stronger, more persuasive, as the night goes on/
Yes, #Kasich has an impressive resume' but of all the candidates on the stage, he may come across as the least presidential.
#marcorubio is right on Islamist threat:"Either they win or we win. We better take this threat seriously."Strong answer,forcefully delivered
#Trump gets booed for dissing #Carly:"Why does she keep interrupting everybody."Somebody,please,protect the tough guys from the tough chick.
#Carly takes on #Trump again -- showing one of the "outsider" candidates can talk intelligently, authoritatively about foreign policy
#Jeb:"We're not gonna be the world's policeman,but we sure need to be the world's leader."Great response to #Trump's neo-iosolationist mush
Great question from Maria B. to #Trump about Putin &amp; Russia. #Trump doesn't do well talking about how well he gets along with Vladimir.
#Jeb is much improved from the last debate. Could it be that his new media consultant actually earned his fee?
Give @RandPaul credit: he exposed the sad fact that TheDonald knows nothing about what the TPP (that he condemned) actually is.
If @marcorubio wins the nomination, he should thank #RandPaul -who offered Marco such an inviting punching bag on the debate stage
#DonaldTrump just scored a great point: any one of the tax plans by the GOP candidates is better than "the mess we have now." Nice going!
#TedCruz likes the Bible more than tax code --one position that should inspire unanimous agreement.
Retweeted Max Boot (@MaxBoot):		If I understand Cruz correctly, he thinks we should deport Gerry Baker.

#Jeb was far more effective, more persuasive, answering #Trump's "deport 'em all" nonsense than was #JohnKasich
#DrCarson defending himself cheerfully &amp; effectively -- helped by resounding applause from sympathetic audience.
RT @benshapiro: Cavuto says we're only just getting started. Is that a threat? https://t.co/SmEdcAi3oJ
No one does it better.....except dear old dad https://t.co/uDdgHzECmq
It's also a jab at #Trump: "My dad could only give me a little tiny loan of $1,000,000". https://t.co/9DQz3ILdvT
#Jeb's weak interchange with #Kasich followed by a strong answer on growth and shortcomings of Obamanomics. Did anyone notice?
Opening shot by #Jeb: "I only got about 4 minutes in the last debate." Really? Whining hurts him and makes him look sad and vulnerable.
@marcorubio "We need more welders &amp;less philosophers" -1st big applause line of the night. Fluent Marco helped by contrast with Carson,Trump
#Trump looks suspiciously like one of SNL cast members who impersonated him
@davidfrum They don't mention TR lost that campaign (1912) very badly-bullet in the chest &amp; all. He had abandoned the GOP: see what happens?
Will #RandPaul play the role of attack dog against #TheDonald? Real possibility: #Trump slimed him last time, &amp; what has Rand got to lose?
@TobinCommentary  You mean...WAY down South.....
Clear winner in Undercard:@ChrisChristie, of course. Obvious loser: poor #BobbyJindal. Smart, personable #TrishRegan also helped her career
@TobinCommentary @GovChristie  You don't think that Christie can equal the electrifying momentum of #RandPaul, #JohnKasich?
@EdMorrissey @FBNlive @CNBC Right you are, Ed...agree on all points
#LouDobbs on CNBC commenting on debate: must be frustrated that they didn't talk about the threat of "North Americcan Union" &amp; the "Amero"
#Huckabee straight out stole@ChrisChristie's line "it's not about us,it's about you" from last debate.Guv,what about "thou shalt not steal?"
I'm sure he's right https://t.co/wTpslIkr8n
#Sanorum: "Commander-in-Chief is not an entry level position." Good for him!
this ill become a major new meme https://t.co/7LsJSYRsOO
Great question by @TrishRegan: how do we restore the public connection to the military, restore the sense of duty?
@DavidBozeShow absolutely right, Dave. Other than Christie, he's the strongest messenger on that stage
#Jindal has slammed "big govt Republicans" 6 times so far. Should be asked:other than yourself, which candidates escape that designation?
#Huckabee does a nice job explaining, defending the Fair Tax. Toughest question for him; how could you possibly push it thru Congress?
For the record: #DrDianeMedved disagrees with me in thinking that Jindal's performance is a complete disaster. She says: just 1/2 disaster
@ChrisChristie to all law enforcement: "When President Christie is in the Oval Office, I'll have your back."(delivered straight into camera)
Big question:which of these guys can you actually imagine as president? #Santorum and @ChrisChristie, sure. #Huckabee &amp; Jindal, not so much.
#Jindal looks and sounds bitter and desperate. I know he feels cheated due to lack of traction but this is a truly embarrassing performance
#Jindal thinks he can help himself by attacking@ChrisChristie as a liberal.This isn't just a losing strategy,but a formula for looking small
Love it! @ChrisChristie uses the appropriate word "feckless" to describe Obama foreign policy.
Great, smart questions by Fox Business panel in undercard debate, showing complete superiority of Fox to anything associated with NBC
Another touchdown for @ChrisChristie, defending Huckabee and other GOP guvs from dumb attack by #Jindal. He's right to turn fire on HRC
They call it the "Undercard" but these guys - all 4 of 'em --are definitely over-achieving tonight. Hope the main event comes across as well
Great answer -- tight, passionate, effective - by @ChrisChristie on how to counter Dem promises of 'free stuff."
#BobbyJindal derides idea of sending a "big govt Republican to DC". So, which of his rivals does he consider "a big govt Republican"?
@ChrisChristie looking good, and sounding great -maybe re-animate his campaign in this undercard debate--using the setting like Fiorina did.
Debaters should step up to defend #DrCarson from unfair media &amp; Trump attacks.Would help #Cruz, #Rubio, or @ChrisChristie-who could be 1st
Enjoying the fall foliage at Lake Sammamish State Park
I'll live-tweet debates -both of 'em.Will #Christie look bigger on smaller stage? Will his absence help #Rubio shine in main event?
#PeggyNoonan was speechwriter for Reagan. On show today, will talk with her about right debate strategy for Trump,Carson,Rubio,Cruz.

Great to be on CNN's #ReliableSources this morning. New host #BrianStelter seems to be doing a smart, fair and unbiased job.

Who needs another Beethoven 5th? You do! Stunning release @RefRecordings/ Honeck/Pittsburgh SO:soncially glorious, artistically electrifying
A #BenCarson supporter cited on CNN says "he has that calming presence." Is this another way to say he's boring?
#CNBC's problem:not tough questions (which are appropriate), but moderators arguing with each answer. Let candidates argue with each other.
Jeb's idiotic decision to attack @MarcoRubio may have been the last straw for his failing campaign. Undermined his unifier, nice guy aura.
Why wouldn't CNBC have used #LarryKudlow on their panel? At least he could have offered some balance - and helped his potential Senate race.
Biggest loser of the debate? Certainly, @JohnJHarwood. Distorted @MarcoRubio's tax plan, &amp; looked like most biased anchor in debate history.
#MikeHuckabee did superb job with his closing statement. This was more like the old, persuasive governor Huckabee of 2008--should help him
#TedCruz in closing statement trumpets his leadership of fights against Obamacare, "Amnesty" &amp; Planned Parenthood. Who won those fights?
When @MarcoRubio says we have "11 quality candidates" is he excluding 3 of the undercard debaters? Which ones?
"I'm against anything that's bad for my mother!" says @marcorubio--everyone has to support him on that one, I would hope
#JohnHarwood must apologize, on air, for badly distorting facts about @marcorubio's tax plan.If no apology, he should be supended or fired
"Even in New Jersey what you're doin' is called rude!" @ChrisChristie to John Harwood--- way to go!
@ChrisChristie is having a great night! Gets huge applause scoffing at the idea that the feds need to get involved with fantasy football
@ChrisChristie scoring big on issue of "moral authority", slamming Obama for undermining law enforcement. Should be on highlight reel!
Were the questions more appropriate for the undercard debate, or were those four just better than the big ten?
"My tax plan is better than your tax plan" makes all candidates look bad--like traveling salesmen arguing over who sells the better blender.
Is it my imagination, or are the questions to #MarcoRubio particularly hostile?
@DonaldTrump: never great on substance,but this time less likeable than prior debates &amp; much less entertaining-like deflated balloon
Strongest performers so far: Christie, Marco, Cruz -- with Ted the most improved. Weakest performers so far: Jeb, Carson and Trump
#Cruz scoring big time by attacking hostile question, media bias &amp; defending his competitors. Learning from @newtgingrich 4 yrs ago
Will all current candidates look so battered by this process that rank &amp; file will long for #Romney, or #SpeakerRyan, as nominee?
Whoever advised #Jeb that he could help himself by attacking #Marco did him no favors...makes a nice, serious guy look like a bully
#Marco hitting it out of park on answering why he's a "young man in a hurry" and defending missed Senate votes, pointing to media bias
#Carly very strong in saying we've talked about tax reform forever, but never get it done...she's right, of course-must make talk real
#JohnKasich took a double espresso - far more passionate &amp;effective,and Trump for the 1st time in the debates looks genuinely wounded
#Cruz very clever: his "weakness" is that he may not be the best person to have a beer with, but he can "drive you home safely"
Good answer for #Jeb on his biggest weakness:he can't 'fake anger"..then #Trump says his weakness he can't forgive people who "let him down"
#Kasich totally refused to answer question about his biggest weakness! Ouch
Is late start of debate part of the budget deal--sneaky attempt to make it look forgivable that Obama starts late for everything?
Uh-oh! Standing between #Trump and #Jeb makes #Marco look shorter than he is.
Great debate coming up...Friday. No, not GOP candidates, but "Great Halloween Debate," Diane vs. Michael Medved, on radio show, 10/30.
@MittRomney @LindseyGrahamSC  Totally agree, Governor! had a caller to the radio show today who wanted YOU on the big stage
In post debate interviews on #CNBC, by the way, both #Lindsey and #RickSantorum were excellent - even better than on the debate stage
@marcorubio @TeamMarco Go get 'em! The cause of party unity and sane conservatism depends on you.
If #Trump is smart (he is, sometimes) he'll leave it to CNBC panel and also-ran candidates to take down #Carson,keeping his own hands clean
@greggutfeld @GeorgePataki1 Greg, did you just roll a gutter ball at the worthy #GovPataki?
#CNBC keeps asking about a "break-out winner" from the undercard debate. Isn't it getting late for any of these 4 to "break out"?
@GovWalker @RepPaulRyan 	good for you governor -- we're all proud of what Speaker Ryan - and other cheeseheads - have achieved for the GOP
#LindseyGraham deserves credit for forcing a debate supposedly focused on the economy to consider national security issues--GOP issues
#RiickSantorum clearly won battle of the 30 sec.closing statements-but all four probably helped themselves-but not enough to become relevant
#SenGraham huts himself by talking over his time limits, rudely and consistently--ignoring rules doesn't show strength, shows desperation
Maybe some day we'll understand why BenCarson is taken more seriously as presidential candidate than the funny, impassioned #LindseyGraham
#RickSantorum, the voice of blue-collar conservatism, defends free trade, opposes tariffs-and looks better than in any debates 4 yrs ago
Watching #PatakiForPresident on cybersecuirty,slamming Hillary,hard to believe that this smart, credible candidate hasn't won more support.
The "#undercard" debaters get much derision but it's already obvious that any 1 of these 4 also-rans would be clearly preferable to Hillary
#Pataki offers strong case for his support of budget deal:with Obama for holding the military hostage,we can't undermine nat'l security.
#LindseyGraham stood out -- didn't even attempt to answer the first question, but made his own strong point about veterans.

#Bernie needed to project as a wise, kind, pure-hearted sage. Instead, we got the grumpy old crank who snarls "Get off my lawn!"
Did I miss something, or did Dem candidates, and questioners, TOTALLY ignore #Israel as an issue? What a contrast with GOP debates!
Dems on immigration: whacko, extreme.No talk of "path to legalization" cuz they don't care about legalization-or the law.
Biggest improvement for #Hillary from 08 debates?She looked like she was enjoying herself &amp; considering her pathetic rivals,she proably was.
#JimWebb spent too much time talking about entitlements-- his entitlement to more time and attention than he received (or deserved, frankly)
Debate may mark beginning of the end of the #Bernie boom. Politicians can look good if righteously angry-- not if they're just grumpy.
Bernie: "You have not been in Congress..."	O'Malley: "Maybe that's a good thing" - score one for #OMalley
Early in debate, Hillary manages to claim that she's progressive, not moderate, and capitalist, not socialist -- Bernie is helping her here
In the first minutes of the debate,O'Malley and Chafee managed to confirm their own irrelevance. Nice going!
Alert the media: Hillary defends capitalism against Bernie's attacks on the system! That's one debate she can't lose
At Steve Wynn's Las vegas hotel Bernie attacks "casino capitalism"? Oy!
@HillaryClinton Anyone who doesn't see the improvement in Hillary's presentation (style,not substance) over 2008, isn't paying attention.
@HillaryClinton HRC's challenge:Look steady,solid,reassuring. If she comes across as a typical pol,so what?If she looks scary, shaky- ouch.

Witty double entendre of Carly's suggested code name: SECRETARIAT. She started as a secretary, but Secretariat was a winning thoroughbred.
Bush and Kasich couldn't think of an AMERICAN woman to put on US money? Christie wins this one--suggesting Abigail Adams.
If nothing else, this debate should identify those candidates totally unimaginable as POTUS:Paul, Huckabee, Carson, Christie and, yes,Trump
so presidential! https://t.co/Um6uI1ygx3
For the second half of the debate, could any of the others touch @marcorubio in terms of substance, fluency, passion? Bravo, Marco!
Jeb's defense of his brother got biggest applause of the night, will be on any highlight reel, and could reenergize the Bush campaign
Trump doesn't understand the flat tax.Whole idea: simplification so the $50K a yr. guy Trump invokes DOESN'T have a complicated tax form.
If Trump's true-believers bother to watch this debate, won't they at least  question the proposition that their hero always wins?
Why didn't Jeb answer Trump! Bush NEVER said he would cut funding for women's health.Jeb was doing well,but this lack of response hurts him
Kasich: clear,strong on govt. shutdown-hope members of Congress are listening.Cruz condemns Planned Parenthood, but doesn't defend shutdown
How could anyone possibly believe that Trump is more capable of responding to Putin than Carly is? She's scores on this, big time.
Walker is a different guy than last time...rejuvenated. the serious contender his many admirers had hoped to see
Now Trump is attacking....Pataki? Trump's chin-in-the-air mugging truly resembles Benito Mussolini. That's reassuring.
Trump's first response on his appropriateness as commander in chief is to attack....Rand Paul?!! Really? Does he want Rand's scalp (hair)?
Wow! Chris Christie very effective, even stirring, opening statement. Very impressive intensity - and appropriate.
In his opening statement, it's already obvious that Scott Walker has raised his game from his feeble performance last time.
With Rand Paul and Donald Trump, the GOP set up is Hair Force 2, posed in front of Air Force 1.
Christy is positioned on the extreme left of the GOP debate stage (left - from candidates' POV). Is that a coincidence?
John King just described #Trump as a "tornado" on CNN...does that mean he's a blowhard? Full of hot air?
Very good question....We need to hold that KY Senate seat, which should be Rand's focus https://t.co/KCvCG1eN0V
@jpodhoretz Completely correct-Lindsey was folksy, passionate, persuasive.With that kind of performance before, he'd have soared above 1%
Jindal says he's "angrier at the Republicans in DC than I am at the president". Is that what it takes to reboot his campaign?
What does it say about the stature of the GOP field in 2012 that Santorum won 11 primaries?!!
"It is time to get rid of the Republican Party,tart over with a new one." -  Jindal won't help himself with this, or the conservative cause.
"The only people the president can out-negotiate are the Senate Republicans" - another good line, this one by Bobby Jindal
"Do you think Putin would be in Crimea or Ukraine if Ronald Reagan were president? No." - strong line by Graham
Lindsey Graham scores on Iran deal answer. Which first-tier candidate could give a better response?
Is Rick Santorum setting himself up to run 3rd party? Attacking GOP on minimum wage? Economic liberal/social conservative?
Problem with JV debate: with very short answers,none of these poor guys  seems in any way presidential. Hope big debate gives more chance
Jake Tapper &amp; Hugh Hewitt:both great guys but why focus intensely on 2 sideshow issues that hurt Republicans- immigration &amp; Kim Davis?
SURPRISE! #LindseyGraham,of all people, scoring points in JV debate with folksy humor and passionate focus on fighting Islamic terror

Next cunning ploy for #Trump:refuse to participate in next debate (9/16) because deck stacked against him. See what happens to ratings. Ouch
Disinviting, isolating  #Trump, just feeds his narrative of an insecure establishment.Let him self-destruct- not suddenly, but surely.
Megyn Kelly: "After the commercial break....closing statements....and...God!" Did this surprise guest finish among the top ten in the polls?
As predicted on my show, #Kasich may be biggest gainer in the debate. Starting below 4%, he now looks like a folksy, credible contender
Still waiting for Trump to say:1) "I'm really rich" &amp; 2) "I went to  best schools and got  good marks" &amp; 3 why he wanted HRC at his wedding
#RandPaul's smirk hurt him more than Chris Christie's frontal attack...Cruz scores big talking about the need to confront Islamic terror.
The #Trump meltdown continues-amazing! No evidence that Mexico is "sending" its worst!Our leaders all "stupid"? Statesmanlike?Presidential?.
#Trump won't commit to supporting GOP nominee - or rule out independent race? The only one? Looking grumpy, testy, unready.
#Cruz : in elective office a grand total of 19 MONTHS.In that time as Senator, what major positive accomplishment qualifies as presidential?
@jpodhoretz  Look for a new comic book series with a brilliant, Commie-busting corvid: it's RONALD RAVEN!
#Krauthammer just said #CarlyFiorina "won the debate going away." Nice going, Charles!
If #Biden gets in, and #Kerry gets in,joining #Bernie &amp; #Hillary,then top 4 Dems would be between 69 &amp; 74 at election. Dems:party of youth!
Undercard debate: #CarlyFiorina boosted her stock, as did #GeorgePataki. Why, exactly, has this 3 term NY gov gained little traction?
Big advantages for #Kasich in  the #Debates? He's new-kid-on-the-block, with a style even more odd, distinctive &amp; authentic than Trump's
Who'll gain most in #debates? Whoever shines as positive,pragmatic &amp; plausible in field of angry ideologues.Maybe #Rubio,or even #Kasich
With #Pataki, Fiorina, Jindal &amp; Santorum, the "under card" could be more interesting, substantive, than the "main event" with #Trump &amp; Co.
#Biden has 1 big advantage over HIllary: he can credibly offer, in effect, "an Obama 3rd Term." Don't most Dems think that's a great idea?

Looking back on "Battle of Indiana," does it prove that liberals look on sex as more important than faith--more worthy of protection?
#RandPaul pledged "repeal" of "any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color." Really? Including laws against murder?
#Rand thanked his parents for enabling his "long years o medical training" but never mentioneds dad's presidenial campaigns, 30 yrs in DC.
#RandPaul announced is candidacy in the ballroom of the GALT House Hotel in Louisville. Coincidental connection with #JohnGalt?

Obviously, a less powerful US is less able to deter or respond to cyberattacks, terror plots by rogue nations &amp; groups that hate us.
Obama &amp; #SenPaul want US less prominent, powerful in the world. Would that make strikes by #NKorea, #Iran, etc, less or more likely?
Obvious rejoinder, in light of recent events: "#POLICE LIVES MATTER TOO." Who could object to that?
If we staged a national day or appreciation and support for #police, and invited POTUS, what would it say if he didn't come?
Needed: a national day of appreciation and support for the #police. We don't need demonstratins every day. One big rally, honoring cops.

POTUS,Fed'l AG, Gov of MO,St Louis County Exec,#Ferguson City Council -- all Dems. MONTHS of warning--why unable to block rioting&amp;looting?

Amazing &amp; wonderful-looks like #Scott could win by bigger margin than last time(1%) #Crist deserves it
@DouthatNYT  Ross, respectfully disagree.Winning 2 other purple states, IA &amp;CO  makes up for NC,NH. If #Hagan wins,thank the #Losertarian .
Exit polls in NH show 52% show #Shaheen agrees with Obama "too often"; only 40% say right amount. Shouldn't such voters back #Brown?
If Florida remains undecided, with recounts, maybe #RonKlain can take a break from #Ebola to do his old job of stealing votes for Dems
#RickScott surging ahead of #CharlieCrist in FL! Sure, Scott is unlikable but #Crist is thoroughly loathsome.
#JeanneShaheen's brilliant pitch? "We don't need to import a Senator who will only export American jobs!"  Groan.
Proof that Senate is moving right? WVirginia used to elect #Byrd and #Rockefeller, forever.Now, #Capito &amp; #Machin- far more conservative.

What O didn't say: on 9/11, we must recognize #ISIS is no isolated shock, but part of a long-term, worldwide, Islamo-Nazi threat
What if O had said, yes,#ISIL is, in fact, Islamic?That would have made it harder for us, easier for them, to win support in the MidEast
Worst of O's speech: citing achievements of USA against terrorism, it's all post-2009-all credit to himself,none to predecessor
Of course, #RayandJanay could hit the lecture circuit together, becoming the world's most effective voices AGAINST domestic violence.
Imagine a new reality show, "Resurrecting the Rices"- with #Ray&amp;Janay struggling to maintain their marriage, rebuild his career.
If Dems retain Senate control, why expect change? When most Americans crave a shift, the only way to vote for it is to go #GOP.

On veto of the #AZLaw, Dems say: "All's Well That Ends Well" Better titles: "Comedy of Errors" &amp; "Much Ado About Nothing"
Media headlines about AZ "Religious Freedom Bil"l use quotation marks. Headlines about Anti-Gay Bill-same legislation- do not.

Only way to replace Dem Senate majority with a GOP majority is to replace Dems with Republicans. Replacing 1 GOPer with another won't do it.
Politically, it's probably a good thing for GOP that Gov Brewer vetoes the bill. It's difficult to speak logically over all the noise.
AZ "anti-gay" law doesn't "license hate." it merely permits religious arguments as a defense for business people accused of discrimination.
Horrible reporting on CNN re' AZ "gay discrimination" law--with phony signs saying "Welcome to AZ, No Gays Allowed".

On Fox, prominent commentator defends Ted C by saying, "Remember BRAVEHEART!" Well, how about remembering the ending of BRAVEHEART?
In other words, to counter DEM slogan "America Needs A Raise," GOP should answer "America Needs Jobs" - and full-time jobs.
CBO says min-wage hike would cost jobs, but help poor. How? Even someone with min-wage, full time job exceeds govt. definition of poverty.

Since the #SuperBowl is in Jersey, will Gov. Christie be there? How about a debate with #RichardSherman (on anything)?
@jpodhoretz  That's more like it, JP. In our damp top-left corner of the country, we appreciate Richard... stand up guy, good team-mate.
Don't forget: #RichardSherman graduated from Stanford with a degree in COMMUNICATIONS - and even started his Master's Degree.
Friendly word to my friend @jpodhoretz: if you diss #RichardSherman, you should cancel that upcoming lecture in Seattle.

Robertson did NOT "compare" gay sex to bestiality.He listed a series of sins-including drunkenness-citing the need tor forgiveness.
What principle is A&amp;E trying to affirm in suspending Robertson?That's anything less than warm approval of gay conduct is now forbidden?

Airing #Thanksgiving history special on radio show today. Funny to hear my own voice on tape. Alas,no reference to #Thanksgivukah.
In 1865, Rev CW Brown explained why "sun never sets on British empire." Because, he said, God doesn't trust the English in the dark.
Thanksgiving- great to recall our British heritage, but also how and why we're not Brits. Pilgrims ran from England, not to it.

In his 21 hr speech Ted Cruz kept urging Congress"Listen to the people."Now they listened.People hated the shutdown &amp;wanted it over.
Uncomfortable question about current crisis: why now?Answer:pure politics.Obama wanted nasty confrontation&amp;GOP foolishly gave it to him.
We used to joke that Biden was "impeachment insurance" for Obama. But after last few weeks, doesn't Joe look better by comparison?
Do you think cable TV keeps going back to Louis Gohmert and Ted Yoho as voices of the GOP because they make our side look good?
Nightmare! 76% of independents disapprove of GOP in new WashPost/ABC Poll; 58% disapprove of Obama. He's got a bad flu; we've got AIDS.
What a race for Best Actor (already):Hanks, Redford,Cumberbatch, Whittaker. Best Suppt Actor? Consider Daniel Bruhl in RUSH
In CAPT PHILLIPS,4 barefoot Somali pirates take control of a huge tanker with crew of 25. Why? Firearms were prohibited on the ship!
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is not only an outstanding movie, but one of the most powerful pro gun messages ever!
After shutdown, GOP must make clear we're FOR people, not against govt. Yes, sometimes people need less govt, sometimes better govt
In debt ceiling debate, far more risk of disaster if those who downplay the problem are wrong, than if alarmists are wrong.
Everyone knows Congress will, eventually, raise the debt ceiling. Isn't it better to do so before serious economic damage, not afterward?
New name for "#WashingtonRedskins"? How about the "Washington Shutdowns"? Oh, wait. That team wouldn't be popular.

On the radio show today: #JonahGoldberg of NRO about schemes for GOP to escape the current traps
GOP, face facts: public hates Congress right now for too little compromise &amp;cooperation, not too much. End shutdown&amp; face real crisis!
The American people are angry at DC, at govt. Angry because of too much cooperation or too little? Do they want more inflexibility?

@RichardDawkins What a pleasure welcoming you to our radio show - and hope we can continue the conversation when you're in Seattle.
@jpodhoretz Say it ain't so,Sarah! Sure it wasn't Palin, not Silverman? If it was Sarah S, was her cross a sign of derisionor affirmation?
Are predictions of disaster for GOP kamikaze caucus "cowardly"? It's never cowardly to tell the truth to those who don't like it.
Why do Dems control 55 Senate seats? Hey, Sarah P-in part because of GOP candidates like Akin, Mourdock, Angle, O'Donnell, etc...
#Palin says she wants the Senate on "Cruz control." But how do you control any legislative body when Dems have 10 more votes?
The defund-Obacare/shut-down-govt strategy is like a prison hunger strike.Ultimately,you either give up or die. Either way,you lose
#Mariners' sad, underachieving season is slowly winding down; ending not with a bang, but with a whimper.
#RANDPAUL says love for Israel makes Christians too eager to go to war.He'll explain his controversial comments Wed on my radio show.
With Dems running  White House &amp;Senate, how can GOP force defunding of Obamacare? #Rand Paul will explain how-Wed on my radio show
Heard #JONAHGOLDBERG speak tonight to Women of Washington-Seattle conservative activists.He was hilarious, insightful,brilliant.
Sometimes a movie lives up to the hype and the buzz.#GRAVITY is stunning - toally enthralling.You've never seen anything like it.
Final thught: does anyone believe that after weeks of delay &amp; diplomacy, Obama will build more momentum for a military response?
O needs bipartisan suppt on Syria,so why not use big speech to praise Boehner, Cantor,others in GOP who took big risks to back him?
Obama needs bipartisan support to pass his Syria resolution. So why did he meet SEPARATELY with GOP, Dems, earlier today?
Worst part of O's talk: claiming he's better than Bush,cuz he went to Congress first.But Congress debated,authorized both Afgh &amp; Iraq!
Which is it, Mr. President?  Does he demand an urgent response to barbarity- or open-ended delay to give diplomacy a chance?.
If Syrian chem-weapons attack was a "crime against humanity" doesn't it merit more than an "unbelievably small" response?
Just caught up with #Sharknado. Film makes powerful case that global warming may cause twisters full of sharks to devastate LA
#Seahawks, Huskies and Cougars all won 1st game victories against formidable foes, Is Washington new center of football universe?
If Russia does get Syria to surrender its chemical weapons then Obama ought to hand over his Nobel Peace Prize... to Putin.
Kerry vs. Rand Paul at hearings today: riveting face-off. Potential nominees in 2016? Both smart,but Kerry looked more presidential
What's the proof that Obama has no confidence in his planned Syrian strike? He wants Congressional GOP to share the "credit"
Obama changed his mind Friday when walking alone(not with Michelle,Kerry, or Susan Rice)but w/Denis McDonough,his loser chief of staff.Ouch!
Something to celebrate this Labor Day: new brew from Pyramid- "Outburst" Imperial IPA. Amazingly complex and satisfying - wow!
Did someone in DC deliberately undermine PM Cameron? Why release the Syria evidence only AFTER the big vote in Parliament?
What kind of Syria resolution could win GOP support &amp; pass?It would help if demanded more than merely symbolic, gestural action.
Worried about income gap? NYT reports it grew MUCH faster under Obama than under Bush--because poor, middle class lagged so badly.
OK, Obama did the right thing to send decision to Congress. But if Syria is imp't enough, worth-doing, why not call them back NOW?

A censure resolution would have scant chance of passing the Senate, but you'd only need 6 Dem votes intead of 22 for impeachment.
Instead of stupid talk of impeaching Obama, why not censure resolution? Doesn't require 2/3 Senate vote, and won't make Biden prez.
Sorry,NO comparison between Zimmerrnan/Martin  case and Lane shooting. OK shooters arrested, charged right away, NO ONE defended them.
