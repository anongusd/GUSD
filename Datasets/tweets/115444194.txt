Apple growers depend on trade. Importantly, rural economies in states like Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, California, Washington and Virginia rely on a healthy agriculture sector, of which apple exports play a big role. #NeedNAFTA
Thousands of jobs in rural America are at risk, not just in growing and picking the apple crop but also in equipment, fuel and fertilizer sales, and in packing and transportation. #NeedNAFTA
As U.S. apple‚Äôs #1 export market, duty-free trade with Mexico is critical to American apple growers. Canada is also an extremely valuable trading partner. A  2.0 NAFTA agreement with both Mexico and Canada is imperative. #NeedNAFTA
Apple growers export about $1 billion worth of apples annually, roughly 1/3 of the country‚Äôs crop, so trade is critical to the apple industry. #NeedNAFTA
