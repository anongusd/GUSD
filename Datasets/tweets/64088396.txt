@JonahNRO @CShadegg @emzanotti @karol @beyondreasdoubt 2011 I think. She was promoting her book "Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America." In the book she mentioned the French Revolution and so I referenced something from Liberal Fascism and called it a "vital" book.

@charitabee @redsteeze @neontaster Biggest problem with the end of his arc is they spent 7 seasons establishing him as the greatest manipulator in the realm. He orchestrated everything. He should‚Äôve been outsmarted. THAT would‚Äôve been poetic. Instead it was just ‚Äúhey we know everything because time travel.‚Äù
Also, women (generally) don‚Äôt seem to like PDA either. Until they find out the guy also doesn‚Äôt. And then they‚Äôre mad he won‚Äôt love on them in public. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.
@charitabee @redsteeze @neontaster Agree. It‚Äôs why I stopped reading after book 1. I‚Äôd already watched the show when I started reading. Then I realized Martin is never gonna actually finish the books. So now it is just a show to me. But inconsistent character arcs are still a problem even within just the show.
@ChrisRBarron I expect nothing less. I do the same things.
@ChrisRBarron I don‚Äôt even know if I can blame autocorrect. And I hate it when that happens. I feel certain I typed the right thing and don‚Äôt recall seeing any autocorrecting taking place and then BOOM. Wrong word. I‚Äôm going to go kill a kitten now.
@ChrisRBarron I know. I didn‚Äôt notice the error till I published and will now accept my all day corrections rather than break up the thread.
I mean come on. Azora is supposed to temper his sword in the person he loves and then it is a FLAMING SWORD. Gee, I wonder if Danny has anything to do with fire... ü§î

PLANET X. Probably not coming to a theater near you.
As two worlds collide, their worlds merge, and they fall in love. Now they must save humanity ... and each other.
Now, outnumbered on both planets and with war inevitable, Earthling John Santo and Planet Xer rebel Ameleya Friche, begin communicating about the coming catastrophe.
Transmissions with ancient technology began to trickle in as Planet X got closer. Turns our that an insurgency exists on the despotic planet.
As Planet X moves back into range of Earth, no one is aware of the coming danger. No one except the members of a secret society that has protected the history of their ancestors all this time.
20,000 years later, the remains of the advanced civilization on earth have all but disappeared. The colony on Planet X on the other hand has grown. With their sustainable resources almost depleted, but their numbers in the billions, they plot an invasion of their former home.
But before they could, a coup by radicals who wanted to permanently abandon Earth succeeds and the colony was plunged into a time of darkness.
An advanced &amp; isolated civilization colonized Planet X thousands of years ago when it was nearer to Earth. But when they lost contact with those who remained on Earth, they knew something was wrong and prepped to return. https://t.co/DQkE2yaWAk

The reason Dark Phoenix Saga keeps failing as a movie is because they keep trying to make it one movie. It should be slowly building over several films from hints, to larger hints, to substantial moments, to the showdown over multiple films just like they did with Infinity War.

For instance, a lot of times when criminals turn on their crew, they are seen as credible if they acknowledge they were enjoying their criminal lives and are cutting the deal because they got caught. Not that they were somehow an angel caught in a bad situation the whole time.
Cohen‚Äôs testimony would be far more convincing if he didn‚Äôt act like he hated Trump the whole time. Compelling would be ‚ÄúI was impressed, liked and looked up to him, started to see things i didn‚Äôt like, ignored my gut and continued on, eventually woke up, and now I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

@ChristianOncMom @baseballcrank Haven't seen that but will check it out.
@mayoungkin @russell_nm @NewportAntifa @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Yes, this is the primary equation I saw in 2016. The reason it is all still relevant to me 2 years later is because in the time since that equation has shifted. Those 3 things are settled. TODAY they are largely supportive of exactly the things they once objected to.
@russell_nm @NewportAntifa @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom I'm not suggesting there isn't a legitimate equation to consider, nor am I condemning those that made it and came out on the side of Trump. What I object to is the notion that simply identifying the parts of that equation is sufficient to a conclusion.
@russell_nm @NewportAntifa @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom "But Hillary and abortion" is certainly an adequate answer if the question is "what is an example of a false dilemma used as a political campaigning device?"
@Bricola05419227 @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom I have no reason to think evangelical voters were following leadership as opposed to just following trends and polls other than that their stated objections were value-based and those disappeared once leadership provided rationalizations to excuse the concern.
@Bricola05419227 @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Yes, I've read all of that. I promise it's more complicated. I've never suggested the evangelical vote wasn't split ahead of Super Tuesday, it clearly was. But Trump was laying the foundation in the months ahead and leaders were getting on board BEFORE then.
@ChristianOncMom @baseballcrank This is a shameless pitch on my part but you're gonna love my book. üòÇ
@NewportAntifa @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom There's certainly an argument to be made that Trump's base of support was mostly a result of an opposition to elitism. But to suggest Tom doesn't know that would be to ignore that he wrote an entire book about it.
@Bricola05419227 @baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Oh, I have extensively. He was right to assume that he would get them. Like I said, why wouldn't he? What he did not count on was that he could lose them. He did not believe they could be courted away and clearly they could.
@ChristianOncMom @baseballcrank I don't automatically conclude that someone is wrong for doing that (despite how I may come across). For me it is less about evangelicals voting for Trump, it is more about detesting how many (especially leaders) choose to support him.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Yes, he certainly wasn't the obvious choice out of the gate. I don't disagree. But maybe I misread Tom (possible since it was a 9 million tweet thread) but I thought he was detesting their willingness to BECOME his base, not that they already were.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom The assumption the evangelical vote WOULDN'T go for Trump even as he was very aggressively pitching their leaders is the Cruz/Rubio version of Hillary skipping Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom I think this analysis omits how hard he was pitching evangelical leaders. Cruz seemed to think that was his by default (and why wouldn't he?). I think regardless of NE that selling would've paid off the exact same way.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Honestly, the strength of evangelicals is in the south anyway. The northeast is far more mainline protestant than evangelical. I'm not convinced that his showing in the NE, even if it had been bad, would've changed the outcome in the south.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom They key to understanding how evangelicals drove his victory isn‚Äôt separating church goers into groups. It‚Äôs separating leadership from the pews. The pews followed the leaders. And the leaders chose Trump first, pews took a little longer to catch up.
@baseballcrank I think the answer is more complicated. Yes, there were lots of diverse opinions &amp; hesitations among evangelicals during the primaries but there is no doubt that as of January, when Falwell endorsed, the rise in support was swift leading into June gathering of church leaders.
@Mortedelsan Yes, I had a pretty good brief and snarky reply but I decided to go for reasonable discourse which often requires the full 280.
@ilike2beright And if my reply came across as overly-condescending it is only because I was born with a patronization disorder.

@schoolofsmock @BrandyLJensen Look, I get it. As the writer says, she will probably eventually quit (as will I). I think (and I'm speaking for her) her point was that those of us who haven't quit yet aren't trying to glorify it, but we are somewhat lying to ourselves &amp; others when we pretend we don't love it.

@BelsHeather @goofrider I‚Äôve learned that people who are ripe for bait don‚Äôt need to be baited. They‚Äôll hook the worm themselves. When it‚Äôs clear you did it? You don‚Äôt prove who they are really. You just give justifications to their supporters. He helped Tucker tbh.
@BelsHeather Tucker is a known commodity. It's clear that Tucker is the one who got vulgar, I'm not disputing that. But I do not agree that it got personal from him prior to it getting personal from Bregman. And as a result of him "baiting" Tucker, the opportunity to discuss it vanished.
@Cdsfrog Ok, but then who is gonna be the grown-up first? Why not be the grownup and let others reveal themselves as the child? I've had countless debates with liberals and always found a way to either be civil with them or allow them to make themselves a fool. No need to join foolishness
@Cdsfrog Watch the Chomsky video. There‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable way to make the case Bregman made and let Tucker hang himself if that‚Äôs what he was going to do. Bregman went for the attack instead. It‚Äôs Trumpian tactics with bigger words.
@Bennythesnitch I‚Äôve made my opinions of Tucker known many times. My issue here is Bregman. He had a chance to talk about something he thinks doesn‚Äôt get attention and chose instead to bait Tucker. Then takes the Chomsky high road? Nah. Fuck that.
@gmpadis That was your very first response to my thread. The suggestion that Tucker ‚Äúmade it personal.‚Äù I responded to that suggestion by saying he didn‚Äôt. Stop being willfully obtuse.
He is. Tucker obviously got personal back but to suggest that he fired the first shot is very disingenuous. His immediate angle was that Tucker was a puppet who wouldn't talk about this. Tucker points out that he IS talking about it and Bregman does a mocking impersonation. https://t.co/7m6OAN5LNy
RT @JonahNRO: This is an interesting thread. https://t.co/5DFlqJz0CH
What an unimpressive showing by a man who appears eminently impressed with himself. Here's the Chomsky interview that includes the quote. https://t.co/BLnux5xUBI
I wouldn't call myself a fan of Chomsky, Mr. Bregman. But watch how he discusses the idea of a controlled press directly to a member of the press who clearly took some offense at the idea. Notice how he wasn't an asshole to him?
Doubt it. He didn't subvert a propaganda machine. He added to it. Enjoy the youtube videos of yourself saying "BREGMAN OWNS TUCKER ROFLMAO!" You're just another noisemaker.
My question is, whatever opportunities come as a result of this moment, when he inevitably appears on more left-leaning shows who are so pleased at how things went down, would he be sitting there if he "believed something different?"
Because if his argument is that @TuckerCarlson wasn't wiling to discuss it, that's pretty clearly not true. Instead of discussing it Bregman attacked the person.
But that opportunity didn't come up because Bregman instead decided it was a great moment to earn kudos from the left-leaning propaganda wing of what Chomsky believes is a corporate propaganda machine by 'OWNING' a 'LOL FAUX NEWS' pundit
He had the opportunity to talk about something he feels is important &amp; dangerous to what he contends is corporate propaganda. Had he done this, who knows? Maybe Tucker would've shown an unwillingness to allow Bregman to make his points &amp; Bregman could've pointed to his hypocrisy.
I'd argue that Bregman is the one who most fits Chomsky's quote. It seems to me that while he took the opportunity to appear, Tucker doesn't fit the preferred model of a "journalist" &amp; Bregman knew if he treated Tucker respectfully on this point, BREGMAN would lose credibility.
He's sitting there ASKING to discuss the very thing that Bregman is claiming no one is willing to discuss. The way he's offered this quote is like saying "If you offered the opinion that you're LITERALLY offering right now while sitting there, you wouldn't be sitting there." Huh?
So if Tucker brought Bregman on his show specifically to talk about the type of thing Chomsky says journalists should do MORE of and are often prevented from doing, why then would he not be where he's sitting if he believed something different as this use of the quote suggests?
It seemed clear that Bregman viewed the topic he'd been brought on Tucker to discuss was this very type of story. One that is not normally 'allowed' or can't seem to make it through because of the way the 'machine' operates.
He says these "rogue" journalists don't get the same type of elevation and are often subversive and hunting for ways to sneak in the types of stories that are normally rejected by this corporate elite propaganda model.
But the reason it interests me is because I think this is a misuse of the quote. Chomsky described how there are journalists who do NOT view journalists as crusaders or inherently noble having a much more cynical view of the profession (similar &amp; more severe even than his).
Chomsky also concurs with the rightwing (at the time) who believed the media is mostly offering a liberal worldview, though I'm sure since this interview he'd say the corporate model has splintered and there is a large powerful right wing media as well.
Leading up to the quote Bregman uses, Chomsky identified the press as having a misguided &amp; self-serving view of themselves as bold crusaders speaking truth to power and he argues most of them are elevated precisely because their opinions jibe with those corporate elite goals.
This quote is from an interview where Chomsky was discussing propaganda and how he believes the elites broadly control messaging in a way that appeals to "privileged audiences" in service of corporate advertiser's goals. https://t.co/AmuuCxmSnQ

Over and over local news outlets have the best and most objective investigative journalism.

@LibertyAndTech We didn‚Äôt use all their tactics though, and the ones we did use we have paid a price for using. Such as Japanese interment camps. But did we not treat POWs better than our enemies? Did we ever encourage kamikaze pilots? I think there was a desire to remain true to ourselves.
@LibertyAndTech To use a war analogy for a moment, when Americans fought WW2 against enemies we believed threatened the world we certainly didn‚Äôt (or shouldn‚Äôt have) prosecuted it by adopting the morally reprehensible tactics of our enemies just to win, right?

I'll run as president. Here's my platform: Congress does their job or it just doesn't get done. Other than signing what I like from them &amp; other limited presidential duties, it'll be Executive Time for me.
Primarying the incumbent is a waste of time. If you want to defeat Trump from the right you'll need to run as an independent, have access to oodles of money, and be CHARISMATIC AF to overcome the two-party mentality. I don't know this Weld guy but I'm not seeing it. https://t.co/y6Cqq4yQBK

@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso Their only ONLY concern is denying him the centerpiece of his campaign. It remains to be seen if that will pay off. Americans have short memories.
How's Northam's "listening tour" going?
@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso I've rarely encountered anyone that is a Trump supporter who doesn't think the correct process was funding from Congress. The answer "well, we tried the right way now we're going to force it and screw it Obama did x,y,z too" may accomplish the objective but I think is a bad idea.
@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso I was talking about the emergency declaration. And as I said in the reply, I DON'T think he's defying existing process. It is however an example of abuse (by taking advantage of vague language) which we had long recognized as such under previous presidents..
@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso Totally agree. But the argument I jumped in on was specifically about the use of a word to describe it and I think crimes should be specific.
@LDoren @MeredithMarsha1 @JayCaruso No it's not. For instance I think Trump is abusing constitutional executive limits. But I don't think he's defying existing process even though I think he is abusing how those limits are intended to operate.
@LDoren @MeredithMarsha1 @JayCaruso But that's really moving the goal posts. You're saying that their plans to abuse a process were devious and they should be held accountable for that. But that doesn't make it an "attempted coup." Not unless you can show how they intended to act in defiance of the process.
@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso That's my thing. I have seen evidence that these 25th invokers are dumb. But I haven't seen any that suggests they intended to work outside the restrictions of the process. I mean, they dropped it didn't they? Pence never would ever have signed on and he was a requirement.
So chicken nuggets then? https://t.co/Rsc8agGMOl
@LDoren @MeredithMarsha1 @JayCaruso I'd say they were idiots. But unless they intended to enforce his benching outside of the given process, it wasn't illegal for them to try.
True, but when someone tries to do that to Brady and hits a dead end in their attempt and then drops it, it would be odd to say "THEY TRIED TO MURDER BRADY." https://t.co/fmku1GhhBu
@LDoren @MeredithMarsha1 @JayCaruso Sure, but then isn't that why it didn't go anywhere? For it to have been an attempted coup wouldn't there have to be some evidence they intended to work outside the process or regardless of outcome? I think they're idiots, but I just can't call that a coup.
@MeredithMarsha1 @LDoren @JayCaruso But your last point (that Pence would never do it) is why I'm baffled at the claims it was an attempted coup. The process they fairytale imagined hit a dead end and then it went nowhere. That's an attempted coup?
@rbrianc Literally.
@TastelessAlex @LDoren @JayCaruso But that's not it. The VP &amp; cabinet can send a letter restating their case and then the VP becomes president while congress votes. There's like.... a whole process
@LDoren Hey I literally tweeted that before you replied to me.
@LDoren @JayCaruso Which Trump certainly could have done. It never got to that point And had he done that, the cabinet could send a letter restating their case, VP would become acting Prez, and congress would vote. If all that happened would it still be a coup?
It seems like nothing gets people more enraged than hypocrisy. So enraged by it in fact that many will gladly engage unapologetically in hypocrisy to (in their mind) prove how hypocritical others are. It's neat.
I'm very pleased by the overuse of the word literally. It literally pleases me.
@JayCaruso @LDoren Man, this is a volatile convo. If their plan was to violently remove the president absent a constitutional process, that's a coup. If the plan was to attempt to use the 25th amendment &amp; when that failed, the effort stopped, that is ... not a coup.

The uncomfortable possibility is that people would prefer a mandatory "savings account" with the IRS that accrues no interest and results in smaller paychecks just so they can get that "fat check" every April.

@KetoChristineMI @StickmanBleedin @GeorgiaEdeMD It‚Äôs amusing how my intermittent fasting started (I don‚Äôt do this anymore). I was intent on losing weight and would eventually have a large meal. Nothing unhealthy, just big. Then I‚Äôd feel guilty that I felt full and wouldn‚Äôt eat again for like 18 hours.
@CorieWhalen @DanIsett @Pappione #Shitlife is wisdom earned through the fires ... of #Shitlife.
@goofrider @Communism_Kills You guys have been very kind. Thanks for talking it all out with me. I look forward to finding out when our whole crew moves here.
@goofrider @Communism_Kills It definitely was, but the manuscript is in. HUGE weight came off. Enormous.
@GeorgiaEdeMD Thank you!
@goofrider @Communism_Kills But I would say that this same feeling is sort of always right there underneath. All I need is for life to slow down.
@goofrider @Communism_Kills Nah, not really. Just the nature of my business. I was in DC a lot because i was doing a lot of work but once the election hit and went work slowed down (as it always does in election years) and i had to focus on my book anyway. Just sort of the ebb &amp; flow.
@bleigh6 @StickmanBleedin Too kind!
@goofrider @Communism_Kills Ahh, yeah. Probably is. Up until about 4-5 months ago I was traveling to DC pretty much every other week and i know lots of people there.
@KetoChristineMI @StickmanBleedin My weight loss was sort of accidental keto. I was intermittently fasting, making fresh fruit/fresh veggie smoothies, and drinking about a gallon of water a day. It wasn‚Äôt organized but the weight just fell off.
@CorieWhalen @DanIsett @Pappione https://t.co/guk6vGkYNL
@NickInNC @Communism_Kills Yeah, I always seem to come up with excuses for why certain shit won‚Äôt work. (Church is all married couples. Bars are all people trying to pick each other up.

@goofrider @Communism_Kills It is. I‚Äôm definitely an extrovert, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. I‚Äôm not sure you can do what i do and be an introvert. But yeah, I‚Äôve been adopting introvert behaviors recently which is just weird.

@Communism_Kills @goofrider I do indeed. https://t.co/GLLjACmHv9
@goofrider @Communism_Kills hah, ooooh no. I‚Äôm way not an introvert. Class clown all my life. I‚Äôm pretty loud and obnoxious. What you see on twitter is how I am in real life. BUT I‚Äôd say it goes to what you were saying. If I am an extroverted social type then certainly isolation would be bad, no?
@Communism_Kills @goofrider Right. It would be like exercising once every 3 weeks. What‚Äôs the point? Either get on a regiment or just don‚Äôt exercise. But going once every 3 weeks does nothing except take you away from ... doing nothing. üòÇ
@Communism_Kills @goofrider I honestly can‚Äôt explain it. If I‚Äôm being honest I would say probably the random nature of it? Like, it‚Äôs not that appealing to go out with a friend you know you‚Äôll only hang with once in a blue moon. It doesn‚Äôt feel social, it just feels... like I‚Äôd rather read a book?
@goofrider @Communism_Kills I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs chicken/egg. Given that I have a full week to do what I want and go where I want I still reject invites when they come and tend to not go anywhere. I got a wework office to get around people but I haven‚Äôt gone in in two months. :/
@Pappione Actually, it‚Äôs called #ShitLife and you‚Äôre welcome to be a member! Other members include @DanIsett and @CorieWhalen (though I think Corie is more of an alumni at this point as her life got good).
@Communism_Kills I have thought that 90% of the problem is isolation. I work from home and live with my kids 50% of the time but there‚Äôs no wife and no social network here (I foolishly made my social life in DC which is 3 states away). Haven‚Äôt figure out how to solve that.
@NursePatrickQ @DaniSButcher @texfischer @jack I generally only block trolls (who no one I follow would‚Äôve followed anyway so they aren‚Äôt a problem). But there are a couple of people that the block was personal, not ideological. So it would feel weird to block our mutual friends over that.
@MrsWilliams___ @Freedom_528 @libertynjustus I am notoriously sarcastic but no, I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic. As I said to someone else I was truthfully explaining things but I had thought I‚Äôd written it in a way where the responses would be humorous tips. Their concern made me concerned lol. Good I guess?
@Communism_Kills Nothing in particular caused it to change? And congrats on getting through it!
@DaniSButcher @texfischer @jack He does raise a good point though which is that it‚Äôs odd how if I block someone I still see retweets of them (and presumably they still see retweets of me).
@goofrider @LaurieGT17 Nah, we get along great. No remaining hard feelings or any of that. She lives two doors down actually and we co-parent like a boss.
@Freedom_528 @libertynjustus I like what Ragnar said in Vikings to his Bj√∂rn.

@Heardbeast @gopcalmom Interestingly I used to get this all the time for years when I was overweight. It went away after I lost about 80 lbs so I assumed that it was weight related (snoring went away too). But now it‚Äôs come back with a vengeance even though I‚Äôve kept the weight off for over a year.
@Patriot_Musket Nah. I‚Äôve never been a heavy drinker (excluding a few years working in restaurant). I rarely if ever have alcohol in the house.
@talleststone Nah, it‚Äôs not flippant. I get it. I took a month off from late November to late December. It‚Äôs not bad advice. I work from home, have my kids every other week &amp; rest of the time am fairly isolated so I guess I come here a lot just to interact with humans as I‚Äôm naturally social.
Also, I appreciate the concerns from well-meaning friends telling me I should not talk publicly about such things, so to you all I say thank you and i love you but for reals, I‚Äôve always been an over-sharer. It‚Äôs ok.
@tagodzilla I don‚Äôt really drink tbh. I mean I‚Äôm not against it but i never have alcohol in the house and rarely go out.
Oh and I have night terrors. As long as I‚Äôm over-sharing figured I‚Äôd throw that in the mix. Pretty much every night. I‚Äôve woken up yelling and unable to breathe (or at least I somehow don‚Äôt think i can) but most nights it‚Äôs just a run-of-the-mill unexplainable freak out.
@Drewdunn23 Way done did that.
@SCinCal @MiekeEoyang Interestingly I had a few people DM me (and even a few tweets) thanking me for apparently wording it in a way they had struggled to so yay for over-sharing on twitter?
@JonnyPullen @MiekeEoyang I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with my feed but ‚ÄúMr. Macho‚Äù seems pretty far off the mark. I‚Äôm nothing if not a smorgasbord of over-sharing vulnerability on this site and elsewhere.

@dinok1975 No, I am annoyed or ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by what I perceive to be dishonesty or hypocrisy. I found your posture in reply to my condescension joke hypocritical. Thus my argumentative posture.
@dinok1975 And I quote-tweeted you with a mildly amusing joke. I welcome you to point to how I was utterly offended in the making of that joke.
@dinok1975 If you can‚Äôt look back and see that‚Äôs exactly what happened then you have extremely poor reading comprehension.
The speech was fine. Good economic news is always good. As for what is ‚Äúgoing to be done‚Äù? Put it this way: this is at least the 10th SOTU in a row that said ‚ÄúWE GOTTA DO SUMTHIN ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE.‚Äù So color me skeptical anything else mattered.
@dinok1975 Yes, well as the supreme authority on things I think and say, yes I can certainly credibly claim to see things the way I said and intended them. What you can see is apparently another matter.
@dinok1975 It didn‚Äôt ‚Äútake me a while‚Äù. My argument was that it was laughable you wanted to come across as Mr. Measured after calling someone an arrogant dick. Then you kept saying ‚Äúfine maybe you‚Äôre not a dick!‚Äù And I confirmed, ‚Äúoh, no I am a dick.‚Äù These things happened.
@dinok1975 I wasn‚Äôt. I cheekily responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I condescended your little life‚Äù as a way of being condescending while apologizing for being condescending. It is a canned joke that I‚Äôve deployed before. Then I marveled at your desire to appear magnanimous after calling me names. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@dinok1975 Adapting? I‚Äôm not adapting. I called you out earlier for saying I was a dick and then sheepishly pretending to be the voice of non ad hominem. But my irritation is definitely about this notion that I‚Äôve ‚Äúchanged.‚Äù I‚Äôm exactly the same.
@dinok1975 I‚Äôm not thinking before I‚Äôm replying? I think it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre not reading. I didn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been like this‚Äù as a human being. I meant I‚Äôve always tweeted like this and written as you‚Äôve read. Seems to me you only noticed when you didn‚Äôt like who I was talking about.

@dinok1975 Well, actually I am a dick. And can be arrogant. But that‚Äôs just not a new thing is what I‚Äôm taking offense at. I basically have always been exactly like this but conservatives get really REALLY upset when it‚Äôs not pointed at the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù targets.
@dinok1975 I have no idea how they‚Äôre run and never claimed to. Nor did the ladies who wrote what they wrote. They said this was their experience with Salem (my experience too) and what it told them about Salem compelled them to leave. NEVER claimed people were forced to write propaganda.
@dinok1975 You have no idea what I think or consider on a regular basis. I‚Äôm arguing with people on twitter. This isn‚Äôt some alien concept and I‚Äôm not threatening violence for Pete‚Äôs sake. You wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed if it was directed at a liberal.
@dinok1975 Dude, knock it off with the anger management condescension. It‚Äôs obnoxious. I‚Äôm answering your questions. Stop giving me therapy unless you want some returned.
@dinok1975 What she did was two things. 1) She characterized the argument as ‚Äòthese people are saying that those at Salem are being told to write propaganda for Trump.‚Äô That‚Äôs not what was claimed at all. And 2) Declaring the substance of the complains (based on that straw man) untrue.

@dinok1975 I‚Äôm as snarky as anyone else on here and if it was directed at people you disliked you‚Äôd be cheering it on. You‚Äôre feigning offense after calling me a dick? That‚Äôs weak, man.
@dinok1975 Dude. You can‚Äôt call someone a condescending dick and whatever else you said and then stroll back in as Mr. Magnanimous wishing me the best as though you‚Äôre above the fray. That‚Äôs just bad form.

@molratty @Patterico I NEVER SAID ALL OF SALEM IS LIKE THIS. SO ONE MORE TIME WHAT???
@molratty @Patterico It‚Äôs interesting how you keep acting as though she‚Äôs all in the right because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs only talking about twitchy‚Äù even though she‚Äôs doing so as rebuke of people that we‚Äôre talking about REDSTATE. WHat untruth was being spoken about Twitchy? (Answer: none)
@molratty @Patterico She mischaracterizes what we‚Äôve been saying claiming that we said that everyone there is getting marching orders when that‚Äôs explicitly NOT what we said and you think we‚Äôre the ones with the irrational beef? Not what we said. And she declared it so and then burned her straw man.
@molratty @Patterico ‚ÄúAnd I'm sorry but I can't stay quiet watching smart people who are great writers getting accused of toeing the line for Trump because some faceless evil boss is making us write that way. It's just not truth.‚Äù 		Absolute judgment on validity. Didn‚Äôt even get accusations right.
@molratty @Patterico Insane. You project words on to me that I didn‚Äôt say, ignore or rationalize away words she DID say, then tell me I‚Äôm not listening? Preposterous. Whatever.

@molratty @Patterico Why is all the absolutism (which I don‚Äôt offer) projected on to me but none of the absolutism that she literally offers in her thread relevant? You seem like you‚Äôre just protecting without being remotely objective.
@molratty @Patterico Plenty of people who stayed at RedState right after the purge, spoke up about how they hadn‚Äôt received such treatment. Never had an issue with them. Because what they didn‚Äôt imply was that it doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not true‚Äù is a direct quote from her thread. That‚Äôs on her.

It is inexcusable that MacBook Pro doesn't have a touchscreen.
@bronzebarbarian @Jaycollinwood @molratty Oh please, that wasn‚Äôt why I said that. I‚Äôm sure @molratty is more than accustomed to my snark.
@sirensoIiIoquy Sure. But it‚Äôs the absolutism in the statement ‚Äúmoney won‚Äôt solve your problems‚Äù that I found misleading. Solving the ‚Äúrent‚Äù problem won‚Äôt make every person pursue happiness with less inhibition. But it‚Äôs relative and for many, it could.
@sirensoIiIoquy It‚Äôs certainly not a given. But whether it‚Äôs therapy or self-reflection or finding a passion, or any other solution, the looming issue of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can make rent‚Äù surely interferes with pursuing happiness.
@sirensoIiIoquy Yeah, ‚Äúbetter problems‚Äù is probably the wrong way to say it. More like I believe you can be better positioned to deal with bigger problems if you don‚Äôt always have the issue of money looming over you.
@Baryugin yeah, I considered this angle as well. But I don‚Äôt know that every problem related to money is the result of something someone did wrong or can fix. The problem is ever believing money WOULD solve your problems. But that doesn‚Äôt mean some solutions aren‚Äôt simply ‚Äúmore money.‚Äù
@sirensoIiIoquy Absolutely. But surely you have a better chance of overcoming those without wrongly believing all your unhappiness is centered around lack of money. Aren‚Äôt you better equipped to get to the root of problems if you don‚Äôt have ‚Äúlack of money‚Äù as the wrongly identified problem?
@sirensoIiIoquy Better problems though, in a way. If you‚Äôre someone who suffers from depression for instance, but you can‚Äôt afford therapy and you‚Äôre working 3 jobs with little time to think or reflect, aren‚Äôt you better off with money not being the impediment to dealing with those problems?
@sirensoIiIoquy I think many are. But a LOT of times I think the people that still are unhappy are the ones who ever believed they were only unhappy because they didn‚Äôt have money. Then they get it and find out they were wrong. So the problem is about ‚Äúlove of money‚Äù IMO. Not whether it helps.
@sirensoIiIoquy I think where money ‚Äúmakes people happy‚Äù is not in that it solves all their problems. It‚Äôs that it can stop being the largest distraction from dealing with their actual problems.
People often back it up by saying ‚Äúmoney is the root of all evil‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the verse. The verse is ‚ÄúLOVE of money is at the root of ALL KINDS of evil.‚Äù
‚ÄúMoney won‚Äôt solve your problems‚Äù is one of the most misleading but truthful statements there is.		It‚Äôs true of course. Money WON‚ÄôT solve all your problems. But it will solve any problem where money is the solution. And many people‚Äôs problems are money problems.

@molratty Of course she does, I don‚Äôt know how my tweet prevents that. I have a right too, yes? Either way I don‚Äôt see how anyone else‚Äôs reputations were at stake. Everyone who has left over this has specifically pointed out this is not everyone‚Äôs experience &amp; respect writers still there.
@earlp1231 Everyone, including the ones who quit recently, went out of their way to confirm that they respect and admire their colleagues still writing there as they offered their take on management. That civility was not returned. So I saw no reason to be measured in my distaste.
@earlp1231 There‚Äôs certainly a way to do that without making it seem as though you‚Äôre blowing the whistle on people you‚Äôd called friends as though they are lying about what they universally experienced. That‚Äôs not what was done.
@molratty I think it is supremely generous to act as though that thread was written as an alternative experience. It‚Äôs not how it comes across at all. It is written as a rebuke of a premise. A rejection of something that people she‚Äôs called friends had their lives altered as a result of.
@molratty I did. And just reread to make sure. Literally not what was said. Specifically said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just not true.‚Äù
@molratty And? Those jobs &amp; alternate experiences negate the experiences of others? Why not say ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt experienced what these people have so I can‚Äôt speak to whether it happened. Here‚Äôs MY experience.‚Äù No, instead it was a rebuke of the premise. A premise which had severe consequences.
@molratty Tell ya what. When you and your sibling and several friends get fired for something, and then someone else who wasn‚Äôt there and claimed to be your friend claims the underlying thing that caused the firing didn‚Äôt happen, tell me how friendly you‚Äôd be. K?

The only way a politician could even potentially find the second of those two options reasonable is if he has faith in a partisan system that will spin on his behalf. They don‚Äôt need to convince EVERYONE. Just enough people.
Northam is highlighting the disease of politicians. He‚Äôs more averse to being truthful &amp; apologizing while living with the potential that some voters may abandon him over it than he is to lying in an attempt to trick voters while living with the potential he may get caught.

It speaks to the ‚Äúaccept apologies‚Äù thing which I‚Äôm a big proponent of. I could believe he‚Äôs a different person than he was 35 years ago. But trying to lie &amp; squirm out of it? Kinda makes it seem like he‚Äôs not.

There was never any chance of him changing that view for me. He is who he is and I guess I got the first taste of it back then, thus the opposition to him in 2016 and ongoing criticism since. He‚Äôs still that guy.
I‚Äôd already found Trump to be a distasteful figure but mostly thought it was an act. It was really that particular moment in time that I started to see him as a different kind of slimy and unethical.
It was as though he did the Tony Soprano divorce move of calling every lawyer in town with no intention of actually hiring them, just to create conflicts that would prevent his wife from hiring her own attorney.
Of course once the presidential aspirations evaporated so apparently did the book negotiation.
I recall @EWErickson, our editor at the time, being furious about it and telling all of us that while the edict was out of his hands there had been no rules regarding our conduct elsewhere and he encouraged us to amp up whatever our criticisms were on social media/other websites.
We had, at the time, been a chorus of mockery when it came to Trump. So were were instructed that while the book deal was underway our front page disdain for him was not welcome.
I‚Äôll never forget RedState‚Äôs old owners, Eagle Publishing, sending down an edict that they were negotiating a book deal with Trump (who at the time was publicly talking about running for president) and apparently he was unhappy about our front page criticism of him.
Shoulda seen the writing on the wall all the way back in 2011 about conservative media.

@TxTolduSo Again, who said I would do that? You are so locked into this idea that I must vote for either of them. YOU are the one being used to contribute to the perpetuation of their bullshit by accepting the premise of their game.
The main reason our trajectory never substantially changes is because the only answers to problems anyone finds acceptable are ones with near-instantaneous results. Some shit takes a long time and involves suffering.
@TxTolduSo No one likes my better way because they want to avoid suffering and I don‚Äôt think there is a way to do that. My better way is long, arduous, thankless and involves compartmentalizing current events in favor of future outcomes that may take decades to achieve.
In reality you literally don‚Äôt. https://t.co/ahBZszDzM0
@TxTolduSo Not sure why you think that‚Äôs what i said.
There are some that call for voting for the other team to teach the home team a lesson about how teams are bad. I don‚Äôt subscribe to that and I know a lot of conservative Trump critics that don‚Äôt. We need to start breaking this up into sub-categories. https://t.co/jmhTtoQyr0

I have no beef with private sector folks that want to collective bargain. Their choice. But when I was in the more traditional blue collar workforce I would‚Äôve left before I‚Äôd put my bargaining in the hands of a group. https://t.co/RgxlEaBrlH
@Knwl1129 Sure. And I‚Äôve known women who made life altering and difficult decision at 10-20 weeks as well. But there are also plenty of elective or, one could argue, ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù ones in 1st trimester. Doesn‚Äôt it stand to reason that poorly written laws would allow for ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù in 3rd?

@Knwl1129 The trimester in which a fetus is considered a protected person has been fluid pretty much since the beginning. 3rd trimester has always seemed to me to be an obvious next step since I struggle to understand what would make a 22 week fetus less or more a person than a 35 week.

I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt be nuanced on everything. Sorry if that disappoints anyone.
@Knwl1129 I understand that he has offered and is defending one specific example that has reasonable sounding parameters. But it is in the service of defending and supporting a bill that codifies infanticide IMO. It‚Äôs atrocious.
@JanekKayley I have a ton of nuance about a lot of thing. I have none for this and never have. I‚Äôll not be awful to regular people that do have nuance on it, but I always reserve the right to attack politicians.
@Knwl1129 It is not. The bill allows for abortion up until the point of birth. That is the bill he is defending. There‚Äôs no nuance in a full term baby being aborted.
@JanekKayley The bill he is defending allows for abortions up until the point of birth. He can offer a specific example that falls short of that atrocity but that is the bill he is defending.

@commonsensehum1 It would ruin the fun if I admit anything.
@laehj @SarahJohnsonPR @AlyssaEinDC I'm not sure there is polling on this but I could give you some anecdotes. Like for instance that game shows like the Price is Right center their games around people NOT knowing prices. Or the amount of bad credit and finances among Americans.
@laehj @SarahJohnsonPR @AlyssaEinDC Preceded by the sentence, "You're in the majority." Which pretty clearly indicates an awareness that it's not everyone. Which lends quite well to the idea that "we" referred to "people like us" as in "the majority" she referenced.
@laehj @SarahJohnsonPR @AlyssaEinDC It's neat watching you assert absolutism on someone while decrying what you perceive as absolutism. 		What was absolutist that she said?

@karol @SethAMandel @LahavHarkov If he senses the wind is blowing in favor of full govt controlled healthcare he‚Äôll find a way to say that‚Äôs what he wants and assure his base that it‚Äôs somehow not the same and they will believe it.

@Dylan_Housman Ahh, thank you.
What is everyone talking about with Kamala Harris and cars? I missed that bit.
‚ÄúThis overreach by President Obama is breathtaking, and every American should be unnerved by the implications of this decision. The executive action is unprecedented and tramples on the concept of constitutional checks and balances.‚Äù - Lindsey Graham, Dec 3, 2014. https://t.co/rrLmUmMRkH
I distinctly remember being called a wild conspiracy theorist in 2009 for cautioning that Obamacare was crafted as a stepping stone towards the goal of dismantling private insurance and instituting government healthcare. It so obviously was. Come on.
@DanielDannyc12 https://t.co/A0zatNRezS
@katherinemiller @SethAMandel The goal is always the same though, as is the ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù strategy. Obama wanted a public option and settled for one stepping stone short. Now they‚Äôll ask for dismantlement of private insurance but settle for public option. Then the next step, the next step. It‚Äôs inevitable.
@Conroc666 Well, my point is he was a Democrat precinct captain and supported democrat causes. His being a democrat however, had nothing to do with him being a psychopath. And the same is true of Bundy being a Republican.

Well...no. I was tweeting about Trump‚Äôs declining insult form, not the validity of that which was being insulted. https://t.co/CPzumvrm07
FWIW I never thought America had any other destiny except the dismantling of private insurance and the implementation of some sort of government operated ‚ÄúUniversal Healthcare‚Äù after Obamacare became law.  It was a ‚Äústepping stone‚Äù as we all knew.
@danpolovina @NoahShachtman Universal coverage, yeah. But they‚Äôve continually &amp; for years gotten in trouble if they suggested that required dismantling private insurance. The big argument against Obamacare critics was that it was NOT ‚Äúgovernment controlled.‚Äù Kamala is calling for exactly that.
@danpolovina @NoahShachtman You‚Äôre describing the details of plans, I‚Äôm discussing the optics of comments and how they are played out in campaign politics. Obama specifically went after Hillary for a plan that he said ‚Äúforced people‚Äù to have insurance. His was billed as a market solution with public option.
@danpolovina @NoahShachtman Well, I wasn‚Äôt suggesting a 1-to-1 comparison. There have been many different ways to describe it (universal, single-payer, M4A, etc) which all have various differences but the same goal. So I say ‚Äúlike this‚Äù to indicate similar, not identical.
@heckyessica The York Mets are a great team though. Way better than the New York Mets.
Ok, autocorrect. I‚Äôll grant you that I‚Äôve accidentally typed ‚Äúibe‚Äù a lot when intending to type ‚ÄúI‚Äôve.‚Äù But how did your AI possibly think that the answer to that was to start autocorrecting ‚ÄúI‚Äôve‚Äù to ‚Äúibe‚Äù?
@oliverdarcy @TuckerCarlson Did he say anything about your eyes? Alex Jones has an investigative report on that I‚Äôve heard.
@danpolovina @NoahShachtman Kucinich and Sanders come to mind. Not to mention Obama leveraged Hillary‚Äôs calls for universal healthcare against her in the 2007-08 primaries to great effect.

@julie_kelly2 That I participated in a media driven attempt to destroy these kids. I made a shitty comment about a facial expression knowing almost nothing of what was going on. Once i understood I deleted and apologized to the kid and his family.
I did nothing of the sort. Good to know though that you think had I done such a thing I would have been culpable since you‚Äôre encouraging it now and I‚Äôve got four young kids. At least I know who to sue. https://t.co/ZLrvfTbEpK
@HarleyDavid66 @julie_kelly2 I didn‚Äôt run with a fact-free narrative despite Julie‚Äôs claim. I made one comment about one facial expression in one photo. I never said a thing about the confrontation or media narrative. Try again.
@julie_kelly2 You‚Äôre suggesting I should‚Äôve kept them live? I thought the point was to lower the spotlight on these kids. Or is that not the point? Either way I‚Äôd already publicly apologized by the time you asked why no one was demanding I do.
For shits and giggles let me explain. 2 years ago it was decided by various figures on the right online that my divorce was the result of spousal &amp; child abuse and my ex-wife fled the state after dumping me in a Starbucks. I still get messages just about every day about it. https://t.co/lfwKVOjIYc

@HonkyTonkJew Oh they didn‚Äôt share the doxx. But I‚Äôve seen it and that‚Äôs the only article I know that has written about it.

Oh neat. That‚Äôs twice I‚Äôve been doxxed now. Both times from the right. You guys are fascists. I never doxxed anyway or said anyone‚Äôs name. I made one comment about a facial expression, apologized &amp; deleted. Scorched earth time. Fuck all you people.  https://t.co/Nno0h2IWU2

@Kaitain_AZ @ihate_everyone2 What was me last weekend?
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip And that‚Äôs what I have chosen to learn, certainly. But to be clear my belief that you are not inerrant was never a judgment anyway. I‚Äôm not saying errancy equals bad. That would undercut my entire premise for everything I‚Äôve said.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip I struggle to believe that you are as inerrant as you portray yourself to be but who knows.
@PopeSpurdo @Mellecon @hwmulholland I can feel bad about perpetuating an image and then deleting it without also believing that what I did was worthy of a lawsuit. You suffer from sort of ‚Äúblack &amp; white‚Äù condition I can‚Äôt comprehend.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip Nah, I think generally speaking people jump to conclusions about as little or as much as I do. Perhaps with smaller audiences, perhaps with larger ones. I try to own it when I fuck up. Many don‚Äôt. They have the luxury of being ‚Äúalways right.‚Äù I draw attention to my mistakes.
@hwmulholland @TracyJeffords @Mellecon Love your enemies is always a difficult concept and one i struggle with. It‚Äôs still right. This isn‚Äôt my inherent nobility or righteousness. I‚Äôm not preaching. I was preached TO and when I fuck up I try to return to what it was I was preached to about.
@KestrelArts @DeargDionadair Plenty of that being discussed. But I consider grace to be the single most important thing in all of history and for all time. So I will continue to heat its drum no matter your distaste.
@PopeSpurdo @Mellecon @hwmulholland I won‚Äôt be sued. I did nothing deserving of being sued. This continual obsession with legal warfare over this is amusing but delusional.
@BBC_dip @ihate_everyone2 Self-reflection does not require me to relinquish my own reasoning. Talk me out of it or don‚Äôt but I‚Äôm under no obligation to accept you as wise. 		I‚Äôm interested in changing and seeing change. Everything you‚Äôve said seems to be geared towards establishing your superiority.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip Sure. And where I‚Äôve contributed I‚Äôve sought to correct. And when I embark on the correction I try to acknowledge it. Yet, the reaction is the same each time. Which won‚Äôt stop me, but felt worth observing. So I did.
@hwmulholland @TracyJeffords @Mellecon No i shouldn‚Äôt have. Because what I was describing was not what happened to me. I‚Äôm talking about the people who DON‚ÄôT admit when they‚Äôve changed their mind for fear of the very reaction you‚Äôre offering. It‚Äôs a problem whether or not you choose to ignore it because it‚Äôs from me.
@KestrelArts @DeargDionadair No. The problem I‚Äôm identifying is how it keeps divisions open, not some personal cost to me. I have addressed this before and despite knowing what the reaction will be I still apologize if i need to. I‚Äôm no victim, I choose it. So... no.
@rita65011991 @repub9989 @Mellecon @hwmulholland I don‚Äôt follow any of your conclusion here as to how it relates to what i said but I appreciate your use of caps.
@BBC_dip @ihate_everyone2 Quite the opposite. Your entire hierarchy of doubt is premised on the idea that people only apologize out of appeasement, not sincerity. I have sincerely offered my thoughts. In that vein i see no reason to contort my thoughts simply to appease you.
@hwmulholland @TracyJeffords @Mellecon You seem to believe that ‚Äúmorality advice‚Äù should be offered by those free of the burden of being immoral. So let me congratulate you on your perfect morality.
@TinaOrtegaUSAF I‚Äôll write what I think and if no one listens that‚Äôs ok.
@BBC_dip @ihate_everyone2 I really could not care less what you‚Äôre looking for.
@ConservaTex I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not true but I doubt you‚Äôll believe me so it‚Äôs an exercise in futility.
@GaltJhonny Your acceptance of an apology that wasn‚Äôt offered to you is declined.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip I was doxxed by the right and had lies spread far and wide about my divorce.  I've been the subject of articles written at liberal websites that highlighted my tweets &amp; deemed me racist. If I seem like I'm always saying both sides are capable of being shit, it's because I am.
@Gabi4Trump I have zero fear of a lawsuit. I can't even imagine what could possibly be described from any of my offenses as slander or libel. So at least for me, no, that's not a consideration.
@sirensoIiIoquy Many of the people I see fuck up each time aren't the ones who apologized from what I saw.
@strong_coffee71 @repub9989 @Mellecon @hwmulholland Eh. I have no intention to surrender my sense of humor or snark among all this. If someone decides they need to let me know they're unfollowing while lobbing an insult, I will attempt to draw out a humorous response.
@marnes I mean, we react to memes and photos and screenshots all the time. It's not that unheard of. But there was a cost here and when that cost became apparent many people backtracked.
@gts109 I wasn't apologizing to you, sorry.
@TinaOrtegaUSAF You've solved that problem by not following me. I urge you to continue.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip I wait on stories &amp; withhold judgment all the time. I didn't this time. And will endeavor to do better as I said. But I will not surrender my observations about people who preach this need for restraint and good faith while practicing none of it. Which is what my thread is about.
@BBC_dip @ihate_everyone2 Your dreams will not come to fruition. I'm afraid that my tweeting a photo and commenting on a facial expression are protected speech even though it was wrong to do so. But good luck.
@repub9989 @Mellecon @hwmulholland The media as a whole is untrustworthy. But we're discussing individuals here, are we not? What spurred my thread was watching the reaction to SE Cupp's apology.
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip Beyond deleting and apologizing what is it precisely that you are suggesting? Going back in time and not doing it?
@repub9989 @Mellecon @hwmulholland Just seems like an endless loop of bad faith. How do the insincere ever become sincere if they ever never afforded the opportunity to do so?
@ihate_everyone2 @BBC_dip The person in the photo and his family.
@TracyJeffords @Mellecon @hwmulholland I think there was a sense of justice in the minds of anyone who came after my kids. As though to say "Go after this kid, your kids are fair game." I don't agree with that mentality but I sense this was the justification.
@BBC_dip @ihate_everyone2 You may simply be searching for me to be sorry for things that I'm not sorry for.  The evidence that this is the case is exemplified by the fact that you seem to believe there was ever an apology that you were in a position to accept. My apology was never for you.
@ADmomof3 You've judged me morally unfit to speak on morality. That is... being a moral arbiter.
@Mellecon @hwmulholland I can only speak on my own behalf and I'm not a journalist. I judged a photo like it was a meme, I never commented on who was right or wrong in the event. I just saw what I saw as smarmy and commented. As it turned out, I was wrong in my reaction. So I deleted.
@Ihate_Airplanes LOL man... if I needed a perfect example of the problem with division these days, you just provided it. Thank you.
@ADmomof3 I always enjoy people who play moral arbiter in order to decry those they see as playing moral arbiter. It's a fun exercise in witnessing intellectual dishonesty.
@hwmulholland No.
@lawgirl I didn't buy a narrative, I created my own based on a photo and personal experience. I never commented on the events themselves, just the facial expression. And upon more information I retracted my reactive narrative and will think better of such reactions in the future.
@ihate_everyone2 I saw what I perceived to be a smarmy expression I've seen before. I commented. It exploded. I read his description of events. I apologized and retracted and deleted so as not to allow his photo to gain more attention.
@ihate_everyone2 I didn't do anything of the sort. You're just making things up now. The only thing I commented on was a facial expression. I took no part in any of the things you're attributing to me. You're lying.
@ihate_everyone2 I don't agree that that's true. But I don't feel I have anything to gain by trying to convince you otherwise.
@earlp1231 I do that often about a great many subjects. But from time to time something just "hits" me and I'm so sure I've got the right view. When I end up realizing I got it wrong is what has the most impact for me.
@TheVirginQueen6 No. I will endeavor not to assume bad faith, but I don't agree that that endeavor should be limited to the "like-minded."
@TheVirginQueen6 I'm sorry but I simply disagree. I will not offer grace or good faith only to those who align with a particular political party or ideology.
@oklumberman I think my biggest issue here (or the reason I keep not doing what you‚Äôre correctly suggesting) is there‚Äôs rarely a sense within me that I have something that resembles a ‚Äúlarge audience.‚Äù But maybe i do. Or even if I don‚Äôt maybe I should simply conduct myself as though I do.
If the cost to me now for taking the path I've taken thus far and continue to walk, where I fuck up in front of you and try my best to own my mistakes is that I have no audience? No readership? No place to be seen or heard? That cost I can live with.
This is not "my way" or some great and noble wisdom that I came to on my own nor is it a testament to how "righteous" I am compared to others. I spent most of my life not offering grace and there was a cost. A cost that was not worth the satisfaction that comes with arrogance.
I will keep fucking up publicly as inadvisable as I'm told that is. And I will keep offering changes in perspective when they come, regardless of who believes them.
But I refuse to be a prisoner to my past and I refuse to allow the stunning lack of grace these days to imprison me to fear.
I don't know what I'm guilty of or not guilty of for anything I've said or done in the past that contradicts my present. Whatever those things are, I'm truly sorry.
That's pretty fucking awful if you consider the implications. Why are we so divided? Because there's basically nothing to gain from finding common ground. Evolving, changing, apologizing, empathizing, hearing others... these are treated as grounds for mistrust and shaming.
It's not "worth it" is how it can feel.
By relenting or offering a change you're seemingly destined to go from pissing off half of those in the conflict to pissing off everyone on all sides of it. This can easily cause some to retreat to the relative safety of sticking by their guns even IF they had a change of mind.
Apologies or changes in perspective certainly shouldn't be based on the hope you'll receive accolades for your change of heart, but I think everyone would be lying if they said there isn't some fear involved.  A fear that more often than not comes to fruition.
It's not much different for those whose view you may have come around to or perhaps offered an apology to.
On here (which is like the front lines of our divisions) these things are viewed differently. If you change your mind, those who you previously agreed with shame you as a capitulator. A grifter seeking to protect the "value" of your public identity.
In day to day life, and in what we teach our kids (mostly), conflict, apology, and changes in perspective tend to be seen as something that draws people closer through resolution, evolution, and humility.
This is the opposite of what most people teach their children but in our modern culture it seems to be considered wise to never believe in the sincerity of anyone or to ever engage in good faith..
Unfortunately, and everyone knows this, while there is a cost to being wrong there is often a seemingly greater cost to admitting it.
A person sees something. A person reacts to something. A person doubles down on it, certain they are right. A person gains a new perspective. 		So what do they do next?
In my personal experience, as well as what I've seen of others, there are many who process their thoughts in real time. Some are more disciplined than others (I certainly fall more into the "undisciplined category") but it's still something that happens often.
I've seen a lot of people doubting apologies these last couple of days. My own included, yes. But many others as well.

@E__Strobel @secupp Yknow, no one should ever apologize with the expectation of forgiveness.  But at the same time the lack of grace offered in the face of apology is evidence that it was not PR advice. Since apologizing is rarely met with anything other than more scorn.
Oh.
@WonkPorn I‚Äôve never gone after not have I defended anything else about this. I went after one facial expression. And have retracted my commentary on that facial expression.
@repub9989 @JHolmsted All i believed was my eyes. I never made any commentary about the larger circumstances under disputed. Only that I thought the kid was making a shitty face which was something I saw, not heard.
@FCazayoux It‚Äôs not even a matter of my opinion. They‚Äôve lauded his photo as emblematic of Trumpism and have specifically said the issue is the MGAGA hat. Obviously that‚Äôs why.
@FCazayoux I‚Äôm not avoiding it. I‚Äôm just refusing to accept your premise that my own reaction is synonymous with those who took issue explicitly because of the MAGA hat.
@FCazayoux When did I deny why he was singled out by others? I specifically asked you if you were asking about why others did or why I did. Then you said they were ‚Äúone in the same.‚Äù
@FCazayoux They‚Äôre not one in the same. It‚Äôs YOU revealing YOUR bias that you can‚Äôt conceive of a world where a person might form an opinion that isn‚Äôt tribally motivates. That‚Äôs your weakness, not mine.
@tominhawaii That is not permitted, sir.
@FCazayoux You‚Äôre asking why he was singled out by OTHERS? I thought you were asking why it bothered ME.
@erinkmorgan I think that we‚Äôll never know the inner workings of someone‚Äôs mind other than what they tell us. He‚Äôs told us and so barring other evidence I‚Äôd prefer to take him at his word over disputing it based on what my instincts initially told me.
@FCazayoux No, I‚Äôve seen a million people do the ‚Äúclose, confidant, smarmy stare-off.‚Äù So that was what I believed he was doing. He offered an explanation of what he was actually doing and I backed off after reading it. Not sure what truth you‚Äôre hoping to discover here.
@mavs111624 My only real commentary ever was on the facial expression of this one kid. His position that he was in fact unsure of how to react seemed just as reasonable as the darker explanation.
@FCazayoux Because he appeared to be doing something I‚Äôve seen a million times. But enjoy your quest to discover a non-existent predisposition.

@dianitahardy Sounded reasonable to me. I‚Äôm not commenting on the whole event just whether or not this one kids face was as worthy of judgment as appeared. His expression read one way to me and he explained it as being another. Nothing I saw disputes what he said. I‚Äôm fine taking his word.

@USA_First_2016 @E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr I agree that bias is pervasive and a problem. And it comes in many forms and even in covering topics less important. But if I wait till bias is ‚Äúgone‚Äù to share some stories I‚Äôll really just be contributing to the problem.
@JHWalz32 It‚Äôs just an issue of time and word count. Eventually you need to just be done or it‚Äôll never publish but the news cycle constantly adds new relevant material.
@USA_First_2016 @E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr Well first of all I‚Äôm not a journalist. But secondly, who said bias isn‚Äôt important to me? It is. But while some stories may show bias by elevating false narratives, others stand alone and are relevant even in spite of the coverage imbalance.
@USA_First_2016 @E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr I can and should expect for fair people who purport to be against bias to not ignore stories out of spite. This is an issue of Christian ethics at a Christian university, not of illegality. They aren‚Äôt comparable and both are worth knowing.
@JHWalz32 No, the point is that new events often become even better representations of what I‚Äôm writing about. So if for instance you were writing about crime and saying it will go up and when you started it was lower, the fact that it has climbed since you started writing is relevant.
@USA_First_2016 @E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr It seemed as though you were asking me why it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to ME. If not, I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. I can‚Äôt be responsible for those who choose to exhibit bias in their reporting. I just tweet what is relevant and interesting to me. My bias is to myself.
@USA_First_2016 @E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr Of course it‚Äôs a big deal. I‚Äôm confused as to why that being a big deal means this can‚Äôt be discussed. You don‚Äôt create balance by ignoring things because other things were ignored.
@Norsk24 Yeah it can be tedious to try to avoid that designation. And I‚Äôve seen people that are definitely actually humble-bragging. But in the end writing a book is just another job. It‚Äôs not as though it‚Äôs inherently a ‚Äúrich and famous‚Äù opportunity. Tons and tons of obscure writers.
@E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr But their hypocrisy won‚Äôt change the facts of whatever scoop it is. So while I may also address their hypocrisy I tend to do it separately while making sure my own news feed represents the balance I think is healthier.
@E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr I don‚Äôt deny at all bias in media. I see it all the time. I just try to separate them as two different stories. Like Slate (just as an example)  could theoretically have a real scoop worthy of attention even if they‚Äôre hypocrites.
I know it‚Äôs considered humble-braggy to talk about difficult aspects of a professional opportunity like being published, but i have to say the hardest part of writing a non-fiction book has consistently been the news cycle changing and making me go ‚Äúshit. I need to start over.‚Äù
@E__Strobel @reporterporter @LibertyU @JerryFalwellJr Also, in terms of me at least (can‚Äôt speak for the reporter) i also retweeted this just moments before i retweeted that. So while i can‚Äôt speak for the reporters i do try to stay balanced. https://t.co/2NspOhNn75
