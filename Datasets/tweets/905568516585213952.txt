Open invitation to the R‚Äôs on the House Committee - Feel free to start asking substantive questions any time now. This is getting ridiculous.
@NBCNews So he‚Äôs a ‚Äúconservative activist‚Äù for committing fraud, creating/spreading false sexual assault allegations to smear the lead of an ongoing federal investation, and promoting misinformation to manipulate our elections?  How is this not just straight up cyberterrorism?
@Mimirocah1 What about the threats previously made by Trump &amp; Giuliani, and Cohen‚Äôs own statement about his concerns for the safety of his family? Would those be permissible for consideration in terms of establishing the intent?
@RonaldKlain @mattgaetz I dunno, I‚Äôd like to see him mix it up a little.

@Nats_Baseball Don‚Äôt forget they also already had Trumbo and Trey Mancini at the time. If you think about it, aren‚Äôt the Orioles always negotiating against themselves? At this point I‚Äôm surprised we never figured out a way to take over Bobby Bonilla‚Äôs remaining payments
@Nats_Baseball I almost forgot, of course Boras is Chris Davis‚Äô agent as well
@ShimonPro So the White House thinks that Cohen looks enviously at Paul Manafort, who‚Äôs about to get an even longer sentence that will likely span the rest of his life due to lying, and thinks to himself ‚Äúwhat can I do to willfully add even more years to my own sentence like him?‚Äù

@WalshFreedom Or they could at the very least subpoena Mark Judge.
@WalshFreedom I‚Äôm curious what Kavanaugh doing ‚Äúreally well‚Äù would look like.

@rga0101 @DepSecHargan @SecAzar But hey now that you mention it, once most of the repercussions from decimating the ACA risk pool are sorted out maybe we could save a little bit of social security? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love carrying regular folks on my back just as much as the next taxpayer, but think it over?
@rga0101 @DepSecHargan @SecAzar Im not saying ACA was perfect, and it def still needed work, but it was stabilizing &amp; ultimately helped 10s of millions of ppl. If you want to save $ short-term, fine - but let‚Äôs not pretend this is some new &amp; improved alternative system when data &amp; evidence suggest otherwise
@rga0101 @DepSecHargan @SecAzar ..then we would be looking at a proposal from @SecAzar which laid out steps to help eliminate the astronomical levels of waste, fraud, &amp; in efficiency within our healthcare system rather than simply trying to exploit &amp; sabotage our current framework w/the other guy‚Äôs name on it
@rga0101 @DepSecHargan @SecAzar Btw, for what it‚Äôs worth-	1. Yes, I‚Äôm on my employer‚Äôs plan	2. Yes, I actually do know exactly what it costs my employer to ‚Äúcarry me on their back‚Äù by contributing towards my premium. I‚Äôm a benefits consultant; that is literally my job. 	3. If cost is really the main concern...
@rga0101 @DepSecHargan @SecAzar Thats a very narrow &amp; short-sighted view. Glad your health isnt an issue- it may take longer to hit your wallet, but incentivizing adverse selection like this will cause harm beyond just the 52M(27%) Americans w/pre-ex who can‚Äôt get STLD plans. That, Richard, is a swamp creature.

@RBReich I feel very similarly about this, but just to clarify - this was for an additional $250M on top of the existing $380M, which I don‚Äôt believe has yet been exhausted, correct? So at least it‚Äôs not a total unwillingness to invest resources, but still... clearly much more is needed

@BillOReilly Frankly, it is her job, as he‚Äôs created this ‚Äúfake news‚Äù narrative &amp; made it difficult for press/public to get accurate &amp; reliable info.

@DepSecHargan @SecAzar Nothing about these plans will lead to providing ‚Äúbetter‚Äù coverage, or even more affordable coverage in the long run
@sangerkatz These plans are really a disservice to everyone, offering lesser coverage &amp; hindering our ability to improve the health of the population while seemingly attempting to sabotage regs that had at least successfully resulted in coverage for~20M more ppl
@sangerkatz In other words, the sick ppl who rely on ACA‚Äôs pre-ex protections &amp; other EHB‚Äôs will stay out of necessity, while healthy ppl may choose to drop or pick up a short-term plan for lower cost, causing ACA rates to skyrocket as we‚Äôve already started to see
@sangerkatz The important thing is that w/ACA, these STP‚Äôs were worst-case temp options &amp; not meant to be viable for long-term, w/mandate penalty &amp; short lifecycle making them unattractive vs ACA plans
@sangerkatz You‚Äôre right, good catch (I work primarily w/group plans, so individual market is not my expertise). Short-term plans don‚Äôt meet ACA health insurance definitions, so scratch the part re: the penalty - main point was to offer a temp option to those outside their eligibility window
@sangerkatz Also, usually there‚Äôs got to be some type of qualifying event (birth, marriage, etc) that causes loss of coverage to trigger most special enrollment periods. Continuously not having coverage, then deciding you need it later after open enrollment has passed usually doesn‚Äôt qualify
@sangerkatz Not everyone remembers/understands what to do or that they need to take action within the timeframe and end up missing their opportunity
@sangerkatz *Not a staffer* but it was basically to make sure ppl who got stuck w/o coverage could at least find a temp option to get by until the next annual open enrollment period &amp; to avoid the tax penalty which kicked in for going 4+ months w/o health insurance
@SecAzar At least other cabinet members have had the excuse of lacking meaningful industry experience relating to their departments. You, on the other hand, know exactly how misleading these statements are and have now inexplicably trashed your credibility. Why?

@thehill The article says it was nearly $40k, not $400k. It also mentions he donated to Hillary‚Äôs campaign (albeit a lesser amount, but that‚Äôs his prerogative).  Come on, you guys are better than this and it‚Äôs so important for media outlets to firmly establish their credibility right now.
@RepRaskin Will somebody please help me understand what I‚Äôm missing here? Can anyone make a logical argument  in support of the idea that the overall best interests of the American people are somehow adequately represented, or, frankly, even being considered by this administration?
@RepRaskin And if that IS the case, then what... Republicans in Congress are simply doing anything they might be able to get away with in order to make it harder for us to prevent this from happening again since they were the ones who benefited this time?
@RepRaskin If worst case was collusion, what‚Äôs best case? That the administration was too incompetent to recognize, combat, or prevent something like this from occurring in the 1st place? And that no collusion coincidently resulted in Russia‚Äôs desired outcome anyway? How/why is that better?
@RepRaskin Why is he ONLY concerned with how anything relates to his possible collusion? With the probe ongoing, even if we don‚Äôt have evidence incriminating Trump (yet), we do ALREADY have, at a MINIMUM, clear proof that RUSSIA IS OPENLY &amp; ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN CYBER WARFARE AGAINST US
