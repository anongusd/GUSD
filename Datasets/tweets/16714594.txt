@MrDane1982 Last, I think of the groups I mentioned black women and white women tend to have the most respect for each other. At the same time, working-class black men and white men are either totally cool or horrible. Interesting contrast.
@MrDane1982 Also, white women get pat on the ass "Atta girl" and black women tend to be ignored and dismissed intellectually-unless they are way older then suddenly they are wise. These stereotypes seem to be from both white and black males. It makes no sense, but that is my observation.
@MrDane1982 Oh. But I do think if there is a scale of privileged, white women like me and more so normal white women have a different set of challenges, point blank. Different for example; white women are "angelic" to be owned and manipulated, black women are "strong"- they can take abuse.

@mgranville1 Well, here's the thing, if you give to charities you don't pay the full amount of taxes which underfunds social programs that our government decides on. So from the perspective of having the government fund the overall good. I get why they would ideologically steer from this way.

@18Blond @SaiMuss @ATM_Repairman @johncusack @KamalaHarris It is good criticism to say her website needs work. I rely on her performance and responses we see day to day, but I'm sure her platform could use definition.
@18Blond @SaiMuss @ATM_Repairman @johncusack @KamalaHarris I should note that I am totally inspired by @AOC she is the future IMO. She has the true grit to claim and demand change! So, that is exciting, but young :)
@18Blond @SaiMuss @ATM_Repairman @johncusack @KamalaHarris Yes, but the root problem with Socialist experiments is that eventually (or initially) the leaders become the Oligarchs of tomorrow. To set a precedent that backs up their argument about wealth inequality is very important. I just don't see much true effort to change.

@Kikasitsu @ellenbethgill @4everNeverTrump His father was arrested at a Klan rally, not sure if he was wearing a hat/hood or anything...Trump never had to look at himself, to rework himself. The good thing is that people are having to face themselves more now than ever. If we get real, we really can't hate each other.
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump Absolutely! I couldn't agree more that as white people we carry the responsibility to reset the standards. It's so entwined in our society that it remains a large task. Beginning with our kids is an obvious start, our neighbors kids...getting there. Real action grassroots thing!

@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump I mean, you do have to look at the individual, not just his race. Are there mental health issues? Is he being abused, does he have a record...maybe I'm misunderstanding the question???
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump I never said he should be left off the hook, in fact I think he(they all) should have to do community service-best if Mr. Phillips could direct that. At what age is a whole different important topic. The Juvenile Justice System is horrible, I just don't have an answer for that.
@Finajack @4everNeverTrump I did not say that *cough* read the many other comments below *cough*
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump At 17, I understand the odds aren't good, but who are we if we lose all hope?
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump I would agree with you, totally, but I feel in this case his age is important to consider. Yes, his mother-deserves Hell. Any adult that led him to believe this was ok-fuck them! BUT....he should be given the opportunity to learn and hopefully he will grow up to be a good person!
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump Sure, but I don't tolerate it. We have to bank on teaching moments to evolve, not condemn a kids of any race for not being born and raised perfect. Come on now.
@mikeestee @4everNeverTrump No. I am a mother of three white boys and they are held responsible for their actions, so I don't agree with you characterizing me as one of "those" people. Horror begins when people are grouped, haven't we learned that from our own history of doing that to others?

@4everNeverTrump Hatred is at the core of this incident. How would it help to pile on more hate? To encourage bullying and sentencing without due process? We are better than this.
@SafiyahNoor1 @4everNeverTrump An investigation collects all of the data and I agree they should be prosecuted. What level? IDK, I think Mr. Phillips might have some great ideas on how they could redeem themselves?
@Rancidsmallbus @NancyMaloney55 @4everNeverTrump Absolutely qualified lol, your cynicism is refreshing...i think...no, just funny.
@gkgguy @4everNeverTrump Yea, I read those statements, she's an idiot. I also saw a former student talk about his awful experience at the school when he came out as gay. There's definitely a lot that should be done with this, but generalizations won't get us there.
@yoyo_yelena @4everNeverTrump He is allowed to explain his perspective and the details are good to know from their perspective. How can we have a balanced system if we aren't able to look at all of the statements? We are better than this. I would expect this kind of hate and ignorance from MAGAts, not allies!
@catmaybeangry @liberalgirl3 @4everNeverTrump I was referring to the comment about Hitler Youth, not this kid.
@NancyMaloney55 @4everNeverTrump Of course he is old enough to be held accountable, the investigation will get a clearer picture on what would be appropriate action.
@SafiyahNoor1 @4everNeverTrump I agree, let's get the facts and the kids could be given some community service to reenforce what they should have learned about their awful behavior.
@liberalgirl3 @4everNeverTrump And the child soldiers of other areas of the world? I find it devastatingly sad when children are forced to be soldiers.
@ellenbethgill @4everNeverTrump So are the child soldiers in Sudan.
@ehnottooxabi @4everNeverTrump I understand that, I am just full of hope that the whole experience widened their scope. I have a son his age, have an older son, a younger son and daughter. They screw up-not like this, but other crazy things, how are we going to teach tolerance if we can't be forgiving?

@jaketapper Are we any better if we just hate these kids?
@jaketapper Watching the longer video, I feel like the kids just got a really extraordinary opportunity to evolve thanks to Mr. Phillips &amp; media response. I think this letter, whoever wrote it, reflects a growing process that we should ALL appreciate. Hate is taught, they just got re-taught.

@WearStreeter @KRactivist82 @senjudiciary The nonsense of expecting one party to always win unchecked is the sort of fake Democracy that Putin has manipulated. His party rules their Legislation and Hovernors. His strong opponents end up dead or devalued.
@WearStreeter @KRactivist82 @senjudiciary I mean, I see that they all entered politics for good reasons. The variety of ideology is so important to Democracy. A healthy Democracy argues, it‚Äôs how we get to the compromises that best represents our people.
@WearStreeter @KRactivist82 @senjudiciary I believe they did not want to be forced to bring this up because they know that the documents they asked for contain damaging evidence of other sorts. That makes more sense if you believe that ALL of our reps are essentially decent people. Of which, I do as a Patriot.

@girlbeatlesfan @WearStreeter @senjudiciary I always vote. I'm very active in getting others involved and registered. Regardless of differences :)
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI There is enough evidence to open an investigation into all of the accusations, thinking ahead. They have the ability to do a proper investigation. Only then will he stop suffering. With so much to disprove, why wouldn't he want to properly clear his name?
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI They should be interviewed by the same committee under the same pressure, if not the FBI. That would at least give some common ground rules.
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI This is why you hear about "triggering" which is now laughed at, truly horrible experience when rushed with details out-of-nowhere. For an unknown reason, clarity on events we remember get dislodged, even 37 years later. Look at the older people remembering abuse in churches late
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI Her testimony is textbook truth for memories of trauma. The brain is incredible in keeping survival the prime directive. As told from professionals who have worked with me and my own research in and outside of college, it points to pushing details out to protect the psyche
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI It would have destroyed her reputation at that time and her age if she came forward. In 1982? They would have called her a cry-baby whore or something. Things are better now, but it needs to get even better for true justice!
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI That is so awful. I'm glad you pressed for details. It is so difficult for young people to speak in details because the first feeling tends to be feeling totally dirty and forever tainted.
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI Many times from the time I was 8 years old until I was 14. I reported these when I was 17 in 1992. I am sorry to hear about your daughter. Yes, that was wrong, but it gives me a bird's eye view on a culture that would allow this kind of injustice.
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI The assaults happened from 8-14 years old. I reported it when I was 17.
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI Teacher, counselor, District Attorney who told me they would not continue because the perpetrator was mentally unfit and could not be charged.
@tmscool @WearStreeter @senjudiciary @FBI Yes, I can believe. As my three sons know, and one daughter know, allegations like this deserve to be investigated for all the people involved. This is also about trusting that the search for the truth is a value that is above partisanship and feelings. Execution of due process!
@senjudiciary "A Local Guy?" What,a local drunk frat guy? A local pimp?
@WearStreeter @tmscool @senjudiciary No, that is a terrible assumption. There has been no proper investigation, so how can you say these allegations are false? I am a survivor and no matter who the person coming forward is-they should be believed until due diligence has proven otherwise! Your accusation is the slap!
@senjudiciary I just vomited in my mouth reading this crap.

@WearStreeter @senjudiciary Also, I am not a registered Democrat or Republican. I have respect for both parties on varying history and ideology. The US should be represented by more than one agenda. One-party systems lead to authoritarianism. Plainly, we all need to pull our heads out of our egos!
@WearStreeter @senjudiciary No evidence because it was not an investigation to determine guilt. It was not investigated by professionals. Partisanship aside, please understand that this is not how an allegation should ever be handled. Skip the investigation and go right to a public hearing?

As a survivor, the assault tends to be seared in memory, but the details about time and space are like plumes of smoke. This is actually part of how the mind tries to remove the event, disassociation. #KavanaughHearings
I am already teared-up for her, my heart is breaking! This is horrible! #IBelieveDrFord #KavanaughHearings

It was taught, be lady-like and that meant understand that men can't control their urges and if you get "caught" just be polite and keep it to yourself. You wouldn't want to ruin a man's reputation. You don't want to be "that complaining girl." #KavanaughHearings
Truly, even women believed that victims of assault had to have "wanted" the attention. That they were manipulative, unworthy, and devious sluts. We judged other teen-aged girls! It was too socially damaging to stand up. Girls were to expect men to be "grabby" #KavanaughHearings
The embarrassment is no joke, particularly in the 1980's and 90's. We were just drunk whores in the minds of men and the authorities. Just trash. Young women need to know that this was normal and how dare YOU judge the time it took to come forward!  #KavanaughHearings  @GOP

@RealCandaceO Is she talking about abortion, spontaneous abortion(miscarriages) and infant mortality rate? She needs to cite her sources and explain.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite Did you not read his tweet? Son=Under the bus!
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite There are still reports of abuse at child detention centers and in any historical system overseeing childcare. The vetting process of these employees has needed improvement forever.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite The more proper math and logic is to see that excusing questionable behavior(the arrival of children without parents at the border) by promoting intentional atrocious behavior (separation of parents and children at the border based on a loophole) could never be equal.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite He did not buy Mar-a-Lago as a gesture of kindness, that is laughable. Next you will tell me he's a humanitarian for hiring migrant workers as groundskeepers!
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite No, I read a lot of media and when there are opportunities, I prefer primary sources and peer-approved journals.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite Registering as a foreign agent is not merely misfiling paperwork. It is foot in the door to illegally gain access for nefarious reasons. There is no other reason a professional agent would risk the heavy jail sentence.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite Are these any indication of the character of the person who you place your faith in? Has any other president had so many people as confidantes prosecuted for these high crimes?
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite I'm sorry; Conspiracy to Defraud the USA, Not Registering as a Foreign Agent, Tax Fraud, Money Laundering, Tax Evasion, Misuse of Campaign Financing, Tax Sheltering, Organized Crime, and more!
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite Rightfully, he was breaking some very fundamental rules that can only come from the most heinous minds. The first laws of our humanity is to see what is plainly in front of us. A baby torn from her mother, even cavemen could empathize with just as elephants mourn their dead.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite The Constitution and the Geneva Convention of 1948 are very clear on protecting people who are not citizens but are within our boundaries. You can't just blame a loophole for crimes against humanity conducted by this administration. Jeff Sessions was nearly held in contempt today
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite Are you a glutton for punishment? He threw his own son under the bus, do you think that he wouldn't do the same to any of us? Are you ok with him fueling a hatred to half of its citizens who have Liberal view points? This is not freedom the Constitution guarantees its citizens.
@INDEPENDENTBRAD @Mediaite ...for one moment look at what has happened, all of the indictments, all of his shady deals, all of his pandering to Putin? How can you not see this blatant collusion? How can you not see the conspiracy against the USA? These are real jailed people that are people you trusted?!

@Claudia36110375 @hieronymus_burp @dpjmurphy96 @MrDane1982 @ChaosRiot1999 Idealism has been the most vital foundation for all of the changes we have ever made.

@Claudia36110375 @dpjmurphy96 @MrDane1982 @ChaosRiot1999 Third Party voters voted according to their beliefs. It's not a noble stance, it is right! If the Democratic party could not get a majority its a reflection on how they are turning people off. This discussion is a HUGE turn off. Shaming people into voting your way is bad news!

@DMHenderson23 @riley_ronan @adamcbest Hell, at this point I would risk a lower corporate tax and less bank regulations in a deal that could stop Trump in his tracks! Even these for the postponement of the Supreme Court nomination would be worth reigning in Global Terrorist no. 1 Trump!
@DMHenderson23 @riley_ronan @adamcbest To be fair, Obama is not taking on any more new blame right now lol. I do agree that Dems are not acting as brave and as bold as they should. This president should have been AT LEAST censured by now! They will take very little action on that issue which puts them at odds too.
@DMHenderson23 @riley_ronan @adamcbest Republicans controlled Congress. The President does not write the laws, Obama over reached his powers reluctantly to address all of that, but legally he could not do much. That's why we see everything reversed so quickly now.
@AngelinaWalks @JoseyRider @riley_ronan @adamcbest I'm not trolling for Republican support, I am trying to point out that this Dems vs. Reps. crap is going no where. Even if the Dems take back Congress, it will be houses divided in half. Talk about stubborn! In the case of both major parties, both parties have let us down.
@AngelinaWalks @JoseyRider @riley_ronan @adamcbest No, I think that Dems need to recognize that if they want to absorb other parties, then they need to compromise. You have to see that they have every right to maintain their party's autonomy, but that there are key issues that can be agreed on among all parties.
@RandPaul "Pony up!" https://t.co/kRj2WbmAMf
@DMHenderson23 @riley_ronan @adamcbest Prosecuting bankers? I know many Mortgage lenders that got sued and removed. Shady investors were also sued, Trump is a bigot. Obama is not. If can't absorb that, you are stupid. Plain as day.
@DMHenderson23 @riley_ronan @adamcbest I would like to see the data on Obama and wealth inequality considering his recent speeches promoting ways to decrease its effects. He has been a strong voice for passing the DREAM act, obviously you are spreading misinformation. He followed GW Bush's bailouts as it was passed.
@RandPaul You made a very poor choice. They are a hostile power. They are being sanctioned because our representatives know that they will continue. You went behind their backs, you should be removed from office. I would say you should be exiled as well!
@FreitfartNews It won't end Trumpism, but Trumpism won't really end by removing him or Republicans. Obviously this is a deeper issue and there are people who just can't get behind either 'corporate' party without serious changes. If we win 51%-49% there is still half of America seriously upset!

@natepfinneran @RKJ65 @GOP @Troy_Balderson Dependency on the government is a slippery slope. I have never met a person who wants to depend on such, still, there are things we can't always control.

@natepfinneran @RKJ65 @GOP @Troy_Balderson A true underdog, someone who has legitimately fought against the odds only has merit when the end product is an advance for all of us.

@natepfinneran @RKJ65 @GOP @Troy_Balderson Tearing POS-POTUS down? You really believe he is an underdog? His underdog-like antics have ALWAYS been manipulation, bullying, and cowering to bigger bullies. His whole life is based on stepping on and over others.

@Taniasalwei @WhiteIsCrime @FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton Yes, you are one of them! What you are not putting into the equation is that they spread LIES! Republicans believed and repeated the lies. The LIES that were paid for set off this the deeper divide. Did you see the t-shirts "I'd rather be Russian than a Democrat?"
@WhiteIsCrime @FoxNews @AmbJohnBolton This is NOT about us. Your whataboutisms won't work. This is an attack on our country!? Are you a patriot or complicit?

@GOP @realDonaldTrump just admitted to conspiring against our country. This is more important than your weird obsession with getting this dip shit on the Supreme Court! For ONCE, please act like the American Government and not complicit Russian sympathizers!
@MarkSimoneNY Trump just admitted to conspiring against the USA. If you have any integrity you would start telling the truth about that. Also, only people who support tyranny would attack the free press. Americans understand the importance. You are nothing.

@gop4pr @StateDept @USAID You are going to have to pause and reflect on how the POS POTUS just admitted to attempting to conspire with Russia in the 2016 Election. I can't believe he is not getting arrested right now. What does this say about any of you complicit shit bags?
@foxandfriends @GovMikeHuckabee I am just astonished that this is happening in my country! Trump just admitted collusion and you have this fucking douche bag on here shitting out of his mouth. What the fuck is wrong with you @FoxNews ?
@FoxNews @RepSwalwell @POTUS I just can't believe that all you have reported on this morning was bullshit compared to what Trump just admitted on Twitter. He's  a fucking traitor! End of story. Anyone who is on his train is also a traitor! SO done!
@TradingPennies @FoxNews @CoryBooker @POTUS You should be a realist! A realist would realize that he is a treasonous bastard only out to gain for himself and his rich, corrupt, murderous comrades. A realist would realize that his bigotry only serves a disgusting portion of this country!
