@RANDCorporation Members from both parties should join to reject #HartzlerAmd and not undermine readiness of our military #NDAA18 (12/12)
@RANDCorporation #Pentagon should be able to handle their personnel, not have #Congress micromanage doctor/patient relationships #NDAA18 #HartzlerAmd (11/12)
@RANDCorporation #NDAA18 should be about how best to keep our country safe, not radical conservative social agenda #HartzlerAmd (10/12)
FACT: Pentagon commissioned @RANDCorporation study which found cost of #trans healthcare is negligible #correcttherecord #NDAA18 (9/12)
Supporters of #HartzlerAmd wildly exaggerate costs w/ no citation to any study or #facts to back up their bizarre cost claims #ndaa18 (8/12)
...so trans soldiers would need to decide b/t serving their country and healthcare doctors say is medically necessary #ndaa18 (7/12)
#HartzlerAmd also effectively bans #transservice, all military can ONLY use military healthcare...#ndaa18 (6/12)
Fed law gives all service members right to medically necessary health care. #HartzlerAmd changes that JUST for #trans troops #NDAA18 (5/12)
Which means #HartzlerAmd UNIQUELY puts #trans soldiers under a different set of rules #discrimination #NDAA18 (4/12)
So birth control, hormone replacement for any other conditions: 100% allowed under #HartzlerAmd UNLESS you're #trans #NDAA18 (3/12)
#HartzlerAmd uniquely strips healthcare from #trans soldiers. Cis soldiers can still get hormone replacement or other care #ndaa18 (2/12)
We need to correct some of #misinformation (fake news?) about the anti-#transgender #HartzlerAmd to #ndaa18 (1/12)
