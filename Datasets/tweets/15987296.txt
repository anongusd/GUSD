Congress should pass the Combating BDS Act as quickly as possible. Contact your senators here: https://t.co/fUQXSRTBT0
In fact, the Combating BDS Act mirrors a provision within current federal law‚Äîthe Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA)‚Äîwhich clarifies that state governments may divest from companies invested in Iran‚Äôs energy sector. (5/5)
The Combating BDS Act is not the first instance in which the federal government has acknowledged a state‚Äôs inherent powers to divest from companies acting contrary to legislative policy. (4/5)
Likewise, U.S. courts have long held that the government, as an employer, exercises wide discretion and control over those who contract with it and may limit the activities of those contractors in the interest of achieving the government‚Äôs goals. (3/5)
The converse is also true‚Äîa state government may choose not to fund or subsidize activities of companies whose actions are at variance with state law or policy. (2/5)
#FactsMatter: The Supreme Court has held that state governments may exercise their discretion in selectively funding programs, without running afoul of the Constitution. (1/5)

Such contractors can refuse to buy Israeli goods or do business with Israel in their private capacity, so long as they do not discriminate against or limit commercial relations with Israel or persons doing business in Israel while in their professional capacity. (2/3)

#FACT: The Combating BDS Act has strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress. The Senate should pass this bill without delay. Read more facts here: https://t.co/mf83zvlaAe
#FACT: Court rulings against state anti-BDS laws on First Amendment grounds have no relevance to the Combating BDS Act, since the bill only covers issues of federal jurisdiction. #FactsMatter
#FACT: U.S. courts have long recognized that states can selectively fund (or not fund) programs that promote or diverge from state policy. Congress has acknowledged this right in the past. #FactsMatter
#FACT: This bill does not ‚Äúencourage‚Äù states to pass anti-BDS laws. It only acknowledges that states ‚Äúmay‚Äù adopt such laws if they so choose.		Sec. 402(a): ‚Äúa State or local government may adopt and enforce [these] measures.‚Äù #FactsMatter
#FACT: The bill in no way impedes the rights of individuals to boycott Israel. It does not even address state actions against individuals. The bill only covers commercial activity by companies, which states have the authority to regulate. #FactsMatter
#FACT: The bill affirms an individual‚Äôs right to free speech and does not infringe on the First Amendment.		Sec. 405: ‚ÄúNothing in this title shall be construed to infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.‚Äù #FactsMatter

In the Senate, a bipartisan resolution in solidarity with the Iranian people has been introduced by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman @SenBobCorker (R-TN) &amp; Ranking Member @SenatorCardin (D-MD).		We encourage passage of this important resolution.  #IranProtests
The resolution was introduced by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman @RepEdRoyce (R-CA) &amp; Ranking Member @RepEliotEngel (D-NY). @HouseForeign @HFACDemocrats  #IranProtests
Importantly, the resolution urges the admin. to use targeted sanctions to address the Iranian regime‚Äôs human rights violations. It also calls for the U.S. to facilitate technological support to the Iranian people, who are being actively censored and repressed by their leaders.
The resolution also ‚Äúcondemns the Iranian regime‚Äôs serious human rights abuses against the Iranian people, significant corruption and destabilizing activities abroad.‚Äù  #IranProtests
Noting that #Iran's citizens have voiced economic grievances and protested the regime‚Äôs regional aggression, the resolution expresses solidarity ‚Äúwith the people of Iran that are engaged in legitimate and peaceful protests against an oppressive, corrupt regime.‚Äù  #IranProtests
We applaud the House of Representatives for overwhelmingly adopting a #bipartisan resolution (H.Res.676) supporting the Iranian people‚Äôs rights to free expression and condemning the Iranian regime‚Äôs crackdown on legitimate protests. https://t.co/E2P2NAHFWC  #IranProtests https://t.co/1SxAedDLmq

@POTUS Today's action by @POTUS is an important, historic step for which we are grateful. We urge the president to quickly relocate our embassy to Israel's capital.
@POTUS When the United States ultimately relocates its embassy to #Jerusalem, it will treat Israel as it does every other country with which we have diplomatic relations.
@POTUS The Jewish people have maintained a constant presence in #Jerusalem, their holiest city, for more than 3,000 years.		Israel declared the city its capital following its reestablishment in 1948.
@POTUS This announcement acknowledges that #Jerusalem will continue to be Israel‚Äôs capital as part of any conceivable final status agreement between #Israel and the #Palestinians.
@POTUS Relocating the embassy to #Jerusalem does not in any way prejudge the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian #peace process, to include establishing two states for two peoples and resolving Palestinian claims to the eastern portion of the city and the disposition of holy places.
@POTUS AIPAC strongly supported passage of that act, which Congress overwhelmingly adopted on a #bipartisan basis.
@POTUS This recognition is a long-overdue step to implement U.S. law.		The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 declared that Jerusalem "should remain an undivided city," and "the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem." https://t.co/kf30UovJxl
AIPAC has always supported American recognition of #Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs undivided capital city, and we commend @POTUS' momentous announcement and decision to initiate relocating the U.S. embassy there.

Our statement on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee adopting the Taylor Force Act w/ strong bipartisan support ‚Üí https://t.co/Pn7BiuiOhE https://t.co/osAECV1vte
BREAKING: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee (16-5) passes the Taylor Force Act. Bill to penalize PA payments to terrorists advances.
...Stop these payments to terrorists and their families or your assistance will be cut.
We hope the SFRC markup will produce a strong, #bipartisan bill that will send a clear message to the Palestinian Authority...
...if the U.S. government can certify that the PA is taking credible steps to end violence against Israelis and Americans.
The Taylor Force Act does not affect U.S. funding for security cooperation, nor does it cut humanitarian programs...
...However, this important step has not yet put an end to Palestinian incitement, necessitating the increased pressure provided by S.1697.
Congress has previously acted to reduce assistance to the PA by the total amount of payments it makes to terrorists and their families...
These payments reward terrorism and set back the cause of peace.
The bill will eliminate assistance that directly benefits the PA unless it ends abhorrent payments to terrorists and their families.
This legislation is named in honor of Taylor Force, a U.S. Army veteran killed by a Palestinian in a March 2016 stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to consider the Taylor Force Act (S.1697) tomorrow. We urge members to vote yes.
