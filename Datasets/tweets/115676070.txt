Thank you to everyone who came out yesterday and showed your support. I will continue to work hard on your behalf, and on behalf of everyone in the Seventh District.
It's been my great honor to represent the 7th. The district deserves a tough, independent voice that will always work cooperatively to make life for folks in Western Minnesota better. That's what I've always done and I hope you'll vote for me today to keep doing it.

As too many on the Left and Right move further into their partisan corners, I'm proud to work from the middle to save taxpayer money, cut regulation and return common sense to D.C. It means choosing Minnesota over messaging and I'll keep doing it every day as your congressman.
As a founder of the conservative Blue Dogs, I know how important it is to be careful with taxpayer money. The answer is smaller, smarter government, and I've spent my career designing efficient, fiscally responsible programs that deliver for Minnesotans.		https://t.co/Sv70o7nt6r
FSA has announced that nearly 1000 farmers awaiting changes will get their CRP payments. It's an example of the importance of having a representative who understands farming. USDA and I work great together and I'm happy Minn. FSA responded so quickly.		https://t.co/o2JXFAkpoE

From building Arctic Cats in TRF to expanding access to state forests, outdoor recreation is an economic powerhouse. It creates 140,000 jobs, $4.5 billion in wages and $17 billion in revenue for Minnesota. As a proud sportsman, I'll work to grow this thriving part of our economy. https://t.co/kfiK3KztOy

The 7th doesn't want a rubber stamp, or an obstructionist. I don't vote for D or R priorities; I vote for Minnesota priorities. I vote with President Trump 67% of the time--more than I voted with President Obama. If it benefits the 7th, I'm listening, and I'll work with anyone.

Healthcare is among the most important issues to the 7th District, and it's something that I'm committed to fighting for every day in Washington. I've co-sponsored more than 30 bipartisan bills signed into law by four different presidents to protect healthcare for Minnesotans.
