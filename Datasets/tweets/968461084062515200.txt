A million more things jumbled up in my mind screaming there's something wrong there's something wrong there's something wrong!
There's something wrong when we as fellow citizens can no longer speak to one another with respect. When we can brutally criticize children speaking out against gun violence. There's something wrong.
There's something wrong when the one who sits in the Oval Office is an unindicted co-conspirator and yet he's passing laws acquainting lifelong judges and God only knows what else. There's something wrong.
There's something wrong when children are being murdered while sitting in the classrooms of our schools and yet what's most important are holding on to our guns. There's something wrong.
There's something wrong when kneeling during the national anthem is viewed as a more important issue than the lives being lost for whom they are kneeling. There's something wrong.
There's something wrong. When nearly 3,000 of our fellow citizens have died right before our eyes and nothing is being done there's something wrong.
@fred_guttenberg My heart feels a heaviness reading this. You &amp; your family have been permanently scorned in a way that can never be undone, yet you move forward with dignity &amp; truth trying to make a difference in the midst of hatred. You honor your daughter and brother everyday. üíû
