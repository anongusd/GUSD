#KingvBurwell 4) It now falls to Congress to clean up the mess.

There is some opposition in the Senate to the inclusion of the legislation in the NDAA, I am hopeful the support exists for final passage
Which is more than can be said for hundreds of bills passed by the House.
While their inclusion in the NDAA is not my preference, I am pleased that the Senate has found time to take up these worthy bills
With each of the provisions, in one form or another, passing out of committee and the full House two or more times
In the House, I’m confident that we’ve exhausted regular order for these Nevada bills
