@krassenstein Those are not the only 2 options!
@krassenstein Hidden camera for what? You will be disappointed! Trump will not be impeached! He may even win reelection. Some of the things Cohen said cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt. In any case, the POTUS base will only see it as a witch hunt, and that might even rally his base.
@krassenstein Wrong! Trump will not be impeached! The goal is to impeach Trump.
@funder So what?
@JohnBrennan Spy Chiefs usually do not make comments about POTUS when they leave office, but this guy is different - irresponsible!
@HillReporter She should be celebrating he even kissed her!
@realDonaldTrump Was @realDonaldTrump responsible for him cancer? So only he has the right to insult people? Doesn't he know he was sick? Give POTUS a break! This hatred won't get you anywhere! You are not looking for what POTUS did right! You look for every avenue to criticize him!
@krassenstein Those on the left will be saying that he is telling the truth and should be believed.
@krassenstein MC is not a credible witness. Mueller has already caught him lying.
@krassenstein What will those on the left be saying?
@EarlSimpsonII @krassenstein Very possible! To teach US a lesson! The liberals were deviating from his natural purpose, so he shocked them by bringing someone who doesn't care about political correctness! That's the whole idea of this anti-trump hatred! They are crying all over the place, using their media!
@StewartGatz @krassenstein You cannot hold @realDonaldTrump accountable for what he did as a business man. He is now POTUS, and has immunity. You have to wait till after his presidency to have a real chance of prosecution.
@StewartGatz @krassenstein @MichaelCohen212 is not a credible witness. He can say anything to get a reduced sentence. Even the special councel has discovered that his statements are inconsistent! Meanwhile his testimony is abiut @realDonaldTrump business and  cannot confirm any Russian collusion.
@krassenstein What is your problem with that? Don't you know that God is still interested on the affairs of a nation? God made Donald Trump president! That's why the liberals are confounded! They can't understand it! That's the basis of all the witch hunt and Russian probe! It can happen again
@thehill @HillTVLive What role? She's a liar! Why did she delete her emails? What was she hiding?
@Louanne516702 @chevyJr @krassenstein You are not looking for what @realDonaldTrump did right. You are looking for what he hasn't done right. He is doing well!
@krassenstein I thought the argument was about Russian collusion. The allegations are changing. Elect a priest!
@Louanne516702 @chevyJr @krassenstein Lies of the liberals. You can't argue with facts
@Shaheen42 @krassenstein That gave them opportunity to employ more Americans. That’s the idea. Get it!
@PynWycked @krassenstein @JoJoStone4 Because they were fabricated by haters - no proof!
@jawillie @krassenstein Identity politics
@karbarn60 @chevyJr @krassenstein Identity politics! Be objective in your assessments.
@Louanne516702 @chevyJr @krassenstein Sentiments and lies! He is making America great again! The economy is doing better. You are listening to too many haters and negativity. He is trying to fulfill all his campaign promises. You guys want those who are politically correct but don’t achieve much! Keep an open mind!
@krassenstein POTUS is a genius! He knew what America wanted and went for it! The supposed ‘most qualified candidate to run for president in American history’ had an ambiguous central message - ‘stronger together’. What does that mean? Meanwhile Trump wants to ‘Make America Great Again’!
@chevyJr @krassenstein All fabricated without proof to bring down a duly elected President. Witch-hunt! It would fail. MAGA 2020
@krassenstein What will you do if he wins RE-election in 2020? Hang yourself? Irrespective of what you drum up, you are never gonna convince his supporters to leave him, and there are millions of them! The economy is improving and he is making America great again!
@krassenstein Look at how you are addressing the POTUS. Irrespective of whether you like him or not, he is still the POTUS. You have no respect for constituted authority that the American people chose! Show some respect man! Looks like you are obsessed with the impeachment of this POTUS!
@krassenstein Because he was elected president ahead of ‘the most qualified person to run for president in American history’! Continue to underestimate at your own peril! You that is a saint, why are you not American President?
@krassenstein So we should accept everything you say?
@krassenstein These comments are from an enemy - no objectivity! You cannot stop a moving train!
@krassenstein And what have you been accused of? Are you a Priest? How many presidents are priests around the world! You that is playing sanctimonious, if the searchlight is focused on you, we might make some frightening discovery! Whatever the case, @realDonaldTrump has been elected POTUS!
@krassenstein Keep dreaming!
@DianaJManwaring @funder @MikePerryavatar @TheDemocrats @WhiteHouse That's not gonna happen!
@ThayerBerlyn @funder Some dems also want the wall!
@funder The wall is in the interest of the nation. So it must be built! You cannot shove your hatred down every throat!
@RonaldCocks @funder @Drowninbacon @realDonaldTrump Many in Congress also believe in the wall - from both sides - don't let anyone decieve you. For some, they are envious that @realDonaldTrump may achieve it!
@meSonyaB @davidhatestrump @funder @realDonaldTrump Hater
@funder @realDonaldTrump Do you really care? I thought you wanted him to fail! Why are you now desperate! Let him declare it and let's see what will happen. Many Americans also support the wall! It was a campaign promise. No President has made effort to fulfill his promises like @realDonaldTrump !
@Charles43435876 @WalshFreedom They are haters! Resist, obstruct, even against national interest! That's what they do!
@SoldierInWhite1 @WalshFreedom So you want every American to hate the president because you do? That's not gonna happen. He may even be reelected in 2020
@List444 @WalshFreedom @lauferlaw What war? He's already drawing down troops and the same critics are complaining. There's not gonna be war with North Korea as predicted by the opposition!
@DougBernstein @WalshFreedom @lauferlaw Go and put him in jail now! Hater! @realDonaldTrump is MAGA and all you do is hate! He already deserves a 2nd term!
@JoeT_CTSS @soonergrunt @WalshFreedom MAGA!
@WalshFreedom Then you should be President since you know better! What rubbish!
@HillReporter This guy was fired! He can never be objective in this issue! The loser always fabricate lies to enhance sympathy! These guys were part of those that are determined to make the President fail! Let support the president to make america great again!
@krassenstein So?
@danarel @IlhanMN Lies! Stop blackmailing people! If she is wrong, she can be criticized! You cannot shove her apology down peoples throat! She's not the first to be criticized, neither will she be the last! Many who were wrong have apologized and not accepted! You can't force people to!
@joncoopertweets Why would you want to impeach a guy that is making America Great Again? Are you that consumed with hatred that you have lost objectivity? The economy is booming!
@InvestigateRU Is it in the law that they cannot work in these places?
@Machinist_Paul @krassenstein Because they were all lying - trying to frame @realDonaldTrump! The real truth will soon come out. How the left and liberals orchestrated a scheme to oust a president b/c they are angry he won an election they thought they were supposed to win, but God had a different idea!
@krassenstein When did your view become the doctrine? 'Anyone who says otherwise is a fool'? Because you are who? A MAGA hater!
@krassenstein Rubbish
@JohnBrennan Because he sacked you as CIA boss, that's why you hate him. You know there was no collision!
@xbsa66 @funder @alaskarebel Is Obama now the standard?
@DanaAir I did! I was asked to fill a form at your desk in MM2, and I did, unless that was a scam!
@HopeforVirginia You have been pussy whipped! Without any investigation, you have chosen who to believe!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump for 2020. The best president America has ever had. Straight guy. No hypocrisy! Economy is booming! Re-elect @realDonaldTrump. @krassenstein is being used by enemies and the opposition! They will never see anything good in @realDonaldTrump because of hatred! Fake.
@krassenstein Hatred!
@funder @TheDemCoalition What is wrong with that statement?
@DesignationSix Sure, why not? Would you rather support fake news CNN, NBC, ...?
@peterdaou Barack Obama
@SenGillibrand But he was already a billionaire before he became President. Don't ever forget that.
@funder Must everyone want to destroy trump like you?
@DanaAir MyvPNR was RMOJEH
@MannyUlibarri @krassenstein @nvrsetl Exactly
@krassenstein Cohen has nothing of substance. The Congress already know Cohen was lying to implicate @realDonaldTrump.
@krassenstein @MichaelCohen212 is lying to get reduced sentence!
@funder @realDonaldTrump Watch SOTU
@funder @TheDemCoalition Why?
@DanaAir What is DM?
@DanaAir Hi Dana, I'm still yet to be refunded for a return flight I booked since 21st January 2019.
@krassenstein For you, anything @realDonaldTrump does is wrong! You have suddenly become a genius, and POTUS doesn't know anything despite the information available to him which you are not privy!
@VizslaAngus @AP @WalshFreedom Give @realDonaldTrump some credit!
@krassenstein You are gonna have a long wait! Your hatred is too obvious!
@DanaAir I'm still expecting the update!
@funder America has a President!
@flyairpeace Hi, if I flew to say PH return last 3 weeks without giving my number at the time of ticket purchase whether at the counter or online, how can I add the mileage to my Peace Advantage?
@DanaAir What is DM? Well my PNR was RMOJEH
@DanaAir Yes, I did since the 21st Jan 2019, but I'm yet to get a refund!
@DanaAir Pls kindly refund my money. It is almost 2 weeks now. Thanks
@DanaAir I booked a Dana return flight to Uyo on 21/01/19 to return on 26/01/19. Both flights were cancelled. However, I am yet to get a refund of my ticket money till date! That is not fair at all! Assuming I didn't have money to book another flight, I would have missed my trip!
@realDonaldTrump @danjonesccg There's a difference between 'defeated' and 'destroyed'! You guys should stop playing 'gotcha' and apprentice the POTUS
@RetiredCo857 @Jeff30369754 @NewTexCub @TheStevenThomas @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Assumptions! Wake up! That's not gonna happen. That is wishful thinking! No crime has been proven yet. You are tweeting out of hatred and wishful thinking. That's not gonna happen. You guys have been spreading wishful lies! Trump may still win a 2nd term!
@krassenstein So?
@JohnBrennan @JohnBrennan, that is hatred, not objectivity! Coming from a former spy chief, that is a low low!
@peterdaou You guys are not the courts! You are listening to fake news. Trump wants to Make America Great Again!
@RepAdamSchiff Lies
@atiku Sorry, why did you not attend the Presidential debate?
@atiku Why did you attend the Presidential debate?
@DanaAir I woke up this morning to discover that my flight from LOS - UYO this morning was cancelled! Bad

@ruffydfire Pls what is the title of today's message by Dr Myles Munroe? - the one about success? How can I get the tape/CD?
@krassenstein He's right about one thing though! Looks like you guys don't have a job. You spend all day tweeting hateful things about POTUS! And you are not objective in your tweets. The hatred can be seen all over the place!
@joefaz Vote blue my ass!
@funder Are you legitimate?
@krassenstein That is not gonna happen. He will win again in 2020
@amjoyshow @StormResist @RWPUSA But he hasn't done any wrong! #deepstate, #witchhunt! @realDonaldTrump will be re-elected come 2020
@krassenstein CNN is fake news!
@krassenstein No @realDonaldTrump will appoint his enemies especially @krassenstein as both VP and UN Ambassador
@krassenstein No crime was committed by @realDonaldTrump! The haters are trying to fabricate one but that will never be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
@krassenstein There's nothing for Meuller to find. No crime was committed. It's just that the Liberals couldn't believe that Trump won in 2016.
@funder @realDonaldTrump will be the best President America has ever had!
@CJPatruno @ListenToEzra So LGBTQ should be honoured?
@krassenstein Go and force her to divorce her husband.
@funder Go and force him to resign and handover to you!
@funder 1 witch hunt
@krassenstein But @HillaryClinton still lost the election to @realDonaldTrump! So it doesn't matter!
@JohnBrennan @JohnBrennan is a hater! He loses objectivity when @realDonaldTrump is involved! He has become partisan!
@krassenstein @BetoORourke @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump is waiting for them!
@loladeantonia26 @ajillity308 @johncardillo @RepAdamSchiff @RepSwalwell @SenSchumer @SenBlumenthal @SenateFloor @HouseFloor So?
@krassenstein So what?
@funder Is doing business in Russia now a crime?
@kylegriffin1 So does Russia Project mean election interference? @realDonaldTrump was a businessman before he decided to run for President. Is it a crime to do business in Russia, or does he know he was going to win? He won because the Obama/Clintons left many people behind!
@HoarseWisperer That's not gonna happen!
@HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump will not resign. He is doing well and will ho on to win 2020. He has done nothing wrong!
@funder Go and sack them now! Nonsense! Your hatred for the Reds know no bounds! You have no objectivity where the Reds are concerned! The Democrats lost the presidential election. That is what all this witch hunt is all about! The American people have made their choice. Accept it!
@DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Rubbish! This is a make up by enemies of @realDonaldTrump. There was no collusion!
@PassTheSalty Impeached for what? Resign for what? He has not legally done anything wrong! He just has too many enemies who are trying to fabricate a crime and slam it on him. All the convictions of his aides have so far no direct connection with Russia! Mueller is trying to use his aides!
@MillenPolitics She is also a liar! She is not any better than @realDonaldTrump. Pls accept it and move on! Election has been won and lost! American people have made their choice between the two candidates. @HillaryClinton has a lot of baggage too! Don't make her any better.
@SafetyPinDaily @BarackObama @HillaryClinton @BillClinton @realDonaldTrump Winning the popular vote without winjing the electoral vote does not make anyone president!
@funder You are not objective when it comes to @realDonaldTrump! So he should be paying his transportation from his pocket? Who does that? I think you are a hater!
@SafetyPinDaily But @BarackObama said @HillaryClinton was the most qualified candidate for Presidency and that she is better than him and @BillClinton, and yet @realDonaldTrump beat her! And yet you don't respect @realDonaldTrump! Try again!
@JohnWDean Go and kill him now. Why are you waiting for 2020. Your hate makes you lose objectivity! All of a sudden, you are now smarter than @realDonaldTrump
@DebbieRexroat OK, so people even voted for @realDonaldTrump ? I thought you guys said Americans didn't vote for him? That it's the Russians that voted for him? Hypocritical liars! The truth is beginning to come out! Just because you hate someone does not mean the person is bad!
@funder @BarackObama Rubbish
@MillenPolitics What's good about LGBTQ?
@SaysHummingbird And so?
@funder @IvankaTrump Yes. Are you happy now?
@krassenstein What if @realDonaldTrump is innocent of the collusion allegation and he is cleared by Mueller? What if the media that has been judging @realDonaldTrump have all been wrong all along and is borne out of hatred? Will you now respect and support him?
@funder Can you find anything to give @realDonaldTrump credit for? You always criticize everything he does! I think you should run for president
@VictoryFund @StormResist @Dewitt4Congress @sjbgroup How is LGBTQ your true authentic self? It is confusion in my view!
@AriMelber No he should replace him with an enemy!
@funder Serves @jimacosta right! He got what he deserved! You can't go to the White House with the goal of challenging the President. Let's see where he goes from here.
@joncoopertweets To be objective, @CNNjimacosta was not friendly with his questions. He was asking the question of an enemy. He deserves what he got. @realDonaldTrump will not be a punching bag! Journalists should know leaders are humans too!
@funder No. He shouldn't investigate Hillary. He should leave her alone, and investigate @realdonaldtrump that promoted him to AG. Also since @democrats have taken over the House with the intention of making trouble, @realdonaldtrump should stick with an AG that recused himself!
@funder If he Is neo Nazi, so what? What are liberals - LGBTQ? Is that a good thing? We need to have values, man! Wake up. Those things are satanic!
@funder Is anyone preventing you from voting?
@joncoopertweets Why should I vote Dems? Is it for abortion rights, LGBTQ and other liberal tendencies? I avise you @joncoopertweets to vote Republican. That's the only vote that makes sense!
@cvpayne And @donlemon is sleeping with a white man!
@funder Wrong again! Trump means well for America. #MAGA
@jmsexton_ Why not?
@funder Our economy our vote! Vote Red @ midterms.
@donlemon, why are you a @realDonaldTrump hater?
@funder @realDonaldTrump is a great American, far better than Obama! He is #MAGA !
@foxandfriends Who is Oprah?
@funder Vote GOPs
@funder Vote GOP is trending. The silent army is getting ready. Keep deluding yourself. #MAGA
@funder You continue to misrepresent the facts! You can't fool anyone! You chose not to say that he condemned the shooting! You continue to lie! Economy is booming! No one is buying your story!
@funder Why is that your problem? Economy is booming and jobs are coming back. #MAGA
@NostolobiRon @ProudResister Lies! The economy is booming and jobs are coming back! Vote Red for continuous!
@funder Spinning the lies and changing the narratives won't help you! People can know the truth for themselves. You have a blind hatred for @realDonaldTrump and @GOP. Economy is booming! Don't deceive people. Vote Red
@Corsair502 @ProudResister Lies! Deception! With the economy booming, you could not have done that!
@brycetache Lies. The economy is booming. Jobs are coming back. We have more money in our pockets. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump	So we mist vote red.
How important is football compared to human life? How come the EPL went on with the Sunday (and Monday) game despite the death of Mr. V, the chairman of Leicester City FC who lost his life (and that of 4 others) when his helicopter crashes at the KP Stadium?
@TheDemocrats Lies from the democrats!
@funder This is misinformation! The economy is growing and you are not talking about it?
RT @IwanTheRightist: @mikedrake178 @1961sarahw @GOP @realDonaldTrump "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers." -So…
@KingDaddyLeeds @WestHamMatters @GOP @realDonaldTrump Lies again by the angry liberals! According to all the investigations, the voting or counting machines were never accessed! Accept defeat and move on! Stop misrepresenting the facts!
@SteveScalise @HillaryClinton, this woman is still bitter and has lost objectivity! She is trying to sell deception. Thank God she didn't win!
@StephenKing Who told you she will lose. That remains to be seen! There are many quiet supporters! The same reason why @realDonaldTrump won! It's not about shouting and making noise, claiming you are speaking for the American people! In face people are angry with the desperation of the left!
@StephenKing So you hate white men? Is that what is fueling all these tweets? Your messages lack objectivity!
@StephenKing If Dr. Ford was really traumatised as she claimed, how come she still went on to become a professor? You do not want to give Kavanaugh any benefit of the doubt! What if she was wrong? Have you thought of that? You can't just run with one side of the story!
@StephenKing For the sake of argument, should you be judged by what you did 36 years ago? What if you have changed for the better? Remember that you were not at the party, so no one can say with all certainty that Dr. Ford was right!
@StephenKing Wrong! You are mis- characterizing the issue! The Republicans are right! You are trying to spread hatred! You can't shove it down anyone's throat! What if you were Kavanaugh and you were pretty sure it wasn't you? Would you step aside because someone accused you?
@StephenKing So once you are accused of any sexual assault, you should resign whether you actually did make the assault or not? This blackmail won't work. We cannot run a country where the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocent. It should be the other way round.
@TheDemocrats Pls let's vote the Republicans. They are more straightforward. Democrats are playing to the galley!
@CNNPolitics What should they have done? Give him a free pass? Would the Democratic party not challenge Lisa Makurski? Pls stop this blackmail and hypocrisy!
@AllResistNews @TheDemCoalition @AndrewGillum @BetoORourke @staceyabrams @ProudResister @sahluwal @Ocasio2018 @MikeLevinCA @_SJPeace_ @brycetache @SaysHummingbird @joncoopertweets @KamalaHarris Wrong! Political correctness is deception. I rather vote for who will be straight!
@MurrayCampaign @dscc So what? Who cares whether you forget or not! Hypocrisy of high moral ground when you have your own agenda which you must achieve by destroying a decent man! Just because someone said you did something does not mean you actually did. This blackmail will not work!
@SarahKSilverman @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Rubbish!
@BernieSanders The democrats are planning to shift the goal post! It has always Ben an orchestrated plan. It was never about the truth! It was always about politics. Even @BernieSanders has lost objectivity!
@jaketapper @nytimes Are you a saint? If #kavanaugh was questioned by the police in 1985, does that automatically mean that he was guilty of what Ford accused him off? @CNNPolitics is anti @realDonaldTrump and is fast losing its followers because of lack of objectivity in your coverage!
@MSNBC @JamesComeyFBI is losing it! In a bid to hurt @realDonaldTrump, he doesn't care if he destroys the career of an innocent man! He loses objectivity where @realDonaldTrump is involved. That is understandable because he was sacked!
@CNNPolitics And so? You guys have already chosen who to believe! You have continued to spread positive comments about the Ford woman and negative comments about #Kavanaugh. That is not objective! @CNNPolitics is losing it!
@CNNPolitics So what? When did what people say become a yardstick to determine guilt or innocence?
@CNNPolitics CNN loses objectivity when it comes to @realDonaldTrump! The followeship of CNN is dropping by the day with their effort to spin a negative narrative out of anything @realDonaldTrump does. Many people are getting tired of CNN and no longer believe them.
@SenWarren @SenWarren, if the FBI investigation shows that Kavanaugh is innocent, would you vote for him?
@vannyondbolock Hi Vanny
@foxandfriends This is racist and divisive @joybahar! Not fair!
@nowthisnews @SenateDems But the Senator's assessment has been debunked to be false! Did you selectively choose to ignore that part of the story?
@Spacedad2 @SenateDems @Karen_Hanken Just because somebody said you did something, does that mean you did it? Kavanaugh is over qualified to be your gardener, we are talking about a Judge. What is your qualification? Pls try to be objective!
@SenateDems If the FBI investigation in th coming days indicate that Kavanaugh was innocent, would the Senate Democrats vote for him? If they don't, then  they will be sending a clear message that they were not after the truth about Kavanaugh!
@CNNPolitics If the FBI investigation indicate that Kavanaugh was innocent, would the Senate Democrats vote for him?
@AP If the FBI investigation indicate that Kavanaugh was innocent, would @KamalaHarris vote for him?
