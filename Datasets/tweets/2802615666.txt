That's the name of the game.
You'd better shape up.
Monkey see, monkey do.
Better safe than sorry.
Money talks.
Every little bit helps.
Easier said than done.
Time flies.
Now or never.
What are your intentions ?
How about noe ?
What's he driving at ?
Could you say that in another way ?
Could you say that more simply ?
Could you speak more clearly ?
Could you slow down, please ?
Please don't speak so quickly.
Please speak a little louder.
I didn't catch your name.
Do you follow me ?
I couldn't catch what you said.
I can't hear you well.
Did you say something ?
Would you repeat that,please ?
Would you explain it again ?
What do you mean ?
Are you saying that it's a cultural difference ?
You were saying ?
I didn't understand.
I'm getting confused.
I'm sorry I'm not following you.
I'm sorry, what did you say ?

Do you want me to help you?
May I help you?
@ystk_yrk Let's root.
I am pleased to let you know this.
I guess I need to come clean.
I can explain.
I know,but I have no other choice.
It makes no difference !
That's absolute nonsense !
It's against the law.
That's fair.
That's fine with me.
We think alike.
I have no objection.
Then it's agreed.
Looks like we agree.
So we agree?
That's exactly what I was thinking.
I guess you're right.
That would be fine.
I don't blame you.
That could easily happen.
I support that view.

You promised that you would accept it.
Consider it done !
I guarantee it.
Don't go back on your word !
I'll be there for sure.
I promise I won't do it again.
I don't need your lip service.
You can't go back on word now.
I'm the kind of man who keeps my word.
I will do it no matter what happens.
I'll do it for sure.
I have an appointment to meet http://t.co/7UAbM3BPE2 tomorrow.
I promise I won't let you down.
Can you promise not to tell anyone?
Please keep your promises.
