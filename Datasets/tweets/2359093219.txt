@Kaepernick7 @Eminem If you had enough pride in your country, you wouldn't be glorifying, drugs, violence and alcohol.  Be a real role model and have some self respect.
@Kaepernick7 have some pride in your country, even the NFL rule book requires you to stand. Why does no one get that

How many times did Obama try to violate the Constitution and no one wanted to stop him
What I find very ironic is that so many people are angry about Trump's administrative executive orders being unconstitutional.
