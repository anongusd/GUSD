@TerranomaLead @sjhendrix548 @propornot @stranahan @Clara_Resists FOX NEWS IS FAKE NEWS. That’s why trump likes it so much except the times they have called him out. Now LEAVE ME ALONE.

@JamesBo51072455 @SandiDastous @PattyMurray Everyone in America came from immigration. Also, Arizona Texas California &amp; New Mexico previously belonged to Mexico. We wanted it &amp; took it. At one time we felt the same about Irish, Italian etc. keep that in mind
@JamesBo51072455 @SandiDastous @PattyMurray By using technology to see who is &amp; who isn’t immigrants. They should have a pathway to citizenship. Again, we took it from the Natives first. Then tried to kill them off &amp; put them on reservations that would not afford them a livelihood.
@Karenet24 @SandiDastous @PattyMurray Republicans are traitors!’ We need more immigration judges to process those there at the Boarder. It it wasn’t for immigration no one would be here except Native Americans. This wasn’t our country. We took it from the Natives then processed to try to kill them all off
@mcspocky @wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump This is poppycock!! The Boarder guards have proved Technology works with all drugs &amp; weapons caught with Technology at ports of entry. That’s how they find tunnels. Trump is as bright as a burnt out light bulb
@SandiDastous @PattyMurray Democrats want to work together. They &amp; many Americans believe we can secure our Boarders without a physical wall.
@LorienMCS @PattyMurray This is very true. A wall will destroy the eco system if a wall separates they Boarder wall. Many coyotes (4legged animals) &amp; other animals come back &amp; forth for breeding. They won’t be able to do this &amp; it will kill them out.
@PattyMurray I’m afraid trump will fight when he doesn’t get his way. He is talking technology but he still wants his Monument to his trumpdome

@gapper53 @musebemused @JFKLibrary No, that is not their agenda! They are for Americans but as we took this country from Native Americans.  We took many western states they took from the Latino people. If Government stopped spending money unnecessarily we could help asylum seekers.
@gapper53 @musebemused @JFKLibrary They don’t care more about immigrates than the American people. Americans don’t like the inhuman treatment they are receiving.,
@gapper53 @musebemused @JFKLibrary It’s not the red hat, it’s the racist brain underneath it.
@musebemused @gapper53 @JFKLibrary Yes I know. Not all Republicans are bad. That was proven when many Republicans broke rank &amp; voted with Democrats to open the Government. But the ones that are are very bad
@musebemused @gapper53 @JFKLibrary I agree. There is good &amp; bad in all people’s. The trump’s are the exception

@realDonaldTrump Are you out of your mind. The Trump Clan is so deeply in debt to Russia they just about own you. Why don’t you ask them for the money for the wall? Russian Mob built Trump SOHO &amp; gives you 18% for use of your name!
@EdKrassen I don’t believe he’ll shutdown the Government. If he’s still in office, he will go with Emergency!!
@boxsterman77 @briantylercohen @wire_zombie Call it Fox Lies with Friends. Has double meaning!
@briantylercohen @williamlegate Well I just sent them an email. Along with facts about Trump SOHO being built with RUSSIAN MOB MONEY. Trump received 18% to put his name on the building. Also the Trump’s ETAL have admitted they get a lot of money from Russia.

@politico And note, the Federal Workers have yet to receive their back pay from that shutdown &amp; are suing. Still an on going case!!
@Newsweek DEMENTIA OR SENILITY !!!
@NBCNews Why can’t they use that for the wall? Besides Putin told trump to stay out of it.?

@AltUSPressSec If not Impeachment, I do believe we have grounds for 25th Amendment. Trump has dementia! He can’t follow a line of questions &amp; answer them. He always wonders off on some other subject.
@ProudResister @GOP @senatemajldr Trump started it &amp; McConnell let him run with it. He should have done his job
@williamlegate Trump is suffering from dementia or senility. People get angry &amp; think everyone is out to get them. Went through it with my dad. That blank look they give because you have no clue what they are talking about.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Speaker Pelosi can out match trump because she still is sharp. Where as trump is senile &amp; has dementia. Acts like my dad did when he slipped mentally.
@TheRynheart I do believe a great deal falls to McConnell. That being said, some of the GOP has split from the pack &amp; are thinking for their selves or terms any way.  I’m just wondering if they know trump has dementia or is senile
@mcspocky He thinks he’s a god. However I think it’s dementia or serious senility! I think we need to bring out 25th Amendment.

@UROCKlive1 I don’t know but I’d go for 25th Amendment!
@joncoopertweets Do you not wonder why no one has suggested the 25th Amendment? I think perhaps Alzheimer’s or other dementia.

@sasquatchtango @funder No to worry. I’m just so bloody angry at this point I oft miss the joke

@johannamodica11 #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN Never before had our FEDERAL WORKERS HAD to continue working without receiving PAY. It is CRUEL &amp; INHUMAN. Yet Trump insists on our FEDERAL WORKERS work or furloughed go without pay &amp; now retired Coast Guard go without their retirement checks. This must STOP
@DearAuntCrabby @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN Unfortunately as long as the “commander in chief” is an entitled white sexist racist, many of his followers will copy him. We need rid of him. As long as he keeps Our Government shut down investigation is hindered
@Slate #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN I have watched it from several angles. There were other groups yelling however the kids from the school were yelling “build a wall” another kid said “it isn’t rape if you like it” The kids from the school are racist feel privileged &amp; entitled. Trump juniors.

@mcspocky Prayers positive thoughts
@politico #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN trump is continuing the SHUTDOWN to hinder the investigation against him. STOP HOLDING FEDERAL WORKERS HOSTAGE. Work without pay is illegal. SLAVERY BY GOP
@SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN DEMOCRATS are the ONLY body trying to OPEN OUR GOVERNMENT. GOP is COVERING trump’s crimes.
@SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #EndTrumpGopSHUTDOWN Trump’s statement wasn’t an offer. You don’t negotiate on TV. No Wall is no deal. Open Government return &amp; repay Federal Workers the talk about technology to assist with Boarder Security. Federal Workers aren’t Secure!
@SenKamalaHarris #EndTrumpSHUTDOWN The Federal Workers need to be sent back to work &amp; receive back pay. These Workers have nothing to do with negotiations for trump’s wall. It is illegal to make people work without pay. Forced labor is SLAVERY.
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog What about Trump/Russian probe.  Just move to IMPEACH.

@blessed21913978 @funder #EndTrumpShutdown trump is holding children in dog kennels &amp; poor in tent cities. He is holding AMERICAN FEDERAL WORKERS HOSTAGE.

@MSNBC @chrislhayes This just proves Trump is a bigot &amp; not fit to be our president. He has revealed Congress plans for a trip to our troops &amp; given the route which endangered those Congressional leaders. Refused us of Air Force plane for the meetings but let flotus the same plane to take a vacation
@MSNBC @chrislhayes Trump has continued to show his bigotry. Puerto Rico is some jungle problem (they are an America territor &amp; vote) no FEMA for California because of forest fires (Federal forest) Civil Service furloughed or Working without pay so we can WALL out immigration of brown people.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Bigotry is alive and well in the Trump/Pence WH. It continues to grow &amp; spread in the GOP Senate. Congress has passed &amp; presented many bills to the GOP Senate but Leader McConnell will not bring them to the floor for a vote. His feeling Trump doesn’t want them. Not how it works
@fawfulfan @sellwithmarcy This is so deplorable. What century do we live in anyway. Bigotry is alive &amp; continuing in this America. It seems more so now with Trump/Pence in office. Something must be done
@funder I agree. This holding Federal Workers, Contractors &amp; the Coast Guard Hostage, furlough many $ make others work without pay amounts to slave labor. Trump is holding them hostage for an immoral wall because of his racist ideals towards people of color.

@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson They were very DISRESPECTFUL to the Native American Vietnam Vet. They were wrong &amp; should have apologized.

@psychdr100 @commondreams Our Government is under investigation from the UN for humanitarian abuses. So there is pressure there. #OpenOurGovernment
@EdKrassen #ImpeachTheMF #OpenOurGovernment I fully agree we are in this mess because of trump &amp; his army of lairs. Hopefully Mueller will nail his hide to the WH front door. I have noted flotus has kept away since Christmas. Makes me wonder if WH is getting hot &amp; uncomfortably.
@ABC That’s amazing. They can be dangerous if they have young ones in the pod.
@joefaz The separation of children &amp; parents was a DIRECT RESULT OF trump’s ZERO TOLERANCE on immigration!! That’s why we have the crisis. That &amp; he wasn’t processing any asylum seekers just treating them all as illegals &amp; gangs.?
@EdKrassen I agree. He &amp; flotus went to visit the troops then to Germany. When he pulled Speaker Pelosi’s plane, the same day flotus flew they same type of plane to Mars Largo for a much needed vacation! That said VOLUMES.
@ellievan65 Happy Birthday Dolly Pardon. I loved when they tried to back her into a corner about politics. She said I have my own opinions, my job is a singer song writer that’s my job for my audience.

@3DTruth Hopefully some will step in &amp; declare trump unfit for office emotionally or mentally.
@krassenstein I sure hope you are right. I’m hoping we don’t have to wait until 2020 to end this hell.
@NBCNews I think more teens do it by drugs of. But responsesble gun ownership keeps guns out of kids reach. While I was growing up in 50 &amp; 60s we had guns in house. High school you would have kids come to school with guns in car/truck after hunting.
@funder @davetrickey @realDonaldTrump One wonders if it wasn’t WH sending out crap so he can declare state of emergency.
@funder @davetrickey @realDonaldTrump I’m thinking state of emergency being called because trump can’t get his way.
@leeleeb50 Only 1 supposed farmer said a rug was found but was afraid of being retaliation so would not give interview. It was in Arizona.
@joncoopertweets I’d be dazed &amp; amazed. But not 5.7 for a wall. Don’t think Speaker Pelosi would go for that. Money for technology yes to get Government open but not 5.7 billion perhaps 2billion
@leeleeb50 That’s like saying Jewish people are to blame for Germany in WWl &amp; Germany WWll.  No, 1 person just sucked in a bunch of people &amp; dragged anyone they didn’t approve of into the mix. Most of it was because Jewish people worked hard &amp; had more money.
@Lucialovefun Drink my drink and say nothing. You don’t mess with people serving you. Talk about something else. That’s why the say don’t talk church or politics in public! Like an asshole everyone has an opinion. Or as Grandma said, some people have an asshole, other people are an asshole

@PhilippeReines @The_UnSilent_ I don’t believe Speaker Pelosi has lost her points. She has remained poised &amp; states her points &amp; why. Trump is retaliatory in ever move he makes. The SHUTDOWN first &amp; not responding when given what he asked for with GOP but then kept raising his prices.

@warren_bass @tcwittes @MPhillipsWSJ #ImpeachTheMF #WheresMitch It isn’t in trump’s best interest to bring up yet another place that needs our assistance. He wants us out of NATO or have Nations pay for our assistance for us to stay in NATO.
@Boyeeeeeeerrrr @TABEAUMONT @SenDuckworth Mom are being processed do to the SHUTDOWN. SOME ARE illegals. Most likely ALOT ARE ASYLUM SEEKERS. Right now they are being held in tent cities &amp; dog kennels. Google isn’t always the answer. Books at libraries &amp; census will give you more info.
@StanLeeGee @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett Well Kellyanne needs to be told these things. Sarah Sanders sent out trumpy’s letter in Twitter. And then gave the backup plan after trump told her she could go commercial. Of course flouts took a similar plane to mar a largo for a “much needed vacation”.
RT @AKiel42308269: @alice_booher @Kokomothegreat I never came across anything that prohibits anyone from calling...........many times.
@AKiel42308269 @Kokomothegreat #ImpeachTheMF trump thinks he will win. Heaven help us, if he isn’t out until 2020 he will be gone then. He did tell TSA not to talk but unless he is going to stand beside them like a schoolmaster he might be able to stop them but he can’t do that. Shows how desperate he is.
@AKiel42308269 @Kokomothegreat #ImpeachTheMF I totally agree that the idiot is totally batshit crazy. I believe he wanted Pelosi to get on a plane &amp; his problem would “he thinks” be over. Pelosi has checked him at each move in this Chess game. Only Pelosi knows it isn’t a game.

@RudyGiuliani #ImpeachTheMf #WheresMitch #OpenOurGoverment Perhaps you should be getting you liar of a client ready for his grilling. Perhaps you should cover trump’s behind regarding Jeffery Epstein &amp; how trump attended orgies &amp; was serviced by under aged girls!
@AKiel42308269 @Kokomothegreat To true. #ImpeachTheMF. He may well declare he is now #KingOfTheStateOfEmergency!! I know the big statement will be that none of us are taking his Crisis at the Boarder seriously enough so he must take drastic measures. Of course his 800 number was flooded with NO to the wall
@leeleeb50 By trump which truely is telling on trump’s guilt. I’m sure Mueller has backup on things to get the #ImpeachTheMF
@portersure @EagleGuardian2 Trump is playing any wild card because he has been blocked at every turn. I think he knows Mueller is closing in on him &amp; his ugly past is about to bite him in his big big butt! #ImpeachTheMF
@portersure @EagleGuardian2 #WheresMitch #OpenOurGovernment #ImpeachTheMF. The “wall” is not totally structurally sound nor financial good at this time. If trump declares a state of emergency, he may well have more on his plate than he can handle. My feelings are that like a cockroach, he is running fast
@Boyeeeeeeerrrr @TABEAUMONT @SenDuckworth Apparently I should have used a map &amp; a stick.

@Boyeeeeeeerrrr @TABEAUMONT @SenDuckworth I said asylum seekers are allowed on without documents, but then claims should be verified. If not asylum seekers they should be returned. True asylum needs should be meant. They will get visa &amp; start work.

@joncoopertweets I full agree that unless Pence can prove without question. Pence should also be removed from office. Should trump not be brought up on some charges for disclosing Pelosi’s trip &amp; locations which should be endangerment because she was headed to a war zone??

@MomRovin @joncoopertweets I wonder about Mr Barr as he would not recluse himself for any reason. I think there is a fix in the works
@MomRovin @joncoopertweets I don’t believe Mr Barr should be AG. While well qualified, I feel in this climate at this time with this President he should not be confirmed.  AG Sessions was fired because he Reclused himself. Trump didn’t want his AG not to recluse himself. Mr Barr will not recluse himself.

@Boyeeeeeeerrrr @TABEAUMONT @SenDuckworth No absolutely not. We have a gross national debt. Simple math, if you make $15 an out &amp; pay 10% tax that’s $1.5. However. If you make $1,500 an hour @ 10# that’s $150. Our debt would eventually be lowered.

@CarolVernon7 @NoahBookbinder @ungubunugu1274 @GOP @SenateGOP True. However they could go after Trump for sex with under age girl. He attended Jeffery Epstein’s sex orgies &amp; was serviced by under age girl about the time Ivanka was 13. The girl reminded Trump of his daughter.
@ABCPolitics @ABC News people need to review Jeffery Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. Trump attended &amp; was serviced by a 13yr girl because she reminded him of then 13yr Ivanka. POTUS Sex pervert!
@hooksie5 @traceygaughran @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi And Trump had sex with a 13yr girl at Jeffery Epstein’s sex orgies with under age girls. Epstein is a registered sex offended &amp; should be subpoenaed by Mueller. Great example of a president. Trump is SICK
@ABCPolitics We need to also check Jeffery Epstein’s relationship with Trump. Epstein is a registered sex offender with trafficking in under aged girls. Trump attended those Epstein orgies. Trump was serviced by a 13yr girl. Should we have a POTUS that is a sex offender with a teen?
@nypost Mueller should subpoena Jeffery Epstein a registered sex offender. Trump attended Epstein’s sec orgies along with Epstein. Trump was “serviced by a 13yr girl that Trump wanted as she reminded Trump of his then 13yr daughter Ivanka. Should we really have a sex offender as POTUS

@thehill The women’s movement needs to check into Jeffery Epstein’s relationship with Trump. Trump attended Epstein’s orgies with a 13yr. Mueller should subpoena Epstein a registered sex offender.
@CNNPolitics Mueller should also be checking the President’s relationship with Jeffery Epstein a registered sex offender. Trump attended &amp; had sex with under age girls. Trump is a sex offender with a 13yr girl that looked like Ivanka
@NYDailyNews Perhaps you should check into Jeffery Epstein’s relationship with Trump. Trump attended Epstein’s orgies &amp; had a 13yr girl give him s hand job. He attended several orgies at Epstein’s. Trump is a sex offender with minors!
@chicagotribune You should check into relationship of Jeffery Epstein &amp; Trump. Jeffery was convicted of under age sex crimes. Trump attended Epstein’s orgies and had a 13yr girl give him a hand job. I found the video I’m sure you can also. Trump is a sex criminal.
@CNBC You should also check into Trump’s relationship with Jeffery Epstein. He is a registered sex offender &amp; Trump’s friend. Trump attended Epstein’s orgies &amp; had sex with a 13yr old girl. She gave him a hand job. Because she looked like Ivanka.
@business Check into tRump’s relationship with registered sex offender Jeffery Epstein. There is a video of a girl telling of the time tRump had her give him a hand job when she was 13yr. It was the same time Ivanka was 13yrs. Epstein should be subpoenaed!
@TwcArthur Check into Jeffery Epstein a registered sex offender. He use to have tRump to his orgies. tRump had a 13yr give him a hand job at Epstein’s orgies. tRump should be jailed just as Cosby was. The girl reminded tRump of Ivanka when she was 13. Sick SOB!

@EdKrassen @TomFitton How in the hell can Fox News blame Hillary?? She isn’t in government any longer. Nor did she ANNOUNCE we were moving out of Syria. Who was that oh yeah trump on NATIONAL TV. HE SAID THEY WERE DEFEATED. That’s FAKE NEWS!!!
@TheRynheart I’d love to see that. My money is on Pelosi
@DearAuntCrabby I believe the only way McConnell &amp; trump will get the message is for TSA Boarder Security &amp; all Federal Workers not being paid while being forced to work should have a sit out. It amounts to Slave Labor.?

@johnpavlovitz I don’t get it either!! I mean his women might go for the big bucks (he hasn’t enough money) but I voted for trump (shame face) but I have seen what he has done to America. Long before the wall thing. When he started loosing people close to him. Becoming a viper against them!!!

@InspiringU2 @ChrisMatyszczyk @Inc This article says a lot about how THE CIVILIAN WORKERS feel. Who they are holding directly responsible should ANY THING HAPPEN! trump is the cause &amp; unfortunately the only one able to break it up.
@InspiringU2 @ChrisMatyszczyk @Inc The Pilots are concerned for their passengers as well as their self.  Controllers are over worked &amp; not paid. TSA Agents aren’t being paid. I would no want to fly. Perhaps if trump has to fly with normal people we would be more concerned.
@InspiringU2 A salute to Charles de Gaulle. This is so true. I’m not sure that trump is capable of love or humanity!! He wants our America to knuckle under to his rule. Now at his feet! No way!
@Slate YES. Read their history. It’s very close to what we are dealing with in our trump years.
@NWPinPDX @debbiesideris @TrinityResists @ScarletAvengers @ListenToEzra @DearAuntCrabby @B52Malmet @TheSWPrincess @ChocoHarveyMilk @MatthewWolfff @BatmanResist Hopefully, you aren’t surprised. I think his tongue would blister with the TRUTH!! trump is MENTAL!!!
@thehill Well at they are showing some compassion. Or covering their asses. Hard to tell which.
@JRubinBlogger YES! All trump’s insane erratic behavior is just making a better case against him. If you do nothing WRONG you have NOTHING TO HIDE. This just puts a bullseye on his back.
@jimsciutto @ladyhawkerfinds YES &amp; if trump wasn’t guilty why would he do all this!! He is only showing his guilt.
@yashar YES but Congress can issue subpoenas &amp; they must comply. Mueller is a GOP but that’s in@our favor because he is by the book &amp; can’t be bought off. So if he nails trump it will be ironclad
@AdamOberhausen @DearAuntCrabby Pelosi $ Congress needs to bring bill of impeachment then vote &amp; submit to Senate. Pelosi is smart &amp; won’t bring it to a vote until she has a clear case of collusion directly to trump. Without that high of proof GOP won’t turn on their president. It must be bulletproof.
@DearAuntCrabby I agree. However, her brothers have been linked to trump’s crimes so she most likely willl be found shady also. The problem is that Senate most likely won’t vote him out unless they have very clear evidence he is a Putin puppet.
@HoarseWisperer I’m with you. I was up most of the night.
@GeorgeTakei I want the Mueller reports!!!!
@Kambrell You should be very very PROUD. Remember your history ( know you will) and do your ancestors PROUD!!! God Bless You.

@StopTrump2020 That’s because trump thinks Federal Workers are fully with him or his other excuse is They are all Democrats so he doesn’t care.  Great president THAT DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE he HURTS.!
@joncoopertweets trump will declare the State of Emergency soon. Many think because Rosenstein isn’t PROTECTED all information will be lost.  Don’t THINK SO.  Neither did Nixon.
@joncoopertweets NO, NO it isn’t.  Or at least it shouldn’t be.  GOP seems a bit desperate. I got a text from trump campaign asking for money (WOULD NOT) two texts actually.  I think trump &amp; his@loyal GOP are on the ropes &amp; running scared. trump will be declaring State of Emergency
