People who make fun of Band camp&lt;&lt;&lt;
It's funny when people get frustrated over something at you and you don't even care.
I don't understand how I'm on a hip-hop station on pandora and I end up listening "we will rock you" by Queen...
Been the best summer yet!
It's weird getting your hair cut by someone you've never gotten it cut by before.
So excited for the dark knight marathon with @connorstone
@DoYouBelievelt amen to that.
@PiccoloGuy gosh. Can you imagine someone being that way grown up? I don't think I've ever met someone like that.
I want this to be the best summer yet!
I feel like there's a lot people leaving my life this summer #sadday😔😥
@PiccoloGuy I swear he's one of the most innocent people you'll ever meet.
@PiccoloGuy what's he going to do out in the real world?

@kayleigh_little sorry....
@cmykalap true but what they're doing isn't teaching them to be nice. It's being retarded.
@cmykalap they really do. And if you don't like it when little kids start being "disrespectful" then you shouldn't be teacher kindergarten.
@cmykalap I personally think that dumb.
@cmykalap oh my goodness.He's in kindergarten.he's a boy what do you expect him to do.Act like an adult?Theres a reason he's in kindergarten
@cmykalap please retweet that because it showed up as an error.
@cmykalap what has he done?
