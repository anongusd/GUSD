When we‚Äôre talking, we‚Äôre not fighting. Two years ago we were worried about an imminent nuclear war with North Korea. We have a long way to go before achieving denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, but these talks are another step in right direction.
Tomorrow, I will join my colleagues to introduce bipartisan legislation that requires Congressional approval for an emergency to last longer than 60 days. If Speaker Pelosi is serious about reasserting Congress‚Äôs constitutional powers, she will bring it to the floor for a vote.
We have a problem at our border which is why I have supported over $220B for homeland security including technology, manpower and barriers. But possibly taking money from Joint Base SA, Laughlin AFB and Fort Bliss will not help. That‚Äôs why I voted against the national emergency.

China's objectives are clear: using hacking to steal advanced technology and bolster its position at the expense of other nations.

We cannot abandon our allies, like the Syrian Democratic Forces, and create an opening for ISIS, Iran and Russia to determine the fate of millions of Syrians and create a safe haven for terrorist groups that threaten our security.
ISIS is a global threat and could re-emerge as a destructive insurgency in Syria and Iraq.
Withdrawing our ground forces undermines the strong, global coalition we built to defeat this threat. It is clear from available intelligence that ISIS is trying to rebuild and still commands a significant fighting force of over 30k.
Earlier this month, the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS was undertaking new operations in Eastern Syria. And last week the Chairman of Joint Chiefs said we‚Äôve only trained 20% of the forces necessary to stabilize areas formerly held by ISIS.

Like all 24-year-old business deals, #NAFTA needs to be modernized to keep pace with policy changes, evolving industries and emerging technology. There are opportunities for us ‚Äì and all Americans ‚Äì to win big with NAFTA 2.0. https://t.co/2WEgNIy5GL
Since #NAFTA was signed into law in my hometown of San Antonio 24 years ago, America‚Äôs trade with Mexico and Canada has more than tripled. US-Mexico trade alone increased more than 280 percent between 1993 and 2016. We've got to get this right. https://t.co/NSnXciURyR
We're at this point because people have forgotten the importance of free trade. We have to continue to make the case for #NAFTA.  https://t.co/0rFOqjaB8o
More than a million jobs in #Texas, and 14 million nationwide, depend on trade with Mexico and Canada. Many folks don't realize how much of an impact #NAFTA has on our economy. https://t.co/2WEgNIguPd

ICYMI: My opening statement from today's IT Subcommittee hearing. Our existence as a #democracy depends on free, fair &amp; accurate elections. https://t.co/QtdyTId6qe
"Electronic voting systems must resist not only fraud from corrupt candidates &amp; supporters, but also election disruption from hostile nation-state adversaries." - @mattblaze
"The integrity of the vote today depends on the integrity of the software systems - running on voting machines &amp; on county election networks - over which elections are conducted" - @mattblaze
"We are not na√Øve about the likelihood of future #cyberattacks against digital elements of election systems, but we also know #paperballots include vulnerabilities" - @Louisiana_sos

Our adversaries have always sought to use our nation's unique qualities to undermine our democracy. Our voting systems are no exception.
Voting is one of our fundamental democratic rights &amp; is the cornerstone of American democracy.
No one wants to hear about another hack, especially one that undermines our #democracy. Tune in at 2pm EST to see my IT Subcommittee explore the current state of #cybersecurity of our #voting machines. https://t.co/8DEf0SO7cq
