@TheJuanWilliams Bruh this is so stupid
@S7oney @Slasher There is no journalistic accountability when an anonymous person posts things online. Posting things anonymously after someone who trusts you tells you something in confidence is also just an objectively cunty thing to do. I could go on but i need to get back to work
@OvileeMay @TravisGafford If I were you I‚Äôd renegotiate and make him throw in a Crunchyroll subscription. It‚Äôs only right
@Slasher Honestly Rod, this codburner shit was unreal. The amount of people I had to explain to about why it was an uncool thing to do was unbelievable. Please help out the scene
@Clayster @INTELCallofDuty @BenJNissim I‚Äôm on your side with these type of things for sure but the pros baiting on twitter and pros (allegedly) making accounts to bait and spread rumors just doesn‚Äôt help this kind of thing. Sorry you gotta deal with people coming at you tho

@Dexerto @Cloud9 Golden‚Äôs first big event was in like September 2017. Would definitely not consider him a veteran. Also, this headline seems a tad disingenuous considering the personal issue that just arose with flusha. It‚Äôs understandable that he wants to step away from csgo for a little bit.
@100Thieves CG handed us the game on a silver platter after completely destroying us for 20 minutes ***
@dev1ce @astralisgg @ence Devve will show up tomorrow
@Slasher Now here‚Äôs my cunty remark but with the best intentions, remember when you said csgo was slowing down on the dexerto podcast with Richard? Counterstrike is just too good!
@RisenLazarus Lol it‚Äôs been over 10 minutes now
@natu You guys deserve it natu. Hard work pays off. Congratulations and now go win the whole thing!!

@MatthewHammon11 @Thooorin They won the T side on Inferno 10-5 and choked away the 15-9 lead on CT. Why would Stewie entrying cause NAF to not hit a shot on CT side? Dude was just missing mate. Having a different type of player in the server doesn‚Äôt cause you to not be able to shoot heads anymore

@_anthonynash @Shinobi_Tactics @FluxWild1y Okay so 0 policies were put in place by republicans that actively seek to harm black and gay people. Got it. Thank you
@_anthonynash @FluxWild1y @Slasher How is saying that half of the audience dislikes black and gay people not divisive?
@stillgray We do accept everyone for who they are. We‚Äôre all nerds in the end. It makes me sad to see a representative of esports tell me I dislike black and gay people. (Definitely do NOT dislike them)
@_anthonynash @FluxWild1y @Slasher Which laws hurt black or gay people that have been enacted by republican govt?
@DSTattika @Slasher My thoughts exactly

@OpTicH3CZ My dude, i respect you as much as anyone. As a long time fan, i just want to express my disappointment at the org letting Romain walk. That man was amazing. Anyways, i hope all is well. Have a good night g
@RomainBigeard @OpTicGaming Just want to tell @OpTicGaming that you just let the best employee at your organization go. Absolutely despicable.
@Slacked Those colored LED lights are pretty dope but idk if you want those or actual lighting
@OpTicHitch go head davis!!!!
@Methodz @OpTicHitch @FaZeClan @Attach @JamesCrowder @ZooMaa @Priestahh Dude congrats!!
@FaZeApex @KEEMSTAR You mean after Khabib Superman kicked Conor‚Äôs coach? Lmao
@DaDSHoT @AvalancheTwitch @Nadeshot Oh. My. God.
@Blfire Yeah true but now they‚Äôre both criminals when he could have just destroyed Conor in an interview and truly taken over the sport
@TheMighty_Mouse @OpTicHitch Lmao
@Octane_ This is a bad take. Both are wrong
@followdusT He jumped over the cage and was like 5 rows deep. Completely takes away from the win for me. Damn. Won the fight clean and everything
@Independent Still posting this year old garbage? Stuchberry is a joke
@i2Gunless Just messin with you. I‚Äôm just glad they pulled it out!!! Sneaky has been so consistent over the years it‚Äôs actually insane. He gets slept on every year but always pulls through for the team
@i2Gunless Don‚Äôt sleep on the young beard
@TravisGafford Everything‚Äôs fine üòÖüòÖüòÖ

@chhlss Have a good night chief
@RapSheet @nflnetwork @NFLGameDay Why would anyone make this trade right now. Would they not need to wait until free agency to sign him to a long deal due to the franchise tag anyways?
@SamGorman7 They put more chemical than the avg bottled water in their product. I still like it tho! Doesn‚Äôt bother me
@ACHES @KuavoKenny This was all facts
@Methodz You were the best performer on that team. Really sorry it didn‚Äôt work out for you man. Best of luck this year
@nitr0 @Thooorin Good luck tomorrow. Bring it home!!!
@FaZeClan @FaZeAdapt @GFuelEnergy @SteelSeries How‚Äôs the FaZe apparel lawsuit coming along
Fair play to mouz, but beating the 13th, 14th, and 20th ranked teams in bo3s to make it to the final of a big tournament like ESL One New York is underwhelming as fuck. 		cc: @Thooorin @tomi @SPUNJ
@Sliggycsgo @priusCSGO This is a great idea if you feel you have the tools and skills. It should be tried at a smaller event at least
@HanglooseHonker @ESPN_Esports LULULULULULUL

@CarlosR Gotta do something about this failed line up. Smithz is terrible. - bodyy -smithz +nbk +apex
@Tgwri1s Look at how motivated the Americans seem. You can definitely see why flusha would want to go play with such motivated players
@tolkienfanatic @RLewisReports It‚Äôs going to be a long week of this bullshit too
So disappointed in the recent showing from @Cloud9 CS:GO l. It‚Äôs very clear that the American members of the squad aren‚Äôt motivated. Just so disappointing
Another prime example as to why 4:3 in inferior re flusha just now @tomi
@LSXYZ9 Hey LS love ya have a great night/day üòá
@chhlss This is it chief
@Methodz @RiseLoonysan He dropped you
@ACHES @NAMELESS This is a hot ass take I love it. Can‚Äôt wait to see how this year plays out it‚Äôs gonna be a good one

@Nadeshot Would love your perspective on how different the LoL ecosystem is from the cod ecosystem, in terms of being an owner
@joshf4de @Cloud9 @STYKOcsgo @flusha_csgo I hope so brotha we just gotta wait and see
@joshf4de @Cloud9 @STYKOcsgo @flusha_csgo Do you really think skadoodle is a hungry player tho? It‚Äôs just PR bullshit imo. I love Ska I just think this was a last resort for both parties. Flusha got dropped and accepted an NA offer, and C9 has been struggling to find a 5th for months
Can‚Äôt wait for @Thooorin and @RLewisReports to destroy this garbage post on BTN. Hungry players? With Skadoodle on the team? This team has never looked more unmotivated tbh. https://t.co/dEwQ626Ym7
@Cloud9 @STYKOcsgo @flusha_csgo Flusha wants to play with dedicated and hungry players? With Ska in the team? ü§î

@espn @Ninja All y‚Äôall concerned over the minutiae of language are boring as fuck
@Thooorin @RLewisReports Definitely not FACEIT
@OpTicHitch Those are goon numbers
@Xmithie Drinking some milk with some cookies or brownies or cake, can‚Äôt go wrong with that
This is just the Legends stage stats, not both stages. My mistake.
@Dexerto im glad you guys have expanded into game like lol and csgo. props to you guys.
Two things to notice about the maps played and the distribution of side win % in the first 2 stages so far:		1. Dust2 is the most CT sided map this event.		2. Nuke still does not get played. Almost 2 and a half years after being added back into the pool.		cc: @Thooorin @tomi https://t.co/KNF47EvGlp
@Clayster @ZooMaa Can‚Äôt be doing all that now. They‚Äôve got a reputation to maintain
@JackEtienne It was a good interview. Thanks for taking the time to do it. Best of luck next month!!

@catlyncrespo Yes yes
@PunchShot_ @FACEIT @TeamLiquid True, but Astralis are still top ranked and always beat TL, like always
@FACEIT @TeamLiquid 2 NA teams going 3-0

@OpTic_Scumper Hey bud just a heads up you have a SteelSeries logo showing on your stream from your mouse pad. Don't want Turtle Beach or a sponsor to see that. cc: @OpTicH3CZ
@jwCSGO @VegaSquadron very sorry for your loss JW. Best of luck tomorrow. I know she is so proud of you
@100T_Kenny Upside Down by The Story So Far.... vibes bro
@Locodoco Do you think it‚Äôs an advantage to play 2 or 3 series in a row, like FOX or TSM will. Or is it an advantage to wait until Sunday in C9s case. Seems like stage experience could help but also burn out the team
@MonteCristo @FORG1VENGRE You forgot the phase where people just assume everything you say is wrong cause they hate you haha
@i2Gunless Sagittarius gang. Have a great day peirce
okok it fixed after he went offline then back online. just not the first time its happened to me and this channel in particular

@JacobWolf I was celebrating my friends 7th birthday in school when we went into lockdown. We had no clue what was going on and we just wanted to keep having fun. I‚Äôve never forgotten that day

@AlbertAlmodal @TSM_NudeCow @Thooorin Yessir no doubt about that
@LilyPichu Girls don‚Äôt poop
@lilyachty Watch darling in the franxx
@chhlss anime is earth's greatest art form
@JeremyWo1fe @TSM_NudeCow @Thooorin He very well could be
@TSM_NudeCow @Thooorin I think if he ties Bjergsen in championships, then wins 2 or 3 MVPs (Bjergsen has 4), it will be a good debate. Since DL has won on 3 entirely different teams I think that adds a lot to his case. Bjergsen has just dominated NA for too long
@Thooorin After he wins MVP he will only need 3 more to tie bjergsen :&gt; 		In all seriousness, he‚Äôs an amazing player, I‚Äôm pretty excited for these finals. It actually feels like a relatively even match up.
@OvileeMay They‚Äôre pretty great. Have a good night &lt;3
@i2Gunless @i2Nokab What‚Äôs your top 5 bro I‚Äôm putting you on the spot
Darling in the franxx has to be in my top 3 I think

@apbenven Well said. Have a good night
@Thooorin She went full on ‚ÄúI hate white men‚Äù this morning. What a shame
TSM will make it out of the gauntlet. Can‚Äôt see any team beating them outside of TL and C9
@Nadeshot @ZooMaa And to think, I thought we were about to witness a heartfelt moment
@JackEtienne @TSM Congrats Jack. Time to smash the #PaidBySteve squad. Actually a cool narrative, you have developed talent, whereas Liquid bought it. Time to see which team building philosophy is best! That is, if they can get passed ssumgod in the Top Lane
@Reapered Congrats reapered!!!
@Jensen We need a Jensen assassin in finals!!! Congrats can‚Äôt wait to see you win your first title
@RUSH They subbed them in in game 4 but still amazing nonetheless!!! Let‚Äôs go c9!!!
@RLewisReports Can anyone fill me in on which individual this is? Not really up to date on Riots history
@Locodoco @C9Svenskeren @C9Goldenglue Good call on the Braum priority. C9 first picked it until TSM was forced to ban in game 4
@BsportJoshh @i2Gunless LETS GET IT! Who do you like in game 5. #C9WIN
@OpTicHitch This twitter shit doesn‚Äôt happen in big esports. Cod continues to show some big orgs (C9, TL, TSM) that they were right to drop their teams.
@Octane_ @SlasheR_AL @ACHES This type of twitter shit just doesn‚Äôt happen big esports. Let your play talk! Make them regret the decision, this type of stuff just makes them feel better about their choice
@Methodz It‚Äôs whatever bro you were the best performer on that squad. You‚Äôll get picked up by studs
@JackEtienne Good luck to you and the squadron! #C9WIN ~~

@HyenaCalledWill @ProSyndicate Lmao there‚Äôs no way you took that seriously. You ‚Äúflipping idiot‚Äù
@OMGLove The mother and child burned to death, if it couldn‚Äôt get any worse
@ProSyndicate Damn racist
@Cernovich There‚Äôs also a couple hundred thousand watching illegally on twitch. And the big fights haven‚Äôt started yet
@Officialnoted @Slasher Plus a couple hundred thousand watching illegally on twitch
@Slasher It will have more even behind a 10 dollar pay wall
@BrianSaintt Nihill vs an open bracket kid would stomp too
@Stewie @YNk Go head and win the tourney young bull
@PacmanJT Yes bro
@OpTicH3CZ These bulls swingin for sure
@Classify Fool was really awoken
@Slasher NA LCS QF
@OpTicH3CZ i hope he dont get knocked out
@shroud @Warcraft we raiding again this year? last time there was only like 4 of us doing actual dmg lol justin was losing his shit
@Attach @CouRageJD btw the bravo crowd during your eU match at champs was so fun. you guys put on a show for us it was an honor to watch. good luck next year bro
@MissKyliee @MrLlamaSC @_CuteDog_ hey kylie have fun and have a great day
RT @Attach: @sonbasshu @CouRageJD I think we all know who wins that
@Attach @CouRageJD tru tru Dillon Attach the goat
@ProSyndicate they should fix the site so we can purchase it. if ppl cant buy it of course theyre going to look for other means
@jamesbardolph @ecs yo james, have a great day you deserve it
@ProSyndicate been trying to buy for 2 hours its still down for me :(
@Attach @CouRageJD Attach vs artillery strikes
@OpTicHitch aches is still partying bro
@yashar Lol fake Melanias everywhere
@OpTicMBoZe He stole him? Can‚Äôt buy it yet the sites down for me
@MJCheen @CouRageJD Seth is indeed a unit. But courage, he‚Äôs an absolute unit
@OhNoAva_tK This is majestic
@ScottGandhi @NAMELESS @OpTicMBoZe @ACHES I think specialists will define roles more clearly. It could be interesting, could also be a mess for that game mode. I‚Äôm excited to see how the game plays out
@ACHES Unless activision franchises. And if that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs in the OWL partnership that the current owl teams get first dibs at new blizzard ventures (CWL). Then more big orgs will enter and the market will be more competitive. It‚Äôll be just like other big games
@Benson_EU I wish :(
@DMTheory 3pm EST
@RiseLoonysan @Mochila I‚Äôm only on episode 10 currently. I like it tho

@Aktiatiu @SouLjA_v2 @CODWorldLeague @Activision What do you mean integrated twitch streaming? Meaning you can stream from the console? you could do that on the Xbox one for 5 years
@CODWorldLeague Teams only have 2.5 months to pick up a fifth player üòù
@Slasher Rod ‚ÄúSources are my thoughts‚Äù Breslau
@Boogie2988 Hey boogie guess what
@GoldGloveTV Brennon forreal this time.... GUESS WHAT

@Thooorin Already moved into the taking photos of your food phase of ig users. You‚Äôre moving along nicely
@MLGPuckett @EvilGeniuses @MLG @joebradyphoto I was like 5 rows behind you and the most glorious mullet of all time. Great to see you at a cod event. And congrats on a great first season of owl
@KEEMSTAR Bruh both Deji and KSI getting dropped and I dislike the Paul‚Äôs
@Muddawg @JKap415 Dog. How you putting ice in red wine

@iGruesome_ @Phaytalz @ripxboxusers @CWL_Stats @OpTicGaming @OpTic_Crimsix @Methodz @Octane_ @OpTic_Scumper Oh my b I was confused lol
@Samadam24466460 @ripxboxusers @CWL_Stats @OpTicGaming @OpTic_Crimsix @Methodz @Octane_ @OpTic_Scumper All I‚Äôm saying is scump shouldn‚Äôt retire. Regardless of where he plays
@Samadam24466460 @ripxboxusers @CWL_Stats @OpTicGaming @OpTic_Crimsix @Methodz @Octane_ @OpTic_Scumper Lmao I think we‚Äôre on the same page my dude
@ripxboxusers @CWL_Stats @OpTicGaming @OpTic_Crimsix @Methodz @Octane_ @OpTic_Scumper Why?

@Assault Save your money fam buy something cheaper
@JacobWolf @leagueofemily Have you started writing your journalist of the year acceptance piece yet? Jk jk, best of luck
@ValorClub83 @JasonBWLake @PostMalone Lol what would you like him to do
@ScottGandhi @ACHES @JoeDeLuca @JPKrez Why don‚Äôt other teams take advantage of the veto process tho? Makes no sense to me
@JacobWolf @leagueofemily You‚Äôve made some great strides in your career this year as well. Really really enjoyed your long form pieces. Loved the Adam silver piece and the piece on Dallas
@NWhinston Idk have you ever seen pre schoolers argue? So much passion. Shit is real
@NAMELESS @AccuracyLA @KuavoKenny ‚ÄúThe Antagonists‚Äù
@GoldGloveTV Damn. I was gonna say chicken butt :( 		I hope you are doing well. Have a great night

@Nadeshot @JKap415 Yo Nade, first of all, congrats on an amazing inaugural season of LCS. Second, can‚Äôt wait to see what squadron you pick up for bo4. Best of luck
@inerolol I also hate how synergy is used so much. People just cling to buzz words I think
@Bjergsen You got it King
@OpTic_Scumper @OpTicMBoZe https://t.co/u6Namhtvg9
@yashar lol what a joke, if hes going to be a public figure with influence, he also needs to be held accountable. Keep doing what you do, it is appreciated
@JKap415 yo kap, you finna ball next year?
@Enable @KuavoKenny young lord
@OpTic_Scumper The Return of the King
@OpTic_DKarma No bro. Pointless
I got to see Patrick Price lift a world championship trophy. So happy. Congrats boyos @ACHES @Assault @silly702 @Apathy_BZ
@MrAdamAp This was my first event ever. After 12 years of fandom. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better event. Great job Adam
@Bjergsen @TSM @lolHauntzer @TSM_Grig @mithytsm @LoLZven The handsome squadron
@Slasher Thanks for this

@FormaL 2 rings
@HollyyLive We used to blow torch them to make sure we killed them all lol. You can‚Äôt stomp them
@Censor LETS GET IT THEN DOUGLAS!!!!!
@Reedy_1905 This game aint shit lmao
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA TOP 16 @SlasheR_AL @i2Gunless @TJHaLy @RiseLoonysan
@Censor I respect the dedication doug.
@JasonBWLake @Censor @DashySZN @Ricky @Blazt @JeremyStuD Insane dedication was shown this year. Excited to see what happens in black ops 4.
@JasonBWLake @PapaCensor Best of luck. I want Doug to win it all
@SkyWilliams Yo sky forreal guess what
@yashar @Ocasio2018 Taking a page out of the trump handbook with that ‚Äúnon story‚Äù phrase
@OMGLove Holy shit guess what
@TylorMiddy @ax3ed @Octane_ @zCxtalyst LMFAO
@CODWorldLeague Elevate over LG probably
@yashar Saw a local on Facebook defending her stance to not vaccinate.... She claims that it shouldn't matter if she doesn't vaccinate her children since the rest of us will. I do not understand these people
@MajorManiak good shit, now you gotta beat tK/Rise
@Maux419 good shit bro, keep it up
@Octane_ lol beams i think they were syaing
@TeamJuJu Ain‚Äôt the beta over? Or you got blackout beta codes??
Lmao beams @formal
@Maven Where was the best flex at that map?? Jeeeeezzzz you don‚Äôt like to see that
DOG YOU GOT SMOOOOOOOKED MAP ONE @i2Gunless
@NAMELESS @CTunn_ @RichWCampbell @JessBrohard Jess bro
@OpTicLoL @OvileeMay Aweeeee how sweet @OvileeMay
@PacmanJT I loved the best of 7s. Makes it harder for teams to straight ‚Äú2,3,5‚Äù all the time
@chhlss Oh word the second part is bracket stage. I was confused I thought you meant to get out of groups. I think the GSL format is the best, then reseeded Swiss system. For brackets I like single elim
@chhlss Elimination
@chhlss Wait what? How can you run a Swiss system with only one loss given? That‚Äôs brutal lol and also round robin means you play everyone so there‚Äôs no single or double eliminated
@RomainBigeard @RivingtonThe3rd Hey Romain, just want to tell you that I really appreciate your hard work ethic and all that you bring to OpTic Gaming. I hope to see you with the green wall for years and years to come
@Thooorin Yo dog, just wanted to say I appreciate your work, despite of how many people are seemingly trying to end your career. I‚Äôll still be here reading your articles and watching your videos.
@PhilWhi7 @FormaL @LG_J0hn @Parasite @JamesCrowder @Attach @Clayster @Apathy_BZ @ACHES @SlasheR_AL How could you forget the MVP mr Matthew Piper
@Censor @Goonjar yo doug, i hope you win champs man. best of luck
@RalDaddy @Maven i just think if theres a tie a tie breaker should be played, rather than map count, but there's a lot of logistical problems that come with that im sure. I just like the LoL Worlds groups format
@CouRageJD @OpTicMaNiaC @ItsFearItSelf @Ninja @JacobHysteria @VictoryCJT that fool was blaining everyone lol
@Artur_B91 @PhilWhi7 @HusKerrs RIP champs lol. Was a great year, i miss best of 7 series also, i hope blops4 has enough maps and modes for bo7
@Slasher Nice save at the end there. Love to see it
@sighberta should be a tie breaker match! fuck a map count. Games like LoL have tie breaker matches to get out of groups. I guess its just cause they don't play series in groups but like come on
@Octane_ @OpTic_Crimsix Stick together bros. You are all so talented. Much love, thanks for competing for us
@ACHES @Slasher Isn't this the event you beat them is 2 bo7s with 1.5 thumbs tho? HARD AF
@ali cant wait!!
@PhilWhi7 @HusKerrs Back when there was like 12 events or something in circuit. So much cod to watch! Great times
@OpTic_Crimsix Dog, I can't wait to see you come out with the fire next year. As a Green Wall fan, I am incredibly thankful for all that you've done for the org these last 4 titles. Keep your head up man, you are the best to ever play the game
@eGoTheIcoN @OpTicMBoZe spill the beans
@OpTicMBoZe this is why communites like Smash Melee are still thriving, the community has each others backs. Not saying there isn't banter, cause there is, but it's all love at the end of the day
@RalDaddy Why isn't there an actual tie breaker game in groups? Makes no sense
@RalDaddy Yes bro
@OpTic_Scumper Brother, you have been a GOD at everry cod besides this game. Please, try to compete in blops4 if your heart is still in it. If your heart is in it, THE GREEN WALL HAS YOUR BACK. Much love, king
@kenzliee I hope everything turns out ok. heartbroken for the king
@G2NBK @Tommey Vitality NBK
@stillgray @Thooorin I can't wait to see how this doesn't affect his career in the slightest
@waypoint I can't wait to see how this doesn't affect his career in the slightest
@waypoint lmao this is a fucking joke
@itsEmminem @Defianttt_ @Slacked I mean do you know that? Cause I'm under the impression that LG declined the trade
@RalDaddy @KuavoKenny @Xposedlive get on that og coaching staff lmao
@PacmanJT @Slacked lol and just cause optic got rekt doesnt mean LG didn't decline, they definitely declined. This is just a hard L from slacked
@Slacked L
@HollyyLive i would love to hear damons side. From our perspective it just seems like they had a lot of internal problems and thats why he was dropped
@OhhRogerr that is insane bro wtf
@Octane_ Stay on OpTic my brotha. Zinni octane and crim is a great core to have. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with the king. Breaks my heart
@PacmanJT @HollyyLive Who got the screenshot
@Nadeshot Please pick up scump when he gets dropped
@PhilWhi7 I hope the long doesn‚Äôt retire but I do not believe he is good enough to stay on the OpTic roster and I highly doubt he‚Äôd play for another org..... unless it‚Äôs 100T
@autimaticTV Let‚Äôs get it then
@Octane_ Please keep carrying me Zinni
@OpTicMBoZe @Methodz @JKap415 @Slacked @Clayster @NAMELESS My hand ain‚Äôt flexible enough lmao
@PaulChaloner An absolute unit
@MrAdamAp @NlCKARTS This dude ruined my surprise this weekend. damn
@JacobWolf @Anti They run both the Halo and Gears of War circuits. So there‚Äôs a chance
@NAFEDUDE That‚Äôs literally not the point. The point is he can do whatever he wants to do if he believes it‚Äôs best for his family. And protect as in internet abuse, not literal violence lmao you nonce
@Nadeshot @100Thieves It sucks C9 is about to take your first round bye in LCS tho üòÜ
@BlizzardCS My main is on Illidan, therefore i can't login/play. Why can't I switch servers and play on an alt? I don't understand

@jamesbardolph @NiPGaming Bugged currently
@MadamLegend Shut your fucking mouth
@RLewisReports @Aiomon Good luck with this one mate
@eXalt_truth @ACHES If Activision Blizzard decide to create a franchised league as they did with Overwatch, then a players association would form and these types of things will be taken care of through that. We must have patience, and help make a case for Activision to franchise
@Kardious L
@chhlss Just seems like orgs aren‚Äôt willing to take a chance on college grads who haven‚Äôt worked in the space yet, hopefully this changes with all of the infrastructure coming in to NA orgs
@chhlss Hire new people and not recycle the same ppl throughout the esports scene. Experience is important of course but we‚Äôve seen so many ppl let go from one org only to get a job at the next one
@OregonBeast_GT @karonmoser @0urea @joyoflogic @Froskurinn What is she defending?
@CNN It‚Äôs because they tried socialism
@Mochila This is normal af wtf

@Classify We went ham on nufo
@Bjergsen You got this dude. 4 straight wins
@Thooorin @JacobWolf @RickFox Sucks for OpTic giving up majority ownership for $35M one year ago with these new valuations
@JacobWolf I‚Äôm so confused with these team valuations. OpTic gives up a majority ownership for $35M but then Echo Fox is valued at ~$200? Damnn
@RNGRoyal @SAM_E1011 @OpTicGaming Awesome contribution to the community

@Zaboutine Playoffs nexts step
@chhlss Your avi is heavenly
@Cernovich @Bernstein I don‚Äôt understand what mike did wrong. Didn‚Äôt he just report on bad tweets? Isn‚Äôt his job to report on things in public interest?

@Thooorin still down
@Reedy_1905 @OpTicHitch @MarkyB @NAMELESS i think Drake is like a top 3 artist in the world right now, behind pop stars like Taylor Swift and shit, i dont think 50 was ever that big
@OpTicHitch @Reedy_1905 @MarkyB @NAMELESS lmaoooo i was just about to say that
@OpTicHitch @MarkyB @Reedy_1905 @NAMELESS LOLLLLLLLLL Drake is one of the biggest artists in the world, 50 in his prime still is not close to the reach Drake has right now.... and i like 50 way more
@Seamy__ @CODWorldLeague @TheRiseNation @RedReserve one of these teams are gonna tear through losers then
@CODWorldLeague @TheRiseNation @RedReserve sheeeesh, its double elim tho right??
@TheRiseNation @UNILADEsports are you locked in as the 4 seed now?

@kurteichenwald @DrRandPaul Government agencies != America
@GenghisJohn_ @DeepWaterLife @PJHofer07 @DevoDinero @xG4Qx @LeVeonBell If you think a back deserves 17M/yr and 50M guaranteed then you don‚Äôt know the RB market. He‚Äôs one of my favorite players but he‚Äôs out of his mind with this deal
@LeVeonBell Bro you ain‚Äôt getting paid 50m guaranteed by NO team. Stay with the Steelers god damn
@nytopinion NYT IS HOMOPHOBIC. THIS IS OFFENSIVE HOLY COW THINK OF WHAT YOURE DOING TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY
@RiseLoonysan @Potthoff Jet pack games xD

@neLendirekt @G2apEX @bubblen1CSGO Nobody ever has a problem like this until the team wins. If they lost in groups, no one would say a word. Ppl just salty that France won
@DonHaci Lul racist

@vault_boy101 @esportsawards @RLewisReports @JacobNWolf @Thooorin @FionnOnFire @TravisGafford @DexertoMike @Slasher @leagueofemily @dekay @LaureBuliiV He literally won the category last year. What do you mean?
@Thooorin If @JacobWolf doesn‚Äôt win this year, than the voters just don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
@Thooorin Real talk, is Slasher even a journalist anymore?
@efronovaa @jason_button @DonHaci So all parental guidance just magically stops at 18? Can he afford to move out and move into his own place on his 18th birthday? Highly unlikely that he will be LAN ready at 18. Just my opinion, I hope he succeeds.
@DonHaci He doesn‚Äôt talk
@DonHaci Plebs thinking it‚Äôs gonna only be on Facebook LUL
@ali Did Tommy break the law? I‚Äôm uninformed on the topic
@Shadypenguinn @Rhymestyle This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen

@chhlss Why you always with bowser then
RT @SmittyBarstool: Look, LeSean McCoy has always been a shitbag of a human.  Not tipping, among many other examples, justifies that fact.‚Ä¶
@DonHaci @neLendirekt Damn I didn‚Äôt think he played it that often then. Maybe once in a while. I‚Äôm just saying dude doesn‚Äôt know shit about the actual game haha
@neLendirekt The idea that you can‚Äôt possibly understand something in depth without being an expert or pro in it is so delusional imo
@DonHaci @neLendirekt Thorin doesn‚Äôt even play the game
@Alyssa_Milano I mean rock bottom was undoubtedly the civil war
@DonHaci Lol sadokist said Navi lost starladder twice. Dude doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on
@RealBrittHughes This is why conservatives lose

@Classify God damn wtf is this
@DonHaci There‚Äôs no way you think Zeus is a good fragger. But I appreciate the thorin troll
@Clayster Rift Rivals cause EU is trash
@Slasher It‚Äôs not really even that close. No esport offers round by round, consistent excitement like csgo does

@JacobWolf This is just the worst trade on paper, in my opinion. What an absolute risk for 100T
@FionnOnFire Cough cough TSM
@FionnOnFire @RiotAzael @100Thieves Was just thinking how could this work since Levi was an import. Wow this trade is so risky
@LoLZven @MeteosLoL Please get this contract on TSM. Trade Mike or Grig for him
@FionnOnFire Why the fuck would FlyQuest trade for him???
@MeteosLoL Yo what????????????!!!?
@OpTicMBoZe He‚Äôs still announcing officially on Tuesday i think
@Licorice you tried man, next weekend
@OpTicHitch @est_glen lol it's not like you were specifically referring to a race of ppl when you said that, so which race would you even be telling to leave???? the fuck???
@BNellyNelson jesus
@Cernovich not at all
@OpTicHitch Would be cool to pick your brain on a few political topics, seems like you're starting to look into different ideas and policy and what not
@OpTicHitch If you dare to go against their status quo, then you are a racist/homophobe/transphobe, etc. It's quite harmful dialogue in my opinion
@KyleKashuv @joshuatopolsky both homophobic and anti semitic, wowzers

@OpTicHitch @bookworm7894 just stay in your lane, buddy. xD
@OpTicHitch @z0mgItsHutch I feel you man, it's frustrating seeing this blatant hate on the country, without people actually offering any reasonable solutions. Just screaming how awful they think it is here
@OpTicHitch @z0mgItsHutch im absolutely with you on this, Davis!
@z0mgItsHutch i just think he means when people talk about how terrible it is here, despite us having some of the best quality of life humans have ever had. of course, we can always be better so we should be speaking up for what we believe, but i think he  means the whole "america sucks" thing
@Dinglederper thx for the boobs
@lex_looper I can‚Äôt believe so many ppl believe this
@OhNoAva_tK Sorry this happened üòû
@conservmillen Cray Cray insane in the membrane
@NAMELESS @K1Ila You need to bring on guests from other games
@Kevin_Hitt @benshapiro Times are getting crazier
@kurteichenwald Do you actually believe what you tweet
I hope @benshapiro gets nominated
@z0mgItsHutch @OpTicHitch In my opinion if the dems can nominate someone moderate and likable that ppl can believe in, trump will lose. But honestly that doesn‚Äôt seem too likely, so it should be very close again given trump doesn‚Äôt royally fuck up/mueller finds something awful
@DotEsports hes also a great academy player
@greta NO
@tomi @Thooorin HLTV top 5 in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Way more conceivable that he returns to a decent level whereas smithzz has been absolute shit and took a year off
@K1Ila Kids fall and kids get hurt my man. I don‚Äôt think anyone on the internet can help you. Each scenario needs to be looked at individually. Only the ppl who know the guardian at the time can make that call
@KEEMSTAR Haha I have it and I have no complaints so far
@LxthuL For some reason playing h3 on MCC feels like complete and utter ass. I can‚Äôt remember if online was just as shit back on the 360

@KEEMSTAR @OpTicDi3seL @UMGEvents @TSM_Myth Eat him again
@SenGillibrand Your job is to legislate. You should be prepared to legislate

@Dardochlol ‚ÄòAve a fine day, me lad
@justinjm1 LOL DUDE THERES NO WAY YOU DIDNT DO THIS ON PURPOSE. INSTANTLY LOST CREDIBILITY
@nytopinion So you support the oppression of Asian students? Good to know
@JJP7191 @PacmanJT @DannyTlais @moneyrick_ If you are both moving at the exact same speed of 25mph the entire time, you will both get there at the exact same time
@JJP7191 @PacmanJT @DannyTlais @moneyrick_ Because the distance required for John wall to reach his top speed is greater than the distance of the court. If two objects are moving at the same speed then they‚Äôre moving at the same speed man it doesn‚Äôt matter what size or weight. Speed = distance divided by time, that‚Äôs it
@JJP7191 @PacmanJT @DannyTlais @moneyrick_ If they both ran a 40 yard dash at the same speed, we can say 20 mph. They would finish at the exact same time. I think I just got baited cause cmon man
@JJP7191 @PacmanJT @DannyTlais @moneyrick_ The number 25 is bigger than the number 20 my dude
@NuFo Lawd
Just wanted to let you know @AMCTheatres that I‚Äôll be sticking with @MoviePass :) much more affordable and I can use it at my local theater. AMC this is a giant FAIL for you
@kurteichenwald none of them? you know how all of them think?
@DonHaci Gonna be depressing to see how many views it gets on Facebook. Should be one of the biggest and most watched of the year but nahhh
@catlyncrespo We all do
@Classify Dm
@ScottGandhi @bobman22 Just goes to show you how disingenuous the reporting has been. The press has it out for gamers, even the casual ones it seems.
@ScottGandhi The actual report from the WHO made no mention of 20hrs. That‚Äôs just some disingenuous reporting from the BBC and others who decided to repeat that narrative. Check out @RLewisReports new video from today about it.
@kurteichenwald Isn‚Äôt congress working on a bill to change this law currently? Seems like it won‚Äôt be happening for too much longer
@kurteichenwald I mean I just don‚Äôt think anyone reasonable is saying they want children separated from parents
@conservmillen @benshapiro This is the greatest
RIP X even tho he was a terrible person
@OhNoAva_tK Also I didn‚Äôt mean to come off like a dick, if I did. Have a great day
@OhNoAva_tK Oh for sure. Definitely knew a couple kids I used to play WoW with who were absolutely addicted to the point of disorder. Had to be held back and missed dozens of school days, stuff like that. Actual life ruining behavior
@OhNoAva_tK I mean I was agreeing with you
@OhNoAva_tK Anything that releases dopamine into your brain can be addictive. This goes for absolutely anything, think cracking your knuckles or something like that
@KEEMSTAR @RealmRoyale But you just tweeted it
@k0nfigCS @theimperialgg haha rekt by imperial
@kurteichenwald You watch tentacle porn
@MACHINEgg @BBCTech Lol I‚Äôve put in 20 hour days before. Best sign me up for this addiction

@FormaL It‚Äôs crazy how much better you played when you seem to care more
@Kevin_Hitt @Thooorin I agree
@seangares @SPUNJ yeah forreal and why are they cooked?????
@TLDoublelift 3D chess levels of bailing
@tomi Just cut* btw. But yes, absolutely. I would argue most viewers probably take a break from watching at some point during the series
@Kevin_Hitt B-b-but my feelings
@tomi I love csgo. But I don‚Äôt think I could watch a full, close 5 game series. Hard to just just 6 hours out of a day
@OpTicHitch damn if only mw2 wasnt trash
@Zaboutine Some rough mechanical mistakes, nothing you guys can't iron out. Good luck next weekend
@CNN How dare you promote this violent game which teaches children to be aggressive and violent. SHAME ON YOU
@PPFA OMEGALUUUUULLLLLLLLLLL WHAT ABOUT THE DADS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE NEVER BORN BECAUSE YOU KILLED THEM HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IRONY IS BAFFLING
@OpTicLoL @Akaadian If only Dhokla hit his Ornn ults
@AP How many times has this happened
@messioso I don‚Äôt think anyone prominent has been calling it innovative by any means though. If they did, they‚Äôre mistaken
@Shadypenguinn CONGRATS üéâ
@Slasher Context?
@eSportsProducer @Lunalovebadxo @skrapzg Lol
@Methodz You were the best player on the squad this weekend. Head up. Focus up for stage 2. Good job man
@TylerTeeP explain to the boys how to play 4v3 situations. So many times today they got the first blood and still lost the round.
@OpTic_Scumper All these kids in these replies are lost.
@FionnOnFire @overwatchleague Pretty steep if you want to attend most of the matches
@Slasher But she was remarkably average
@SternRuinedNBA @Clayster I am assuming you are an eunited fan, news flash, you are wasting your time watching a team that will NEVER win an event in this game..
@Clayster hahaha get rekt loser, you guys are dog meat
Zinni is the best in the game @Methodz
@jimmykimmel This cat lost to ted Cruz
I think you can carry today, let‚Äôs go!! @PowerOfEvilLoL

@Zaboutine GG keep it up. Playoffs this split!!
@Hai Cringe fest
Just want to say thanks to @CODGamepedia for keeping up with these open events. So helpful since MLG/CWL does such a poor job with keeping people updated on twitter
Hahahahaha fuck you!!! @hardwick
@OpTic_Scumper They were frying. Ggs
@____Tech____ @DonHaci Fugly has been performing decent but I still think he would be great for NRG -fugly
You‚Äôre insane @n0thing
@DonHaci I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs showing he can still hang. NRG or even mouz should hop on that
@OpTicH3CZ Are you in another country? What‚Äôs up with that
@dekay @Kevin_Hitt How did he publish bad information if the information was proven to be correct at the time of the report. Things change, and dekay is usually the first to admit that
@Maj3r_ This is an awesome letter. Good luck in next tournaments

@SinnuR_ @NICKMERCS @NAMELESS @DexertoIntel The game being free absolutely matters????????? They give the consumer the CHOICE whether or not they want to spend money on items that don‚Äôt even have a competitive benefit. They don‚Äôt force you to pay $60 for the base game then $50 for a season pass if you want all maps
@DonHaci @Thooorin Ableist
@CODWorldLeague Rise Nation beats OpTic Gaming in the finals. From the winners bracket
@DonHaci I don‚Äôt want him to go :(
@Benson_EU Russia 2 - Saudi Arabia 0
@TravisGafford @karonmoser @Armitage2112 This is fair
@JacobWolf @Cloud9 @C9Goldenglue @keithmcbrief @Zeyzal This is honestly sad @JackEtienne :(
@RiotJatt All I know is that if Sneaky and Smoothie go to OpTic, which frees up an import slot that can be used in the Top Lane, OpTic would be a serious playoff contender. I hope the move doesn‚Äôt encourage any of the player to leave the org, and instead motivated them to work harder
@Cloud9 I definitely understand hard managerial decisions. The best players at the moment should start. However, I hope none of the players decide to leave the org because of this. That Bot Lane could make OpTic a playoff contender
@NAMELESS @JeremyStuD @PostMalone Complexity is heavily invested in by the Dallas Cowboys, and Post Malone‚Äôs dad works for the Cowboys. That‚Äôs my educated guess
@Smoothie @Sneaky @Jensen Go to OpTic with Sneaky and use the import slot you free up in the top lane. OpTic top 3 confirmed
@FionnOnFire Sven is tilting already
@Sneaky You should go to OpTic with Smoothie. And use the import slot you will free up in the Top Lane. OpTic top 3 confirmed
@FionnOnFire @RiotAzael Sneaky and Smoothie to OPT. Frees up and import slot to use in the Top Lane. OPT to playoffs guaranteed
@KeatonNA Sneaky and Smoothie to OPT, frees up an import slot to use in the Top Lane. OPT top 3 confirmed.
@Cloud9 Woahhhhhh I hope none of the boys want to leave the team because of this. And how does Sven feel about this move?
@DonHaci Expected LUL

@kanyewest Careful of number 7
@KaitMarieox Well this is a stupid tweet
@benshapiro They act like Daisy Ridley didn‚Äôt also get bullied off of Instagram, despite being white.
@Mememaster64__ @DonHaci Wow that‚Äôs crazy I thought it was EU
@DonHaci Not as dominant but C9 went 25-1 in ESL pro league season 4. Then went 4-1 in group stage, and only lost the one map to SK in the finals. Overall went 35-3
@Boogie2988 Lmaoooo
@karriganCSGO I hope your team can get back to form soon! Even with a stand in you can contend for titles

First games in a week what‚Äôs the roster @OpTicLoL
@CalebHowe You‚Äôre late!
@DonHaci Shoulda took the under for smithzz 10 frags
@OpTicHitch @FrostyBB @OpTicCreate Damn that‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs not the worst cod by any means. Cod3 exists. But 2nd worst without a doubt
@OpTicHitch Forreal. The people want a smooth warfare style br
@DonHaci Over under 10 frags this map for SmithZz?
@ItsAdrin @BuddderKing @RemZEU @iplayinsdtv @ACHES ‚ÄúMeant for competitive‚Äù bro is that why we need to ban half the game before we can play competitively? It‚Äôs made for the casual player, who makes up a vast majority of the player base
@HLTVorg LMAAAOOOOOOOOO THINKS CARLOS IS GONNA LET THEM BE SHIT FOR A YEAR??!?! They need to see some results sooner than that. I hope they do
@Thooorin I agree. But they could have won in 12 maps, with double the teams in attendance
@jwCSGO You were a beast this event
@SirScoots @OnFireAnders And they‚Äôd win so much more if states would just let us bet :)
@yashar @David_Leavitt Yup. Definitely a piece of shit
@jud3vill Get well soon!
@Dyrus @Anti Yeah I had like 3 white friends named Marcus growing up
@neLendirekt LG are a really good team too
@Independent This is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read
@Thooorin That is just too much
The @ShanghaiDragons is an utter disgrace to the OWL. Unbelievable how they haven‚Äôt picked up a single win
@Ericissmexy People defending this are trash
@jenjd2 @StephenAtHome They did the same thing to Daisy Ridley in December 2015/ Jan 16. Before he was in office. It‚Äôs just mad Star Wars fans
@justatrumptroll @StephenAtHome Normally I‚Äôd agree but they did the same thing to Daisy Ridley in December 2015/Jan 16. Before he was in office. It‚Äôs just mad Star Wars fans
@StephenAtHome They did the same thing to Daisy Ridley
@OpTicGaming @MarkyWap @BaldyKun @DramasFN @WizKayTV Oh god lol

@OpTicHitch Parasite, Clay, Aches, Scump, KiLLa
@OpTicHitch @ACHES @JoeDeLuca You had FormaL at 6

@LxthuL @RealSkipBayless Let‚Äôs go TJ
@_PuffOnThis Rick Ross: ‚ÄúI took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain‚Äôt even know it‚Äù
@ItsMasBro @LimonSZN @Clayster Lmao this is getting stolen
@_iKissANDTell @MattReeceEtsu @imemdoc @ariahmonet_ @HewittLexy @Zachmartinez03 They point made was that they only shoot black people. And that‚Äôs just not true and can be backed up by simple facts. Some cops suck really bad, that‚Äôs the problem
@JKap415 Ppl think choosing the first or last option is too cliche so they decided on the middle two
@Clayster Boi if you never took a gang of chipotle napkins home to wipe then you were never a broke college student üòÇ
@jackiembouvier Well this is a dumb tweet
@RiseLoonysan Drink it
@YNk Let‚Äôs go Steelers!! Bout to be a good season I‚Äôm excited to see what our offense will look like without Martavis but with James Washington
@chelseahandler Why haven‚Äôt we seen any coverage on this? Where is this taking place
@nberlat @Boogie2988 Holy shit I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to miss the point by such a wide margin. Nice work
@ScottGandhi @RangerRegan Dude congrats
@esportslaw Seems to me that they don‚Äôt want to use the serum BECAUSE the truth will come out. Without it, they can dictate the outcomes as they please. Damn even the wizarding world is corrupt
@esportslaw Likewise when harry is tried about the underage magic case, they didn‚Äôt believe that there were dementors. Why not just use the damn veritaserum instead of trusting the word of an elderly woman
@denny_semko why you deleting that tweet to @sjokz??? Cause you actually got called out on your bullshit? Laughable. Accept the consequences of your stupid actions
@tomi @olofmeister @dmorey After watching Houston this year it‚Äôs where I want him to end up. Would be pretty awesome
@Benson_EU It was
@stillgray @Shanenopolis What an absolute fucking scumbag. FUCK YOU SHANE
@ChampagnePapaaa @FORG1VENGRE Well you‚Äôre a terrible human
@tomi @olofmeister How would you feel about him going to Houston
@olofmeister @tomi Best basketball player of all time
@Pamaj How do you feel about the name of the Washington ‚ÄúRedskins‚Äù
@Rbdawgs123 @m0E_tv @PolishAndyCx @DonHaci Is this a troll
@jwCSGO @SirScoots @Thooorin Seems to be a pretty straight forward sponsorship approach. Not sure why the community is making it out to be awful, especially if it doesn‚Äôt hinder qualifications/league matches
@GamerOnPC @gostruck @Thooorin Lol is hyperX scummy for giving players money to exclusively use their equipment?
@JesusStabby @guardian Yeah, that‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs a joke
@BrandyZadrozny @RealCandaceO @NBCNews Do people in your industry notice how big of a problem it is that you‚Äôre all losing the public trust? No one believes this horse crap anymore
@MonteCristo Pineapple doesn‚Äôt belong on pizza but I don‚Äôt judge so you can put whatever you want on your pizza
@RiseLoonysan The rockets deserved to win
@guardian Britain is a joke. God bless the 1A
@GoldGloveTV Damn what a dumbass.
@DonHaci Can‚Äôt believe they got him in the first place.
@eugenegu Try logging out then searching his twitter account
@Clayster @OpTic_Crimsix Clearly 2 different arcs in 2 different sagas
@TeamEnVyUs Damn this was a cold departure for sure. Csgo is next I presume
@TravisAllen02 Trump got Kim to return 3 detainees to their families, without having to give anything back to them. We aren‚Äôt the country in trouble, we need nothing from them.
@Fwiz Cavs in 6
@Slasher That Ironsight game actually looked pretty cool too
@JacobNWolf @stockx Kinda hard to not feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äújust an investment‚Äù to him and that he doesn‚Äôt really care about esports. Nevertheless, thankful for his contributions so far
@RobertRayhart @Nadeshot @OpTicGaming He‚Äôs making a reference to the 100T LCS jerseys
@elonmusk Please do this
@RealCandaceO Lol @DonCheadle will not do it. None of them will
Covering my ears is not the same thing as covering your mouth
@B1GaNasty @Boogie2988 All I know is it‚Äôs exactly what I want as a fan of the franchise since 2005. And I‚Äôve wanted a legit BR with good mechanics since I started playing h1z1 in 2015.
@redsteeze Absolutely absurd ruling
@AlinityTwitch Lmaooooooooooo the TMARTN approach
@neLendirekt Damn idk the French politics so well but I‚Äôm disappointed NBK turned this team down. I know he doesn‚Äôt get along with some of them but jeeeez

@TheeMarkZ I can‚Äôt believe that kid said to get rid of international play
@KyleKashuv Congrats man, keep studying hard
@theMasonRamsey @PostMalone I‚Äôm glad so many people are making fun of a kids birthmark. Y‚Äôall are trash for that
Only 9% of BO3 players completed the campaign. So how are they going against their base by not including campaign in BO4 and giving people what they want, a BR map? @Boogie2988
@DonHaci Asking the important questions. But those are rookie numbers. You‚Äôre gonna need to pump those numbers up https://t.co/zTE1YTz44P
@neLendirekt @coldyXF I‚Äôm really interested to see how the French scene plays out. Feels like CS is missing something without a French team contending for titles
@miakhalifa @Austin_Police As long as you get the retweets and twitter clout
@neLendirekt @coldyXF Do you think smithzz deserves to be on team 1? Just curious about your thoughts
@Boogie2988 And fortnites br map in infinitely more replayable than their save the world mode that you have to pay for
@Boogie2988 Explain? The fan base wants a BR mode? And the fan base doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about campaign, almost overwhelmingly

@mmmirele @pirpirikos @benshapiro You‚Äôre wrong. Enforced monogamy in this instance just means that we should not allow polygamy. NOT THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE FORCED TO DO ANYTHING

@DexertoIntel @skrapzg Hopefully the cod community can learn from this and players will make sure the contracts are fair before they sign them. 		i.e a true buyout clause
@TalkingGrapps @Bricetacular @skrapzg @esportslaw I completely understand what you‚Äôre saying. But players still sign stupid contracts and allow themselves to get taken advantage of
@Bricetacular Makes no sense why they don‚Äôt at least have a lawyer like @esportslaw look over the contract
@TalkingGrapps @Bricetacular @skrapzg @esportslaw https://t.co/wAb8hy1ppl
@Bricetacular @skrapzg @esportslaw If anyone would know, it would be Bryce!
@Bricetacular @skrapzg You‚Äôd think so, but an org can still deny the buyout money depending on the contract. Just happened in csgo where SK Gaming were willing to buy out s1mple and had the money ready but NaVi still refused

@solis_steve @ltgins @RepCummings Trump was talking out of his ass there because it suited him politically. That‚Äôs what they all do. Anything to make the opposition look worse
@ltgins @RepCummings Trump is absolutely hypocritical. But so is everyone in our government. Not that that makes it right, but that we need a big change in leadership
@DonHaci Tell my why all thorins collars look like bacon
@ltgins @RepCummings I do not approve of the bombing of Syria, but to pretend that this bombing was illegal or not within the commander in chiefs power is just silly.
@rightinthemidd3 @legendaryriss @RepCummings Lol absolutely not. The constitution always works. Check out the War Powers Act of 1973
@legendaryriss @RepCummings Congress hasn‚Äôt declared war since ww2. Korean conflict, Vietnam, iraq, all of them were within the right of the commander in chief to act. The precedent has been set long ago
@RepCummings Congress hasn‚Äôt declared war since ww2. Almost every president since has ordered the use of military force.

Hey @GFuelEnergy are you aware that the owner of @TeamKaliber has had sexual intercourse with an employee of his? Just wondering if you condone this behavior.
@Crossfire_CWL @KOSDFF Lol yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm telling you. It‚Äôs not good business ethics. Especially when your revenue comes from representing other brands via sponsorships.
