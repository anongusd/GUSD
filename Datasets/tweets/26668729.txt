@RichardGrenell That might’ve pushed Reagan to work longer and harder to bring Russia into compliance before withdrawing. Or maybe it wouldn’t have. No one can know. But these tweets do not represent pro-Russian positioning.
@RichardGrenell Would Reagan have withdrawn from his own treaty when faced with a Russian violation? 	It's an interesting hypothetical. The treaty is celebrated at Reagan memorials and historical sites as a critical part of his legacy. (I visited one this summer aboard the USS Ronald Reagan)
@NoahPollak That might’ve pushed Reagan to work longer and harder to bring Russia into compliance before withdrawing. Or maybe it wouldn’t have. No one can know. But getting worked up about this tweet and hurling ad hominem attacks like this is juvenile 3/3

South Korea's reaction would be interesting. The progressive Moon administration is not a fan of civilian nuclear energy in general, so presumably they would be opposed to this as well.
The added benefit for Trump is it tweaks China, which doesn't want Moscow to become a major energy supplier on the Peninsula.
He doesn't like paying for things, &amp; if a third party is willing to fork over money to sweeten the deal, he might like it, said Victor Cha. “Previous admins have not welcomed these Russian overtures, but with Trump, you never know b/c he doesn’t adhere to traditional thinking."

Abrams was pardoned by George W. Bush. He went on to become a major critic of Trump saying in 2016 that Republicans have “nominated someone who cannot win and should not be the president of the United States.” Notice the title of the article: https://t.co/C17x7ivqv6

so we're seeing two different Boltons. One is the man enshrining Trump's withdrawal order in a disciplined bureaucratic way, and the other is a Bolton explaining the withdrawal in an open-ended way the Pentagon is apparently not adhering to &amp; doesn't seem to match Trump's words
When asked about this, a defense official tells WSJ "We don't take orders from Bolton." However, the very withdrawal order the Pentagon is implementing was actually signed by Bolton in a classified December memo following the president's decision to pull out, sources tell me 2/

The notion of Kim as the ultimate Decider is also reinforced by the total  absence of any working-level meetings despite the presence of Allison Hooker and Amb. Sung Kim. NK clearly favors the idea that Trump and to a lesser extent Pompeo are preeminent, &amp; not working-level peeps
@greta I wasn't finished with the tweet thread. Now it's a complete thought if you look at it. I'm underscoring how Kim Yong Chol was excluded from meetings, a potentially notable development given that KYC has annoyed US diplos and his "rude" letter was the reason last trip was nixed
KJU may have been sending a message by excluding Kim Yon Chol, a thorn in the side of US negotiators. It's hospitable and also reinforces the notion that Kim is the ultimate Decider.
It appears the North Korean team just included Kim Jong Un, the translator and Kim Yo-jong, KJU's younger sister
Every indication is that this woman is a translator, which is notably only in that it appears that Kim Yong Chol, the North's point person on the negotiations, was not in the meeting after a "rude" letter he sent to the US resulted in the cancellation of Pompeo's last trip

On trade, Abe refused to retaliate against Trump's metal tariffs while others US allies targeted bourbon and motorcycles. In return, Japan was the only major US ally that did not receive temporary exemption from the metals tariffs. Now it faces auto tariffs
In meetings and phone calls, Abe repeatedly told Trump not to halt military exercises with South Korea or entertain declaring an end to the Korean War. Abe was ignored.
Trump will bring up Japan's "samurai past" and Pearl Harbor, and the Japanese laugh it off. But the disputes over trade and North Korea policy have taken a toll.
A thread on the dynamic Trump-Abe relationship. The two men have a very tight rapport: 8 meetings, 26 phone calls. More face-time than Trump has had with any other world leader. Easier comms than in Obama era. Analysts say defense cooperation has genuinely never been better.

On the one hand, that's more specific than the administration has been in the past. On the other hand, altering the Armistice Agreement is potentially a smaller giveaway than a full blown peace treaty. But the key details would be the timing of the alteration and language
The full quote:  “[Kim] has made very clear his commitment to fully denuclearize his country...In return for that, the president has committed to making sure that we alter the Armistice Agreement, provide the security assurances that Chairman Kim needs."
In return for denuclearization, Pompeo just said the US has agreed to "alter the armistice agreement" with North Korea

Lastly, I very candidly introduced myself to Joe Hagin as a reporter with the Washington Post. He reacted in a friendly way but he was of course brief (he was on his way to a meeting). It was the hotel staff that reacted quite angrily.
I think it's fair to say there may have been some white privilege here in the sense that the current press corps covering the summit planning in Singapore is almost uniformly Asian, so I was perhaps more plausibly a tourist in the eyes of the hotel staff
Because some people asked about the ethics of this: When I walked up to the hotel, they said, “can I help you sir?” and I just said I’m headed to the bar (and I was). I didn’t tell them I’m a tourist, or that I’m not a journalist. I left it up to them to decide

@JBWolfsthal Yes, the channel being active is important and you're of course right about NK's long held position. I'd only add that there were a few ways to parse that initial Blue House statement and that created some anxiety.
@JBWolfsthal You can of course be skeptical about the scope of what North Korea is willing to talk about, I'd say that's a very wise position to carve out. But US independent confirmation is significant
@JBWolfsthal Here's the importance of this development, Jon. If you talked to senior US officials three weeks ago, there was widespread uncertainty over whether SK accurately relayed NK's interest in talks. The U.S. had yet not confirmed it independently, and it now has.

A lingering question is how the Trump administration plans on fulfilling sweeping plans on neutralizing Iran in Syria when there are currently just 2,000 US troops in Syria. (Tehran has an estimated 125,000 Iranian forces in Syria)
Tillerson's key point was that the US military would not be fighting Iran or the Assad regime in Syria, unless in self-defense. That promise is interesting in light of the Stanford speech, which underscored neutralizing Iranian influence as a key reason for having troops in Syria

@aarondmiller2 I completely agree about the differences between words and deeds. Time will tell what the policy looks like, but Tillerson explicitly linked the need to keep troops in the country indefinitely to curbing Assad's power, notable given Trump's previous position on Syria
@blakehounshell Tillerson explicitly said removing US troops would help Assad stay in power and brutalize his own people. The change in language from UN-monitored and UN-supervised is also notable.
@blakehounshell "Topple" was the wrong word to use in the headline (doesn't appear anywhere in the story). It's been changed. Key point: Tillerson made the case for a lasting military presence to curb Assad's power and accelerate process to remove him.
@aarondmiller2 Thanks Aaron. "Topple" was the wrong word to use in the headline (doesn't appear anywhere in the story). It's been changed. Key point: Tillerson made the case for a lasting military presence to curb Assad's power and accelerate process to remove him.

Tillerson: “We especially urge Russia and China” to enforce NK sanctions
We reject a “freeze for freeze” approach, in which legitimate defensive military exercises are placed on the same level as the DPRK’s unlawful actions. The pressure campaign will continue until North Korea takes decisive steps to de-nuclearize.

@BillClinton @Martin_Indyk One of the reasons career diplomats have almost always done the job, Gerald Feierstein told me, is because it's such a hard gig. "There are lots of extremely difficult issues that get you stuck in the office for long hours." Political types usually opt for more glamorous jobs
Some context: the WH is expected to nominate think tanker David Schenker as assistant secretary for near east affairs. This job hasn't gone to a political appointee since @BillClinton gave the job to @Martin_Indyk in the late 90s. Otherwise all career diplomats

Clarification: Turns out, the first time Brownback was nominated, he was blocked by Dems for his LGBT stance. But the WH wants to try to push him through again, so it renominated him.

Breedlove also taught me a new verb. "My fear right now is any fruitful effort to move forward will be absolutely Shanghaid by this political process."
Gen. Breedlove is a pretty big hawk whose emails were once leaked by Russian hackers. But his perspective is that the Trump-Russia controversy has poisoned even legitimate US-Russia engagement. "The whole political schtick is inhibiting discussions that need to be had w/ Moscow"

European diplomats have been astounded by the wild ups and downs of US Russia relations since Trump over —&gt; “We entered 2017 worrying about a grand bargain,” one European diplomat said. “We end it with the US-Russia relationship feeling as fragile as it has been in years.”
After Ukraine crisis, Obama admin froze out a series of US-Russian channels, but relations are so unpredictable now that even Russia hawks are calling for engagement. “I was forbidden from contact,” Breedlove said. “now there are more pros than cons.”
