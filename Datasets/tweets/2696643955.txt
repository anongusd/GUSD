President Trump and Ambassador Haley have used strong sanctions to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Now sanctions can be used again to get a better deal with Iran and stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The nuclear deal gave Iran, the leading state-sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars and it used that money to terrorize people around the world. Iran's aggression &amp; hostility towards America &amp; Israel is why I rejected this bad deal when Pres. Obama proposed it 3 years ago.

The EPA should not make electricity and everyday products more expensive and should withdraw this new rule.

Americans are already making smart environmental choices and don’t need the EPA making new rules for their lives.

The EPA should focus on stopping invasive species in the GL and not burden Michigan farms &amp; businesses with more costly regulations. #WOTUS
The EPA’s misplaced priorities on #WOTUS and not invasive species jeopardize Michigan’s tourism and fishing jobs.
In February, the administration proposed cutting funding for protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species. #WOTUS
The Clean Water Act already protects the Great Lakes and the EPA needs to focus on stopping invasive species. #WOTUS
I will continue fighting for the thousands of MI residents who farm, so they can work w/o being saddled by onerous gov’t rules. #WOTUS
The opposition to #WOTUS is bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats in the House voted against it earlier this month.
When I hear from farmers, #WOTUS is one of their top concerns. They are worried about gov’t regulating mud puddles on their private land.
Today, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its Waters of the United States (#WOTUS) rule.
