I don‚Äôt really believe that this should be the standard of course. Suspect snapshot polls should not dictate policy. But it‚Äôs an interesting thought experiment to subject this POTUS to his very own blowhard shifting standards. Bc if we did, he‚Äôd be in prison already.

Dude, I‚Äôm tired. I have had only one point, no matter how much you dance around in your irrelevant generalities: a President does not have the ability to terminate, at will, a legion of career prosecutors pursuing a proper criminal investigation. Period. End of story. https://t.co/1oGJY4lHJW
I said the President cannot fire an entire office of career prosecutors without cause. He in fact cannot. Even the US Attorney cannot. Pay attention please. And know your facts. Nite @baseballcrank https://t.co/FF56cnE0Bq
@baseballcrank I did not. You‚Äôre still not reading.
@baseballcrank I was talking about the president. Not the US Attorney. As plainly written. Nice try
I just realized @baseballcrank is the guy who wrote Kelly Clarkson is more talented than Aretha Franklin. Apparently he can‚Äôt get anything right. Sorry I bothered.
Perhaps @baseballcrank you think that Presidents should be able to direct line-level career prosecutors to investigate his rivals or spare his allies. That would be a threat to the republic and democracy in fact.
And the point if you bothered to read my very short tweet is that an unethical &amp; possibly criminal President would be hard-pressed to fire 230 top-notch non-partisan career lawyers following the facts and law without fear or favor. Even as he threatens his hand-picked appointees.

History footnote: What was done to Gerald Ford by the Daily News (‚ÄúFord to City: Drop Dead‚Äù) was completely fair, though he chafed at it and thought it cost him the presidency. But not the same as putting those words in his mouth in an op ed. https://t.co/UpmKJP30CO
@chrislhayes Fair.
@chrislhayes The debate value of making it Romney‚Äôs own slogan ‚Äî ‚ÄúLet Detroit go Bankrupt‚Äù ‚Äî is significant. Whether or not that was his upshot. If it had been your column, fine. By  it was Mitt‚Äôs own op ed
@chrislhayes Yes but language and the particular rhetoric matters and Romney didn‚Äôt write those words. But they were attributed to him as if he did. Maybe it‚Äôs a semantic point but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs frivolous
Obama killed Romney with this line that Romney never wrote, attributed it directly to Romney because normal people assume the op ed writer chose or approved his own headline, like he does every single word in the piece itself. It is a small outrage that they don‚Äôt.
Even op ed authors are at the mercy of grabby headline writers. You may not like Mitt Romney but he never said in so many words ‚ÄúLet Detroit go Bankrupt.‚Äù That was a clickbait person who gave dynamite to Romney‚Äôs critics. https://t.co/lBVS77vMG3
@Anna_63 Yes idiotic
And no headline writers are not actually the ‚Äúworst‚Äù members of the press. That was a dumb grabby headline. See the point.
I know it‚Äôs an obvious and commonly made click-bait point. Just joining the chorus after seeing some headlines today.
This is not a feature only of the outlets you don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs a general criticism, of all media.
The worst members of the press are the people who write the grabby headlines for stories they don‚Äôt seem to have read

NBC has now retracted its "scoop" about a wiretap. A pen register is much easier to get and much less intrusive than a wiretap. No actual phone call content is listened to. Basically it's a real-time log of calls. https://t.co/KZxZrkF9Kb

Wiretaps are difficult to get. Applications require multiple layers of review, including by career lawyers in Washington, plus approval by a district court judge (not magistrate). Also they signify proof of an ongoing crime. And you don't tap a President's attorney lightly. https://t.co/FfVh8mA9ku

If Cohen flips, for example, and has Russia-related information to testify about, Special Counsel and SDNY are going to share this witness?
I need to see more specific reporting before I'm 100% convinced this is a full-on "referral" to SDNY. I could be completely wrong but such a referral seems peculiar. Of course much is peculiar these days. https://t.co/fY5Y92tigh

@jaywillis Many brilliant lawyers write terrible briefs because the law and facts are not on their side. Smart doesn't mean right. There have been high IQ fascists and despots. But living in a bubble is never smart.
It's also worthwhile following thoroughly stupid people who disagree with you. Check my follows and you will see that I do that also.
Let me put this another way -- imagine if a lawyer received the other side's (terrible) brief in a case, threw it in the garbage unread &amp; nonetheless inveighed against the absurdity of the arguments to the court. You wouldn't expect to win &amp; you'd be a terrible lawyer
This tweet did so poorly I have to double down - you're never getting anywhere unless you understand people u disagree with, engage them, refine your arguments, respect differences of opinion &amp; learn to persuade. If you're deaf to your opposition, you are destined to fail.
