It's "too convenient" that Trump said publicly, ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening, I hope you‚Äôre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing" on the same day the Russians made their first effort to break into the servers used by Clinton‚Äôs personal office.

Remember when the White House made a big deal about Trump donating his $100K paycheck to @usedgov to fund one STEM camp? 		DeVos' security costs could fund 190 STEM camps! https://t.co/HjEeNBpEQn
DeVos' security costs far exceed "the $3.5 million spent on security for former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt."
The 2018 @usedgov budget cut $28 million in funding to a program that provided grants to eligible schools to enable them to increase the participation of	low-income students in both pre-AP and AP courses and tests.
The TEACH Grant program awards annual grants of up to $4,000 to eligible undergrad &amp; graduate students who agree to serve as full-time teachers.
Unlike at the Pentagon, $20 million is real money for the Department of Education. 		A quick look at the @usedgov budget shows how far it could go ... for example, $15 million will fund 24 grants to strengthen Predominantly Black Institutions.
DeVos' security could cost taxpayers ~$20 million thru September 2019. 		@usedgov is on the hook for reimbursing the costs. https://t.co/elyXPKCKgl

Army O&amp;M funding is supposed to go toward funding readiness (training, maintenance, etc.). That's what DOD will be taking from to fund this border deployment.
Because Army O&amp;M funding is not, for the most part, aligned against specific congressional priorities (i.e. going directly to congressional districts), Congress might not care so much about how DOD is going to pay for this.
From an expert source, if the Defense Department has enough sitting around in Army operations and maintenance accounts to cover this deployment, no need for reprogramming, which requires congressional approval.

Some of this predates Trump: "In Nebraska, another Guatemalan mother prevailed and got her kids back, but it took five years and over $1 million in donated legal work."
"It took 28 minutes for a judge in a rural courthouse near Lake Michigan to grant Alexa‚Äôs foster parents, Sherri and Kory Barr, temporary guardianship. Alexa‚Äôs mother and the little girl‚Äôs immigration attorney were not even notified about the proceedings."

Two things Kavanaugh and Republicans are not interested in: an FBI investigation and asking Mark Judge, the person Ford says was an eyewitness to her assault, questions.
The FBI does not reach conclusions ... OK. But presumably it could provide more information to help weigh today's testimony.
He went on to say: "I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes."
"I have no memory of this alleged incident," Judge said in his letter to the Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh keeps saying that Judge said the alleged assault "didn't happen." Not true. Judge said he does not "recall" it.
Someone else other than Judge has provided the committee a sworn statement. Her name is Julie Swetnick. I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to take her statement at face value, but Kavanaugh is suggesting we do so with Judge's.

@MiekeEoyang I think so. Lots of debate on this point.
@NatlSecCnslrs This is a key question ...
Please feel free to chime in, experts, if I've gotten something wrong here. Or if there is another scenario worth considering.
Now, there is debate over whether Francisco will have to recuse from overseeing the Mueller investigation, but conventional wisdom, it seems, suggests he likely won't.
This is why oversight of the #Mueller probe falls to Noel Francisco, the current solicitor general.
Whoever replaces him as acting deputy attorney general (until Trump appoints someone new) cannot also perform the duties of acting attorney general. No "acting-acting" allowed.
But he was overseeing the Mueller probe as the acting attorney general (because Sessions had to recuse).
I think I understand some of this succession stuff ... for the dummies like me out there: It only matter whether #Rosenstein was fired or resigned for his duties as deputy attorney general.

The White House also wants to designate the parade a "National Special Security Event," which adds many more complicating factors for planning it.

A little more about this tale and these overlaps here: https://t.co/rLurjpGnfQ
‚ÄúI checked him out with Donald Trump. Donald said he was a nice guy,‚Äù Nasso told the paper.
Nasso also knew Trump. In a story in the New York Post from December 1999, Nasso says he asked Trump‚Äôs opinion of Abe Hirschfeld before deciding to do business with him on the film The Prince of Central Park.
"In a tale almost as far-fetched as the plot for one of his torrid explosion fests, Steven Seagal's long-running feud with the mob seems to have reached its denouement after his former business partner Julius Nasso was jailed for extortion." https://t.co/LWPRJc9GN5
In 2002, Nasso was arrested by federal agents, and pleaded guilty in 2003 for using Gambino family mob enforcers to extort money from the actor Steven Seagal. He spent more than a year in prison. https://t.co/rulFiQnWBW
Two men, Paul Cohen and Julius Nasso, launched Manhattan Pictures International, a New York-based motion picture distribution and production company, in 2001. Manafort was part of the team behind the new company. https://t.co/A45uz6HCGS
In researching Trump and Manafort's overlapping social and business circles over the last several decades, I came across Steven Seagal's name...And it's a bizarre story.

Did they come here "legally"? 		Sure, because the US was letting just about everyone in.
Most of my family came to this country from Europe, fleeing poverty and hunger, in the late 1800s/early 1900s.
Sure, we can have a debate whether that still makes sense, but to pretend your circumstances were somehow different than those arriving at the southern border is uninformed/hypocritical.
For most white Americans in this country, the rules when your family arrived were: If you made it here, you could stay.

.@itscaitlinhd explains how some of these young children are unable to understand what happened. For all they know, their parents chose to leave them behind and return to their home countries.
.@itscaitlinhd makes the crucial point: "We have seen no evidence of a plan for how parents and children might have been brought together." 		And no evidence that they would have been brought together if it weren't for the federal judge in San Diego, Dana Sabraw, who ordered it.
I had no idea "ineligible" parents included people the Trump administration had simply lost track of -- sometimes because they were deported w/o their children, often with the understanding that w/ deportation would come reunification.
