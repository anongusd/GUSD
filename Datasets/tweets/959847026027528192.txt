@HowardSchultz The country needs you to run for President! Go for it.
@maziehirono Didn’t he just do that?  Your plan failed too.
@SenKamalaHarris Seems like a presidential candidate could negotiate an end to this shutdown.
@RepSwalwell We could have both.  Haven’t you heard the phrase when they go high tech, we go low?
@SpeakerPelosi @SenateGOP Start negotiating on appropriations including a wall and the government will open.  Do your job.
@ecclesias @RepSwalwell @TSA And you’re wrong about Obama.  That’s why he has to do most of his actions through executive order.
@ecclesias @RepSwalwell @TSA No I’m not a robot.  Just a concerned citizen who thinks things should be done differently than you.
@ecclesias @RepSwalwell @TSA Dems have to do better.
@ecclesias @RepSwalwell @TSA If they were unacceptable then offer another.  That is how negotiation work.  Dems have been spoiled by Obama’s brand of negotiation.  ie: you can have what you want as long as it is exactly what I want.
@KamalaHarris No, because you do not believe in due process I do not want you as my president.  I think Justice Kavanaugh would agree.
@KamalaHarris No thanks, I don’t want a president who doesn’t believe in due process.  I thing Justice Kavanaugh would agree.
@KamalaHarris I don’t know if I want someone who does not believe in due process as my president.  I’m sure Justice Kavanaugh would agree.
@RepSwalwell @TSA I agree.  Have you tried negotiating an end to the shutdown?  I know President Trump has submitted a proposal.  Wouldn’t it be great if you submitted a counter proposal?  I think that would be great.
@Alyssa_Milano You can’t be both Stupid.  It is a two sided issue.  You can’t ride the fence and have everyone like you.
@MarkWarner Why not?  Congress has been doing it for decades.  Now that your tactic has been turned against you, that’s when it becomes a bad thing.  Stop complaining and start negotiating.
@KamalaHarris Yes, start negotiating to reopen the government.  Do your job.
@kschase13 @KamalaHarris Okay, I’ll spell it out for you.  You are correct he and the GOP don’t seem interested in fixing healthcare but this EO gives Trump forward motion on something.  If Pelosi would negotiate the shutdown he would not have time to do anything with healthcare.
@BillPascrell @HouseDemocrats You need to start negotiating an end to the shutdown.  Trump has made an offer.  This would be where you make your counter offer.
@KamalaHarris Well when Nancy Pelosi will not even come to the table Trump feels the need to move forward on something. Give him something to do and tell her to start negotiating an end to the shutdown.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Do something.  Negotiate.  Do your job.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I agree, start negotiating and open the government.  You have his offer.  This would roughly be where you create a counter-offer.  Do you job and stop disappointing the nation with you lack of progress.
@davidcicilline I thing you are underestimating what you can do to end this shutdown.  Start negotiations and reach a solution before this shutdown gets worse.  If you do not negotiate for an end then you will start owning the shutdown.  An offer has been made.  Do something with it.
@RepSwalwell I am glad to see you helping but you need to start negotiating to end this shutdown and stop playing political games.  Do your job.
@RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump You need to start negotiating an end to this shutdown before you start owning it.  Trump has made his offer publicly putting the ball in your court. Do your job and stop leaving Washington for Puerto Rico while the government it shut down.
@RepPeteAguilar So does that mean you’re not going to try? That’s why you get paid the big bucks.  Start negotiating an end to this shutdown before you and your Democratic colleagues start owning it.  Also, that is no excuse to leave Washington DC to vacation in Puerto Rico.  Do your job.
@RepMikeLevin @Alex_Presha @nbcsandiego At least you are working on it instead of just complaining like other Democratic law makers. Please end this shutdown before things get worse.
@RepGilCisneros How can you justify going on vacation to Puerto Rico during a government shutdown.  You should be in Washington negotiating an end to this shutdown instead of playing political games. Do your job.
@SenatorMenendez You need to stop going on vacations to Puerto Rico during a government shutdown.  Start negotiating to end this shutdown and stop playing political games.  Do your job.
@GKButterfield You need to start negotiating and get the government open before the impact of this government shutdown gets worse. Just do your job and stop playing games.
@SenKamalaHarris So you should start negotiating instead of playing games. Do your job.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump And you were so happy.  You just keep trying to pound a square peg into a round hole.
@RepJeffries You need to start negotiating to end this shutdown.  Do your job.
@SenKamalaHarris Do what you feel is right.  I think you’re wrong.
@RepJoeKennedy Start negotiating to put these federal workers back to work. Do your job.
@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump Start negotiating so we can get the government working again. Do your job.
@KamalaHarris Then do your job and start negotiating.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump You need to do your job and start negotiating an end to this shutdown.  Trump started it, but you are maintaining it when Trump has come to the table.  Do your job.
@RepJeffries Do your part to end it so we don’t have to find out please.
@RepLindaSanchez @realDonaldTrump You need to do your job and start negotiating an end to this shutdown.  No congressman should leave Washington DC until this is settled.  Do your job because there are 800,000 people who want to do their’s.
@SpeakerPelosi You need to do your job and start negotiating an end to this shutdown instead of leaving the country.  Do your job.
@maziehirono You need to do your job and start negotiating on behalf of 800,000 federal workers instead of playing games.
@RonWyden Sounds to me like Senator Pelosi went in with a closed mind too.  It takes two to tango.
RT @charliekirk11: If capitalism is evil and socialism is the answer, why isn’t the caravan heading for Venezuela?		🤔
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump I’m sure Obama did the same in his midterm elections and his re-election.
@KamalaHarris You are for keeping people who are dead or moved to another state on the rolls. Isn’t that how we get voter fraud?
@MayorFung Your opponent’s adds are like vinegar.  Your positive add is like honey.  Stay above the fray, sir.  You will be governor in a few weeks.
@kimguilfoyle To think that guy was the nations AG.  This call to violence is insane.
@RepSwalwell @tedcruz @DeanHeller At least you can see the hypocrisy.
@GOP Agreed.
@FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC @SenSchumer Well put.
@dbongino I will do my part.
@RWitherspoon I am too. But probably not in the same way.
@SCOTUSblog @BrettKavanaugh Thank goodness.
@DailyCaller I disagree.
@michellemalkin @DonaldJTrumpJr Those kids need some discipline.
@JanineVClay @SenGillibrand I’m not a lady.  But seriously, I think they will try to impeach at least one or the other, whether they can get it done or not is another story.
@SenGillibrand @BetoORourke @kyrstensinema @RosenforNevada No.
@SenGillibrand I’m not going to do that. The Democratic Party should go the way of the Federalist Party.
@SenGillibrand Agreed, we must preserve the House and Senate as Republican or we will never get anything done, they will try to impeach President Trump and Judge Kavanaugh.  The stakes could not be higher.
@RepWilson I don’t think he stands for any of that.
@SenThomTillis Thank you Senator.
@SenGillibrand @DMMD4TNCongress I hope you are wrong.
@KamalaHarris I am. I will be voting Republican partially due to the games you have been playing over the last few weeks.
@ChuckGrassley Thank you Senator.
@SenCapito Thank you Senator.
@CoryBooker I will Senator.  Straight Republican ticket for America!
@RepJeffries I will Congressman.  Straight Republican ticket for America.
@DineshDSouza @DonaldJTrumpJr @Kasparov63 That is reprehensible.
@Mamasunny79 @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump No doubt. I have been polled once by CNN in early 2016.  Nothing since.  They must not have liked my answers because I was pro-Trump...AKA: Deplorable.
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you Senator.
@LindseyGrahamSC Amen Senator.
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump MAGA
@BarbaraBoxer @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski I disagree
@JerryMoran Thank you Senator.
@RepJeffries Then push it on up.
@JohnCornyn When did Texas Monthly become a partisan rag?  I havnt read it since the 90s.
@KamalaHarris I will do my best to make sure there is a red wave.
@lisamurkowski I appreciate your thinking it out.  The Democrats other than a select few opposed him from the second he was announced.
@eric7flora Haha. Swalwell liked it. He must not have read it.
@SenMarkey I disagree.
@ChrisRBarron @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I am glad Trump is our president though.
@ChrisRBarron @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Meh. I think Jeb is tougher than that.
@RepJeffries I will not forget how Democrats took a good man and drug him through the mud.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump If the 2016 election showed us anything, it showed the polling system is broken.  I bet Trump is more popular than you think.
@CoryBooker Yes, voting a straight Republican ticket!  After the last few weeks, Democrats have proven themselves untrustworthy.
@JohnCornyn Good, his actions were reprehensible.
@RonWyden I don’t think they should be afraid of that.
@RepRoybalAllard People get angry when accused of a heinous crime with no proof other than the accuser’s word.  That does not make him a partisan hit man.
@SenGillibrand I bet they do.  They also believe in due process.
RT @Surabees: A lot of blue-checkmark Dems already calling for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached...🧐		https://t.co/VnxEeNNkwM	https://t.co/…
@RepWilson @AndrewGillum Socialism?  When has that ever worked?
@RepLindaSanchez I don’t think you need to worry.  I think he will be a fine justice.
@MikeCrapo Thank you Senator.
@SenBlumenthal I disagree.
If one Democrat takes up bullying as an issue they will have no credibility after the way they have treated Justice Kavanaugh, Ted Cruz, Susan Collins, etc... They are the party of intimidation and mob rule.
@SenJohnHoeven Thank you Senator.
@SenDuckworth Don’t worry.  He is more mainstream than your party has portrayed him to be.
@SenatorShaheen Because Schumer said to.
@JusticeABarrett @senorrinhatch I hope you are next Judge.
@RepZoeLofgren I disagree.
@BrettKavanaugh Congratulations Justice Kavanaugh!
@SenDuckworth Don’t be scared.  Today’s results were a good thing.  You will see.
@lisamurkowski I’m sorry to hear this, but I am sure you thought it through.
@ChrisMurphyCT I’m not upset.
@SenJackReed I disagree Senator.
@SenatorCollins Thank you Senator Collins.
@KamalaHarris Seems you know all about being a partisan political operative.
@SenGillibrand Not until the results of the FBI probe are released or is Judge Kavanaugh not allowed due process.
@MayorFung Keep rolling to Election Day!  You got my vote.
@SpeakerRyan Awesome.
@SenGillibrand They do matter.  But to blindly believe every story is ludicrous.  The FBI investigation will determine the proper response.
@SenGillibrand I disagree.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Who cares. He is doing the trick now.
@KamalaHarris Yes. Red wave is coming!
@KamalaHarris Trump is creating good jobs. Progressives will tax you and suppress religion.
@SenFeinstein You got what you wanted. Why are you complaining?
@KamalaHarris I don’t think anyone is saying that.  I think they are saying everyone deserves due process.   Even people you don’t like.
@KamalaHarris I don’t think I will be doing that.
@SpeakerRyan Awesome.
@JohnCornyn True, but they will whine forever if they don’t get it.
@MayorFung You’re doing a great job sir.  Keep pushing to Election Day.  I will be there to vote for you.
@SenKamalaHarris When going gets tough Harris gets running.  If this committee is too hard for you, then you should resign so someone else can take your place. Do your job!
@maziehirono @SenKamalaHarris If you are going to walk out, then resign for the committee so someone that will do their job can take your place. Do your job!
@DineshDSouza Indeed.
@SenGillibrand No, confirm Kavanaugh!
@KamalaHarris Well you should have stuck around and voted no if that’s your conviction. Do your job!
@SenWarren You are wrong.
@senatemajldr They have no decency.
@SenBillNelson Do what you think is right.  I don’t agree.
@SenKamalaHarris Polygraphs are unreliable and easily defeated.
@charliekirk11 I hope you are correct Senator.
@SenatorCollins This is wonderful.
@SenGillibrand That’s not what it means at all.  Speaking in absolutes when he has not had a trial shows a lack of decency.
@RepRoybalAllard That’s not what it means at all.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump He has declassification authority. You just don’t like it because it is devistating to the web of lies Democrats are spinning.
@MayorFung You got my vote sir!
@MayorFung You have momentum sir.  All the way to election.
@KamalaHarris Confirm Kavanaugh.
@SenGillibrand I disagree.
@KamalaHarris Finally, I can agree with you on something.
@SenGillibrand I think you are wrong.
@SenGillibrand You are wrong.
@KamalaHarris Nope
@KamalaHarris Is a pack of condoms such a financial burden?
@JoeBiden @BarackObama Sorry sir,  alienating Trump voters is not inspiring.
RT @marcorubio: Pres. Obama is right. It is wrong for a President to use divisive language, such as:	1.  Call all opponents of same-sex mar…
@KamalaHarris You made a spectacle of yourself, you didn’t even meet him in person and you came into the hearing with you ballot already filled out denied.  You should be ashamed of your close mindedness.
@KamalaHarris I’m sure he will make the right decisions on those and all other judgements.
@GlennJacobsTN That the kind of politician I like. One who can sit on the floor and build his own chair.  Do good things sir.
@KamalaHarris Point one sounds like a good thing.
@RepSwalwell As if you never in your life made a statement in confidence.
@PoliticusSarah You are wrong.
@RepCohen I’m not.
@RepSwalwell @SpeakerRyan Always complaining. Always whining.
@SenKamalaHarris At least you had the guts to meet the man unlike several of your colleagues.  Good on you.  I still think he will be good.
@SenMarkey Excuses.  You should meet with him.
@RepAlGreen You are wrong.
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Well, you should have met with him.
@SheriffClarke Yet another child left behind. Basic math...
@keithellison @NARAL Judge Kavanaugh will be a great Justice.
@SenKamalaHarris Minimum wage jobs are for kids and college students to learn about being in the work force. Why would an adult still be working the same job they had in high school and for the same pay?
@SenGillibrand Kavanaugh is a great candidate.
@SenKamalaHarris For the sake of partisan politics? He was good enough for plenty of other Democrats.
@KamalaHarris There isn’t enough money for all this free stuff.
@RepAlGreen Yes, your hate has made you powerful.
@SenCapito Great to hear Senator.
@RepCohen The military would not pick up your coup. Obama strangled the military, Trump has nurtured it.
@RepJeffries So you have never misspoken. Must be nice to be perfect.
@RepDonaldPayne I disagree.
@realDonaldTrump May God bless and keep you sir.
@SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein God bless President Trump.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump What it shows is he has the backbone to walk away from a bad deal. I wish President Obama had known how to do that in Iran.
@SenKamalaHarris As if you would not be doing the same thing for Clinton if she had been elected.
@RepLeeZeldin @NancyPelosi You got that right, sir.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If you think MS13 is anything more than animals, then I question what term you would use in your PC world. I think he is spot on and you’re applying what he says about a violent gang to all immigrants and that is wrong.
@KamalaHarris I support the equal opportunity to life of the fetus.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Good question.
@SenDuckworth Yes, the stonewalling literally everything by Democrats kind of saps the motivation to try. You have no one to blame but yourself.
@BarackObama A deal made at any cost is not worth keeping.
@RepSwalwell I suppose you would prefer Eric “Fast and Furious” Holder?
@JeffFlake Respectfully disagree.
@RepSwalwell Goodbye Clinton Foundation.
@RepSwalwell Goodbye, Move On...
@KamalaHarris So we should give up and take the Darwinian approach letting those addicted eliminate themselves through natural selection. Got it.
@marcorubio That is terrible.
@KamalaHarris I think you are just afraid it will work. I think it will.
@SenDuckworth @Paralympics I think you are twisting his words to mean what you want them to mean.
@KamalaHarris I wonder why adults are trying to make a living on what should be starter jobs. Who wants to flip burgers at 40? These are jobs for high school kids trying to earn money for their first car or college students trying to take the sting out of student debt.
@RepSwalwell You are supposed to be a progressive, not a regressive right?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @Paralympics @SpeakerRyan Well Speaker Ryan removed one chaplain for some mysterious reason. At least his party did not vote to remove all mention of God from their party’s platform like the Democrats. You can find fault with a man, even a priest. If you turn your back on God, that is on your party.
@LindseyGrahamSC Agreed
@SenKamalaHarris It does sound a bit counter productive.
@KamalaHarris Don’t do pot. Just say no and put the dealers in prison.
@RepSwalwell You are wrong.
@realDonaldTrump You are off to a great start, sir. I hope it pans out.
@RepSwalwell How can you be sure until the Muller investigation is wrapped up? You can’t.
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations Sir! This is a wonderful development.
@KamalaHarris I disagree.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are wrong.
@RepSwalwell @EPA For the first time, I agree with you Senator.
@RonWyden @EPAScottPruitt I don’t usually agree with you Senator, but I think you are right.
@SenKamalaHarris I usually disagree with you Senator, but in this case I think you’re right.
@KamalaHarris I don’t think he will do it.
@SenatorCantwell I disagree.
@SenGillibrand Pass
@KamalaHarris I don’t think he will fire Muller.
@GovAbbott I will return after I retire!
@KamalaHarris I’ll take the crumbs over anything you Democrats have given.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You are wrong.
@senatorgillibr1 You are wrong. He only needs the permission of Congress to declare war. There has not been an official declaration of war since World War II.
@ChrisMurphyCT If you don’t know what it means ask Speaker Ryan and he will tell you.
@KamalaHarris Abortion is murder.
@PressSec I am sure ADM Jackson is a wonderful physician. I just hope he can handle the VA.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You are wrong. You just want another bad deal like we got with Iran. The new Secretary of State will do a fine job.
@SenKamalaHarris You are wrong and that’s why you say the wall won’t work.
@WhipHoyer Correct me if I’m wrong, isn’t that what Muller is doing?
@KamalaHarris You are wrong.
@RepSwalwell You are wrong.
@KamalaHarris You are wrong.
