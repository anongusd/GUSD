@vt_snowflake @demisaysstuff @salvador_soldi @DanRiffle I was more than generous with the utilities and food. And I’m not going to further justify an entry-level position being able to sustain them they aren’t supposed to be there forever and they’ll be getting plenty after they get their raises.
@merrill_r @demisaysstuff @salvador_soldi @DanRiffle Exactly, and if they have to spend all their money on rent and what not they can't go out and get laid.
@demisaysstuff @salvador_soldi @DanRiffle Sounds like a bunch of incels. You can be responsible and share bills. And if rent is only 24k a year and 2 dudes are making 30k, then they have +/- 12000 in expendable income if they use 1k a month for utilities and 1k for food. That's beyond liveable.

@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews You're confusing my statements as applicable to everybody when I am saying people need to know how to control their anger. Some people will always have anger pent up, but may be able to hold it until more or less rational times through counseling.
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews lmao, Love you bb
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews Wow, I cannot believe you would take such a misogynistic stance on earrings. There are African tribes where women are found less attractive without large gauges in their lips and you don't think that correlates to women's earring in America and our respective social construction?
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews Anger could overcome emotions like angst, fear, or sadness that might make you less confrontational if someone had hit your car in a parking spot or were damaging your property. Meanwhile, anger could bring you off of a joy high or make you realize someone was not trustworthy.
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews You don't get to say that when I gave you justification for my product. There is literally no reason for people to wear earrings.
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews The positive role of anger when discussing a parking space would be to balance other feelings you might have, if you take all of what I said, the rest of my statement is we should understand our feelings to express ourselves in different ways. Hopefully that means better.
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews https://t.co/ph0H3035Xr, I mean, earrings may not cause deaths at the rate that guns do, but they can cause injuries and infections. Also, they are completely cosmetic and serve no utilitarian purpose, whereas people can hunt and feed their families with guns.
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews Guns are an accessory, and there is nothing inherently wrong with them. There is also nothing inherently wrong with anger, what we need is for people to understand that they can express themselves in different ways, and do you have to pound sign everything?
@UdeyJohnson @NBCNews It was one gun in a violent person's hand. You don't think maybe it is anger issues and the culture of violence in America?

@BruceHemmer @KamalaHarris So-called "Liberals" do not control anything that people do not let them control. Also, it does not matter what the professors are teaching, as long as people are not drones than they can still learn. No one has ever gone to school for an education.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BetoORourke Anything put out on your twitter is going to have a right-leaning bias Lindsey and you know that. Also, would you stop with the Fox news you're just feeding into the biases against republicans.
@KamalaHarris I'll speak a truth. Federal and state administrators hamper teachers' abilities to educate students while many teachers struggle through the first few years of their career and then after becoming vested treat the children and teachers who want to learn or help like trash.
@BruceHemmer @KamalaHarris interesting premise, what is the truth?

@DadoftheDecade @SenatorCardin @Alyssa_Milano I would argue the 14th amendment and 19th amendment were passed to protect different rights, but that the ERA would attempt to cover privileges already covered by the 14th amendment.

@chittlins @AVAmendola @IlhanMN Antonio's original argument was that he did not believe Venezuelans are suffering under sanctions, to which you replied with 'sources,' however, Antonio has stated that the integrity of those sources may be defunct, and cited a reason for that, so I think it is your turn.

@Jnzi123 @AndrewGillum The NRA is one of the most anti-gun groups there is, unless someone is an absolute bootlicker than they don't support them. Also, nowhere in your post did you name a reason why others should adopt your truth/value claim(s).
@ShellyRBulger @RaymondEdwardF @SenKamalaHarris I believe they are stating that if the government shuts down, that congressmen, representatives, and other federal employees who are 'in charge' and still get there checks should have all of their assets frozen so that they have incentive to get the government working.
@SenKamalaHarris I'm sorry, but it shows Michael R. Seko's check twice. Now call me a conspiracy theorist, but how do I know you didn't just copy off a bunch of checks and strow them across your room. I may be wrong, and CA may just like to send two checks to everybody, but please help me learn.

@Got1milk @thehill @AOC @HillTVLive Clarification on who this vast majority is. the country is more or less split in two on most issues, so I'm not sure how anyone can say a majority of people support (x) without trying to implement a tyranny of majority ideal.
@thehill @AOC @HillTVLive The vast majority? Are we allowed to just ramble on without citing figures or where this information comes from. Is education a problem, or do we all know the solution to our situations, which is it?

@Coop2408 @CoryBooker When/Where did he say, I won’t blame you? I know where he says I won’t make you I will do it, it won’t be you that does it or whatever, but I thing his words are getting twisted into what certain people are pushing. Can you link me a time where he says he won’t blame them?
