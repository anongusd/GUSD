In Congress, I will push for low cost education &amp; job training for all Americans. I will fight to get funding needed for public universities &amp; community colleges to hold more classes outside the typical workday. We must invest in our future, it begins with a good education.	#MO04
We have an untapped resource in our country of underprivileged, intelligent people going without proper higher education. Many of these people are weighed down in low-paying jobs, often more than one, struggling just to put food on the table for their children and families.
We must look to the future, not only to predict industry changes but to seize new &amp; emerging opportunities. Education is not only the key to achieving the dreams of our children, but it gives hope to those in changing &amp; displaced job markets for a new start &amp; career advancement.
We are living in a challenging world. Industries are changing quickly through advances in technology and shifting markets. Our workforce must continue to adapt through education and job training. 	#JobTraining
@RepHartzler is a millionaire. Yet her company has received federal farm assistance, $900k+! And she wants to cut food stamps to help the poor achieve "self-sufficiency." ¬†#VoteThemOut #MO04 https://t.co/D109FLcxF9

Charter schools take money from rural Missourians and leave them with nothing in return. It is unfair to all rural citizens to send their education funding to private schools in urban areas.	#PublicSchoolsFirst	#MO04
Depleting the budgets of public schools would cause job loss to teachers and staff and over-burden remaining resources. Moving money from public to private institutions removes an important economic driver in our small towns. #PublicSchoolsFirst #MO04
It‚Äôs important to our rural communities that funds remain in their public school systems. Moving funds to private schools hurts rural school districts. These school districts are major employers in many of our rural areas. #PublicSchoolsFirst
