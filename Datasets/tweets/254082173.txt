Specifically, this legislation allows Coverdell Education Savings Accounts to be used on home school educational expenses. It is our duty to expand opportunities for the education of our heroes‚Äô children and offer these families the support they deserve.
Because of frequent moves and a lack of school choice, children in military families feel the negative impact. This is why I introduced the Military Child Educational Freedom Act today.
Our brave women and men in uniform fight on the front lines for our freedom. Not only are we grateful to our heroes, but also to their families for their service. The average child in a military family moves six to nine times in his or her school career.

4. Supplies. Plan ahead of time by creating emergency kits filled with survival necessities such as bottled water, non-perishable snacks, medication, batteries, blankets, crank radios and flashlights.
3. Plan ahead. Create a family plan in the event that an evacuation is necessary, and keep emergency contact information handy. Don‚Äôt forget to consider your pets when planning for a possible evacuation.
2. Insurance and Important information. Review your insurance plans and have copies of important documents, such as driver‚Äôs licenses, medical information, and insurance cards.

H.R. 1677 passed the House on a voice vote last year, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation which uses diplomatic and economic sanctions to compel the Syrian government to halt the slaughter of the Syrian people.	Read more about H.R. 1677 here: https://t.co/IpywaRNSwx
That is why I am a co-sponsor of H.R. 1677, which would sanction anyone responsible for hindering access to humanitarian relief in Syria &amp; any person knowingly providing support to the Syrian Government in their attempt to acquire &amp; develop ballistic missiles &amp; other weapons.
We cannot make the same mistakes as the past administration, whose ‚Äústrategic patience‚Äù allowed Russia to get a foothold in the Middle East by propping up the brutal dictatorship of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and obstructing peace efforts by the UN Security Council.
This worsening crisis puts even more innocent lives at risk, and increases the risk of starvation, as the fighting moving closer to heavily populated areas.
The past few weeks has brought an unfortunate intensification of the Syrian Civil War as the Syrian government, aided by Russia, continues to bomb rebel-held towns and cities in Syria- including the targeting of hospitals.

The 2016 NDAA, signed by @POTUS, clearly bars the President from closing #Guantanamo and transferring detainees to a domestic location.
.@POTUS' dangerous proposal to close #Guantanamo and transfer terrorists to locations in the US, potentially South Carolina, is unlawful.
