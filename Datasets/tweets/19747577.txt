According to court docs, the gun in the 15 y/o Lincoln HS student‚Äôs photos  was a pellet gun. After his court hearing today, a woman (who says she lives with the student) told me that he had been bullied at school. She believes he was trying to look ‚Äútough.‚Äù @KING5Seattle
In Lincoln HS case, court docs say 15 y/o made 4 separate Snapchat posts, including one that said ‚ÄúNext school shooter jk‚Äù &amp; another that referenced who he would go after. He told police he was depressed the day he made the posts &amp; was responding to threats he received at school.
12 y/o Truman Middle School student was suspended on Feb 2 bc he made threats to cause harm. He was later expelled. Was supposed to return to school today after a safety plan created. But students tipped school officials on Friday to Instagram threats (^^ according to court docs)

@janicehoward201 @KING5Seattle That's what victim advocates say, too. But some officers believe detention is the only place to keep the victim safe from their trafficker.
@LynnJepson1 Traffickers don't always get caught bc their victims don't recognize their own victimization. They fall in love or stay quiet bc of shame.
@kristinaschaos @KING5Seattle Even if lawmakers propose to take arrest off the table, experts say they will need to come up with alternative places for kids to go.  (3/3)
@kristinaschaos @KING5Seattle But it's still possible there are other situations when cops view the youth as criminals instead of victims. (2/3)

More than 200 people shot this year in Cincy. 29 shootings were fatal. Here's how criminals are getting guns: http://t.co/Q6Li3tzwpx @WCPO
213 people have been shot this year in #Cincinnati, according to @CincinnatiPD. That's up 29.1% from 2014  and up 3.4% from 2013. @WCPO
37 of the 39 homicides in Cincinnati this year were criminal, Lt. Col James Whalen says. @WCPO @CincinnatiPD
@conservateach @WCPO Don't have those figures. Federal ATF agents trace every gun to its original owner, but that data isn't public record.
@sathomas513 Good catch! Just realized one person's race/gender is missing from these stats. Will work to find out.
22 of 39 Cincy homicide victims are black males. 4 are white males. 8 are black females. 4 are white females. @WCPO @CincinnatiPD
Eleven of 39 Cincinnati homicides this year happened between 7 &amp; 12 pm. Eight occurred in early morning hours (between 12 and 6 am). @WCPO

To be clear, no action taken yet re: adding more CPD officers/ a September recruit class. Only discussion at this point. @WCPO
Smitherman: I think we are all in agreement that the recruit class for September is going to be 40 (officers). @WCPO
Discussion now at law &amp; public safety about bringing on more police officers. Cincinnati has 950 to 970 sworn officers right now. @WCPO
