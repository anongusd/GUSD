What can web users do? Get involved. Care about your data. It belongs to you. If we each take a little of the time we spend using the web to fight for the web, I think we‚Äôll be ok. Tell companies and your government representatives that your data and the web matter. 7/9
My message to all web users today is this: I may have invented the web, but you make it what it is. And it‚Äôs up to all of us to build a web that reflects our hopes &amp; fulfils our dreams more than it magnifies our fears &amp; deepens our divisions. 6/9
If you have access to data for research purposes, it is REALLY IMPORTANT that you ONLY uses it for research purposes. So much important science and medicine depends on that data. 5/9

@der42 Take the concept of you, or foaf:Person. The RDF about a concept is not "content of", it is "info about".
Yes @mikekelly85   "Resource" confusing.   Personally prefer "document" where  includes movie, CSV, etc. and "thing" includes everything.
