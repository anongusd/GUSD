@BerniceKing I have worked with and got to know many good people who were here on work Visas some were sent back and I still think of them and miss most of them very much to this day. I still stay in contact with 3 who were very close to me. They were lucky and became citizens right before..
@BerniceKing There is no hate in my heart for the people who come here illegally but they need to follow the laws of our country if they want to become citizens and come in the right way.. the lawful way. IMHO
@BerniceKing I however cannot agree with you about the open borders and wall although I respect your opinion and your right to express your feelings 😊 Hope you have a great day!
@BerniceKing When he and JFK we're both alive. I was 9 when they murdered JFK and don't remember how long after that your father was also murdered. I wasn't raised to be racist and never have been. I don't know his children but have listened to neice? Daughter? Who is on the news a lot.
@BerniceKing I understand what you're saying but I believe we were evolving into one race... The human race! I know there's still racism in the world but find it less in the south now as in the north. It use to be the reverse... Or at least that's the way northerners' portrayed it. I grew up
