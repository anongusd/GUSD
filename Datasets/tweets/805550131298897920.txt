@stephen43824508 @USMCLiberal @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews If you only watch Fox News and Alex Jones, this is the crap you will adopt as "Facts"!
@USMCLiberal @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews More importantly, an America President  does NOT make decisions to only financially line his own pockets while appointing a bunch of leaches that use their position to do the same AND an American President governs for ALL Americans, NOT just for the 30% of people who support him!

Is it relevant wether or not he Commits a 2nd crime 3 years before or after his cooperation agreement under his SDNY cooperation?? A crime is a crime no matter when Pecker decides to commit it, no??

@Little___Birdy @lauferlaw @cglibby @ifindkarma @norwegian76 @jackshafer @JeffBezos @nycsouthpaw Yeah... Doesn't Pecker's cooperation agreement with SDNY say that he's not allowed to commit any additional crimes for at least 3 years from his cooperation date??

They thought the "Liberal Tears" was more important than what was best for their country)
@brianzinman @charliekirk11 AKA: Congress &amp; Senators along with their staffers, including but not limited to EVERY single useless waste of $$$ &amp; space  occupying the white house and Capitol Hill that hold all of the Power to make them work for FREE while they ALL still collect taxpayer funded paychecks!
@brianzinman @charliekirk11 Uh... Yah, Dip Sh*t!!! EVERYONE'S tax $$$ is used to pay the salary of ALL Government employees for the small salaries in exchange for the service they provide! Except they get paid at a MUCH lower wage than every single politician that has the power to make them work for FREE...
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump First of all: "Beautiful &amp; Elegant??" That's debatable, but "Patriotic?" that's clearly Bullshit cause she flew to Mar a lago on a government funded aircraft on a taxpayer funded vacation while government employees are working for free to pay for her vacation to Mar a lago!
@DZarrella12 @realDonaldTrump Are you referring to @realDonaldTrump when you said "he who speaks the truth?" LMAO!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ He wouldn't know the truth if it kicked him in the nuts!! IDIOT!

@carmenlidia13 @iamcardib That's right! Unlike some people (45), She didn't inhert millions from her rich father and then squander it on bad business deals... then coned his voters into believing he was a "master-negotiator" when in fact, he's nothing but a "master-baiter"
@Nock_neck @tmbriget @cxrked @LeeJohn_McLovin @Just_Catia @iamcardib So you're solution to that is to build a wall??The only thing that would change is that the current hole or tunnel would be under an expensive &amp; ineffective "wall" instead of the current fence that is currently sitting there... You "Wall Nuts" aren't very bright are you??
@auntiebaecc @iamcardib Mitch McConnell reading this tweet https://t.co/MIJB1gPOK4
@iamcardib It only makes sense that if they're the ones that have the Power to shut down the government, then they should be the ones to feel the financial pain first and foremost... I bet there will NEVER be another government shutdown when it affects them! (2/2)
@iamcardib I should run for office... The very FIRST bill I  would pass is to make sure that in the event of ANY government shutdown, the President, White house employees &amp; EVERY SINGLE member of Congress would be the very first paychecks to be furloughed or withheld! (1/2)

@AnnCoulter Like the Asylum Seekers (that have the LEGAL right &amp; is constitutionally protected), the majority of ILLEGAL drugs come through the LEGAL ports of entry (In which NO amount of "wall" will eliminate the problem)! This is what happens when you use Breitbart as your news source #Duh

@Marcinie2 @TMcDevitt11 @realDonaldTrump While he's using the office of the Presidency  to profit his own businesses? ü§î I'm confused as to why he wants To hand over all of America's power to appease the world's Dictators that is hostile to us? (2/2)

@realDonaldTrump No! I can assure you that an "Open Border &amp; Large Scale crime" is NOT the culprits of the "Stupidity"		The owner of an Open Twitter account that spews out Large Scale Presidential LIES is what's Stupidity filled!

@realDonaldTrump you intentionally broke to begin with... Dude! Just make it easier on the country and sign an Executive Order to change the name from Obamacare to Trumpcare?? It's your intended end result without the self inflicted Chaos (2/2)
@realDonaldTrump Just like your "New" trade deal "USMCA" with Mexico and Canada, which is nothing more than NAFTA 1.001... You're just looking for to change the name of "Obamacare" to "Trumpcare"!! You're creating a self inflicted problem only to be able to claim that you fixed something (1/2)

@ElizabethMusko1 @Conssista @garyrsimcox @hasitleaked Sorry to burst your "Theory" bubble but if you know who Pharrell Williams is, you would know that a Donald Trump rally is the very LAST PLACE that he would want to seek publicity from...

@Conssista @garyrsimcox @ElizabethMusko1 @hasitleaked Sorry @Conssista... The Facts and the Law is not on your side today.

@Conssista @garyrsimcox @ElizabethMusko1 @hasitleaked It would be the "False Endorsement" part where Pharrell Williams would have standing to sue to cease and desist under the "False Endorsement" violation...

@Conssista @garyrsimcox @ElizabethMusko1 @hasitleaked Actually, he does! You would be the IDIOT for thinking there wouldn't be any legal issues just because you've "worked them," it doesn't mean you understand the laws behind the illegal use of a song w/o the artist's permission.

@ElizabethMusko1 @hasitleaked Sheeit! If Pharrell Williams is wrong, then why the F**k would he want to use his song to open (a Donald Trump's, bigoted &amp; racist KKK Rallies)?? I'm sure his fellow white Nationalist Ted Nugent would be more than willing to volunteer his Low rated music!

@peter_servinis @akaANonEMouse @AltNatSecAgency @realDonaldTrump You said, "Everyone knows"... who is "EVERYONE" that apparently knows?? Your President just litteraly acknowledged (with his tweet) that the Russians attacked our election... What kind of President would allow this from a foreign country without a response? #IllegitimatePresident
@mflynnJR @steph93065 @GenFlynn @POTUS Yeah, I agree! #ReleaseALLofTheMemo #NotJusttheGOPMemo so that it shows how you &amp; Donald Trump both belong in jail along with your father! (LOSER!)
@Dina1trump @MatthewT0618 @BazookaShmoo @realDonaldTrump (No welfare, food stamps, medicaid) that is afforded to the rest of us who barely even measure up to them. Not one of them are a strain on our economy that they contribute to &amp; Not even one of them have committed a crime. That's required to be granted protection under DACA (5/5)
@Dina1trump @MatthewT0618 @BazookaShmoo @realDonaldTrump are in our prison system. Every single one of them are either in school, employed, own businesses or serve in our military.

@Dina1trump @MatthewT0618 @BazookaShmoo @realDonaldTrump or at the very least, educate yourselves before making such ignorant judgements on them!

@Dina1trump @MatthewT0618 @BazookaShmoo @realDonaldTrump #DACA kids are not given a path to citizenship. The Government (From Clinton to Bush to Obama) made a deal with them that if they lived under criterias that NOT EVEN natural born citizens are required to adhere to. I keep saying, people need to live 1 day in their shoes (2/5)
@Dina1trump @MatthewT0618 @BazookaShmoo @realDonaldTrump @Dina1trump This is the MOST IGNORANT statement I've ever heard.

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr ill informed mass hysteria about what a burden they are... you sir, should be ashamed of yourself! There is  DACA bill ready to vote for and would pass with no problem! Ask yourself what plausible reason would they NOT vote on it?? (7/7)

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr it's either provided by their employer OR they PAY out of pocket for medical benefits through ObamaCare. They're not asking for anything for free or handouts from this government. They couldn't even if they tried because DACA is not eligible for any gov assistants PERIOD! (4/5)

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr 1 day in their shoes before you can so callously dismiss them as "Illegal." I can understand people wouldn't take the time to try to understand something that doesn't affect them in their day to day life BUT there's just no excuse for drawing such an ill informed conclusion (6/7)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr It's no different than painting every white person as David Duke. You're using the Word "Illegal" as a Broad Brush to describe a group of people that consists of 800,000 people. These DACA recipients are more Ideally American than most American Citizens! You need to live (5/7)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr MISINFORMED! Do you know what is required for a person to be granted protected under DACA?? Do you know the impact that those 800,000 DACA recipients have on our American economy?? Because if you even had a clue, you would NEVER EVER categorize them using the word "Illegal" (4/7)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr who make up the hard core Trump Supporter. Not to mention, it's GROSSLY irresponsible to dismiss these Dreamers using that word "Illegal" But NOTHING can be further from the truth &amp; if you believe that then you're not just GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE but you're also GROSSLY (3/7)

It's easy enough to tweet the word "ILLEGAL" Over &amp; Over, It works REALLY well as a dog whistle to tap into the fears of (approx) 35% of the American population (2/7)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Lemme tell you something about that word "ILLEGAL" Immigrants. Just because Trump &amp; the GOP continues to repeat the word "Illegal" DOES NOT make it true! And by using this tactic, you're dismissing them under FALSE pretenses. You're playing on peoples fears &amp; buying right (1/7)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr The irony is that Both of Donald Trumps parents were immigrants that came from Germany during Hitler's reign in WWII. His Father lied to his tenants &amp; claimed to be an immigrant from Sweden cuz he said "it wasn't a good time to be a German immigrant in America during those days"
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr But anyone, from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in America and become an American. (3/3)

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr all of us. Do you think that money for a stupid wall is more important than either CHIP OR DACA? NO!

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr like all of his sycophants do. But doesn't that just make you all warm &amp; fuzzy? That your gov would use the most vulnerable in jeopardy as bargaining chips? I mean, it's the devil himself couldn't do better than that! Again, sorry this was so long (8/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr They Sat on CHIP &amp; DACA votes so they could use it as bargain chips to attach them to the demand for $$$ for a FREAKIN "Wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for." THAT is what this gov shutdown is about! Sorry, you were dupped by a con-man &amp; sorry you took the bait (7/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr If it's REALLY about CHIP, then put CHIP ALONE for a vote RIGHT NOW &amp; it would pass both houses, no problem! Then put DACA ALONE for a vote &amp; that too would pass just the same with no problem! But neither is the actual  problem! A GOP accidentally blurted out the intention. (6/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Its only when P. Ryan threw CHIP into THIS CR vote at the last minute is when this shutdown was effectively deflected into the "Americans vs illegal immigrants" Argument. If the GOP gave 2 üí© about sick kids, they would've  renewed CHIP in Sept. of LAST YEAR when it expired!(5/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr But this gov shutdown is NOT over a vote for a responsible annual budget, It's for YET ANOTHER CR. Even his own DOD Sec. Mattis has said "the Pentagon CANNOT continue to govern on CR after CR" because NO gov. agency can plan for the long-term needs 1 month at a time! (4/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr rid of the filibuster rule but this Shutdown is NOT about "American Citizens vs. Illegal immigrat," far from it! It's the fact that the GOP refuses to responsibly &amp; properly govern with an annual budget rather voting on Continuing Resolution (CR) month after month!.. (3/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr I don't see you addressing any "HYPOCRISY" from the other side, of which there is plenty! 	keep saying "60 votes" all you want but why should ONE SINGLE Democrat vote for it when they can't even get all 51 GOP'S to support it?? Mitch McConnell is well aware of how to get..(2/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Ok, 1st: you're not asking the right question &amp; this is why it CANNOT be reasonably answered... I am arguing your twitter specifically  on this particular thread because you posted 2 clips of 2 Dem leaders addressing a Gov Shutdown In 2013 (NOT in 2012) Yet... (1/8)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr I forgive you... And I apologize too if I have said anything that offended you - Friends?? Great!		Okay, now that's out of the way, Let me address your question. I'm going to apologize ahead of time for length of the next 8 tweets but it's necessary to respectfully respond
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr And even If the Democrats help a small majority in THE SENATE but not the House  in 2013, then you should know that every bill starts in the House before it can go to the Senate for a vote! So again, your on the losing side of the "HYPOCRISY" argument! Which ur only blaming dems
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Hey, lemme ask you question... Did the Dems have 60 votes in the 2013 Shutdown??? Why does the "60 vote" argument work the GOP this time but it doesn't work in 2013 for the Dems, hu?? - Lemme answer that for you: Because you're NOT arguing "HYPOCRISY on BOTH SIDES"
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Hey, lemme ask you question... Did the Dems have 60 votes in the 2013 Shutdown???

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr To the nuclear option at anytime! He did it to steal a Supreme Court seat, He did it to pass his 1.5 TRILLION DOLLAR Tax cut.

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr GOP's have control... If you were trying to make the point that the "HYPOCRISY on BOTH SIDES," Then you've failed because I only see you posting clips of 2013 Democrats while talking about a fictitious 2012 Gov shut down... Keep trying parre! (3/3)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr Are In control &amp; even more powerful (Because now they have the whitehouse too), Yet, were on gov shutdown controlled by GOP, part II.

@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr This does need 60 votes because it's a vote to fund the Government to keep it open. There is NO way to get around that BUT make sure all of your GOP's are voting "Yes" before you even think about throwing the blame to the other side. They only threw in #CHIP last minute so (1/2)
@TheRealJreday @tonyjenson @SenateMajLdr The point is that @tonyjenson is saying that if the GOP can't even get ALL 51 of their GOP's in the Senate to vote "Yes"? then that means... you CANNOT blame the Democrats if there are currently 5 REPUBLICAN Senators that are hard "NO" votes to even meet the GOP minimum! Duh!!
@SenateMajLdr If @POTUS plans on being in his Country Club TOMORROW (when the Government is supposed to shut down) to "celebrate" his Inauguration anniversary by selling tickets for $150,000 to $350,000 per couple WHILE  #CHIP &amp; #DACA are left hanging, then that makes the GOPs the Dusche Bags!

Your job in congress should be clear &amp; see it through that the truth comes out! Your allegiance is to your country and NOT to protect this Treasonous President (3/3)
@senjudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @TheJusticeDept Ever again! In what world does it make sense to investigate the guy who reported the crime rather than the person who committed the crime itself?? Common Sense says that a Dossier would not exist if there was no crimes committed to begin with. Mike Flynn &amp; Poppodopolus... (2/3)
@senjudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @TheJusticeDept Of all Senators, I thought for sure that @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @SenJohnMcCain would stand up for the Country from the ongoing attacks to our Democracy from all enemies foreign and domestic. Our Constitution is under attack and You're helping him. I Will NEVER vote for a GOP (1/2)
@NormallyNell @MorepeopleMoPro @ALT_uscis @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Yeah! Remember that boarder wall THAT MEXICO WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR?? LMAO ü§£ü§£ü§£üò•üò• that promise sounded REDICULOUS when said it (Over and Over and Over and Over....Again), only Trump Sycophants believed that was true
@heidiandpona @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump And in response to "Illegals deserve deportation &amp; We're a nation of citizens &amp; Trump wants all citizens to prosper." EVEN Trump doesn't follow that thinking because he's happy as F*ck using undocumented immigrants to build Trump Tower for cheap labor rather than hiring Americans
@heidiandpona @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump More than 50% of the Puerto Rican people are Still struggling to survive w/o the basic necessities because he Refuses to recognize that an Island full of Brown American Citizens are his responsibility! Haiti got twice a much help and they're NOT even American Citizens... (2/2)
@heidiandpona @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Uh hu... hmmm, you really think so?? Cause the last time I checked, all 3.5 MILLION Hispanics living on the island of Puerto Rico are American Citizens Yet, he doesn't seem to think PR deserves the same attention that Texas &amp; Florida got when it was hit by TWO  hurricanes...(1/2)
@johnnybgood1959 @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump else to "Support YOUR President" just because the guy you voted for won. IN AMERICA, a President earns the support of the people by proving he's worth their support. People don't bow at a President's feet as if he's King of a country!!! That's how Dictatorship operates... (4/4)
@johnnybgood1959 @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump that voted for him &amp; disregard the other 65% that DIDN'T vote for him did you support your President in the 8 years Obama was President? I suspect you didn't support "that Bum Obama" as you so eloquently put it? I assume not. So where do you get off demanding me or anyone (3/4)
@johnnybgood1959 @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump how all of this works do you?? THIS IS THE AMERICA YOU LIVE IN. It's not "American" or "Patriotic" to blindly support ANY President let alone THIS President! It's the Responsibility of a President to unite a country, not ONLY to govern &amp; appease the 35% of the population (2/4)
@johnnybgood1959 @ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump WHHHHAT?? What the F*ck are you talking about? You're just talking out of your ASS now! First of all, I have a job! I do work for a living and who the heck said that I'm getting a "Free ride?" Trump Sycophants like you don't see the double standard or have any understanding (1/4)
@ExDemLatina @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump So, wait! You're a former Democrat Latina but now you're a Trump Loving, Republican Latina? So..What is it about Trump that you support? I'm just wondering cause he targets the Hispanic community. Just curious, I can't think of ONE THING that he's done that benefits ANY Latinas.
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump 19 different Russians in contact with the Trump Campaign is not just unusual but it's UNPRECEDENTED &amp; then to lie about it only for the truth to come out to the contrary  again and again! https://t.co/ll60wS9jpr
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump The next time someone wants to utter the stupidity of an "email scandal"... then they need to be able to explain why it's okay for Donald Trump's kids and his administration to do the EXACT SAME THING, yet it's not a scandal?? Why the double standard?? https://t.co/S1Mulxlyby
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump "Collusion." THEN Popodopolous and worst of all Mike Flynn pleading guilty is going to be Trump's unravelling... Flynn knows of everything corrupt and illegal about Donald Trump and his whole family &amp; is the equivalent of James Dean flipping on Nixon during his impeachment. (3/3)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump pants about subpoenas to Duetch Bank for all financial ties with Trump &amp; Kushner. He should be shitting his pants for good reason! Manafort and Gates have been indicted not just for money laundering but also for "Conspiracy against the US" which is the true meaning of.... (2/3)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump who did in fact ACTUALLY conspire with the Russians.(FACT): Duetch Bank was fined MILLIONS of $$$ for laundering Russian Money, which by the way is THE ONLY bank on wall street that will loan money to Donald Trump's Organizations. That is precisely why Trump is shitting his (1/3)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump It just isn't believable that FBI and DOJ had evidence of a crime but didn't charge her of a crime or appointment a Special Counsel because they favored or tried to protect Hillary? She's not in jail because there has been NO CRIME, something you CANNOT say about Trump... (9/9)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Secretary of State Based on NOTHING MORE THAN the Republican lead CONSPIRACY Fishing expedition. She's  testified ALL 15 times in front of Congress being asked the same question OVER &amp; OVER! Holy Sh*t! Yet, still no arrests because there is NO EVIDENCE of ANY wrong doing... (8/9)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump again &amp; again... take it from Fox News themselves if that's the only media source you trust https://t.co/MlbI6V5RWg	The Republicans spent 28 MONTHS in congressional investigations on Bengazi, 12 months on Uranium One = over 3 years total out of Hillary's 4 year term as...

@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump I just wanna know In what twisted world does it make sense that Russia would give/donate money to HRC? Clinton &amp; Obama were Putin's Mortal enemies! That doesn't sound the least bit absurd to any sane thinking person? The Uranium One Crap has already been debunked... (6/9)

@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump He Lies when the truth will do! Guess who else used private emails to conduct government business??	 ( https://t.co/gu2jwuxkzL ) The Wall Street journal (owned by Fox), the New York Times, politico and the Washington Post has kept a log because he lies so much. (3/9) https://t.co/sEVJqgyfb3
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump example out of dozens Even though they have PLENTY of  pictures of Trump &amp; Felix Sader together. Sader has handed out business cards that identifies him as a "Senior Advisor" to the Trump Organization! TRUMP?? who is dubbed by the media as "the Liar in Chief." (2/9)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump As opposed to who? Donald Trump? Anything you "think" HRC has done to warrant jail time, DJT has done it (√ó1,000 times) MORE! Hes lied under oath plenty of times when he said he couldn't pick out the known criminal Felix Sader if he was in a room with him! Thats just one.  (1/9)

@Clowndro @LandonMSears @krassenstein @ViratKohlisEra @realDonaldTrump I say the Kid is the Mature one on this thread, @Clowndro, Trump "Made Money" spent his entire life screwing over the little guys, the Trump Sycophants is full of crap and you've fallen for the Trump con-man play book!!
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP @GOPLeader @LindseyGrahamSC @RNC - If you hear nothing else going into the 2018 mid-term elections, hear this!! You're going to loose control of BOTH the House &amp; Senate BIGLY! BECAUSE GOP's enable $hit like this! I cannot wait to vote this Nov.2018 https://t.co/n99G2ZDa43
@realDonaldTrump Because the GOP's JOB is to be a check on your crazy ASS... But they've done nothing but encourage your LUNACY and they have proven to be useless... they're just standing by while you make world annihilating threats like this (this why they should be scared of 2018 mid-term): https://t.co/Epgg7cVdH7

@deemohr @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump This is your President BTW... He admitted it, tried to apologize for it and over a year after his admission &amp; Apology, he decides that he doesn't think it's his voice?? And the women who were victimized are the shady ones??

@deemohr @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump he's caught on a hot mic describing the exact behavior he's being accused of AFTER these women came out with the accusations of the very same behavior he's denying &amp; bragging about it on Howard Stern... You should try being one of the women that just had their Pussy Grabbed (2/3)
@deemohr @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Do all Trump Sycophants puppet what Faux News say while throwing out REDICULOUS  accusations with no proof to support anything they say?? Even if it is true that someone paid me to talk, it still doesn't make his digusting behavior okay! Even more incriminating, (1/3)
@realDonaldTrump Really?!! You know that Puerto Ricans are Hispanics right? they're Hispanics that are U.S. Citizens by right! If every single Puerto Rican came here on a cruise ship during 2018 mid-term election, they could flip the house and senate from Republican to Democrat all by themselves!
@jaketapper Pick me up a new competent President please, I'll give you the cash when you get back - thanks! üòâ

We could be here all day listing all of crooked shit Trump and his kids are doing. It's just common sense to know that every American should know that it's ILLEGAL to do business (4/5)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump The secret service has already trippled their budget because they have to pay over inflated prices to stay at Trump properties when the secret service is there TO PROTECT his Ass ON HIS PROPERTY!! There are several Pending lawsuits as we speak because hes been in violation (3/5)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump spends 111 days of his first 300 days in Office??

Hillary doesn't have a Special Counsel (4/5)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Trump Sycophants are so clueless! And 3rd - Conspiracy theories about the Uranium CRAP has been debunked OVER &amp; OVER Again!

@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump &amp; Social Security numbers causing voter suppression due to "system issues," Which resulted in longer than usual lines and THOUSANDS of voters being turned away from voting particularly in swing states. 2ND- I am VERY well versed in the Constitution, which is why (2/5)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump 1ST- You're spouting beliefs NOT "Facts." Our intel agencies have already determined that voting booths from 21 states were hacked into by Russians (w/the assistance from the Trump campaign). It DID NOT change the vote counts BUT it DID amended voter's registration numbers (1/5)
@Blackykitten @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump Keep in mind, no one knew that Trump and his crooked children were accepting and conspiring with the Russians to cheat... Even then, there are STILL 3 million more people who voted for Hillary Clinton!

@chiraqwickedone @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump In the destabilization in the middle east! Russia didn't interfere in our election because they were looking out for the best interest of the U.S. there's a reason why they've been slapped with sanctions after sanctions!
@chiraqwickedone @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Stop Supporting Russia! Putin steps in to help North Korea (who is a nuclear threat) when China won't and Assad (Who massacred thousands of Syrain People) is in power because Putin puts him there &amp; is also an added danger to our troops in the middle east because Russia assists
@chiraqwickedone @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump that what every Trump Sycophant seems to over look. But you know just as well as anyone that's it's nothing but a "whatabout-ism" that doesn't compare with Conspiracy against the US with a hostile foreign country, that doesn't even come close to ANYTHING HRC was ACCUSED of (2/2)
@chiraqwickedone @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump @chiraqwickedone you're so full of SHIT, if you even think that something as STUPID as an email Server is "Absolutely Illegal" then Trump &amp; his kids needs to pay the same consequences for Their own private email use of sensitive government emails.

@AWardShowLive @rumpleteeza @bpolitics "Collusion" with a hostile foreign country is Crime... It's just called "Conspiracy Against the US," which is one of the charges against Paul Manafort

@foxandfriends If you're going to use "what about-ism" as an argument, then you better be JUST AS outraged about the double standard that GOP HACKS that are complicit when it's their side is caught doing the same damn thing! There is NO DIFFERENCE in the offenses committed by the Trump Tribe!
@foxandfriends Really? Jason Chaffetz?? The guy who is not seeking reelection BECAUSE he is infatuated with investigating HRC for her use of private emails but can't because Donald Trump, his kids &amp; his administration was ALSO caught using private emails for government business WHILE in office!
@realDonaldTrump You and your twitter account addiction IS EVERY Prosecutor's dream!!! The one thing you're addicted to is what's going to be "the undoing" of your PATHETIC Presidency!! LOL! I can't wait to watch your impeachment hearing ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

@QueenRossi @Liana38MM @smokeyheart @DaveMcBey @Notgiamatti @realDonaldTrump You would sound less like hack if you stop making excuses for one side while demeaning the other BECAUSE you're easily conned by a con man!
@QueenRossi @Liana38MM @smokeyheart @DaveMcBey @Notgiamatti @realDonaldTrump Not to mention, the false equivalency that your making doesn't factor into the punishment vs. The crime, Bill Clinton at least went through a trial for impeachment, while Trump has not had to pay for ANYTHING! Like he &amp; his kids have their whole lives!
@QueenRossi @Liana38MM @smokeyheart @DaveMcBey @Notgiamatti @realDonaldTrump What you obviously DON'T get is that it's wrong wether it's a "Democrat" or a "Republican." This issue has no party affiliation, THAT'S what makes your "what about-ism" argument sound so stupid!
@AnnCoulter Don't you feel STUPID for dedicating time to write a book called "In Trump We Trust?" Sucks for you who has wished upon the star for a wall to begin with... your STUPID wall IS NEVER going to happen!!
@realDonaldTrump But all of the money in the world couldn't educate him enough about how to run a Government &amp; what he needs to know
@realDonaldTrump Trump Supporters IS AN ELITIST! He has NO CLUE what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck, do you really think that people who are Rich = God like powers... That's so stupid! He may know how to con someone into taking their money and then filing bankruptcy but that doesn't mean.

@SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC 3/3: Replacements that would have undoubtedly hurt millions! TrumpCare &amp; Republicans are so desperate to score even if it hurts millions!

@SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC 1/3:If #Obamacare is failing, it's because YOU &amp; YOUR #RepublicanMonkeys are #Sabotaging it! 7yrs of "Repeal &amp; Replace"&amp; U only have repeal!
@ClimateAudit @i_contemplate_ That decision is made SOLELY by the courts that are provided WITH probable cause... And probable cause was presented to the court
@ClimateAudit @i_contemplate_ And YES! There is a HUGE difference in that statement because NO President has the authority to order a wiretap on anyone or any place!!
@ClimateAudit @i_contemplate_ DOJ and every intel agency SAID: "NO evidence that Barack Obama wire tapped Trump Tower!!" It does NOT say "Trump Tower WAS NOT wiretapped"

@Sr1Dale @TruthIsQuantum @AnnCoulter Trump Supporters ALWAYS misses the irony in that! He claimed he's not beholden to Goldman Sachs yet he fills half of his Cabinet with them
@Sr1Dale @TruthIsQuantum @AnnCoulter YES! YES! Trump inherits Millions from Daddy, a self described "Billionaire" his entire life TOTALLY understands the "Forgotten Man &amp; Women"

@TruthIsQuantum @Sr1Dale @AnnCoulter I bet that if I just "googled" a few of them, Their Wiki profile wouldn't support his FAKE RUSSIAN HACKED list

@Sr1Dale @AnnCoulter Some of them are correct but MOST are not.. Regardless of your completely flawed list, MOST of the other celebs listed on your Russian Fake
@Sr1Dale @AnnCoulter Some of the names listed such as: Scarlett Johansson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Charlie Sheen is also FALSE!!
@Sr1Dale @AnnCoulter You must of gotten this list from a Russian Fake News because Other Celeb names on your list is just nothing more than RUSSIAN FAKE NEWS!!

@realDonaldTrump The buck stops with you Putin... Oops! I mean "Mr. President"!! Congress wouldn't have to do it if you did what you should have done!!
@realDonaldTrump because then you have to admit that you are not a legitimately elected by the American people as a legitimately elected American President!

@TheRoyalPosts @seanhannity it's not an accredited University and it was a fraud scheme, it's ONLY purpose was to defraud people out of thousands of dollars for a FAKE

@delcaste @theratzpack @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski so Trump's only weapon left is Executive Orders, which is only as strong as the paper it's written on...
@delcaste @theratzpack @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski I know the House will flip too! A President is only as strong as the Majorities that they have in Congress
@delcaste @theratzpack @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski which WILL flip back to Democrats in 2018, there's no doubt about that... The House is where the challenge is but even with the challenge,
@delcaste @theratzpack @realDonaldTrump @lisamurkowski 2018 midterm elections is NOT that big of a hurdle in the Senate... The GOP's ONLY have a 2 Senator lead for the Majority in the Senate!!

@OneManRockr @KimBrker @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump and telling Obama what he "should" be doing as President while trolling him on Twitter... Good Lord! The stupidity of that orange tangerine!
@OneManRockr @KimBrker @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump He's been spending his last 8 years as "backseat President-ing" while insulting Obama on things that Donald Trump himself had no clue about
@OneManRockr @KimBrker @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump or that "NATO is no longer obsolete." And  "Gina is no longer a currency minipulator." Are these to be taken seriously or literally?
@OneManRockr @KimBrker @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump or if he didn't say shit like "I listened to the President of China for 10 mins and realized that it's more complicated than I thought"
@OneManRockr @KimBrker @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump See... I would prob. be inclided to agree whith you if Trump didn't say stupid shit like "who knew that healthcare was so complicated??"...
