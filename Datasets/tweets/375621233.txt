I want to help us to do better in #illinois to #retain our #T and making sure that myself and others, are presented to our Ss and #community with a #true #representation of the most #accurate and #current #professional #credentials @ISBEnews
The #inaccuracy of #data #position #titles has a tremendous #influence on a potential #candidate #hiring @ChiPubSchools or Any district.     (Hiring practices should be examined @CTULocal1)
My experience: Oglesby (#K8 #technology #teacher) Beethoven (#k8 Technology T/ Techco) Carver(Sub/K8Temporary Assigned Technology T/K8Technology Interventionist/6-8 Technology T) @ChiPubSchools, but this is not reflected @ISBEnews This is problematic for Not just me but all Ts
I was a #substitute in #Dekalb (not sure if sub info gets added, but it shud). Let’s look at the position titles @ChiPubSchools if an #administrator was reviewing my  @ISBEnews for #hiring purposes This #current #data does not reflect my CV or #true #professional #representation https://t.co/hJzVcBieZE
Now let’s move on to the #process of #accurate #data of #Teacher #experience #position #titles @ISBEnews I have experience in #several school #districts but @ChiPubSchools is the Only #district listed #Springfield #Illinois should be listed but there is no #data https://t.co/bcBg1trdkl
It does not present the #true #professional #profile of a T. Specifically, with my #degrees there shud be 2 more added @ISBEnews MA, from @NIUCOE   In #InstructionalTechnology (in which I did submit to @ISBEnews) and a PhD  @NIUCOE in #InstructionalTechnology (I did not submit)
T also want to make sure this is #accurate when they are applying for #jobs (other), In doing so it #equips them with the most #current #data they have to present themselves #professionally. When #degrees are not #accurate or in my case missing from @ISBEnews
Several reasons why the #accuracy of this #data is needed: Most if not all #employers and possibly #State #Government #agencies in the #Education field will #view your   @ISBEnews T #licensure to make sure you have the #credentials you say you do.
Let’s start with #ClearTheAir with the #process of #accurate #data When Ts in #Illinois graduate from an #accredited #Education #program the #degree should be #submitted by the S to @ISBEnews then it should get added to the #section under #degree on their    T #licensure https://t.co/OSOD8t8zjs

and choices.	&lt;-Great! Will you provide PD for effective use? Many teachers are extremely lacking the technology skills 2 effectively teach, especially in underrepresented communities in South and west sides of Chicago.		Modernizing and maintaining state-of-the-art classrooms 👇🏼
are more user friendly, and intuitive? To ensure a superior effective technology plan, do you plan on working with experts, teachers, and admin within CPS, that know exactly what is needed? 	Effective use of technology will expand teacher resources and educational offerings  👇🏼
....that all classrooms are superior state-of-the-art learning environments offering the technology needed to enhance instruction, education offerings and supports. 	&lt;-Great, so you will implement 1:1 devices for every school? And upgrade schools with technology systems that👇🏼

@JeffSolin @spencertweedy @ChiPubSchools @CTULocal1 @RYHAction @CPSuccessCHI 4. The way it stands now, reports are generated with a 24/48 hour window if a user/school is on task. AND some schools that may not have adequate technology, with teachers that lack technology skills, may require additional support to be in compliance by go live.
@JeffSolin @spencertweedy @ChiPubSchools @CTULocal1 @RYHAction @CPSuccessCHI 3. and only the system admin are allowed to track the data of completion..how does a user know if they completed that task?
