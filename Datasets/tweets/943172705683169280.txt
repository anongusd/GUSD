@TheDemocrats Question for @TheDemocrats. Why did you not do anything while @POTUS44 @Barrack_Obama44 was in office? You had the Presidency &amp; the majority in congress. But instead of doing anything about gun control, you just played scratch and sniff with eachithers asses.

@cloroxtroll @CNN Also i am sure the reason why FL state reps voted no to talking about banning assault rifles was because FL already has a ban on assualt rifels aka military grade weapons. 😂😂
@cloroxtroll @CNN Lol. Well this is why nothing can ever get done and why there are so many gun law loopholes...the people writing the bills have no clue what they are talking about.
@AP @MaraLiasson It didnt pass because FL already has a ban on assualt rifels aka military grade. The person who wrote the bill has no clue what they were talking about. An AR15 is not a assault rifle as it only fires a single round at a time. They need to write the banning AR15s.
RT @CNET: Elon Musk's plan to bring speedy broadband to the whole world	https://t.co/Br5GB3qhCQ
@CNN An assault rifle aka military grade is anything that fires 3 round bursts or full auto with a single pull of the trigger. AR15s are not an assault rifle, so a ban on assualt rifels would not ban the AR15. They would need to name the AR15 in the bill along with assault rifles.
@CNN Obviously the person writing this knows nothing about guns or the bill that FL proposed. The bill was for assault rifles not semis. A hand gun is a semi as a semi is anything that fires a single shot with a pull of the trigger.
Fact Check: Parenting in the U.S. ranks the lowest among the nations around the world. Youth related crimes are at an all time high amd continue to rise. #TheTimeIsNow for parents to take back the control they once had.
@SenateDems So they are only going to make a profit if they can recoup the money they paid out to buyback the shares. Until they make the money back they are going to be im the red. Just saying.
@SenateDems @SenateDems - your statement is not 100% correct. A buyback is when a company feels that they no longer need public support so they buy their shares back at market price. The companies are taking a huge risk by doing this because they could go for broke.

@Ericolie1 @CNN ....that makes it an assault rifle. I think the issue to why people are confused goes back to how it looks. Now people can legally buy mods for it to make it an assault rifle, which i believe the mods should have a ban on them.
@Ericolie1 @CNN People have a misconception of what an assault rifle is. Assault rifles are banned in most states, but the states they are legal, the average starting selling price is $12,000. Now if your talking AR15, that has been modified to sell to the public &amp; no longer has the parts.....

@ABC I don't know about that @realDonaldTrump, but i will say that the @FBI fucked up and people need to lose their jobs over this.
@Kartos @CNN Well that has everything to do with him. He could use other things besides a gun if he has a temper. But I get what you are saying and I agree that people should be mentally fit to own a gun.
@loloworldclass @boiledmaplesap @CNN You are correct. But i think some of these kids just need a good old fashion ass spanking. We all had it, and we all turned out fine. Most parents dont believe in spankings now a days or are to scared because someone might report them.
@loloworldclass @boiledmaplesap @CNN agreed. we should have mandatory training. anyone who owns a gun should have their finger prints loaded in the the FBI database. Different mods need to a ban. We can do all that, but with out teaching basic human interactions to the youth, i honestly nothing will change.
I want to take this time to apologize to anyone I offended with my views on different topics. I understand that not everyone will agree with me, and I will not agree with everyone. So please, lets have adult conversations, and learn from each other with out the name calling.
@mistisangbangus @CNN I get the point. I served in the military. I was also in the boy scouts. I was taught to respect these weapons. I was also taught coping skills, and how to be social and civil. Something that most kids these days lack.
@loloworldclass @boiledmaplesap @CNN But I do get what your saying. We do need more regulations, but people are not calling for the right kind of regulations. We will never see an out right ban. We need mandatory gun safety training. All gun owners need to have their finger prints in the FBI database...etc..
@loloworldclass @boiledmaplesap @CNN The AR15 may cosmetically look like military rifles, they do not function the same way. You would have to put a good deal of money into the AR15 with modifications to make it a military grade weapon. Military grade weapons will cost your any where for $12,000 and up.
@Kartos @CNN I think i also states some where in this thread that kids have no concept of what it means to lose because everyone is a winner, which is pretty much removing on concept of coping skills. The basics of deal with life has gone out the door and this started in the 90s.
@Kartos @CNN I never said that we do not need more regulations. I did how ever point out that the reason more kids and young adults are committing these crimes is do to the fact that we live in a society where it is frowned upon to discipline your kids.
@Kartos @CNN I think your missing the point. But thats okay because most people dont want to blame themselves
@boiledmaplesap @loloworldclass @CNN True. But back then people knew the difference between right and wrong. People were more social and spent more time outdoors.  Also i think another issue is the internet and social media. There is a lot of factors messing with the minds of the youth now.
@DC_Cat4 @loloworldclass @CNN I think your confused with a automatics, which i agree, they have no reason to be in a hand of a citizen. Also i think all mods that convert semi into autos should have a ban as well. If we want to talk about an AR15, i can tell you there are far more powerful handguns out there.
@DC_Cat4 @loloworldclass @CNN Not sure if you understand guns and rifles. But everything should in america for the most part is a semiautomatic, which is what your basic handgun is. Just because they are made to look like a military style weapon, does not make it one. A semi is a single round burst as an fyi.
@laura76964306 @CNN That is true. Thats why i am not saying we do not need some gun law reform. And those points i made were just off the top of my head.but the way kids are being raised simce the mid 90s have changed a lot and not for the better.
@CNN Dont get me wrong, yes we need to tighten up our gun laws, but that is only part of the issue. Parents need to start disciplining their kids again. I am not saying beat them but they do need a good ass whooping from time to time. Hell we all turned out fine for the most part.
@DJEl_Fuego @CNN Because kids are not held accountable for anything anymore. Have you not noticed since DHS has been coming after parents for disciplining their kids, more crimes are happening by kids. We cant deny that as it is a fact.
@loloworldclass @CNN They havent changed in over 60 years. We havent had mass shootings like this until recently.
@stevemag19 @CNN True, but parents also do not have to watch everything they do when they discipline their kids in other countries either. Like i said we as Americans did this to ourselves.
@CNN Parents dont discipline their kids. Doctors are quick to lable a kid and give them medications, because of it. We as Americans needs to fix the issues we allow to happen in our homes. Teach consequences and not award bad behavior.
@CNN The issue is not the guns. The guns havent changed. The issues is with the way kids are being rasied. Parents let their kids become anti-social by letting them waste away in front of the TV and computers playing first person shooter games.
I want to see #Congress and #DOJ come down on the #FBI for not acting on the #ParklandFlorida shooter tip. People need to be fired amd someone needs to go to jail.
@CharredMC @QuidProWTF @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes i agree, laws need to be tightened on gun ownership, but that is not the root of the problem nor is it going to stop this from happening again.
@CharredMC @QuidProWTF @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump (2/2) 3) violence is seen as normal due to the fact these kids are playing first person shooter games. 4) Doctors lable and put more kids on medication now then every before. 5) Parents just dont give a rats ass anymore and let their kids do what they want when they want.
@CharredMC @QuidProWTF @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump (1/2) Guns are not the problem. Ask yourself what has changed over the last 50 years? 1) Parents are afraid to discipline thier children because they do not want to be reported to DHS. 2) Kids are anti-social because they sit in front of the TV &amp; computers playing video games.

@bren2915 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi (2/2) A wall would cost more upfront, but would still be less over time. I can think of a few things that the government could spend the extra $20 billion dollars extra they are proposing to use every year on border security.
@bren2915 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi (1/2) He wants to increase the number of drones in the air, put more boots on the ground, along with high tech motion detectors, etc. We currently spend roughly $20 billion per year now. What the Dems want to do, would nearly double that.
When will the #FBI be held accountable for not acting on the #Parkland shooter tip that they received a month before it happened?
@HouseDemocrats NEWS FLASH: Working Americans pays the bill for everything the government spends money on. Without working Americans the government would not have the money to pay for anything.
@bren2915 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi The bipartisan plans never made it to Trumps desk because they didmt get support in the house or senate. The issue with those plans are they only offered 800k protection, not citizenship. Thats a big problem. Also Schumer plab has military drones protecting the border.
@CharredMC @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Did you know that many of the Russians indicted worked the G20 Summit in 2013 where top Obama admin officials including Clinton attended right before the operation started. Concord Management &amp; Consulting LLC &amp; Concord Catering were the event planners and caters for the G20.
@SenSanders Also add a law that anyone who is qualified to own a gun and wants to own a gun, should be mandated to take gun safty courses regulated by the FBI.
@SenSanders Yes we need to tighten our background checks. But did you know just about every weapon sold in the US is semiautomatic? If you own a hand gun its a semiautomatic. Automatics and 3 round busts are considered assault weapons.
@SenSchumer @SenSchumer your right. He doesnt want to protect them, he wants to offer 1.8 million #Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. You and @NancyPelosi only wants to protect the 800k orginal #DACADreamers by only offering protective status without citizenship. Stop using the #Dreamers.
Need To Know: Concord Management &amp; Consulting LLC and Concord Catering worked the #G20Summit in 2013 where top Obama officials including Hillary Clinton attended just months before they started interfering with the 2016 election. #MuellerInvestigation #MuellerIndictment
@SalDg00z @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It also started right after the G20 Summit that was held in Russia in 2013. Funny thing is Concord Management &amp; Consulting LLC and Concord Catering worked the G20 summit where top Obama officials including Hillary attended.

@viewsofonewoman @RepMaxineWaters @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I honestly dont believe Trump is smart or dumb enough to hire Russians to interfere in US politics. Someone did, but I do not believe it was Trump. Muller and his team are during a great job.
The problem with our country and our #Government is that they do not read before making statements like the one below. The Russians started their operation in early 2014. It was not until June 2015, when #Trump announced he was running for @POTUS. Thats 1.5 years after the fact. https://t.co/Pez7ImL7rH
@RepMaxineWaters Did you read the indictment? The Russian operation begun in early 2014. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump did not announces his candidacy for the U.S. presidency until June 2015 at Trump Tower in New York City. Thats a year and a half after the Russians begun their operation.
Here is a question for all Government officials. When illegal immigrants vote in any U.S. election (local, state, &amp; fed), isn't that foreign interference? But yet, many local &amp; state governments are allowing this to happen to push their voting numbers up. #MuellerInvestigation

@SenSanders Is because it doesnt cost $1200 for an IV bag, or $100 to see your PCP. You cant run universal healthcare with the current system.
@SenSanders Please stop pushing Universal Healthcare. You have to fix the high medical costs first. You tried this in your state of VT, and it failed due to cost. You even raised taxes by 16%. Fix the high charges, then talk Universal Healthcare. The reason it works in other countries.......

@RealDeal2AD @justanavywife @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Agreed. We have 2 single payers systems in the US now, #Medicare &amp; #Tricare. Both suck and are going for broke. Before the US attempts to give #Medicare4All, they need to fixed the over priced medical system. Plus i dont trust the government enough to control my health.
@SenSanders @SenSanders before you can even think about a #SinglePayer System in the United States, you must fix the high costs. The US has 2 single payer systems, #Medicare &amp; #Tricare, both are failing due to cost. You will spin the country into a crisis without fixing the costs first.

@traceyshughart @ANTIantifaCA @JoeNBC @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @SenateGOP @CNN is reporting that this is not going to end well for @TheDemocrats if they lose the #DACADeal they had in their pocket. It was agreed that both sides would stick to the deal and work out the details by Feb 8. The Dems broke the deal in less then 24 hours of making it.
@SenSchumer &amp; @TheDemocrats have gone back on their part of the #DACA deal they made in exchange for $25 billion dollars to fund #TrumpWall. This deal was looking good for #Dreamers in their path for #Citizenship . But @HouseDemocrats &amp; @SenateDems have crushed that dream today.
@traceyshughart @ANTIantifaCA @JoeNBC @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @SenateGOP Like Obama said insurance will be cheaper, and CHIP would no longer be needed with the ACA.

@CNN @SenateDems Also anyone who doesnt understand politics, 60 votes were needed to pass a budget, there are only 51 @SenateGOP. Republicans may control #Congress but they still need @TheDemocrats to get bills past.
@CNN 100% a #DemocratShutdown. @SenateDems failed to listen to the American people who said pass a budget, you still have time for #DACA. 40% of Americans on some kind of Government assistance may not have what they need now. You also let down the #Military.
With the #2018Midterms approaching, the #AmericanPeople will not forget that @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems did not put #AmericaFirst when they went against 56% of the #AmericanPeople to avoid a #shutdown2018. The same polls also stated that #Americans blame @TheDemocrats.
@SenSchumer would be correct, except for the fact that the @SenateGOP only has 51 votes. 60 votes is needed to pass, meaning 9 @SenateDems needed to vote to come up with a solution.
The @SenateDems are blaming the @SenateGOP for not passing a #FY18budget and continue to say they control the House, the Senate, and the @WhiteHouse. But @TheDemocrats are banking on the #AmericanPeople to believe them.
@SenateDems cause the #shutdown2018. Despite what the #AmericanPeople wanted, @TheDemocrats would not approve a #FY2018Budget without a #DACADeal. https://t.co/mpONnm4F0Y
@JoeNBC This is a @SenateDems/@HouseDemocrats #shutdown as they can not move past a #DACADeal which has nothing to do with the #FY18budget. @TheDemocrats are putting the lives of 40% of American people at risk who rely on gov. assistance, and not to mention the lives of fed employees.
@RepPeteAguilar @SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats Not really a smart move for @TheDemocrats with the #2018Midterms right around the corner.
@RepPeteAguilar @SenateGOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats Also you do understand, that @CNN polls showed that 56% of Americans wanted you to avoid a #shutdown. Also just a little FYI, 31% of Americas stated that @HouseDemocrats/@SenateDems are to blame for a #shutdown and only 26% blame @HouseGOP/@SenateGOP.
@RepPeteAguilar You are kidding me right? You do know it takes 60 votes to pass, and there are only 51 @SenateGOP. Meaning 9 @SenateDems were needed to pass a #FY2018Budget. So you really mean that, @TheDemocrats could not get passed the #DACA Deal which you still have until March to make happen
56% of Americans want to avoid a #GovermentShutdown. But @SenateDems would rather play chicken with more then 200 million American lives. This is a risky move knowing that this is a mid-term election year. 		https://t.co/CCaTMAXPHE
