But behind the tedium of talking to a woman while apparently picking his kid up from sports practice, O'Rourke did accomplish the task of making life in a border city look about as humdrum and crisis free as possible. https://t.co/hnXllqe6EO
The interviews O'Rourke has offered this week aren't must-see TV and they'll never rate like The Apprentice.
When President Donald Trump gave a scripted 9-minute speech to the nation about the crisis on the border with Mexico, O'Rourke streamed live from El Paso for more than 90 minutes.
To a possible challenger who who has to tell people apparently at his child's sports practice that he's filming them before asking them about their daily lives.
Maybe this is the natural progression from a President who tweets at all hours about whatever is on his mind.

This is the key thing he just said - "You're changing culture." Trump agrees with the white nationalists on that point.

So clearly Trump meant every word he said on Monday.
Now he's defending the alt-right. "What about the alt-left," US President asks, when challenged about white supremacists.
how is this possible? https://t.co/KMJGWR6MUi

To recap: In the past week Trump  had us seriously talking about nuclear war and why he wouldn't disavow KKK, white nationalists.
Upon reflection, "racism is evil."
"He said a minimum of what he needed to say," per @margarettalev on @CNN.
Trump has made it so that it is news that the POTUS says, "Racism is evil."
You wouldn't think so https://t.co/fAvRs2JoDw
Even if Trump does strongly condemn KKK and racism, etc., we know he would have preferred not to and is only doing so under extreme duress.
When Trump initially refused to condemn David Duke, Marco Rubio said it made him unelectable. It did not.
Bill Clinton was the master of emergency declaration. 17!!! https://t.co/6plc8GgDUv
