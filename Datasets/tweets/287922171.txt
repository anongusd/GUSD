@raven3658 @Marriott That sucks!!
@imwithher61 Very cute!
@moorehn Basically, he believed that the ego diverted us from those career pursuits that give our life meaning. If we end up following our ego, we run the risk of becoming a Darth Vader-like person. Last, he always said to follow your bliss then the whole world will open up.
@moorehn Yes the interview he did with Bill Moyers, The Power of Myth, is a great place to start. The interviews were conducted in the last months of his life.
@Rizabellepow @ZerlinaMaxwell I believe it. He should not be proud of that statement. The true statement is Bernie and Trump are very much alike.
@comicsdaughter @peterdaou I am afraid the answer is yes.
@moorehn That is precisely the philosophy Joesph Campbell articulated.

@SmashingPumpkin @LiveNation @NoelGallagher @AFI Awesome!!
@dezgn4u @AOC Decision could have been made by a senior staffer.
@dezgn4u @AOC It will!
@dezgn4u @AOC My guess is they like the concept and want some limelight so that it looks like they are doing something.
I hope this will be the final tweet on the #GreenNewDeal. Legislation introduced by @aoc will not become law. The bill will die in the over 20 committees and subcommittees to which it was referred. Should the bill by chance become law, it is a Sense of Congress Resolution only.
@Cwedding1 It definitely violates the gag order in my view.

@gksutto @tomwatson Not sure about that. Bernie derives great satisfaction from losing but pushing candidates further left.

@1pissedPolack I am so sorry to read this news.
@rfhurt @funder @whitehouserogue A vote to over turn a National Emergency is spelled out in the law that gives any president the ability to declare a National Emergency.  The House votes then the Senate votes. If the president vetoes they can vote to override. That’s it.

@BritishRaider69 @LarrySabato @TexasTribune So sorry to hear.
@Goss30Goss @GOP It is so totally disgusting. Are they all traitors?
@NRCC Not only no, but HELL NO!
Despicable! https://t.co/vw7iqjCpMd
@steakhousegirl @fawfulfan @SenGillibrand Totally agree. The United States Senate is the pinnacle of her career.
@Goss30Goss Exactly what I posted. We are heading for another 9-11.
@steakhousegirl @fawfulfan @SenGillibrand And me. She really has no business running for POTUS.
When a president ignores data provided by his Intel Chiefs, the nation is on the way to disaster.
@LarrySabato @TexasTribune Unbelievable that a state government can be so poorly run.

@lisastark351 @di_lynne No way as a Dem.
@AngelaBelcamino Nay
@Betotei46972255 @ananavarro Trump kept the government shut for 35 days and ended up exactly where he started. The Congress holds all the cards. I believe the next compromise will be to fund tiny sections of border wall where it is most needed according to the Dept of Homeland Security.
@Plantflowes Bernie is only for Bernie.
@ClistonBrown Count me in!
@ananavarro So be it!! Please Lindsey tell him to resign.
@pdacosta So glad to see the Speaker ask these questions. Paul Ryan was such a limp rag.

@imwithher61 And one that I, you, and so many of us would gladly accept.
@pdacosta I am getting ready for Trump to say something like that.
Looks like we do have a three week deal to open the government for three weeks. I may be cautiously optimistic.
@HighheelsDes @woodruffbets Just wait until Junior gets arrested and indicted.

@Ironhorse76 You are not alone!
@EMPRESSROOTSGAL @pdacosta Yes they are!

@DevilDawg36 Daniel, I forgot they played on a neutral site. Of course, I remembered the score of the Purdue game. We played horribly. Purdue also beat Iowa. Ohio State rebounded very well since losing to Purdue. They beat the hell out of Michigan
Georgia got their butts kicked by LSU. They won the other division in the SEC because the other teams suck. The Committee’s bias toward the SEC is sickening. #CFBPlayoff
Oklahoma lost to Texas at home. They barely beat Oklahoma St and WVU. Ohio State would score 60 on them.
The Committee absolutely got it wrong today with picks 3-6. Notre Dame is a slightly better than average team. The barely beat BALL STATE, Pitt, USC, and Michigan. ND will get killed by Clemson.
@john_keim Losing to Texas at HOME is nothing special. The Bucks fought through adversity all year with their coach and losing the best defensive player in College football. The CFP Committee sucks.

@moorehn Heidi, it is a great article on Wade Davis and his evolution. My comment, even pre-coffee, is meant to acknowledge that some men have evolved and are invested in actually learning about the lives of women they date and have as friends. I am one of those men.

@ForQ2 @RandyVoteblue https://t.co/qTy8zOQm9T
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Whitaker cannot serve as Acting AG without Senate confirmation. Your so-called appointment violates the Constitution. The AG reports directly to the president and must be confirmed. Deputy AG Rosenstein is the acting AG.
Reporters @CNN and @MSNBC should be talking about this issue. @Maddow this op-ed is right up your alley. Trump’s Appointment of the Acting Attorney General Is Unconstitutional. https://t.co/qTy8zOQm9T
@NatashaBertrand The more fundamental question is Whitaker even allowed to assume the office without Senate confirmation? The answer appears to be no.  @SallyQYates, the last acting AG, was confirmed by the Senate in 2015. Deputy AG Rosenstein, according to the Constitution, should be acting AG.

@drenamay1 Does not matter when he registered as a Republican. The dude is out of his mind. He acted out on all of Trump’s BS.
The fundamental question that must be asked is how many more lone Trumpistan wolfs are out there? I bet there will be copy cats. #MAGAbomber

@politvidchannel Awesome news!!! @julibriskman have you seen this latest poll?
It is confirmed. A 12th package was found at a mail facility in mid-town Manhattan. This one was addressed to James Clapper. #MorningJoe #MAGABomber
Sen. Cory Booker stay strong. Do not let these scare tactics keep you from voicing your well-intentioned dissent to the administration and your colleagues in the Senate.
The Secretary of Homeland Security should be forced to resign for being more concerned about the so-called caravan than pipe bombs being sent to ex-Presidents, Vice Presidents, and others. Giving an interview on Fox News with shades on at the border is a joke. #MorningJoe

@NoahCRothman Noah, I will be the first to say that whenever you appear on Morning Joe, you have been professional and spot on in your analysis. I was watching today's show in real time when you suggested that it can't be proven that Trump caused the bombing attempts.
@SethAbramson Totally disgusting. I am betting that Trump will soon mimic their line.
@JoeNBC what if Schumer and Pelosi already made an attempt to issue a joint statement but were rebuffed? #MorningJoe
I am stunned that @NoahCRothman suggested on @Morning_Joe that Trump is not responsible for inciting violence against our citizens. The bombs are just the latest example. 45 is empowering the worst in Americans. #MorningJoe #MAGABomber
@pdacosta He is proving that a narcissist can never be wrong and never take responsibility.
Will @PressSec offer another lame statement today regarding the mass assassination attempt against citizens and former presidents and vice president? So much for peach and harmony. #MorningJoe #MAGABomber
Donald Trump, by his words and actions, is showing that a narcissist is never wrong, no responsibility taken. #MorningJoe

@frankgaffney I strongly suggest that you reconsider what you wrote here. You sound like a loon.
If @realDonaldTrump uses inflammatory language again tonight at his rally, all reporters should walk out. Shut down the broadcast. I can guarantee that Trump will not calm down his mob. #MAGABomber
Let me get this right. @realDonaldTrump asks for unity after threatening to lock up and assassinate political opponents, states the press is the enemy of the people, targets CNN, dehumanizes immigrants, and inflames his supporters. Too late spanky. #MAGABomber

Dear @60Minutes, I implore you to never again interview Donald Trump. He’s a gaslighter and unbecoming of a president. He should not be given a platform from which to spew his propaganda. #60MinutesTrump
@realDonaldTrump I did not watch one second. Why would I? You lie every time you open your mouth.
@StacyDAlessand3 Very....
Trump is now saying "Rogue killers" could have killed journalist, Jamal Khasoggi. What a dope. Like Rogue killers could have gotten into the Saudi Embassy. #TrumpLies #Khashoggi
@StacyDAlessand3 I am sure he could, but it likely will do no good.
Great news for Democrats! https://t.co/R6ecg6XKWD
Trump blandly lied to Leslie Stahl during the 60 Minutes interview. He bloody does well know what happened to Jamal Khasoggi. His intelligence community informed him immediately.
Cincy finds more ways to lose to the Steelers. It’s just amazing. #Bengals
@kathygriffin That’s gross. I hope he wears those boots when he’s indicted.
@David_Leavitt I like that idea!!!
I had a great time at The Shoe yesterday. The Bucks have a number one offense but a number 50 defense. #Buckeyes https://t.co/l4z11nXpBZ
Why didn’t @jaketapper ask Bernie if he intended to run as a Dem or Indie? If as a Dem, he should ask how can he when he just stiffed the Democratic Party as he runs for Senate in 2018. #CNNSOTU

@AuthorKimberley I have a better chance of beating Trump.
Excellent news. Secretary Mnuchin should grow a pair and follow suit. #Khashoggi https://t.co/tfZsi5b8Li
@jimsciutto @JohnJHarwood Mnuchin has cover from Trump. He will in the end support his master.
@StacyDAlessand3 @GOP He has no soul.
@RGanley You are spot on. I know the odds are slim. But Americans must continue to ask Congress to stand up.
@skidmore11 You raise a legitimate point but this issue could well be one where American political interests break with Israel. Time will tell.
Health care will be one of the flash points in the midterm elections. https://t.co/3En6Jy8XAS
@StacyDAlessand3 @GOP Trump did not even know/acknowledge that he was a resident. He is disgusting.
@mattklewis Matt, I generally respect and admire your analysis. We do not always agree but that is politics. This tweet is beneath you. Wouldn't it be stronger to say commentators/journalists at this time in history need to master public policy and rise above political tribalism?
Donald Trump is completely and utterly compromised with the Saudis. So is Jared Kushner. Will the Congress step up and check Trump? Jewish leaders in the US need to apply maximum pressure. #MorningJoe
What I just saw on @Morning_Joe regarding the likely murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi disgusts me. Trump only cares about himself, his money. His response disqualifies him as the leader of this nation. #MorningJoe
@BuckeyesGirl33 He really does. Retirement is his next move.
Eli Manning should consider retirement. #ThursdayNightFootball
I am not surprised. Turks tell U.S. officials they have audio and video recordings that support conclusion Khashoggi was killed. https://t.co/gOhBce9GFp

They should be. What Mr. Kemp is doing with exact match is criminal. #MorningJoe https://t.co/QuuCYJDel3
Georgia's exact match program is a travesty for democratic participation. Mr. Kemp should recuse himself from his job. Heidi made great points on this issue today on @Morning_Joe. #MorningJoe https://t.co/pG5M46KNPW
Trump's nonsense pep rally in Erie, PA shows that HE is the leader and promoter of the angry mob. Calling Democrats the angry mob is a distraction pure and simple. #MorningJoe
Donny Deutch was spot on @Morning_Joe today. Trump conned the people that he was a big-time CEO. In reality, it is a small time licensing business with no board or shareholders. Trump is a fake. #MorningJoe
Jared Kushner needs to go to jail now. Providing intel to the Saudi Crown Prince. No wonder the Trump administration failed to warn the Saudi journalist. #TheLastWord

@lillithadams1 @nytimes Or if they owned part of the NYT during the campaign.
So the @nytimes knew that there was a counter-intelligence investigation into Trump's campaign prior to the 2016 election but refused to run the story. What the hell. The Times gave us a dictator. Shame on the NY Times. #Maddow

@dezgn4u Damn it to hell!!
@SRuhle Why aren't you and your partner on right now?
@good_cooke @lindeeloo_who Yes it is. I wonder how many did not vote for president in 2016?
Wouldn't it be delicious if Nikki Haley runs against Lindsey Graham?
Nikki Haley can say she will not run in 2020 but any intelligent person knows that decision can change in a heartbeat.
@good_cooke @lindeeloo_who Millennials need to get off their ass and vote.
@lindeeloo_who I totally agree with you. It is time to retire a lot of Republicans.
The president is lying his ass off as he sits next to Nikki Haley.
@JohnJHarwood Hidden genius? What a crock of you know what.
Nikki Haley’s resignation effectively end the political high Trump manufactured via Kavanaugh. #RunNikkiRun

@Acosta @julibriskman The same can be said of Senator McConnell. What he labeled as an assault was nothing more than citizens petitioning elected officials.
