No performance in a "horror" film has captured the heart of darkness in a human heart like Bruno Ganz in Downfall. The scene has been much parodied. It's good to see the electrifying original. https://t.co/EDMBPQFAwG via @YouTube
THE FRONT RUNNER was an important breakthrough in the 70's for LGBTQ fiction. But today, the relationship between coach and athlete would be criticized for other reasons. Patrical a great writer. https://t.co/UwDFNRYo9Z
@thinwhiteduke0 @NPRWeekend @RepDonBacon What do you suggest, Zach? That a news organization only talk to Democrats? It's news that a Republican doesn't like the emergency declaration. News is what we do. He may not be a favorite of yours, but the news has to cover all kinds of ideas and people you may not like.
@sajuarosystole I had no idea of his race. But I think if you survey the list of prominent mass shootings over, say, the past year, you will find them overwhelmingly white males.
@girlcanread It IS tempting. Alas, I find that when I try to call a moose, only our dog comes running, I clearly need practice and expert advice.
@CDRutledge Clark, I do not know rep's record on gay rights. If he is not yet open to same sex marriage, his own state of Nebraska enshrines marriage equality already. I am not familiar that he has uttered homophobic or anti-Semitic remarks. Having him on doesn't "normalize" bigotry.
@Special_Like_U @KellyReynoldskd @RepDonBacon @NPRWeekend I’m not sure anyone can measure up to such exacting standards. Don Bacon served in the USAF for 30 yrs, and receive 2 Distinguished Service Crosses, 2 Bronze Stars, Distinguished Service Medal. You’re both entitled to express any opinion without reflexive contempt.
@RobotWhatIsLove @NPRinskeep @JudyWoodruff I don’t believe I’ve ever interviewed him.
@MegHambach @def729 Then let me point out: there are people who grow up in Beverly Hills—much less Willoughby—w/ violence in the home, surroundings, family that injures and warps them. Doesn’t excuses reprehensible behavior. But you can’t have both parents, most uncles, in prison w/out effect.
@MegHambach @def729 I don’t believe I mentioned Willoughby. At all, save for this tweet. I did mention family upbringing.
@DanielBertsch1 @NPRWeekend We raised precisely that point. You may not be pleased that Trump himself cited that bringing home troops would help him pay for a wall. The person we interviewed said ending foreign military involvements would not save nearly as much money as interest costs and social programs.
@stu_rush @JuniorKnits Hmm. Maybe. I dunno. Let me think about that. Hmm. Maybe. Not sure. Hmmmmmmm...
@def729 @MegHambach I know Willoughby. He was born in Elyria, often called “crime-ridden Elyria.” His mother moved family for high school—to get them out of those circumstances. Most authority figures around him went to prison, on drug charges. It excuses nothing. But it’s a fact of his upbringing.

@scottstev Perhaps, Steven. But I don't think we know yet if it wasn't passed along to a party who passed it along. Extortion might still be charged; perhaps not hacking. BTW, one of the first things editors remind us is "begs the question" often means the opposite of how people use it.

@kyleholtan Oh piffle Kyle. You might be letting polemics blind you to poetics. I admire him for standing up to extortion. But a man who made a fortune by accumulating personal details on millions passed along something intimately personal. No defense of AMI to point out irony.
@jem27 @4Crisis Yes. But right now, I’m not sure the phone was hacked. There are, of course, other ways to get information out of a phone. There are some reports right now suggesting that. Using it for extortion, however, would still be a crime.
@1410gal It's just one question. Technology used by his companies asks for access to our photos for certain programs. It could happen to any of us. I'm just surprised anyone thought those photos would somehow be immune (and of course, it's possible the person receiving them shared them).
@dwbourgeois Forgive me, David, but that analogy is ridiculous. He is not a rape victim. He is the richest man in the world, who has admirably refused to knuckle under, and stepped forward. But technology he uses shares personal details of others every second. I'm just surprise by naivete.
@4Crisis You might want to read my very first two sentences. I said just the opposite, didn't I?
@treygraham There is no reason to be ashamed of human sexuality, Trey. I admire him for coming forward. But I hope a man who helped invent, and certainly monetized, a high-tech revolution that shares personal information will now reflect more on how it can be used against people, too.
@that70sheaux Of course it's not his fault. But think of the innumerable ways technology he has implemented poaches and shares some of our intimate details. Did he think that others wouldn't use that kind of technology some day to share his?
I think this story raises urgent questions about free speech, intimidation, and political influence. It should be pursued. But shouldn't a high-tech giant, the richest man in the world, know it's foolish to send people intimate selfies of himself? https://t.co/0afquPrVVz

It is good to see these folks just introduced, free at last. But he’s using that applause to launch into an appeal for his wall. Where did he see caravans?
The president derides, “ridiculous partisan investigations.” What about wise and necessary investigations?
I think jumping up to clap is the most exercise some members of the cabinet have seen in while.

@TankBeerMath Kim, you're judging the family as a unit, not the people as individuals. I don't think every Kennedy can be blamed for the actions of Joseph P., etc. Every person gets the right to be judged alone.
@simon_schama Arise Sir Simon!
@KingTalkyTeeks @TankBeerMath Tiki, isn’t hating a family guilt by association? What generation will you stop hating them? And if you don’t like their siblings, what about cousins? Where do you stop? Etc. When are people judged on their own?
@bonhogue @nprmontagne @CrysLWilliams A way of conveying place. A lot of people like it. Culver City right outside LA. But it would not be correct to say LA. Journalism is in the details.
@TankBeerMath Kim, I’m not sure any real family would meet your requirements. My daughters are 15 and 12. I certainly hope no one blames them for anything reprehensible I do or say. They have a right to be judged on their own, and independent of each other, too.
@RefillTheSwamp Also brothers to the sister, Laura Ricketts, who is a noted human rights and LGBTQ activist. At some point, everyone is responsible for themselves. https://t.co/n9x6uTz5ZC
@Dunewalker1 I don't believe any city or state funds were involved. They did received federal tax credits for Wrigley restoration, as it's considered a landmark. https://t.co/MpjOcCdUbS The city and state did approve plans, but that's the law, and charged the club for work.
@AnnLaabs @Cubs Yes, and that money has also helped Laura Ricketts be a gay rights activist. The children make their own choices, independent of their father, and each other, for that matter.
@TankBeerMath Well, the Ricketts fortune also permits Laura Ricketts to be a major backer of gay rights causes, and Theo Epstein, for that matter, to be a noted HRC supporter.
Yes, I've read this. Reprehensible. But Tom Ricketts says, “My father is not involved with the operation of the Chicago Cubs in any way...These emails do not reflect the culture we’ve worked so hard to build at the Chicago Cubs since 2009.” https://t.co/EWvvL4iEyI

@pt51 I did tweet tje Puppy Bowl!
Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl 17 years ago. I heard about it in Afghanistan, on @BBCWorld He is an agent of history.
I don’t think @RamsNFL are calling the best possible plays.
@BruceSBarnett @washingtonpost @tomhanks Yes.
Been waiting for it. I like the @washingtonpost ad. I’m sure I’m not the target demo, but think about it....
Historic interception, potentially, but still too much time just to run out the clock, yes?
That’s how it’s done.
RT @OfficialJLD: No words. https://t.co/Si0noZVq07
Another great punt. That’s becoming the story of the game.
3-3. Puppy Bowl was scintillating by contrast.
Now this is entertainment! https://t.co/wRHIdMTL9k
I’m not sure what it was promoting, but that spot reuniting a coach with the people who saved his life was worth it.
@hpnyknits You’re right if you see it by ethnicity. But what if you see it by sexualizing gender in these times when women should not be seen that way?
That was a great punt. I gather that’s what this game is coming down to.
Uh, I don’t think that was a wardrobe malfunction.
Been eating fabulous vegetable paella and toasting Puppy Bowl for reminding us how animals are our fellow travelers on this planet and we should cherish their companionship. And just 3-0 in that other game? Sheesh...
I know the @Patriots just kicked a field goal. They are still behind Team Fluff.
Gotta say, I love the water-bowl cam. Thinking of trying a Sauvignon Blanc cam here.
Bumble MVP! MVP! MVP!
@WajahatAli Wajahat, you may borrow “schmuck” from me. Use it in good health. Enjoy it.
Great field goal, Fluf!!!!
Lola comes to play, doesn’t she!
@WajahatAli @PopeyesChicken Gosh that sounds delicious! Paella for us—our Spanish and Puerto Rican godfathers, and a vague nod to our Spanish-Jewish and Basque antecedents, too. Plus, it’s delicious. Oh, and seaweed. Our common heritage.
Yes, I know another game is starting. And we’ll catch up with that. But this Puppy Bowl is sooo close!
The tension of this tie game is getting to me. Go Fluff, but you gotta respect that those Ruffians don’t quit!
@peggyolsonj We noticed that too, Peggy.
Our family would welcome Flo in a New York second. Those eyes. That spark. But I’m glad someone near her beloved beach will make room for her.
Dawn scores! Go, Fluff!
Okay, got to make this joke: are we sure the toy Brad the dog had in his mouth wasn’t slightly...deflated?
I shouldn’t e surprised Emmit made the first score, I suppose. Hey, Smudge, get your cute little head in the game, guy!
I always find the playing of the National Anthem at Puppy Bowl unexpectedly moving. Yes, pets do give a lot of service, in all ways.
This team Ruff looks...well...rough competition, doesn’t it? But I’m sticking by my Fluff prediction.

@issk01 As I keep saying: if they don't have the evidence, the story is wrong. Period. Full stop. And the next time that an accurate story is reported, BuzzFeed has given @POTUS a gift to ridicule an accurate story. This can happen when you're after clicks, not a real audience.

Gabbard's history of gay-bashing, don't you?
@issk01 I think yr telling yrself a story you are certain is true, and you want to be true, is true. But in journalism &amp;  law, "not accurate" w/out evidence. Nothing true w/out evidence. I don't think Mueller cares about political effect. But BF should care about effect on journalism.
@issk01 I repeat, Steve--that would be to accuse Mueller of being disingenuous. Besides, if Mueller doesn't have the evidence, who does, and would that matter? He was a Marine officer, who learned how dangerous it is to quibble about truth. Don't think he'd do that here.
@danceNdrama1 Oh yes! Great director of performance arts.

@WajahatAli Of course you’re right, Wajahat. It’s just he’s done that doink so many times this season, at critical moments. But their talents are why they’re on the field (and you and I are on our couches).
Just figured it out: is it the @Eagles strategy to rest Nick Foles most of the season until they really need him? Pretty damn brilliant.
The @Eagles are a great, game team. The @ChicagoBears too. I feel sorry for Cody Parkey, a good guy who might be in another line of work soon.
Kickers tend to be slim and nerveless.
Tarik Cohen, whatever else happens, just entered @ChicagoBears pantheon.
Tarik! Go!!!!!!!
Just taught our daughters a new word that I hope they’ll forget.
Oh, shoot, nice play @Eagles, and can’t beat the timing.
Best defense on goal line stand against SB champs—this is poetic. @ChicagoBears @Eagles
Okay, two minutes, five points, in the zone—this is exciting.
Amazing that this @MichaelBennet on the @Eagles is apparently also senator from Colorado. Guess he can only play because of the shutdown.
Play didn’t work, but still the kind of creative call I like to see.
Glad to see the @ChicagoBears draw close with another FG. What’s this thing I hear the announcers talk about called a touchdown? That’s a scoring play, too? I think I saw Gale Sayers do that once in an old video.
@elqqazz @ChicagoBears @Eagles Bronco!
@byagoda The Bears have a history of great Jewish players (Sid Luckman), mediocre players with Jewish names (Rex Grossman, Jay Cutler), and great players like Tarik Cohen who has a wonderful sense of humor about his name.
@JoeCleary2 I loved trying to watch that game!
So far this @ChicagoBears @Eagles game has everything but scoring.
As I understand the rule on that last catch, an official recovered the ball, so he gets to run the next play?
That was a beautiful pass play. And the hits at the end are why I’ve found it so hard to watch football in recent years.
Can they let the @ChicagoBears defense just play both ways?
O’Donnell a great punter. But as someone will point out, you have to score points, too.
Watching @ChicagoBears @Eagles  That was a brilliant punt.
@Karandikar18 I collected campaign buttons in grade school. Went to Dem HQ in Da Loop to get a bunch, and who should walk out of the back room--of course!--but Richard J. Daley. Shook my hand and asked, "Are your family good Democrats?" I replied, "Uh, I think so!" (My aunt was Iowa GOP)

@memoryagent I hardly shamed mental illness. I did not "shame" Louis, and do not figure that he is mentally ill. This being noted I like Lenny's, "If you live in NYC, yr Jewish, even if yr Catholic. If you live in Boise, yr goyishe even if yr Jewish."
@amitoben @NPR Isn’t that what I said?
@tryitout20 @NPR I'm sorry, but any time there's an audience, it's not just practice--it's performance. It's professional. It may not be where he winds up with the material, but it's fair to react to what it is now. To use a Broadway analogy, Boston critics review the show, too.
@AtheistLuvXmas @111Manco111 @jeffreypu @NPR Of course I've heard the term. I just find it a patronizing, imprecise cliche. Is that better? And I hardly nominated myself as "the premier voice in assessing comedy." I do have an opinion. So do we all. Mine just get a little more exposure.
@pesmerk Pes, I think that's a little naive these days--in part because of this very platform. It's a public venue. People paid money. I guarantee you he would have been happy to leak, "Saw him and he was great." Places in which you can make mistakes without attention are disappearing.

@CarlySharec @NPR I don't know about that, Carly. I agree about a comic's right to be bad and work out new material. But a stage is not a "safe place." People pay money. It's a public setting. Professionalism should apply.
@111Manco111 @jeffreypu @NPR I never said he was punching down, whatever that is. I don't believe I have ever made fun of the people you mention--I don't use the words you do, by the way.
@Hattori_Hanzo23 @NPR I pointedly said that I was not offended our outraged. I just didn't find it funny.
@LaDolceVitaWC @NPR What part of, "Great comics can offend and outrage people. But a comic who dares to be offensive, but isn't funny, is just a lout," and, "I don’t believe Louis CK should be censored, or publicly shamed into perpetual unemployment..." isn't clear to you?
@almostjay @BabbooWI @JackCarrWasHere @NPRWeekend I never said he is a bad person, just not a good comedian. So noted, I don't find someone who forces people to watch him pleasure himself is a good person, whatever his feeling about certain laws.
This week's essay on Louis CK. For those ready to pounce w/ Lenny Bruce comparisons, I pointedly say, "I don't believe Louis C.K. should be censored or publicly shamed into perpetual unemployment."  He is not nearly as mistreated, or talented, as Lenny. https://t.co/hSdKHZVvvI
@almostjay @BabbooWI @JackCarrWasHere @NPRWeekend Yes, I noted that. And I don't think it was funny. Lecturing me that I'm wrong won't make me laugh, either. I pointedly didn't say I was offended or outraged--comedy should do that sometimes. I just said I didn't find it funny.
@JackCarrWasHere @NPRWeekend Jack, I think you'll find I grew up in comedy. I specifically said, "I don't believe Louis C.K. should be censored or publicly shamed into perpetual unemployment," unlike what happened to Lenny Bruce.
@realdumbrunner Mark, my first line was, "I don't think Louis C.K. is funny." Everyone is their own self-appointed judge when it comes to taste, including of what's funny. It's an opinion. That is, indeed, how humor works. Telling someone that sure, something really is funny, doesn't.

@LynnSherr @WSJ Lynn, back when I was in the NYC bureau, there used to be a lot of Donald Trump jokes I can't repeat (let's just say the punchline was usually, "Sure. But what;s in it for me?"). He was a @PageSix figure, not a political force (or so I thought).

@mattseaton @WSJ -if you have the same ideas now you had a few years ago, it might only mean that you haven't been learning. (I find you tell the things you really think you've learned to your children.)
@mattseaton @WSJ Trump used to praise @HillaryClinton &amp; favored abortion rights and gay rights. Romney denounced him in 2016 campaign, but met w/ him to discuss job, ala Mattis. If you don't let pols, or ppl, flip-flop, they'll never be progress. I tell our daughters-

I am glad @POTUS visited troops, who sacrifice so much for us all. But other presidents managed that trip w/out complaining, "But if you would have see what we had to go through in the darkened plane with all window closed with no light anywhere..." https://t.co/qKOTbLeuTl

@MarkHarrisNYC @JanetMaslin @MaryPoppins @Bob_Mondello @lindaholmes I mentioned those three critics in my initial tweet because of my esteem and didn't want them to think my jape about critics being heartless included them, whatever their opinion about any film. I'd settle for "strange and interesting" for any piece of work.
@TerryTeachout1 @MarkHarrisNYC @MaryPoppins @Bob_Mondello @lindaholmes That's hilarious!
@MarkHarrisNYC @MaryPoppins @Bob_Mondello @lindaholmes My family brings along a duffle bag and stuffs me inside while they have dinner, until they see the shuddering stop. If someone asks our daughters, "Where is your father?" they say, "Big story at McMurdo Station. Won't be back until spring."
@MarkHarrisNYC @MaryPoppins @Bob_Mondello @lindaholmes There's a joke to be made somewhere in there, Mark. 	Say, did you hear about the critic who needed a heart transplant?	Punchline 1: Why?	(Works for journalists, too.)
@treygraham @Bob_Mondello @MarkHarrisNYC @lindaholmes Trey, I came perilously close to including your Twitter handle too! Just ran out of characters, alas...
@lindaholmes I know! I loved your review (though I might call it a slightly qualified rave).
@CaitlinPacific @MaryPoppins @Bob_Mondello @MarkHarrisNYC @lindaholmes Yes, I sure did. Alas, my own bad British accent may owe much to the fact that it began with me trying to imitate Dick Van Dyke's Bert. Yes, I know, I should have imitated Olivier's Henry V, but Bert was first. I tried 007 for a while, too, but it was unconvincing.
-And for all the (mostly affectionate) grief Dick Van Dyke has gotten for his British accent in the original, not a dry eye when he returns in this one, dancing. @Lin_Manuel, Emily Blunt, Angela Lansbury, &amp; so many more terrific. And the Big Ben scene!

@leftwardbound LB, the NYT story was more than 24 hrs after our program. And again father is quoted: "In the statement from his lawyers, Mr. Caal Cruz said he was grateful to the “many first responders” who tried to save his daughter’s life." He does not questions their actions. And you put-

@ChadAChavez No, the father has told the Guatemalan consul he has no complaints. An aunt, who was back home and far from the scene, has another opinion.
An investigation is underway. If it's not probing or fair, we'll report that. But let's not convict the father, or individual agents, or negligence leading to a little girl's death, until facts are known. Criticisms of policies are necessary and fair.

@moira_kb @NPR Yes it's a good report. And @politifact verified it was good, but the video old. And I hadn't heard such conduct has been alleged in this case. There is an investigation underway, and I hope that will be determined.
@kmize56 @NPR @PolitiFact And I fear you've never met one, reported on one, or done stories along the border. Listen to what the girl's father says, too. I think I raised the right questions without pre-judging any guilt. There will be an investigation.

@WomensHoopsBlog @NPR Helen, please read the whole essay, not just the header. And the water-dumping story, according to @PolitiFact, is true, but old. And I hadn't heard it alleged in this case: https://t.co/KovzFhFMkI
@PetiteJemmy @Mxhrad @Christi22657596 @NPR And you're right.

@dilworth_bill @FoxNews @CNN @NPR Actually, it's @AP story, and a good one. I hope the investigation of the Inspector General will determine all of that. But the relatives weren't there.

Latest report: Chris Christie didn't want to be @potus Chief of Staff because it would complicate a tour with his new book next January. That's a schedule conflict I don't have to worry about for any of my books.
Do you think Chris Christie maybe enjoys turning down @POTUS request to be Chief of Staff just a teensy little bit?

This is a consistent theme with Macron. He ran against Marine Le Pen's nationalist movement--France First, if you please--because he saw it as dangerous and poisonous, and sees the worst kind of nationalism blooming in the west again. @CNNPolitics https://t.co/Flbw9eVpbT

@SikesFair @POTUS The interview was 4 1/2 minutes. The general had frequent time cues. I’m sorry, but we had to get to other news, too.

@TonyCava @djrothkopf @NPR Tony, I think if you read a little further, you'll see Macron &amp; Merkel and Trudeau were at different cemetaries, not the one Trump was going to visit. Could he have taken the limo? I suppose. But who knows what we don't know about the decision?
@TonyCava @djrothkopf @NPR Tony, you may be on to something, but I believe the ceremony the president didn't go to was different from the others. @POTUS is being criticized plenty, and I'm sure our coverage will report that. I think at the moment our reporter was filing, she reported what she knew.
@TonyCava @djrothkopf @NPR His visit seems to be canceled because it involved a helicopter ride. General Kelly going by ground transport.
@TonyCava @djrothkopf @NPR Tony, I believe the specific ceremony was at a US military cemetery. The other ones you cite seem to be at different places.

@fureygirl The Dems lost those statewide races. @BetoORourke has become a national name and maybe president soon. But just not elected tonight.
@RobotWhatIsLove And was it a massive upset of Bill Clinton’s or Barack Obama’s agenda when they lost the House—and came back stronger than ever? You’re being partisan. Taking the House is an achievement. But not the ball game.
No blue wave. But blue lapping on the shore. But Republicans hold Senate. But Presidents Clinton and Obama popular and re-elected with House in hands of opposite party. Overall theme? Politics is local, seasonal, personal.
I think @BetoORourke can still be a national candidate in 2020. He’s become a national figure and raise more $$$ than anyone else.
Have networks stopped bringing victory and concession speeches from local candidates so their stable of analysts can get more time to analyze, speculate, and bloviate? I liked seeing that kind of election night portrait of the country, local faces going national.

Okay, another idea for people our daughters can dress like for Halloween: @NinaTotenberg and @NoelKing. Or @ailsachang and @lourdesgnavarro. Or @NPRKelly and @rachelnpr. Or @tamarakeithNPR and @nprAudie. Whaddya think?

I am one of those pathetic slobs of a father who enjoys Halloween even more than our daughters. I tried to persuade them to dress as Angela Merkel and @judyblume this year. But a cat and a princess again.

The @RedSox are being slightly pretentious about their talent now. They should have some regard for their hosts in LA. A one or two run margin should suffice.

Of course Dave should keep in Keyshawn right now. It’s true crunch time for LA. But it’s the bottom of Boston’s order, and why lift your best pitcher, even on an off night, for a reliever?

@DPonizil Yes. But cutting off Saudi oil to US wouldn’t hurt their economy much (or ours, for that matter), which doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. I gather weapons contracts might be more crucial to them.
@CaitlinPacific @joshgreenman Interesting idea, Caitlin, Do you think someone like @JeffBezos would be interested in that?
@DPonizil Dadla, the US imports only 9% of its oil from SA, even less from Russia. 40% is from Canada, 7% Mexico, so half is from neighboring democracies. 7% is from Venezuela, is a leftist party dictatorship. So I think the story is more complex. https://t.co/QtWtsAUWDU

@BigBrownEyesPDX @DollyParton The moon has gone behind the clouds to hide his face and cry...even—or especially—Sondheim would admire that line.
@whiskycast @DollyParton Those of us reporters in El Salvador who were put on the government's Enemies List used to sing that! "Mommas, don't let your babies grow up to be periodistas..."
@natalietran And years ago, in El Salvador, I taught some British reporters to sing, You're The Reason God Made Oklahoma. Great song. But to hear Brits go, "All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip / Wish that they could be like you...You're the reason God made Oklahoma," Oy...
@ElizabethCovino @DollyParton Ooooh, yes, Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue, indeed.
@natalietran @DollyParton You are sooo right. I'd choose Johnny's Folsom and the duet of If I Were A Carpenter. Btw, I used to do a (terrible) imitation of Johnny Cash singing Fiddler on the Roof. But when I've met @rosannecash, I haven't had the nerve to do it.
@JimTheD @DollyParton Yep--Merle sure should be on that list, though I'd probably choose The Bottle Let Me Down: "Tonight the bottle let me down	And let your memory come around	The one true friend I thought I'd found	Tonight the bottle let me down"
@DonGonyea Don, I should also include Detroit City:	"But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars	If only they could read between the lines..Oh, I want to go home..."
@mailnurse1995 @DollyParton You're right--the version with Hank and Hank Jr. is wonderful, and I usually don't like production gimmicks like that.
@TexBusiness @DollyParton Yep, you're right. And I'll include El Paso, too.
@sbassopb @DollyParton I just ran out of characters to include that, Steve. Of course you're right!
Our 15 yr old beginning to love country music, &amp; I'm trying to help. Which is the classic country song?	Hank's I'M SO LONESOME I COULD CRY.	Bobbie Gentry's ODE TO BILLIE JOE	Glenn's WICHITA LINEMAN	Patsy's WALKIN' AFTER MIDNIGHT	@DollyParton IN MY TENNESSEE MOUNTAIN HOME

@rgloveroz Naw. And yr fine piece doesn't make me regret that. Jewish father, Irish mother, who both appreciated "food diversity" of a great world city: Indian, Mexican, deli, Chinese, Thai, etc. X 100. My mother used to say the Irish came to Chicago because they heard about enchilladas.

@eugeneprojectil @sybann @SenatorCollins Eugene, far fewer people when Constitution was written &amp; they had to reassure DE &amp; RI they wouldn't always be overwhelmed by VA &amp; NY, etc. Only a constitutional amendment could change it, ratified by 2/3rds of the states, who won't vote give themselves less power. So, it just is.
I've just taken a moment's respite from breaking news to look at shots of my wife, daughters, and our dog. Gives me strength.
I am pretty sure how I think @SenatorCollins is going to vote, but she's sure making people hang on every word.

Something to ponder tonight: several politicians, notably @JeffFlake and @ChrisCoons, changed their minds in public today to foster a compromise that will open a process to help the country. Hard for pols to do that. Riles base and donors. But good for them.
@KBAndersen Yes but imagine another week of publicity, more stories, pressures. Timing, timing.
@KBAndersen But Kurt, isn't it a little hard to say, "They should wait for an FBI investigation! What's their rush? What's their fear?"--then complain when they delay for that investigation?
@opinion_joe @susanorlean I consider it a duty (and often a pleasure) to read the book before we interview an author. So noted, careful reading doesn't always guarantee a good interview. I have grown to respect the unapologetic Larry King question, "So, what's in this book?"

I'm sorry. I believe in God. But I do not believe it's legitimate question to ask people if they believe to somehow attest to their integrity or character. I think it's also against the spirit of the constitution.
I think that's a pretty telling exchange. It's hard to criticize @SenFeinstein for not sharing Dr. Ford's letter, then essentially criticize her staff for leaking contents to the press.

Is questioning Kavanaugh about barfing and farting helping anyone make their case?

Unless this prosecutor has proof that Dr. Ford's legal bills are being paid by organized crime figures, I wonder what this line of questioning is supposed to reveal.
Trying to discredit Dr. Ford because she has overcome anxieties to fly for work and vacations is not fair or smart (I say this as someone with occasional claustrophobia). If you want to do what's important, you take a breath and go ahead and fly. It just confirms her courage.

@themelaniedione I've been to Yale a few times for various reasons, and no, I was not aware of all the binge drinking there, which, in NY'er account, included everyone at that party, women and men. It has all the earmarks of problem drinking. Being drunk is no excuse for sexual assault anyway.
@troy_tastic Binge drinking at Yale was my question, Michelle, not the sexual violence, of which I was sadly aware, and now growing more so. Drinking is no excuse for sexual assault. I am also troubled that in NY'er story, every witness there, women and men, say they were drunk.
@curledANDqueued @Yale Annik, I asked about binge-drinking. In NY'er, Yale women who were at that party say they were drunk, too. I don't question history of harassment at colleges. Alas, I know about that. It was just a revelation to me to read about so much alcoholism--that's the word--at Yale.

@getawaygalsd @MoRocca Mo, respectable? Well, talented...Barrymore was a great actor. So is Dylan Baker. Alan Tate a great poet. Mark Shriver is a wonderful activist for mentally-challenged people. David Chang a great chef. And Paul Haaga...oh, have I run out of space?
@constancelee121 Thank you sooo much, Connie! I knew my wife has always been beautiful, but didn't know she could drive from such an early age.
They are superficially charming and profoundly sad. Amanda bonks Elyot over the head, he slaps her across the face. It's a play about people who cannot love, themselves or others. Someone who lifts that line from the play doesn't know what it's about. Just read the Cliff's Notes.
I hold no brief for Kavanaugh or Judge, but do for Noel Coward. Women and gongs line is from his 1930 play, Private Lives. Elyot and Amanda, former spouses, are selfish, loveless, and malicious. Anyone who quotes that line should know it's uttered to reveal Elyot's villainy-
Stuff you find out doing research on other stuff: John Barrymore, Dylan Baker, @MoRocca, Allen Tate, Douglas Kennedy, Mark Shriver, Chris Kennedy, David Chang, and Paul Haaga (former head of NPR) are also Georgetown Prep grads.
@RSBUNKER @NPR @nprpolitics I think you’re drawing the wrong conclusion. The people who handle funding credits are totally separate from editorial. They don’t tell us what language to use and vice versa.

@AmyBlankenship I did say "should be," not is.
It is possible for a senator to believe, or at least have no reason to doubt Kavanaugh, for vote against his nomination to the Supreme Court. But it should be impossible for any senator who believes Christine Blasey to vote to confirm him.
Kavanaugh argued old charges of sexual assault against Bill Clinton were relevant during Starr investigation. Hard for GOP to say old charges against Kavanaugh aren't pertinent now. But some Dems might regret excuses they made for Clinton's past coercive behavior with women.
3/5 Kavanaugh says, so far, he didn't commit that crime or any other that night or any other. He does not say he was young, drunk, stupid, or can't remember--none of which excuses the crime of sexual assault in any case.
2/ 5 Christine Blasey Ford's courage to come forward should be saluted. It is also necessary. A court nomination, or personal reputation, shouldn't be undone by an anonymous charge. Stakes are too high. Salem to McCarthyism, anonymous charges have an ugly history.
1 of 5 Some points about Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh before they both testify under oath. Please read all points before telling me how wrong I am.

@tannan07 The ump said he was offended by being called a thief. Perhaps. But so? It’s sports. He sounded too eager to make it seem like a personal attack against him, rather than a competitive athlete venting steam.
@snowflakeyoga St. Paul and the Broken Bones is the group.
@jeanne09011 She has threatened umpires to stuff the ball down their throats, etc. And that's not distinguished. But it's sports. Hyperbole is the language. The umpires, who are not competing for championships, should keep their heads &amp; their cool and let players play.

@Bender3352 Mr. Landman, I don't believe you are typical of @Cardinals fans, who I've never known to hurl public expletives, even at @Cubs and their fans. I simply did not say "only" multi-ethnic families are American. The expletive is unwarranted by anything I said.

@rainekasey @MangaFox Iola, you can have a right to view. But experience, including being a parent, can deepen &amp; humanize our views beyond ideology. Our family is inter-ethnic to begin with. I think some "progressives" do not see the "blood &amp; soil" in their int'l adoption views.
@JohnBaldoni John, I agree. But I think a better phrase for "admirable but flawed" may be "human."
I'm a little amused and irked by commentators who refer to John McCain as "admirable but flawed." Speaking for myself, I'm only flawed. The only human beings who aren't flawed are on Twitter. But they are hard to take.
@rainekasey @MangaFox Iola, I'm going to guess yr not a parent, and see this only polemically. History should be noted, but not dictate. Better for real live children who've been abandoned to be adopted by loving parents of any "blood or soil" than left in orphanages. It's the one life they'll have.

He seemed as tickled to hear that as he was to have a theater named for him--and that was the delight he had in people.
2/2 and this opens, And the Play Goes On, after Neil’s wife, Joan, died. Chapter ends with him hearing the laughter of his daughters. Wrenching and beautiful. https://t.co/ilom0H9e7Z
Yes, re-watch THE ODD COUPLE film tonight. But order the play from @SamuelFrenchNYC. From the instant you read, "I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches. It's either very new cheese or very old meat," you know Neil Simon's special talent for rhythm and wit.
John McCain and Neil Simon in one weekend. The world looks a little dimmer right now.
"If no one ever took risks, Michaelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor."	Neil Simon, RIP, and thanks for a million laughs, and quite a few good cries, too.

@RonCohenUS17 Mr. Cohen, the author says one of her characters, "sees U.S. citizenship as the gold standard — that having the passport means freedom to travel, it means potential opportunities in the future. It symbolizes everything that he wants for his child." Seems to me she knows our luck.

The magic of the medium: my mistake of thinking Roger Williams founded Delaware (it was, of course, RHODE ISLAND), being removed. Listeners in other time zones will not hear it. They will not know how profoundly stupid I am, although I suspect I'll reveal that in other ways, too.
@byagoda Actually, I was thinking of the pianist. I certainly am now! I don't like it when people confuse Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana, or think they're somehow the same state, and I'm appalled to have done the same with Delaware and Rhode Island.

@mccormick_ted @domers71 Ted, the My bad, and I'm wrong was followed in the next phrase by protestations that being wrong about that story didn't matter, blaming the error on others, then accusations of public shaming, and then raising various isms.
@mccormick_ted Oh piffle. The professor resorted to the hazy, “My bad,” rather than , “I’m wrong.” And I make s point of it because too many people on this platform tell journalists, “You’re not telling the true story,” then tell a wrong story. A teacher should be responsible.
@jenfronc Of course! A historian--or anyone--shouldn't tweet something that's demonstrably flat out wrong. Nothing to do with ageism, sexism, or any ism, except journalism. A fact like this is easily discovered. Please don't try to blame some ism, when it's only your own mistake.
@jenfronc @POTUS Trial was 19 years ago. Yes, a historian who tweets a false claim should know the trial record and Abner Louima's admission that me made up the story. Would you tell a student that saying it "was discussed in my circles" is proof enough?
I had to share something we just found. The elegant French model in this ad from the 70’s is my MIL. And the adorable beauty in the driver’s seat: my wife. She’s grown up to be brilliant, hilarious, and elegant herself.  But still adorable. https://t.co/imXwB7w2Ni
@jenfronc @POTUS Jennifer, I don't believe I've ever interviewed Mark Krikorian. At least I see no immediate link to it, thoughI wouldn't rule it out (I've interviewed a lot of people). And yes, this is a public forum. You should be as responsible as any public figure--because you are.
@jenfronc @POTUS Jennifer, with respect, I can only answer for what I said (his 9-11 leadership), rather than what contributes to your reaction. And if I'd said something demonstrably untrue in a public forum about an important issue, I hope I'd say, "I'm wrong," not the vague, "My bad."
@jenfronc @POTUS Jennifer, my initial tweet was clearly about 9-11 leadership. And I suspect you'd upbraid me and others for saying, "My bad," about a well-known factual error instead of, "I was wrong."

@ClydeHaberman @LynnSherr @POTUS Thank you, Clyde--I had to look that up: someone who makes arguments that are clever, but false. I think 9-11 was so staggering, it knocked the nonsense out of people for at least a few weeks. We were reminded of what counts in life. IMHO, as they say.
A skilled workman just came up to me and said, "I want to compliment you on your children. They are so polite, well-mannered, and kind. I run into a lot of kids who ignore me. Yours are great." I'm tearing up. And up there, so are their grandmothers, who are responsible.

@SMByersOly @whatscottreads @NPR @KUOW @NPRWeekend Robert is my mistake. I'm sorry--Steven. i was probably looking at another name in the thread. A man shouldn't tweet when the @cubs are behind by 8 runs.
@HavicanWatson @SMByersOly @NPR @KUOW @NPRWeekend Ellen I didn't write the headline. But I think news organizations are reluctant these days to name alleged perps of mass shootings, attacks, etc, more than necessary as studies show the publicity can encourage others.

@whatscottreads @SMByersOly @NPR @KUOW @NPRWeekend I’m not sure I would have written that headline. But until someone is tried and convicted by judge or jury, journalists don’t convict them, or assume motive. I know it can seem preposterous at times. But innocent people have also been maligned by press and public without trial.
@SMByersOly @NPR @KUOW @NPRWeekend My gosh Robert what about that article possibly justifies such repellent language? You don’t even specify—just curse. Do you think you deserve a civil reply? Do you think you convince anyone with this display?
@tylerfugazzie I wrote that one. They took it from my script, and it was clearly inspired by the famous Variety STICKS NIX HICKS PIX. But our editors write great headlines when they have to, which is usually.

@Viper19103 @grannybrigade We certainly did mention those charges.
@DavidDiSab David, I think the point--which most seemed to understand--is that charges in Forbes against Wilbur Ross can't be dismissed as liberal politics.
@grannybrigade @SMDamnH We asked blunt questions, disputed the guest, and pointed out facts. Did our guest spin questions his way and try to duck? of course. That's the business. We dealt with it. We interview people with all views. Journalism.
Ahead: a refugee camp for Rohyinga in Bangledesh; renaming some Amsterdam streets; a postcard from an old Berlin airfield with a bitter history; and the emerging marvel of horizontal gene transfer.
Ahead: all these ethics questions in the Trump administration! The sound of a well-struck golf ball. And, sports!

Ahead: @davidfolkenflik on allegations of sexual misconduct by @CBS CEO Les Moonves and @60Minutes exec; Dr. Atomic finally performed for New Mexicans; and a fine new novel taken from Colombia during the time of kidnappings and drug wars, FRUIT OF THE DRUNKEN TREE.
This week's essay on how someone can get demonized before the truth has a chance to put on shoes: https://t.co/yi61MnV5Ro
Ahead: what's in the strong economic numbers this week; a rancher on why he feels changes are needed to Endangered Species Act (wolves eat sheep, after all); and classes in happiness in India's schools.
@susieach @NPRWeekend Nice to be with you, Susie! We have a good show for you today--no, no, really!
We're on the air! Ahead: @NPRrelving on Mueller, Russia, economy, etc.; @WRashbaum on who is Michael Cohen?; and the age of instant villainy, and the truth catching up.

In studio, caffeinated (but with tea, because of my throat problems--not the same at all!), and ready to leap upon the news like Michael Cohen on an audio recording app.

My @Uber driver says, “Thanks for fighting the good fight, Mr. Simon.” I say, well, a free press is being attacked, but we’ll be fine. He says, “I mean for the @Cubs .” Sorry for you he won’t host our show today!

Putin visit to the United States will be postponed. Won't happen this year. But I already ordered the cocktail napkins!
@simon_schama @onthemedia Point is: no one fills Murrow's space now. Media too divided into niches.
@simon_schama @onthemedia -social media would flay him as warmonger; his brave McC broadcasts came 4 years after GOP senators, i.e. Margaret Chase Smith, Wayne Morse, etc., denounced McCarthy; Elmer Davis--who inspired Murrow--took on McC in 1951; and finally--CBS replaced Murrow within just a few years.
@simon_schama @onthemedia Ian, because Murrow is a personal hero of mine, I think it's good to recall a few facts about his career &amp; impact: fewer ppl had TV's in those days, just 3 nets audience much smaller &amp; relatively "elite"; Murrow had matchless moral stature as voice of the London Blitz; today, -

@NPRmelissablock Uh, oh, don't think I could. I can't even tie my own shoelaces. Maybe our dog could write haiku for generous donors? But she'd need to be inspired.
@LyfeOfKarma @newscomauHQ Just last week he was lauded for upbraiding the French ambassador to the US for saying the players on France's World Cup team were French, not African. The ambassador explained he meant they were no less French for being of African ancestry, but @Trevornoah cut him no slack.
Not sure what it says that security experts in Julia's article think her @Uber driver could be a clever Russian operative--or simply "some NPR-addicted cab drivers..." https://t.co/Xk46iwCj4D
Alas, what's happened to the Daily News just confirms that too many journalism enterprises are about clicks, not real coverage. May I say--more important than ever to support yr local NPR station? https://t.co/8IML1zimtR
@ILPollster @newscomauHQ No, not excusing it. Just noting that last week he was lionized for what he said about the African ancestry of French World Cup team. This week we learn he's uttered racial comments, too (and anti-Semitic before that).
The "joke" he makes her is repellent and cruel. There have also been some tweets about Jews, before he came to US. But bottom line: in these times, it's difficult for anyone to live a life without falls from grace. https://t.co/5YeNhUFqEJ via @newscomauHQ
Given all we've learned in 2018, I'm glad we looked at RT last December https://t.co/5zCaIBj4nP On the show last last week, note no mention of Putin, summit, indictments of Russians, etc.    	https://t.co/I0ncTFZbh6

@alisonstewart Congratulations, Alison!!!
@AnGaeilgeoir Alas, we did the interview a few hours before that was reported. But we decided to air the interview for it’s own value anyway. Would have been a fair question. But short answer is campaign pros on all sides have contracts around the world on all sides.
@AnGaeilgeoir Sanders voted for the act in 2015. He joined many Dems in voting against 2012 version, which Obama initially opposed. But his latest vote was for the act. So that would have been an ill-premised, silly question.
Our dog Daisy departs from haiku to write: 	NEVER, EVER FORGET TO BRING POOP BAGS ON OUR WALKS OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.

@SBfut3 @SenSanders @POTUS @HillaryClinton -because his name is still near the top of Dem presidential contenders for 2020. HRC's is not. It's legit to ask him for comment on what's going on now and what he would do. And we were tough on him. esp. cutting military budget now.
@SBfut3 @SenSanders @POTUS @HillaryClinton I think you mean Tad Devine. Didn't ask because the story hadn't broken when we interviewed Sanders. Tad Devine has had lots of clients overseas, &amp; apparently one in Ukraine linked with Manafort. Wish I'd known, but I'll bet Sanders would have said same. We interviewed him-
Tonight's @npratc and @NPRMichel will dig even deeper into the week on Russia, Trump, Putin, would and wouldn't, including a Trump biographer on what seems to be the president's special affinity for Putin's Russia. I know I'll be listening!

Now--sports!
Ahead: @SenSanders on: whatever his differences with @POTUS has he had the non-interventionist foreign policy he wants?
@comma_queen He's popular and could be the next Democratic nominee. That's why. No one thought much to interview Trump on foreign policy either, and look where he is.
Ahead: Maria Butina's attorney joins us in our studios; and what kind of recording does Michael Cohen have?
Ahead: a Republican county chairman who resigned this week after seeing @POTUS &amp; Putin in Helsinki; an attempt in IL to reduce the number of women in prison; and a screen treatment of FAR FROM THE TREE.
