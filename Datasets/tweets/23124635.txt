In the weeks ahead, it is critical that Democrats stay true to their promise of working with Republicans and @POTUS on solutions for border security. I believe we can find a compromise that both sides agree on and which reflects the views of the American people.

I am relieved that agreement has been reached to reopen the government and pay the hundreds of thousands of federal workers suffering as a result. Their commitment despite this hardship has been tremendous.

Anyone who voted to shut down the government voted against CHIP funding, funding our military and the best interests of the American taxpayer. This is shameful and irresponsible. #SchumerShutdown
Shutting down the government is never a good idea. Today, on the House Floor, I urged Congress to vote on the continuing resolution that will keep the gov't open. It's the right thing to do b/c shutting down the gov't is costly &amp; irresponsible governing. https://t.co/9M4MkAx9MV

Today marks 18 years since the OKC bombing. We will never forget the images of that fateful day that shook families and communities forever.
In 1900, the tax rate was 5.9%. Today, the tax burden is $4.22 trillion or 29.4% of total income.
Today is Tax Freedom Day. It takes 108 days for total American income to cover the total tax bill of $4.22 trillion.
Despite damage, I am grateful to hear that there are no serious injuries reported in southwest OK after a long night of severe weather.
My thoughts and prayers are with Boston today and all the victims affected by yesterday's horrific marathon bombing.

On sequester, President Obama has no specific proposal beyond his usual all-purpose, two-part plan: Blame Republicans and raise taxes.
Under current law, sequestration is going to happen.Conservatives will work with the president to modify the cuts but not to prevent them
