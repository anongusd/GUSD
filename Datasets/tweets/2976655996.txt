Problem with using links along: Link rot.		Why citations are seen as 'extraneous': Authors lazily write their works without strategic attention to proper citation.

@nils_gilman I want to! Working on some kind of article at the moment.		I thought Andersen's 'Fantasyland' was going to the text that did it, but it was a lot of rambling + no source citations. Not a great '500y' history.
So many people writing about all these issues, but have yet to come across an article or book that tries to grapple with all of it...		@nils_gilman?
And now, cyber security experts like Susan Landau (via @lawfareblog) have pointed out that the misinformation campaign doesn‚Äôt fit within the definition of ‚Äúcybersecurity.‚Äù Exploiters saw a society growing apart and resisting ‚Äòfacts‚Äô and swooped in
We tend to think of natl security interests/threats as tangible, the last election showed that the Russian misinformation campaign was a perfect exploitation of our self-created vulnerability. Foreign powers didn‚Äôt have to hack voting systems, but they did ‚Äòhack‚Äô our values.
If the freedoms of this country are the core of our national interests (ie national security), it‚Äôs ironic then that the hyper-use of them has created a vulnerability in national security.
And the foundation of these issues goes back to American values (eg, believe in whatever you want). Then the intellectual development of human rights and neoliberalism in the 70s turned that into hyper-freedom for both ends of the political spectrum.
It‚Äôs gotta be realized that celebrating plutocratic thought-leaders over serious intellectuals, the public‚Äôs active resistance against expertise, the rise of (verifiable) misinformation and predatory pseudo-academic journals, and hyper political polarization ‚â† coincidence

@nils_gilman You're right. My argument can easily be dismissed by the Ferguson example (i.e., focus on the brand/nice website, but having bad writing).
@nils_gilman In other words, public intellectuals need to learn the language of 'branding' (eg, good websites) if they want to challenge thought leaders.

Watching Senate foreign relations cmte's #TillersonConfirmation for state sec. Already one disruption. I wonder how many more...
Just finished 'Econ. Rules' by @rodrikdani. Good read! My views on today's state of the econ. discipline have changed quite a bit.
I'm really surprised my local library (Compton, CA) had scholarly books on nat'l sec. and int'l pol. economy.

Nice strategy by Clinton for saying Trump dared criticize the Gipper. Seems like she's trying to scoop up some Reagan folks. #debatenight
Told ya... Trump thinks we can have 6% GDP growth rate under his (potential) 8 years. #debatenight
Thorough vs. Extreme vetting. Sounds like different kind of chicken wing levels. #debatenight
Seems like Trump thinks the U.S. can be at 7+% GDP growth... Okay... #debatenight
Crap, I thought the debate was going to start at 7PST... I guess jumping in 40 min. late is okay... #debatenight Looks like a re-run though.

Trump: "I know nothing about Russia."	We could have done without the "about Russia" part. #debates
Trump, how do you solve the issue of Islamophobia? "Well, you have to say the phrase 'radical Islamic terror.'" #debate
Trump's tantrum is gold. "1 on 3" comment, then turns around like an angry child. #debate

@ckoettl Actually just finished watching it. Honestly, not much that's worth sharing so far. Mostly skepticism on last year's peace deal.
Great seeing @jokmadut of @SuddInstitute (+ @hrcberkeley practitioners' network) at (last week's) foreign relations hearing on #SouthSudan
