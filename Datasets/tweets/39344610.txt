#SFGiants are 1st team to win 3 #WorldSeries in 5 years since Yankees won 4 from 1996-2000. Only other NL team: STL in 1942, '44 &amp; '46.
This is Giants 8th #WorldSeries title &amp; 3rd in 5 years. 1905, 1921, 1922, 1933, 1954, 2010, 2012. And 2014.
Congratulations to the #Royals on an amazing run.

This is the 1st #WorldSeries #Game7 to be a one-run game through 6 innings since 2001.

Ventura is 1st P in #Royals #Postseason history to earn win w/ at least 7.0 scoreless innings &amp; no more than 3 hits allowed.
Tonight's 10-0 score was the largest #WorldSeries shutout since... the 1985 #Royals won Game 7 in 1985 11-0.
Ventura is 7th rookie P in #WorldSeries history to win an elimination game, 1st since John Lackey for 2002 Angels.
The last road team to win a #WorldSeries Game 7 was the 1979 Pirates in Baltimore.
While home teams are 18-18 in decisive #WorldSeries games, they have won the past 9 since 1982.
In previous 36 times #WorldSeries has gone the distance, the home team is 18-18 in the decisive game.
There will be a #WorldSeries #Game7 for just the 6th time in the past 26 WS (since 1988).
2nd time in #WorldSeries history a team‚Äôs entire lineup recorded at least 1 hit by end of 3rd inning (ARZ ‚Äì 2001, G6).
4th time in #Royals #Postseason history 9 players have hits, joining Game 6 of 85 #WorldSeries, Game 2 of 78 ALCS &amp; this year‚Äôs #WildCard.
The #Royals seven 2nd inning runs also most ANY team has scored in a #WorldSeries inning since #SFGiants scored 7 in 8th in 2010 Game 2.
The #Royals seven 2nd inning runs are the most they've ever scored in a #WorldSeries inning (scored 6 in 5th inning of 1985 Game 7).
The #Royals are 6-0 this #Postseason when scoring first &amp; 63-21 (.750) during the regular season when doing so. #WorldSeries
The #Royals have taken a 1-0 lead in #Game6 of the #WorldSeries. Still no outs w/ 2 runners on in 2nd inning. @MLBONFOX
