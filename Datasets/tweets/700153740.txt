From @Don_WVPress ... In referencing legislation to force silence, I wasn't talking about current law, bills or the LGBTQ question. I was cautioning against future reaction to these comments and a call for restrictions on free speech. This was not the point some expected. ... https://t.co/qgvIeF3e58
From @Don_WVPress ... Legislators and columnists will address the need for protections and the Delegate's comments. My point: Letting people talk - while often painful - gives us insight. Legislative leaders, voters, political opponents now know what the Delegate believes. ... https://t.co/SeA32PuNI2
From @Don_WVPress ... The point of the column is ‚Äî on this topic and all others ‚Äî as a society, we should address the belief, not just silent the message. The Delegate speaking out informed the public of his position. He could have remained silent and voted his belief. ... https://t.co/r6ZO6vckqq
