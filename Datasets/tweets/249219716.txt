Congress needs to reauthorize #ExIm immediately to avoid more job loss &amp; help U.S. workers compete in a global economy #ExIm4Jobs
An overwhelming majority of the House &amp; Senate supports my #ExIm reform bill. Congress shouldn't take steps backwards. #ExIm4Jobs
Opponents are trying to block this critical tool for job creators by offering amendments to slow or stall #ExIm reauthorization #ExIm4Jobs
This week, the House is debating a multi-year highway bill that includes my bill to reform &amp; reauthorize the #ExIm Bank #ExIm4Jobs
After months of congressional inaction putting thousands of U.S. #jobs in jeopardy, this vote was a step in the right direction #ExIm4Jobs
My #ExIm bill also includes the strongest reforms to the Bank since President Ronald Reagan's overhaul in 1980 #ExIm4Jobs
My bill to reform &amp; reauthorize #ExIm will help thousands of hardworking Americans who rely on the Bank to compete #ExIm4Jobs
Last week, I was proud the House - including a majority of #Republicans - fought for #jobs &amp; passed my #ExIm reform bill #ExIm4Jobs

W/out the #ExImBank thousands of #jobs will be put in jeopardy and local economies will pay the price. We must get this done now. #ExIm4Jobs
The longer Congress takes to reform &amp; reauthorize the #ExImBank, the more jobs we willingly surrender to our global competitors. #ExIm4Jobs
Reforms in my bill will increase transparency while ensuring the Bank remains a job promotion machine that expands opportunity #ExIm4Jobs
My #ExIm bill makes some of the strongest reforms to the Bank since President Reagan’s overhaul in the 1980's
The #ExImBank is something that actually returns money to the U.S. Treasury each year – netting a profit for #American #taxpayers #ExIm4jobs
#ExImBank ensures our businesses can compete on a level playing field w/ other nations by helping companies size pro-growth opportunities
With 95% of the world’s consumers living overseas, exports are crucial to helping businesses seize pro-growth opportunities. #ExIm4jobs
When #ExIm gives small businesses the resources to break into global markets, their employees, suppliers &amp; communities win &amp; prosper at home
In FY2014, nearly 90% of #ExImBank transactions directly supported small businesses, our nation’s best job creators #ExIm4jobs
The #ExmBank is a #job creator – supporting over 1 thousand jobs in #TN08 &amp; over 8,300 jobs across our great state #ExIm4jobs
Thousands of #jobs are on the line, it’s urgent we get #ExImBank reformed and reauthorized for the #American people #ExIm4Jobs
Discharging #ExIm reform bill demands regular order in the House &amp; stands up to Washington’s broken system that’s killing #jobs #ExIm4Jobs

This is especially true since our nation’s small businesses are the backbone of job creation in America. #hr2629 #jobs #smallbiz
Providing an update to these exemptions for a law that went into effect more than a decade ago just makes good sense. #hr2629 #jobs
Going public provides opportunities for companies to raise needed capital in order to expand, reinvest, and create jobs. #ipo #jobs #hr2629
But more can be done  to improve the  process of going public for small companies, which is why we are debating #HR2629 today.
That's close to the average per year from 2001-2010. #ipo #financialservices 	#jobs
There's been a 70% increase in IPOs in 2014 already, w/ over 100 companies filing to go public in just the first few months of 2014. #jobs
Getting ready to speak on behalf of my colleague @RepFitzpatrick's bill #HR2629 in the House @FinancialCmte.
There's something wrong in america when we're going after small businesses, making it harder for them to grow. #financialcmte
Right now in the House @FinancialCmte we're discussing amendments to @GOPWhip's bill #HR4697, Small-Cap Access to Capital Act.
Moment of levity in the House @FinancialCmte when everyone's phones sound with a flash flood warning. http://t.co/3pD64UFoqk
Small-Cap Access to Capital Act will help smaller companies compete for capital &amp; allow them innovate, grow, &amp; create #jobs. #hr4697
Companies need to have the ability to act quickly to take advantage of opportunities when market conditions are favorable. #hr4697
Best thing our govt can do for our economy is create an environment where new ideas &amp; start-up co's have a chance to grow &amp;succeed	 #hr4697

The time 2 act is now. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 2 join me in supporting affordable housing for rural America #hr1779
Simply put the @CFPB's new rules have caused a reduction of credit to low &amp; moderate borrowers w/ low credit when buying manufactured homes
The US has put forth a lot of effort to help more Americans own a home but new rules affecting manufactured housing are moving us backward.
Why? Bc in rural areas manufactured housing is often the only option available for affordable housing. #hr1779
It also adjusts points and fees triggers for HOEPA loans so access to credit is not cut off to low and moderate income borrowers.
My bill simply clarifies the definition of loan originator so manufactured home retailers are able to provide assistance to home buyers.
Just introduced my Manufactured Housing bill to the House @FinancialCmte for markup. #congress #tn08 #fiservices

Americans deserve more than the rising premiums &amp; outrageous deductibles #Obamacare brought on. #SOTU
LET'S BE HONEST: #Obamacare has been far more of a headache for Americans than a helping hand  #SOTU
From major corporations to small businesses, @barackobama’s IRS-controlled health care system has already wreaked havoc over America #SOTU
REALITY CHECK: Americans are tired of wading through an unaffordable IRS-controlled health care system. #Obamacare #SOTU
Americans deserve a President that respects the role Congress plays in our THREE branch Democracy! #SOTU
Mr. President, Americans don't need a pen and a phone, we need a job and a paycheck #SOTU http://t.co/qClnYvQgCF

Tax day reminds us  it is time to cut government spending! http://bit.ly/dIFA1w #tcot #TN08

Yesterday I voted to repeal wasteful Obamacare spending. http://bit.ly/fW6D14
Disappointed with Pres. Obama’s proposal to increase taxes on hardworking Americans.  We need common sense tax reform – no hikes.
