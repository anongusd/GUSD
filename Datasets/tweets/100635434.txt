@Jeffrey_Marty @RepStevenSmith he's gay
@ColleenHuberNMD @LaLaRueFrench75 yeah but it's 2019 now
Alex Jones is Bill Hicks. Or, He keeps messing up and letting his accent show, through sound.
@CREWcrew why does he take such shitty photos
If the cell towers are used for anything that isn't "prescribed" I want my payday #alexjones
Alex Jones makes sense. #what
@LueYee ok
@RabbiShmuley why?
@bowater2014 @HouseCracka @Robbin_Young His arm was already broken for no reason. It'll happen soon, if crime exists at all.
what up https://t.co/GXXHZTDAaE
@KamalaHarris guns keep america, america. You're just referencing a word that describes something. Words can change, and of course, people can still "addon" to their weapons.		You're not protecting anyone, but a Republican with a gun is and will.
@TheDemCoalition it's not racist if it's funny #america
@StefanMolyneux Thought that too. I'm torn between Cohen; a retarded kid of a friend of Trump's, to, he's playing a role in Trump's master plan.
@RepStevenSmith that one with the retarded guy or usual suspects, the one with the perve.
@RealDeanCain your kids are getting old!
@repedvillegas @GayPatriot da fuck is that
@DonaldJTrumpJr @RodStryker @realDonaldTrump so ask Barron to ask him (Trump Sr.) to end the war (on paper its a war).
@BlissTabitha where is it written in keep and bear arms?
@GitRDoneLarry Only if you broke someones arm while arm wrestling.
@tariqnasheed What's the rule for reparations?
@tribelaw @AOC Of course She hasn't done shit with her life except some how get elected. What has she done thus far after being elected? Cause NY a bunch of lost opportunities. This lady is going to destroy the East Coast.		But She sure is meme gold.
@jordanbpeterson yeah, people that stand at their desks are just creepy.
RT @LaLaRueFrench75: Today’s ACIP MEETING was a full on s**t show, until the moms &amp; dads of vaccine disabled children took to the mic &amp; set…
@jojoh888 He's talking about sex.
@TheEconomist Seriously, I can't get past the "wetter" part.
@TheEconomist Is "wetter" a thing?
@DeniseCiccotto @SarahPalinUSA His retirement benefits pre-date any punishment. I agree, punish. But don't steal from the guy. He's going to live the rest of his life knowing what He did. You think that's going to be easy? If He doesn't suicide himself the next few years, I'd be surprised.
Weak Republicans are to blame as well.
The #CohenHearing hearing should have been pushed until after Trump was done with NK.
@michaelshermer @joerogan Probably true. Clinton dropped bombs and killed a bunch of people to get the media stop talking about where his penis was.
Better than the #CohenHearing https://t.co/VNcWZ4zaUt
@SarahPalinUSA seems a little much. you can't bring the kids back. don't let him work in that business again. punish people. But retirement benefits is a little cruel.
@CBSEveningNews That dude looks fucking clueless. We sure this isn't a stunt by Trump to get his friend's retarded son some publicity?
@DennisDMZ need someone that is more of a pussy though
@DailyCaller okay
@Brian_Alford @mitchellvii i help where and when i can.
@LouMcGopher @benpershing like cookies n creme
@WindsorMann That's not it at all.
@DonaldJTrumpJr wait, you still have the poor judgement beard?
@benpershing Only if you're not from Earth. A country wanting to kill the US vs. countries that will be slapped around once Trump is back at home. Pretty sure the Trump/Un meeting is more important for Earth.
Kim Jong Un probably has the biggest boner of his career today (or yesterday?). Meanwhile, the news hasn't specified whether or not Mr. Trump &amp; Un spending the night together resulted in a baby.
@lachlan um 100s of thousands? come on.
@debbiegreene63 @BBCAfrica @LivRancourt nah you should still get it sista
@HouseCracka that's weird, could have sworn something was different.
Doug Jones is a tool. You let that ISIS lady back into the US, then she should be arrested for treason. By joining the enemy, you are committing treason.		Pretty sure it's more humane to just leave that lady outside the US so she doesn't have to face the death penalty.
@CalFreedomMom @SandraTXAS He's not going there.
@Brian_Alford @mitchellvii how the fuck do you tweet 17k times and not break 100 in followers? nobody likes your shit brother.
@allinwithchris still better ratings than you my friend.
RT @MattWalshBlog: So @AOC wants to tell us what to eat, how to travel, how much money we can make, what sort of home to live in, and wheth…
@RobProvince is he kenny g's kid?
@mitchellvii Literally Trump was probably so used to cheek kissing that he made the mistake. Happens a lot around hispanic people too.
@mitchellvii It was probably this https://t.co/bPVz6UqxOD @vp
Also, I bet this dude is having a fun day @alvajohnson (Alva Johnson)
Well shit. If Alva Johnson is suing, @VP (Mike Pence) should sue because Trump tried to kiss him on national TV. I saw it, you can't deny it Mikey. 		If anything, Trump did it on accident because he was cheek kissing that whole day.
@PasquinoMarifio @OliviaMesser yeah I wouldn't understand it.
@johncardillo She's obviously trolling Ms. Warren. I say Ms. because her husband only comes over when there's a camera.
Furthermore, the Democrats want a weak president like W. Bush. Hence why Hair Reid loves the guy. Trump does what Trump thinks is best, and a lot of times, that's good for the US.
Harry Reid lied to America about Romney. He's also a retired tool, that used to work for the Vegas mob.
Give up all your shit, buy a car with no balls; But don't worry, Bernie flies in a private jet. https://t.co/k9QGwfYatp #MAGA
@BuzzSumo @MariSmith considering FB inflated their numbers, why would you focus on FB (they could be gone by year's end).
@1776Stonewall @larryelder yeah but because he's black we've had to study his films. seems unfair to others that had more talent over the years.
@RealOmarNavarro why can't they do a photo shoot or send in conformed pics.
@NPR Or we say hey other countries, split up the land. Go!
@CarpeDonktum @TimRunsHisMouth but now you need to go over the footage for memes
@StephenAmell i thought arrow was but i guess i was wrong
@scrowder where's the link on your website?
@RubinReport huh
@BridgetPhetasy which hollywood dick did they not s*ck?
@ABC so this week is the week they admit Ruth is dead.
@StefanMolyneux just imagine how many shits have been in there
@arttavana but you can't drink beer, has to be a wine cooler
@Newsweek ya'll also have high-crime rates, and everyone is fleeing your states.
@CassandraRules why?
@RealJamesWoods i just see 3 gay dudes.
Ben Affleck should put his ego aside and just be batman. You don't have to write and direct the dang thing. But you were a good, old batman. It's time again for an old batman.
@CillizzaCNN you said that last time
@StephenAmell maybe don't marry a lesbian next time
@piersmorgan i kind of agree here. time to change your name bro
@BernieSanders the cut off all the free EBT money you give them.
@piersmorgan Dunno, heard it sucked; other than all the minority folk, which will love it regardless; then the liberals liked it because, well, they have guilt for their fathers owning slaves. So anyone that was un-biased thought it sucked.		I'm waiting for it to be on free-tv so I can watch

@HeyFLHayHay @LaLaRueFrench75 I don't understand the forced vaccinations. At this point, public school is pointless. Literally, it can all be done with apps. I slept my way through school because of a disease I have. But I'm still smarter than some of the Harvard Grads. I know personally.
I can't wait to not watch teh #Oscars
Also, Libya was a disaster. @marcorubio
@marcorubio I guess one of your aides is going to get fired for this stupid-ass tweet. Maybe something I would tweet under a fake account, but not a real account. That's not how shit works buddy.
@angelaj987 @arrowcarpet @bansisharma He didn't think it would get to that point. He had no idea there were so many cameras and He had no idea that the Police in Chicago were capable of that type of speedy investigation.

@EnchantidAgain @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler Hey man, if your kids ask you to go see buffy, and another attractive blonde is there, not the buffy they was looking for; what do you say?
@Dal_Schnur @DrJillStein Have you met any politician before? Of course they want the US to pay for it. They get a nice little slush fund to pull from, coupled w/ random trips to Venezuela for no reason other than to wine and dine. But all on tax payer dime.
@Irex64181849 @PolishPatriotTM @drawandstrike where's the red cross on thoses trucks? I see the people with masks but not on the trucks...?
@PolishPatriotTM All I see is a truck on fire, where are Marduro's peeps? I thought they were all at that boring concert He was putting on.
@manigje @NoahPaulLeGies @NPR the first chapter
@GaryACarlo @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler It was that or being Buffy.

@JulieBorowski @billmaher soup
@KNayyeh @RobProvince @AOC @IlhanMN who'd he kill?
@NoahPaulLeGies @NPR i'm not gonna disagree. i'm not christian.
@RevanMethos Well, that being said. If I hear Buffy is going to be somewhere, I would get a little upset if I see somebody else pretending the role. Of course, it don't matter. There's going to be a new one soon.
@NoahPaulLeGies @NPR that would depend on what morality means, since we're now discovering that it's temporal. but some people are inferior. you can't give everyone a trophy. 		I can't say God really cares much about gays or marriage in general, considering He created time and space. Lot's more imp.
@Jeaniepittman71 @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler ok...
@NoahPaulLeGies @NPR slippery slope man
@LarryWolff6 @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler you should be ashamed of yourself. sicko

@Paul_Berney @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler wait i don't hate trump. i troll everyone equally. insults are based on timing. no hypocrisy, i joke equally.
@NPR wonder why God decided all of a sudden to let gays get married.
My 2019 is complete now that I've pissed off Buffy. I'm so glad I didn't mention the other Buffy looking much younger and more attractive. Phew, dodged wooden stake today man.

@ht3142_seld @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler ...my books says it's the one you remember. but anyway, i'm not really a fan of buffy fan. i'm more of an angel fan.

@The_Taxdude @KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler Awe, that's so cute.
@KristySwansonXO No, Elvis is dead. This is the real Buffy https://t.co/hy4kAX5Q3i		You could be the lady from Chase or Mannequin or Flowers in the Attic; unless those have already been redone.
@jjauthor republicans in the 80s, then Obama's team updated it to be for cell phones.
@jaredlholt so they ask for money in that video?
@brianklaas @GovHowardDean Another friendly reminder, Howard Dean isn't and never will be President of the United States of America. The same is said of Hillary Clinton, the lady that ripped of Haiti.
@DailyMirror @mchastain81 this is when you lock someone up in the nut house
@SteveSGoddard @Reagan_Girl which is it?
@KristySwansonXO @theDlasvegas @SlotZillaLV @LloydEisler pretty sure the most recent buffy doesn't want you using her name.
@RepJoeKennedy @GovHowardDean and nobody has forgiven you for your Vaseline mishap. You and Howard Dean are a couple of case studies.
@RepJoeKennedy @GovHowardDean killing babies should not be an option. we have the technology now to simply remove the baby and put it in an incubator. let's pay for that instead of death. 		at what point does a preborn baby have constitutional rights to life?
@HillaryClinton technically, a lot of Keto people in the US are living on one meal a day.
@axlrose I miss pre-1992 Axl Rose. Even though I love the Chinese Democracy album. At least back then we didn't know you were a communist leftist that hated yourself. 		I mean, Guns N' Roses. The Left wants to make your band name illegal. And there ain't no getting in a ring with them.
@axlrose Freedom of Speech is a Republican issue. Are you no longer wanting the ability to say what you want to say at your concerts and on your old albums? (can't be new ones because you haven't put one out in a decade)
@TheRevAl all crimes are hate crimes. eventually what'll happen is enough whites will get together and then say any crime against a white is a hate crime. then blacks will be locked up for an even longer amount of time.
@axlrose i can't imagine your US fans being leftists. Aren't you rich enough by now to not have to bend over to your leftist masters? I'm a huge fan. seen you a few times. it just sucks you're a leftist. by the way, time for an album to come out. it's really easy to do. just gotta..do it.
@iheartmindy yeah at first it was an account with a blue checkmark, but it soon was revoked and then it started to mention it's a parody account.
@AlwaysTeamRed he lied to liz back in the day. he's red, and he's liz's father. liz killed her mom, red got her help so she could live a life. the plastic surgeon just got rid of the scars.
@TodaysInfo2 no it tells that liz is red's kid, otherwise he wouldn't risk the betrayal
@cell_my_soul i've always hated her
@GenieSea that's nasty, would ruin tv for a majority of normal folks. she would also have to take hormones or else that fake wiener would fall off. so no, it's not a sex change thing.
@TheRevAl i'm pretty sure Cohen was just around because he was the son of someone Trump admired. Outside of that, Cohen wasn't really important
@Slash brussels sucks
@KingJames @RomeTrav you're LeBron James...what's left to accomplish?

@AOC @desusnice @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN oh that's right, Billions is on tv still; gotta catch up on that.
@realDonaldTrump He did, that's why you're where you are; we don't have to go to war, but something can be done, and quickly.
@officialmcafee once it's a threat or once someone the "elite" (not you I guess, for some odd reason) fears/hates has enough bitcoin, it'll be forced to crash. some people have a sick sense of humor, especially the elite.

There aren't that many billionaires. We should want MORE billionaires in America!
@Onelifetogive @BernieSanders Nope
You do not have to feel bad if someone doesn't have money. Happiness doesn't equal the quantity of money in your bank or mattress. Happiness is subjective. 		Welfare isn't the cure, and we've proven it to be a failure. Welfare is really welfare for the big corporations.
@JakedLunch Then work yo ass off, and pay yo bills.
@Video_Two I'm not gonna respond to bots anymore.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus That's your opinion, but that doesn't make it true. Again, in America, freedom from YOUR religion; it's our choice of what we want to believe or rules we want to set morally. 		There is no true definition on what "help others" actually means. 		Teach a man to fish brother.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus You missed the point entirely. No one is forced or obligated to do anything in America.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus People should get one meal a day, basic medical care; that is, if they are to the point where they are on welfare. Food stamps and other, are all tools for big businesses. The company profiting off of the EBT transaction, Walmart, phone companies, housing. All profit from it.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus Money does not buy happiness. Successful people and businesses can help the poor by teaching by example. That example is up to the successful to decide.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus Not in America, we have freedom of our own beliefs, regardless of where you come from or where you were raised. We do not have religion or nobles. Sure, it's nice for people to give back, but they're not required to. 		Your assumption assumes that money is the answer, it's not.
Google has proven to be a shady business at this point. Who knows what conversations they have recorded without notice. The Nest or with any other device or application they use. We need to phase Google out of our lives.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus There's nothing to argue with that point, whether you think you're being funny when you're not.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus Where do you get the blood money from? Inherited money has already been paid in taxes, and should not be taxed. You want more wealthy people. The problem isn't wealthy people, the problem is we don't have enough wealthy people.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus It's not money that should be paid in taxes. It's money that could be paid in taxes, if the law makes it so, but if it doesn't then it doesn't.
"The Muthana family's attorney says the Trump administration is attempting to "wrongfully strip citizens of their citizenship," and that she does have a passport and is a citizen." -- IMO, Trump Admin is being nice because if She was a citizen, She would have committed treason.
@boneweight @Vasectomysaurus No, it's their money; employees are paid fair market wages.
@Vasectomysaurus Super-high taxes just means the people at the top are going to ask their Congress folks to give them bigger deductions.
@Vasectomysaurus #1, it's there money. They can do what they want. But a lot of times, as long as they invest it in the States, they reinvest, and things get great for the US.
@AOC meh
@BenSasse gospel must not mean what she thinks it means.
@RealJamesWoods @TheWalkingDead thanks, i'm gonna have to wait until i forget this tweet before catching up
@TommyTheBurner Was probably the hours of camera footage they went through. Eventually, any cop will be able to search through that footage instantly. That's not now but in the future. But they do have cameras everywhere now.
@Speakingout15 @realDonaldTrump that would be great, nice idea
@realDonaldTrump hopefully it has pillars that will prevent shovels from rendering our fancy fence useless.
@realDonaldTrump Glad it's not you @hodakotb
Nothing wrong with taking it in the boohole or scissoring. Well, lots of things wrong with that, but you can still be a nice person. But that hash tag is terrible, corny, and I hate it.
This is the gayest of the gay hash tags you can think of #DoItForTheCulttture #DoItForThe
I predict #DoItForTheCulttture goes out of business within 2.6 years.
@PrisonPlanet So it's normal to buy that stuff without the clerk notifying the authorities?
@BenHowe yes, it's just expensive pee.
@JorElishere =)
@NevadaJack2 @jjauthor Keep it up. Trump tends to get back at people. He says 10 times worse, but it's not really 10 times worse, but He does get back at people that slight Him.
@mrmistmonster He probably just saw the guy's face. That other guy was annoying looking.
@Sedmach Yes, you are a bigot.
@BAKKOOONN It's not the employers responsibility to know what a living wage is. They just pay the market wage. That's how America was built. That's how America has been. And that's how America will always be. Because Patriots fight back.
@OldKentuckyShrk The fat fucker attacked himself.
@WishartG1981 You must not know any billionaires. It gets lonely at the top. You want people just like you, and so you go out and try and help people become just like you. Well, not you, because you're George, and George isn't a billionaire.
@AdmiralHalo Sure, if that's what you believe.
@Sedmach You're a bigot. At least He has a show, and it does better than a lot of Liberal shows.
@BAKKOOONN I don't care how much they get. That's not my problem. Fair wages is all that matters. How you gonna ask for 15/hour when you can be easily replaced by an iPad?
@BAKKOOONN It trickled down to millions for Tucker Carlson.
@thisisinsider If aiding and giving comfort to your enemies is Treason, I'm sure using your vagina to do just that is just as much Treason. You can't come back bitches. Take your treasonous vaginas back to the hell you were living.
Of course Tucker Carlson is a millionaire funded by billionaires. So fucking what? It all trickles down. The fat fucker on welfare isn't paying his salary.
All I saw was a smug asshole, and then I hear quietly Tucker Carlson's voice. That's not being destroyed. I actually like Tucker a little bit more now that He cursed some asshole out.
Don't tell me God died on the cross; don't tell me Jesus died for me. That's bullshit. I don't care if that's your religion. It's not mine. 		God exists, and He's more powerful than a fucking cross.
@lheal Take your bullshit to the farm, leave me alone.
@JorElishere That is some stupid shit. Jesus didn't die on purpose. He was fucking murdered. I'll entertain the notion that He's the Son of God. But God, the guy that created time &amp; space, and all the planets in the sky. No, that mother fucker does not die on a fucking cross.
@cheewawa @Stihl1991 @CarpeDonktum @realDonaldTrump that's reserved for the last day, of his second term in office.
@jjauthor mind, blown.

@qanon76 Mueller is the guy that got us into Iraq by lying to Congress. He's DeepState. He's W. Bush, He's Clinton. He's not Trump's amigo. Trump has already taken too many swipes ("Witch Hunt") for Mueller to be working for Trump. 		IMO, Mueller was put there by the Powers to watch Trump
@getongab No I don't think that's the way to do it. The browser extension idea is terrible. Be a forum that replaces Twitter. Allow people to import their timelines easily. Find a way for Brands to make money, and you win.
@CassandraRules @lbrot1 Change the channel. Take away their money.
@MGozerian @lheal @BillyHallowell I don't believe God would be a woman bcuz God doesn't get fucked, does the fucking. I do not believe there is a Devil, as that would make God too weak to end evil. We're here so God can see what we're made of. He has other planets, don't you worry about masturbating. He care not.
@MGozerian @lheal @BillyHallowell I would only think of the Bible as some-what historical record, coupled with some made-up stories. God DOES exist, but He doesn't have the ego that Churches make up for Him.
@lheal @versifier146 @MGozerian @BillyHallowell @AiG God in the flesh wouldn't die on the cross.
@AltHVNP @realDonaldTrump nice grass though
@ABC no
@tedlieu because He's scary as shit
@DailyCaller you're not going to dupe people into actually watching it
@SenGillibrand so in other words, you're going to forget we exist?
@DiscussingFilm who?
@RobProvince nah
@RealBasedMAGA just say no
@TJ_Cox @DonaldJTrumpJr I'd rather find out if Ruth is a live or an impostor. It's odd there aren't photos or videos or a press conference. There should be steps to remove her if she's unfit for duty. Too much at damage can be done.
@GovEvers @benwikler remove you folks, use folks
@GovEvers @benwikler Not a democracy. We're a Republican country. That being said, you folks in Congress allowed for precedent to be set, and now, the President can use the law to fund the wall.
@RealBasedMAGA Firing squad. She committed treason. Revoke her citizenship at the very least.
@Chappyricky @GOPChairwoman Not really, the recession ended 6 months into his first term; everything after was the slowest recovery after a recession in US history. Right now, I'm not sure what's going on. We're just wasting money for no reason.
@GOPChairwoman well, we're spending more than Obama at the moment so I'm not sure it matters anymore.
@MGozerian @BillyHallowell if that's your take, why not suggests Jesus is made up to begin with?
@QuincyLovesBBWS might as well make your first-time shark fishing then
@AP4Liberty that's not what ya tell them at the bar
@Chefesse @dfking66 @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess sure, and I hope you're smart enough to know the difference between Trump &amp; Ruth..One shows up to work everyday, the other is probably dead.
@People4Bernie So you shop at planned parenthood?
@jowr_what @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess I wouldn't focus on the followers. Just talk about things that will get you some friends. You don't have to be so lonely.
@jowr_what @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess you're*
@jowr_what @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess I'm not pointing out your small penis. I'm pointing out your a bot. It's not possible to post that much and not have anyone follow you.
@dfking66 @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess Will a lawsuit suffice?
You're still a bot even if you're using a web app to control 100+ different accounts, manually.
@dfking66 @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess I don't care what they tell us, or any audio. I want a live press conference so we can gauge for ourselves whether or not she's healthy enough for such an important position. This isn't a joke. She needs to prove to us she's really there. The gov. cannot hide this.
@dfking66 @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess Considering you're a bot.
@jowr_what @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess obviously no one is listening to you, with 20k tweets; only 158 followers.
@dfking66 @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess You're not always in court. This is an important issue that the people of this fair Country have the right to know the health status of a supreme court justice.

@comesummer30 She's going through the airport, and then she's at work the next day?
@howdytherebub @ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess When they're passing off a video from last year...? When they haven't posted any recent photos?
@jerZboyUSA @gatewaypundit DDDUUUUUDDEE. My mind is blown.
@chrisgeidner You can walk into work. A photo or video can be seen going into work. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a fresh photo. At the very least she needs to do a public press conference. There's not trust with the fake news.
If Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is alive, why not show a recent photo or video? Why lie and use a video from April 2018? Why use old photos?
@DianeHering @gatewaypundit fake
@richardjwolf @USATODAY old photo
@LP36507181 @gatewaypundit fake
@ChrisPentecost3 @chrisgeidner @TheSWPrincess "see" is a key word here; where is the real video of her?
@ABCPolitics Why the hell isn't there a recent photo or video?
@LP36507181 @gatewaypundit I'm surprised gateway pundit didn't even try to validate this fake video.
@LP36507181 @gatewaypundit ...back in 2018
@marklevinshow @LindaSuhler We need to define enemy as any other Country not-America, so as to be able to charge people with Treason when they talk badly about America inside foreign nations.
You gotta judge people based on the time-period they lived, like with John Wayne. We didn't have people cutting off their dicks to the extent they are today. We didn't have a lot of things. So judge based on when He lived, not the words because words change in meaning over time.
@WWF_Australia That's not true, you don't know what kind of species the other rats self-identify as.
Hillary better run as well. I'd love to see which foot is consistently broken, or whether or not she's wearing a full-body brace still. https://t.co/SGCfp1y1FM
I'm kind of Happy Berrnie decided to run again. We really need Democrat voters to see how old and tired their leaders really are.

@RealSaavedra maybe cover up next time.
@its_GTdawg @Bmac0507 @mchastain81 Can't find the footage but I always thought Serena was a man.
@ImproperOpinion @Bmac0507 @mchastain81 That's true.
@WildBill1219 @MotownMan34 @RodStryker @TheBigGurt @realDonaldTrump By putting up these fake rules, we are now forced to get into the mud &amp; debate for endless hours. It's inefficient, &amp; it rewards the beta male. The best solution, in my opinion, is to get into the fucking ring (not including actual fucking because that's gay) &amp; solve it like men.
@WildBill1219 @MotownMan34 @RodStryker @TheBigGurt @realDonaldTrump that's a bullshit rule that was put in place by a weak person. probably around the same time the lie was taught that it's less civilized to get into a duel or fist fight to solve a problem. The duel ends it right then and there. Everyone knows the winner. A fight, well; same.
@Zioinfiltration @hogansgoat2423 @TMZ Pretty sure "damages" can be the way to stop all this fraud. I can no longer trust any paparazzi at this point. How am I gonna know, for an example, is that really a celebrity nude body part or a fake nude body part? My trust gone.
@iAaron357 @NPR that's not it at all
@NPR so it's not the vaccines, it's the weak immune system.
UNHCR, the U.N.'s refugee agency, says more than 3 million Venezuelans have now left the country because of the ongoing crisis. Most have ended up in Colombia, Brazil and other parts of South America. And when they get there, some are carrying malaria or other diseases with them.
@ZackBornstein not sure anyone is mad about it. she's just as weird as her two dads
@RealBasedMAGA @realDonaldTrump as long as you can't dig under it easily

@BradMossEsq @AshaRangappa_ he was fund raising.
@amyklobuchar that would be dumb.
@realhublife @RodStryker unless he gave aid or comfort to an enemy, it wouldn't be treason. But he could lock him up though.
@AlwaysActions @JayChpJones so what happened 2 weeks after?
@benshapiro not always.
@Bmac0507 @mchastain81 Not really cheating unless you think men are better than women. But against the rules. I usually define cheating as doing something that unfairly (while breaking rules) gives you the competitive advantage. I'm not sure having a wiener with balls makes you better at this sport.
@Phanatic_TWMS @RobFarberJr @NPR @NinaTotenberg I can not confirm nor deny that.
@RobFarberJr @Phanatic_TWMS @NPR @NinaTotenberg I'm not talking to you, I'm just clicking the button to reply to that other person.
@Phanatic_TWMS @RobFarberJr @NPR @NinaTotenberg That's not what matters. His words are exactly used to show that the law is being used the way the law was intended. "to speed things up" But it doesn't matter, there are 31 national emergencies voiding the temporal restraint.
@Phanatic_TWMS @NPR @NinaTotenberg He doesn't have to prove anything. The people suing have to prove they have a case.
@Phanatic_TWMS @NPR @NinaTotenberg Not in this case
@GOPChairwoman @RealSaavedra I'm not sure why you have to name him an anti-semite, when that's showing bias towards a religion. It's truthful to say Farrakhan is racist because he clearly is. But no one has truthfully been able to prove anti-semitism because Israel is a Country, with non-Jewish citizens.
@NPR @NinaTotenberg He doesn't have to prove anything. It just has to go through the court process to be validated. NPR should know the history of National Emergencies to know that sometimes words have legal meaning.
@MarkDice you should frame the tv now and put it on your wall
@DonaldJTrumpJr @USABookClub A bigger issue is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There hasn't been proof of life yet.
Why the hell hasn't @TMZ gotten a photograph of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2019 yet?
@kwilli1046 Probably would have asked the store to find the owner. If there wasn't an owner, they would have then called animal control. The dog would have been in-doors, and warm; locked in a cage until the city put it to sleep or the owner came forward. But that's another topic.
@MichaelAvenatti that's a crime?
@piersmorgan not at all.. she has a bunch of stock in hand lotion and Kleenex.
@michaelmalice that's insane.
@jenniferbeing @DailyCaller sorry lady
@SenGillibrand Why not fire everybody, and start with online schooling only. School is day care, just let people learn from the apps, at school. No more homework. Let people be with their families or work (i.e., chores, jobs if old enough, etc).
@SenGillibrand You're a couple years late to the discussion, the economy is good to go. Just need to start cutting expenses so as to realize the true benefit of the tax cuts. 		The public school system is failed and needs to be replaced. It's easier to replace with something new.
@jenniferbeing @DailyCaller it's a guy thing
@AndyRichter oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm sure you'll get a sausage in you before you know it. .
@fleccas @VANS_66 @PacSun those still exist though?
@holdherown For a bot, you need to learn how to read. I made a joke about her having 2 dads. Figure out what I mean by that.
@DailyCaller "educated" is more of an opinion, ask any man with a woman in their life. Come on, you know it's true. How many "blonde" moments have we all had to deal with? You know I'm right.
If Republicans were smart, they would stop with the BS about the US being a Democracy because that makes the Democratic party the default party in simple peoples minds.		We're a Republican country, let's start using that to get the simple folks on our side.

@renoomokri Or just be Mormon and have more than one.
@officialmcafee It also has to do with just letting people live there lives. Less  Gov. intervention. Look at taxis and old phone booths. Those exist because Gov. intervention.		Welfare? Who the hell knows what anybody really needs.		Welfare today is just pre-diabetes.
@officialmcafee But you're the only one that is not right? We all hate something, whether it be PCcillin or Norton or Kaspersky, there's hate. 		What is it we need? Freedom? That starts with ending the war on drugs, and the war on terror.

@ali @parscale @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino Instagram because of random celebrity nakedness, easily replaceable. Snapchat is just weird. 		The platform that replaces Facebook/Twitter would be one that allows us to import our timelines, play videos, broadcast easily, &amp; potentially handle CRM duties.
@ali @parscale @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino Twitter isn't "the Internet" it's just one platform that can always be replaced, over time.

@eatmoreartvegas @SenCortezMasto @NEAarts Most ideas are failures. A business is really just an idea. Thus, most businesses will fail, and do fail. 		Why put the Feds in the position to fail? 		At least when a business fails, the system absorbs the loss.		When the Feds fail, they bring us all down with them.
@eatmoreartvegas @SenCortezMasto @NEAarts So fucking what. That doesn't make it the Feds job to waste money on. If you have the money, you invest it. That's how the system should work because that's how it works best.

@SenSanders Why the fuck would Trump be using Social Security anyway? Dude has his name on buildings, and He's...you know...the President of the United States of America. Wasn't that something you tried, but couldn't because Hillary stole your opportunity?
@SenCortezMasto @NEAarts In this situation, it's put down the paint brush, get a real job, being a poor-and-struggling artist is only cool on TV, and in the movies. In real life, there's nothing sexier than a person with a job.
@SenCortezMasto @NEAarts If you have a talent, people will pay to see or use it. That's how the system should be. Handing out hand-outs is the same as giving welfare recipients diabetes because we lack the logistical skills necessary to tell people to put the fork down.

@NASCARNAC Move, then die after a while; sure.
My point being, if you believe there's a "deep state" or powers that be that can control things. Why are they forcing vaccinations that clearly aren't needed, don't work, or cause more death than without?
The measles breakouts happen in Europe, but my guess is that it's because of their older infrastructure, or they don't have the same hygiene as the States (re: UK people have terrible teeth; yes they, don't lie to me).
Measles is a common infection seen in many developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that 7 million measles infection occurred in 2016 and reported 89,780 measles related deaths. (that's 1.28% in third world nations!)
"Atypical” measles can occur in a person, who was previously vaccinated with a killed-virus vaccine used from 1963 to 1967, and who is exposed to wild-type measles.
“Modified” measles can also occur in persons with some degree of immunity, as well as in previously vaccinated persons, who get a milder form of measles.
I'm questioning the need to force people to vaccinate if it's against their constitutionally protected wishes. If you're pro-constitution, you should be against forced vaccinations.
In 1920, the United States had 469,924 recorded cases of measles and 7,575 deaths associated with measles. From 1958 to 1962, the U.S. averaged 503,282 cases and 432 death associated with measles each year. #Wikipedia (that's a 0.009% to 3% death rate).		Before 1962, it's 2019.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton I've literally already pointed out that the flu caused 80,000 deaths in the US; deaths from measles (reported): 0.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton the fact that this many bots are coming out with bullshit is astonishing.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton maybe to line their pockets or to experiment on the population, like the chemtrails that have since been proven correct.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton because of all the pushback, i'm actually now going to be against vaccines. Before I was just pointing out that people have a constitutional right to say no to vaccines. Now I'm under the belief that big gov. deep state ops. are using vaccines to cover something up.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton bullshit, it would have been reported as measles for the cod.
@SenMarkey silence you by making you vote on the subject?
noooooo!!! https://t.co/gxdkrEuISz

@jimsciutto It's like that time in Scotland when everybody picketed the whatever they built there, and then a few months later we hear on the news that it's opening. So it's like that...
@321Survive Or I just saved 100s of thousands of lives w/ a simple solution, that could be already used against the States.
@ComfortablySmug I bet it's a double, his face looked a little weird when they first picked him up.
@mchastain81 or a failed nordic socialism, whichever; all failed.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton When I'm home later tonight I'll send you more prove that, to them, they may consider it poison; at the very least, against their religion, and therefore, protected by our lovely constitution (unless you're from somewhere else, then I don't care).
@321Survive ideology is a subset of culture. if you change their culture by turning them into gays; telling them it's okay to remove their genitals. how are they going to come kills us then? They won't be able to. I solved the war problem. Turn your enemies into gays, and some, into trannies
@321Survive It can if you let them get fat and addicted to porn and video games, and sugar and all the things that Americans struggle with.		Oh shit, does that mean America is being fucked w/ via a cultural war?		If only we could convince them to cut off their penises and pretend to be women
@bansisharma @AOC Yeah I mean, it just puts it in the shadows. Require it to be public and on a website with an api so businesses can leverage the data and report accordingly. 		When it's hidden, who knows where the money comes from.		Not that it matters. We need to be smart enough to see evil.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton I'll finish the rest when I get home from work. See you later Tyler (or whoever the bot owner is).
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Exhibit C, polio was to cover up something; it wasn't cured by a vaccine.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Exhibit B, there is no cure for Smallpox. It's extremely deadly, killed off a lot of the Indians. But no cure?
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Exhibit A, it has its own court system and is protected from lawsuits so that we do not see the big payouts in the news.
Another interesting thing about Abraham Lincoln; had he not died, he would have had all black folk moved to Central America like how the Indians were moved out West (at his time). 		So the more you know, the less beauty you see in big gov. 		Think about that before you vote.
By the way, Happy Birthday Abraham Lincoln! He gets credit for freeing slaves, but that really only happened as a side effect of the Civil War.		There's an amendment that was never ratified because of the Civil War, it would have protected slavery, and he was okay with that.
You look at the stats on the Flu, you see that the same cause of death that we fear about the measles affects people with the Flu; the Flu has killed more people than measles has in modern times. 		https://t.co/tXJ1AF434E		And it's been proven that Flu shots do not work!
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton And that's just in the US. Look at this:		H3N2 is especially difficult to prevent with the flu shot		So, you tell me, do vaccines even work? Or do they just cause people to get sick. Just because you don't know about all the people that are not retarded because of vaccines...
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton I'm surprised you're not more scared of the flu, look at this stat:		https://t.co/YdyD3uQXMS		80,000 people died from the Flu the winter of 2017/2018.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton They are poison. They have their own court system because it's a racket. The big rich folk went out and got the gov. to protect them.		Look at the data around the flu shot every year.
@edhunter54 9/11 was a cover up of some sort. You look at W's reaction. It's a reaction of "oh fuck, how do we fix this"		His reaction was not "oh fuck, those bastards attacked us; I'm going to kill every last one of them!"		See, his reaction let's you know what happened.
@edhunter54 They won't be able to do it to us if we are not over there... Blowback is the big problem. But even then, I'm really skeptical about terrorism really existing.
@MisterJimSmyrna @ChelseaClinton The solution is to have a better system in place that catches the disease as it enters the US. Or wherever in Russia you're from. In the US, you can't just go out and poison people; we're protected from you via our constitution. You must be a baby killing democrat.
@MisterJimSmyrna @ChelseaClinton If your children die because you're not parenting them with love and protection, that's your problem. Again, I've posted the stats. Measles is just a big pharma. wet dream because it gets people to inject themselves with something they do not need.
@TabsJ @nessie_chandler @ChelseaClinton Again, someone that doesn't have measles isn't putting your kid at risk. It's sad to hear that about your daughter, but that doesn't give you the right to force feed someone with what they believe is to be poison. Not in the US, maybe in Russia or wherever you are from, sure.
@nessie_chandler @soldiergrrrl @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton You get yourself a bot so you can feel good huh. I literally answered all your questions, and literally proved my points, multiple times. It's not my fault you were born with a learning disability.
@pig_overlord_ @JoeSilverman7 @TheDemocrats I mean how many bot accounts do you have to create. Just move on brother.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Someone that isn't vaccinated isn't going to create measles and cause a breakout. Someone that comes in here from areas that have it are bringing it in, and thus causing the breakouts. Even with the breakouts, the Flu virus is deadlier.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Again, you're not seeing human rights as rights. You do NOT have the right to forcibly poison someone just because you're too stupid to read the data. It's there. Just read it.		If you truly wanted to end measles, you would smart and put rules in place that would prevent carriers
@pickingcrabs @JoeSilverman7 @RobProvince If done by the Gov., it's a punishment regardless of the size of the teeth.
@pickingcrabs @JoeSilverman7 @RobProvince That makes you a Nazi. People should only be punished for crimes committed, and then given a chance for society to forgive them. 		We lock up more people than any other country. Guess what? Prisoners are legally forced to work without compensation.
If you believe in the deep state, then why do you not believe the deep state would convince the public to take vaccines for their own monetary gains, and/or to cover up radiation leaks or advanced weapons testing? Chemtrails were basically proven true recently.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Reading between the lines, we're forcing more people to die by taking a vaccine than it would be if they just got sick with measles.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton As many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton The vaccine for the flu has been proven to cause more problems than the actual flu, which is of course more lethal than measles. 		Here are some stats, we both have equal access to the data: https://t.co/KuloUJ9jIi
@pickingcrabs @JoeSilverman7 @RobProvince Fine, go ahead, go kill anybody you decide is a Nazi*. What would that make you when you're done with the killing?
@NavAirVet The fact that you're bigoted enough to think that is repulsive.
@NavAirVet Not everyone has to serve, that's the beauty of being an American. We're not supposed to have a standing military. Every American participates in the system. We do NOT have nobles; we do NOT have kings. 		You served, that's great, but that doesn't make you better than me.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Then stop allowing people to come in here with the disease. Update our tourism/visa system. I'd rather fix the problem. You may be a Democrat, but I am not; Humans have rights where I come from. We should NOT be forcing people to be injected with what they consider POISON.
@theDonaldLong @JoeSilverman7 @TheDemocrats It's 2019, time to move on.
@soldiergrrrl @ChelseaClinton However, the punishments for DUIs are causing more harm than good. I believe there should be forgiveness built into our justice system; especially now that DUI tickets are now considered outdated.
@soldiergrrrl @ChelseaClinton That being said, I do not believe a breathalyzer is accurate in telling whether or not someone is drunk. And roadside blood tests are out of the question. That's some nazi bullshit. This is America. 		Should someone drink and drive? They should not be drunk and driving.
@soldiergrrrl @ChelseaClinton Again, this isn't really an issue now that uber and self-driver cars are taking over the roads. But if I must say, the stats on DUIs are bullshit. Alcohol-related is not that same as alcohol caused accidents.
@soldiergrrrl @nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton What I'm getting at is you're into killing pre-born babies, and then forcing people to put what they believe to be poison into their bodies because you're scared of what the government has told you to fear.
@soldiergrrrl @nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton It's proves a point. You're just "for" whatever people tell you to be for. Think for yourself. If you're killing babies, you do not care about life. 		What's common is your lack of respect of an individuals life, liberty and freedom.
@Ifitsthisname @JoeSilverman7 @RobProvince Pointing out that you should forgive and forget after 35 years isn't supporting them. They're not my problem.
@BeachlifeisB @NavAirVet @JoeSilverman7 Nope. My bio changes depending on my mood. Here, I'll point it to someone else.
@NavAirVet If that's the case, then war will never end. Quit being a bigot.
@tghw @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Maybe contagious (so is the cold/flu), but it will only kill 0.2% that get it. More people die from the flu.
@G130J @JoeSilverman7 @RobProvince It's totally relevant. You can't blame people for actions they did not commit.
@doctorwhoviana @ChelseaClinton 15k tweets and you joined in 2017. That's too many tweets for a normal person to achieve in 2 years.
@doctorwhoviana @ChelseaClinton I would say the same thing about having any kid near you. 15k tweets and only 221 followers; you're a bot.

@chrisdelia well, back in my day, singers used to pee on people's faces. so there.
If measles is breaking out, then it's because of people coming into the country with the disease (illegals, tourists, visa people), or the vaccines fail enough to cause an outbreak.		If measles was eradicated, then you wouldn't need a vaccine, because the virus would not exist.

@nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton so you believe a woman has the right to kill a pre-born baby?
@nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton an un-vaccinated child isn't the issue. that's what you don't seem to understand. a disease doesn't just show up out of no where. who brought the measles in the area? was it a failed vaccination? a mutation? an illegal? a tourist (any visa)?
@IlhanMN Don't let a snake in your office.

@nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton the victim is the persons freedom you took away, not the one with a genetic disability.
@nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton I'm actually thinking about the issue. You're trying to take away someone's freedom and inject them with something they consider to be poison. Who's more human? You're obviously not considering the other human being.
@fussie44 @RyanGirdusky there*
@fussie44 @RyanGirdusky It's obvious the women over their aren't causing enough erections to happen. Or it's too cold. I haven't been there before. But as long as you have beautiful woman around, you're not going to have a problem. That or maybe the men have erectile dysfunction.
@bansisharma @IlhanMN Well, that's another issue. If the countries are a threat, Israel has a right to protect themselves. If that also means taking over other countries, then so be it. But they should do it themselves, and pay for it themselves.
@Lazysuzzan @Michell20001249 @ChelseaClinton again, you chose to get pregnant and you chose to teach in a school that didn't have security measures in place. Your body, your choice. Except when you're killing a pre-born baby. 		If someone farts, would you arrest them if people were allergic to the smell?

@NurseMette @ChelseaClinton no illegal immigration and tourism brought it back. still debatable on if it was vaccines or just evolution that eradicated measles.
@bansisharma @IlhanMN and I don't see anything great about being a democracy in general. that just allows mob rule. i always feel more free in other countries that i do in the US
@bansisharma @IlhanMN i see statements all the time about so and so being anti-Semitic just because they questions something about it. I think it's okay to wonder about. We give too much money to Israel, and to any country for that matter. I'm pro-USA, what happens in the middle east is not my problem

@iheartmindy to be honest, a sock is probably cheaper, and has the same outcome.
@BetoORourke will you be a furby?
@CalebJHull @jihadwatchRS they don't drink beer
@bansisharma @IlhanMN it's okay to question things without being anti- anything. Even though she is but still. We should question why we are giving iseal so much money.
@w_terrence settle for a coyote
@HananyaNaftali @IsraelUSAforevr we should be given it for free. And then we should be upset another country has a technology that we do not posses.
@mikebaker137 @JacobAWohl Why does that matter? You a bigot against fat people?
@nessie_chandler @legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton again, those are precautions that someone should take before going out in public. If a hospital isn't a safe place, we need to invent safer hospitals.
@Davese41 @JMorris84733778 @ChelseaClinton I already answered it twice.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton design a smarter hospital.
@MediaPiperKat @ChelseaClinton Vaccines work and they don't work. It's the free persons choice to get it or not.
@elliemp21 @ChelseaClinton how would they go about doing that?
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Not at all. Hospitals should be able to pay for themselves. I've seen how fancy doctors areas are.
@Pam6609 @jwj @ChelseaClinton It's their right to choose, their body, their choice. Drugs have side affects. Why not let people have their choice.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton I've shown that I know the subject, and the solutions better than you. You're talking about a failed hospital design that allows the spread of diseases.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton A safer hospital, and if we have to have little centers that specialize in each thing, so be it. You're exposing a problem with hospitals, not anti-vaxxers.
@HippyDippyHay @jwj @ChelseaClinton You can safely ignore a problem that affects less than 1% of a population.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton Again, you're talking about the hospital being an unsafe place. That's something that should be investigated. How many hospitals are legally liable for getting people sick and possibly, dead?
@GretchenL0703 @jwj @ChelseaClinton I'm not causing anyone to suffer. If you put your kids in unsafe conditions, that's your fault.
@JMorris84733778 @ChelseaClinton cares =&gt; cars*
@JMorris84733778 @ChelseaClinton I think it's a non-issue because driver less cares are going to be a thing in the next few years. Already starting to see them rolled out. Don't bring up outdated issues.
@OttoTitsling @kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton I know how to solve problems. You know how to take away someone else's freedom.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton again, what does getting a book which is so pre-2005 have anything to do with this? you're talking about a hospital that isn't safe. The hospital needs to fix its shit.
@NurseMette @OttoTitsling @ChelseaClinton see, this is an example of why things never get solved.
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton or perhaps you can just make a safer hospital. I would have hoped that would have been something they thought about already, but I guess you're pointing out many design flaws in hospitals. maybe it's best to have smaller medical facilities that can be secured better.
@OttoTitsling @kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton again, you're just making shit up and it's not really worth talking about.
@NurseMette @OttoTitsling @ChelseaClinton I know more than you, yes. But your medical expertise doesn't have any importance in this discussion.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton don't steal someone else's freedom because you're scared and not smart enough to find a solution that allows freedom and liberty.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton so then blame your hospital for shitty policies
@OttoTitsling @kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton that seems like an issue with how hospitals; it's 2019, use technology and brains, solve your problem without taking away someone elses freedom.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton again, that's your problem. be smart and don't let it happen.
@JMorris84733778 @ChelseaClinton I think the stats on the deaths are bullshit, but within reason, there should be rules on that. alcohol related means  anyone not driving but with alcohol in them would be added to that statistic. it's all a lie.
@NurseMette @ChelseaClinton how many cats do you have?
@kimmieg56 @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton don't let your new born by other kids then. If you can't be vaccinated, that's a risk you have to live with. Same with allergies.
@OttoTitsling @NurseMette @ChelseaClinton where's the lie?
@jwj @ChelseaClinton and a better java programmer than you.
@jwj @ChelseaClinton It's not ignoring science. It's calling bullshit on a vaccine that might do more damage than good.  Every year we find out the flu vaccine was a waste. 		Same could be said about measles or other. 		Look at the % of people actually affected. If something is like 1%, no vaccine.
@jwj @ChelseaClinton I'm a patriot with a fucking mustache.
@GretchenL0703 @jwj @ChelseaClinton you're now talking about doing bad things because you're scared; sort of like mobs hanging people back in the day. that's not nice.
@GretchenL0703 @jwj @ChelseaClinton no you could just get a vaccine.
@tactless86 @reeeeeteam6 @LevineJonathan @jtLOL and why should someone be arrested? why? if it's fake, you can't prove it, yet. But even if, why arrested? Make him pay for it. Keep the court system open for bigger crimes.
@tactless86 @reeeeeteam6 @LevineJonathan @jtLOL whatever the rule is for a case to be a cold case, sure. if you can't solve it, it shouldn't be closed. but you're only able to work on so many cases. that's being honest.
@jwj @ChelseaClinton Selfish of what? You're a mean person, that's just something you're going to have to live with.
@NurseMette @ChelseaClinton no, that other person is at risk because that other person put themselves at risk for whatever reason.
@voxdotcom @TrumperAZ i only hope there aren't a herd of illegals coming in with measles.
@legaleagle48 @ChelseaClinton what's your point?
@NurseMette @ChelseaClinton they why don't you kick out the illegals and tourists that are spreading it in the first place
@NurseMette @ChelseaClinton it's not putting someone else at risk.
@jwj @ChelseaClinton vaccines have their own court system.  clearly vaccines could be safer. and if someone wants to choose not to, that's there god-given american right.
@ChelseaClinton if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. that's freedom.

@roderickburrell @BadPrincessSara @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Essentially businesses are double-dipping. The US pays for it, and then they make money from the currency increase, property increases, etc.
@roderickburrell @BadPrincessSara @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Of course Businesses love war, because they get to sell their product and over charge for it to boot. Investors love war because when the currency hits the shitter, they buy in low, and then when the US has paid for the rebuild, their investment is paid off handsomely.
@roderickburrell @BadPrincessSara @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Politicians love war because they get lots of money and line items that can be use to funnel money to their personal accounts.
@roderickburrell @BadPrincessSara @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Shit, if anything, Assad &amp; ISIS (ISIL) would roll out a red carpet and all the booze in the area. Who stands to gain by keeping the US over there? The politicians and the Businesses that profit from war.
@roderickburrell @BadPrincessSara @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Why on Earth would you provoke the enemy that is leaving? If this was a real war, then the enemy would use tact. When the US says they're leaving a country, everybody would pause for the time-being; why? Because if you enemy is leaving, who you gonna keep fighting?
@BadPrincessSara @charlsdextward @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard If it smells like bullshit, it's legitimate bullshit.
@BadPrincessSara @charlsdextward @tomselliott @TulsiGabbard Yes because it makes total sense for Assad to use chemical weapons every time the US says they're going to pull out of Syria.

@SleeplessInTeh @RealOmarNavarro @AOC That's true. But they picked her because she reminds people of Michael Jackson, and Charles Manson (whether we know this or not).

@FSplintie @Heritage @klonkitchen Or it is Jennifer Lawrence with Steve's face. Or who gets ownership? Is it Steve with Jennifers small boobed body? A philosophical question perfect for a school essay. Either way, people should be trained to be smart, not assumed to be too stupid to know the difference.
@AOC Yeah but to be fair, Kaepernick sucks. If he was good, like Dennis Rodman, or name some other asshole; If he was good, he would play in the NFL. But he sucks, so he's just another asshole in protesting.
@SenRickScott @ricardorossello those socks are terrible.
@va_shiva There's another guy down the street that says our bodies thrive on animal fats, and only eats once a day. So now I don't know who to believe.
@Heritage @klonkitchen Or we can teach kids not to believe everything they see, and thus, we would have citizens that are immune to most bullshit.
@RawStory Or you have a guy that is a billionaire by his own hand, and then a College professor that is bitter about life; maybe that Guy's wife left him or he caught herpes. Sometimes it's possible for someone to know something you don't know.
@pulte No but I'm sure the local drugs dealers are happy they have a cool new spot to sell drugs at.

@Dan__Crocker @ScottPresler @Hollyhoo71 Also, there are bunch out there, but they're not innovating like Twitter.
@DCornpole @SaysHummingbird that was such a dumb comment that I now feel sorry for your parents.

@TotalProSports To be honest, B. You're not gonna want to go your whole life telling people you went to the Super Bowl, but your team lost. Better to just be a winner, at home, drunk and a chance of banging your spouse or significant other.

@dbongino That and they have only a few million people, not close to 300 million like here.

@DanCrenshawTX I saw a guy at the bar once and said good eye mate. He got so pissed. I felt bad until I had another couple beers.
@submandave @seanagnew Even though soul man came out in 86 or so. There were people doing blackface on TV, and you know what, people had a sense of humor once. 		I don't even care one bit that he did blackface or the KKK. 		What I do care about is preventing Politicians from murdering babies.
@submandave @seanagnew I see black folk all the time dressing up as the KKK for Halloween. Even Hillary did a blackface event. Ted Danson did once. The fat guy from Ghostbusters did once. 		But Soul Man was a guy that turned black for most of the show. He pulled an Elizabeth Warren.
@submandave @seanagnew Is this a serious statement here? Of course people see something on TV and they do that for a costume occasion. I don't know what the event was about, but it seems like it was something that could have happened in the 80s before everyone on the left turned into human vaginas.
@JoelOsteen I like your work. But can you slow down your eyes a bit? Hard to look at you, I might have to put a filter on that replaces your eyes with normal human eyes. But again, I like your work.

@RealSaavedra NOOO!!!!! I like her!!! Little Manson is exactly what we need as a Democratic Rep. So much cheaper than paying people to convince the world to become Republican. Just have Charlies bastard Daughter (re: AOC) talk in public.
@CecilyTynan @6abc I'm not seeing a penis in the photo. Why would people be sharing them?
@JoyAnnReid wouldn't you be out of a job if you couldn't bitch about Trump 9-5?
@1776Stonewall you're a cat lady?
@RealBasedMAGA @CNN So stop watching them. Stop reporting on them. Don't give them viewers. Let them die alone and gay with mutilated genitals (because that's what happens when you cut it off to become a woman). Block them from yo life.
@tonyschwartz Some people believe midgets are Gods, but that doesn't make it true. Climate change originated in Russia once upon a time. Back then it was named global cooling. But it quickly changed to global warming. Then things happened, the origination was lost, now it is climate change.
What year was the vaseline face guy on for the Trump Rebuttal? That was some funny shit. Hopefully Stacey Abrams can live up to that standard.
We all love to be entertained, but we do not want to be betrayed by our news orgs. https://t.co/zQx45xdUay
All these news orgs are killing themselves. We're given the technology to block their content, and we have alternatives that we trust more. There's plenty of money in journalism as it is an extension of education, and the education market is on fire right now.
@gcole63 @entropos @swissmiss2003 @hipp1369 @justinamash It doesn't matter if the person lives on the border or not. It's a national issue.
@JoeFreedomLove i know it's not tea, but same idea folks.
@JoeFreedomLove well, we have a russia plant, we have Charlie Manson's bastard child, and we have a guy that convinced the world to overpay for coffee. Shit, if the Brits had him back in the day, would there have really been a boston tea party?
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton the shirt is too baggy. either someone missed a gym day or someone is getting a little shy with showing off da muscles.
@DailyCaller why can't i ever make the news for trolling. shit, just gotta keep at it.
@bansisharma all he has to say is free coffee and he wins.
@March_for_Life @FoxNews don't have to be an OB/GYN to slam it. just saying. we are all free people here.
@riceman79 @DanielM62699792 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash nah, i'm just gonna start a new thread somewhere else
@mr_gman84 @EricKlemstein @justinamash bullshit
@riceman79 @DanielM62699792 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash what the fuck are you talking about
@mr_gman84 @EricKlemstein @justinamash Anyway, make up all the shit you want about the space force. Our national protection is something the gov. already handles. You're asking for the gov. to take on something that has proven to be handled better outside of the gov. control.
@mr_gman84 @EricKlemstein @justinamash health insurance is NOT health care. health insurance is the "payment" part. and thus, it's reasonable to wonder where the money will come from. Going into outer space will help boost our technology. paying for everyones insurance is just fucking dumb.
@riceman79 @DanielM62699792 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash #1, why don't you go change the laws that let it happen. #2, why not make it harder to import drugs? #3, what the fuck are you talking about?
@EricKlemstein @justinamash It's the feds duty to protect its citizens; it's the law that says the President gets to decide when to use a federal state of emergency.
@mr_gman84 @EricKlemstein @justinamash You have that backwards, but you're a Democrat so it all makes sense now.
@riceman79 @DanielM62699792 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash Theft of course is immoral, that's why it's wrong for the illegals to try and steal the American Dream from Americans.
@bennyjohnson stalker
Health insurance is the payment part, not the care part.
@riceman79 @DanielM62699792 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash how so? When a kid is sold to sex slavery or to be Nancy's nanny, is that not immoral? When a cartel member comes through to sell drugs to little highschoolers, is that not immoral?
@RedNationRising They should just say they're illegal so they can get a free house.
@ckerstiens @hipp1369 @justinamash You own a home, you have State owned land where the sidewalk is and where the utility lines run. That's a normal thing. It's to be expected when you own property. The same as the border. I feel no sympathy.
@ckerstiens @hipp1369 @justinamash What does that matter? Illegal immigration hurts all Americans, not just the land owners that are more fearful of losing land that they knew was someday going to be purchased from them. You don't go buying land on the border and not expect issues.
@MikeHudema dude just buy a swamp cooler already
@riceman79 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash I agree I'm a funny fucker. I also think there's something weird going on with that Justin guy. I'll have someone write an article explaining how Trump is obligated to build the wall so that crime will fall.
@JoeFreedomLove Then she smiles and winks
@riceman79 @alllibertynews @thelongversion @justinamash You're*
@DontMessWMurphy @TonyOhms @justinamash What's his con? Making NYC more beautiful back in the 80s?
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash Alright time to piss off wanker, I gotta go to me job.
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash It's not like the budgets from before have been depleted. Trump's just trying to get more money so he can say it was completed early, and with all this money left over that He can then use for something eye watering.
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash The original "mexico will pay for it" was just a poorly timed joke that Trump didn't handle well, but indirectly, Mexico will pay for it because the trade deficit will swing in our favor. Anyone that owns a business speaks the way Trump does with how Mexico will pay for it.
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash Okay, fine, it's not being built. But it is, but I'll be nice and let you say it's not. When it really is.
@thelongversion @justinamash That being sad, as a retired "journalist" please take the two seconds required to read the constitution and the laws of the land because repeating lies and other bullshit that isn't helping protect American citizens is only helping the devil. God wants you to be honest.
@thelongversion @justinamash It's even sadder when a congress person doesn't know the actual laws in place. Mister No-Vote is a Yes-Vote for Democrats 80% of the time. I'd look into which Democrat-Donor funds Justin. There's something sneaky about this guy.
Chris Christie says Trump's campaign was too unorganized to collude. Interesting take. I don't know any other campaign that flew to 2 or 3 States in a day to rally the voters. But hey, unorganized.
@redsteeze #metoo
When we have caravan after caravan heading towards our border, at a certain point, we should just go ahead and call it for what it is, an invasion. You can defeat a country when you invade and overrun its culture. War isn't always fought with bombs.
@DontMessWMurphy @TonyOhms @justinamash You could but I'm not into fiction. Please just leave me alone. Nothing you say will ever make it into my brain, I have a bullshit filter, only truth makes it into my brain.
@rooshv wait, was your video a real video? I thought you were just being a twitter person and posting something for likes and retweets?
Chris Christie isn't the best person for advice, unless he really did break the law with that bridge, and now He's speaking from experience on how to get away with a crime.
RT @FranSzpylczyn: After all, Chris Christie is trending... https://t.co/HpoSVr0RXt
Happy Birthday Oprah Winfrey!! May all the people you've stepped on and destroyed forgive you!
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash It's already being built.
@HeidiFtoad @DRUDGE_REPORT All I'm saying is that a true Christian Senator Libertarian would have gone with forgiveness over money. It goes against Paul's teachings (and his father's). So this lawsuit is a glimpse of the real Rand Paul.
@HeidiFtoad @DRUDGE_REPORT Past Presidents have shot people. What's your point? Violence is more efficient than months in court. I would argue, liberals have corrupted our views on what justice really is.
@DontMessWMurphy @TonyOhms @justinamash It's an emergency when the President deems it as such. That's the law of the land.
@gopoundsand1234 Devil's advocate, it could also have a correlation with what women look like too.
@EllenTracy13 @DRUDGE_REPORT My point being, a libertarian shouldn't use the gov. like that.
@EllenTracy13 @DRUDGE_REPORT So what if he was assaulted. He's a libertarian. Or at least he plays one on tv.
@XowiiWowii1 @Landslide1973 @AOC Obviously her Dad is either Charlie Manson or Michael Jackson or both.
@Landslide1973 HOLY SHIT!!! It's like the time when Michael Jackson &amp; Charlie Manson fucked. But only not butt sex and a baby was made. Holy shit.
@DRUDGE_REPORT I'm a little shocked Libertarian Rand Paul would seek such a high amount of money. I'm shocked he even sued. I guess money is tight for Rand.
@APatriotWar @RodStryker @SweetKat111 Where is that law written? I would believe they never went through the actual process to make her a citizen and that she later did so when she went to college or came back to the States. But proof would be something of value here.
@Josh4Trump @JoshNoneYaBiz The rocks probably reported you to Twitter.

@ozarklatinist Says a man on Twitter.
@DanielWiener16 @hipp1369 @justinamash People don't just sit and live in the border towns you know.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash Without tracking the people on visas, what is the value of an Iris scan? Can someone simply...leave the State...in a car?
@HelenSavage @hipp1369 @justinamash No one likes you Helen, that is why the world around you is quiet.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash Biometric? If you're talking GPS, easily cut off and then a quick drive to another state. Are you saying we do facial recognition to track? Or just require a thumbprint before they get in here? That doesn't work. I'm done with you. Bye.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash Obviously we want a wall that fucking works and isn't easily bi-passed. Tunnels will happen, but obviously those will take time to build. And once shut down, it will be many months before something is up and running again.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash The morons that built that part of the wall, and the congress people the approved of the work, should be sued. If a wall costs more than a billion, I expect the wall to have thought about basic loopholes. But that's the fault of the past.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash The Visa situation is easy to handle. Countries known for illegal immigration will require a deposit among other things that will prevent Visa overstays. That's solved. Now let's build the wall to the solve the other problems.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash The rapist named Beto will be kept out of here and will not enter his 6th time once the wall is finished.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash You do know walls work don't you?
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash The assholes interviewed don't want to lose property, and they're okay with human trafficking as long as it doesn't affect their lives.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash The source that said we don't need a wall was anonymous. The article is bullshit, and you're just dumb for thinking it as fact.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash It's the same as back when Democrats owned slaves. The same today.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash I tried to respect you but you're just a moron. They're mad that illegals are being dropped off in their town with no money. LOL are you kidding me? Shortage of work and Americans won't do the work? Total bullshit. Pay more, and I'll wash yo dishes. You want illegals for cheap
@MrFusion16 @hipp1369 @justinamash And you're a porn bot. Go get the lube and bug off Thomas.
@Trumpseedeadppl @mikehltm1 @justinamash It's already law. Congress is negligent.
@ICallahan1966 @phil_mckraken @entropos @hipp1369 @justinamash His twitter handle is always going to say the opposite of what you say. It's a feature, not a bug.
@phil_mckraken @ICallahan1966 @entropos @hipp1369 @justinamash We can, let's do that. Let's grant amnesty to everyone. Let's open our borders and let everyone in. Let's put everyone on welfare. Free houses for everyone. While that happens, you'll see Americans with guns form mobs and then we'll have a civil war that Democrats seem to want.
@BCrawfordCA @justinamash @POTUS It's in the law. By the way, I'm taking the rainbow back from gay people. You tarnished the rainbow for too long. But you can keep unicorns because those gay.
@RKJ65 @hipp1369 @justinamash You're a Dick, they just don't want to have a very long convo. That's Dick in a non-threatening way, more of a scientific description of what you are kind of way.
@WiltonDiary @hipp1369 @justinamash @POTUS And that's not saying it's a lie, it's just being positive. You are 33% smarter when you have a positive mindset. Better than any nootropic on the market.
@WiltonDiary @hipp1369 @justinamash @POTUS What lies? He was taught by a guy named Vincent about the power of positive thinking. Who says they're the 6th best pizza joint in the city? So that's why Trump is Trump, and everything is going to be great. Because He knows that's how you make billion dollars.
@MichaelKrause6 @justinamash Lock Hillary up and we'll start to see America as America again.
@WiltonDiary @B_rrraaad @withaphsound @hipp1369 @justinamash @realDonaldTrump Nope. Wrong.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS We can start with the constitution. We can end with the secure fence law. Either way, it's in the law of the land. Some may suggest Congress is negligent by not following the law.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS Okay so you're a person using an app and toggling between screen names as you look midget porn.
@nanamic52 @justinamash @POTUS Again, the President is the one that decides when it's an emergency. He may decide it's not. He may decide it is. We wait, we see.
@DonnaNoble10th @TonyOhms @justinamash Want to know what else doesn't matter? Your face. It's also in the constitution and law for the President to protect Americans.
@VocalicScissors @justinamash @POTUS It's already law mister bot. President his fulfilling is oath of office. Justin is not.
@macphisto96 @hipp1369 @justinamash You're a liar.
@cvillejohn18 @justinamash @POTUS I mean, at what point does one grow a brain. Gun control is against the constitution. Obama was in violation of his oath of office by promoting gun control. The constitution says it's the United States duty to protect Americans from invasions.
@MonicaSmalls2 @GcCraft @Donnie2Scoop @justinamash Technically, because the treasury is empty (20T), it doesn't matter what happens. Congress has the purse, but the purse is fucking empty. It's all fake money.
@MonicaSmalls2 @GcCraft @Donnie2Scoop @justinamash Secure fencing act. It's the president's duty to see to it the laws are enforced. Furthermore, the United States shall protect each State in the Union from invasion. (re: wall).
@Carma_2012 @Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash this is stupid, i'm out of this convo. i just want to make jokes on twitter. i don't want to teach US laws.
@Carma_2012 @Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash he even pees on the mini fencing every time. he owns that fence now.
@Carma_2012 @Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash No he's not our citizen so he's deported, then he sneaks back over the mini-fencing.
@Carma_2012 @Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash Rape isn't murder but that's not the point. Crime will happen, that is true, but we can limit our crime rates, as our God-given right.
@SeptemberDresan @gul_garak @justinamash I guess the dunes are cool, but that's it.
@Carma_2012 @Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash I'm pretty sure he wasn't racist about who he raped. But soon he'll be Mexico's problem. They can arrest him, as he's their citizen.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS I know you're a new bot created to talk to me, but come on now. Obama &amp; Clinton &amp; Schumer voted for it already. It is law. We're just trying to get the funding for a law that was already passed.
@Buffy6900 @justinamash @POTUS I'm really flattered someone made a bot just to talk to me. But let's end this discussion.
@TheRebelTV @SheilaGunnReid Just like his Daddy Castro.
@Buffy6900 @justinamash @POTUS Does a millionaire make you a billionaire? And yes, if he says it's an emergency, then it is an emergency, by law.
I predict the real El Chapo is doing some pepsi right now.
@Buffy6900 @justinamash @POTUS Why were you never able to become a billionaire? Maybe someone knows something you don't know.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS It's already law. At this point, we're just trying to get the funding. One tool that is used by Governors all the time is the state of emergency to release reserve funds. It's not taking anything from congress, it's just part of law that allows Trump to quickly fund the wall.
@SeptemberDresan @gul_garak @justinamash Not as badly as it does to live there, I'm sure.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS Again, DACA was writing law without Congress. The other is enforcing law with a law. It's an emergency when congress fails to act. It hasn't been enacted yet. But could be, when it's deemed an emergency by the President, the one that is with the authority to decide as such.
@Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash There's a child rapist out there named Beto, he's been kicked out of the US 5 times. Once that wall is up, Beto will only be raping Mexican children. Or whatever other country will have him. But not in the US. Beto won't be able to rape anymore American children.
@Kerib321 @hipp1369 @justinamash A lot of people from south of the border are white. Lots of illegals are white upon white. Their kids will be white. What's xenophobic about wanting to keep some white people out?
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS That's not the same issue, or difference, at all. One is Obama essentially writing a law on His own. The other is Trump enforcing the law as written, to fund another law that was passed by Congress. 		The similarity is what?
@jbearclan @justinamash The Mormon's thought that was the case for hundreds of years. Get them to change their school name.
@jbearclan @justinamash It's pretty clear, with laws and case law to go with it.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS ...animated gif. You must have a valid point then. All the things of truth I spoke, must be validated now because of your animated gif. I really do apologize for thinking I could go against with with my truth that most should listen to. I apologize for being right but now...
@gul_garak @justinamash It is quite possible for a random on Twitter to know the law better than a do-nothing in Congress. Voting 99% doesn't make you better than anyone else. What does? Getting things accomplished. Of which, Just knows not.
@gul_garak @justinamash With all those people voted in and out of office. You know what they all have in common? They think they know the law better than their peers. But that doesn't make it law, that doesn't prove anything.
@gul_garak @justinamash In court of law, 2 sides of lawyers battle over the law. One will win because one-side knows the law better, or you know, they have justice on their side; depending on the context. In Congress, they talk and talk, and sometimes get shit done. Justin doesn't get anything done.
@gul_garak @justinamash I'm pretty sure Justin muted or blocked me by now. But you're a Dick (just by the legal definition). Open a book or use the Google, learn a little. Just because you do not know something, it doesn't imply someone else can't be smarter than you.
@gul_garak @justinamash And that's another ism, of which, Justin does not believe in.
@gul_garak @justinamash libertarianism comes from socialism because anarchism is socialism. the foundation of the libertarian philosophy, and for many years, was nothing to brag about because it was socialism and anti-capitalism. it doesn't matter if people forgot what it actually meant.
@realDailyWire @benshapiro no
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS Okay you're on a different topic, start a different Tweet.
@gul_garak @justinamash With that said, Justin is probably funded indirectly by the Democratic party.
@gul_garak @justinamash A true libertarian wouldn't really believe in money or personal ownership. When thinking of a libertarian, think of Noam Chomsky.
@gul_garak @justinamash Anarchy is the parent of Libertarianism. Anarchy is bullshit.
@gul_garak @justinamash There's a libertarian party now, it's not just a philosophy. Say it's a philosophy; It's a shitty philosophy that is anti-capitalsm. It doesn't really have a true form because it's never really been implemented.
@DosPassosII @justinamash @POTUS I don't care about Obama, look towards the future. Congress failed back then, let's not let them fail anymore.
@SeptemberDresan @gul_garak @justinamash Your State sucks anyway, you can have him. But hopefully he retires soon, it's been too long for a guy to not accomplish anything. He's the established bastard in Congress. Gets nothing done.
@PeterCozy Starve the fucker just like when someone is cut off from drugs. There's pain, but do you love them enough to let them live a normal life?
@Trumpseedeadppl @justinamash Wrong topic. Start a new Tweet.
@morganmurtaugh @rumble_up how so?
@SenRickScott No, you're the voice for Floridians. If you decide to pick favorites, then you will be One-Term Scotty.
@Trumpseedeadppl @justinamash Wrong topic, please start another Tweet with the legislation you would like to debate.
@TheRevAl i liked you better when you were fat.
@DowhowerDenise @RodStryker @JulieReichwein1 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle @marklevinshow she dead.
@stranahan @CassandraRules cuz you probably watched her porn videos back in the day.
@hipp1369 @justinamash I vote yes
@IlhanMN Now what happens when we give the 20 billion, the job is done. Right? We can end all other welfare programs?
@IlhanMN and then? what happens? You buy up land for them, it raises the value of the land, and then, we pay more. Which I guess doesn't mater because they could just buy the land themselves if they were mentally ill.
@nectarina12 @sportswithscott @freedominacage1 @WordandWitness @justinamash does anybody?
@gul_garak @justinamash I do not trust a person that says he's not exactly a republican while being an actual republican. I'd like to study his votes. Ignore the no votes. But study the yes votes. Some look good at first look, but what if you look at the details.
@gul_garak @justinamash Another topic for another day.
@gul_garak @justinamash Furthermore, if you're so scared of that happening, then why don't you help vote out all the establishment people like Justin that keep voting for socialism.
@gul_garak @justinamash That's another topic and you're an asshole (in a non-threatening, smile/nod kind of way) for mentioning this. Using a law to divert funds is not comparable to crazy lefties turning the US into a socialist's wet dream.
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS What if a midget cuts off his penis in the middle of the night? Weird shit can happen. But what does that have to do with anything? It's using a law to fulfill a law. Why so many against that?
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS Some would say that's more enjoyable than eating other things. So if you take offense, what's really the offense? Anyway, ponder why so many do not want lives to be saved.
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS So you ask what the limits should be? Maybe read the fucking law, it's there, it's online. Anyone can read it. Using the law to get funding for a wall that was already supposed to have been built, and then having libertarians complain about gov. overreach. Eat bags of dicks.
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS Indirectly, the wall will save your life; potentially. I have no idea if you're a real man or woman behind the keyword or bot.
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS Okay fine, I'll bite. Why so many libertarians against a President using the law to fulfill a law? Furthermore, a law used to protect innocent children from rape, murder, human trafficking, slavery, and any number of other pain-points. In directly, if you're an American troll
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS You Sir, are a Dead man. I may read one of your books in the near future, but that is it.
@ShadeSocrates @TwistJared @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS Does a dead man speak? Maybe. But can someone use the law as it's intended, sure.
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS You're under the assumption that a word only has one meaning. That's why some people are successful, while others are not.
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS This is an important part of it: “Emergency” means any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President,
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS “Emergency” means any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety,
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS Then there's of course as follow (will be in new threads)...
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS How many slaves need to be freed before we build the wall? Slaves being the sex slaves, the nannies that you don't know about. The boys that are kept a secret from the public. How many lives lost before it's an emergency?
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS What is the # of deaths? What # can you live with before you feel it's an emergency to build a wall so crime will fall?
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS How many American lives ruined because someone that did not legally and morally belong here?
@terrij68 @justinamash @POTUS The emergency along the southern border, which has really been an emergency for many years. I'm shocked we didn't build back when we defeated Mexico all those years ago. We're a forgiving nation. But how many kids needs to be trafficked? How many lives lost to Drugs?
@realtonysmith @SickofLibPigs @justinamash You're a Mittens fan and thus proven to have bad judgement. I admit, I liked Mittens at first, but He's proven to be a tool of evil.
It's a waste of time to argue with anyone with under 300 followers.
Anyone that doesn't understand why Trump would use the State of Emergency as a way to get money to pay for the wall, has never seen their State Governors call for a State of Emergency in order to gain access to reserve funds. It's done all the time. They scare you for money.
@JeffyNorth @justinamash What are you talking about? That doesn't make any sense. Nobody is dissolving anything. We're going to build a wall so crime will fall.
@kholamon @justinamash @POTUS 29 followers mother fucker. I'm outta here. Bye bye.
@akstonsdiner1 @kholamon @justinamash @POTUS You don't shrink gov. by voting for a guy named Justin that can't accomplish a darn thing. Other than allowing for laws and such that lead to Utah folks getting cancer at a higher rate than other States.
@akstonsdiner1 @kholamon @justinamash @POTUS No bot, that's not at all the current discussion. You shrink gov. by having your congress people do their jobs. You shrink gov. by abolishing local gov. control, then State, then Federal. You do it by achieving things first.
@SickofLibPigs @justinamash 2020 is close by
@kholamon @justinamash @POTUS also just noticed you're a fucking bot.
@SickofLibPigs @justinamash History doesn't have to repeat itself. The Union is too big and powerful for a Civil War to ever be an option. We must push our Congress people to accomplish things in our best interests. That's our patriotic duty.
@SickofLibPigs @justinamash It's in the letters as to why the States left the Union back in the day. It was partially about slavery, but it was also because the Feds weren't protecting the South.
@kholamon @justinamash @POTUS I'm for small gov. but when a law is a law, I'll use it as such. When a congress person is a liar, I'll call that person out. When congress fails to act, and there's a law in place for the POTUS that I actually trust to fix the problems. I'm for it.
Smug Congress people that have failed to get much done in 15 or 20 or whatever, should just quit their jobs and let the young folk have a chance. Congress has wasted money, and allowed for human trafficking and drugs to ruin lives. No more. Please, no more.
@kholamon @justinamash @POTUS My point was that your fear tactic was too stupid to consider serious.
@JustmeZ01 @justinamash @POTUS Based on history, if the President deems it to be an emergency, it then therefore, is an emergency. Because the pain and suffering has reached the point that it qualifies as an emergency. All based on case law.
@legalskolar @justinamash Which law firm in Chicago do you work for?
@legalskolar @justinamash That's exactly how the law works. It's there for the President to call a national emergency so He may have access to funds that can therefore be used on an EXISTING law that was already passed in order to fulfill His duty as President.
@legalskolar @justinamash Face palm yourself all day man. Congress can override. That's how the checks-n-balances are setup. By the way, I've written for lawyers for years, I know for a fact they do not know all the laws, nor do police for that matter.
@JesstersDead @greenpatchgrp @justinamash So stop voting for people that have been in there for more than 2 terms and have not accomplished more than 2% of what they promised.
@vanOpum @justinamash By congress not acting, that would make it an emergency; yes, by definition, it would. Research State gov. and how they handle natural disasters. Research the history of national emergencies. Justin is a dishonest person.
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash He knows franks and beans, and He's dishonest to boot.
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash If corruption exists, why do we honor those that seem to live in it?
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash If corruption exists, why keep voting for the same folks that haven't accomplished as much as Trump has already?
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash If corruption exists, why should we trust career politicians?
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash If corruption exists, why would you want the gov. to distribute the money? Wouldn't it be fair to have the people that earn their money, invest their money as they see fit?
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash If corruption exists, why would you want the gov. to be so big that corruption can exist in the format of using tax payer monies?
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash Corruption was there with Obama. The Democrats are corrupt. They killed their own back in the 60s. You can win against corruption by living a Godly life and being an honest person. That's not to say you can't curse because God is powerful enough to have a profanity filter.
I'm shocked at the "what if" this or that. Live your fucking life man. Even breast cancer is 1% or less. Your breasts will be fine, most of the time. Everyone will die, at some point in their life cycle. Do not live in fear. Live in happiness.
@vanOpum @justinamash Read more of my tweets about this topic. And then kindly leave me alone. I'm going to work.
@kholamon @justinamash @POTUS What happens when aliens come from outer space to rape your asshole? I mean, it's a big asshole and I'm sure they're going to probe it before they probe mine. I'm french so asshole is boohole in American.
@Rothbard_IRA @justinamash @POTUS Missing the point.
@graybushlive @justinamash Missing the point.
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash He's no more important than Pedro at Del Taco. We're all equals. Remember that. You Ma'am. You are just as important as Justin. He might have the power to be a dick about things, but we have the power to vote and the power to expose corruption.
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash I rarely go more than 5 miles over in my car, if you want that as an analogy. In the constitution it says there are no nobles. A congressperson is just another person. Well, He's a servant to the people in his district. Which means, he works for the people in his district.
@greenpatchgrp @justinamash And then? The US right? Free speech, right? Twitter, right? What is your point. He's a moron. A dishonest moron. If I'm breaking a law by calling him a moron, then I do not admit guilt. Only that there are too many laws for any person to follow.
@justinamash If you were an honest man you would tell people congress can override it with majority support. That's what an honest person would have said. But instead you said franks and beans.
@justinamash Anyone liking his tweet is bot of fucking moron. Some random "we live in a constitutional republic" excuse is why libertarians are all fool of shit. That comment has nothing to do at all with what is being discussed. It's the same as a retard saying franks and beans.
@justinamash Hey man, that's why you weren't very good at your job.
@justinamash That is exactly how it works. Something is an emergency once something fails. In this situation, it's Congress failing; and thus, it would then qualify as an emergency. You're trying to bring in another topic that has nothing to do with the declaration of national emergency.
@Lrihendry Ginsberg died. Just waiting on the official confirmation.
@justinamash @POTUS US* militaries.
@justinamash @POTUS You forget that the President (even though it could have been called Manager) is the head-General of all gov. militaries.
@justinamash @POTUS He can because it becomes an emergency once congress is proven to have failed to act. He's giving congress the chance to play their role. They fail, it's the President's obligation and duty as commander-n-chief to protect the people of this beautiful country.
@DailyCaller No, they would not release something that makes them look bad. It was Trump or Roger. Probably Trump because I'm pretty sure Roger is just a goofy tool. The court jester is not the king.
@HouseCracka cuz you'd rather have President Harris?
@HouseCracka The US should use its tools to help the world. But that doesn't imply we should rebuild every fucking nation. That doesn't imply we need to get into every fucking situation. But once in a while, when we see a starving child. We can help if we want to.
@HouseCracka Think of God. He's not micro-managing our daily lives. And He's not an asshole for not directly managing a country's rebuild. He's not an asshole for not helping personally. He gave us the tools and opportunity to do that ourselves. That's Godly. And that is good.
@HouseCracka Bombs, missiles, etc. They go bad after a while. To say we don't have anything on the shelf that is about to expire is ridiculous.
@HouseCracka But don't sit back and let people starve. Simply taking out the leadership will be all the humanity we need to apply. We can provide the opportunity for greatness, we don't have to manage or nurture it.
@HouseCracka Hopefully Trump is a good leader and we do not waste too much time and money. No rebuilding. That's for the UN to handle. Oust Madura and protect our interests. If it's a slight hit on Russia, then all the better.
@HouseCracka Do I want to waste money on it? No. Is it okay to kick someone's ass that doesn't like the US? Sure. Ass-kickings can be quick and swift.
@HouseCracka Do you fix a leak or do you let it get bigger? Venezuala is a leak and it's near our country.
@HouseCracka Venezuelans are ruining every country in south america. They're about to be lynched in many places. They're even coming to the US.
@HouseCracka Trump is attending to the revenue. Hopefully Congress can get a fucking budget balanced.
@HouseCracka We just need to balance budgets, and increase revenues. When the GDP is double what it is now, 20T doesn't seem so bad. It's the same as with personal wealth. When you make more, you can have debt without it causing pain.
@HouseCracka I call bullshit and bullshit on your fake outrage. The debt is the debt and we can only manage it at this point. It's not going to be wiped over night. It's not going to be paid off in the near future.
@HouseCracka @POTUS If you see a starving child, for years. What do you do? You help.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Literally repeat that strategy with your neighbors. Everyone will have money and lives with be saved. You don't have to keep your secrets. Share that within your neighborhood.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed But that's another topic. Literally, beating a dog is protected by the first amendment. All men have dominion over this earth, and the animals thereof. But you were probably talking about something else.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed In 5 years I've done more for you than 70 years of Democrats.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed After a while you can buy property, a little longer another rental property so you have additional income coming in. All along, put money in retirement accounts.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed thank =&gt; than* typos man.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed After 5 years, I've now made you 6 times better thank the national average. You can look at your neighbors now and feel better than them, tell them that you're better than them by 6. Because you are. Feel it.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Year 5: 29k in the bank. That money should be invested in same way. Right? Maybe start a business on the side, a retirement account, etc.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed You have 55k/year coming in. You have 15k in the bank. Year 4 you have 22k (15K + 5k + 2k from spouse). That 2k should probably be more cuz you're sharing expenses.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Maybe ask your spouse to work 5k more per year. Leap frog, etc.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed So now your household income is 50k/year.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Well, no one says you HAVE to have kids right away. That's a choice. Don't be dumb, don't have kids you cannot afford. No one has to pay for your kids. You want wealth. Plan for it.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed So your spouse makes 20k/year
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Make =&gt; Maybe*
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Make get a spouse, or live with roommates to cut costs.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Year 3, 15k
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed I doubled your net worth.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed So let's say now you're making 30k/year. What do you do with that? Well, live as cheaply as possible, save your money. Year one, 5k saved. Year two, 10k total.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Stay with a company, receive scraps. Leap frog, get paid more faster.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Now you're making 30/k, maybe 40/k. What happens if you find a new employer every 2 years where you can see an increase in salary.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Let's say you make 20k/year. What happens if you increase your hours worked? So that you make 30/k or what if you double your hours. You're working 20 hours, now work 40 hours. You're working 38 hours, now work 76 hours.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Let's figure it out. What do you propose other than more welfare? I'm proposing one square a day, delivered by a charity. No more EBT. Just one square of fat enriched food so you don't get hungry until tomorrow.
@CNBC It's putting the monetary value back into honest journalism. Instead of getting the cheapest article out the door, maybe invest in research and validation first.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed I mean, if Republicans dying in a war to free slaves isn't enough, nothing ever will be.

@Adweek @SteveCarell Okay I watched it, I was gonna say, Pepsi has done a lot mo betta ads than Coke over the years. RE: Michael Jackson. But I like this commercial. Even though Coke is better.
@DailyCaller Don't be a such a fucking sexist &amp; masochistic asshole. Point out that "our work" photo only includes Her. What she is wearing should NOT MATTTER!!! She's a human being. Some say Goddess, but on Earth, we call her FLOTUS. BUT WE DO NOT TREAT HER SEXUALLY! You make me sick.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed If you want a bigger penis, or a tigher vagina - vote Republican. You want a better sex life, vote Republican. Look at all the attractive Republicans. Go do a Google. Go lookie at them.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Nothing has changed because the blacks was voting for Democrats for 70 years.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Who's making you type like that. "blacks was the poorest" You gonna call me boss man next? Come on now. A job that pays more is how you get a mo betta life. Asking fa mo welfare just keeps you poor, fat, gives you diabetes, and it shrinks weiners/loosens vaginas.
I just turned off @nbc because it's normalizing kids becoming trannies. Will look into buying software that blocks degenerate channels moving forward.

@TheRebelTV @Cernovich Anyone see the gay porn that Mike did a while back?
@RealSaavedra Lot of hispanics, and really any culture not from the US; They don't really give a fuck. They just want the good for their kids. They'll grow old and die, and they know eventually their kids will lose their original culture; they were fine with that, or they wouldn't come here
@RealSaavedra He doesn't want a little brown baby in his bloodline. That's the same as saying they want their grandkids to look like they came from the family tree. That's a legitimate thing. Also, by not learning the US culture, it's a middle finger to the US. Assimilate, it's normal.
@tombrokaw just pay someone to do this for you.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yeah but free-shit seems to be the thing that left of center want.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Like this: https://t.co/5mQKBUkD3o cc: @realDonaldTrump
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed What is "nothing" to you?
@PlimouthOutWest @JackPosobiec by the way, tom brokaw is from a previous era, and retired from his job that made him. He may still work here and there, but Tommy already made it. Jack is a nobody. Even if OAN ever becomes something, Jack will not be considered a celebrity; ever.
@PlimouthOutWest @JackPosobiec so?
@jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump would be nice to get every cent owed with all the % more we have already paid over the years.
@barmore27 @gatewaypundit She might, you never know.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Asking the world to help black people is kind of funny, when whites are a global minority. I'm really kind of shocked you would say world like that.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed If that's the case, then you're going to set yourself back a bit. No one is going to support that racism. Equality, yes; your racism, no. You think you're being clever but in reality, it's just going to end with nothing and a burger.
@emzanotti If those are now the numbers being thrown around, where did all those people live? I never heard of numbers that high growing up.
@HCTrudo @realDonaldTrump @KamalaHarris what
@gatewaypundit Only so she can raise some funds; she's not seriously going to run. It's a fundraiser.
@KanameGoddess She's dead. This week we'll see the tributes. Pelosi's ego is going to show as she thinks she flushed Trumps face in the toilet.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Your best bet is the side that gives you a job, tries to get it so your job pays more, ends the wars so we can live in a safer place, and works towards cutting your taxes so you can enjoy the money you earn.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed More whites in general in the US. What is your point?
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed A job gives you focus and life purpose, and with that, you can elevate yourself to whatever it is that makes you happy. Money doesn't make anyone happy. It just makes us want more and more shit, and then the come down is misery.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Wanting free money to sit at home on welfare and watch TV is stupid. You lose the skills you need to survive in the world, then you get fat with diabetes. What happens is you spend all your welfare money and you then have to bitch and moan about needing more welfare money.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Pandering to one group of people is racist and bullshit and does not work. But giving people equal opportunity can lift the world up. That's what has worked and will always work.
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed He's not supposed to do anything for blacks specifically because that's a bullshit thing to want and expect. You're not talking equality if you want special favors. At that point, I would stop giving less of a fuck.
@JackPosobiec ....no.
@mrshaheedmalik @tariqnasheed That's in the works. But at the city level, we need to take away the financial incentive. Local police shouldn't be able to use the money they take in from tickets. Asset forfeiture needs to be outlawed for good.
@mitchellvii A judge would block it. Trump would then leak that Pelosi is taking meds that should force her to retire. Schumer would then work with Trump for time being until the Democrats can find a new leader for 2020.
@mitchellvii and his little feet
@Evil3334 @tariqnasheed Trump is offering jobs, better paying jobs, ability to keep more of the money you earn, &amp; he's trying to end as many of the wars as possible. Furthermore, he's trying to keep U safer by enforcing immigration laws &amp; preventing people that have been kicked out from ever returning.
Is he in charge of an army? Other than that, I don't understand how someone can claim they're the leader, and then have it be recognized. Maybe let people vote first? If he was leader of the army that was fighting for freedom, then okay. But he's just a dude on Twitter. https://t.co/1G9XM18sQU

@GOP @KellyannePolls you gotta show people. bring families, and keep bringing the families. show references on how this could have been prevented by the wall. visual, auditory &amp; kinesthetic; anchor and then trigger: build a wall, and crime will fall.

@realDonaldTrump In there show someone from a gang though, like the pimp. Build a wall and crime will fall. Repeat it a lot, yes. Democrats will be hooked because the next time they do coke and get a lap dance, on the come down, they'll get sad, vow to not do that again (until they relapse)
@realDonaldTrump How about a documentary on some strippers that were smuggled in as children through the AZ border. Show them shooting up and then show their f'd up teeth. Then show someone that may or may not be their parent, crying. Build a wall &amp; crime will fall anchored on to everything.
@realDonaldTrump It's a catchy little jingle (build a wall &amp; crime will fall), but it's not touching emotion that will affect Democrat or Independent voters. I don't see this making a dent. You show a video of people crying, in a situation that Democrats can related to, then add the jingle.
@CBSNews @60Minutes He's the guy that tricked millions into paying for over-priced coffee. Exactly what we need in Washington.
.@pink, I only hope you put out more music as to hide the ugliness of your soul. No child deserves to be abused by you.
.@pink, The problem with what u did was that you blamed children for adult problems. You didn't even watch the video, or you weren't smart enough to ask to see a full-video before posting in anger. That just goes to show you may be an easy mark for Hollywood to take advantage of.
.@pink, Being a Keyboard Warrior is how everyday Americans can honor their country. Not everyone has the constitution to go to war. Some fight in the military, others just play their part in society. You're a lip-syncer, that's your job. We like it. You look good halfway naked.

@TsunamiDaisy @justinamash weight*
@TsunamiDaisy @justinamash Use the Charity system. Take the Gov. out of it. No more food stamps. Gov. should send the money directly to charities if we are forced to have welfare. One square a day. Google Keto diet. When I was on it, one meal was plenty. I lost wait, felt better. Being fat is a big problem
@TsunamiDaisy @justinamash But I am a little frustrated in people like Ted Cruz, Ron Paul (Even Rand now) because they're all talk - no accomplishments. Same with Marco. Why can't they go into office and get things done for the better? Money doesn't buy happiness. Having the Gov. fund poor doesn't work.
@TsunamiDaisy @justinamash I can't remember why I dislike Justin. I forget what it was about. Probably because He's anti-Trump. I think Republican politicians need to work together to get things done for the better of America. I can never be a Democrat because of the killings of pre-born babies.

@StefanMolyneux @benshapiro The big businesses need an increase in population to reach their numbers. So either Americans have more kids, or we have to allow immigration to happen. Same with any other country that has an actual economy.

@LouisFarrakhan To be a servant, does not mean to be stupid. You can still be a leader, and help the poor. You can still help the poor, and not give away your nest egg. You can still help the poor by making the poor help themselves. Teach a man to fish, not die fishing for the man.
Happy Birthday Betty White you sexy thang!
You can't win any moral arguments when your political party was born to slaughter Indians and pro-long slavery, and because all that's illegal nowadays, you decided to kill pre-born babies. Democrats lose on the issues because they have a foundation inspired by Satan.

@ndrew_lawrence Then you click on a reference, and most of them say there hasn't been an actual study. Therefore, this is some bullshit.
@ndrew_lawrence And where are the studies that back up this claim? The CDC has studied this when? You go to the CDC website, they list references, but not a study that they conducted. https://t.co/NFU8D3jV5X
@DPRK_News Interesting take. Where's the one with the worm blowing Mrs. Supreme Leader.
@JohnStossel These things are important, otherwise, we're just animals on this planet. Trump seems like the kind of kind that believes traditions to be important. But who knows, maybe he has too much going on to fight this particular battle. I only hope he outsmarts the Democrats.
I'm pretty sure the State of the Union can happen without the permission of congress. If they do not attend, well, that's their problem.
@NewPatriotMan @DailyCaller so he paid for one poll? did that poll win the election? proof cohen did that by orders or on his own? Is it not a bribe when you donate a bunch of money to a campaign, just to have those politicians give you 500 million? Just asking for PP, PBS, and other businesses doing it.

Another thing about LeBron, with all the super teams He put himself on; He could only win at most 50% of the titles. That proves Bron's style of play isn't what wins championships. Jordan would have won 9 championships had personal things not happened to him. But 6 is still good.
It could also be a call for help (Kyrie), so I hope everything is okay. There's nothing wrong with a guy switching teams like that, in real life, you jump companies so you can increase pay and title. Perfectly okay. Why should a guy be stuck in Bron's shadow?
@dmartosko Yeah because the polls were rigged in Trump's favor. Obviously a true story.

@DRUDGE_REPORT that stupid bitch. i thought she was doing it to me because I turned the old roku on, just for old times sake. now i know she has a bigger problem. I just hope it's not feminism.
@Imamofpeace to say this wasn't part of a cia program would be kind of weird.
@jillpoll @GovRonDeSantis @Cernovich opinions we all have in life. either way, a gov. should focus on his beautiful State.
@chuckwoolery he must own stock in a company that does that
@brielarson @autumndewilde i guess you must be famous or something
@piersmorgan something is, you replied to a bot with 1 follower.
@kristilade @GovRonDeSantis your face.
@kristilade @GovRonDeSantis your face.
@Applebees will do, thank you
@Briefing__Room @RodStryker next time bring a male without soy, she will stop on a dime.
@kristilade @GovRonDeSantis it's not and this is a stupid convo. to be in. da fuck is wrong with bots these days.
P&amp;G has just learned how you kill a brand (re: Gillette). I know pg always had stupid rules and people working for them, but come on now.
@mariakay73 @AOC where does it say she's from the bronx? she's that drug girl from boylston st.
@Applebees where is there an actual applebees?
@jimmyfallon TELL all the people of congress, it's cool that they're not trying to fix shit.
@jackmurphylive Trump gave us Trump. No one else gets credit for that. Trump planned his Presidency for years.
@RealSaavedra well, you don't start with dick pics bro
@JG33477 @kristilade @GovRonDeSantis we'll find out how he handles a hurricane. Rick do a great job. rick will be missed.
@DuckDuckGo i'm happy. but do not really on long pages of 2000 words to rank keywords. i shouldn't have to read through a bunch of shit just to find what i want. there has got to be a better way.
@maribburns @charliekirk11 i'm sure i can, what exactly is your point? america did some bad shit to iraq, and then? we talking assad or putin? hurry up and explain as I'm not googling your bullshit.
@JG33477 @kristilade @GovRonDeSantis he's not doing shit with the gas prices. stop being a fool. he just showed he's a puppet. i'm pissed now.
@RedLatinosUSA @hrtablaze she has a bunch of dykes and soy boys that want to bang her. stop it. she isn't doing anything
@charliekirk11 and what does it matter if putin, a free person and leader of a country; why does it matter what his country does with any pipeline? it's not feedom if you do not understand that everyone deserves it, whether American or any other person of any other nation.
@charliekirk11 this is where you should learn about the wants of the people. they loved putin, mostly russian; there are nazis ove r there that were causing problems. putin is a well-liked leader. Assad didn't cross a line, as he didn't agree to anything, and no real proof he gassed anyone.
@foxnewsradio I sure hope their gov. can handle this, and not OURS.
@GAIGroup it's bullshit because people are retiring with too much money. what you trying to sell. oh...
You run for Gov. of any State in the Union. You are for THAT State, and not any other Country. To me, that is treason. You run for Florida Gov., you are not beholden to any other country or religion. cc: @RonDeSantisFL @SenRickScott
@FrankJo08063772 @GovRonDeSantis @Cernovich i'm a little upset. I'm glad the gay man cerno was able to retweet this. The gov. is for Florida. Not any other nation. That's an entirely different role and job.
RT @FrankJo08063772: @GovRonDeSantis @Cernovich I thought it was a free market, start focusing on the needs of Florida and not Isreal, you’…
@GovRonDeSantis @jewishboca You are the gov. of Florida, any international relations are Federal. Your job is to keep Florida running great. This is bullshit and you need to snap out of whatever bullshit "talk" you just had by whatever bullshit donors. Florida is a State. Handle the State business.
@kristilade @GovRonDeSantis he didn't do shit
@GovRonDeSantis You are the gov. of Florida. Anything international is for the federal level.
@GovRonDeSantis @Cernovich stop being a pawn man. If they have a belief, let them have a belief. It's the same with anything. But what you do is present your belief or push for another belief that is better. Do not become the bad guy.
@COHummingbird @kurteichenwald THINGS ARE GOOD, He is Your President, bot.
@adamscrabble @Cernovich phrasing.
@realDonaldTrump @KazmierskiR it's not like she's wealthy and do without, oh wait, she can do without. soo.....
retweet https://t.co/2jwFrJoqFV
Even thought these guys have lost their frog, they still get it. https://t.co/8oI3o5vjea
@Roku I replaced my roku, I can teach ya'll about how to turn your dinky old computers into a form of roku. There is no need to help these businesses that fucking hate you. I will not do anything right now cuz my gf is watching me type.
@tomspano @DanCrenshawTX yes
@WattersWorld @JesseBWatters @FoxNews why not just stay on twitter?
I sure hope Gillette takes on the abortion issue next.
@CitiMutts @AJDelgado13 because men are tired of being labeled rapists until proven otherwise.
@bryanborda @EarlKnot @broke3121 @yesnicksearcy He was dime a dozen.
@TheDemCoalition you guys are a bunch of dicks.
@Winter and you still haven't hit puberty?
@DrMartyFox not everyone wants insurance, as most won't really use it until they are in their 40s. not everyone catches an std.
@EarlKnot @broke3121 @yesnicksearcy Well now I'm just wondering what happened to Hetty. Also, that's a website that can order things as it sees fit, doesn't mean Nicky was important to the show, as I watched the show, loved the show, and Nicky was of small importance.
@tomspano @DanCrenshawTX Big Dan paid for it, Tommy. My joke has already been ruined though so let's just move onto the next joke.
@JackPosobiec jake tapper is gay so that's not an issue; montel williams is dying; that's why. not justified, but that's why.
@Cernovich he's not smart enough to do anything, and lots of people like Farrakhan now.
@KamalaHarris what i learned long ago is that money doesn't matter as to happiness. we can eat a lot or nothing, we still the same happy. why give anything at that point? no one cares, always need more.
@GKeile @Hollyhoo71 well. that's nasty.
@genesimmons @YouTube you lost creds. when you were with jt foxx.
@kimguilfoyle @Hollyhoo71 @DailyCaller and how did you achieve this?
@MarkYoungTruth he's the son of a made-man and he's just making deals until he's safe, then he goes back to being loyal to trump.
@TheSlyStallone i would like to see you two in a movie, not at all like escape plan 2 as I turned that shit the fuck off in 2 seconds; but i would like to see you do a real movie again with carl
@stranahan he's never been to a designated shitty area
@McAllisterDen @SebGorka because at the end of the day, men are just happy to call that lady their lady. if we need to take some abuse to help others, we gladly take the abuse.
@DailyCaller had no idea he was still alive
@JamesHasson20 @RobProvince or they have @ubereats and mcdonalds has been taken care of
@rashadrobinson fire them all. police should have limits on when they can use force. it's 2019.
@DailyCaller they'd be a bunch of assholes if they didn't
@QuincyLovesBBWS @tariqnasheed @CamfromtheBayou she probably is
@StefanMolyneux although you aren't a pure breed, you make solid points. But we could potentially balance the budget if we just let all the people quit gov. over this shut down.
@jihadwatchRS we haven't met yet.
@NarinderSingh to think the gov that produced hillary clinton and joe biden was actually inspecting food, come on.
@AOC eewwww. phrasing.
@tomspano @DanCrenshawTX that tweet was sponsored. you don't brag about below average.
@tariqnasheed great balls of fire.
@egirlstrangler @sawmilltaters eat a bag of dicks bro.
@DailyCaller you do know that's bullshit
@ImBlackISAYSO2 @tariqnasheed I have a skillset that I have acquired over a long career, which makes me very dangerous to you. I will find out what that means. I will find out. When I do, I will tweet you.
@Alt_NASA slick willy was once as well, point?
@maddengine @Alt_NASA solid point
@ActualEPAFacts trump is a billionaire, has banged many porn stars, and is married to a goddess. you ain't trump sista. cc: @realDonaldTrump
@EricHolthaus @Alt_NASA @jeffgoodell bullshit, you said we'd be underwater by now.
@ArthurSchwartz @JackPosobiec she got aids from rent so they all good sista
@ImBlackISAYSO2 @tariqnasheed no i'm being serious. translate the shit so i know what you is talking about boss man.
@LeftistsH8Good @RAMRANTS literally if you had something you could show it mister bot
oh shit, Trump doesn't want the gov. to open back up because this gives us the ability to cut all the nonsense out of the budget.
@thebradfordfile @AgentSoulful007 she sucks a mean dick
@tariqnasheed can you translate to white man?
@theblaze @CR derp, and you wonder why little man wanted to buy you out
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump the dick-pic guy has a point
@mdrache yup
@McCainInstitute being a traitor doesn't make the big bucks.
@tribelaw @AltUS_ARC yes, russia is making america extremely wealthy again. that was their plan all along!!
@tomspano @DanCrenshawTX you turned this shit into an ad? dude. you don't broadcast 6.3 inches.
@chuckwoolery @ChristieC733 what a stupid bitch
@thebradfordfile so you eat big mac every night?
@MMFlint this fat dude @seanhannity
@seanhannity @JaySekulow i remember when that fat dude spoke at a school and then you said you'd go, your bill was pretty much what the fat dude asked for. i hated you for years. it's been a long time now and you haven't gotten a fucking thing done other than go gray and look old. get shit done or quit.
@SteveKingIA try being a little bit of a leader, get smart people to help you look better; Trump does it, you should too; everyone does it!
@SteveKingIA dude hire an assistant
@JoeFreedomLove @mitchellvii problem is?
@thebradfordfile @Gillette just don't shave man, be a hairy
@broke3121 @yesnicksearcy justified legit had one of the best tv show endings, it was realllly good.
@broke3121 @yesnicksearcy he was barely on justified
@LeftistsH8Good @RAMRANTS nobody has ever been able to truly show him being an anti-semite, which, i couldn't care about because i'm all about equally offending everybody.
@Thomas1774Paine she dead
@LeftistsH8Good @RAMRANTS show a video of that and maybe i'll study the context and translate for you. from what I've seen, he stands up for his people, and that's what you want in a leader. With Cosby in jail, some people may need a strong leader to help guide them. Who has Louis genocide'd?
@PrisonPlanet I don't get it. why are they selling estrogen to straight men?
@WhiteHouse @Trump_World it's not the heroin, it's the lack of doctor prescribing what people feel they need. we shouldn't stop people from healing. who are we to judge the pain someone else feels?
@RAMRANTS show video, i watched some things that daily wire provided, but i didn't see anything other than a guy standing up for the people that look up to him. i think i follow him on one of my other personalities. but i think overall he's a good guy.
@DrOz why talk to him? if someone wants to cut him in jail or prison, i would suggest that God would be fine with that.
@willchamberlain that's not how it works sista
@DRUDGE_REPORT should have gave him the handy
@RAMRANTS Louis isn't the man he once was, as he's been replaced; but who didn't already know that.
@historylvrsclub @USABookClub is that before or after he saved the indians by placing them on reservations?
@jeffjarvis yes, a billionaire eats mcdonalds on the reg.
@JoeFreedomLove everyone knows he like penis.
@pluralsight how about we make them make us faster?
@imogensound @BreitbartNews younger but i get where you're going with this.
@Thomas1774Paine i'm shocked so many still read nyt
@DennisDMZ or you can suck major dicks and a bag of balls.
@AntifaMidwest well, they know what parts are shaved and all, so I guess they could know a little bit about that
@BreitbartNews i'll tell his sister he's a cock sucker.
@Rambobiggs she's dead and they all know it
@marklevinshow Brother Joseph says that Mitten's soul will burn in hell. Read  History of the church where it references Mitt Romney from 1842.
@CNN how do we really know it's "chocolate"
@canna_mr @AaronBroadley @wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump So you're essentially the same difference as a Putin bot because you're trying to influence American elections. It's not your country, so your opinions matter not.
It's Trump's fault the gov. spent all the money?
@canna_mr @AaronBroadley @wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump He's not your President, so what the hell should you care?
Good advice, and I would add; do not back down to bad people; have compassion, but defeat your enemies and create your world, the way you believe it should be. Then, when you have succeeded, make sure to help others, as the Lama has suggested here. https://t.co/ea3RPf8Hwe
@kashthefuturist fuck no
RT @charliekirk11: It is a national disgrace our FBI investigated PRESIDENT Trump for being a “Russian agent” while refusing to investigate…
@maggieNYT I would also argue that no one really knows who the hell jeff bozo is because amazon is so frictionless; we do not associate jeff bozo with that wonderful business. which is a good thing, jeffy can bang all the hookers he wants and it shouldn't affect sales.
It sucks that Chris Pratt is only marrying @KSchwarzenegger to be closer to Arnold.
@GovHowardDean because they call one little girl ignorant, all young voters are ignorant? You sound very racist saying that. Virginia has seen some growth, from other liberal areas; doesn't surprise much, as democrats are leaving the shit holes they've built.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell So to answer your question, I read all that from the Bible, just not the Bible that you believe in.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell God gave Glenn Beck a great voice, and many talents; he gave us Hillary Clinton just the same (but talentless), and @AOC (dancing powers). We all pray and get what we demand of the world. God isn't out there choosing sides. As you look in the sky, you see many stars.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell God also gave us prayer and the ability to shape our worlds. As Trump uses the power of positive thinking to achieve his dreams; he has shaped the world to fit his needs, as God as given this power to all Men &amp; Women.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell But anyway, God gave you the gifts that you have, sure, as he created all. But He wants you to choose your path. He wants you to fight for what is right. He does not want everyone to be Monks.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell Alright, God exists, but I think he has issues getting into our realm, as even the Mormon church needs many apostles to be able to truly translate the word of god; even though they have a prophet, seer and revelator. And Brother Young says that mixing races would damn your soul.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell That's narcissistic and gross, I don't want him watching me in the shower. But I would argue, and because I created my own religion; I believe God exists, and he has powers, although limited in scope, as Jesus wasn't able to prevent his own death.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell I will believe that the Bible is a historical record of some sort, with lots of flaws, and thus, I do not believe the bible to be word of god. Again, look to the stars, to think we're the only Earth God created. Who can manage all that, and know each one of us intensely.
@namerankssn @BillyHallowell I'm glad you ask. As you probably already know, most gov's are corrupt, the US, Russia, UK, wherever. Almost always corrupt. Churches tend be just the same, as there are pedo Priests all over the Earth. Mormons/Muslims with their child-wives. All corrupt.
@SpaceX when do we get to see the aliens
@NathanWurtzel @GayPatriot @HotlineJosh she's just flirting
@GayPatriot why does that require a sheriff
@RT_com to add insult injury, they raised the price of lotion.
@MDJohnson22 @AOC da  fuck
@JackPosobiec instacart works pretty well
@realDonaldTrump not really taken down as most do not associate that guy with any of his businesses. he's very forgettable and unimportant
@JackPosobiec that is silly and supports stupid people financially. you don't have to read their books when there's the internet and of course blog posts and tweets with their opinions and beliefs.
@hrtablaze why has she not been deported? what's keeping her here and on gov assistance?
@BillyHallowell and i can understand that is your belief. but i believe in something else.
@BillyHallowell why not find your own purpose. god doesn't want anything specific for you or of you. look at the sky, god has a lot to manage. to think we're that much of a concern is selfish.
@restartleader @RodStryker @realDonaldTrump da fuck kind of meds are you on?
@JoyceWhiteVance then what did obama do that was tough?
Please don't... https://t.co/iNabSzzei6
@KurtSchlichter try not to shit your pants though, that would be weird.
@RealCandaceO @AOC she took a risk, which is an american thing. nowadays, people are broke most of the time.
@realDonaldTrump no phone? abraham lincoln let people sleep on the white house lawn. he was a tough dude.
@DienamiteRedder @QuincyLovesBBWS so true
@BruceTheGay unless it's Thursday, then that's allowed.
@GHawk30769721 @Southfive @RJBrodsky dude, she's not that ugly. come on now.
@greyhounddogs @MichaelAvenatti maybe you ugly.
@mitchellvii that's the same stuff in every sales book.
@wolfblitzer awe, it makes sense now. you're on alz. meds.
@MichaelAvenatti Let them walk. I'm happy to no longer have someone touching my ballsack when I travel.

Dear Democrats: Walls work and you're a bad person for promoting human trafficking and other sick shit that you Democrats do.
@zenhighwayman @getjeffrey @RandyRRQuaid and then, you know what, all the powers that be tend to die off and we get stuck with young folk that haven't seen the crazy and we get a 5th chance to do movies again. life is funny like that.
@zenhighwayman @getjeffrey @RandyRRQuaid i'm not saying he should be the producer. you start off with a role here, you do a role there, then we realize you're doing movies again. Then, you know what, the crazy isn't as big a deal because we like having you in movies again.
@e_w_green______ @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency you do not realize human trafficking is morally wrong? forcing people to vote democrat or else they lose their lifeline is morally wrong, you do know this right? you are a bad fucking person.
@e_w_green______ @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency again, democrats started out slaughtering indians, were the party of slavery, and still are the party of slavery. Republicans have been fighting for liberty since the start.
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency You're answering the test question with the wrong answer, and you're too stupid to know what ye doth not know.
@tariqnasheed well, he knocked her out like mike tyson would have back in the day. but if you're surrounded by a mob of white woman, the end result would be the same i would assume.
@Sled_Dog1310 i bet you wake up in the AM and rub lotion on all your twitter bots.
It's interesting to see that #WallsWork https://t.co/cYsdE7svWC
@ComfortablySmug are we sure the beard isn't its own person?
If immigration was a human right, and so important for America, then why did Obama end the dry-foot policy for Cubans? Because the studies showed that Cubans were voting Republican.
okay ribbon makes more sense. but it'll be huuuuge.
The wall is already being built, when we blink in the the near future, Trump will have a big giant scissor and he'll cut some big gigantic bow. Democrats will cry as they will have to find new slaves, again.
@Sled_Dog1310 @AltNatSecAgency it's a bullshit answer. i don't care about some bullshit stat about a border town. people don't rob banks and sit in the fucking parking lot. they leave the scene. same thing with illegals. which you know what, i don't care man. the wall is being built.
@Sled_Dog1310 a democrat that is scared of the gov spending money and hiring federal workers indefinitely should scare everyone.
@RandyResist i call bullshit.
@EvansBeard @AltNatSecAgency you are on twitter, and thus, you are a beard, and thus, walls work.
@SarahBHoll pretty sure fucking your mother would be illegal
@Glenofthe @AltNatSecAgency and then.
yawn. walls work. it's being built. let's chat next year when the ribbon cutting begins.
@e_w_green______ @Luckydragon84 @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency and then
@e_w_green______ @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency and then
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency let's just give up. you have nothing as you want illegals and you're pointing the finger at trump as to validate nothing because it's hearsay
@Luckydragon84 @NYYfan10082005 @e_w_green______ @AltNatSecAgency and then
@NYYfan10082005 @rush_fanatic @AltNatSecAgency no don't send a picture, you're into some sick stuff and i don't want that. please, let's just move on.
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency are you suggesting democrats want illegals in here to not hire illegals?
@NYYfan10082005 @e_w_green______ @AltNatSecAgency no just watch youtube more and then you'll know what i'm doing
@NYYfan10082005 @rush_fanatic @AltNatSecAgency AND THEN
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency okay i can make shit up too but what's the point
@e_w_green______ i am correct in my statement.
@e_w_green______ @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency and then
@rush_fanatic @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency and then
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency encouraging people to work as opposed to being on welfare with requirement of voting democrat or lose your lifeline? that's slavery. importing illegal immigrants is modern-slavery. republicans have been consistent and are always on the side of life and liberty.
@AltNatSecAgency i guess you don't know your history. it would be good to learn, as we do not want democrats repeating it.
@JesseGiesbrecht @AltNatSecAgency i've moved onto shit talking celebrities. when a fence is now a wall, and areas that were not a wall are now a wall, then i would have to admit that a wall is being built. by the way, obama and hillary already approved of what is being built. long ago.
@KingJames did he help you win a ring?
@EvansBeard @AltNatSecAgency yes because chris evans' beard became a billionaire. nutjobs and russia earn a mute
@NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency again, democrats started out slaughtering indians, and are the party of slavery. i could care less about your bigoted opinion.
@AnnCoulter yeah but you don't control the white house, so what value does the book have in regards to controlling the white house
@JesseGiesbrecht @AltNatSecAgency if a fence is now considered a wall, and it's taller, and it's been built during trump's tenure, then i would have to admit that the wall is being built.
@HellingDon @NerdPyle @Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency it's already being built. communists suck in general anyway. and his math is off. but if 5,000 only escaped, well then. that's not bad at all. also, people could sneak out via the roads. but let's not over complicated the bs
to think that a wall doesn't work is pretty insane when nancy has one, the vatican has one, our houses have walls, castles, most homes in south america have walls with broken glass on top. i mean, walls work.
if you gotta correct grammar to feel good, your life sucks, and you are probably boring.
@Mythsas @AltNatSecAgency and then
@Four4s1 @AltNatSecAgency and then
@rush_fanatic @Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency and then?
@Paperikascards @AltNatSecAgency what in the actual hell is going on with kids today
@NerdPyle @HellingDon @Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency and that is bullshit
@AltNatSecAgency i already rated that as bullshit
@NerdPyle @AZ_TNO @AltNatSecAgency areas with more guns have lower crime, areas like chicago with gun control and democrats in charge, have crime problems. we had canons back in the day, and the founders said that was okay, so i'm all for guns.
@Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency tests are usually...tests. so what is your point exactly?
@AltNatSecAgency defend what? you're stupid stats about low crime along the border? because illegals sit at the border waiting to be caught right? come on sista
@AltNatSecAgency it's already too late ma'am https://t.co/n4ylFHXSqq
@Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency it's not fixing everything. we'll still have to deal with short bus democrats for another 50 years.
@Karst97Redtail @NerdPyle @AltNatSecAgency he lied.
@AltNatSecAgency one thing you need to learn about trump is that he does things as a distraction. the wall is already being built. eventually, we'll just hear about the completion ceremony. https://t.co/n4ylFHXSqq
@Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency just google jim acosta and he'll tell ya'll
@Luckydragon84 @AltNatSecAgency what are you not understanding about how walls have been proven to work for centuries? what part of how walls work well, do you need explained? the debate was settled, walls work.
@Karst97Redtail @NerdPyle @AltNatSecAgency it lied about its stats; no response needed.
@NerdPyle @AZ_TNO @AltNatSecAgency okay short bus why don't we just lock ourselves up and stay inside forever?
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency There is no topic. We're done here. Until the next time.
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency I stand by my words, as they do not imply your actual gender, and merely only reference behaviors that you seem to exhibit loudly.
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency alright i need to go take a poo because this is pointless. walls work, ask Nancy about its wall.
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency Don't you dare try and label they anything. Missy has no gender as we are in a non-binary world. Who are you to say what they want to be known as? You can't judge people like that, that's not the world we live in, anymore.
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency as long as they follow the law, yes they have the right, it's in the constitution, so why would it not be justified when they follow the law?
@dangerdaveball @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency don't get cute with me missy
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency are you stupid enough to buy land along the border? as long as they are following the law, i have no opinion other than butterflies are gross to begin with.
@dangerdaveball @NYYfan10082005 @AltNatSecAgency don't be a little girl. it's twitter and late. focus on things that matter and maybe next time you can win a reality tv show.
@jwhite2533 @NerdPyle @AltNatSecAgency there are homes in south america with big walls and broken glass on top. Why? Because walls keep people out. Even european homes have big walls. castles have walls. how stupid do we have to make this for you to understand?
@NYYfan10082005 @dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency i'm shocked at how stupid this is. the wall prevents the guy that was kicked out 10 times. kicked out and not charged because he was deported. or do you not understand the issue.
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency it's a fact that democrats do not care about spending other peoples money. build the wall and all the money that is sent over sees stays in the US economy for democrats to waste on pet projects that do nothing.
@NerdPyle @AltNatSecAgency i'm not responding to this short bus nonsense.
@AltNatSecAgency we don't have a wall so what stat do you want me to show? put up the wall, i'll show you stats. or you can ask any country with a wall. All illegal immigrants are criminals by default. No stat needed. And it's stupid to present a stat about crime at the border.
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency a democrat concerned about money is a total joke. this isn't going anywhere as you're full of shit. what's american? slaughtering indians? slavery? locking everyone up in prison? come on now. build the wall, save 100s of billions of dollars in wasted money.
@chuckwoolery @MarkYoungTruth or he can use the shut down to start closing down branches of gov. that are proven to be wasteful. we've functioned pretty well during the shutdown.
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency i mean it's on twitter so you can try and be cute all you want. it doesn't matter to me. it doesn't change the need for a wall. it does make me wonder why so many are against a wall that would save lives and your health insurance costs, but hey, let's not get too fancy here
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency again, using a bullshit stat to prove a pointless point is bullshit
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency furthermore, immigrants and illegal immigrants cannot and should not be lumped into the same stat. that's dishonest and shows how small your manhood or large your women hood is.
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency as to say immigrants break the law less than americans, that's dishonest, considering ALL illegal immigrants are breaking multiple laws when they illegally enter the US
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency the wall is there to prevent people that have been kicked out multiple times that end up killing americans. it's also there to stop drugs and other illegal aliens from crossing.
@dangerdaveball @AltNatSecAgency which stat do you want me to prove or disprove? to think people cross the border just to sit in a border town and break the law. i mean come on. that's retarded. and that's not even the reason for the wall.
@AltNatSecAgency not from you that's for damn sure. walls work. the wall is being built. democrats won't be able to import new voters, and the slavery party will finally fade away from existence.
@k_jean_w @AltNatSecAgency you get a bot to talk to yourself i see
@MichaelAvenatti missed a word in there but point being we may find out we do not need such a large federal gov. when we have state gov. to handle most things
@MichaelAvenatti you do realize we'd just go back to how it was before 911 then right? once we realize we do not even that much federal gov. and that things are easier without, massive layoffs within the fed.
@AltNatSecAgency so you bring up a bullshit stat, and then you make up another bullshit stat. that's how democrats live i guess
@AltNatSecAgency you do realize people cross the border and go elsewhere right?
@OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @POTUS @realDonaldTrump of course they can dig a tunnel over night right? We can scan deep enough to catch the tunnels; it's not an issue, we would wait until the day of first-use, then shut it all down.
@SenFeinstein how many of the 50% are able to come back multiple times with visas?

@getjeffrey @PatriotGirl1962 @RandyRRQuaid I know it's like the N word but not at all and nobody really should be offended, unless they're fat asses that should listen because being fat is the number cause of death in the States.
Someone needs to explain to me why the forks are always gone, but plenty of spoons (even though I'm a huge fan of ice cream and cereal).
@getjeffrey @PatriotGirl1962 @RandyRRQuaid You should cry so Randy can drink your tears and film it as part of his next movie that he's going to do now that I've asked nicely about it. At a certain point you put the fork down, get off your ass, and you make funny damn movie so that people like me can fucking watch it.
@LolaLee31099045 @WattersWorld @RonPaul Trump actually won, and thus, Trump knows how to become President; he's done it. Ron Paul was just controlled opposition with no real intention of solving anything. He was just there because he was playing part. I like people that get things done. Ron Paul &amp; his son are frauds.
@Comey considering trump had the balls to fire you, and not much happened in retribution... other presidents were too scared to fire the head of the fbi. really makes me wonder if trump even banged those porn stars.
@WattersWorld @RonPaul he's weak and doesn't know how to become president, nor did he accomplish much in her 30 years. Next.
@CassandraRules but can she cook and do laundry?
@Modernize well shit, i just said roof and now i get this ad that i'm not going to click through to
@getjeffrey @PatriotGirl1962 @RandyRRQuaid oh shit, i thought being in a movie would get someone paid, and that most of the time cops will only arrest you for warrants if you get pull over from a traffic violation. i guess i need to relearn how the world works.
@getjeffrey @RandyRRQuaid mel gibson.
@Data4BlackLives #1 it won't do that because you get charged on the second false alarm. Even if Amazon can do that, it won't do that, and no one will let it do that. Cities regulate alarm systems. I can't even fix my roof without a permit. Fake outrage.

@GHHilliard @kurteichenwald you have a small penis or a loose vagina; either or. but i won't make fun of you for any of that. but what i will say is that your tweet is that of a person with a small penis or loose vagina. just reported the news here with my free speech and all in an honest and civil tone.
@nowthisnews it would not destroy anything. question yourself on why you have property splitting the border that was built in 2003; what was there prior, ask questions
@KaitMarieox @QuincyLovesBBWS some people love cats more than humans, some people are fucking crazy. but then again, these people are liars and cannot be trusted

@getjeffrey @RandyRRQuaid movies can be made in any country maam.
@Thomas1774Paine she's probably dead and they're waiting until they can figure out how to handle it so trump doesn't get another justice under his belt
@RandyRRQuaid can you do movies again? i remember watching you and the other quaid in a movie back in the day. so good. i miss your movies mister.
@FreedomWorks @RepDavid does it matter? if he can't get anything done, he's just as bad as every democrat nazi. we need people that get things done, even if they bang porn stars once or twice.
@KevinMPMcNamara @Cat15132 @NTrumplican @missjedahdyah @DMV_Makoto @yesnicksearcy @Geraldsnell11 @RepDanCrenshaw @SteveScalise yes, we need more gun control. by that i mean, more guns in the hands of good people. we also need to fix our health care system that democrats fucked up badly. i shouldn't have to get a new doctor every year; it's sad
@peaceplay @Look4English @kurteichenwald and how is he a russian asset? banging porn stars does not imply super spy
@GHHilliard @kurteichenwald another 5 years, whenever his second term ends.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump you get mad at him for banging porn stars, and mad at him for being a good project manager? sad

@gagadaily drugs are bad
@scarm73 @RedHotFuzz @MittRomney Nobody saw the actual plates in real life. That is the point. Dreams don't called. Being on drugs doesn't count.
@scarm73 @RedHotFuzz @MittRomney Plain and simple, 2 of those 3 did not actually see the plates. 2 of 3 "books" that were translated by Jo Smith were trash. Oliver switch religions multiple times. He also was kicked out of the church for calling Jo out for adultery.
@scarm73 @RedHotFuzz @MittRomney My point being they didn't actually see the plates, in real life. And of course Wikipedia is within range of accuracy as the encyclopedia Britannica, which is why we don't have those books anymore.
@RedHotFuzz @MittRomney Here, this will help: https://t.co/1QCMhffjrK or I can just get the south park episode so you can see for yourself. There are plenty of church images available that say something else, of which, at this point, the church is committing fraud.

@scarm73 @RedHotFuzz @MittRomney 2 of the 3 later said they did not see the plates with their eyes, but with their spiritual eyes. All 3 of those people later left the church. If they really believed, they wouldn't have switched religions so many times.
@RedHotFuzz @MittRomney The fact is, for a long time, the momon church told one thing, and now because of the internet, they starting to release things that prove the church lied and covered things up for years and years.
@RedHotFuzz @MittRomney If I was alive back then, I have no idea what I would believe. However, the seer stones was something I learned about from South Park, only to have the church finally reveal that truth officially.
@RedHotFuzz @MittRomney The seer stones were not the urim and thummim, that was taken away. Good ole Jo Smith put his rock in his hat and "translated" the golden plates (of which, no one saw in real life).
@MittRomney How does one deal with the revelation of Jo Smith using a seer stone, 2 proven false translations, and cheating on his wife with 15 year olds (only to later be falsified as marriages)?

@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince That being said, I still believe there should be a time limit. If 5 years isn't enough, what time limit is? Why should someone be destroyed 50 years later?
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince I don't have a vagina so I haven't been raped. My ass has been grabbed a few times but that's because I'm a good looking guy, and women can't be trusted around good looking men; they turn into animals. 		But I don't have any idea what it's like to be raped, or groped.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince The law I wrote will protect everyone. You don't get to slander someone 50 years later. If something happened, you have plenty of time to come forward.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince I'd be dead if they wait 50 years.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince I do not believe them. It's easy. Just realize woman can be shitty people.
@prosediva @Cernovich That doesn't prove anything of anything.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince Once blood is in the water, any number of sharks will come out.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince If that was true, there would be a subtle hint at it in a newspaper. Like a small joke about how he likes teenagers. Moore has been in public eye for years.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince If it was acceptable to party with pills in the 60s/70s, then that's how you judge them. Not based on today's standards.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince Cosby is a huge target. I don't doubt he gave people pills in the 60s/70s; I believe is was consensual. He didn't do anything with bad intentions. Other than getting some. He even talked about it. 		I also believe we should judge people based on the laws and beliefs at the time.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince There's a video, and you're right, he could hate it step mom.		Weintsein was well known for groping/raping women. It's Hollywood's fault for protecting him.		I do NoT believe the Cosby accusations. He's not going to live much longer, people smelled blood. Cosby has a lot of money
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince Making a law that protects Due Process is not messed up. It's like letting people have guns to stay a free person. Guns can kill, but they're used millions of times a year to protect Americans.
Blake Shelton being "Sexiest Man Alive" hints that alcohol and drugs may be a problem in our society. I mean, Blake Shelton? You crazy.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince There's no way to prove that friends and family knew anything. As no mention of this ever. The Left has wanted to destroy Moore for years. They finally found something to stick. Maybe they're trying to cover for Biden or something. Or maybe it leaks that Obama is a pedo.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince That's why the kid posted a video saying his step mom is a liar?
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince If it's ever discovered that someone with money funded these woman, that person should be sued.		But not a lot of people have the guts to fight for their rights. Moore has a right to damages. His reputation is being destroyed, and he may never hold public office again.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince There's no evidence other than he said / she said. Even if true at this point, Moore can sue for damages. If Moore can never hold public office again, he's entitled to millions in damages because of lost wages and fame, maybe even a broken marriage.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince They had 40 years, and not only that, Moore has been in the public eye. They could have destroyed him years ago when he made the national eye.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince What takes longer than 5 years? Your memory changes, after 5 years, it's hard to remember details, and evidence pretty much disappears.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 6) These laws are to protect people's "Due Process" and to ensure freedom in America. You can't destroy people's lives with claims that can never be proven.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 5) After 30 years, if you bring up something that hasn't been tried or talked about prior, you are now committing a felony.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 4) After 25 years, as long as no charges have ever been brought up prior, you are liable for slander.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 3) You have up to 20 years for charges or civil lawsuit to go to trial. That is, you can report the charges, and it stalls with legal for years until enough evidence has been gather. So 20 years, that's plenty.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 2) You have 5 years to come forward for criminal charges.
@hoosiemommy27 @BokoHarambe @RobProvince 1) Or they were paid enough to lie. Here's the law as it should be:
All it takes is enough repetition &amp; maybe a few influencers to repeat it, and anyone with power could convince the world that slandering someone 40/50 years later is a crime. Just look at the trannies walking around. They're mentally ill, yet, they've been normalized by Obama.
@BokoHarambe @RobProvince 40 years later, there's no way to know for sure any of it was truth. She could be making it all up. So if you wait 40 years, you're committing a crime. It's targeted harassment, bullying, and fraud. I say lock her up.
@BokoHarambe @RobProvince Oh you're talking about the comment? Oh yeah, lock her up. That's slander at the very least, criminal because of the damage she's trying to cause. 		The mind can't distinguish the difference between made up memories and real memories. Dreams are stored the same as memories.
@BokoHarambe @RobProvince Just born with an abnormally large penis. But I don't really think that's something to consider wrong with me. I mean, I would think that's something a gorilla avi would respect.

@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 More guns is the answer. You've proven to yourself that gun control doesn't work.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Do the people of those countries do anything outside of the norms? America is different. We're a free people. We have guns, that's our thing
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Are those countries too poor to even afford illegal guns?
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 No it's not proven to work. Did those countries even have guns in the first place? Are those countries sharing a border with Mexico?
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 And so you believe now that it's proven that mistakes happen, you think the law will keep everyone safe? Better to have more guns.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Because I'm thinking outside the box?
@drawandstrike @ThomasWictor awe shit, you lost your blue mark. I'm sorry sir.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Better to have more guns.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Did a mental health background check stop the texas shooting? There are flaws with anything the gov. does.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 I'm all for it bro. Let's legalize and tax drugs. At least use the money to treat the drug addiction. People can make bullets so...
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 days, weeks, years. yes.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Canada is well, Canada. Used to having the government control them. They wait in line for days to receive medical treatment.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Britain is an island, so maybe they can cut down on their gun crime, and of course they're not free so yeah.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 An island like Japan, it may work, especially when they have limited rights to begin with. But then they still have mass murders
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Because Americans are free. We're faster paced, we don't have rules, we're a free people.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 What gun control do we need? You've already proven that gun control doesn't work because people can just import guns from outside.
Jimmy Butler is a gay https://t.co/XelM99q8aL
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 You're from Russia, so you don't know the US.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 America, you make your own rules man. That's part of the mentality, and hence, why we're going to have crazies and more gun crimes.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Do they have high gun crime rates? I doubt it. I've been to other countries. You do things the way you do things in those countries.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Canada, colder, used to being told what to do by the gov.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Not only that, the people aren't the same. We're more outspoken in America. Japan, come on now. Different.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 It's apples and oranges. Other countries don't have the court system we have. Well, me. You are probably Russian; bought by Hillary.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 They need knife control over there man. If a person can just go out and kill 19 people, they can't just let anybody own a knife.
RT @RepStevenSmith: @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/CkE7vQaB92
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 I would go for that, tax it, etc. You're onto something here. Let's not outlaw guns, or waste time on silly gun control
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 Besides mass murders still happen in Japan, you have a solid point. Japan has a strict immigration policy. We should look into that.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 So you believe that people wouldn't get guns from out of Country? Like you know, Mexico? With that wide open border?
@MayorDickinson Yeah let's pass $15/hr in the next 10 years. That will be very, very helpful. Of course solar sucks, and cars will be self-driving.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 That's proven to be false. The cities in America with the most gun control have the highest gun crime and murder rates.
@JesseGiesbrecht @altNOAA @ProLibertateNYC @mandridorange41 Maybe learn about crime then. You'd be surprised.
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 haha you from russia?
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 No you're a retard. I'm saying you're going to see less gun crime when it's cold out and less of a population.
.@RandPaul please let us know if you have cancer or osteoporosis
@JesseGiesbrecht @ProLibertateNYC @altNOAA @mandridorange41 America is the land of the free, Canada is a different country. Different people, different demographics. Apples are not oranges.
@JesseGiesbrecht @mandridorange41 @altNOAA U want an increase in death and crime, all because you feel sorry other races aren't as good as yours. That's just messed up, wrong &amp; racist
@JesseGiesbrecht @mandridorange41 @altNOAA Proof?
@JesseGiesbrecht @mandridorange41 @altNOAA You're wanting an un-needed increase in crime and death. That's just gross. You're nasty. But we do agree, Democrats need to stop killing.
@JesseGiesbrecht @mandridorange41 @altNOAA You've gone into different topics.
@JesseGiesbrecht @mandridorange41 @altNOAA No I never said that, you're just too dumb to read. We shouldn't allow terrorism just because we don't want peoples feelings to be hurt.
@Baesil69 Go move to another country; or in your case, since you're a bot, leave me alone.
@altNOAA @JesseGiesbrecht My opinion is that there have been many more lives saved because of guns. If you make guns illegal, you'll bring on the days of mad max
@JesseGiesbrecht @altNOAA okay when you start spitting out incorrect numbers, i leave the convo.
@down_sideways @altNOAA okay and what's your point? look at the data closer, they're democrats. do we lock up all white democrats? is that what you're suggesting?
@altNOAA @JesseGiesbrecht because it hurts to hear someone elses opinion? stay in your bubble and keep losing elections.
@JesseGiesbrecht @altNOAA we make guns illegal and more people will die; proven examples would be prohibition, drugs. We have to learn from our failures.
@JesseGiesbrecht @altNOAA lock up the bad guys we have; they tend to be democrats, but so what, let's lock them up.
@JesseGiesbrecht @altNOAA I think we have a way to stop crime by not allowing crime to come into our country. strict immigration. keep the bad guys out.
@down_sideways @altNOAA If you want to ignore all the black crime, but yes, white democrat scumbags
@AngryNatlPark Make things illegal and more people die
@AngryNatlPark Slaves still exist, mostly asian or south american, but they still exist in america.
@AngryNatlPark They are still easy to obtain. We have a drug problem in America right? Drugs are illegal, yet after the bars close, you can get drugs
@AngryNatlPark I can only imagine how many more would be killed if we made guns illegal. Why wouldn't you just buy a machine gun? When things are illegal
@AngryNatlPark There are truck bombs that kill more, there's also Nice, France; then Japan has a knife problem.
@AngryNatlPark These crazy democrats man. I wish we could solve the problem, but in order to do that, we need to stop trying to solve the wrong problem.
@Cernovich didn't Hillary try and green screen in a rally? something else was wrong with hillary. she took too much time off.
@altNOAA so? does that mean we should let them in to kill us? Or do we keep up the good work and keep the scumbags out?

@isionshyproper @mikeenochsback not entirely, and not in every state. each state has different laws, or are you russian? obviously you're 15 or so
@isionshyproper @mikeenochsback we're talking about different things
@isionshyproper @mikeenochsback yes, that's how money works. a lot of money depends on what you have. it's a lot of money if you don't have a lot of money.

@SenatorCarper What you gonna do? You gonna go there and personally fix the power? It takes as long as it takes.
@StollBrandon why cuz he died before he could cause too much damage?
@libertytarian yeah, he's being bitchmade
The things guys have to do to avoid being raped https://t.co/DtN8IrNKiF
@HouseCracka So she sexually assaulted Mr. Toback.
Bait and switch is illegal @realDonaldTrump. Next we'll see Trump doing the David Cop-A-Feel routine. (re: H.W. Bush's favorite joke)
@kevinpowers70 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Weak compared to whom?
Please pay for it yourself #HandsOffMyBC
No one making the connection that today is Hillary's Birthday? #JFKFiles
At this point, if you haven't been accused of sexual harassment, you're doing it wrong. #AdvancingJustice #JFKFiles #MAGA (it's a joke)
Someone has gotta admit, the David Coppa Feel joke is pretty funny, coming from an old guy in a wheel chair. #maga #JFKFiles

@EdChristina @TrumpTrain45Pac You're a damn homophobe
@EdChristina @TrumpTrain45Pac 15k tweets w/ 320 follows = bot. Keep pushing the taxes thing, only stupid people fall for it.

@TrumpTrain45Pac where's proof he said this?
@Ruleyork that word doesn't mean what you think it means

@piersmorgan They do when they keep a dirt bag from raping or murdering them.
@SenSanders Democrats spent a lot when Bush was President. Bush was weak and gave Democrats everything they wanted.
