@bengrove No!
Alright, Shaun White deserves it with that victory run he just threw down!! That was absolutely incredible...just wild stuff.
@PhatNat Ice is actually safer for ski racing. It's smoother, faster, and easier to hold a powerful edge necessary to turn at high speeds!
@Boyd4Congress Just let me know when you start hiring for your campaign!
This is now my dream car! http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/2009/top-2009-Conquest-Knight-XV.htm
First day of skiing tomorrow! All will be back to normal.
My first homecoming weekend. Spent far too much money but saw so many people! I guess that's how it works when you graduate.
We actually legit just broke down on I-95. This is too stereotypical, the transmission just stopped working. Great fun.
Great news that Microsoft teamed up with Yahoo finally...been waiting for a solid alternative to Google.

@Michael_Ballou And why am I a fairy? Oh, are you watching UVa in the college world series?
Just moved up to Maryland!
I'm graduating.
At Christian's pizza...be jealous, yeah!
Last wednesday of college!
I hate moving, especially when it's stuff that's not mine.
Gravedigger...whooo!!!
I'm in college but I am stymied by the abject filth and disparaging lack of cultural style in which these "educated" students choose to live
"U.S. man survives Niagara Falls plunge." My fellow human beings amaze me. http://viigo.im/70G
I'm now questioning my decision to get up early to do a sunrise hike on the Blue Ridge. I have a morning class (Seth Meyers style Really!?)
College! Writing proposal for research paper on political participation and internet social networking while sipping Red Bull and playin ...
I like it when my ears pop a third of the way down a ski run.
Packing to get out of Virginia and this mild weather. Heading to CO where there should be some real snow.
After 4 years I am done with ski team at UVA...I need to find something new to do with myself or I'm going to go crazy. I'm serious.
Finished regionals this weekend. Last college ski race of my life...so packing up my equipment felt a little strange.
Just finished my HW and finally gonna get some sleep
