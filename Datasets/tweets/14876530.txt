@oosterbaby14 Definitely,  when we went to dinner it was 101,  the temps are supposed to break and be in the 80s tomorrow &amp; next week.
Ok so I've been corrected the temps are still in the 90s but it feels great on my deck with a cool breeze from the storms to the N &amp; E.
@Dodie526 8). Love when that happens.
@Dodie526 WOW!  How fun was that?  So cool.
The temp has finally dipped into the 80s. My daughter asked if we could have a campfire.
@jasonhoard @macpowell BGSU Stroh Center.  I'd definitely help in promoting it.
@FosterBoy_23 agree
can't see any fireworks but I can hear them all around me (I think I hear Toledo's going off but too far away to see)
