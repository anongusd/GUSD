@elenaparent Yes and so is that tax reduction he promised before the midterms.  He lies every day, time and time again.  Suppose Trump voters who voted for him will now lose their jobs may wake up finally!
@PattyMurray Exactly!!!
@PrincessBravato Tacky, tacky, tacky.  Ugh!
@ChrisCuomo Wrong, wrong, wrong........no matter what, this has to stop.  Inappropriate response with total disrespect for our troops and the process.  Disorganized, not a plan well thought out.  So easy to put a system in place to process those seeking asylum.  Idiots running our government
@NBCNews Trump is a jerk, disgusting things to do to poor people. When will this nightmare be over for us.  Get him out of the white house and out of our lives. An embarrassment for all of us to even acknowledge he is our president!!!!!!!!
@PalmerReport Hellooo. Would love to see all his school records.  How he ever graduated from anything is beyond me.  Family bought his way through I’m  sure.
@TheRynheart Idiot!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We don’t have a President!
@jacksnowknows Actually think very rich ones who don’t want to loose all their property investment income by doing the right thing.  Trump is all about the money for himself, his family and his friends obviously.

@CREWcrew OMG what an embarrassment!
@CREWcrew @realDonaldTrump They murdered a resident of the USA idiot.  No matter how much money they pay you off excuses this.  Are you an idiot or what?  Just about the money!  You don’t get it!
@PrincessBravato God he is just so dumb.  What an embarrassment.
@PrincessBravato Trump is a total idiot!!!
@IndivisibleNet Please leave that would be great so we don’t have to listen to his lies.  I wish the entire press core would not show up to these ridiculous press briefings.  We don’t want to hear anymore lies from him.
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Exactly.  Total idiot the Hitler in the White House showing up blurting out his lies and inappropriate comments.  An embarrassment to us all.

@PalmerReport Actually that woman was attacking him by grabbing the mic and trying to pull it away almost hitting his face.  Inappropriate behavior by that staff member.  Not her job to step in the middle and attack any reporter in that way.

@funder Yes he did and hopefully someone will sue him for continuing to incite danger.
@PalmerReport Exactly.  Someone needs to sue him for inciting all of this danger.
@Bakari_Sellers Trump encourages all of this! Disgusting Hitler in the White House.  When will this nightmare be over.

@kaitlancollins Trump is causing all this hate. God when will this Hitler in the White House be gone.

@thehill Collins is a disgrace and a disappointment to all of us.
@PalmerReport Yes and am contributing money to her opponent to get her out ASAP.
@emilyjanefox Please do a book. I would pre order right now!  Hoping that the American Bar Associations announcement that they have re opened their investigation into Kavanaugh’s background will expose him and they will disbar him!

@PattyMurray Thank you, thank you.  I worry about the future of my 3 year old Granddaughter with the way our country is being torn apart by the Hitler in the White House with his bias against women, the press, the constitution and all his lies every day.  I’m documenting everything for her.

@PalmerReport Thank God
@GeorgeTakei @AmoneyResists He needs Kavanaugh on the court so he can pardon him when he gets convicted.  No wonder he got crazy defending him.
@EdKrassen Reminds me of the Charlie Sheen Winning rallies.  Thousands cheering him on.  Nightmare events and a big joke on Charlie when it came to a screeching halt!!!

@JimDabakis The documentary that is being done about this is going to blow the lid off of The Hitler in The White House and his concentration Camps just wait!

@AP Addictive alcoholic that should have been in therapy years ago.
@jwlarrabee Exactly, not only our country but his daughters will live with this embarrassment for years to come.  Nothing, including his confirmation, will ever erase this from their future endeavors.  His ego won’t allow him to withdraw and his family legacy will suffer.
@EdKrassen How about attempted murder idiot Brian.  Maybe we should investigate your background if you think attempted rape is not a crime.  Are you as stupid as you sound now.  What happened to you.
@byaaroncdavis Somebody must have old photos or videos of this behavior.   Let’s find them.
@kaitlancollins The World Leaders think he is a joke and laughable as the President and certainly want to see him defeated so we can actually make progress instead of going backwards in our commitments.  The entire USA has been assaulted by this immorally deteriorating Hitler in the White House.
@peterbakernyt No matter what, this is not going away with Kavanaugh’s confirmation and will continue on throughout his career.  This will be a living nightmare for him and his daughters and wife for years to come.  His ego won’t allow him to own up to his past.  Shameful for his family.
@Lawrence @SenatorCollins Collins is afraid of Trump.
@Amy_Siskind @PrincessBravato And while he’s at it he’s taking down his daughters for years to come!  His ego won’t allow him to admit to an out of control youth.  His family will not be able to ever recuperate from this experience and he is bringing the entire family down with him.  Shameful and disgraceful!
@thehill @realDonaldTrump He’s an idiot and everyone in that room knows it.  He doesn’t get that they love his stupidity and capture his most ridiculous sound bites making him look and sound like dumbest person on earth.  Keep talking Trump, the press are willing to listen!
@BFriedmanDC @waltb31 Kavanaugh is lying and leaving his family, wife and daughters to suffer from this the rest of their lives because his ego won’t allow him to admit his mistakes as a young adult.  Shameful that he continues this charade as the legacy he leaves behind.
@PattyMurray At this point his wife and his daughters will never live this down.  Their future is damaged forever because his ego won’t allow him to admit he was out of control as a young man.  Shameful and disgraceful what he is now leaving his family to endure for years to come.
@NBCNews Yes Kevin it does!  Are you an idiot or what!  Birds of a feather......
@kaitlancollins OMG tell me this isn’t true!  He’s a psycho.  Spending our money on this when children are being locked up and creating tariff nightmare for farmers who now have to receive aid checks and draft dodger with foot problems can still play 18 holes of golf every weekend on our dime!

@JoyceWhiteVance Disgusting man.
@kaitlancollins @marthamaccallum You can tell by his choice of words that he did do this and he knows it but has been caught and is still not man enough to own up!  Shameful disgrace to his family and the country.  This is going to get worse even if he is confirmed I can guarantee that.

@TVietor08 We all just fell off a turnip truck!  He lied to his parents where he was that night.  Lying is something he learned how to do early on, that’s why he is so good at it now!  Where are the parents whose house had the party that night. What are they saying?  Hello?????
@katierogers Seriously are they thinking we all just fell off a turnip truck. And a 17 year old kept a calendar.  More likely mom and dad were lied to by their son and he didn’t tell them where he was that night!  Seems like he would lie to his parents for sure.

@kaitlancollins Boasting! Idiot is more like it.  When the truth finally is revealed that Kavanaugh lied. Then what will he say! Shameful man.
@RepAdamSchiff And if they do rush to confirm how do we get rid of him when they finally find out he lied!!!! There will be an investigation private including articles, a book and witnesses coming forward! Shameful display.
@kaitlancollins LOL from one sexual predator to another! Says it all!!!! They have their own club with the Hitler in The White House as their leader.  Disgusting!

@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump He can’t process written communications only possibly verbal news from tv.  Definitely a sign of early Alzheimer’s disease with his anger outbursts and verbal abuse statements and paranoia.  Doctor exam in order.  Nightmare waiting to get worse for us.
@SenatorShaheen What the GOP fails to understand is that if Kavanaugh is confirmed without an investigation there will be private investigations, articles and I’m sure a book that will show he is a liar which will taint every case he ever hears.  No media training from the White House will help.
@KamalaHarris @PiperPerabo Thank you!
@VanityFair @SeanCasten Even if he is confirmed to the highest court the investigations into his past and this particular accusation will be ongoing privately until it is revealed that he has continued to lie.  His confirmation will then be tainted on all cases he hears.  He should withdraw immediately.
@PCUnitedPage @GOP Great idea!  Let’s make this happen.
@amvetsupport He’s got early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.  It is obvious and his child like behavior and blurts of comments with his outrages of abusive language temper tantrums demonstrates this. It’s being hidden that he is not well by the idiots surrounding him in the White House.  Ugh!
@NBCNews Gross
@kaitlancollins He lies and it will be proven at some point. No matter how much media coaching he gets from the idiots in The White House he will be shown to have lied about this for sure.  Shameful.  He should withdraw and try and save his family from this embarrassment.  Ugh!
@AmoneyResists This mothers must be very proud of them.  Ugh!  Shameful
@TheDemCoalition @ChuckGrassley @GOP And Grassley and his gang of thieves don’t get that even if they get this confirmation the search and investigative process will continue until the facts are clear.  Then Kavanaugh who should,withdraw now, will be tainted as a Supreme Court judge as a liar.  Way to go guys! Run!

@peterbakernyt The search for the truth will not end with his confirmation, but will continue privately until it is proven that Kavanaugh knew exactly what happened to Black and will be shown to be a liar after he is confirmed to the highest court in the land.  Every case he hears will be a lie
@MarkLandler Trump is an idiot child that obviously doesn’t get it.  This is not a joke idiot.  Leave before you continue to speak such embarrassing things to victims of this tragedy.  Shameful.
@JCNSeverino Your an idiot seriously and regardless of not recognizing that this happened and Kavanaugh is a liar, you should be ashamed as a woman for not finding out the truth and supporting an investigation to remove all doubt about this allegation.  Not brain surgery to figure this out!
@PattyMurray Exactly and no matter what, if they rush to confirm Kavanaugh it will not stop a thorough private investigation with articles and witnesses from the party of friends and classmates that will show Kavanaugh lied.
@HowardKurtz He is lying idiot or was too drunk to remember will be his next statement I’m sure.  People will start coming out of the woodwork from that party and school classmates will step forward to confirm he was there and what happened.  Just wait, if he is confirmed it will show he lied
@maziehirono Hello...Why do you think that Manafort plead out.  According to his attorney he did so out of concerns for the “safety of his family”. His family is under threats like Ford is because they oppose Trump and threaten his existence as President.  Not brain surgery to figure this out
@kaitlancollins What the GOP is too stupid to recognize is that if they don’t allow a full investigation before demanding Ford to testify and they push through a confirmation that it won’t end the pursuit of investigations and findings from independent resources to prove Kavanaugh lied.
@AynRandPaulRyan This guy is a total idiot.  Doesn’t get it just doesn’t get it.  Duty has nothing to do with it Tucker and until this happens close to you within your own family you will never understand the fear and anxiety that follows a victim of sexual harassment.  Do your homework stupid.

@RevKilpatrick Maybe you should be investigated for your past behavior if you would indeed believe in someone who is so morally bankrupt with regard to his family and the children he has put in his Hitler Concentration Camps.  Shameful...a disgrace to this nation.
@RepGonzalez @IvankaTrump @kveotv23 Are you an idiot or what. Seriously she could care less.
@olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @HouseGOP Time to investigate Graham for inappropriate past behaviors and he knows what I’m talking about.  Follow the money.
@psychdr100 @PrincessBravato At least one reporter at Fox is stepping up....yahooo
@krassenstein Wahoooooooo!!!!
@PrincessBravato Actually we would celebrate!!!
@NYGovCuomo Thank yuuuuuuuuu
@RepMarkTakano @BetsyDeVosED She only cares about her yacht.  She doesn’t get it and doesn’t care about the kids or their education.  Shameful legacy.
@SenatorShaheen The only thing she cares about is her yacht.
@OversightDems @RepCummings Trump has Dementia and early signs of Alzheimer’s with his outbursts of anger and incoherent behavior.  Doctors need to do tests.  Shameful that we have Hitler in the White House and children still in his concentration Camps!  When will this nightmare end for us.
@RepAdamSchiff More like he’s a petty mobster and Hitler in The White House.  Disgusting, shameful and an embarrassing legacy for our country.  He’s all about the money.  Lack of integrity and certainly has signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s.  Please let this nightmare be over!
@Cwilliams52 @PrincessBravato He has dementia obviously.
@amvetsupport Heck yes, not about money....it’s about integrity and getting rid of the Hitler crook in the White House.  Shameful what he says everyday.  Let this nightmare be over.
@ladyhawkerfinds @Bornabrit1 @POTUS Absolutely.
@SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AmericaFirstPol @mosbacher_mica @_VachelLindsay_ @Debradelai @BernardKerik @TheLastRefuge2 @JackPosobiec You are an idiot!  Seriously misinformed.  Shameful.
@WomenBelong @CFPB @SenDeanHeller @SenBobCorker @JerryMoran @SenSasse @SenThomTillis @SenatorTimScott Noooooooooooooo
@PhilipinDC @BrianKarem She should get a lawyer.  She’s going to need it very soon.
@TVietor08 @PressSec @seanspicer She should get a lawyer.  She’s going to need one soon.
@AynRandPaulRyan @DrDinD @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi He has signs of Alzheimer’s disease.  Seriously disconnected conversations, memory loss and bursts of anger.  What is his doctor doing here.  Ugh
@Alyssa_Milano @debbiesideris @maziehirono @SenMarkey @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris Thank yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
@joncoopertweets Absolutely!!!
@Bornabrit1 Absolutely agree.  Can we block Fox News from our cable provider?
@Acosta They better all lawyer up!
@MorriseyWV @POTUS Maybe you should be investigated.  Something doesn’t add up here.  Think a closer look for you is on the way!  Associating with Hitler in the White House who kidnaps children is not a legacy to leave behind for your family.
@MaddowBlog Yes yes and yes.  The Hitler in the White House is not only a criminal but a mobster as well.  Hellloooooo!!!!!!
@HollyBSorensen Holly, totally agree.  They should not be allowed to teach children in the future.  Disgusting.  Let me know if I can help.  Hope you are well....Beverly Strong,
@AlexMeluskey @FosterFriess @realDonaldTrump @960ThePatriot @RealSheriffJoe Foster is an idiot.  Talking about women and aspirin.  Shameful and as stupid as the Hitler in the White House with Concentration Camps for children.  Who raised such horrible people.  What a disgusting legacy.
@EdKrassen @lachlan @thedailybeast Lachlan should be fired.  He is a disgusting perverted person that should not be allowed anywhere near children or allowed to report news for any publication.  Shameful.
RT @ItsMeCathi: Republican Senator Susan Collins now says she's undecided on her vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 		W…
RT @ItsMeCathi: Now I hear Democratic Senator Doug Jones is on the fence about voting NO to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.…
@EdKrassen Better yet if we are to believe what she and her assistant say then she should leave the Hitler husband, move out of the White House and speak for herself.  Then and only then will we all start to hear and believe her.
@OMAROSA @amazon @booksamillion @bnbooks @Walmart @iTunes @iBooks @indiebound @kobo @GooglePlay @audible_com Loved your book and can’t wait to see the feature film!
@coleyworld @FoxNews Absolutely. Wish we could block them off of our cable!
@BillKristol @PrincessBravato Kelly should resign!  Nightmare!!!!!!!
@barbarastarrcnn @realDonaldTrump Did that other idiot Nikki Haley say anything.
@PARISDENNARD Idiot and stupid.  Wrong information and supporting Hitler, racist in the White House.  Shame on you.  Disappointing and shameful legacy to leave your family.!
@topgyalnyc @VictorBlackwell @williamsforga Williams is a racist and should be investigated himself.  Disgusting!!!!!
@TrisResists @PrincessBravato @AriMelber @MSNBC @ladyhawkerfinds @TheSWPrincess @Trumpet1984 @Lady_Star_Gem @DeadpoolResists @B52Malmet @InSpiteOfTrump @Mean_Adam @LunaLuvgood2017 @lfkraus Disgusting!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @seanhannity @SebGorka No, I blocked them months ago!  Don’t want that poison on my twitter feed.  Disgusting people.
@leftiblog Not one dollar should be spent on a parade for the Hitler in the White House!
@EdKrassen If John Kelly is running the White House maybe we should investigate him as well.  He says everyone there works for him and not the Hitler in the White House.  A closer look at John Kelly may be in order.  His background personally.
@OMAROSA @simonschuster @GalleryBooks Thank God for you.  And thank yuuuuuuuu for finally truly confirming all we’ve known about this Hitler in the White House.  When will the nightmare be over.
@krassenstein Can you give us a list of the Pentagon officials we can call and email our outrage regarding ever having a parade for this Hitler in the White House.  Be interested to know who we can confront on this one especially.
@AmoneyResists Absolutely agree!!!!
@krassenstein Totally agree!!!!!
@EdKrassen Cancel it altogether please!
@votevets Thank God!!!!
@OversightDems @RepCummings Thank yuuuuuuuuu
@TVietor08 @JohnBrennan @PressSec Kelly is running the White House and we all know it.  Disgusting!  Hitler and Kelly and the daily cover up!  God when will this nightmare be over!
@SecretaryZinke @GDLA @WhiteHouse Idiot.
@jaketapper @SenJohnKennedy He should resign and change his name.  He is not and never will be a Kennedy!  Disgusting and shameful.
@SenJohnKennedy Resign. You are a disgrace!  And change your name, you don’t deserve to be called a Kennedy.  Disgusting and shameful.
@EdKrassen Can you get the names of the military who are approving this.  Need a list so we can call and email how ridiculous this is.  Honoring Hitler in the White House is a disgrace to our country and to our military.  Shameful!
@RepDanKildee @realDonaldTrump And who is the idiot in the military that is approving this expenditure for someone who has not even visited our military fighting for us now!  Disgrace!
@RepDanKildee @realDonaldTrump Ridiculous!  We don’t need a parade to honor the Hitler in the White House.  Absolute disgrace and speaks to a man with no morals or honor to spend that money on a frivolous display.  Absolutely disgusting.  Don’t vote for him ever again and get him out ASAP!
@petestrozk @DrDinD I’ve always been pro FBI but for the first time in my 75 years on earth I’m totally disappointed in what they have done here.  Just doesn’t add up and seems motivated by internal politics of the worst kind.  Shameful.
@rsg Thank you for doing the right thing!  And for standing up to be counted.
@DemWrite @realDonaldTrump @GOP Maybe someone should check into all of Trump’s diplomas and school records.  Would be interesting to hear his classmates recollections of those years and his fixed GPA!
@morgfair @JSavoly She’s an idiot.
@marklevinshow Levin idiot show.  Embarrassment.  Off the air!
@deray @BaltimorePolice @MayorPugh50 Disgusting. This officer should be fired immediately.  Overreacting obviously.
@JSavoly Someone should investigate all of Trump’s school records.  Would be interesting to see how in the world this Hitler in the White House was able to pass anything let alone get a degree from any reputable school.  Someone was paid off.
@thehill All they eat is junk food because that’s how they were raised!  Brains are gone.  They wouldn’t know a good restaurant if they saw it!
@oliverdarcy @PrincessBravato Disgusting what this is doing to a very young generation.  Stop please.  You just don’t get it or don’t care.
@theycallmebob @PrincessBravato This is amazing!  She should be on THE VOICE!  Wow!
@kaitlancollins Rudy is an embarrassment and an idiot!  Like Mueller is going to listen to him pontificate on and on and on for that Hitler in the White House.  And Omarosa,  thank God!
@BrianKarem Don’t stop asking please. We are counting on you.  Thank yuuuuuu.
@krassenstein Thank yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
@CJPatruno @PrincessBravato @IngrahamAngle This woman is sick.  What a shameful legacy for her children and family to grow up with.  Put her off the air please!
@TwitterSafety Maybe we should resurrect Jim Jones and have him twitter to our young kids to see if that would be considered threatening or Hitler for that matter.  It doesn’t take brain surgery to figure out that Alex Jones should be off of twitter before he harms anybody else!
@dumptrump33 @RandPaul Idiot!
@ChrisEvans Thank you Chris.  Get this Hitler out of the White House.  An embarrassment.
@ToddThaler Thank youuuuu Todd.  Get this Hitler out of the White House.  An embarrassment to us all.  Bev
@BrianKarem Can you stop this 12 Million Dollar parade that Hitler in the White House has demanded.  Shameful!!
@PentagonPresSec @ChiefPentSpox Please no 12 million dollar parade for Hitler in the White House. Shameful!
@DepSecDef We do not need a 12 million dollar parade to honor Hitler in the White House.  Shameful!
@EdKrassen @KingJames And don’t let Melania anywhere near those kids.  Nothing but a politically motivated move on their part.
@krassenstein You are a hoot!!!!!  Love this!!!!
@plunderbund @Troy_Balderson Troy idiot!!!!!!!  Embarrassment!
@krassenstein Exactly what I have been saying for months.  Press should boycott because constant lies and dangerous comments about the press that will bring nothing but violence.  Don’t show up and you will see how they react to that, LOL.  We’ve heard enough lies to last a lifetime.
@amjoyshow @AprilDRyan @JRubinBlogger Thank yuuuuuuuuuuu
@andrewcuomo Thank yuuuuuuuuuu!!!!
@kaitlancollins Exactly!  You get it!  Unbelievable.  Cheating on his wife again!  Disgusting.
@kaitlancollins Seriously, Melania should leave this Hitler idiot and get a life!  No one buys into this statement by her so called PR person.  Talk about a marriage in conflict and mixed messages.  She should start by educating her husband about caring for children being put in cages!
@BetoORourke Suggestion....you need a better headshot for this ad.
@Acosta Thank you.  I wish all press would just not show up and feed this Hitler in the White Houses ego for attention.  Sick of seeing and hearing about his shameful personal life and what he’s doing to these poor kids taken from their parents.  Hitler is back.
@TDPattillo @PressSec Exactly right.  No press, no story and we don’t need to hear the propaganda spewing out of Sarah’s mouth any longer.  She’s an embarrassment as a spokesperson for Hitler in the White House!
@riotwomennn @PrincessBravato @PressSec I wish the entire press would walk out of these embarrassing press briefings.  Absolutely disgusting and unwatchable and dangerous for all of us.  Idiots in the White House.  Can’t wait for this nightmare to be over.
@murphymike Voice of reason, thank you!
@EdKrassen @Acosta @SarahHuckabee She is complete idiot and should resign.  What an embarrassment.
@MattNegrin @PrincessBravato @seanhannity Hannity is an idiot!  Can’t wait to hear his Cohen tapes.  He should resign now.  An embarrassment.
@EdKrassen @seanhannity Sean Hannity is total idiot!
@jonfavs @realDonaldTrump Because we have an idiot Hitler in the White House.  He lies, cheats on his wife, covers up when convenient.  Has no class and takes babies away from their parents.  Nightmare for the USA and a total embarrassment for us all.
@itsgabrielleu Love you kiddo.  Always giving and caring. Miss you.	Xoxoxo Bev Strong
@AngrierWHStaff @MeghanMcCain Meghan should be off the show.  Embarrassment to her fathers legacy.  Out of touch and biased to a hateful fault.  Can’t watch this show any longer.
@SandraSmithFox Your an idiot and trust me we didn’t just fall off a turnip truck.  Get your facts straight before asking biased questions of Kudlow.  Shame on you and Fox for helping this Hitler in the White House continue to lie every day to America.  Bad legacy to leave your children.
@krassenstein @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepScottPerry @mattgaetz @DesJarlaisTN04 @CongressmanHice @RepGosar Thank you for this list.  We are all going to start protesting and calling ASAP.  These so called representatives of the USA are an embarrassment and should resign if they are that afraid of standing up to the Hitler in the White House.
@MichaelAvenatti @seanhannity We’ve all stopped watching the bias Hannity months ago.  He’s an embarrassment.  A waste of an interview.  Laughable.  Can’t wait for his Cohen tapes to come out.
@CNNPolitics Mark is complete idiot and should resign and we should investigate his past.  Lots to say about that!
@AP4Liberty Your a disgrace to this country and we will make sure you are not elected.  What a legacy to leave your children to support Hitler in the White House.  You are an embarrassment!
@PalmerReport Oh, please tell me that these tapes of idiot Hannity are going to be released.  Please!!!!!!!
@freedomcaucus You all should resign.  A disgrace to this country and can’t wait to vote you all out of office.  Shame on you for supporting this Hitler in the White House and not standing up to the disgusting legacy this is leaving for your family and the children in this country!
@peterbakernyt @jaketapper @PressSec @kaitlancollins The entire attending press should have walked out in protest! Maybe that would wake up this idiot press secretary and the Hitler she's working for!
@ShepNewsTeam Well it's about time!!!  Thanks for creating this nightmare Hitler in the White House.  What an embarrassment.  If I could delete Fox from my cable I would.  Disgusting Fox legacy.
@dallascowboys Jerry Jones is an idiot!!!! He has his porn stars and has the nerve to tell his players how to conduct themselves.  What a legacy to leave his family. An embarrassment to us all
@VFWHQ @CNN @NBCNews @ABC @FoxNews @CBSNews If you don’t want anyone to boo, then don’t have Hitler from the White House as your speaker.  No one wants to hear his lies anymore.  Shameful and an embarrassment for the USA.  We are all praying this nightmare will be over soon!
@TPUSANews Shame on you for indoctrinated our youth in such a negative way.  Stop!
@BrianKarem Wouldn’t it be incredibly great if you would all stand up in the middle of one of her ridiculous press meetings and walk out without a word, shut the door and leave her standing there in silence.  Wow. Now that is a headline worldwide!!!!!
@teambarbara @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Go girl, you have my support.  Fox and Friends will never get it.
@atrupar @teambarbara Fox and Friends are no friends to any USA citizen. They should have finished the interview as unbiased journalist, but instead couldn’t handle it and cut her off.  Shame shame shame.  Blocking Fox in total.  Biased media outlet.  Why is the question.  Need better reporters here.
@RandPaul You are a complete idiot and embarrassment to the USA.  Ask the Hitler in the White House to accept your resignation so you can both move to Russia with all us Republican voters approval!!!!  Or better yet with all us previously Republican voters who are standing up finally.
@PalmerReport Something up with Christopher Ruddy.  Is he next to be investigated?  Ummmmm.
@newsmax Yes and we all just fell off a turnip truck!  You are an idiot and can’t stand up to this Hitler in the White House.  For shame.  What a legacy to leave your children!
@EricSchultz @PattiSolisDoyle He is an idiot and an accomplice to all the lies he and that Hitler in the White House told and continues to tell.  An embarrassment and an insult to us all.
@PrincessBravato And who is paying for this and how much is it and who is this parade for, Hitler in the White House? This is a pass. Stop this immediately.  A complete embarrassment and in bad taste when children have been taken away by this idiot psychopath.
@will_c_fischer @votevets @realDonaldTrump Exactly, this is a disgrace and we don’t need to finance a parade for Hitler in the White House.  This should be investigated by the Pentagon.  Who are the idiots that are making this happen.  Our money going to waste on a traitor!!!!!!  Who can we call and email to stop this?
@dlehrer @MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Finally, waking up and standing up!  Thank you!
@PalmerReport Can you investigate this ridiculous money that trump is spending for a parade for himself!!  Ridiculous when that money is ours and we don’t need a parade to honor him for being a traitor, idiot and locking up kids.  Makes us all sick!  Can this be stopped.  No parade!
@vademocrats @realDonaldTrump @CoreyStewartVA Corey is deaf, dumb, blind and stupid.  And spineless!
@realScottWagner You are old a naive!  What is wrong with you idiot!  How dare you put anyone down like that.  I’m sure your kids will love your legacy for not standing up to the Hitler in the White House.  How disappointing, resign please.
@RandPaul @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews You are without a doubt a complete idiot!!!!! No longer a Republican I'm switching to Democratic party immediately.  Shame on you and your colleagues.
@BruceTurkel Thank you for standing up to what’s right.  Shame on Fox for what they continue to create for us to have to endure this embarrassment as a president.  Blocking all of Fox for months now and wish we could put the network off my cable provider.
@SenatorShaheen @POTUS Absolutely what I was hoping for.  Thank you!!!!
@ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Hello. Embarrassing.  Please wake up to what you have created and continue to create this dialog against the USA.  What is wrong with you that you just don’t hear what is happening.  Please start standing up against anyone who speaks about our country the way Trump is.
@HuntsmanAbby Well finally you are standing up to this Hitler in the White House.  Such an embarrassment to us all.  Maybe Fox and Friends will finally wake up to what they help create!!!
@cgagin Bravo!!!  Someone who is finally standing up to this Hitler in the White House.  Help get this embarrassment out and set us back on course.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JohnBrennan Wait add all the Republicans that are saying the same thing.  You are not listening any longer. What happened to you?
@GeraldoRivera What has happened to you seriously. Maybe you should move to Russia.  I was a big fan previously, but question your defending this Hitler in the White House.  Not the legacy you should be leaving.
@DarrellIssa @Jim_Jordan Jim Jordan is lying about the abuse that he knows very well what happened.  He should be investigated and be in jail.  Shame on you for supporting such a person.
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump You were not listening and should resign.  You are an embarrassment to all of us.  Shame on you for denigrating our FBI and their Agents.  Maybe you should move to Russia, or maybe you have.
@NextRevFNC @DarrellIssa Issa is complicit and a complete idiot.  He should resign in shame for what he is saying about the FBI.  He just doesn’t get it or does and will not have the —— to stand up for the USA.  Embarrassing and unacceptable.
@TedNugent Shame on you.  Disgusting human being.  What a legacy to leave us with.
@TaraSetmayer @johnrobertsFox Finally you are standing up for your colleagues!! Thank you.  Shame on Trump seriously, am so discouraged by his mean spirit and slamming of the press.  Lost my vote along the way.  I’m unblocking you because you had the guts to be honest.
@SamGyimah He doesn’t have any manners or class.  Mentally unstable and a total embarrassment to us all here in the USA.  Disappointed that the Queen is allowing him to visit but maybe she can give him some advice that his mother forgot to provide him!
@DrDenaGrayson @HouseJudiciary @RepGoodlatte Badlatte should resign!  A true embarrassment.  He must think we all just fell off a turnip truck!  Follows Hitler in the White House and cares less about children taken away from their parents.  A shame on our nation that will never be forgotten!
@PalmerReport She’s definitely my new champion!  And hopefully that Dentist with his body language abilities will resign and go back to drilling teeth instead of FBI agents!  Seriously the GOP must think we all just fell off a turnip truck!!
@RepRaskin Bravo!  Thank you.  There is hope if you continue to stand up!
@RepGosar @LarsLarsonShow You are an embarrassment to the Republican Party.  Resign before you totally destroy any credibility.  Seriously, what has being a Dentist have to do with today’s hearing.  Absolutely nothing.  You are a joke, or maybe you were trying to be funny.  Stand up...save those children!
@jpodhoretz Bravo!!!! Exactly.
@ABC Maybe we should investigate Louie and his past history with affairs.
@CNN Time to go Louie, resign....you are the embarrassment!
@PalmerReport @RepBonnie Yes yes yes, she is my new champion!!!!!!  Seriously wish there were more like her!!!!!!  Thank you!
@abbybotts01 @WPJohnWagner @Fahrenthold @UVA @Miller_Center Marc Short should not be allowed anywhere near our children to teach anything related to the Hitler In the White House that he is responsible for creating.
@Miller_Center Anyone associated with the Hitler in the White House should not be allowed to teach our children period.  Disgusting that you would allow this and ever more why our children nationwide should not attend your school.
@cavalierdaily Please do not allow Marc Short to teach anyone anything.
@RepJerryNadler @HouseGOP Strzok.....Bravo!  Thank you to you both for standing up and putting Gowdy in his place.  Gowdy a total disappointment to the Republican voters and he should resign.  He does not represent our thoughts.  Please continue to expose what the GOP has become.  We are all disgusted.
@mattgaetz @SNICKERS Bravo Peter Stryzok!!!!!!  Thank God for him and what he stands for.  His comments to Gowdy should be played over and over again so that the world can hear how a man stands up for his beliefs unlike you and Gowdy who should resign.  What an embarrassment you both are.
@mattgaetz @SNICKERS You are a complete idiot and should resign.  You and Trey Gowdy have convinced us Republicans to change to Democrats with your efforts on unimportant issues instead of you not standing up to the Hitler in the White House.  What are you doing?  Shame on you.
@DEADLINE @TheGershAgency @lifetimetv THANK YOU Ken Kaplan!!!!!!!  Best, Beverly Strong
@TheWrap @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Disgusting woman and terrible legacy to leave for her children.  Very sad.  She doesn’t get it at all.
@RodRosenstien THANK YOU!!!!
@DesignationSix @FoxNews @seanhannity @Nutrisystem @McDonalds @ComfortClick @AARP @Amway @LensCrafters @NFL @redlobster @Walmart Boycott
@BillPalmer @PalmerReport Great job.  You figured it out!!!!!!!  Thank you.
@RodRosenstien @kimguilfoyle Interesting, two people and you assume that the first person to lay down the gun is a woman, LOL.  You must have meant two women or assuming that the other “person” is a man, you meant it exactly like you would have, LOL.  Doesn’t work this way any more kiddo!!!!
@RodRosenstien The message is SAVE OUR COUNTRY!!!!!  Save the children!  And more, more more..  do something!!!
@RodRosenstien @GeorgeWill @BillKristol Time for you to change over to Democrat, I did.!!!!!!!
@PalmerReport Kennedy son, the Bank, the Trump loans, the follow the money Muller investigations.....all adds up now.  Trump made a deal with Kennedy to pardon the son if he resigned now.  You are right.
@RodRosenstien Bravo!!!!!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC How can you stand by and do absolutely nothing to stop this Hitler maniac in the White House and his Concentration Camps in the USA and do nothing!  What is wrong with you.  Am not a Republican anymore because of your inability to see what he is doing.  Your a Hitler Soldier!
@JoeBiden Please please run for President and bring Joe Kennedy III with you.  I will fight to my last breath to help you win!  Get this madman out of our lives and end his Hitler Concentration Camps in the USA.  Bev
@Jim_Jordan I am as of today no loner a Republican!  Shame on you! Save the children in the Hitler Trump death camps that our idiot president has created before these children start to go missing.  What are you thinking.  You must not have children or you just are a soldier with no heart.
@GarrettHaake @TGowdySC I’m now Not A Republican any longer.  The important issues are being ignored by the GOP and instead of rescuing these children from Trump Concentration Camps they have become soldiers for Hitler in the White House.  I will now do everything I can to get them all out of office!
@RepJerryNadler @HouseGOP THANK YOU!  I’m now definitely NOT a Republican any longer.  They are puppets for HITLER  in the White House and the Trump Concentration Camps in the USA! 	So ashamed and will fight to get them all out of office!
@RepDennyHeck Palmer report
@PalmerReport Great minds........I’ve been hoping for someone to say what I’ve been thinking all day.  Investigate!  Please.  Just doesn’t add up.   Bev
@VeteranTinoco @cmf_nashville @DavidBegnaud Isn’t that what Hitlers soldiers said about what they were doing?  Sounds all too familiar.
@StephenAtHome He’s succeeding in getting you to stop talking about the children by attacking you personally.  Please don’t stop helping those kids.  Continue to ask where are they and why are they being flown all over the country by our airlines in handcuffs?
@MichaelAvenatti Hope you go after the airlines that are transporting these children across the US and sue them for collusion!!!!
@StephenAtHome You are a genius with your words of wisdom and continue to give all of us hope that the nightmare will soon be over.  Continue especially until every last child is reunited with their parents please.  Bev
@TheWrap Liars Inc.
@ElizabethEThorp @PrincessBravato @lsarsour @united Do not fly United period or any other airline that supports transporting children from their parents.  Hope these parents can sue the airline for collusion!!!!!!
@AntonioSabatoJr Shame on you Antonio!!!  What have you become.  You are supporting Trump Concentration Camps in the USA and Hitler in the White House.  Wake up!  Bev
@FlakedAndFormed @NancyPelosi Here here!!!!!!!!  Thank you Tim.  Bev
@DavidBegnaud Nut case in the White House.  Maybe the first immigrant he should send back is Melania!!!!!!
@WomenForTrump4 @YouTube Satan is already here and you support his Hitler Concentration Camps!!!  Way to go!  Your children will be proud to hear this!!!!
@MagaLIKEaM0F0 Disgusting organization and immoral!!!!!!!!
@brennanmgilmore @PressSec Please thank your owner for all of us in the United States that would absolutely do the same thing.  As a woman and grandmother I’m  offended by her continued lies and she is definitely an embarrassment to us all!!!!!!! Including her Hitler boss!!!!
@StephGrisham45 @FLOTUS Maybe her jacket should have said “Welcome to the	Trump Concentration Camp MAGA!!  Whoever planned this press junket should be fired for putting her in a controversial jacket taking away the impact of the circumstances she was there to witness.  Poor planning no excuse here.
@DEADLINE Thank you!  Find these children and get them out of these Trump Concentration Camps!  And want to know if there is a way to request that my cable provider remove the Fox Network from my television all together.  Maybe we can start there especially with Fox and Friends!
@StephenAtHome THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!
