@LudovicaIaccino @HNNAfrica*motivated and that because we're true Christians. Being a Nigerian is depriving us and our kids a lot of things
@LudovicaIaccino @HNNAfrica they hate biafran for no reason, they kill us for no reason, maybe because we're more industrious,
@LudovicaIaccino @HNNAfrica I voted YES because there is a natural hatred to the biafrans from the beginning when Nigeria was created, ctn.
@LudovicaIaccino what every biafran want now is state of biafra believe it or not  ,we are so tired of the marginalization from Nigeria
