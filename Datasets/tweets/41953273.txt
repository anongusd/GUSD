@DClim16 @CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio If it gets finalized, I guess we will find out, but I don’t see it getting done without May.
@DClim16 @CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio May is solid, but if I was the O’s front office, I wouldn’t trade Machado to the Dodgers without getting at least one of Verdugo/Buehler/Alvarez. I’ve read reports that has Alvarez in the deal and not in the deal but “sources”!
@DClim16 @CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio I get that, but doesn’t every team have off limit prospects? Giving up five prospects (the reports I’ve seen) is quite a bit. I do think Verdugo plus one probably would have gotten the deal done.
@DClim16 @CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio But if you can get the player anyway, does it matter?
