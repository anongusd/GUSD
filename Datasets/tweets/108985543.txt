Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) warns that House passing CR and disaster funding as separate bills likely means disaster supplemental waits until 2018 because it will be difficult to get unanimous consent for it as a stand-alone.
House GOP aide says CR will include $5.9 billion for missile defense, the troop surge, and Naval ship repair. These items, which lawmakers are referring to as "anomalies," were included in CR that House Approps Cmte posted earlier this month — they're not new, per aide.
