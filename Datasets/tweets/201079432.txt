It’s not too late to get real health care reform right. @BarackObama @Whitehouse – call me! (202) 225-2506 #obamacrickets
9 - Give states flexibility to improve #Medicaid through innovation. #obamacrickets
8 – Reduce the doctor shortage by incentivizing them to work in underserved areas. #obamacrickets
7 - Crack down on junk lawsuits and cap attorney fees so doctors can focus on care patients truly need. #obamacrickets
6 - Enable #smallbiz and other groups to pool their coverage, which will lower costs. #obamacrickets
5 - Increase transparency in billing so consumers know what they are paying for. #obamacrickets
4 – Empower workers and families with tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). #obamacrickets
3 - Treat everyone equally and fairly by providing a universal tax incentive for buying health insurance. #obamacrickets
2 - Create high risk pools with premium caps so people with pre-existing conditions are guaranteed affordable coverage. #obamacrickets
1 - Make health insurance companies compete nationwide, across state lines. #obamacrickets
Check out the 9 ideas for real health care reform that we sent to @BarackObama… http://t.co/44EFpuU2OQ #obamacrickets
Maybe @BarackObama won’t respond or discuss our ideas b/c he doesn’t want folks to know “#Obamacare or nothing”=false choice. #obamacrickets
Is @BarackObama really too busy to work with us and help Americans who are hurting because of #Obamacare? #obamacrickets
I want to do that without a Washington-knows-best takeover that wrecks everyone else’s health care (#Obamacare). #obamacrickets
I want to help people without insurance get affordable coverage and protect folks with pre-existing conditions. #obamacrickets
12 - @BarackObama said he was going to watch the movie “Cesar Chavez” this weekend. #obamacrickets
11 - @BarackObama committed to attending at least 30 high-dollar political fundraisers in the first six months of this year. #obamacrickets
10 - @BarackObama unveiled his @NCAA #bracket picks on @ESPN. #obamacrickets
9 - @BarackObama called in to @RyanSeacrest’s radio show and discussed wearing jeans. #obamacrickets

2 - @BarackObama hosted the @NBA’s @MiamiHeat at the @WhiteHouse. #obamacrickets
1 - @BarackObama vacationed in #Hawaii for 17 days, playing round after round of #golf. #obamacrickets
12 things @BarackObama did instead of responding to our letter and meeting to talk health care solutions… #obamacrickets
Today is 100th day w/o response from @BarackObama. Real ppl with real health care needs are being hurt by his disastrous law. #obamacrickets
Back in December, I and 33 others sent @BarackObama 9 health care reform ideas and request to meet. So far, all we’ve heard: #obamacrickets!
In wake of numerous #Obamacare failures, @BarackObama said “If you’ve got good ideas, bring them to me.” So we did. #obamacrickets
#Obamacare just isn’t working. More and more folks now forced to pay more money for inferior health insurance. #obamacrickets
