@StephenK_FB It sounds to me like FNS &amp; states are trying to get as many new SNAP applicants into this pre Jan. 20 round of payments as they possibly can to limit how many benefits will need to be pulled from contingency funds.
@StephenK_FB They should probably be more clear - limited refers to the $3B, which even should cover new SNAP applicants in the weeks to come with no problem whatsoever. HUGE Q is what happens after that - we just do not know.
@StephenK_FB This Q&amp;A from FNS helpful, if you don't already have it - https://t.co/xpRkYkV8ar

@SadFndngFathers @ddale8 Routine food inspections not really comparable to fire response. Maybe more like fire marshall inspections. Fwiw FDA foodborne illness outbreak investigations &amp; response, high-risk recalls, etc, continue through shutdown.

@LadyDembai All valid points!
@LadyDembai High-risk recall work is excepted during the shutdown (or should be according to the HHS shutdown plan), but yes I agree this is an area to watch *very* closely. It's critical work (we all eat!)
@LimOpinion @SarahKarlin You are correct we knew this weeks ago. Not news that FDA halted food safety routine inspections, though the report did have some news about FDA's efforts to restart high-risk inspections and other efforts to get inspectors back on the job.
@LadyDembai Thanks! Yes, I think most everyone agrees FDA's role in food safety is really important. My point was only that food facility inspections aren't happening super frequently for most facilities even when the govt is fully funded. But all those issues you raise are good Qs.
@davidgaliel Thanks! I think this is actually my first thread (really) so appreciate the feedback.
@davidgaliel Not saying it's no big deal, just trying to put things in context. I think there's very little understanding of the role of FDA inspection in the food safety system.
@mmbagelz All ears! hbottemiller@politico.com
These are all things we need to be watching closely. But context is still important. The end! 🤗
Of course, food safety is always a legitimate concern during a shutdown. Lots of important staff are furloughed. Detecting and responding to outbreaks could be slower, and so on. If this drags on, there could be many missed inspections.
Today, FDA is required to inspect all high-risk food facilities (think also: fresh cut fruit, shell eggs, spices) at least once EVERY THREE YEARS. Yes, once. Every three years.
The idea that a couple weeks of no routine food inspections puts us all in danger is probably a bit of a stretch.		Advocates have long urged more frequent inspections.		A 2011 food safety law required FDA to inspect all high-risk facilities at least once in the first FIVE YEARS.
Stepping back even further: FDA might do like 160 routine food inspections per week (#/@SGottliebFDA today). Again, I think most people agree these inspections are important. 		But there are 80k food facilities in the U.S.
*Thrilling thread re: FDA food inspections &amp; shutdown 👇		FDA might do something like 50 inspections of high-risk food facilities (think soft cheese, seafood) per week. Most people agree these inspections are important. 		But there are *20k* high-risk food facilities in the U.S.
@RogerGreeson You're right seems a little high - though the residents I know work completely insane hours.
Reminds me of the time I went to my dad's cardiologist appt w/him. My ate-whatever-he-wanted dad had already had a few heart attacks at that point. Only dietary advice doc gave: Avoid too many leafy greens (interferes w/blood thinner drugs). 		https://t.co/CH99yEW6mE

@OklianaFarms Yes, I have almost this exact dream! It’s horrible
@amesrobb I think that’s a big Q. They are going to have to scramble - if you want to talk logistics sometime I’m at hbottemiller@politico.com
@amesrobb @barbarasoderlin We were all pretty surprised about timing - they also said they wouldn’t go 40 days without benefits, which seemed to sugggest timing would get back on track for March but TBD on how they pay for it
@amesrobb That would make sense, I agree! But they told us it would go early to SNAP recipients
@amesrobb @barbarasoderlin They will be paid early, but they would not give any details about how March will work if it comes to that https://t.co/As3f0mP7TM

The assurance that the food stamp program would be on secure financial footing in February marked a reversal from the White House. 		https://t.co/As3f0mP7TM
Breaking: USDA finds more than $4.8 billion to keep food stamp benefits funded in February amid ongoing shutdown. 		Using obscure spending bill provision (the last now expired CR), Feb. benefits will be paid out early (Jan. 20) WITHOUT dipping into SNAP reserve fund. March TBD.
RT @liz_crampton: USDA extending deadline for farmers to apply for trade aid payments due to govt shutdown https://t.co/mRGrO5n8rA
@OatesBryce Yes it is a different situation. I’m just trying to put this $$ in perspective. USDA almost certainly has wiggle room.
The White House suggested last week USDA doesn’t have  *$1.7 billion* to cover gap in food stamps for nearly 39 million people in February. 		Earlier this year, USDA was able to pledge *$12 billion* in trade aid for farmers w/o getting any new money from Congress.
@annehelen The case for inbox infinity!
@kevintkrueger @jtiltonflood @Shawridgefarm @realloudlyndsey Makes me wonder why food industry spent so much $$$ and withstood absolutely brutal PR fighting labels. I totally get the opposition in principle, but cost-benefit of whole battle seems a little lopsided in hindsight. 🤷‍♀️
@kevintkrueger @jtiltonflood @Shawridgefarm @realloudlyndsey Have asked around about this - I’ve so far heard no one in food industry say the labels already on packages (largely in response to VT) have changed sales.

@Emilycgb If anything, I think there's been not very much coverage of the fact that despite the anxiety over tariffs, farmers by and large very much support still support Trump - has not changed.
@Emilycgb Is he referring to tariffs? I'd argue there's been a TON of coverage of the negative impact on ag. Probably more mainstream coverage of ag from just that in Trump era than any other issue in the past several years.

Farm bill quote of the week: "I feel like we're that turtle on the fence post — legs are going 900 miles an hour, but you can't make any progress," @ConawayTX11 told POLITICO before his meeting Peterson Mon. "We've got to get off the fence post." #farmbill
@mattmherrick It was a highly lucrative joke, wasn’t it? Tho I still think long term damaging for Amazon in terms of public perception
@richnanda I agree with you in the short term, but long term there will probably be serious consequences for eroding public trust/favorability.

@PearsonCattle @Clare_Brock It's a tough road, no matter how you shake it. If it passes House then reconciled deal has no new SNAP work requirements (which is what everyone expects), then they lose many conservatives. Dem support would be essential.

@TamaraHinton P.S. still confused about your tweet about 2008 being party line - that was bipartisan and then more so bipartisan to override the veto.
@TamaraHinton I hear your point here, but we don't consider voting for one piece of the farm bill a vote for the whole shebang.
@TamaraHinton Seems reasonable to assume these were also bipartisan, but I could be wrong!
@TamaraHinton Though I will fully admit I couldn't find the party-line breakdown from these two years: 		1973 - 226-182 ( ) HOUSE -- Final vote: 252-151 ( )	1977 - 294-114 ( ) HOUSE -- Final vote: 283-107 ( )
@TamaraHinton With all due respect (hi!) that's just not true. I went through all of the roll call votes dating back to 1965 - looking both at initial House vote and also vote on final passage. None were w/one party only.
@TamaraHinton The House has never *passed* a farm bill on party lines. Put another way: It's always passed w/bipartisan support (at least since 1965).
@TamaraHinton I’m confused by your tweet. This bill had 212 Ds and 19 Rs voting in favor.

@soltoseedfarm Are there home delivery companies right now that target low income consumers ? All the ones I’m aware of cater to affluent urbanites

@RiverRaccoon @prometheusgreen @ChrisClaytonDTN I found myself asking the same question and no one seems to have the answer.
@prometheusgreen @ChrisClaytonDTN And your skepticism is welcome!
@prometheusgreen @ChrisClaytonDTN Yeah I agree there are many unknowns. I think we convey that in the story. Probably a good idea to do more research.
@cowgirljesse @MarkSchatzker I guess it makes sense!
@cowgirljesse @MarkSchatzker I've talked to researchers who suggest  livestock folks know way more about plant nutrition for this very reason
@prometheusgreen @ChrisClaytonDTN Did you check out the studies linked on iron and protein? They go much more into the weeds on your Qs
@prometheusgreen @ChrisClaytonDTN Thanks, Val. I don't think we fully know that. Its tough when populations are all over the place on nutrition.
@RandallWest Thank you so much Randall. Really truly! This stuff drives me crazy having it fixed right away!

RT @agreilingkeane: And milk boxes (including those wasted) have a pretty high per-unit price. (says this parent) https://t.co/xF1e5dz3ec
Schools already get waivers for whole grains, so this is not a dramatic policy reversal. It's status quo.
School lunches are staying pretty much the same as they are now, actually. They just aren't going to get *less* salty in the future.
Trying to restrain myself from fact checking all the errors in school lunch stories today. You guys, school food is NOT getting saltier!
@snowcones I know that's a concern many have. I'm just saying that meals have changed a lot over the years.
Truth. https://t.co/MgoVeHWcIr
While we're talking school milk (so fun, right?), I have to say there's a massive amount of milk waste in cafeterias. It's hard to watch.
School lunch has changed a lot. As @SecretarySonny @SenPatRoberts touted more flexibility today, they ate greens grown by local Amish farmer
I like to think I sometimes chose the plain milk, but deep down I know the truth: It was only chocolate milk. Every single day.
Watching the outrage in some circles over 1% flavored milk while remembering that I drank nothing but 2% chocolate milk every day in school

USDA giving schools pretty much same flexibility they already have on whole grains, staving off Target 2 sodium cut- for now
