Part 4	To quote the talented, Joe Pesci - Ok Ok. 		All you liberals...you got your wish! Now, send your workers into housing projects and feed the residents. Counsel the unemployed. Comfort the unfortunate. And, preach to the home bodies?
Part 3 To quote the talented, Joe Pesci - Ok Ok. 		So who will walk the streets of mid America? The guns are gone and it‚Äôs completely safe? Who will go into the projects and help the poor without the fear of having a hospital named after them? The guns are gone.
Part 2		Millions are located and melted down. Some are thrown in rivers. Millions are gone. 		Ok? Tell me, what idiot thinks that no guns will be available to criminals, the mentally ill, terrorists, etc.? All the guns are supposed to be gone, right? All!
Posted by me on Facebook today:	 To quote the talented, Joe Pesci - Ok Ok. 		So we take away all the guns from gun owners. We spend money and months looking for them. Months and months!		We ask for owners to turn them in and, maybe, buy them back at $100 a piece.
