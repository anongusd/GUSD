Tony is at peace. He has worked so hard to entertain everyone else. I will always adore him, for all the time he's been on General Hospital. I was raising my family and GH was my passion. Thank you, Tony. Enjoy your "retirement". You earned it. https://t.co/NLzpZ8ib9D

@ansonmount Oh I just love him. Is he a snuggler? I lost my dog a year ago and I want a male dachshund to love and cuddle..too much $$ like $800 but when the time is right, I will have one! *smiling* enjoy your babies! Love your dogs!

Continuing..I am seeking a Dachshund. I have his name picked out..no, it isn't Leo..I have to save $$$. I live up North in Washington state. I would love some help finding a healthy pup in my state and not too costly. Thanks in advance for any help
well almost a year ago I put my Pekingnese, Leo, down. He lost his eyesight and the monthly meds I couldn't afford and honestly I didn't want him to live like that. I miss him dearly. So in a few months I am hoping to get a therapy dog for me. Fingers crossed.
