Senator Michael Bennet mentioned our advocate @Segokathy testimony about her son Hunter's struggle to afford his #insulin. @SenatorBennet said of her testimony "I don't think anyone here can understand how that can be the case, but it is the case"
During the hearing, @SenatorCarper asked the CEOs if they would support increasing transparency industry wide to lower prices. The ADA supports increasing transparency across the insulin supply chain. #MakeInsulinAffordable
Both @ChuckGrassley and @RonWyden have launched a bipartisan investigation into the rising cost of insulin. We applaud this effort to better understand why #insulin prices have skyrocketed. #MakeInsulinAffordable
In his opening statement, @RonWyden called out skyrocketing insulin prices saying that prices continued to soar despite the fact that the breakthrough on insulin was nearly 100 years ago in the "early roaring twenties" #MakeInsulinAffordable
We are living tweeting today during The Senate Finance Committee is meeting today as they discuss the high price of #insulin. Tune in.

These devices have already improved treatment for millions of Americans with diabetes. #BendTheCurve
Research funded by SDP has led to better disease management for millions of Americans, leading to the development of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which improve health outcomes and quality of life for people with #diabetes.
The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (#SDP) serves over ¾ of a million people each year, and SDP’s work has decreased kidney failure rates by more than 50%. #BendTheCurve
SDP-funded research at NIH improves lives. It led to the development of the first commercial artificial pancreas, which has the potential to reduce eye, kidney, nerve, and heart complications in those with diabetes. #RenewSDP #BendTheCurve

Senator Wyden says enough is enough of drug manufacturers taking advantage of the families with the high #drugprices And it ends today!
@Segokathy this is NOT a call for a handout or a way to allow those who live with #diabetes to be given a free ride. We just want to keep those 7million alive without having to do what my son thought was his only option to stay alive
@Segokathy: our family is not alone in this struggle. More than 7 million Americans use #insulin and more than 400,000 have signed the @AmDiabetesAssn petition calling for action to make #insulin more affordable for all those who need it.
@Segokathy: this doesn’t have to be this way! We hosted an exchange student from Hungary and her family flew us out to their home for a visit. While their we went to the pharmacy for #insulin and it cost $10! The same vial we pay $487 out of pocket in the US.
@Segokathy: Hunter needs insulin to live, but should that need for #insulin keep him from living?
@Segokathy: Hunter has these worries too. He wonders—Can he pay for an apartment? Utility bills? His student loans? Will he be able to have a social life? Take a girl on a date? The thing is, it really comes down to this:
@Segokathy: to generate other sources of money to pay for it all. Both my husband and I work 80 plus hours a week.
@Segokathy: “Our electricity was turned off because I needed to purchase the medicine that keeps my son alive. Almost every $ I make goes towards health expenses, yet the increasing cost of medicine and care keep us in an endless cycle of trying to find innovative ways”
@Segokathy: Thankfully for Hunter, we caught wind of this and he is okay today. But insulin rationing can lead to devastating—even deadly—complications, which I never want my son to experience.
@Segokathy: I found out that Hunter had decided to purchase one vial of insulin instead of the four vials he needed for the month. Unbeknownst to me and my husband, Hunter was rationing his insulin.
@Segokathy: “My energetic, athletic, and positive son was not himself. He seemed depressed. His grades dropped. He looked labored on the football field. His professors and coaches noticed the change, too.”
@Segokathy: For Hunter, and 3 every person who relies on it, insulin is as important as water or oxygen. Imagine if the one thing you relied on to survive was nearly out of reach because it was too expensive. That, for us, is insulin.
@Segokathy: An American Diabetes Association study estimates that diabetes costs a total of 327 billion dollars a year, but for my family, the true cost cannot be calculated.
@Segokathy is being introduced and welcomed!
Senator Wyden is disappointed in the pharmaceutical companies who have declined the invitation to attend today’s hearing. He is eager to work with the committee to get something done about the increased drug pricing.

“In summary - passage of the bill would greatly improve health outcomes and save health care dollars.”
However, not everyone can participate in programs like this patient—meaning that there are others living w/ similar issues who may end up being diagnosed with type 2.
Ms. Brunzell tells the story of a patient who dealt with serious health issues (depression, obesity, asthma) along with prediabetes. Using regular visits, Ms. Brunzell was able to help her lose 80 lbs. and maintain weight loss, avoiding a #T2D dx to this date.
“The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program is excellent, but it’s not enough.” —Ms. Brunzell
Prediabetes can be improved with MNT, but Medicare doesn’t cover MNT for people who have prediabetes—only those who have already been diagnosed with #T2D.
An alarming 7 out of 10 people eligible for Medicare have diabetes or prediabetes! That’s approximately HALF of Medicare recipients.
“The impact? We won’t be able to afford this in the future unless diabetes rates are decreased.” —Ms. Brunzell
“Economic burden [of diabetes] exceeds $1000/American in 2017, per @CDCgov.”
https://t.co/lIUq6ptVMk
This bill would allow Medicare to cover medical nutrition therapy to beneficiaries w/ #prediabetes or risk factors for #T2D.
Now speaking: Carol Brunzell, RD, LD, CDE discusses the Preventing Diabetes in Medicare Act (HR3124/S1299).
How to combat barriers to DSMT? The Expanding Access to DSMT Act (HR 5768) was introduced by @RepTomReed and @RepDianaDeGette to help.
#DSMT has been a covered Medicare benefit for 15 years however only 5% of Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed diabetes utilize DSMT.
#DSMT is cost-effective and saves the health care system money, reduces hospital admissions and readmissions and reduces lifetime health care costs related to a lower risk for complications. -Gtetchen Youssef
With DSMT, this patient will gain access to knowledge that can help him manage his diabetes on his own, saving him money and improving his health outcomes.
#DSMT Improves A1C by as much as 1% and Reduces the advancement of complications.
Now Ms. Youssef is following him virtually (not covered by Medicare) until his next appt.
“We spent a lot of time talking to him about when and where to take his insulin, as well as working with food banks to get food for him.”
This patient didn’t know how or when to take his insulin—not only was he taking it at times that weren’t helping, he was injecting in the same spot every day. He also only had $45 for food per month.
Ms. Youssef tells the story of one of her patients, who lives with #diabetes—and lives alone. He also has hypoglycemia unawareness.
This is why DSMT is so critical.
“PWD only see their PCPs or endocrinologist ~4 times/year...they need to be able to know how to take care of themselves 90% of the time.”
“Diabetes cost 327 billion dollars in 2017.” —Gretchen Youssef

@BrettR23 If BG control was better closer to the test, it could have affected the results. Please let us know if you have further questions, thanks!
@BrettR23 For example, while A1C results are said to measure BG over 2-3 months, the results are really weighted toward the most recent weeks.
@BrettR23 Low BG levels do affect A1C—however, variables like when the A1C test was completed and if the CGM was worn all the time can also affect it.
