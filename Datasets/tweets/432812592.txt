In life you'll realize that there is a purpose for every person you meet. Some will teach you, and some will bring out the best in you.
A dream becomes a goal when action is taken toward its achievement.
A strong person is one who cries &amp; sheds tears for the moment then gets up &amp; fights again.
Obstacles are things a person sees when he takes his eye off his goal. Be determined and reach your goals. #Lead2030

@onduhungirehe @_AfricanUnion @JapanGov proud of you !!
Stop beating yourself up. You are a work in progress; which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
What motivates me is the idea of changing how we are perceived by society. Show them that we can also do very important things for our communities, that we have a voice and are willing to build a better future. #YCA18
Without young people working on peace and security, the decision makers will not understand our needs. Young people need to be taken seriously and held responsible on their [youth-led] projects.	so excited to attend; #YCASummit2018 @YouthConnektAf #Lead2030 #YCA18 #Youth2030 https://t.co/XFpkC0trmz
If you dream it, believe it. If you can believe it go out there and achieve it!
Just because it's not what you were expecting, doesn't mean it's not everything you've been waiting for.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and start being positive about what could go right.
