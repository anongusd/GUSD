Today is the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  Or, as we call it in my neighborhood, Sunday.

In Stamford, we have a piece of paper taped to the door that says the name of our show.  I suppose this works too. http://t.co/MNCwoqM
Heading to 30 Rock for my first day of a month-long gig at MSNBC.
This afternoon I performed on stage at UCB for the first time.  AND I'm incredibly proud of my performance.  AND now I'm a little bit drunk.
Crazy how quick "I'm just gonna have 1 or 2 drinks" turns into "Let me say something else about the brilliance of Celine Dion..." at 1:30am.
Are you going to the 500 or Symphony on the Prairie? ‚Äú@DNoltingIndy: Healthiest packing for #indy500 yet! http://t.co/zV2EBrH‚Äù
2 weeks into my vacation.  Still busy as ever - but now I'm also traveling, writing, or performing every day.  Feels pretty damn good.

I was able to rationalize ordering a classic St Elmo's Shrimp Cocktail from Harry and Izzy's before 9 am.  A steak is gonna be pushing it.
Last night's flight to LGA canceled. This morning's flight overbooked. I knew they were fighting to keep college grads in Indy, but come on!
My little brother is a pimp.  Dozens of young girls are flirting with him, but he keeps it cool by throwing them a head nod and a "Sup?"
Went kayaking at Eagle Creek this afternoon and had a spectacular dinner with the family.  Back to NYC tomorrow.
Goodfellas is on A&E.  How do I set an alert on my phone to tell me whenever this happens?
I don't have any idea what this means.  Compliment or insult? ‚Äú@JennyJohnsonHi5: Lady Gaga's tits look like they're ready for bed. #SNL‚Äù
Just woke up.  Trying to determine if I was Raptured or Left Behind.  Do people in Heaven have to pee?
It's a beautiful day. I'm a little hoarse from rocking out in the Jeep with the windows down. And I'm at Arni's: http://yfrog.com/h0gqoeloj
Sure hope "It Gets Better" for those kids soon - because tomorrow is the Rapture and there will probably be more bullying.
@Im_Tricia Agreed. I also like that we live in a world where Don Draper AND Roger Sterling each have their own car commercials.

Rounding up the usual suspects and heading over to Kingston Mines.  Come on - baby, don't you wanna go?
@socialJacqui Why didn't you tell me they renovated our Starbucks?   It looks like a Pottery Barn now!
Gonna bro it up on this cold Chicago morning with some beer, some wings, and some Bridesmaids.  Like a boss.
The perfect end to any Chicago night is a "chocolate milkshake" at Wiener's Circle: http://yfrog.com/hsczbzuj
I can't say enough good things about the new Second City Main Stage show "South Side of Heaven." Absolutely incredible.  I'm speechless.
When did the Starbucks beneath Second City get redesigned?  I feel like I'm drinking coffee at a Pottery Barn.
Dear Airlines: thanks for offering me window/aisle AND paper/mobile ticket.  Now how about hot girl/old Indian dude who smells like curry.

My little brother: "Just hanging out. Went to grand opening of a restaurant and attempted to eat 2 pounds of Italian beef - and could not."
@jacobccamp Jake, that's not a double entendre.  In your case they both mean the same thing.

I'll never forget where I was when I heard the news: calling hookers on Backpage to come on my show.
Watched the entire White House Correspondents Dinner on my commute. Absolutely hilarious!  Well done @sethmeyers21 and @BarackObama.
I once complained about having no stories, until I met a man who had no legs.  And then I booked him for my show.  The end.
