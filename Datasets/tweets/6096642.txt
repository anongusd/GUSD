As previously predicted, the guy is not taking the job in Denver, and she's probably going to move to Christmas and run her company's investment in the town #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
Oooh now she's conflicted because she's worried that building the resort there will ruin Christmas		#WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
"You'll know it when you meet the right person. Some things just can't be rushed."	#WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
She just used the words "right opportunity" to describe how she finds jobs and...I feel seen and am not sure how I feel about that		#WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
It is kind of adorable that the entire town is banding together to convince her to pick them #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
"We just have to get her to fall in love with the town," the sheriff's (mom? aunt?) asserts.		Or HIM		Ahem		#WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
@wwcummings This would be a very different movie
She lives in Denver and he has a job offer in Denver??		Wouldn't it be amazing if at the end, she didn't move for a man and he took a job opportunity that had nothing to do with love and then they end up together?		(It won't happen) #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
I relate to both the small child who is super excited for Christmas and the apathetic teenager who just wants everyone to leave her alone so she can read her book #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
OH are they kind of holding her hostage by saying her car is out of service for the weekend. And they've made up a festival of lights.		Bless them. #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
"Santa's 2nd favorite town after the North Pole." Oh goodness #WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark
Interestingly enough, the town WANTS the big corporation to come in and build, which feels like a shift from other Christmas movies I've watched		#WelcomeToChristmas #jesstweetshallmark

Update: I've added more recent context to this story.
This is coming up again as zero tolerance policy draws scrutiny, so I'd like to emphasize:	- This describes 3 different policy issues at play	- This was published *before* DHS reported the number of separations that took place in April and May	- The facts have *not* changed https://t.co/h3OXmgsehV
@creativetechnic @ejmontini Those are all the facts I have. As @ejmontini notes in his piece, "It‚Äôs difficult to know how many children have been removed from their parents."		I'm happy to discuss this more if you'd like to email me: jestepa@usatoday.com
@creativetechnic @ejmontini The 1,475 unaccompanied minors that the May 29 story references children who arrived in the United States and then were released to sponsors in 2017, prior to the zero tolerance policy announced this year in April.
@creativetechnic @ejmontini Since that story published on May 29, we have learned that the enforcement of the zero tolerance policy has led to nearly 2,000 children being separated from adults at the border in a six-week period. That is new information, but doesn't change the facts of the original story.
@creativetechnic @ejmontini Hi, Nathan. As my story from a few weeks ago stated, there are 3 different issues being conflated:	- unaccompanied minors at the border	- the zero tolerance policy being enforced by the Trump administration, which is leading to border separations	- cracking down on asylum seekers

As a final note on this, Nunberg is one of the only people who is directly quoted in #FireAndFury and was perfectly fine with owning up to it back when this was causing a furor in January (oh January, how long ago you were)		https://t.co/gE8QhnDFnQ
Final mention comes on the last page before the epilogue. Described as "generally regarded as the man who understood Trump's whims and impulses best"		"'Nunberg always knows,' said Schwartz. Seconds later, Schwartz looked up... Then he said: 'Nunberg says Bannon's dead.'"
The evolution of Nunberg, from aide to "former Trump loyalist who was now wholly a Bannon loyalist" by the end of #FireAndFury and thought Bannon would run Trump re-election campaign		"'If you can get this idiot elected twice,' Nunberg marveled."
Apparently in a call to Bannon about Anthony Scaramucci potentially becoming White House comms director		"He, too, was calling about Scaramucci, and his words caused something like stupefaction in Bannon: 'No fucking, fucking way.'"
He's also mentioned as one of Bannon's "off-balance-sheet communications staff...even though he had long fallen out with Trump himself"
And then later, during another Bannon chapter		"One of the worst things is when he believes you've succeeded at his expense," explained Sam Nunberg, once on the inside of the Trump circle, then cast to the outside. 'If your win is in any way perceived as his loss, phew.'"
Then we skip ahead to a passage on Gary Cohn vs. Steve Bannon		"Much of this was retailed to reporters by Sam Nunberg, the former Trump factotum who was now doing duty for Bannon. Nunberg was frank about his tactics: 'I beat the shit out of Gary whenever possible.'"
Nunberg on Trump		"'Is Trump a good person, an intelligent person, a capable person?' asked Sam Nunberg, Trump's longtime political aide. 'I don't even know. But I know he's a star.'"
Nunberg also was the one who claimed to talk to Trump about the Constitution		"Sam Nunberg was sent to explain the Constitution to the candidate: 'I got as far as the Fourth Amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.'"
In passage about the dysfunction of the campaign		"Sam Nunberg, a Trump aide who had worked for Stone, was noisily ousted by Lewandowski, and then Trump exponentially increased the public dirty-clothes-washing by suing Nunberg."
Described in this passage as an "on-again, off-again aide" for the Trump campaign:		"'But do you want to be president?' Nunberg asked... Nunberg did not get an answer."
I was off yesterday, so apologies for the lateness of this thread, but Sam Nunberg is quoted multiple times in #FireAndFury. Let's take a look at what he says.

Mention of Josh Kushner, brother of Jared and boyfriend of Karlie Kloss, on advising Jared and Ivanka not to take White House jobs		Josh did it "not only to protect his brother but also because of his antipathy to Trump"		#fireandfurybook
Why sign the travel ban executive order on a Friday?		"'Err...that's why,' said Bannon. 'So the snowflakes would show up at the airports and riot.' That was the way to crush the liberals: make them crazy and drag them left."		#fireandfurybook
"Sean Spicer, whose job was literally to explain what people did and why, often simply could not‚Äîbecause nobody really had a job, because nobody could do a job."		#fireandfurybook
Then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly not a fan of the immigration executive order issued by the White House: He "would carry a grudge about the disarray caused by the immigration EO"		#fireandfurybook
And then the tides turn		"'What's up with Steve?' Kushner began to ask. And then, 'Is something wrong with Steve?' And then finally, 'I don't understand. We were so close.'"		#fireandfurybook
One GOP figure told Kushner: "If you fuck with the intel community they will figure out a way to get back at you and you'll have two or three years of a Russian investigation, and every day something else will leak out."		#fireandfurybook
That's quite an opening line to a chapter		"Jared Kushner at thirty-six prided himself on his ability to get along with older men."		#fireandfurybook
Jim Baker, chief of staff under Reagan and George H. W. Bush, told Reince Priebus not to take the job under Trump. #fireandfurybook
Why isn't Chris Christie in the administration? Two words: Jared and Ivanka.		"Ivanka told her father that Christie's appointment as chief of staff or to any high position would be extremely difficult for her and her family."		#fireandfurybook
"Reince Priebus...noted, with alarm, how often Trump offered people jobs on teh spot, many of whom he had never met before, for positions whose importance Trump did not particularly understand."		#fireandfurybook
More on Russia		"The charge that Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election, which he scoffed at, was, in the estimation of some of his friends, a perfect example of his inability to connect the dots."		#fireandfurybook
Unnamed Trump friend likens Trump to Bill Clinton, book then continues:		"One manifestation of this outlaw personality, for both Trump and Clinton, was their brand of womanizing ‚Äî and indeed, harassing."		#fireandfurybook
On self-awareness: Trump, apparently trying to win over a fellow billionaire's date by getting her to go to Atlantic City to tour his casino		"'What is this "white trash"?' asked the model.	'They're people just like me,' said Trump, 'only they're poor.'"		#fireandfurybook
"'Is Trump a good person, an intelligent person, a capable person?' asked Sam Nunberg, Trump's longtime political aide. 'I don't even know. But he's a star.'"	#fireandfurybook
"Roger Stone, Trump's longtime political adviser, explained to Steve Bannon that Trump's psychic makeup made it impossible for him to take such a close look at himself. Nor could he tolerate knowing that somebody else would then know a lot about him."	#fireandfurybook

The Mike Flynn line I‚Äôve noted before: Him taking $45K to speak at an @RT_com event ‚Äúwould only be a problem if we won.‚Äù #fireandfurybook
Related, the Constitution line: ‚ÄúEarly in the campaign, in a Producers-worthy scene, Sam Nunberg was sent to explain the Constitution to the candidate: ‚ÄòI got as far as the Fourth Amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.‚Äô‚Äù
The next line references The Producers, so I offer you this re: Trump campaign		https://t.co/S0GYoVRsN2		#fireandfurybook
‚ÄúHe offered his wife a solemn guarantee: there was simply no way he would win. And even for a chronically‚Äîhe would say helplessly‚Äîunfaithful husband, this was one promise to his wife that he seemed sure to keep.‚Äù #fireandfurybook
On Donald and Melania: ‚ÄúStill, the notion that this was a marriage in name only was far from true. He spoke of Melania frequently when she wasn‚Äôt there. He admired her looks... She was, he told people proudly and without irony, a ‚Äòtrophy wife.‚Äô‚Äù #fireandfurybook

How to get Trump to loan his campaign money, per #fireandfurybook 		‚ÄúSteve Mnuchin, then the campaign‚Äôs finance chairman, came to collect the loan with the wire instructions ready to go, so Trump couldn‚Äôt conveniently forget to send the money.‚Äù
Back and need a TON of coffee, but first, to answer a question: Who were the losers on Trump‚Äôs campaign?	Everyone.	‚Äú‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all losers,‚Äô he would say. ‚ÄòAll our guys are terrible, nobody know what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äô‚Äù	#fireandfurybook
And with that find, I‚Äôm out. More tweets later.
Title of the book found on page 11: ‚ÄúDonald Trump and his tiny band of campaign warriors were ready to lose with fire and fury. They were not ready to win.‚Äù #fireandfurybook
Nonbelievers in campaign win: Conway, Kushner, Trump himself	Believer: ‚ÄúOnly Steve Bannon, in his odd-man view, insisted the numbers would break in their favor. But this being Bannon‚Äôs view‚Äîcrazy Steve‚Äîit was quite the opposite of being a reassuring one.‚Äù	#fireandfurybook
Ailes on Trump/Murdoch:‚ÄùBut Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert. Like for Putin. Sucks up and shits down. I just worry about who‚Äôs jerking whose chain.‚Äù	#fireandfurybook
Bannon, continued: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Russia is so key....Is Russia that bad? They‚Äôre bad guys, but the world is full of bad guys.‚Äù	Ailes replies: ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs good to know the bad guys are the bad guys. Donald may not know.‚Äù	#fireandfurybook
Bannon: ‚ÄúDay one we‚Äôre moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.‚Äù		Not quite, but...		#fireandfurybook
#fireandfurybook: Trump asked Ailes to run his campaign. Ailes turned him down, and job went to Bannon a week later.
I need to go to bed but reading #fireandfurybook anyway.		‚ÄúPoliticians were front men in a complex organizational effort. Operatives knew the game, and so did most candidates and officeholders. But Ailes was pretty sure Trump did not. Trump was undisciplined.‚Äù

Margaret‚Äôs father is literally the last person to figure out that Thornton has feelings for Margaret #northandsouth
Every year, you ask, and every year, the answer never changes #northandsouth https://t.co/TRbo7UenOA
