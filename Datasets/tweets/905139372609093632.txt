@DerekTonkin1 It is good thinking. Because we all Myanmar know they are Bengalis from Bangladesh. If they pretend as Myanmar ethnics, we can't accept it.
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma I am sorry for `they¬¥ word &amp; doleful photos. We grieve for innocent Myanmar ethnics. For these reasons we can't believe Bengalis.
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma I don't think so. There was many problems. She is a Rakhine girl `Ma Thida Htwe¬¥. She had been raped &amp; killed brutally by Bengalis in 2012. https://t.co/d98xdb8NWn
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma All migrants deserve protection. OK I agree. And how about protection for native civilians? They threaten security of Myanmar community. https://t.co/to9Nfk29gG
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma The Bengali men have many wives &amp; no contraception. So their population growth rate is very high. They were majority not minority in Rakhine
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma Can you accept all illegal immigrants as citizens and give equal rights in your country?
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma Let me use `they¬¥ word because they are not Myanmar ethnics. They came from Bangladesh illegally across the border &amp; committed terrorisms. https://t.co/5HdsLC9b2U
@EUAmbSchmidt @DemocVoiceBurma The Bengalis also killed many innocent Hindus. All Myanmar civilians afraid them &amp; don't want to live with them. https://t.co/CPyclatjco
