That's what I assumed. But that's different than framing policies specifically as a response to racial injustice or as "reparations" is it not? It's the difference that extends back to William Julius Wilson and his classic books during the 1980s. https://t.co/A2tm5E0Yrm
Doesn't endorsing "universal programs" suggest a conclusion about whether or not Democrats should frame any component of their agenda as "reparations," as some have done? Isn't that a genuine choice, not just a controversy driven by media or consultants? @ThePlumLineGS https://t.co/xR5ANVnWjj

Trump's calculated belligerence &amp; vulgarity at #TrumpCPACLive evidence he believes he wins by showing a blue-collar/evangel base he will break rules to "protect" them. But he's reinforcing exactly the behavior that alienated so many financially thriving white-collar voters in '18
Speech at #TRUMPCPACLIVE encapsulates Trump's central political messaging: convincing his supporters they are "under siege" from contemptuous elites &amp; dangerous minorities &amp; then presenting himself as the one barrier-the human wall-who will "protect you" from those forces.
Trump was talking specifically about 2nd Amendment, but he still summarized his central overall '20 message in #TRUMPCPACLIVE when he said "it's under siege...but I'll protect you, I promise you that" And "We will defend the American way of life." Restoration is his core promise.
Amid all the free association, Trump today reaffirms his core message: he presents himself as the wall for his supporters against all the forces-immigrants, Democrats who hate America, socialists, elite colleges-that he says are threatening or contemptuous of them. #TRUMPCPACLIVE

In 2018 @Gallup, Trump approval w/non-col whites is 54% in MI &amp; PA, 50% in WI. But it's 73% in GA, 67% NC, 66% TX, 61% FL, 59% AZ. The gap is similar w/col+ whites. Puts premium on mobilizing minorities in Sunbelt &amp; reassuring whites in Rustbelt. https://t.co/9eBAAgAzFJ
In key Rustbelt states Trump's approval w/both college+ &amp; non-col whites has fallen below ntl average in @Gallup 2018 data. But in key Sunbelt states his white approval is  &gt; ntl avg. Ds may need 2 reassure whites in former, mobilize non-whites in latter.  https://t.co/9eBAAgAzFJ
New @Gallup results show Trump is vulnerable for 2020 in both Rustbelt &amp; Sunbelt states he won last time. But to seize that opportunity, Democrats face very different challenges in each region. Can one candidate meet both tests? My take. https://t.co/9eBAAgAzFJ

A Democratic House might pass universal gun background checks, legalize DREAMers, block border wall (already has), promote clean energy, strengthen #ACA &amp; maybe reduce corporate tax cuts. @HowardSchultz has already endorsed all those ideas. The R Senate won't accept any of them https://t.co/wYjbJARMOy
And to obscure his tilt toward the Democrats on almost all issues, Schultz has quickly settled on a strategy of loudly criticizing ideas popular on the party’s far-left flank.

It’s hard to imagine, as he becomes better known, the views @HowardSchultz has presented—from opposition to a #borderwall to support for gun control, action on #ClimateChange &amp; improving #ACA—will attract many voters drawn to Trump’s racial nationalism.  https://t.co/4mzTJ8V4IR

Trump hasn't expanded support for #BorderWall much beyond hard-core base opposed to any #immigration. Only ~1/3 of US backs less legal immigration, but 70% of them also back a wall. But 4/5 of those who back more legal immigration oppose wall; so do 2/3 who would keep it same
For many conservatives, the point of eliminating the state &amp; local tax deduction was to make it harder for blue states to raise taxes.

Under Trump, the GOP is strong in the places least touched by demographic/social change. But after 18, Ds now hold 32/40 Senate seats in 20 states w/highest % of immigrants. In House they hold &gt;80% of seats &gt;diverse than avg &amp; nearly 90% w/more immigrants. https://t.co/Y60OhuaLIG

The single most misleading line in #SOTU was Trump's claim to support legal #immigration after he's proposed to cut it by &gt;40%. But nothing he said revealed more about how he is reshaping the GOP &amp; walling off the party from diverse America. My take.https://t.co/Y60OhuaLIG

Not sure on that. But it's usually more influential 2 be alone than early (except IA/NH/SC). Like PA then, there are always some primaries where everybody moves in for a week.

Given the southern/non-southern split through most of the party's history, and the more recent urban/rural divide (with its own regional overtones), this suburban-centered party could prove the most ideologically &amp; geographically cohesive majority House Dems have ever elected https://t.co/KIVehfScn1
In 09/10, the rural/metro split among House Ds made climate &amp; health care hard &amp; pushed #Immigration &amp; #guncontrol off the table. All of those issues may be much easier for this new suburban-centered majority. Instead, the key divide now may be taxes &amp; spending. https://t.co/lLxnVRWGgP
In 09, Dems from rural seats were &gt; 1/3 of their House caucus. Now it's &lt;1/6. In 09, 47 Dems held seats that voted for McCain &amp; Bush 04. Now, just 14 hold seats that backed Trump &amp; Romney. The 09 majority relied on seats trending away from Ds; this one on seats moving toward them https://t.co/Aos6qIBWfj
Compared to the last majority in 2009, the Democratic House majority assuming power today will likely be easier to manage legislatively and to defend electorally. Here's why. https://t.co/Aos6qIBWfj
In key ways, the last Democratic House majority in '09 looked back to what the party had been.

Dems won the House popular vote by the largest margin ever in a mid-term in raw votes &amp; by a larger % margin than the Rs did in their 94 &amp; 2010 landslides.

GOP pollster @KSoltisAnderson : "There has not been an appetite for a course correction or a change in approach [among Rs]. So it would surprise me if there was a concerted effort to try win over more young voters between now and the 2020 election." https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0
Alternate description? https://t.co/AWhOuX9YH1
Compared to the last mid-term in 2014, the share of vote cast by &lt;45 grew this year nationally &amp; in key states such as AZ, TX &amp; GA, per preliminary data from @Catalist_US . But that share will likely be much higher yet in 2020, in Sunbelt/Rustbelt alike. https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0
"The disapproval of Trump &amp; the views of him as being racist &amp; sexist that we saw [among young people] in 16, was somewhat muted by not loving Hillary Clinton," says Dem pollster @abaumania . "But it just got amplified after him being in power for 2 years" https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0
The GOP's problems with Millennials precede Trump, but he's compounding them: in the 2018 exits 66% of voters aged 18-29 &amp; 62% of those aged 30-44 said they disapproved of his performance. In each group, just over half said they strongly disapproved https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0
Even w/higher than usual 2018 turnout among young people, its likely voters &lt;45 will constitute much more of the electorate in 2020. And this year they voted for Democrats w/the largest margins in decades.  https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0
The biggest difference in the electorate between this year &amp; 2020 is likely to be that voters younger than 45 will cast much more of the vote in 2 years. That's an ominous prospect for Republicans given how many younger voters Trump has alienated. My take https://t.co/X7wEmYCKG0

Mid-terms don't reliably predict the next presidential, but Democrats emerged from the 2018 results w/opportunities for '20 in both Sunbelt &amp; Rustbelt. Previously unpublished exit poll data offer new insights on how they rank. https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
In GA, TX, OH college+ white women split about evenly over Trump's job performance in exits. In other '20 battlegrounds about 3/5 or more disapproved, including ~ 2/3 in PA, MI, WI. https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
A headwind for Ds on contesting new Sunbelt opportunities: Trump approval  &gt; 80% (!) among non-col white men &amp; women in GA; in TX, its 76% for men, 58% women. Its still high, but much lower for him in Rustbelt.  https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
"The narrow overall verdict on Trump's first two years in the exit polls suggests that all of these Sun Belt states could be competitive in 2020. But the results do raise red flags for each side." https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
"In most places, Dems were frustrated by their inability to recover more ground with working-class white women. But in the three states where those women will likely matter most in 2020, PA MI WI, they displayed clear second thoughts about Trump." https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
Trump showed conspicuous weakness with women in all three states. With col+ white women his disapproval hit 69% PA, 67% MI, 64% WI. His disapproval rating in all 3 w/white women w/out college degrees hit 46%-48%, more than any other battleground state.  https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX
Previously unpublished results from the 2018 exit poll underscore Trump's erosion in MI, PA &amp; WI, the three "blue wall" he dislodged in 2016. Key: His #s there are weaker than in other battlegrounds not only w/col+ white women, but also non-col. https://t.co/7W8Nncm7EX

To pick one: ~ 3/4 of white women Trump voters say women fighting discrimination are often seeking "special favors"; 3/5 of HRC white wmn voters said that is never the case. https://t.co/XPnHkBUEc2 https://t.co/R3z3G0vfOQ
Also Ds reached 63% w/college white women in MI &amp; 55% in AZ. Clinton won only 46% of col+ white women in AZ. She won 34% in GA vs. 43% for Abrams. She won 37% in FL vs 57% (!) for Gillum. She won 45% in NV vs 59% for Rosen. Something real happened w/those women on Tuesday. https://t.co/6uUs1LsYMA
And even tho non-college white women still tilted strongly R in most places, Ds reached 48% or more w/them in Senate races in PA, OH &amp; WI &amp; 45% in MI. Those are exactly where they will most need those women to compete in 2020, as @StanGreenberg will remind you. (OH still tough) https://t.co/R3z3G0vfOQ
Not only did Ds win 59% of col+ white women in House (most ever in exits), but also carried 57% of them in FL Gov. In Senate, won 69% PA, 66% WI, 61% WV, 59% OH, MO, NV and split at 49% in TX. Abrams only 43%, but overall she won 40% col+ whites big gain from Carter 14 (just 30%) https://t.co/R3z3G0vfOQ

The underlying polarization over Trump has created a mid-term result that is unusually divergent: Democrats may win 35 or more House seats, at the high end of expectations, + governors &amp; still feel disappointed by defeats of their young Sunbelt hopes &amp; retreat in the Senate. https://t.co/f9LT6SLywF
In fact, it's the kind of place where Trump's focus on shoring up culturally conservative blue-collar &amp; non-urban support should bolster Rs: over 80% white, below national average in education and income, even with urban portion. https://t.co/afyzhatYsl
Again the numbers may change, but 47% of voters say they strongly disapprove of Trump. In 2010, 92% of strong Obama disapprovers voted Republican. In 2006, 91% of strong W. Bush approvers voted Democratic. Much stronger tilt toward opposition party than the somewhat disapprovers https://t.co/b2V1uFsu6P
Trump approval a key number to watch: In final pre-election polls from both CNN &amp; ABC/Washington Post about 90% of Trump approvers were voting Republican for House and 90% of disapprovers Democratic. That’s at a new peak, but not vastly more than recent experience in mid terms https://t.co/2D9zoRCeNM

Also blunting GOP normal turnout edge: seniors, who rise as % of mid-term vote, are only +3 for Rs in ABC/WP. They were +16 GOP in 2014 exit. Still, poll underscores D stake in more than usual youth turnout: they are +23 with 18-39. That's a bill on Trump GOP may pay for years. https://t.co/OShbTXveC8
Trickle down? ABC/WP shows broad optimism about overall state of economy but also hints as to why it hasn't lifted GOP more: only about 1/3 of both college &amp; non-college whites &amp; one-sixth of non-whites say they are personally "better off financially" than when Trump took office. https://t.co/OShbTXveC8
Reinforcing that possibility: in final ABC/WP college whites, who give Dems a double-digit margin overall, remain considerably more likely to say they are certain to vote than non-college whites or minorities. That would dilute GOP's usual mid-term turnout mix edge. https://t.co/dzjFGcu5dw
Final ABC/WP show Dems running 20 (!) points better w/college whites (54%) than non-college (34%), raising odds of sharp divergence between suburban &amp; non-metro House seats. That historic gap would confirm &amp; deepen the divisions of '16, as I argue here. https://t.co/7vyNbIXxUg

New @HarvardIOP poll finds #Millennial engagement way up from '14, Trump approval w/them at just 26% &amp; preferring Dems for Congress 66-32. Tilt of 18 battlefield toward older/less diverse places may somewhat mute, but it's a sign of how Trump is defining GOP w/younger generations
That is a key point: a central pillar of Trump's messaging to his base is that they are under siege from threats that don't look like them, and he is their last line of defense against them. Division is a feature, not a bug, of his strategy: it is the oxygen he relies on. https://t.co/R8jEns43N4

Not sure we are getting anywhere anymore. I’ve always liked your work but I will just repeat: when you say we are all part of the problem in the context of Trumps behavior, as you did in your tweet, I believe you minimize his uniquely dangerous role in inflaming division for gain https://t.co/OkiZ6dX9cz
This is what you wrote that I responded to: “ME: The prez obviously has a special responsibility, but we’re all part of the problem.” That to me appears to minimize Trump’s unique role  in promoting division as a conscious political strategy. But if I’m wrong let me know. https://t.co/IBanaOAN9L
I don’t think I was criticizing but I would say I believe that in much commentary the unique nature of Trump’s role in dividing not as a byproduct but as a goal gets lost when placed as just 1 of many factors explaining our situation - it’s uniquely dangerous, as is GOP deference https://t.co/j2h9sxq1mM
For all the forces of division in US, which are powerful, Trump is unique in seeking to systematically inflame them-to convince one group of Americans they are under siege from another that doesn’t look like them. There’s been nothing comparable since Wallace &amp; costs are rising https://t.co/gq1NIKyY2u
I wrote a book on it too, 11 years ago. Divisions certainly predate Trump but placing him in context of ‘everyone does it’ to me minimizes his unique role in exploiting and inflaming them &amp; the GOP’s decision to defend that strategy. No prez has divided US so deliberately https://t.co/gq1NIKyY2u
From a leading conservative thinker and strategist since the Reagan Administration. Is there a single Republican in Congress who would say this in public? https://t.co/QD3rhpuimJ
In that way the determination to defend Trump even in aftermath of these attacks may be the clearest measure yet of how unlikely it is that a GOP majority Congress will ever constrain or even question him in any meaningful way: if not now when? https://t.co/JVq9qXVqeT
GOP refusal to acknowledge impact of Trump language/message on extremist violence raises the question of what conceivable costs to society could cause elected Rs to reject his political strategy of constant division, which has provided them the votes to advance conservative goals https://t.co/4Hy3fzj7ez
A serious ?: will you name any political figure in either party since Wallace who you think has been as determined to divide the country, demonize his opponents &amp; promote racial division as Trump?

The GOP drive to undo #ACA has reached historic length. After FDR signed #socialsecurity in 35, GOP ran on repeal in 36, but never again. After LBJ signed Medicare/Medicaid in 65, Nixon didn't urge repeal in 68. This will be 5th election GOP opposes #ACA. https://t.co/Nha0CWxdOA

For the first time since Obama signed the #ACA in 2010, Republicans are on the defensive over #healthcare in an election. But that doesn't mean they will abandon their efforts to repeal the ACA if they maintain control of Congress. My take. https://t.co/ICsoHPb9OA

In 06/10/14 mid-terms,exits found 84-87% of voters who approved of the president’s performance voted for his party’s House candidates, while 82-84% of disapprovers voted vs them. Polls show those #s nearing 90% in 18, a big threat to GOP in suburban seats https://t.co/7l0bzeg5hz

Wow: gender/age combo in new Post/ABC #Kavanaugh poll shows the generational pressures that will grow as a changing America collides w/5-man GOP #SCOTUS majority:  70% (!) of women 18-49 support more investigation into charges vs him &amp; 64% of such women oppose his confirmation.
The increased energy on right post #kavanaugh may push out of reach some House seats on periphery of D target list that Trump carried. That increases need for party to max out in the 25 GOP seats that Clinton won-where white-collar women are backing Dems in historic numbers https://t.co/LsMFBJwBfj
The Rs defending Clinton-won House seats are the most threatened by Trump’s relentless tilt to his base.

I've been betting on option 2 all cycle so will stay there. Trump's presidency tends to reinforce divides &amp; accelerate existing trends.

@DinoRossiWA is well-known &amp; energetic, &amp; w/its blue-collar &amp; rural pieces, #WA-08 isn't as anti-Trump as purely suburban seats. But @DrKimSchrier benefits from huge volunteer/$ energy &amp; possibility that anti-Trump white-collar suburbs will cast &gt; share of vote than usual https://t.co/YXs846eBa7
GOP nominee Rossi embraces the R tax cut. But he has refused to answer how he might vote on a wide variety of issues beyond that. Although he ran in his 2010 Senate race as #ACA opponent, he has refused to say now whether he would have voted for the House GOP bill to repeal it https://t.co/YXs846eBa7
"On one side of that divide is growing Dem strength in white-collar suburbs recoiling from Trump; on the other is continued Repub dominance in rural places and blue-collar communities that flocked to Trump in 2016, and haven’t wavered much since" @DrKimSchrier @DinoRossiWA https://t.co/Qt6G2ooVJj
Sprawling from white-collar suburbs near Seattle through apple-growing rural areas across the Cascades, the #Washington-08 CD encapsulates the Trump era's core geographic divide in one House seat. Not surprisingly, it's close-and revealing. My report. https://t.co/nNemlPknbD
From top Hispanic pollster in August: “it's a little too soon to push the panic button, but having said that, we are not seeing the types of #s with Hispanic voters that we should be seeing w/the most hostile person to ever hold public office against Hispanics as the President” https://t.co/jezuM2qhKU
Not just TX and Nevada: challenge for Dems is that if Hispanic turnout is low what’s left to participate usually tilts older &amp; more conservative. Still, party has far more infrastructure to improve that in NV than TX. https://t.co/XIh6FsaAgi https://t.co/87kRZvvyQ5
Trump may not be enough to swing Latino turnout Democrats' way - CNNPolitics https://t.co/XIh6FsaAgi
A reminder of how much tougher Southern suburbs are for Dems: O’Rourke at 40% w/college whites which is progress from Wendy Davis in 14 (~30) but not quite enough to get close since GOP lead w/non-col whites is extra large in these Southern states. Trump @56% w/TX col whites too https://t.co/8cYEYzlOmU
RT @StevieVanZandt: All due respect, why are hundreds of people sending me Bruce lyrics?!? I know them. Thank you. https://t.co/ZXZwc0Gz7l
And TX is not the only place Ds are facing this problem in 18. The issue may not be only enthusiasm, but the link between margin &amp; turnout. When Hispanic turnout drops, what's usually left is older &amp; more conservative, so D margin drops too. A double whammy 4 Beto &amp; other Ds now https://t.co/kkqPBWQeLE
