@actual_biscuit @SweetJeniM @RealSaavedra @dbongino I‚Äôve been an appellate lawyer for 15 years. That doesn‚Äôt make me special and I prefer not to use it to bolster my arguments. However, I can‚Äôt pretend it isn‚Äôt demonstrably and completely incorrect to say that we‚Äôve seen ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù that Trump did anything illegal.
@SweetJeniM @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino That doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be evidence that proves Trump is not guilty. I don‚Äôt know what Mueller or others with full access know. Based on the evidence I‚Äôve seen, obstruction and campaign fin. violations are very likely, financial crimes and/or collusion are probable.
@SweetJeniM @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre stupid. Most non-lawyers misunderstand what evidence is. Evidence is simply anything that makes a conclusion more or less true. There are dozens of publicly released facts that make it more true that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to get elected.
@jbd10611 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Pray for both of our ignorance just in case you are unaware of your own blind spots. I will do the same.
@jbd10611 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Are you also praying for the ‚Äúignorance‚Äù of America‚Äôs entire intelligence community, who has seen 100 times more evidence than either of us and come to the same conclusion as me?
@jbd10611 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Everyone with access to the classified information has concluded that Russia helped Trump get elected. The only thing that still needs to be confirmed is whether the Trump campaign knew about it or, worse, colluded. Publicly released evidence indicates that they knew and colluded
@mattjoneswallet @SweetJeniM @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I disagree with your characterization but it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of that is any kind of defense to the evidence against the Trump team.
@pbconley @williamskentm @JacobAWohl Not true. It was outrageous and we were all outraged about it, including the MSM. That‚Äôs why Clinton waited until his presidency was over.
@SweetJeniM @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I don‚Äôt think you fully understand what evidence is. You may not think there is sufficient reliable evidence to convict at this point based on the publicly released evidence but we‚Äôve already seen plenty of evidence of Trump illegally colluding with Russia.
I‚Äôll give Ms. Ocasio-Cortez a little room to make some beginner‚Äôs errors but her message could fairly be read as a completely inappropriate threat to use subpoena power for illegal ends and she should be less dismissive of the complaints. I hope she grows into the job. https://t.co/tKMhKvE3QU

@LarryS500 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino You don‚Äôt think the DNC leak cost votes with the Bernie wing? You don‚Äôt think the Podesta leak cost votes with centrists? You don‚Äôt think the social media manipulation both cost HRC votes and turned out Trump votes? It was only a percentage or two that needed to be swung.
@Sig45Mike @linda_also @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino You were directly responding to a question about bias
@Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I understand why her lies and arguably criminal actions made both of us not want to vote for her. I decided Trump was a disaster who appears to have done at least as much arguably criminal actions so I was forced to vote for HRC. If it had been any other R, I would have voted R.
@LarryS500 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Trump‚Äôs (and his team‚Äôs) interactions with Russians and his treatment of Russian issues are strong circumstantial evidence of collusion. However, I would need more evidence than what is publicly available to indict him. Maybe Mueller has it. Maybe not.
@LarryS500 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I am confident that Trump would not have won without the Russians given the small margin of the election. I am not confident this is scientifically verifiable but it is obvious.
@Sig45Mike @linda_also @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I skimmed the Gohmert report at the beginning and realized it was off the topic of accusations Mueller is a partisan. Gohmert is also far from a credible voice. I‚Äôm not going to do 45 pages of off topic information.
@LarryS500 @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Then we can agree that is idiotic.
@Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino What portion of the code that is traditionally prosecuted did she violate?

@actual_biscuit @Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @RealSaavedra @dbongino Only raise the fact that I‚Äôm a lawyer when I‚Äôm accused of not being able to sift between spin and actual evidence. And did I say media has little impact on America?
@Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I see problems with the server and always did. That was typical Clinton trying to keep things secret that are supposed to be public. But bypassing federal records systems was not criminal when she was serving so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for.

@rkinseth @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Obama wanted to remove missiles everywhere and always did. Recall that nuclear non-proliferation was his one significant achievement as a Senator. I don‚Äôt like that he played politics with it but it‚Äôs nothing like the allegations against Trump.
@Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Dude. I‚Äôm a lawyer that only deals in evidence. Media noise has minimal impact. I have suspected Trump-Russia collusion since the pro-Russia party platform at the RNC convention. The pile of evidence has only grown since. I‚Äôve seen no similar evidence on the BHO/HRC side.
@Sig45Mike @SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Being focused on his target regardless of party is not the same thing as targeting conservatives in a biased way. As a non-partisan American that only cares about getting to the truth about our President, I was comforted by the choice of Mueller (as were most Rs at the time).
@actual_biscuit @BAMAPERRY @rkinseth @RealSaavedra @dbongino But that‚Äôs the American media‚Äôs job so I‚Äôm not sure what to do with that. If they were so one-sided, why did they have daily stories about emails and Wikileaks?
@BAMAPERRY @rkinseth @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino If Wikileaks released the DNC and Podesta emails with no involvement with Russia or the Trump campaign then you‚Äôre right that there is no problem and that‚Äôs what Mueller‚Äôs report will say. No foreign involvement in the Hollywood Access audio, right?
@rkinseth @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino He wasn‚Äôt asking Russia to help him get re-elected in exchange for concessions. And he was the President who was responsible for crafting our defensive strategy so how could it be counter to it?
@rkinseth @BAMAPERRY @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Not the point. If Russia released equal levels of truth about both campaigns, maybe that would matter but they didn‚Äôt.		Also, Russia‚Äôs social media campaign was almost entirely based on lies about Hillary so if that‚Äôs your bar for wrongful actions it still fails.
@SchaveChad @angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I have almost no idea what Mueller is doing and neither do you. Where is evidence of bias?
@BAMAPERRY @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino If Hillary made a deal with Ukraine for special treatment once elected in exchange for Ukraine getting her elected, she should also be indicted. Didn‚Äôt Trump and Sessions try to get evidence of this but didn‚Äôt even find enough probable cause to appoint a special prosecutor?
@BAMAPERRY @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I don‚Äôt think the theory is that votes were physically changed but do you at least admit that it would be unacceptable to work with an enemy nation to influence enough votes to get you elected? And completely illegal if you promised that country favorable treatment once elected?
@sealergirl @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino I‚Äôve been hearing about the crimes of the Obama administration for almost a decade and the allegations always fizzle when carefully vetted. Two years of vetting Trump‚Äôs crew has already produced a mountain of evidence (though no smoking gun) and guilty pleas.
@BAMAPERRY @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Seth Rich hacked both Podesta and the DNC? Russia was not involved in distributing the emails? The intelligence community findings are just wrong? Nobody who has seen the confidential data agrees that Russia did not meddle in a meaningful way.
@angelmom6369 @linda_also @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino Why would Mueller, a Republican famous for being non-partisan, chosen by Trump‚Äôs own DOJ, be running a biased investigation?
@BAMAPERRY @actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino If Russia was involved in either the DNC or Podesta hackings or info dumps, then it can be fairly said that Trump was elected as a result of Russia‚Äôs help. Not to mention the votes likely swung by the social media disinformation campaign that has already been proven.
@actual_biscuit @RealSaavedra @dbongino For starters, he was already the President and was supposed to be discussing these things with Russia. Also, Russia didn‚Äôt help him get elected in exchange for concessions. Obama letting Russia know his hands were politically tied until after the election is a bad look but legal.

@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer My position is just a slight, nuanced modification of my former belief in an unlimited 2A, which was wrong. Sorry your usual talking points didn‚Äôt work with someone who has fully thought these things through. God bless.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer I have considered and addressed every word you‚Äôve said. My position is not that complicated. I want a rule that would ban any gun that makes it so a shooter would likely win a face off against 20 healthy men before being subdued. That is an unreasonable level of firepower.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer To be clear, I‚Äôm not advocating confiscation and think it would be a bad idea. Nor am I advocating preventing Americans from owning reasonable guns (which is most guns). I‚Äôm just looking to limit the manufacture or sale of certain unreasonable types of new guns.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer Every 2A advocate eventually retreats to a place where they assume the problem is the lack of gun knowledge of the other person. That avoids having to deal with the inescapable fact that limiting certain types of unreasonable firearms would reduce the body count in mass shootings
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer I sincerely don‚Äôt understand but would like to. If not for a potential confrontation with the US military, how do you think an unlimited second amendment is protecting your other rights? How would limiting the types of guns available threaten other freedoms?
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer Maybe that was true at one time but do you think Americans are sufficiently armed, even with overpowered guns, to defeat the modern American military if it came down to it? I don‚Äôt think so at all so there must be something else besides arms sustaining our fundamental rights.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer ... My plan would be to limit guns and aggressively overhaul mental health approaches. If people did become less prone to mass murder in 10 years, I‚Äôd have no issue legalizing overpowered guns again.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer I agree that we should do more to identify these people and monitor people‚Äôs pharmaceutical intake but that is incredibly complicated to do and would take decades to impact the trends. ...
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer And my pragmatic attempt to limit deaths by limiting the types of firearms available in no way is blaming the guns more than the sick/evil shooter. I just don‚Äôt have an equally effective way to stop people from wanting to be shooters.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer Unmodified pressure cookers are incapable of causing harm and serve a sufficient non-violent purpose that it would be absurd to make them illegal. The guns used in mass shootings are more analogous with the modified pressure cookers, which are rightfully illegal.
I understand that there are many Democratic voters that don‚Äôt want Dems working with the President but if Trump‚Äôs willing to compromise, I‚Äôd like to see this Congress do much more work for America than the Republican Congress did under Obama. https://t.co/m5ehk4lIWv
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer True. But I assume you‚Äôre not against the existing laws that limit our ability to acquire and stockpile bomb ingredients. The law simply needs to draw a line in the appropriate place for guns (while upholding our right to bear reasonable arms).
@PatJohnson_111 @DoubleDDeacon @LauraLoomer Probably. But I can‚Äôt conceive of constitutional way to reduce volume of incidents. There are constitutional ways to reduce number of victims per incident by limiting us to only reasonable weapons.

@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer I will process the evidence as it comes but the majority of these theories are debunked so it is wise not to go all-in based on faith that future evidence will lead to a currently unsupportable conclusion. If you end up being right, there will be hell to pay.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer Va Tech is the exception but it‚Äôs a fair one to cite. It‚Äôs distinguishable because the victims were so spread out so it is a different problem that likely wouldn‚Äôt be solved by either of our proposals.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer If the Sandy Hook shooter had a pistol, we‚Äôd be mourning 3 or 4 dead kids and maybe one dead adult before a handful of teachers wrestled the shooter down. Big difference.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer I‚Äôm not saying there has never been a false flag operation in America but I disagree. That‚Äôs what many said about Sandy Hook and living in that area, I assure you that was very real. Most or all of the rest are almost certainly real as well.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer Likewise. I respect your position and willingness to avid devolving to trading insults as well.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer I don‚Äôt have nightmares about someone entering my kids‚Äô classrooms with a stick, knife or even most rifles or shotguns. An AR 15, for example, could wipe out an entire classroom of 20 in seconds. I don‚Äôt want to ban any guns beyond the unreasonable ones.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer As more Americans make mass murder their preferred method of suicide, killers can‚Äôt be deterred and guns rarely deter lesser crimes because criminals don‚Äôt know about the gun. Best we can do is limit the number of victims when mass shootings occur and this is smartest way.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer If someone came at a concert, church or bar full of people with most shotguns, a few people would die horrifically but the shooter would be overpowered by unarmed people before his kill number could get near double digits.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer I have no doubt we could figure out what equipment is only reasonably dangerous and what equipment is overpowered and unreasonably dangerous.
@JRehling @CarolLaRue This is not new. One of the things that began to turn me away from the Republican Party was when they stopped doing the yellow to orange to red terror warnings immediately after Election Day in 2004.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer Because if a crazy guy comes at you and I with a blunt object, odds are at least one, if not both, of us survive.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer That leaves right wing media, which would never publish anything about America‚Äôs discomfort with these proposals to add arms to our day-to-day lives.
@DoubleDDeacon @FalteringFalcon @LauraLoomer I don‚Äôt want to disarm everyone at all. I believe in a constitutional right to reasonable arms. Just want a ceiling on the types of military style arms that can be made and owned so that a single crazy/evil person can‚Äôt overcome a crowd of 20 (whether armed or not).
@FalteringFalcon @DoubleDDeacon @LauraLoomer Most Americans would agree that adding guns hurts much more than it helps and are just as bewildered as you when guns rights advocates suggest it is the answer.
@DoubleDDeacon @PatJohnson_111 @LauraLoomer How would the statistics look if broken down by weapon type used in each mass killing? We all know the number of deaths and serious injuries per incident would clarify the most practical way to solve the problem.

I‚Äôve also concluded that a high percentage of Soros criticism (I‚Äôm not saying you) is a coded way to reference the perceived global Jewish conspiracy and claims that Jews secretly control banking.
@ketoandcanibis @gailtalk There is a .0001% chance this is not a hoax. Nobody trying to help Democrats would word it this way.
@Xantl @LauraLoomer @SethAbramson Then make the case that his current positions or actions are dangerous. Don‚Äôt lie about how he is a Nazi collaborator (which I‚Äôve heard the right say probably 5000 times) because he tried to survive the Holocaust as a 14 year old.
Is this for real? https://t.co/Obpd7CsHDT
@rockermom96 @LauraLoomer @SethAbramson I suppose stealing people‚Äôs property is not as heroic as defying the Nazis and dying but I think I‚Äôd want my children to choose their lives over property in that situation. Would you judge your 14 year old for making that choice or consider him a Nazi sympathizer for life?
@IvoryDove @LauraLoomer Ms. Loomer: Shouldn‚Äôt you clarify with your followers, even those trying to support your point, that it is unacceptable and reckless to claim that media or banks are controlled by the Jews?
Also, I‚Äôm yet to meet a Democrat that gives much attention to Soros yet many of the Republicans I talk to are obsessed with the guy and convinced he is the key figure in Democratic politics. It has never added up. https://t.co/AqNwObLNqs
@LauraLoomer @SethAbramson I‚Äôve been listening to the right talk about how Soros is an admitted Nazi collaborator for years now. I always assumed they had something stronger than the story of a 14 year old Jewish kid trying to survive the Holocaust by helping secure some property from Jewish homes.
I hate swastikas and think we should shun anyone displaying them but let‚Äôs not have the government compiling a list of what we can and can‚Äôt display or wear. The government will inevitably go way beyond swastikas. https://t.co/w9L3xOVbEE

I just do my own research, vet everything, take nothing at face value and can‚Äôt be brainwashed into believing that the press is calling politicians corrupt or liars because the media is biased rather than because the pols are corrupt liars.

@volarconalas @MarkFanInDC @RealSaavedra The MSM is incompetent but doesn‚Äôt push a false narrative that makes viewers feel threatened and react violently. Right wing outlets constantly trick viewers into believing things like immigrants and Muslims are an immediate threat to American families. Viewers react accordingly.
@bitemeMannix @RealSaavedra They don‚Äôt have me and they only really have known left-wing media outlets like Kos. The right has simply been way more casual about the truth for decades and journalists‚Äô job is to report on lies and corruption so it seems like pure bias.
@bitemeMannix @RealSaavedra Yes, really. But right now the left has very little power and is doing infinitely fewer dishonest and dangerous things than the right. When the left tells lies or pushes narratives that incite violence, you‚Äôll see how evenhanded I am.
@bitemeMannix @RealSaavedra You think Avenatti‚Äôs antics or NBC holding back that story contributed to the violence of the past few days? I‚Äôm having trouble making the connection.
@RealSaavedra Even if we don‚Äôt ultimately hold them responsible, it is fair to debate whether these things would have happened without outlets like Breitbart or Fox News exaggerating the truth and making unstable people feel like they are being threatened.

@JusticeAngelof @Frankie91709 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan Professional comedians have the cleanest case. America‚Äôs leaders should never get a free pass by claiming they were kidding. The rest of us probably need to justify saying something unreasonably offensive or should be given the opportunity to apologize unless a repeat offender.
@Kreemerz @Bettie003 @JacobAWohl Not so much lately though best I can tell.
@johncardillo Because these shooters are infinitely more willing to die by gunshot than leaders are willing to allow all of their citizens to die by nuclear bomb.
@Frankie91709 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan No chance. I‚Äôve been condemning NBC for firing Kelly and almost never think a comedian should be condemned for a failed attempt at comedy.
@piersmorgan How are people still trying to cite the fact that a bigot has certain family members or friends from a group as evidence of how that person views and treats that group? The bigot always see their person as different than the typical member of the group.
@Frankie91709 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan If I notice the left playing the type of game involving fabricated discrimination that Ms. Loomer is continually playing, I will gladly try to talk some sense into them as well.
@Frankie91709 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan I don‚Äôt know the moment you‚Äôre referring to and I‚Äôm not sure how it bears on the subject at hand but I am similar against casually calling someone racist. So if that‚Äôs what Gillum did, I‚Äôd be against it.
@MAGAManCraig1 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan Disavowal would be a smart publicity stunt but wouldn‚Äôt change anything about how they actually feel about Jews or their positions on issues important to Jews.
@MAGAManCraig1 @LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan I agree that Farrakhan has shown himself to be a Jew hater but he is also a community leader who has met, been pictured with and worked with a variety of political leaders for decades. Bad optics but that doesn‚Äôt make all of those political leaders ‚ÄúJew haters‚Äù.
@LauraLoomer @keithellison @LouisFarrakhan Are we supposed to take this ‚ÄúJew-hater‚Äù claim more or less serious than the one against Gillum a couple days ago? Maybe neither are serious and you just accuse people on the left of hating Jews in the hopes of a political advantage.
@_its_all_good_ @don_diver @JacobAWohl Great pictures. I think we can all now conclusively agree that any conspiracy theory about the identity of the bomber should not consider or cite the seemingly different looks of the van in different pictures.
@FossilBeBear @julshenley @don_diver @JacobAWohl I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt played with actual numbers. I just made that up to try to put some level of analytics behind the analysis rather than have it be a gut feel thing because everyone‚Äôs gut will feel different about the other side depending on their political beliefs.
@FossilBeBear @julshenley @don_diver @JacobAWohl It is a question of degree but I see a huge gap between the left and the Trump folks on this if the formula is something like [unacceptability rating of statement]*[provocation potential rating]*[dishonesty rating]*[number of statements]
@FossilBeBear @julshenley @don_diver @JacobAWohl I agree Trump‚Äôs not legally liable for his rhetoric. I disagree that the legal free speech standard is the end of the discussion. Any politician that I see consistently using speech that will likely be seen by his supporters as a call to do bad things should lose my support/vote.

@roland_zdice Most people wouldn‚Äôt read his statement that narrowly and that was his intention. 		And the reread of my own tweet was no help so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting at.
@roland_zdice Enough to be able to speculate that a President with no history of even basic decency to African Americans will make no friends in the black community by purporting to speak on their behalf. Do you think Trump should feel entitled to speak on behalf of African Americans?

@FossilBeBear @don_diver @JacobAWohl Maybe. But most likely it is exactly as it appears, which is that a dedicated follower of Trump, who adorned his van with Trump flair, thought he would help Trump out by attempting to terrorize/kill his enemies.
@FossilBeBear @don_diver @JacobAWohl Not necessarily years and maybe some of the stickers were not permanent and could be swapped with new versions of the same stickers or different ones so there would be minimal apparent wear.
@don_diver @JacobAWohl Probably because another driver in the past saw the van and thought the MAGA madness was interesting enough to photograph and posted those photos after the arrest today.

@AR15X95 @Flcdi Drawing attention to the loud corners of the left is somewhere between a lost opportunity cost and an insincere political play. Republicans have been playing the law and order card against the scary left since Nixon and it works but it also makes America worse.
@LauraLoomer @FaithGoldy Why exactly is this more acceptable than the left shouting down conservatives?
@AR15X95 @Flcdi If he spent his money on a fire extinguisher while the flood water was rising around his house, I will accuse him of having misplaced priorities and irrational fear.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi And a small group of white supremacists killed a girl last summer. I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs not some danger posed by the small fringes but we shouldn‚Äôt freak out and make their message louder than it deserves because we‚Äôre irrationally frightened.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi Following politics and news closely for more than four decades.  Long enough to know that if you‚Äôre citing behavior at Berkeley, you‚Äôre only talking about the small noisy fringes of the left, not the average leftist or Democrat.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi Those that did those things should be arrested and punished but leftist violence is not widespread enough to be even in the top 500 problems facing America. That tells me that this is the right trying to scare Americans before midterm elections. It‚Äôll be effective but dishonest.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi If I start to see widespread violence coming from the left, I will be first in line to extinguish it. All I see at this point are scattered bursts of loud, rude, ineffective flailing from a group of frustrated Americans, most of whom are harmless.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi Is it so common that I need to be frightened? I‚Äôm not. Neither should you be. I‚Äôm also not scared of getting kicked by a leftist who misunderstood Holder. Neither should you be.
@BR549Conserv2A To an outsider who is neither left nor right, you are all acting like you‚Äôre frightened of this leftist ‚Äúmob‚Äù and scared that Holder told them to kick you (even though it is obvious he did not). Ignore them and they‚Äôll go away.
@AR15X95 @Flcdi Do you find yourself threatened by Antifa often? How about your friends and family? Have you ever met anyone who has had a run-in with Antifa when there were no armed white supremacists in the vicinity? They don‚Äôt seem like such a threat to everyday Americans.
@NumbersMuncher The only right answer is Muhammad Ali!
@BR549Conserv2A It blows my mind that these young, artsy, leftist idiots scare you that much. They seem rude but most of them don‚Äôt seem the least bit frightening. I suppose we all have different levels of courage.
@jsmacdonaldGT @AngeloRayGomez So it is your position that the Iranian theocracy is a leftist government? But I‚Äôm so far left I can‚Äôt see it? Even though Iranian leaders have explicitly tried to purge non-conservatives out of government? And even though I‚Äôm far from a leftist. You are mistaken in many ways.
@Flcdi He made it clear several times that he is not referring to literal violent or illegal acts, including saying so in the same speech that is being quoted. There are legitimate arguments to be made against the left. Why be dishonest?
@AngeloRayGomez Isn‚Äôt Iran a far right government?
RT @WalshFreedom: Too much fake outrage on both sides. But outrage sells. Outrage gets a lot of retweets. So both sides will keep it up.
@StoneChallenger In the same speech, he said "when I say, you know, ‚Äòwe kick ‚Äòem,‚Äô I don‚Äôt mean we do anything inappropriate." He clarified again later that he's "obviously not advocating violence."		And Scalise incident is awful but hardly representative of the typical behavior of the left.
@StoneChallenger He absolutely was encouraging protests, marches, only compromising when it favors you politically and using dirty tricks to push the legal boundaries. He wasn't encouraging violence or anything resembling actual kicking. The current political climate is not quite that incendiary.
@StoneChallenger Your response at least contains some of the appropriate nuance
@wuttangie @ProfMJCleveland I agree that the other witnesses couldn't corroborate because they didn't remember the night she is referencing. That doesn't mean that they are refuting her story. It is ok for us all to say that there is insufficient proof that he sexually assaulted her or that she lied.
Things like this make Republicanism an impossible option for me even if I lean right on many issues. Only a moron believes that Holder was suggesting that anyone actually kick a Republican. Why would I sign up to be lied to? https://t.co/1mImLLKuwd
@wuttangie @ProfMJCleveland Ford proved that her story doesn't fall apart when she's forced to publicly answer questions about it. That's not the same as proving her story but it matters. The only witness that really refuted her is Judge and I'd like to see how his story holds up under the same scrutiny.
@Tromper23 @wuttangie @ProfMJCleveland Would the behavior described by Ford make him a sexual predator? It was bad behavior that could have traumatized Ford but it was not the type of behavior that necessarily begins a pattern of serial sexual abuse. If he had admitted it and apologized, I would have let it go.
@textriot Only a moron would take a ‚Äúcrosshairs‚Äù reference literally or think it is a call for literal shooting. Similarly, I disagree with Holder‚Äôs metaphor and definitely think it is a bad idea to lie and pretend it is a literal call for violence.
@wuttangie @ProfMJCleveland That makes sense to me but to be honest, that is about as far as most Democratic Senators went. They said they believe Ford but didn‚Äôt go out of their way to say that Kavanaugh has been proven to be a sexual assaulter.
@textriot I‚Äôm asking this sincerely. Do you actually hear this as a call to physical violence? I can‚Äôt find a way to honestly interpret this as anything other than a call for the left to answer any cheap tactics from the right with cheap tactics.
@ProfMJCleveland That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong (not on the stupid part). Polls showed that more than half the country believed her over him. You think partisan Democrats running for office are among the minority that believe he‚Äôs not guilty?
@ProfMJCleveland Is it reasonable to expect them to condemn members of their own party for publicly stating that they believe Kavanaugh is probably guilty? Remember that these candidates likely also believe Kavanaugh is guilty but feel it‚Äôs inappropriate to imply it publicly.
@ProfMJCleveland Doesn‚Äôt that create a rule by which we should publicly brand men as sexual assaulters based only on a reasonable likelihood? If so, you must be more comfortable with the other Democrats that did exactly that.
@ProfMJCleveland Your logic is fundamentally flawed. There‚Äôs a reasonable likelihood that Kavanaugh did exactly what he was accused of but insufficient evidence either way so it remains inconclusive. It is conclusive that he is too partisan and ill tempered so why not base no vote on that?
Isn‚Äôt that Democrat messaging? https://t.co/pf8vojvtv8

@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway We can agree on that as long as you‚Äôre agreeing that it is logically and morally wrong to call an alleged victim a liar without a combination of psychological experts and compelling proof that the attack did not occur.

@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway You don‚Äôt want victims to be believed about their memory that they were attacked or who did it. But you want them to be believed without question about collateral memories formed as a preschooler that would be unrelated to their trauma? Most people‚Äôs memory doesn‚Äôt work that way
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway And I‚Äôm suspicious of the way a 5 year old would process and memorize details of time and place even as I believe they would remember who did it and the basics of what happened.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway As established yesterday, you are incapable of comprehending the point. It would depend on how extraordinary the attack was. Kavanaugh‚Äôs attack was incomplete and would not have been immediately processed as a significantly traumatic event. Thus, why retain the details?
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I gave you enough credit to assume you weren‚Äôt just playing word games with a serious charge like that. My mistake.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Maybe she lied. Maybe she‚Äôs telling the truth. Unless you can prove she lied, you‚Äôre wrong to call her a liar and you can‚Äôt prove she lied. Why would women come forward if they‚Äôll be called liars about being assaulted by people who have no proof that their lying?
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I just noticed you liked the tweet where I was accused of calling an alleged victim a liar, which I clearly did not. I have been straight with you and respectful of your arguments even where I disagree. Why disrespect me like that?
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Point is, he has not been proven to have sexually assaulted her so we should not call him a sexual predator. But she has not been proven to have brought false charges against her, so we should not call her a liar. She made allegations that remain intact but unproven.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt get it and don‚Äôt seem to be trying to. Good night.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Kavanaugh was not as successful as he may have seemed to those that wanted him to be telling the truth. He was well coached and still came across in ways that will hurt the Court for the foreseeable future and made it seem like he was avoiding questions.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway But as explained, I didn‚Äôt question your truth, which means you‚Äôre just making that up and repeating it. Even if you misunderstood me at first, I‚Äôve now explained this several times.
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway If that‚Äôs enough, maybe I should change my position on Kavanaugh and say he is guilty. He was caught lying, came across insincere, has one of the biggest motivations to lie in the history of motivations, etc.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Not remembering is not even close to the same thing as denying her allegations.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway No psychology background but I‚Äôm a trial/appellate attorney who has sifted through the memories of countless witnesses, including those that suffered specific trauma in their past.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Reality is the prep process can drain a lot of emotion out of the final testimony. Also, she was very nervous, which can manifest as emotion or as no emotion because you are trying to calm your nerves.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway It is you who is lying now because I have never called a victim a liar until I have proven that they lied, which is rare. That doesn‚Äôt mean that we should be convicting men every time a woman claims she is a victim because the man also deserves due process.
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway What if you simply apply the same innocent until proven guilty, due process standard to your allegation that she fabricated these charges that you want applied to her allegations against Kavanaugh?
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Hard to say.  I‚Äôve had hundreds of witnesses in front of me both lying and telling the truth and they don‚Äôt all cry when they should and the ones that do are often forcing it because they think it will be more believable if they do.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Please carefully read my responses. I said she was NOT ACTUALLY RAPED, which means she would process the night differently than if she was actually raped.  Also, I don‚Äôt belong to a party so I don‚Äôt know how I could have partisan views.
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Victim‚Äôs willingness to come forward will be highly influenced by the level of respect (different from deference) we show people like Ford, who come forward with their story. They should not be called liars without proof any more than the man should be called a rapist.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Did I call you a liar? I said you have a better memory than most people so you shouldn‚Äôt assume your experience is the same as theirs. Did you think I was being sarcastic?
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway They remember who did what to them. They‚Äôre not great with dates or locales or other circumstances. They haven‚Äôt and won‚Äôt come forward in part because they are afraid that people like you and Professor Cleveland will say that means they are lying about being sexually abused.
@irisheyzsmile @pittipatch @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Trauma does not usually actually work that way, especially here where she was not actually raped. Her first instinct was almost definitely to try to just move past it and convince herself it was no big deal. The only detail that would necessarily be preserved is the act itself.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway You seem like a reasonable person so I expect you don‚Äôt think I need to alert the abused women I know that they should expect consequences in addition to the rape and abuse they suffered because as kids they never reported their abuser to the authorities or told anyone.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway You would possess an extremely rare gift if you are able to remember the details of a specific party in a Summer during high school. The other 99% of us are fuzzy and even wrong about the details. Put your old friends to the test with this and you will see I‚Äôm right.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway No. I‚Äôm calling him a double liar. He acted like they hooked up by putting in the quote and then lied to the committee about what it meant.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway No. At most, three or four votes changed because of this (Murkowski and red state Dems). The rest were voting against him on other grounds (abortion, Trump‚Äôs ability to pardon himself, etc.) just like they voted against Gorsuch.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway It was public hearings about whether her sexual attacker should get a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. If it happened, what do you think she should have done differently?
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway If you accepted his explanation of the Renate quote, you either have no idea how guys talk or you will believe anything he says. Renate alumni was 100% a dig about hooking up with her and was not a tribute to her friendship. She didn‚Äôt even know about it until recently.
@pittipatch @irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Or her memory of a party from several decades ago is just honestly fuzzy like most of our memories of parties from our teenage years.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Just because there are morons on the fringes, it doesn‚Äôt make her more of a liar or him more of a sexual attacker. If he did it, he is a sexual attacker and I hope he doesn‚Äôt keep getting away with it. If he didn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs a liar and I hope she doesn‚Äôt keep getting away with it.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway It wasn‚Äôt a criminal or even a civil trial. She did not need to prove anything. She was asked to provide her testimony. She did and the consensus was that she appeared credible. At least 52 Senators didn‚Äôt think it was enough to prevent the nomination from moving forward.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Point is that there are many reasons she may have said she wouldn‚Äôt fly that don‚Äôt bear on her credibility. Why make something of this meaningless flying issue but forgive Kavanaugh‚Äôs lies on things like whether he watched the testimony or the meaning of the Renata quote?
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway It is fair to ask whether her activism was her motivation here. But this didn‚Äôt play out the way I would expect it to if it was just a California activist trying to prevent the fifth vote against Roe v. Wade.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I know you don‚Äôt believe her but take a moment and consider the possibility that it happened. Because it might have. And if it did, put yourself in her shoes. The consequences to him and his family become secondary.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Maybe she is afraid of flying but does it anyways at times. Maybe her fear of flying is a new thing. Maybe she wasn‚Äôt ready to testify in Washington in front of the world when they wanted her to so she blame fear of flying. None of these make her a liar on all things.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I do have issues with the social media scrubbing. It doesn‚Äôt mean she is not telling the truth but it must have contained some things that could be spun against her.
@PRS813 @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Her testimony is evidence, though I agree due process would prevent a criminal conviction without better corroboration. Her motives seemed sincere and the prosecutor could have easily demonstrated political or financial motives with the right questions.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway If it is a criminal standard, I absolutely have a reasonable doubt. However, the one detail that would never get foggy would be who attacked you (only exception might be if you misidentified the person that night, which is very rare). When‚Äôs/where‚Äôs might fade but not who.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I haven‚Äôt ruled out mental illness or other issues but it is still more likely she is lucid and telling the truth. It would not have been hard for the prosecutor to get her to show her true colors if she was driven purely by a political agenda.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Would you be able to corroborate your friends‚Äô presence at every party you attended in high school. I couldn‚Äôt put together most nights at this point. And I have no idea if she is really afraid of flying so I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a lie.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Not true at all.  One of them can‚Äôt place her full blown rape (part of ongoing sexual abuse at hands of stepfather) within a three year period or even which house she was living in when it happened. The central details overwhelm the minor details.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Did she come across that way to you? Is this a good strategy to get rich? If you take off politically shaded lenses, none of that seems likely. Most likely is that Kavanaugh attacked her and the only details she retained was he and Judge being present. But can‚Äôt be sure.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway And I only doubt she would have felt the need to use his name with her therapist. I expect she would have told her therapist that a guy attacked her.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway I disagree. The women in my life who suffered much worse than what she alleges never went public but are sure they would if their abuser was nominated for the Supreme Court or running for major political office. They doubt they would have come forward for lower court nominations.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Didn‚Äôt she at least say it was a federal judge?
@inexemplum @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Agreed. But as of now, there is not much in the way of evidence of bad faith or even evidence that her story is false. Unsubstantiated is not the same as false.
@christi_stevens @DeeATee1 @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Sounds like there is not much to the report.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Why would she refer to him by name to her therapist? It would be an unnecessary detail. But she allegedly named him to friends/family prior to his nomination, which adds credibility to her story and indicates she was not simply interested in stopping him from being seated.
@christi_stevens @DeeATee1 @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway If her allegations were false, I agree and I‚Äôd like to know that. As of now, her story is believable to me and she came across as credible. Not enough for a criminal conviction but enough to make me also ask what she and he deserve if her story is true.
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway That‚Äôs the thing. She didn‚Äôt get caught in the kind of lies I expected she would if she was lying. Her story stayed fuzzy but never fell apart. And does it really seem odd to you that a person would bend over backwards to avoid making their humiliating therapist notes public?
@DeeATee1 @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway She did not come across as a person driven by an agenda to me.  I do agree a proven intentional/reckless false accusation should carry serious consequences. Do you have proof she was not making these claims in good faith?
@irisheyzsmile @ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway If I needed to recreate the details of a party from 30 years ago, the details would be just as fuzzy as hers. The lack of corroboration is problematic but expected for the same reason. Also, didn‚Äôt the friend deny that she coached them on the polygraph? These are not really lies.
@ProfMJCleveland @MZHemingway Your guy is getting confirmed. You can stop disparaging this woman now. The public, including you, does not have nearly enough clear facts to be certain. Your speculative analysis of the motives of a vulnerable person served a purpose yesterday. Today it just seems cruel.
@Dowens8490 @ActDontReact @Brandossius @thehill That‚Äôs simply false. If he was the deciding vote, his vote would have been very meaningful. Since his vote was meaningless, the left literally didn‚Äôt need him at all today.
@PoliticsWolf If the left wants a shot at blocking Amy Coney Barrett from replacing Clarence Thomas (or Ginsburg as worst case scenario) they should swallow their anger and work hard to make sure Manchin holds his seat.
@EWErickson How are you missing the way that this risks the Supreme Court‚Äôs position as the final word on the law? If Bush v. Gore happened with the court you describe, there is real risk the decision would be disregarded by half the country, leading to violence or even civil war.

@phillyvol5 @EWErickson She could still tell a more believable story than him but you‚Äôre right. Without corroborating evidence she‚Äôll have a heck of a time making the Rs believe her enough to vote against him. But I f any of these new allegations are credible, he‚Äôll withdraw before Thursday.
@phillyvol5 @EWErickson We‚Äôll see the details of her story but it‚Äôs at best sexual misconduct or attempted sexual assault if not attempted rape. If true, all are dealbreakers to become a Supreme Court Justice once you‚Äôve denied anything happened (and probably even if you admit it right away).
@phillyvol5 @EWErickson I agree. Reasonably contemporaneous accounts made me generally believe the Moore accusations.  Hearing the accusers‚Äô stories and hearing Moore give his defense was also compelling. I hope the testimony this week is as compelling but I‚Äôm skeptical.
@phillyvol5 @EWErickson Understood. But if he truthfully happened to attempt to rape a Democrat 30 years ago, I can‚Äôt just ignore her allegations because she might also have a political incentive.
@phillyvol5 @EWErickson I‚Äôd like to hear the accusers tell their stories before judging because sexual assaults do happen and I have no problem believing that a real victim would not report it until the perpetrator was nominated for SCOTUS. I also see the motive to lie so I need to see more to know.

@KFaShizzle @EWErickson I expect that the irony of your simple-minded response to a legitimate argument is entirely lost on a person of your intellect.
@dj_bogart @EWErickson No. You‚Äôre right. We should just assume every accusation is pure politics before we even know who the accuser is or what is being alleged. That‚Äôs a much higher level of critical thinking.
@wits_mcgee @EWErickson Avanatti is what you all mean by ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù? I assumed you all meant like Schumer, Pelosi, Obama or other actual party leaders.
@Peaches_Sabrina @EWErickson I hate to disturb your deeply held assumptions but the MSM and PBS are not actually the same thing as the Democrats.
@LarryFarlow @EWErickson Don‚Äôt you want to see/hear her testify before you decide if whatever she does or does not remember bears on her credibility?

And then we‚Äôll need to see if the alleged victim is credible. Then maybe it is time to argue political treachery. You lose credibility if you do it now.

@alpharettajames @Veteran4Trump Job market was incredibly strong for several years before these tariffs so I can‚Äôt credit the tariffs. Also, the numbers show few jobs have been created so far due to tariffs and experts agree that millions of jobs will disappear in the next few years if the trade wars continue.
@letthemeatfake @mitchellvii Not embarrassing at all. You give the Democrats‚Äô idle threats too much credit. They don‚Äôt seriously believe they will be able to get 2/3 of the Senate to impeach a sitting Supreme Court Justice if they can‚Äôt get 50% in the next couple weeks. This is a PR tactic.
@alpharettajames @Veteran4Trump I generally disagree with the tariff strategy but even if I thought it was a good idea in the long run, how would it be helping the economy already? No significant new trade deals have been struck yet, so it is only the downside of more expensive goods/materials so far.
RT @TheRickWilson: Family values. https://t.co/3rZfa1HmBm

@texasproud1968 @mitchellvii I don‚Äôt think comprehension is your strong suit. I was saying you were wrong if you think criticisms of Trump have anything to do with Hillary.

@trumpin69 @bulliegirl1959 @craigcolquitt @on_bender @mitchellvii Men have every right to a presumption of innocence and false accusations are abhorrent. However, many allegations against men are ultimately proven to be true so each remotely credible allegation needs to be investigated until it is shown to be unprovable or false.
@bulliegirl1959 @craigcolquitt @on_bender @trumpin69 @mitchellvii But it is inevitable that certain true allegations will turn out to be unprovable. Those real victims can‚Äôt be punished.

@JohnyTwoTimes13 @mitchellvii Possibly. But I don't know how to synthesize that with the fact that she told people prior to his nomination
@JohnyTwoTimes13 @mitchellvii If I was seeking a SCOTUS seat, we‚Äôd need to determine if your accusations were purely motivated by trying to stop my confirmation or if they had some credibility. If they had credibility they would need to be fully vetted to see if we could figure out the truth.
@don_peck SCOTUS process is broken. Both sides used to respect it before Bork, Thomas, Bush v. Gore, delaying to avoid Garland, killing the filibuster to seat Gorsuch and now this mess. I don‚Äôt know how the system works if Americans don‚Äôt believe in the process.
@don_peck I appreciate that and respect your viewpoint and argument as well. I legitimately have an open-minded, nuanced view on this. Unfortunately the right wants this fast and the left wants it slow for all of the wrong reasons.
@kdman1961 @mitchellvii You sound like a Browns fan mindlessly screaming about how they are going to beat the Patriots. Possible but unlikely and against the evidence.
@don_peck Of course it is not independently provable but if she had never told anyone before this, I‚Äôd just assume she was making it up to try to save Roe v. Wade. Past statements make that less likely. She still needs to tell a more credible story than he does for me to believe her.
@kdman1961 @mitchellvii I‚Äôm not a Democrat but it looks to me like the House is going blue and the Senate will be close in a year I assumed the Rs would get to 60 senators.
@don_peck I‚Äôm an appellate lawyer. I know what hearsay is and it only matters if the past statement is your only proof (if we were in court, which we‚Äôre not). Past statements can be used to contradict or corroborate what may be her testimony on Monday.
@letthemeatfake @mitchellvii How many Justices have ever been impeached? Especially if it isn‚Äôt accompanied by an arrest, he would never be impeached no matter what we later learn.
@don_peck She spoke about these allegations years before he was up for SCOTUS. That‚Äôs not definitive proof but it is corroboration of her current story and it is enough to fully investigate before giving someone a lifetime appointment.
@Xcathdra @mitchellvii Of course we do. We should learn anything we can to make an informed decision.
@craigcolquitt @MilMarie4 @mitchellvii I‚Äôm not a Democrat so I haven‚Äôt spent any time looking at the accusations against Ellison. If he was trying to get on my Supreme Court, I‚Äôd want to know everything about every accusation against him that had any corroboration.

@karmahitsyoubac @useitorloseit4 @monticello99 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl The drizzle of lies by former Presidents is not on the same level as Trump‚Äôs hurricane of lies. Even after things are disproven, Trump continues to tell the lie, assuming if he says it enough, his supporters will believe him over the indisputable facts.
@karmahitsyoubac @useitorloseit4 @monticello99 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl Trump had biggest electoral victory in 50 years, Ds support MS 13, crime has been rising in America, immigrants more likely to break the law, compliance with Paris accord would cost America billions, last week‚Äôs 4.1 percent GDP number never reached by Obama, etc.
@karmahitsyoubac @useitorloseit4 @monticello99 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl I‚Äôm not saying it wouldn‚Äôt help at all but for the little bit of deterrence, it is a silly way to spend over $50 billion and billions in maintenance costs going forward.
@karmahitsyoubac @monticello99 @useitorloseit4 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl That‚Äôs what Bush said about his similar tax cuts and the economic growth is never sustained in the way that is promised (they always criticize the experts showing them the math proving that the tax cuts won‚Äôt pay for themselves).
@karmahitsyoubac @useitorloseit4 @monticello99 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl I‚Äôve seen that on both sides for decades. Liberals telling conservatives they are in a FoxNews bubble while standing in an MSNBC bubble. And vice versa. However, I‚Äôve never seen anything like the cherry picking and twisting of facts that I see from Trump and his supporters.
@useitorloseit4 @karmahitsyoubac @monticello99 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl If it was just liberals‚Äô opinion, the wall would be well on its way already. Most of America doesn‚Äôt want a wall, including most moderates and even many conservatives.
@karmahitsyoubac @monticello99 @useitorloseit4 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl But Trump didn‚Äôt cut spending to pay for the tax cuts, so that $50 a week is borrowed and you and I will need to repay it with interest in a few years (when the tax cuts are no longer benefiting the bottom 95%).
@karmahitsyoubac @monticello99 @useitorloseit4 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl What have they obstructed that they believe will be good for America? They believe the wall is an ineffective waste of money and a terrible message about American values. They believed the tax cuts would shift money to the wealthy but not help workers‚Äô wages.
@karmahitsyoubac @monticello99 @useitorloseit4 @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl The Republicans control the House, Senate and Oval Office so they can do it on their own. That‚Äôs why McCain‚Äôs vote sunk the Republicans‚Äô last attempt to completely get rid of Ocare? The Democrats don‚Äôt have the numbers to obstruct.
Nearly 100% of Americans that think the wall is a good idea are already approving of Trump‚Äôs job performance. Starting to build the border wall would probably move his numbers the other way. https://t.co/Gy7yCVaO1m

@ShannonSchlafer @mssueme @karmahitsyoubac @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl Possibly given the close election but it was combined with a Twitter army and stealing/distributing emails.
@sellinshovels @Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl 787 Billion to car dealers? Not accurate.		He was wrong about doctors but not the same as lying about doctors. And almost everyone I know kept their doctor.		And the money to Iran was owed to them and part of a broader deal.
@ShannonSchlafer @mssueme @karmahitsyoubac @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl Maybe not you but enough to swing the election.
@ShannonSchlafer @karmahitsyoubac @mssueme @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl Trump‚Äôs policies are just now beginning to manifest. I don‚Äôt believe the hysterics but he is fundamentally weakening America in ways that we will see for the next 5 years.
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl Very few people bother to make that distinction
@sellinshovels I am generally for limited government (though there are some problems that are almost impossible to solve without government)
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl Still a black American in Hawaii and a black American at Columbia
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl I‚Äôve never seen proof that he knew that to be false at the time he said it.
@sellinshovels Completely against (consider it murder) but I don‚Äôt believe government should make laws about it.
@NadsLaws @kellyjane821 @JacobAWohl He wanted single payer or at least a public option. The ACA seemed like too much of a compromise program to me but it seemed to be working in states that embraced the exchange.
@karmahitsyoubac @mssueme @ShannonSchlafer @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl I experienced it. It was slow growth but I was thankful that the economy didn‚Äôt tank as predicted and that jobs were coming back. This was all while the foreclosure crisis was slowly playing out over all 8 years.
@sellinshovels I‚Äôm far from a liberal. I‚Äôm just one of the few Americans in the middle seeing both sides for exactly who and what they are.
@sellinshovels Then I‚Äôm sure his writer thought you would understand that he was referring to his heritage. Why would he write a line confessing his presidency was illegitimate? Think about it.
@useitorloseit4 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl That‚Äôs not what your grandchildren will learn his legacy is. They‚Äôll learn the truth about his accomplishments.
@MajestaLove7 @JacobAWohl I‚Äôve studied it all. Don‚Äôt bother.
@sellinshovels He is not admitting anything. At worst, he misspoke and I think he just was referring to his heritage. This is not the smoking gun you wish it was.
@karmahitsyoubac @mssueme @ShannonSchlafer @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl You are overrating GDP numbers given the collapsing economy he inherited.
@dave451972 @JacobAWohl @BarackObama In context of what he inherited, those numbers don‚Äôt mean much.
@sellinshovels @Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl That‚Äôs like me calling myself ‚ÄúIrish‚Äù because my Dad is from Ireland. Nothing more. You guys twist things worse than the 911 truthers.
@MajestaLove7 @JacobAWohl You don‚Äôt have proof of either of those things. They are delusions.
@sellinshovels @Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl I literally used to write articles vetting conspiracy theories so I looked at the issue years ago. Obama‚Äôs story totally checks out.
@karmahitsyoubac @mssueme @ShannonSchlafer @DidiDavor @JacobAWohl Tell that to Herbert Hoover, who didn‚Äôt handle a collapse quite as expertly and cost us decades of economic weakness.
@sellinshovels @Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl I‚Äôve fully vetted the Kenya theory and supposed evidence. He was born in America.
@dave451972 @JacobAWohl @BarackObama The fact that TR is in that list should give you pause about trying to use that statistic against Obama.
@MajestaLove7 @JacobAWohl You were wrong not to trust him and must have regretted it by the end of his presidency when he didn‚Äôt do all those things you were afraid he would.
@useitorloseit4 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl If it turns out OBL wasn‚Äôt killed, I agree Obama‚Äôs legacy takes a big hit. Since there is virtually no chance he wasn‚Äôt killed, I‚Äôm confident Obama‚Äôs legacy is safe.
@dave451972 @JacobAWohl @BarackObama  https://t.co/F2JYLHKgaU
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl He has had the experience of being a black person in America. Not sure why that would need to be diluted.
@G_station83 @JacobAWohl Were they not on the run?
@DOMIrules28 @JacobAWohl The rest of the world mocks us more and more each day of Trump‚Äôs presidency. That‚Äôs not my opinion. That‚Äôs a fact and it‚Äôs a problem.
@sellinshovels @Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl I expect you even lost your fellow Obama haters with that set of falsities.
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl History will consider him the first black president.
@dave451972 @JacobAWohl Thank you for trying to make Obama look amazing, but those of us that lived through it know Obama wasn‚Äôt able to fully turn around the economy in 6 months. He did turn it around decades quicker than experts were predicting in 2008 and 2009.
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl If those are your expectations, I expect you will continue to be disappointed.
@Boog1961 @JacobAWohl Agreed, though unfortunately, despite my hopes otherwise, I have figured 45 out and I think he is as bad (or worse) as the most obnoxious voices on the left suggest.
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl It is you who are deluded if you think that our grandchildren will not be proud of Obama‚Äôs legacy as the first black president who saved the economy, pulled us out of wars, successfully fought terrorists, tried to help the uninsured and middle class, etc.
@Boog1961 @JacobAWohl As long as you are equally hard on Trump for the current trajectory of the debt due to his spending then it is fair to criticize Obama‚Äôs failure to address it (though it is more forgivable when you inherit a tanking economy)
@RMorx @JacobAWohl Every time Trump insults something America did or didn‚Äôt do before he became President, he is insulting America. Doesn‚Äôt that offend you? Especially if he does it while standing next to various dictators?
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl I‚Äôve checked all the lists of worst presidents that have been published by serious non-partisan historians. Obama is nowhere to be found. 43 and 45 on the other hand...
@kellyjane821 @RJ46942104 @JacobAWohl If you are older than 15, you know the Middle East hasn‚Äôt been stable at almost any point in history. He didn‚Äôt exactly inherit an especially stable Middle East after the Iraq war.
@ripple1959 @JacobAWohl If you did take either of us seriously, you‚Äôd be compelled to agree with my argument, so you are probably better off playing with memes.
@kellyjane821 @NadsLaws @JacobAWohl It was literally his decision with half of his advisers telling him not to go ahead. That is leading.
@VicenteCasulli_ @Kittens4milk @JacobAWohl I doubt Obama was gay or a crack smoker, but even if he was, it didn‚Äôt stop him from being a great President that our grandchildren will be proud of.
@ripple1959 @JacobAWohl If that‚Äôs how you remember Obama, you become very easy to not take seriously.
@RJ46942104 @JacobAWohl To his credit, ISIS was basically decimated by 2016 but Obama did seem to underestimate them at first while he was focused on other terror groups.
@Pubstuffnsuch @JacobAWohl I didn‚Äôt like/trust Obama at first and I‚Äôm not a Democrat so it took years of solid decision-making to win me over. Definitely no kool aid though.
@RJ46942104 @JacobAWohl I have half of you telling me Obama was too soft and the other half telling me Obama was a war monger. You can‚Äôt both be right.
@DOMIrules28 @JacobAWohl I didn‚Äôt say you understood or admired his approach (and I didn‚Äôt always agree with it) but it undeniably restored our standing and trust with key allies following the Iraq war debacle.
@stinkprogres @JacobAWohl He made the ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù call. That‚Äôs what a President does on military actions. Hardly minimal.
@RMorx @JacobAWohl This is not just my opinion. These are verifiable facts. If you don‚Äôt like Presidents negatively commenting on the actions of the previous administration, especially overseas, you must be sickened by the current President.
@RockTheReddd @JacobAWohl Obama is ranked in the top 20 on every serious historian‚Äôs list of best Presidents and he still has an approval rating over 60%. This past year and a half will only help his case in the future.
@rosscmary @JacobAWohl Well played argument by calling names rather than responding. It reveals the strength of your position.
@ShaneStuder88 @VicenteCasulli_ @Kittens4milk @JacobAWohl There are no numbers that support the idea that this economy was created by Trump. Anyone who became President in 2016 had the wind at their back.
@dana_bndana @JacobAWohl Which statement do you claim to be false? And the next 6.5 years will only be as good or bad for me as they will for all of America.
@VicenteCasulli_ @Kittens4milk @JacobAWohl I don‚Äôt care about the last thing (though I question the veracity). I do wish he did more to address the debt once the economy came around. I wish the same of Trump since he inherited a great economy.
@karmahitsyoubac @JacobAWohl However he did it, Obama saved America from decades of economic struggles and set the stage for the strong economy of the past 5 years.
@NadsLaws @JacobAWohl I was careful to use the word ‚Äúled‚Äù.

@JacobAWohl He pulled us out of an economic depression and two wars. And led the killing of OBL. And restored international admiration for America. Should I go on?

If this proves that the Trump campaign was using foundation donations for political purposes, that would be incredibly serious in the pre-2017 America. Who knows what will actually matter any more? https://t.co/XRJFyZzNG3

@BernardKerik @instapundit Wouldn‚Äôt that require at least one actual illegal act demonstrating actual intent to impact the election in favor of Clinton rather than whatever this statement does or does not mean?
@JackPosobiec Why is that ‚ÄúWow‚Äù exactly? I don‚Äôt know exactly what they meant and it doesn‚Äôt mean that their behavior changed a bit. Maybe I‚Äôm just missing an obvious point.
@LauraLoomer @mflynnJR @FBI These types of casual statements remain the least compelling evidence of actual wrongdoing.

@rob_fortin @mitchellvii I read the same polls to show that she was a small favorite, 65% at best with an equal chance for a landslide win or a narrow loss, which is what happened. Anyone predicting more than that was not understanding the polls or the news leading up to Election Day.
@rob_fortin @mitchellvii I‚Äôm sorry if the truth gets in the way of the more fun narrative for you (that Trump and his supporters overcame impossible odds to win and broke the back of arrogant liberals).
@EssBeeJee @mitchellvii I‚Äôve explained the difference between these numbers and the actual polls several times. Most actual polls were within the MOE and I suspect were closer to correct the weeks before Election Day (before the Comey letter).
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii But national polls measure which candidate is winning the popular vote. They are not capable of predicting the winner because of the EC. And I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath that a DHS report will invalidate the millions more that voted for Clinton.
@GarrigusMarie @mitchellvii If I were a Dem, I would have no reason to be angry at CNN or MSNBC. I don‚Äôt think they were promising that Hillary would win, only that the polls showed the race was swinging anywhere from Trump up a point or two to Hillary up five or six and back. The result fit within that.
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii I think you‚Äôre trying to bait me but you‚Äôve chosen the wrong fish here. I‚Äôm a big proponent of the EC, so no problem there. I also believe that 2A protects a reasonably limited right to own guns so I don‚Äôt know if that makes me for or against but I‚Äôm far from extreme on the issue
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii Yes. The polls arguably had some minor issues. But polls weren‚Äôt off by the 90% or 99% type numbers that I constantly hear Trump fans misstating.
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii Exactly. ‚ÄúElection forecasters‚Äù unscientifically misread the scientific polls.
@1990rob2 @Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii I‚Äôm making no excuses for Hillary‚Äôs foolishness. The polls would have captured that poor strategy in a way that they couldn‚Äôt perfectly capture the effect of the Comey letter.
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii Exactly! Thank you for pointing out that those numbers were people‚Äôs attempt to interpret polls, not actually polls.
@DeusNonInride @mitchellvii I remember hearing that logic ensuring a Romney victory in 2012.
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii Those weren‚Äôt polls.  How would polls give anyone 90% if the numbers are within the MOE and the Comey letter has sent the election into an unpredictable tailspin? It was misguided analysis of the polls and news that created those unscientific numbers like 90%.
@lusoludlow @mitchellvii Do you just overlook Virginia, Alabama and the other off/special elections that he has been wrong about?
@rob_fortin @maga_prata @Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii I‚Äôm no fan of Hillary so no sour grapes from me.
@rob_fortin @mitchellvii No credible poll said Trump couldn‚Äôt win.  Trump was just behind and on the short end of the margin of error, which broke in his favor.
@maga_prata @Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii That wasn‚Äôt a poll saying 99%. It was just bad analysis of polls by writers trying to make headlines. Big difference.
@Coder4Liberty @mitchellvii They said Hillary would win by a couple points, which she did.  This remains the most misguided criticism of polling.
@carrieksada @therealroseanne Neither Joy Reid nor Donald Trump are morally trustworthy enough to be President of our great country.

And the Iran deal was imperfect but was the best we could do and bought us a decade. Now we have no deal.

Their reputations are reportedly better than most in Washington. I see no evidence that any of the three did anything more than follow the facts they were presented with.
@musejamie @thehill @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @ChuckGrassley Do you think that evidence Trump conspired with a foreign enemy will be ignored if due process wasn‚Äôt followed in gathering the evidence? It may keep him out of prison but won‚Äôt prevent him from being removed and disgraced.
@musejamie @thehill @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @ChuckGrassley I disagree. Just based on the publicly leaked evidence, Trump is definitely guilty of about a dozen acts of obstruction and I‚Äôm almost positive I could get a jury to find he worked with Russia to swing the election. And my guess is that Mueller has way more unreleased evidence.
@musejamie @thehill @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @ChuckGrassley That‚Äôs the point. There was nothing worth leaking because Trump was heavily suspected from the beginning but the investigation hadn‚Äôt reached that phase yet.
@musejamie @thehill @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @ChuckGrassley Comey saying Trump wasn‚Äôt under investigation was not meaningful. It would be like saying John Gotti was not under investigation when his Capos were being targeted. Trump was always suspected but they needed more confirmation before going after him directly.

@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Enjoy your safe space, coward!!!
@HaloChiefPO117 @Dwarfclone @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I was very critical of Obama‚Äôs failure to tackle the debt during his second term (impossible during his first term because of recession) but I wasn‚Äôt on Twitter for most of his presidency.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I know you resorted to name calling and raised the white flag but don‚Äôt feel bad about your inability to counter my argument. Nobody has been able to propose a saner approach to our national debt than tax policies that favor the bottom 95% of Americans.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Those are toothless cuts that would have no impact on our debt outlook. Entitlements and military cuts are the only ones that would solve debt issues without massive tax increases. And nobody wants to touch entitlements or military spending.
@JohnScoular @Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 You can have that empty platitude back when America is debt free and running a surplus. Until then, the government has a claim on our money. I just want the rich contributing more than hard working, struggling middle class families.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Someone has to pay back America‚Äôs debt, which accrued while the rich were accumulating wealth. Also, income disparity is one of the great existential threats to America, so I prefer rules that favor the middle class. Lastly, the rich would simply feel the least pain.
@wickedgrin1 @peddoc63 That fight ended in the 60s. Federal government will always be involved in healthcare. It is now just a question of finding the smartest approach.
@WarriorRN61 @peddoc63 Even Trump is afraid to take on entitlement reform. Voters simply don‚Äôt allow it. It is one of the things I hoped Trump would do despite the political consequences but he keeps promising he won‚Äôt touch entitlements.
@WarriorRN61 @peddoc63 Exactly! So why are we decreasing this small groups tax burden, making them even richer at the expense of the middle class?
@WarriorRN61 @peddoc63 Cut what? Unless you‚Äôre talking about SS or Medicare or military cuts, where do you plan to cut enough to make a difference?
@Dwarfclone @JohnScoular @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Clinton‚Äôs increases (tiny in comparison to the cuts) were to pay for a middle class tax cut that created strong economic growth.  And do you mean Bush 41? Because 43 did cut taxes on the rich and it was a disaster.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Do you really think the estate tax can‚Äôt be written in a way to avoid hurting small businesses and farmers? I only want billionaires‚Äô children, who are usually already independently wealthy, to pay a painless tax when Daddy dies rather than my plumber.
@WarriorRN61 @peddoc63 I‚Äôm familiar with Dr. Sowell‚Äôs views on supply side economics. I don‚Äôt think it worked the way he thinks it did and it has almost no application now. If nothing else, the consolidation of income and power among a small group would prevent any meaningful trickle down.
@wickedgrin1 @peddoc63 Probably true. Medicare for all is where this is all going to land, if not full blown single payer. Any weakening of Ocare is a Pyrrhic victory because it will create a need for a replacement.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I‚Äôm not against the corporate cuts. I‚Äôm against reducing the tax burden of individuals who simply don‚Äôt need the reduction. Why reduce the estate tax on billionaires at a time that America is in this much debt? Why give the top 5% any relief right now?
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 Can‚Äôt buy new car, putting everything on credit cards, renting instead of owning home, can‚Äôt afford braces, etc. Those are just random examples of pain among people I‚Äôve spoken to. More money in their hands would go into the economy, not into savings/investments like the wealthy.
@Dwarfclone @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I‚Äôve seen two attempts at trickle down in my life and both resulted in a short term stimulus and a widespread downturn. The couple serious attempts at middle class tax cuts have reduced American‚Äôs pain and produced stable strength in the economy.
@SCadick @HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 Until we are out of debt and running a surplus, we can‚Äôt keep shifting the tax burden to the middle and lower class. I understand why it seems fair for a wealthy person who pays a lot in taxes to keep more money but America can‚Äôt afford it right now.
@WileEDude Fine pun, but do you disagree that a tax break for America‚Äôs top 5% is a want, not a need?
@peddoc63 If they don‚Äôt pay taxes, why would they care how the tax plan is structured? Unless you‚Äôre saying they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to vote.
@HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I‚Äôm not a Democrat but I‚Äôm very critical of the Ds failure to offer an alternative plan focused entirely on the bottom 95% for individuals plus a corporate rate cut.
@HaloChiefPO117 @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I‚Äôm crystal clear on the math. People who don‚Äôt pay taxes are irrelevant to the discussion. Even if top earners pay millions, they don‚Äôt need a break right now. The pain is in the middle and lower class and they‚Äôll actually spend the money, stimulating the economy.
@AlexMLeo Flynn Jr. for sure. I envision something I said on the first day enraging him to the point that he wouldn‚Äôt speak to me again for the rest of our time on the island.
@wickedgrin1 @peddoc63 Remember, skyrocketing premiums was the reason this conversation started before the 2008 campaign. I don‚Äôt think Ocare slowed down rising premiums but I‚Äôm not convinced it accelerated the increases dramatically. Public option was really the key to controlling premiums.
Headline is technically correct but really casts Melania in an unfairly negative light. https://t.co/6FLea0uIZm
@wickedgrin1 @peddoc63 But it has helped 20 million Americans get health insurance. We can debate whether that‚Äôs worth the price but Americans are right to be proud of that.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 How does the GOP run on lowering the debt when they‚Äôve voted in favor of cuts on private jet taxes and billionaires‚Äô estate taxes?
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 I wish he was making it hard on the swamp in any way that makes things better. But he is showing himself to be someone that is against the swamp in rhetoric but is actually making things way swampier than ever.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 I don‚Äôt want over dependence but if we could afford it, I‚Äôd love to see the government help its vulnerable citizens in certain ways (opiates, disabled housing, clean water, etc.) We‚Äôve just painted ourselves in a corner with our debt.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 Trump will never have more capital than he did this year unless he is re-elected in a landslide. And there are more lobbyists, Goldman Sachs staffers, cronyism, self-dealing, lack of transparency, personal trips on taxpayers dime, etc., than ever. He is only making things worse.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 I don‚Äôt think we can afford new programs at the moment so it is a bad time to grow the government. It is also a ridiculous time to be phasing out things like the estate tax on billionaire heiresses.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 I like the idea of someone outside the establishment but this has been an awful year for America. I hoped Trump would get money and lobbyists out of politics but we‚Äôre getting all the downside of an outsider with almost no upside.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 On the surface but not really. The tax benefits for the rich are much greater and increase in the coming years. But the middle and lower class own the same share of the increasing debt as the rich and will be hurt more by future spending cuts to pay for the tax cuts.
@MikeMegisis @peddoc63 I would be against it for most products but healthcare is unique. The alternative is that hospitals turn away the uninsured when they walk in bleeding.
@MikeMegisis @RickyBobby_USA @peddoc63 I like some of those ideas, though we don‚Äôt need to repeal Ocare while we implement most of them. I have concerns about capping malpractice awards, though I am all for making it more difficult to bring suit in the first place.
@MikeMegisis @peddoc63 But if SCOTUS found it constitutional, it is constitutional unless the decision is overturned, which is unlikely at this point. The repeal in the tax bill is going to hurt everyone except those that don‚Äôt want to buy insurance but want free healthcare when needed.
@Process2Succeed @peddoc63 20 million Americans benefited from Ocare. That‚Äôs a fact. Some who were being kept off insurance with horrible diseases. It even accomplished this with minimal debt. It is not perfect but it is indisputably successful in many ways.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 The tax plan is great for me but it is absurd to cut the taxes of people like me who have made our money thanks to this country while America faces crippling debt. Plus cutting my taxes does so much less for the economy than putting cash in the hands of the middle class.
@RickyBobby_USA @HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 Yup. Both parties do exactly that. And Trump‚Äôs tax bill is just as bad as any giveaway of taxpayers‚Äô money that came before it. I‚Äôm not fooled to believe I am saving money by jacking up the debt and shifting the burden away from those who can afford it.
@RickyBobby_USA @MikeMegisis @peddoc63 Maybe true, but Medicare isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Old people love their Medicare and always will. Medicare for all is far more likely than substantial Medicare reform that would reinstate capitalism in healthcare.
@RickyBobby_USA @MikeMegisis @peddoc63 I wish there was a way for the private sector to handle it, but it seems like single payer is inevitable if Ocare fails. The alternative is to flip Medicare on its head and the voters just won‚Äôt allow that to happen.
@MikeMegisis @peddoc63 It hasn‚Äôt been found to be unconstitutional. And unless you think anyone will have the political will to take on Medicare, that is the system we‚Äôre working with. Even Trump has promised he won‚Äôt touch Medicare because America loves that program.
@MikeMegisis @peddoc63 Understood. But the healthcare system isn‚Äôt set up to fix itself because pure capitalism doesn‚Äôt work when a bad result is death or illness. We end up treating people without insurance and we all pay for it, which is why the mandate made at least some sense.
@MikeMegisis @peddoc63 The Rs chose not to participate in a compromise because they wanted the political leverage. Same thing the Ds just did with the tax plan.
@HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 Agreed that it increased Medicare spending and implemented a tax that mostly hit the wealthy. It also helped millions get insurance and allowed my friend who could not afford insurance for years because of a preexisting condition to get treatment that has turned her life around.

@jarradjames12 @peddoc63 Care to explain or is an emoji the limits of sophistication you are capable of?
@HaloChiefPO117 @peddoc63 Have you all forgotten that the left‚Äôs approach was single payer or at least a public option? Even though they had a supermajority, the Ds dropped those approaches and borrowed one that Republican politicians had run on for decades.
@hazmat50213 @peddoc63 Do you picture Democrats as 60s hippies on communes and urban welfare recipients? Most Democrats I‚Äôve ever met have been employed and often successful leaders in their businesses.
@peddoc63 Maybe they just mean something different than you do when they use the term ‚Äúgender‚Äù. They believe gender encompasses more than which sex organ you‚Äôre born with. How do you know they‚Äôre wrong?
@peddoc63 Incorrect! Most Democrats still believe Ocare was successful and still could be with a few small tweaks. The only thing they‚Äôre blaming the right for is actively preventing it from working.
@peddoc63 The left is just pointing out the hypocrisy of the right‚Äôs criticisms of Obamacare because Obama attempted to fashion a compromise on healthcare by incorporating GOP ideas into Ocare.

But without other evidence, it would not be enough evidence to prove collusion.  However, the pile of evidence grows daily and there‚Äôs so little exculpatory evidence.
@GOP_WH_News @WilburTwoNose @CarmineZozzora A shred of evidence wouldn‚Äôt indisputably prove collusion, it would be evidence of collusion. Legally, evidence is basically just something that can help prove or disprove an issue. It doesn‚Äôt mean something is definitively proven.
@intel_think @CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Agreed. Is that what happened here? It looked like Obama was asking if he could hold off on negotiating missile defense until after the election. Overly political for my taste but not putting America in jeopardy.
I can‚Äôt imagine how people who block everyone who disagrees with them, even respectfully, aren‚Äôt guaranteeing that they are living in a mental bubble that only contains fictional good news about their beliefs. https://t.co/JK60QJVsb0
@intel_think @CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @PressSec I don‚Äôt care what party anyone is but are you suggesting any deal with another country that includes limiting our nuclear arms activities is treason?
@prosecutingUSA @CarmineZozzora He is now. Maybe Trump wasn‚Äôt personally the target of the investigation yet because investigations happen in stages and you don‚Äôt make the President the target until you have enough evidence.
@WilburTwoNose @CarmineZozzora You can say anything I suppose. I mean you can‚Äôt credibly say there is not a shred of evidence of collusion whether you believe in the Trump campaign‚Äôs guilt or innocence.
@intel_think @CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @PressSec You would have to show me the crime for which Obama was entering into an agreement with Russia to commit. Arms talks with a foreign country by a sitting President isn‚Äôt illegal in any way.
@CarmineZozzora Even if you think the Trump campaign was innocent, you can‚Äôt say there is not a single shred of evidence that they colluded with Russia to help win the election. Even the public record contains many pieces of evidence supporting this.
@CarmineZozzora @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Was Obama working in coordination with Russia to assist with his reelection? If not, then it can't be collusion.
@Aletaforhorses @SenGillibrand @SenFranken I think he has been a strong Senator also but there are others who could be just as strong and not have a past full of these kinds of unacceptable actions. How many credible accusers before it is too many?
I think Franken has a great mind and his actions appear to be less serious than those of Moore, Weinstein or even Trump. However, the quantity of credible accusers is overwhelming the analysis. He should step aside. https://t.co/AqfZ5JOJOR
@jerrymikestorie I know there are many like you that feel that way about the MSM and the MSM deserves to be questioned and cross-checked, but you are all walking into arguments missing many incontrovertible, demonstrably true facts accurately reported by the MSM.
@jerrymikestorie @miket24552 @mitchellvii If I understand your point, I agree that framing Trump would be virtually impossible and would be a horrifically wrong thing to do. I would rise up against anyone who attempted to frame the President.
@jerrymikestorie Liberal or conservative, accurate reporting is accurate reporting and the MSM has published many important stories this year that the right initially attacked but that turned out completely correct (e.g. impending Manafort arrest). Can‚Äôt just ignore MSM and be knowledgeable.
@jerrymikestorie @miket24552 @mitchellvii I‚Äôve vetted it and don‚Äôt see any connections with Dems that matter for the 2016 election. Plus, the Russian government successfully worked to get Trump elected, not Hillary, so I don‚Äôt see where Dems fit in that narrative unless it is an elaborate frame job.
@jerrymikestorie @miket24552 @mitchellvii What about Dems?
@jerrymikestorie MSM shouldn‚Äôt be your only source but it would be irresponsible to completely ignore their reporting or polls (which are imperfect but scientific and meaningful)
@jerrymikestorie I‚Äôm glad you believe Trump is making your life and the country better than it was under BHO, but most Americans disagree with you.
@jerrymikestorie You assume I‚Äôm emotionally affected by Trump? Not really. He‚Äôs embarrassing for all of us but as long as he stays as completely ineffective as he‚Äôs been, a few years of him as President (or less) won‚Äôt hurt America too bad.
@travlr009 How many Republicans do you have to deem ‚Äúdiscredited‚Äù before you realize it is actually the President that has been completely discredited?
@miket24552 @mitchellvii If no collusion, why were Russians offering him help with his campaign and seeking eased sanctions? Why was his team responding by setting up meetings? Why has he tried several times to ease sanctions? Why have he and his team lied about 100 times about Russian contacts? Etc.
@miket24552 @mitchellvii I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to believe that Trump would work with our foreign enemy to get elected. I did, however, fully expect him to abuse power and obstruct justice if he was elected.
@miket24552 @mitchellvii Even if you don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs collusion, you don‚Äôt even see where they have obstruction of justice pretty nailed down?
@miket24552 @mitchellvii So this is just your guess and you agree she hasn‚Äôt been proved wrong on collusion? That‚Äôs what I figured.
@miket24552 @mitchellvii I understand saying collusion is still not proven but how has collusion been proven wrong?
@kjcolvin611 @mitchellvii Not quite. Just need a majority in house for impeachment. Then need Senate supermajority to convict.
@holmestwins You‚Äôre not going to get it. You hate the left more than you love America and it has blinded you to reality. You sound like a person 100% sure 2 plus 2 equals nine and calling anyone who tries to tell you that you‚Äôre wrong biased or unintelligent.
@holmestwins Midterm elections are how real patriots judge a successful president? I‚Äôm more focused on the America future generations will inherit. But at this rate, Democrats actually have a shot at the house and an outside chance at the Senate. Both seemed impossible 6 mos. ago.
@holmestwins My definition is that it means loving and revering your country and fellow citizens and striving to make both country and citizens the best they can be.  Apologies if you define patriotism differently.
@holmestwins Most liberals find me too conservative so I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.  Despising Donald Trump is not a liberal position. It is a patriotic American position.
@holmestwins Stock market is no real gauge of anything to do with the investigation. It has been increasing because investors believed a big corporate tax cut was coming. They don‚Äôt care if it is signed by Trump, Pence or Ryan.
@holmestwins Why should I care how the left treats an inaccurate piece of news? Even the corrected piece of news is very damaging to Trump.
I don‚Äôt think Dowd authored this tweet but it is not because of the use of the word ‚Äúpled‚Äù.  I‚Äôve seen lawyers make that exact mistake dozens of times in their motions and briefs. https://t.co/3jsN1dApKn

@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 If the Russia connection was a fraud invented by the left, this whole thing would have been moving in an exculpatory direction and collapsed. Instead, it has become more plausible and supported by evidence every month.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 I‚Äôve been hearing about these coming legal proceedings against the Clintons since 1991. Never going to happen. The Trump administration can‚Äôt even find enough on them to support assignment of a special prosecutor by Sessions.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 Have a nice day. Just know that every single time you have ever brought up Clinton while discussing Trump‚Äôs actions, everybody knew you were scared of the conversation and were trying to change the subject. Good luck.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 What do the Clintons have to do with anything? If you were correct, would that make Trump‚Äôs collusion with a foreign enemy or abuse of power acceptable?
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 Only about 20 percent of American households make 6 figures and many of those are not invested, benefit from government programs and/or won‚Äôt significantly benefit from this tax plan.  Numbers probably closer to 90 or 95 percent of Americans that will suffer.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 Just to be clear, I make enough money that upper class tax cuts and taking care of Wall Street over Main Street benefit me personally. I just don‚Äôt think that making me richer while leaving 85% of hard working Americans behind is good for the future of the country.

@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 Some of the evidence has been explained to you in this thread. Add in things like Trump officials responding to Russian offers of help and Trump‚Äôs refusal to impose sanctions, pro-Russia changing of Republican platform, etc. and impossible to say no evidence.
I am struggling to come up with a reason that a lawyer would have thought any version of that tweet was sound legal strategy. https://t.co/0dm1pqjcgl
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 I agree that Hillary was a flawed candidate. That was one of several reasons she lost. What does that have to do with the evidence of Trump colluding with Russia and abusing presidential power to cover it up?
@CollinRugg @Lhop963 How do you know that had nothing to do with collusion? Flynn‚Äôs conversation could have been part of the payback for getting Trump elected.
@MelindaThinker @holmestwins @steph93065 I still assume these are good people who are just stuck in a bubble devoid of facts but I guess it is on them if they watch nothing but FoxNews (but flip over to Alex Jones when Shep Smith is on).
@steph93065 What if the bar for being accused of racism is not as low as you and other Trump fans think it is? Maybe then you‚Äôd have to consider whether your words/actions are more legitimately racist than you realize.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 Zero in the past 10 months? That‚Äôs just a lie. With only the publicly released evidence, I‚Äôm 100% sure I could win on collusion with Russia under the civil standard and obstruction under the criminal standard.
@holmestwins @MelindaThinker @steph93065 No irony. No squirming. No whining. Just my honest legal analysis. If a President asks the head of the FBI to back off the investigation of someone he believes may have lied to the FBI, that‚Äôs probably obstruction of justice.

@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine I sincerely wish you were right but you‚Äôre not. This has proceeded like the investigation of not just guilty people but a group of very sloppy, very guilty people. There has not been a single shred of credible exculpatory evidence.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine How do the actions of people like Papadopolous, Manafort, Trump Jr., Kushner and Carter Page fit with your theory? They were all acting like people trying to collude with Russia.
@LindaSuhler @nytimes Most of the country now sees who Trump is and what he is doing. Any reputable journalist is guaranteed to seem anti-Trump by just printing the truth. There is nothing partisan or fakenews about it.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine Flynn is pleading guilty due to circumstances of one of those conversations. The Dems are feeling like winners already and odds are that Flynn gave up someone in Trump family to get this deal.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine Not allowed to talk to foreign enemies as a candidate if you‚Äôre going against American foreign policy or having foreign adversary help you get elected in exchange for favoritism upon being elected.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine Nobody manufactured emails and other contacts between Trump team and Russian officials seeking to collaborate or make Kushner set up back channel. CIA didn‚Äôt make Republican platform pro-Russia or prevent Trump from enforcing sanctions against Russia.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine Nothing is 100% proven but the days of calling the Russian collusion allegations a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù ended months ago. I think I could win a civil trial against Trump for collusion based only on the evidence that is public.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine Pardon might be possible. However, pardon could be obstruction if pardon‚Äôs purpose is to protect POTUS. Also, declining pardon could be part of Flynn‚Äôs deal.
@Buffbadbadger @Thomas1774Paine His acquittal after pleading guilty? Doesn‚Äôt work that way.

@Buffbadbadger @DNC Zero evidence? Yet it is enough evidence to convince 100% of the people who have actually seen all the evidence.

Listening to Hannity interview now. Moore sounds entirely unconvincing and shifts between denials and explanations for the thing he just denied. If you‚Äôre standing by him after this, you know you‚Äôre supporting a man who sexually exploited minors. https://t.co/EihH19TzI1

@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Have a good night
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I didn‚Äôt. Kneeling during the anthem is how they want to make their point but that point has nothing to do with the flag or vets.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I get that. But that‚Äôs not the same thing as saying that they are protesting the flag or even care about the flag when they‚Äôre kneeling.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I think you‚Äôre right to raise your family as you do but that you‚Äôre asking too much of others to see/do it your way.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt believe it is about the flag so I don‚Äôt know how I could admit anything like that.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter As did I. But there are some injustices that would make me respect their decision to kneel if they felt that was the best way to protest.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Personally, I‚Äôm standing with you. But for your example, if kneeling before is ineffective and fails to make the point, how can that work?
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter You can‚Äôt expect civilians to get that. Most Americans view the flag as an awesome symbol but less important than real people and actions.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter If no compromise possible, I honestly think the morality favors you kneeling over me standing. Their issues are historically life and death.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Spitting on you would be unacceptable. They‚Äôre just silently kneeling. You can still do it your way while they do it their way.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter What if I asked you to kneel with me because my community had experienced injustice that America wasn‚Äôt addressing?
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Everyone has values. By my values, intentionally attacking someone‚Äôs religion is worse than incidentally and mistakenly attacking the flag.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter They‚Äôre arguably pointing out a flaw in America. But I wouldn‚Äôt have been creative enough to expect someone to think I was against the flag.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Agreed
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter If I was kneeling to protest injustice in America, it would be about that injustice and have nothing to do with the flag or anthem or vets.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter 42
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I said I‚Äôd know what he meant but I wouldn‚Äôt obsess about it. And that is a far more obviously hostile gesture than kneeling.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I think you‚Äôd be disappointed if you knew how few Americans feel anything about the flag. But that doesn‚Äôt affect how you feel about it.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Maybe they don‚Äôt think it would draw the same attention to their claims of racial injustice to do it at other times.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Again. There is no reasonable argument that it‚Äôs not targeting Muslims. There is a reasonable argument the players aren‚Äôt targeting the flag
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter But it is not analogous. There is no non-hateful way to interpret the costume. I don‚Äôt think the players feel anything about the flag.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Right. You guys just don‚Äôt believe them when they say it is not about the flag. I disagree.I‚Äôd be stunned if they were considering the flag
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter So they should not kneel to protest racial injustice because many veterans have such a specific, deep relationship with the flag?
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter That‚Äôs what I would do if you wore that costume with that name. I‚Äôd know how you likely feel about Muslims but I‚Äôd move on with my day.
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I didn‚Äôt serve or pretend to. And I believe what the flag means to vets. But irrelevant because kneeling has nothing to do with the flag
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter You‚Äôre the ones trying to block something that offends you. They‚Äôre not trying to get rid of the flag or anthem.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Because you named it Moo-hammed!
@ronshank @Buffbadbadger @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter Not true. My family, full of vets, stands with hands on hearts. We revere the flag. But we don‚Äôt see kneeling as disrespecting the flag.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter If your goal was to disrespect the Muslims‚Äô god, they‚Äôd have more right to be mad than you do about kneeling. I‚Äôd prefer they also ignore.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter You could stand with hand on heart while everyone else kneels during the anthem and then forget it as you move on with the rest of your day
@ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Not true. Most players and many other Americans are crystal clear that this protest is not directed at the flag or our troops.
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt know why you would need to get a costume approved. If it is not meant as a sign of disrespect &amp; it can be ignored no one should care
@Buffbadbadger @ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt know what costume you‚Äôre referencing. Are you wearing a costume to protest injustice?
@ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Point is there isn‚Äôt consensus on this even among veterans, so the kneelers can kneel without having to assume that they‚Äôll offend all vets.
@ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter As long as it is peaceful, let them protest centuries of oppression, some of which they still experience, in their own way.
@ronshank @TodayIWillBeFit @Trish_E_Thib @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Vets don‚Äôt all agree that kneeling is an issue.

@bzazzie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter @NFL Do you notice how demeaning you can be in your generalizations of the players?

@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôve been careful not to word it that way because I don‚Äôt want cheap points. But have you spoken to numerous blacks about these issues?

@DLHay @The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Maybe they had more faith in your ability to comprehend what they are doing than they should have. I‚Äôd expect all patriots to support them.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter But other blacks are not the government so a protest would not make sense.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter My guess is that I‚Äôve spoken to dozens more black people about this issue than you have so I have a better idea how they might feel than you
@Buffbadbadger @The_Virg_ @DLHay @KurtSchlichter But yours is?
@Buffbadbadger @Longbow141 @n129bz @KurtSchlichter You choose to see it that way. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre attacking the flag or the vets. Many vets don‚Äôt even see it that way.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter And maybe they‚Äôre all innocent but odds are some are not. If I was black, I‚Äôd feel like the government can kill me without consequences.
@Buffbadbadger @The_Virg_ @DLHay @KurtSchlichter Contracts don‚Äôt allow for that. Maybe it‚Äôll lower some salaries in a few years but I doubt it.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @n129bz @KurtSchlichter You‚Äôre obviously obsessed with guessing if I‚Äôm liberal or DNC or Soros-funded rather than dealing with my argument.
@The_Virg_ @DLHay @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter The NFL has been tanking for a few years so it‚Äôs hard to say.But I don‚Äôt think the boycott will hit the NFL too hard. Maybe the owners a bit
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Agreed. But how would it feel if you were that race and they never get indicted or convicted? You‚Äôd feel powerless.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter You must be an imperfect driver or driving in odd places. I‚Äôve only been pulled over in my whole life when I‚Äôve been breaking a law.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter Agreed. Racism is an unhelpful concept because too many people disagree about what it means. I don‚Äôt care how you label some cop‚Äôs actions.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter Not all police are racist but way too many of them treat blacks differently than whites.
@zaida1212 @sgr3895 @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Do you want any of that free stuff? I don‚Äôt want or need it. Free stuff doesn‚Äôt help anyone get out of the situation.
@Buffbadbadger @JimFish56837379 @KurtSchlichter I hear it firsthand from the well educated, law abiding black people I work with and see socially.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Do you expect them to see it that way when they‚Äôre unjustly pulled over or their brother is shot by a cop who won‚Äôt be indicted?
@Buffbadbadger @Mike_H_1775 @sgr3895 @KurtSchlichter I think it is better now but not nearly good enough to repair centuries of abuse. So I see why they protest based on history and today.
@Buffbadbadger @Longbow141 @n129bz @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm sorry if liberals picked on you all your life but everything in the world is not driven by liberalism.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm against perpetual affirmative action but, again, not the same as being treated different by the police.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Disparate treatment by cops is not enough?
@DLHay @The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Their goal is not to piss off fans. The few of you that have chosen to be mad is an unfortunate byproduct of their attempt to protest.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Will a government official treat you worse because of your race when you walk in Chicago? If not, then it‚Äôs not the same thing.
@DLHay @The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter This is where you‚Äôre all just wrong. The protesters aren‚Äôt protesting veterans. You made that up to make what they‚Äôre doing seem bad.
@JimFish56837379 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Depends on the town. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a black person driving around in a nice car. I know police don‚Äôt pull me over in my nice car.
@TheNickTaylor90 @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Because they still are willing to fight to make America the country its Constitution promises it can be.
@DLHay @The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter If the form of protest is changing the way you show loyalty to the government, everyone should be allowed.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @n129bz @KurtSchlichter The approval polls are what they are. Even if I spot 5 points for MOE, he is historically despised and getting worse.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @n129bz @KurtSchlichter I wouldn‚Äôt know how to get a DNC talking point if I wanted to.
@TJDVET @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter If you‚Äôre right, what they‚Äôre doing is heroic. They are modern day patriots, making sacrifices you likely never will (unless military).
@TJDVET @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter You may be misunderstanding. Nobody is questioning the racial makeup of the NFL.
@Buffbadbadger @Longbow141 @n129bz @KurtSchlichter You are correct that America overwhelmingly dislikes Trump but there is still 30% of America that are still Trump fans.
@Longbow141 @n129bz @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter For now, I‚Äôm just suggesting we let players peacefully protest the fact the equalities exist. Nothing so revolutionary.
@Mike_H_1775 @sgr3895 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Regardless fault, America has historically treated blacks terribly. If you think the Ds have screwed them, you must get why they kneel.
@Longbow141 @n129bz @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Potential loss of sponsors, speaking engagements, etc. They‚Äôre also knowingly isolating a small percentage of their fans.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm trying to engage you on this but that‚Äôs not a practical solution.
@Longbow141 @99freemind @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm neither left wing nor interested in talking points, so you‚Äôll have to find another way to avoid the discussion.
@Longbow141 @n129bz @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Their willingness to suffer potential financial consequences speaks well of their motives.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Like return to segregation?
@sgr3895 @Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I admire their accomplishments, but most Asians aren‚Äôt digging themselves out of generations of poverty and oppression like blacks.
@Longbow141 @n129bz @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm not much of a leftist but it is indisputable that a peaceful protest against perceived racial injustice is a very American act.
@Longbow141 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter If you‚Äôre not a member of an oppressed race, how do you know if it is terrible or not?
@Kevincos372 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter You would need to decrease attendance by like 60% to have it affect salaries in the next year or two.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter Exactly, which is why most white supremacists don‚Äôt join the klan or wear a robe anymore. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an irrelevant statistic.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôm white. None of them have ever negatively impacted my life in any meaningful way. Have they impacted yours?
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter White supremacy can‚Äôt be measured by the number of members of any particular group.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter That statistic is completely meaningless. When BLM starts regularly lynching whites, we‚Äôll consider that a fair comparison point.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter We‚Äôre still on the heels of centuries of white supremacy and it is far from dead.
@TheRealAlinsky @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I hope you see the difference
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter White supremacy‚Äôs a historic scourge of the USA and deserves special negative treatment. If black supremacy gets there, it‚Äôll deserve it too
@TheRealAlinsky @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter That‚Äôs an unacceptable manner of protest. Very different than peacefully kneeling.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter Southern democrats used to be a big problem. Republicans have now taken that racist baton and carried it so far they don‚Äôt even realize it.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter As long as they don‚Äôt peacefully express themselves to make a point you disagree with.
@Buffbadbadger @bvkcitizen @KurtSchlichter You think this is sour grapes for losing an election? Kneeling started while Obama was president.
@Buffbadbadger @4RandyRoamer @The_Virg_ @KurtSchlichter @NFL I‚Äôm not in favor of perpetual affirmative action so you‚Äôre all barking up the wrong tree on those arguments.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter Don‚Äôt apologize for being white but have compassion for other races that have been historically not been treated as well as whites.
@Buffbadbadger @n129bz @KurtSchlichter I care about America way more than I care about a song or even a flag. Those symbols mean different things to different Americans.
@n129bz @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Your choosing to see the protest as disrespecting the flag and America rather than as acting in accordance with American ideals.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter They used to whine and fight and riot and commit crimes, etc. until they stopped being targeted.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter How many klan members do you think have been Democrats since around 1970?
@bvkcitizen @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Seems very fragile and like you‚Äôre retreating to a safe space but if you need that, go for it.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter If only there was a way to peacefully protest the government. Maybe we simply quietly, peacefully kneel during the national anthem.
@rn_deplorable @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Not really. There aren‚Äôt enough of you to make a difference that will affect contract amounts in the next few years.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter You‚Äôre so badly missing the point. It is not about the exact race/details of any particular incident.It is about decades of unjust treatment
@bvkcitizen @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter They don‚Äôt even usually show the national anthem. You‚Äôre choosing for it to affect your enjoyment.
@rn_deplorable @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter But if you‚Äôre a contract employee, you can‚Äôt be fired for not putting your hand over your heart during the morning pledge of allegiance.
@Buffbadbadger @bvkcitizen @KurtSchlichter Many blacks and some whites have had a different experience than that. They can express that however they want.
@bvkcitizen @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Like most of my conservative friends, the ones that weren‚Äôt that into football have ‚Äúboycotted‚Äù while the others are still watching.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter No. You‚Äôre confused. At will employees don‚Äôt need to sign those documents in most states because they can be fired for any reason.
@bvkcitizen @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter You do. But it seems weak to let them prevent you from watching a sport you love.
@Buffbadbadger @musejamie @KurtSchlichter Who cares how small a percentage it is if the police are treating blacks differently, sometimes resulting in death?
@Buffbadbadger @The_Virg_ @KurtSchlichter Dozens
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Millions or not, the owners don‚Äôt get to tell them what to do on every subject.
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I‚Äôve seen about fifty versions of similar numbers in these discussions and every time they completely miss the point.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Including that you need cause to terminate a person‚Äôs employment and can‚Äôt terminate ‚Äúat will‚Äù.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter They don‚Äôt sign up to be slaves so company doesn‚Äôt decide. A court will decide when they sue for wrongful termination. And they‚Äôll win.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter No court would ever find that the way you show patriotism is a moral issue.
@Mike_H_1775 @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Whether you subscribe to BLM or not, you must have seen countless examples of racial injustice in your lifetime.
@jhrusher @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter It would be a shame if they were forced to make that choice. Not very American.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter If they were at will employees, there is a slight chance a company could fire you for that. No way is that cause to fire contract employee.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Maybe they do both. Many ex NFL players are leaders in their communities.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt think a company can force you to show your patriotism by kneeling.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter But their outrage is obviously real if they are willing to risk offending people like all of you.
@HadynPkok @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter NFL was losing customers quickly regardless for many reasons. The majority of boycotters weren‚Äôt contributing much revenue anyways.
@The_Virg_ @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter They‚Äôre using it to draw attention to their belief that injustice is damaging America. Is there a law against that?
@Buffbadbadger @jtomka @KurtSchlichter This won‚Äôt affect these players. It takes years for something like that to impact a player salary.
@Buffbadbadger @The_Virg_ @KurtSchlichter How would anyone know they were protesting if they did it at an ordinary time?
@musejamie @Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre concerned about racial inequality in professional sports.
@Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter I don‚Äôt think they care if it costs the NFL money as long as they can make a point about injustice that matters more than money.
@Buffbadbadger @KurtSchlichter Because you don‚Äôt get to decide how they peacefully protest racial inequality.
@KurtSchlichter But Trump is a Hollywood celebrity that admits to abusing his celebrity and power to sexually assault women.
@whatsnews123 @PoliticalShort It is best for USA for Awan to suffer consequences if he committed crimes, along with anyone who intentionally conspired in the crimes.
@whatsnews123 @PoliticalShort So his actions should be imputed to all Democrats? All House Democrats? All DNC members? DWS?
I wouldn‚Äôt argue with anyone that wanted to boycott the NFL because of the crimes of its personnel. But foolish to boycott over kneeling. https://t.co/tipvce4gvf
@PoliticalShort All Democrats?
@ssullivan315 @GeorgiaDirtRoad Sorry! The Patriots rarely miss the Super Bowl.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery If your case is based on a snub by China and an insult by Duterte, you‚Äôre focusing on our enemies instead of our allies, which means nothing
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery Was it the peace or stock/job growth that you‚Äôre cleaning up from? Was it the world respect? Terrorists on the run? Unselfish leadership?
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery Nope. Undisputed facts. And none of those ‚Äúscandals‚Äù ended up implicating Obama or his people. Zero BHO associates had to plead the fifth.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery Debt growth under BHO a much smaller percentage than GWB. And DJT has a long way to go to match BHO‚Äôs stocks or jobs growth, which bury GWB.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery The stimulus worked. Saving the auto industry worked. Shifting tax cuts away from the rich worked. Inflating the real estate market worked.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery I didn‚Äôt say what I think. I said what history books will say about Obama killing terrorists and saving America from a depression.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery Real Americans celebrated that in 2008. And then the most scandal-free presidency since the 50s. Twice as many of us now favor BHO over DJT.
@ChrisMc32358642 @chuckwoolery I hope Trump ends up among the great Presidents but at this rate, our grandchildren will learn about Trump as a bottom 3 President all time.
@hopeful188 @chuckwoolery I‚Äôve been hearing about this ‚Äúmore to come‚Äù since 2004. Everyone who has said it has ended up looking like a fool.
@IDitrust @chuckwoolery We can MAGA all we want, your grandkids will still learn how the first black president killed OBL and oversaw peace and prosperity.
@chuckwoolery Obama is going into the history books as a top 15 president. Saved us from economic collapse and got us out of 2 wars. His legacy is safe.
@thor_benson How many messages about crooked IQ testers or dishonest IQ counters would @realDonaldTrump tweet while waiting for results?

I've been wondering when Trump was going to turn his CNN-obsessed guns toward NBC, who seems much more consistently critical of him than CNN https://t.co/qbAJPrE9Cq
@StoneChallenger Likewise. Good night.
@StoneChallenger The left has little credibility on this. Most don‚Äôt actually want to ban all guns but they‚Äôre afraid to promise that because of the far left
@StoneChallenger For what it‚Äôs worth, even if we disagree on gun control, we are of one mind when it comes to Tom Petty. Huge fan. Praying for a miracle.
@StoneChallenger That‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt ban all guns but the price for these guns to be legal is way too high. And then we work on preventing mass murder by car
@StoneChallenger Sadly, Newtown was the last time I was emotional about mass killings because they are inevitable until nutjobs lose access to these weapons.
@StoneChallenger But when they do, it creates an especially unacceptable situation. Newtown or Orlando could have been a tragic few deaths rather than dozens
@StoneChallenger Should still be illegal to make those modifications and the gun industry would not make it so easy.
@StoneChallenger Several times each year, some nut job gets murderous.  That‚Äôs only getting worse. What do you want him to have access to when he does?
@StoneChallenger Limits on semiautomatic rifles and high capacity magazines makes sense to me. Basically just demilitarize the weapons on American soil.
@StoneChallenger What would be wrong with laws that make it so if a shooter approaches a crowd of 50, he‚Äôll only get 4 or 5 before he‚Äôs jumped rather than 50
@StoneChallenger Wrong! I believe the 2nd Amendment has meaning. But it is not unlimited. I only want guns laws that could minimize these mass shootings.
Maybe reasonable gun laws will happen once enough Americans personally, directly suffer due to mass shootings. At this rate, likely by 2025 https://t.co/vrhBaflKwA
@Anthony37900265 @nextmegatrend @DineshDSouza You mean like the ones they bought highlighting support for Hillary among Muslim women? I‚Äôm sure that helped Hillary in WI, MI and PA.

@Anthony37900265 @nextmegatrend @DineshDSouza Russia bought ads to help Hillary? I haven‚Äôt seen any evidence of that. Was reported just last week they bought ads pushing BLM and Jill S.
@Anthony37900265 @nextmegatrend @DineshDSouza By forcing Antifa into his condemnation of Nazis, it gave the Nazis cover and implied that Nazis are the same as other controversial groups
@ChristiChat I hate restricting any freedom Americans have grown accustomed to but do you have a better plan than gun control to prevent mass shootings?
@Corrynmb Didn‚Äôt you just conflate your mourning for the victims with your hate of the left?
Exactly right! No fact set will ever be as compelling as Newtown and it inspired no action on guns. https://t.co/t3mbLhRRWI
Las Vegas doesn‚Äôt change the argument. The basic argument has stayed the same through Sandy Hook, Pulse, VA Tech, Charles Whitman, etc https://t.co/k9xNmQ1LgW
Honest 2A opponents will say they want to take away a right/freedom valued by many Americans rather than suffer occasional mass shootings. https://t.co/IkTPquDA0G
Mass shootings are an inevitable price of the right to bear arms. They‚Äôll keep happening and honest 2A advocates will say that‚Äôs acceptable. https://t.co/PL3fmAr7LI
Any chance we can all just agree that gun control is no better or worse an idea today than it was yesterday?

@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 Fair enough. Wouldn‚Äôt be my choice either but I don‚Äôt let it get to me and I‚Äôm certainly not giving up a sport I love because of it.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 So maybe they are misguided but as long as their sincere intent is to make America a better country, they are patriots even as they kneel.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty Because your intent is patriotic.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 If it divides America to the point that a percentage of Americans stop watching football, it will get plenty of attention.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 Can‚Äôt they do both?
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty That‚Äôs where you seem to have it backwards. If they are kneeling to improve America, they are more American than those that would deter them
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 I try to change one mind at a time. Often it is my mind that changes. Twitter makes that occasionally possible.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty The national anthem is your symbol and my symbol. All Americans do not revere it the same way and that is fine.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty If their employer supports it, which they do, then work is a fine place to do it. They were not hired for their ability to act patriotic.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 That‚Äôs what they said about MLK, Gandhi and almost every other serious protester.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 We‚Äôre having snippets of that conversation tonight, so I guess it is succeeding. Anyone who kneels to make America better is fine with me.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 I think they hoped it would start a national conversation about race and police abuse. It kind of did but also started discussions like this
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty A law like that would be way more anti-American than someone not going through a specific ritual during a song.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 But if they don‚Äôt, I hope they have found alternate ways that they can honor and connect to American values and sacrifices.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 Because of our love of freedom, we don‚Äôt traditionally require loyalty pledges or symbolic gestures in America.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty You‚Äôre making up rules that don‚Äôt exist. As long as they‚Äôre not preventing us from standing and holding our heart, they can do it their way.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty Why? Because they have a different interpretation than you and I? That‚Äôs their business.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 But because they are icons and symbols, you can‚Äôt expect everyone else to interpret them and interact with them the same as you.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty As will I. And that is what I‚Äôve taught my children. But I don‚Äôt get to decide how everyone else relates the national anthem to America.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty The anthem may be those things to you, but it is not all of those things to everyone. Some see it as an empty symbol unrelated to America.
@timmoore1973 If they‚Äôre breaking a clear, legal rule, they should be punished. But I hate the idea of a rule like that. Every gesture should be sincere.
@timmoore1973 @OklahomaLiberty Do we really want people going through the motions if it is not authentic? Seems like it robs my gesture of meaning.
@timmoore1973 The protesters don‚Äôt seem to see it that way. They think they can make a point by protesting during the anthem and still love America.
@jmviani @MediaOfTheLame @CarmineZozzora Apologies if I did not simplify my point so you could have understood.
@MediaOfTheLame @jmviani @CarmineZozzora I literally could not tell you a single thing about George Soros other than that I hear Hannity reference him constantly.
@OklahomaLiberty @timmoore1973 Because you are sponsored by America and representing America against other countries. As to other sporting events, it is just tradition.
@MediaOfTheLame @jmviani @CarmineZozzora I‚Äôm glad I have found you gentlemen willing to intellectually grapple with these difficult American issues at such a high level.
@jmviani @MediaOfTheLame @CarmineZozzora It may take you a little while but if you keep thinking about it, you‚Äôll figure out how I am addressing his point.
@timmoore1973 It is arbitrary to sing the national anthem before football. Personally, I enjoy it before the game but it has nothing to do with the game.
@MediaOfTheLame @CarmineZozzora Nobody died so they could make money or play football. I don‚Äôt show respect by singing the National Anthem before my work day. Do you?
@FoundersSeceded @DineshDSouza I‚Äôve spent a lifetime hearing southern racists complaining that the Democratic Party changed, forcing them to become Republicans.
@DineshDSouza If this reflected modern day party values, why do the former confederacy states overwhelmingly vote Republican now rather than Democrat?
@CarmineZozzora Present controversy notwithstanding, I can‚Äôt imagine that the national anthem is that important to enjoyment of a football game.
He fixed the typo and reposted, so someone now needs to convince him that he looks petty and distracted and should redelete. https://t.co/i6e8glMHTu

Of all the vile, horrible, destructive things Trump has done in the past year, making me retweet @KimKardashian is by far the worst! https://t.co/RKQRwKnFjM
@CarmineZozzora I considered possible party ID skewing through campaign but when dust settled, the national polls were comfortably within margin of error.
@CarmineZozzora Not sure about his poll but I don‚Äôt think polls were quite as discredited as you suggest. Polls can both be wrong and based on good science.
@CarmineZozzora Only major polling flaws were MI and WI. If you had those right, you would have seen plenty of paths for Trump.
@CarmineZozzora Not actually a poll but an attempt to throw a bunch of polls and scenarios into an algorithm. Some had it in the 90s.
@CarmineZozzora Those % chance of winning the electoral college polls were completely new/untested. The national popular vote polls were only about 2% off.
This statement doesn‚Äôt mean Trump‚Äôs racist. That oversimplifies a complex issue. But boy does he constantly say things a racist would say. https://t.co/NJhNx91Avq

@GuinnBonnie @Dandy7888 @Skinny_Steve_A1 @NolteNC Coney is not Obama. Dossier has not been disproved and none of this matters much if Manafort flips on Trump, which looks likely.
@Dandy7888 @GuinnBonnie @Skinny_Steve_A1 @NolteNC Actually, it sounds like there was evidence to support probable cause when they renewed the warrants because of Russian election involvement
@Dandy7888 @GuinnBonnie @Skinny_Steve_A1 @NolteNC Presidential signature is not required for FISA. And how do you know there was no probable cause that Manafort was working with Russia?
@Dandy7888 @GuinnBonnie @Skinny_Steve_A1 @NolteNC Why would Obama have to sign? FBI would just need Judge to find probable cause that Manafort was committing a crime.
@GuinnBonnie @Dandy7888 @Skinny_Steve_A1 @NolteNC I can. And I'm looking forward to reading that proof that Obama illegally targeted Trump for political reasons. Have you read that?

@Ange6H777 Two problems:	1. I'm talking about Bill; 	2. She got 3 million more votes than Trump.
@Ange6H777 So many factual failures. He'll go down in history books as the 1st black president who saved us from depression and pulled us out of 2 wars
@Ange6H777 Again, I thought Hillary would have been a much more effective President than Trump but I had issues with Hillary and I'm talking about Bill
@Ange6H777 Liberation theology seems compassionate but I am not an advocate of it and am only vaguely familiar with the details of it.
@Ange6H777 Again, I have not mentioned Hillary, who has never been President. She's fine but I'm not a huge fan.
@Ange6H777 I'm assuming they will have the freedom to access information without anyone hiding the truth.
@Ange6H777 That's where the fact that Clinton and Obama are beloved my the majority of Americans will help secure their place in history.

@BrainedinaVat @duckswtfpwn @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Antifa is a bit all over the place. It is historically against fascism/Nazis. Also appeals to anarchists, communists and idiotic thugs.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump They absolutely legally had the right. Then they should have been made to feel rejected, like pariahs and uniquely unAmerican by all of us.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump If that's in accordance with BLM principles, I'm with you.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Dallas is a problem and shows that BLM has a responsibility to make sure their rhetoric can't be misunderstood in that way.
@BrainedinaVat @duckswtfpwn @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Probably true but 6 months or even a few years doesn't get Antifa into the elite, uniquely unAmerican group with WS and Nazis.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump It's not ignored and if I could be convinced that BLM is responsible for a series of police deaths, I'll consider putting them wit WS/Nazis.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump As a matter of tactics, my mind is open to ignoring rather than confronting. However, I like that WS/Nazis feel confronted and stigmatized.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Because by not separating the conversations, I am using BLM/Antifa to mitigate against WS/Nazis. I'd be implying that they are similar.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump BLM has racists among them. However, I've scoured their mission and principles and didn't find it anti-white (outside certain implications).
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump They'd say they were triggered by the WS/Nazis. Nobody should get a pass. But WS/Nazis have been a unique stain on America for generations.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump He didn't make it clear that WS views have a uniquely terrible place in American life. In fact, he lumped it in with the others.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Likewise
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Yes but all good Americans should have clarified that their views are aberrant and unacceptable, much worse than even other terrible views.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump By making it consistently clear that proponents of WS are enemies of America and intolerable to patriots. It starts with our leaders.
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump But following centuries of slavery and discrimination, as well as the holocaust, America must always treat WS as a disease to be eradicated.
@BresPolitico Well oiled machine!

@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump I don't see a lot of momentum for enslavement to the state or stamping out free speech. If that changes, I'm with you. For now, let's end WS
@duckswtfpwn @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Maybe. But most are just against fascism/white supremacists. Let's deal with Nazis only for now &amp; deal with Antifa if they become a problem
@StoneChallenger @NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Do you think it is the mass murder aspect of communism they are attracted to? But white supremacists are attracted the WS aspect of Nazis.
@NotShadowbanned @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Even if true, they're still exponentially better than Nazis.
@ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Because it is not everyone. A substantial percentage of the country does not realize that equivocating Nazis and Anti-Nazis is unAmerican.

@Ange6H777 National polls said Hillary by 4. It was Hillary by 2. So polls aren't perfect but they're valuable and right way more than they're wrong.

@Ange6H777 Didn't Sharpton chant that in the early 90s? Long before BLM or Dallas.
@Ange6H777 If BLM people begin regularly murdering cops and it is shown that the organization is encouraging murder, I'll be right there with you.
@Ange6H777 Do you think the 63% of Americans that approve of Obama are blind or is it possibly you who is blinded to his contribution and leadership?
@Ange6H777 Maybe media properly determined that killing policemen had no historical or other connection to BLM principles. Can't say same for WS/Nazis.
@Ange6H777 I can accept someone who sincerely repents and works against WS like Byrd did.Also, Byrd has nothing to do with Hillary. Neither do I really
@Ange6H777 I didn't start as part of the resistance but I'm pulled closer to it each day. I thought despite some weaknesses, Obama was good for America
@Ange6H777 I'm saying that white supremacy is a historical scourge &amp; has to be eradicated without reference to other arguable wrongs, including Antifa.
@Ange6H777 I'm fine with non-violent attempts to stop Trump. By the way, how can you tell these all have anything to do with Antifa?
@Ange6H777 I also didn't bring up Charles Manson murders, Sandy Hook, Orlando or a thousand other terrible acts irrelevant to the conversation at hand.
@ToddKrieger1 @gatewaypundit @BarbMuenchen @POTUS No. Strong evidence of racism. Unequivocal evidence of tolerance of racism.
@Burghgirl69 @ToddKrieger1 @gatewaypundit @BarbMuenchen @POTUS Consent order from 70s for housing discrimination, repeated refusal to unequivocally condemn racists/Nazis, witnessed racist statements, etc
@Ange6H777 It's simple. I'm against fascism and white supremacy. I'm also against unnecessary violence.  Arrest Antifa if laws broken. Ignore otherwise
@Ange6H777 Point isn't the nuance of their definition of fascism. Point is Antifa's never been a major threat. Comparisons to actual threats are silly.
@Ange6H777 I don't see a call to violence and their core belief is the end of fascism. I am also against fascism. Are you?
@howardfineman The left needs to be careful not to let Trump move the argument over his actual tolerance of racism to one over symbolic tolerance of racism
@Ange6H777 @davidmweissman @KNP2BP If Antifa's violence increases dramatically, then we should deal with them accordingly. It hasn't happened yet and most doubt it ever will.
@ToddKrieger1 @gatewaypundit @BarbMuenchen @POTUS There's unequivocal evidence Trump is supportive and tolerant of racists. There is only strong, but not unequivocal, evidence he's a racist.
@Ange6H777 @davidmweissman @KNP2BP I agree that Antifa crosses the line and should be arrested when they do. But, as of now, Antifa is almost no threat to innocent Americans.
@ichabod_krane @davidmweissman @KNP2BP Which cause is that? Are Muslims against fascism/discrimination? No. If anything they are for those things. Does Antifa care about religion?
I'll give Trump credit on this one. Elevating cyber defense is the right thing to do and crucial for the future of American security. https://t.co/ql5e5hqeJV
@Ange6H777 @davidmweissman @KNP2BP How many terrorist murders have been committed by Antifa? Is it the tens of thousands committed by radical Muslims? Is it even ten? Any?
I believe a case could be made that some government protection powers have been too limited by courts.I don't believe Trump knows which ones https://t.co/AXAVdnWBd3
@davidmweissman @KNP2BP Yes. You need to say more than to just show two vaguely similar pictures. Are you saying Antifa are actually radicalized Muslims?
@BillKristol How are Republicans missing the fact that America's other problems can all wait until the problem in chief is solved.

@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Exactly! That is why I put more blame on the white supremacists than the other violent idiots that showed up later.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Those facts don't change anything. Point is, on Friday, there were torch bearing white supremacists marching and chanting.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Early reporting indicates so. If it turns out to be wrong, I'll apologize but I'm pretty comfortable with the conclusion
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Apologies to the tiny percentage of people walking with the group carrying racist signs and chanting racist things if they had other motives
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 It was specifically in response to the removal of the Lee statue. Not my opinion. Fact.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 That one was the reason for the rally, the direct motive for the terrorist and a major American problem for centuries.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Now that is accurate. Varying degrees of racism exist in a meaningful portion of his hardcore base. Not all, but a few percentage points.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 He didn't use the language he used today, which I said he would eventually. I thought you'd be able to see how that differed from Saturday.

@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I assumed you forgot that I said Trump would be forced to make statement explicitly naming white supremacy and that you'd see the difference
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 One last time. Obama was making a strategic decision as commander in chief. Trump was making sure he didn't lose the racist part of his base
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Anytime someone I am arguing with is definitively proven wrong, I am going to remember it. Most arguments don't end with a clear victor.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I wasn't outraged. It was a reasonable strategy but I didn't think it turned out to be overly effective.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Plenty of capacity for you and any other free renters. But I just wanted to close the loop on my prediction that Trump would do what he did.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 We've established that he thought it was counterproductive to call out Islam in relation to terrorism.I've even said I question the strategy
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 To be honest, you fire off multiple messages at a time so inevitably some are going to come through and get missed while I'm responding.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I don't know about belligerent but he did believe that there were many on the right that were not even trying to understand his strategy.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 In fact, I now see it came in between the messages so I never saw it
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I'm not playing games. That's a different message than the one I responded to so apologies if I forgot you said it several messages ago.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 For Obama the omission was intentional and strategic. You've been telling me Trump didn't omit anything so it is apples and oranges.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I didn't think the conservative part was the point you were making and you threw "white" in there after the fact
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Obama was a Christian so I'm not sure what allegiance you're talking about. Do you mean his outreach to moderate Muslims?
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Of course white conservative Christians have an important place in America. Have I implied otherwise?
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Obama believed referencing Islam in any way following terror was counter to his strategy to engage moderate Muslims.Not sure if he was right
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Of course Christians do.
@islandbloodline @classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Anyone who believes in killing Jews also has no place in America. That includes Muslims that believe in that.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 You said Islam so I don't know what you mean.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Because Islam has a place in America. Terrorism and white supremacy do not.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Would you be satisfied if Bush was asked if he condemned terrorism after 9/11 if he said he condemned violence in all of its forms?
@classicconservv @ga_undrdawg @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 If so, then her and everyone else targeting others because of any race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. have no place in America.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 He should say it to be a leader on racial issues, not to appease me. Although I agree that today's statement was appeasement not leadership.
@classicconservv @ga_undrdawg @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Was that driven by race or some other ideology? Article wasn't clear.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 If there's no difference, why did he do it today in the different way I was suggesting?
@peddoc63 BLM/Antifa irrelevant unless you're arguing that white supremacy is acceptable in America because of other bad groups. I don't think you are
@peddoc63 Arguably a fair point any other day. Just not today.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Did you see the difference today? Trump condemned racism and said white supremacists were repugnant to America. That's what was missing.

@classicconservv @FrancisTuker @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 You claimed infection with deep anti white racism
@classicconservv @FrancisTuker @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 His point is sarcastic but fair. Being white has been a pretty easy ride for millennia and, in America, for centuries.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 White supremacists get repudiated by everyone except you apparently. I've given you several chances.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 I know it exists but has anti white racism ever been a national problem in this country? Anti black racism certainly has.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 If those were the core beliefs of those groups, I would be right there with you. But that's not how I've heard them describe their message.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 So you don't need to repudiate the core message of Antifa or BLM. Do you repudiate the core message of white supremacists?
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Generalities are weak and make the groups he is afraid to name believe he is inviting them to the table.
@classicconservv @Texas_Eric1 @peddoc63 Are you against fascism and white supremacists? Do you agree that black lives matter as much as the lives of other races? If so, you agree.

@alvinwarrenkin1 @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb That's just an attempt to flip historical "back of the bus" discrimination on its head. It's not actually promoting black supremacy.

@alvinwarrenkin1 @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb Is so, that's wrong. It is possible you're misinterpreting their actions though. I've never understood blacks to be claiming superiority.

@salia_matra @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb And I believe blacks are reacting to their experiences, not statistics.
@salia_matra @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb It seems much less cruel when blacks do it. Kind of how I wouldn't think kindly of a men's rights march but don't condemn women's rights.
@Jonpatriot @mwz524 @jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama And we agree the democrats lost seats the past 8 years. More Pelosi's fault than Obama's. But wildly popular ex president can only help.
@salia_matra @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb Generally correct. But I understand why a minority race that has been treated as inferior and killed by cops would bother showing some pride
@Jonpatriot @mwz524 @jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama You could say same about Reagan and Clinton, who lost seats during their presidency. Obama is also more popular now than early in his term.
@salia_matra @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb Being proud of my race is nothing I've ever thought about. I just happened to be born white. I've also never been proud I can roll my tongue
@peddoc63 How are you missing that this is just another leader trying to flatter our easily manipulated President? You don't want this leaked.
@Atdemons666 @Corrynmb Their stated principle is that they're against fascism and white supremacists. I'm against those things as well.Doesn't excuse their actions
@SsGoldfish @salia_matra @Corrynmb Agreed. If you hate either the white or black race you are incredibly weak and wrong.
@Bogeyman2017 @mwz524 @jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama You should get out more. Your list of top lifetime mistakes indicates you are living a historically uninteresting life.
@Atdemons666 @Corrynmb I agree with Antifa core principle but actions are inconsistent with the principle. I disagree with white supremacists on principle/action.
@SsGoldfish @salia_matra @Corrynmb Then it sounds like we can agree that these white supremacists are weak and abnormal.
@salia_matra @lemzia @Corrynmb Okay. But I was responding to the comment saying the left are the white supremacists.
@SsGoldfish @Corrynmb I don't let my kids blame others for their bad behavior and I'm not going to give racists a pass because the left overplays the racist card.
@Atdemons666 @Corrynmb I don't like Antifa's behavior/approach. At its core, being against fascism is exponentially more American than being against black people.
@salia_matra @SsGoldfish @Corrynmb Only a weak normal guy would turn their frustration into hate for an entire race.
@salia_matra @lemzia @Corrynmb Fair point and I don't like identity politics. But it is ridiculous to call democrats white supremacists because of events in the 1800s.
@SsGoldfish @Corrynmb I'm not playing word games. White supremacists can't blame their attitude/behavior to on identity politics messaging by Democrats.
@lemzia @Corrynmb Who cares how it started? The Dems have consistently condemned white supremacists like the KKK for generations now.
@Corrynmb Ridiculous! The white supremacist movement predates modern gender politics by centuries.
@Corrynmb Never mind Antifa. The fact that white supremacists still exist offends everyone who believes in American values.
@Medicant_Legacy @cmclymer Did BLM or Islamists do something specifically offensive last night or are do we need to condemn both every time any group acts badly?
@Jonpatriot @mwz524 @jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama Obama's approval is over 60 percent. He will be a huge money maker and vote getter in most districts.
@humdinger41 Agreed. But Presidents' jokes send serious messages.And shouldn't be allowed to joke to avoid giving straight answers to important questions
@heymerlin11 @_Makada_ No new facts or reconsideration by IC. Just an article that raises appropriate questions. Wouldn't change Podesta hack/leak anyways.
@mwz524 @jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama America reelected BHO by big numbers and his approval is still high. Also, HRC was qualified (White House, Senate and State experience)
@CarrieKHutchens The extremist is simply wrong about the characteristics of "Americans at our best." Worse, most extremists think they fit the description.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Trump will back it up and hundreds of thousands of people, including Americans, will die and we won't even completely eradicate the nukes.
@CarrieKHutchens You do. I do. We'll disagree or meet in the middle but it is important to know what "Americans at our best" act like and to act accordingly
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Agree he inherited a huge problem and it is not his fault. That doesn't justify tough talk that NK will mock and challenge, forcing his hand
@CarrieKHutchens If you're talking about Americans at our best, you can talk about who "we" are. But not if you're talking about the far left or far right.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Unfortunately, we've never had clean intelligence on their program so we've had to assume the worst. Obama admitted he didn't clean the mess
@CarrieKHutchens Would you prefer "If that is who you are, you don't stand for the ideals that define America."
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Agree with the thought but I can't hit Obama too hard since they had nukes by the mid-2000s and would have unleashed on their neighbors.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics There was no good outcome then either. I wish Clinton, Bush or Obama had solved it but every option ended in destruction of Seoul or Tokyo.
@jessbriis @thehill @BarackObama Most Americans disagree with you.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Blame for a nuclear North Korea is useless. It has been inevitable for decades. Trump now badly failing to prevent them from firing one.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics Let's both hope Trump has the same wisdom and strength to hold fire when NK crosses his redline by testing a missile, which they will.
I can always tell a true fiscal conservative by the way they stop defending Trump and hang their head when I point to the travel expenses. https://t.co/WlL5uycbBs
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics The world didn't see him as weak. Really only the right in this country did. He didn't want to lose thousands of Americans for minimal gain.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics I agree. Obama should not have bluffed if it wasn't in our interest to back it up. But it would have been worse if he did back it up.
@Sloemoe11 @CNNPolitics To be clear, do you actually want him to attack NK? If not, he's just your loudmouth buddy that talks trash at the bar and can't back it up
@bfraser747 @TerreBehlog NK loves Trump's rhetoric and prays the left is unable to silence him. Trump invited NK to the world stage. They just keep pushing buttons.
@kokoeverett @bfraser747 Maxine Waters is also reckless. If you want to understand the left's attitude toward Trump, picture how you'd feel if Waters was President.
@JosephMarsilio1 @bfraser747 If Trump's election was legitimate then his presidency is unfortunate but legitimate. Would be a high bar for impeachment or 25th amendment.
@jstines3 Obama was there long enough to build the current strong stock and job market.
@JosephMarsilio1 @bfraser747 Constitution not an inconvenience. Barring Russian collusion, I respect the electoral college. Doesn't change that he's a danger to us both.
@JosephMarsilio1 @bfraser747 National polls were only about 2% off, which isn't too bad considering the Wikileaks and Comey volatility. Well within margin of error.
@PalmerReport I doubt it is racial. I imagine if Putin didn't get their guy elected, the right would be cheering for us to nuke Putin too.
@JosephMarsilio1 @bfraser747 More Americans were willing to vote for a hated person like Hillary and the number who dislike Trump has only increased since he took office
@JosephMarsilio1 @bfraser747 The majority of Americans disagree with you and believe Trump has more potential to harm our country than help.
@bfraser747 That's because Trump's doing a terrible job protecting us from terrorists or international enemies. Attacking Trump is to protect America.
@_Makada_ 1. I haven't heard anyone who doesn't want to defend USA from attack.	2. IC says Russia hacked election. Neither you nor I have better info.

@BiglyTrumpette @peddoc63 Challenged? The Supreme Court is the end of the challenges.
@elteec98 @rancher523 @LindaSuhler Nobody has convicted Trump without evidence. They just expect that once the evidence is gathered, there will be plenty to convict him.
@mitchellvii Reagan also won the popular vote by almost 17 million votes.
@peddoc63 Didn't the Supreme Court rule that Obamacare was constitutional?
@TheMarkRomano @sweetatertot2 But the reality is that voter ID laws massively deter legitimate voters and nobody has been able to justify that level of voter suppression.
@CpaCarter @DrJacaranda @peddoc63 Or perhaps you should look where you're standing if Obamacare looks like a far left government takeover of our healthcare system.
@ErickB556 @awhite_hispanic @InfiniteBastard @peddoc63 It's my understanding that these premium issues are affecting even the majority of people who get health care from their employers.
@InfiniteBastard @awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 No doubt. It needs to be shored up. But it was obvious from the beginning that it would need to be fixed down the road.
@InfiniteBastard @awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 Unacceptable, but I'm not convinced that would not have happened if no health care law was passed. That was the trajectory 10 years ago.
@EWErickson Pro lifer: you are trying to simplify a complex issue.
@RetiredMan01 @peddoc63 If communism was here, 60 Senate Ds and a D-controlled house wouldn't have given us Ocare instead of single payer or even the public option.
@awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 I can't speak for leftists but I'm outraged. However, I these are among the reasons we need to enact a series of fixes.
@RetiredMan01 @peddoc63 Ownership is a critical difference. Saying it is just semantics is a dangerous invitation to communists.
@awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 That was never how it was supposed to work. But everyone knew it would need to be tweaked after a few years to prevent situations like yours
@awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 If true, I'm sorry to hear that but are you certain that wouldn't have happened even if Obamacare never passed?
@miamirach2013 @peddoc63 Don't assume everyone who disagrees with you is under informed.I'm crystal clear on employment &amp; debt figures and still see plenty of excess
@ErickB556 @awhite_hispanic @peddoc63 Exactly. That was the primary problem we were trying to solve 8 years ago. Doing nothing did not seem to be working.
@awhite_hispanic @ErickB556 @peddoc63 If America clearly voted to repeal, it would be repealed. Costs were skyrocketing before Obamacare. That was why healthcare was a priority.
@wickedgrin1 @peddoc63 Not for its own sake. It used government to try to bring down crippling costs and get access for less wealthy citizens. Only achieved access
@miamirach2013 @peddoc63 That's a completely fair argument. I agree it is a luxury for our citizenry, not a right. Where I disagree is that I think we can afford it.
@RetiredMan01 @peddoc63 The leftist approach actually is to seize 1/5 of the economy. Obamacare doesn't do that. It didn't even make the government an insurer.
@peddoc63 If I were against Obamacare, I'd be frustrated too. I see the problems but prefer Obamacare to where we were 10 years ago.
@peddoc63 Point is that Obamacare isn't the leftist approach. It was an attempt at a centrist compromise.

@Slyrus3 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I didn't know I was arguing for a legacy. Just a specific point about predecessor president impacting the next president.
@rancher523 @LindaSuhler I get it but Fox has to know the permanent damage to his reputation that this suspension will cause. They wouldn't do it lightly.
@patriotusa77b @LindaSuhler Everyone should reserve judgment until the facts come out.
@patriotusa77b @LindaSuhler But if a woman complained she received an unsolicited picture, HR would definitely ask to see it before they suspend a public figure.
@LindaSuhler I hope it turns out to be false but I don't think Fox would suspend him unless they were convinced there's something there.

@peddoc63 I blame POTUS. He never gave policy direction for a bill. By just asking for anything he could sign and call a repeal, he made it impossible

@terrymendozer @TetrologyGaming Do doctors diagnose transgenders as having a medical condition? If not, there should be no medical reason they can't serve.

@TetrologyGaming @AlexandriaBaum @terrymendozer I would have to meet the person to know how they would handle in a firefight
@TetrologyGaming @terrymendozer I'm not aware of any evidence that transgender people are more weak minded/willed than others. Is there any such evidence?
@TetrologyGaming @terrymendozer I didn't say they are special. Just that they are human and should be treated accordingly.
@terrymendozer Even if you aren't a transgender rights advocate, do you disagree with the basic idea that transgender rights are human rights?

@4truth2017 @RealJack I fully expect that there is a variety of incriminating evidence on the DNC server. That doesn't mean they were trying to frame Russia.
@4truth2017 @RealJack I can think of many reasons the DNC didn't want to turn servers over to a heavily leaking FBI. Nobody who knows disputes that it was Russia.
@4truth2017 @RealJack I'd like to hear from everyone who knows anything about Russia's attack on our election but I'm not seeing where Awan is connected.
@TexasChick1968 @Thriftymom7 @peddoc63 @DWStweets Did the servers belong to the DNC or Hillary or DWS? If not, aren't they probably just related to Awan's fraud? Seems pretty thin.
@4truth2017 @RealJack I'm not seeing how the server it fits with Awan's alleged bank fraud but it is possible. Without more, not much of a story at this point.
@4truth2017 @RealJack Any reason to think any of that relates to wrongdoing by DWS or other prominent Dems?
@Thriftymom7 @peddoc63 @DWStweets Give me an example of the "more". I want to give this the same level of scrutiny I'm giving the allegations against Trump.

@TrueFactsStated Something about the threat to the Iran deal as I recall.
@wynnroar @tammych84834131 @Cernovich Okay. But what would he be revealing about the dems? Something specific or do you just assume the dems are dirty somehow?
@wynnroar @Cernovich But how will all this turn into a scandal for the left? I'm open minded but not understanding the theory.
@swedishgirl7 @RyanAFournier A majority of Americans want Congress to fix Obamacare rather than scrap it. It is not perfect but the other options are way worse.
@Cernovich I am struggling to figure out the scandal here. Wasn't Awan arrested for theft?
@RealJack I'm willing to consider anything here but what is the scandal? Wasn't Awan arrested for theft?
@AnneRiceAuthor Roger won't like you interfering with his lifelong dream of a USA with no credible press to catch him in his schemes and crimes.

@thunderbow98 @Fun_EE1 @RyanAFournier There's no such thing as government coverage. That was the public option the Ds wanted. Obamacare was the attempt to compromise with Rs.

@elementOz @RealJack The Don Jr. email alone would be plenty for probable cause. As would Flynn discussion, Kushner back-channel, lies about meetings, etc.
@ErickMpala @RyanAFournier But the American people's premiums will skyrocket under the repeal/replace bill and many will lose coverage. Why would we want that?
@ChadOconnor75 @RyanAFournier Polls were only off by 2 points in Clinton/Trump election. Not perfect but within MOE.
@foreverracin @RyanAFournier Clinton was not supposed to win by overwhelming numbers. She was expected to win by 4. She won by 2.
@elementOz @RealJack From the Steele Dossier to the Jr email, every judge in America would find that there is probable cause to deepen the investigation.
@RyanAFournier But the people want to keep Obamacare now by overwhelming numbers. Is that what you're suggesting?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The difference is that nobody ever believed that Trump would do anything for non-wealthy Americans. I believe the Ds will at least try.

@DeplorableNew @RealJack Do you mean proof like what comes at the end of an investigation? At this point there's tons of strong evidence that'll likely become proof.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Sure. It wouldn't change my life if HRC went to jail. She's not President so it doesn't seem nearly as important as investigating Trump.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Correct. He remains innocent until he is proven guilty. Which should be sometime in September at this rate. Good night.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack As long as Hillary didn't lose because Russia teamed up with Trump, you're absolutely right and everyone should move on.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack You seem bright and engaged but you're wrong. Even if you believe DJT is innocent, the investigation is not related to MSM or liberal bias.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack If it proves my President was legitimately elected despite a remarkable number of coincidences casting doubt, it won't be time/money wasted.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Nothing definitive yet but even just the publicly released evidence is pretty compelling. It gets closer every week.
RT @DeplorableNew: @WhineDetector @RealJack No proof of any collusion with the trump campaign. So no act of war!
@DeplorableNew @RealJack There is lots of evidence of potential collusion that justifies the investigations. The investigations still have to definitively prove it.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack If that happened, it is unacceptable and potentially illegal
@DeplorableNew @RealJack As long as the Russians released the information without coordination with the Trump campaign it is an act of war but fair game for election
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Nobody ever seriously claimed there was evidence of hacking the ballots. Plenty of other ways to swing a close election.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack And plenty of ways for Russia to influence votes by disseminating both real and fake information or coordinating with one campaign.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Was never 17 that found interference. Just 17 that agreed with the definitive finding of the only four that did their own analysis.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack Four agencies investigated and analyzed the evidence. The heads of four agencies concluded Russia interfered to help Trump.
@elementOz @RealJack I don't see the conspiracy you see. We need to be sure that Russia didn't help DJT in exchange for concessions or because he was compromised
@DeplorableNew @RealJack The only remaining debate/investigation is precisely why Russia tried to help Trump to win and/or HRC to lose.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack There has been unanimous public testimony by everyone familiar with the intelligence gathering and investigation that Russia favored Trump
@DeplorableNew @RealJack That Russia wanted Trump to be President is undisputed. Hillary was tough on Russia. Question is whether they knew Trump would be compliant.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack I'm fine with that as long as an enemy nation is not stealing and disseminating info on one candidate but not the other.
@DeplorableNew @RealJack If the hacks/releases were done by an American I'd agree with you. But when an enemy nation does it to decide our election, it's intolerable
@DeplorableNew @RealJack MI, WI, PA and FL all had about 1% margin. Of course HRC's mistakes were more than enough to swing all four. So were Russian email hacks.
@billbong9059 @steph93065 @SpeakerRyan But it takes at least 8 months for a POTUS's actions to affect the economy. Other than a bit of positive sentiment for Trump, that's all BHO
@billbong9059 @steph93065 @SpeakerRyan Also got us out of 2 wars, put ISIS and Al Qaeda on their heels and built strong economy. And this is from someone who's not a big BHO fan.
@billbong9059 @steph93065 @SpeakerRyan Obama passed Ocare, stimulus, auto bailout, financial regs, etc. in addition to EOs. Trump has only done the EOs, which are easily undone.
@RealJack It was a very close election. That means about a hundred things swung the result. It is moronic to claim Russia is not among those causes.
@steph93065 @SpeakerRyan Every President does the things that don't require building consensus. Not a real accomplishment. Remember all of Obama's executive orders?
@NolteNC Did Ryan forget to follow the fictional MAGA script about Mueller? Must be very frustrating for you.
@DanScavino Good talking point but the Russia investigation has nothing to do with trying to excuse HRC's loss at this point.
