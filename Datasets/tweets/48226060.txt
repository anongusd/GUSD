@SheriffClarke @SteveScalise @SebGorka I think that is a great question. I think one of the main reasons is we still have members of Congress who call themselves Republicans and Conservative but are nothing more than hidden liberals with their own agenda.
@WalshFreedom I am 100% Republican — going back to high school/college making judgments on the dumb attempts to be funny I do not think is right. It was not fair when people did it to Kavanaugh it is not fair now.

@LoveTruthin @spartacus1978 Looks more like a list of thugs. @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC
@TomiLahren I could care less as well but some people eat that up so who cares let them have what they want
@Melindapre0902 Happy Birthday Thank You for your service be safe
@dbongino This feels so much like another Comey deal; trying to influence elections.
@SenSchumer So people really believe this nonsense? If they do it I’d because they want to not needing any facts or evidence. I guess you do know your audience!!!
@WayneDupreeShow That would be so cool seeing Trump whoop her again
RT @AnnCoulter: They should hand the Khashoggi investigation to Mueller.  Give that pitiful man a real crime to investigate.
@greta Wow hard to imagine any of them but I hope they do nominate one of them would pretty much guarantee 4 more years for President Trump. The DNC would be better off finding a Democratic Governor and hope for lightning in the bottle like Clinton or Carter
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Of course she has which is amazing how she can be so stupid; I shake my head she is one of the leaders of the DNC
@SenSanders This is what is confusing with people like you when you support socialism and socialist programs and then you talk about Democracy when we all know you do not care about Democracy. Just be honest
@Jim_Jordan This should equal people losing jobs and going to jay and some permanent oversight for any FISA process concerning American citizens
@MSNBC Why cannot you wait for some facts before you start spreading gossip. How about investigate yourselves and for a real change report honestly
@RealJamesWoods @LindaSuhler @CNN 100% true #forever
@RealJamesWoods Amazing she can say she is proven right with out breaking up laughing. I guess when you lie and deceive on a daily bases what does this manner just another lie.
@ainsleyearhardt @dbongino @foxandfriends @AlecBaldwin is an asshat cannot believe he keeps getting his 15 minutes

@FoxNews @foxnewsnight Let’s see it. I do not think we want anymore convictions without proof again.
@FoxNews I fear we will never see this stuff. They can say and do whatever they want. The only way we can see the materials and have the truth exposed is President Trump will have to de-classify and let them go public
@FoxNews @nikkihaley Truth for sure but the UN is so corrupt I doubt anything will change a lot like the DNC
@SenFeinstein You do not deserve any kind of respect your lack of morals and ethics during the Kavanaughs persecution was shameful. I learned more about you the last few months than all the years you been in politics. You are a sad excuse for a US senator. @foxnews @cnn @msnbc

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @JimBrownNFL32 very proud these two guys are trying to help their community and save lives more power to them
@BreitbartNews I think the way Kanye spoke was not fitting for the White House but what he said was totally coherent. @jimmykimmel and others have such an irrational view of Trump they cannot view anything fairly. Sad really

@DailyCaller @Google @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews good to see a prominent Democrat can show his impressive creativity and colorful use of the English language. I think he missed out on a couple of participation trophies growing up
@RealJamesWoods @LindaSuhler Hillary is delusional but I love the idea of her running for President again but the Dems could not be that stupid can they?
@SheriffClarke I was always hesitant to have one of my guns loaded at home when my son was young. I trusted him but he had friends around all the time. However now I totally agree if you have a gun for protection it should be loaded and almost immediately accessible in the time of need.
@DannyMacTV @Cardinals I say the Cardinals should just break the ice with Bryce Harper and offer him 10-year 300 million starting number
@CNN How do we know she told the truth?
@Skilrock @KristenPowersTV  I know you have very little creativity on your own but how about stop going with the Democratic talking points all the time so boring.
@marcorubio Very good point there is no way @CNN or @MSNBC or network news or most newspapers would remotely let this go if the Republicans or the Koch brothers were paying to cause chaos we see on our TVs recently.

@timkaine Stop the lies you need to be an American first and a lying Democrat a distant second
@KirstenPowers What Susan Collins did was courageous and thoughtful on her part. The reason you and @maureendowd have a problem with her is you disagree with her; that is it. That is too bad #snowflakes #truthhurts
@chuckwoolery @JimAcosta Jim Acosta is a whiny baba
@EdMorrissey That is an excellent point
@marcorubio @SebGorka @SenatorCollins I am sure you are right which makes what she did today so impressive
@BillOReilly She has never acted like a Republican. We need Sarah Palin to run against her and take the seat
@annieclark25 You should be she was great today
@CNN You see that is code for agreeing with her
@ChatByCC @kathygriffin KATHY Griffin is a real piece of angry hateful garbage. She is more sad than anything
@TeaPartyOrg @SarahPalinUSA @lisamurkowski please please please Sarah run and take her seat we need a real Republican not one of these Democrats wrapped up like a Republican
@SheriffClarke @ChatByCC @CNN @FLOTUS 100% agree with you @SheriffClarke cnn and msnbc will never recover from their lack of professional they have demonstrated since November of 2016
@FoxNews @GillianHTurner They have every right to protest no matter how wrong and stupid they are
@dgoold I think part of the problem with the Cardinal defense in the first half of the year was very few Cardinals had a fixed position. That can be good having flexibility but maybe using that ability be the exception not the daily rule
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorCollins Very proud of Senators Graham and Collins. Senator Collins your speech today was motivating
@newtgingrich Totally agree Newt
@bennyjohnson I can appreciate people having strong beliefs but you have to support the basis of our legal system “You are innocent until proven Guilty”.
@FoxNews @lisamurkowski This is another example how Lisa Murkowski is a poor representative of the people of Alaska and the American People
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity So proud of you Senator Graham
@edhenry @FoxNews He should move on and be a good Supreme Court Justice and get his life back
@SenSanders You are right it has been a disgrace in these hearings for the Supreme Court nominee. However it was the Democratic Senators who showe their true colors of evil and the length of lies and fabrications just to keep  power. You and your fellow Democratic Senators are garbage

@miklasz I very reluctantly agree with you. Love Wano but he has not pitched like Wano in awhile now
@PressSec stay strong you have millions of people rooting for you
@dgoold I do not really think so they only have to get thru August and the rosters will expand. Plus I think some of these guys will not just come in for 1 inning but multiple innings reducing the strain on the bullpen overall
@wyomingpd Great job Wyoming PD you were all over the neighborhood
@dgoold The only reason Dexter is on the Cardinals big league roster is he is being paid so much money. It is really hard to hit 170 for as many at bats as he has had even most of the pitchers are hitting with a higher average. Dexter has lost his job Bader should play everyday
@JoeTrezz I think it is not fair to say Dexter is not trying but very fair to say if he was not being paid  something like 16 million he would be in the minors or released
@SenKamalaHarris Wow you are one to talk about values. You are nothing but a bully loud mouth that is so out of touch of American values is amazing. Hard to believe people voted you into office; let’s pray your virus stays put in California
