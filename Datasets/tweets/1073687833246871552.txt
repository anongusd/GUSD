@Chadwick_Moore Churches need to stay out of politics
@JRubinBlogger Why are you defending Hillary? I thought Barr was your kind of republican, Bush crony neocon

@BillKristol Mattis should never be president
@libtards_owned @danibostick @kylegriffin1 LOL it‚Äôs called budgeting, I understand that‚Äôs a foreign term to some people but even if you don‚Äôt make much you can still save and budget for things
@ananavarro Cuz the media keeps asking for some reason
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Lol good one
@Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump Triggered much?
@libtards_owned @danibostick @kylegriffin1 Stop looking for a handout
@libtards_owned @danibostick @kylegriffin1 But your own birth control if you want it
@BillKristol The man literally ditched his wife of 25 years and the mother of his 4 kids for another woman
@BillKristol What?
@nathansoz @matthewjdowd @MizzyII Oh good. Then you should know not to call all evangicals jackasses
@nathansoz @matthewjdowd @MizzyII Ok first correcting my grammar isn‚Äôt owning anybody. Secondly cuz a tolerant liberal like yourself should be more tolerant of evangical Christians. Not slamming them as a group.
@nathansoz @matthewjdowd @MizzyII I‚Äôm not claiming your ignorant. I‚Äôm saying your hypocritical
@nathansoz @matthewjdowd @MizzyII Maybe a tolerant lib like you can start acting like you preach
@nathansoz @matthewjdowd @MizzyII Yes, let‚Äôs stereotype a whole population and then complain about their existence. That hasn‚Äôt caused any trouble before.
@JRubinBlogger Maybe, the thing to piont out is maybe
@danibostick @kylegriffin1 But they can‚Äôt be forced to pay for it
@kylegriffin1 It‚Äôs only temporary
@ryanv__ @AOC She kinda does by being a public figure
@NYMag @frankrichny Why wouldn‚Äôt they show the president?
@KamalaHarris No
@kathygriffin Keeping it classy I see?
@matthewjdowd @GMA I feel bad for Texas
@matthewjdowd @MizzyII Don‚Äôt attack other people for their religious beliefs, it makes you look like a jackass
@matthewjdowd I will when liberals stop being hypocrites and forcing their morality down my throat
@nowthisnews @SenatorTester Then fund the wall
@AOC I don‚Äôt like your politics
@GypsySpirit46 @matthewjdowd @anneapplebaum @Ez4u2say_Janis You should be more careful before disparaging people who disagree with you
@KevinMac4real @matthewjdowd @anneapplebaum @Ez4u2say_Janis Oh Yes, cuz killing people who disagree with you have progressed humanity so far.
@matthewjdowd @anneapplebaum @Ez4u2say_Janis That‚Äôs a silly opinion
@anneapplebaum CNN poll is eh
@NateSilver538 Awww Nate silver still holds a grudge from being embarrassed in 2016 so he attacks trumps ability to get his wall built.
@RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiff Your not very trustworthy
@KarlRove I don‚Äôt know if they can, as long as he wins their is not much that can be done
@RBReich Weren‚Äôt you labor secretary? It wouldn‚Äôt be your business to know what the president does with his notes with foreign leaders
@kylegriffin1 It‚Äôs a fuzzy legal issue. It‚Äôs careless to say if it is or not a federal crime
@Yagtabkdingme8 @AshaRangappa_ Thanks for the unnecessary grammar lesson and yes she is, this is only speculation.
@AOC Are Serbians white?
@AOC They didn‚Äôt allow him, he ran and won. Try to change the minds of voters in his district
@AOC Aren‚Äôt you from Westchester County?
@saikatc @shaunking No wonder the founding fathers didn‚Äôt trust the American majority
@BillKristol Cuz he doesn‚Äôt make a living rambling on twitter like you
@JRubinBlogger I‚Äôm sorry but you need to stop making things up
@AshaRangappa_ Your making assertions without information
@AshaRangappa_ Partisanship leads to anger
@ProfSchooner @MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump Your not very good at being a reporter
@JRubinBlogger You don‚Äôt know what your talking about
@SenatorDurbin I want you out of office
@neeratanden Sad day for America
@kylegriffin1 No one likes this guy
@neeratanden They should, it‚Äôs quite bogus
@JRubinBlogger Ummm maybe he just believes that. Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs being blackmailed
@ananavarro @SenatorTimScott @SenJoniErnst Your an example for no one
@Newsweek Unless you have undeniable proof he has that information, please, don‚Äôt post an article tricking people that he does
@sahilkapur Surprise Suprise. Democrats are more partisan than republicans.
@williamlegate How do you come up with this stuff?
@thehill @HillTVLive I thought California paid for itself?
@thehill Who is this guy?
@neeratanden I‚Äôm not surprised you jump all over any pool that supports your claim
@ABC *polls
@ABC I take your pills with a grain of salt
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Ummm the fact that he signed sanctions against them?
@NumbersMuncher Most people didn‚Äôt vote for trump because Mexico will pay for a wall
@NumbersMuncher @daveweigel Your info is challenged by CBS findings. Only 3% of Americans blame congressional republicans
@NateSilver538 Don‚Äôt justify Betos silliness
@ananavarro @chrisgeidner Don‚Äôt attack people for their religious beliefs, you have very little class
@maggieNYT @MichaelCohen212 Now Micheal Cohen is a ‚Äúpoor victim‚Äù?
@ananavarro Why are you defending Micheal Cohen
@JRubinBlogger Most Americans outside of Washington metro don‚Äôt actually care about the shutdown
@bessbell @Amy_Siskind It‚Äôs amazing comey is now suddenly a liberal hero even though he‚Äôs a major reason Trump is president
@NateSilver538 Maybe their just not an honest news source
@TomSteyer You make liberals look bad
@Amy_Siskind @STEWest You can‚Äôt just void senate appointments. The house can try to impeach them but the senate would have to convict
@Amy_Siskind It seems you are now a conspiracy theorist
@NateSilver538 You just don‚Äôt want it
@JRubinBlogger @MuhammadLila Pls move!
@MuhammadLila That‚Äôs a silly response to be honest
@BillKristol And you call yourself republican!
@ananavarro Your not very respectful on air
@JRubinBlogger @CNN @CillizzaCNN The Washington post needs a new columnist too
@JRubinBlogger @EliStokols Classy answer
@JRubinBlogger Don‚Äôt conservatives want the government to be shutdown?
@JRubinBlogger So have you changed party officially now?
@Amy_Siskind Do you do anything besides tweet?
@ananavarro Coral gables sucks
@ananavarro @RonDeSantisFL You just like him cuz his name sounds Hispanic
@CuomoPrimeTime @ananavarro And Anna Navarro isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúentitled, rich, spoiled brat‚Äù?
@ananavarro I‚Äôm sorry, but I lost respect for you after that nail stunt on tv
@nowthisnews They will get their checks once the shutdown ends
@melakatweets @neeratanden @TomSteyer Just pointing out the fact every billionaire wants to repeat trump
@melakatweets @neeratanden @TomSteyer 2020 isn‚Äôt the only presidential election
@neeratanden @TomSteyer He‚Äôs a ladder climber. Just wants to be president
@BillKristol I will cite AOC, ‚Äúdont be mad cuz you ain‚Äôt me‚Äù
@votolatino @AOC Is this a democratic organization?
@AOC The klan was also democrat, but you forget that part
@AshaRangappa_ Cuz polling data is vital national security information
@Amy_Siskind He‚Äôs just yanking your chain
@NYGovCuomo People are fleeing New York under your governorship
@ananavarro Pathetic.
@BillKristol Do you just talk fantasies into your head?
@HeerJeet and defeating communism
@neeratanden Have you run out of things to talk about?
@BetoORourke You sound like a snot nosed brat
@RealSaavedra You don‚Äôt define my American identity
@Amy_Siskind Lol Jennifer Rubin likes this post, that says something about it
@JRubinBlogger Your a democrat
@washingtonpost Is this how ny is gonna reverse their population growth slowdown?
@AOC Why do I still follow you?
@PoliticalKathy @AOC Her policy positions are not very good for the country
@NateSilver538 At least he has made the American public realize Washington is full of liars and we will never have a ‚Äúknight on the shining hill‚Äù to change it
@JRubinBlogger @MittRomney Too late, Congress has given the executive branch enormous powers since ww2
@BillKristol How about you hear the speech first and then began rambling?
@Q8462852 @drballologist @rahaf84427714 @realDonaldTrump Didnt Russia assasinate people in the uk?
@NathanLerner He‚Äôs not qualified
@funder You want them to be conservative?
@ktumulty Maybe it says more that the public doesn‚Äôt trust the news media?
@ananavarro Not as cuckoo as you

@Amy_Siskind @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews I‚Äôm watching. He is the president
@kurteichenwald Trump might have mistaken fence for wall
@SenWarren @ChrisVanHollen Are you gonna resign from the senate to run for president?
@shaunking @SenSchumer Senator Schumer is Jewish and represents a large Jewish population (NY). He is just responding to his constituents
@Amy_Siskind Deregulation
@politico Your ex wife is sleeping with Trumps son
@kylegriffin1 She did dress in a very expressive manner, not typical of the senate women. However, she is a conservative dem so I am a fan
@neeratanden What?
@EdKrassen He would tell them to learn how to fish, not have it provided for them
@ananavarro Wrong
RT @TimRunsHisMouth: Is it time for Ruth Bader Ginsburg retire? #RBG		After you vote, please retweet.
@BillKristol Your a liberal disguised as a Republican
@NateSilver538 God your a lib
@ananavarro It took me 20 minutes
@PreetBharara No referendums
@RealSaavedra Stop giving her media attention
@KayaJones That actor is as crazy as the rest of them

@Karandikar18 Seeing obama win, sad day
@BillKristol No, just no
@PaulNapaValley @neeratanden @GavinNewsom Oh and ya still got issues too https://t.co/JIN7NeMGVF
@PaulNapaValley @neeratanden @GavinNewsom Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not accurate.
@PaulNapaValley @neeratanden @GavinNewsom Ummm Reuters might disagree  https://t.co/PZVKFYKoWC
@PaulNapaValley @neeratanden @GavinNewsom Isn‚Äôt Oakland in California
@BeschlossDC @liamstack He looks short
@DanCrenshawTX And democratic supporters are better off? Have you seen Detroit?
@BillKristol Both statements are true
@neeratanden Do you just repeat the democratic narrative?
@PaulNapaValley @neeratanden @GavinNewsom Yea we elected a democrat, prbly going to get messed up again like under granholm
@costareports Meaning it won‚Äôt happen
@neeratanden He needs to calm down. Disagreements can be aired without nastiness
@DanielStrauss4 @CillizzaCNN Don‚Äôt do it
@business Happening in America too
@Sifill_LDF Has any been recovered?
@politico How about not being satisified until all of congress is full of decent people?
@shaunking It hurts me that you racialized an incident  before the facts came out
@neeratanden Isn‚Äôt that disrespectful to women?
@neeratanden @GavinNewsom That state is in trouble. Brown was basically a technocrat so he was able to balance the budget and keep the state economy on a steady course. But Newsom is ignoring state‚Äôs most glaring issues.
@politico Ik many voters in Alabama. If you want to re-elected in 2020, I advice you vote yes on the wall
@SteveHofstetter @SteveScalise It‚Äôs tax rate up to 70% on 10 million. So that means rates will increase for everyone
@SteveScalise Plz stop her rep.Scalise
@kylegriffin1 Nobody wants to hear from Hoyer. The American people want Trump, Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell to lock themselves in a room until they can strike a deal
@washingtonpost That‚Äôs skewed, the building was not very big
@DavidNir Hope the bill fails, just a dem power grab
@kylegriffin1 So the state dept knows more than homelands?
@AshaRangappa_ Eminent domain isn‚Äôt socialist since the gov is forced to pay market rate for the land. A socialist gov would take others peoples wealth, through taxation, and claim it‚Äôs for the common good.
@JRubinBlogger I can‚Äôt wait to see you blow up when trump wins re-election
@RickSmithShow @AOC People didn‚Äôt pay the 92% and we didn‚Äôt have the international tax havens in the 1950s like we do now
@ananavarro @AOC Why are you defending this liberal fraud?
@JRubinBlogger @Carrasquillo How are you a conservative?! It‚Äôs honestly false advertising to even state it on your twitter bio.
@PreetBharara How can a wall be phony?
@MollyJongFast Annoying man
@JRubinBlogger @CNNPolitics It‚Äôs a start
@MH52740441 @HuffPost They are in decline. The country still hasn‚Äôt recovered from the 90s bubble and it‚Äôs gov debt from overspending on social programs has caused tax increases which stalls economic growth.
@MH52740441 @HuffPost Yea, those societies that become dependent on government spending tend to start declining
@K_JeanPierre Bush spokesperson denied bush 43 discussed it with trump but didn‚Äôt comment on whether he supported the idea
@MH52740441 @HuffPost Better than spending it on wars and social programs
@NateSilver538 Are you just covering for tlaib?
@BillKristol Why? You live in La La land. That‚Äôs prbly your magazine failed
@MarkHertling Are you attacking to prepare for a prez run?
@BillKristol At least sen Perdue will get remembered. You will not even not be a footnote in history
@JRubinBlogger @BillKristol Your the one to comment on another persons intelligence
@BillKristol The only people turning voters away from the Republican Party is RINOs like you
@RealSaavedra Is he qualified?
@NicolleDWallace Your a republican?
@PreetBharara You seem bitter for being fired
@HuffPost Go back to Canada
@stengel I don‚Äôt want to be France. Macron is being held hostage by a radical mob because he is totally dependent on a tyrannical majority
@brianschatz You must have lots of guts to call other people out of touch while being in congress
@georgelittledc @SecNielsen And she‚Äôs the secretary of homelands security. Who do you think is more informed?
@HuffPost Yea, cuz rich kid cooper can totally relate
@GlennKesslerWP Bush passed a fence
@washingtonpost Your opinion pieces are just hit jobs for the Dems
@Grace_Haley__ @OpenSecretsDC Good
@JRubinBlogger Nah, the time for apologies is over. Congress and Trump need to get over it and get to work.
@ananavarro @AOC Stop defending the far left
@Amy_Siskind Why?
@BillKristol You two are being petty
@creynoldsnc Not a lot of them compared to how many are in congress
@kylegriffin1 Shouting doesn‚Äôt get people anywhere
@davidhogg111 I‚Äôm not sure whether to keep following you. I‚Äôm finding you increasingly irrelevant to national conversations
@AshaRangappa_ So because pence is a proud Christian that means he hates other religions?
@TheDemCoalition I thought when they hit low you go high?
@JoyAnnReid @SpeakerPelosi Do you even try to be a independent journalist?
@sfpelosi Your mom needs to resign
@Lawrence What?
@doikayt @DavidNir @neeratanden Cuz I want too?
@stavridisj Stop trying to make money off the military
@MarkHertling @abbydphillip Your political commentary politicizes the pentagon and help position it into the crosshairs of politicians
@JRubinBlogger Just switch parties already
@ktumulty @AOC Stop trying to sell us acostio-Cortez. Her ‚Äúgreen deal‚Äù plan is an example of how she lives in La La land
@NateSilver538 Polls have done nothing to stop group think
@doikayt @DavidNir @neeratanden None, I‚Äôm just sharing my opinion that Nancy pelosi is wrong
@doikayt @DavidNir @neeratanden I should be asking you the same question, you commented on my comment
@SpeakerPelosi Just stop trying, most Americans don‚Äôt like you and will remember the Dems who promised not to vote for you.
@doikayt @DavidNir @neeratanden Ummm he‚Äôs the president, so I guess your a hat?
@samstein So someone‚Äôs race or ethnicity makes them qualified to sit in that room?
@BillKristol That makes no sense
@DavidNir @neeratanden That‚Äôs actually not true, she‚Äôs one half of a whole institution that‚Äôs equal to the presidency. However Trump is the presidency
@BillKristol You don‚Äôt know anything. Honestly your just a blood thirsty Israel obsessed neocon
@JRubinBlogger @BillKristol The wapo internal inspector was right, you should be fired
@BillKristol Your a RINO
@BillKristol In your dreams
@BillKristol @parscale If you interpret that way. But Mormons are just fine
@richstanislaw @NateSilver538 @realDonaldTrump No, it doesn‚Äôt
@neeratanden Your right, none of them do equal trump
@kathygriffin @TiffanyHaddish Your not funny, ever
@neeratanden @NancyPelosi I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure, federal workers will pressure the Dems to the table
@tammybaldwin @benwikler He did win 3 or 4 terms and barely last election
@MarkHertling @MalcolmNance Stanley mchrystal shouldn‚Äôt have made those comments if he didn‚Äôt want to be criticized back. Stop protecting your boys club.
@NormOrnstein @neeratanden Saddam Hussein would still be in power gassing Kurds and invading countries
@neeratanden Thank god for no al gore
@BillKristol Good job going low

@The_UnSilent_ You forget that old Dems would be reps now
@kylegriffin1 He could have stepped in for a minute?
@davidhogg111 @MattxRed @IngrahamAngle She still got 45 million, you got what? 200k in student loan debt from Harvard
@Amy_Siskind The economy is still good
@ChrisMurphyCT Why are you still in the senate?
@BillKristol How do you know they are not calling?
@ananavarro You want generals running the country?
@neeratanden I doubt it
@Amy_Siskind @instagram @facebook Nobody should say that to you, no matter the political disagreement
@BillKristol You are out of touch
@BillKristol It‚Äôs more interesting why John Roberts is so involved
@BillKristol California says they pay for themselves and do not need the rest of America. So they can pay for their own wildfires
@BillKristol What?
@Amy_Siskind Then voluntary pay more tax to help the fed gov afford it
@joncoopertweets Yea, their mad they didn‚Äôt win re-election
@NateSilver538 Don‚Äôt underestimate trump
@kylegriffin1 The Washington post is too bias to trust
@aravosis I think it‚Äôs more political then just ‚Äúblaming the girl‚Äù
@Amy_Siskind English plz
@RBReich It‚Äôs 2007 all over again
@kylegriffin1 She‚Äôs dreaming
@Amy_Siskind Sounds like fear-mongering
@cyniczenmaster @ananavarro People shouldn‚Äôt use hyphenations

@Martin_Indyk Israel is a rich country, we should cut their aid
@MeetThePress @MikeBloomberg @chucktodd People will reject his elitism
@JRubinBlogger Why do you have to attack people so nastily? Do you have no decency?
@TopRopeTravis I‚Äôm gonna be honest: this won‚Äôt happen
@krassenstein @JRubinBlogger And Rasmussen has it at 47%....so who the knows?
@JRubinBlogger So your willing to damage the country just to get at Trump. Journalists like you are the reason people don‚Äôt like the media
@JRubinBlogger It bothers me that reporters like you have so little shame in spinning the facts
@Eugene_Scott @JRubinBlogger @MilitaryTimes So two photos are representative of everyone?
@SRuhle How are you qualified to report the news?

@Parisbob2001 @BillKristol @Charlie_Hebdo_ @weeklystandard Is that how you soften your failure to investors?

@kakapolitico @Slb1101 @MoveOn Thanks for the info. Smartmouth
@adaitsman @HeerJeet And don‚Äôt justify it by saying it‚Äôs words in your ‚Äúmothers tongue‚Äù, there are many discriminatory words in my ‚Äúmothers tongue‚Äù that I would never call someone.
@adaitsman @HeerJeet Your allowed to use what you want. Just don‚Äôt be surprised if you use them and people are offended
@adaitsman @HeerJeet Many Jews are prejudice against non-Jews especially in south Florida
@adaitsman @HeerJeet Get out of your bubble and learn how non-Jewish people feel about it
@adaitsman @HeerJeet It‚Äôs used in derogatory fashion, especially people who are born non-Jewish and marry someone who is.
@PattyMurray Then do something about it

@RealSaavedra What? First you want him to visit, now it‚Äôs inappropriate?
@washingtonpost @kylegriffin1 The markets have calmed after they realized the Fed interest rate hike isn‚Äôt the end of the world

@barbarastarrcnn He has no wife or kids so it‚Äôs easier to stay in the office

@Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump Actually that‚Äôs not true. The Fed can cause a recession by raising interest rates too much. That‚Äôs why they are cautious about rate hikes.
@XtheXlanternX @SeanMcElwee Well actually 10% of households own 84% of stock
@SeanMcElwee LOL your not wrong
@NateSilver538 And remember Mr. Silver that we are now two years into Trump and stock market has now just become volatile, most likely due to uncertainty with the Fed. You could argue that Trump was wrong to fire Janet Yellen?
@NateSilver538 The stock market is not always affected by politics but also economic trends
@washingtonpost A first for Lebron
@aseitzwald @TopherSpiro Why the poem?
@thehill He‚Äôs just mad trump called him, and the woman he left his family for, ladder climbers.
@JimmyVielkind @Underrated_Dom We forget about these people, not direct federal employees but rely Fed spending for work
@BradMossEsq You need to hang around new people
@neruda1968 @cakes_iam @MomsDemand @Everytown @shannonrwatts Your comment was an attack on me, not any of the views expressed
@neruda1968 @cakes_iam @MomsDemand @Everytown @shannonrwatts *bot
@neruda1968 @cakes_iam @MomsDemand @Everytown @shannonrwatts Only a boy would accuse someone else of being one
@TheDailyShow I can‚Äôt believe people get their news from you
@BillKristol I don‚Äôt think it matters at this point. Maybe you should stop worshipping Mattis now?
@shaunking Don‚Äôt embarrass yourself
@robreiner I didn‚Äôt realize being in Hollywood made you so insightful
@ananavarro So why comment then?
@ClistonBrown @HeerJeet @joero3 @tomwatson Yes they are, California gets more electoral votes and house seats. Iowa gets more vote power per electoral vote in a attempt to give it voice against California‚Äôs massive electoral vote count.
@BillKristol Grow a spine Kristol
@costareports It was prbly some republican intern who said that
@BillKristol Where do you get this shit?
@kylegriffin1 He also wrote an anti-Semitic snap
@JesseKellyDC @RealSaavedra That is not America‚Äôs future
@cakes_iam @MomsDemand @Everytown @shannonrwatts Gun control is for autocrats
@kathygriffin Why don‚Äôt you just save us the mental gymnastics and stop tweeting about politics?
@BillKristol Former colleague soon. I‚Äôve never seen someone so angry because they were outed as a RINO by Trump
@biffflorence @Amy_Siskind You do realize they only post certain articles and not all right? You should visit the sights to get all the information FYI
@sahilkapur @business Your right
@Amy_Siskind You get your news from twitter? Sad.
@NateSilver538 Yet reps won seats in the senate, even in Florida
@NateSilver538 Yet he won the election
@NateSilver538 You have as much political insight as Hillary Clinton on November 7 2016
@NateSilver538 Stop using racist terminology
@CapehartJ Thank god he‚Äôs out of congress
@business @bopinion LOL this article was written by Micheal Bloomberg. I‚Äôm sure he will say anything to get trumps job
@thehill Yes cuz a democratic senator has objective views on Trump
@robreiner @MalcolmNance Yet, you have been a success?
@Comey Then donate your paycheck to them or shutup
@tribelaw A liberal like you now has compassion for a war hawk like Mattis?
@FrankAmari2 @ktumulty How would he know anything related to mueller?
@tribelaw You just keep coming up with random accusations
@BillKristol @realDonaldTrump Why are dick-riding Jim Mattis
@BillKristol Ik they want to fight, but there are other considerations. Of course you billy don‚Äôt mind spilling blood for your ideology
@PhilipRucker And you know what‚Äôs right?
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Yea but what about their voice in presidential elections?
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson It‚Äôs the second
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Your right my mistake
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson So it gets more electoral votes overall. But Iowa gets more voter power per electoral vote so it is fairly represented
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Exactly
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson But it‚Äôs not getting more. California has 55 electoral votes and 53 house seats
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Well I guess you can think what you want
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson *populous mcfly
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson There is difference between our society and political system. Sure women and racial minorities can vote now but our system functions the same. It does work how it should, giving voice to parts of the country that would be crowded by others. Do Iowa voters deserve less than Cali?
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Secondly, notice how Dems won the house on the back of a solid majority? Political minorities don‚Äôt have unlimited power but are given a voice in the process. You forget that Texas and Florida (1 and 3 most populist states) voted republican in 2016
@joero3 @HeerJeet @tomwatson Ok your first response is rooted in opinion and is actually not necessarily true, while we directly elect senators our political system has weathered history quite nicely.
@TheDemCoalition @joncoopertweets @davidhogg111 With your SAT score, I wish you luck in your classes
@neeratanden Good, then you and the other liberals should start paying for her taxpayer funded private jet this time
@HuffPost Expect tolerance but gives none
@HeerJeet @joero3 @tomwatson People who want to get rid of the electoral college don‚Äôt understand the American political system. Our system was created to be representative of political minorities, not to be a pure democratic system. For this to happen, voters in Iowa must have equal say as voters elsewhere
@tomwatson @HeerJeet @joero3 Packing the court is autocratic
@tribelaw You should act like a professional. Especially if you criticize trump for the same rhetoric
@mitchellreports And you know this how? What credentials do have? Oh wait, liberals like you support candidates based on their genitals and not policy
@GovHowardDean At least we avoided you as president
@BuzzFeedNews I like how you point out he is a decorated Iraq veteran and then commence with your attack on his character
@WajahatAli Nothing cuz there not Christian and should stick to their own religion. Thank you
@MollyJongFast They got divorced. Like half of Americans
@business Handmaid gift, it‚Äôs unique and priceless
@ktumulty That doesn‚Äôt answer the question
@ktumulty How is he supposed to know every official in our huge federal govt. You can try to make another intelligent comment again.
@costareports Hmmm a guy who wants trumps job criticizes him?! That‚Äôs definitely breaking news
@HuffPost Nothing new. America still has defacto segregation everywhere
@neeratanden Do you believe everything you read?
@BillKristol That was to wreak the Soviet Union and it physically divided a country. Trumps wall keeps undocumented immigrants from crossing the dangerous borders. Don‚Äôt worry bill, we have work visas so you can get your cheap labor.
@kanyewest @JackPosobiec What city?
@Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews Get over the 2016 election
@Lukewearechange I thought macron was the ‚Äúliberal savior‚Äù?
@RepJoeKennedy With how much our nation taxes the people. You should be able to afford both.
@ananavarro And democrats are blameless? God. I‚Äôm so glad Trump outed the fake republicans like you.
@business Unfortunate, but companies should learn to pay employees based on talent and seniority. Not their genitals
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Budget better
@BillKristol His fight paid off. The Jewish now have a nation in their ancient homeland
@TomSteyer @neeratanden Your retweeting Tom steyer? New low
@neeratanden You do understand how American politics works right? Congress and the President are supposed to reach a deal together and due to our political system, sometimes they it doesn‚Äôt happen. Of course liberals like yourself will blame congress when it happens under a democratic prez
@HuffPost Cuz don lemon is so knowledgeable about foreign policy matters?
@JRubinBlogger The only cult is your obsession with attacking Trump constantly
@renato_mariotti @JRubinBlogger I thinks it‚Äôs innapropriate to say one is lesser than another. Both should be considered individually
@JRubinBlogger @Martin_Indyk @jmclaughlinSAIS @TimesofIsrael When did liberals start caring about Israel? I thought they were the evil occupiers?
@davidhogg111 It seems your little activism paid off?
@BillKristol Where do you come up with this stuff?
@ananavarro Do you know this is a real person? Or is it more of your pettiness?
@IrishCentral @TomCottonAR Ireland should not get special visas when people in poorer underrepresented countries deserve the same opportunity
@IrishCentral @TomCottonAR All countries need to be treated fairly in terms of immigration
@Amy_Siskind How can she do that? Did she even hear any of the oral arguments? Or was it her typical partisan vote when we are supposed to believe the judicial system is politically independent?
@brianschatz Why are you not willing to give trump 5 billion for the wall when it‚Äôs a drop in the bucket compared to the total budget?
@JRubinBlogger @brianschatz I can‚Äôt believe the Washington post pays you to sit all day and pretend to be a republican
@votolatino Racist organization
@eugenegu Nonpartisan court? That‚Äôs a joke right?
@MiaFarrow Don‚Äôt you have something better to do? Like figure who your baby daddy is?
@MeghanMcCain Your very winery. Is it cuz daddy and mommy aren‚Äôt getting you a job and paying your bills anymore?
@ABC7Chicago Good story for the holidays
@joshrogin @mikiebarb @AP Unfortunately we have to deal with erdogan
@JeffFlake Go away already
@GaryGrumbach @PeteWilliamsNBC Did she even hear the oral argument?
@chrislhayes And you know that, how?
@NateSilver538 Why don‚Äôt you just come out as the whiney liberal you are? Your election predictions just claim Dems will win all the time when it‚Äôs false
@EricHolder Do you have no shame? A former attorney general of your record should be quit
@Amy_Siskind @BillOReilly Classy
@JRubinBlogger Too bad Trump is gonna replace Ginsburg
@JRubinBlogger @Lawrence How do you call yourself conservative? I‚Äôm glad Trump forced you out
@kylegriffin1 Are you just a dem troll disguised as a person?
@SenFeinstein How about you tweet about how your gonna avoid a govt shutdown or help wildfire victims ?
@SykesCharlie @BillKristol Nobody wants to hear from boring old men
@BuckSexton People in New York oppose the wall cuz they don‚Äôt have to deal with the border like Texas does
@kylegriffin1 Clean house
@chrislhayes Isn‚Äôt that what you do everyday?
@ezralevin @deray Sexist
@TeamPelosi @MalcolmNance Why are you still in office?
@RepJoeKennedy @davidhogg111 Maybe you should donate all that kennedy trust fund money to an organization that helps families get out of violent areas? Just a thought
@cd_hooks @jmartNYT She‚Äôs 85....
@ezraklein I think libs like you should have to pay 80% income tax cuz you seem to love wanting to pay for wars, food stamps and undocumented immigrants
@shaunking How do you even know this? You just say things
@BillKristol Ideologues like you think you owned the party. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt want you back
@BillKristol Maybe this is why your magazine went bankrupt?
@BillKristol They won seats in the senate
@ananavarro Republicans like you are the reason we lost in 2012
@sfpelosi Have you gotten that job yet or is mommy still funding you?
@JRubinBlogger The only thing he attacked was the pondscum choking this country. The same people grunts like you worship
@sfpelosi @funder @SenateDems Stop living off your mother and get a job
@hierroyluz @realDonaldTrump Actually if you include the small words ‚Äúif‚Äù in the beginning, it changes the meaning. Remember liberals, context is important
@ellievan65 What a sexist
@ananavarro He married girl who‚Äôs daddy got him elected only to spend thirty plus screaming that America should invade every nonwhite country
@CuomoPrimeTime Louis Gutierrez has only cared about people that quote ‚Äúlook like him‚Äù
@zenhighwayman @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo What? It‚Äôs Twitter.... I didn‚Äôt realize this was an English essay
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo And you have credibility cuz of what? The fact your on tv?
@ezraklein @PreetBharara Ummmm, you guys are reading way to deep into his letter. He admits he has policy disagreements but doesn‚Äôt say anything close to that.
@PreetBharara It got stronger with your being fired
@SenDuckworth @shaunking What does that solve? All politicians like you do is make spectacles out of congressional hearings and then do nothing
@AndrewGillum @realDonaldTrump Like you were unfit to be governor of Florida
@brianklaas Blame the fed
@TheDemCoalition Who is that image supposed to make fun of?
@NathanLerner LOL you want loser Beto to run for prez? He couldn‚Äôt even beat idiot Cruz with 70 million dollars
@chrislhayes Why would people read your book?
@JohnKasich @NicolleDWallace If Jennifer Rubin and Nicolle Wallace support then your desperately in trouble
@SenFeinstein You shouldn‚Äôt be in the senate. You won re-election because your cronies in Sacramento chanted the electoral system so that republicans can‚Äôt even compete in the general election
@marcorubio So who‚Äôs your pick for a replacement?
@NewYorker When did opinions become news?
@SethAbramson And I‚Äôm supposed to trust you?
@JRubinBlogger Stop fear-mongering
@JRubinBlogger Why do you believe that Mattis was some caretaker of the country? What proof do have if this? Or are you just gonna make wild assertions like usual?
@macintyremobile @nytimes Hate to break it to you. But it‚Äôs typically the rest of world that comes crying to us. Like when the UK begged us to save them from the Germans
@nytimes You picked that line? When so many others were so good? Politics at its worst
@Todd_Gillett Racist
@ananavarro Well at least your not anywhere close to the decision making process
@BillKristol Your rabid never trump stance has only encouraged more polarization in Washington
@ananavarro You do realize the market fall is from the fed raising interest rates and that impeaching the sitting us president would only destabilize the market even more?
@LindseyGrahamSC Your a warmonger like your buddy McCain
@funder Are you just a dem troll?
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK By the same politicians they are giving millions in donations too?
@jaketapper @MalcolmNance This is something liberals should be applauding. Ending that war they have been complaining about since 2001.
@ananavarro People like you don‚Äôt really know anything. You mislead your audience by making politically biased theories and present them as facts
@ananavarro Yet you support hate against people with diffrent political beliefs.
@evanperez The judge shouldn‚Äôt admit to his personal bias cuz it gives credibility to Flynn‚Äôs lawyers that the process is tainted against him
@davidfrum Seeing how only 10% of American households own 84% of stocks, that‚Äôs highly unlikely
@USATODAY The only reason people read your newspaper is to see your arbitrary rankings of everything
@JRubinBlogger Are you only conservative if it means bombing a Muslim country?
@ananavarro @ananavarro why are people like you making creepy poems about Trump?
@Cooper19874 @nytimes What a nasty comment
