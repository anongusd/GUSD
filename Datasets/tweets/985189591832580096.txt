@kimk898 @JoPetell @SenGillibrand Opinions are harmful. We agree there hippie. We agree there.
@kmhlpn @GaryGoddmn @jasonambrosino @AOC They offered me nothing, loved my money, and shit on my contract(lot of people there Kaytie).		Unions are just like Government. Small and good or large and overpowered.		The car unions fell out and Michigan collapsed because of union greed. But tell me again bout member ignorance
@kmhlpn @GaryGoddmn @jasonambrosino @AOC Lot of assumptions here Kaytie. First, my contract was appendix j, the smallest.		My union sold out on appendix j and beefed up appendix a through g.		Your attempting to make me sound uninformed, when really you've no idea what I'm speaking on.		Appendix j did more work. Less pay
@Keofme @TheRealCherylM @AOC An no, I don't want to ask that straw man question you just built. . .		Where did you get all that from? Are you trying to think ahead of the conversation or what...
@Keofme @TheRealCherylM @AOC Okay, so you took a soap box to town square and waved your hands a lot. . . But never really answered the question. I mean I like the Matrix too but even Neo gets hit with a bullet. . .
@GaryGoddmn @ellle_em @xxMatthewJayxx @isteig14 @irishbluegold @Dangoss @AOC @wbmosler We agree on min wage. I'm intrigued by what you reference, I'd like to read more on it. 		However, you hire people in at more than current worker rates, you breed animosity between existing and new workers. 		Humans, the variable, once again has to have the correct value/mindset
@Keofme @TheRealCherylM @AOC Where do you work if you don't mind my asking.  Like,  what industry are you in?		I guess what I'm challenging here is your real world experience. Your yakking on about economists and data, but what have you seen for yourself.
@GaryGoddmn @jasonambrosino @kmhlpn @AOC Funny, the last union I was in did nothing for my wages, me job security, or my benefits, yet they still expected them dues.		Unions become just as greedy as a businessman once they've become so big. The car manufacturing industry fell out because of this greed.
@GaryGoddmn @linleypat @AOC "Fancy" burger.		I'm sure she is referring to a $1.00 McBurger.
@GaryGoddmn @ellle_em @xxMatthewJayxx @isteig14 @irishbluegold @Dangoss @AOC Right so let's hasten the decision to automate by forcing them to pay humans more short term.
@higgens_tom @SeanBird15 @AOC Why, because tech that companies buy to make jobs easier and less difficult means a worker deserves more money?		Lol right.
@Keofme @TheRealCherylM @AOC Labor production correlates with technology. 		People aren't working harder. Technology has simply gotten better.  Tech boost productivity.

@Tora_NYC @John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump How many illegal crossings is too many before an extension of the existing wall is taken as serious idea in your book, Tora? Serious question.
@Tora_NYC @John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump "All this money" as if when put in perspective the wall is the over bloated budget. 		The educated should also know that foot traffic cannot be dismissed because it is happening and it is a call to those who believe it easy to obtain access to our country.
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Further more john, I know for a fact I can cite and show where potus has stated more than one approach to this topic, coupled with a wall. Again, It isn't a single minded approach, it's a long term fix that will need a system to physically prevent and deter also.
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Only the staunchest of opposition cling to the notion that the pitch is "wall stop all bad stuff."		It's a wall, plus technology, plus reformed immigration system, plus improved detections methods.		It's like everyone got caught up arguing over what needs done first. Y not all?
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump A wall will cut down on the number of illegal crossings and the amount of drugs that are coming across. If you are literally quoting Trump then cite it. All of his speeches that I have seen its merely being pointed out that a multi pronged approach is necessary coupled with wall
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump No one method will be a end all fix all. But I cannot ignore that a wall will help as well as technology/detection advancements. It has to be multi pronged approach. A wall be the ground of you will. Not needed, but certainly helpful.
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Of course, but no one is saying a wall will solve all problems. It will absolutely help trim down on the amount coming in as well as help cut down illegal immigration. 		I again agree that there are multiple ways we must approach the number of ways illegal things make it in.
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Sure, I can agree with that.  		However it completely dismisses the idea of 20 feet 10 duffle bags and how many ever lbs of whatever crossing.		The notion that all smuggling is done by truck and therefore is traceable is flawed. Foot traffic should be considered as well.
@John_AKA_Becker @andreakrey @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Track how? If they come through a legal point of entry that contains surveillance? Then yes I agree, trackable.		However, if it is smuggled in through open crossing points where surveillance is currently light or non existent, how then are we accounting/tracking for this?
@andreakrey @John_AKA_Becker @Tora_NYC @barreca_lisa @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Sounds like all of you agree with the president on improving detection methods via technology advancements. 	Also, how can statistics, if any, reflect what ISN'T captured at the border? 	Of course it'll look like more comes through legal entry points, that's where they get caught
@andreakrey @realDonaldTrump Rightfully so.  Last I checked my fellow Christians weren't chopping off non believers heads. 		Can you say the same about the Quran teachings and Islam belief? 		I'm sure you could, but it would be factually inaccurate.

@Top4ce @KNT_of_Reason @alienlike57 @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow those who truly are evaluated and found to have merit for such a claim, will show, and admitted. 		We see far to many who don't show though.  . .
@Top4ce @KNT_of_Reason @alienlike57 @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow typically what's happening, we give you a court date and say, "come back after we have assessed your claims" and we let you go. 		You then never come back. 	Your in the country	An I can't track you. 	Great.
@Top4ce @KNT_of_Reason @alienlike57 @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow I love black an white, but this isn't that simple. 		You come to me, claiming your facing persecution for your religious affiliations, your heritage, etc. I'm not going to just accept you for your word.  I need to verify your claims. Then we can proceed. . .
@Top4ce @DeweyWoodz @alienlike57 @KNT_of_Reason @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow Yet we have folks coaching non asylum seekers in how to become asylum seekers.		Again, step right up an ill teach you what to say an your garunteed entry!!		^	That's a problem	I call that a loophole.
@Top4ce @KNT_of_Reason @alienlike57 @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow We also have a problem with one member of a foreign family obtaining entry "legally" an then assisting family members in gaining entry just to use the same credentials as the original family member. ---&gt;illegal.

@HarryTHop @alienlike57 @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow I support following the law. 		You break it, you face consequences. 		Right now, jaywalking is a fine		Right now, speeding is a fine, points on your license(sometimes) and an increase to your insurance rates. 		Right now, as you people say, crossing illegally, causes separation.
@alienlike57 @KNT_of_Reason @Top4ce @DeweyWoodz @hankgreen @realDonaldTrump @SciShow Lucky for them, it's only a misdemeanor. 		Again, do it the right way, no problem. 		Do it the wrong way		Face consequences.
