(And incredibly dumb.) https://t.co/Reddf5Sqkl
I have never in my history of working in 3 schools (K-12, high school, and college) seen a school yearbook published without any faculty supervision or approval. That sounds very odd to me. And if it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs insane &amp; completely irresponsible on the  part of the school. https://t.co/Reddf5Sqkl
2) Also‚ÄîI‚Äôve taught at a high school, college, and K-12 school. There was faculty supervision of every yearbook publication, including captions, image selection, story writing, etc. Absolutely insane and atrocious to me that this pic was published in a yearbook. https://t.co/yzlalYL8u5
1 of 2) Story is horrific on many levels.  Painful imagery.Also‚ÄîHe posed for this pic as 25-yr-old adult in 1984 &amp; chose it to be featured on his yearbook page?!And‚Äîwhat school would publish this?I was literary editor of my high school yearbook, every pic needed faculty approval. https://t.co/yzlalYL8u5

I don‚Äôt agree with Schultz on plenty. But I will take on anyone who disparages an American-dream story brought to life. You don‚Äôt like the American dream? Cool. Move somewhere where it‚Äôs not possible, enjoy yourself, and leave the rest of us here alone.
It‚Äôs rich that Left disparages Schultz, who grew up very poor in low-income NY housing, as out of touch..yet elevates AOC, who went to school &amp; lived mostly in Westchester County (&amp; misled the public about it, forcing her to edit her own bio), as some American dream personified.
Left‚Äôs attack on @HowardSchultz as an out-of-touch billionaire makes my blood boil. He grew up poor in Canarsie in low-income housing. This is the definition of the American dream. Left‚Äôs loathing of him is a window into their loathing of capitalism &amp; what this country stands for

My bottom-line:Parents, teach kids to walk away from hostile situations, to be respectful, &amp; to not engage when confused in chaotic situations. Media who immediately ran with the edited clip? You have no business having the job you do &amp; should be removed for those who seek truth.
8) I can‚Äôt hear every word in the video b/c of sound quality. Can I assure that no Covington boys said anything mean? No. Maybe they did &amp; their parents should handle that. What I can assure is that no respectable reporter would‚Äôve run that story without watching the whole video.
7) Covington boys made mistakes. They shouldn‚Äôt have engaged with the Black Hebrew Israelites who were harassing them. They shouldn‚Äôt have engaged in a stare-down with Phillips. Even if they were confused as to his role in it all and what was happening, they should‚Äôve walked away
6) That heavily edited and heavily circulated moment missed the entire preceding and following context, without which you can‚Äôt possibly attempt to understand the encounter between the boys and Phillips.
5) It appears to me that Covington boys originally thought Phillips was chanting with them, confusion ensued (they say as much repeatedly), and the stare-down occurs. But it‚Äôs key that the Phillips encounter occurred after Black Hebrew Israelites nearby had been harassing them.
4) If you watch the entire video, you‚Äôre likely fuming that the highly edited clip circulated by media is a screenshot. Omits Black Hebrew Israelites harassing Covington boys before &amp; after Nathan Phillips enters. Phillips enters &amp; confusion ensues.
3) I guess no one in media who spread the edited copy watched the Black Hebrew Israelites continuously harass the Covington boys &amp; mock them preceding (and following) the entrance of the Native American veteran? (Watch below at 1:11). https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
2) How many in media watched Black Hebrew Israelites call Covington Catholic school group ‚Äúyoung Klansmen‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúschool shooters‚Äù &amp; anti-gay slurs? Or when they said ‚Äúno peace till blood is shed‚Äù &amp; complained that the Bible gives rights to homosexuals? 1:20 - https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
1) How many in media watched the full video before reporting? Did you see Covington Catholic school students being harassed by the Black Hebrew Israelites, who uses repeated racist &amp; anti-gay slurs against white &amp; black kids in the group? Start at 1:20 - https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
I knew something was wrong with the original edited video that was cut &amp; spread by some in media to immediately try to humiliate &amp; belittle these high school boys. The real story below. And yes, I watched the whole video of the incident, over an hour. https://t.co/kSWIMe8Ul2

Hated it. Was a way for the writer to pick Joey/Dawson through Dawson‚Äôs TV show without actually putting them together in life. Hated Jen‚Äôs death and felt like it was a bad choice.

Keri Russell...but you were close :) https://t.co/FP2IfTBrLT
Also, I think I would‚Äôve picked Noel, though I loved the character of Ben by the end too. (I also would‚Äôve picked Dawson, though, so there‚Äôs that.) Okay, that‚Äôs a wrap on my 90s TV drama take...for the moment.üòâ
Watched the entire 90s series Felicity. Loved it, including the time-travel twist &amp; how it makes you think about whether you‚Äôd somehow make the same choices again if you could go back. Best character? Meghan. And unlike Dawson‚Äôs Creek, this ending feels right for the characters.

Suppose someone accused you of gang rape from 30 yrs ago.

Do you want to live in that world? I sure as hell don‚Äôt. https://t.co/XDCjnArPCq
Getting labeled a gang rapist and sexual assaulter, even though there‚Äôs been not one bit of corroboration of those claims, is slightly worse than getting your toys taken away. But you do you. https://t.co/aj5qCDqQ9h
False. 10 FBI interviews, including Judge, Keyser, Smith (3 alleged by Ford to have been at party), Ramirez, classmates Gaudette and Garrett. Ford &amp; Kavanaugh already cross-examined in sworn testimonies. No corroboration found. And nothing found in Kavanaugh‚Äôs prior 6 FBI checks. https://t.co/LVD6BL4CbK
Job interviews don‚Äôt involve criminalizing people based on uncorroborated, unsubstantiated claims.If one is accused of gang rape/assault w/ no evidence/corroboration, denies it &amp; is the object of a massive smear campaign anyway, he/she better damn well be angry.

100% true.	‚Äú...FBI‚Äôs job was to find people who could corroborate Ford‚Äôs sworn testimony and called the demand for her to be interviewed by the FBI an ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù one.		‚ÄúWhat would she do, change her testimony?‚Äù...‚ÄúShe could only hurt herself if she changed her testimony.‚Äù https://t.co/lSV8aJuZlb

I‚Äôd argue her initial questions to Kavanaugh were even more pointed. The burden of proof rests with the accuser. Has to.

Honest questions. Why would a high school graduate repeatedly attend underage parties where fellow women were allegedly gang-raped? And say nothing? Women were allegedly gang-raped regularly &amp; not 1 person said a word to anyone? Word didn‚Äôt travel through the school?

Once again, this is outrageous. Ford‚Äôs legal team does not get to set these terms. Nor does Kavanaugh. She can show up and speak her mind under the terms provided to both of them or she can stay home and decline the opportunity to provide testimony. The end. ENOUGH. https://t.co/F0Dxr873r7
To women saying they instantly believe any accusation by a woman without evidence/corroboration, I ask:If someone accused you of something without evidence/corroboration, would you want to be instantly labeled guilty? Would you want the public to criminalize you without evidence?

Point me to the evidence, corroboration &amp; testimony that led you to this conclusion. I don‚Äôt know what happened 30+ yrs ago &amp; neither do you. The words victim &amp; perpetrator imply guilt. Once again, I ask for the evidence/corroboration that confirm his guilt.This is still America. https://t.co/sZWDyZTrTL
Oh I‚Äôm sure they did! Regardless, I would ask @RonanFarrow why he chose to run a story in which he couldn‚Äôt even confirm that Kavanaugh had been at the party and couldn‚Äôt find any firsthand corroboration of her allegation. https://t.co/hd2W0ObxCK

Grassley has offered Ford a public or private hearing, one in CA, or a phone option.FBI has declined to investigate b/c this doesn‚Äôt involve a potential federal crime.

The fact that this administration‚Äôs policy on Russia is a big improvement from the Obama years doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Trump‚Äôs comments yesterday were embarrassing. It is possible to defend the administration‚Äôs policy while at the same time criticizing his personal comments.

There are those who will tell you what you want to hear, and then those who will tell you the truth. Appreciate the latter.
If you‚Äôre on the right and twisting and contorting to defend Trump‚Äôs comments today, revisit what you said about Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúapology tours‚Äù &amp; his hot mic ‚ÄúAfter my election, I‚Äôll have more flexibility‚Äù comment to Medvedev. Our country deserves our consistency.   I condemn it all.
...Trump playing the ‚ÄúOur intelligence officials said one thing, but Putin says another‚Äù card, as if he‚Äôs not sure who to trust, is very disturbing to watch. Also, it was not the time or place, with his adversary (not competitor!) beside him, to take up his issues with Democrats.
...My stomach began turning when Trump insisted that Putin is not an adversary, but a competitor, with the aside that he was complimenting Putin. Disgraceful. To hear an American President place a moral equivalence between leadership here and Putin‚Äôs leadership is nauseating...
I was recording my audiobook most of today in studio and only caught a couple of clips of the press conference. Wanted to refrain from full comment till I saw the whole thing. I can now say it turned my stomach at many points...

Given assurance to place a puppy in an overhead bin? That is preposterous. United should have never ever suggested that, but as a pet owner, you have a duty to be a thinking person. Should people put their infants up there too if a flight attendant says so? STOP IT. https://t.co/OdHuSBlN6r

That means I can oppose both Obamacare &amp; a bad GOP alternative bill that overregulates you.That's ideological consistency over Party loyalty
That means I don't fit into a "Republican" or "Democrat" box. I don't believe in big government, as so many Dems AND GOP selectively protect
