So long as unrest is met with bloodshed, cries for peace ring hollow and hopes for a better future in the region will remain nothing more than a dream.
I remain a strong supporter of Israel and the two state solution and urge both sides, the Palestinians and Israelis, to cease the senseless violence.
The disingenuousness of Prime Minister Netanyahu‚Äôs claim that the new U.S. Embassy is any part of a ‚Äúpursuit of peace‚Äù is exposed by the Israeli soldiers meeting expected protesters onsite with gunfire at close range.
We are witnessing the use of unabated brutality and force against civilians to stifle civil unrest. America must expect and demand more from its close allies.
I am deeply saddened by the horrific slaughter of at least 52 Palestinian protestors and injuries to thousands more by Israeli forces. No doubt this will spark claims that Israel has a right to defend itself ‚Äî and it does. But this has nothing to do with defense.

People with health problems, serious illnesses, cancer, etc. will no longer be able to deduct their high medical expenses under this plan.
Families who rely on the state &amp; local income and sales tax deductions will see them disappear. In KY, that‚Äôs an avg deduction of ~$9,500.
Students, often DROWNING in student loan debt from high interest rates &amp; the high costs of college, will see their tax deduction eliminated.
Teachers who pay for classroom supplies for their students OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS will lose their tax deduction under this GOP plan.
For starters, it explodes our debt &amp; deficits. This isn‚Äôt about fiscal responsibility. Never has been. It's about helping donors &amp; the rich.
The Ryan-McConnell tax plan cuts corporate rates by 43%. You might wonder how they could possibly pay for that big of a cut. Here's how:

This budget and the tax cuts that will follow fail the American people on all fronts.
The American people deserve a budget that invests in their future, a tax code that is fair, and a full and honest debate on both.
The GOP is rushing their tax plan to the floor because they don‚Äôt want you to know what's in it.
The fight now shifts to the GOP tax plan that will be brought to the House floor in just a matter of weeks.
Medicare.	Medicaid.	Social Security.	Nutrition assistance.		Vital services and benefits for American families will ALL be at risk.
Once the tax cuts blow a huge hole in the budget, new attacks on programs that help Americans get by and get ahead will soon follow.
These tax cuts will INCREASE our debt and deficits by $1.5 trillion.		That's $1,500,000,000,000.
It includes trillions of $ in tax cuts that benefit the wealthy &amp; corporations, while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families.
It cuts Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $2 trillion.
It cuts critical national priorities by more than $5 trillion. Education, health care, research, and infrastructure are ALL threatened.
Congress just approved a shockingly extreme budget.		Here's what you need to know:

Saddened to hear of the passing of Dave Armstrong, who provided great leadership for our community and state. His family is in my thoughts.
I‚Äôve called on @GovMattBevin to withdraw his request. He hasn't. So families must be prepared. I'll share @HHSGov's response once received.
This isn't rhetoric, it's a serious warning for those covered by our Medicaid expansion, particularly those with serious medical conditions.
Unless @GovMattBevin reverses course, KY families covered by Medicaid expansion must prepare for their health coverage to be taken away.
.@GovMattBevin has put KY in a dangerous no-win situation. 85,000 will lose coverage if his waiver is approved, far more if it is denied.
The decision on @GovMattBevin's Medicaid waiver request could mean life or death for tens of thousands of Kentuckians.

Muhammad Ali is an ever present reminder than the most famous person in the world can be a real life hero.		He really was the greatest.
At a time when fame so often comes with questionable character...
I am just one of the many in Louisville whose heart aches for the loss of my friend, and yet, our community is better for his impact.
Muhammad Ali was a selfless giant who put principles over everything, and never forgot the city he called home.
A loud-mouthed speedster by the name of Cassius Marcellus Clay, whose fights in and out of the ring would one day make him Muhammad Ali.
I remember waiting for him at Standiford Field when he returned after beating Liston, thinking I had never seen a more perfect human being.
I remember watching every one of his championship fights.
In the ring, there was no one better. But his contributions to humanity managed to eclipse his boxing prowess.
He was a man who gained fame in a violent game, but immortality as a gentle and caring soul.
The word "champion" has never fit a man better. Muhammad Ali was a champion. A champion for peace. For justice. For equality.

Above all, these misguided GOP budgets rely on the very same thing: faith-based accounting. They'll just close their eyes and pray it works.
GOP budgets continue the myth that trickle-down economics works, but only make it easier to retain wealth &amp; virtually impossible to gain it.
Even the nonpartisan @USCBO estimates that repeal of the ACA would increase deficit by $109 billion and cost us $1 trillion in lost revenue.
Chief among the gimmickry is the assertion that there is ANYTHING responsible about stripping healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.
When asked about the GOP budget proposals, even @TaxpayersEllis said "This isn't budgeting, it's gimmickry."
.@BudgetHawks also says Senate GOP budget savings ‚Äúlack specificity, which will make it difficult to turn proposed cuts into real deficit.‚Äù
According to @BudgetHawks, the House GOP budget uses "gimmicks that circumvent budget discipline‚Äù and is ‚Äúunrealistic and unspecified.‚Äù
This criticism isn‚Äôt coming just from people on the left. Conservative groups are also calling out their use of budget trickery &amp; spin.
The GOP‚Äòs House &amp; Senate budgets use some remarkably acrobatic arithmetic to give the appearance of one that balances. It's mostly gimmicks.
Although GOP conferees have decided to negotiate the budget behind closed doors, the harmful realities of their proposals remain clear.
