@Dani_Worth I only ever refer to them as "bones stickin' outta yer mouth."
I see no reason to think either of these measures will get the necessary 60 votes, or that we're all that close to the end of the shutdown. But it's notable that the Senate is actually planning votes on measures that would end it.
1. The Republican plan including border wall money, asylum restrictions, 3-year DACA and TPS reprieve, plus disaster aid.	2. Stopgap through Feb. 8, plus disaster aid. (Same thing House Dems already passed.) https://t.co/9NCKNG9oP5
After initially considering voting on a full Homeland Security spending bill this week, House Dems plan to vote this week on another stopgap measure, this time through Feb. 28. A full approps bill would've been their first true counteroffer on border security money.

@DLind @ThePlumLineGS But the measure didn't include any limits on how much of that money should be used for specific purposes, so I think theoretically they could've used all of it for the wall.
@DLind @ThePlumLineGS The CR House Republicans brought up in December had $5.7b in the full construction/procurement account. That's bc the normal CR level would've been $700m, plus they added $5b for the wall.

@ByRosenberg "Oof," as political analysis.
@kristinabaum Give me a phone call if you think I'm peddling Democratic talking points. Number's in my bio.
@kristinabaum Don't know why you're saying that. I have no interest in a partisan Twitter spat but unless NPS is lying, it is false to say that national parks are not closed because of the shutdown. They have announced specific closures, citing the shutdown. Merry Christmas, though!
@kristinabaum Not sure what you mean. Many parks are open, but some have closed because of the shutdown, at least according to NPS. Randomly looking for examples... "Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve will be closed during the government shutdown," per NPS.
@kristinabaum Some are closed. Gettysburg, for example. From NPS: "Some national parks may remain accessible to visitors; however, access may change without notice. Some parks are closed completely."
@ZachMontellaro You should sew this onto pillows and sell them at a Christmas market. You'd make a killing.
Going on @GovernmentMattersTV a little later this morning to talk shutdown. D.C. people, tune in!
Pence's offer was for seven full appropriations bills, not just a stopgap measure with border money tacked on, Shelby tells reporters.
Senate is out until 4 pm Dec. 27. Pence left Schumer's office, where he made an offer, according to Shelby. Then went to Shelby's office. Either way, the shutdown will go past Christmas.

RT @dwallbank: *VP PENCE HAS LEFT U.S. CAPITOL AS PARTIAL GOVT SHUTDOWN LOOMS	/via @StevenTDennis &amp; @jackfitzdc
Pence leaves Capitol. No comment. His entourage takes the rest of the pizza with them.
Shelby left after 40 minutes. No deal yet. Says "overtures" have been made to Democrats. He likes the Senate's original offer of $1.6b for fencing.
@jslattx3 Pence has returned for more pizza.
Tim Scott exited. Missed him going in. Any updates? "No idea."
@jslattx3 Pence left to another room after 15 minutes or so. Couldn't have had more than two slices, if any. I think he'll be back.
Pence, Mulvaney and Shelby have entered a room where, a few minutes earlier, a gentleman delivered four pizzas from We the Pizza. The group has not disclosed the toppings.
A shutdown is inevitable tonight but the question is how long. Pence is still roaming the Capitol. GOP senators have been relatively upbeat the last couple hours about a possible compromise on border security funds.
@chico1640101 I'm not sure I have an inside scoop on Mattis but there is bipartisan concern not just about the fact that he's leaving but on why he chose to leave. He's respected. Not a good sign that he doesn't want to stick with Trump. Lots of R's believe Mattis is right about Syria, too.
@chico1640101 You're not a fan of LA??? Well, maybe that's another story. Right now, the key question is if they can get Democrats (like a bunch of them, via Chuck Schumer) to agree on something that Trump also likes. This is being brokered by GOP Sens. Perdue, Gardner, and Corker.
Sen. Corker tells us an announcement is coming in the next half hour or so on a procedural path forward on the funding impasse -- though not a substantive solution yet. He doesn't seem to think this will fix things in time to pass something by tonight's deadline.
@MadiLAlexander What 25-year-old doesn't make $100k and only pay $825 in rent?

House Republicans are tacking on border wall and disaster aid money to the CR, not allowing a vote on it as its own amendment. (The amendment itself might have failed on its own.) So they'll vote sometime today on the whole thing and see what the Senate does.
@chico1640101 @Robert_Aderholt Also, some are willing to provide wall money in exchange for DACA protection, but that's not included in this plan.
@chico1640101 @Robert_Aderholt Against an actual wall? That it's a waste of money, that some fencing is necessary but not a wall in the middle of nowhere, and that money should be used for more agents and surveillance, which would better secure the border for less money.
@TheKevo23 Don't know if they'd pass the senates version then or if there's a middle ground. Also don't know if Trump is serious about opposing this CR.
Scalise: Plan is to add $5b for border wall and some disaster aid funds to CR. Plan to take it up today. 		That will not fly in the Senate. But a day and a half until the deadline is enough time for some back and forth. And conservatives can finally get a vote on the wall.

.@Robert_Aderholt after House GOP conference meeting: ‚ÄúMost Republicans want to go on record saying that we do support the wall and we do support the president, so just because the Senate said they‚Äôre not doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs premature to say we want a shutdown.‚Äù
Shutdown state of play: We've got a day and a half left until the deadline and conservatives don't want to give in to a stopgap without getting a vote on border wall funding. That won't fly in the Senate. But this is more about getting a chance to vote than causing a shutdown.
