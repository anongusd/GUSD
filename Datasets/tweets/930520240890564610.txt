@Jim_Jordan  since you are counting, how many did  #Trump tell. So many you cannot count them. Now they are lying about the security clearance. The lies are now catching up with them.  You see no problem with them lying since that is what you do.

@GOP So put @realDonaldTrump  under oath see what his story is. That is what you should be pushing for. You don‚Äôt want that because you know he is guilty. He has openly told you so, yet you look the other way
@RepGosar @GOPoversight It is ironic that you can quickly admit #Cohen as a liar, yet @realDonaldTrump  lies to the world everyday and you have trouble associating the two together. Birds of a feather flock together and  #Trump and #Cohen have been flocking together for decades.

They should have ask him is he working for the @HouseGOP  because the GOP are the only ones who is against @NancyPelosi  because she is a force to be reckoned with. They want the DEM fighting among themselves, this way they can‚Äôt focus on important things.
Why would Hillary have sympathy for Monica, when she was messing with her husband. She should have thought about that and how that would effect her family. No sympathy here.

#CountEveryVote Funny you only have voter suppression in the Democratic area. I would like investigators to see how many of the over 59,000 voters thrown off the register were Republicans. I would wager there was none. #BrainKemp is a cheat. #CannotBeTrusted
Did anyone notice how @realDonaldTrump looked so down in Paris. But when he saw @PutinRF_Eng he lit up like a Christmas tree smiling from ear to ear. Trump is so afraid of Putin, it is so obvious. #ParisPeaceForum
Of course he skipped most of the events, @realDonaldTrump  only went there to have meeting with @PutinRF_Eng . So after he meets with Putin, he returns back early. Go figure.

@realDonaldTrump  is still Riding the @Obama44USA  wave. All that is being accomplished now is because of what @Obama44USA  did. Every time a republican President is put into office they inherit a good economy made by the democrats.
@realDonaldTrump @ScottWalker @LeahVukmir When Trump refer to Maxine Waters as low life, he is really referring to al people of color, this is his true feeling of black people. He feels blacks are unworthy and unequal.
Notice the @realDonaldTrump  could not denounce acts of terror from his heart. He had to read a speech from the TelePrompTer. He was sincere in his message. After all he has encouraged this behavior.
@realDonaldTrump You stupid SOB. Do you really think the King of Saudi Arabia would confess to you, yeah we did.  How stupid can you be.
@FLOTUS  Why now she wants to do an interview on  @ABC  TV. She has not spoken ten words at one time in 2 years. She is only trying to weigh in on the November election. Don‚Äôt buy it America. The @realDonaldTrump is a bully, if she has so much power, she would call him out on it.
@BrettKavanaugh  Putting Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court is like putting @realDonaldTrump  on the court.  The two believe in telling lies when it is convenient for them. We do not need a liar on the court.
He is to crazy to be a Supreme Court justice. Do not put this lunatic on the highest court in the land #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord
#KavanuaghHearings  This performance today demonstrated that he should not be appointed to the highest court in the land. He accused the Dems of conspiracy against him without any evidence. Is this how he would make decision without evidence.

They have to break to give #BrettKavanaugh  pointers on his behavior. He is acting like a total  unhinged person. This person is lying. He will never admit to an FBI investigation because they will turn up incriminating evidence.

@MSNBC  I wish MSNBC contributors would stop blaming Trump behavior on legitimacy of his presidency, couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. He is afraid Putin is going to flip on him if he does not get those sanctions lifted. Putin patients is running thin......
#Helsinki2018 Trump had no intentions of talking  to Russia about our national interest. He went into that meeting to get assurances from Putin that he was not going to flip on him, that is what he is most concerned about. Putin has him in his back pocket.
Putin probably scold Trump in their private meeting that it has been 18 months and sanctions still have not been lifted. He had gotten nothing for his help in making him president. He has threatened to release information if he does not get something soon. #TreasonSummit
The media should use the term  #TreasonSummit every time the refer to this summit. Run the term Treason Summit in the ground everyday all day until election time.
