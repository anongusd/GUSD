@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore Those areas have been proven to trap huge amounts of bacteria. When you shave that pubic area, even a minor cut or laceration can cause bacteria to get inside there, and can very easily cause cellulitis, abscesses, and in very rare conditions.
@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore More importantly, pubic hair serves as protection against bacteria and other pathogens.
@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore It prevents friction during intercourse that can cause skin abrasion and rashes.
@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore For men in particular, (myself) the practice of intimate grooming is one that's kind of confusing, too hairy or not hairy enough.
@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore Some girls trim their pubic hair, or go to a salon to have a “bikini wax”; others prefer to shave just about every day, but most just leave it alone. It's not necessary to remove the hair in this area to keep your body clean.
@vnbateman @Sw3454 @WhoresofYore Pubic hair protects sensitive skin and traps bacteria before they enter the vagina, so when it's removed, vaginal irritation can be more common. 	Removing pubic hair is a personal preference.

@BoerjeBrandt @pkfientlig Trump "inherited a mess" from former president Obama, and Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney claimed—without evidence—that the numbers posted by the Obama administration were purposely misleading to make the economy look better than it was.
@BoerjeBrandt @pkfientlig President Trump has touted the low unemployment rate as proof of his success. During his State of the Union address, Trump noted African-American unemployment, in particular, is at "the lowest rate ever recorded."
@BoerjeBrandt @pkfientlig According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate has dropped to 3.9 percent, the lowest it has been in 17 years. Trump and his supporters say the low unemployment rate is a sign of President Trump's success.

To get things done, the President has depended on #ExecutiveOrders Our lawmakers were feckless, grandstanding promise-breakers. 		I am sad because so many of us worked so hard to disrupt Washington D.C. politics with the election of @POTUS Trump &amp; the control of all 3 branches.
I am upset at @USHouse Republicans. They did not deliver on the repeal of #Obamacare Just couldn't get it done with excuses galore. They did not deliver on the #Wall Now, we face an invasion of #illegals They stood by fussing about the budget while they should had fun the #Wall.
Here is my final takeaway from the loss of the @USHouse A whole lot of Republicans deserved to lose their seats. I had hoped they would have had credible Republican competitors. Unfortunately, WE paid the price. @POTUS Trump, who has worked harder on his agenda promises.
The @USHouse of Representative has 14 days left in session before the new "crew" takes over. My recommendation? Immediately, get the DAMN #wall fully funded. Review all the President has had to accomplish via "executive orders" because of their ineptitude &amp; get legislation passed https://t.co/gdC78YLnOy
