@DankDerpJr @thedailybeast For anyone born before 1960, there’s a good chance they suffered through a measles infection. They may have lived to tell about it, but they probably had friends who didn’t.
@DankDerpJr @thedailybeast In the US, before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were 4 million measles cases with 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths in the US every year. Measles was also a leading killer of children globally.
@thedailybeast 2002, the President told New York Magazine:		“He’s [Epstein] a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
@thedailybeast Virginia Giuffre, the victim, claimed that Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, approached her and manipulated her into sex trafficking while she was working as a towel girl at Mar-A-Lago in 1999. Giuffre was 15 years of age at the time.

@SecNielsen Be part of the solution and RESIGN!  Not paying TSA agents to justify your faux crisis at the border is MORE DANGEROUS.  WHAT wall will protect us from the growing numbers of domestic terrorists or @realDonaldTrump immigrant employees?
@SecNielsen Visual propaganda is not Fact. You are not qualified for the position you hold.  You don’t have the temperament, moral compass or integrity to make judgements impacting national security.  Resign before you enable more legitimate terrorists.
