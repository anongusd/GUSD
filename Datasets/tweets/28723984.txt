4th of July is our celebration of when we fought and won our independence and freedom...if you're intent on killing that with democratic socialism, we will fight you...and we will win!

Democrats are mounting a legal ploy (through INDICTMENT) in an attempt to stop @POTUS from appointing the next justice to the @SCOTUS
SICK RULES for RADICALS - Test #3 for ethical action... "In war the end justifies almost any means"
KNOW THY FOE - The Democrats are employing Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals. Once you understand their tactics, you can use it against them, by not playing their game
From RULES for RADICALS: The job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so it will publicly attack him as a "dangerous enemy". The word "enemy" is sufficient to put the organizer on the side of the people, to identify him with the "Have-nots"
RULES for RADICALS: Organizers must become schizoid, politically... Before men can act an issue must be polarized. Men will act when convinced their cause is 100% on side of angels and the opposition are 100% on the side of the devil.

@CryptoManiac10 It won't affect it at all. Unless a cryptocurrency can be created in such a way that it doesn't act as a security right from the beginning, like #Bitcoin. Ethereum was clearly a security when started, and in the future the SEC will go after such ventures
@CryptoManiac10 Well, first of all he did not declare EOS or other cryptos not to be securities, and his declaration isn't the final word, he also said that people that got in early and used Ethereum as a security may someday face regulation.

@BarbaraBarrett3 @catcherbloc @Marys1stson @SenSchumer Flynn was coerced into pleading guilty, the cost of defending himself completely bankrupted this national hero and patriot, so that Mueller could put another notch on his gun, He forced him the plead guilty on an innocuous a process crime unrelated to Russian Collusion

RT @JackPosobiec: Many people love their lives and wonder if they‚Äôve ever made a difference. Veterans don‚Äôt have to wonder 		Happy Memorial‚Ä¶
@catcherbloc @Marys1stson @SenSchumer BS...first they decided he was telling the truth, then decided to charge him by holding process crime over him, because Mueller felt it looked better. Flynn had a side conversation, there was no meeting, and they knew he was drunk and slipped him up with covert recording
@snowconvallaria @Marys1stson @SenSchumer No, Flynn concerned proper paperwork around Turkey meeting. I'm not going to engage in your side issues, ALL indictments had NOTHING to do with this past election...process crimes or things not related in any way
@snow_math @Marys1stson @SenSchumer Mueller delayed because he NEVER expected the Russians to call his bluff...now scrambling, after being admonished by judge, and will likely keep delaying until the optics fade...fact is he has no evidence
At least we respect free speech...UK has lost its way, going down a very dark road https://t.co/7u8CA3Sbyn
Short Netflix, nothing good can come from Obama deal...besides, none of Netfilx political programming or promotion of anti-Trump comedians, or Bill Nye have been successful, in fact total losers...Obama is icing on that cake
@snowconvallaria @Marys1stson @SenSchumer None have anything to do with Russian collusion in the election, and the Russian companies are here calling Mueller's bluff...because he has no evidence...Mueller in endemic of the deep corruption...Nazzi stats tactics
@Marys1stson @SenSchumer It's not a belief, it is fact...Mueller refused to go to court with the Russians after calling his bluff...scolded by the judge, and the rest are all process crimes having nothing to do with Russia collusion
@PoliticallyRYT @JDHTHEMAN91 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It's interesting that lately I've noticed the programming on Netflix has become more and more dark...I guess prepping for Obama
@patrickrooney @Trading_Tech 80% fundamentals 20% technicals...I use primarily volume profile for the technicals
@SenSchumer And it looks like not a single one related to Russian collusion, including the Russian indictments...and the process crimes will mostly be overturned soon
