@lancesalyers LOL. True. In this case the Executive branch did overstep. Case was dismissed due to standing. Which was ridiculous.
@lancesalyers He could have been one of the State Reps that sued the Governor over the use of the Controlling Board, but wasn't.
@lancesalyers He could have voted no on the last budget to stop Medicaid Expansion. But didnt. If he was serious about Obamacare.
@lancesalyers There is a Local Control Bill in the House right now that he could be the champion of he was serious about Common Core.
