"It's job of journalists to reform, educate and nowadays, to reassure Americans," says Clarence Page. #CoveringPoverty
"Important stories aren't always the stories that grab people," says Clarence Page. #CoveringPoverty
"News is what's happened when things aren't going the way they are supposed to." Clarence Page of @chicagotribune on #CoveringPoverty
"Less sexy" poverty measures like EITC are covered only when about to be destroyed, says @tamarjacoby on #CoveringPoverty
"Journalists make people care about things by choosing what to cover," audience member in response to @jessejholland on #CoveringPoverty
"Our job is to get info out to public, advocates' job is to make people care." @jessejholland on #CoveringPoverty
"If you want a politician to care about something, show how it will affect ppl who vote for them," @jessejholland on #CoveringPoverty
Clear systemic barriers affect everyday Americans' perception of 'non-sexy' #poverty stories, says @Marisol_Bello on #CoveringPoverty
Lived experience influences the way that Americans engage w poverty journalism, says @Marisol_Bello on #CoveringPoverty
"We think a lot about challenge of writing without alienating our audience," says @lkmcgann on #CoveringPoverty &amp; partisanship
"Americans care about where the country is going," want to know about #Poverty across communities, says @tamarjacoby on #CoveringPoverty
"Our goal is always to have ppl understand who lives in #poverty &amp; that they are not 'the other,'" says @Marisol_Bello on #CoveringPoverty
"Working class people do want to tell their stories" and journalists should listen, says @tamarjacoby. #CoveringPoverty
@lkmcgann @voxdotcom But it is "getting harder with industry changes" Laura says. #CoveringPoverty
"We are trying to do better at creating a pipeline for diverse voices in journalism," @lkmcgann from @voxdotcom on #CoveringPoverty
"We need to get better as an industry with including ppl of more geographic diversity in journalism," @jessejholland on #CoveringPoverty
@Marisol_Bello In terms of "racial, gender, economic, political perspectives" to provide context and community knowledge. #CoveringPoverty
"We need diverse voices in newsrooms to cover #poverty," says @Marisol_Bello
"Good way to avoid 'poverty porn' is for coverage to originate from local communities," says @sam_baker of @axios. #CoveringPoverty
"The very things that make a story can take away necessary context," @Marisol_Bello #CoveringPoverty
"Right and left differ in the vocabulary of #poverty and opportunity, which carries over to media" @tamarjacoby #CoveringPoverty
There's little reward for @voxdotcom to publish 'fast' -- the best version of our work is 'complete.' @lkmcgann #CoveringPoverty

A lot of the new, robust policy research at places like @BrookingsInst @AEI, etc., doesn't get covered -- @tamarjacoby #CoveringPoverty
"Part of the problem with #CoveringPoverty -- we hold ppl up for either ridicule or sympathy. They don't want either one." -- @jessejholland
The urge among DC experts and media is "to point and laugh at people" rather than educate -- @lkmcgann #CoveringPoverty
.@sam_baker "The kind of journalism that plainly explains policy is stronger now than ever. But we are only so powerful." #CoveringPoverty
.@Marisol_Bello describing the work of @communitychange -- #CoveringPoverty from the perspective of low-income ppl
@tamarjacoby "People care about the issue, they want to wrestle with the topics." #CoveringPoverty
.@tamarjacoby "My reaction to this media scan is -- there's a lot of coverage of poor people that doesn't call itself a #poverty story."
"Class and #poverty will be the issue of the next century." -- @jessejholland @AP #CoveringPoverty
@jessejholland "When you write about education, you talk to the economics team. You talk to the race and ethnicity team. They're all connected."
One of the things that should have been obvious to journalists years ago is "convergence" -- no more silos @jessejholland #CoveringPoverty
.@lkmcgann -- The purpose of @voxdotcom is to put news in context. So we spend a lot of time explaining structural problems #CoveringPoverty
You shouldn't have to read between the lines to understand how the news affects real people -- @axios @sam_baker #CoveringPoverty

Many women of color tend to be paid less than their white peers even when they have the same educational background, says @AAUW: https://t.co/qKrdKYJd4s. #PovertyDay #EndPoverty #GenderPayGap
In 2014, 29% percent black women had no choice  but to work part-time, because they were unable to find full-time work, compared to 16% of white women. #GenderPayGap #PovertyDay #EndPoverty
#GenderPayGap discussion often disregards discrepancy between white women &amp; women of color. #PovertyDay #EndPoverty https://t.co/XgCFlKH0sq
"That figure obscures the fact that most women of color fare worse than white and Asian women," said @NewRepublic in 2015.
Have you heard the statistic that women earn 78 cents for every American man’s dollar? This statistic is wrong. https://t.co/LDRCqLeADM
#racialwealthdivide permeates experiences of women in poverty. 26.5% of African American women are poor compared to 11.6% of white women, says @amprog. #PovertyDay #EndPoverty #PovertyEradicationDay

@dallasnews @dallaswomensfdn And "women in poverty spend 30 percent of their income on child care."
"Though incomes increase at higher education levels, women make less at each level than men," says @dallasnews and @dallaswomensfdn. #PovertyDay https://t.co/sqRbSxdqGv
"Women on average still make less than men and struggle to pay for child care, and about 17 percent of all women and girls in Texas live in poverty." https://t.co/keK7B70s2u
Next up on our #PovertyDay docket: women and poverty in the U.S.
@uscensusbureau @wwwCISorg The poverty rate of adult immigrants who have lived in the United States for 20 years is 57 percent higher than for adult U.S. born citizens. #PovertyDay #EndPoverty
@uscensusbureau @wwwCISorg And data shows that immigrant #poverty continues even as immigrants &amp; their families live in U.S. for generations.
According to @uscensusbureau and @wwwCISorg, in 2014, immigrants and their children accounted for 25% of all persons in poverty.
Ergo, data shows that majority of individuals in these sectors are born in U.S, not immigrants to U.S.
In 2014, 49% of maids, 47% of taxi drivers, 33% of butchers and meat processors &amp; 35 percent of construction laborers were foreign-born: https://t.co/dhp3kdGiL4
According to @uscensusbureau &amp; @wwwCISorg, rates of work for immigrants and U.S. born citizens are similar — 70 percent of both immigrants &amp; U.S. born held a job in March 2015.
Next up on our Spotlight #PovertyDay docket: poverty among immigrants to U.S.
75 percent of black students who dropped out of undergrad defaulted on their student loans. Inability to pay = inability to receive higher education. #EndPoverty #PovertyDay #PovertyEradicationDay https://t.co/6gD13XDRs8
In conclusion, discussion of student loan crisis should include #racialwealthdivide, particularly because DOE data shows that black students are more likely to take out loans, more likely to be in debt &amp; more likely to drop out of college as a result
Previous reports from our account show that 1 in 4 white Americans receives inheritance or multi-generational wealth, contributing to lack of necessity for student loans and lack of debt.
Many argue that education may not be an equalizer &amp; student loan debt is where #racialwealthdivide begins. #PovertyDay #EndPoverty https://t.co/wkAGGRx06V
Data from @usedgov shows that post-BA attainment, black student loan debt skyrockets by a whopping 114%. White student loan debt? Decreases by almost 60%. #EndPoverty #PovertyDay https://t.co/YEKUMnsbGv
Student loans are first up on our Spotlight #endpoverty series because student poverty contributes to debt, delays wealth accumulation, has lifelong implications
