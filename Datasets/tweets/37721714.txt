@Ctruth4all @DohanyJulian @WSJ @Women4AllOrg @ZionessMovement @ADL Sorry you feel that way, given that this article simply provides factual information. Have a good weekend.
@DohanyJulian @Ctruth4all @WSJ The WSJ reports on all sorts of foreign (or in AIPAC‚Äôs case quasi-foreign) lobbying. I personally have written recent stories on Saudi Arabia, Qatar and more.
@DohanyJulian @Ctruth4all @WSJ What‚Äôs really interesting about your pushback here is that this chart doesn‚Äôt even include all the AIPAC spending. They are for some reason considered domestic, not foreign, lobbyists. So add what you see here to the AIPAC totals.

Yikes! Great point here -&gt; https://t.co/fH21E1O0eQ
The trips are paid through the American Israel Education Foundation, which is controlled by AIPAC, per tax docs. AIPAC's spokesman says the trips "strictly adhere to the spirit and the letter of all rules."
About that AIPAC-related congressional travel to Israel: It ‚Äúsubverts the intention of the law,‚Äù says Craig Holman, who pushed for the 2007 ban on lobby-funded private trips. 	https://t.co/2qosb1MTG7
AIPAC has 100,000 members, it says. Its financial impact on campaigns is difficult to track. Through its "Congressional Club," it asks members to give at least $2,500 per year directly to candidates -- and to make sure the donations are made ‚Äúin a clearly pro-Israel context."
One of AIPAC's biggest annual expenditures is its giant DC policy conference, coming up next month. About 18,000 activists attend. Last year 35 (!) senators and reps spoke.
Some facts &amp; figures:	- AIPAC raises more than $100 million a year, per tax returns	- It spends about $3.5M on 10 lobbyists a year, per lobby disclosures 	- A group it controls has spent $16M on 1,400 congressional trips to Israel since 2000, per travel records

Warren has the most in Senate campaign money, which can be used in the presidential race: 	Warren $11 million	Gillibrand $10 million	Booker $4 million	Harris $1.3 million	- via Thursday FEC filings
- Finally, Warren has been a tremendous small-dollar fundraiser in the past. FEC records show more than half of her Senate money comes from donors giving $200 or less. That makes this initial prez number somewhat perplexing.	https://t.co/FuytdIlhx8
- She wants no help from a super PAC, which means small donations are even more important	- Online fundraising tends to build on itself. That's why Bernie circa 2015/6 and Kamala Harris have shared numbers
Why Warren's $300,000 fundraising on announcement day matters:	- She has pitched herself as a grassroots candidate; online donations show how that's going (1/3)	https://t.co/aS4AVW1eZ9

Because these financial reports cover different (and overlapping) amounts of time, they cannot directly be compared for income/asset changes. At least not without some clear caveats.

@dominique6138 This PAC files FEC forms. You can see the donors for yourself. However, there is a nonprofit part of America First, and the public does not get to see those donors.
Steve Wynn gave America First $500,000 on Jan 23. 		Three days later, @WSJ published a blockbuster investigation on sexual harassment that led to his resignation.

America First, the pro-Trump super PAC, raised about $4.8 million in the first three months of the year. 		- That‚Äôs more than all of last year	- It‚Äôs perhaps less than you‚Äôd expect for a group with explicit buy-in from Trump and Pence	https://t.co/SpGyExN3Cq
