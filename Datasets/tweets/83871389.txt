@SecPompeo says "It‚Äôs not a pipe dream to ask the #Iranian leadership to behave like a normal, responsible country.  Our asks are simple.
After US pullout of terrible #JCPOA, @POTUS names goals for #Iran:  1. Apply strong financial pressure; 2. Deter Iranian aggression; 3. Advocate for Iranian people; and 4. Seek bold new steps with allies &amp; partners, and Iran as well. @SecPompeo
@SecPompeo Today "#Iran could have used the money from #JCPOA  to boost the economic fortunes of a struggling people. Instead the regime spent it fueling proxy wars &amp; lining the pockets of #IRGC, #Hizballah &amp; #Hamas. Iran advanced its march across the Middle East during JCPOA."

RT @Jerusalem_Post: IN PICTURES: Israelis parade for Jerusalem Day, Palestinian protest turns violent http://t.co/itmqDt9hOt
Pray that the P5+1 drafting an Iran Nuclear Agreement be thwarted in their intent to make any deal-even a toothless one-that Iran will sign
Who'd have dreamt we'd see Cold War redux in Europe, Korean War restart and MidEast in flames...while Obama and Kerry fiddle?
Time for Congress to step in and set sound foreign policy instead of State Department making it up as they go.
World nations are laughing at feckless  US foreign relations, when they are not crying over resultant chaos.
Why not just give Kerry Nobel peace prize so he can end his serial foreign policy blunders, cut losses &amp; retire?
Why does Kerry try to force a futile Israel-PLO pact as real threats are Iran, Syria, Russia, N. Korea...?
Kerry should read 3/31 Jackson Diehl Wash. Post op-ed: get real, there's no	overall Peace deal to be made now.
Free him but don't extort Israeli surrender!
Kerry's move to extend peace talks by hint US to release old spy-&amp; pawn for all seasons-Pollard Cynical.

I Like Michael Rubin on US-Russian Ukraine standoff: if it's Chamberlain vs. Machievelli, Mac wins.
I hear this JFK has medals as VN war hero. Now he can be peace hero too: give him Nobel PP so he can retire.
John Kerry needs Nobel P.P.  as did e.g. Shimon Peres, Pres. Obama, &amp; Yasser Arafat, so he can stop working so hard.
John Kerry must get Nobel P.P.:	never has 1 man tried so hard to make peace in so many places with no results; cheer him up a NPP!
Dear Nobel Peace Prize Committee: I wish to nominate US Secy. of State John Kerry for the Nobel Peace Prize.
RT @CUFI: Israel Air Force strikes terror cell attempting to fire rockets at civilians http://t.co/yrbkmTdzwm
Ike let USSR invade Hungary, told Brits/French/Israel: withdraw from Sinai, let Nasser keep Suez Canal
Obama's bullies Israel/appeases Russia: worst since '56:
...to sign a peace deal when there is no partner for peace
Someone should propose Secretary of State John Kerry for a Nobel peace prize so that he can receive it and therefore stop pressuring Israel
@USChamber As one who wrote the enviro-laws, I find such blind opposition to energy projects mindless; abundant, clean gas is a step up.
This reflects Natan Sharansky's definition of democracy in his book that he said his friend Pres. W Bush 41 never understood.
In fact let's replace UN with Free Nations' League of  lands where all can say anything in town square w/o fear of life, limb or other loss.
...lest we think, e.g. Israel, India or Italy is messier than a theocracy or other tyranny
Recall Churchill's 'democracy is the worst form of government except for the others'...
Bottom line: let Congress set MidEast policy goals in law, instead of key Sen. &amp; Rep.'s telling Pres. how to 'pick a winner' in each land
On Pres's Day, ask if Syria's Assad or Afghans' Karzai likely will be followed by a Washington, Lincoln, Bin Ladin or Hitler?
While we despise dictators, are Iraqis, Libyans, and Egyptians  happier now than under Saddam, Qaddafi, Mubarak respectively?
3 years ago, Libya revolt began as Hilary, Susan &amp; Samantha saw 'duty to protect'; who's asked Libyans: 'Better off then or now?
Don't forget Franklin's reply when asked the type of government they had set up: "A republic, if you can keep it"; Act today to Keep it!
On Presidents Day, thank God Founders wrote an Independence Declaration &amp; Constitution to avoid tyranny or anarchy
...belligerent statements and sending warships to our shores!
Iran regime has odd ways of showing 	peaceful intents in the midst of nuclear arms talks -
Don't just imagine what you would have done in Holocaust; a new one threatens and CIPAC can prevent it.
Join our CIPAC All-In Call-in tonight to strategize on how to fight for Israel and America against our enemies.
Let's show CIPAC has just begun to fight!
Iran lobbyists say they're winning fight against Iran sanctions bill since pro-Israel forces have given in.
Tell yr. US Senators 2 make him "free it to prevent Israel genocide"
Maj. Ldr. Reid said he'd let S.1881 Nuclear Weapons Free Iran Act come up for vote last month.
Should not be about who is invited to Geneva, but what's on the table to end the carnage of Syrian men, women, children, elderly, and more..
Having lost sight of their Syria objectives, U.S. and UN diplomats redouble efforts; So Senate must pass Syria policy law
Reports: Iran Talks Pushing Saudi Arabia to Acquire Nuclear Weapons http://t.co/u1iLuwksW2
Obama also is a political genius, He's united Sen. Schumer (D-NY) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) - against him on Iran deal.
Obama is diplomatic genius, he united Israel and Saudi Arabia (against him on Iran).
