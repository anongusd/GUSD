@DestroysAntiFa @thehill You're clearly the idiot. Maybe Roseanne hasn't been called racist until now but she definitely has a history of racist tweets and If you don't see that Trump's a racist you need help... I don't acknowledge ignorant people like you so have a nice day.
@DestroysAntiFa @thehill Well, first of all, this has nothing to do with her being a Conservative. It's the fact that she herself is a known racist and for her NOT to defend Roseanne is flabbergasting to say the least, especially considering she's always defending Trump's racism.
@thehill Well this is new.... https://t.co/Zs2trwlL9k
@TheRealJRSmith I hope you're scoring half of the Cavs points in game 2 after that.
The Warriors NEED each other. They could NEVER be a LeBron James individually.
LeBron to the Pelicans next season... him, Rondo, AD, and Cousins would DESTROY the Warriors.
Draymond Green could NEVER carry a team to the Finals alone like LeBron. No one on the Warriors could!!!!
Draymond Green was really dancing like he doesn't get a free ride to the Finals every year. It's always the side bitch who shows off.
JR NEEDS TO BE DRUG TESTED BEFORE EVERY GAME WTFFFF #NBAFinals

@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism So if they're aware &amp; so concered why not just steer clear of women all together at school
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Some colleges accept students with bad grades too dummy. I'm saying minorities can be chosen over white people because of better grades &amp; not affirmative action.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Then she was potentially (in the future) killed 3 days later &amp; police claimed it a suicide
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Sandra bland was pulled over for failing to signal, arrested for "contempt of cop/disrespect" (not illegal), after the officer threatened her &amp; tried to remove her from the car &amp; search it even though he had no probable cause or warrant
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism There are some online maybe not as many as women but they exist. &amp; yeah but men don't say to themselves "oh, I don't want to go to/or finish college because I'm afraid I might get accused of rape"
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Ancestors or not it doesn't deactivate your privilege because of what people who look like you did.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Yes, men do have sex-based scholarships.. &amp; if their main focus was to graduate being accused of rape wouldn't even be a concern for them.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Not all 24/7, but definitely more often than white people do. They don't have to worry about being potentially killed during a traffic stop for something as minor as failing to signal. &amp; that's so untrue I see all hate crimes being reported no matter the perpetrators skin color.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Your white privilege was never your fault but your ancestors. they conquered america, seen themselves as superior to other races, &amp; that resulted in slavery, segregation/Jim crow laws, inequality etc
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism It doesn't matter if your ancestors enslaved people or not, they still forced natives off their own land even though they were willing to share it. Forced them to disregard their culture, Not to mention, carried over diseases which killed more than half the native population.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Also men who do enroll in college, at whatever age, are more likely to drop out than women, so that's no one's fault but their own.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Ok? isn't that called diversity &amp; equal opportunity? That doesn't mean rejection because you're white. There are still plenty of predominantly white colleges. &amp; not all minorities get into college solely based on affirmative action some actually do have the grades for it.

@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism My narrative was I would't be proud if my ancestors stole land and/or enslaved people. All those group of people you named aren't my ancestors so why would I care
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism None of those were true
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I couldn't care less, none of those other races are apart of my ancestry.

@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Well, personally if I were white I would accept the fact that I'm white to say the least but not necessarily be proud considering my ancestors stole america from its natives, enslaved certain people, so on &amp; so forth... &amp; the "college decline because your white" is utter bs.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Uh. in general means usually/mainly/as a whole so why can't I?
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I'm aware of men's issues but I still need to know an ACTUAL white person issue
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Also, the point being is that men don't face even half the issues women do so why not start with the bigger problems &amp; I still have yet to hear one white person issue...
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Being white in America has never been an issue for whites. In general, they've never been oppressed because of their skin color so the "It's ok to be white" statement was never about pride, more so the privilege they have for being white.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Clearly, it sounded like you were speaking to me since I think the complete opposite.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism You're a low life with nothing else better to do but talk shit over the internet I don't deal with pests like you so don't @ me again if you want to be disrespectful.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism No one said they can't be proud of their race and gender just don't turn a blind eye or be biased toward the issues women and non-white people face in America solely because they aren't male and white, as if they don't exist
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism No, according to you they can't be oppressed because they are simply in position of power (let alone the majority in power). Those are your own words not mine...
RT @JMEZ__: Young kids in Baltimore are being forced to attend schools without proper heating, failing plumbing and overall inhumane condit‚Ä¶
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Men and white people are the majority in power, like you said if certain people were "truly oppressed" they wouldn't be in position of power... not that it's a true statement just using your own logic against you.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism You must learn how to spell before using lame jokes.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I'm dying to know how you came up with that thesis
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I'm female and nope just old-fashioned.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism The fact of the matter is OPPRESSION EXISTS end of story.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Last time I checked government racism is institutional.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I responded to a direct question, you asked an indirect question and no one enlightened you so I was nice enough to do so.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism An oppressed person can rise to power by their damn selves with their own self built empires with the support of their fellow oppressed people you idiotic fuck.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Black males who commit petty crimes tend to get longer sentences than white males who commit the same crimes or even worse crimes is my point.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism Completely false.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism "Black people are more likely to commit crime"	Yeah, we're done here.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I appeared in your notifications but wasn't talking to you. Did I butt in any of your conversations speaking to others with me mentioned in them? I think not.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism What does having a black president have to do with oppression of minorities in America? All that means is he was a respectable candidate with morals worthy enough to be president. All those issues I stated before were alive &amp; well during his presidency too.
@gracekarach @Ace_The_Lion @EvrydayFeminism I've been done talking to you.. your oblivion is past discussion. If you must know though, you have the criminal (in)justice system, mass incarceration, police brutality, racial profiling, racial wage gap etc
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I'm also aware that there's minorities in position of power but that doesn't mean minorities in general aren't oppressed.
@Ace_The_Lion @gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Yes everyone has the right to vote, but obviously the popular vote doesn't always matter considering its been 5 times in history where a presidential candidate has been elected without it.

@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism The weaker physique &amp; more emotional comment does apply to every single women in existence some men are weaker and more emotional than some women &amp; to say women are less likely to make logical decisions is pure ignorance
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I mean you said women are weaker etc etc I was just throwing out a trans name suggestion for you üëå
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Well go for it you can be Israel instead of Isabelle.
@gracekarach Think whatever floats your boat üò≠
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Men aren't equal to women in SOME cases like I pointed out with the custody and child abuse but women aren't equal to men in MOST cases. and I think you secretly want to be a man you should transform already no judgement.
@gracekarach There are plenty of pro-choice people out there who agree so no embarrassment here. üòÇ
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I can agree about the custody winners and child abusers but the rest is totally irrelevant to the topic of equality. Women are still less equal.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Of course, why shouldn't they? it's a legal process totally different from an illegal murder &amp; like you said it's their OWN babies so they should have the right.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism MEN ALREADY HAVE EQUALITY. EQUALITY IS NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR THEM AS IT IS WOMEN. THEY'VE HAD SUPERIORITY FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Totally, but if the woman is a "my body my choice" type then so be it, they would have to be the ones to come to a conclusion not society.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I agree but you never know the circumstances and that's not society's decision to make
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Considering the fact that you're a woman, why don't you have the same drive for women's equality (much needed) as you do for men's equality (less needed)?
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Women use to not even be allowed work or an education. We've came a long way and there still isn't full equality for women today,
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a child is the mother's decision, No one has to agree with whatever that decision may be but it's her human right. America has never had to fight equality for men. Men have always had opportunities.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism We're not talking about other people we're talking about the POTUS. He's clearly sexist and has no right to tell women what they can &amp; cannot do with their own bodies. Child-rearing isn't only a woman's job, just like cooking/cleaning isn't. You ma'am are a sad excuse for a woman

@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism The gender pay gap exists I don't know what else to tell you. Let's just agree to disagree.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Yes, but do those things make you oppressed or determine weather you get a job a not. Trump's a sexist and a racist yet he's still POTUS. You think Obama could've been those things and have even the slightest chance of becoming president?
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Let's be honest. Asians aren't really "people of color" &amp; they don't have bad stereotypes surrounding them like blacks &amp; Latinos.. also did you check out the male to female earnings? that's what we were initially debating about and there's your evidence clear as day.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Once again that chart is outdated &amp; are you aware of Trump at all? Also most Asians build off their self owned businesses.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Asians being the most moneymakers means nothing, is the majority in the government Asian? no so just stop
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism *White man's world simply meaning they have it good because of their race and sex, not that they own the world I was never implying they're ALL evil oppressors there are some though.

@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Now you're just reaching for everything possible lmao I have no idea how  Asians doing the best in school or the chart relates to anything I said about it being a white man's america plus its outdated soo yeah rich black americans paved the way for their damn selves no privilege
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism You are hilarious I'm literally laughing out loud at every reply from you. üò≠ I can agree to disagree. You're entitled to your opinion as am I. I'll never be  butt hurt. "Black Privilege" is so made up I cannot deal lmao
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism I don't even know why I asked, you're white privilege was screaming from the start. Are you really that ignorant? As if white people don't use or anything invented by black people just to name a few: ironing board dryer lawn mower potato chips peanut butter so on &amp; so forth
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism First of all, I'm not demonizing white men. There are many white men out there for equality. In America the majority in charge are white men so all those homeless white men Americans wasted their whiteness. They don't have to worry about sexism and racism in a workplace.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism It doesn't matter past or present.	I take it that you're a white woman so please explain to me what "stuff of you guys" do black people use?
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Okay, please stop. This is becoming laughable. Yes, any race can be racist and either gender can be sexist but this is a WHITE MAN'S WORLD. They don't face hardship in this world! plain &amp; simple.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism White actors play historically black characters as well *cough cough* Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra hell even Jesus Christ himself.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism As I stated before its the white-washing of everything once a white person flaunts something that originated in black culture its "newly discovered" or the "newest trend"		You're not serious about the basketball question.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism You're oblivious as well I see. The fact that you're a woman saying all of this is beyond me.. of course we all have equal rights but that doesn't stop all the sexist, racist people in charge out there from belittling or criminalizing certain people.
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Anyways the white-washing of everything is excruciating all of a sudden white women are referring to their curly hair as afro's. like really...
@gracekarach @EvrydayFeminism Ha, no hate I just think it's pretty fun debating with you. Based off your tweets you seem like a very bias person &amp; if I can attempt to enlighten people like yourself it always feels good lol..
