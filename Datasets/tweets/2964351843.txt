Last clip: Congress must focus on  Immigration Reform. Hard-working people should be able to come out of the shadows http://t.co/s2wFtTOFXl
2 clip: must pass LONG-TERM funding for transit. Essential for safety. Also key to #ag, #manufacturing, #Construction http://t.co/Chb91ibJXB
Too much work to be done for Congress to leave early. Check out the first part of my speech today on the Ex-Im Bank. http://t.co/64vQsFL3bC

Last is comprehensive immigration reform. Must pull hard-working people out of the shadows, attract global talent, make business competitive
Certainty in transit funding is key to more investments and more jobs. #Ag, #manufacturing, #construction sectors all rely on safe roadways
Second is LONG-TERM transportation funding. 1/4 of #Nebraska bridges are unsafe. Nebraska families need reliable roads to get around.
Last year alone, #NE02 exported over $60 million in Nebraska-Manufactured goods. More exports=more jobs. #ExIm4Jobs
First, we need to authorize @EximBankUS. Ex-Im is great for small and medium sized businesses in Nebraska. Helps export U.S. made products.
@richeaton777 I couldn't agree more. I don't control when Congress adjourns-the majority does. Watch my speech to learn more.
Too much work to be done for Congress to leave early. Need to stay to focus on bipartisan solutions to grow the economy and jobs.
Tune in for my speech in the House today. I'll also livetweet.  Congress is leaving early without fixing key issues  http://t.co/xRdu2tbIjk
