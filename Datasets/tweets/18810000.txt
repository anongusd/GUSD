@RepJoeKennedy so let's use our moments on earth talking about something different: #GreenNewDeal
@RBReich watch if you want, folks, but #unfollowthenetworks on twitter, just for the day, so they get the message that we know they're trying to give trump 2020. It's a quick easy way to #GeneralStrike #nationalstrike and it's like a VOTE TODAY.
@tedlieu @VP if only for just today, we can do this, Ted! It's like a #NationalStrike2019 to simply #unfollowthenetworks TODAY, just for the day. Right here on @twitter, they will get the message. Watch the show if you want, but #unfollowthenetworks #GeneralStrike
@Marieauntannet1 @Seajay603 @RepAdamSchiff @DinaBoz I think the mere act of hitting the unfollow button, if only for the day, would let them know that we know they're trying to give him 2020.
@tedlieu @VP Ted, we need to #unfollowthenetworks on twitter TODAY. If we do that TODAY, then all of you politicians and all of the pundits could see in advance of this shitshow how we feel. That's the only instant way to send the message that we will not be lied to and have it amplified.
@HeidiNBC @morgfair @NBCNews #unfollow the networks for bowing down to trump. It's just a simple easy way to tell the networks that there is consequence to giving trump 2020. If everyone does this TODAY, they will get the message. #unfollowthenetworks
@RepAdamSchiff @DinaBoz we just don't have time for all this, Adam. Lead the charge to #unfollow the networks' twitter accounts today for covering this speech. That's the only instant way to send the message that we will not be lied to and have it amplified.
@theloraxesunite @LeeHillerLondon @CNN @NBCNews @abcnews @CBSNews @FoxNews @NewsHour @cspan @MSNBC it's quick n easy, and if enough people do it TODAY, then the networks will truly notice the disconnect
@LeeHillerLondon @theloraxesunite @CNN @NBCNews @abcnews @CBSNews @FoxNews @NewsHour @cspan @MSNBC #unfollow all of them on twitter and they'll get the message in real time
