@AOC But let‚Äôs not talk about all the propaganda paid for by Soto‚Äôs.
@AOC In order to generate wealth you have to motivate people to work. taxation &amp; redistribution won‚Äôt do it.  Capitalism, free trade, &amp; jobs are what generate wealth.
@AOC @paulkrugman Why don‚Äôt you sell your $6,000 suit and feed some homeless people instead of stealing from those of us who actually work.
@AOC Instead of sea levels why don‚Äôt you think about jobs instead of chasing out a company that would have hired 25,000 people. Those families could have used that money and Amazon pays well.
@AOC You@memtioned Holy Book, ok@assuming you believe in some sort of ‚ÄúGod‚Äù.  Do you not believe that he is all knowing and that he prepares the earth to last us through whatever decisions we make good or bad until HE decides to end the world. No amount of planning can change HIS time

@SenMikeLee The warden at Butner is so angry over the bill she has instructed all guards to make two write ups a day over anything they can and no dismissals. All write ups will come off their good time credit. This is how they retaliate.
@SenMikeLee Only thing is the Cruz amendments seriously watered it down. Better than nothing but there‚Äôs a long way to go. The white collar criminals get fewer breaks than the drug dealers and they have the lowest chances of recidivism.
@TomCottonAR what a blithering idiot you are! Have you even read the bill you oppose. Obviously not. I‚Äôm neither a lawyer or been in trouble a day in my life but I was this bill and you are lying through your teeth. Mass exaggeration. Who is lining your pockets, private prisons?

@SenMikeLee @SenTomCotton But the private prisons are lining his pockets and if he brings it to the floor he won‚Äôt get their money anymore.
@SenMikeLee They bank on people being too lazy or stupid to read it. It‚Äôs only 81 pages and the prison reform portion about the same. I haven‚Äôt read the Cruz amendment yet but all total is less than maybe 225 pages. McConnel, Corker, &amp; Cotton are all lying about this.
@SenMikeLee McConnell has stock in private prisons AND has received over 550,000 from them in the last year. Postponed putting this to a vote 16, 17, &amp; 18 while lining his pockets. Cotton &amp; Corker are just as bad. Indict McConnell for taking bribes at Americans expense.
@SenTomCotton You are so wrong. I‚Äôve read the bills both of them. The First Step Act was perfect before the senate slapped on the prison reform portion. Cruz amendmen fixed that. McConnell gets 5.5m in private prison money  and has pushed this bill off for 3yrs. How much are they paying you?
@ImNatZS @thehill @JackPosobiec I‚Äôm a veteran so believe me I‚Äôm a true American! Also proof has already been put out that all that happened was a few hundred minor Facebook posts, nothing even went viral. Do your research.
@GeorgePapa19 Y‚Äôall need to investigate @senatemajldr for taking bribes from private prisons and preventing any form of #PrisonReform to get a vote for the last four years. #FirstStepAct
@thehill @JackPosobiec It‚Äôs been over 2 years, if there was anything legitimate it would be public by now. This is just a rumor mill meant to undermine him in 2020.

I mean I‚Äôm a cover stuff republican and these three are pi$$ing me off. How about some term limits here and induced McConnell for taking bribes from private prisons. He‚Äôs afraid it will pass and that‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt allow it on the floor. https://t.co/N1nJvAH453
@SenTomCotton I call bullshit. We all know McConnell has the private prisons lining his pockets &amp; this bill would eliminate the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for them and out folks back in BOP only facilities. Y‚Äôall taking bribes from private prisons then acting like the other senators don‚Äôt want to vote for this.
@SenTomCotton This bill has 86% approval in both houses. Booker &amp; Graham Agee, POTUS &amp; #FOP agree. Get outta the damn way &amp; bring it to the floor.
@KevinARing @SenTomCotton Corker &amp; McConnell are the other two. They all get money from private prisons &amp; known fact McConnelk owns stock in private prisons.

@Beau_Jolais @SenTomCotton Trump wants it passed, Booker, Graham, &amp; FOP want it passed but @senatemajldr has received  over half a mil from private prisons &amp; owns stock in them. It‚Äôs called bribery. Let‚Äôs just call ‚Äòem #CrookedCotton &amp; #MoneyManMcConnell

@DanielBoswell @richardmarx When the initial claims about Vosby were decades old I thought it was ridiculous. When recent events were PROVEN in court I changed my mind about him.
@thehill @BrettKavanaugh I hope they see truth and light through the scales on their eyes and confirm this good man.
@BrettKavanaugh I believe you. I was tearing up listening today. Very proud of how you handled yourself. Dignity, strength, honestly, direct. You are a good man &amp; we need more of you. Please don‚Äôt give up. Our family supports you &amp; we are praying for you.
@lukepell @LindseyGrahamSC was on fire today. In a good way. I believe she was victimized but not by him. #IStandWithKavanaugh #IStandWithBrett @BrettKavanaugh @JudgeKavanaugh
@lukepell This is mistaken identity. There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs ever done anything like this but I do believe someone did it to her. Sick a lifetime of impeccable service &amp; integrity can so easily be destroyed by an unproven claim. We‚Äôre sadly no longer a country of innocent until proven guilty.
@JeffProbst Good season so far. I‚Äôve watched all but fall 2001 when I was buying a house and getting married and fall 2007 when I was in basic training. Thanks for all the fresh faces and no recycles has been a this season. Very nice!
@richardmarx I‚Äôve been assaulted &amp; I believe something happened to her but I heard both sides and I do not believe it was him. Too many inconsistencies in her story and too much corroboration on his to believe it was him.
@BandB_CBS So when will we see Friday‚Äôs episode?
@gregrikaart You already had your mind made up b4 you ever heard him speak. I believe something happened but after hearing her witnesses refuted her claims, his diaries/calendars/200+ women from school &amp; work that speak to his respect &amp; integrity I do NOT believe it was him. Mistaken identity
While I too believe something happened somewhere at some time, I also believe it wasn‚Äôt him. I believe it‚Äôs mistaken identity. #IStandWithKavanaugh #IStandWithBrett a good man w/ years of impeccable service, integrity &amp; respect has been tarnished by vastly unproven allegations.

@SenateMajLdr Well said sir. There are a lot of good people that stay out of politics because they don‚Äôt want every thing they ‚Äúmay‚Äù have done drug out and used to destroy everything they‚Äôve worked for.
@aishatyler Globalism and New World Order are NOT A good thing. We can get along with the world and still put the best interest of our country first. I‚Äôd rather have a president that‚Äôs a dick than one that‚Äôs a pussy and kissing every other leaders ass.
@CarlyFiorina It‚Äôs up to local and state law enforcement to ‚Äúhear‚Äù woman or any supposed victim. If something doesn‚Äôt have enough evidence to convict in a court of law, or much less even have official charges filed then it certainly shouldn‚Äôt destroy a teenagers life 35 years later.
@realDonaldTrump Praying a LOT.  Five unproven moments in the life of a teenager should not destroy everything a person is spent 35 years to build.

@richardmarx He‚Äôs done a LOT more than the left gives him credit for.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump And get rid of Jeff Sessions while he‚Äôs at it.
@MrNashvilleTalk @BillCosby @BillClinton Well with so many dead bodies in the wake of the Clinton‚Äôs people are hesitant to push anything.
@ThisIsRobThomas She didn‚Äôt accuse him of rape, she accused him of groping her. BIG difference. HUGE difference. If a woman can destroy a man 35 years later for copping a feel l, I could ruin a lot of men who grew up to be incredible husbands, fathers, &amp; stewards of God &amp; our country.
@richardmarx Completely agree. Big difference in what he did and Judge K maybe possibly drunkenly groping one drunken girl 35 years ago. Cosby is a predator. Judge K is definitely not. I put ankle monitors on people every day. You learn fast to tell the repeat creeps from those who are aren‚Äôt

@TheTalkCBS Kavanaugh is totally awkward &amp; nerdy, no problem believing he was a virgin many years. No man wants to admit to that or would use something that against the norm as a defense. Still 35 years ago &amp; he was a minor. How he‚Äôs lived 35 years means more than 5 min as a teen

@YandR_CBS prisons do not allow jeans so let‚Äôs see Lilly in a more realistic orange jump suit.
@YandR_CBS Moriahs makeup is practically flawless today.... except the lips. Whoever did her lipstick needs to learn to keep the lipstick on the actual lips not trying to draw them bigger than actual size.

@BandB_CBS Thorn is WAY overstepping and Katie needs to grow up &amp; put him in its place. Instead of taking the kid away she needs to be telling the boy his daddy loves him but has a very demanding job &amp; needs to tell Thorn to mind his own damn business.
@BandB_CBS please recast the kid/Will. Looks like a very homey girl. Doesn‚Äôt look even remotely like Katie or Bill, maybe find a boy with a dark hair and a decent haircut and not so whiney and sickley looking. This is TV soposed to be Bold and BEAUTIFUL.
@BandB_CBS someone please tell Thorn to shave that crap off ha face. It‚Äôs not thick or dark enough to look right and it just looks weird. He would lol much better clean shaven.

@BandB_CBS Best is for Liam to quit being a wus and make up his mind for good and stick with it. Whatever it looks like, predictability &amp; stability is always the best for any child.
@BandB_CBS waiting for Hopeless to get tired of being second choice and hearing Lame obsess over Steffy. She needs to dump him too &amp; move on. Her swooning over a man who is indecisive &amp; obsessed with another woman is just plain pathetic.
@BandB_CBS I don‚Äôt like it but I‚Äôm super proud of Steffy for standing up for herself &amp; not continuing to tolerate his flip-flopping. It‚Äôs about time a woman on this show was strong &amp; determined instead of letting a man string her along ..... #TeamSteffy

@VillyFans @YRInsider @CBSDaytime hating the new Billy as are most fans. Read your Facebook threads!!!!!!
RT @Rmartin67: @DougDavidsonYR Paul has work cut out 4 him! GC is full of crazy people and vigilantes! Love it!! #YR @YandR_CBS @YRInsider
@jellybeanscotty yay! I did that with my law class yesterday but spreadsheet won't be as easy.
@CJLeBlanc @YRInsider @gregrikaart @CBSDaytime @YRJimmyF @Global_TV @TF1 she's nuts! However her make up looked the best ever!
@Traceybregman @YRInsider mine too but as long as the dogs don't eat the cat poo it's all good.
@AmericanIdol the only think I can compare her performance to would be a vocal version of a seizure.
@HarryConnickJR @AmericanIdol Jena yes, but the other two were mistakes. Especially the boring nurse!
@AmericanIdol she would get booed off of a cruise ship!!
@KeithUrban @TheBriaAnai @TheeMarrialle @iambrianaoakley @SpencerLloyd @GeorgeLovett @EmmanuelZidor the nurse should NOT have made it
@KeithUrban you guys picked the WRONG three wild cards! The nurse is boooringüëÉüí§‚ÄºÔ∏è should have been one of the men on the bench instead.
@AmericanIdol she's cute but extremely boring. Really needs to go. There are others with more talent who didn't get to sing tonight!
@MClaireEgan @YRInsider you're beautiful at any age!
@sherylunderwood you look beautiful today! Love those colors on you!
@SDLOVE77 @YRInsider @CBSDaytime I hope Victor kills him because I HATE this actor. FFWD through all his scenes.
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime No!! We all know Kelli is the one who hit Delia
@soapsindepthcbs @YRInsider @tristanrogers I like him more than Victor!
@EHLeBrun @YRInsider he's ugly and can't act. Write him off already!
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime #TeamVitch I was hoping they would have killed Billy off. He's ugly &amp; can't act!!!
@TheTalk_CBS Patrick Stewart is the only sexy bald man that has ever lived!
@YRInsider @CJLeBlanc @Traceybregman @CBSDaytime david tom completely sucks and he's ugly so double reason to FFWD through.
@YandR_CBS who's the new stylist, someone wash Victorias hair. Teach David Tom how to act. I've see better actors in elementary school plays
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime The new Billy is no talent, horrible. I realize soap stars aren't grade A but this guy just plain sucks!
@AmericanIdol  he has a little flavor of Chris Isaacs I love this kid.
@sherylunderwood come to NC!! Charlotte if you can.
@TheTalk_CBS @AndersonAnthony better ways to spend your money on your children. Teach them to mimic civic leaders not hang leaders.
@TheTalk_CBS @sherylunderwood put some braces on that kid, put him in a suit and give him the tools to make something of himself! üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏èU‚ÄºÔ∏è
@CJLeBlanc @YRInsider @CBSDaytime kill off Billy and Cane please!!! Boring &amp; can't act!!! Bring back Adam &amp; the old Abby!!
@DougDavidsonYR @YRInsider please tell me they will kill off Cane or Billy, neither can act &amp; they are both incredibly boring!
@walshlbee @YRInsider he is a cutie
@KeithUrban Jena was the only one that made me look up from my spreadsheet tonight the others either no good or boring personalities.
@AmericanIdol just cause you're gay doesn't mean you gotta dress do horrible. Get some pride and look like you care about yourself.
@AmericanIdol @johnlegend got no prob w/ ppl being gay but isn't that spose to make u have BETTER fashion sense does that only apply to men?
@AmericanIdol pitchy chaos was so unpleasant!!! Why in the world do they butcher such popular songs‚ÄºÔ∏è
@AmericanIdol I like harsh Harry, someone's gotta be realistic!
@AmericanIdol so far she's the only one worth voting for!!!
@HarryConnickJR @AmericanIdol the females this year are terrible, the men are much better this season.
@JLo this years female contestants suck. We'll have an all males once it gets past the half and half point.
@AmericanIdol @OfficialAdele she sucks! This girl shouldn't have made it past round 1. Mousy and boring, marginal voice. Nothing special.
@AmericanIdol been wondering why Kristen is here since they first picked her. She can't sing! Also needs serious help with her makeup!!
@shemarmoore look at the Hard Rock clothes and substitute the Baby Girl logo.
@TheTalk_CBS @BBheathertom @BandB_CBS @davidtom_23 @YandR_CBS Billy got shot I hope they kill his charachter cause this guys acting SUCKS!!!
@TheTalk_CBS @BBheathertom @BandB_CBS @davidtom_23 @YandR_CBS he needs acting lessons! He's horrific! I FFWD through all his scenes!
@TheTalk_CBS don't believe in sharing accounts, however in my experience if he changes his password he's hiding something.
@davidtom_23 @YRInsider @TheTalk_CBS @BBheathertom @CBSDaytime I'm sure you're nice people but you guys can't act. Sorry
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime sick of the Victor saga!
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime he needs to mind his own business. Kids are grown can make own decisions.
@SoapOperaNetwrk @BandB_CBS didn't like her 20 yrs ago, still don't. Don't like him either.
@SoapOperaNetwrk @BandB_CBS Barf!! Neither can act and he's ugly.
@KeithUrban how bout live in NC?
@AngelicaMcD @YRInsider @BBheathertom @davidtom_23 can't stand either of them!
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime is "Cassie" also Moriah?
@AmericanIdol CJ
@AmericanIdol @BriThibodeaux keep CJ
@HarryConnickJR @AmericanIdol simply don't understand some of y'all's choices this year!
@shemarmoore baby girl would like some gear that is less .... More like a normal tank and a hat or visor with a normal bill.
#idolhome she's boring.
@LaureneB82 why don't you use your real pic on your profile, does if look like baboon ass!?
@LaureneB82 you're probably single because no one can stand your fat ass and small mind
@LaureneB82 I'll bet you have no friends and your imaginary world is filled with actors who you stalk but they can't stand you
@LaureneB82 why are you taking a comment about a dumb actor so personally. You stalking the guy or banging him?
@LaureneB82 you are very immature. I'm positive I look better head to toe than you. So ashamed of your looks you don't even use your own pic
@LaureneB82 my eyebrowS are perfect thank you. Only tweekers over pluck. U on drugs?
@TheEllenShow @jessiisme Ellen u r awesome. I was mad when they ousted her now she can do her thing no Idol contracts.
@YandR_CBS these two need to team up and make sure Chloe gets her head examined by Sharon's shrink
@watroswatros @YRInsider can't wait to see this story unfold and Benji not a real Doc? What's up with that too?
@1SteveBurton @YRInsider Dillon, Adam, and Jack my favorite men on #Y&amp;R
RT @TheTalk_CBS: .@sherylunderwood on W Allen alleged sexual abuse "For the parents out there stop using ur children as pawns in adult rela‚Ä¶
@JessWaltonYR @YandR_CBS @PW54000 I love "Jill" cause she tells it like it is, no holds barred.
@LaureneB82 @camryngrimes @YRInsider @davidtom_23 doesn't change the facts
@LaureneB82 @camryngrimes @YRInsider @davidtom_23 I'm not on tv. If I wanted to see ugly people I'd just go to the mall.
@camryngrimes @YRInsider @davidtom_23 david tom is ew! Can't act and is not cute
@YRInsider @tristanrogers @JessWaltonYR the question isn't if, it's what. Next is it personal value or financial value
@TheTalk_CBS don't get much more opinionated than me!
@TheTalk_CBS @CrimMinds_CBS @CandiceKumai @CBS Shemar Moore, I had to change my baby girl panties after looking at him
@tristanrogers @YandR_CBS barf
@JessWaltonYR @YandR_CBS @davidtom_23 @CBSDaytime he's gross &amp; can't act, neither can his sister please recast again soon!!!
@YRInsider HATE the new Billy. He &amp; Vic  already super lame/boring &amp; to make it worse new guy can't act and not a looker either'
@JulieChen I have my own handcuffs... Do I get a prize?
@YRInsider @JoshuaMorrowYR Adam is alive.... YAY!! Chloe needs head examined! Always nutcase now fueled by obsession.
@shemarmoore @johnvarvatos very classy/sophisticated and sexy, love the look
RT @shemarmoore: Thank you to @johnvarvatos for dressing me on Sunday for the #Emmys http://t.co/EdUlHHKw6l
@shemarmoore Sherrod not Sherman... My bad
@shemarmoore Sherman &amp; Marilyn... now I know where your name came from. Nice!!
@sherylunderwood @matkaylen sometimes you've given all you've got &amp; when you have kids you gotta keep them away from that stuff.
@sherylunderwood me too and waiting to hear about this music box.
@kelligoss @YRInsider @rgala @CBSDaytime I saw that coming only I was expecting it to be Chavez.
@TheTalk_CBS frankly not surprised. Sad situation even thought didn't care for him. Sad when anyone throws their life away.
@CBSDaytime @YRInsider @boldinsider Adam &amp; Wyatt why? because I don't like bullies or wusses.
@BandB_CBS @CBS keep Wyatt... Caroline thinks business, not personal, listen to her. Team HopeüíóWyatt‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
@YRInsider @CBSDaytime please no body for Adam... River induced hypothermia saved him from burning to death.... Please save Adam!!!!!
@MicaMoreniqua @sherylunderwood @TheRealMikeEpps so true
@sherylunderwood @RussellWilson and more than a tag line too!!
@Budweiser @jellybeanscotty loved this and heroes welcome home!
@CJLeBlanc @YRInsider I had a feeling he wasn't dead. I could write this show. I'm hoping Adam lives!!! No body, he can come back. :)
@2WTK Village Tavern
@CJLeBlanc @YandR_CBS please keep Adam!!!  Is a Daisy Carter Tyler's ex or was she hooked up with Carmine. Could be a good plot there!
@YRInsider @MelodyThomasSco @EBraeden @CBSDaytime  please let Adam live!!!!! Please, oh please, pretty please!!!
@KeithUrban @JLo @AmericanIdol @TheEllenShow so glad you asked Jessica Bassett! Stpd what I was doin 2 listn 2 her! Remind me of NorahJones
@BandB_CBS @THEEdarinbrooks please do not put Hope back with lame ass Liam. All he's don't to her makes Wyatt look like a saint!!
@KeithUrban @JLo @AmericanIdol you should have kept Jessica Bassett. I literally stopped what I was doing when she started singing!!!
@BandB_CBS Liam is lame, obsessed, turning stalker, she needs a restraining order, he's the dangerous freak.
@YRInsider @ChristelAdnana @MishaelMorgan1 team Hilary, Lily has always been conceited but now she's an outright bitch.
@2WTK Rosa Mae's in Thomasville
@YRInsider @ChristelAdnana @MishaelMorgan1 team Hilary‚ÄºÔ∏è
@YRInsider @ChristelAdnana @MishaelMorgan1 Lilly is getting super annoying/pompous Devon and Hillary should hook up &amp; get married!!
@sherylunderwood this is too funny. http://t.co/5bkShwS68B
@sherylunderwood @RealDeanCain @lorenagarcia I'm beautiful, intelligent and fun, send him my way. üòâ
