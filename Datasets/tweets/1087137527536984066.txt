It was a pre-planned operation of revenge facilitated by a government  that put them in harm's way without adequate support and with a  bull's-eye painted on their backs.
On August 6, 2011, in the Tangi River Valley of Afghanistan, Aaron Vaughn and 30 other Americans,[3] including 15 members of SEAL Team VI[4] were killed when their fifty year old helicopter, designated Extortion 17, was hit by a rocket propelled grenade.
https://t.co/OydvPNnSVQ 3 months after Biden ID'd Seal Team VI they died.	Less than a day after Biden‚Äôs remarks Seal Team VI member Aaron Vaughn called his mother Karen:	  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs chatter and all of our lives are in danger including yours, Mom.‚Äù
Oh yeah, the parallels are striking. Because President Obama couldn‚Äôt  get the funding for the border ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù, he declared a national security  emergency and shifted funds from the Obamacare budget into the UAC  program.
President Obama and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson were rebuked by congress  when they asked for $4 billion in emergency appropriations for the  southern border.  Sound familiar?
https://t.co/XIWRegHBMX Rand Paul is out of his mind. President Trump isn‚Äôt doing anything new or unprecedented with the National Security declaration at the border.  In fact, back in July 2014 President Obama did the exact same thing.

For the first time in many decades the chief executive of the USA walked into office concerned about the fiscal stability of the  average American, without a single IOU on his Oval Office desk. For the  first time ever, a titan of American Main Street is in the oval office.
Trump‚Äôs economic policies actually  increase all American wealth. The American middle-class becomes more valuable‚Ä¶. 600,000 high-wage  manufacturing jobs are created.  The American worker becomes more  valuable.
Notice how the ‚Äòwealth gap‚Äô in the past two years is actually closing. President Trump doesn‚Äôt achieve this by redistributing a limited  amount of American economic wealth; he achieves these results by  creating even more economic pies.
Yes, Trump is the anti-elite;  not necessarily in persona (he is that also) but in actual outcome of  policy.  Notice how right now working-class wages are rising.

The new House of Representatives, in which the Democrats are the majority  now, has handed a vast amount of political ammunition to Republicans  within just a few weeks after coming to power? Moreover, they did it for  free.
The  racist scandal of the three top Democrat office holders in the state of  Virginia should have ended in 24 hours ‚Äì the governor should have  resigned.
Therefore,  the open anti-Semitism of Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar should not  surprise anybody.  It should not be a shock that the former head of the  Ku Klux Klan, David Duke endorsed them as did Valerie Jarrett.
It  was the Democrats who put U.S. citizens of Japanese descent into concentration camps during World War II.  It was the Democrats who  became famous for the systematic persecution and extermination of North American Indians.  It was the Democrats who were the party of slavery!
It  was the Democratic Administration of President Roosevelt that turned  away a ship with Jewish refugees in 1939.  A vital role in the refusal  of Jewish refugees to go ashore in America was played by Democrat Secretary of  State Cordell Hull...

@designs_donn @Lwbayfront @repgregharris What about Obama's trillion dollar  faux "stimulus" where the whole trillion dollars was completely squandered in just months. Hundreds of millions to green companies whose CEOs paid themselves millions in bonuses out of it then every single company filed bankruptcy.
@designs_donn @repgregharris GDP growth averaged a pathetic 2% under Obama, barely over half of what Trump has. Obama was easily the most corrupt and horrible POTUS in our nation's history. Its not even close!
@designs_donn @repgregharris Obama DELIBERATELY destroyed our vital mfg base. He declared those jobs "gone forever" in 2015 saying he had no "magic wand" to restore them. Trump rolled back all his job killing regs and back they came! We have the best economy in 50 yrs thanks to TRUMP!

@designs_donn @Lwbayfront @repgregharris Trump beats Clinton by more than 2-to-1 when California and New York are excluded. Even if the votes of the seven faithless electors were given to Clinton, Trump would still have trounced Clinton by more than 2-1 in the 48 states of ‚Äúreal America.‚Äù

Trump  didn‚Äôt get any electoral votes in California and New York, when we  subtract the electoral votes of those two states, Clinton won just 143  electoral votes in the rest of the nation while Trump‚Äôs electoral total  remains unchanged at 304.
