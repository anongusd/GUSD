Whitney Houston at her best could make Mary Had a Little Lamb a hit.
Whitney is an icon. Her faults don't change that.
we loved her and was so proud of her, to watch who she became...you just wanted to look away..
Whitney Houston created the soundtrack of my formative years. How many times have we shamelessly belted out one of her hits?

@B_Spotless based on some people I know, it may not be that antiquated.(Unfortunately)
@B_Spotless because "the past" with women is typically a deterrent or a blemish in your life. Drake makes having "a past" valued.
