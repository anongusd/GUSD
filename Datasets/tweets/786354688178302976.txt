@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo And public lawsuits with him accused of rape by actual real women that had to go back into hidings because of his goons death threats. Because Trump has talked about little girls sexually on tape. If he was a dem it would be more than enough for you hypocrite
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo So he can walk in on your teenage daughter? Ok pal there is no saving you and I‚Äôm done with the charity of the week trying to wake up a MAGA before it‚Äôs too late.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo I hate Bill Clinton, if there is any justice him Epstein and Trump would share a cell. Rapist are rapist regardless of Party and I am not indoctrinated into any cult. I put no god or man on a pedestal above criticism or suspicion.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo Mueller is handing off evidence of many crimes to other districts like his job is to. If Trump actually human trafficed young girls with Russia then that may stay under Mueller. Otherwise it‚Äôs prosecutors in NY or Florida, if Trump doesn‚Äôt get someone to make it go away again.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo Obama taking a picture with Jesse Smollet determines who he is apparently but Trump being surrounded by criminals and pervs doesn‚Äôt, walking in on pageant girls doesn‚Äôt, cheating on everyone and seeing women as sperm dumpsters to be rated 1-10 makes Trump a great guy apparently
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo If he was a dem or literal any other republicans you would have connected the gigantic obvious dots already. But you can‚Äôt because you are a cult member.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo Trump talked about him in positive way, true on freaking video tape. Trump named in lawsuits accused of raping teenage girls, true in fucking public documents. Trump actually hung out with Epstein not just handshake they were BFFs. If he was a dem, you would be on my side.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 @Enzo It is reality! It happened you just call those women liars. I bet you think Epstein didn‚Äôt do anything either, what a sick fucking cult you are in. Wake up before it‚Äôs too damn late
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 He was named in a lawsuit by some of Epstein accusers, he talked about him in a positive way even after the conviction, he makes jokes about dating little girls soon. What would you do if a grown man looked at your 12 year old and said he would be dating her in a few years?
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 He can cure cancer it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to be ok with him raping a child. Being President when unemployed was going down already is a weak excuse to back a pedo.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 I would rather be a socialist then a pedophile apologist like you. Acosta got that spot for a reason. For the great deal he gave Epstein and his unnamed co conspirators = TRUMP. It‚Äôs going to be our country‚Äôs biggest shame and you love him.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 Putin has dirty on Trump and he‚Äôs allowed to have private meetings with no other Americans around coming out of meetings looking like a spanked dog. He‚Äôs a national security emergency and you don‚Äôt care as long as he ‚Äúowns the libs‚Äù what an un American POS
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 Hypocrisy? You only care about someone‚Äôs murder when‚Äôs it‚Äôs commited by immigrants, you only care about sexual assault victims when it‚Äôs commited by a Democrat. Your the hypocrite and a cult member it‚Äôs sad and sick. Weiner, Clinton, Trump fuck all pedophiles regardless of Party.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 Taking a picture does not equal friends. Trump is FRIENDS with scum. Because he surrounds himself with scum. Because he is scum.
@DavisFletch @elguapo64 Did Weiner and Hillary hang out with each other or just take a photo? Because Trump and Epstein are friends for years. Epstein was a member of Maralago, they partied all the time. With young teenage girls and I hope you are ashamed when you figure it out.

@DavisFletch @MMFlint Your cult devotion makes you blind to the obvious. Trump, Clinton, Epstein cut from the same cloth. He was accused by one of Epstein‚Äôs victims during the election, she had to drop the case because his thugs posted her address and she had to go into hiding. Muellers got it though.
@DavisFletch @MMFlint I‚Äôm not an extremist, I am a patriot, party doesn‚Äôt matter. Bill, Obama, Hillary, Bernie, they can all rot in jail if they do illegal shit especially crimes against children. From one patriot to another you should at least dial down the cult 45 shit until after Trump is cleared.
@DavisFletch @MMFlint Do you want to explain to me then why a convicted pedophile billionaire invoked the 5th when asked specifically about being with Trump and Bill around the presence of underage girls? You need to wake the hell up, it‚Äôs not going to end well.
@DavisFletch @MMFlint Bill Clinton is a rapist, he too was BFFs with Epstein. Epstein used the 5th when asked about his relationship with Bill as well. Party doesn‚Äôt matter, rich or poor doesn‚Äôt matter, a pedophile is a pedophile and they deserve punishment.
@DavisFletch @MMFlint When have I called for violence? Never, I am fully aware and absolutely disgusted by people on my side committing or threatening violence. Being aware and pointing out our President was BFFs with a convicted pedophile is not being extremist.

@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo If it does not have a developed brain, nervous system, and possibility to live on its own without another body sustaining it, it isn‚Äôt not the same. Fetus inside a body does not equal born baby.
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo I got it, I am all caught up. To you a fetus with no self awareness is greater and more important then a living breathing women that can feel pain and fear, with hopes, dreams, and a desire to control her own body.
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo That was your mothers choice and good for her for making it, but that was up to her I hope.

@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo *Aborting fetuses. Not at all the same as murdering a living breathing child that is self aware, can feel pain and experience fear. Cray Cray
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @8BigNasty @gettinnoticedmo Abortion will be staying legal, we aren‚Äôt going back to the dark age back alley abortions.
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo So if they are over crowded, overburdened, under funded, we should just keep piling up more unwanted babies into the system? The logic you have is insane, let me guess you hate abortion because of your religious beliefs?
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @br0k3nhaloV2 @Pete_Geller @gettinnoticedmo How many babies have you adopted?
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @gettinnoticedmo You don‚Äôt care about real life! You want to keep women subservient broodmares and thats it. You don‚Äôt care about the hungry, you don‚Äôt care about the sick or the poor, no! In fact you want to add to the suffering, you are anti life!
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @gettinnoticedmo It‚Äôs a fetus dude, it doesn‚Äôt have self awareness in the first few weeks after conception, which is when the vast majority happen because they don‚Äôt want a baby. Again, when it happens late, the woman wanted the baby, but something terrible happened and it‚Äôs a risk to her life.
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @gettinnoticedmo Like the hundreds of thousands and millions worldwide already waiting for adoption? BC fails and you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to carry your rapist baby for freakin 9 months. Pregnancy is hard and it has serious risk, and it‚Äôs the host, the woman‚Äôs choice to keep a fetus to not.
@DWC__II_I_MCMXC @gettinnoticedmo Or give your mommy a pill so she had a period, but you go ahead and spread fear mongering BS. Women don‚Äôt sit around and wait to have an abortion for fun, if it happens late it 99.9999 percent because of a medical issue, banning it get mothers killed.
