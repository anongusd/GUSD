@TomCottonAR Today a father and a husband was deported from the only home and country he has known since he was about 11? years old. Are you @TomCottonAR telling me that people in WV, IN, MO, ND &amp; MT are okay with this?
@SenBooker what say you? https://t.co/RYEQTGOj6I
@ddale8 And this is important why?
I cry when I read these horrible  stories, these are our neighbors our friends, our children		Why is our government tearing families apart to deport people with no criminal record? https://t.co/1a67cdVQGe
@SpeakerRyan No. They're not crumbs they are blackmail for a huge Medicare and Medicaid cut. All social services are now at great risk, which is your goal. You threw pennies at the crowd so 1% eat an even bigger cake 🍰

@uvasimmons6 @CriticalLiberty @NinoColarossi @DineshDSouza I didn't say I was Christian I said I was Atheist. My kids went to good Catholic schools. They decided their own faith.
@uvasimmons6 @CriticalLiberty @NinoColarossi @DineshDSouza God? Its the same biology as chickens and we eat them. The immaturity of it all is shocking to me and dangerous. Making stupid political decisions based on evangelical warblings and blowing people up based on the Koran, or separate neighborhoods based on Hebrew scripture, please

@WHCommHopeHicks My father worked for Trump as an independent glazier in the 70s. He was the best of the best. Worked 2 jobs for years as a NYC Firefighter and a glacier. Your boss "stiffed" him as my Dad would call it. He died at 63 and your boss couldn't lick his shoes
@WHCommHopeHicks Think much yourself? I imagine you would have to in that crowd
@CriticalLiberty @uvasimmons6 @NinoColarossi @DineshDSouza You are the one that's willfully blind. The credit is unnecessary the preservation of is.

@CriticalLiberty @uvasimmons6 @NinoColarossi @DineshDSouza I love that answer. Not once my friend at the top of Mountains in the aisles of theatre in the birth of an angel (Yes I love angels and dragons) or the eyes if my beloved have I felt a God
