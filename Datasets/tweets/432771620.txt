Yet another example of putting corporate interests ahead of students. The Dept of Ed is supposed to be protecting students. Instead, it's declared open season for bad actors to prey on those seeking an opportunity to get a degree to realize their dreams.		https://t.co/roWqwQ7byr
In the summer months, millions of children lose access to free or reduced-price meals they get at school. I introduced legislation with @PattyMurray to #StopSummerHunger. This will be good for our kids, good for education, and good for our economy. 	https://t.co/lL9ExyOdIs https://t.co/BbIhZvnaYq

Trump’s decision is more about protecting himself than protecting the rights of people to determine their own health and economic future. #WhatsAtStake 		https://t.co/P4q0FYzgKK
Leader McConnell should apply his own rule to this nominee and allow the American people to have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #WhatsAtStake 		https://t.co/LYCyfcVXsV
Trump promised to drain the swamp and should have fired Pruitt a long time ago. Instead, he was allowed to rack up ethics violation after ethics violation. His record on the environment is even worse. His replacement should know that we will fight this assault on the environment.
@LeonardoVaneg17 Welcome to DC!  You can get Gallery passes at my office in 1214 Longworth. Office will be open at 9 AM on Thursday.

I voted NO with 300 of my colleagues on the GOP immigration bill which would waste taxpayer dollars on building a wall and would not reunite separated families or provide real solutions for #Dreamers.		https://t.co/NUrIl8CIKu
The future of our democracy is on the line in the appointment of the next Supreme Court justice. As Leader McConnell has stated: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.” We have the benefit of an election in 132 days.
Disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. As a former school board member, I saw firsthand that everyone who is represented in their workplace by a negotiating process enjoys the benefits of union leadership. #JANUSvsAFSCME 		https://t.co/l5zghexL2p
The Supreme Court failed the American people today. We look to our courts to uphold our constitution and the ideal of equality. No one should be treated differently based on their country of origin. #NoMuslimBanEver 		https://t.co/uba5HZKa35

Enjoyed thoughtful Q and A with the Aaron Price Fellows today.  Great questions! We talked mostly about how Congress really works, how young people can make a difference and about current border issues. https://t.co/Wor4HALsQ8
When we should be reuniting children separated from their families, the GOP immigration bills spend billions of dollars on a wall &amp; don't protect Dreamers or asylum-seeking families. Voting NO on both bills. Speaker Ryan needs to work on a bipartisan &amp; humane immigration bill.
Since thousands of children are still detained and separated from their families, the Administration owes it to the American people to tell us exactly how and when they plan to reunite them. #KeepFamliesTogether 		https://t.co/1hIRg28kto
In a time when our refugee and immigrant communities are under attack by this administration, we have to remember that they are here contributing to the fabric of our country and to the economic stability of our nation. I stand #WithRefugees. https://t.co/vD9YCRtP4d
Since this administration refuses to treat families humanely, Congress must step up and do the right thing. I am cosponsoring the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct in the House which would prevent migrant families from being ripped apart.
While we celebrate #Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery in America, the struggle for equality and justice continues. We will not relent in our work to preserve and protect freedom. https://t.co/zisfI5Fnsw

America should have a zero tolerance policy for the immoral treatment of children. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/uMNutc9yab

The end of #NetNeutrality will hurt consumers and small businesses. Congress needs to overturn the FCC's ruling which lets Internet Service Providers decide what websites you can access and whether they want to charge you more for that access. https://t.co/WDozXIWZzX
I pressed Secretary DeVos on whether she is committing enough resources to protect teachers in this program. I will be following up with the Department of Education to make sure it is keeping its promise to these teachers.		https://t.co/fsIJKPmfbw
HHS needs to look at their policies and make sure they are doing all they can to keep children safe. This administration also needs to stop the inhumane practice of separating families at the border. We need to protect families, not separate them.		https://t.co/A4tUpPkMc0
@SUHSD @Zer0C00LQ Good news! Thanks so much for rectifying this.
Tax cuts don't pay for themselves. The GOP/Trump Tax Scheme is projected to create deficits that will hit $1 trillion. The Bush tax cuts, which I also opposed, turned a budget surplus into massive deficits. How is this fiscal responsibility?		https://t.co/TYHvUYclIJ

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Secretary doesn’t know how many people on her staff are working on this important issue. #DeVosHearing 	https://t.co/Heq0iBCGTd
Thank you for your thoughtful suggested questions for Secretary DeVos! I wish I could have asked them all but I will submit them to her to answer for the record. I focused on getting justice for students who have been defrauded by predatory for-profit schools.
After almost 2 years in office, Secretary DeVos will appear before the Ed &amp; Workforce Comm tomorrow. What would you like me to ask her? Can't promise I'll use your question as I'll only have 5 min but will do my best to get real answers about the direction of our public schools. https://t.co/U3TiuuuZrU
The partisan #FarmBill did not reflect the priorities of the American people. It represented the priorities of the extreme elements of the Republican party, who killed their own bill because of their demand for a vote on an inhumane anti-immigration bill.		https://t.co/XiHEJrQnz5
I call on the Speaker to bring to the floor a range of protections for our citizens.
My profound sadness and support goes out to the loved ones of yet another unspeakable tragedy. We have enough experience to move forward and deal with this honestly. We can and we must stop gun violence through our laws and community services.
Had the distinct honor of recognizing the incredible achievements of Chief Kristina Koch-the Navy honoree for the Women's Memorial Wreath Laying Ceremony. The event recognizes female servicemembers past &amp; present, esp those women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/Bum0xD6fXC
Voting NO on the GOP’s partisan #FarmBill. It cuts $23B from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that puts food on many families' tables. These cuts will hurt children, seniors, veterans, servicemembers, people with disabilities &amp; working families. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/KROXR0ghhn

California is home to about 10 million immigrants who have helped our state become the 6th largest economy in the world and achieve historically low crime rates.
