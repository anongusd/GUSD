Here's why rural Republicans should back @NancyPelosi for Speaker. If they did the deal we propose here, it would be win-win for both sides. https://t.co/m2Q45NSVgT
@charleslustig1 @jmartNYT The big vote out in VA 07 is in Chesterfield County, where D's running strong. Chesterfield has more precincts posted on its county website than the SBE site is showing, so SBE is lagging indicator there.
@brockter Keep in mind, of course, that ALL election night #s are unofficial. There'll be a post-election canvass and then the SBE officially certifies results weeks from now. We just like all the #s in one place so we don't have to do math on deadline.
This may explain why Chesterfield County numbers from VA-7 are not on the State Board of Elections website yet. Chesterfield is key locality in that district. https://t.co/mFf4BXChpP
@brockter They are not posted on the State Board of Elections website, which is where most people look to get #s. They are, however, on Chesterfield County's website. Not sure why there's not on the SBE site right away that but sometimes happens.
VA-7: Good chance that Spanberger (D) knocks off Brat (R). Brat leads on SBE returns but no votes in from Chesterfield. However, Chesterfield is posting #s on its website and she's getting big margin there that would overtake Brat: https://t.co/GDSGjwvtuJ #Electionnight
VA-7: Spanberger (D) now leads Brat (R) narrowly. Key point: No votes yet from Chesterfield Co, a big suburban locality that once used to be Republican stronghold but last year voted Democratic. Chesterfield is key. #electionnight
VA-7: Spanberger (D) leads over Brat (R) but Democrats should not get excited yet. Big chunk of those votes are from Henrico Co, a D stronghold. Many rural areas (R), and Chesterfield Co. (realigning) yet to be heard from. #electionnight
VA-5: First returns from Albemarle Co. show Cockburn (D) outpacing Clinton 2016 margins, but question is whether it's enough when other parts of district going strong for Riggleman (R).
Reading a lot into a little: In VA-7, looking at Henrico Co, where Spanberger (D) needs to win big if she's to win. In first returns there, she is running ahead of Clinton 2016, when Clinton took 57% there. FWIW.
Reading a lot into a little. In VA-5, paying close attention to Fauquier Co. Trump 2016 county where Cockburn (D) would need to make in-roads. 1st precinct there: Riggleman (R) matching Trump percentage. FWIW.
In Virginia, we now have our first six precincts in. 6 precincts of 2567 (0.23%) reporting

@elizabethcatte @onesarahjones @roanoketimes I know! Sorry I missed your talk at Tech. Didn't realize it was happening until after the fact, or I'd have been there. I hear it's a great counterpoint to "Hillbilly Elegy," which seems to perpetuate stereotypes.
@onesarahjones @roanoketimes We shouldn't want any exploitative industry, period. But we do need high-growth, high-wage jobs and are doing some fascinating things to grow them / attract them. Probably not enough, to be sure, but a start is a start...
@onesarahjones @roanoketimes Everywhere? Is anything popular everywhere? But I'd bet in its favor. While I work in Roanoke, I live in a rural area outside Roanoke. In the past year I'd reckon I've been to almost every locality in SWVA -- not quite 100% but close.
@onesarahjones @elizabethcatte @roanoketimes Don't mean to be lecturing anyone but trying to get the word out to a larger audience.

Four years ago, McAuliffe took Loudoun Co by 3,905 votes. With one precinct still out, Northam leads by 15,231. This #vagov race is over, folks. Northam will win.
Early returns from NoVA showing Northam running well ahead of McAuliffe's % four years ago. in 2013, McA took 71.5% in Arlington; so far Northam taking 78% there. #vagov
Chesterfield Co. 98% complete in #vagov: Gillespie leads 49.9 to 48.9, margin of 587. Four years ago, Cuccinelli carried that Richmond suburb by 8,249. Not a good sign for R's.
Don't want to read too much into too little but we have our 1st Alexandria precinct in. Four years ago, McAuliffe won city with 72%; Northam takes this first precinct with 82%.
With 1 of 13 precincts in, "Yes" leads 404-292 in Pulaski County school bond referendum.
Potentially significant: W/38% of Prince William Co in, Northam has 8,327 vote lead there. Four years ago, McAuliffe won county by 8,010. Gillespie could obviously cut that lead down as other 62% comes in but still .. #vagov

So far nothing unusual ...altho Prince William Co is starting to come in exceptionally early and that's a huge bellwether. Keep your eyes on that in #vagov
Northam wins Manassas City absentees: 582-505. Four years ago, Cuccinelli (R) won absentees there 211-201. Obviously much bigger absentee turnout in #vagov this year.
First precinct to report in #vagov is Smyth Co absentees. Gillespie 172-85. Four years ago, Cuccinelli (R) took absentees 153-99.
First precinct to report is from Smyth Co., unclear which one. Gillespie 172-85, about same % by which Cuccinelli carried Smyth in 2013. Need to know more to draw conclusions. #vagov

RT @brithume: Trump wins VA!, Fox News projects.
RT @JoeNBC: If Trump pulls off wins in Virginia and Oklahoma, tonight will be an unqualified success for his campaign. #SuperTuesday
Rubio has underperformed in Hampton Roads. Lost Va Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk. Not good for his cause. #supertuesday
@JasonLong06 If Kasich were out, where would those votes go? Demography suggests Rubio.
Another view: Trump leads Rubio by 29,594. Can Rubio make up that margin in NoVa, which is still (mostly) out but starting to come in?
67% in: Rubio narrows gap. Trump 35.79% Rubio 31.3%. Most of  vote still out is from Nova, where Rubio winning, so likely will get tighter.
RT @EJDionne: Huge GOP gender gap in #Alabama.	#Trump gets 54% among men but only 37% among women.
60% in: Trump 36.7%, Rubio 30%, Cruz 16.9%, Kasich 8%. Kasich is going to cost Rubio a win in Virginia. #supertuesday.
In massive Fairfax County, 13% in: Rubio 38.7%, Trump 25%. Rubio probably needs bigger margin to offset downstate. #supertuesday
Rubio will likely spin close Virginia race as sign of strength, point to delegates won. But at some point, you gotta win. #supertuesday
Final #s in Chesterfield, key Richmond suburb: Trump 39.7% Rubio 28.75%.
Doesn't look like Rubio getting suburban #s he needs, at least in downstate suburbs. Losing Virginia Beach, Chesapeake to Trump.
RT @NBCNews: LATEST: The Vermont GOP primary is too close to call. See full results here: https://t.co/87pd2Cjcc5 #SuperTuesday #Decision20…
RT @randymarcus: @MattCobb3 @jtuckermartin I think Trump will win by 2pts or so. Rubio needed to win in VB, which he won't.
RT @jtuckermartin: Again, Randy knows his stuff like no one else. I don't like it, but he can call a race damn well https://t.co/l8LP8GaaKF

Key: Trump is winning Virginia Beach. That's locality Rubio needed. 83% in: Trump 38% Rubio 30% #supertuesday
RT @Nate_Cohn: We currently have Trump plus-3 in Virginia (based on slow AP data) https://t.co/fmqF24nDJq
In 9thCD (rural SW), Trump 50%, Rubio 19%. More than half in. But in 11th CD(Nova), Rubio 39% Trump 24.64% Only about 6% of that CD in.
45.6% in: Trump 36.9%, Rubio 30.2%. But very little of NoVa in (Rubio territory). Too declare to declare. Remember Allen-Webb 2006.
RT @HowardKurtz: Fox calls AL and MA for Trump. Talk about winning very diverse states
In Roanoke, Rubio wins affluent Lee-Hi and Deyerle precincts, but not by that much. He needed to win there by more. #supertuesday
39% in: Trump 37% Rubio 30.5%. But those returns weighted toward rural Southside and Southwest (Trump big). Very little of NoVa in yet.
RT @Redistrict: At this rate, there is a small chance Rubio could pull off a huge Virginia upset, *IF* Fairfax County comes through for him.
RT @DKElections: 34% of VA in and Trump leads Rubio 36-32. Little of NOVA in: If Rubio kills there, he can take state #SuperTuesday
1st Prince William returns show tight race; Trump's state chairman heads Bd of Supes there. Hmmm. #supertuesday
RT @PoliticoScott: Drawing conclusions from scattered, incomplete precinct counts is like watching a football game recut in random order
If you want raw #s, go to State Board of Elections; SBE far ahead of CNN. SBE has 30% in, CNN says only 2%
RT @DKElections: 57% of VA Beach in and Rubio beating Trump 41-34 in major Hampton Roads county. Good sign for Rubio statewide #SuperTuesday
Rubio narrows gap. W/30% in: Trump 36.5%, Rubio 31.62%. This could get interesting as Nova comes in. First #s are mostly rural (Trump) areas
33% of Alexandria: Rubio 46% Kasich 25% Trump 19.6%. kasich is going to hurt Rubio in NoVa. #supertuesday
Starting to get some Nova #s! Rubio big there, but is he winning by enough to offset Trump margins elsewhere? #supertuesday
Chesterfield is 1st suburb completely in: Rubio 34.96, Trump 33.48. Rubio probably needed bigger margin there.
Still some mountain-valley Republicans out there: Rubio leads (barely) in early returns from Roanoke, Rockbridge County, Staunton.
1st Roanoke precinct reports: Affluent South Roanoke goes heavy for Rubio 275- Trump 182. Cruz 79.
We're going by the SBE site for official #s: 13.57% reporting: Trump 38.68%, Rubio 28.96%, Cruz 17.7%. Virtually all from rural(Trump) areas
That weird Clarke County precinct is now updated. Guess we caught it in the process of being updated. Weird.
Virginia returns mostly from scattered rural areas, all big Trump places. But 1st reports from suburban precincts not good for Rubio.
@_wmgalliher @marcorubio Northern Virginia will report last. Mostly scattered returns from rural areas so far. Big Trump territory.
Can this be right? SBE shows 1 precinct in Clarke County: Rubio 100 votes, everybody else 0. Really? #supertuesday
CNN has exit poll data on Virginia #supertuesday: https://t.co/ZDWL0p8S1w
CNN shows Trump leading Rubio in early returns from Chesterfield; key suburb Rubio needs to win. Not good for Rubio. #supertuesday
Bellwether? Early returns show Trump-Rubio tied in Fauquier, in NoVa exurbs. That's place Rubio needs to win, not tie. #supertuesday
That means Trump will jump to early lead; Rubio has to catch him, if he can, as Northern Virginia comes in later tonight. #supertuesday
Here's thing to know about Virginia #supertuesday. First localities 2 report always rural areas; big Trump territory. NoVa reports last.
CNN shows close race in Virginia, but unclear where their #s are from. State Board of Elections site shows Trump leading, 40% to Rubio 27%

@peggifisher @tennant_lisa . . .he allows plaintiffs to refile those counts w/amended language 2 address his legal concerns.
@peggifisher @tennant_lisa Also of note: Judge could have dismissed Counts 1&amp;2 w/prejudice, meaning they couldn't come back. Instead . . .
@tennant_lisa So, yes, significant that he let it go forward. The fight to #savesweetbriar continues on 3 fronts: alumnae, students, faculty
@tennant_lisa Think of it this way: If Updike had dismissed the case today, the faculty lawsuit would be over (well, aside from appeals).
@peggifisher @tennant_lisa . . . the core of the case goes forward; plaintiffs will get to argue there was no financial exigency. That's key
@peggifisher @tennant_lisa Judge gave plaintiffs 21 days to refile those 2 counts to address his legal quibbles. However, the key thing is..
@peggifisher @tennant_lisa Judge had legal quibbles w/counts 1 &amp;2 and their request for a declaratory judgement; whether that was possible.

I think our work here tonight is done. Our editorial on the results will post at 2:15 a.m. at http://t.co/KOD71u4MQl #VaSen #swvaelex
@nytimes now has Warner up by 8,883 votes with 99% reporting. #VaSen #Swvalex
Big difference between @vpapupdates  that shows Gillespie up and @nytimes that has Warner up: NYT has 100% of Fairfax in. #VaSen #swvaelex
@nytimes has corrected its map. Now shows Warner up 3,422 with 1% still out. #VaSen #swvaelex
@ConveConfu Read our editorial in the morning! Short version: Big R year and Warner never as secure as many thought. Virginia very purple.
@AllenMears @nytimes has Libertarian Sarvis winning King George. That's not what @vpapupdates shows. Numbers are transposed.
@nytimes now says Mark Warner leads by 2,435 votes with 99% reporting. #VaSen #swvaelex But King George #s still wrong.
Fairfax site shows Warner w/ 47,994 lead w/o absentees; D activist tweets  absentees put W to 53k. That wld put W up: http://t.co/zHEVBskRMR
RT @thudfactor: @RTeditorial This is @notlarrysabato’s source: http://t.co/D8zRa6OmBK
Democratic activist tweets final Fairfax numbers give Warner 53K margin in that county; that would put him ahead, if true. #VaSen #swvaelex
Remember that in 2006, Webb (D)  took 3,066 margin in Arlington absentees alone. Arlington absentees still out tonight. #VaSen #Swvaelex
Could this come down to Craig? VPAP has Gillespie w/ 424 lead but some D vote in FairfaxCo out; but 0 votes from Craig. #VaSen #swvaelex
@nytimes has more of vote in than @vpapupdates and w/ bigger Gillespie lead but @nytimes figures for King George are wrong. #Vasen #swvaelex
114 precincts out in tight #VaSen, at least 67 in heavy D areas, at least 24 in heavy R (but 11 of those are tiny Craig). #swvaelex
With 114 precincts out in #VaSen, Gillespie lead shrinks to 424 votes. 67 of those precincts in Fairfax Co, going heavy Warner. #swvaelex
In #VaSen, 220 precincts -- 123 of those are in heavy D localities. Can Warner make up 18,647 there? Gonna be close. #swvaelex
220 precincts out in #VaSen: 95 of those in Fairfax, which is heavy D. #Swvaelex
RT @ChapPetersen: Looking like Recount City in the U.S. Senate race.  Mark needs NOVA absentees to nose ahead but not all votes are in ...
VPAP has 91% in; Gillespie leads by 18,647; Warner could make that up in what's out in Fairfax County but gonna be close in #VaSen #swvaelex
Only 47% of Fairfax Co in; Warner has 21,193 margin there. Down by 22,471 statewide. So he could make up the difference. #VaSen #swvaelex
@nytimes has 90% of vote in, with Gillespie up by 22,471, but most of Fairfax County (Warner) still out. Gonna be close. #vaSen #swvaelex
#VaSen reminds me of Allen/Webb in 2006 in reverse; Allen led most of night, then Webb snuck as NoVa reported. Warner hoping for same now.
Based on precincts still out in #VaSen, Warner has advantage, because most are in heavy D areas. But gonna be a squeaker. #swvaelex
In #VaSen, at least 43% of the precincts out are in heavy D areas, all populous. Main R's out are 62 precincts (15%) in Va Beach. #swvaelex
Significant in #VaSen: 412 precincts out: 127  in Fairfax Co, 30 in Portsmouth, 16 in Norfolk, 4 Richmond, 3 Arlington -- all heavy D.
Most of Loudoun &amp; Prince Wm now in; race tightening. Focus shifts to Fairfax: More than half of D-leaning county still out. #VaSen #swvaelex
RT @RTDNEWS: #VASen race turning into real nail-biter. @EdWGillespie 49%, @MarkWarner 48% w/84% reporting. http://t.co/ZufrOqj1wL #rva #vag…
Prince Wm tightening but G still ahead slightly; Obama won there by 16% in '12. That could be the election right there. #VaSen #swvaelex
Significant: Norfolk now coming in, Warner 3% behind Obama '12. Possible upset taking shape? #VaSen #swvaelex
RT @zcrizer: @RTeditorial @roanoketimes FYI, @nytimes and @politico have direct feeds from state board. Those are at 76 percent. http://t.c…
Significant: VaBeach now reporting, and Gillespie 3% ahead of Romney '12. Very good sign for R's. #VaSen #swvaelex
If Warner loses #VaSen, it'll be because he ran slightly behind Obama '12 in NoVa; did Obama set impossible standard there? #swvaelex
Downstate #s in #VaSen generally match 2012. But in NoVa, Warner running behind Obama '12. That's the key. #VaSen #swvaelex
RT @RTDPolitics: RT @RTDNEWS: UPDATE; The latest look at the #VA Senate race. http://t.co/CWLk60ZuFu http://t.co/SaFeXEAQDq
Warner runs 4% behind Obama '12 in Fredericksburg. Not good for him. #VaSen #swvaelex
We've been stuck at 62.7% of  vote in for awhile now. Gillespie ahead, but not conclusively. Awaiting most of NoVa, others. #VaSen #swvaelex
RT @NBC29: State Board of Elections site is experiencing problems, sending people to Politico and VPAP for updated numbers.
@wolztrey Also Loudoun and Prince William. Obama carried both. Gillespie ahead in both, but many votes still out. Nova the key. #VaSen
RT @MSchmidtRTD: Folks are getting slightly nervous here at Warner event, waiting for the wave of Fairfax votes to push the senator over th…
Counter: 0 votes from Hanover (heavy R) and Va Beach (trends R). All big places. But Loudoun and Prince Wm remain key. #VaSen #swvaelex
We say again: Still 0 votes from Portsmouth (heavy D), and most of Norfolk and Petersburg (also heavy D). More . . #VaSen #swvaelex
Warner running 2 points behind Obama '12 in Fairfax County. If he loses #VaSen, it'll be because he didn't do as well in Nova. #swvaelex
For my money, key remains Loudoun and Prince William. Obama won both; Gillespie leads now but most votes still out there. #vasen #swvaelex
Notable: Norfolk: Only 18 of 50 in; Fairfax County 61 of 293. All heavily D. So looks like more D votes out than R votes in #VaSen #swvaelex
Still 0 votes from Portsmouth (heavily D), Hanover (heavily R), Va Beach (leans R). Petersburg (heavily D) just now coming. #VaSen #swvaelex
Gillespie leads in Loudon and Prince Wm, 2 counties Obama won. But is he leading by enough? Unclear. #VaSen #swvaelex
Significant: Obama won Chespeake 49.8-48.8. Gillespie ahead 49.0-48.8. A flip but not enough  unless surprises in NoVa. #VaSen #swvalex

Staunton went Obama 51, Romney 47. Tonight: Gillespie 48.8, Warner 48.2. Gillespie needs to do better, especially in NoVa; #vaSen #swvaelex
0 votes in from Portsmouth and Petersburg, both heavy D's; 0 from Va. Beach, leans R. #VaSen #swvaelex
Keep eyes on Chesapeake, Loudoun Co, Prince Wm Co. in #VaSen; Gillespie leads all 3 but most votes still out; Obama won all three. #swvaelex
Danville is complete in #VaSen. Warner 57%, but Obama had 60%. Important? Unclear. Key remains Northern Va. #swvaelex
In #VaSen, the big votes are still out in D-leaning areas -- Northern Virginia, and Portsmouth. Big R area out is Virginia Beach. #swvaelex
In Republican South Roanoke 1, Gillespie runs 6 points behind Romney '12. Not what he needs. #VaSen #swvaelex
In #VaSen, biggest chunks of votes are still out in places that usually go Democratic. So early returns for Gillespie misleading. #Swvaelex
Question of night for #VaSen: Downstate localities are being predictable; will populous Northern Va follow suit or not? #swvaelex
Montgomery County another of our 7 places to watch. 3 precincts in; Warner slightly ahead of Obama '12: #VaSen #swvaelex
Radford was our top bellwether; Warner running ahead of Obama '12 numbers there: #VaSen #swvaelex

Ace of Spades site calls #VaSen for Warner: http://t.co/fmGIEKkUM0 We'll wait #s here. #swvaelex
This much is certain: Far SWVa now thoroughly realigned to R's. Warner running poorly there, tho better than Obama '12. #VaSen #swvaelex.
Best #s are on http://t.co/DSVvIZ25BE but it's locked up now. Thing to look at: How Gillespie runs vs. Romney '12. Needs to top that. #VaSen
Chespeake was one of our 7 places to watch. Gillespie leads, but  partial returns, and he's running below Romney '12 #VaSen #swvaelex
Pay more attention to NorthernVirginia. Gillespie runs even with Romney 12 in many places downstate; can he gain in NoVa? #VaSen #swvaelex
Only 2 precincts in from blue Fairfax County: Warner ahead of Obama '12 in one, behind in another. #VaSen #swvaelex
One-third of suburban Roanoke County in; numbers almost even with '12; Gillespie will need to do better. #VaSen #swvaelex
Only one precinct in from Prince William Co; Gillespie 6 points ahead of Romney '12. That's what R's want to see more of. #VaSen #swvaelex
Notable: Gillespie (R) leads in bellwether Loudoun Co, but only 3 precincts in and they're matching '12, so too early: #VaSen #swvaelex
Roanoke's Raleigh Court 4: Romney won in '12, but Warner wins there now. Most places are matching the '12 numbers. #vasen #swvaelex
http://t.co/DSWh00ImsB now has the best numbers. Gillespie ahead but still running at or slightly behind Romney '12 numbers. #swvaelex
CNN has numbers others don't from #VaSen. Gillespie ahead but in most localities running at or behind Romney '12. #swvaelex
50 of 74 in Chesterfield: Gillespie leads but 1% behind Romney '12. If that duplicates elsewhere Warner will win narrowly. #VaSen #swvaelex
Big winner so far: Localities that are posting election results before State Board of Elections does. #VaSen #swvaelex
More than half of Chesterfield County in; Gillespie ahead but running even with Romney '12; that's not enough. #VaSen #Swvaelex.
Chesterfield County numbers coming from county's website, not state board. County has very good website. Kudos. #VaSen #Swvaelex
Contrary to usual, 1st returns coming from suburban Chesterfield County. Gillespie (R) matching Romney '12. Not enough. #Vasen #swvaelex
In Chesterfield County, Gillespie (R) running about even with Romney in '12 in early returns; he'll need to do better. #VaSen #swvaelex
Virginia Board of Elections website already running slow. And we wouldn't even expect results yet in #VaSen #swvaelex
Keep in mind, the first results in #VaSen will come from rural area, i.e., Republican ones. #swvaelex
