If we actually want to crack down on #Iran, the best path forward is to stick with the #IranDeal &amp; strictly enforce it.
Saying we‚Äôre going to tear up #JCPOA sounds like tough talk, but wouldn‚Äôt help us hold #Tehran accountable.
We must work w/allies &amp; partners on a shared agenda that holds #Iran accountable. Pulling out divides us from allies &amp; undermines agenda
Unless we see solid evidence that #Iran is cheating under the #JCPOA, we must live up to our commitments.
#Iran poses threats to security around the world. But undermining the #JCPOA makes addressing those threats more difficult.
Decertifying #JCPOA doesn‚Äôt combat #Iran's support for terrorism, ballistic missile program, #humanrights violations. Only makes it worse.
#TrumpAdmin has no effective strategy to push back on #Iran‚Äôs ballistic missile development, assistance to Assad regime, and terrorism.
Leaving the #IranDeal undermines US credibility on the global stage. Is that the best for our #NatSec?
If we let #Iran out of the #JCPOA via decertification, they could do so AND keep the billions they received in sanctions relief
If #Iran resumes its rush to the bomb after #Trump decertifies, this could spark 2nd nuclear crisis, including #NorthKorea
Donald #Trump decertifying but saying we‚Äôre staying in #IranDeal is hairsplitting. Decertifying is the first step towards walking away.
