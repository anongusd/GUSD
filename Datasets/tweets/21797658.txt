Don't assume a DACA deal is inevitable. Both sides seem willing to walk away if they don't get what they want. Advocates say they won't accept Trump demands in trade for DACA protections; Trump says we'll end up with "nothing at all" if package isn't good enough.

@ChrisMegerian Very true.
Clinton finally speaks aloud her new Sanders-negotiated proposal on college: no tuition for students in families earning less than $125k
Must be gratifying to Sanders to hear Clinton thank him for his lifetime of fighting for justice
Clinton takes up Sanders slogan and promises to build "a future we can all believe in"
Kidding aside, it's clear Team Clinton got what they have craved: a full-throated endorsement from Sanders and a promise to help this fall
At end comes some specific praise for Clinton -- fierce advocate, one of the most intelligent. She will "make an outstanding president"
Sanders: "I intend to be in every corner of this country to make certain" Dems are elected-- no doubt he will be in demand.
The Hillary nod is getting a work out this morning.

Sanders has now spoken more forcefully about Clinton support for Medicare buy-in than Clinton has

@davidaxelrod @HillaryClinton There are at least a half dozen planks to her college plan, and I think she explained them all
One of Clinton's challenges in talking about her college plan--more pieces and more complicated than Sanders, which is "free tuition"
What Clinton got out of going to a women's college? "Women were in charge of everything." Lots of opportunities for leadership
"Why is there one standard for me" and another for everyone else, Clinton says-- suspect she feels that way about more than transcripts
Clinton clarifies that when she says she'll release her transcripts if "everyone" does, that means Republicans too
Asked about religion, Sanders gives humanistic response-- people need to work together and treat each other right. No mention of a deity.
Asked if there are any billionaires he likes @BernieSanders cites @BillGates

Race relations better under President Sanders than Obama? He says yes, by addressing poverty, law enforcement, drug laws #DemTownHall

@RalstonReports Only so many ways he can say he supports legalization program
Sanders's opposition to the 2007 immig bill highlights a time when Dems were much less unified on this issue than they are today

RT @JohnJHarwood: Terrific questions from voters at this CNN town hall. Rabbi's on ego/humility balance so apt/smart

Not clear from this answer on Supreme Court that overturning Citizens United would be litmus test for appointees, as Sanders vows
Clinton says she'll get to 100% insurance coverage, but her plan really is about reducing out-of-pocket costs, not increasing coverage
Clinton's core message: "Good ideas on paper are important but you’ve got to be able to translate them into action"
Clinton has a pretty good come back, saying under Sanders' definition, Obama, Biden, Shaheen wouldn't be progressives
Both Sanders and Clinton both say they are terrible singers. With O'Malley out, those who care about this important matter are screwed
One question about Sanders' electability: would his standing with general public hold up after Republicans take out the knives?
Sanders says "I'm not a great fan of polls" but he sure does cite them a lot.
@mikememoli And many times since then
Sanders on his age at end of two terms: "We'll take one term at a time."
I can't wait for moment when a candidate tells a town hall participant: that's the dumbest question I've ever heard

@AnnieLinskey Yes
Interesting question to Sanders: how do you appeal to those who see the world through a religious or racial lens

Trying to reassure, Obama predicts a future president who tried undo his exec action "would not have the support of the American people."
