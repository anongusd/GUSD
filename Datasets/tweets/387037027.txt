@IngrahamAngle Reasonable, moral, ethical solution: All males undergo vasectomy at birth. The vasectomy is reserved when the male is ready for children. So much cheaper, easier and healthier than other forms of birth control.

@TuckerCarlson Well, they are American citizens so... yeah, they are meant to run the country if they are the majority. That's kinda how it works.
@SebGorka @rushlimbaugh Did you get an answer yet? Just in case you didn't: Because John McCain was much more Presidential than the current person residing in the Office.
@realDonaldTrump I think it's clear now that Obama made Jeff Sessions the Attorney General specifically to hurt the Republican party and hurt the current White House. Obama is no longer the President, he should never have been allowed to select the Attorney General. Disgraceful.

@realDonaldTrump Don, the people are mad about the words that came out of your mouth, not the reporting afterwards. You should really give some thought to getting out now before it gets worse. At least if you leave on your own terms, you can spin it in a way to save your brand/reputation.
@realDonaldTrump No way to recover from this one. Best if you leave on your own terms now before detroying the Trump brand and turning your family into social pariahs. It's not too late to bail out and move on to something else.
@realDonaldTrump There is no way out of this mess for you. Quit before it gets worse. This will destroy the Trump brand forever.
@realDonaldTrump It was a good run while it lasted, but now it is time to pack it up and go home. Thank you for playing.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Nope, sorry, I did not see Obama standing behind Trump today, pulling any strings or throwing his voice. Trump is responsible for everything he said and everything you did NOT say today.

@RodStryker I would like to see one tweak to the bill. Individual tax cuts never expire. The corporate tax cuts expire in 10 years. Corporations can reapply for the tax cut if they can prove the money was invested in workers, more jobs, higher wages, more training, etc.
@SenateMajLdr Amendment to the tax bill: Individual tax cuts never expire. Corporate tax cuts expire in 10 years. At the end the 10 years, corporations that have invested the money back into the US economy with higher wages, more jobs, etc can reapply for another 10 years of tax cuts.
@HouseGOP Counter proposal: Individual cuts never expire. Corporation tax cuts expire in 10 years. At the end of 10 years, if corporations have invested the tax savings back into the US economy, they can reapply for the tax cut. Failure to invest? Money must be returned to the feds.
