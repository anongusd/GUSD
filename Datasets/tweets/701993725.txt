I say this to you Congressman because you are a United States Air Force Veteran. How did I lead to this paranoid thoughts? I had a classmate that knows about every weapon and explosives. For Christs Sake, I'm just a pacifist. Anyone could get their hands on this shit.
@RepTedLieu 	I have a conspiracy theory backed up with evidence from @Reuters @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC that anybody rogue could blow up the wall with explosives, RPGs and other WMDs. 9/11 proved it and so did video attacks in the Middle East (i.e Hamas, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and Al-Shabab)

@DCPoliceDept needs to hire more African cops from the African Continent.
@DCPoliceDept @NAACP @TheJusticeDept By putting our cultural differences aside we can Make America United Again. America was never united with the South being more racist than the North. Racism is unconstitutional. It was Africa that created human kind and we need to respect that
@DCPoliceDept @NAACP This beef of Black Lives Matter Vs Blue Lives Matter just has to stop man. Why can't people just get along for just being people? Why does it have to be about race? Where is the unity between cultures? This is the United States of America dammit.

Call me crazy but suicide can help solve overpopulation. Pychiatric words do not help people. I was in a pschytric ward and I felt imprisoned.
Suicide should not be illegal simply because one is not taking another life. I would choose suicide over murder if I had to choose because I like to spare lives.

@DHSgov   @SecNielsen Also would you rather let CBP stare at a border wall all day? If it was concrete, you would not be able to see SHIT!!!! Just stick to cameras and sensors ok? They get the job down assholes.
@DHSgov @SecNielsen	Two reasons why a wall can't be built.	1) Can't withstand explosives like napalm, grenards, WMDs, TNT, dynamite, IEDs (Internal Explosive Devices) #AnythingDetonated	2) A plane could could crash into a concrete or steel wall. Look at 9/11.
@DHSgov 	I'm tipping you off. Ever seen the documentary DOPE on @netflix ?	Well aparently drug smugglers and gun runners use slippers to not trip off the cameras and sensors. Go get em.
Suppose you saw on my college transcript that I had an Associates Degree from Montgomery College (60 credits) BA from Universities of Shady Grove and that you accepted me at @Georgetown , how long would it take to complete my degree? Two years at most?
@AOC Believe me the threat of a wall is still out there. Honestly for the love of **** God, all known explosives can take down a wall. Think of 9/11,  even a plane could fly in the wall. Then what @DHS gon do? Yeah, investigate that shit like they always do	 Cameras/sensors do the job

All racists are fascists. Trump is a fascist racist pig. Lincoln was a better Republican than he was. At least Lincoln did not attack illegal immigrants. Democrats may have been racist pre-19th century but after JFK died, LBJ faithfully executed good Democrat Party status.
After, the year 1890, minority groups started growing and the trend is still going up.  #RacistsAreFascists
