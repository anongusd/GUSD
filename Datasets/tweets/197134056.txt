Dayton: "We’ve done more for Minnesota and we’ve done it better." Mentions kindergarten, minimum wage, equal right to marry and others.
Dayton with some humor tonight, says if meteor hits Minnesota, "It will be ... because our taxes are too high." #MNSOTS
Dayton on budget surplus: "By contrast, we have righted our state government’s fiscal ship." #MNSOTS
Dayton asks for proposals for a broad racial economic opportunities bill. Says his proposal won't be "complete package." #MNSOTS
Dayton describes recent visit to vandalized mosque, calls it "despicable act of bigotry." #MNOSTS
RT @carlymelin: Thank you @GovMarkDayton for your remarks about unemployment benefits for Iron Range families. #MNSOTS #mnleg

Dayton on benefits: "If you keep those promises...I will sign that legislation next week." #MNSOTS
Dayton calls on #mnleg to commit to Iron Range benefits extension. Big ovation.
Dayton on transportation systems and early childhood education: "If we stop working together, we stop making progress."
