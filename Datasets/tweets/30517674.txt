Since everyone is posting about #NationalPizzaDay, here are my hot pizza opinions:		1. Pineapple and Canadian bacon is one of the best topping combos possible.	2. Olives do not belong on pizza.	3. Thin crust &gt; Deep dish.	4. I don't get people who throw away the crust. https://t.co/Wu37vGuW9j

@JamesMunozNC25 @atompkins @Poynter It doesn‚Äôt reflect well on either. I do think Acosta too often steps into the area of theatrics.
@kristenorsborn @atompkins I definitely agree it is alarming and disturbing. However I don‚Äôt think the article defended that. In fact, it says it is not meant to be a justification. But well-phrased questions would have been more beneficial than the ones Acosta used.
I agree with this 100%.		Great stuff @atompkins and @poynter.		#Journalism https://t.co/8AJfbjmeRc
@kristenorsborn @atompkins Perhaps not but what we saw yesterday isn‚Äôt either and it is far more detrimental. There were any number of big stories happening yesterday and yet the one we were talking about was a Jim Acosta. That is bad practice.
@kristenorsborn I respectfully disagree. 		This take is spot on. And as someone who has followed and learned from @atompkins for years, I respect his brand of journalism and what they teach at Poynter much more than CNN/Acosta.

@breakin_science Great response. üôÑ
@TR0771N @breakin_science I never said anything ill about the man. My tweet is encouraging people to do the exact same thing. What is your problem?
@Justgavriel The story has been updated and I never said a word about the fan. He is an example of exactly what my tweet said you should do.
@breakin_science If you don‚Äôt know why, then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs being discussed.		Adults who feel it is some kind of accomplishment catching a foul ball are akin to the Uncle Rico HS football  ‚Äúif only coach had put me in the 4th qtr‚Äù type.
@KimK_NY @starkravingblah My tweet has gotten way more likes and retweets than objectors.
@breakin_science That would be really weird if an adult ‚Äúappreciates‚Äù a foul ball.
@cardsfaninky Did you hear me say one bad word about him? You lay off.
@KimK_NY @starkravingblah  https://t.co/j9rKPO8bs6
@KimK_NY @starkravingblah That‚Äôs how you define ‚Äúenjoying the little things?‚Äù		See, catching the ball and then flipping it to a kid and seeing how pumped they get is how to really enjoy the little things, but hey, you enjoy the random Rawlings baseball.
@starkravingblah @KimK_NY My point is the baseball is hardly worth much. Wasn‚Äôt trying to quote the retail price. 		And I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúno one gave me a ball when I was a kid‚Äù line multiple times now. 		Perhaps that‚Äôs what they grew up to be so angry.......... üëÄ
@Brad_Deuster Not harassing anyone. I didn‚Äôt say one Ill word about the man. I just applauded the Cubs and encouraged more adults to give foul balls to kids.
@breakin_science Weird that an adult would value a random baseball more than a kid.
@Sarita_72 Generally speaking, a $2 baseball will mean more to a kid than an adult.
@KimK_NY Because it is a two dollar baseball.
@leylah_reigns Meh......speaking generally, it means more when you are a kid.
@Spot4SC I didn‚Äôt get the story wrong. I didn‚Äôt report the story.

@Blakes2Bad Ha ha ha!!! Takes more than tattoos and a Twitter account. Fake tough ain't enough.
@robertredway The home run ball might carry some significance but I certainly wouldn't object to giving those away either.
@Blakes2Bad I didn't say a word about the man other than good move by the Cubs and urging all adults to give baseballs to kids. And I have a feeling you wouldn't dare say that to my face, twitter tough guy.

#IAmUp from the Texas State Capitol. Yesterday, @GovAbbott held the first of 3 roundtables in the wake of #SantaFe.		Will Abbott budge at all on gun laws at today's gun control roundtable?		@CollinCoSO Jim Skinner and Momentous Institute's @michellebkinder are invitees. https://t.co/hSV3Ev00Iq
.@GovAbbott says he learned more than he thought today. Among ideas.		- better coordination between law enforcement and schools.	- incentives for students to report information	- better behavior health counseling	-upgrading entrance/exit points and adding cameras.		#santafe https://t.co/qjDJKHjtsT
Each of @GovAbbott three roundtables will have a different focus:		Day 1 (today) - School and community safety. (education leaders, law enforcement)	Day 2 - Gun regulations/mental health. (experts, advocates in both areas)	Day 3 - Victims. (Victims will be part of discussion)
"We all want guns out of the hands of those who want to murder our children. The leaders of Texas need to ask direct questions to those with expertise and get direct answers." - @GovAbbott 		#GunControl #SantaFe https://t.co/yPK9atdq3n
Governor Greg Abbot says roundtable Day 1 is to develop strategies that will prevent shootings like in #SantaFe and #SutherlandSprings.		The three superintendents from North Texas, Ricardo Lopez of Garland, Craig Bessent of Wylie, Michael Hinojosa of Dallas are sitting together. https://t.co/eVlfGbnXos
@MelLeonor_ @GovAbbott Supposed to be 1:30 PM but it‚Äôs closed to the media except for the first five minutes of the roundtable.
Heading to Austin to cover the first of three roundtable discussions @GovAbbott has called on #schoolsafety. Here is what he said after the #SantaFe shooting.

FBI really is not revealing much about the explosion, how it detonated or where they think the package came from or was bound for. When asked about the investigation at the Austin Airport FedEx facility, Agent James Smith said he was unaware.
FBI: package arrived early in the morning. Can‚Äôt say if this is the same person setting bombs in Austin but still investigating.		#AustinBombings
Schertz Mayor Michael Carpenter says employee injured in explosion was treated and released. Police Chief Michael Hansen said package was on conveyor belt. Injured employee complained of ‚Äúringing in ears.‚Äù		They don‚Äôt think any location in Schertz was a target.		#AustinBombings

@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani But I am.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Okay. So?
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Ha ha ha!! Now you are telling me what I really mean?!?! I haven‚Äôt deviated one bit from my original stance.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani I am talking about the overall big picture, interest is down.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani But ratings = interest. They are failing to create interest if ratings are in decline.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani But again, you are cherry picking a couple fights instead of seeing the big picture. Big picture is interest in the UFC is down.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani I never said that. I said it is Dana‚Äôs job to create interest and that‚Äôs not happening. Hence ratings dropping instead of growing.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani You‚Äôre objecting to me saying interest is shrinking when you acknowledge yourself ratings are down.
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani It‚Äôs true though. UFC is losing viewers. That reflects on the promoter.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Not sure what you are objecting to. Ratings indicate interest is down as I‚Äôve been saying. What are you objecting to?
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani I‚Äôm repeating myself because it‚Äôs the point I‚Äôve been making all along. Interest is shrinking, not growing. The ratings prove that.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Ratings = interest. If people are interested, they watch. Fewer people are watching which means interest is down.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Some are more marketable than others but declining ratings tell you that the UFC and Dana aren‚Äôt doing a very good job of it.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Viewership is in decline. It is a promoter's job to get people to watch.  People have to be interested in the fighter and Dana is doing little to promote that interest. That was Ariel's point. And I agree. If you don't, you don't know how promotion works.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani You are cherry picking the best fights of the last year but ignoring the fact viewership is way down. That comes back on the promoter. As Ariel said in his original point, Dana is not really making a good effort to familiarize fans with the fighters.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani You picked one fight. Viewership is down. That means interest is down. That means the promoter is not doing their job.

@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani What you seem not to understand is that a promoter‚Äôs job is to create interest in fights/fighters/events. Right now, it‚Äôs not happening. And to Ariel‚Äôs original point, Dana didn‚Äôt even mention a thing about Cyborg‚Äôs opponent. That‚Äôs not the way you sell fights.
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani And if you think a promoter has no responsibility for declining viewership, you have not a clue what you are talking about. BTW, I think Ariel knows a thing or two about the biz. He agrees with me.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Why did they promote Rousey over Nunes?!?! Ha ha ha!!! Okay, now you are showing your lack of understanding. Rousey was a known draw.
@Sbodnik @itsallaboutmma @arielhelwani I am not expecting him to be McGregor, but they have woefully undersold Stipe.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani And as I told you, Stipe has been among the best heavyweights ever. So they‚Äôve blown the opportunity to make money off him.
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani If you don‚Äôt have stars, that comes back on promotion. Stipe has the most consecutive title defenses ever yet UFC shuns him. That is solely on poor promotion. Promote well and you get viewers. UFC is not and numbers are declining. Proof is in the pudding.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Why haven‚Äôt they promoted Stipe as hard? The guy has multiple title defenses and is an American heavyweight. They promoted a unknown over a known. Bad promotion.
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani Funny how you are not touching the declining numbers. I guess you can‚Äôt explain it.
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Meanwhile, they could have been hyping Stipe (the actual champ) this whole time and he would have lived up..... and surpassed it.
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani I‚Äôve made several legitimate points you‚Äôve yet to refute. Betting on a challenger instead of a proven champion(a heavyweight no less!) is bad promoting. 		Please explain to me the loss in viewership?
@itsallaboutmma @Sbodnik @arielhelwani Ha ha ha!!!! Rather than bank on an established champion, they bank on a challenger who then gets dominated by said established champion? Isn‚Äôt that the very definition of poor promoting?
@Sbodnik @arielhelwani I am not joking. You can‚Äôt suffer a loss in viewership and not take a look at the promoter. Look at Dana‚Äôs recent missteps with Stipe. If anything, guys like Ariel are doing a much better job promoting the sport than Dana himself.

@ABC4Kim @WFAAJFlo No one said you were a bad person. And I get the jokes. My point is media should be held to a higher standard and in this case that means discussing why the day exists instead of promoting denigrating jokes so that perhaps the causes championed on the day may help raise better..
@ABC4Kim @WFAAJFlo I just feel making jokes of a day promoting many good causes like suicide prevention and mental health do denigrate the purpose. And yes, I get it that there will be jokes. Just wished media members would stop taking part.
@ABC4Kim @WFAAJFlo My last reply was to JFlo and I said denigrate. Not degenerate.

@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual I cannot understand any parent restricting their child‚Äôs friends based on race. I do not find their fears to be legit. They are discriminatory and hateful and are counterproductive.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual They‚Äôre guilty of the same thing you are. Making everything about race.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual Are you going to stop making everything about race? We can run this circle all day.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual I don‚Äôt think either of us are going to change the others mind. However, I do feel you indicted yourself when you tried to make the Sean Lee/Zeke debate about race. It shows that you want to make race a factor no matter the situation.
The #DallasCowboys offensive struggles have more to do with losing Tyron Smith than a suspended Zeke Elliott. 		No protection and too many holding penalties right now.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual My point is I HAVE seen how people of a different race are treated and I while some are at a disadvantage, it shouldn‚Äôt be the scapegoat for everything.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual True but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are discriminated against by everybody in every situation.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual My father is not white and was not born in this country. So you are once again making assumptions about me and what my opinion is based on.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual That doesn‚Äôt mean those advantages apply in every single situation.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual And your opinion on the matter is rooted in blaming everything and viewing everything on privilege.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual Because privilege comes in many forms and fashions. Why do you only concentrate on one?
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual And to me, that is a broad assumption as I mentioned before. One that is very discriminatory.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual I understand what privilege is. I don‚Äôt think it applies in every walk of life including who children should choose for friends.
@HiitsBennyJet I think the Cowboys with Dak, Dez, Witten, can still score points. Not so sure the defense can stop people without their best player.		Stop making this about race.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual But why would that mean children of different races should not be friends? You keep dodging the main question this entire convo is focused on because you want to call me racist. This is why these conversations don‚Äôt go anywhere. You love calling people racist.
@HiitsBennyJet But the Cowboys have many weapons on offense. Very few playmakers on defense. Sean Lee is the key cog in the middle.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual The broad assumption I am talking about is that white children would not make good friends for black children.
@HiitsBennyJet @robquig @mhk_actual I am one of those people who think how hard you have it in America depends on more factors than race.
@HiitsBennyJet Yes he is. The Cowboys scored 30+ in the two games Sean Lee missed and lost both because they couldn‚Äôt stop the Rams or Packers.

@robquig @mhk_actual IÔ∏è think you would understand my skepticism when you say you‚Äôd run a piece from a white parent laying out racist ideals for why they are reluctant to let their children have black friends.
@robquig @mhk_actual As IÔ∏è said earlier, you still have to adhere to basic journalistic principals. This particular piece does not do that choosing instead to irresponsibly profile groups of people. Would we do that in any other piece we publish? No. In fact, we are taught to do the exact opposite.
@robquig @mhk_actual IÔ∏è did and IÔ∏è felt much of the criticism it is receiving is justified. And if the NYT is going to put their name on it, they have to own it as well. The old excuse of ‚Äúnewspapers have always done this‚Äù is a not valid. Times change. This climate has proven that.
@robquig @mhk_actual Throwing ‚Äúopinion‚Äù on a piece does not absolve one from basic journalistic responsibilities and principles. Opinions should be supported by facts.
