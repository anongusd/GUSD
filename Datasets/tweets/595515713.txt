#ItsOnUs is designed to change the campus culture so that survivors &amp; bystanders need not fear retaliation. They should have support of all. https://t.co/NzUF9u8khz
Good point. Even though more women are assaulted we should have zero tolerance for any assault. Contact the local support group in your area https://t.co/oQnkbNRY0M
People often need professional help. We can make sure they have resources available incldng the National Sexual Assault Hotline: 800 6564673 https://t.co/0pEVJ35PCw
This week is the 5th #ItsOnUs Week of Action. Share some of the activities you're hosting on your campuses to help end campus sexual assault
Sex without consent is rape. Rape is a crime. There are no excuses for committing crimes. It takes all of us to spread this message #ItsOnUs https://t.co/jP5jmXouFT
The magic of @ItsOnUs is there's safety in numbers. We want to create a culture where all have the courage to intervene. It starts with you. https://t.co/OaR6X8jqLm
The @usedgov just released toolkit to help administrators of younger students prevent sexual assault in our schools: https://t.co/lDHNfAjoMM https://t.co/daUWeu672I
Begin with "You are not alone." Ensure they receive immediate health care treatment and support them in reporting to appropriate authorities https://t.co/N3EXDHGHlC
Students should contact school administrators &amp; offer to help raise awareness abt Title IX. Check out this guidance: https://t.co/HwYLBqOZT6 https://t.co/MY1WYEd87j
Survivors need to feel confident that they will be treated with decency and fairness. That includes how first responders interact with them. https://t.co/Cxsj9bg23P
We are very interested in sharing best practices. Please let us know what you're doing on your campus so that we can learn from one another!
Spread the word about the long-term traumatic effects of sexual assault. Learn what consent means, and be brave enough to intervene #ItsOnUs https://t.co/1zi5XKvsn9
Good question! Everyone is responsible for creating a culture where students can learn in a safe environment. Bystander intervention works!! https://t.co/xnQWoLsSk3

My fondest memories of @NMHschool weren't just of the buildings, but the many good people who touched my life in profound, meaningful ways.
6th-Compromise isn't a bad word. It's essential in a diverse, interconnected world. Never compromise your integrity, core values. @NMHschool
5th-Trust your instincts. Listen to yourself. You already know yourself very well, even at 18. @NMHschool
4th-Avoid the path of least resistance. It will lead you to a mundane life, &amp; you deserve better. @NMHschool
3rd-Life's a marathon, not a sprint. Be free to change course, in search of what gives you meaning. Only you can discover that. @NMHschool
2nd-Find ways to stay grounded &amp; whole. Make friends who support &amp; nourish you, whether you're up or down. @NMHschool
1st lesson-Enjoy the adventure. Relax. You'll see and absorb so much more if you're open to the adventure of new possibilities. @NMHschool
Honored to be back at my alma mater @NMHschool. Congratulations, Class of 2016 https://t.co/uqhZtQb3Rj
"Today we have righted a terrible wrong"-@SenatorBarb. @POTUS signs bill allowing female WWII pilots to be buried at Arlington Cemetery
That‚Äôs how change happens. One citizen at a time. Congratulations @ColbyCollege Class of 2016!
Take the long view. The toughest problems take culture change. Changes in hearts, habits, attitudes. @ColbyCollege
Today‚Äôs politics makes compromise seem weak or ideologically unfaithful, but it‚Äôs essential to healthy, diverse democracy. @ColbyCollege
Engage your fellow citizens with genuine curiosity ‚Äì with a near insatiable hunger to understand their perspectives. @ColbyCollege
If communities are divided, elected leaders will be too. Lack of respect, compassion for others infuses our politics. @ColbyCollege
Citizenship more than engaging w/ gov., it‚Äôs how we relate to each other; our obligations, service, &amp; fidelity to one another. @ColbyCollege
It's not enough to passively love our country. We must act to perfect it. @ColbyCollege https://t.co/2ucs7pMh4s
Embrace responsibilities of citizenship. Vote in every election. Engage with your elected representatives, at every level. @ColbyCollege
I‚Äôm optimistic b/c never been better time to be alive. Tech brings together our best minds in a way never before possible. @ColbyCollege
Instead of where needs are negotiated, politics is tribal. Difference causes scorn &amp; suspicion, not curiosity &amp; compromise. @ColbyCollege
The forced intimacy of our world tests our humanity, tolerance, and core decency in profound ways. @ColbyCollege
Factors bringing us closer together are same ones that drive us apart. New challenges require inclusive strategies. @ColbyCollege
