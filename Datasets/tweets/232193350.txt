@NickKristof About1,800 kids die per day from diarrhoeal disease linked to #WASH. 44% could be saved through handwashing or 289,000 kids/yr.
Now over to @USAIDGH &amp; John Pasch to discuss #WASH solutions: Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene. Please use #iwashmyhands to ask questions.
Support handwashing by signing the #Promise4Children pledge to end preventable child deaths http://t.co/ubredXl2. #iwashmyhands
Global leaders pledged at the C2A to prioritize strategies/investments that accelerate progress #MDG4 #promise4children #iwashmyhands
Add a bednet, vaccines, nutrition, rehydration, newborn care; we know how to drastically reduce child deaths #iwashmyhands #promise4children
For example, the spread of #pneumonia, the #1 killer of children under 5, can easily be prevented by handwashing with soap. #iwashmyhands
Most of what we need to do to bring down the rate of child deaths is inexpensive &amp; straightforward. #iwashmyhands #promise4children
Last yr 6.9 million children died before their #5thbday. These deaths were from largely preventable causes. #iwashmyhands #promise4children

GDP growth originating in agriculture is 3 to 6 times more effective at raising the incomes of the poor than in manufacturing or services.

In Liberia, we're shifting health spending directly to their health ministry, saving us $1M while building a crucial government institution.
So, instead of subcontracting w the same Ethiopian NGO for 12 yrs in a row we’ve rewritten laws to let us save money and pay them directly
And we recently eliminated painful regulations that required our staff to seek waivers every time they wanted to buy goods in-country.
We have pushed our assistance to the poorest countries up to nearly $10 billion—that’s up from $980 million in 2001.
We continue to push our aid to where we need it most. We doubled our aid to Africa and closed a 40 percent senior staffing gap there.
And that's why we need institutions like @CGDev, @BrookingsInst. @aidtransparency, others to make sure we live up to those commitments

W/o political stability, fighting corruption and graft, lowering investment risk, our development work cannot achieve sustainable results

As Pres Obama has made clear, we are living in a new world with a new paradigm of national interest that tracks more closely to our values
I believe @USAID can and should play a larger role in serving as a voice for vulnerable ppl and being a global leader in dem & governance
