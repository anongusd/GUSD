Now that communities have developed a common consumer app @hellobluedot, we have a common approach in place and useful information can be easily exchanged. The proposed rules take the next step and require sharing of information in a usable form with the patient.
The ten-year reliance on electronic medical records has not yet produced sharing of useful data or breakthroughs in medicine.
All agreed that a shift to patient's controlling data will allow for breakthroughs in health as other factors like localized environment (pollution), behavior and other factors can be considered to figure out the why and effective treatments for various maladies.

And we’re off! The #CES2018 show floor is open! https://t.co/gBYQAEJZjj
With the new year comes a renewal of opportunity. Washington must work together to protect the framework that has led to our success, supporting US innovation for generations to come. /END Via @techdirt https://t.co/XsQhD52GjE
Pursue a business-friendly regulatory framework. Pres. @realDonaldTrump took the lead, spearheading regulatory reform, driving down unemployment &amp; powering the rising stock market. Congress must continue his efforts, creating policies that encourage innovation &amp; entrepreneurship.
Act to protect the most vital of our freedoms – #freespeech. Low taxes and limited regulatory interference mean nothing if we lack the intellectual freedom to try out new ideas without fear of legal consequences.
Patent trolls are undermining the strength of our patent system and bleeding $80B a year from our economy. Too many businesses are dragged down by their lawsuits and threats. Congress must act to #FixPatents and ensure we maintain the best IP system in the world.
Invest in infrastructure – including 5G broadband and highway construction. Over the next decade, IoT, #smartcities and self-driving vehicles will profoundly change our country for the better. By getting a head start, federal leaders can help smooth this transition.
Pursue #immigrationreform that opens our borders to the world’s best and brightest. More than 50% of our country’s unicorns were started by immigrants. Immigrants are a key ingredient to America's continued position as the global leader in innovation.
Uphold "safe harbor" and “fair use” principles in domestic law and promote them in an updated #NAFTA. These laws allow users and entrepreneurs to innovate, free from ruinous nuisance lawsuits.
Promote fair and free #trade. We can’t be isolationists and support American ingenuity. For instance, threats to hinder trade with China – a crucial trade partner of the US tech industry – would harm, not help, tech innovation. Our supply chain is global and must be kept open.
If policymakers want to preserve our global leadership and protect this vital industry, they should craft policies that strengthen innovation. As Washington gets down to business in the new year, here are some ways this can happen…
Increasingly, however, that framework is becoming unstable. Free speech is under attack. Regulators punish companies for being successful. New legislation threatens to punish companies for the actions of their users. And immigration reform faces challenges.
From our education system that encourages originality and ingenuity, to our openness to immigrants and innovation, to the 1st Amendment and its protection of intellectual freedom, our system rewards those who have the courage and creativity to make their ideas a reality.
The reason our country leads the world in tech and can host a show like @CES is because we promote public policies designed to foster entrepreneurship and innovation.
I love the int'l energy of @CES. But each year, @CES makes me proud to be an American. Our tech industry supports 15M+ US jobs and thousands of brands and companies that are known and appreciated all over the world. #CES2018 showcases tech’s leading innovators and advocates.
