Key line from Cohen: "He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders, he speaks in code, and I understand the code because I've been around him for a decade." Others who try defending Trump end up confirming this when they say "that's just how he talks."

@yashar It‚Äôs an homage to a longtime NYPost news desk editor.

On one screen, it‚Äôs reporters reading through the Cohen testimony in real time. On the other, it‚Äôs Season 3 Episode 2 of Billions.
In one column of tweets, it‚Äôs reporters tweeting text of Cohen‚Äôs prepared opening statement. In the other, it‚Äôs video of an egg coffee from reporters in Vietnam.
In one column of tweets, it‚Äôs Michael Cohen talking about the president calling black people ‚Äústupid.‚Äù In the other, it‚Äôs pool reports about the president sitting down for a five-course ‚Äúworking lunch‚Äù featuring grilled cod fish and roasted Wagyu medallions.

If you close your eyes, you can hear the president saying these same things as a candidate three years ago. It is almost as if he hasn't been president for 2  years and had control over his own foreign policy.
"We want to spend money in OUR country," Trump says.
"We want to bring our troops home. It's time," says Trump, who also told CBS two weekends ago that he wants to leave troops in Iraq to keep an eye on Iran.
"I didn't save our country. You know who saved our country? You saved our country...God," Trump says.
"There's such obstruction in congress," Trump says. Tonight, he's reassigned the two words related to questions about him that investigators are looking at - collusion and obstruction of justice - to Democrats.
Later, "How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn? .... Feels a little phony to me." Someone notes Obama had a dog. "OBama had a dog, you're right," Trump laughs. Then starts reading prompter again. "Both parties must come together" on immigration.
"There is nothing better than a good old fashioned German shepherd," says POTUS, referring to drug-sniffing dogs.
"Safety is the birthright of every American," Trump says, later adds, "Because walls are not immoral," a reference to Pelosi line.
Trump accusing the media of trying to "pull the wool over everybody's eyes" with reports about the actual impact of the wall in El Paso.

The Trump rally is a hell of a preview of what is to come.
Should have noted but will here, Burr's committee hasn't "just announced" anything. The committee has said it has so far not found evidence of Trump collusion with Russia.
Trump says Burr's committee has cleared him, then seeks to rebrand "collusion" with Dems and Russia, and Dems and media at El Paso rally. Lines he's used in various places before, but this is a more tailored version.
