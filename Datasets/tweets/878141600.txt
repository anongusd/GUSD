@betsy89054812 @RyanAFournier Exactly, God has has them where he wants them. They may not know it but they are snared in Gods trap! WE will all be able to watch their demise!
@RyanAFournier One of the sins God hates the most is those who sow contention and division among men! I have a feeling God has a reason for their taking the house...He has set them in a trap that they will not get free from...and hes setting up Trump to win in 2020...
@Akrolltide @kendickens4 @RyanAFournier @FascistDemocra1 I am a Godly person, I believe that had the dem ok crats hadn't taken the house we would have thought that we won on our own work! God always wants his People to lean on him and him only...IHave aFeeling even though theDems tookThe house, they willFind that they aren't inControl!

@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS Who are we kidding? We know that all this is political and nothing but political and Kavanugh and Ford are just Pawns in the game!
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS She did not use the confidential,bipartisan process that the Judiciary Committee uses daily to assess the credibility of allegations against 100rds of judicial nominees which would have given Ford the chance to talk to the committee‚Äôs investigators in a confidential setting.
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS Both Kavanaugh and Ford have been ill-served by Senate Democrats in this process. Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee‚Äôs ranking Democrat, knew about Ford‚Äôs accusation for about six weeks and did nothing. She never asked Kavanaugh about the allegations in private or in public.
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS including his two young daughters, who are hearing awful things said about the father they love. He cannot prove a negative. So far, there are accusations but no corroborating evidence. And accusations without evidence cannot be the standard by which a man‚Äôs reputation is ruined
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS She can‚Äôt remember the date the alleged attack took place. She isn‚Äôt even certain about the year. Ford deserves to be treated with dignity, not maligned or attacked. But let‚Äôs not forget that Kavanaugh is human too. This ordeal affects not only him but also his family.
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS Agreed! I still cannot help but wonder why she did not speak up when he worked for the Bush Administration!! You would think that she would have said something then, dont you?
@HoliHandGrenade @realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS What I meant was that God knows the truth and we do not! God knows if this is just a ploy on the Left or if it is the truth! Either way God will render to whomever the justice due! If God wants this man or another on the Supreme Court we cant stop it! neither can Ford!

And they continue to not credit Trump for all he has done. They will never be satisfied or content, they will die uncontent!
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump We have the best POTUS. Demo-rats will give him the credit do when " he'll freezes over" but who cares?
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr. President!
@MarisaLewis @realDonaldTrump I neverd said he wasn't but he was also put in the judgeship by Carter who is and was a Democrat. Who knew his liberal views which is why he chose him. For all points and purposes he is Democrat at heart when it comes to touchy feely!
@lauztran @realDonaldTrump To ABRIDGE our rights in any way is illegal! According to the Constitution. Congress cannot make any law that abridges my rights. We have let our government take them because we have not been schooled on the Constitutional rights! "GET SCHOOLED" OR GET OVERRULED! YOUR CHOICE!!!
"Closet" liberal...He knows they have been passing illegal gun laws for yrs, which is why he said REPEAL in order to COVER up their illegal gun laws! Gun Owners know your rights! Not one gun law is legal according to CONSTITUTION! they all ABRIDGE YOUR GUN RIGHTS AND YOUR FREEDOM https://t.co/XSM3fJ2gsO
@cameron_kasky @realDonaldTrump @NRA "Fake" Republican he is a closet liberal...He hated having to obey the CONSTITUTION and it upset him when the Constitution did not go his way because he had to obey no matter what, because he knows if we smarten up we would realize that Congress has been passing illegal laws!
My favorite quote! "Thank you" https://t.co/uNavm4BwXQ

So true!!!This is why this was set in place. Without protection it will be easier to take our rights except they already been doing this by way of the ilegal law of  "civil rights" this should never have been passed and cannot stand according to the "CONSTITUTION" https://t.co/Gc5AmPti26
@TruthinGov2016 @realDonaldTrump "INFRINDGED" means SHALL NOT BE LIMITED! This is so we can protect all our rights. Government does not have the job of protection. We do. We are in charge of protection of us and our family and our Country!!!

@DMaxMJ @Brad_Lewis_01 @JeremyStolz256 @ryshoe @hearthanhan @KyleKashuv @realDonaldTrump Talk about week minded! The libs know nothing about the Constitution or they would know the definition of ABRIDGED...Little by little they chip away at free speech and gun rights, at least we are aware of our surroundings and we do not need the rich to teach us that!
@Brad_Lewis_01 @DMaxMJ @JeremyStolz256 @ryshoe @hearthanhan @KyleKashuv @realDonaldTrump Exactly, it's ELEMENTARY my dear Watson...The demwits and libs will never understand this because they need the media to learn anything and their media is lying to them.

@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup Proper ID makes sure your a citizen	Wrong polling place is Elementary	Being a felon .. come on that's plain stupid...	If you can't get there between a certain time..."VOTE BY MAIL" 	NONE of these disenfranchises anyone's vote!
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup When was it written? We did not have the problem then that we have today with infiltration. Take the law for the time it was written and see who it covers and doesn't cover! The constitution was written to protect our way of life from out siders...For this reason...
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup Yes they do...when I vote as a citizen  and they vote as an alien they are in fact disenfranchising my vote as a citizen thereby bringing harm to me. When it comes to a natural born vs an alien' rights...my rights will always "trump" theirs, especially if I can show harm!.PERIOD!
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup Further more when the States warn aliens that ICE is coming that also hurts me as a citizen because now they are still lose to come hurt me or my family and I have a right to feel safe per the constitution! The Fed's are to step in! and protect my rights against the State!
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup You know what? It says that my rights as a voter cannot be disinfranchised. This does that! It also says that only a person born or naturalized can vote...When the States rights hurt the Nation as a whole the FEDS are to step in...When the States letting aliens vote does this!
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup The "Equal Protection Clause" was only passed after the civil war created for colors only and not for other races...The 14th came after the war between the States, and then the protection of Chinese Japan etc...It was never meant for any other RACE other than these. Dates proveit
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup BIG "HUGE" difference! THEY CANT VOTE...THEY HAVE WHAT THE 14TH SAYS A RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION, ie...They get their day in court...That's all. If they can prove harm if deported that is up to a Judge to decide! Not a Sheriff, Mayor. Or any other public official!!!
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup Same protection not same rights!...
@ilikemike2015 @Rose43194994 @charliekirk11 @SHICAGroup The constitution initially only granted voting right to white men...later amendments extended the voting right to include women and blacks.	The 14 amendment addresses the rights of the citizen and not aliens,undocumented nor ilegals...a non citizen cannot vote!!!PERIOD!

@hardball_chris Thank you, and god bless you and your family!
@hardball_chris and you are not sounding very mature. My son saw you and I was embarrassed for you. Please stop!
@hardball_.Do not taint Obama's legacy as the first African American President of the United States,
@hardball_chris We are not racist we just do not want to lose anymore jobs and we want a future for our children.
@MittRomney This is not Obama's America, this is our America through blood sweat and tears and it was given to us by God and god only!
@MittRomney Obama lied I am middle class and he raised my taxes and I am sure that others feel the same way.
@MittRomney I am praying for you and Ann! Tell them about Obamas plans to give our freedom to the United Nations thru water, guns, and taxes
@MittRomney America already knows what Obama hasn't done. We need to know what you can do for us. Please pretend that Obama isn't there.
@MittRomney Mitt everyone wants to know what you can do for America.not what Obama hasn't God bless!  Talk to us not him!

@SpeakerBoehner Is it true the President has unequal pay for women in his administration?  if he believes in equal rights for women?
