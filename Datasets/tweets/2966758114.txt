We have not only lost a former president, but a premier example of what service really means. Rest in peace, Mr. President.
George H.W. Bush served our country in a capacity few human beings can ever claim: warrior, lawmaker, ambassador, Intelligence Chief, Vice President and President. His entire life embodied giving of himself.

There's more work to do, but we have made great strides. We are on the right path. The work cannot stop -- let's keep going.
In the House we're prioritizing YOUR choices when it comes to healthcare by providing local, affordable solutions to solve the problem of growing premiums. Those choices should be yours ‚Äî because at the end of the day, YOU know what‚Äôs best for you, not the government.
Our economy is thriving. The average Oklahoman will see an increase of nearly $20,000 over 10 years as a result of tax reform. Working families will see a bigger number ‚Äî $35,000 over the next 10 years.
For the first time in over a decade, we fully funded our military ON TIME so they can receive the tools they need to keep our country safe.
We‚Äôve accomplished a lot over the last two years, for Oklahoma and for our country. We've passed more than 1,000 bills out of the House -- 192 more than average. https://t.co/2YDcDICaWy

The single most important element that holds together our nation is UNITY. If we are to live freely and want to defend the America we know and love, we must act civilly. It is past time to put the country ahead of ourselves.
Attacks on current and former national leaders are unacceptable. These acts have no place in America. We may have different backgrounds, have different opinions and have different political affiliations, but an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.
