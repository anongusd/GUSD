@Lawrence So what would you call a President that delivered 150 billion dollars in cash to the number one state sponsor of terror, while signing a horrendous deal for the sake of just signing a deal? What do you call HRC accepting millions from countries that treat women &amp; gays horribly?
@Kay_Martin @gregpmiller What evidence?
@Alyssa_Milano Honest question Alyssa... how do you fight for "human rights" and at the same time demonize those that have differing political opinions? Comparing Trump supporters or those wearing MAGA hats to KKK members, doesn't exactly bolster your "fight," it conditionalizes it.
@tictoc @splcenter BLM and ANTIFA not being considered "hate groups" by the SPLC, shows just how credible they really are...

@refrigman1 @RandPaul https://t.co/FNzO5w2ui5
@refrigman1 @RandPaul You might want to take a look at his voting record and get woke.. he's voted several times against inflated budgets, and has had his balanced proposals shot down.  He is one man. He is one of the only fiscally responsible Senators there is. 	https://t.co/8dTMXVNTLo
@MSNBC She also voted for Alito and Sotomayor, so what's your point? There was once a day when the Senate made their vote on SCOTUS nominees based on their qualifications and knowledge of Constitutional Law. YOU folks on the Left have turned it into a partisan, political vote, NOT R's
@LorneZiemer @BunnieSpam @RogueNASA @tonyposnanski @Liz_Cheney @CoryBooker @BeefUSA Nope, just terrorists that killed nearly 3000 Americans..
@russellcrowe So now they'll just subject the audience to more of the elitist Hollywood actors going on political rants, telling us regular folk what's best for us? Hard Pass regardless.. but still loved you in Cinderella Man
@tmartin26 @ClayTravis @SethOnHoops Pretty sure #5 proves him right...
@RadioTFB @EsotericCD Is it a resolution or a complete lala land work of fiction and fantasy?
@LynnLatta @timkaine Dems brought it on themselves...  they made their bed, now they must lie in it
@AmeliaEBruno @timkaine Kavanaugh went through SIX before the one in which you reference. And he didn't mention anywhere in his tweet about Impeachment...
@MollyJongFast @NBCNews Kind of like Obama pulling out of Iraq against the advice of his generals? ISIS was in fact just a JV team correct?  So where are your tweets and articles calling out BHO for his blatant disregard to his generals?https://t.co/QYhGc9t5tF
@KurtSchlichter Wearing a Drew Brees Jersey..
@shannonrwatts @chrisdonovan So she wasn't a psychic when referring to Ed Gillespie as a racist? So she knew what was in the heart of one, and not the other? I thought the Left were masters at labeling folks racist, with a high percentage of accuracy... Hmmm
@yeomandroid @dcexaminer Did you say that about the cake bakers?
@JoyAnnReid Charlie Rangel; "God sent us Barak Obama"..    	Try again Joy
@sdselkie @JoyAnnReid @wilsonhartgrove Lol. Trollbot.... whatever floats your boat. But I guess all Consevatives with a viewpoint and ability to debate is considered a troll in the eyes of the Left and Liberal run social media.. but you're still a racist idiot, no debate needed for that
@dm82johnson @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump So then why did he pass the First Step Act, pardoned Jack Johnson, commuted Alice Marie Johnson's sentence, lowered Black unemployment to a historical low. Black support for Trump has gone from 8% at time of election, to now 36%, according to polls. Enough Dem koolaid #BLEXIT
@JoyAnnReid @norbiznesss So what would do you call Farrakhan, Jerimiah Wright, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Wallace Charles Smith??
@ResistDonaldNow @JoyAnnReid @wilsonhartgrove Oh bullshit...  it was "God has a plan, trust in him".
@sdselkie @JoyAnnReid @wilsonhartgrove Then you're a racist idiot...
@JoyAnnReid @wilsonhartgrove And you comparing her statement to a slaveholder religion, and a political theology, just highlightings your complete ignorance, and shows your racist and anti Christian sentiments. But of course, you Far Left folks can espouse your hatred for white Christians with impunity. Sick
@JoyAnnReid @wilsonhartgrove Oh sweetie... us southern Christian white folk say "it's as God wants" all the time. "God placed you here for a reason", "God has a plan".. it refers to ALL things in life, and not based on ethnicity or politics, it's based on our religion and our belief in an Almighty God.
@JoeConchaTV Yet @CNN hires a failed Gubernatorial Candidate under investigation for recieving bribes from undercover FBI agents... stark difference.
@Alyssa_Milano @JussieSmollett IF what he says happened is true, since there is no police report to support or refute, it says something about TWO individuals who are morally bankrupt and irreprehinsible. It does Not however, reflect on on the 63 million people that voted for Trump,as much you folks espouse it
@KamalaHarris So you want free college tuition for all, free Medicare for all (while kicking 150 million people off their private insurance plans) yet you plan on giving massive tax breaks to the middle class?? OK, sure Kam
@emrazz @EricMcCormack People of ALL races, religions or sexual preference kill people EVERY day in this world we live in. Instead of pointing out their race, maybe we should address the underlying issues they all have in common.. mental illness and the lack of compassion or a conscience.
@KimberlyPills @mmkck20 @WizardTikiTiki @peterberghane @nyc_2018 @NYGovCuomo Get a clue. There's NO known health reason for a fetus (a growing life) to be aborted from 24 to 36 weeks, NONE. If a mother's life is endangered, the baby is DELIVERED early. There's ZERO reason to abort a baby at 36 weeks, and if you think there is, you are a Barbaric Imbibe.
@KamalaHarris Your story was written through sleeping your way to the top. You should be proud.. 	https://t.co/sN8RYNLyVf

@RWOEsq @TheRightMelissa Actually Killary and Bill have gotten away with dozens of murders...  and how many of those "dropping like flies" have to do with Trump/Russia collusion, you know, the entire purpose of the Mueller investigation?? I'll give ya a hint, it's &gt;1.
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump It's  amazing Melissa the fact that Trump haters hate him so much, they're willing to overlook blatant law breaking in order to back their narrative.  And as you can see, none of them can refute that video, and what she did, with any justifiable proof, all they have are insults.
@RWOEsq @TheRightMelissa And yet wrote an exoneration letter ONE month Before the end of the investigation, and Before she or 17 other witnesses had even been interviewed.. doesn't take much critical thinking to know that that's NOT the norm. Her "white privilege" is thick.
@Alyssa_Milano If a person can't carry a conversation without throwing an F bomb in every sentence,  you are ignorant. I dont need a fake "scientific" study to tell me otherwise. And women that think it's somehow attractive, have never experienced being with a good man.
@TaePhoenix @RealJamesWoods Think you forgot the Africans that kidnapped, raped, caged and sold their fellow Africans to those people...
@RealJamesWoods Class compared to Crazy....
@KamalaHarris Yep.  Because he's been free to expand the scope of his TWO year investigation, WITHOUT impunity thus far, so by all means, protect an investigation that has been spending millions in taxpayer money, without the slightest attempt by the Administration to hender or stop it Cleo
@KamalaHarris Yet you fought to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering,false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. You declined to back Prop 47, Opposed a bill to investigate police shootings
@THINKorthogonal @scottdamico @JohnPForest @ohrealtor2 @noelement @martinjenne01 @greta @grammy620 Destroying evidence under subpoena... yes, that's a crime... unless your last name is Clinton
@WillMcAvoyACN @seanmdav Hmm. That explains it then. There's no way they could have been tipped off 24 hours ago....
@BilliejoBrown2 @tedlieu @greta @FoxNews The same "facts" their reporters had when framing a high school kid as a racist antagonist? CNN explaing how CNN got the jump on a story.. yep, seems perfectly legit and factual.
@tedlieu @greta Yeah... because CNN reporting on how CNN broke a story is perfectly reliable and believable.. OK Ted
@scottdamico @JohnPForest @ohrealtor2 @noelement @martinjenne01 @greta @grammy620 Sending and recieving classified info on a personal server. Destroying 33k SUBPOENAED emails. Destroyed SUBPOENAED servers with bleach bit, smashed SUBPOENAED laptops and cellphones. Lied to the FBI. Colluded with Russia and paid for a fake dossier. Clinton Foundation fraud...
@Alyssa_Milano Imagine this poor girl being aborted at 24 weeks tho...
@B_Lowwwwww @JennaLaineESPN So "did not deserve" in a rivals opinion, outweighs the facts..    you must be a Lib
@B_Lowwwwww @JennaLaineESPN But answering a question with a question... üëç
@B_Lowwwwww @JennaLaineESPN Most logical football fans would say yes
@Busch04 @JennaLaineESPN Deflection...  we can highlight just as many missed calls against us, however, only ONE coast a team their rightful spot in the Superbowl.
@B_Lowwwwww @JennaLaineESPN So that play kept the Falcons from going to the Superbowl?
@JoyAnnReid I'd like to hear why Democrats voted Against federal employees receiving paychecks during the shutdown, THREE times...  maybe you can invite them on your show and ask them why...
@JoyAnnReid @senatemajldr So why have Democrats voted against those federal employees receiving their lay during the shutdown THREE times?? Explain that one
@KamalaHarris Then why did Democrats vote against federal employees getting paid during the shutdown?? Twice...
@Alyssa_Milano So how do you feel about New York celebrating passing into Law the right to abort up to birth?  If a pregnant woman is murdered, why is the murderer charged with Two murders? Yet it's ok to extinguish the life of a child at 24 months.. BOTH are murder, Period.
@soccernurd @KamalaHarris Here are some of her great accomplishments as Prosecutor... the wannabe Progressive with a not so Progressive resume...	https://t.co/ZH8vRZUQOu
@soccernurd @KamalaHarris Healthcare for All... always the answer to to solving every crisis in this country, yet no one can explain how to pay for it, aside from the Lefts eagerness to tax the shit out of you. You can say what she "wants to do," but what has she actually done or accomplished?
@Alyssa_Milano Where's your response to the racist slurs that were being slung at a group of young students, by grown ass men? Those boys did not engage those scum. Your typical response is, if they're wearing a MAGA hat, they deserved it? Not good enough
@PattyMurray Well maybe you should do your job and compromise with the other side to find a solution instead of just resisting for the sake of resistance.
@SShall57 @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Get your facts straight... it wasn't at a Democrat/Republican baseball game, it was at a Republican only Practice..  How is he wrong? Dems dont care what's proposed, they only care about resisting all that is Trump.
@soccernurd @KamalaHarris Crickets..
@MANX38 @DosterJohn @dwiebe99 @SymoneDSanders So the Black Racist Israelites slinging horrible insults at those students, as well as other bystanders including a young black male, is perfectly ok with you sir? Show me video where they retaliated against those folks... you can spin it, you just did
@davidfrum @Lawrence Liberals ad their trusty polls...  when will you folks learn?
@oweniverson @thehill WTF was he suppose to do? Sit there and bury his head and cry? You people piling on a kid for freaking Smiling at someone who invaded HIS personal space while beating a drum, are delusional and incapable of logic.
@BootsieWalken @KamalaHarris Typical response from a Liberal nut with no substance or ability to debate the facts..
@BootsieWalken @KamalaHarris Awhh, another Cleo...  was Regan President the last 6 years as homelessness rose 75% in California??
@MightyPrytanis @KamalaHarris How do you know what the hell I do in my spare time?
@soccernurd @KamalaHarris Yet her state's homelessness rate has increased by 75% in the last 6 years..  she needs to fight a little harder
@ebonyavaharper @KamalaHarris And homelessness in California has risen by 75% in California.. Kamala is a Senator in that state is she not?
@ebonyavaharper @KamalaHarris Who said they weren't?
@SkinnyJax @KamalaHarris Homelessness has risen 75% in California over the last six years..  last I checked, Kamala is a Senator for that state... maybe she needs to do a better job of multitasking, don't ya think?
@davidson_1305 @KamalaHarris OK Cleo
@ebonyavaharper @KamalaHarris I think ALL men should show up for their kids Period... what's that got to do with it? That's a major part of what's wrong with society.
@EducatedMomWife @kedernst @KamalaHarris Isn't that what "journalism" is these days? Her record that is quoted in this article is not an opinion, it's Fact...   Care to dispute them?
@kedernst @KamalaHarris That's rich coming from a Liberal/Democrat..  didn't even bother to read it, that tells me everything
@kedernst @KamalaHarris Like these.... from the Liberal outlet NYT??	https://t.co/ZH8vRZUQOu
@ebonyavaharper @KamalaHarris Hmm. Stating statistical facts is now considered "masculinity?"  I think you forgot the "toxic" part to that. Bless your heart.
@kedernst @KamalaHarris Sorry, I prefer women that Don't sleep there way to the top
@blemephy Hmmmm. Think I learned that in 3rd grade
@kedernst @Soc007 @KamalaHarris Really...  state some of her "impressive" accomplishments as AG or Senator...   I'll wait
@KamalaHarris Only 0.6% of the US population identify as transgender, while 0.17% are homeless, and 18.5% suffer from mental illness...  why are you not fighting for those people?
@PattyMurray Control her future, plan for her family and contribute to her community.... I'm sure all those little girls snuffed out by an abortionists tongs would have appreciated the same chance at those things Senator.
@TreWhite16 Not on the refs... it's on the coaching staff.
@willsommer @jaketapper Hmmm.  I wonder if these people are from the "far right" or not??  Yet ANTIFA is just..  antifa. OK
@AndreaKuszewski @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/pN2hueEBLJ. You mean these MEN from the caravan? Hopefully you live in San Diego and will allow them to crash at your place maybe??
@KamalaHarris Who the f**k cares about the color of their skin....  Leftist, identity politics pushing Nimrods like you. Their victories should be celebrated based on their qualificatons, ccomplishments, and work ethic, NOT the color of their skin.
@Sho2da_pan @ChrisMurphyCT I'm pretty sure refusing a court order would be classified as "doing something wrong". Why dont you try it and see what happens then..
@Sho2da_pan @ChrisMurphyCT Well good for her, she can do so behind bars and wait for her Constitutional Right to a fair trial.
@ChrisMurphyCT There is 100% proof Snipes is refusing to abide by a court order, and the Law. There is 100% proof Snipes is refusing to abide by a court order, and the Law. There is 100% proof Snipes is refusing to abide by a court order, and the Law. Why is that Chris???
@Alyssa_Milano There's a lot of back and forth about "But YOUR side did this".. I think most rational people understand it's OK to disagree with one's philosophy and politics, however its NOT OK to wish harm or root for it, Period. Hate and ill will are present on BOTH sides, and needs to STOP!
@JoeNBC https://t.co/2FPdMSYPb9
@peterbakernyt @PressSec He tried to debate POTUS on the the use of the word "invasion," Trump replied in his OPINION, it is an invasion. END of question. What followed is a "reporter" grandstanding, not accepting the answer he was given, and down right refusal to relinquish the mic to the next reporter.
@staceyabrams https://t.co/UXpZeDVnWY
@jaketapper @tedcruz https://t.co/lQWuFOro1i
@Alyssa_Milano How'd Beto work out for ya?
@RepMaxineWaters Your district deserves you..  as long as your constituents keep voting for you, you will continue to deliver them the Worst district in the Country. Congrats
@RepAdamSchiff This incident took place BEFORE President Trump ever said a word about rock throwers in the invading caravan...  Try again
@Acosta According to your colleague, you (white man) are the biggest terror threat to this country, and we need to start dealing with it... so why havent you called him out for racism Jim? You wonder why the President is so critical of you "media" folk.  Boo Hoo.  Dear Diary
@Jo_Frost @ThePerezHilton Jo, Do you speak up for the thousands of unborn babies snatched from a uterus every day in this country, who's body parts are then sold for profit?
@Alyssa_Milano Once you start letting illegals live with you, pay for others to have health care, pay someone's college tuition,stop being protected by people with guns, tear down your gated walls surrounding your home, give your money away since you have plenty, only then will u be Proggresive
@rickungar @EvanSayet @jaketapper And that's just from prominent Democrats, Presidential Nominees, and mainstream media.. Until the media and politicians, on BOTH sides, realize they are duplicitous in the erosion of civil discourse in this country, regardless of what our Presiden says, it will only worsen.
@rickungar @EvanSayet @jaketapper Admittedly I've referred to the "Left" when trying to make points, and I've been told by my feminist, Liberal, Professor cousin that it's monolithic to do so.. however this is my point.  I've been called a deplorable, repugnant, evil, uneducated, racist, dreg of society..
@rickungar @EvanSayet @jaketapper I dont hate a group, I hate the labels they throw around at anyone who think outside of their box. Find me a Democrat that will openly say that there is such a thing as a Racist Democrat, beside yourself, because I've yet to see it.
@rickungar @EvanSayet @jaketapper Well you're one of the few..
@rickungar @EvanSayet @jaketapper Wait...  so anti-semites don't belong to one particular political party, yet Democrats love to throw out that R word when referring to ANY and ALL conservatives, using the Lefts favorite word, "far right"? So one knows no party, but the other does?
@Guinz @marcorubio So what would have prevented it? Pray tell.  Funny how Leftists blame everyone EXCEPT the actual individual that committed the offense.. but I'll get on your level. Your party is bought and paid for by a mass murdering group of people selling body parts for profit. I do it right?
@jaketapper Sad thing is, you dopes look at this chyron and dont see the problem...  You ARE part of the problem. https://t.co/1xNK6zb5wT

@SenJeffMerkley PJ, Judge and Keyser, the ONLY people besides BK, Professor Ford names as witnesses to the Actual event, were interviewed, under penalty of felony, and ALL categorically deny it ever happened. Keyser said she never even knew him. Anyone she told 30 years later, is NOT a witness!
@ericrescue @SenGillibrand I believe she went through some traumatic event, in her later teens as she reported to her therapist, at the hands of someone Not named Bret Kavanaugh..
@CindyCF81 @MollyJongFast @TammieCroft @AriFleischer The same Hillary that called people of color "super predators"? The same Hillary who's husband enacted the Clinton crime bill of 1994, destroying 1000's of black lives? The same Hillary that says Margaret Sanger is a hero of hers? Wake up
@ava @repblumenauer So how exactly is he wrong? Everything he said is true. She doesn't remember anything of relevance that night, except for drinking only ONE beer. Everybody she named as a witness, under penalty of a FELONY, categorically DENY her claims, yet she is still credible? Give me a break
@SenGillibrand I believe Keith Ellison's accusers..   he must Immediately withdraw from the Minnesota AG race!  Did I do it right??
@Hstorm1Storm @KenDilanianNBC To give the Left what they wanted, so we could all see for ourselves how they would then spin it into a negative... Oh the wacky Left, the gift that just keeps on giving. Once we gain Republican Senate seats, and replace Justice Ginsburg, the melt will be epic.  Cant wait
@MattxRed She has such courage and strength that she witnessed drugging and gang rapes at parties... didn't report it to anyone, and went to NINE more parties where such events took place...  WOW  so fucking courageous!

@Lawrence Hmmm. Wonder what Joe Biden said about an FBI "investigation" during the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill testimony...
@SHINEONMYMOTHER @Martina How many unhinged Leftist lunatics, sinking to hellish depths of depravity, does it take to conjure up 35 year old, UNSUBSTANTIATED accusations with the sole purpose of ruining someone's life and keeping them from being confirmed to the Supreme Court? #StandWithKavanaugh
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Says the creepy porn lawyer who's been on CNNsane and MSLSD 108 times since MARCH...
@Martina @MichaelAvenatti That's severely in doubt.  Her sworn declaration was not notarized, it did not have a date of birth, (which is needed to prove her age at time if claim) did not not have much of the pertinent information a true affidavit has.. it's a shady statement taken by a shady lawyer.
@Martina @MichaelAvenatti Once she files a police report, naming those who "allegedly" gang raped her, and files a True affidavit, with an Actual notary republic signature, then I would be more inclined to hear her story. Until then, it's just a story, and a bizarre one, that is impossible  to believe..
@Martina @MichaelAvenatti So a woman claims she was gang raped, identifies Judge Kavanaugh as just BEING there, but can't name just ONE person that supposedly GANG raped her? And she went to up to TEN of these types of parties? Now in what world does that make any damn sense? Insane and depraved hit piece
@SenGillibrand So when will you take a stand for Keith Ellison's accuser Senator????  Just keep talking out of your ass, you Leftists are quite accomplished in that way.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr How low life and evil must you be to attempt to ruin a man's life, his reputation, his career and his family, with increasingly bizarre and insane allegations from 30 plus years ago?The depths of depravity the unhinged Left will go, knows NO bounds. You folks are truly despicable
@tomcoates @kimba060764 @realDonaldTrump He's been through SIX background checks, plus the Dems and Feinstein had this letter in JULY and did Nothing about. Democrats deliberately leaked Dr. Ford's name, at the precise time they intended all along, solely to prolong the Confirmation. They have exploited this woman..
@tomcoates @kimba060764 @realDonaldTrump She took a polygraph, which surely you know is inadmissible, in her lawyer's office, with no one from the accused side present.... sure, that sounds completely fair and above board.  üëå  (and that's an OK emoji for the idiot's that claim it to be anything but)
@tomcoates @LindaLe33786642 @realDonaldTrump She admitted to two people being in the room with her when it "supposedly" happened, and BOTH have categorically denied it, so what the fuk is an investigation into a he said she said event that happened 35 years ago, while teens, and Drunk according to her, gonna prove?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Judge Kavanaugh is receiving the exact same threats, as is Senator Collins.They are ALL wrong, and should be condemned, so how about being fair and impartial and call out Everyone that threatens other people, regardless of their political affiliation. You exude hypocrisy Senator
@Martina @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure HRC is the one that actually Paid for dirt, (salacious and unverified) via an ex British spy, through his RUSSIAN connections, in order to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Americans, with the sole purpose of setting up a man they detest. That's the norm tho right?
@RepCummings There's no such thing as a lie detector test...
@KamalaHarris You had the accusation letter for over 2 months, and did NOTHING..  take your "we can't rush it" and stick it up your Bum. Testify Monday, like your lawyer asked for you to be able to do Dr Ford, and then hold the vote, Period. Enough with the typical Lefty political theater. SAD
@JuddLegum One major distinction dope, both Hill and Thomas were Federal employees, the charge from Ford from over 35 years ago, is NOT a Federal case, Period. They need go to the local Police Dept, and fill out a complaint. FBI has no jurisdiction, and by LAW cannot investigate such a case
@thesunandstorm @tony_okey @washingtonpost How are they doing the wrong thing? Her lawyer goes on TV asking that her client's voice be heard, and that she is willing to testify before the SJC, but after that request is granted a DAY later, via private or public hearing, she all of a sudden changes course? Boo Hoo. Testify
@2Hearts @washingtonpost Education Administrator...  God help those poor children.  A Hispanic/Jew, who's grandparents escaped Nazi Germany, is advocating for "white power/Nazi's"..  you can't make this shit up. You Libs are so unhinged and deranged, that you've lost all touch with reality &amp; common sense
@SenFeinstein Probably should have passed around a plate of condoms then, would have been much cheaper, and saved a human life from being destroyed...
@usualnotavail Not that I'm aware of, even tho I worked in Lake charles for 9 years...
@usualnotavail Yep. We were playing the Florida Gators.... we put pigs on there when we play Arkansas.
@surfbro26 @replouiegohmert Uhmm  Naw.  It's the ICIG who turned the report and evidence over to the FBI agent who was handling the Clinton Email Investigation... do you need to be schooled on who exactly that was?? (Hint..  he testified to his blatant BIAS in a congressional hearing)

@SpeakOutNow16 @SenFeinstein @NeilNklpkl @SenateDems So how is One Supreme Court Judge going to protect the POTUS?? Please expand....
@AP That's absolutely NOT what he said...   he said at the behest of a Candidate. You can draw your own conclusions, but report the FACTS for once. He never said Trump's name.
@ifindkarma @SoulFlyTry @ddale8 What exactly is "inhumane" about arresting someone that broke the law??  What an asinine statement...
@KayaJones @Spade_CutIn @angela_rye It's funny Kaya, how Obama was 50% African American, yet it made him 100% black in the eyes of that community, yet you're 25% black, and have ZERO right to claim that as part of your heritage..  Ironic to say the least don't ya think?
@valeryfan @KingBuckman29 @theblaze So because One POW has no problem burning our flag, it makes it right to do so? 3 generations of men serving this country and fighting in wars in my family, so yes it's offensive to see what we have sacrificed our blood, sweat and tears for being trashed, tarnished &amp; disrespected
@KingBuckman29 @valeryfan @theblaze Blindly??  Most American Patriots understand full well what that flag represents and the sacrifices it took to get there.. Dont the Canadiens have a flag and a national anthem as well??  Go disrespect your flag and country if you want, but dont lecture us for standing for OURS.
@ProudBulba Anyone wishing harm on ICE agents, or advocating for the abolishment of ICE, is profoundly IGNORANT. You're also pretty much advocating for child sex traffickers to go unchecked, as ICE is vastly responsible for stopping thousands of children from being sold as sex slaves. Moron

@WesthaverEmily You might want to get caught up on current events and discover the Truth behind this photo. You are pushing Fake News, but that's the norm with you delusional, out of touch Leftists..
@valeryfan @theblaze The U.S flag is NOT an idol, it's a symbol of freedom and independence. And a reminder of the countless lives lost and blood shed to defend those freedoms. If you truly look at our flag as just a "piece of cloth," then you truly are a Sad person.  You need a History lesson..
@Martina Here's one....  protest and actually DO something positive in the community to advance the dialogue between cops and the black community During the SEVEN months of the year they aren't working, and on game day, just Play the damn game!

@Martina The future "women" that are ripped out of their mothers' stomach and murdered would disagree with you....
@Martina You're on Twitter, kind of hard not to notice the numerous stories on her...   I'll answer for you, YES she is a racist, but your fellow Liberals glorify her and bolster her, because she is Asian and Not a Republican..  lowest black unemployment in history, that's so racist!
@Martina Just curious... is Sarah Jeong a racist in your opinion??
@chucktodd So Chucky, you're admitting that you and your colleagues intentionally spew Fake News then? You are spinning the President's FAKE News comments into  ALL News (all journalists) ... which is an example of why you actually are.. FAKE NEWS

@youngmike_83 @washingtonpost Lowest black unemployment in history... 29% approval among blacks, 3 times as high as any Republican President.... but he doesn't care about anyone.... smmhh  get off the Dem Plantation dude. #WalkAway
@Alyssa_Milano That's the most backhanded attempt at sincerity I've seen in a while. Who is "they"? The same people you just said "we have more in common"  with? And please expand on what "hurtful policies" have been attempted....
@SallyQYates So Sally, why did the unmasking of Americans go up by 360% in 2016? Why did you and your boss spy on so many Americans, then illegally unmask them?

@KamalaHarris What's the point? You Constitution hating, loathsome Lefties have already made clear you would vote against him, BEFORE his nomination was even official. He shouldn't even bother answering Any of the dumb ass questions you and your cohorts will ask him at his confirmation.
@Martina He's a business owner who is setting rules for his employees to follow while on company time. If that makes him a dictator in your eyes, then would you say the same of EVERY business owner in the country? No phones on the floor for my employees , does that make me a dictator?
@RealLucyLawless So what have these players done in their 6 month off season to improve relations between police and the black community?How many have supported or advocated for the 54 officers killed in the line of duty, 33 by gunfire, this year?NONE It's disrespectful as hell. #standfortheflag
@pattonoswalt @Martina That booming economy, Tax Cuts and Deregulation, record low unemployment, job surplus, manufacturing jobs returning, ISIS demolished, North Korea showing signs of cooperation, Terrible Iran deal axed, fair trade with EU, stronger military, judgeships.. OH MY GOD, IT'S HORRIFYING!
@ChrisMurphyCT Yet his 8 year average was 1.8%... 5 quarters at 4%, what about the other 27?  Again Chris, the only President in modern history NOT to average a 3% GDP in ANY year of his Presidency..So dont get it twisted. Worst recovery since the 40s. Trump's economic success drives ya'll nuts
@KamalaHarris Was it troubling when Obama did it?  I distinctly remember the press corps booing the journalist shouting questions, then cheering once he was escorted out.... if that didn't show how much the media was up Obama's ass at all times, nothing will. The Left's usual selective outrage
@SenJeffMerkley People are so incredibly Stupid to spin this into Sessions "chanting lock her up." Typical Liberal Bullshit, and their loyal puppets who are incapable of discerning that smell from clean air these days, as you folks continue to eat it up without using logic whatsoever. Lib=Fools
@GayPatriot I had L5 S1 fusion a year and a half ago, after suffering for 15 years from constant pain due to bulged discs. WORST decision I ever made in my life bro. I'd marry both ex wives again before having that surgery if I had it to do over again. Prayers for a better outcome than mine.
@BlaineWHardaway @rmayemsinger @FoxNews #WalkAway.   What high road is that? Harassing people in public, assaulting teens and a Congresswoman encouraging mob mentality? Some high road you folks take..  Get off the Plantation before it's too late. #WalkAway
@dbongino Dopey Hollywood elitists who play make believe for a living, while supporting and shielding pedophiles.......   fixed it for you Dan
@KamalaHarris Didn't it demand the same then in 2014 when Devin Nunes warned Obama that Russia was targeting the election... and then again in 2016 when the Obama administration learned of Russia hacking the DNC? It was ok back then right, considering there was NO way in hell HRC would lose ü§î
@jules_su @Martina Visual aid for the completely naive and braindead folk like you.....  all just convenient coincidences I guess? https://t.co/A9dATGqwhV
@morganOPINES @kmmpom @Tracy_S_Webster @pekcsa @CJtheFIneArtist @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump So we should continue to pay twice as much as we are supposed to, while countries like Germany pay half as much?? Yep, getting countries who promised to pay 2% of their GDP to actually Pay the 2%, is CRAZY. How dare the POTUS make such outrageous requests!

RT @JoshMeyerDC: Sometimes one interesting story leads to another. Last year I wrote about how some U.S. govt probes into global drug traff‚Ä¶
@KamalaHarris Our "system" is about the rule of law, and interpreting Constitutional Law in accordance to uhmm... the CONSTITUTION. Our "system" isnt "Suposed" to be about feelings and opinions, it's about the LAW, something Liberals would know nothing about.
@SenFeinstein The definition of extremist is authoring a Bill that would prohibit the detaining or questioning of anyone with child coming into this country illegally, up to one hundred miles from the border... That's the epitome of disservice to our country. Oh wait, that was YOU wasn't it??
@galincal @Impeach_Trump00 @RepThomasMassie @WalshFreedom @Jim_Jordan @thedailybeast You dopes..  when you are on college athletic teams, men use locker room showers after their matches or games to takes showers, that includes coaches.. This was common 25 years ago, I can attest to that first hand. It's not gross or inappropriate, it's what sports teams did. Dumb
@IPM_Prime @FancyNancy2018 @SenSanders #WalkAway
@KamalaHarris You arrested drug traffickers.... when were you a cop, DEA or FBI agent exactly?	Announced the arrests... so people did the leg work and you get the credit?	Confiscated 500lbs of meth... again when were you a cop, DEA or FBI agent? 	 Stop taking the credit for others' work..

@LiliTor23950940 @thehill @FoxNews So PP murdering a 1000 babies a day is ok, but parents who cross 2000 miles through one country, to enter another country ILLEGALLY,  and Temporarily separated from their child while being processed, is inhumane??  OK
@LiliTor23950940 @thehill @FoxNews Oh well damn, you must hate Planned Parenthood like no other then..
@LiliTor23950940 @thehill @FoxNews So people you disagree with are tyrants? Hmm. Good to know
@LiliTor23950940 @thehill @FoxNews When you call for people to confront, and form a crowd at someone's home or while they're out shopping, eating or pumping gas...  WTF would you call that exactly? Is that civil discourse according to the Left?  Smhh
@Alyssa_Milano @PressSec @AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump Because Liberals are afraid of diversity of opinion, and can only surround themselves with like minded people. You love to lecture folks on guns, while being protected by people With guns.. Your Liberal elitist mentality is a prime example of why Trump won, and will again in 2020
@Alyssa_Milano @PressSec @AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump Alyssa,  next time you shoot your fledging series Project Runway All Stars, make sure you ask all the possible contestants who they voted for, their political affiliation and if their beliefs align with yours, then tell any1 with a descending opinion they aren't welcome...
@eileenmarie221 @1024DrPepper @SDepreyPurper @Wizardfkap @morningmika @DHSgov @VP @POTUS44 @POTUS Do you honestly think the Liberal Media would accurately, and Without bias, report on a story, or stories, that would reflect negatively on Obama and his Administration??

@baridapoi @patteeemac @JoyAnnReid Awwhh  poor thing. "The big bad dumb Republican people hate minorities" skit.. Too afraid to educate yourself enough to get off that Demicrat Plantation that's held your people down for decades huh? Continue drinking the kool aid the Left gives you bro, you make a good lil Dem
@JoyAnnReid As a media personality (Not journalist) where was your outrage during the Obama Admin? Kids crammed in jail cells and dog kennels, yet you propagandists and your fellow Liberal promoting MSM cohorts were Silent. You folks are inflicted with selective outrage, YOU being the Worst https://t.co/9GRbuc9TlX
@peg_mclaugh Wow. Embracing mob mentality.  You folks should be so proud of yourselves. Your ancestors must come from Salem...  anyone celebrating this has obviously never learned that 2 wrongs dont make a right, and are quite pathetic to cheer on mobs full of people attacking someone.

@Zac_Petkanas @FoxNews How about being enraged that the (supposed) parent would put their mentally challenged CHILD at risk by marching many miles through harsh conditions to violate The Law?
@AndrewFeinberg @NaomiYoungstein @Lawrence Nope, you do it it to promote your highly offensive and extremely partisan agendas. Your ideas of your "job" entails being defensive, divisive, derogatory, degrading, disrespectful and quite frankly a dick. Journalism is dead, and folks like you have made it a complete farce.
@Martina She didn't answer because Brian is a petulant little Bitch that has no integrity as a Journalist, or supposedly unbiased member of the White House Press Corp.He was not called upon, he blurted out innuendoes, and was absolutley out of line.And she did answer, they chose to ignore
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes I'm wrong to be cautiously optimistic? Don't quite understand your logic. So the future is always predicated on the past, is that what you believe?  Circumstance change all the time sir. And thank you for your service!
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes You may not consider yourself on the "Left," but you sure take their talking points to bolster your TDS. Trump Never "promised" to remove our troops, that's just complete B.S. spin propaganda, he said he'd LIKE to Eventually if Kim is delivering on his promises, YUGE difference.
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes As a country that is trying to rid a dictator of nuclear weapons... that's not projection, that's a FACT.. Now you can listen to the lunatic media spin it into terrible things all you want, but facts are facts. Trying to prevent nuclear war is a GOOD thing. Sky is falling Left üôÑ
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes You're "assuming" by thinking there's absolutely Zero chance Kim does what he says, are you not? Only hyper partisan quacks would think it's for sure going to happen, or that there's no chance in hell it'll happen. If your a rational person, you'd be cautiously optimistic, period
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes We hold two exercises a year, we've already had one, and the other isn't scheduled til later in the year.. we haven't given up ANYTHING. Stopping that ONE war excersise is dependent on tangible proof of Kim doing what he said he's going to do. MSM blows it out of proportion. SPIN
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes I'm going to assume you "tooted" Obama's horn after the atrocious Iran deal? What have we exactly "sacrificed" by meeting with Kim? People no longer have the ability to look through NON partisan glasses, and it's quite discouraging. Cautiously Optimistic, is how we ALL shld feel.
@WatcherWho @TimCrosbyJr @nytimes I wasn't comfortable with it, but with that being said, in order to get a World threat to change course and denuclearize, you HAVE to do some uncomfortable things.
@TimCrosbyJr @WatcherWho @nytimes The sufferers of TDS can no longer decipher between hope and optimism, and doom and gloom. They are glass half empty people, unless it was Obama in this situation, then we all know they would be kissing his Ass. It's impossible for them to find ANYTHING positive from this admin.
@Mind4Mud @CNN The only people drinking kool aid are folks like you that suffer from TDS. Leftist MSM puppets proclaiming Kim got everything he wanted, while we didn't,FOOLISH. Anyone praising Trump as a hero,FOOLISH.If you're intelligent, you look at this with CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM, not party bias
@mitchellreports @NBCNews @CNN and Soros controlled Leftist media, does such a good job with filling their studios with the most hateful and delusional people possible. How many meetings did you all hold to get your "how Trump got played" narrative in order? Your hatred is stronger than the Truth
@BrianThomasCox @nytimes Release of 3 hostages, dismantling of a nuclear test site, no missles fired or tested in months, strong sanctions still in place,  commitment to full denuclearization, promise to turn over Americans remains from Korean War, closing of an energy site. nothing, HA you're delusional
@nytimes How is it possible Liberals can be so completely ignorant? It takes great dishonesty and hatred to proclaim a Kim "win" based on that alone, after what N.K has given up already, plus the numerous concessions agreed upon, including the DENUCLEARIZATION of the  Peninsula. So Dumb..
@Mind4Mud @CNN First of all, they weren't banned, they were disinvited after 80% backed out.. 2nd, how the fuk does a football team compare to negotiating the DENUCLEARIZATION of country that posed a Threat to the U.S. and the world? Peace talks..or football..? Hmmm, tough one.

@KamalaHarris It takes courage to lay down in the isle of a grocery store, blocking paying customers from continuing their shopping?? Sorry Kam, but the way I was raised, it was called throwing a childish TANTRUM, which would normally mean a spanking when dad got home! Disrespectful twits..
@gmukunda @hawki2002 @brithume So what do you then call HRC and the DNC Paying for information obtained from a former British spy, through his RUSSIAN contacts in order to interfere with a political opponent and his campaign? Nonetheless the phony thing was used to obtain FISA warrants.. ??
@wilw @JoyAnnReid If they have a problem showing respect to a country that affords them the opportunity to make millions playing a game... Well F..K em, maybe they should Move! The owners didn't hyper-politicize the anthem, the players did, thus the reason for the sharp decrease in viewership. USA
@BlockstarBenji @aVeryRichBish @TomiLahren Momma must be so proud...   such a scholar and a gentleman....   Degenerate scum
@Martina It's funny how you folks will boycott an organization that receives ZERO federal dollars, and kills ZERO people, yet fully support an organization that receives millions from the government, while murdering 1000's every DAY..   Lefty Logic
@JoyAnnReid And 10,000 X that number have been ripped from the womb and slaughtered, the vast majority being African American....  That is YOUR America JoJo...
@davidfrum @TheAtlantic NOTHING..  yet Trump is the one getting played?  First he was gonna start a nuclear war because of his harsh words about Kim, now he's getting played because Kim is posturing, as always, on the heels of an historic summit with Trump? You dopes actually want him to fail.Disgusting
@davidfrum @TheAtlantic You Leftists are such fools..  How the hell has Trump been duped exactly? We've tightened sanctions on N.K, gotten China to strengthen theirs, secured the release of 3 American hostages, got them to start decommissioning a nuclear test site. so what concessions have we given up?
@VAHNNNN @JoyAnnReid Move to Syria...  or learn history.
@JoyAnnReid Ask your hero Obama, since he did the exact same thing...
@JesseLehrich Where in that article did it say they would be held in warehouses?? And it's funny how you Leftist morons completely gloss over the fact that Obama did the same damn thing... SLECTIVE outrage and absolute spin.
@kellynoll71 @JoyAnnReid You need to study up on your world history lady... comparing this country to Nazi Germany does a huge disservice to those that fought the Axis powers, and those that died, including the more than six million innocent Jews.

You are a clueless FRAUD.. SMMHH
@SenKamalaHarris You know what's immoral Kammi, killing 3000 innocent Americans and boasting about it. You stand on a pedestal as if you are so superior, when you slept your way to public office. Scum that cut off American's heads for sport, don't Deserve compassion, sympathy or jobs, you leach.
@SenFeinstein Yet you had no problem voting to approve her BOSS Brennan, who had more of a role  implementing "enhanced interrogation" policies than she did?? Guess we should have just coddled the person's responsible for killing 3000 Americans, maybe offer them jobs. You spineless buffoon.
@PiperPerabo @whca Pretty sure Trump took questions from the press today, and pretty sure Sarah took dozens of questions, including hacks like Jim Acosta, so how have they silenced the press exactly? You Far Left loons are completely unhinged and deranged.  But I do miss covert affairs..
@Martina How exactly are we "kissing up" to N.K? Trump applies sanctions, gets China to apply pressure, calls him "little rocket man" and "fire &amp; fury"  Left---OMG he's gonna cause nuclear war! Now coming to the table over disarmament is kissing up? LOL, can you Libs make up your minds??
@Alyssa_Milano Look forward to attending your rally against Planned Parenthood, being that they have a stronghold on the government and all... well Dems anyway. So please let us know when that will be held, Thanks...
@Alyssa_Milano Well it takes "common sense" to be able to discuss "common sense" gun regulation... You can start by learning what the hell an AR-15 is, the caliber bullet used, and it's firing rate or rounds per minute... Do some research, and then talk to us about "common sense" gun regs. Hun
@MSNBC Earth shattering reporting once again by MSLSD....  Where's your story calling for a Logan Act Violation for Kerry sneakily meeting with Iranian and French officials, begging for his former boss's legacy (or lack thereof,) and his Idiotic Iranian deal, to be kept in place??
@Montel_Williams @DiamondandSilk How original.  A black Liberal Man degrading two Black Conservative Women for their beliefs..   just another prime example of the ever so tolerant and loving Left.  Now remind me again who the Party of Hate is?
@ChrisMurphyCT How bout you start with the names of those killed in Chicago alone under your Messiah Obama...
@PiperPerabo @davism0llie The generation that needs cry closets on campus, safe spaces to cry and vent because they can't handle diverse opinion... the generation that eats tide pods or snorts condoms up their noses??  God help us all
@Martina No....  it's something called MORALS..

@st_mulberry @MaryAnnalmeida5 @stopthenutjob @realDonaldTrump The guy that Knowingly sent 4 innocent men to prison, 2 of which died, in order to protect White Bulger??...  yeah, so so honorable.
@TVietor08 @fshakir Hey moron, she broke no laws, as the Obama DOJ who Investigated her confirms. Water boarding was legal at the time, whether you like it or not. She oversaw black sites that performed TWO waterboardings over her 30 year career. GTFOH with your Lefty outrage Bullshit.

Don't be mad at Jesus boo, be mad at yourself..
@NicolleDWallace @JoyAnnReid So she's an apologetic homophobe then?....  OK, she's the kindest and most loving person on earth now! What great humility it must take to apologize for being a bigoted homophobe. Nobel Peace Prize next maybe? üñí
@CheriJacobus @vincent_riggin @kennithbinge @KimKardashian How can someone Supposedly educated, sound so ignorant? Any media outlet that hires you as a "journalist," loses all credibility as a news source. Your continued attacks on people who disagree with your views, shows just how unintelligent you are. Typical Far Left Quack.
@GlendaKlein13 @nytimes So hate, bigotry, anti-Semitism and racism didn't exist until Trump?? Uhhhm OK.. and we are a Constitutional Republic, with AMERICAN values, which includes Democratic, Republican, Liberal, Conservative and Independent values and beliefs.. thank goodness we are free to choose.
@GlendaKlein13 @nytimes Anyone that compares Trump to Hitler, is seriously void of historical knowledge, or in other words, quite ignorant. Just by suggesting such, tarnishes the lives of 6 million Jews slaughtered, as well as the millions that died fighting monsters such as Hitler, Mussolini &amp; Hirohito
@RobinRoese @KittenRescuer @alankd @LauraHo75257337 @gr_1214 @GovMikeHuckabee She also forgot to blame herself...
@KamalaHarris You finally said something I agree with..

@KimKoskella @SallyQYates They've already "topped" Trump, I'm sure they bottomed him to... Good thing having consenting sex isn't a crime, neither is an attorney arranging an NDA...
@ChrisMurphyCT What did you all do when you controlled all three branches of government? There are several rulers/dictators that act in similar fashion, are we suppose to go to war with them all? Are we supposed to send CIA to kill them all? You talk shit about POTUS, yet have ZERO answers.
@AshikJ @shorn2222 @justinamash Obama authorized over 500 drone strikes, and yes they drop Bombs, in Pakistan, Somolia and Yemen, killing close to 800 civilians.. So of your theory that congressional approval is needed, where was it? And he ordered over 26,000 bombs be dropped in 2016 ALONE, where was Congress?
@SenSanders Of the over 26,000 bombs dropped in 2016 ALONE, during tye Obama reign, how many of them were protested by the Democrat party? 563 strikes in Pakistan, Yemen &amp;Somalia, killing nearly 800 civilians, how often did YOU vote on those strikes? Hypocrite much Bern?
@TheMrMilan @JoyAnnReid Not ashamed at all. On the other hand, those idiots that voted for Obama should be ashamed, after all, he and his administration lied to us by saying they removed all chemical weapons from Syria, while also threatening a "red line" and doing NOTHING. It's A strike, not war..
@JoyAnnReid Hey NITWIT, "American military might" is being deployed because of a raging lunatic that insists on releasing chemical weapons on his own people! STUPID. If this was Obummer, you'd be praising him. You are an embarrassment to your profession. Wacko spin artist...

@Martina Maybe one day they'll lead a "we need better parenting with fathers being involved," Or a "officials ask for people to see something say something, yet they do Nothing," marches... yea, that'll never happen.. Istead let's attack an organization, and call for the end of 2A, smhh

@mercurialmissm So pretending to have a gun and pointing it at pedestrians, and then the police, is perfectly normal to you? He's culpable in his own death, period. Easy to say what "should have been done, but that's hindsight, you have no clue what it's like being put in that position.
@JoyAnnReid He was armed with a pipe and threatening people, Including the cops, as tho it was firearm.... IDIOT. Race baiting piece of trash..
@mercurialmissm @NeoColonizer @nytimes Become a cop then. Answer dozens of calls for help every day, answer the call of someone pointing a gun at folks, approach said person, see him take a firing stance with a shiny object in his hand, and then don't do anything and wait to see what the object is, you won't last long

@timpatflanagan @nytimes @BillOReilly So an entire company, employing thousands of people, are to blame for one person's questionable actions? Well damn, CNN is fu**ed then....
@jillthewhat @LindaStarr @washingtonpost Isn't that what news papers are all about these days, Opinions and unnamed sources? Sorry, but inserting opinions into supposedly "integral media outlets," has only led to the downfall of trust and patience with our neighbors, news media and strangers that believe differently.
@Rzhevsky @sandee0802 @balthsbart @InfiniteBastard @DumblikeTrump @Pammy_Layne @PenceConscience @realDonaldTrump Good luck with that...
@Rzhevsky @sandee0802 @balthsbart @InfiniteBastard @DumblikeTrump @Pammy_Layne @PenceConscience @realDonaldTrump Awwwhh. Poor thing. Do you need a therapy dog and some coloring books and crayons to ease your broken heart?
@Rzhevsky @sandee0802 @balthsbart @InfiniteBastard @DumblikeTrump @Pammy_Layne @PenceConscience @realDonaldTrump And the only one who admitted she was never proud of her country.....
@Martina @davidfrum @soledadobrien So you disagree with a message, but being that that message makes sense, you must attack the sentence structure of said message, instead of addressing the message and it's content to begin with..... classic Liberalism
@JoyAnnReid There you go with your race baiting, hate pushing Bullshit again... Your dumbassery and hate knows no limit. There is a large mass of people marching directly towards our border, but you turn it into a race issue?? You're such a f****ing Tool.

@kebousquet @JYSexton Over 18 million people disagree with you....
@JoyAnnReid @therealroseanne has more talent on her ass freckle that you will ever have JoJo. Funny tho, that the ever so tolerant, pro women, pro black/minority, pro gay, morally superior Leftists, viciously attack any and all of those groups of people when they call themselves Conservative
@HarleyRouda @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And yet you Fail to respond to the idiocy of your dumb ass Govenor letting 5 Illegal FELONS out on the street to reoffend, instead a) keeping them in jail, or b) allowing ICE to deport them, so how do you, as an AMERICAN, justify these actions?? Hint.... YOU CAN'T

@JoyAnnReid So the facts in the case mean nothing to you Joy? You just easily gloss right over them to form your "racist, anti cop," divisive narrative. Good thing DA's and grand juries use logic and fact to form their decision, instead of emotion.
@JoyAnnReid How is a washed out, mentally disturbed person's cartoon scribble culturally relevant JoJo?  Hate scribble is now culturally relevant......  only in the quixotic mind of you foolish Libs..
@PlatoCase @cameron_kasky Great response...  take it you support school bullies then. Make sure you cuddle up to your pussy cat for emotional support. Snowflake
@cameron_kasky Your friend Emma admitted to bullying Cruz, and gloated about it, saying he deserved it... when will you lecture her on the psychological damage causes by bullying??
@RealJamesWoods I think she should make a sex tape James... she's so money hungry, she might be able to scrape up a few dollars from that venture, or it could just be another option for a hobby ??
@BuckSexton Sorry, but any list that does not include Morgan Freeman is a travesty.

@johnpavlovitz @TomiLahren Hmmmm. So what does that say about the thousands of people who denigrate her on a daily basis? Here's a thought, if you don't like what she says, or what she represents, Don't follow or read her tweets.. Problem solved
@KamalaHarris WTF?? Is that a coherent thought?

@JoyAnnReid You are a highly delusional, fear mongering, propaganda pushing, egotistical, fake news loving, racist, clueless, brain dead mean girl... LOL
@Martina Why should he waste a breath talking about a porn star he may or may not have banged 12 years ago? Folks on the Left live in Lala Land. The same folks that publicly shamed every Clinton accuser, are the same folks that denigrate a man over a CONSENSUAL sexual encounter.Hypocrites
@Martina They're not kids....
@Rpcchen @CNN Can't the same be said about why people voted for HRC? It's funny you folks excuse her, and her husband's actions, yet salivate with vengeful glee over a grown billionaire having Consunsual sex with a porn star 12 years ago. HA. Typical SLECTIVE moral outrage, perfected by Left
@janflake71 @novagirl87 @USCG_Veteran @KDedoszak @WalshFreedom And thank you for that, and for what you do. I apologize if my question was stated in a disrespectful manner. I'm glad kids get to have their voices heard, that's a good thing, I just think the political atmosphere is so volatile, that many are being used for party agendas.
@kurteichenwald @MeghanMcCain You are what's wrong with society these days Gollum.. To think that it's perfectly normal for 16 and 17 year olds to drop F bombs with regularity, and on national tv, is called bad parenting, or Liberal norms. Meghan is a grown adult, big difference.
@novagirl87 @janflake71 @USCG_Veteran @KDedoszak @WalshFreedom Politics of teachers Does matter, when they force it on our impressionable kids. That's Not their job, it's our job as parents to instill values and beliefs, and to allow them to form their own. I don't send my kids to school to have a teacher bash, or praise Trump..not their job
@GinaScreen @kurteichenwald What's the point in owning a handgun? Being that they are 97% more likely to kill you than an AR. I know 3 people that own a AR15, they are avid target shooters, that's their hobbies and passion. They are extremely safe gun owners, so why should they be forced to give them up?
@novagirl87 @janflake71 @USCG_Veteran @KDedoszak @WalshFreedom How do you know, if they "know," anything about the Constitution, or that they have a knowledge of historical protests? Marching in a protest doesn't make them knowledgeable about squat. My question tho, was if she teaches without personal and politically motivated biases.
@GinaScreen @kurteichenwald So people who own "assault rifles" have them in order to shoot someone? Your question has No legitimacy, Period. Owning a gun doesn't translate to "wanting to shoot someone," that's nonsense.
@janflake71 @USCG_Veteran @KDedoszak @WalshFreedom So You teach... Do you teach your students how to be good little Liberals, or do you do your job correctly and Only teach the subject in which you were hired to accurately and honestly, and without personal bias? These kids are being used by politically motivated vultures, Period
@USCG_Veteran @WalshFreedom You forgot that they can't even write in cursive, have no clue what AR stands for, can't define "assault rifle," can't point to an AR15 out of a picture of 5 different rifles, they are oblivious that no soldier chooses that as his weapon of choice in war, yet they lecture us? Smh
@JuliaYo3466 @kurteichenwald L O L
@joke2power @kurteichenwald You people are beyond DUMB
@kurteichenwald Can you even define "military style weapons" you nimrod? No one in the military would go to battle with an AR-15, FACT. People who own these guns don't want to shoot our soldiers, what an incredibly Ignorant and asinine thing to say, you Fake Ass Faux Partisan Hack "journalist"üñï
@PiperPerabo They are great salespeople for the NRA.. Since these kids have been in the spotlight, rambling on about policies and guns of which they have no clue, they've managed to encourage over 500,000 people to join the NRA.. so congrats to those children.#2A #NRA #MSDStrong
@Mamaofthreebear @JoeNBC Where is the Lefty outrage when it comes to Liberals accepting millions from Planned Parenthood, who kill 900 lives EVERY DAY? You folks are such hypocrites. What's worse is, they receive Federal dollars, and turn aroound and spend 30 million backing Democrat candidates, such BS
@davidhogg111 So when will you call out all the Lefty politicians that accept money from Planned Parenthood, a Federally funded organization that murders 900 lives every DAY..  You have no problem being a disrespectful punk to Senator Rubio, but you're silent about PP shills? Hypocrite much?
@realDonaldTrump If you are truly for the forgotten, working class of this country, and believe in keeping to your promises and conservative values, you will absolutely VETO this garbage of an Omnibus..
@SpeakerRyan You are a sellout, you RINO fool.
@TalbertSwan @PressSec @POTUS Braindead, brainwashed zombie Lefty robot alert.......
@TalbertSwan @PressSec @POTUS Are you talking about Obama?  He divided this country &amp; was unqualified. You call yourself a Bishop, yet call a Woman working tirelessly for this country, a psychopath.... You are a prime example of why people loath Christians in this country, and that's coming from one...
@funder @Martina @realDonaldTrump So a billionaire who had a number one rated tv show got a ton of ass...... WHOOPI. The Left showing their typical selective outrage...
@KamalaHarris You always love tweeting what we can "no longer allow," or what we "can no longer accept," but you NEVER tweet solutions, answers or proposals to combat the things you rail against.
@maddow Hey Rachel Jones/Koresh, keep serving your flock that kool aid, you'll run out of flavors eventually....
@Lawrence This is a man that is sick of YOU folks in the lying, corrupt, Propagandist media that have pushed this FAKE Trump/Russia "collusion" Bullshit for nearly two years, with not a shred of evidence.A phony concoction created by Obama Admin appointees, who uses you MSM fools as shills
@JoyAnnReid YOU are fake news JoJo...  I'll give you a journalism/ethics 101 crash course, since you're clearly clueless, that is called an OPINION, there's nothing Factual about it. Get a clue, and stop using your platform to spread hate and division...
@kurteichenwald  https://t.co/vGL5LNLafm
@ChrisMurphyCT Didn't you sit in on a televised discussion on the gun debate with the President? Aren't you in the Senate? Where's your proposal? Is it everyone else's responsibility to come up with solutions? Help to resolve, instead of blaming and bitching Senator..
@kurteichenwald Such an ignorant, irrational and false statement to make, but that's how you folks operate. ONE man, John Kennedy, is filing for a Bill that would do such, NOT the GOP rushing to do so.. Idiot. Also the House just passed a bipartisan school safety Bill YESTERDAY didn't they? Hack
@JoyAnnReid So if we as parents would rather our kids (KIDS) stay in school and learn, instead of being used as shills to promote a Leftist agenda, we are not rational people?? Are these the kids you you support...https://t.co/vrj7j5cLDt

@JoyAnnReid Says someone who supported a Clinton.. ha. And it's funny that you foul folks in the media denigrate, name call, label, slander and mock President Trump and his family EVERY day, yet are so outraged and shocked when he goes on the offensive.. LOL wahhh
@tombrokaw So you folks in the media, you so called journalists, can denigrate and slander President Trump and his family every single day, and be outraged when he goes on the offensive? Get over yourself Tom..
@blazingxmexican @JoyAnnReid Where's your facts to support your claim?
@wellendowedpaul @GovMikeHuckabee Hey fuktard, who's targeting, or deporting DACA folks?? And you forgot one word, as every Liberal nut job does, so I'll fix for you... ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.. Do you know what the word ILLEGAL means? Oakland mayor protected Illegal Criminals from ICE, Not DACA folks, you dope.
@KamalaHarris Here's your California Kami....https://t.co/oZsNFoEIZk
@KamalaHarris You can keep that future in your Looney Toons Land of a State, and keep it the hell out of mine. How bout You protect the interests and safety of AMERICANS instead of shielding criminal Illegal aliens. You Liberals are freaking nutjobs, and so far removed from reality. Just Gross

@58isthenew40 @REALStaceyDash @TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Factually Incorrect... but it's easier for folks on the Left, or Trump haters, to spread horse manure they hear from MSM rather than do a little research on their own... Do some research Nasty Woman..

@GrillMa95717461 @JoyAnnReid @NettieMuse Well ya know, you're never gonna be forced to so..  It's not about arming every Paul Blart teacher or professor, it's about giving a Choice to those that are well versed and trained in gun ownership and responsibility, to receive further training to protect themselves &amp; students
@JoyAnnReid That's becsuse you surround yourself with nothing but like minded, Far Left, America haters. I'm sure you also you know No one that has grown up around guns their entire life, are members of the NRA, and are trained, so of course instead of understanding them, you ridicule &amp; mock
@kdonohuenj @JoyAnnReid How so? Do you know her personally?
@JoeB2112 @stonecold2050 @beeby0420 Betcha he's more relevant than you bro...
@Momof3gngrs @Tutone731 @SenFeinstein This is not pertained to "dreamers".The Oakland mayor didn't give a damn if those folks had prior convictions or not, how is that protecting Americans? After a raid the other day, out of 230 people, 183 had been convicted of a crime, yet idiot Libs CHOOSE to protect them over us.
@JoyAnnReid Did i miss something? When did the trade wars start? Pretty sure that tarrifs haven't even been enacted yet, so how exactly are we currently on a trade war? Oh you pitiful Leftist propagandists.. you folks are so sad, dishonest, morally repugnant &amp; without journalistic integrity.
@TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/ogzkNJiIXM
@JoyAnnReid And the people that choose to make it into a personal "dark mark" are Far Left smear campaign leaders such as yourself and your fellow MSM cohorts. You people have sunk so low, that instead of simply disagreeing with those that have differing views,you attack them personally, SAD
@PattyMurray Our country did? Hmmm, I don't remember having a vote on that... hell I don't even remember YOU having a vote on it. Your play on words, or typical Lefty Spin, are quite self serving, however factually WRONG.
@Ilovecucks2 @RussBarbee @RepMarkMeadows Imagine the NRA getting $500 million in Federal funding, then spending tens of millions on numerous Republican candidates, you folks on the Left would be Livid, so what's the difference? NO entity receiving Fed $ should be allowed to donate to a political party or candidate..
@Ilovecucks2 @RussBarbee @RepMarkMeadows Less than 2% of cancer screenings performed on women, that's miniscule, Period, 330,000 babies killed each year, 900 a day, that is Not. They should not get ANY of my tax money, or any Federal funding, when they're going to use $ to back political candidates. That's just wrong
@RussBarbee @RepMarkMeadows PP doesn't perform a single mammogram, they make up less than 2% of all women's cancer screenings in the U.S, they refer only ONE out of 160 abortions for adoption, and they murder 900 babies a day... No more taxpayer money! 	https://t.co/FfB4a2XtBB
@hellboy2112 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Pretty sure that was Obummer....
@REALStaceyDash Thank you Stacey. Don't get lost in the swamp, and the world of special interest groups and lobbyists. Stand firm behind your Conservative values and principles, and we will all stand behind you, and be here to support you. Go get em Congresswoman Dash!It's
@CharmsMisfit @JoyAnnReid @Winterishere974 When did he say he wasn't going to do it? If any of you hateful sheeple actually watched Trump's round table discussion Today with various House and Senate Leaders, you would know that he himself suggested raising the age despite what the NRA thinks. It's up to Congress, not DJT.
@JoyAnnReid Did you not listen to a word he said during the round table discussion TODAY? That's your problem, a story form a "source" on Sunday, takes precedent over words spoken directly from Trump's mouth Today, that contradicts it, that's why you have ZERO credibility. Stop the hate Joy.
@No_BS_Dem @JoyAnnReid @KottiPillar It may not have always been objective, but the divisive, highly partisan ways of today are nowhere near what it's been it the past, and I'm talking about Both sides. Russia accomplished exactly what they wanted, and the clueless media are complicit in dividing us, like they want.
@No_BS_Dem @JoyAnnReid @KottiPillar They didn't all have agendas 25 years ago, not to the extent they do today. I don't remember any of my History, Government or Jornalism professors that forced their opinions on us. My 1st cousin is a Liberal, Femenist Professor who tells me she has no qualms pushing her views..
@closg84 @JoyAnnReid Tell me what Fox News personality has, on air, called this President, or past for that matter, a racist, bigot, homophobe, anti-semite, sexist, mentally ill, unfit, ignorant or stupid, like Joy and her fellow MSLSD and CNNot constituents have, on air no less..
@No_BS_Dem @JoyAnnReid @KottiPillar *interjecting*
@No_BS_Dem @JoyAnnReid @KottiPillar As someone with a journalism degree, I can assure you journalism as we knew it, is dead. There's no way she could objectively teach a course, without intersecting her beliefs and political opinions. That's not hating, that's just truth. Ethics no longer apply to the media.
@Martina Curious Martina, do you think it's appropriate to destroy a family, and there business for politely declining to bake a cake, based on their Religous view that marriage is between a man and a woman? I'm just curious what your belief is on that..
@emmieloulou88 @Martina @LottieShed Damn, that sounds just like the ever so tolerant, morally superior, label those that have different views than you, never wrong, blame everyoje else Liberals..
@No_BS_Dem @JoyAnnReid @KottiPillar God help us all if that's the case.....  Teacher of Propaganda maybe..
@JoyAnnReid You are the most delusional, fear mongering, unethical, propaganda pushing, fake news person in media... you wouldn't know the Truth if it hit you in the face. You are so full of hate, that you believe your own Bullshit. Sad
@edwardstevens06 @RepMarkMeadows They are a product of a witch hunt that has absolutely ZERO to do with the basis for the phony investigation, that's what they are.they only Russian "collusion" that's been Proven thus far, is the HRC campaign colluding with Russia, through an ex British spy..
@brown6023 @MattWittig @WalshFreedom So even tho AR's account for less than TWO% of all gun death's, you have a better chance of surviving a shot from a 9mm, so therefore they are less dangerous than an AR? I'm sorry, but that argument makes no sense.
@MattWittig @WalshFreedom I think most rational people would agree there needs to be reform, however, punishing the vast majority that are law abiding, doesn't seem to me, to be a sensible solution. The breakdown of the school, Sheriff's Dept and the FBI, to communicate and act, &amp; use NICS,was detrimental
@MattWittig @WalshFreedom Even tho a hand gun is 98% More likely to kill you than an AR 15? How many people do you know own an AR? I know 3, that grew up around guns their whole life, are the absolute safest gun owners I know, and have a passion for target shooting, so they should be punished?
@Lawrence What an ignorant, absolutely false, purely rooted in hatred thing to say, and no less coming from someone in the media.. You Leftists live in an alternate universe, it's quite sad and pathetic. Always placing blame on others, while never acknowledging wrong doings by your party.
@JoyAnnReid Have you blamed the actual shooter yet Joy? Why is it always everybody else's fault except the person who actually commited the offense?     And how does the "gun lobby" make you live a certain way.. makes no damn sense..
@SenJackReed Wht didn't Obumma do anything when he found out Russia was buying adds for, and against, EACH candidate?? Oh yeah, that's right, he knew they had the win in the bag, so he didn't GAF..
@JoyAnnReid Russia Russia Russia. So you mean the same Russian trolls that coordinated Never Trump rallies, which YOU and your delusional network covered so enthusiastically? Wouldn't that make YOU a stooge for Putin? Fact; pro &amp; con adds were taken out on BOTH candidates, get over it.
@LizHG @bailey8169 @ProudResister @Robevans813 @NRA @MetLife @symantec @LifeLock @BestWestern @Wyndham @Alamo @NationalPro @Enterprise @FNBOmaha @Hertz @Budget @Avis @NortonOnline @northAmericanVL @alliedvl @SimpliSafe @ChubbNA @united @Delta @TrueCar @amazon @FedEx @Apple @Google Assault rifles make up less than TWO% of those killed by gun related violence in this country every year, yet the Left acts outraged as if it was 98%, yet say nothing about urban hand gun violence. Young black men being shot doesn't fit their political narrative. Fake outrage
@ann_malbon @JoyAnnReid @marcorubio "Assault rifles" make up less than TWO percent of gun related deaths in this country... so tell me how exactly that are worse than hand guns? The Left need to educate themselves instead of spewing emotional rhetoric.
@JoyAnnReid You're so hell bent on pushing your divisive narrative, that the point he was trying to make went totally over your head.
@robertlash4 @KamalaHarris Talking about the Left...You're right, they want nothing but Dems teaching our children, and instilling in them the victim mentality, where it's always someone else's fault, and that they are owed something, and must rely on government for everything, and to label the opposition
@NancyPelosi  https://t.co/XrR8DH4vOI
@CandiMathis @MrNashvilleTalk @CNN More than 30 people are shot and killed EVERY day in this country, so where is the call to ban pistols, being that they cause more deaths each day by a landslide? You know why.. because much of that is young black men, and the Left could give two shits about them.
@kurteichenwald So then why does your party do it so often? Those that compare the U.S and Trump to Nazi Germany and Hitler, are just absolutely Ignorant to History, Period. Dumb people just spew the hateful rhetoric given them by people like you and the rest of the Propagandist, unethical media
@BgentlewUrself @eltrophyhusband @KamalaHarris "Donating"
@BgentlewUrself @eltrophyhusband @KamalaHarris And that's different form the Democrat party how exactly? Would you like a list of the lobbyist and groups that donate to the Left? Soros's crazy ass...  and the NRA is NOT even in the top FIFTY of damaging organizations...	https://t.co/WBQ5t4nVIX
@KamalaHarris How about you remove all movies &amp; games containing gun violence, remove all music celebrating gang lifestyle and guns, teach men how to be present in their child's life, teach kids how to respect, turn back to God, and STOP blaming everyone else for someone's actions.
@everywhereist @bknighton76 @ChangeMakerPR @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @NRA Your statement is pure ignorance, and shows just how out of touch you people in the Left are. So do you blame the car when it runs over people??
@JoyAnnReid Significant how? Where's the Russia/Trump collusion JoJo, you know, the entire basis for the phony special investigation.... Oh Bobby boy is grasping at straws and you Leftist propagandists are eating it up.... Laughable

@NYDailyNews Hmmm..  how many of these mass shooters were NRA members? The only NRA member I know of, was the one that chased off the church shooter in Texas. How bout blaming society, social media, Hollywierd, Music industry, fatherless homes, removal of Christianity, or maybe the SHOOTER..
@MTLahmamsi @KamalaHarris @ChrisMurphyCT Lol. Your bio says "spread the truth", yet you tweet Bullshit lies....
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan You're an idiotic, dishonest, fear mongering scumbag.
@maddow That's absolutely NOT true you dishonest, propagandist HACK. NONE of you people in the media have any morals theses days. Do you not remember Ethics 101?... if so tell the Truth and explain the Bill in it's entirety, instead of cherry picking, and spinning to fit your narrative.
@jeff_teeple @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren It's illegal for the mentally ill to posses firearms..   Title 18 section 922 (g) of the United States Code...   and besides, what professional has deemed this person to be mentally ill? That's an assumption.
@jeff_teeple @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren As of right now, do people have the right to own these guns?? As I stated, they DO...  So where is the nonsense, besides you putting idiotic words in my mouth?
@belikemike @JohnCoviello1 @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren Well change it then....  why didn't the Left do anything when they had the power to do so? Wanting to change it doesn't change the FACT that as of right now, people have the right to own them, do they not?
@queen_lcg @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren Sure it is. Until the law is changed, people have a Constitutional Right to purchase these weapons, although I personally don't see the need for them, so how am I wrong? As the law states right NOW, do people not have the right to own them?
@jeff_teeple @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren Wow. What an ignorant response.... congrats buddy
@abman_c @tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren Didnt the Democrats have all three branches of government? What did THEY do to bring forth any gun control reform while they were in charge....... NOTHING. Yet they use every tragedy to promote their morally superior, have all the answer, self righteous Political agenda.
@keithellison Where were you and the rest of your propagandist Leftist buddies when you held the Presidency, and the majorities in both the House and Congress??  You all did Nothing, now you cry for gun control every time a maniac orchestrates a horrendous act? Hypocrites.
@tim_nicolai @ScottieT123 @Frialish @TomiLahren Because it's not banned and it's their Constitutional Right to do so.. maybe??
@ChrisMurphyCT Do you Leftists ever wait for the facts to be discovered first from these tragedies BEFORE you use them as a political propaganda? You all cry for gun reform, yet NEVER offer solutions, you are part of the problem... ALL of you

@chelseahandler So you want to traumatize a poor Republican young man??  Will there be  #metoo type support for this guy when you are done with him?
@Sauriana @JoyAnnReid So let me ask you this; did you, or do you, place any blame on Obama for aiding in the division between the police and their communities?? If you say NO, you're an absolute hypocrite.
@Sauriana @JoyAnnReid As an ex journalist, I can assure you that her "job" does Not entail calling the President a racist, mentally ill, ignorant, stupid or deranged, those are called.... OPINIONS, and represent a bias and hatefullness, Unfounded by Truth, so yes, she absolutely spreads HATE.
@Sauriana @JoyAnnReid And anyone that is a member of the media, who so openly voices Hatred for the office of the Presidency, while labeling him a racist, is a disgrace to journalism, and to the profession. So yes, spreading hatred for a President, while using her platform to further divide.. Horrid
@Sauriana @JoyAnnReid Oh. Ok. So I can go on a racist tirade and use someone's name as validation for doing so, and it automatically becomes their fault.. gotcha. And I got news for ya, someone this man's age, didn't Just now become a racist, he was so Before Trump was elected, so blame him, Not Trump
@vinivinidogo @JoyAnnReid Bot.... ha, ok. And it's amazing that little ole me, hard working middle class Christian from small town USA, is the cause for this "garbage fire" as you put t.. So me and my other 63 million deplorable friends say hello, and wahhh üñí #MAGA
@Shesaracer @JoyAnnReid So that's Trump's fault how exactly? It's convienet to always blame everyone else for someone's actions, that's the modus operandi of the Left. Racism has been a part of this country since it's inception, so blame the ignorant fool in the video, Not the President.
@Andy517W @JoyAnnReid I didn't "blame the vicitm", I'm simply stating that every idiot that acts like this, and/or uses Trump's name while doing so, should be called out for THEIR actions, and not blamed on Trump, Period. His actions are inexcusable, but  JOURNALISTS blaming Trump is 4 narrative only.
@chucktodd Cause that never happens with the Democrats right?
@michellemalkin You won't see the Lefty Femenists coming to her defense tho...  they'll instead glorify how beautiful hijab are.  Sickening.
@JoyAnnReid Oh my God lady, you are an absolute horrid person. So everyone that acts like an idiot, hurls racial insults, or attacks someone of non white skin, it's because of Trump?? Do you realize just how Ignorant you sound? Journalist, uhmm NAW. YOU (media) are the reason we are divided.
@JW4Hillary @hike2_bike @JoeNBC @sherrilee7 So when a subpoena is issued by the FBI for a server, you then have the right to delete 30k emails, bleach bit and wipe server, and smash phone after phone?? Ok.  Hillary is an angel and has never done anything wrong.....
@JoeNBC 1.)An off handed comment (joke) that you dopes get worked up about.	2.)He called FAKE NEWS the enemy, NOT reporters.. Liar	3.)The Ninth Circuit Court is NOT known for their outstanding record, 80% overturned.	4.)High Ranking DOJ/FBI officials were weponized/biased- not war on L.E
@TheronC @notjayfivekille He never said the "free press" was the enemy of the people, that's Fake News. If you're gonna bash him for what he "says" at least get it right...he said "FAKE NEWS" is the enemy of the people. but you see, telling the whole truth and using ALL his words doesn't fit the narrative https://t.co/VZe7PKXhzH
@PRESlDENTBANNON @jaketapper Wasn't HRC the one that paid 12 million for a RUSSIAN fed Bullshit dossier, written by an admitted Trump hating ex spy, that was used as THE main basis to obtain warrant to SPY on a political opponent and his advisors?? Hmmm Lefty Logic--- nothing burger--
@BazzerTB @Willbys @Lawrence If you people think Maddow is a reliable, trustworthy, unbiased, non partisan, non conspiracy theory, ethical NEWS person, then I have ocean front property is Arizona for sale, along with a couple of unicorns...  stay away from the grape kool-aid. DELUSIONAL
@CNN  https://t.co/Agb9rntiBr
@jaketapper Hey Jake, when will you mention on air that a Russian orchestrated "selaciously false" dossier, written by an ex spy who has a severe disdain for Trump, paid for by the DNC &amp; HRC, was used to obtain FISA warrant to SPY on a political candidate and his advisors? U think that's OK?
@bj141cox @kurteichenwald Easy fix for ya, MOVE!
@JoeNBC So looking into blatant abuse by the upper echelon of the Obama DOJ and FBI, as well as  following a Russian put together dossier, at the hands of an admitted Trump hater, paid for by HRC, to obtain FISA warrant to SPY on a political candidate and his advisors,is not honorable?üòÇ

@JRubinBlogger Hey Jen, why don't you remove the "conservative" word from your bio, and replace it with Liberal Shill. There's Nothing Conservative about you lady.
@JRubinBlogger @JoyAnnReid God you Libs are insufferable.  You dopes haven't even read the memo, and honestly don't give a damn to, so you could care less what corruption it shows. All you idiots care about is creating a false narrative to protect your corrupt party, and feeding propaganda to your sheeple.
@kurteichenwald @JoyAnnReid @FBI @DevinNunes You haven't even seen it, yet it's filled with lies?? Are you Nostradamus or Cleo (in a gender neutral form)?
@phemale61 @DougSides @RobertM32446045 You need to fact check that. That's a very misleading number. Many of those shootings had nothing to do with "school"...
@KamalaHarris Didn't POTUS just announce, and supporting legislation that would allow 1.8 million "dreamers," three times the amount covered by Obama's unlawful DACA, a 12 year pathway to citizenship?? So once you all on the Left reject it, America will see just how full of Shit you really are

@kate_ornate @JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse I think that is lunacy. I don't agree with having those type of weapons, hell I live in the country, and every family member of mine owns guns but I don't, however, people of all political beliefs own guns. But you are right, it is bad, they should track/keep records of such folk
@kate_ornate @JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse But if you read the Bill, it's not an Abortion issue, it's a humanitarian one. Babies born alive due to botched abortions, should be afforded life saving medical attention needed for it's survival, being that he or she is a LIVING thing, yet Dems voted AGAINST it, that's barbaric
@wringer588 @JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse Weak bro.
@kate_ornate @JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse Lunatic also refers to someone that is full of hate, vitriol and extreme political bias, they refuse to look at Factual evidence that could put their party/DOJ &amp; FBI in a negative light. It doesn't matter what POTUS does or says, the Left will deny, disparage and attack.. Lunacy
@kate_ornate @JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse You wanna know the "lunatics" I refer to...  183 Democrats/Liberals that voted against the Born-Alive Abortions Survivors Protections Act.. sorry, but that's pure demonic https://t.co/ERPee46ne6
@JRubinBlogger @SenWhitehouse Yeah, ok Jen... the Lunatic Left finds no problem with the FBI using an HRC paid for, FALSE dossier to obtain FISA warrants to SPY on a political opponent and his team? And they also don't see the problem with Comey writing an exoneration letter TWO months Before end of investiga
@SenWhitehouse Why y'all so scared Sheldon??  Tick Tock
@seanhannity The only "treason" they are worried about, is how the Democrat Paty, the Obama Admin, top FBI and DOJ officials are about to exposed. Dey Scurrred

@JoyAnnReid You don't even freaking know what's in it, yet you're perpetrating the usual Lefty MSM Spin to it to get your false narratives together Before it is released. You people have ZERO integrity these days, you are all just opinion puppets that spew propaganda &amp; push identity politics
@JoyAnnReid What does "art and music" have to do with a book, in which the AUTHOR HIMSELF admits he's not sure what's true and what's not, and what does that have to do with the music industry? They can sing whatever the hell they want, but the constant personal attacks on OUR POTUS is old

@JoeNBC @BarackObama So you mean to tell me the "racist" in the Whitehouse hasn't done all he could do to reverse those numbers and graphs? Huhmm, but wouldn't a "racist" go out of their way to make things "worse" for non Caucasian people? One year in and setting records? U Lefties love your rhetoric

@JoeNBC 50,000 texts go missing...  Dems refusing to release memo... still never Trumpets in the swamp....  So WTF is your point Liberal Joe? You're an Idiot.
@JoeNBC Texts..  Blatant FISA abuse, using a DNC/HRC paid for FAKE dossier as a basis to SPY on a political apponent, and later a DULY elected President and his advisors.. Weponizing the intelligence agencies for Political Gain..  oh, forgot "grossly negligent" to "extremely careless"..
@JoeNBC TWO months before major players were interviewed, and before the end of the investigation..  the same person that was involved in phony Trump investigation voices severe disdain for him, while talking about "ins plans in case he's elected", "secret societies" And other damaging..
@JoeNBC 15 underlings to Mueller.. all Dems, 10 donated to Obama, HRC or DNC. Chief of Counterespionage at FBI, who was lead investigator in HRC emails, and interviewed 3 people WITHOUT putting them under oath, we now know LIED.. an agent that helped Comey wrote an exoneration letter..
@CecileRichards You should feel real proud of the millions of murders you've been in charge of, and for taking part, along with Margaret Sanger, in the genocide of the African American community... You should be so proud.
@HillaryClinton So why did you displace her, while retaining the accused? Why weren't you "proud" enough of her back then to retain HER, and fire Him?? You are complicit, and you are a defender of perverts...
@Martina The true scary part is that people believe the absolute manure the Left and their controlled MSM feed them everyday. Journalism today, Deny..Spin..Create Alternate story to Distract.. ad an ex journalist, this is the absolute truth.
@Martina So is tin foil hat wearing Rachel Maddow and her conspiracy theory tv show not scary and irresponsible? It's called a Voice for a certain side.. being that Liberals control every paper and every network, not named Fox, do Conservatives not deserve to have a voice? That's Facism
@SparkleNLace @reesworld1 @MSNBC @NBCNews HRC protected a sexual harasser, while displacing the accuser, so tell me how this is a smear campaign, and not relevant to the discussion of sexual harassment, being that she championed herself a leader of such movements? We know the answer tho, Leftist=smear, Repub=wrath of God
@KamalaHarris Liar. How about the Rights of LIVING Human Beings that survive an abortion attempt on their life? Where is THEIR Protection Senator? Your 183 House colleagues are Barbaric for their NO vote to Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, and you're duplicit..https://t.co/ERPee46ne6

@KamalaHarris So tell me Kami, who do 183 House Democrats vote NO to the Born-Alive Abortions Protection Act, that would allow for a LIVING being from a botched abortion the life saving medical attention needed to save his or hers life? How morally does ANY human vote NO to this? It's demonic!

@therealezway @SenFeinstein So closing 63 stores and laying off 11,000, many of whom wal mart is looking to transfer, supersedes ONE MILLIOM people receiving pay raises?

@jaketapper He even stated today that even he doubts many of the things in his book to be Truthful, that he's pretty sure many sources lied to him. So why the hell would a so called journalist print salacious, and apparently untrue, things about a sitting President? Completely unprofessional
@AndrewTalley15 @wendland_kevin @JRBorlik @CNN Where's the proof to your claim? None of those programs have gotten cut at the hands of Trump. Ranting about a President you don like doesn't make to Bullshit you say true. Typical Trump hater, take a positive thing and turn it into a negative, with a side of Bullshit.. smhh
@JWGOP So lying to the FBI should only be pursued if the person lying is Republican, or connected to a Republican politician?  He LIED TO THE FBI, that sound familiar?  So why exactly do you folks on the Left think he should get a pass? Trying to figure out Lefty Logic, enlighten me.
@rainyesplease @maddow So you're a fan of an ex British spy gathering absolute false and made up information with the sole purpose of discrediting a political candidate in which you do not support..... yep that sounds exactly like today's brain washed Liberal millennials.
@TheCalculation @WillieEggimann @Zebrafarm2000 @ChelseaClinton A fifth grader that has numerous successful companies, a fifth grader that's a billionaire and a fifth grader that beat a career politician for the highest office in the country, with zero political experience.... hmmm yep, I guess he's  just not very intelligent tho
@JessicaG1981 @WillieEggimann @Zebrafarm2000 @ChelseaClinton And how many of them have to do with Trump/Russia collusion, which is the basis for the phony investigation to begin with.....  I'll give ya a hint, it rhymes with hero

@jiveDurkey @KathyMobley11 So half the country is racking up through their 401K and other accounts, yet you folks on the Left turn it into a negative? Do you know how dumb and very bitter you sound?
@JoyAnnReid Anyone that believes this ridiculousness is so far gone in their hatred that there's no hope of returning to normal. Jo Jo, you're not as intelligent as you think if you believe this garbage.

@EireannSpice @jdonwo @DavidLeopold @MrJonCryer @ICEgov Due process is one thing, but when ICE detainers are completely ignored and disregarded, and Criminal illegals are released back to the streets to re-offend, that's getting into the willful neglect of Federal Law, and those that wilfully neglect Fed. Law, shld b held accountable!
@DavidLeopold @ICEgov So California is above Federal Law? Tell the families of Kate Stenle, Ronald Da Silva, Drew Rosenberg, Grant Ronnebeck, Jamiel Shaw Jr, Roberto Galo, and many many more, that their killers deserved protection and santuary! These deaths should have been prevented, PERIOD.

You Californians are so out of this world, you Deserve to be your own country!
@PiperPerabo Why don't you go stand for a real protest, one that actually takes courage.... go to Iran and stand with the people who are risking their lives to stand up to a tyrannical, and terrorist supporting government. Where's your pussy hat by the way?

@JoyAnnReid Even if this were true, which in today's world is highly unlikely, how the hell does aspiring to run for President considered to be arrogant Joy? Is it not "arrogance" in itself to claim someone to be arrogant for having political office aspirations? Your hatred exudes abundantly
@jdawsey1 Isn't it refreshing to have a POTUS with some balls?

@DrLexus_StGods @JoyAnnReid For using an "O.K" gesture with his hand??  Damn you hatred laden Left leaning, or Trump hating (whichever), folks are losing your damn minds. Use your brain and stop believing the pure Bullshit Propaganda these folks spew everyday. That's NOT a racist gesture you fool.
@eyesawthat @JoyAnnReid Because it's an "OK" symbol, PERIOD!  It's a complete falacy to claim that gesture to be some racist, "white power" meaning. Anyone that believes this crap needs to have their head examined It's complete and utter horse shit, meant to further divide this country. M.O of the Left
@Oobleck999 @JoyAnnReid It's more made up Bullshit by the Left. They'll turn anything and everything into racism to make themselves appear morally superior, when in fact THEY are the ones dividing this country. It's pathetic.
@JoyAnnReid Oh WTF.  How the hell is a Known "OK" sign with your hand now a symbol of white power?? Jesus you Left Wing nutjobs lose it more and more EVERY DAY.  I've lived in the South my entire life and have never heard of such idiocy. Anyone believing this shit is fucking stupid.
@nytimes Wow. It's so freaking hilarious to watch the idiotic Leftist politicians and their worshiping MSM puppets freak out about a tweet poking at climate change from our great President. He's playing you fools like a fiddle, and it's great.

@EricMcCormack How freaking hard is it to spell out CHRISTMAS ??  An X is NOT a suitable replacement for CHRIST, no symbol or letter is.

@TruthWins22 @SenFeinstein That's a totally bogus stat, but what's funny is that you Leftist are so pissed off about people getting to keep more of Their money, it's hysterical. Even if your stat were true, I guess you'd prefer you pay $18 MORE a week.. well bless your heart lady. Mail me that $936 a yr

@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan Taxing the shit out if their people. Check out Red Florida and Texas and how well they are doing with ZERO state taxes, the Left could learn a lot from them. So saying the Bill raises taxes on 90%, is a lie, Period bro.
@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan Gain control, and when they decide to raise your taxes, in sure they'll find a way to convince you people that the Republicans did it. And yes, 20% of high tax states MAY have to pay slightly more, because of SALT being done away with, so blame BLUE states local government for
@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan What is it that you are missing? Your original post was that 90% of Americans are having their taxes raised.. uhmm that's completely False, you haven't backed that claim up. Saying the tax cuts run out in 10 years proves Nothing. The ONLY way those rates will be raised is if Dems
@JoyAnnReid Are you just sad you no longer get to worship your deity Obummer... are you sad we no longer have an apologist, a race baiter, a divider, a traitor that used Intelligence as a weapon against a Republican candidate, a fiscally irresponsible goon, an anti-semite in office? Wahh
@JoyAnnReid Jesus lady, you are one of the biggest Racists there is.
@JoyAnnReid You mongrels won't be satisfied until what few Conservative CEO's we have left are outed for your far Left buddies huh? You do know that's the antithesis of Facism right? The Left = the party of Goebbels
@SenBlumenthal You are Dilusional, just like the rest of your fellow cronies. You live in a fantasy land that does NOT exist.
@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan Seriously, where's the tax INCREASE, in THIS Bill, that everyone on the Left loves to claim is there? Permanent tax cuts would Not have gotten through reconciliation. So how does tax cuts due to end in TEN years, equate to a tax Increase for the middle class Swaffordamus? (Ha)
@nytimes GOOD...  For far too long we have capitulated to countries that have ridiculed, detested and mocked us by doling out billions of dollars to save them... well no more. If you have a problem with where we put OUR embassy, then keep it to yourself and get over it.WE lead by strengtn

@passionflower92 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump So 7 tax brackets, 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 37%, poor pay NO taxes, as always, all middle class taxes have been cut, BUT, Lefty narrative is that the ultra rich get middle class AND the poor's tax money, so they can get richer, while poor and middle class pay more?LOL Kool aid
@JoyAnnReid Hey Jo, Donald Trump is YOUR President...  hahahhahahahaha
@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan Hmmm. Realy..   7 tax brackets at this %.. 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 37...  so please enlighten me on where exactly in the Bill it says these numbers are gonna go up in ten years..  I already know the answer tho, You CAN'T, so therefore it's a guess, a prediction. And Go Stros
@JoyAnnReid Sorry Boo, the Repubs have infinity to go to catch up to all the ass kissing you and your fellow Lefty MSM and Dem politicians showed towards Obummer..

@Astros290 @tedcruz @lachlan "Raise taxes on 90% of Americans"..... where the hell do you people get this absolute garbage from? Is that what CNNot or MSLSD told you? Complete B.S.   you, "sky is falling" people are hilarious..
@JoyAnnReid Russiagate?? Where the fuck is the evidence Joy?? Two years claiming this Trump/Russia collusion Bullshit and you nimrods have ZERO evidence.. And in case you were hibernating, a few idiot Repubs voted not to repeal the ACA, so you are Wrong, as usual.
@JoyAnnReid @Lawrence We can't help you're in complete denial Joe. Try drinking water instead of the Lefty provided grape kool aid.
@JoyAnnReid @Lawrence Oh put a sock in it already. You Libdos never get tired of listening to yourselves repeat what your Slumlords feed you over and over and over.

@mdorazio07 @SenatorCollins What about the other $9 trillion that's projected to be added to the debt over the same ten year period? Funny how not ONE Democrat politician has mentioned the other 9/10 of the pie, only the small piece of tax cuts. It's called selective outrage.. the M.O of the Left.
@JPrice02 @LumkinsPlays Lies?? Reporting on the extreme biases of the Mueller team is not lies, it's fact... has CNN or MSLSD reported on the texts and the "we need to have an insurance policy in place".. uhmm Nope. Instead of reporting that, they expound on a RUMOR that Trump was gonna fire him.
@JPrice02 @LumkinsPlays So you're essentially a Facist then....  typical Lefties, only want to hear the opinions of like minded people, and plug their ears to all opposition voices. If you want all propaganda off the air, there would be ZERO news networks left. NONE of them are honest anymore, esp CNN

@TeresaBerkowitz @JoyAnnReid @GOP Nobody can truly say if he's biased or not, Period. I don't care how great a person, or what accolades he's acquired throughout the years, that has no bearing or relevance in this situation. 	Political bias aside.. there's been some serious revelations that deserve scrutiny, yes?
@TeresaBerkowitz @JoyAnnReid @GOP Reagan was Conservative to the core.	 	Of course opinion pieces can contain propaganda, there's plenty of that on BOTH sides. 		So the MSM and the Left claiming that Mueller is non-biased and fair, can also be interpreted as "propaganda," because all it is is their opinion.
@JoyAnnReid Ha. You will never have enough make up remover to EVER remove all the lipstick permanently affixed to Obama's Ass, so you're one to talk...
@TeresaBerkowitz @JoyAnnReid @GOP Hannity is an admitted Regan Conservative Talk Show Host, who gives his OPINION, so how is that an example of G.O.P propaganda?
@Jeffgoingon57 @JoyAnnReid Yep... the common sense curveball, you should try it some time.
@TeresaBerkowitz @JoyAnnReid @GOP So there's a difference between propaganda and fact, Liberals just refuse to use their completely biased a partisan brain to see it. Hillary being investigated by all Republican and Republican donors..yea the Left would say, "oh it's perfectly normal, we trust them" YEA RIGHT smh
@TeresaBerkowitz @JoyAnnReid @GOP What propaganda exactly? Hiring 16 Democrats, 9 of which donated to DNC, Obama or Killery, while ZERO donates or supported Trump. How bout Andrew Weissman's horrific record of being overturned 9-0 by SCOUTS, or withholding exculpatory evidence. Or how bout Mcabe, Strzok and Page?
@JoyAnnReid So what does having a heroic and patriotic past from 50 years ago during a War have to do with his completely biased decisions in hiring nothing but Democrtaic lawyers to investigate a Republican President? His past has Nothing to so with his objectiveness in the present, Period.
@JoeNBC And hired all Democrats, most of whom donated to DNC, Hillary or Obama, to investigate a candidate in which they did Not support. If you don't think there's bias you are lying to yourself.If it was reversed with Killery in Whitehouse, you fools would be livid. You dishonest PRICK

@joanvw09 @MISEGR @richiewhitt @jaketapper I know the number of followers must somehow indicate to you folks the importance of one's opinions and beliefs, but that's to be expected from the morally superior and so very tolerant Left. I'll fix it for ya, Reagan Christian Conservative. How's that pedestal you're perched on?
@MISEGR @richiewhitt @joanvw09 @jaketapper And when Obummer used "I" in Every speech and address, he actually meant "we the people"...   LOL. Liberal Logic in a nutshell folks.
@jaketapper So what's your point Jack Papper?   Using the FBI as a partisan political weapon is wrong on Every level Jack, but keep ignoring the true "collusion" and the real story, to chase a myth that has ZERO evidence after two years. Journalist=dishonest, partisan opinion giver
@JoeNBC Man it's gonna be so sweet to see the Left get crushed in 2018. You fools are celebrating One seat like you won a majority in all three branches of government. That seat will be back to Red in Two years. Oh the fall from ecstasy is gonna be glorious to watch. Can't freaking wait!

@EricHolder Maybe I should put my glasses on to text, lots of typos... *there's* oh well..   but you are completely Foolish and an extreme partisan biased hack if you see no problems at all with what all we've found out, and what we've known about Mueller's all Democrat team. U R IN DENIAL
@EricHolder 3. When that same lead investigator leaves Andy Mcabe's office and texts his girlfriend that in the unimaginable event that Trump wins, he "can protect our country on many levels" and "we will have an insurance policy in place"... theirs your collusion. Biased witchunt, Period
@EricHolder 2. Wheb you have mire than half the instigators who have persinally dinted to Obama, Hillary and or the DNC, with zero donations to Trump... BIAS. When you have a lead investigator texting such disdain for Trump AND the American public who voted for him, how is that not biased?
@EricHolder 1.They're not BS attacks you partisan hack. When the lead FBI investigator for Clinton Emails writes an exoneration letter BEFORE the investigation, and does not charge 3 people with lying to the FBI,  when we KNOW they did, but charges Flynn.. that's called complete bias.
@FactsFactsFact4 @GavreysMum @JoyAnnReid God you people are so damn clueless. One says he sees no problems with late term abortion, and the other has 40 year old ALLEGATIONS made against him 1 month before election.. so exercising their freedom to pick one makes them hateful? You f ing people are the hateful ones.
@FactsFactsFact4 @JoyAnnReid Sounds like an Opinion of an atheist who has never stepped foot inside of a church.

@copyboy1 @redinbluestate5 @AndrewCMcCarthy @jaketapper Libs can no longer recognize the difference between fantasy, and real life...
@SenBlumenthal Having a political opinion is one thing, but having a clear disdain for the person you are INVESTIGATING....hello, Mcfly...  and tell us exactly what, "we must have an insurance policy in place" means Sen. Dick Bumahole. Shoe on other foot you Libturds would be incensed, period.

@hdot42 @palecur @jonbrodo17 @brhodes Facts according to who exactly? The Obummer administration? I guess we shouldn't question the validity of the almighty anointed one eh. I just stated 3 facts for you, and yet your logic still tells you it was perfectly above board... it's called critical thinking, try it.
@hdot42 @palecur @jonbrodo17 @brhodes In the middle of the night, Without Congressional approval, and they just happen to release 4 U.S hostages AFTER they confirmed their money was en route...   Obamambot, non critical thinking Lefties.. "it was $ we owed them from 40 years ago, perfectly legit." Logic much?
@Martina Pretty sure there's a lot more to it than that Martina, but of course the Lefties have to spin to make white Republicans out to be the devil.
@JoyAnnReid Ha. A Liberal quoting a "credible source," what could possibly go wrong?
@JoyAnnReid Don't worry Joy Rude, most Americans can smell the Bullshit you and your Lefty cronies feed us every day. You know the saying tho... something about casting stones in glass houses, sumthin like that. Didn't your party just Eat their own to give the Illusion of moral high ground?

@susankatz @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Might want to Listen to what was actually said in that tape and be Truthful with yourself, instead of spinning what was said to fit the Trump hating MSM narrative. There's one word the bozos on the Left love to gloss over...
@washingtonpost Ha. "Mueller's Rusiia probe has already secured two indictments".....  now that's hilarious. They fibbed to the FBI, where's the "Russian collusion to meddle with the election?? God you biased Lefty opinion writers (not journalists), are quite pathetic, dishonest and full of shit

@BillCassidy Thanks you Senator for your hard work. Treasure your beautiful family always. It's sad to see all the pathetic attacks on you on a post featuring a photo of your children, but I guess that's the expected Norm from the ever so Intolerant Left. Thank you for fighting for Us.
@morningmika No Mikey, it feels like business as usual. The Dems are willing to sacrifice one of their own to achieve the allusion of moral superiority, plain and simple. The ONLY reason this was done was to give them ammo to go after Republicans and Moore, period.
@SenBlumenthal Oh Bullshit. Do you know what it takes to get a CCP?   Someone that wants to intentionally harm another via a gun, is not gonna bother to get a CCP to do so you dope. Tell me how many people with CCP's have gone out and shot folks?

@CNNPR @realDonaldTrump Report the news...... Well hell, why don't you try doing that fairly and accurately then.  So blatantly biased and opinionated, that your POTUS coverage has been 93% Negative, but you all are so blinded by hate, you actually believe the B.S. you spew. #CNNisFakeNews
@perlmutations @keithellison Sorry, but anyone that thinks it's OK to kill an unborn baby up until it's birth, is Far from Strong values. His late-term abortion views are appalling and barbaric, Period.
@petwelfare411 @washingtonpost Allegedly
@KamalaHarris Thats such B.S Kami. Repealing the individual mandate gives people back their right to CHOOSE. Forcing someone to purchase shitty Obamacare, or pay a penalty, is just flat out WRONG and Un American. Do you folks ever get tired of straight up Lying to your gullible constituents?
@SenateMajLdr If you fail to get this passed through the Senate, you need to resign as Leader. Do not fail the American people once again. #TaxCuts
@RunaroundSuzzz @studiohq @BiglyPissed @summer7570 @Joecar1956 @CathyGlaesman @maddow That comment was directed at @studiohq. I actually applaud Franken for taking responsibility and apologizing.  It just seems a bit odd to me that people can look at that photo and say "sumthin doesn't smell right".. hard to refute a photo
@studiohq @BiglyPissed @summer7570 @Joecar1956 @CathyGlaesman @maddow So you can tell with 100% certainty his hands weren't physically touching that woman's chest?  You're delusional if you say yes. And does that change the Fact that that photo was totally inappropriate? Typical Lefty, photographic evidence, and still make excuses
@summer7570 @Joecar1956 @CathyGlaesman @maddow He's Never claimed to be a journalist, he straight up tells you he's a Regan Conservative.  It's funny that people that never watch his show claim him to be this and that, yet believe Madcow to be an Objective Journalist, which SHE claims to be...  Insane
@SenatorTimScott Thank you Senator Scott for your hard work. Hopefully you can get Senator Johnson on board. #TaxCuts for all, even the robots that believe the same ole, played out, b.s. rhetoric the Left spews.
@GeorgeTorresNYC @washingtonpost @seanhannity @Ford @Lexus @LibertyMutual @Progressive @goldencorral @MyPillowUSA How exactly has Hannity defended him? Refusing to proclaim someone guilty of a serious charge Before hearing all the facts is hardly defending, it's called being Objective, something the Left and MSM know Nothing about.
@washingtonpost Fake, made up, opinionated, Bullshit article as usual. Do you opinion givers (not journalist, as that profession no longer exists) even remotely remember Ethics 101? Pretty sure Ethics courses are required in order to receive a MASS COMM degree

@BettyBowers So no one ever makes false accusations out of spite, revenge, favor or money these days? Very sad that people aren't afforded the opportunity to prove their innocence BEFORE being judged by Everyone. As a "Christian," I'll wait for ALL the facts before I pass judgement, as shld u
@jpodhoretz @chucktodd Oh John, divert divert divert.... typical. Redirect..  Loser Left with their same tactics. Sad
@MeganMullally @SeanHayes Too bad you all have no qualms about alienating half the country from enjoying a show that USED to be fun to watch. It's sad that actors can't  Just  Act..  Y'alls extreme hatred for our POTUS has no business being plastered all throughout your sitcom. Ruined a great show, sad
@ChrisMurphyCT So if someone from your past comes out 20 years later and says "Chris Murphy touched me when I was 13 years old," you should be forced to resign, before you have the chance to prove the accusation bogus, correct?
@chelseahandler It's so hysterical watching you Leftists slobber all over yourselves after watching local Blue states races remain Blue. Virginia's House... ha, who cares. 2018 GOP will kick y'alls ass
@BrookeBCNN @TomPerez No, he means that anyone who thinks differently than he does, politically, are beneath him, same as you do Brooke. It's the "I'm morally and intellectually better than you" attitude of the Left.

@JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @RepWilson A propagandist lying Leftist, compared to a highly decorated 4 star general.. yep, one grew up to be an American Hero, the other a scumbag
@JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @RepWilson She claims she's a "rock star" now, after politicizing a PRIVATE moment. She's a disgusting opportunistic POS. You Leftist are a disgrace..
@CNN It's hilarious to see all the precious snowflakes get a tingle in their britches every time they see the word "impeachment." Oh.. too cute
@Belairviv @TomiLahren How exactly was she "helping" the family by publicly excoriating the POTUS.. AGAIN. Now she says she's a "rock star", that just proves it.
@Belairviv @TomiLahren So because she has a relationship with them, that excludes her from taking advantage of them for political gain?Still an opportunist, Period

@SenSchumer Pretty sure mother nature is just as unpredictable today as it Always has been Chucky.
@EricMcCormack Is it a comedy? Or is it hateful opinions bashing the President and his voters in every way shape and form? Act. Be funny, NOT political.ugh
@KamalaHarris So who exactly disagrees with that Kam Kam? LEGAL immigrants have done wonderful things... OK. So What's your point exactly?
@Martina So tell me Why exactly as a business owner I should be FORCED to pay for an employee's Birth Control?
@EricMcCormack @nbc Leave politics Out of it. Imagine the number of viewers you could get if you didn't give a big F U to Trump voters.Sad tho, y'all Don't care
@RealJamesWoods Yet the Left try to destroy it every day. WE will never let that happen tho.
@cheddar @esquire @jackholmes0 Why don't you all just report it as him refuting irresponsible, accusatory and idiotic journalism? Should be easy right?
@MeganMullally @nbc @WillAndGrace No Thanks. @DebraMessing and fellow Liberal elitists on the show, make it impossible to enjoy, especially after the 1st episode. Damn shame
@morningmika So wearing a "Nasty" shirt, denigrating POTUS After he left the island, is perfectly ok with you Mika? I feel bad for YOU, Hypocrite..
@stevecstny @usmc1ordie @SenFeinstein @DemGovs Trillions in non funded liabilities, wasteful spending, reduction of the military, giving Iran 150 billion/allowing them to spin centrifuges
@stevecstny @usmc1ordie @SenFeinstein @DemGovs Hmm oh yeah, Obamacare was, and is, so wonderful. The GDP&gt;3% for 8 yrs, excessive regulations and taxes on small businesses, Debt doubled
@SenFeinstein Where were you and the Left when Obama's ATF made them legal? Yes, they should be banned, But, it's a TECHNIQUE.. ther r other ways 2 modify
@keithellison Maybe you should of spoken up when the ATF, under Obama and Holder's Justice Department, made it ok to own bump stocks.
@KamalaHarris Where have been the last 8 years? Where's the outcry for Chicago, a city with THE Strictest Gun Laws in the country? Where's the Solution?
@Martina Where has the Left's outrage over dozens of kids being killed EVERY week in Chicago been? A city with The Strictest Gun Laws..
@Martina It's easy to cry "do something" after a mass shooting, but where is the ANSWER or the Solution that would have prevented this?? NO 1 has it
@ChrisMurphyCT So exactly What Gun Law would have prevented this idiot from doing what he did? How do you stop someone determined to kill?NO ONE has answer
@ChrisMurphyCT So you're saying it's your fault, and all of Congress, for a Whacko obtaining ILLEGAL firearms and shooting innocent people?
@jaketapper Why don't you report on the FACT that there are ports full of supplies, but not enough truck drivers to get them out. U bums r so dishonest
@morningmika WE showed at the ballot box, he's OUR President! Your phony network, alongside the MSM, can keep manufacturing lies, but WE are Not fooled.
@KayaJones That's why mainstream America can NOT take him, or the NFL b.s. protest, seriously..  Why not go on ride along with cops? Pathetic Loser

@WayneDupreeShow It's an abomination, that's what it is....
@ruja_entcheva @DebraMessing @WillAndGrace It's sad that people are so blinded by hatred that they are brain dead and naive enough to believe made up Bullshit like that.
@nytimes You Leftist, so called "journalists", are the most hateful, dishonest and un-ethical propaganda pushers in the country.
@BigAlDell @Amy_Siskind More Spin and dishonesty from the hateful Left. The sad part is you people actually believe the Bullshit that you regurgitate.
@Amy_Siskind Such and ignorant and asinine statement. The venomous Left spew nothing but falsehoods, hatred and divide. Truly sickening the hate you spew
@ruja_entcheva @DebraMessing @WillAndGrace Damn shame people find it entertaining to watch overpaid actors denigrating, with such vigor, the office of the Presidency. So distasteful
@reelgem @DebraMessing @SeanHayes @MeganMullally @EricMcCormack Watching elitists, spoiled Hollywierd Libs bash the President with every breath, ruins what USED to be a great show. So SAD and pathetic...
@DebraMessing Do you even care that you alienate half the country from enjoying the return of W&amp;G because of your big F U to Trump voters?
@KamalaHarris We are helping u nitwit...  Some people are dumb enough to believe the Left's dishonest propaganda that we are doing nothing... Idiots.
@danibostick @TheKevinBeard @realDonaldTrump Is your opinion more right than that of several Puerto Rican politicians who have Praised Trump for his quick actions and help? U R so nasty
@danibostick @TheKevinBeard @realDonaldTrump Instead of just mindlessly dissing our POTUS with NO facts, point out exactly what he "hasn't" done properly in Your opinion.
@danibostick @eugenegu @iCrazyJa @realDonaldTrump You are an extremely dishonest and vengeful person, just like most on the Left. U clowns will never give him credit no matter what he does..
@danibostick @iCrazyJa @realDonaldTrump Bullshit. If the island was returned to normal 3 days later because of Trump's actions, you "hate Trump" bafoons would still crucify him.
@SenWhitehouse Anyone who believes this la la land B.S. the Left constantly feeds you is brain dead and foolish.
@womanofexcellen @SenWhitehouse LOL Over a THOUSAND seats gained under Obama, 5 for 5 special elections, House, Seanate, Whitehouse and 2/3 Governerships, so much losing.HA
@SenWhitehouse Damn you Democrats are pathetic with this B.S. everywhere you turn.
@keithellison Oh B.S. Keith..  When will you idiotic Leftist quit lying and brainwashing your naive base? Funny how most CEO's and Corp. bigwigs are Dems
@KingJames Great way to motivate people.. calling millions of people '"uneducated" (like u?) Because you disagree with who they voted for?  Cry Baby
@Martina The Anthem is a reminder of those that sacrificed their LIFE so that those whiny millionaires can play a game!Sports die if that evr happens
@keithellison You and Maxipad Waters are the true racists Keith.. Keep preaching hate and dividing this country further, you'll see the results at ballots
@keithellison Ignorant and untrue statement...but that's the norm from you psychotic, race-baiting, hate pushing Libturds. That's exactly why y'all LOSE
@RepMaxineWaters @jemelehill @KingJames YOU are the disgrace! You racist Pig.Leaching off your community, living the good life while your district suffers. Help your people u witch
@BillCassidy Senator, isn't it quite funny there's so many experts out there?They don't even have to read the Bill to "know" what it does. Lots of Cleo's
@KamalaHarris Forcing people to buy healthcare or pay a penalty tax is Un-American Kamidiot. Protect MY Rights in having a penalty free Choice!NO MANDATES
@eugenegu @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Good Lord you Libturds are so melodramatic and insufferable. Bunch of mindless robots regurgitating propaganda given to them by Dems &amp; MSM
@realDonaldTrump @RichHamblin11 Don't dog on Rand Paul... McCain, Collins and Murkowski on the other hand deserve the backlash. Johnny boy gotta go!
@NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain He's a typical Washington Swamp Rat, just like you. Campaigned on repeal and replace and then caves when it comes time to do it.. Pathetic
@lisamurkowski @ARPAE VOTE YES....
@jettwalker @cnnbrk Pretty sure he's still you're President... but you can always solve that by moving out of the country. Buh Bye
@Martina Yeah, cause taking a knee and disrespecting the country that affords you the opportunity to make millions directly helps to solve problems.
@BillCassidy @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Thank you Senator for your tirelessly hard work and dedication, and fighting for the people of our great state and Country!
@KBNovaStarr @MariCat @SenThomTillis Even tho you may feel for their plight, it doesn't change the Fact that coming here illegally is Agaisnt the Law.
@KBNovaStarr @MariCat @SenThomTillis Good people break the law, doesn't change the Fact they broke it, or that they have to pay the consequences.
@DebraMessing It's hilarious that people who get on Twitter and bash this bill have not read it and are clueless as to what it does. Regurgitating MSM LOL
@DebraMessing Loved watching W&amp;G, but your mightier than thou Hollywierd elitist lectures to the everyday Trump voter has turned me off. You're no better
@morningmika Do you have a mirror Mika? You and crazy Joe are quite the bullies yourself, alongside your pathetic network and the rest of MSM.
@MariCat @SenThomTillis Legal immigration is quite humane and safe, is it not?  Are u suggesting the Senator make it easier for ILLEGALS to sneak into this country?
@HillaryClinton How many of those millions of people never wanted it Killery? How many of those millions were FORCED to purchase the Ocare disaster?

@RepMarkMeadows @CNN @wolfblitzer Thank you for being the voice of True Constitutional Conservatives. Kick Wolf's Ass.
@KayaJones @Joy_Villa It's amazing the things that the "so called" tolerant Left get away with.Will the MSM call out this bigotry and hate. NO, they'll praise him
@Martina Trump wins=white people hated having a black president... (even tho he was elected BECAUSE of white people) Sore losing Liberal blame game..
@Martina It's amazing the pedestal and moral high ground the Left perches itself on. Hasn't the "Republicans are racists" drum been beaten to death?
@SenBlumenthal America didn't promise them jack shit Dumbo, Obama did, Without say from Congress. Facts matter Richie...
@KamalaHarris When will you extremely dishonest Lefties tell the truth? Health care and health Insurance are two different things, but keep spinning it.
@FindIssue @ChrisMurphyCT @GOP So the maniac Kim Jong Un, repeatedly rest firing CBMs, constantly threatening destruction to the U.S, is Not the threat, Trump is? LOL NUTS

@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump The facts are simple, you have multiple "anti-police agitators" being caught on video harassing officers, do you not? You DOPE.
@keithellison Have you written your statement calling out Radical Islamic Terrorists and ISIS for their cowardly attack in Barcelona? Hypocrite
@CNN Most logical thinking Americans know your coverage of his comments have been extremely dishonest and incorrect.Your hatred 4him is appalling
@melissa123090 @ACTBrigitte @dustinpg11 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Trump haters only hear what they want to hear, period. Spin it, twist it, and make shit up, truly dishonest.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd And your response is to call me a Nazi defender?OK lady, clearly you Can't accept the Fact that you are Wrong.On with your MSM brainwashing‚úå
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd LOL. Defend Nazis.... OK. You asked for proof of ONE person there that was not part of those groups, and the NYT interviewed one.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd *you're*    pardon the grammatical error
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Not that any proof is needed, since we both KNOW the President was NOT referring to the white supremicists.. fromNYT https://t.co/cUh5TCPQQQ
@SenDanSullivan @POTUS He's done that multiple, multiple times. You people just refuse to accept it. Listen to Hannity's podcast, he disavowed them at least 12 √ós
@lisamurkowski And use them with force, to attack the slimes, aren't they pretty much stooping  to their level?   It's not the right way to effect changes?
@lisamurkowski Yes people have the right to stand up to those putrid punks and speak their mind.. but when they decide to bring helmets, sticks and bats..
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd If you want to believe there was not ONE non white supremicist there, that's on you, but to say that Trump was referring to Nazis, Dishonest
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Whether you believe there was such people there or not, your twisting his words. Straight up lying actually, likeMSM https://t.co/gW6oWdkzkx
@chucktodd Brainwashing and lying to them early huh Chuck? Teach the child about all the things that offend people these days, there's quite a few.
@Martina So would that make it to where the civil war never happened? Would it erase slavery? Would it change history? Will is stop Hate? Sadly, NO
@SenatorDurbin Why do you folks lie so blatantly and without regard? How many times does he have to denounce these groups before you idiots stop your B.S.?
@TomiLahren Doesn't fit their b.s. narrative Tomi.
@mcshernj @BigDavesRant @WiccadWitch @mcaffer62 @donnia8789 @ScottBaio These morons know that JDM, but admitting that will show logic and sense, and they have pretty much lost all logic and critical thinking.
@WiccadWitch @ScottBaio NO he didn't. But you Libs only hear what you want. You people have totally lost your ability to think logically. Spin to push narrative=Lib
@iluv2pekes @BillCassidy @POTUS Not what he said. You people hear what you want. Keep blindly following the vile and blatantly misleading MSM. Listen again,use common sense
@CNN Cause that will surely change the fact that there actually was a horrible thing called slavery. Will it erase the Fact that it happened? NO
@ChrisMurphyCT @POTUS You idiots are completely twisting his words to fit your narrative, as you usually do. This time however, y'all have lost your damn minds.
@Martina We never had a party act like complete sore losers and unleash the hounds of hell against a fairly elected POTUS every minute of every day.
@morin_donnalynn @GirlOnFireSally @ananavarro Are you really stupid enough to think people don't know that's an absolute Bullshit picture?
@ananavarro @RunnergirlSD You're no better than the idiots carrying torches and chanting crazy things. "Unfit to be human" shows the same level of Hatred. Damn shame
@CNN @VanJones68 Oh cry me a river you phony ass Spin master puppets. You do nothing but spin everything POTUS says. Dishonest, propaganda pushers= MSM
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Monuments, THOSE are the people he made the comment about, NOT nazis.. It's very clear actually, but of course u people twist it as usual
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Shouldn't have to explain it, again. There were people there that had nothing to do with Nazis, that were protesting the dismantling of the
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Oh Bullshit. He said no such thing. You know damn good and well he didn't call Nazis "fine people". You hear what u want to hear.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Well when the Left and MSM are releasing the hounds if hell on him every minute of every day.. Sad part is, people fail to see the truth.
@tontonlove @PiperPerabo @VanJones68 Dumb is just dumb....
@PiperPerabo @VanJones68 You idiots on the Left will interpret his words however you need, in order to make him out to be the devil, just to make yourselves feel btr
@MittRomney Both sides Hate each other, Period.. That's the point, to stop ALL the hatred, is it not? The "other" side Mitt, are not innocent kittens.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd So damn much, then sobeit. It seems that's the only way the Left can deal with the Fact, 9 months later, that y'all LOST.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd You can purposely misinterpret what he says all you want, if that's what it takes to make you happy, to make up for the fact y'all Hate him
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd There to protest the removal of the monument. So are u gonna say that was not true? Was everyone there a Nazi? UhmNO, put the MSM Spin on it
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Twist his words, that's what y'all do best. He said there were some people there that weren't with the scum white supremacists, they were..
@chucktodd And so called "journalists" shouldn't repeatedly interupt a President, or engage in a debate. Thier job is to ask him questions, Period.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd That statement shows the extreme amount of Hatred you, and the entire Left, have towards this President, so much so it blinds u from logic.
@CampKayio @mclaren_lou @EHurleyAlvarez @chucktodd Oh Bullshit. You dopes on the Left have lost your rational thinking minds. You love to spin everything POTUS does or says. U are delusional.
@commondefense @realDonaldTrump These people have been marching for decades, during Republican AND Democratic Presidencies. You idiots blaming Trump are Pathetic &amp; Ignorant
@SenatorCardin @POTUS You people bitch when he doesn't say it, and bitch when he does... You will never be satisfied no matter what he does or says. Stop the hate

@Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @rainbowblues61 @high_imBri @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh His emails Don't prove "intent to collude with a hostile govt. to sway votes." That's an absolute reach to say that, is it not?
@Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @rainbowblues61 @high_imBri @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Recorded it. Had to go back to work. Not so much minimizing, just stated that the statement Kelly made was a stretch.
@lauramhartman @rainbowblues61 @high_imBri @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Wrong!  https://t.co/lHyZprlmIZ
@rainbowblues61 @high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh He met with somone to sway votes...really. That's a stretch and purely hypothetical. Oppo research is common practice, with Both parties.
@rainbowblues61 @high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh That's a huge stretch and purely speculation. Doesn't look good, but come on, that sounds like something CNN would say.
@high_imBri @Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Ha. I pretty much can't stand anyone in MSM, as an ex journalist. Although Bret Baier is the most neutral news anchor on tv, I think.
@Susie_K_ @high_imBri @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Take it u don't like Hannity. Lol
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Maybe so, but it'll be his first interview since emails.No way around asking THE ? tho. I'm interested to know what he's gonna say anyway.
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Jr will be on hannity tonight, should be interesting to heq4 jus explanation.
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh I hear ya. Didn't recall the meetings until after they were notified of NYT story.. got a lot of explaining to do for sure.
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh You can only defend so much I guess. Raises serious questions for sure. Still got faith in this country  tho.
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh To be honest, didn't even know about the emails til now. Just turned on news to see for myself, after a long shift..yeah, not good
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Optics are not good for sure. But this Russia b.s. has been going on for a year, and still no evidence Potus collided with Russia, period
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Yet Jr was a private citizen. Plus he got nothi g from the meeting. It was all a setup to begin with. Same company that put out fake dossier
@high_imBri @lauramhartman @Susie_K_ @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Ok, then in your own words, no intent no case.. if he didn't know he was meeting with a Russian agent.. No Case. Right.. lol

@high_imBri @Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Lol. Ok. Since "they" brought no charges, that can only mean she's innocent.. today's logic by the critical thinking Left.
@high_imBri @Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Comey,  who for 13 minutes delivers a scathing testimony about HRC, then says they will not pursue charges bc "intent" might not be proven?
@high_imBri @Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh The same Lynch that told the Clinton crew she would put the "kabosh" on any investigation that got to close..
@high_imBri @Susie_K_ @lauramhartman @MedianPolitics @DonaldJTrumpJr @limbaugh Who are "they"? You mean Comey, who was told by his boss AG Lynch to refer to it as a "matter". The same Lynce who met with Bill on tarmac.

@BarbaraBoxer You Lefties are pure comedy gold Barbara. How quickly you all forget your own history. Reid, Biden, Schumer, 2013..Hypocracy, LOL pot-kettle
@keithellison Turnabout is fair play... Rules should only be changed when beneficial to Democrats right? Typical whiny hypocritical Lefty. Wahhhh
@ChrisMurphyCT What's good for the goose. It's hilarious you Democraps invoke the nuclear option in 2013, and now wanna lecture R's for doing it. Hypocrisy
@MaxineWaters Spin, deflect, redirect, create falsehoods/conspiracy theories, deny, distort, skirt the law, Allinsky, control MSM = modus operandi of Dems
@keithellison Blah blah blah...  Polls, statistics, Liberal publications, Liberal politicians, MSM, Facts.... guess which word does Not belong here..
@MaxineWaters @MSNBC Must be midnight..... CUCKOO  CUCKOO
@mcuban A reasonable and logical thinking Liberal... who knew those still existed. Glad to know u see through the B.S. for logic.
@amyklobuchar @hardball Watch a fluff piece about fabricated bologna? Uh NO thanks. Go on O'Reilly or Hannity if you want to be asked tough honest questions. #MAGA
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump You have got to be the biggest Loser in life to stalk the President night and day the way You do. Lose your virginity, might help ya. -‚ùÑ‚ùÑ
@AmyMek @KayaJones It's a damn shame that the people filming this and bringing it to the public eye are being charged with 15 felonies. Lefty morals on display
@washingtonpost Witnessing Liberals fawning over themselves in hopes of seeing a fabrication become true is priceless. Glorious redemption for the last 8yrs
@MaxineWaters Oh Maxi, you are nuttier than a fruitcake. Poor thing. You should use your great healthcare plan to check for dementia or Alzheimer's.Cuckoo
@Martina Witch hunt is correct. Witch hunt based on ZERO evidence, even with "incidental" surveilance on Trump team, eight months later...NOTHING lol
@MaxineWaters Neither is President Trump!
@Martina Grant Ronnebeck's killer was released after kidnapping and raping a woman for over a week! They protected the WRONG person.
@Martina Just curious, how many people have to did before the Left wakes up? How can you promote people and cities protecting criminals??
@Martina were repeat offenders, how many have snuck in this country multiple times.. it's sickening..they should have been prevented, Period
@Martina released by Liberal judges, DA's and protected by people who refuse to follow the law? Look how many were known criminals, how many
@Martina Kate Steinle... So because of a "statistic", it makes it ok that all those people were killed by illegals? Many of whom were...
@Martina Tell that to the loved one's of these people. I mean, why should cities and States abide by Federal Laws?? https://t.co/jLLt7cpE29
@Martina @Fusion How anyone can support sancuatry cities, and providing a hideout to criminal illegal aliens, is dumbfounding. Lib Loonacy
@Martina @Fusion So protecting Known Criminal Illegals should be placed before the safety of citizens?? https://t.co/xYCGP7ehP2
@amyklobuchar 2) Where's the outcry and demands for investigations into who released Non Redacted conversation between Flynn and Russian d?
@amyklobuchar 1) 8 months and still ZERO evidence Trump or his team colluded with Russians over elections. Yet Flynn was ILLEGALY recorded..
@keithellison You are a complete joke to the people of your district. You do not represent  them or their best interests,  ≈´	Uni
@keithellison You delusional Leftists would eat your own young if you were to find out they have a differing political opinion. Arrogance..
@keithellison So Interpreting the law, instead of making or changing law.... yep, according to Liberats that's backwards thinking. Clueless
@keithellison Such Bullshit. It didn't matter who Trump nominated for SCOUTS, your party has gone so far Left, that they'd vote NO no matter
@washingtonpost Hmmm.. maybe you phonies could do a similar story on the Clinton's, you'd have dozens more deaths to choose from.
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP At least they are Rading it First before deciding to vote for or against it.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Damn bro, is your entire life fixated around President Trump's Tweets? Get a life stalker boy.
@washingtonpost So he's getting the info out in public before the Pathetic Dems find a way to bury it.....Shocker.
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump How do you "incidentally" surveil a Pesidential nominee and his transition team?
@SenSanders Isn't that precisely what happened for the last 8 years Bern? Lowest GDP ever, highest poverty rate in 50 years, millions on EBT
@Chadwick_Moore @Twitter @jack @verified Librats way; Alinsky, hide/distort&amp;spin info, attack, label, blame, destroy, villainize, scrutinize
@Martina @LatinoVoices So hypocritical.. Obama helped to destroy race relations in this country, yet Libs r stuck in delusional fantasy land
@Martina @LatinoVoices LOL Blame Trump Always...thats the Left's new motto. Pure Alinsky tactics. Fear mongering, blame Republicans, label
@keithellison @MotherJones So then why did the number of people in poverty reach a 50year high under your glorious Obuma?Idiotic BS as usual
@repjohnlewis If you cared half as much for your citizens as u do with POTUS, then maybe your district wouldn't be in such a horid state.
@RepAdamSchiff What's concerning is the Fact that you Liberats have been pushing the Russia conspiracy for 8 months with ZERO proof. Pitiful
@Heart4JenA @seanhannity You sound like the typical intolerant, Liberal atheist, pissed off at the world, who can't handle reality.Poor soul
@MMFlint Libs have been whining about Russia for 8 months, and yet ZERO evidence. It's beyond pathetic at this point.
@shreec @Medium So is this what you consider your contribution to society? If so, you are severely delusional and mental, u should seek help
@KamalaHarris Let's not forget, Al Frankenstein referenced a totally fake news story to pose a question, which Sessions answered truthfully.
@NancyPelosi Do You actually believe that twisting the truth (lying) actually benefits people?? Oh that's right, you Don't care. Create fear
@BurkmanJeanine @washingtonpost Your profile picture alone shows just how ignorant to history you are. Irony=Libs claiming They are tolerant
@nytimes Maybe he's doing his job and not making himself available to the repugnant vultures that make up MSM. Getting under your skin NYT?
@CoFemale @chelseahandler Actual victims are of no importance. A locker room convo about no specific person is, in Whacko Land of Lefties.
@AlexBWall @DanScavino Is Bill Clinton still relevant eniugh to Tweet about?
@SenatorDurbin There used to be a time when the safety of Americans was of the utmost importance. Thanks to the Obama Left, it is no longer.
@LiadanOConnor @guardian did read the article. "I was on birth control" doesn't excuse it.  Abortion as a means of birth control is Wrong..
@guardian So she made the "mistake" of having unprotected sex at age 16, as a result a life is created, solution; kill it.. bravery? Really?
@CNN After nearly 60 days, there's still NO PROOF Trump campaign colluded with Russians over hacked DNC emails, as alluded  to by U Phonies.
@ABC They accommodate their terrorist detainees with soccer fields, and everything they need to practice their religion. More than adequate
@MaxineWaters @CNNPolitics Mad Max, it's quite entertaining seeing MSM, You, and your party completely lose it. Dem theme song, Desperado
@BarackObama @MichelleObama Drive change....so skipping work for the hell of it "drives change"?  Shows a lot of responsibility
@KayaJones Keep fighting the good fight. You are very much appreciated.
@seanhannity This is where you need to have a talk with POTUS to tell him this crap is NOT what he and Republicans promised. Grow a pair GOP
@RevCLBryant @TheCLBryantshow @FreedomWorks Your guest was right, many of our Republicans are Spineless. All talk and no action. Getting old
@dubbedbass @Lermont @nytimes hmmmm yet 90% of Muslims are still welcomed here....  Liberal translation=Muslim ban..Makes sense..  NOT
@PhillyMarvel @Lermont @nytimes What an absolutely idiotic statement, why don't u just move to Europe... their border policy works so well..
@nytimes By all means Please keep writing your fiction. Your constant smugness prevents you from seeing why your party continues to LOSE. TY
@amyklobuchar Most of us don't strap bombs on our children to blow up Christians either.Heaven forbid inconveniencing a few, to protect many
@SenGillibrand @POTUS It's NOT a Muslim ban!! Why do you Dumcrats insist on twisting fact to easier for your agenda? #AmericaFirst
@KottiPillar @TomiLahren You're confusing Trump with Known pimp Soros. And the Obama led OFA.. Funny how y'all try to spin it tho. Good try
@Martina @HuffPostSportsThank you U.S.A soccer.I mean, the horror to ask those who represent OUR country to respect IT and our fallen heroes
@Kilts4me @wikileaks @realDonaldTrump Completely false. If you actually paid attention, you'd know wikileaks have never been proven wrong.
@williamlegate @CountryRoads2 Funny how you Libturds want to constantly quote polls.. Haven't you learned your lesson? River De Nile flows..
@kingsthings @williamlegate breaking news: if you're dumb enough to believe the typical spoon fed MSM narrative, forget it...
@TreWhite16 Kick some ass tomorrow Tre... Tiger Nation is behind you. And Happy Birthday to your awesome MOM! LSU = DBU. #geauxtigers
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump You are one angry butthurt Lib. News flash dingleberry, Republicans are NOT holding up confirmations.
@lexi4prez Anybody believing the validity of this is just dumb. Such a feable attempt by Trump haters to promote fear, pathetic.
@KristySwansonXO @MonsterManiaCon The envy of many young men, Luke Perry and Charlie Sheen (The Chase). Haven't aged a bit. Keep slaying
@debileigh @washingtonpost If you truly believe that propaganda B.S. spewed by MSM and the puppet master Left, u no longer live in reality.
@washingtonpost Russia is NOT responsible for the election results @billmaher, WE the people of this great country are. Get over it already.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney I can respect that. As long as you stand up and fight for what u believe in. It's all we can do. It ok to disagree
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney But We should be allowed to teach OUR children as we see fit, without the ideas of others being force fed
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney We shouldn't be Forced to believe as the Left does, period. Doesn't make either right or wrong.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney So have I, yet your viewpoints and beliefs refuse to understand that of parents like me.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Never said it was. My entire argument is that it's up to ME and me only when to teach them.
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward And since I proved your out of line comment false.... Crickets.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Funny you keep referring to adults, but not so much on pre teen girls.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney If I did I'm fine with it, when you have 12 and 10 year old daughters to worry about, it's no longer about you.
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward Good for You. Hope everything came out ok.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Oh someone calling u a "sexual deviant perv" because you have a differing opinion? Yea, sounds normal
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Sure they do, nothing against them, but don't tell me what MY beliefs ought to be and how to parent.U don't get it
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney where? You mean like the twit I started with? That called me several disparaging things.. HA. NO answer from her
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney See, that's YOUR opinion and solution. I'm entitled to MY OWN. Like it or not. Tolerance goes both ways
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Its about ME deciding when I wanna teach my children about sex, NOT YOU. Respect my wishes, not hard to do
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney See, there u go with your narrow Leftist brain. That's all yall have I know. Not just about rape bro.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Whats backwards is You telling Me I should allow it, uhh FUCK NO. Sorry
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney When you have a daughter, you can let her shower with whoever the fuck you want to,but don't Force that shit on me
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Funny you both keep saying bathroom, but fail to mention sharing showers in school. Avoiding issue, what's new
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney That's for Ryan, who has yet to respond to my answer to her idiotic labeling. Typical deflection tho.
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward Its called being a Parent you little twit. U continue to call me names for wanting to protect my pre teen girls..
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Find it hilarious neither of you have taken up for the idea of girls showering next to penises. Deflect deflect
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward Now that's funny there. Yall sure have shown a lot of "exclusivity" towards Trump supporters. Mace, violence, riot
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney But you people like to lump everything in a category if it doesn't fit Your ideology and narrative. Narrow minded
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney See, we are used to the Left riding that high horse bro. If that's the same ole tired out BS u wanna go with.
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney So shunning people like me because of OUR beliefs is what then?? Hypocritical don't ya think
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Just shows the typical low level thought, and robotic thinking of a typical Liberal. I employ several. Typical tho
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney Funny how yall don't mention the showers/locker rooms in schools, the area of MY concern, not peeing or pooping..
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney So if you think it's ok for them to share showers with opposite sexual organs, that's on you, I don't, period
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward *names*
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward Actually, without lowering myself to your level and calling you makes, I lost my wife 2 yrs ago. NO sex since..
@rockohoward @RyanEGraney If that's the way You parent maybe, but I'm  much more intuitive when it comes to my kids.
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward You don't get it. It's Not about peeing, it's about showers and locker rooms in School.I should have a say in that
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward And the low level thinking that because we disagree, we are automatically Only thinking of "rapists". WRONG
@RyanEGraney @rockohoward I find it funny that you people think YOU know best how to teach OUR children about sexual organs.
@RyanEGraney Yea, cause Caitlyn Jenner looks nothing like a man right?
@RyanEGraney Lol... typical Lib, convert to name calling.  We get it already, you HATE anyone the thinks differently for you.. poor thing
@RyanEGraney Nothing to stop your idea of a "sexual predator" from putting in a wig and saying they identify as a woman either.
@RyanEGraney Guess you don't have girls. I will protect them from as many penises I can, trust me, I don't discriminate.
@RyanEGraney Is that what you call protecting your daughters these days? Guess u don't have young girls, prob a good thing.
@SirStephenH @demexitnorcal @RyanEGraney @RogerJStoneJr Penises in girls restrooms/showers/locker rooms is NOT a Civil Rights issue, sorry.
@jonfavs @seanhannity Jon, you're doing a two step around the question.Wire Taps werw ordered, FACT. Got to be DUMB to think BHO didn't know
@brhodes
@brhodes So that means You and/or Valerie Jarrett are behind it... Regardless if he ordered it or not, he KNEW, PERIOD.
@brhodes You should have stuck to your plan of being a writer of fiction.... because you are living in it.
@ABC Typical responses from the Real party of hate. Joking about crowd size instead of discussing the violence their people keep displaying.
@IamTiaCruz @ABC It's called being patriotic and showing RESPECT for the President of the United States. Lefties need to watch and learn.
@ABC Keep doing it SNL, Kimmel, Colbert &amp; Hollywierd..Yall are too dumb to even realize you're just pushing more people to the Right. Thanks
@jonfavs @derekahunter A lot of evidence. hmm. WHERE? ZERO proof Russia hacked emails, ZERO proof Trump campaign connected to hacking,PERIOD
@momov2grlz @POTUSTrump11 @seanhannity WRONG.  It's actually quite easy to obtain a FISA. What's telling is first request was denied. Shady
@danpfeiffer How do you know they're deranged? How will you refer to them once thay are proven to be true? U gonna have to find a safe space
@Martina Also, by promoting stories such as this and placing blame on POTUS, doesn't that in fact show "hate?"
@Martina There's NO way u can place blame on DJT for ONE idiotic person's actions.By the way, who's been escalating the hate lately? LEFTIES
@MaxineWaters  Don't worry Maxipad, most rational thinking people know the Russia propaganda is B.S. manufactured by your butthurt party/MSM
@DailyCaller Activist---- more like intellectually challenged. Poor folks can't even figure out that they are nothing more tham marionettes
@NancyPelosi And George Bush is the POTUS.... It's quite hilarious you actually think you have ANY credibility. You're too funny Pejokesy
@NancyPelosi Oh Nancy... Do you actually believe the mannuour that gushes out of your mouth? Thank you for bringing more people to OUR side.
@clairecmc Give it up Clary Masquerade. You and your party are so desperate, that you're actually starting to believe your own Bullshit.
@MMFlint For being a "supposedly" intellectual person, you show just how Idiotic and Ignorant you really are.
@JohnWDean @MMFlint Anybody denigrating POTUS for shining a light on fallen heroes, and their families, are IGNORANT.https://t.co/chnshELn4L
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Yet ZERO have come out to say there are grounds for Perjury. You people sound so damn foolish.
@donnabrazile What about Senator Frankenstein for referring to an Idiotic dossier proven to be absolute BS? Is HE fit?
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Find ONE legal scholar that will agree with your perjury BS you hack. Sorry, try again.
@CCarbonator @SenSchumer Unfortunately, THIS is OUR America....https://t.co/1UhwlojtGY
@pchb317 @Elohim_Gadol @SenSchumer @HuffPostPol So how long exactly has she had the opportunity to seek citizenship Legally? No excuse
@AllMattNYT @nytimes Love seeing all the butthurt flakies getting their hopes up over nothing. Straws are running low after all the grasping
@keithellison @newsmax Because I'm sure Trump has no problem with generals reporting missions to news papers.  Classified Intel is private
@keithellison @newsmax Are you really this Idiotic Kieth, or are u hoping America is. SO YOU and news papers should be privy to Vital Intel?
@CNN LOL please....  #MAGA 2020
@foxandfriends @FoxNews "Look at me, I'm the First Black President, and by God people Love me."  The END
@Speedy_Rewards @toddstarnes I'm sure the Washington Post and New York Times would be much more suitable for your purposes.
@toddstarnes @TheView @FoxFriendsFirst Damn Todd, you were being far to nice.  At least hens cackle for a reason.
@keithellison @washingtonpost LMFAO. All the robots getting giddy over every hail mary thrown by their party is quite entertaining.
@DrSeabrook @tleach1983 @keithellison @DWStweets @snopes BS. Back of the head proves Nothing. And having to rely on Snopes to bail u out? HA
@DrSeabrook @keithellison @DWStweets Sorry, that photo proves nothing. They should appear taller than folks in front of them. Proof my ass.
@BBfan4life4sure @Kimmerjo64 @NancyPelosi the truth, LOL you mean like Bush being president and Kasich being gov of Illinois? NO &amp; truth, HA
@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Oh Nancy Nancy Nancy... poor thing..  You are really losing it. You really should seek help sweetie.
@SenGillibrand Religious Freedom--unless u politely decline to bake a cake for a gay wedding, then we will ostracize you for it.
@SchunckaDunk @Scott_Danner_66 @dolfer @TEN_GOP U mean like Obumcara? Pass it, then see what's it? How many lies were in  there exactly?
@washingtonpost Why are most of your papers articles on POTUS based on "opinions?" Have you all forgotten what journalistic integrity means?
@ChrisMurphyCT Translation.. He wants to repeal the UNaffordable Care Act and replace with AFFORDABLE Care Act. Not difficult to understand
@parsonite @Reddog1966 @TomiLahren And what was his GDP growth over his 8 years?. Never reached 3%, worst span in history. You're delusional
@GovMikeHuckabee They're trying to be the first interview on MSLSD and CNNOT, to spew their typical hate. Comical.
@TVDivaGal @glennbeck Too little too late? Seriously... he's been in office for FORTY DAYS! The Left's vitriol and butthurt knows no end.
@chucktodd Chucky, are you taking notes on how to spin his words to fit YOUR agenda and narrative? Look forward to your negativity...NOT
@CNN So we should tune in to see non stop POTUS trashing? Watch you spin his words to fit YOUR narrative, turning Everything Negative? Uh NO
@Martina So All white men should feel guilty for the sins of other white men? I pay ALL my employees equally. Shouldn't push WP on all W men
@Martina My party won, not pissed. And the whole idea behind "white privilege/guilt" is Idiotic.Proud of heritage, &amp;damn sure Not privileged
@bluspec @CNN 1) anyone trying to compare Trump to Hitler is just Ignorant to history and Fact. 2) Trump did NOT coin "fake news". U R Fake.
@Martina Unlike people marching wearing vaginas hats, being paid to riot and obstruct, us Trump voters have Jobs. We show up when it counts.
@MrTommyCampbell @POTUS And you folks still don't get why you've lost over 1000 seats under Obumma, and the presidency. Ha, keep hating bro
@willsolly @paulnstreet @maggieNYT @GloriaBorger Illegaly... seriously?? Yet you talk about truths... now that's just hilarious.
@TomiLahren The same "men" that denigrate you via a keyboard, are the same "men" that have never worn the pants in their relationships.
@XcrossAtlanticX @TheDrew9900 @TomiLahren And yet you FAIL to see what all those have in common. You're too busy being Brainwashed.
@DanaPike25 @tantangerine_ @ABC Did you even study facts or just quote hypothetical Liberal jibberush? Trickle down was a MYTH. Study Regan.
@silveriaalison @CNN @realDonaldTrump WTF are you even saying lady? So he should love the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world?
@jimmykimmel @TheAcademy @ABCNetwork Narcasict much?
@jimmykimmel Her smug, I'm better than everyone, look says it all, but that's what we've come to expect from her. Political genuis? Uhmm NO
@ABC Why doesn't he protest the "inhumane treatment" of women and homosexuals in HIS country? His country Beheads gays, but he lectures us?
@KellyScaletta @ZackKennedy @RPScott1  I suppose you have plenty of proof to back up that claim.. Oh nevermind, YOU are Fake News.. Wahh
@KellyScaletta @bumpersfm https://t.co/r9lWV2Mm9a
@KellyScaletta @bumpersfm Jesus dude, how many "pink pussy" hats do you own? Need some Boudreaux's butt paste for that Butthurt?
@greggutfeld But it would make for great footage for your show Greg. Suck it up buttercup, and entertain us at their expense. You got this!
@eliefares You sound like a typical Liberal robot that just repeats the same tired old rhetoric that has cost your party 1000+seats in 8 yrs
@gabriel_mana @banditville2014 @davidmweissman @TomiLahren Pretty sure You may be irrelevant, Tomi, not so much.
@KatiePavlich Aren't they ALL always overrated?
@PiperPerabo @moonlightmov @BandryBarry But was it???  Hmmmm
@greggutfeld Can you say rigged?? LOL. The Academy is tired of being labeled "Racists" by the black actors. It'll last ONE year, maybe.
@jimmykimmel @realDonaldTrump You must not pay attention to the Real News very often Mr. Kernel Korn, POTUS is always up late protecting YOU
@charliekirk11 Well Hillary did that after accepting millions from them............right?... Oh wait.. hmm....  Nevermind
@greggutfeld Without a doubt, they are the most POMPOUS &amp; ARROGANT people.. Hollywierd--where Their dreams, become OUR Nightmares.
@greggutfeld Gregg why are you subjecting yourself to the idiocy that is The Oscars?  Hopefully u have sum Patron and a Xanax.

@Watching @nytimes We are all sitting on pins and needles. Is la la land about the funny farm? I thought Bruce Willis's show ended years ago
@ABC @jimmykimmel So why does he not take his own advice and show Positivity while hosting the Hollywierd Elitists, "Stroke Our Egos" Awards
@lisamurkowski You can't teeter totter on both sides Senator. Represent the Republican party and defund PP, or just call yourself a Liberal.
@PeterGuen @nytimes It's actually about common sense. My 13 year old girl taking a shower next to a penis...uhmm NO, it's called PARENTING
@PeterGuen @nytimes Another definition for u- To be tolerant, you must share the Liberal ideology, otherwise you're deemed to be Intolerant.
@PeterGuen @nytimes Good for them. Why don't u move there and pee next to whoever u want. So my Home bathroom should be same as public. Haha
@PeterGuen @nytimes It's not hate at all, it's actually love. The love of your child. Sorry but that supersedes YOUR feelings.
@PeterGuen @nytimes So your tolerance supersedes my beliefs and protections of my children?  Your idea of intolerance is lacking truth.
@PeterGuen @nytimes Your Intolerance to respect a parents beliefs in how they Protect and raise their children, That's Bigotry here pal.
@PeterGuen @nytimes bathroom/shower, his/her uncomfortness takes precedent over mine? Why is their feelings more important than mine?..
@PeterGuen @nytimes So a trans feels uncomfortable using certain bathroom/shower- I feel uncomfortable having my daughter share same.....
@nytimes Wait, so now women Want to be seen as sex objects? I thought that's what the women on the Left fight so hard NOT to be. So confused
@CNN @nytimes The truth?? LOL you people Crack me up. Definition of insanity- believing anything MSM says to be true. Need a Xanax?
@KorolowJT @washingtonpost  The REAL problem is, so many sheeple Believe EVERYTHING the MSM reports on to be Factual.
@Bernstein @BuzzFeedNews Did u even interview @PrisonPlanet before bashing him and including the words "neo nazi" in the same sentence? Ass
@Bernstein @BuzzFeedNews You are a hack, and a disgrace to the profession, as are most journalists these days.
@DanRather Are you referring to the people who write and report hypotheticals, opinions, and biased non Factual stories? Its NOT journalism
@dyls26 @ajwahls @JamesOKeefeIII A gaggle is different than a press briefing. There's over 1500 credentialed press members,can't take em all
@KristySwansonXO @KayaJones @Joy_Villa @GregGutfeldShow @greggutfeld Add @TomiLahren to that. Would make for a great show!
@TomiLahren Tomi, it's awesome to see all the whiners you drive nuts. I'm sure these people's shrinks appreciate ya.. Keep being you...
@CeasefireOregon @I35Gringo @DLoesch @NRA Wonder how many gang bangers were able to legally purchase a gun because of ur thesis...uhmm ZERO
@rolandscahill @POTUS You use that word "journalists" very loosely. That word can no longer be used to describe these people, sorry.
@AlexisIndio21 @SenSanders The way Obama controlled them? So he shouldn't be allowed to defend himself against their non stop attacks of him
@NancyPelosi @RepLindaSanchez Do you silly politicians truly believe people don't know the difference between immigrants and ILLEGALS? Wahh
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump The mass Hysteria being displayed by the Left is quite entertaining. What's "sad" is believing your own BS.
@NancyPelosi @POTUS Do you even believe the crap u spew? Another example of your hipocracy.....https://t.co/UybZnGQ5H0
@NancyPelosi @POTUS *were*
@NancyPelosi @POTUS So we're you asking the same under your previous boss? Hypocrite. https://t.co/M1FQXUqnWX
@NancyPelosi @FBI @POTUS Hey Nancy, Bush isn't president, and Kasich is NOT the governor of Illinois. YOU are why we need term limits.
@baalter @DCClothesline Does NBC seriously think this will in anyway sway Trump voters to the other side? Completely embarrassing for NBC.
@DGreenbaum @AriFleischer @POTUS44 Outlets plural? Pretty sure there's only ONE. Supposedly unbiased media OUTLETS have proven anything but.
@CNN Guarantee you he (she) would have scoffed at the idea of his stepdaughters having to shower next to a penis during their youth.
@FoxNews Hope they thoroughly enjoy 2018 for their efforts then.
@Martina @HuffPostRelig Very monolithic and patronizing article. Presumptuous to think all evangelicals are non sympathetic to one's plight.
@jaketapper @SaraMurray There you go again. Changing the meaning of the sentence to adapt to your far Left views. #veryfakenews
@dadstories @SenJackReed Probably because it's all propaganda made up by a extremely jealous Left and MSM.  It's quits sad to watch actually
@SenJackReed Grasping at straws Senator. Everyone knows the Alinsky tactics your constituents and MSM are taking, it's all yall have left.
@ChrisMurphyCT Last I checked, tax returns were considered private and personal info. Has every right not to have to show them. Get over it.
@Martina @lsarsour Not true https://t.co/v3Mid0vmgy
@Martina @lsarsour What's to say they won't? Is the intelligence gathered by Obama and Trump admin. Wrong? Proactive better than Reactive..
@Martina @lsarsour Too bad they didn't do their job and save Kate Steinle. If that can be prevented from being repeated, then so be it.
@Martina @lsarsour Come on, that's not true. EVERY deportation is being challenged by the Left and MSM, that never happened to Obama.
@Martina @lsarsour So I have no voice to protect my daughter from having to shower next to someone with a penis? All parents should be heard
@Martina @lsarsour So NONE of your misguided and delusional statements are Facts at all, Zero. But Facts to the Left/ MSM is really opinion
@Martina @lsarsour 4.)Giving the decision making on trans bathrooms back to the states.. how's that targeting the trans community?
@Martina @lsarsour MSM are of course creating fake news by NOT reporting the facts on the issue. https://t.co/IcI4dzEB5H
@Martina @lsarsour 3.)Over 380 meetings were held over several years with oil comp, and tribe leaders. Agreements were made to grant access.
@Martina @lsarsour But where was all the outrage when Obama had so many people deported? Where we're the sob stories from MSM?? Hypocrites..
@Martina @lsarsour 2.)ICE is doing their job by deporting Illegals with CRIMINAL records. Hardly targeting All illegals. Truth stretched
@Martina @lsarsour 1.)Did Not go after Muslims. 85% of Muslims were still able to come here. 7 countries were listed by Obama admin.NOT True
@CNN Do you unethical NON journalism propaganda news network ever get tired of putting out such Idiotic political Slanted garbage? No morals
@BLANAIDXLIVES @nytimes How would she learn that from Trump? Wouldn't she have learned that from Hillary? How she rigged DNC against Bernie?
@WritingMyLife91 @EvilGary101 So those issues are easily solvable after only a month in office? Uhmm OK, guess he should ignore all others.
@hey_leia @nytimes He's anything but. If he wasn't able to bash DJT, he would have ZERO material. He's just another no talent Lefty hack.
@lsarsour @Martina Anyone who believes this garbage to be even remotely true needs to check in to psych ward, you're losing it. Poor souls.
@lsarsour @Martina That's just a completely  ignorant statement. Funny u bring up trans tho, when YOUR Sharia Law says death the homosexuals
@AmyMek @MI2CA2 https://t.co/AsBhMZ16om
@donlemon @CNNTonight @CNNPR @CNN @Variety LOL, is that a joke? Enjoy having terrible ratings and competing with Colbert for last place..
@NPProPia @GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS You must not be looking in the correct places. Have u been living in a cave? You actually meant Libs/hate?
@morningmika NO, you clearly said, "that's our job" but of course you'll squirm your way out of it like the slithering snakes u people are.
@sirgalahadbrave @AnnCoulter If Obama doesn't protect these criminals, and let ICE do their job, this murder never would have happened.
@sirgalahadbrave @AnnCoulter U don't get it. Illegals that have criminal records have no business being here. Should have never happened.
@icy46363 @Skonialo @jfreewright So people in California and New York think they are above the rest of the country? News flash, you're NOT
@sirgalahadbrave @AnnCoulter Yet those were committed by Citizens and Not ILLEGALS. Big difference. Shouldn't of been here in the 1st place.
@SenatorTomUdall Pretty sure deporting CRIMINAL illegals doesn't constitute as inhumane or unrealistic. Isn't ICE doing its JOB? Extra res??
@maximepo1 Jeez, some of you folks would believe in zombies if the Left said they were real. How exactly is he picking on IMMIGRANTS? LOL
@SophiaBush @devinher @ChrisMurphyCT Complete WRONG, but that's what we come to expect from the Left. https://t.co/x8lsQsMifH
@tackmeredith @TomiLahren the Left and MSM could really use your own advice. Please reach out to them.
@pamela_thorn @nytimes Saying Muslim ban shows your true ignorance to facts. So you're fine with drugs and illegals pouring in?#AmericaFirst
@TRMJr @nytimes @IvankaTrump So putting Americans FIRST is now considered as hate? Same ole rhetoric, but that's all yall ever have. Pitty
@seth_yates @oldpappy59 @washingtonpost Damn, Putin casted 62,979,636 illegal votes? Well crap, why the hell did I even vote then...
@washingtonpost PLEASE... go away. Secede, fracture off into your own island.. do us all a favor, and take New York with you.
@NormOrnstein @Martina And you people wonder why POTUS lashes out at "fake news." Believing anything u read that's negative, predictable.SAD
@jaketapper Jake, can u NOT spin a story for the sole purpose of validating your agenda, EVER?Stop twisting words to conform to fit in story
@jewelsfurs58 And just FYI, I know about suffering, I come from a military family. Also my family's ancestry are Huguenots. Look them up.
@jewelsfurs58 How have u suffered or been discriminated against by our POTUS? I'm pretty sure people of ALL races suffer, do they not?
@jewelsfurs58 But still, where's your proof? Typically blah from the Left, to just spew what the hacks feed ya. Try thinking for yourself.
@jewelsfurs58 1st, it's *you're*. 2nd. Be blind to what? Liberal rhetoric and bashing? Not blind or ignorant, just smart enough to know btr
@RightSideSocial But of course the zombie-esque Left turns this into a negative. They'd rather eat razor blades than give him any credit.
@jewelsfurs58 @washingtonpost How so? Instead of just regurgitating the pile of manure MSM feeds you, support your thesis with Factual info.
@Curtis084 @TheYoungPopeh @washingtonpost Might wanna research his education history before making false accusations. R u 12? U forget Bill?
@chuckheffernan @nytimes @nytopinion What is exactly? So speculations based on propaganda by a biased MSM, with NO proof, is worse? Cuckoo..
@starbucksgirl51 @PRyan @GOP might want to research how much Google, Apple and Facebook paid in taxes, and why their founders are so Liberal
@AP So many puppets. Funny to see all the gullible people that believe everything fictional writers and propaganda biased media tell them.
@washingtonpost It's like a mob of zombies following the last live human, you people are easily led by propaganda artists, or MSM. Oh noz
@gabitoneloto @Donna41361 @JazRoMax @CNN Don't worry, you guys have the teachers unions, teachers and professors poisoning our youth already
@nytimes We have a mainly conservative college in this country? That is news. But of course the story is a liberal trying to change it, SAD.
@chucktodd You should take your own advice Chucky, along with everyone else in your shitty network.
@SenatorTomUdall @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN So you're advocating for the media to continue lying and viciously attacking OUR POTUS?
@Martina Pretty sure it's not the collective, but the minority, based on fear mongering and propaganda peddling from the Left and MSM.
@SenatorShaheen Keeping voting no, who cares, just get your colleagues to get the hell out of the way so OUR POTUS gets his cabinet in place
@SenatorHeitkamp @EPA It's amusing seeing so many people lose their minds over something that was inevitable. You folks can't stop the Train
@mlanger @gbweller That's a factually incorrect statement.What's new, we all know the Left loves to stretch the truth to fit their narrative
@DouxDux @CNN Don't worry, whoever's responsible for illegal wire taps and leaking classified info will soon be caught. (Obama). #MAGA
@CNN He didn't break any laws, why would they pursue charges. Snowflakes are so desperate to make themselves feel better. Go suck on a binky
@DailyCaller Who the hell is going to watch the Oscars anyway? Bunch of upity rich cry babies that think they're better than everyone. Pass
@saturdaysun2009 @_Makada_ @therealroseanne You're confused, Obama is no longer president. But you're exactly right about him tho.
@AltUSPressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr How easily the sheep are lead astray. So many desperate people yelling the sky is falling, with NO proof. Lol
@MaryCarrickSing @WalshFreedom A Democrat would have never kept their promises, much less acted on them so quickly.
@Samagdma @POLITICOMag @DebraMessing Not a very educated and smart guess, but to each his own.
@CNN Pathetic. Display of ignorance by a so called news network...... YES
@ABC I'm just curious, who exactly is advocating for America to no longer allow immigrants into this country?
@sweetatertot2 And the media was nowhere to be found. Didnt you know that it's OK to break rules........only if you're a liberal tho.
@DTrump_FTW McCain and Leslie Grahm cracker need to just go bye bye already.
@GeorgeTakei So what laws have been broke? What's been PROVEN so far...NOTHING u folks are crying about. Illegal wire tapping, that's what.
@GeorgeTakei So illegally tapping a U.S citizen's phone, WITHOUT a Pfizer warrant,  leaking classified info, and treason, is OK with u folks
@nytimes Oh bullshit. You unethical NON journalist are promoting such fear mongering propaganda. You're a complete joke. You have ZERO proof
@nytimes So there's no way they could be putting their personal and political opinions into the equation, like your entire paper does? FAKE
@nytimes Do any of your employees know the word ethics? Do you know the difference between propaganda and fear mongering, to FACTS and TRUTH
@SenSchumer How many times did you demand details on the over 2.5 million deported under Obama? HYPOCRITES AND PHONIES=your party Chucky.
@DailyCaller This is a joke right? Have we stooped this low, to bitch about what our POTUS chooses to eat? We suppose to take this seriously
@SenSanders Quit with your insufferable whining already. You couldn't even stand up to Hillary and DNC when they cheated you bro.
@ShepNewsTeam Hey Shep, you just falsely reported Again. Leaks are real; the LEAKS, really happened. THE LEAKS, NOT the info in them. Listen
@CharlesMBlow it's been a undalye very clear that the TRUTH is a word that has NO business
@CharlesMBlow Must of been mistaken. Self righteous... hmm  had to of been Barack Hussain Obama right? Probably a narcasict away well huh
@CharlesMBlow If he were to coming to his defense, he WOULDN'T of fired him. On a side note, how has he broken the law?  More speculation.
@CharlesMBlow Only Hmmm wonder why he chooses not to call on MSLSD and others...https://t.co/PXkS9w1su2
@CharlesMBlow @Gallup So you put your trust in polls? Haven't you learned your lesson?  Hahahaha
@critic_social @CharlesMBlow Nopet. He's secretly running a shadow government with his leftovers, the media, intelligence and the Left
@CharlesMBlow @Newsweek So now attack our biggest ally in the Middle East.. Oh yea, just continuing where Obama left off.
@CharlesMBlow How low you people will stoop. Celebrating others hardships, but what's new coming from a liberal propaganda pusher. No shame
@oceaglesfan @CharlesMBlow Non ethical, speculative journalists? If you look hard enough there's plenty of those to go around. It's shameful
@CharlesMBlow @nytimes Typical Liberal BS. How bout you write a piece on the ACTUAL laws being broken by whistle blowers and wire taps?
@nytopinion @CharlesMBlow So, "YOU BELIEVE facts are forthcoming," so you're reporting on speculations then? Did u take ethics courses?
@MaddowBlog @MSNBC Damn shame a sitting U.S senator is encouraging people to break the law and commit treason against the U.S government.Sad
@StevePasquale  Some people are so desperate. Participation trophies must not have been passed out to some folks. Keep grasping at straws.
@louieluvsobama @nytimes Oh, so you know him personally then? You people are showing just how nuts you really are. Think 4 urself for once.
@ArianeBellamar @miche11em @nytimes So what grounds are there for him to remove himself from any investigation? NO crime has been committed.
@nytimes Why the hell would he? What crime had been committed? Is Flynn in prison? Typical scare tactics by the Left and Chucky Shoemaker.
@DailyCaller He's not a believer in guns either, but has no proble being in some of the most gun violent movies in Hollywood.
@nytimes So the media, and so called journalists, are encouraging the intentional breaking of the law and outright Treason? How is that OK?
@GeorgeTakei So you saying that they shouldn't investigate the law breaking leaks and illegal wire tapping? So espionage is OK then? Typical
@funder Where's the outcry for the illegal actions and espionage being carried out by the Left and the media? People are so naive to truth.
@nytimes Time to launch investigation into all the leaks and the illegal recording of phone calls. Stop the espionage from the Left Jeff.
@SenBookerOffice You Lefties need to stop with your treason. Having info leaked, calls recorded illegally, and breaking the espionage act.
@yoda555 @leahmcelrath @nytimes You're delusional if you don't see the laws being broken and the treasonist activities coordinated by Left.
@NEMESIS_RuGr8Yt @CNN Yea, it's not like it is an act of treason and very much against the law to do so right? Left don't mind laws anyway.
@Samagdma @POLITICOMag @DebraMessing Not my hero, but MY POTUS. Obama and his insiders, intelligence agencies and the media are treasonists.
@gem_lou83 @POLITICOMag @DebraMessing And your side are the ones that refuse to see what's ACTUALLY happening, and who's to blame.
@NancyPelosi Where is your rebuttal, your correction, your apology to Gen Flynn and the people for once again spewing LIES? It's NOT OK.
@nytimes So much vitriol. The over the top pure HATRED coming from the Left is truly astounding. Vicious attacks are so uncalled for.
@washingtonpost It's like Salem 1692 all over again. How low people will go to make themselves fell better for being on the losing side.
@GeorgeTakei Bullshit. I'm pretty sure the Russians didn't hold anyone at gunpoint in the voting booth. So many people living in denial. Sad
@TechWriter2015 @notmypresidentU Complete ignorance. It's an absolute disgrace to make such comparisons. Sad part is you have NO clue why.
@notmypresidentU Any moron wanting to compare Trump to Hitler needs a reality check and a history lesson. Tolerant and peaceful my ass.
@Impeach_D_Trump @DebraMessing Good thing there's NO law saying a presidential candidate has to release his tax information. Get over it.
@squideatsquid @DebraMessing @Amy_Siskind Some of u people on the Left are acting like crazed, rabies infested wackos. Quite sad honestly.
@POLITICOMag @DebraMessing Oh you poor desperate people. You LOST, Republicans are in control, it's time to get a grip and come to terms.
@leahmcelrath @nytimes LOL. Smoke and mirrors. A plot by the Left, Obama, his insiders and the media to deliligtimize and push out POTUS.
@CitationNerded @CMichaelMaestro so now there evidence Russia hacked voter machines? U must be privy to top secret info. Spin masters, HA
@CMichaelMaestro So now there's evidence the Russians hacked voting booths? U must be privy to sum top secret info then. Spin away tho.
@CMichaelMaestro Liberals are such sore losers that all they can do is name call and denigrate.  Some people just can't handle defeat.
@CNN Hey CNN, where was your outrage for Obama after he deported more than any president ever? You are the biggest unethical hypocrites.
@realDonaldTrump Get rid of Everybody left from the Obama administration. You can't trust ANY of them. He still has plants to feed him info.
@chucktodd Congrats on having miniscule ratings, along with your abysmal network. Congrats on getting owned by Steven Miller as well.
@SenSchumer WE deserve answers as to why you, Pelosi, Waters and Cummings are spreading so many falsehoods. Such hypocrites.
@cherrysdoors Of course. They get away with everything while we get picked apart. Time to unite around OUR POTUS and fight the Corupt Left.
@SenSchumer How about running an investigation into all the leaking of secure information? Don't want to get yourself and Obama in trouble?
@IngrahamAngle @FreeBeacon What do you think about the possibility of Obama running a shadow government? Alinsky fingerprints everywhere.
@TEN_GOP @joelpollak @GenMikeFlynn This poor lady is so unfit for office. But what about the idiots that keep voting for her?
@AnnCoulter @dcexaminer It's Rachel Madcow Ann. Poor thing is suffering from a disease. She's not quite right.
@DebraMessing So that's a message to the Immigrants that have abided by the law and are here LEGALLY right? If so, good message.
@Martina @HuffPostPol IT'S NOT A MUSLIM BAN! The TRUTH matters. Where was your outrage for Obama after banning Iraqis for SIX months?
@JessicaHuseman @DebraMessing Oh, you mean like Hillary did, but on a Far Worst scale? Surely you spoke out about her misuses of Office huh?
@TiffanyLLarsen @ShaunKing @leahmcelrath Liberal thinking at its best. Congrats for thinking for yourself....Oh wait
@ShaunKing @NYDailyNews Yeah Yeah we get it. Everyone that's Not a Liberal Democrats is a racist. People are so easily brainwashed. Wahh
@SenatorHeitkamp Would you Leftist cry babies just stop with the BS excuses. Just come out with the truth that u are all sore losers. #MAGA
@NastyWoman20 @gymmbrat29 @BreitbartNews  People love to show their ignorance at times I guess. Yea it was out of line whatever the motive
@NastyWoman20 @gymmbrat29 @BreitbartNews Well there's plenty of those around unfortunately..
@NastyWoman20 @gymmbrat29 @BreitbartNews It's still proof tho isn't it? That is what you asked for..
@NastyWoman20 @gymmbrat29 Here's just a couple. Just use your imagination on just how ugly your people are. https://t.co/Hsyi1F9C38
@SenWarren Well since we are in debt over 20 trillion, who better to help reduce the deficit? You political Hacks sure haven't done it.
@SenSchumer So will you give us pass when WE break the law? It's a damn shame that A vote is more important to u folks than the LAW.
@nytimes You were just waiting for to write this bs huh NYT?  I best you think u got u ! Got ya on that on huh? Not even close.cry baby news
@HasseAlle @JMSMark5 @nytimes And yet never sent anyone to the funeral of an American slaughtered by ISIS., but was glad to send to Ferguson
@HasseAlle @JMSMark5 @nytimes Obama right after the beheading of James Foley, went to play golf, but he was able to send reps to Ferguson...
@ABC Must of been the supporter of Hillary that wanted to reveal her secrets.Looks like he ended up like the dozenz of others who crossedher
@ABC Wonder why...  they don't want their criminal rejects being deported back to their country. Sorry Mexico, you can have them back.
@nytimes LOL, 333 rounds of golf, I think Trump has a long way to go. And I bet this wouldn't happen with OUR POTUS, https://t.co/qMb2pFvVrR
@JoeNBC Stephen Miller smashed you fools. All you can do is redirect and name call, that's all yall have to go on. Always in such denial.
@nytimes Bout time we started abiding by the LAW.
@nytimes They own a company, why the hell would they not want to grow it? So is everyone related to POTUS now suppose to end their business?
@mocco9072 @WalshFreedom @hattieeannn *weak*
@lexi4prez Do your parents keep track of you?  You should probably not try to take part in adult conversations. Live, and pay bills first
@mocco9072 @WalshFreedom @hattieeannn Pretty sure anyone legally obtaining a gun goes through a screening process. Week attempt boo.
@MarylouFB @CoFemale @ChelseaClinton LOL really. Is that your best defense? Oh I forget that you people love participation trophies.
@bennykoval @WalshFreedom @lexi4prez Are you 13? Throwing such a temper tantrum might stunt your growth. Calm down little fellow.
@larryelder @KristySwansonXO @Adele Oh come on Larry, not you. We know you're smarter than that. Don't resort to this crap.
@TomiLahren I can understand why u have so may haters. At 24 they were all living at mom's and trying to figure out why they wasted 6 years.
@BeyonceFamily Pretty sure that's a wildly inaccurate statement. Can't always blame other people for not coming in first. BOTH are great.
@ABC Really is pathetic how these corporate elitists r treating Ivanka. Hey Bernie, these are the 1% u always rail against, where's ur voice
@TomiLahren Tomi, you shouldn't have to explain yourself to a child who THINKS they know everything. Children r so disrespectful these days.
@CamiAnnS @TomiLahren How do you they got there braniac? Trump won 2600 counties compared to &gt;500 for HRC. Of course they're Red now. DUH
@WalshFreedom @lexi4prez I find it hysterical that teenagers think they know about life. Poor things are so sheltered from the real world.
@WalshFreedom @lexi4prez Mr. Walsh, it's a damn shame that in today's society, parents don't teach their kids to respect their elders.
@AnnCoulter @YouTube Wow. @chucktodd got his ass kicked. Chucky had no rebuttal. He changed lanes like an American driving in London.
@CNN @katyperry Awwhh. How adorable. She's so special. Thank you CNN for yet another ground breaking, bipartisan, article. Earth shattering
@DLoesch  read this and the lyrics of Grammy newcomer winner, some rapper named Chance. This is our youth, scary. https://t.co/0DyNrCfjor
@WalshFreedom Joe, didn't you know that they are much smarter than the hard working everyday person, working hard to support their family?
@ALT_DOJ Good luck with that. Dems have lost how many seats under Obama?? Oh yea, over a THOUSAND...LOL Keep dreaming. Must suck to lose
@FoxNews @lindsaylohan @realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsInsider Maybe we could send her to the Middle East to calm down ISIS. Maybe offer them jobs.
@ABC So why weren't you crying when Michelle Obama endorsed Subway AND Target? That was a blatant violation. As usual, absolute HIPOCRACY.
@Mike_P_Williams @realDonaldTrump You are one butthurt millennial dude. The pain of LOSING is so hard for some to grasp.Don't melt, cool off
@workoutonelol @DebraMessing Oh, so white people that are pro life are dangerous, ok. Brainwashed, uhm ok..https://t.co/AsBhMZ16om
@washingtonpost Just pee in the stand up stall labeled Men	..
@CNN They are going overboard now. Once was a lil funny, this time it was just pathetic. Desperate ploy to get snowflakes to watch.
@DanNielsen65 @CNN Exactly. Sad part is, their constant Trump bashing is just bringing more people to the rightThey r too dumb to realize it
@Martina @huffpostqueer I don't want my daughter to be in the bathroom with someone who has a PENIS. How is this irrational? Makes NO sense.
@CoFemale Because the poor things have been so brainwashed by the cult known as Liberals. It's a shame they haven't snapped out of it yet.
@ABC And WE the protesters of PP, the people wanting to protect the murder of innocent life, will persist, persist, and persist.
@CNN https://t.co/1iEUx9THfV
@CNN Hey CNN, can you show me where you protested against Obama when he implemented a SIX month ban on Iraqis? Did you even run a story?
@ezlusztig Just curious, how many times have you criticize crooked Hillary and Bill for profiting off their Foundation? Left = Hypocrites.
@bentlyg2003 @pvon2502 @joechelala @smerconish Sir, do you need a refill on your medicine? You're obviously having withdrawals. Poor thing.
@joelpollak @Mediaite SAD part is, these people are so delusional, they'll never admit to how biased and hypocritical they really are.
@DebraMessing @NancyPelosi LOL	https://t.co/QYcAazjpXn
@DebraMessing So was it unacceptable that she lied about her heritage? Along with her vast amount of other false claims she made?
@Martina @HuffPostPol So it's okay for the Left to protest EVERYTHING,even when they don't have a clue, but not ok for the Right to protest?
@CBS @Target So excited. Can't wait til the politically advanced singers (so called) lecture us. We are clueless w/o their vast knowledge.
@DebbyNYC @karla_welch   So all magazines, news papers and media outlets should run norhing but negative and hateful stories about POTUS? Jk
@karla_welch It's amazing how all you Liberals want to protest and interfere in free speech. Gotta be yalls way or pepper spray, R's beware.
@TomiLahren Tomi, don't mind the imbecile haters, they are just jealous of your talent, beauty and knowledge. They hate ur smarter than them
@KristySwansonXO Isn't it hilarious that so many Libs just claim it won't work? Crazy that we have so many clairvoyants in this country.
@BBCWorld @BBCNews If she's been living here for 20 years, why the hell wouldn't she have taken steps to be here LEGALLY? Laws are laws.
@KristySwansonXO It's a shame so many people are living in a pre 911 world. Their hatred of Trump overrides their thinking of protection.
@SarahKSilverman How'd u get so smart to tell normal working class folk what's best for them? We wouldn't know what 2 do w/o u.
@SenSchumer @theintercept Would you do us all a favor and go crawl into a hole, and never come out. Can't wait to see your tears in 2018,wah
@MichaelSkolnik.   https://t.co/AsBhMZ16om
@Kramersfarm Thank you for your service man. God Bless.
Wow, look at all the women chanting Death to America. Hey ladies, come on in. "Won't ya be my neighbor." How silly of us, women r innocent. https://t.co/eaPFlKo54n
@DebraMessing I used to watch the show, loved Karen and Rosario, but now must boycott, and hope all Trump voters do as well.
@justinhendrix @DebraMessing Jesus, you people get more and more delusional and sad every day.
@DebraMessing @Independent yea I got typos before any jack wad wants to make a smart ass comment. Sucks when you start losing ur eyesight.
@DebraMessing @Independent So where was the anger when Obama made threats about crossing the red line bit did NOTHING! Typical HYPICRITES.
@karla_welch You cry baby Lefties are showing just how Wacko you really are.So Everybody is suppose to be spiteful to POTUS because YOU say?
@seanhannity Unfortunately Sean, they wouldn't listen is Jesus himself told them. They live in denile.
@wowjones2594 @WalshFreedom I think Obama's 70% increase in spending took a whale bite out of the country. But I'm sure you'll blame Bush..
@CNN @VanJones68 This guy needs a go fund me account to help him pay for his Dissociative disorder. He should really get on top of it.Cuckoo
@Martina @HuffPostComedy LOL. Now this is just juvenile. How low the Left has stooped, to make fun of how POTUS shakes hands. So damn petty.
@mackmaitland @DavidRadou1 @WalshFreedom But I guess putting Americans FIRST is an idea the Left hates, as proven by u Kumbaya teddy bears.
@mackmaitland @DavidRadou1 @WalshFreedom It only takes ONE. I'd personally rather build a home for a homeless vets to live next to me.
@CNN Meanwhile, the good people of this country that voted for Trump are sitting comfortably at home laughing our asses off at these losers.
@PiperPerabo Piper, can u please some how get Covert Affairs back on the air! Just can't get into your new show. We need u and Augie back! ‚ù§
@DebraMessing hahaha  oh man, liberals are so funny. So glad they think the safety of Americans is a laughing matter.
@KristySwansonXO @jessebwatters @YouTube So nice to know that that is the future of our country.Teachers and professors are ruining our kids
@ILive66Failed @nytimes Awesome, you can predict the future? What a great asset that must be for you. Can u give me the winning lotto num?
@nytimes Absolutely hilarious seeing so many Libs bitching over 21 billion when their savior increased the debt by 70% over his abysmal 8yrs
@KristySwansonXO I knew my Junior year crush in 1992 was more than just beautiful. She's also talented, smart and stands up for America. ‚ù§
@SciCommic @Aussie_Greek @nytimes Well you're 100% WRONG, as usual coming from a Leftist. Mattis 98-1, Kelly 88-11.Ur party disagrees with u
@ABC He did Poindexter. Good to know that judges put the lives of Americans at risk in order to advance a political agenda. Disgraceful.
@nytimes So comforting to know that judges  now know what's best for keeping America Safe rather than a POTUS with access to classified info
@washingtonpost Oooooh. Great news story. Great in depth research on such an important topic. Wonderful job once again W.P.
@ChrisMurphyCT @washingtonpost Didn't know a news paper was suppose to strategize with Senators against the President. Absolute joke.
@ChrisMurphyCT  üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
@ChrisMurphyCT What's new cry baby? Can't wait til 2018 to see some of you whiny ass sore losers go bye bye. Filibuster here we come.
@CNN LOL. The man won by 47 percent. These are just the idiots that voted for the Big Loser. Some people just can't handle LOSING. Boo hoo
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Trumpanzee is pretty good. As long as it makes u feel good to call people names, have at it.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Thunk up some new names to call hard working middle class folk that love God, Family and Friends that voted for Trump.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Been at work bro. Take a chill pill. I could list all kinds of facts but you'll disregard them and spin em, no point.
@PPFA Baby killers. Screw you evil people.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Dude,  believe what u want. I'm not gonna convince u and vice versa. Have a wonderful night.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Most Liberal circuit in the country. Look at their record. Even liberals have said they over reached.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr LIBERAL judges made their decision based on POLITICS and not the Constitution, Period. POTUS was well within his rights.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr You're sure huh.... well you're WRONG....
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Oh, are Christians killing people in the name of God, declaring war on other religions? Chopping off heads, spreading hate?
@DogTheBOOTYhntr That's if they are already inside the country moron. Surely you know the difference. Travel ban, NOT an if u r here ban.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Maybe u shouldn't spout what u hear from MSLSD. He was Stuck with that lawyer b/c AG wasn't confirmed yet and, no staffing.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr News flash jellyfish, NON U.S CITIZENS DON'T HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR PROTECTIONS.
@seanhannity Got a new EO you can run by POTUS. Taxes taken to support refugees will be taken from Hillary supporters and Liberals ONLY.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr I'm not the one jumping for joy for letting these people into this country snowflake. Yall want em, yall support em.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr And we were STILL taking in refugees when this temporary ban was implemented DUMMY, that never stopped.
@CoFemale @lsarsour She's happy that more of her Sharia Law abiding folks can now join her to help takeover our country.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr And I'm sure you wouldn't mind letting move in with u, and spending your hard earned $ to take care of them. How kind of u
@DogTheBOOTYhntr You haven't seen mass entry yet, just wait, the politically charged judges took care of that.
@DogTheBOOTYhntr Oh that's a good one. So just ignore DOJ, DHS and Intel Chief's warnings that it's impossible to properly vet these people?
@machucartier So tell me which laws has our POTUS broken thus far? Since the Left knows all. Decency, that's just an opinion, nothing more
@machucartier NO comparison whatsoever.
@machucartier A father defending his daughter as apposed to Fed Judges ignoring Const Law in order to advance their political agendas.
@ABC Just another display of severe overreach by Liberal judges who choose to ignore their duty to interpret Constitutional Law. Damn shame
@toddcohen @WalshFreedom Yep, a win for Non Americans all around the world to flood this country and turn it into Europe. America FIRST.
@DavidRadou1 @WalshFreedom  Remember that when they let mass entry in to this country, and your living next to several Syrians.
@WalshFreedom Liberals and Liberal policies have destroyed this country the last 8 years. Now they'll ignore ethics to uphold their ideology
@SenatorHeitkamp So we need a Liberal to follow your failed Liberal policies right? Uhmm TOOL BAD. You people need to get over yourselves.
@WalshFreedom Just came out that they upheld the lower courts decision. Damn shame we have Federal Judges that refuse to follow Const Law
@bradsanders619 @SenatorTomUdall Just General Mattis. Even they couldn't deny the history of a decorated general to defend this country.
@SenatorTomUdall Let's be clear Senator, you and your constituents are going to oppose all of POTUS'S picks because yall are sore losers.
@RoyBlunt Senator, maybe you should provide play do, hot choc,coloring books, binkies and handkerchiefs for their tears to all the Democrats
@drewcaps1 @DailyCaller Cherokee with high cheek bones, because her family said so right....  bawahhh
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org Liberal entities and Liberal professors. They can spin the Truth all they want, and u can willfully neglect it. ‚úå
@SenatorTomUdall @latimes Indian tribes have had over 300 meetings with government officials. They agreed with the plan long ago.Another LIE
@thebigshotprof @AntonioFrench @marthaoutlaw Some truths are just to difficult for people to grasp and understand. It takes mental strength.
@fatimamedina57 @ABC Trop mauvais terroriste musulman radical ne se soucient pas de l'amour et la fraternit√© et nos enseignements
@ABC OK Mr Pope sir, how bout u let all the refugees u want into the Vatican. Easy to criticize when you're hidden behind a fortress.
@thebigshotprof @AntonioFrench @marthaoutlaw That's just the Left's brainwashing strategy they've used against people like you to get votes.
@AntonioFrench Might wanna take a look to see who endorsed Hillary Clinton.. Hypocrites as usual. https://t.co/mt1zLA9kkL
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org. Hands of Bill Clinton. 1994 Crime Bill destroyed inner city communities..FACT. https://t.co/3tDiCtrOBd
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org And 1 more you'll probably deny..The most devastating Bill to affect the black community in decades came at the...
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org Can you magically change the voting records of the Senate for the last 200 years? Facts CAN'T be refuted, sorry.
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org Learn more....https://t.co/qoS8N94jFd
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org  I can do what u did, but Facts can't be refuted. So here's a  history lesson for you. https://t.co/JhKWEEe0YL
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org You can find all kinds of BS on the Internet. Slavery, Civil Rights Acts, KKK, 14th Amendment, Segregation. FACT
@JoyAnnReid @DebraMessing @jbouie @Slate Typical woe is me article with a victim hood mentality. Everybody's a racist, poor me. Getting old
@nytimes Why do these Leftist publications keep insisting on labeling things that they are not? Criticizing doesn't equate to an "attack".
@jehamlin @nytimes NO answer? You'd rather re tweet a question instead of answering it?Are u referring to the ltr and the ones that read it?
@SenWarren Just do us all a favor and become a recluse, you'd contribute more to this country by doing so.
@womensmarch Good Lord you people are insufferable.
@jehamlin @nytimes What 4 men are referring to?
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org Oh okay then. So hundreds of years of history just gets flipped and reversed out of nowhere? Brainwashed much?
@Benj_oman @ABC @NILC_org You might want to research who the party of hate and racism was in those days, and are still to this day. Go learn
@SenatorCardin I'm pretty sure it was heard, multiple times actually.
@Dotdogz @Martina @ShawnSRocks *was not*
@Dotdogz @Martina @ShawnSRocks I'm pretty sure Rosa Parks was a Senator breaking Senate rules on the Senate floor.
@theblaze And a high schoolers political opinion is important how exactly??
@Ardhen723 Jesus dude. Do you have to put has tags in every tweet.
@Nord_Eh @Ardhen723 That's what I do to trespassing Liberals...... LOL
@Nord_Eh @Ardhen723 Labels.... you guys prove yourselves more and more every day. That's why yall lost, and will continue to LOSE.
@Nord_Eh @Ardhen723 LOL, that's where rich little pacifier sucking millennials live. Gen X not so much. Good try tho.
@Nord_Eh @Ardhen723 You scared bra?
@Ardhen723 Might want to take a look at that map buddy. Dems are screwed. Can u say filibuster.....
@Ardhen723 Be gone already. So big and bad u can't even show your face on you TL. Don't want everyone to see what a TOOL looks like?
@Violet_Boregard @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Attack, that's what yall do best. Then play it off like it's all us. Victim hood mentality.
@Violet_Boregard @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing That's the Left's problem, always having to Judge Simone based on others claims. Pitty
@Ardhen723 Ohh your so bad ass. Aren't u the cleverest guy out there. Go away troll
@Violet_Boregard @DebraMessing Take your pick. Such a wide variety to choose from.
@Violet_Boregard @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing I don't know about you, but I'd rather know someone Myself before labeling them a racist.
@TheDrewFro66 Documented by who, the accuser right? That's one side. Many blacks have come out to oppose that very accusation. Do they count
@Ardhen723 @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Dude fuck u and your basic intellect. Name calling and labeling just like a typical cry baby Lib
@TheDrewFro66 So does One questionable event 30 years ago equate to being unqualified and unfit for the job? We'd all new sol then..
@Ardhen723 @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing 	On someone ready to learn and bring a new look to the position. A very intellectually &amp;bright man
@Ardhen723 @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing So keep putting the same ole same ole in these positions and have nothing change, or take a chance
@Ardhen723 @MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Might wanna do a little research.Obama didn't receive near this amount of obstruction 4 his cabinet
@TheDrewFro66 so Democrats have never nominated people with a questionable history? Uh. Ok. If that's what u choose to believe.
@DavidWalker991 @JustineMarrion Typical Leftist response. We r drinking kool aid, Trump is our hero, we worship him.. such sound assumptions
@JamilSmith @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @maddow @MSNBC Never seen so much whining in my life..You people are so insufferable.
@DavidWalker991 @JustineMarrion Oooh. Such scary words. Bug bad social networking boy....  Oh noz
@wowjesus911 @DebraMessing Ignorance at its best. Typical Leftist response...cry racism..wahhh. Go learn something instead of spewing hatred
@washingtonpost NO, they Protect criminals.
@larrytucker555 So does it make it not against the rules?.... bawaaawhatever.
@TheRealModerate @DebraMessing GOP...that's a bit broad don't ya think. But I guess that's the style of the Left. Label everyone. Misguided
@CNN @SenWarren And rightfully so. Sen Warren was out of bounds, and clearly broke Senate rules, that's just the Facts, like it or not.
@scrivener50 @nytimes So that would include Pelosi, Reid, Waters, Lewis, Casey, Booker, Wasserman Schultz, McCain, Graham. Who am I missing?
@nytimes Damn. So many clueless people. There's only One Fact here, Sen Warren broke Senate rules, PERIOD. Nothing else to see. Go learn...
@netwaregal @AlanIAbramowitz @nytimes *she*
@PattyArquette @DebraMessing @GOP Facts only meter when it's to the Left's benefit right? You Hollyweirdos are insufferable.
@gabitoneloto @PattyArquette @GOP  Yall will be dumb tho apparently.
@PattyArquette @DebraMessing @GOP Get your facts straight Clueless. Sen Warren broke Senate rules, PERIOD. Facts matter right?
@netwaregal @AlanIAbramowitz @nytimes NO, he used the rules of the Senate. Go study government. Reading a letter is NOT free speech.clueless
@AlanIAbramowitz @DebraMessing @nytimes Rightfully so, she broke Senate rules. How will the Left Spin this one?
@JustineMarrion @nytimes She has years of experience in the education system. Maybe not as a teacher, but as an advocate.
@JustineMarrion @nytimes So they just Had to throw in the "Republican donor" part? Inexperienced doesn't equal unqualified.
@OurRevolution @DebraMessing That's because it was against the rules. Do you follow rules Debra?
@nytimes well that headline doesn't sound bipartisan at all.....Oh yea, it's because that's one thing the NYT is NOT.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing I have, I'm sure u have as well. Regardless I think he'll be better than the last two, but only time will tell
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Where'd that come from? It's all accusations, that's all it is.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing But the "letter" is One person's opinion. Convicting a KKK killer directly refutes this belief, does it not?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing So is blocking cabinet nominees just because u lost and your sore ok? They're acting like children.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing So people should be judged based in a single act or position from 30 years ago, even if it's in question?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Which Will Not be proven. Dems are just blowing smoke to be a nuisance and block democracy, Period.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing So you're saying he hasn't been called a racist by MSM, politicians and the general public?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Actual events according to ONE person's opinion. MSM and Dems have labeled him such, W/O Factual evidence.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing It's not about ME, It's about Sessions! Do you think Messing knows him to claim him a racist? NO. U see now?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Gets tiring being called a racist, homophobe, Bigot, sexist...by people that don't even know u.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing You have no context, but yet so many do judge, that's the Point.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing But yet how were the bakers that declined to take part of a wedding treated when claiming religious freedom?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Of course you'll deny, that's what yall do. To label based on nothing but difference of opinion, that's Dems
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Proving a point. Surely you can see that.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing Yet the Left makes wild claims and accusations about people just because they disagree. U can't deny that.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing According to the Left's philosophy I am, even tho I base that decision on religious freedoms. It's hipocracy.
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing If I'm politely decline to take part in a gay wedding, yet I have several gay friends, am I a bad person?
@MartinHorner09 @DebraMessing It doesn't matter if it's true or not to you people. You'll just automatically determine that it is.
@DebraMessing Do you supposedly tolerant and loving people ever get tired of tarnishing the names of good people? True colors being shown.
@_gordee @uncleslice @mcuban @joelpollak @jaketapper LOL, he's been in office two weeks, what the hell are u talking about? Make believe
@uncleslice @mcuban @joelpollak @jaketapper Well you haven't been reading very much. Obama naming the 7 countries, what else ya got?
@uncleslice @mcuban @joelpollak @jaketapper Like Obama, And his voters did for his entire 8 years? Kind of hypocritical don't ya think?
@SenAlexander Good grief. So many people being mind-f***ed by the Left and mainstream media. Oh noz, mass Hysteria, Armageddon....RUN
@uncleslice @mcuban @joelpollak @jaketapper That's just rich. We never heard "it's Bush's fault" I guess. Lol, so misguided and delusional.

@SenBobCasey Dude, you should probably just get some sleep and call it a day, NO Republican is gonna be the deciding vote to out DeVos,
@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump  You are so clueless. By ur beliefs, you'd rather take care of refugee kids than our own. America FIRST!
@SenBobCasey Well I guess some people are stupid enough to to believe your party's blatant  lies. Lol snowflakes are so delusional &amp;clueless
@SenBobCasey Why do you Idiots proclaiming this EO unconstitutional? Do u think we r stupid enuff to believe u? Keep losing seats, 2018. Lie
@gabycam @DebraMessing Real cute u cry baby Libs think POTUS is our "hero" just because we voted for him over a career criminal. Real mature
@gabycam @DebraMessing That's exactly what he's doing. Obama named them but wouldn't act, Trump is, so don't quite get ur alt facts BS.
@CNN Who in the hell cares. Bunch of cry baby sore ass losers. So Liberal wealthy high and mighty's disagree with a R POTUS, what a shock üò≠üò¢
@CNNnewsroom @MaxineWaters @POTUS @CNN More Trump Hating reporting from the Clinton News Network. Yet another weak ass interview, Pitiful.
@DebraMessing So Obama issued SIX travel bans, Clinton 6, Bush 6, Reagan 4 and Crater banned Iranians. Trump does it, Hysteria. Hypocrites
@DebraMessing Obama is the one that names the 7 countries as top terrorist supporters in the world.Yall act like he got the idea out his ass
@ebbitt @Karoli @DebraMessing @POTUS LOL, yee of such misinformation. But that's a typical Leftist. Trump successes=500+, bankruptcies=FOUR!
@Karoli @DebraMessing Statement from Nancy Pelosi...."we have to pass the bill first, so that we can find out what's in it," Classic. Hahaha
@DebraMessing Must take a lot out of ya being such an Intolerant, free speech hating, riot antagonizing supporter of thuggery and violence.
@DebraMessing Guess you were too tired from bashing our POTUS and everything related to him. That includes the 60 million + that voted 4 him
@CoFemale @ClaireUnderoath LOL. Done that plenty of times.
@CoFemale @ClaireUnderoath As you should. I grew up in the South with grandmother's and a mother that would slap the snot out of me if bad.
@CoFemale @ClaireUnderoath OMG your are freaking hilarious. Love reading your comments. Teach these young fools how the real world works. Ha
@AtlantaFalcons From a Saints diehard, I feel bad for you Falcons fans. Congrats on a Great game, and a great year. You made the NFL proud.
@84LumberNews @YouTube When will you big wig executives learn that you don't mix business and politics, especially sensitive subjects.Idiots
@Audi LOL. Yall dumb. Hahahaha
@SCBANDMOM @SenBobCasey So he was put on the bench to over reach his authority and power? Non citizens do NOT have Connstitutional Rights.
@SCBANDMOM @SenBobCasey His reasonings were absolutely NOT based in the Constitution. Would u like to bet on that?
@SenBobCasey So POTUS isn't allowed to disagree with a judge and his ruling? So judges can't be criticized? We'll remember that for Gorsuch.
@SenBobCasey Telling the truth does not equate to an attack. He had NO constitutional authority to do what he did, and u goons KNOW it.
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost Too bad they weren't smart enough to do the same. There's was just frivolous spending, Eric's had purpose.
@lsarsour Oh really? Just like you love Mrs. Gabriel for having a differing opinion? You have the right to exist, but NOT under Sharia in US
@ndkauffm @litsypittser @FoxNews @UCBerkeley Protesters huh? U r an absurd idiot sir, u got that right. Violent Thugs beating people, get it
@CoFemale @tinastullracing @CBSNews Jeez. Their is absolutely no morality or ethics left in journalism today. Just one reason why I quit.
@Jill_Hamilton @SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump LOL, coming from a liberal... how sweet. The most two faced hypocritical people in the country
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Bunch of sore ass losers. People asking for an impeachment need to go back to school and learn how things work
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm you mean unless he's one of you right? What about the way yall are attacking Judge Gorsuch?  Hypocrites
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost And yet you all are bitching after 97 grand. Hypocrite much man (u are a man aren't u?)
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost And lastly and final point, then I'm done with this bs. The Obama's spent over 85 MILLION of OUR tax $ FACT
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost So people with a differing opinion than yours are racist cultists right? We all see where the HATE is, Lib
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost What point have u tried to make? All you've done is name call and label bro.
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost Oh poor me, give me for free, white men privileged and entitled, they mean and bad,they racist. 	U ignorant
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost And it's ignorant to call someone u don't know privileged just because they're white. U R not very bright.
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost Study history. Find out what party has discriminated against your people for centuries. Use your brain.
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost You live in fantasy land bro. Blame the white people, that shits getting old. You're clearly the racist.
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost Wow you are one angry black mutha fuka huh. U love to throw around that racism accusation huh?
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost You seem quite angry fellow. I see a lot of name calling from you. Shows your maturity level. Tolerance bro
@jumpinmidflight @washingtonpost And who exactly are the "u fcks" are you referring to?  So were u ok with paying for the Obama's vacations?
@CNN I think many polls were proven to NOT know what the hell they were talking about, so this one is no different.
@CNN And yet he still beat Hillary. Poor butt hurt Clinton News Network. Get over it. Try putting out ONE descent story on POTUS. Wahhhh
@washingtonpost LOL. Add up how much the Obama's spent in taxpayer money from all their vacations they took. Weren't bitching then huh?
@StephenAtHome You're a non funny no talent Douchebag. Race baiting, delusional, TOOL.
@StephenAtHome Dude you are such a TOOL. Nobody watches your shitty show. Find some new material, u whiney, sore loser, cry baby lil biotch.
@RLashawnita what's up
@BeauWillimon @DebraMessing @nytimes You mean like all the wonderful Respect the press has shown him the last year? He is 100% justified.
@JoyAnnReid @DebraMessing @YahooNews Wonderful display of "tolerance"  Keep showing your true colors Left, and R's will win because of it üëè
@Hadas_Gold @YouTube Wonder how many times Al Sharpton visited the Whitehouse the last eight years?? That RACIST was acceptable tho I guess.
@resisterhood @DebraMessing And yet he still reacted in an absolute over reach of power, a tactic the Left loves to use.
@MLE_Mech @CNN  That doesn't make much of a difference. It's an absolute over reach by a WASHINGTON State judge.
@ChrisMurphyCT When will you Idiot and DISHONEST Liberal politicians discuss FACTS?? Stop calling a temp travel ban a Muslim ban. Wah Losers
@CNN So if someone is let in to the U.S from one of the 7 banned countries, and kills someone, shouldn't this Judge face murder charges?
@CNN And how exactly is POTUS breaking the law? Just another example of Liberal over reach.
@AlecMacGillis @DebraMessing @washingtonpost Add up all the tax dollars from all the Obama's vacations then get back to us.. hypocrite much?
@realDonaldTrump Do what ya gotta do to keep us safe sir. And just block out the idiocy being thrown at u by leftist wackos. WE support YOU!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President, the normal hard working everyday person in this country stand behind you, and realize how hard u work 4 us TY
@GlennF Throwing fits and acting like children, rioting, blocking free speech, protests, threatening POTUS, Hate = Trump still President LOL
@Martina @HuffPostPol Don't think the Left can deny that Soros isn't paying for many of the protests, whether they want to admit it or not.
@seanhannity Hey Sean, I was just told by a nut, that "snowflake" is so 2016. How bout we name them Soros-bots,? U got an idea 4 a new name?
@bethanypurdue @DebraMessing How bout we call all you fanatical rioters and protesters, hmm... Soros-bots, that better?
@bethanypurdue @DebraMessing You prob read it right, you just cant quite comprehend Truth. You're just blind to the obvious.
@ezlusztig For all you that keep whining and begging  for an impeachment...  Wahhhhhh we lost, I want my mommy... hahaha
@ezlusztig Oh cry me a river. Never seen so many adults act like a child throwing a temper tantrum. Get over it, accept it, and grow up
@KeithOlbermann You bleeding heart Libs are worse than a 5 year old when you take away his favorite toy. The endless temper tantrum. Wahhh
@bethanypurdue @DebraMessing Typical response from a snowflake with no experience in the real world. You're being Brainwashed, be strong.
@DebraMessing Trying to backtrack your words now? Just admit it, the Left despises  those with a differing opinion who practice Free Speech.
@CNN  Hey Clinton News Network, you so called journalists, using that word very very loosely, are a complete and utter JOKE. Find real news.
@Madonna @mdnaskin  What up HAS BEEN
@KristySwansonXO @FoxNews Finally someone in Hollywood being an adult. Shocker.
@JesseArreguin You're an absolute disgrace sir. You stand up for these idiot rioters, and therefore should immediately Resign.
@Debra@DebraMessing) Messing
@DebraMessing So your essentially approving of the behavior of these idiots at Berkley, and promoting more of the same? You R off UT Rocker
@rainydaydr @goldengateblond  Poor thing. You should enroll in community college, maybe they won't brain wash you as much as a university.
@DebraMessing Dilusional, Hollwierd, elitist..embracing violence, destruction of property, disturbing the peace and vandalism, real classy.
@goldengateblond The man has done more for this country in 12 days than Obama did in 8 years. The man works his ass off. Bunch of haters
@NickersNic16 @SenatorShaheen IT'S NOT A Muslim Ban! Anyone who believes the rhetoric of the Left and the media,is just a lost lil snowflake
@SenatorShaheen Why must you Liberal politicians continue to lie? We see through all the lies, it's NOT a Muslim ban. Lies=losing seats, GFY
@NARAL LOL. Resist all yall want. POTUS, both cabinets, majority governorships, and soon to get even worse for yall in 2018. Clueless
@lucidcontent So what's that got to do with  HIS qualifications?  Must be nice to be a Lib and have nothing but perfect people in the family
@mcuban @tedcruz So is that why the Dems are doing it now? Tit for tat?  If so, it goes to show just how mature they really are.
@newtgingrich because he's a delusional, temper tantrum throwing, play do needing, teddy bear hugging, crying heart nincompoop Jack ass Lib
@SenatorShaheen IT'S NOT A FREAKING MUSLIM BAN. Damn you Lib politicians are such phony ass cry baby fear mongering Spin artist. Liars
@SenSchumer Oh, you mean we need an Anti American,, pro choice, pro gay Marriage, LBGT loving, non constitutionalist Liberal nut job right?
@SenSchumer Oh now Chucky, I see your still up to your typical Liberal Spin job. Do you not yet understand why Dems r losing so many seats?
@SenSchumer Oh Chucky, would you get lost already. Libs were gonna have a problem with whoever POTUS nominated for SCOTUS. Stop whining,baby
@MartinHeinrich It's NOT Muslim ban. Why do you Lefties insist on spinning the truth constantly. We're not dumb, keep losing seats then..
@SenSchumer You're such a tool. Just delay the inevitable and prove to the country what your party is really all about. SORE LOSERS.. wahhhh
@SenJackReed Doesn't matter Lib, your outnumbered. So wahhhhhh. Go get you coloring books and play do ready.
@HxDilettante @SenBobCasey That LAW, through Executive Order, IS the LAW, so therefore the AG HAS to follow orders to uphold the LAW. SPIN
@SenBobCasey For the love of God, why the heck do YOU Liberal politicians spin the actuall FACTS to the American people, pushing Falsehoods
@SenSchumer Give it up Chucky, your falsehood accusations thrown at Sessions by your party will all be for NOT.  NO law was violated either.
@SenSchumer Uh Chuky.... HE HASN'T BROKEN THE LAW, dummy. People that actually believe the Lib Spin are just as naive.
@SenSchumer The fact that YOU don't understand that it's the AG's duty and job to uphold Federal Laws, which the Exec Order Is, is Chilling.
@CNN If your network cared as much for Americans in poverty, and the homeless, as you do refugees, you might actually have more people watch
@Martina @HuffPostPol Maybe he should make it clearer. LEFTIST media,  Barack is gone, time to report Facts, and not fantasy land Spin job.
@JamesELundin @chelseahandler Like your party can talk moral virtue. Oh that's right, there's always a reasonable excuse to cover for it smh
@chelseahandler @wordpressdotcom I'm sure there's never been such claims made against Liberal politicians, oh wait, didn't one occupy the WH
@chelseahandler They should do the same before giving someone their own talk show. Guess you'd be shit out of luck wouldn't you.
@IlladelphAC @SenSchumer LOL. Why do so many of u Liberals keep saying this? You do know that only FOUR people have been confirmed right?
@SenSchumer So how exactly do you know they will do Nothing to improve our safety? Can you see into the future, do you have a crystal ball?
@ChrisMurphyCT When will American come FIRST Senator?  Oh, nevermind, we now have a POTUS that actually puts us First. Feed AMERICA'S kids!

@DebraMessing @nytimes Good Grief. There is absolutely Zero Ethics in journalism nowadays. And the poor people that read and believe it. Lol

@kimballnbitsII @Chas_54865 @Impeach_D_Trump @CNN Yeah, that sure does prove your claim that Sessions is racist doesn't it? Clueless
@Chas_54865 @Impeach_D_Trump @CNN You should try not becoming a puppet to the Left and research before coming up with a falsehood.
@BrookeBCNN @POTUS @carlbernstein @CNN POTUS is holding the media accountable, and clearly you left leaning folks absolutely hate it. Truth
@BrookeBCNN @POTUS @carlbernstein @CNN Moats of your telecast was nothing but Spin. Putting words in POTUS'S mouth like CNN always does.
@BrookeBCNN We want the TRUTH, your absolutely correct, too bad CNN does not care to report the Truth. Now yall are being held accountable.
@BrookeBCNN Would you use the words he actually said, WATER BOARDING, and stop saying he promotes torture.Is there any Ethics left in media?

@0Hour1Army @PiculiarByPayal @dallasschools Michelle, show this to Hannity or O'Reilly so they can show this on air and teach her a lesson
@Noraeve7 @KristySwansonXO Too bad she didn't get lock jaw.
@KristySwansonXO Great role models are they not? Maybe that's where they got the idea to wear va jay jay hats. Classy.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems They are called ILLEGALS  for a reason.
@Martina Politics aside, are there any up and coming American men to watch out for on the tennis seen. Miss the days of Sampras, Agassi, J.C
@Martina @mrosescotland but she blocked me soon after. Lol
@Martina @mrosescotland it was a response to another poster that said she is frustrated. I said that's how we've felt for 8 years.
@mrosescotland @Martina I didn't say anything about ignorance, hate and prejudice did I? You all on Left just gotta put labels on people huh
@mrosescotland @Martina that's how we've felt for the last 8 years. Yall will be aight. Ha
@SenJackReed So is sending drones, killing innocent people, a better alternative? How many people died at Obama's hand?
@RLashawnita Hey friend. You just get on Twitter?  I started mine a couple days ago. Lot of crazy people..lol. does Tre tweet?
@SenSchumer Oh Senator, how you Libs spin stories to fit your ill conceived narrative. Health care-gov funded abortion, two DIFFERENT things
@SenSchumer My tax dollars Shouldn't fund abortions, Period. You people that support giving your money for abortions, then go Donate it.
@THEHermanCain Oh please oh please.

@Barb7598 @DebraMessing H20 a Lie, chopping down trees- big whoop, what artifacts, buried Arrowheads? No protected lands, Indians signed del
@LOLGOP @DebraMessing https://t.co/ePNZdLL8Vc
@DaShanneStokes @DebraMessing Congress, Senate, POTUS, Governorships, and soon to be SCOTUS.... lol resist all you want. #keeplosingseats
@YourAnonCentral @DebraMessing @WPTV Wow. You really put the spin on what the proposed Bill Actually says. You should Fact Check yourself.
@DebraMessing some of you Liberals remind me of the chics that lived in the tree on the movie Without a Paddle.
@DebraMessing Becoming energy independent and providing thousands of jobs... yep sounds like a disaster alright.
@lawin2005 @Martina @washingtonpost Typical Left, making a big deal over the dumbest things.
@lawin2005 @Martina @washingtonpost protesting One day after the inauguration doesn't seem to me as if the Left is giving him a chance.
@elwyn5150 I'm glad to know you are a perfect person that has never had a typo in their life. Good for you. You must be very proud. üëèüëè
@Jacque_blu That's very true. If only there was ONE right answer.
@grannyshrek I just started twitter yesterday, and I'm clueless to how it all works, but you rock.
@grannyshrek He's definitely not on his list. We can just thank the Lord Hillary isn't selecting our next SCOTUS.
@Jacque_blu I got hammered for misspelling politics in my bio. Very new to this, but some people are relentless huh? Enjoy your night
@Jacque_blu agreed
@Jacque_blu My cousin is a feminist die hard Liberal and professor. We debate constantly, although she tires of me quickly.
@Jacque_blu @Martina Google it right quick. They were pretty much destroyed. Do u think folks can use religion to disagree with gay Marriage
@elwyn5150 @JamalBuchet @womensmarch @DebraMessing are you 5 bro?
@Jacque_blu @Martina Do you think the bakers that declined to make a cake for a gay wedding, based on their religion, got what they deserved
@Jacque_blu @Martina I don't support government funded abortion. As a Christian I believe abortion is wrong.
@Jacque_blu @Martina Yes they should have the same rights, although I don't believe TG'S should be allowed to use bathroom of their choice.
@TuckerCarlson @chelseahandler @FLOTUS @KristySwansonXO Thanks for having on my high school crush!  Kristy is still beautiful.
@Martina @washingtonpost I grew up watching you, you were one of my favorites, but are you gonna give POTUS one iota of a chance?
@DLoIndustries Good one. Although I'm pretty it didn't reach her.
@DLoIndustries @MotherJones Since your such a feminist, have you congratulated Conway on becoming the 1st female POTUS campaign Mgr to win?
@Jacque_blu @Martina You might want to go back and read your own tweet. The Left has proven that they are the party of hate. Keep labeling..
@Jacque_blu @Martina So because I may have a difference of opinion, then I must be labeled? That's what your saying? Uhmm sure, OK then
@PettyBettyBB @Martina @JoeTrippi Time will tell. Whodat...
@PettyBettyBB @Martina @JoeTrippi He did dis both sides, but that's what people love. He's showing that he is for the people and America 1st
@Martina @PettyBettyBB @JoeTrippi Obama referred to himself 75 times- Trump 3, while referring to "we the people" 45 times. What's the prob?
@RepMiaLove Thank you.
@RepTomRice Thank you very much. We, the God fearing Christians of this country stand behind you.
@SenatorShaheen Well there have been accounts of Dead people voting have there not? Leave it to Libs to make a big deal about nothing.
@SenatorTimScott @nikkihaley Light a fire under their derriere's Senator!
@SenatorTomUdall @SenSchumer Why don't yall stop blocking his cabinet for no reason and let POTUS get his staff in place so he can make good
@SenatorTomUdall @SenSchumer Like it only takes ONE day to do the things he promised. Dakota and Keystone, hiring freeze, TPP, Mexico City.
@MarieTitus9 @womensmarch @DebraMessing I've seen plenty of interviews, trust me, most of them have no clue.
@CascinoLMSW @womensmarch @DebraMessing last I checked you only get 140 characters. When you finish and your negative 1, you improvise. Duh
@seanhannity can you talk POTUS into considering going with ted cruz for SCOTUS?
Do you think Ted Cruz would make an excellent choice for SCOTUS?
@chickilopiccolo @ManMet80 @MeatballMom2 so what rights do men have that women don't?.......waiting.....  you have the same I do. Cryi wahhh
@Martina I think it's a risky law myself. Don't know what sparked Gov Edward's to pass this. Our relations with police and community is good
@Martina @HuffPostPol You shouldn't dis our state either. You've probably never even stepped foot here.
@Martina @HuffPostPol You should thank Obama for states coming down hard on those who resist. Democrat governor to thank as well.
@JamalBuchet Thanks. Blind as a bat on this phone.
@Martina  Typical. Libs love putting labels on people. You disagree with them then your a racist, homophobe, anti semetic, sexist, communist
@brianfobyrne @DebraMessing Only 274 to go to match Obama. Righting the Wrong. How sweet it is.
@jessesingal OMG you snowflakes are so naive and gullible. It wasn't brought up because it's FAKE...  puppets
@womensmarch @DebraMessing you fools don't even know what the hell your "protesting"  Oh he said sumthin nasty bout a woman in private.. wah
@MileyCyrus your such an inspiration to young girls everywhere. Your so wholesome, and so knowledgeable about the world and polotics. NOT
@Madonna such a fine example you set for young women in this country. If they watch your shows, you teach them how to touch theirselves. Sik
@SenBobCasey I suppose launching drone strikes and killing innocent people is a better alternative? Or offer a terrorist a job maybe.
@SenSchumer why don't you get out of the way, and start confirming President Trump's cabinet.....
@kimguilfoyle absolutely gorgeous
@MarthaPlimpton @DebraMessing and let those not willing to do so-  murder- harvest and dissect organs- careful not to crush the skull. LiFE
@marcorubio Senator Rubio- Senators McCain and Graham are both going to confirm Tillerson for SOS. Are you willing and ready to do the same?
@tedcruz  Senator Cruz- would you consider taking a SCOTUS position? You should be at top of POTUS'S list. Ensure our conservative values.
@MaxDroid @Letha310 @AshleyJudd @DebraMessing How'd that turn out for him? Wahhhhhh
@MarthaPlimpton @DebraMessing Wow. Glorifying the killing of life? You people are beyond SICK.
@michellemalkin will people ever wake up to who the True party of Hate is? So many mindless puppets out there.Glad to see you educating them
@JudgeJeanine Judge, you are such a beautiful lady. Class Act. So glad I get to watch you do your thing.
@DebraMessing Trump thanks you for publicly dissing him, along with your fellow Hollyweirdos, you helped us common folk make up our minds üòÇüòÜ
@DebraMessing Good for you ladies, way to go. By the way, Trump is still President. Hahaha
@DebraMessing @AshleyJudd  Hollyweird at it's best. And you wonder why Trump won. Keep alienating yourselves from real America.
@JudgeJeanine loved the interview with "Hillary's America" director @DineshDSouza Judge!
@JudgeJeanine @RepChrisCollins Amen
@BretBaier could you teach your counterpart on CNN- you know, the gray hair guy with glasses- what true ethics in journalism looks like?
@sylvanica @glennbeck good for you.
@DebraMessing do you Hollywierdos realize your partly to blame for Trump winning? Keep spewing your hate, Democrats will keep losing seats üòÇ
@sylvanica @glennbeck where the hell did I complain about people marching? Looks like your trying to hard to put the spin on things
@sylvanica @glennbeck I'm a conservative, we know our Constitution and believe in it more than you Liberals ever will.
@sylvanica @glennbeck dude you can march- speak- write whatever the hell you want- I've bled to uphold those constitutional rights u have
@sylvanica @glennbeck try getting shot at daily before you talk about having guts to walk down the street with a lot of women.
@sylvanica @glennbeck I'll spell it out- you say it takes guts to march, I said fight for your country, that's guts. Get it??
@sylvanica @glennbeck dude u r all over the place. Typical Liberal Spin. Re  interpreting a sentence to suit your own narrow mind.
@sylvanica @glennbeck sit behind your computer and play your fantasy games- because you are clueless to how the world operates.
@sylvanica @glennbeck oh- it takes guts to march in the street? Keep tooting your own horn. Go fight for your country, then talk having guts
@sylvanica @glennbeck we didn't need coloring books- to hug strangers- cry sessions- cocoa- therapy dogs- play doh- false narrative marches.
@sylvanica @glennbeck sounds to me as if your the who needs a binkie. Yall lost- and refuse to accept that fact. So go cry with snowflakes.
@girlsreallyrule @NBCNightlyNews you and your fellow Hollyweirdos are part of the reason Trump won. Thanks So keep preaching your hate. Haha
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall did you even vote?
@sylvanica @glennbeck protesting will only strengthen Trump and the Republican party. So please snowflakes keep whining and preaching.
@sylvanica @glennbeck you can say what you want- disrespect all u want- but it changes nothing. President Trump  Nuff Said.
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall any man you know has done the same- so big deal. Hillary has done Disgusting things- and you voted 4her anywy
@sylvanica @glennbeck at least he's President- can't help all the snowflakes that are puppets to the lying Left.
@sylvanica @glennbeck must "burn" yall.... Trump IS POTUS still. Lol
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall psst- the I'd di f*** many-"without their consent" was Bill Clinton.... so who's worse? Tough one huh...
@sylvanica @glennbeck Jesus sees where the True hate is. The Left is acting like a child that just had a toy taken away. It's pathetic bro.
@oreillyfactor do these deranged Hollywierdos actually know that they are helping Trump. The more they preach to us, the more we detest them
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall oh you deniers will never get it. Stay in your fantasy bubble and keep being a puppet to the Left.
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall you do know who's been accused multiple times of sexual assault, while his wife paid and threatened them yea?
@VanJones68 look at all the whiny snowflakes.
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall thought I made myself pretty clear. Your angry quotes sounds very Bill esk
@nicoleamurray @LadyPortofCall @AnnCoulter that sounds a lot like Bill Clinton your quoting...
@sylvanica @glennbeck so I should be behaving like you Liberals are? Needing coloring books, therapist, cry-ins, cocoa, hug &amp; scream fests..
@TomiLahren When will we be able to see you on Fox News permanently? You are too Rad not to be seen on a major news station.
@sylvanica @glennbeck I worship God and God only sir. I would suggest you look through many of these women's interviews and see for yourself
@glennbeck half of them don't even know why the hell they were out there. Oh the poor misguided.
@AnnCoulter just a bunch of goody two shoes uppity white women who think they are better than everyone else.
