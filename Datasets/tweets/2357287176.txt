President’s speech now over. I think he spoke about an hour.
Trump says in Montana because of how Sen. Tester’s role in Admiral Jackson withdrawing as VA chief nominee.
Just made his first Pocohantas reference.
He’s just referred to Joe Biden as ‘Sleepy Joe.’ He said Biden challenged him. He says he’d take him down but not as fast as Gianforte could take him down.
Trump says he told Kavanaugh prior to hearing confirmation would be a piece of cake.
