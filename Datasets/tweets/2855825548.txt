@MehrsaBaradaran Beyond that cohort there's probably room for manipulation, which would be a bad thing.

@MehrsaBaradaran Jim Chen also shared a really interesting paper at the 2014 JOTWELL symposium on impact factor distribution, which showed the same basic thing as Leiter in that the journals of historically "elite" schools also dominated the left side of the distribution.	 https://t.co/2xueYneIbt
@MehrsaBaradaran FWIW from a non-law prof, it's doubtful that there's a much room for movement by gaming among the very top cohort. The very top USN ranked schools are also pretty consistently the top Leiter ranked faculties and Leiter's methodology runs wholly on citation count.
@AnthonyMKreis @JStephenClark @Omri_Marian @MehrsaBaradaran @at_hayashi Admittedly, the incentives may be different among flagships at top USN ranked law schools. But my school's flagship journal was considerably better ranked among flagships by W&amp;L than the school was by USN. Maintaining that was important to us, which meant gaming citations.
@AnthonyMKreis @JStephenClark @Omri_Marian @MehrsaBaradaran @at_hayashi My student experience, and the JOTWELL feedback I got, was that while faculty mostly don't care about W&amp;L, the student-run journals themselves did care.		I certainly cared, as W&amp;L placement was one of the few things I could use to defend my journal's funding from budget cuts.

@StickmanSouza @AJentleson Or, you know, we can secure democratic majorities and use those to quickly pass lots of legislation.		Either we value having the rule of law and checks on power, however inconvenient at times, or we don't. Bad actors in the GOP don't dictate our values.
@AJentleson The apparent Democratic appetite for an authoritarian POTUS who happens to share Democratic policy goals is really troubling to me.
@scottjshapiro That she's offering up that this might be a constitutional exercise of power delegated by Congress to POTUS is extremely disappointing.
@AnthonyMKreis That Congress knowingly and plainly legislated contrary to what he plans to do should also prove that he lacks delegated authority to do so.
@bungdan @dhnexon Both parties are still blind to the very real dangers of our system of checks and balances falling apart.		POTUS saying "if you won't appropriate the money I want I'll use statutory authority you gave me to take it anyway" is a fucking constitutional crisis not an opportunity.
@leahmcelrath @SpeakerPelosi She's one of the only people who might have standing to bring the kind of non-delegation doctrine claim that should be successful here.
The conservatives on SCOTUS, I'm thinking of Thomas and Alito here, should be outraged by this.		It will be a truly telling moment for whether they believe their own professed separation of powers principles when this reaches SCOTUS.
It's difficult for me to see how there could be a valid delegation of authority under such circumstances.		If POTUS may use a statutory delegation from Congress to override a different congressional decision, then Congress has unconstitutionally delegated its essential powers.
Just so we are all clear, POTUS has announced that because Congress would not pass legislation providing funding for his preferred border security policy, he will use statutory authority delegated by Congress for emergencies to fund that policy anyway.

@ichbinilya But that leaves lots of room for enjoying art. Art in the public domain? No problem. Artist dead? No problem (probably). Artist credibly changed their views? No problem (maybe). And if the views aren't bad enough then tolerating them for the art might be a worthwhile tradeoff.
@ichbinilya And I'm saying that's oversimplified. 		Does enjoying art always mean support? No, but enjoying art in a way that puts money in a living artist's pocket shows support, or at a minimun toleration, for their views. That you might miss out on some art isn't relevant to that fact.
@ichbinilya Seems a massive false dichotomy to me. There are degrees of bad views/behaviors and ways of enjoying art that doesn't support the artist's views/behaviors.		It's not "be okay with everything or enjoy nothing" so much as "what are you willing to tolerate to get the part you like?"
@CSChungLaw @ProfBainbridge I do wonder if percieved self-censorship is higher among law students.

@CSChungLaw The warnings were usually from students who probably didn't merit a top grade anyway, so it's hard to judge truth. But they did cause me to avoid electives taught by certain faculty.		I also took a @ProfBainbridge-like approach on exams, but I'd have done that regardless.
@CSChungLaw FWIW from a recentish student perspective, the bias concerns I heard about (or had myself) were faculty-member specific. Some faculty in particular (not you!) had reputations among the students for penalizing disagreement regardless of quality of work.

@RealDAnconia @roysteves @ZachWeiner Meh. If you give people a grace period to reorganize their assets in anticipation of the change I don't see that as an issue. It takes years for a constitutional amendment to be ratified anyway.
@RealDAnconia @roysteves @ZachWeiner Nah. I just think the current corporate form allows for the abuse of power by a more concentrated and less transparent group than when a democratically elected government abuses power.
@RealDAnconia @roysteves @ZachWeiner Nothing requires the use of the corporate form. Don't like the risk/reward trade-off of holding assets in a corporate entity? Don't use it and keep the assets owned by a human who the takings clause would still apply to.
@RealDAnconia @roysteves @ZachWeiner The first one: yes if the law otherwise allows it. 		The second one: not really practical. "Government" might be able, again if the statutes allow it, to order "Disney" to make something but it couldn't compel any of the real human content creators working there to do so.
@RealDAnconia @roysteves @ZachWeiner Makes sense to me. Corporations, as a legal fiction, should have the rights (and only the rights), the statutory scheme creating them contemplates.

@TrumpOutrage The law review article basically recognizes both of these things, but argues that both courts were wrong.  Be that as it may, I cannot see any possible majority of this SCOTUS repudiating its dicta in NIFB to hold a tax on capital as such is not a direct tax.
@TrumpOutrage To the extent Hylton is understood that way, it was overruled by Pollock. And though Pollock's specific holding was abrogated by the 16th Amendment, NIFB observed (in a part of the opinion signed on to by the liberals) that it's definition of direct taxes still holds.

@TrumpOutrage @FiveThirtyEight But, look, I'm all for giving it a shot. We got the 16th Amendment by  passing a nationally popular tax (the income tax) and having it get stuck down as unconstitutional. Maybe this plays out similarly in the long run.
@TrumpOutrage @FiveThirtyEight Hylton was understood to be a tax on a business, not on property ownership as such. This is a straight up wealth tax. Knowlton and NIFB (aka the ACA case) are the relevant precedents. 		https://t.co/vXNI8tPumK

A lot of the ones I grew up with, where I typically experienced the subbed version first, seem to me to be like a lot of early US sci fi and fantasy films. 		Fun, if it's your thing, but pretty much trash otherwise.		E.g.: https://t.co/w53Eze9eIj
@benGSchout @arthur_affect @nivenus @BootlegGirl I wouldn't know. I couldn't stomach more than like 3 episodes of Digimon, tbh. He felt the same way about Death Note.
@benGSchout @arthur_affect @nivenus @BootlegGirl No worries. Just @ me if you ever decide to lay it out on here.
@benGSchout @arthur_affect @nivenus @BootlegGirl I had this exact experience with a younger coworker trading "great" anime series. 		I'm like: Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop, and Mushi-shi.		He suggests Pokemon and Digimon.
@benGSchout @arthur_affect @nivenus @BootlegGirl Um... okay I'm really curious now.
@arthur_affect @nivenus @BootlegGirl I think there's also a familiarity bias. My preference for sub/dub varies almost entirely with which version I saw first. Voices are powerful in defining character, even if I don't speak the language. So the first voice *is* the voice in some indefinable sense.

@four4thefire The other take-away is that future witnesses will try to do the same thing as Whitaker since he will obviously suffer no consequences for his performance today, further undermining the ability of Congress to conduct effective oversight.

@thinkspin They didn't take him seriously at first. Remember when @HuffPost announced they would only cover his campaign under "entertainment"?

@imillhiser @BarackDaVote I'm pretty sure you are misreading Article 5 Section 7. Lt. Gov. is not an appointment subject to confirmation by the general assembly.

Congress, itoh, can look at things totally unconnected to Russia, like Ivanka's acquisition of Chinese trademarks while trade negotiations with China are ongoing.
@gary_stcharles @BenSasse Mueller sent it there *because it was outside the scope of his investigation.* 		Sasse is an utter phony. He occasionally makes noises but for two years he was in a position to get lots of his priorities advanced by trading them for confirmation votes.  Instead he pontificated.

@tribelaw @ewarren https://t.co/vXNI8tPumK
@JStephenClark Agreed. It's an awful provision that should have been totally deleted with the 16th Amendment instead of just narrowed.		But it wasn't. So, like the Electoral College, we are stuck with it until it gets changed by an amendment.
So, the first letter seems to be wrong. 		As for the second letter, it provides no explanation for why it says this wouldn't be a direct tax.		If this is all we have, and I can't think of anything else, SCOTUS will strike this down and likely do so with several liberal votes.
The first letter also inexplicably ignores the discussion in the Obamacare decision, NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 570-72 (2012), which reaffirms that taxes on real and personal as such are "direct taxes" after the 16th Amendment.		Here's the key part: https://t.co/US2NRVOto3
As you can see, the Knowlton court treated the estate tax at issue as a transaction based tax, not an ownership based tax. More, Knowlton seemed to define a "direct tax" as one "imposed on property, real or personal as such, because of its ownership and possession." That's broad.
That letter suggests that Knowlton held that the estate tax at issue wasn't a direct tax even even though it went right to the property. But that's not what Knowlton said. 		Here's the relevant language about the estate tax at issue: 		https://t.co/TKRVH45nEe https://t.co/s7goVn5Jtz
Whelp, if these are the best we got to defend Warren's tax, it's not going to survive a legal challenge. 		The first letter ignores the most recent case to speak to the interpretation of direct taxes and misreads the case it relies on: Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41, 47 (1900). https://t.co/e64gGqxm7o

@Quatr_us @Lollardfish Huh? I was not suggesting that. 		I was only observing that the idea "you are judged by the company you keep" is a basic lesson we learn as children. i.e., the sort of thing we learn from our grandmother as kids.
@derekjsherwood @GaltsGirl Yes, I know it's passed into the aphorism stage. I just push back because, in addition to being from a dubious source, it's also wrong. I've seen plenty of "no bills" (term for grand jury refusing to indict) in cases where there was lots of evidence.
@ed_des3maisons @tribelaw I'm curious to hear Prof. Tribe's reasoning on this point, because it seems to me that a tax on the value of capital (i.e. personal and real property) is pretty clearly a direct tax under that case and others like Knowles v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41, 47 (1900).
@ed_des3maisons @tribelaw No. It only made an exception for income taxes. There's a discussion on this in the Obamacare decision, NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 570-72 (2012).
@derekjsherwood @GaltsGirl I guess. I'll just go back to listening to those historical tunes by Nirvana, Green Day, and Smashing Pumpkins then.
@derekjsherwood @GaltsGirl Its not a historical quote. It's from former NYS Chief Judge Sol Wachtler. Wachtler later went to prison himself.
@tribelaw @BostonGlobe And, look, I *like* this proposal as a matter of public policy, but I don't see how it can be anything but a direct tax.
@tribelaw @BostonGlobe Can you explain why it's not a direct tax? Real and Personal Property taxes are direct taxes, and the wealth tax would undoubtedly be taxing based on those and other assets. 		What's the distinction I'm missing here?

You go down the left side based on the offense level and any adjustments to it, then go right across the columns based on the offender's criminal record.

@Evan_McMullin And the question of: Did Bannon flip or is he getting indicted for being an accessory after the fact to the federal hacking crimes?
@jentaub If it's Bannon, then he's either flipped or there's another indictment with his name on it for accessory after the fact to CFAA crimes.

@GoodsonLarry @Coalminetweety @barbramon1 @Colin02177 @tribelaw @sarahkendzior Correct. The Federal Vacancies Act should be amended to make clear that only currently serving and senate-confirmed officials may be appointed as "acting" officers and that if there is a statutory line of succession, that act takes precedence over an "acting" POTUS appointment.
@Colin02177 @Satin_Lavender @tribelaw @sarahkendzior Okay. But why should POTUS have the prosecutorial power in his portfolio at all? He still gets to appoint his cabinet and give them orders. That changes if positions like AG are made separately elected officials.		All of these ideas require constitutional amendments btw.
@Satin_Lavender @Colin02177 @tribelaw @sarahkendzior Constitutional scholars, including @tribelaw, have been pointing out structural weaknesses in the U.S. Constitution for a long, long time.

@Thochleutner @mattyglesias We'll never know who is right based on this poll!
@ScubaForDogs @mattyglesias That's not my point. I'm wondering what the polling on option 3 would look like if it was labeled "Medicare for All", as Yglesias suggests it could be messaged. I'm betting it'd be lower and closer to the polling on 4.
@JStephenClark @IlhanMN Which one was that?
@Thochleutner @mattyglesias That's my point. Whatever the plan is called opponents will call it Medicare for All and there will be a knee-jerk polling drop on the right.

@ZephyrTeachout It's not all that relevant to a presidential campaign is it? POTUS doesn't get to decide that issue, individual states do.		So, while I'm curious to hear the answer too, I'm doubtful that almost any answer given to that question would (or should) sway me on a POTUS candidate.

@frostnhstaterep We are almost at the really defining moment when Trump finally admits that his team worked with the Russians to win the election and that he knew about it, but that there was nothing wrong with their doing so because the result has been to Make America Great Again.

@nyhcmaven84 This is just Flake being on-brand with his words over actions approach.		Don't forget, he's the guy who gave rousing floor speeches condemning Trump's language but still voted to confirm a SCOTUS nominee who was combative with multiple senators during his confirmation hearing.
@nybxniv @RashidaTlaib I'm so sick of left-leaning pundits who scold liberals as soon as the discourse doesn't "rise above", "build consensus", or "be better" than conservatives.		Those things are only virtues when there's honest policy disagreement but shared values. That's not the case with Trump.

@nybxniv Note that I said it is malleable and "isn't predictive of electoral success." I'm not endorsing "likeability" to pick a 2020 candidate by any means. 		Likeability on a Cruz level wasn't HRC's problem and it isn't going to be any other major democratic candidate's problem anyway.
@newtgingrich I'm looking forward to when this tweet about Mattis goes the way of Gingrich's early tweets about Mueller. https://t.co/ilylWQGSL5
@nybxniv I dunno. Likeability is a real thing, it just isn't predictive of electoral success and is so malleable that it can be drummed into service arbitrarily (as the thread points out).		But there are *some* indisputably unlikable politicians out there. E.g. Ted Cruz.

@mumbly_joe @BootlegGirl True, but the bar didn't need to be that low for Jeb or Rubio. The early head to heads that got polled, which were all before the EMail/FBI investigation broke, showed HRC with smaller margins against every other major candidate in the GOP field except Cruz.
@jperetz @benyankee Which was a little creepy to watch, tbh.
@nycsouthpaw Not sure I agree. A lot of poll workers probably have no idea they are wrong. You'd need a specific intent requirements that would be really hard to prove not to sweep in those folks.
@BootlegGirl @mumbly_joe I don't think the the general election was ever going to be an easy DC for HRC. I think we forget how bad a candidate Trump was because he ended up POTUS.		A more normal GOP nominee would have given HRC a much closer run on the popular vote, maybe cleaned her clock.
@mumbly_joe @BootlegGirl @nymphomachy One of the problems with Bernie's campaign was that it was very vulnerable to stuff like that because it started off as a fringe campaign no one took seriously. Suddenly, people started responding and he needed to staff up with people but he was on the outs with party leadership.
@mumbly_joe @BootlegGirl Agreed, although mathematical impossibility matters less when there's a chance your opponent will have to drop out because of a criminal prosecution.		I have LOTS of issues with the Bernie voters that never got in line after the convention, though.
@BootlegGirl @mumbly_joe Right. My main problem is that I don't think it's fair to fault candidates for staying in a primary when there's still a chance they might end up the nominee.		The FBI investigation into HRC was ongoing. If HRC had been charged, Bernie was the likely backup unless he dropped.
@mumbly_joe @BootlegGirl It's also a matter of the science moving on. In 2000, the existence of and predicted impact of climate change was still debatable. It was less insane to think the situation was not too urgent to responsibly cast a protest vote. 		Not by 2016, though.
@BootlegGirl @mumbly_joe I very much disagree with the notion that but for Sanders HRC would be POTUS, but I don't think it's very helpful to rehash 2016 at this point.

Dear Republicans of Conscience,		If you are planning to vote for a GOP candidate for Congress today, please reconsider. A vote for any GOP congressional candidate is a vote for the worst excesses of the Trump administration. The GOP has proven itself unwilling to check Trump.
@JanellHendren @BenHowe There's also gerrymandering to contend with. Because of that, you can have a majority of voters in a state vote for one party's candidates, but still have the other party win most of the seats.
@JanellHendren @BenHowe That's not true. The average district is 710k or so, but some low population states with one district (Wyoming &amp; Vermont) have 100-150k fewer people represented.
@PeteOlson So, you are saying that Trump would sign a tax bill repealing your GOP tax bill?

@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz On to Canada that is.
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz You are familiar with the fact that the U.S. is between Canada and Mexico? I have no problem with them continuing on to Mexico if they choose.
@groutly @TexasStrong15 @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz No. Fleeing to this country to escape a murderous regime or starvation is enough to be allowed through the door, if I were writing the laws. That's why my ancestors came.
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz I have fact checked it. Cite some primary sources for your proposition, if you have them.		I'm still waiting for your list of comparably safe countries they should have stopped at, by the way.
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Actually, your premise is factually wrong. 		Asylum seekers overwhelmingly DO show up for court, according to DOJ's inspector general report on a monitoring program. Even a majority of undocumented immigrants overall show up.		https://t.co/lVLR44Udyg
@groutly @TexasStrong15 @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Ask your soldier daughter if she thinks it's okay to open fire on civilians because one among them throws a rock.
@groutly @TexasStrong15 @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz And what relevance does that have to whether once they are here they should be put in camps, exactly?
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz And we have a legal process for vetting people that requires that they be allowed to present themselves and stay in the country while their claim is adjudicated. You are supporting a POTUS who said he plans to have the military OPEN FIRE on them if one throws a rock.
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz No, you are a bad person for supporting a government that does not want to give these people the opportunity to avail themselves of the asylum process, which is designed to ferret out their motives, and throw them in camps. Don't lie to yourself.
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz If it were me, I'd get my kids as far away as possible as soon as I could. 		But, just for everyone's edification, can you list all the countries as safe as the United States between here and where the refugees started from?
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz Stop and listen to yourself sometime. You just said a plea to respect the human rights of women and children fleeing violent chaos is an--impliedly worthless--emotional argument. 		This is who you want to be as a person?
@TexasStrong15 @groutly @JohnCornyn Asylum seekers get to decide *for themselves* when they and their children are safe. If they are frauds, we have a legal process to figure that out.		Would you trust @realDonaldTrump or @tedcruz to decide *for you* when *your kids* are out of danger? I sure wouldn't.
@groutly @JohnCornyn So, your logic is "they could have made a decision along the way that I think would have been better, so it's okay to put them in camps"?		Just trying to be clear here.
@JohnCornyn It's also reasonable for voters to ask whether the kind of man that will put mothers and children who walked 1,000 miles to get here into concentration camps should continue to wield power unchecked by Congress.

C. He can refuse to comply, but also refuse to resign. This works until Trump fires him. Then we are either at B, if he goes, or we have a de facto military coup, if he refuses.		We have been heading here from the moment Trump took office.
At that point, Mattis has basically three options, all with terrible consequences for the Republic. 		A. He can comply, in which case the rule of law is broken in this country.		B. He can resign in protest, which lets Trump appoint someone who will comply. See A.
Illegal only matters if someone can and will prosecute. Trump can pardon any federal crimes, including  posse comitatus act violations, and only border-state prosecutors would have jurisdiction.

@q_aurelius This is also true in really red or really blue states/districts. Where I live, and where I grew up in the Bronx, is so overwhelmingly Democratic that the only competitive elections are the Democratic primaries. If you want your vote to matter at all, you vote in that primary.

@AshaRangappa_ I figured it was like that. So, the idea that there's no jurisdiction over undocumented immigrants might mean the U.S. has power for neither criminal nor formal immigration proceedings.		Because winning is having to let MS-13 members out of prison and being unable to deport them.
@AshaRangappa_ Raises an interesting question, though. Can the government institute deportation procedures against someone it lacks jurisdiction over?		Have we ever actually deported someone with diplomatic immunity or do we only just tell them to leave and they go?

@DaveAndrew10 @adamnewsum9 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter You too! Sometimes it's actually possible to have civil conversations on twitter! Who knew?
@DaveAndrew10 @adamnewsum9 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter It's a very bad thing for the protection of *any* of our civil rights to say that POTUS can reject a long-settled interpretation of the law whenever he wants to and the Courts can stop him later if they want to. As a practical matter, none of our rights are safe if that's okay.
@DaveAndrew10 @adamnewsum9 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter The problem with "let SCOTUS decide if it wants to change its mind" is that for SCOTUS have that chance there needs to be a court case that gets litigated all the way up to them. For that to happen, POTUS would have to start illegally applying a 100-year rejected interpretation.
@DaveAndrew10 @adamnewsum9 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter I disagree because the Supremacy Clause means the constitutional requirement (using common law terms) trumps any later immigration law.		If you think it should change as a policy matter, a constitutional amendment is how you have to do it.

@DaveAndrew10 @adamnewsum9 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter You are wrong. Domicile just means you live in a place and intend to do so. Your immigration status in irrelevant. This comes up when an undocumented person gets sued and you need to know which U.S. court has jurisdiction and which state's law applies.

@adamnewsum9 @DaveAndrew10 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter Residency and domiciliary status are different concepts under U.S. law than immigration status. You can be an undocumented immigrant and a New York resident, for example.

@1FlamingCranium @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter Exactly. Everyone born here is a citizen except children outside of U.S. legal jurisdiction because of diplomatic immunities (e.g., the children of ambassadors).
@DaveAndrew10 @Salt5792 @AnnCoulter That's a distinction that didn't exist at the time and there's no reason to think it makes a difference. The analysis is whether the parents are here on the business of a foreign power. That's obviously not the case for the children of illegal immigrants.

@MetroidThief @BootlegGirl Not that hard to see from the Clouds, though, as the ending of the play even has Socrates and associates getting chased out of town by slaves with torches.
@MetroidThief @BootlegGirl I think that's mostly fair, though I would lean toward Plato being more charitable about Socrates' personality than may have been accurate because (a) the character is usually the voice of Plato's ideas and (b) Plato presumably liked Socrates as a person.
@MetroidThief @BootlegGirl I'm not sure there's any way to pick between them. Both knew Socrates in different capacities and different times. Ask someone's devoted student to describe who they are and what they think you'll get one answer. Ask their snarky longtime neighbor, you'll hear something else.
@MetroidThief @BootlegGirl Socrates is also in Aristophanes' "The Clouds" and basically portrayed as a sophist's sophist. Clouds may be as close as Plato's to the real person, as Aristophanes wrote Clouds during Socrates' lifetime.		Plato's version is the sympathetic biopic. Aristophanes' version is SNL.

@LibbyBlog @VP I can't see it being because he was critical of Trump, without a lot more. If Trump was ordering hits on journalists critical of him the streets would be lined with bodies.		He seems a good target to me, if I'm a murderous Saudi prince, because he shows the U.S. won't act.
@LibbyBlog @VP The credible reporting seems to be that we intercepted plans to lure him back to Saudi to detain him. Not much of a distinction, I admit. Also much more believable to me that we would fail to warn Khashoggi than that we would order the hit.		https://t.co/LMdpuqdX4V
@LibbyBlog @VP Perhaps, but I'm not sure that would make all that much difference for "Kushner caused the hit" argument. Saudi probably wanted to kill Khashoggi either way.
@LibbyBlog @VP Great!		I don't see the call as incriminating considering Kushner has both private business and public business reasons to be in touch with Saudi officials frequently.		For me, Khashoggi was unlikely to be on Kushner's alleged enemies list because Saudi knew about him long ago.
Oh, and on the deficit, let's be big picture for a second.		WE ARE BORROWING MONEY FROM CHINA SO KUSHNER AND TRUMP DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON MILLIONS IN INCOME.
Imagine being the kind of person that makes millions a year, pays no taxes, and pushes to cut taxes even more in a way that balloons the deficit and will be used to justify cuts to social security and Medicaid. Imagine that level of callousness. https://t.co/QWU79XQHnQ

There are a lot of constitutional amendments I could get behind (like making AG as separate constitutional officer). That's not why the right wants a convention.
@arthurchandra7 @KHShan @Amy_Siskind @sarahkendzior @Kasparov63 He's also exposed a lot of the weaknesses in the U.S. Constitution. People like me, who have studied this stuff at a theoretical level, knew the weaknesses were potentially there before now, but it took the real threat of Trump exploiting them for the public/media to see it.
@arthurchandra7 @KHShan Yes. It is. And the U.S. under Trump is moving in the same direction in very, very worrying ways.		Follow people like @Amy_Siskind @sarahkendzior and @Kasparov63 if you want to have trouble sleeping at night.
@arthurchandra7 @KHShan As I understand it, and I'm not anything like an expert, the short answer is that Erdoğan became president in 2014, consolidated power in that office and used the office to crack down on political opposition.
@KHShan @arthurchandra7 Right. If going into Iraq was about the Kurds, we wouldn't be okay with how they are treated in Turkey.
@KHShan You should be proud of yourself for being willing to do so, though. It seems like a lot of the GOP hasn't been willing to do that.

RT @juliarubin: this aarp mag definition of bitcoin is amazing?? https://t.co/5xr1I7of35
@DCELL68 Maybe, but I can also see the Chief Justice's perspective on wanting to wait until after the vote so that it doesn't look like SCOTUS was trying to interfere in the SCOTUS nomination process. There's an institutional credibility concern there that I can understand putting first.
@DCELL68 And besides, it wouldn't have made a difference anyway. Kavanaugh could have shot a man in the middle of the hearing, just to watch him die,  and not a single GOP vote would have changed.
@DCELL68 Judicial misconduct investigations are never made public while ongoing and pretty rarely are made public after they are over.		It's important not to read too much into something like this. Every judge has complaints made and gets personally sued from time to time by sore losers.
@DCELL68 I'm familiar with the staff that would most likely have been involved. There's zero chance they'd leak info about a judicial conduct referral (or anything else for that matter).		There's a reason you never see leaks reported on how SCOTUS is gong to come out. They don't happen.
@DCELL68 Pretty sketchy since it gets what appellate court Kavanaugh was on before being elevated to SCOTUS wrong. Says 2nd Circuit, but he was on the DC Circuit. A mistake that basic doesn't speak well to the other info in the article.		Also, Roberts' people would never leak this.

@vanityman @JRubinBlogger There is very little the Chief Justice can do and the HR folks at SCOTUS don't have oversight of the Justices.

@GovHowardDean Yep. If Kavanaugh was appropriate for SCOTUS he'd pull the nomination himself at this point. Maybe give an angry speech while doing it, but he'd do it.		By staying he shows that he cares more for his personal ambition than the good of the Republic.		https://t.co/JgNq5AsbKA
So, like an embarrassed teen, rather than recognize the mistake, pull Kavanaugh and replace him with some equally conservative jurist, Senate Republicans rage that it's "not fair" and storm out of the room.		And @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski must be their parents.
The defenses of confirming him left are exactly what you expect from a teenager whose parents tell them not to do something stupid.		"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"		"But I told my fiends I'd do it!"		"You always say that!"		And blatant dishonesty about the facts, of course.
Kavaugh is also so tainted by the accusations and his partisan comments that it's plain that putting him on SCOTUS now will injure the institution.		That should come before any individual justice's appointment. A nominee appropriate for SCOTUS would see that HIMSELF and withdraw.
No one intellectually honest can believe Kavanaugh was truthful and candid during Thursday's hearing. 		He lied. 		He evaded. 		It's fucking obvious if you just watch the hearing.		And anyone responsible knows that's disqualifying behavior in a judge. 		https://t.co/fAfAgoGUvX
The push to confirm Kavanaugh isn't about Kavanaugh himself at this point.		It's now that family fight where one side is clearly wrong, but they are going to go ahead and do it anyway. It's about control. Republicans CAN confirm him, so they MUST or they aren't really in control.

@GiancarloSopo @TheDemocrats If more witnesses come forward on it this week, will you issue a public apology and retract your thread?
@Badfish27934716 @GiancarloSopo @TheDemocrats Sure, and we may see something like that this week if the FBI doesn't interview her and who she identifies. We also may not.		Either way, considering a SCOTUS seat is a stake (and the integrity of SCOTUS with it) you have 2 agents spend an afternoon chasing it down to be sure.
The New York Court of Appeals has mixed certiorari jurisdiction like this. The lower courts can put things on the NYCA's docket and there is an appeal as of right in cases with two-judge dissents below.
I think this is a better argument for adding another layer of intermediate appellate courts with partly discretionary power over what to hear.		Once you get much bigger than 9 on a panel, you run a real risk of not knowing what the law coming from a case is. #appellatetwitter https://t.co/YvrmgUwlOU
@Badfish27934716 @GiancarloSopo @TheDemocrats Me too. Lying under oath is unacceptable for anyone, be they accuser or accused. But you have to *actually investigate* to find out.
@GiancarloSopo @TheDemocrats You are aware that lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed shortly after it was filed?
@GiancarloSopo So, based on no evidence other than your own sense of implausibility, you want @TheDemocrats to dismiss a sworn affidavit made under penalty of felony without any investigation into the corroboration the affiant swears exists.		Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
@Kendo_Lees @sheisartmoney If you don't think imprisoning kids in a tent city is okay, then what's your point? Improper treatment of the homeless and gang violence doesn't justify treating innocent kids this way.		Either you think treating children like this is wrong or not. The rest is just whataboutism.

@DeathCar72 I think it's because fundamentally honest people have a hard time wrapping their minds around the thought-process of fundamentally dishonest people. It's why the Democrats (and maybe some Republicans) kept getting snookered by McConnell for years.
@GiancarloSopo @NickRiccardi @TheDemocrats That thread you wrote shows no interest in following the evidence. You seemed to want the Democrats to ignore Ford's allegation once it leaked and to ignore the other allegations that followed.		Am I wrong about that?
@NickRiccardi It's becoming clear that my own frustration with @TheDemocrats over the years may have been in part because they had guys like this on the platform committee.		https://t.co/jMcemojiyN
@GiancarloSopo As a lifelong Democrat, let me be the first to say it: Good Riddance.		If you think, knowing what we have learned in the past week, that Kavanaugh is an appropriate choice for SCOTUS and that supporting Dr. Ford once her info had been leaked is evil, I'm happy to see you go.

@Quincyooo @megynkelly Yes. It's theater at this point.		But I'm using "resolve" in a lawyerly sense here. They could "resolve" it to the same degree a jury would, by hearing the relevant witnesses and deciding who they believe.		The Senate will not investigate a lick after Kavanaugh is confirmed.
@Quincyooo @megynkelly No, but it's purportedly an exercise in fact-finding and his credibility is vital and to be weighed against Ford's. If a sworn statement was good enough to resolve a dispute like that we wouldn't need a hearing all.

@sflcat @steve_vladeck I'm a privileged person responding to another privileged person about when it's appropriate for us privileged people to lecture others about the "right way" to engage in political discourse. If you think that's the same thing as censorship, I can't help you.
@CBHessick @steve_vladeck I'll add that background matters. Those of us without skin in the game are in no moral position to lecture those at risk about terms of debate. Not even when our argument "is sound." 		And Steve's argument does seek to silence those who believe others are arguing in bad faith.
@sflcat @steve_vladeck No, you are taking it to the opposite conclusion, and you are smart enough to know you are being disingenuous.		Nothing in the idea "the privileged shouldn't police the tone of debate of the less privileged" condones violence and you are fully aware of that.
@sflcat @steve_vladeck For someone defending a post about engaging respectfully on the merits, you sure are gong out of your way to make a bad faith argument that willfully misstates my point there.
@CBHessick @steve_vladeck It implies a kind of methods policing I find inappropriate from those with nothing to lose. 		Someone whose civil rights are at stake, for example, doesn't have an obligation to defend their rights "on the merits" in a debate. They may defend them with any legal tactic they want.
@sflcat @steve_vladeck Because those who are incredibly privileged have no skin in the game on the argument and don't have any right to lecture on what its terms should be.
Those who personally stand to lose very little should refrain from lecturing those who may lose much about the tone of argument.		I have a lot of respect for @steve_vladeck, but a white cis-gendered male law prof who went to Amherst &amp; Yale should probably stay mum on this one. https://t.co/1PxspsvLWG

@HomeboyMcJewz @DavidAFrench I don't think the issue was about all white men. Just the old GOP white men on the committee who can't be expected to question her in a considerate and respectful manner.
@HomeboyMcJewz @DavidAFrench I'm not seeing where any of those say "How dare they question her!"		They say it's probably bad optics for for the old GOP men on the committee. Those aren't the same thing. It's not hypocrisy to say "it's your job to do x, even though it might make you look bad to do it."
@HomeboyMcJewz @DavidAFrench So, you can't identify anyone then? Got it. Enjoy being cynically directed to rage against windmills.		May harmony find you.
@HomeboyMcJewz @DavidAFrench Can you identify ANYONE that matters who has said that Ford should not be questioned by the committee? I am aware of no one, hence the question.		I'm not going to rehash the rest of it, which is wrong but not really relevant.
@HomeboyMcJewz @DavidAFrench Seriously. Dr. Ford has not objected to being questioned by the committee members. She asked for a pre-hearing investigation, time to arrange for security, and not to be questioned at the same time as Kavanaugh.
@DavidAFrench Who actually said the first thing?
Throughout #metoo I've been thinking about this. 		A LOT of male protagonist behavior toward female love interests in media is toxic in this way.

I emphasize this because an "ambiguous consent" defense requires conceding that Kavanaugh is a liar. If he was there at all, he has been lying so far.		And we should not be putting known liars on SCOTUS. You either need to totally discredit Dr. Ford, or consider Kavanaugh unfit. https://t.co/PU1kuVCmog

@XLProfessor Plus, you know, we will have an accused attempted rapist and perjurer on SCOTUS for 2+ years.
@XLProfessor The problem is that the 7 you still need would be much harder to pick off because:		1. The ones left will be from the safest GOP seats.		2. The ones left will likely be part of the group ploughing ahead to confirm Kavanaugh. Voting to convict is an admission they're wrong now.
@Lollardfish GOP also leaves them off because of the margin. Right now, several GOP senators have to defect, typically the women, to kill a nomination. Put even one on Judiciary, that one could kill a nomination on her own.
@XLProfessor But he won't be. If he gets on the Supreme Court, he's not going anywhere. As with Trump, Democrats will lack the 2/3 Senate majority needed to remove him after a House impeachment vote.

@KillerMartinis Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to pin male predatory behavior on women. That's bullshit and I'm doing my best to raise my son not to be a like that. It's possible, as my parents successfully raised me that way.
@KillerMartinis The white women who support abusive men are a critical part of the larger problem, too.		We all know most young men are led around by their pants. What do we think they learn from seeing men like Trump (and Bill Clinton if we are being honest) sexually prosper among white women?
@KillerMartinis This is true not only for men but also for a lot of women. We should never forget that Trump won white women, despite all of them knowing what he is.
@arthur_affect True, although that is in some sense the reality. But for this the votes were there to confirm him. 		Also, this *should* be a determining factor in the nomination. If the accuser comes across as at all credible, anyone who cares about the integrity of SCOTUS should vote "no".

This is also not to say that the other AG candidates wouldn't be able to be independent in those moments. They probably can be. This was a very close call.		But, all things considered, I'm just a little more confident in @ZephyrTeachout being willing to piss off a governor.
To be clear, this is not about Cuomo. It's really a structural thing necessary for any AG w/ any Governor. 		In fact, when Cuomo was AG he took a position opposite Paterson on the very important issue of how vacancies in the office of Lt. Governor are filled (Skelos v. Paterson).
And there are also times when the only credible legal positions are politically unpalatable to a Governor.		The AG needs to be able to protect the integrity of the AG's office in those instances by saying "No, Governor, we can't argue that for you."
Don't misinderstand; the NY AG and Governor should be on the same side 99.9% percent of the time. 		But there are times when a Governor makes a decision that may run afoul of the N.Y. Constitution. In those rare instances, the AG needs to be willing oppose the decision in court.

@umnonotreally @Melissachirp @renato_mariotti I'm picking nits here, but the theory doesn't give POTUS real immunity, only a stay of enforcement. Once out of office, a criminal POTUS can still be prosecuted.
@renato_mariotti The only reading of the impeachment clause that's consistent with the notion that POTUS cannot be charged while in office is one that requires Congress to bring impeachment proceedings prior to any felony or misdemeanor charges being filed.

@alegalnerd @renato_mariotti @DavidLat @nsarwark @thehyphed @NYCrimDefense Officially, none. There are no adjustments in the guidelines for "this was a selective prosecution." That's also not, to my reading, a statutory sentencing consideration under 18 U.S.C. 3553(b).		But Ellis can take it into account unofficially several ways, if he really wants to.
RT @JWGOP: Reminder, Manafort hand picked @VP
Here's a video primer on how the multiple count rules work.		https://t.co/q2evWIRUVW
The relevant guidelines are 3D1.2 and 3D1.4. And, because seven of the deadlocked counts were for bank fraud, involving different loans and banks, conviction of those should increase Manafort's base offense level under either rule, and therefore increase his guidelines range.
Normally, @renato_mariotti is spot on with regard to federal criminal law issues, but he's flat wrong on this one. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines that apply to a defendant *are* effected by multiple counts. The base offense level goes up. https://t.co/M9P3HcQs19

@KHShan It's kinda astounding when you realize that the president of the past 50 years who has most lived Christian virtues is a Democrat: Jimmy Carter.
@KHShan I can. Over time I have come to believe that the sexual morality attacks on democratic politicians were never sincere. The GOP didn't care how candidates treated women, but they knew swing voters and liberals did. So they played it up to harm democratic turnout.
@KHShan There's been deep hypocrisy in the GOP on sexual virtue for years. Just look at the personal history of a guy like Gingrich or, horrifyingly, Hastert.
@KHShan Honestly, I doubt it would have kept him from getting the nomination had it come out. No one voted for him on the basis of his personal virtues regarding women.

You should vote for @SenatorMenendez anyway because, as you said, the stakes are too high.		I just wish the @DNC would stop backing ethically challenged candidates.
@quinnnorton I think it's a very idealistic position to take to say that just because there's greater interaction between social elites and the rest of us that there is greater influence by us on the policies created by those groups.
@quinnnorton So, your position is that there is greater governmental consultation now because there is a system-wide feedback loop as a result of changes in culture, rather than because of greater direct governmental consultation with those outside elite circles?
@quinnnorton I think you are conflating access to information, which we surely have lots more of, with governmental consultation of the mass public.		E.g. on foreign policy, many more people know something about it than in, say, 15th century England but why do think their views change policy?
@quinnnorton Where are you seeing this new and  meaningful consultation?		Wealth is heavily concentrated, largely in the same circle that has easy access to the educational pedigree. We get to choose our elected leaders, but mostly from among that same group with backing from the wealthy.
@quinnnorton I'm not sure that I agree with you that governance by consultation is accepted/normalized even by liberal democratic governments more than it ever was. Most folks I know in government aren't working off polling data and educational pedigree is still prerequisite in lots of areas.
@quinnnorton One retort, which has historical permutations, is that you are wrong that the structure of society is fully mutable. 		E.g., there's a non-silly argument that humans inherently create social hierarchies. We have to work *with* that limitation when imagining changes.

@bd_howell @tribelaw I'm not totally sure he's right that there needs to be a declared war at the time of the treasonous act. His argument hinges on the Rosenbergs being prosecuted for espionage rather than treason. But that prosecutorial choice isn't precedent and espionage is easier to prosecute.

@jarrodfrates @OrinKerr Yes. But that's why I think Trump waits to offer him up until he might need to get his nominee through a democratic Senate.

@ThatWitchUKnow Sorry, bad joke about self-medication.		And no, the racism exists before the drug/booze. The drug/booze just lowers inhibitions enough to make the racist say things out loud that they might otherwise self-censor.
@ThatWitchUKnow Alcohol isn't an over the counter medication?
@ThatWitchUKnow Honestly, a "Do not operate social media while taking this" warning on the box would probably be a good idea for lots of over the counter medications.

@reader_geek I couldn't help myself...
@reader_geek But space! While 60 attackers were present, only 16 could have stabbed him in any one round on their respective turns. That's only 22.5 avg. damage. If JC tried to flee, he'd provoke 14 or so AAOs, for 19 more.		So it probably took 2-4 rounds to get him to -10, or 12-24 seconds.

@CarberryMatthew @BenHowe We can agree to disagree on where the burden lies. For my lights, it lies with those who think trying something that might not work, but also might help, is worse than the status quo. 		May harmony find you.
@CarberryMatthew @BenHowe Correlations are all we ever get to judge the potential effectiveness of future policy. No policy can be proven to have rendered a given result in a vacuum, because the world doesn't operate in a vacuum.		Why isn't a correlated policy worth trying to you to see if it helps here?
@CarberryMatthew @BenHowe Is there some reason their being a significant contributor (under your study) to one or two mass shootings isn't a good enough reason to ban? No important public policy objective needs them to be legal. Why not lessen the impact of even a small number of future shootings?
@CarberryMatthew @BenHowe AR-15 style semi-autos have been used in a majority of the deadliest mass shootings. I'm willing to restrict access to those type weapons based on the correlation and the bet that doing so will turn at least one 10+ person mass-shooting into a 3+ person shooting.
@CarberryMatthew @BenHowe How about Australia? Introduced sales restrictions and a registry, gun violence dropped, no regular mass- shootings like we have here. 	 https://t.co/Ncq0lkeLRp
@BenHowe Or it fits in a tweet.		Many sensible reforms have been proposed including getting a functioning national registry to prevent illegal sales, restricting access to certian weapons like the AR-15, and banning high capacity magazines.		But you know that, Ben.

@wvEsquiress I'll worry about that if it happens. Otherwise, I'm all for the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas overlapping much more in American public life. Boycotts are one of the most powerful tools of progressive movements and a fair counter to corporate money in politics.
@wvEsquiress If the liberal (in every sense of the word) use of the tactic encourages pundits to think about the consequences before they use their microphones to punch down or spread hate, I'm all for it.
@wvEsquiress Must disagree. The ease with which this is happening is quite heartening to me. People like Ingram are awful and have never gotten any serious public condemnation for their awfulness. It's long past time.
