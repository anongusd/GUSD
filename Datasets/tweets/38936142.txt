Trump has not yet signed the spending bill to keep the government open.
Steve Bannon says Trump should not support the current spending bill and ask for a two-week extension to negotiate a different bill. He says Trump's "real supporters" don't support the bill and notes that Trump hasn't signed it.
"Enjoy your life!" Trump says to his new attorney general as he leaves the Rose Garden.
Trump says Obama told him that he was "so close" to going to war with North Korea. Is that true? @EricSchultz @AlyssaMastro44
Trump is now praising Rush Limbaugh for doing a three-hour radio show without taking phone calls.
"Going sixty miles an hour, he made a right turn into the park on the West Side Highway in New York."
After telling the crowd how he is likely to be sued and lose over the national emergency, Trump tells his new attorney general to stand up. "He's got the easiest job in politics," Trump says, joking.
"I didn't need to do this," Trump says of the national emergency. So is it an emergency?
"JUST TO FINISH!"
"We'll lose in court," Trump says of his national emergency order, before going on a list of courts likely to deny him.
"We will be sued, they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit," Trump says, predicting he is likely to lose at every level before the Supreme Court.
Trump implicitly attacks Paul Ryan -- who he frequently blames for not getting enough wall money -- in the first two years. "Some people didn't step up," Trump says. For his part? "New to the job," he says. (Trump's own team negotiated the deal that he didn't like.)
"So that's the story," Trump says, after a meandering 25 minutes about Chinese trade, drugs, death penalty, the economy, the news media, Syria &amp; more.
In news conference to declare a national emergency, Trump somehow is ... now offering praise for China for having the death penalty for drug dealers.
There is no TelePrompter in the Rose Garden today.
"We're talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, human traffickers, all types of criminals and gangs," Trump says. He now asks an Angel Mom to stand up and show a picture of her murdered daughter.
"I'm going to be signing a national emergency," Trump says in the Rose Garden.
He is now talking about women who are duct taped and smuggled in. "Nancy knows it," he says. (No one has produced evidence for this, and experts say they haven't heard of it.)
"Tremendous crowd, tremendous crowd," Trump says in the Rose Garden of his El Paso rally.
Trump still hasn't talked about the border wall/national emergency. "No more rockets going up! No more missiles going up! No more testing of nuclear!" he says of North Korea.
"It's going extremely well," Trump says of China negotiations. "Who knows what that means?"

One thing that doesn't get enough attention: Trump paralyzes many GOP lawmakers, per aides, because he'll never firmly say if he supports a bill or not. Lawmakers, leadership, leadership aides repeatedly (and often without luck) ask Trump/White House to firmly state a position.

There's quite a long ways between "Mexico will pay for the wall" to "I will declare a national emergency to fund the wall because the United States Congress won't give me the money I want.
Statement from Sarah Sanders: “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action - including a national emergency - to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border."
There is not a lot of support for a national declaration for the border wall among Senate Republicans. But McConnell says on the Senate floor he'll support it. He has previously cautioned Trump against it.
There is still plenty of time for another plot twist or two, folks.

Trump says he wants people to come into the country legally in "the largest numbers ever." But Stephen Miller has aggressively sought to cut legal immigration. (That ad-lib was not in the text.)
Hello Stephen Miller. "Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.	Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools..."
Pelosi appears to be reading behind Trump. Is that a copy of the speech?
Trump is 99.5% on the prompter tonight.
"An economic miracle is taking place in the United States -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation," Trump said. Schiff grinned.
The Nancy Pelosi facial expressions are damn good TV.
Joe Manchin appears to be the only, if not one of the only, Democrats standing when Trump boasts about the booming natural gas production in the US.
Trump will say tonight that he's going to Vietnam later this month for a new summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, per senior administration official.

"I like the symbol of being here," Trump says, when Jeanine Pirro encourages him several times to take a vacation. Saying the quiet part out loud.
Trump says of Joe Biden: Obama "came along and took him off the trash heap."
Trump dodges question from Jeanine Pirro if he will seek to block Mueller report from becoming public.
Trump is now shouting into the phone at Jeanine Pirro that a family member of Michael Cohen should be investigated.
"Anyone could have listened to that meeting. That meeting is open for grabs," Trump says responding to reporting from @gregpmiller about the extraordinary lengths the president took to keep meetings with Putin private. So why don't so many in his admin and gov't know about it?
"Bezos, who has bigger problems as anyone right now," Trump says, adding Bezos uses the Washington Post as a lobbyist (no he doesn't) and that the Post is "probably as bad" as the New York Times.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump says, when Jeanine Pirro asks if he is/was working for Russia. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written."
"I haven't actually left the White House in months," Trump says. What?
Judge Jeanine begins show by calling for a national emergency and asking Trump to declare a national emergency. He doesn't. "I have the absolute right," he says, but he doesn't declare one.

Trump, after complaining for days that he was lonely in the White House over Christmas, says in the Rose Garden that it "wasn't a lonely place."
"They drive right in and they make a left," Trump says of terrorists coming across the southern border.
"I did say that. Absolutely," Trump says, when Major Garrett asks if he threatened a shutdown of "months or even years," as Schumer recounted.
He did not name them. https://t.co/HXY6OA4zwr
"All of the border things that we will be building..."
"I don't think there was one Wall Street genius, of which I know many, and they're not geniuses..."
Trump says "the other side" feels better about a wall if it is built with steel. What??
@JoshuaGreen @jackshafer none of this is surprising.
Schumer says Trump threatened to keep the government closed for "months or even years."

Trump often referred to Jim Mattis as a "Democrat" and a "Moderate Dog" and said that he wanted him to stay in all these long and unpopular wars. By the end, Trump was considering his removal -- though aides said it was unlikely -- and barely saw Mattis. https://t.co/t4hqFtRYPz

People close to Christie resent that Trump had toyed with him -- removal from transition team, not picking him as AG. This time, POTUS was quite interested in Christie as chief of staff, per several White House advisers, and saw him as a front-runner. And Christie said no.
In a headline I didn't expect to see today... Reince Priebus is joining the Navy, @DanLamothe writes. https://t.co/4JCysECjqr
White House aides/advisers told us this morning that Christie was a leading contender for chief of staff. @PhilipRucker &amp; I had just finished astory. And now Christie puts out statement saying he's declining. So that's how this week has gone.

Schumer has smiled for most of the meeting. He may understand Trump better than anyone else on the Hill.
"We're in no rush. We have a wonderful chief of staff right now," Trump says about the man he has criticized privately for months.
Mike Pence has not said a word.
"When the president brags he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble," Schumer says. Trump interjects. "I did!" This has now become a squabbling match over the election results.
"Unfortunately, this is spiraled downward," Pelosi says in the Oval Office meeting with Trump, which might be the understatement of the year.
"The last time you shut it down you got killed," Trump tells Schumer in the Oval Office.

Mueller on Tuesday recommended that former national security adviser Michael Flynn serve no jail time, citing his “substantial assistance” with several ongoing investigations. 19 interviews with DOJ. By @CarolLeonnig @PostRoz @DevlinBarrett 	https://t.co/ubSyiGhtMH
"The defendant also provided useful information concerning 26 LINES OF BLACKED OUT TEXT!"
Michael Flynn has given "substantial" help to prosecutors, per sentencing memo. The memo calls for the low end of the sentencing guidelines, which equals zero prison time.
Sentencing memo says Michael Flynn participated in 19 interviews with either special counsel prosecutors or other DOJ officials.
"The waiting brings out the stupid," @DevlinBarrett says, as we, well, wait.

Trump just praised Coast Guard members while visiting a local station for their responses to hurricanes. “If you were doing a brand, they would say this is one of the great brand increases... Nobody has gone up more than the Coast Guard.”
Trump also said he was conducting job interviews this week at Mar-a-Lago. Would not say for which positions in his administration.
Trump told me he didn’t have a position on Julian Assange and whether he should face charges and didn’t know much about the situation.
President Trump just told us he was thinking of closing the entire border with Mexico, and said, without offering evidence, that he had closed down at least parts of the border two days ago.
Asked President Trump about Khashoggi killing minutes ago. He said that Crown prince regretted the death even more than he did, that the “world” was to blame, that the CIA had not concluded that MBS was responsible and that low oil prices were a key reason not to punish Saudi.

Watching Democrats/liberal groups that both hate Sessions and Trump issue statements on the AG's firing is really something to behold.
Notice what Trump did with Sessions. Initially there was lots of resistance to his firing. But Trump attacked, harassed, taunted him so much that it became seen as inevitable -- and even just necessary -- to close this chapter. https://t.co/ZcZKIwQwYz

"No I don't," Trump says when asked if he regrets the ad that was deemed too racist to go on many networks.
"You've been reading the same documents I have. You know exactly what I'm doing," Trump says, when asked if he still plans to send 15,000 troops to the border.
"I don't know who Lil John is," Trump says, asked if he called the rapper "Uncle Tom."
"In Jeff Flake's case, it's me, I retired him. I did the country a great service," Trump says. "Jeff Flake, that's another beauty."
"That's such a racist question," Trump says, when asked if his embrace of "nationalism" is an embrace of "white nationalism."

"I only had me, I didn't have anyone else," Trump says of Georgia, pitting himself against Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. Vice President Mike Pence spent a day in Georgia campaigning.

This press conference has devolved into a confusing shouting match.
"I'll give you voter suppression. Take a look at the CNN polls. That is voter suppression," Trump says.
"I could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't," President Trump says of the Mueller probe.
"I think you should let me run the country and let you run CNN," Trump says of Jim Acosta. "CNN should be ashamed for himself having you work for them. You are a rude terrible person."
"Do you think they were actors? They didn't come from Hollywood," Trump says of the caravan and the ad his campaign released.
"They're under audit. They have been for a long time," Trump says of his taxes. "... I'm under a very continuous audit." There has been no proof offered of this.
"I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time," Trump says, when asked if he plans to fire Jeff Sessions.
"I would like to see bipartisanship. I would like to see unity," Trump says, after calling the Democrats the "party of crime" for weeks and telling voters that Democrats want gangs/illegal criminals to take over their communities.
"Air and water, has to be perfect," Trump says, in a discursive soliloquy on the environment.
"I could see it being extremely good for me politically because I think I'm better at that game than they are," Trump says, of Democrats investigating him.
Trump, in the East Room, is now threatening Democrats with investigations if they investigate him.

Trump, in the East Room, is trashing Republicans who lost and saying they did not support him and that is why they lost.
"Too bad Mike," Trump says, making fun of Rep. Mike Coffman for losing. Also seems to take glee that Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Rep. Barbara Comstock for not embracing Trump. "Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that Mia."
"To the best of my knowledge, we didn't have a vacant or empty seat," Trump says of his rallies at his East Room press conference. (There were some empty seats.) "I'm sure you would have reported it if you spotted one."

"I do eventually want to unite, but the fact is, we're driving them crazy," Trump says. "They're going loco."
"Smart, tough, he sleeps like four hours a night or less," Trump says of Mike Braun, after calling Joe Donnelly "Sleepin Joe." He adds: "Joe wakes up primarily when Schumer calls."
"You don't need to be a pollster to know how to count," Kellyanne Conway tells crowd in Indiana. "This place is filled to the rafters." Conway and Sarah Sanders are now on stage holding court.
Trump says, without offering evidence, that Democrats are inviting caravans in "to overwhelm your schools, your hospitals and your communities."
"The legendary Maxine Waters, a real genius," Trump says, bringing it back to a Democratic congresswoman he often pillories.
With Trump, it always comes back to crowd size.
"In other words, she leaked," President Trump says of Feinstein, acting out the Cornyn/Feinstein exchange on Brett Kavanaugh and the letter as a one-act play. Cornyn said at the time he believed Feinstein when she told him she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter.
Trump is now telling the crowd that the media was upset about Election Night 2016 even though "they got great ratings."

Trump today: "They want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, predators and bloodthirsty MS-13 killers," Trump says, offering no proof, of Democrats. He then says they want illegal immigrants to come here so they can vote.
"Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions," Trump says. He does not mention that his administration has taken a court position that is the opposite of this.
"You're not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore when you talk about women, it's politically incorrect," Trump says, launching an introduction of Ivanka Trump, who gets a loud roar from the crowd and comes on stage.
"He is a bulldog. He doesn't give a damn, Boom, boom, boom, point after point," Trump says, launching an introduction of Rep. Jim Jordan by describing how Jordan defends Trump on TV.
"The midterm elections used to be like boring," Trump said. "...Who ever heard of midterm?"	"Now it's like the hottest thing," he said of midterm elections. "These people are making a fortune," he says of the media.
Trump just said the news media would have liked to delay Friday's strong jobs report until after the election. The report is released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is released the first Friday in every month. And it is covered extensively.
"He's hurt a lot of people. What he's done to people is a disgrace," Trump said of former CFPB head Richard Cordray. "A bad person who would do a terrible job!"
"Administrations make changes usually after midterms and probably we'll be right in that category. I think it's very customary," Trump said. Here's our story from this morning about the shake-up likely ahead: https://t.co/6eIXQ8NqEK
"Probably not," Trump said, when asked if he planned to meet Vladimir Putin in Paris this weekend.

Trump shot @JonLemire a dagger when he asked if Trump would replace Mattis. “Uh, why would I do that?” Trump said, before saying no. (He has been grumbling about Mattis for months.)
Trump told me he didn’t know TV networks had pulled his immigration ad that many critics viewed as racist. Said his ads “were effective.” I asked why he liked the ad when many felt it was offensive. “A lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive,” he said.
The reports were spurred because the president’s campaign sent out a press release promising a guest appearance. https://t.co/Q7P7VSyaSm
