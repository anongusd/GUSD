What do we want the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship to look like in five to 20 years? Modern. Competitive. Integrated. Educated.
As my record shows, I presided over the consideration of Justice Kennedy,	Reagan nominee, who was confirmed in a presidential election year.
In 1992, I urged the Senate and White House to work together to ensure the Court functioned as our founders intended. Remains my position.
Thanks for taking the time, Rachel. It's always a pleasure to see you. https://t.co/ld8PXnLbWR
