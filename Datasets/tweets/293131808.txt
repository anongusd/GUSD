Despite the Trump Administration’s inaction, I’m glad Congress has taken bipartisan steps to address the opioid epidemic, including two major pieces of legislation and an increase of $2.6 billion in new resources to combat opioid misuse disorder. There is much more to do.
Earlier this month the administration released its first ever National Drug Control Strategy. It contains nothing new. It identifies no funding needs. It's 20 pages long, and easily summarized in two words—not enough.
The costs of the opioid crisis are also seen in health providers treating babies born addicted to opioids, kids placed in foster care, parents who have lost children to an overdose, and veterans in chronic pain who are struggling with addiction.
The opioid crisis costs our country an estimated $500 billion a year—and that doesn’t begin to capture the emotional devastation on families and communities.

Declaring a state of emergency when there isn't one isn't how our government is supposed to work &amp; isn't remotely what was intended when emergency authorities were created. 		I stand with Democrats, Republicans, and every American who is concerned by this. We will fight back.
ICYMI: @senatemajldr McConnell announced a vote for next week on an anti-women's health bill that leading medical organizations have vocally opposed. Democrats stand with women, doctors, nurses, &amp; everyone who cares about women’s health to make sure this bill doesn't become law.
My message about this #TitleX gag rule is that extreme Republicans absolutely do not know better than women about women’s health care, and we are going to make sure we are heard.
Under the #TitleX gag rule, doctors and providers who millions of women trust—disproportionately women of color and women who rely on clinics for affordable care—will be blocked from offering them the full range of repro health options b/c politicians think they know better.
This #TitleX gag rule is meant to do one thing and one thing only: further undermine a woman’s constitutionally protected right to safe, legal abortion in the United States of America.
This politically-driven bill is unnecessary and should never become law. 		Democrats are going to stand with women, doctors, nurses, and everyone who truly cares about women’s health and rights to make absolutely sure it doesn’t become law. I hope you’re ready to fight with me. https://t.co/YjQxL8EVzv
The anti-women's health bill that @senatemajldr McConnell announced is coming up for a vote would put @VP Pence &amp; Republicans right where they don’t belong—in between a woman &amp; her health care provider as she's making personal health decisions. It's unnecessary &amp; harmful.

So if President Trump is really serious about either of these efforts—he could start by taking a close look at his actions, because especially for people wondering what the future holds for their health coverage, his actions speak a lot louder than what he says in a speech.
But if the Texas lawsuit his administration stands behind goes into effect, children w/ cancer would lose protection for their pre-existing conditions. People who've gained coverage under Medicaid—which is a critical source of coverage for those w/ HIV—would lose their insurance.
The most urgent step we can take right now to help children battling cancer, and help those struggling with HIV, is to make absolutely sure their health care coverage isn’t taken away.
Last night, President Trump said he wanted to help fight childhood cancer and end the HIV epidemic. I absolutely share those goals, which is why I hope the president understands one very important thing.

It's February—and I encourage anyone who was hurt by the 35-day shutdown that President Trump created for no reason to keep the pressure on the president &amp; his GOP allies this month to NOT go down that path again. 		It was appalling &amp; has no place in the United States of America.
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law a decade ago this week. It was a strong step towards #EqualPay, but the fight isn't over yet. The #PaycheckFairness Act will continue the fight to end the gender wage gap once and for all. 	https://t.co/0ewzazOFdy

In case President Trump missed it, Democrats:	❌ DO NOT support his wasteful wall 	❌ DO NOT want another government shutdown in two weeks		I hope that the president &amp; his Republican allies work with us in good faith to prevent another shutdown instead of playing political games.
Before February 15, we must continue to listen to workers across the country &amp; keep the pressure on President Trump &amp; his Republican allies to not go down the government shutdown path again.

Without justification, we have no reason to believe this deployment is anything but a misuse of our military that will militarize the border, blur law enforcement &amp; military missions, &amp; degrade military readiness. The military isn't a political prop. The public deserves answers.
Today my colleagues and I officially requested—again—that the Trump administration explain to Congress and the American people why thousands of US troops are being deployed to the US-Mexico border for eight more months. This deployment is unprecedented and unexplained.

It’s clear we need to do more to provide stability for our communities and the health centers they depend on, which is why I was proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to provide 5 years of stable funding for community health centers. https://t.co/Llh1SRZvXO
In Ferry County, the funding uncertainty left a center unable to sign annual contracts for needed medical staff and managers. Meanwhile, in Yakima, clinics in some of our most vulnerable communities were at risk of closing.
This time last year in Spokane, in Whatcom County, and on the Olympic Peninsula, new services and expansion plans to address communities’ health needs were jeopardized by the funding freeze community health centers faced.
I remember all too well the challenges our community health centers faced a year ago. They were left waiting for Congress to extend funding for programs that support them and their staff, and give patients access to the care they rely on. We must do better.

I am deeply disappointed in yesterday’s decision, and urge @DeptofDefense not to move forward with this discriminatory #TransMilitaryBan that would create further uncertainty for our troops and degrade our national security.
Instead of listening to the expertise of our military leaders, yesterday's court order sends a message to the transgender community—including servicemembers on the front lines defending our nation—that they're not valuable or welcome in our institutions. 		This is unacceptable.
Two days after the nation came together to reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy and his work to eradicate discrimination, today’s SCOTUS decision on President Trump’s #TransMilitaryBan is more concerning proof that we're still a long way from living Dr. King’s dream.

The Senate passed a bill unanimously last month to keep government open w/o any new money for President Trump’s wasteful wall. This #TrumpShutdown will continue unless he stops insisting on wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall he said Mexico would pay for.
On behalf of families wondering when they’ll get their next paycheck or when their government will be fully functioning, I won’t stop calling on Republicans to work with us to do the right thing and re-open the government as quickly as possible.
Reminder: The #TrumpShutdown is impacting real people with real bills to pay and families to provide for. An estimated 800,000 federal workers have either been furloughed or are going to work without pay this holiday season. This needs to end. https://t.co/84D4iaJCXV

These #ShutDownStories are heartbreaking, and they show us who is really being impacted by President Trump’s unnecessary shutdown. Real people and real families are struggling and it’s time for Republicans to work with us to end this. https://t.co/vFkoQkSutk
Instead of bringing certainty into people’s lives, President Trump is continuing to hurt workers &amp; families w/ the #TrumpShutdown. He said he would be proud to shut down the government—now he seems to not know how to get out of it. It’s time for him to work with Dems to end this.
RT @katyjb88: My husband is active duty Coast Guard. Everyone thinks the military is getting paid during the shutdown, but the Coast Guard…
President Trump said he would be proud to shut down the gov if he couldn’t get taxpayer dollars for his wasteful border wall—he’d take the blame for it.		Now, w/ hundreds of thousands of workers wondering when they will be paid, it’s up to Republicans to work with us to fix it.
Workers across the country are the ones who will feel the impacts of President Trump’s shutdown. So many are left wondering over the holiday when they’ll get their next paycheck or when their government will be fully functioning. This was avoidable. https://t.co/CaOE6RAUhQ
On behalf of families in WA and across the country who are now left wondering when they’ll get their next paycheck or when their government will be fully functioning, I’m urging Republicans to work with us to do the right thing and re-open the government as quickly as possible.
This shutdown is truly absurd, and would not have happened if President Trump had simply ignored the 11th-hour taunts of a handful of conservatives and instead moved forward with the Senate’s bipartisan bill. https://t.co/h2ZPHSk4vC
This is about people and families. Republicans need to do the right thing here before they hurt workers across the country for absolutely no reason at all. https://t.co/P6do1y5lYB
I just landed in DC from home and am headed to vote now against the awful House bill. The Senate already passed a bipartisan bill to fund government and there’s no reason to head to a shutdown.
Democrats have made it clear that we're not going to support taxpayer dollars being wasted to pay for President Trump's border wall. Republicans need to reverse course and do the right thing before they hurt families and workers across the country for absolutely NO REASON at all.
The Senate passed a bipartisan bill to keep the government open through the holidays &amp; into the beginning of next year. Pres Trump had a temper tantrum &amp; now we're headed toward a completely unnecessary shutdown. 		This is truly absurd &amp; no way for a country like ours to be run.

Democrats are waiting. We’re watching—but much more importantly, so are patients and families all across this country who have made it abundantly clear they are tired of reckless, harmful Republican politics on health care.
If President Trump cares about affordable health care for patients and families across the country, his administration can direct the Department of Justice to defend families’ health care like it should have all along.
If Republicans really care about affordable health care for the people they represent, there’s a simple way they can start. They can join Democrats’ resolution making clear that Congress never intended to throw health care into chaos.
We heard a lot about health care from President Trump &amp; Republicans heading into November. We heard that they fought to keep pre-existing conditions protections—and even that every single Republican in the Senate wanted to keep them in place. I found that hard to believe.
Women across the country who no longer have to pay extra on top of their insurance just to get birth control, are wondering whether they’ll once again have to pay more for a basic part of their health care.
Moms and dads who breathed a sigh of relief that a kid’s broken bone—or chronic illness—wouldn’t mean financial ruin, are holding their breath again.
Right in the middle of the holidays, and looking ahead to the new year, people with pre-existing conditions are once again wondering whether the protections they rely on to afford coverage will stay in place.

President Trump said he would be proud to shut down the government if he can’t get billions of dollars of American taxpayer dollars for his wasteful wall—and that he would take the blame if he did.		Well he’s right about who would be to blame—but it shouldn’t even come to that.

Democrats oppose President Trump’s wasteful wall. We don’t think it makes any sense, we don’t think it would make us any more secure —and we don’t understand why he is asking American taxpayers to pay for it after promising, again and again, that Mexico would foot the bill.

“My assault occurred at an off-campus apartment down the street from my school.

I’m going to keep standing up, speaking out, and making clear just how harmful President Trump’s ideological nominees are. I strongly oppose Mr. Kobes’ nomination, and I hope all of my colleagues will do the same. https://t.co/C2RaPIr12q
Hours before the final vote on Judge Kavanaugh, I spoke about how I hoped everyone who was angry would keep fighting for change. And I promised whatever happened, I was going to get up the next day and keep fighting too. I meant it.
Mr. Kobes is closely tied to fake women’s health care centers which seek out women looking for information about their health care needs &amp; reproductive rights, then use misleading—even blatantly false—propaganda to scare &amp; pressure them.
Like many of President Trump’s nominees before him, Mr. Kobes lacks almost any real experience to qualify him for this position. He has little trial experience, little appellate experience, &amp; no record of legal scholarship to speak of.
I’m heading to the floor to speak against the nomination of Jonathan Kobes and keep up the fight against President Trump’s efforts to swing our courts far-right by packing them with ideological judges.

The administration has presented no evidence to suggest asylum seekers pose a national security threat; there has been no justification for why the deployment was extended and the rules of use of force expanded, or why active duty troops were sent at all.
The Trump administration's rationale for deploying active duty troops was to evoke fear &amp; doesn't serve a national security purpose. Continuing to rely on active duty troops militarizes the border &amp; normalizes their deployment domestically—a dangerous precedent for any democracy.

Voters were clear—they don’t want Republicans to keep trying to repeal their health care, and they don’t want President Trump to keep sabotaging it. They want Republicans to return to the negotiating table and work with Democrats on common sense solutions to lower costs.
Breaking a bone shouldn’t break the bank, coming down with a high fever shouldn’t come with a high cost, and filling a prescription shouldn’t mean emptying a savings account. That’s why families want us to come together to address high health care costs.

I ran for the Senate after what happened to Anita Hill in 1991—and I'm confident that if women and their voices are disrespected once again, we’re going to see a wave of anger, frustration, and activism that makes 1992 look like a ripple. 	 	We still have time to do this right.
If this does end up being jammed through, it would eliminate any trust people have in Senate GOP leaders—it would cause tremendous anger &amp; backlash across the country from those who are shocked to see the voices of women &amp; survivors ignored like this.
This isn't a partisan issue—it's common sense. 	 	Like so many people watching last week’s hearing, I was shocked by Judge Kavanaugh’s rage, anger, &amp; condescension. And I know President Trump loved Judge Kavanaugh's performance &amp; it inspired him to openly mock &amp; attack Dr. Ford.
Based on everything I know about the allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh—he should not be confirmed &amp; be in a position to make decisions on the Supreme Court that impact women &amp; families.	 	He testified under oath—and made claims that simply defy belief &amp; were contradicted.
We've heard from other women—Ms. Ramirez, Ms. Swetnick—with their own experiences. They should be listened to, they should be heard, we should presume they are telling the truth.	 	#BelieveSurvivors
I urge my colleagues to vote NO and STOP this mad dash to a rushed confirmation. 	 	I believe Dr. Ford. She has no reason to lie. She was brave &amp; real. Her memories &amp; fear are heartbreaking. Millions of people watched her—and many women &amp; survivors were inspired by her bravery.
I can say that absolutely nothing I saw in the FBI report makes me believe Dr. Ford any less—I'm even more concerned about what we weren’t able to see because the investigation was limited. 	 	Once again, the voices of women &amp; their experiences have been silenced &amp; pushed aside.
This was rigged from the start to protect Judge Kavanaugh.	 	Dr. Ford wasn’t interviewed despite her repeated requests. 	We know Judge Kavanaugh wasn’t questioned again. 	We’ve heard from so many other witnesses who were desperate to talk to the FBI were never even contacted.
This morning, I went in for a briefing on the new FBI investigation and it was very clear that Senate Republican leaders &amp; President Trump cut the FBI off and refused to allow them to conduct the comprehensive and thorough investigation promised to Democrats and Republicans.

Dr. Ford testified under oath—I was moved by her honesty, how real she was, her pain, and her commitment to her “civic duty.” I believe her. 		Judge Kavanaugh testified under oath—angry, defensive, aggrieved, and acted as if he is owed a seat on the Supreme Court.
It’s reported that the WH is doing everything they can to limit the FBI investigation that they assured us would be thorough. 		Will the Senate do its job—or will we allow politics to take over &amp; rush this through before our job is complete?
Last night, President Trump stood on a stage and openly mocked Dr. Ford for not remembering some details of what she has described as the most traumatic event of her life. 		It was disgusting. Dr. Ford isn't "mixed up" and we won't "plow right through this." #BelieveSurvivors

4) This is clearly a partisan attempt by some Republicans to discredit Dr. Ford. No fair and independent investigation would come to a conclusion before hearing from witnesses and gathering more info. –PM
3) This is not a trial. Dr. Ford is not on trial. And Judge Kavanaugh is not on trial. The Senate’s role is to use our judgement – not that of a prosecutor – to make a decision about his fitness to be on the Supreme Court.
2) Senate Republicans chose to make this a he-said-she-said hearing, it didn’t have to and shouldn’t have been. We should have heard from ALL relevant witnesses after full investigation to bring in all facts and info.
1) I watched Dr. Ford share her story &amp; I believe her. She was honest, real, &amp; when she said she was 100% sure, she had absolutely no reason to lie. I watched Judge Kavanaugh &amp; I don’t believe him. He seemed angry, defensive, entitled &amp; untruthful about a range of subjects.
I have four points I want to make about the partisan memo released by Senate Republicans from the prosecutor they brought in to cross examine the sexual assault survivor they were too scared to question themselves.

Dr. Ford welcomed an investigation, answered questions, took a polygraph, &amp; remembered details—like seeing Mark Judge at the supermarket a few weeks later. She did her job as a US citizen.  		Judge Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation—he doesn't want the facts to come out.
Dr. Ford shared her story yesterday because she felt it was her civic duty to share what she knew about Judge Kavanaugh to the people making the decision about whether or not he should be on our nation’s highest court.  		She was real &amp; an inspiration. #BelieveSurvivors

As a preschool teacher I taught my kids not to be bullies and to treat each other with respect. I wish Senate Republicans remembered some of those lessons! -PM
When women speak up about sexual assault they should be listened to and supported, not bullied, rushed, or given artificial deadlines. Playing hardball political games with Dr. Ford is disgusting and needs to end. -PM
@frankthorp @ChuckGrassley Senate Republicans should be ashamed of bullying a sexual assault survivor for their own political gains or any other reason. Dr. Ford has said she wants to testify and Senate Republicans should work with her to accommodate her reasonable requests. –PM
.@BetsyDevosEd's policies will re-expose veterans to the predatory tactics of for-profit schools. That’s just wrong. Our country should always put veterans first, especially when it comes to corporations looking to make a buck regardless of who it hurts.		https://t.co/GCqMBit8tJ
Because the Child Care for Working Families Act will help grow the economy, parents can have access to child care, work full-time, and work to their full potential. It will both create jobs in child care &amp; give parents the economy security that they need. #ChildCare4All https://t.co/1X9wTaiSxk

I was one of four women elected to the Senate after the Anita Hill hearing—and I hoped that 27 years later it would be different. But Dr. Hill is being disrespected &amp; disbelieved—and that's why I will keep standing by her side.		https://t.co/sBqdy0AJfD

I can't say this enough—being on an airplane does not mean the laws don’t apply. Sexual assault is still very much illegal. If someone breaks the law, we want to be sure survivors have the support and guidance they need to seek justice. https://t.co/3eOr3zhRbK

The attacks &amp; threats against Dr. Ford are horrific and they are exactly the reason why she, and so many women in her position, are hesitant to speak up. But I want her and every other woman to know: I stand with you, I believe you, and I will fight for you.
Senate Republicans are sending women who may have more experiences to share about Judge Kavanaugh or anyone else a loud &amp; clear message: if you have been assaulted or harassed by a powerful Republican man, you better not talk about it or you’re going to pay a price.
Dr. Ford should be listened to, believed, &amp; treated w decency &amp; respect. Senate Republicans should delay this hearing &amp; allow a fair &amp; full investigation—only then can we move forward w fair hearings that include all relevant witnesses. My statement here: https://t.co/zpyKJnjeky

I'm glad that Chairman Grassley has started to listen to members telling him he can’t simply sweep  allegations against Judge Kavanaugh under the rug.	 	It’s not just going to go away, and I am glad Republican leaders are starting to realize that.
We must listen to Professor Ford. We must treat this survivor with empathy. We must evaluate this new information. Anything less for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court would be an abdication of the Senate’s constitutional role and it would be absolutely wrong.
We cannot allow Republicans to attack Dr. Ford in a misguided attempt to protect Judge Kavanaugh and put politics ahead of their jobs as United States Senators, and I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to put a stop to it wherever they see it.
Women who come forward should be listened to, heard, and believed—and investigations and all appropriate actions should be taken once they have come forward to share their experiences.
An all-male Judiciary committee dropped the ball in 1991, and we cannot allow an all-male Republican side of the Judiciary Committee do the same in 2018. https://t.co/3A9RqIRnH6
Happy Birthday @usairforce! Thank you for your hard work and service in keeping our country safe. I am grateful for your continual sacrifice to protect the American people.
Transparency can do a lot to help patients and families, but it’s not enough on its own to fix President Trump’s health care sabotage. We need common sense solutions that actually make a difference, drive down costs, and roll back the damage President Trump has done.
We know transparency can help make improvements in health care, but unfortunately instead of increasing transparency President Trump’s sabotage has only increased chaos and made it harder for families to get the care they need. https://t.co/lk4Z5oKuVH
I was motivated to run for the Senate after watching the truly awful way Anita Hill was treated by an all-male Judiciary Committee interrogating her about the now-Justice Clarence Thomas.	 	It was wrong in 1991. It’s wrong in 2018 and we must do better this time.

There is no urgency to fill this seat before October. Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for more than a year all to prevent President Obama from fulfilling his constitutional role. Surely we can take the time we need now in order to fulfill OUR constitutional role.
Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination needs to be delayed—we absolutely cannot go forward with a vote this Thursday. The idea that this nomination would be jammed through given what we know now is almost unthinkable and would be shameful and wrong.

While the Opioid Crisis Response Act is an important bipartisan step in addressing this national tragedy this is an ongoing crisis, meaning our efforts to fight it must be ongoing too.
I'm heading to the Senate floor to talk about my bipartisan agreement and the Opioid Crisis Response Act which the Senate just passed to help communities and families on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic.

It would be inconceivable &amp; abhorrent to hold a vote on this nominee in the coming days—we need time to evaluate this new information and give it the scrutiny it deserves. Anything less would be an absolute abdication of the Senate’s constitutional advice &amp; consent role.
The fact is that Senators now have new information about a potential crime committed by a nominee for the highest court in the land and an accuser who has come forward with details of the alleged criminal act.
This week’s Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh should be delayed. It’s not a debatable or difficult decision.
I want to thank Prof. Ford for her bravery. I can only imagine the trauma &amp; heartache involved in sharing &amp; reliving a sexual assault like this—she should know that I and millions of people are standing by her side and stand ready to help however we can. https://t.co/ubOYcKrV2p
Under Judge Kavanaugh’s vision for our country, a woman’s ability to get reproductive health care would overwhelmingly depend, like it did before Roe, on whether she could afford it, and therefore, disproportionately on her race and zip code as well.

Make no mistake, in the Supreme Court fight, families’ health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions are at stake. Families across the country know this isn’t a matter of partisan politics—it’s a matter of life and death.

It would be a disgraceful for Republicans to schedule hearings on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee as they continue to block the release of Judge Kavanuagh’s full record—especially as the cloud of corruption surrounding President Trump grows by the day.
There is no reason for Republicans to rush this Supreme Court nominee through given that President Trump appears to be an unindicted co-conspirator of a federal crime and the Supreme Court may soon have to take up a case related to his potential crimes and corruption.

Most of the country agrees that it’s not too much to ask to see Judge Kavanaugh’s full record before he’s given a seat on our nation’s highest court—the only people who seem to disagree are President Trump &amp; Senate Republicans. https://t.co/act5R3Rbgh
The National Archives says it needs more time to produce Judge Kavanaugh’s records so the public can have a full picture of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.		People and families deserve to know about Judge Kavanaugh’s complete record. Keep making your voices heard.
“But according to a deep, data-driven survey of his writings from the bench, Kavanaugh…is an uncommonly partisan judge…Trump is seizing this opportunity to shape a generation of US jurisprudence, &amp; the direction he’s chosen is a hard right turn.” https://t.co/Wb9Wm1r9Xi

The next time President Trump tries to distract us by tweeting about personnel problems in his administration, don’t forget:		Hundreds of kids are still sitting in detention centers, separated from their families, because of President Trump’s heartless ‘zero-tolerance’ policy.

It’s clear from Judge Kavanaugh’s record that he will find any interpretation of the law that helps corporations avoid their obligations to working people, and I’m calling on every worker to make their voices heard and oppose his nomination. #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/fcM4ZOgNvp

Judge Kavanaugh’s record proves he would not be the fair voice working families need. Throughout his long career, Kavanaugh has repeatedly sided with corporate special interests at the expense of workers, their rights, and their families. #StopKavanaugh
Through a series of executive orders, President Trump has taken steps to make it harder for federal workers to organize, bargain collectively for better wages and conditions, and resolve disputes equitably—sending a clear signal this Administration won’t stand up for workers.
The federal government has a responsibility to ensure every worker is treated fairly and with dignity. The government has an even more direct responsibility to look after its own workers, and should be a model for protecting the rights of workers.
Federal workers ensure our grandparents receive Social Security. They investigate claims of wage theft. They’re the nurses and doctors who take care of veterans. They’re the first responders when natural disasters strike. They protect our water and air.	 	I stand with them.

When I examine the record and history of a Supreme Court nominee, I hope to see a breadth of life experience, or the ability to walk in someone else’s shoes. Judge Kavanaugh has not demonstrated either of these qualities.
Anyone who says President Trump isn’t applying an anti-choice litmus test in this nomination — or thinks it’s unclear where President Trump’s allegiance lies when it comes to women’s health — should take a look at what he’s said and done.
While President Trump has broken promise after promise to workers &amp; families, he has never once wavered in following through for those anti-choice special interests. He has done virtually everything he can to chip away at women's reproductive rights from the Oval Office.
I’ll keep saying it: the threat to women’s reproductive rights is frighteningly real. It is real because unless Democrats and Republicans come together, President Trump will follow through on his promise to overturn Roe.
Should Judge Kavanaugh be confirmed, he would be a fifth vote on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and roll back reproductive rights women have had for more than four decades. https://t.co/o4U5ZPHoeR

Nobody should be fooled. Judge Kavanaugh is a rubber stamp —he will stand with special interests over families—and he will take our country in the wrong direction.

At a time when millions of Americans have taken to the streets in recent months to demand action on gun violence, Judge Kavanaugh has taken a far more expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment, and has vigorously argued that assault weapons bans are unconstitutional.

I believed President Trump when he said he was determined to undermine patients’ health care in order to satisfy right-wing special interests. Health care, especially for people with pre-existing conditions, is on the line with this nomination.
Judge Kavanaugh’s record is clear. The facts are clear. He is an extreme pick who would be devastating for our country if confirmed—and we need to do everything we can to stop it.
President Trump has systematically worked to roll back decades of progress through our courtrooms— from the Supreme Court on down—which will have long-lasting impacts, stretching far beyond his time in the White House.
I’m heading to the Senate floor to join my colleagues in making it clear just how high the stakes are when it comes to our nation’s highest courts—for our families, for our communities, for our country—and for our future. -PM
President Trump promised to pick #SCOTUS nominees who’d roll back families’ health care. He picked Judge Kavanaugh—someone vetted by far-right groups to do just that. Trump clearly doesn’t doubt Kavanaugh would strike down pre-existing condition protections. We shouldn’t either.
As President Trump &amp; @BetsyDeVosED move to reverse the progress we’ve made to strengthen diversity in our classrooms, glad to see institutions across WA affirm the value of diversity in education &amp; commit to keeping it alive on campuses across our state. https://t.co/g7A2nIcNBC

I’m calling on my Republican colleagues to stand w Democrats &amp; people across the country by taking action to hold Russia accountable &amp; protect our country from future attacks. And ask who—or what—is motivating our President. https://t.co/8GVGkBtF3a
This is not a partisan issue—this about defending the integrity &amp; foundational values of our nation. This is about Congress doing its job &amp; holding the President accountable for his shocking &amp; repeated failures. And this is about putting the country before party.
With the power to call up legislation &amp; hold hearings, Republican leaders have options, and they certainly have a whole lot of Democrats who stand ready &amp; willing to help. So my message to every member of the Senate, and to every member of the House, is clear:
It’s time to: 	-strengthen Russian sanctions 	-demand answers from WH about the Trump-Putin closed-door meeting &amp; provide any notes that exist	-protect DOJ, the FBI &amp; the special counsel 	-extradite the 12 Russians indicted for election attacks	-pass election security legislation
Many Republicans in Congress are acting as if they aren’t the party in control of the Senate and the House &amp; they don’t have the ability to actually make a difference &amp; demand change. This is absurd—and the time for handwringing &amp; hoping the problem just goes away is over.
Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed outrage at President Trump’s disgraceful remarks, and I’m glad to see them speaking up, because words matter. But you know what also matters? Action. 	 	Now, we must all ask: what will Congressional Republicans do about this?
The world watched yesterday as President Trump showered praise upon the Russian President who directed the interference of our elections. It was deeply horrifying &amp; alarming that our President failed to use that moment to push Putin to end his attacks on our country &amp; elections.
Instead of standing up for our national values &amp; security, our President defended Putin on all fronts. Now it seems Trump is desperately trying to backtrack—but we all heard what he said &amp; know where he stands. It’s appalling, inexcusable, &amp; unworthy of the Presidency.

We’ve gotten some updates, but there are still a lot of questions that have not been answered, a lot of families that have not been reunited, and therefore a lot of work that has to be done—fast https://t.co/G27OanRqbj
It’s so important that we continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable for the chaos and heartbreak it has caused for the thousands of children it has cruelly and needlessly separated from their parents.
Another reason Congress must pass #SASCA—it’s unacceptable that all across the US, countless survivors of sexual assault are turned away from hospitals that don’t have the resources or trained staff to provide the care they need. https://t.co/DJVSmIFze2

After families stood up and rejected Trumpcare, which would have spiked premiums, gutted Medicaid, and put families back at the mercy of the big insurance companies, President Trump did everything he could to sabotage health care from the Oval Office.

We must do all we can to support survivors of sexual assault on the path to recovery—that’s why I introduced the Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act (#SASCA) to ensure our hospitals &amp; nurses are equipped w the resources &amp; training they need to help survivors seek justice.
Republican leaders need to stand with Democrats and people across the country in not only condemning President Trump, but in taking action to hold Russia accountable and protect our country from future attacks.
Anyone who believes our President should put the US above Russia should be concerned by what they saw today. And anyone who is wondering why the President is choosing to defend Russia &amp; blame America should join us in asking what, or who, President Trump is being motivated by.
It was truly horrifying and deeply alarming to see the President of the United States stand with the President of Russia in undercutting the work of our intelligence agencies and blaming America for the attacks on our elections and our democracy.
Time &amp; again, we’ve seen President Trump respond to pressure from people across the country who have raised their voices to hold him &amp; his administration accountable.
Families across the globe are risking everything to flee violence &amp; persecution in their countries &amp; start a new life here in the US--only to be thrown in jail &amp; needlessly separated from their children for weeks, even months. 		This is not who we are, &amp; we can’t let this stand.
Your daily reminder that after several weeks, thousands of young migrant kids are still needlessly sitting in detention centers on orders from the Trump Administration &amp; are waiting for officials to finally reunite them w their parents.  	 	Thousands.
Our new bipartisan #SASCA is a strong step forward for survivors &amp; will help ensure when they come to the hospital for treatment that they have access to experienced providers &amp; get support that is critical to holding their perpetrators accountable. https://t.co/KCRGdTkIgH
President Trump has insulted our intelligence community and actively hurt American interests around the world, and this warrants a strong response from Republican leaders.
For President Trump to stand side-by-side today with President Putin and not only fail to condemn Putin for Russian meddling—or Russia’s many other aggressions around the world—is inexcusable.
The US intelligence community concluded more than a year ago that Russia did in fact meddle in our elections. What’s more, there is every reason to believe Russia will do it again in the next election.
In Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump has found exactly what he was looking for—someone who will put extreme, right-wing ideology ahead of patients’ access to health care.
Too many hospitals don’t have the resources or trained staff to help sexual assault survivors hold their perpetrators accountable. Passing #SASCA to help provide survivors the support they need is a critical step in the right direction. https://t.co/ivPgrMd8Jc
Democrats are going to keep fighting for patients and families and against President Trump’s efforts to sabotage health care. And we're going to keep fighting against Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. #WhatsAtStake

Judge Kavanaugh is the ideological dream pick for President Trump, Vice President Pence, and the conservative special interests whose lists they’re choosing from, and we have to keep making our voices heard against his nomination.
There is simply too much at stake to sit on the sidelines. We can defeat this Supreme Court nomination, but only if we do it the way we defeated Trumpcare—when people across the country stood up and said “not on our watch."
The majority of Americans do not want our daughters and granddaughters to lose constitutional protections women have had for more than four decades. This is what’s at stake with President Trump’s extreme Supreme Court nominee.
Roe v. Wade affirmed that women in the United States have the constitutional right to make their own reproductive health care decisions—and we’re committed to doing everything we can to ensure that right is protected. https://t.co/IQZRtDIrzH
I am going to continue to demand transparency from the Trump Administration and the companies that are trying to influence it and shine a spotlight on deals like this that raise so many alarming ethical questions. https://t.co/TA0jJIydKb

The public was rightly concerned to learn President Trump’s close associates are selling access to the Administration and getting million dollar contracts from drug companies. https://t.co/77WRHOgl5e
Make no mistake: if Judge Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court bench, five men will be empowered to overturn Roe v. Wade and take us back to the days when women didn’t have the option of accessing safe, legal abortion.
With President Trump’s nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, we have never been more at risk of going backward. And I’m going to keep standing with women across the country against each and every attempt by President Trump to restrict women’s access to care.
President Trump has broken promise after promise, but he has never once wavered in listening to extreme, ideological special interests when it comes to women’s access to health care. #WhatsAtStake

I voted against Judge Kavanaugh when he was nominated for the circuit court and I strongly oppose this nomination now.	 	I’m also calling on all of my colleagues to stand with me in rejecting him.
President Trump has nominated another anti-worker, anti-union nominee to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has a long history of ruling in the favor of corporations &amp; big business—at the expense of workers. I’m going to keep fighting against attempts to undermine working families.
As dark money groups have spent billions on campaigns designed to chip away at workers’ rights, union membership and workers’ bargaining power have both declined. As a result, wages for working families have stagnated, while billionaires like the Koch brothers have gotten richer.
Unions helped create the 40-hour workweek, end child labor, and strengthen the middle class. When unions have the power to bargain on behalf of employees, we’re all better off. But the Supreme Court’s recent #Janus decision undermines their ability to do exactly that.
I’m about to speak on the vital role that unions play in raising wages and creating pathways to the middle class at our hearing with labor leaders, teachers, and home care workers. Watch live: https://t.co/PBPSUGZIk6
A vote for President Trump’s Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to step back from the progress we’ve made to expand rights, freedoms, and basic human decency to LGBTQ Americans.
Mr. Benczkowski is not the nominee our country needs, especially when so many questions remain about Trump's ties to Russia. We need someone free of conflicts and someone with real experience. I will be voting NO.
It is outrageous that President Trump’s pick to lead DOJ criminal division not only has 0 prosecutorial experience, but has direct ties to Russia’s Alfa Bank. Benczkowski is not up to the job when it comes to getting all the answers in the Russia Investigation.
A vote for President Trump’s Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to give massive corporations even more power over our economy, our workers, and our elections.

More than any President I’ve seen, President Trump has been explicit about what he expects from a nominee. He has laid out specific tests &amp; promised to only pick nominees from a pre-screened list of people who would absolutely meet them.

I’m heading to the floor to talk about my strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh for a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. -PM
I’m urging everyone—in red states and blue states, big cities and small towns—to make their voice heard right now: call your Senator, show up at rallies, organize online and in person. There is so much at stake.
This is not a time for anyone to sit back &amp; watch while the Supreme Court and the future of our nation hangs in the balance. We just need a few Republicans to stand up to President Trump and stand with Democrats and people across the country in rejecting this nominee.
President Trump must nominate someone who is clearly &amp; strongly committed to not rolling back settled law when it comes to women’s health &amp; patient protections—&amp; to protecting the rights &amp; freedoms that people across the country hold so dear. Judge Kavanaugh fails on both counts.
I’m also calling on all my Senate colleagues to stand with me and with people across the country in rejecting Kavanaugh. https://t.co/W250csawLX

Let’s be clear: when the Trump-Pence Administration tells you not to worry about your constitutionally protected health care rights, you should get worried. If you care about a woman’s right to control her own body in our country, now is the time to make your voice heard.
Simply living or traveling near the border is not a sufficient reason to hassle or detain people in WA—proud to introduce legislation to limit warrantless searches near our national borders. https://t.co/dSiovDnkt9

I want to be clear: Republican leaders should give families across the country the opportunity to weigh in, with an election, before moving forward to fill this seat.
A right means nothing with the ability to exercise it, which is why we can’t remain silent as radical Republicans create new barriers to prevent women from making their own health care decisions. I won’t stop fighting, and I know women across the country won’t either.
Two years ago, the Supreme Court once again affirmed the constitutional right of women to make decisions about their own body and future—including the right to safe, legal abortion. And I will not stop fighting to protect the progress we’ve made.
There are plenty of commonsense things we can do to bring down health care costs, for example Washington state’s Medicaid Transformation is leading the way in developing innovative programs to provide higher quality care at lower cost.
Let me be clear: women and men in this country understand how directly tied a woman’s freedom to make her own decision about her own body is to her economic security. And they overwhelmingly do not want to see that right rolled back. https://t.co/b5rGM7IIZ1
One issue that I know women across the country will be focused on and asking about is their constitutionally protected right to control their own health care decisions, affirmed in Roe v. Wade.

People are going to want to know: will their rights be protected? Will their freedoms be secure? Will SCOTUS put people like them first or stand with special interests, big biz, and the most extreme ideologues in our country?
I share the deep concern of so many families across this country who are already suffering under the Trump Administration and fear further erosion of the progress in this country.
It is clear that Justice Kennedy’s retirement comes at a pivotal point in our nation’s history, when so many of our values are under attack by a president who has spent every day in office testing the limits of our Constitution.

The crisis of rising health care premiums was avoidable. We had a bipartisan deal to stabilize markets and lower costs, but Republican leaders refused to back it. When they're ready to put people before politics, I’m here at the table, ready to take much-needed action.

Back home in Washington state, I’ve met far too many people struggling with skyrocketing drug prices, and rising insurance premiums. Our families are interested in solutions, not President Trump’s sabotage.
Democrats will continue to stand up for workers and their right to be treated fairly on the job, and I urge all Republicans in Congress who claim to care about the economic security of the middle class to work with us to strengthen the rights of workers.
For more than a century, unions have organized to lift up the voices of workers who were otherwise unheard, and fought for fair pay, safer working conditions, and better benefits.
Today’s #SCOTUS decision is a loss for working people and yet another win for corporate special interests that have spent decades funding political campaigns and lawsuits designed to chip away at workers’ rights.

Last year, GAO looked at programs to promote safe gun storage (like Lok-It-Up in King County) to better prevent gun-related harm, parents must safely store firearms so children do not encounter them in the first place. #AskingSavesLives https://t.co/6KzQIP41xR

If we can find hope in one thing, it is knowing that all the calls and emails and letters—all that outcry—got through to the President to change course on one of his most heartless policies yet. But we can’t let up now.
President Trump has claimed for days that he needed Congressional action to do anything at all. Today, he proved that to be simply untrue.
We are better than this. We must be better than this. Turning children into bargaining chips, or leverage points, or deterrents—that kind of cruelty should not be an option in our great nation. https://t.co/Rj4qRRjTER
We’re still digging into Trump’s EO, but here's what we know right now:	If implemented, there will continue to be zero tolerance for all asylum seekers, including domestic violence survivors, a system of locking up children by the thousands &amp; all carried out in our country’s name
While it’s a good thing President Trump dialed back his systematic child abuse—it’s not enough.	 	We are not going to say everything is OK, and we are not going to stay quiet.
President Trump says his executive order stops the separation, but does that mean starting today? Next month? When? What about the thousands of children who were removed? Will they ever see their parents again, and if so, when? Where?
Today we saw President Trump change his story about whether he did in fact have the ability to make it stop, but so many questions remain: How parents are being informed about their children’s safety, where they are located, when they will be reunited?
People nationwide have have been watching the pain this forced family separation has caused so many innocent children and have begged President Trump to pick up the phone, sign a piece of paper—do whatever it takes to make it stop.

Democrats are still at the table. We’ll be here all August ready to fix this for families in Washington state and across the country. I hope Republicans will return to the table and join us on finding solutions to lower patients’ costs and strengthen health care in our country.
While President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have never fought for patients—as their latest decision makes abundantly clear—Democrats have never stopped fighting for them. And we’re not going to stop now.
Trumpcare failed because people across the country made it clear they didn’t support President Trump’s sabotage agenda. President Trump didn’t listen. Instead he’s continued to undermine health care for our families at every opportunity, and Congressional Republicans have helped.
This decision is unacceptable—it will abandon laws that prevent insurers from denying people with pre-existing conditions coverage, charging people more because of their gender, and raising premiums without limit for seniors and effectively pricing them out of the market.
Last week, the Trump Administration showed once again there’s no limit to how low and how baseless they’ll go to appeal to extreme Republican donors and special interests. DOJ announced that it will ignore years of precedent and abandon its duty to defend our laws in court.

President Trump listing proposals from his partisan budget as accomplishments to reduce drug costs is like saying dinner is served dinner when you’ve only written a grocery list. And in this case, most of the ingredients are for a big nothing-burger.
In fact, despite his claim that he was ‘very much eliminating the middlemen,’ his plan includes proposals which would have the opposite effect—empowering the companies he calls middlemen, without any data to suggest it will bring down prices for patients.
While campaigning, President Trump constantly brought up the idea of negotiating lower prices through Medicare—but it’s nowhere to be found in his proposal. As with so many other issues, President Trump talked a big game, and then, instead of backing it up, he backed away.
President Trump hyped his drug pricing plan as a big step forward—it’s very clearly not. In fact, when he announced his plan to bring drug companies’ prices down, their stocks actually went up.
Too many families are struggling to make ends meet because of skyrocketing drug prices. 1 in 4 people report that someone in their family didn’t get a prescription filled because cost. 1 in 4 cancer patients avoided filling a prescription for the same reason.
As a candidate, President Trump talked a big game on lowering drug prices, but after 500 days in office the only health care “Price” he has dropped is his former Secretary.

What a thrilling ride, indeed—yesterday’s game may not have ended how we wanted, but it doesn’t diminish @UWSoftball's inspiring drive &amp; amazing accomplishments this season. WA is so proud of you! #MightyAreTheWomen https://t.co/OrLttTH5Fe
President Trump promised not to cut Medicare, but recent reports show that his tax plan could weaken it and hurt patients nationwide. Republicans’ relentless health care sabotage has got to stop. https://t.co/2Axw6eD7It
Countless women in WA &amp; across the nation depend on health providers like Planned Parenthood for basic care. It’s impossible to overstate the detrimental impact President Trump’s ideological assault on women’s reproductive health will have on families &amp; public health.
Sending positive energy to @UWSoftball ahead of tonight’s game—you’ve got a state full of proud Washingtonians cheering you on! #MightyAreTheWomen
This is disgraceful. I share @SenJeffMerkley’s outrage at the treatment of these children on US soil, and we must continue fighting back against President Trump’s repeated attempts to take our country backward. https://t.co/knbtsr7ULu
Now, President Trump is finalizing policies to allow insurers to sell junk plans, which would spike health care costs for sick patients &amp; gut protections intended to ensure coverage meets the needs of women, seniors, and people who need mental health &amp; substance abuse treatment. https://t.co/UrEGkLqgqF
Make no mistake: even though President Trump wasn’t able to jam his awful Trumpcare bill through Congress, he is implementing it step-by-step from the Oval Office—and it is driving up health costs for people nationwide.

With this budget, once again, @BetsyDeVosED is ignoring what millions of parents, teachers, and students are asking for — and has instead proposed more than $4 billion in cuts to elementary and secondary education. https://t.co/MTlyumhDVO
@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED has taken concerning steps to undermine students’ rights by attempting to scale back the Office for Civil Rights; she’s rescinded guidance protecting transgender students, has made it easier for schools to again sweep sexual assault under the rug, and so much more.
@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED has made it easier for predatory for-profit colleges and student loan companies to take advantage of students by rolling back a number of consumer protections, and has effectively dismantled the unit that investigates claims of fraud and abuse.
@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED continues to prioritize her extreme privatization agenda—which would siphon taxpayer dollars away from public schools.
No matter how we judge @BetsyDeVosED’s actions over the past year—either on the basis of proficiency or growth—the result is a failing grade.
This couldn’t be clearer when looking at her actions over the past year --and today, I’m prepared to ask her questions on the budget she is in the Senate to defend:	https://t.co/WZ3cUmKDXK https://t.co/uaq901u4mj
Instead of listening to the concerns of parents, teachers, &amp; students who have made their voices heard, @BetsyDeVosED has doubled down on a harmful agenda &amp; filled the @usedgov with for-profit college executives &amp; lobbyists looking out for their former employers and clients.
Must-read op-ed on the threat of losing the Arctic Refuge, one of our last great wild places, to oil &amp; gas drilling: “We should not be a nation that trades away our children’s future for reckless, shortsighted political gimmicks. We are better than this.” https://t.co/LobjIDmB8j

The Trump-Pence Administration’s most recent attack on women’s health will only energize Democrats across the country. Those who believe in a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions about her own body will keep making their voices heard.
I am proud of Washington state for leading the way in sexual health education. Lesson plans from King County’s highly-successful Family Life and Sexual Health (FLASH) program were downloaded 80,000 times last year by educators across the country.

Another report shows that in Washington state Republicans’ junk plans and repeal efforts are estimated to cause premiums to increase over a thousand dollars. Higher premiums and more uninsured are the trend across the country—but they didn’t have to be.	https://t.co/ctiaZdrwyA
#TitleX family planning funds are critical for women across the country, and according to recent studies, in 2015, these funds supported contraceptive services that helped WA women to prevent 17,700 unintended pregnancies and 6,000 abortions. https://t.co/eYc4bybilO
The new warnings about the impact of Republicans’ health care sabotage efforts are becoming alarmingly familiar. Rising health care costs and millions more uninsured. https://t.co/J25RHycycp
In Washington state in 2015, there were 64 family planning clinics that received #TitleX funding, providing care for 82,520 women. President Trump’s move to roll back these family planning funds is an attack on women’s health and freedoms. https://t.co/mogr01cUnS
Republican’s don’t have to continue down this destructive path, and I hope they won’t choose to—Democrats are still at the table and ready to work together on serious solutions to try to lower costs, expand access, and help more families get the care they need.
Unfortunately Republican leaders are more focused on appealing to their far-right base than solving problems. They ended talks by demanding language to undermine women’s health care they knew was a nonstarter, some are even back to extreme repeal efforts. https://t.co/Awumqb2iYH
President Trump didn’t have to undermine health care by expanding junk insurance, Republicans didn’t have to sabotage it with a partisan tax bill, and they certainly didn’t have to torpedo bipartisan efforts to make things better.

This move by the Trump-Pence Admin would put a domestic gag rule in place, forbidding health care providers who receive #TitleX family planning funds from discussing the full range of repro care options w/ patients—a brazen attempt to interfere w/ women’s access to health care.
Let me be clear: President Trump and Vice President Pence’s opinions have no place in a woman’s conversations with her doctor about her health care—and I and women nationwide are going to fight this deeply harmful, ideological effort every step of the way. https://t.co/6b4qpIHliw

Our health care workforce training programs have a positive impact—but we need to invest in that impact on a larger scale. Compared to the scope of the problem, we are fighting fires with a squirt gun.
We need to make sure we have a strong pipeline to recruit, train, and retain more health professionals, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and we need to make sure that pipeline includes professionals who have different backgrounds and specialties.

@SecAzar @HHSGov Families want us to solve important issues like the opioid crisis, the high maternal  mortality rate, and the epidemic of gun violence—not sabotage health care and raise families’ premiums.
@SecAzar @HHSGov Any attempt by the Administration to break its promises and undo the bipartisan funding deal the President signed into law would be a major breach of faith, and we will strongly oppose it.
@SecAzar @HHSGov A budget isn’t just a set of numbers, it’s a statement of values and priorities—and President Trump’s budget proposal for @HHSgov shows this Administration does not value evidence, science, and good policymaking practices.
Heading to an appropriations hearing to ask @SecAzar about my concerns with President Trump’s backwards budget proposal for @HHSgov and the many red flags it raises about how they plan to keep our communities healthy.

Republicans in Congress haven’t  just sat by and watched—they helped sabotage families’ health care, by passing a tax bill that President Trump’s own former Secretary of Health admitted would cause premiums to go up.

I oppose this latest reckless move by President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, and I strongly encourage him to reconsider. -PM
This decision also erodes our ability to make new diplomatic agreements as we head into critical talks with North Korea, and it increases regional tension and moves us closer to armed conflict that should be avoided if at all possible.
President Trump taking these steps to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal right now, without presenting any good evidence or rationale that Iran has violated it, moves us further from our goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
Once again, we must raise our voices &amp; defend our communities against these efforts to rip the social safety net away from families in need. As a voice for WA, I pledge to continue fighting back against these cruel, reckless proposals.
WA needs more, not less, affordable housing—but the Trump Administration’s plan to slash funding for key housing programs would make it much harder to connect WA families in need w affordable housing options in their communities #CutsHurt
As communities in WA &amp; across the country address homelessness, the last thing our federal government should be doing is making it harder for families to find a safe, affordable place to call home #OurHomesOurVoices
President Trump and Republicans in Congress have intentionally made it harder for people to get health care coverage by making open enrollment windows shorter and slashing investments in telling people about their coverage options.
Happy #NationalTeacherAppreciationDay to all of our amazing teachers out there who do such an amazing job day in and day out teaching our children and helping their communities. https://t.co/wn6pBJGEnD
President Trump and Republicans in Congress have intentionally made it harder for people to get health care coverage by making open enrollment windows shorter and slashing investments in telling people about their coverage options.
President Trump and Republicans in Congress have created confusion and uncertainty about the future of health care in our country and have said the best thing would be to let it “explode.”
President Trump couldn’t force Trumpcare through Congress—so he decided to create it from the Oval Office by sabotaging families’ health care in every way he could. https://t.co/gwlwPjC0vT

This should be a lesson to Republican leaders and those trying to cut corners and jam nominees through the Senate—there is a reason that we want to take the time to scrutinize nominees and make sure they are ready and able to do the job.
The position of VA Secretary has never been, nor should ever be, an afterthought. I hope President Trump takes the lessons of this failed nominee to heart &amp; recommends someone with the integrity, leadership, management experience, and dedication to serve our veterans.
The lack of scrutiny that President Trump gave his most recent VA Secretary nominee is an insult to the millions of veterans who deserve a serious and strong leader who is ready on day one to bring this agency up to what is expected by all Americans. https://t.co/7vLSqKE149

Throughout his nomination process, Director Pompeo failed to convince me that he is that person. So I will vote no on his nomination to be Secretary of State, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
The Secretary of State position is always a critically important position. But it takes on even more meaning in 2018. The president not only needs good counsel navigating our complex global relationships, he also desperately needs someone who can tell him when he’s wrong.
Director Pompeo has repeatedly supported the Global Gag Rule which keeps funding from clinics and programs that provide women important medical care and voted to defund the UN Population Fund which provides family planning services for women around the world living in poverty.
I’m afraid Director Pompeo would undo much of that legacy, and undermine so much of the global progress we have made. https://t.co/8ijPZqPOUt
Our nation has an important role to uphold as a global champion of women’s rights. We need a Secretary of State who will be a strong advocate &amp; continue our legacy of leadership fighting for women’s health, reproductive freedom, and the rights of women &amp; girls across the world.
The position of Secretary of State is too important &amp; the stakes are too high to let Director Pompeo  slide by w/o full consideration of what it would mean for him to be our nation’s top diplomat—the person whose every word and action broadcasts America’s values to the the world.
I’m heading to the Senate floor to voice my strong opposition to Director Pompeo’s nomination to be our next Secretary of State. -PM
It's the Dept of Education's responsibility to protect the civil rights of every student. Instead, @BetsyDeVosED has dismissed more than 500 disability rights cases. Enforcing the rights of students with disabilities should be a top priority for Sec DeVos. https://t.co/4HvFK990Gd

Someone has to do the work on behalf of the families we represent—and if the past year and a half is any indication – it’s certainly not going to be President Trump or his Administration.
I know the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee is ready to dig into Mr. Jackson’s nomination, and I am hopeful that we can get the facts we need, debate them as appropriate, and do our jobs free from any political attempts to jam this nominee through.
Yet President Trump – who paid a whole lot of lip service to veterans during his campaign—either didn’t care, or didn’t bother to take the time to ensure he was sending over a fully-vetted nominee. It’s sloppy, it’s disrespectful to our veterans, and it’s just wrong.
When this country sends men and women to war, we have an obligation to care for them long after they return. And critical to fulfilling that promise is a strong VA, led by a highly-qualified VA Secretary who is free from ethical conflicts.
When it comes to President Trump’s nominees, Democrats have made it very clear: we’re not going to allow nominees to be jammed through without proper scrutiny and debate.		No cutting corners. No playing fast and loose with the facts. No cutting off debate.
This should be pretty basic work in the Senate, but it’s more important now than ever before. https://t.co/YgsJzfj9tf
One of the most important roles we have in the Senate is to advise &amp; consent on Presidential nominees—to scrutinize &amp; make sure they are qualified, ensure they'll put people ahead of special interests, &amp; that they don’t have ethical challenges, financial issues, or other concerns
Any one of the cases Mr. Duncan has taken, or the ideological arguments he has made should raise alarm— all of them together paint an unmistakable picture of a nominee who would not uphold women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, or civil rights.
In my home state of Washington, Mr. Duncan filed a brief arguing pharmacies should be allowed to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions for ideological reasons. Fortunately, his views did not prevail.
Mr. Duncan was on the wrong side of these rights in the infamous Hobby Lobby case, fighting for intolerant bathroom bans against transgender people, and defending the discriminatory Voter ID law in North Carolina which SCOTUS struck down.
Heading to the floor to oppose Kyle Duncan to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals – he’s an ideological nominee with an awful track record working against women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, and civil rights. -PM

President Trump’s latest ideological move to change the focus of our efforts to prevent teen pregnancy away from evidence-based programs could undermine so much of the progress we’ve made in recent years. https://t.co/nIkxlInCZF
President Trump and Republicans are continuing their Trumpcare efforts with a new #JunkPlans proposal. These plans would mean higher costs for those with pre-existing conditions—and no guarantee of coverage for essential health needs. https://t.co/B5XXWffyNw

We’ve stood together against Trump Administration officials like @EPAScottPruitt who disregard scientific consensus, &amp; have held them accountable for promoting a partisan agenda at odds with their agency’s mission to protect our environment &amp; communities. https://t.co/8OvRlVHXgP
We’ve raised our voices against reckless proposals that would threaten our ecosystem, like when @SecretaryZinke initially announced plans to allow oil &amp; gas drilling in our waters before meeting a wave of opposition from passionate Washingtonians &amp; others https://t.co/xWy0SLKOfU
We’ve advanced solutions for key WA environmental priorities, like fixing how we fund wildfire prevention to help ensure efforts to fight &amp; prevent dangerous wildfire disasters that threaten homes, wildlife &amp; natural resources are adequately funded. https://t.co/t3hLAGn8UT
From the start, WA has helped lead the fight against the Trump Administration’s anti-environment agenda, from holding the line on important issues like combatting climate change to conducting critical research to help our communities live more sustainably. https://t.co/azCoxm2Whr
Happy #EarthDay2018! As we celebrate &amp; reaffirm our commitment to protecting our planet, it’s equally important to remember the ways we’ve worked together to secure a healthier tomorrow &amp; a cleaner, more sustainable future for the next generation. Some important highlights:
From Washington state, to the other Washington—Al Swift was a champion for the environment and our natural treasures. He helped me so much when I was elected, he worked so hard for his constituents, and his legacy will live on. -PM

Under President Trump, @Interior has moved to shrink or remove designations from some our prestigious national parks—compromising vital wildlife habitats &amp; natural resources—in an effort to open up more land for additional oil &amp; gas drilling: https://t.co/unk6I09Mv1
Earlier this month, @EPA decided to roll back fuel emission standards, threatening the quality of the air we breathe &amp; undermining efforts to slow the effects of climate change: https://t.co/RGVWSrGFV2
As we approach Earth Day &amp; reflect on the beauty &amp; importance of the environment to our culture, economy &amp; lives, it is critical that we stay focused on fighting back against President Trump’s agenda that would compromise our precious ecosystem. A few recent examples:
Every student—no matter where they're from, how they learn, or how much money their parents make—deserves a good, public education. Thank you @MandyRheaWrites, for inspiring students in Spokane every day. -PM #NTOY18 https://t.co/qe4ZgeYM9z

Scott Pruitt has shown time &amp; again he is more interested in using his power to help himself, his campaign donors &amp; his industry friends than protecting families' health and safety. It’s time for him to resign.

If Rep. Bridenstine doesn't understand basic science about our planet, how can he lead an agency dedicated to science and discovery beyond Earth?
Rep. Bridenstine not only is not committed to science—he flat out rejects clear scientific consensus.		Without a commitment to science, @NASA would not have succeeded. And if that commitment doesn’t continue, it will fail. https://t.co/pzbGM4IiNa
I just called on my colleagues once again to reject Rep. Bridenstine’s nomination for NASA Administrator because I believe his failure to accept fundamental scientific truths about Earth’s climate make him an ill-suited &amp; dangerous choice to lead an agency w/ science at its core.
Carlos Muniz has a record of putting politics before students. He worked for the FL Attorney General, who accepted a political donation from President Trump, and at the very same time decided against investigating Trump University.

DREAMers were brought to this country as children—some of them so young, they don’t remember it—and holding up their futures by not working with us on a solution to DACA won’t do anything to solve our broken immigration system.
Right now hundreds of thousands of young people are deferring their dreams of finishing college, becoming a doctor, buying a home, raising a family, starting a small business, or serving in our military because President Trump pulled the plug on the DACA program months ago.

I believe, anyone who is qualified should have the opportunity to serve our country, and anyone who wears our uniform to defend our freedoms deserves nothing but our country’s support and respect.
Nothing is more important than keeping our nation and families safe, and President Trump’s reckless decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military needlessly undermines our national security and values.

Our work last fall showed that we can reach agreement when we put aside partisan politics and focused on what’s best for families—and I’m ready to get back to work as soon as Republicans are.
We are not far from an agreement, I still think we can get there, and I hope Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting the amendment I am offering today—and that even if they don’t, I hope we can get back to the table and resume talks.
The bill I’m putting forward would take strong steps to lower premiums and make health care more affordable for patients—and it would uphold protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as so many Republicans and Democrats have said we should.
I’m laying out what I hope Republicans &amp; Democrats will ultimately be able to agree on—a bill that includes current-law prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion—what Democrats and Republicans agreed was acceptable just months ago.
I am extremely disappointed that we have reached this point—but that does not mean I am giving up on getting this done. I know many Rs have said this is the end of the road for bipartisan negotiations on health care—but if it is, that’s only because they have chosen that route.
Senate Republicans have opted instead to surprise Democrats with a new, last-minute partisan so-called “stabilization” bill—one that included poison bills Republicans knew Democrats would never agree to.
Democrats have been at the table and we're still at the table ready to do what we can to stabilize markets and lower families’ health care costs.
Right now Republicans are trying to pass a partisan plan that would hurt women &amp; patients. I’m heading to the Senate floor to urge them to return to the table and work with Democrats to do what patients and families want: strengthen health care &amp; lower their costs next year. -PM
I am still at the table ready to keep negotiating toward a solution and I hope my Republican colleagues will reconsider and join me to get a health care deal done for patients and families.
I've worked, for months, across the aisle on legislation to help bring down premiums and undo some of the Republican health care sabotage we've seen over the last year.
It’s deeply frustrating that this week, at the last minute, Republican leaders chose to go to their partisan corner &amp; put forward their own, harmful bill that would hurt people w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; impose extreme, new restrictions on women's access to safe, legal abortion

Republican leaders were unwilling to get this done for patients and families once again, but I’m going to keep working to get Republicans back to the table to work with us on health care policies that actually help deliver what people want: lower health care costs.
It’s unfortunate Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan have time and time again rejected bipartisan work on health care in favor of partisan health care politics, and chosen politically-driven show votes over getting a result for families.
With the strong support of Democratic leadership in both chambers, I’ve worked with Republicans for months in good faith to try to negotiate a bipartisan agreement to lower health care costs and restore much-needed stability to health care in our country.

Republicans have pushed us into two government shutdowns this year, but I am very hopeful that we can work together to avoid that now. We are so close to getting this done.

@BetsyDeVosED I am hoping that Secretary DeVos gets a handle on this issue and changes her tune, but based on this meeting today, I have no confidence that President Trump’s  commission on school safety will be anything other than a tool for continued distraction and delay.
@BetsyDeVosED Sec. DeVos pushed back and asked for continued delay when I suggested that we start by quickly addressing the most common sense gun safety policies supported by the vast majority of Americans—like universal background checks and raising the age for purchasing assault weapons.
@BetsyDeVosED In fact, Sec. DeVos told me that the only people on President Trump’s commission on gun safety would be federal officials.
@BetsyDeVosED .@BetsyDeVosED couldn’t tell me how quickly the commission would move, or give me any kind of clear timeline at all. She wouldn’t agree to put survivors of gun violence, families of victims, or experts on preventing gun violence on the commission.
@BetsyDeVosED While Secretary DeVos said she had no interest in meeting with the NRA as a part of this process, she couldn’t or wouldn’t tell me how the NRA would be allowed to influence the commission’s recommendations, or even that they wouldn’t have veto power.
@BetsyDeVosED I was hoping Sec. DeVos would to talk to me about real, meaningful steps she could move quickly on, but everything I heard from her suggested this is just the latest effort to delay and shift the conversation away from the gun safety reforms people are demanding nationwide.

The @NEAarts and @NEHgov support vibrant artists and works that enrich so many lives and make our nation a cultural touchstone for the world. That legacy deserves continued bipartisan support against President Trump's proposed cuts.
Dreamers are the embodiment of so much of what this country was founded upon &amp; today we have a new chance to finally fix our broken immigration system for Dreamers in WA &amp; nationwide who call our country home.
Or Dreamers like one Pasco, WA resident who was 4 when he was flown to the U.S. Years later, after he enrolled in DACA, he was able to quit working in manual labor &amp; start a new job as a personal banker. 		Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers have a similar story.
DREAMers like Jose Manuel, who grew up in South Seattle—&amp; didn’t know he wasn’t a natural-born citizen until he went to get a driver’s license. 		Thanks to DACA, Jose Manuel was able to graduate from @UW, start a tech business, &amp; volunteer at local non-profits.
Who are Dreamers? Dreamers are determined, passionate, &amp; American in every way except on paper. 		They are fighting for the only lives they’ve ever known. 		They are fighting for their loved ones with everything they’ve got—and they are trying to do it the right way.
To start, Dreamers—thousands of our friends &amp; neighbors, teachers &amp; firefighters, servicemembers &amp; students—are not criminals, MS-13 gang members, nor are they a drain on our economy.
Finding a bipartisan path forward to both secure our borders and protect the futures of so many hardworking families is why we are here. 		Creating a more perfect union is why we are here.		First though, we must agree to some basic truths:
As the Senate opens up debate on immigration, heading down to the floor to urge my colleagues to come together &amp; find a bipartisan solution to protect Dreamers.
It was nice to hear an honest answer from OMB Dir. Mulvaney in the budget hearing today. I asked if he would vote for President Trump’s budget if he were in Congress, and he said that he wouldn’t. That’s one thing we agree on! –PM
Murray challenges OMB Director Mulvaney on deficit/debt hypocrisy: “You called yourself a deficit hawk..you don’t even try to hold yourself to the standard you held President Obama to.”
“But Director Mulvaney—this is anything but a normal budget and Budget Committee hearing."
“If this were a normal Budget Committee hearing, I may even praise some of the attention that is finally being paid to tackling our opioids crisis.”
“If this were a normal budget committee hearing I’d point out some serious concerns with the Administration’s request for veterans’ care.”
“If this were a normal Budget Committee hearing, I would point out how absurd it is to cut $200 billion in financial aid for college while students are already struggling to afford college and keep their heads above the water.”
“If this were a normal Budget Committee hearing, I would point out that it is wildly misguided and simply wrong to ask low-income families, and workers who need a hand up to bear the brunt of massive cuts.”
“If this were a normal Budget Committee hearing, I would point out that the so-called immigration proposals it includes are wasteful and divisive.”
"If this were a normal Budget hearing, I would start off by commenting that budgets are statements of values and priorities—and digging into what various proposals said about what kind of country we were, and what kind of country we wanted to be”
Murray at Budget Committee hearing: This is not a normal budget!

It’s shameful that the Trump administration continues to prioritize Big Oil &amp; the relentless pursuit of profit over the interest of Washington state families, despite years of fact-finding &amp; public input establishing the need to protect our ecologically-sensitive coasts.
Not only is the Trump Administration’s move to open WA’s coasts to dangerous oil &amp; gas drilling completely unnecessary—it flies in the face of what’s in the best interest of WA families &amp; w/o regard to what it may mean for our environment, public health, or economy.
Proud to join my colleagues to send a clear message to @SecretaryZinke &amp; @Interior: our coastal waters are too important to our environment &amp; economy to risk the dangers posed by expanded oil &amp; gas drilling.

The same president who promised “law and order” has lashed out against Special Counsel Mueller, worked to discredit our agencies of law and order, and continues to sow doubt about the media that dares report the facts.
The same president who promised to put “America First” has failed to live up to the most basic duty of defending our elections and enforcing congressional actions to punish Russian meddling.
That’s not an opinion, it’s not a partisan statement—it’s a fact. https://t.co/mame0b8W70
More than a year ago, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia interfered in the last U.S. presidential election—calling Russia’s meddling a “significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort” compared to previous attempts.

The way we finance higher education by asking everyone to take on debt is sending a clear message that college is for the wealthy—not the students who have the most to gain. https://t.co/G3ohqIZgaS
There are so many reasons why college has gotten so expensive, but the results remain the same. Student debt stops people from buying houses, starting families, opening their own businesses, and continuing their education.

A few weeks back I asked my followers to tweet out their photos of our WA shores to help show @SecretaryZinke why our PNW coasts are worth protecting from his proposal to expand potentially harmful offshore oil &amp; gas drilling—the response was overwhelming: https://t.co/xWy0SLKOfU
There are some people in this Administration who see this as a good political issue to talk about—but it needs to be more than that—we need to actually work together to address and put resources behind the Family and Medical Leave Act. #FMLA25

I’d like to think that after almost half a century we could move on from debating this settled issue. There is no one qualified to interfere with decisions that a woman has the Constitutional right to make on her own. https://t.co/kONR982xSY
This investigation isn’t about politics—this is about the integrity of our elections, our national security, and our standing around the world. No one should stand in the way of a thorough investigation.
As I’ve said from the outset, it is critical that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is able to continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead—without threats or intimidation, and with all the resources he needs—so the American people get the full explanation they deserve.
This partisan exercise is not only self-serving &amp; extraordinarily reckless, it’s deeply damaging to the public’s faith in our institutions &amp; to the men and women who go to work every day to keep us safe from harm. President Trump’s complicity in this release is disgraceful.
The American people deserve the truth about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, and they deserve to have confidence that their government is committed to preventing such interference from a foreign power ever happening again.
I join my colleagues in saying that using the Nunes Memo as pretext to fire Rosenstein or Mueller would be viewed as an attempt to obstruct justice and would cause a Constitutional crisis.
This isn’t about transparency, this is just another attempt to undermine and discredit the Russia investigation, Deputy AG Rosenstein, and the hard-working men &amp; women of the FBI — and another attempt to protect President Trump.

While WA families wait on Republicans in Congress to renew funding for community health centers &amp; figure out a bipartisan solution to protect DREAMers, President Trump seems more concerned w touting his tax cuts for wealthy families &amp; huge corporations. https://t.co/yQq3t7Q0R9
DREAMers work, eat, sleep, shop, worship, raise families, protect our streets &amp; live their lives as Americans—and our country is made stronger by their contributions to our communities. 		We must protect DREAMers w everything we’ve got—our neighbors &amp; nation are counting on it.
This is a stark example of how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to pad the pockets of business interests at the expense of workers. https://t.co/eAkIgqzvBt
Now that their real priorities have been exposed, President Trump should tell Secretary Acosta to abandon this effort immediately.
This botched cover-up of evidence proving President Trump’s policies help businesses steal billions from workers shows exactly what President Trump truly cares about: helping those at the top squeeze every last penny from families trying as hard as they can to get ahead. https://t.co/31MY9LKnKJ
In WA, the @EPA has helped clean up Puget Sound, supported critical salmon restoration efforts &amp; promoted clean air and water programs across the state—just for starters. 		WA families &amp; businesses can’t afford President Trump’s cuts to the EPA. https://t.co/YjJAHjufHN
Last night, President Trump didn’t mention women once during his historically long #SOTU speech. An interesting approach given the year he has spent pushing his anti-woman agenda. https://t.co/9G59kkGggU
Families in Puerto Rico still have a long and difficult recovery ahead of them. This Republican-led Congress must include disaster funding in a spending bill and help our neighbors in hurricane-ravaged areas get back on their feet. https://t.co/nXqB0FhA9F
I repeatedly raised concerns about Fitzgerald’s conflicts of interest and broad recusals from work impacting public health issues like cancer and opioids—this is yet another example of this Administration’s dysfunction and questionable ethics. https://t.co/Av8H3pKgdY
I may not agree with President Trump’s assessment of where we are as a nation or where we should go, I remain hopeful and energized by the millions of people across the country who are fighting for something better. #SOTU https://t.co/6bVJsPwKwB
I hope that this next year can be spent bringing Republicans and Democrats together to restore respect and get results, in spite of President Trump’s bullying, divisiveness, and anti-middle class agenda. #SOTU
President Trump has spent his first year in office breaking the promises he made during his campaign, so it’s hard to take his new promises today too seriously. #SOTU
Reminder: President Trump promised to address the opioid crisis, but has repeatedly failed to identify any additional funding to battle the opioid epidemic. #SOTU
$25 billion could construct 11,000 water projects to repair and upgrade drinking water and sewer systems nationwide, and create more than 500,000 construction jobs. #BuildABetterAmerica #SOTU
Instead of President Trump’s wall, we could invest $25 billion to combat the #opioid epidemic, improve our schools, and repair our infrastructure. #SOTU
We need to be creating good, American jobs while addressing our nation’s aging infrastructure, not finding another excuse to line the pockets of big businesses &amp; the ultra-wealthy &amp; rolling back critical clean water and labor standards that keep families and workers safe. #SOTU
Let me be clear: If Trump’s version of infrastructure investment is simply a cover for privatization, increasing costs on the backs of American families, cutting vital programs, and undermining good middle class jobs, then we will fight it every step of the way. #SOTU
President Trump promised to improve health care, but instead has sabotaged it at every opportunity and undermined care for millions across the country. #SOTU
When President Trump asks "How's your 401k?" does he know nearly half our families don't have a retirement account? We need solutions to help them plan for the future, not empty words. #SOTU
Let’s not forget that those tax cuts for massive corporations are permanent, while working families get just crumbs that last only a few years. #SOTU https://t.co/ikHZVbfpAo
The tax plan that Republicans and President Trump jammed through Congress gave massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, biggest corporations, President Trump, his family, and the vast majority of his cabinet. #SOTU
Despite President Trump's campaign promises to put workers' first, too many workers have not seen wages go up and still have to work two or three jobs just to get by. #SOTU
What the President Trump wont mention in the #SOTU:	- He made it easier for corporations to put workers' lives &amp; safety at risk	- He stripped millions of workers overtime pay	- He wants to allow employers to steal workers' tips
President Trump may be proud of his work over the past year, but I know the vast majority of people in Washington state and across the country are appalled by his rhetoric and his policies—and they want a change. #SOTU
Leah’s courageous story speaks to so many who have turned their pain into inspiring advocacy—so proud to have her with me at tonight’s State of the Union address and share her powerful story. https://t.co/Zj9WDNQ3go
One year into Trump's Administration, it's very clear that our country is more divided, more chaotic, and less safe for workers, women, and the middle class. But it’s a whole lot better for millionaires, billionaires, and massive corporations. #SOTU
What President wont mention in the #SOTU:	- He made it easier for corporations to put workers' lives &amp; safety at risk	- He stripped millions of workers' overtime pay	- He wants to allow employers to steal workers' tips
Honored to have Leah Griffin as my guest at the State of the Union address. She’s a brave individual who turned her own painful experience into a personal mission to make sure that others who experience sexual violence have the resources they deserve when they seek help. #SOTU https://t.co/p71pkU2SJH
Keeping WA’s ecosystem healthy is critically important to our families, communities &amp; businesses. 		Meanwhile, President Trump’s continued efforts to squeeze the @EPA’s budget could potentially limit its capacity to keep our environment safe. #SOTU https://t.co/YjJAHjufHN
When DREAMers speak, we owe it to them to listen to their courageous stories of sacrifice &amp; overcoming obstacles. They’re risking everything—everything—to take part of our shared American Dream. #DefendDACA
Our communities should not be uncertain about whether the health centers they rely on can keep operating. It’s time for Republicans to work with us on a long-term funding solution to give certainty to these centers and the families they serve. https://t.co/SYmrBdxjD3
Hundreds of thousands of young people are counting on this Republican-led Congress to work out a permanent solution that will let them live their lives in the only country they know as home. So much is a stake for them, their families &amp; our country—we can’t let them down.
Community &amp; teaching health centers from Longview to Spokane are waiting for this Republican-led Congress to renew critical funding, but Republicans are more interested in debating whether women or politicians should make women’s health decisions. https://t.co/urlqEJaKI2
Republicans in Congress say that they want to protect DREAMers &amp; other young people who came to the US as children, but have yet to join us at the table to find a solution. This should have been done by now. #DefendDACA
In recent months, brave survivors like Leah have helped shine a light on a problem that deeply impacts so many women &amp; communities. Honored to have Leah join me at tonight’s State of the Union address as we work to end sexual violence &amp; assault. https://t.co/Zj9WDNysoQ
We cannot allow schools colleges to close the door on the students who have the most to gain from higher education simply because they may face additional challenges than their more advantaged peers.
In short, students should be better off—not worse off—after enrolling in college. https://t.co/227ECP5HYd
We must look at all the challenges in higher ed, including:	✓ the rising costs of college;	✓ providing access to higher ed to everyone who wants it;	✓ ensuring students are able to learn in a safe environment;	✓ and preparing students for success after college.
This should go w/o saying, but DREAMers &amp; other young people who were brought to this country as children are American in nearly every way &amp; make invaluable contributions to our communities—it would be cruel &amp; foolish to turn our backs on them now. #DefendDACA
Stories like Leah’s are powerful examples of how so many have turned pain &amp; anger into inspiring advocacy to make our world better. So proud to stand w Leah &amp; have her as my guest at tomorrow’s #SOTU address. https://t.co/pNPnQSYP6o
It’s shameful that Republicans control the Senate &amp; House and have yet to reverse President Trump’s reckless decision to end DACA, leaving the futures of hundreds of thousands of young people twisting in the wind. That’s not leadership—that’s negligence. #DefendDACA
Republicans dragged their feet instead of renewing funding for community health centers while families in WA &amp; nationwide wonder if they’ll still be able to get the care they need. 		Congressional Republicans need to fix this—and time is running out. https://t.co/Fcucg6EBuW
It won’t be easy, but we can find a bipartisan solution that allows our friends, neighbors &amp; loved ones who are American in every way but on paper to stay in the only home they’ve known. It's time to put people over politics &amp; get this done. #DefendDACA
Republicans should know I'll keep fighting for Judy and so many other women. And I'll keep urging them to work w/ us on the serious challenges our nation faces—none of which, by the way, have to do with trusting women or controlling their health care choices.​ #NoAbortionBan https://t.co/ympPyZrvf2

President Trump &amp; Republicans have said they will protect DREAMers &amp; other young people who’ve only known America as home. We must all hold them to their word—and hold them accountable at the ballot box if they don’t honor it.

Now that Republicans have stepped back from their completely unnecessary government shutdown and say they are ready to work with us on responsible solutions—we need to tackle them together, right now, without delay.
There’s no excuse for leaving families wondering whether their local health center will shut its doors, or leaving medical residents who want to help underserved communities in limbo. https://t.co/M89NIuxkHm
I'm glad we were able to pass an extension of CHIP, but we need to work together to make sure patients and families who rely on community health centers, teaching health centers, and other critical health investments can continue to get the care they need.
I'm glad Republican leaders have committed to working with us to deliver on some of the challenges facing the families we represent. But in the coming weeks people will be looking to action—and true bipartisan work—not just words.
While it’s good that Republican leaders were able to keep the lights on for a few more weeks, to be very clear—we need to do a whole lot more than the bare minimum.
We should be increasing transparency and access to data around graduate earnings. These are common sense steps to help students choose a degree that leaves them with more opportunity rather than more debt. https://t.co/Ob6JzqMt5v

This has been a year of chaos and dysfunction. Of bullying and attacks. Of hatred, division, controversy, and crises.#TrumpShutdown

I’m heading to the Senate Floor to call on Republicans to end this Trump Shutdown—and work with Democrats to actually solve the problems we face. -PM
This shutdown is a choice made by Republicans—the Party that controls the Senate, the House, and the White House. It is a choice made through their inaction—months and months of refusing to work with Democrats.
This government shutdown will impact the way that people nationwide have access to the care they need. https://t.co/qq1PQbSqpg
We have spent months and months—and really, years and years—pushing Republicans to work with us to protect the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers across the country.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to increase investments in education, health care, and other domestic and defense priorities.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass support for our veterans—to combat opioid and substance use disorder.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass disaster relief for the families and communities who have been hit so hard.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass funding for community health centers that so many families depend on.
We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass a long-term extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program that gives millions of kids access to care.
On the heels of so much utter dysfunction and disarray coming from this Republican government—it is fitting, even while deeply disappointing, that President Trump’s first year has ended with him pushing our country into a completely unnecessary #Trumpshutdown
It was just one year ago that President Trump was sworn into office promising the American people that he that he would break through the gridlock to get results for workers and families. #TrumpShutdown

This weekend is the anniversary of the #WomensMarch, and as I’m in the other Washington fighting the Trump shutdown, seeing so many pictures from family and friends at marches this year is inspiring. Here’s one of mine from last year—can you share yours from this weekend? https://t.co/6s92Z8yaEP
This shutdown will impact families &amp; communities in WA &amp; nationwide if it's not ended quickly--it's time for Republicans to put people and families above partisanship and politics.
Now that Republicans have shut down the government, I am going to be doing everything I can to persuade the Republican majority to reopen the government and get to work with us.
Instead of working with us to get a result, President Trump and Republican leaders who control the House and Senate were more focused on pointing fingers and playing political games.
This is no way to run the government and no way to treat families looking to Congress for solutions, not dysfunction and uncertainty. #TrumpShutdown
One year ago, millions and millions of people across the country stood up at Women’s Marches nationwide to make clear that we were going to fight back against President Trump and his agenda https://t.co/8PdEeB8OXU
I am hopeful Republican leaders hear from the people they represent and reconsider this deeply damaging approach.
Now, here we are, on the brink of a crisis and they are more focused on playing politics than on working with us. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/RovXrYCRr4
Reminder: Republicans spent the last months of 2017 jamming tax breaks through for the wealthiest few, rather than working with Democrats to get real results.
President’s latest action to appease his extreme, right-wing base will deny women &amp; men basic care they need &amp; it's a direct attack on a woman’s constitutionally protected right to access safe, legal abortion care &amp; make her own choices about her own body. https://t.co/PW0f5pUtnL
Hours away from a potential Republican government shutdown, The Trump Administration is working to take health care away from millions of patients and undermine women’s reproductive rights, instead of doing even the bare minimum to keep the doors of government open. https://t.co/x5gepUmD1q
We are running out of time, but it’s not too late. https://t.co/CUOhDrh0Kt
I am at the table and ready to get to work with anyone, from any Party, who is willing to work with those of us truly interested in getting results and passing legislation that keeps our government open and addresses the critical challenges facing our children and families.
Republicans and President Trump have pushed us from one short-term spending bill to the next. And now they are pushing us to the brink of a crisis. They’re more focused on playing politics than on working with us to get results.
Republican leaders have spent months refusing to work with Democrats on a long-term extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. They have blocked every effort to protect DREAMers in Washington state and across the country.
Democrats have made it clear we want to keep the government open to continue negotiations and reach a good result. If Republicans reject that and shut down the government, they'll be held accountable by people who will be paying the price for GOP dysfunction. #TrumpShutdown
There is absolutely no reason for the Republicans who control government to shut it down, and I am hoping they reverse course and work with us—today—to prevent that.
Reminder: Republicans spent the last year sabotaging health care &amp; twisting arms to pass a massive giveaway to billionaire families &amp; corporations—at the expense of working people—while they could have been passing legislation to fully-fund CHIP.
We shouldn't even be having this discussion. President Trump &amp; Republicans have said before that they support fully-funding CHIP &amp; protecting young people from deportation who have lived almost their entire lives in the US. https://t.co/rIrMb0Vy7R

We need sweeping improvements to federal financial aid so student loan servicers are held accountable and students know where to go for help, that repayment is simple, and relief is within reach.
Far too many students are held back from even applying to schools because it is simply not affordable. Navigating our complex financial aid system can be overwhelming— especially for first generation students.
We should reduce barriers facing students at every stage of financial aid: before they apply, while they’re enrolled, &amp; after graduation.
But navigating the financial aid process &amp; the student loan repayment system are just some of the many challenges students are facing. https://t.co/CzcU0CMmQR

We need to respond to global health crises abroad before they travel home. Diseases are not stopped by borders, or walls, or bans.
The United States should continue to show our international partners that we are focused on these issues &amp; will be their ally in preparing for &amp; addressing public health threats.
We need decisions based in science and expert medical opinion, not ideology—especially when it comes to women’s health and proven solutions like vaccines.
When it comes to preparing for global health crises, we need to stop fear &amp; uncertainty before they create panic by getting families helpful &amp; accurate information from trusted sources.
All 49 Senate Democrats have taken a stand to protect a free &amp; open internet. With just one more Republican’s support, we could start the process of rolling back @FCC’s reckless decision &amp; ensure that the internet remains free &amp; open to all. #NetNeutrality
Washingtonians of every stripe have raised their voices against the Trump Administration’s repeated attempts to turn public goods into more money-making opportunities for the largest corporations. @FCC’s vote to change the internet as we know it is no exception. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/PVEqoSp8S9
The Trump Administration’s attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency are outrageous and an affront to future generations. As a voice for WA, I’m proud to fight to #SaveEPA. https://t.co/e7Mk2AED65
.@FCC’s backward decision to reverse internet protections for consumers is as shameful and wrong today as it was last December. Proud to stand w fellow Democrats to protect a free &amp; open internet. https://t.co/x8OMchgu5Q
Students cannot learn if they don’t feel safe. @EDcivilrights should be working to ensure all students can feel safe at school, but instead they are dismissing the students who need them the most. https://t.co/4xGCdwFP2P
After a year of President Trump’s repeated sabotage, it’s concerning but unsurprising to learn that fewer families have insurance and the ability to get the health care they so badly need. https://t.co/Iqbt6hL9UR
The Trump Administration needs to stand up for the students who are being bullied and discriminated against every day. https://t.co/4xGCdwoebh
"An estimated half of all college students struggle with food insecurity." 		Higher education has a problem: too many students leave heavy on debt and light on nutrition. This has to change. https://t.co/9dT4m9Zu59
Today, as we honor and celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy, we must remember the work ahead and recommit to fighting for equality and justice for everyone. https://t.co/ut9njM9t4F
