@SenatorDurbin Not all drugs come in through ports of entry.  This proves nothing except some smugglers are stupid.  Don't put meaning into something that probably is not true.  Support our president.  Start acting like my representative in DC.
@RepDeanPhillips Only if you eliminate early voting.
@Ilhan The ban must stand.  Muslims only want to take over the world.  It has nothing to do with God or love.  It is only about hating women and anyone that does not believe what they do.  YOU should be banned from Congress...

@SenatorDurbin The problem I see here is as soon as the shutdown is fixed the demorats will continue to not negotiate.
@PatVPeters I agree.  Deport all of them, legal and illegal. Their only reason for being here is to dominate us, enslave us, or kill us.  If you don't believe me, read the Koran.
@StopBigMoney not a chance
@SenatorDurbin You know as well as I that President Trump ending the shutdown will not silve the problem.  Pelosi and Schumer will not negotiate the issue.  The rest of the democrats need to push them to fund the wall....
@bennyjohnson Chewing her cud?
@SenatorDurbin And that's exactly where all the drugs come through,  the legal ports of entry. duh.  What kind of stupid do you think the  Americans  are?
@PatVPeters You just figured that out?  You might want to read the Koran.
@IlhanMN @AyannaPressley Yes, and they too can have their feminine parts mutilated, and then be beat by theie master.
@SenatorDurbin Thats right, so tell your buddies Schumer and Pelosito write the bill to pay for the wall.  You know the only reasno they are beingthe jerks is because Trump is the President, and not Clinton.
Doesn't make sense. https://t.co/horsrLKG9M
@FLAkryptonight @jjauthor @AlwaysActions I agree.  I one does not agree this statement, the do not know anything about the "religion" called islam.
@SenatorDurbin See.  The Dumbacrats are only thinking about their own pockets and not our nations security and safety.
Arrest them.  If they take down the rest of D.C. , so be it.  That would be great for the USA. https://t.co/tqx8QrsfVb
