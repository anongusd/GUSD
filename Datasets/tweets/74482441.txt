Over 600,000 more Georgians were registered to vote in 2016 than in 2012. @HillaryClinton says that's a DECREASE. She lost an election and just can't accept it. #gapol https://t.co/QGlrDWXRKI
More excuses and lies from @HillaryClinton that even the Washington Post says aren’t true. #gapol https://t.co/iyrVH5ql6Z
2012: 3,897,839 Georgians voted. 		2016: 4,092,373 Georgians voted. 		Today: More Georgians are registered to vote than ever before. 		@HillaryClinton is (again) not telling the truth. #gapol https://t.co/kVERlurLx0
Yet another example of Washington Democrats using taxpayer money to prop up failed candidate Stacey Abrams and her false narrative. #gapol  https://t.co/h2OIDDwoJK
“Mr. Ritter was visibly disappointed that the violations we uncovered related to the Abrams campaign and directed us not to proceed." #gapol https://t.co/lMWOrK7ZSN

Strong turnout tonight at #SOTU watch parties throughout Georgia in support of successful policies and @realDonaldTrump, not the false narrative of #AnyJobAbrams. #MAGA #LeadRight https://t.co/0KUcn3ZUK8
Our President is committed to fueling the economy, defending our borders, and protecting our citizens. #AnySeatAbrams is committed to finding a job for herself.  #SocialistStacy #MAGA #SOTU
Curious about what #AnySeatAbrams stands for? Check out this short clip from @NRSC to see how the agenda of #SocialistStacey Abrams mirrors that of the radicals she was chosen by to give the Dems’ #SOTU response. #SchumerSidekick https://t.co/HnAO32to2b
In tonight's #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump will talk about results that have turned America around. Schumer &amp; Pelosi picked Stacey Abrams to give the response, but GA has already rejected her radical agenda. When will #SourGrapesStacey take the hint? #MAGA #LeadRight #gapol https://t.co/sC4AmhtFXx
Excited about #SuperBowl2019? #BigScreenStacey is excited about staying in the spotlight and spreading a false narrative. More Georgians are registered to vote than ever before and they voted against Stacey Abrams. Perhaps it’s time for Abrams to stay on the sideline. #gapol https://t.co/lXXmnpo4tJ
