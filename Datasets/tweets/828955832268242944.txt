It's Thursday and there really isn't a lot of good news yet, but the day is still young. #Congress continues towards another #GovernmentShutdown. For a great read on the impact of shutdowns on #OSHA see https://t.co/xnSFhcXsMp. Also no date set for a vote for Scott Mugno. @jbarab
The @WhiteHouse is now saying that @realDonaldTrump's #budget request to #Congress for FY 2019 won't be issued until February 12 or later. The delay is said to be caused by the #GovernmentShutdown. This was expected, but it could further delay Congress' work on #funding bills.
Everyone should read this. Leaving aside the wage issue, which @AIHA doesn't get into, here's a key quote from the article: from 2005 to 2015 "all net job growth in the American economy has been in contingent jobs." Let's remember to #protect these #workers in this new #economy! https://t.co/GzBmeDl2Yj
