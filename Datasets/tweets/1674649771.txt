@Liz4syth @Politics442 @RudyGiuliani @GOP I get so infuriated when people say it didn't happen if she doesn't remember! You don't forget something like that! YES some people do!

@Liz4syth @Politics442 @RudyGiuliani @GOP Mine was exactly 20yrs ago &amp; I remember bits &amp; pieces! The mind has a way of protecting us from trauma! Molestation/rape victims have completely blocked the entire incident &amp; it's been proven that this is the brains way of protecting them! No memory doesn't mean it didn't happen!

@EBGarrett1975 @gopherkiller2 @pattonoswalt @LindseyGrahamSC Now you're adding words to what I said!	I do entertain myself plenty! I'm a full-time working mom! I have plenty to entertain me &amp; rarely get a chance to sit!	But that doesn't mean people, including myself, don't enjoy/need the laughs from a comedian or suspense of a drama!
@gopherkiller2 @pattonoswalt @LindseyGrahamSC As much as you may hate it.... Entertainers bring us happiness, they help us escape, &amp; they remind us of things that have happened! 	We need entertainers!	What we don't need is trolls who go on someone's posts just to be hateful! Life is hard enough without haters like you!
@gopherkiller2 @pattonoswalt @LindseyGrahamSC Well I have! I've needed them when I needed to escape after having my ankle severely sprained but my kids father wouldn't take me to the get medical attention because he tried to break it! I've needed them when I've been sad to cheer me up! After a long day &amp; to put me to sleep!

I watch mostly old 90s sitcoms &amp; it's appalling to see how much the products have shrank in size yet the prices keep going up!
@makk1123 @realDonaldTrump Sadly I fear this time it'll be a full blown depression! The way things are going it's inevitable it will crash! It can't go up forever! Wtf aren't they looking for a way to level it out &amp; make it stable? Because they're greedy... That's right! Screwing over Americans once again!
@SirJohnSteele @baldyriek @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Then of course the banks going meant many companies &amp; businesses were going to crash too! So LOTS of people lost their jobs &amp; couldn't pay for the new house they'd just bought! It's not the people's fault that the banks got greedy! Or that businesses closed/went bankrupt!
@SirJohnSteele @baldyriek @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman This has to be one of the craziest things I've EVER read;	Americans buying homes is apart of the American dream! The BANKS are the ones that got in over their heads &amp; W Bush knew about it all before it happened! Yet he did NOTHING...  Except bail them out with our money!
@ruseDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump You forgot....	New Presidential rally walkouts being set also!!!!	LMFAO 😂 😂 😂 😂😂 😂😂 😂😂 😂
@M1GrandRedneck @ThePrinceofSha1 @realDonaldTrump Can none of you think of anything original? Is everything you say/type stolen from others &amp; just regurgitated to fit your delusion? Wtf is wrong with you people? Not ONE single original thought! 	Also there can NOT be a red wave when they're the majority! PLEASE pick up a book!
@jackmeh4012 @ThePrinceofSha1 @realDonaldTrump Wtf do you see Obama trying to take credit for it? Please find me a link!!	Do you not remember who put us in a recession? REPUBLICAN W Bush! If not for Obama we'd have been in a full blown depression like in the 1930s! He SAVED us! Not this orange arsehat! Pick up a history book!
@ThePrinceofSha1 @realDonaldTrump I absolutely LOVE how this recognizes Obama as president but not djt!!!! Glad to see I'm not the only one unable to put those 2 words together! LMFAO 😂 😂😂 😂😂 😂😂 😂
RT @LibGranny: @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. How much is it going to cost to repurchase our morality and reputation.
@realDonaldTrump Why??? Are you bribing the statisticians like you are the GOP? Or is Russia? 	What goes up must come down! When it crashes it will be ALL your fault, unlike the rise in our economy for the last 8yrs! 	Obama won't be able to rescue us AGAIN!
@Cruellaisdevine Glad to hear you escaped this state! Any tips for me? I have a daughter starting college this January &amp; a son who's a sophomore.... I don't want them staying here! He has his 20yrs in the army this December &amp; I'm wanting to move once he gets that retirement package!

The only justice I got was them beating the shit out of him &amp; then tossing him down the apartment stairs to the front door while my friend comforted me! I didn't say what happened cause I didn't have to! I was never allowed by myself again after that no matter where we went!
He told me to follow him to the bathroom to write my number down on toilet paper! I went in to grab the paper &amp; he closed the door &amp; locked it! I was a virgin that night &amp; lost my innocence! When I came out of that bathroom my best friend &amp; group of guy friends knew!
How do you report shame, disgust, feeling you did something wrong? I was 16 an Irish Catholic girl at a New Year's Eve party in 1999 with a mom who said sex is evil! I was terrified! I had crushed on the guy for a couple years! But I didn't expect him to do this #WhyIDidntReport

@realDonaldTrump The FBI is comprised of normal people dedicated to protecting America, the Constitution, &amp; our democracy!

@DevinNunes It's going to stay dark til Trump, you &amp; the rest of the treasonous traitors are handcuffed &amp;  lead off to prison!

Not unrelated articles from random opinion sites! Only proven facts! No deferring to Hillary or Obama either! I've been more than nice! I'll challenge you to think logically, about your reasons!
@Nvablejrg @JMS20051 @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Oh I'll take the bait! W/O a meme explain how I'm a liberal!	FYI: I'm not a liberal, Democrat, Republican, or affiliated with any party! I'm for my country &amp; it's Constitution! I'm for protecting children! I'm for our military members getting  healthcare &amp; benefits they deserve!
@Nvablejrg @JMS20051 @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Please show me where I have been hateful to you! I don't care if you support Trump! Go ahead! But when asked to discuss your reasons you lashed out with angry insults! I can't understand how asking for a discussion is turned into my telling you who you can or cant support!
@Nvablejrg @JMS20051 @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Everyone is in Trump's pockets! Why else put so many unqualified individuals in positions of power if not as repayment! Only other reason would be he is oblivious to these positions demands, duties &amp; responsibilities &amp; just picked a friend! Either he's bought or ignorant! Pick 1!
@Nvablejrg @JMS20051 @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump I got it from your buddies previous post! LMFAO! You really should start reading &amp; listening to what's going on in the world! Your utter lack of education is only a disadvantage for you! I'm just trying to help you later in hate-filled berates on women smarter than you! https://t.co/WjPhgNjOHK
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump I took that meme from your post above! No one can really be that oblivious! I can't believe how demeaning belittling retorts are a defense mechanism for both your ineptitudes! Ask to discuss why you support Trump, I get Beavis &amp; Butthead high-fiving their stupidity! Focus guys!
I've been saying this since his campaign! Saying he's a danger to Americans because he has to profit, fulfill promised govt contracts, &amp; repay Russia for the loans from Putin's bank! Plus I'm sure he will fantasize he's a hero for helping the economy after he crashes it! Watch! https://t.co/np3achNEYQ
@vic78_Tp @TravisAllen02 @realDonaldTrump He's fulfilling a dream of his to have the power to command the entire US military throw a parade for him! While enticing NK to fire on us! Because an attack would benefit the GOP in the midterm elections according to Trump! So he has 9mo to kill Americans &amp; start a war to profit

@JMS20051 LMFAO 😂😂😂 I don't understand why you tagged me in this! I know exactly why! Trump is up shit creek without a paddle! Carter Page was working for the FBI! They have so much evidence against Trump proving he's been working with Russia &amp; Putin! Hence Jr's tantrum touting demands!
@JMS20051 Now here is my issue with the taxscam.... Trickle down economics does not work! It is a politicians way of giving his donors money for free with our tax dollars! So not only do we buy our goods from the store but then the store also gets our tax dollars too! So we pay twice!
@JMS20051 So even if he was responsible for record highs, then he's responsible when it all comes crashing down too! Because anyone with an iota of financial sense knows the stocks can't only trend upward! The faster they rise the harder they crash! Remember 2008? I do!
@JMS20051 So a president &amp; his constituents must devise a tax plan that will allow for a steady line of rises &amp; falls throughout their term, in order to obtain a steady economy! Most know what goes up must go down!
@JMS20051 Until he proposed a financial plan for taxes &amp; economic development he has not influenced our stocks or financial standing at all! He hadn't done anything yet to receive credit! 	Now here's where it gets complicated! Most can't predict the rise &amp; fall of stocks perfectly!
@JMS20051 So Trump's economic growth started when they passed the taxscam! Therefore January 2018 starts Trump's economic plan when their plan is implemented! Just like Obama's 1st year was all w. Bush, Trump's 1st year was still Obama's tax plan! Do you understand how this works?
@JMS20051 I must have missed where Hillary is the president! Trump was being looked at by the FBI before the dossier! Trump flaunted his Russian partners &amp; dealings on national television &amp; at publicly photographed events! Also this is a statement not proof!
@RealDNAdoc911 @CathyLuE827 @SenSanders Ask the businesses that trump hired, promised to pay for expensive materials &amp; labor for his buildings... Then refused payment! Destroying their business &amp; livelihood! Trump talking about fraud/crooks/treason is like Obama stating what it takes to be president! Takes 1 to know 1!
@TomiLahren @JMS20051 Accountability, responsibility, &amp; acknowledging fault are not morals any of you understand apparently! Lying is something you're well versed in but then throw tantrums when forced to confront your lies! You can't have your cake &amp; eat it too! Entitlement is an ugly shade!
@TomiLahren @JMS20051 Because if Trump knew wtf he was doing this drop wouldn't be occurring! His taxscam would have provided an economy that dips down &amp; rises up throughout the week! He was so eager to brag about something he didn't do! Now he can endure the truth of what is actually by his doing!
@JMS20051 Just to enlighten you further.... I'm neither a Democrat, liberal, Republican, or any party affiliation! I'm for the people of this country. Protecting our children, caring for elderly, &amp; the military men &amp; women getting what they more than deserve in pay, benefits, &amp; healthcare!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Also out of curiosity once again... What have I lied about? Please screenshot an example of me lying! I'll wait patiently! But I won't hold my breath! I know you can't support your stance once again! Even my profile pic &amp; bio is real! I don't tolerate liars or fakes! I'm too old!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump You should have posted this instead &amp; saved yourself the embarrassment of making my point for me! Then at least you wouldn't see how you've done the very thing I was proving couldn't be done! Once again thank you! I couldn't have done it without you! Bittersweet truth! https://t.co/zfKvDFAJb4
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Thank you for proving my point once again! I truly couldn't be more pleased in your responses! They've demonstrated exactly my point in asking for reasons in supporting Trump! That there are ZERO intelligent reasons! So I thank you again! I hope you have a wonderful day!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump A simple, open discussion! I can not fathom supporting a treasonous traitor that's destroying our country for personal gains &amp; to appease an enemy country that threatened to bomb us for years! Probably because I'm a patriotic American! The truth is never forgotten!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump I am a person with nothing to hide! Therefore I speak the truth, fight for my country's Constitution &amp; democracy, &amp; am willing to engage in a discussion about why someone supports Trump! Without all the childish, immature belittling you all seem so fond of using as defense!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Hence why his lawyers are not wanting him to meet with Mueller! They're afraid he will incriminate himself when he forgets all his lies or gets them mixed up! That his lack of intelligence(or arrogance) will be used against him to confuse him!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump Furthermore, I've dealt with pathological liars my entire life &amp; despise them! I live by the saying that Im not Willie Wonka! If you want sugar-coated BS go watch Fox news! I gain nothing in speaking the truth! So why wouldn't I? The biggest pathological liar is in the WH!
@JMS20051 @Nvablejrg @MamaRose2017 @TravisAllen02 @BennieThePooch @realDonaldTrump LMFAO 😂😂😂 I'm not the one lying to you sweetie! I can assure you that! But once again why can't I get a single intellectual response as to why they support Trump? Is it really that hard to find a legitimate reason? Then why do you support him? I'm genuinely intrigued!

Much like our neighborhoods! I grew up on the south side, our city is divided into north &amp; south end. South was the nice part with big houses &amp; the private schools. The north was drug infested, poor, dilapidated houses mostly rented out. Then there's Purdue campus &amp; west side.
I went to public school here. I didn't have any other races in my class until 5th grade. I befriended him &amp; we still talk on FB, he sings in CA! I played all the sports, a tomboy, &amp; got ribbons &amp; trophies in everything. But our schools were very segregated by boundaries.
I was born &amp; raised a Catholic Lafayette girl. I pretty much was raised by my grandparents since my so-called mother got pregnant &amp; then ghosted the guy. I was reading by age 3, kindergarten I was tested &amp; placed in challenge (now accelerated) classes. I was the class of 2000.
@ClintSmithIII This is infuriating! How a media news outlet could represent such violent, dangerous, destructive, senseless acts as "overzealous" is discredits their ability to be unbiased &amp; present facts! I'd say animalistic but even animals have a purpose when wreaking havoc! White privilege!

In 1997, when telling radio host Howard Stern that avoiding STD's was his "personal Vietnam." "It is a dangerous world out there. It’s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era,” Trump said to Stern, discussing his sex life. "I feel like a great and very brave soldier.”

Lastly I am not going to go away silently or passively allow anyone to be immorally dehumanized or oppressed in my country where all are welcome &amp; safe! We the people are here &amp; we're ready to protect what is great about our country! Immigrants! Minorities! Diversity! Freedom!
I am a woman! I am a mother! I am an Army wife! I am a DV &amp; CA survivor! I have PTSD! I am a mutt unsure of my entire lineal heritage! I am adopted! I am not religious! I am an AMERICAN! Hear me when I say.... We will keep fighting for democracy, the Constitution, &amp; our country!
I AM A full blooded patriotic American citizen fighting for those unable/afraid to fight for themselves! I will honor my military family by doing here what I couldn't do as a service member of our military! I will resist all forms of oppression, treason, &amp; attacks on my country!
So I will continue to speak out, march, protect our democracy &amp; our country's founding principles &amp; beliefs! I will demand the family unit of law abiding members of society be protected regardless of citizenship! I will fight for our rights &amp; freedoms to be informed &amp; protest!
This country has been ruined &amp; destroyed time &amp; time again by greedy white men in power, like yourself! Not by Mexican immigrants, black protesters, or Muslim refugees! Rich white men! I'm not going to passively watch you annihilate the very foundation of our country! Minorities!
It still continues today with silent, respectable protests like kneeling for the anthem.... The people you call Sons of Bitches &amp; demand be fired! Yet your white extremist supremacists, that are responsible for almost every mass shooting in America, were some very fine people???
Then they saw women standing up, protesting, demanding equality.. Blacks saw how they could finally get the human rights &amp; freedoms from hate, brutal beatings, injustice in the criminal system, freedom from discrimination, equality in society thus the Civil Rights movement began!
Those treasonous traitor losers then had statues in their honor all over the country to remind blacks of their place in society, to keep living in fear of a time when they weren't human beings! But rather property possessed &amp; controlled by the highest bidder! Vile fear tactics!
Then there were the southern Confederate traitors, who almost tore this country in two trying to keep their right to own human beings! While the Union fought for the freedom of slaves &amp; to keep their country as one! The treasonous act of fighting to destroy your own country!
When people are seen as less than human it is easier for people to ignore their cruel treatment, injustices towards them, &amp; indignities shown them! Exactly like what you have been doing to Muslims, minorities, LGBQT, women, &amp; non-citizen immigrants! We will not allow this happen!
Denying them an education, because it's easier to control the ignorant! They'd break their spirit with beatings &amp; inhumane treatment/conditions! Encourage others to see slaves as less than human due to their ignorance, illiteracy, physical features, &amp; different cultural customs!
Then if that wasn't horrific enough to an entire race of people, Africans were targeted next as slaves! Brought over on ships in deplorable conditions, to work for white men. Buying them like cattle at an auction! Denying them any rights or freedoms granted white immigrants!
Once NA could no longer fight for what was rightfully theirs, whites rounded them up &amp; used them as slaves or forced them to live on reservations the govt deemed worthless land! Promising if they lived on reservations no govt influence! Their land now destroyed by oil companies!
Haven't people of color suffered enough at the hands of white men? The native American genocide by greedy European nobility manipulated the poor with promises of gold laden soil. Indigents nearly eradicated an entire race for their purveyors, as agreed in hopes of a better life!
This country is for everyone wanting better in life! For everyone with a dream to live safe &amp; without war! To raise children that can go to school a few blocks away, not a town away!  Who desire the very basic human rights, that gave the pilgrims sanctuary &amp; hope!
You've destroyed the American Dream for those people, their families, &amp; the rest of us fighting for their right to stay! This country is not for your white only friends/families! As a quarter native, I could tell you to get the hell out of my country! Don't let my skin fool you!
This country was a refuge for those fleeing persecution for their religion! This was their only chance at freedom &amp; building a better life for their family! Yet you've completely destroyed the very foundation of our country by deporting law-abiding immigrants with families!
What have you or @GOP done to regain this way of life? You say "Make America Great Again" then implement plans/laws/bills against  the very founding principles that once made this country a beacon of hope for those willing to work for their dream! You've denied those with dreams!
Employers provided benefits cause healthy workers made for dedicated, lifelong employees! Employers knew that family was most important &amp; if an employees family was cared they would be more focused at work, with less absences! The family unit was the backbone of this country!
That a mom/dad could stay home or work part-time since the most important job was the children! While their SO worked full-time, received benefits that protected their family health &amp; assets as incentive for their hardwork &amp; dedication to their employer!
That is what is ruining this country! The socioeconomic divide between the rich &amp; poor was NEVER supposed to be this insanely far apart! This country was founded to ensure all could survive working 40hr/wk! That family was most important in the raising of children!
Ensuring their million dollar salaries &amp; ridiculous bonuses! Heaven forbid they have to give up their private jet, yacht, club memberships, mansions, or vacations! They would rather the guy working for $10/hr lose his house to pay for his cancer treatment! Greedy mindset like you
While I will admit I didn't agree with everything Obama did! He got millions healthcare insurance, previously denied due to pre-existing conditions! He can't be blamed for insurance co greed in raising the premiums! They're like you, screwing over the hard-working middle class!
He kept our soldiers out of dangerous areas where boots on the ground would only result in senseless deaths &amp; no gain! He kept families together, regardless of their birth! Rather by their merit as a contributing member of our society! Obama was greatness personified!
Obama made our country respectable &amp; dignified again with his intellect, diplomacy, tact, &amp; cultural knowledge of other countries traditions/practices! He went above &amp; beyond to rebuild our country for the working class peoples ensured survival! Not the fat cats with millions!
Though I'm sure he was elected to take the fall if we fell into another Great Depression! A black man saved our country! The same country that has oppressed people of color for centuries! Obama was the bigger man &amp; developed a tax plan that brought immeasurable economic growth!
See what happens when the world &amp; country realize that your tax plan is now responsible for our economic growth, or lack thereof! You were handed the best economic development in decades thanks to Obama! Imagine the shithole recession he was handed! Yet he succeeded in saving us!
Hey @realDonaldTrump here's what you can take credit for &amp; attribute to your tax plan! Now that Obama's year is over! Yours has officially begun! Why no tweet taking responsibility for the fall? Unlike Obama, you are clueless about financial stability!	 https://t.co/1WeyG9OBCj

#NewProfilePic https://t.co/aDhWQnFoWp
@Kissanurse75 @MELANIATRUMP @realDonaldTrump Oh I agree completely!
@Kissanurse75 I also believe this is why she hasn't done crap for any causes! He won't let her! Afraid she'll mess up &amp; either spill secrets or make friends! Abusers always cutoff all outside influences! I truly believe that's why he's keeping them all right by his side! To manipulate them!
@Kissanurse75 Either way... If someone could get her talking I bet the dirt would be enough to lock him up! He's a danger to Americans, democracy, &amp; our constitutional rights! They don't realize the public platform is the safest way for them to speak out!
@Kissanurse75 I think he's beaten these women down mentally &amp; physically! That's why she wanted to stay in NY! Safety! I think by them not speaking out he's either holding kids &amp; money over them! Melania doesn't realize he'd go to jail or he's gotten away with so much she's afraid he won't!
@Kissanurse75 I've said from the beginning there is no love in their marriage! It is of convenience! I now wonder if she's not trapped &amp; become a hostage!? Neither loves the other! That's been made very clear! You get her in a safe place with someone she can trust I bet she spills everything!
@Kissanurse75 I believe that Melania &amp; Ivanka are terrified of Trump! I think he's sexually &amp; physically abused both women! When they're near him it's like they're screaming help! I think Melania might be the one to bring him down! So she can divorce him &amp; be happy!
@Lilobri @rlukejr @JohnFugelsang I need to add this... I despise women who have never been the victims of DV using it as a means to gain sympathy &amp; attention! I have the utmost respect for DV survivors using their story to gain attention/awareness to the brutality of DV! I'm sorry for any confusion!
RT @AP_Politics: BREAKING: More than enough senators have voted to advance bill ending government shutdown, vote still underway.
@AbsoluteKaty @JohnFugelsang AKA: death &amp; hell on Earth
@Lilobri @rlukejr @JohnFugelsang I am genuinely asking if her pointing to herself is a known fact of her past &amp; something she's discussed! If so she should be trying to empower other women to share their stories &amp; help others escape abusive relationships! If I had her platform I'd try to help as many as possible
@Lilobri @rlukejr @JohnFugelsang Do you think it's a ploy to gain viewers or sincere? As a DV survivor I despise women who use it to gain sympathy &amp; attention! I don't watch her so I can't speak about her... I'm a stronger woman/mom because of what I've endured! When you grow up with abuse you think it's love!
@realDonaldTrump Your own words coming back to bite you in the arse again???!!! Remember 2013??? Suck it up buttercup! Your own supporters are being influenced by your very words still! Following you mindlessly of course!

@sfqlovesrqf @jinxy51 @krassenstein He only mentioned Hoover to point out that the only one with a longer history at the FBI is the guy who started it all! He didn't say a dang thing about Hoover other than his years as an agent! Thus Mueller is above &amp; beyond reputable in his service to protecting our country!

@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It's cruel &amp; inhumane to deport Dreamers to a country they have never known! But I'm betting that Native Americans are wondering if they can do the same to all of you!
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Comatose you have no idea you're being taken into a foreign country undocumented! You can't stop what's happening or try to right it by going to officials! After years of laying in a bed unconscious you awaken to find yourself illegally in NK &amp; prison time for being there so long
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Don't post if you have no clue! Dreamers were babies/children that parents brought over! They had no say in how they entered the US or ability to become citizens! Now they can't become citizens but they don't know anywhere else but US! It'd be like taking you to NK while comatose

@Rubiyat @Aunt_Muu_Muu How can people believe that so many are out to destroy Trump! He's destroying himself! We just aren't excusing his ignorant &amp; immature outbursts or believing his guilt filled denials! If he was loyal to America &amp; educated himself I wouldn't be writing this!
@Rubiyat @Aunt_Muu_Muu Hard to find anything anti-trump! I have found patriotic, thorough, factual news exposing Trump's treasonous ways! If you only believe 1 news source the problem isn't the truth it's the lies in the 1 you're watching that's reporting opposite every single other news source!
@Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump Trump is also using taxpayer money, govt contracts, &amp; positions in his administration to repay those he's indebted to! That's unconstitutional &amp; illegal! He's trying to start a nuclear war! He needs a war for profit to dig himself out of all the debtors coming to collect!
@Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump My concern is laws being constitutional! A law can't be unlawful! That's absurd! Trump only cares about making GOP &amp; anyone else pledge loyalty to him. Which is unconstitutional! Their loyalty is to the people and the Constitution! Not POTUS! Forcing constituents loyalty is crazy
@slashpot @richardcowan195 @Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump @slashpot my initial response to him! I tried to be nicer! 		Wow! The intellectual magnitude of your well thought-out, incredibly relevant, original &amp; insightful post is indicative of a poor, uneducated, easily influenced, lacking mental acuity, diminished mental capacity man!
@richardcowan195 @Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump Catholic religion doesn't believe in birth control!   Christians believe in pro-birth!

@richardcowan195 @Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump I'm assuming you don't comprehend based on the regurgitated, acuity deprived response!

Truth! I'm hoping Obama isn't the last! https://t.co/V402Z1nyk9
@perfectsliders @AmericasJohn So it's not fake if that's happened this last year. The cause &amp; effect though, since this implies Trump influenced this drop somehow, is absolutely fake since it wasn't his tax plan that created the economic growth, unemployment drops, or controlled low inflation!
@perfectsliders @AmericasJohn It's not a matter of fake or real, it's misleading! Trump's economic proposal starts with the Taxscam! He's riding Obama's tax plan his 1st yr like Obama had to W. Bush! Trump has not effected the stock market rise or unemployment rates til his taxscam is implemented in 2018!

@Rusty662 @TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov Seems like the current administration is also destroying the integrity of America by colluding with Russia &amp; snubbing the UN &amp; other allies!

@Rusty662 @TalbertSwan @HopeRadio1 @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov The only ones trying to destroy the US right now is Trump &amp; GOP!

@KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump Hey @KatrinaSteffens without googling.. Tell me what you think DACA is an acronym for! Then I'd love to hear what you think it is! Because if you actually knew ANYTHING about DACA you'd know these pics are not relevant to DACA at all! Don't spread your ignorance by fear mongering
@KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump Don't spread fear mongering propaganda bs! Don't try to influence others when you're so uninformed! You're against a basic human right to live where you're raised &amp; accustomed to based on birth! To throw people into a foreign land with no resources is cruel &amp; inhumane! #NoIdiots
@hunterdavis328 @daniacrtz96 @KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump Don't spread fear mongering propaganda bs! Don't try to influence others when you're so uninformed!

@hunterdavis328 @daniacrtz96 @KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump Undocumented adult immigrants are not apart of DACA! DACA is an acronym for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals! I should not have to tell you or her this! If you want to have an opinion on the fate of over 700,000 then research the facts, learn its meaning, &amp; be informed!
@hunterdavis328 @daniacrtz96 @KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump That is true. They CHOSE to come here undocumented! DACA is for babies/children brought over with parents &amp; as they become adults have no way to gain citizenship! The fact that she is posting it at all is irrelevant &amp; ignorant of the DACA issue! Educate yourselves people!
@KatrinaSteffens @realDonaldTrump Ignorance like this is wtf is wrong with this country! These men are undocumented immigrants! NOT dreamers raised here their entire life! The difference is the men had knowledge &amp; free choice in how they came to the US... Dreamers were babies/children so they did not! Got it??
@GodzWorld @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump It's propaganda bs! Not to mention all the documents a person needs to get assistance they wouldn't have! I agree with granting dreamers citizenship since they had no free choice in how they came here! Denying them completely is cruel &amp; inhumane! They don't know anywhere else!
@GodzWorld @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump What freebies do you think they get? Do criminals go to the police for help when they're on the run? So why would undocumented citizens go to the govt asking for assistance when they're afraid of being deported? See how illogical that entire statement is? Just think about it!
@garyc3 @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump Don't give Trump any ideas! The last thing we need is 6 indebted judges to Trump! If 9 can't figure it out then adding more won't ease the gray area decision making process of what is or isn't constitutional!
@klc4trump @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump When a man considered a political power is taunting a heartless dictator with nuclear weapons, jeopardizing lives!  Being called an idiot for following Trump isn't an opinion, it's a fact! Idiot means "foolish or stupid person"! Supporting such behavior is foolish &amp; stupid!
@garyc3 @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Neither had freedom of choice! Since their ancestors never obtained citizenship that would nullify their citizenship! Shouldn't matter where you're born! Only where you have been raised &amp; accustomed to living! I can't imagine being threatened to be sent to a country I don't know!
#DACA #DreamersRights #ProtectDreamers 		After all the pilgrims and early settlers never received citizenship so their descendants are here illegally! Same exact concept! No free choice should mean as an adult they have the right to choose to become citizens! https://t.co/MSbrUEDQK1
@garyc3 @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The very idea of sending people to a land they don't know based on birth when they were raised, educated, &amp; accustomed to life here is against the very foundation of this country! They had no choice! Sending them back would be like sending back every descendant from pilgrims!
@Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump Sounds like they're all up in people's business left &amp; right where they don't belong! Pushing, imposing, &amp; cramming their religious bs beliefs onto everyone else by trying to repeal laws &amp; constitutional rights! Might want to learn what "conservative" means before you go crying!
@Vinceallison63 @bogieboris @TalbertSwan @realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump @Vinceallison63 then why have so many of Trump's executive orders been deemed unconstitutional? Seems that he cares nothing about law &amp; rights but rather his own personal agenda! Same conservatives that want to dictate who can get married, control over women's bodies, &amp; BC denied
Thank goodness there are still those that realize an unconstitutional order! I know most dreamers speak Spanish but aren't able to write it! They grew up here! Their parents spoke Spanish so of course that was their first spoken language but not their first fluent language! #DACA https://t.co/upb4KIoMEM

Either way that list is as real as the hair on his head!
@Gamerben111 @weeloopoo Trump's getting desperate &amp; nervous about not getting his wall or his way... Promised contracts &amp; money! Collectors are calling &amp; he hasn't been able to just sign away everything he owes with an executive order! His bullying isn't working! He's scared! Watch him implode!

@Gamerben111 @weeloopoo Don't see him writing Bezos or Gates a check! I do see the GOP committing acts almost treasonous to give him what he wants! Why are politicians bending over backwards for him, even if he is president? Risking their own careers/freedom unless they're afraid not to or paid off?!?!
@Gamerben111 @weeloopoo Then you'd realize he is not working for the American citizens! He's working to pay back all the promises he made, favors he agreed to, &amp; money he borrowed! People with that kind of money don't get it legally or without excessive abuses of power over an impoverished people!
@Gamerben111 @weeloopoo Robbing Peter to pay Paul does not a successful business man make! Show me tax records or financial reports with accurate profit margins against debt for each business! Show me his means for digging himself out of the hole time after time, failure after failure! Follow the money!
@Gamerben111 @weeloopoo What do you consider successful? He has ruined multiple entire businesses with promises to pay for labor &amp; materials then never paid them! He's had numerous flop after flop, also the bankruptcies! He's in debited to everyone with power or money! That's not success!that's a conman

The fact that you're pulling a whataboutism because you have no valid argument or defense for the orange clown is showing your lack of information &amp; education! Please come back when you have a clue!
@Gixx2BG @AuntLynnieNY @AwaitingShower @Mas_Tank71 @justiciaparahoy @TheKaosian @EdJoyce @PuertoRicoPUR Considering there is a military base there in Hawaii, remember 12/7/41? So yeah it is protected by our brave men &amp; women in the armed forces already! I don't know wtf you're getting Africa from! But I'm sure it was probably for business or charitable purposes!

@markboone219 @brhootnie @JackdBoone3 @APZlawyers @iamLucretiaMott @krassenstein I'm curious.... How would they ration healthcare? Genuine question! I don't equate the 2. Other countries have universal healthcare and aren't rationing it, if it could even be. Why is the country leading in military unable to figure out healthcare for its citizens?
@markboone219 @brhootnie @JackdBoone3 @APZlawyers @iamLucretiaMott @krassenstein It will be a mandated set rate throughout all providers and carriers! It's the insurance companies screwing us! Not the govt! They're greedy like the rest of the 1%! But with universal the govt would set a cap they would pay and the companies would have to abide by it!
@markboone219 @brhootnie @JackdBoone3 @APZlawyers @iamLucretiaMott @krassenstein Do you not remember back in 02-03 when health insurance premiums over doubled? I do, at the time I was pregnant with my son, working as a CNA at the Indiana Veterans Home and my health insurance went from $86/check to $198/check! If we get universal they won't be able to rob us!

@nanamic52 @DearAuntCrabby I said the exact same thing! Bs Reagan above Obama! LOL! Trickle down economics has only made the rich increasingly richer while the minimum wage has remained &amp; prices for consumer goods have skyrocketed! Increasing 36% for a pizza!

@tammylynn1129 @thehill I've been saying that for over a year now! But between Trump other shining examples of rich privilege, I'm beginning to think it's never going to happen! Blatantly proving the 1% control this country! He's not even discreet... Makes me wonder what other laws he's been above!
@Cook34H @StephenAMerritt @realDonaldTrump Me too @Cook34H.... How 32% of people agree with Trump and think he's doing good has me so mind f***ed! I hoped for the longest that since I had a hysterectomy on election day that I'm in a coma having a nightmare! Or I'm in some alternate universe! How can anyone justify Trump?
@RealJoviVal @Velvetpage @bjmgraphics @Real_Assange_ @realDonaldTrump Just because he's not man enough to admit he's a child raping monster only proves his lack of remorse! Along with his inability to accept responsibility for his actions...That means he thinks it was perfectly acceptable! He needs to be put to sleep like a rabid dog!
@RealJoviVal @Velvetpage @bjmgraphics @Real_Assange_ @realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton was with a consenting adult woman! Unlike child predators Trump and Moore! Clinton didn't have to assault a child/woman against her will! Repulsive psychos target the helpless &amp; defenseless! The 2 are not even comparable.. Whataboutisms are pointlessly illogical! Fyi
@Real_Assange_ @realDonaldTrump I'm just curious how with all money you and Trump have that you can't afford to educate yourselves! If there was voter fraud it was Moore! That's why he won't concede!
