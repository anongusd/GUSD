Our hearts are still healing over Sandy Hook. In the inaction that followed, Congress hit a new low. Born of that grief, Sandy Hook Promise @sandyhook and @NewtownAction took up the fight to #EndGunViolence. Their tireless advocacy made passing #HR8 and #HR1112 possible!
Founded when public tragedy turned into a personal calling to save lives and prevent senseless suffering, @bradybuzz and @GiffordsCourage have been instrumental in the fight to #EndGunViolence and to pass the background checks bills in the House this week!
We have a Democratic House Majority that just passed 2 strong bills to help #EndGunViolence because of the hard work and advocacy of groups like the @AFTunion, @NEAToday, @MomsDemand, and @Everytown. We share their belief that children have a right to be safe to learn in school.
Background checks and other solutions to #EndGunViolence once had strong bipartisan support in Congress. 97% of Americans support them right now!  It‚Äôs time Republicans started representing voters again, instead of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that fund them.
As survivors of America‚Äôs gun violence epidemic along with concerned moms &amp; other activists marched the halls of Congress and took over town halls to demand action to #EndGunViolence, Democratic candidates promised to do something if they were elected. They just did!
With 97% of Americans supporting background checks ‚Äì including the vast majority of NRA members ‚Äì Mitch McConnell should respect the people enough to allow a vote in the Senate on this common sense solution to #EndGunViolence.
When Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic efforts to #EndGunViolence after Sandy Hook, our heart sank as a nation. The strength and courage of grieving Newtown families and the activists born of that tragedy eventually galvanized us at the ballot box to say enough!
In the last election, candidates were confronted with an urgent call for meaningful legislation to #EndGunViolence when the #Parkland shooting transformed a group of teen survivors into our national conscience. They and other young people across America made the difference!
As gun violence remains a national crisis in our communities, our thoughts are with families that have lost loved ones and our prayers are that the US Senate will listen to the people‚Äôs cries for common sense solutions to #EndGunViolence and keep our families safe.
This week, the Democratic House Majority made good on a sacred promise from the campaign trail to work to #EndGunViolence as a top priority if Democrats took back the House. Voters delivered and now they have, too. The ball‚Äôs in your court, Mitch McConnell. Do the right thing!
