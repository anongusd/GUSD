If a Democratic president declares a national emergency on climate change, or gun violence, Republicans who support Trump on this one can say... nothing... in opposition.
Some Senate R's have warned for weeks that declaring a national emergency:		1. Sets a precedent the next Democratic president could follow in ways they hate. 	2. Is likely to get Trump sued. 	3. Probably won't get a single additional mile of wall built.

Shocked laughter in the hearing room as Whittaker says @RepJerryNadler‚Äôs five minutes are up so he‚Äôs not going to answer a question on Mueller.
This hearing took less than five minutes into questioning to turn contentious. Whittaker refusing to answer @RepJerryNadler questions on when he was briefed on Mueller probe, or if he conveyed information to Trump.

Lead GOP negotiator @SenShelby briefed the president this morning on the ongoing shutdown/wall/DHS talks, his spokesperson tells me. Doesn‚Äôt sound like there‚Äôs a deal yet.
Now Sen @DougJones says he will vote for Barr in the full senate, meaning Barr will receive at least token bipartisan support.
In a statement, Sen. @ChrisCoons says he will oppose Bill Barr‚Äôs nomination as AG, meaning Barr will likely pass the Judiciary committee today with no Democratic votes in favor.

@JackRottie I‚Äôve literally talked about this every live shot I‚Äôve done this week.
With neither side blinking I'm starting to think most likely way out of the shutdown is Trump declaring national emergency. 		- Congress then votes to reopen government	- Administration gets sued. 	- Wall-building freezes	- Trump runs against obstructionist Dems &amp; Courts in 2020
@aseitzwald Alex, maybe we're doing this wrong? Should we just switch to exclusively writing facial hair "takes"?
‚ÄúThe President is is tough as a pine knot on this. He‚Äôs resolute,‚Äù @SenJohnKennedy says there‚Äôs no way this shutdown ends without a wall.
@MattMackowiak Yes, he totally won the negotiation with that, ::checks notes:: tv reporter.

Cruz says this election is about three things:		1. Jobs	2. Freedom	3. Security
Cruz works his way through impressively low unemployment numbers for different demographics: African Americans, Hispanics, youth. Big cheers from a crowd that is almost entirely white &amp; older. Good question for Tuesday is if GOP can get any credit from those groups on economy
Cruz calls for congress to go further, says they should pass a flat tax and abolish the IRS.

Cruz works his way through the economic numbers: lowest unemployment for African Americans &amp; Hispanics in history, Texas oil biz booming... says @BetoORourke would bring back regulations and hurt jobs.

Senators Manchin, Collins, Murkowski and Flake met tonight after the Kavanaugh hearing ended, Manchin told reporters. He would not characterize their discussion at all- only joking that they did not discuss the weather.
Just followed Rachel Mitchell down the hallway outside the hearing room and tried to ask her several times about Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony and whether she found her credible. She didn‚Äôt respond.
All this process back-and-forth about leaks isn‚Äôt helpful for Democrats at all. The more this is about politics and leaks and process, rather than Ford‚Äôs story and Kavanaugh‚Äôs credibility, the better for GOP
Tillis: ‚ÄúI look forward to supporting your nomination.‚Äù

Having the sex crimes prosecutor ask a question about whether the woman who claims she was sexually assaulted reached out to any Republicans to report it is an odd moment.
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC has looked visibly annoyed at various points during this hearing. Some of that frustration bubbling over in that back-and-forth over the polygraph.

During this break, prosecutor Rachel Mitchell huddled with Republican Senators in an empty heading room across from the judiciary committee room.
What sticks with me about the first portion of this is Dr. Ford‚Äôs two front doors. No raw emotion to it, sounded like a deeply embedded traumatic response.

One final button on this. @CoryBooker isn't going to be expelled. It takes a vote of 2/3rds of the Senate, and out of 15 expulsions in Senate history, 14 were for "support for Confederate rebellion." The 15th? "Anti-Spanish conspiracy; treason"

Unclear why Booker staff couldn‚Äôt just hand Kavanaugh a copy...
Sen @CoryBooker exchange with Kavanaugh is the testiest of the day so far. One GOP Senator interrupts to call for a brief suspension to make sure Kavanaugh has documents in front of him from which Booker is reading.
While I was typing that tweet, two other protesters stood up to demonstrate and were removed.
Latest protestor to be removed from Kavanaugh hearing is Kristin Mink, who famously confronted Scott Pruitt in a restaurant on videl shortly before his resignation.
Ok I‚Äôll join the nerding out here. Kavanaugh‚Äôs mention of Federalist 10 and factions is really interesting. He‚Äôs an example of what Dems are worried would be one faction getting too much power: GOP ‚Äúfaction‚Äù consolidation of legislative &amp; exec branches w/ essentially GOP court.

Almost all the votes are in from Franklin County. If the trend so far holds up, Delaware county looks like it may put Balderson over the top... barely... at the very end. #OH12

Don't kill the messenger: Ohio law requires automatic recount if the margin of a race is less than 1/2 of a percent. Which... appears to be where we're headed. #OH12

I'll say this for O'Connor campaign: they've managed expectations well. At this point in the GA06 race, there was basically a full-on dance party at the Ossoff HQ. Just opening the doors here in Ohio tonight, and everyone watching returns.
@ryanobles Not true! It was much harder to match outfits with Rebecca.
One of my favorite #OH12 stats, per a Democratic source familiar: The @dccc sent would-be voters half a million TEXTS during this race, including 60K today to Franklin county voters about Balderson gaffe about their county. So 2018...
Its purely anecdotal, but sometimes it feels like one team is getting all the bounces. That's the Democrats in #OH12 - But can that overcome their pure math problem here? https://t.co/kQU7dpvuLu
