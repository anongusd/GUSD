Yes, food is a right. One can't have "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" without FOOD. But just because it's a right doesn't mean government has to provide it, merely ensure our access to it. https://t.co/BJE70aMZgQ
I will oppose #ThomasFarr's confirmation to the federal bench. #VoterSuppression is a big problem in our democracy, but it must be solved through legislation, not judicial activism. That being said, Mr. Farr's history with the topic is troubling, and so he will not get my vote.
Ever wonder why the #StockMarket goes crazy, but your monthly cashflow stays the same? Ever think about how the #economy is supposedly great, but the stock market is supposedly crashing? Then this post is for you!		https://t.co/5UZUXCePa9
All of this is why the stock market is a poor indicator of the overall economy. Plus, the market reflects EXPECTATIONS of FUTURE growth, not current economic conditions.
Capital has done very well in recent decades, while labor has been stagnant. This fuels populism, trumpism, socialism, and lowers faith in capitalism. Let's judge the economy by the ability of every day Americans to afford comforts and niceties. It's how we won the Cold War.
Labor and capital are usually at odds. Hence, Wall St vs Main St. Ex., If pay goes up, profits go down. Only way both do well is to increase PRODUCTIVITY. This requires investment from capital.
Labor = You give your time &amp; skills to an employer, who pays you a wage or salary. Capital = You give your money to businesses, either because they will use it productively to earn more money or because you expect the business' values to increase so you can later sell for profit.
Here's an overly simplistic, yet valuable, way of understanding the modern American economy... Two ways to earn money: through labor and capital.
The free market does not need to just be about finances. Economics is a bigger and more complex issue. At the end of the day, consumers can CHOOSE their transactions for any reason. That's the free market. https://t.co/dJe1zlAwLj
If you say we don't cause #ClimateChange and you're right, you win. If you say we don't and we do, you lose. If you say we do and we don't, all we do is shift the labor market towards green tech. And if you say we do and we do something about it, we save the world.
Even if you're skeptical of human-caused climate change, consider it like Pascal's Wager, which posits that humans gamble with their lives in their beliefs on God. It works the same way with climate change.
It's incredibly important that all Americans are aware of this #ClimateChange report. We're running out of time. https://t.co/NTO80MZcFv
Today is also the anniversary of the #kennedyassassination. In honor of a great President who sought to unite people on opposing ideological sides, let us remember his words: "Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us."
...Therefore, I... do hereby designate as a day of general thanksgiving... and do recommend that throughout the land the people cease from their wonted occupations, and in their several homes and places of worship render thanks unto Almighty God for his manifold mercies."
We pray for strength, and light, so that in the coming years we may with cleanliness, fearlessness, and wisdom, do our allotted work on the earth in such manner as to show that we are not altogether unworthy of the blessings we have received.
Therefore, in thanking God for the mercies extended to us in the past, we beeseech Him that He may not withhold them in the future, and that our hearts may be roused to war steadfastly for good and against all the forces of evil, public and private.
Failure would not only be a dreadful thing for us, but a dreadful thing for all mankind, because it would mean loss of hope for all who believe in the power and the righteousness of liberty.
In no other place and at no other time has the experiment of government of the people, by the people, for the people, been tried on so vast a scale as here in our own country...
"It behoves us not only to rejoice greatly because of what has been given us, but to accept it with a solemn sense of responsibility, realizing that under Heaven it rests with us ourselves to show that we are worthy to use aright what has thus been entrusted to our care.
This #Thanksgiving, I would like to recall the words of President Theodore Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation in 1903...
Today, I am #thankful for the American people, who inspire me every day.
Today, I am #Thankful for a system of #federalism and #ChecksAndBalances, which ensure that no person nor party seize unwarranted power.
Today, I am #Thankful for all of the brave men and women in our armed services, as well as our first responders, for doing all that is necessary to protect our liberties and ensure our freedoms for future generations.
Today, I am #thankful for a nation built on ideas and culture, not race and religion. I thankful to the American people of previous generations, who allowed my family to come here and start life anew. Only in this great nation could my family's story have happened.
Government and policy are not about making your dreams come true. They're about preventing your nightmares from happening. Everything you want someone else fears, and everything you fear someone else wants. Embrace checks, balances, and compromise!
Presidents can disagree with court rulings, but we must remember that PROCESS MATTERS. Take disagreements through the legal system. This can allow the executive to be a check on the judiciary, just as judges can be a check on the President.

I voted AGAINST moving forward on Kavanaugh for two principal reasons: 1. His proclivity for expansive presidential privilege, and 2. His demonstrated partisanship in last week's testimony.
Setting aside sexual misconduct allegations, how can #Republicans support a #SupremeCourt nominee who is so supportive of expansive presidential privilege?!? Isn't this completely antithetical to everything Republicans believe????
Everytime #Kavanaugh takes his case to the American people (tv interview, op-ed), he degrades the nonpartisanship of the #SupremeCourt. His job is to convince senators, not voters. He's a judge, not a politician... Or so we all thought.

I want to emphasize again that anyone is free to SPEAK in support of any candidate anywhere. Volunteer to help (tech can allow us to do this from a distance). But political donations should only be raised among potential constituents!
This would also mean that political parties cannot generically fundraise. Help candidates fundraise among their future constituents, but don't collect $ from all over and spread it all over.
Here's a radical idea: how about barring political donations to candidates who won't LITERALLY represent you? Meaning you can't donate to a congressional campaign of another district, governor of another state, etc. Go ahead and volunteer/speak/campaign! But keep $ in-house!
