@incognito1016 Doesn‚Äôt matter. You just can‚Äôt get it done in the Senate with only 53 Republicans and there aren‚Äôt enough moderate Democrats left.
If Republicans couldn‚Äôt get wall funding during the shutdown they definitely won‚Äôt get it over the next three weeks. The biggest problem for Republicans is that they don‚Äôt have a 60 vote majority in the Senate. If they did, Pres. Trump would have his wall funding by now.

Nancy Pelosi wants to deny President Trump access to close to 50 million viewers at a time when public opinion matters regarding the shutdown. She also wants to flex what powers she has as Speaker of the House. It‚Äôs petty politics.

@kenashgrammy @soccerfan0925 I personally don‚Äôt like calling the media the enemy of the people but there is clearly an animus and bias against the president that is evident in the coverage of him. I do, however, think that fake news is very dangerous and is a different story.
@SteveS47163204 She can say no to him using the House as the venue. He could deliver it elsewhere but in a less formal setting it might not get covered as much
@soccerfan0925 That‚Äôs true, but the media will be less inclined to cover it if it is not in an official setting. And if no one covers it, what‚Äôs the point?
The fact that Pelosi and Trump cannot even agree on him delivering the State of the Union is not a good sign that this shutdown will be resolved anytime soon...

@cmclymer You do realize that Elizabeth Warren is worth almost $9 million, right? Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress. Sanders made $1 million in 2016. Clintons have made hundreds of millions. Obama is worth an estimated $40 million. If you hate the rich, hate your own party.
@cmclymer Sadly, none. But I hope that changes one day!
@cmclymer Donald Trump is loaded and connected with blue collar workers because he owned who he was. He owned the fact he was rich but wanted others to get rich too. Candidates like Warren, Clinton &amp; Romney all have one thing in common: inauthentic. Warren will never be president.
@cmclymer I think you should reread some of your tweets before telling someone else they should have integrity. You‚Äôre completely missing the point. It‚Äôs not about if Elizabeth Warren struggled verses if she didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs about Elizabeth Warren pretending to be something she is not.
@cmclymer Don‚Äôt have the time or interest in going back and forth with you for the rest of the day. Have a good one!
@cmclymer First of all, thank you for your service. Second of all, you don‚Äôt know me or my family. And lastly, Elizabeth Warren can‚Äôt say she wants everyone to play by the same rules after lying about her heritage to get ahead in life. It will be her Achilles‚Äô heel. I‚Äôve worked in politics

@JakeSherman My point is, who cares? It‚Äôs stupid. The media is acting like voters haven‚Äôt been through this before. Not assigning blame to a specific outlet, I just think it‚Äôs dumb all around. You‚Äôve covered the Hill, I‚Äôve worked there. This is norm, sadly.
@JakeSherman https://t.co/vKfNS1kuFs
@JakeSherman The mass hysteria over a potential shutdown in general is dumb. At this point, no cares. How many times have we been through this? I am traveling but this is the first story that popped up when I googled shutdown. https://t.co/nMsH19mUyd
There is way too much emphasis about who will get blamed for a government shutdown. The 2020 election is so far away no one will remember by then, let alone a couple of months from now. The mass media hysteria over it is so dumb.

The media‚Äôs orchestrated smear of Brett Kavanaugh | Fox News https://t.co/5ia84RB0r7
Christine Blasey Ford has a credibility problem | TheHill https://t.co/nUWTvzjkU8
@CostiganA @SInow He went through seven background checks. Ford has given several different versions of her story. She gives two different accounts in her polygraph letter alone. Her best friend contradicted her. She lied about her fear of flying &amp; why she needed a second exit in her house.
@TheRickyDavila @SInow Take the time to look at the facts of the allegations against Nassar vs Kavanaugh. It diminishes the #MeToo movement to conflate the two. The allegations against Nassar are credible, the one‚Äôs against Kavanaugh are not. https://t.co/nUWTvzjkU8
@laurenuza @RPatrickAllen I actually take the time to evaluate the facts and evidence. It appears you believe someone simply because of their gender. Take the time to look at the credibility of the allegations against Nassar verses Kavanaugh.
@SInow My problem with this is equating Rachael Denhollander with Dr. Ford in any way. Nassar should rot in eternal hell. He was convicted. Denhollander showed tremendous courage by speaking out. However, the evidence does not support Ford‚Äôs accusations against Kavanaugh.
@jentaub @SInow Just because one man is guilty of something does not mean every single man who is accused of something is guilty. Yes, Nassar should rot in eternal hell for what he did but that does not mean Kavanaugh is guilty of anything. Denhollander should be awarded, but Ford should not.
@RPatrickAllen Imagine being baselessly accused of something and your life almost derailed by a woman who repeatedly changed her story and the witnesses she named said they had no idea what she was talking about, including one of her best friends. https://t.co/nUWTvzjkU8

@Flyingright1 @RealSaavedra I have seen God change lives. My uncle used to be an alcoholic &amp; came to the Lord before he passed away from lung cancer. His heart softened &amp; his whole demeanor changed. He told us he was glad he was dying because he finally found peace in life &amp; knew he was going to heaven.
@rickungar @marcorubio 1) That is the point of filing these lawsuits, let the court work it out &amp; determine if there have been violations. 2) Give voters more credit. They can read through the information themselves &amp; determine what is right or wrong. 3) Brenda Snipes has destroyed ballots in the past.
@rickungar @marcorubio 1) Rick Scott has filed lawsuits and asked for an investigation. He has taken steps to remedy the situation. 2) Bringing information into the light for voters is not bitching, it‚Äôs important.

@JoeConchaTV Right. But there was no bias at the FBI...üôÑ
One of the most important things at stake tonight is the balance of power on the state level. A lot of gubernatorial and state legislature races tonight that could determine redistricting.
Beware of a lot of spin tonight regarding House &amp; Senate results. The results likely won‚Äôt mean that much unless Dems win in a landslide or R‚Äôs keep control of the House &amp; the Senate.
@MattC42 @OutnumberedFNC Thanks, Matthew! Appreciate that.
I worked at the NRCC during 2010 when R‚Äôs picked up 63 seats in the House, on a Senate race in 2012 when we saw some losses, on a Senate race in 2014 when we won back the Senate by picking up 9. Election cycles are often like a pendulum swinging back and forth.

@InnocentSmith LOL! Go VOLS!
If Democrats pick up less than the first midterm average of 28 seats in the House and 2-3 in the Senate tonight they have actually underperformed, particularly given the amount of R retirements &amp; competitive races. Just remember that if the mainstream media tells you otherwise!
@Guccifer2O Haha basically. General rule of thumb: Republicans can never win when it comes to the media.
@johnsart54 My background is in politics and because of that I have seen over the years how the media is consistently biased against Republicans, and they are extremely biased against President Trump. That is why when he says fake news it resonates with so much of his base.

Keep in mind the historical average for R‚Äôs to lose tonight in the House &amp; Senate is 31 seats. If the media spins anything close to that or less as a referendum on Trump &amp; GOP they are lying. Obama lost 63 House &amp; six Senate during his first midterm - that is a referendum.

@CortesSteve 100 percent!
@777Snv @realDonaldTrump I definitely haven‚Äôt, but I would be lying to you if I didn‚Äôt say that Dems have a path to the majority in the House. It‚Äôs an easier one than for Republicans. However, Trump has defied history and polling has been all over the place.
The economy is just so strong: ‚ÄúThe ABC/Washington Post poll found that 65 percent had a positive view of the economy, up from 51 percent just prior to Trump's inauguration. That the highest level for the poll since reaching a mark of 70 percent in January¬†2001.‚Äù (5/5)
I probably stand alone in this but I think talking about immigration from a law &amp; order/border security standpoint helps more than it hurts by mobilizing the base. Reposting my column from two weeks ago: https://t.co/ocdtxidFbZ (4/5)
Trump doesn‚Äôt seem as toxic as he is portrayed. ‚ÄúAlthough the president is not on the ballot, 31 percent said they plan to cast their vote to signal support for Trump, while 38 percent their vote will be cast to signal their opposition.‚Äù (3/5)
Women voters: ‚ÄúWhile the last two of their polls found women favoring Democrats by margins of more than 20 percent, that lead has dropped to 14 points in the most recent survey...among independent female voters, from a 33-point edge in October to a two-point lead now.‚Äù (2/5)
No one seems certain about tomorrow. There is obviously a path for Dems with so many R retirements &amp; competitive seats in play. Also, just looking at the 24 seats R‚Äôs hold in districts that went for Clinton in 2016. But there is also some hope...(1/5)		https://t.co/me46YUitXb
Looking at midterm elections since World War II, R‚Äôs should lose an average of 31 seats tomorrow. I think it‚Äôs disingenuous to spin any losses in that range or less as a major referendum on @realDonaldTrump. Remember, R‚Äôs picked up 63 House seats and six Senate seats in 2010.

Lastly, the mainstream media &amp; the Left can hit Trump over his truthfulness all they want but he‚Äôs kept his promises to voters. That is why the attacks don‚Äôt resonate with his base. It‚Äôs not that they aren‚Äôt paying attention they are just glad to have a politician keep promises.
The deck has always been stacked against Republicans in the media. Republicans got tired of being the punching bag of the mainstream media. They got tired of the bs double standards and they elected Trump who fights back. He knows this and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt want to back down.
Perfect example here. When he first took office, Trump was asked about the ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs March‚Äù on ABC. He reminded David Muir about March for Life and called the network out for not covering it in the past.		Trump Hits Press For Not Covering March for Life  https://t.co/9kuk2vA79i

@mike_knoke But nothing fits that narrative, even what we know now.
@lscott163 Correct
How are these suspicious packages an anti-media driven act? They were all addressed to figures on the Left. The one sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan. There is a lot we don‚Äôt know yet, but what we do know doesn‚Äôt support that narrative.
@TriBeCaDad @AndrewGillum Not true at all. He‚Äôs under investigation by the FL Commission on Ethics for trips to NYC &amp; Costa Rica. There is an FBI corruption investigation into his city, including a project he helped greenlight. If he is lying about the ticket, what else is he lying about?
@AndrewGillum You‚Äôve got 99 problems and you lying about an FBI investigation is most certainly one.

@AndrewGillum 1. If the ticket was so innocuous why did you lie about it? 2. Why did the FBI want access to you as part of their corruption probe? 3. Why did undercover agents go to the trouble of inviting you and paying for the play and boat tour in NYC? (1/2)

If they actually exist, why didn‚Äôt #ChristineFord turn them over to the committee? The Post‚Äôs report said the notes state there were 4 attackers, don‚Äôt mention Kavanaugh‚Äôs name &amp; happened in Ford‚Äôs late teens. Why did the Post run an uncorroborated &amp; contradictory story? (2/3)

The Left &amp; many in the media will not be satisfied w/anything less than Kavanaugh stepping down or failing to get confirmed. That is what this is all about. At first we were told women were going to die, then he was a sexual assaulter, now a drunk &amp; a liar. It‚Äôs so transparent.
@meechebucco No, there is no evidence of that. The Left and the media are trying to run the narrative that because he drank in college anything is possible and he‚Äôs probably a monster. It‚Äôs stupid.
I find it hilarious that now if you drank in college it‚Äôs disqualifying from seeking any position of power. Not only did most of the people saying that probably have one too many themselves, but you know who didn‚Äôt drink in college? Donald Trump.

@fie2742 Again, proves my point. When you state the facts they get belligerent in their responses üëá
@BBWave2018 She has been a prosecutor for 25 years and has specialized in sex crimes. Her opinion is much more valuable than people like Cory Booker who has admitted to groping a drunk girl.
@Schmutzie_ She didn‚Äôt need to lay a glove. She got Christine Ford to contradict herself repeatedly. She‚Äôs afraid of flying? She‚Äôs got no problem flying across country every year, Hawaii, Costa Rica, etc. Look at the facts. You don‚Äôt need Mitchell‚Äôs memo to see Ford is Not Credible.
@tina_ducker @kailynlj That‚Äôs BS. He has already demonstrated he has the temperament for the job. He has served on the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, American Bar Association gave him a unanimous well qualified rating, he‚Äôs argued before the Supreme Court, it goes on and on...
@_marymary7 She is the one who is making the accusation. She is NOT credible. This whole charade has been a waste of everyone‚Äôs time, ruinous to Kavanaugh‚Äôs life, and destructive to our country.

@jerryjamesstone This guy literally just proved my point....üëá
@jerryjamesstone @kailynlj Every witness she has name under penalty of felony has denied it - including her lifelong friend, she says she doesn‚Äôt know how the Post got her therapist‚Äôs notes they reported she provided them (she won‚Äôt turn these notes over to congressional investigators). Doesn‚Äôt add up!
@jerryjamesstone @kailynlj Have you even looked at the facts or read Rachel Michell‚Äôs memo? The only thing consistent about Ford‚Äôs story is that it‚Äôs inconsistent. She‚Äôs given diff versions of how many people were there &amp; timelines, can‚Äôt remember details from just weeks ago &amp; lied about fear of flying.
@kailynlj I‚Äôm not. My heart breaks for those who have been victims. But the evidence does not support the allegations being made. I also care about due process and no innocent man should have his life ruined as a result of baseless allegations.

It is insane to me how everyone feels so bullied by #MeToo &amp; the Left they can‚Äôt admit what is painfully obvious. The allegations from Dr. Ford, Deborah Ramirez, &amp; Julie Swetnick have no credibility. Just look at the facts and don‚Äôt be a coward.
Can everyone please stop pretending like Dr. Ford is credible now? She is NOT credible. It‚Äôs painfully obvious. I feel like I‚Äôve been living in the Twilight Zone. https://t.co/oYq1H7Q957
