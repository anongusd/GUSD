@RealSaavedra They are actually in that Trump chooses to take the word of Putin regarding election meddling, just as he takes KJU word re Otto Warmbier death.
@AdamParkhomenko Helsinki first. Then he takes the Saudis word over our own intelligence re Kashoggi slaughter. Now Otto Wambier was just an "accidental casualty". I'm pissed at the 60mil that voted for this vile scum.
This is Helsinki and the Kashoggi/MBS slaughter all over again. There is no bottom with this man. I'm effing pissed right now. https://t.co/TBYWMdnAui

@kernickus1 @wrexmason @Lola_Rae90630 @keithboykin The first one that claims to be a "true story" where the guy's family is very much alive to dispute major events in the movie. We're not talking about some Titanic, world war II or holocaust inspired movie here. Dr. Don Shirley died not that long ago. Easy to fact check.
@kernickus1 @wrexmason @Lola_Rae90630 @keithboykin If you're going to use the actual names of the people who lived it and call a "true story", then you better make it accurate. Otherwise call it "inspired" and change the names to afford you the license to change stuff. You do a disservice if you don't.

@mbunchen23 @tariqnasheed Hmmm...did you forget we literally just had a black President considered by many like you "not native American black" (Obama)?

@realDonaldTrump Plus can't Mexicans and other Central Americans be Muslim? Is that against the law? Are you saying the US should be anti Islam?

@HilaryLaholt @ladygaga I think we should all be very offended by sexual predators and pedophiles. I wouldn't disregard that as "getting offended easily". Tell me what could be more offensive?
@RyanNijakowski @ladygaga Wow... you are much more lenient and understanding than me. In what universe does it make sense for a "known rapist and known victim" to collaborate and produce a song called "do what you want with my body"? You can't even write this joke.
@BlacVaChyna @ladygaga So no justice for the victims? Leave history where it is and no accountability for past actions?
@leonardodrozino @ladygaga I think I'd feel sick if I knew I collaborated with a known sexual predator and helped him profit of my talent. Wouldn't you?
@AlexxyLesya @ladygaga @rkelly Conversation? I think we're way past conversing with a sexual predator to "fix" things. What does that even mean to "fix" it? Nothing can fix it for the victims. Only thing they can hope for is justice.

@paolla0012 @playpiece @realDonaldTrump No you can't. You can ask for refugee status abroad at an embassy or with an institution UNHCR etc. But for asylum, one has to be physically appear at a port of entry such as a border. And Trump would know this if he was a President with an average IQ
