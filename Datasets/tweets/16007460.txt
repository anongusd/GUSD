@Howardspolitics @chipotlepickle Sorry, I'm not going to argue the facts of what happened. They're on tape.
@Howardspolitics @chipotlepickle This is how U.S. libel law works under existing precedents. If you're a public figure, you have to prove you were defamed through reckless disregard for the truth. If you're a private figure, you only have to prove negligence.
@Howardspolitics @chipotlepickle First of all, they don't have to get it knowingly wrong to lose this case. Second, the accurate accounts were there and they didn't bother to do the reporting, they published what was on social media from not-very-credible sources.
America's libel laws are wisely lenient toward journalists writing about the powerful. But they have little patience for powerful journalists who punch down at high school kids and can't be bothered to get the story right. https://t.co/adA2Gey3lA

@bljacka As Obama put it in his second book, political ambition usually comes usually comes in proportion to egomania.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst The standard of evidence is certainly lower in the court of public opinion. But not so low that an accusation can become its own sole piece of evidence.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst As for the presumption of innocence, it's overly simplistic either to dismiss it or to apply it absolutely to a public leader who is accused in this way.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst I offered my explanation for why I called him that, just a few paragraphs down. I encourage you to have a look.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst The entire point was that there are minimum standards  for accusations.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst And that's exactly what I wrote about Kavanaugh. The lack of even the slightest bit of corroboration, despite efforts at witness tampering to get Leland Keyser to change her story,  pretty much made it impossible to judge the man based on the story.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst Again, his established presence at the scene of each incident is itself partial corroboration. Far more than we had with Kavanaugh. It makes all of Franken's accusers more credible &amp; they all tell similar stories. 		Corroboration vs. no corroboration. It makes all the difference.
@bljacka Both parties have benches and people ready to take the creeps' places. No need to let them back in.
@bljacka Read the piece.
@bljacka Read the piece first, it deals with this.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst We have photos of Franken posing with most of his victims (often just before or after or while grabbing their butts or breasts), whereas we don't even have a single witness who can confirm that Kavanaugh and his accuser ever met.
@bljacka I don't see anyone trying to rehabilitate Blake Farenthold or anyone besides Franken. It all has to do with his utility as a party fundraiser. It's shockingly cynical.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst Again, if you read instead of indulging your prejudices, you'd remember that Franken gave a similar justification to Trump's --- "It's my right as an entertainer," he told one Dem aide whom he tried to kiss forcibly in 2006 the moment her boss left the room.
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst Kavanaugh's case is as unlike this one as any two things can be. Every one of Franken's attacks on women are at least partly corroborated. They all happened when he was an adult. There is photographic evidence of him humiliating one of the victims he had attacked the day before.
@bljacka It doesn't matter -- the effort to sanitize him and whitewash what he did is just as wrong
@Nanisimo @TianaTheFirst Read it. The facts are all there.

@richardfischer0 @RogueNotary This isn't a criminal trial. Al Franken chose to resign rather than defend himself because his cause was that hopeless. Any attempt by prominent thinkers to groom him for office again -- which is what this is -- has to be viewed through that lens.
@BagLady20 @RogueNotary Show me an abuser-priest who resigned under multiple allegations and who is now being rehabilitated on Twitter &amp; groomed to take office again.		I'll wait. 		And if such a priest in fact exists, I'll say the same thing about the people rehabbing him.
@gtumuluri It's not the impression he's cultivated, and I felt a need to say something when he treated Franken as some kind of hero. Anyway, Happy Thanksgiving.
@gtumuluri Norm Ornstein just tweeted in an effort to rehab Franken. That's what started my little tirade. Just so you know. It's not a fringe thing.
@AliBabaPortugal He resigned because eight women came forward and his female Senate colleagues had had enough with him. You'd know that if you'd read up.
@gtumuluri and in fact they want him to run for office again.

@Petrarca_Fr @RogueNotary @NormOrnstein If you think you're so savvy, then why are you defending Franken? He groped multiple women and resigned instantly when accused because he was dead to rights.
@Techn0phobe @Petrarca_Fr @RogueNotary @NormOrnstein I don't share a lot of your political views. I know you view that as a negative, but I never thought you'd put sexual predators above people you disagreed with. Don't pretend you #BelieveAllWomen because you don't.

@young_maymay @NormOrnstein Ryan, he's a predator, and you're a partisan hack. Don't ever pretend to be more. Happy Thanksgiving.
@young_maymay @NormOrnstein So you think multiple women made false accusations, and he resigned for nothing?
@young_maymay Multiple accusations of groping. You ought to read up on this topic. He didn't resign for nothing.
@young_maymay @NormOrnstein The picture was only the tip of the iceberg. You only reveal that you didn't read about the other seven women who accused him. Don't eve pretend you #believeallwomen.
@young_maymay Al Franken resigned from the Senate because of overwhelming evidence that he had groped multiple women.
So in other words, @NormOrnstein, you don't #believeallwomen, as long as the perp is someone you like. https://t.co/ncBs7BpntE
@RogueNotary If you're going to defend a serial groper like Franken, then you'd better not pretend to side with women who are preyed on by other powerful men. @NormOrnstein

@RogueNotary OK, so what is your definition of "sexual predator?" Are you asserting that it's a legal term?		More importantly, why are YOU protecting this creep?

@incohetur @JoshMcKoon Sorry, but you can't take that tone whilst defending the far more insane, brains-falling-out-your-head idea that nukes would be used against even the most rebellious Americans.

BTW, I am not missing the context here. This is just not a bright thing for anyone to say, full stop, let alone an elected. Our government's possession of nukes has never been one of the reasons why citizens voluntarily accept its legitimacy, nor should it ever be. https://t.co/5yI0EnyTPy

@MarcACaputo No, that's really not the issue.
@MarcACaputo Given that it also says her predecessor (who also wasn't supervisor in 2000) was fired in 2003.
@MarcACaputo How many? Zero, I should think, given that it explains that she was the "new" supervisor, like it says right there in the text that I just tweeted at you.
@MarcACaputo So you're saying it got lost under a pile of dust and that shows it's not a cover-up.		I disagree, but your original justification for your comment was that she wasn't supervisor in 2000. 		How are you not just doubling down on a careless tweet?
@MarcACaputo "helped cover it up." How is that inaccurate? https://t.co/AWmoK0lKe8
@MarcACaputo In that case, which part is misleading or false?
@MarcACaputo Marc, this is beneath you. The headline does not say that Snipes stole the vote or that she was there in 2000.
@MarcACaputo We've all made that mistake at some point. Just maybe stop casting aspersions on people doing their jobs.
@MarcACaputo Also, your explanation, that she wasn't the supervisor in 2000, strongly suggests that you didn't read the piece when you tweeted it.
@MarcACaputo If you had actually read the piece, you would see how she has refused to acknowledge, open or count his vote, even if it's merely a symbolic gesture at this point. You owe an apology and you should delete the tweet.
This headline explains that Snipes merely helped in the coverup, as the piece explains. I wouldn't be surprised if @MarcACaputo didn't read the piece, but I'm surprised he can't even read a headline. https://t.co/fEQVP407c5

@acohn98 And you also realize that anyone who survived this time is going to be pretty durable in 2020 unless we're in a depression and Trump is flaming out.
@acohn98 You're right that they got a lot of House seats. It's more than I thought it would be on Tuesday night. But you realize they're not going to be able to keep a lot of those.
@acohn98 I thought they might put nine seats in play I don't think any reasonable person thought they'd win nine seats.

@vajohna I don't need to tell myself anything. I don't need to tell you anything either, but you know you were expecting better.
@acohn98 This is exactly my point. Somehow, the party that's supposed to take its lumps and hard turned out instead and the losses were surprisingly light.		I never heard anyone talking about 60 seats 2 years ago. I was expecting Dems to take the Senate two years ago.
@WellspringGP Only obvious ones I see in 2020 are Maine and Colo. Maybe AZ if Republicans nominate an idiot. The rest are not impossible, but not especially promising.
@RiverTamYDN The midterm is when the president takes his lumps, the only recent exceptions were after 9/11 and Republicans going nuts on impeachment.
@RiverTamYDN You're right, but the economy was also really good in 2006, which was much more of a catastrophe for Republicans at all levels. Look it up.
@acohn98 That's fair, but this was the midterm. And it was a very high turnout midterm. Isn't that where Dems are supposed to shine? 		Pray for a downturn by 2020 I guess...
There will be no CRA to undo regs, no reconciliation bill undoing the tax reform, no opportunity to fast-track judges the way McConnell is going to do it for the next two years.
If Rs win either FL or AZ,  it's hard to see any path for Dems back to a Senate majority until at least 2022		And if there's a Dem president by then, I don't see it happening. So Dems' weak performance Tues  means that everything Trump is doing now is probably permanent

And before you say the Senate Rs did nothing to impede Trump, know that there were several nominees withdrawn and bad ideas never tried because of Senate disapproval.
This is also true. The staggered six-year terms and diversity of state interests prevent a monolith of similarly-minded people from sweeping in with a president &amp; forming a new governing majority overnight. This is itself a subtle check on ambitious guys w bad ideas. https://t.co/wnR1Wpa3uc

The people excluded by the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" are simply accredited diplomats, who are immune from U.S. jurisdiction.

@shortwave8669 You have really missed the point once again, and part of the reason is that you didn't even know what the linked article was about. We're done, thanks.
@shortwave8669 I cannot help that they're confused on that point. As I noted elsewhere, they're also talking about packing SCOTUS even though they don't control the White House or the Senate. Lots of power-abusing ambition.
This is why they're also talking about packing SCOTUS, despite controlling neither the WH nor the Senate. https://t.co/R6mCMC9SR9
@shortwave8669 Party rules? 		You don't seem to know what this article is about. 		Have a good evening.
This becomes funnier when I read it as follows: "A defeat could drive us and the people we follow on Twitter to support reforms." Well, yeah. 		BTW, guess why I don't spend a lot of time posting on Twitter anymore.
@shortwave8669 Yes, well, "If we lose we'll change the rules" is intent to abuse.
"If we lose this election, then we need to change the rules so that we won't lose the next one."		Can you at least wait until you have power to declare your intention to abuse it? https://t.co/4wfR5T0t9d

@JDaugherty105 @AG_Conservative The principle here is that it's better to be right than to be first.
@JDaugherty105 @AG_Conservative It always "seems" that way, and that's why these mistakes are made every time this happens.
@JDaugherty105 @AG_Conservative Also, reporting of erroneous, unverified comments from scanners is what usually leads to inaccurate details during coverage of this exact sort of event.
@JDaugherty105 @AG_Conservative I've seen news outlets forced to retract entire stories on major disasters because they listened to the scanner, heard what was actually a drill, and neglected to verify everything.
@MJ34Hig44 @traceypearson25 @robbystarbuck Yes, definitely a fascist and an anti-Semite. I don't think the modern mainstream politics of our country creates this sort of person. It has a much uglier and older pedigree.
@alwaysbeebetter This argument leads to all kinds of conclusions you don't want. It would be wrong to blame Bernie Sanders' rhetoric of economic resentment for the deliberate, well-planned but poorly executed attempt by one of his fans to shoot dozens of R congressmen last year..

@GGunnelsPCT It's certainly not worth denying that just to outlast me in an argument on Twitter. 		Have a pleasant evening.
@GGunnelsPCT Presumption of innocence, right to a speedy trial by peers, no corruption of blood, no bills of attainder...there's no need to pretend there isn't a whole coherent body of thinking that goes behind that.
@GGunnelsPCT That is correct -- they sold out the Constitution to win a presidential election. It was shameful.
@GGunnelsPCT There's no stone tablet, but there's a very clear idea of what I referred to, and centuries of work that went into it from Magna Carta to our Constitution. There's no need to be obtuse about that.
@GGunnelsPCT And I think it would be a big mistake to keep that ugly, shameful history alive by meting out justice based on identities and not facts, in betrayal of centuries of thought that went into our founding ideals.
@GGunnelsPCT On the contrary, what you are describing is a very deliberate effort to frustrate the 13th and 14th amdts to the Constitution. We turned a blind eye for a century to our shame -- partly because Democrats wanted to keep their party together.
@GGunnelsPCT I think the right answer is to live up to those ideals. And we've made significant progress in the last 60 years that no reasonable person can deny.
@GGunnelsPCT I told you what I meant. Now you're quibbling.		If you think the answer to past injustice is simply to be unjust toward new groups of people, then you should come out and say it.
That's about the right ratio, don't you think? https://t.co/KnPaYCrf4Q
@GGunnelsPCT The fact that we don't always live up to the ideals behind the centuries-long intellectual tradition of our founding is obviously baked into the cake. We still hold up equal justice under law, no corruption of bood, etc. as our national ideal and a universal ideal.

@cosmohouck Okay, I only meant that it's certainly not harmonious with "equal justice under law" and the other ideas that we claim to live by.
@cosmohouck Fair. But I think most people who embrace Classical Liberal ideals of justice would argue that we embrace them because we think they're universal, not just because they're customary in this part of the world.
@samwilkinson oookaaay
@cosmohouck Yes, our own republican flavor of the common law -- blind justice, equal justice under law, no corruption of blood, etc. That's the tradition.		I didn't say we always lived up to it.
Some people think cases of right and wrong can be decided not based on facts but based on group identities. 		It's a stupid idea, alien to our traditions and destructive of fairness and justice. The burden of proof is squarely on anyone who would argue for such a system.

@CheerTheAnthem So either way, the nuclear option would help dems for two years at most. And that's how it turned out.
@CheerTheAnthem The worst case scenario for Republicans seemed to be that they'd hold Congress with another Dem president. But I don't remember there being much respect for Hillary as a candidate.
@EverydayRegan I can't say what might have happened, but I know that when the opportunity came up, they didn't do it and Reid did.
@EverydayRegan They had the chance to do it when Bush was president. You remember Miguel Estrada?
Thanks to Harry Reid, Trump will easily surpass both Obama and Bush on confirmations before his first midterm.
Main reason the nuclear option was so short-sighted was that as of 2013, it seemed natural that an R would win the presidency in 2016, and Dems were not looking good to keep the Senate in 2014. This was all before Trump was running.
This is true about Obama's last two years. It was payback for the nuclear option. Far as he was concerned, Obama had gotten his judges already. 		In the end, the move left Obama with almost exactly the same number of judicial appointments, district and circuit, as Bush. https://t.co/aQwUw9slJc

@young_maymay Yes, this was where our conversation began. Young (overwhelmingly white btw) protestors who are anti-Kavanaugh, not a mob. Tea Partiers? Charlottesville.
@young_maymay I didn't believe it myself. Now I do. And people believe it across political lines and everyone's talking about not about whether it exists but how can we fix it.
@young_maymay I agree that people don't care enough. Look at the awakening we've had recently about police behavior. It took cameras in everyone's hands for it to happen, but it's happened.
@young_maymay If you really believed that, you wouldn't act like the test of whether you're good or Charlottesville is whether you vote Dem. You just wouldn't.
@young_maymay I didn't ask you about the merits of these issues. I'm just pointing out that you have an enormous blind spot about the political issues that actually motivate people. It's not even a blind spot, it's more like you can only see in one spot.
@young_maymay As long as everyone who disagrees with you is Charlottesville, it's not even possible to have a conversation. Meanwhile, we've actually made massive progress since the Jim Crow era, and the last people who imposed it as adults are nearly all dead.
@young_maymay Do we start facing it head-on only when we embrace high taxes and abortion and radical secularism and all of the other unrelated issues you're trying to roll into the category of racism? People think  &amp; vote differently from you for all kinds of reasons. Please accept that.
@young_maymay The small and (over the decades) rapidly declining number of racist white people who DO want you dead judge you based on a whole bunch of things you don't control. Our culture has learned over time that not imitating them in this is a good idea.
@young_maymay I don't pretend it doesn't exist. And again, you're not being fair to millions of people you're just judging by the seat of your pants. They didn't choose their color or where to be born, and any  of them who vote differently from you suddenly "want you dead." Ridiculous.
@young_maymay "The same people." According to whom? Do you draw that equivalence in order to convince me, or yourself?
@young_maymay You keep assuming, without evidence, that anyone who disagrees with you can just be equated to those detestable  racists. Do you see why most reasonable people might find that a problem?

@Trumpsterfireus @brithume The problem is that someone has to apportion a number of seats every ten years, and someone has to set the number.
@N2332L @brithume @Gusdog481 The reasons why we have equal representation in the Senate? Yes, because of the Great Compromise. We likely wouldn't have a nation today otherwise.
@Trumpsterfireus @brithume Who falls into that category here? I don't think you understand the conversation.

@LynneReed19 @McCormackJohn That number in RI -- divide it by two, because it has two reps. Now compare the result to WY, ND, MT -- any other state for that matter.
@philmonomer Again, you're wrong, because this disparity was there already in 2010 when the Census was conducted. Look it up.		And I never said this had to do w the senate, just with malapportionment.
@dropoutnation It's not rare. That's my point. It's not, and your treating it like its rare doesn't make it so. 		As for bigots, I'm more than happy to condemn people's use of any racial slur, concealed or otherwise.
@philmonomer Or South Dakota. More than 300k per rep.
@philmonomer Difference of about 500k per rep.
@philmonomer Okay, compare it to Montana then.
@dropoutnation Winston Churchill is the argument, and cases like his -- including the morons who wanted to remove Abe Lincoln's statue. This happens every day. Meanwhile, you're arguing something completely unrelated.
@philmonomer OK. It's still the most overrepresented of all 50.
@philmonomer @Heminator Maybe 150k by now, haven't looked at the census estimates.
@philmonomer @Heminator It's about 100k fewer, IIRC.
@dropoutnation You are now arguing with somene else's straw man. I made clear that that isn't my position in this thread.
@dropoutnation You are avoiding the argument. This stuff, just like the Kelly business, is happening every day in this country. We'll be tearing down statues of Obama in a few years because he wasn't sufficiently pro-trans.

@dropoutnation Sorry, but you can't define your way to justifying what they just did to Scott Kelly. There's a big difference between political correctness on the one hand, and decency and manners on the other.
Both extremes are bad. We should always be ready to apologize when wrong and tell jerks who complain about things like this to go to hell. There's nothing inconsistent about that.
Personally, my apology for quoting Churchill goes like this: 		"I'm sorry if I offended you, because what I was actually trying to do was to make you less ignorant, and I can already see it didn't work."
Two extremes: Trump strikes a sharp contrast as someone unwilling to apologize or go back on anything, even when he's completely and uncontestably wrong. That's because so many public figures are powerless, sniveling cowards in the face of PC culture. Eg: https://t.co/a5kj40kXXu

@sinkspur You just claimed he never admitted to being drunk, so I think maybe you should stop moving the goalposts.
@cmercury25 They're saying they don't know, just like you did.
@sinkspur He admitted to drinking too much, which sounds like the same thing to me. I think you're getting your facts from someone's talking points.
@sinkspur If you can't understand someone being upset in the circumstances, then I don't really think your opinion is worth anything. Also, I though this was about the veracity of an accusation of a crime, not about his personal life.
In short, they haven't even made an actual claim that he has ever drunk to the point where he didn't know where he'd been. All they claim, literally, is that they saw him drunk.

@trogdor8768 @NateSilver538 Not the same thing! They don't even make the assertion!

And as someone who likely drinks more than Kavanaugh, I'd like to point out that there's a world of difference between being visibly very drunk and blacking out.
This WaPo piece claims Kavanaugh lied when he said he had never blacked out drinking. But the authors then present no evidence and in fact make no assertion that they ever saw him black out from drinking. https://t.co/GcP9H6DxSO

@SweGringo @Dr_Dharma_Bum @TheRickWilson To say he was "duped" overstates it. I think after he won he thought the Russia business was just a way of people minimizing his beautiful glorious yuge victory, so he threw fits about the Russia allegations/investigation.
@jgge123 @Dr_Dharma_Bum @SweGringo I did see that, one danger of giving the executive too much latitude. 		But I'll add, it's amazing how many people knew that Trump was going to do that a year in advance, and even before Congress passed the sanctions in the first place.

@KevBaile @TheRickWilson For it to be illegal, that's all that comes to mind right now. 		Can you think of any other illegal assistance he might have received?
@KevBaile @TheRickWilson So they gave him campaign money? We should be able to figure that out.
@bruceymonkey @Hillbilly_Matt @TheRickWilson It's in their interest to have us stop producing oil to the extent possible. Our fracking is killing them, and our exports will bury them.

@Hillbilly_Matt @TheRickWilson Without question that's the real concern, and I'm guessing this investigation will reveal a lot about that and not much about Trump.
@TheRickWilson What if I just don't think he's smart enough to engineer this nebulous international conspiracy that no one seems able to pin down?

@FloMartinSec I won't bother you more, just can't pass up how feigned concern for equal franchise disappears for some people when you show them a red map.
@FloMartinSec The states formed the union. That's why we call it a...union. Of states. United states, even.
@FloMartinSec It's not as if God created the USA and we showed up one day and carved it into 50 arbitrary pieces.
@FloMartinSec Not really. The USA is definitely a human creation, if I don't make another true statement all day I'll still have that.
@FloMartinSec So is the union they joined together to create. What does that prove?
@FloMartinSec They can be as sparse as you like, they're still 48% of the population. Basing "electoral calculus" on GDP sounds kind of Randian.
@FloMartinSec Considering I counted those states up based on their populations, not sure how you think I missed that.
@FloMartinSec "Those states barely contribute a quarter of the nation's output...Maybe time for a new electoral calculus." 		Seems to mean what it says.
@FloMartinSec So you don't actually believe in the consequences of what you said? That's fine, it was an ugly idea.
@FloMartinSec If we're going to judge people by their contribution to GDP then I think you have to carry it through to its logical end.

@chrislhayes @bdomenech @guypbenson @AmyOtto8 People said such things about the Missouri Compromise.
In 2005, after they won both houses of the state legislature, Republicans made #GA06 less Republican to improve margins in surrounding seats
Newt had to move to the new #GA06, squeaked by in the primary.
Gerrymandering complaints about #GA06 are similarly ignorant of history. Dems created it in 1991 to pack GOP votes &amp; kill off Newt Gingrich.
@ReganWV Well, or at least not the current partisan alignment. It's geometrically offensive.
@ReganWV Speaking of which, WV's map looks insane, although I doubt it's due to partisanship.

@dabbobean @FreedomDefined1 Didn't change that much in four years. Nor were the demographics different between those voting for congress and president on the same day.
@FreedomDefined1 Half of voters were suburban. Not all suburbs are alike. #GA06 is 1 of only 6 seats Republicans hold where a majority of adults have degrees
@FreedomDefined1 My suspicion is that it will often come down to the % of adults with college degrees in any given district.
@FreedomDefined1 Not the point. The point is that you can't really compare the two years fairly.
@FreedomDefined1 The Republicans made it more competitive on purpose, to serve their own interests.
@FreedomDefined1 Dems created the seat in 1991 to pack in Republicans. Rs redistricted in 2005 and again in 2011 with the aim of shoring up other seats.
@FreedomDefined1 It's not the same seat as it was in 2004.
@FreedomDefined1 There was a trade-off to Trump's working-class pickup. The question is, why did Dems fail to exploit this in #GA06?
@FreedomDefined1 Also worth noting that GOP incumbents in both districts did fine. Comstock actually had a competitive race, did 10 points better than Trump.
@FreedomDefined1 From a 23-point win to a 1-point win in the same seat in 4 years is not a trend, it's an avalanche.
@FreedomDefined1 Romney did quite well in the current #GA06, squeaked out a win in #VA10. Trump underperformed him in both.
@FreedomDefined1 No Republican-held seats in MA.
GOP holds 14 seats with &gt;40% college grads carried by Hillary. Four others carried by Trump by less than 5 points. https://t.co/nM1GHBBKJE

@wilsonkanaday Then Nathan Deal switched parties after the 1994 election, and the entire state's realignment was completed by 2002.
@wilsonkanaday Newt instead moved to the new Sixth, scraped by in the primary, and became speaker two elections later.
@wilsonkanaday The secondary goal was to get rid of Newt, who represented a totally different district, by drawing him in with a popular Dem incumbent.
@wilsonkanaday It happened after the 1990 Census. The goal was to make sure there was only one district in the state where a Republican could win.

@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes The real question is, should you gratuitously kill a baby in utero if it can survive whatever treatment is necessary to save the mother.
@adinaINdc @Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Some forms of contraception might work as aborifacients, but that's not what we were discussing.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes And again, I'd like to emphasize that abortion is not about sex, it is about killing a person.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes It has to do with the purpose of sacramental marriage, not with the completely separate issue of taking human life.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Neither I nor the Catholic Church nor anyone who believes in science believes that contraception takes a human life as abortion does.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Yes. I also support reform of the police to prevent officer-involved shootings, and I don't want to ban contraception.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Sorry, but I believe in science &amp; I'm not prepared to accept a "fully formed" standard that would exclude my 5 and 7 year old from humanity.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes It isn't the baby's fault, and he or she gets no choice in your personally chosen death penalty. You see no problem with that?
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Again, we have no problem telling women or men to not do all kinds of things that harm others. This is one of them. It's really quite basic.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Evidently you haven't. Even so, it's a bit twisted to use Syrian refugees as an excuse for looking the other way at killing.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes Even so, this atrocity goes on closer to home &amp; our responsibility if we fail to act is greater than our failing to solve all world problems

@Rev_Nev_Lewis @larry47601 @JoeNBC @nytimes As a former fetus, I have strong opinions about the use of emotionalized anecdotes to justify killing. Killing is anti-life.

Of course, creative redistricting also increases the chances you'll lose ground in a bad year. See, eg, the Dems' 2002 gerrymander of GA
@mitrebox Lots of people remember there's an election because they get a mailer. And CLF did a lot more than mailers.
At least for your own party. You try to create 80-point victories for your opponents so that you can win in more places with 55 percent.
Where used, "gerrymandering" creates seats that are MORE competitive, not less. You "waste" votes when you win by 80 points
People have this backwards conception of "gerrymandering." In much of America "gerrymandering" would be required to draw a competitive seat

The first two cloture votes failed, 55-45. The third one succeeded, 55-45.
Believe it or not, the Senate's reconsideration did not apparently result in anyone's vote changing.
@uncriticalsimon They basically viewed Hobby Lobby more in the Jewish deli category. A business with a (in this case explicit) Christian ethic.
You might call it the "nuclear option," but I've always though of it as the Senate going to "ludicrous speed."
55-45. The motion is not agreed to. Sen. McConnell moves to reconsider. Now they vote again.
@uncriticalsimon I assume that if there ever were such a case, the fact that Marriott never claimed to operate under any religious principles would come up.
@uncriticalsimon Again, that might seem good to you, but it isn't the law. (Also, Marriott might be a no, but the fact that it's a corp wouldn't be why.)
@uncriticalsimon No, and they would have prevailed on that question if it had been. The opposite position leads to absurd conclusions.
@uncriticalsimon Again, both parties and seven of nine justices thought the Greens get to make that call.
@uncriticalsimon What HHS conceded, and 7 justices agreed, is that its corporate status alone doesn't preclude a RFRA claim.
@uncriticalsimon Why is it irrelevant? Not only did seven justices disagree w that statement, but the Obama admin conceded in argument that it's not true.
Here we go -- the last-ever chance to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee.
@uncriticalsimon I don't know the case, but corps exercise 1A rights every day and you can't have NYT v. Sullivan without that.

@websterandrews2 @ReedReports @DFBetz Sex is good for marriage, the CC doesn't view it as a failure each time it doesn't produce offspring.
@websterandrews2 @ReedReports @DFBetz Not so. What's sinful is deliberately frustrating the possibility. It's ok to have sex when infertile.
@ReedReports @websterandrews2 @DFBetz The part about it not having to do w "babies not conceived" is complete enough for this conversation.
@websterandrews2 @DFBetz @ReedReports Because it removes sex from the context of marriage. Not because of babies not born as a result.
@DFBetz Yes, it's a bad idea to watch Monty Python for the moral theology.
@ReedReports And yet what you say is still not the Church's teaching about why it's a sin.
@ReedReports That is not at all the reasoning for why it's a sin. Go read your catechism.
@HLM915 He didn't say anything about illegal immigrants. He's arguing for white nationalism.
Given that literally no one rejects the science of conception today -- except arguably some die-hard abortion-lovers -- it doesn't work.

@Capitalics This is not a subject you seem to know much about, that's fine, but please stop trying to 'splain me about it.
@Capitalics Any catechized Catholic understands what's wrong with that email. It describes efforts to subvert the Church &amp; its teachings.
@Capitalics Took it seriously enough to found and fund the Potemkin activist groups he mentions in the email.
@Capitalics That is an overthrow. Every Catholic knows what it means, whether they support or oppose.
@Capitalics Also, "Catholic Spring" is what it is, no sugarcoating that.
@Capitalics Not who he was talking with. Try reading it sometime.
@JZmirak How often has a U.S. president made a Pope resign? It's an explosive and unfounded charge of something unprecedented.
@Capitalics And of course it would be no better if everyone on that email thread had also been baptized Catholic.
@Capitalics No, he wasn't. He was emailing with a non-Catholic about his (unsuccessful) attempts to subvert the church in the U.S.
