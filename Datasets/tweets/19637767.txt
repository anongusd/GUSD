Policy Matters Ohio has some sound budget ideas that deserve to get traction - help for local governments and public transit, and a boost for the EITC. Amidst the current surpluses, surely these things are possible.
Interesting to see Governor DeWine answer a question on the death penalty with great hesitancy. I think the hesitancy is right. Court rulings are troubling, DNA testing changes the game, life without parole is a solid alternative. It’s time for a broad reassessment of the issue.

In 1959-60, the OSU Buckeyes were the highest-scoring basketball team in the country and won the NCAA tourney easily. Which of these players was not set to be a starter on that team until an injury to Dick Furry?
So here we go. During the campaign, I pushed for a bonded finance package to support infrastructure without new taxes. DeWine pledged not to raise taxes but said I would. Now first thing out of the box he is proposing a tax increase. And he calls it being “honest” with voters.

CFPB is proposing to unwind the core part of its payday loan rule - that the lender must reasonably assess a borrower’s ability to repay before making a loan. It’s a bad move that will hurt the hardest-hit consumers. It should be and will be subject to a stiff legal challenge.
Good enforcement action filed by CFPB, pending court approval, would bar a group of international payday lenders from ever advertising, making, or collecting on consumer loans in the U.S. And borrowers on loans they had made illegally under state laws would be off the hook.

I had not mentioned on this Twitter feed that I am working on a book about my time at the CFPB. The story of what we did with this new agency for consumers, and why, is part of a broader story about how we can make government work for the middle class, not just those at the top.
As the shutdown is a tribute to government NOT working, the CFPB completed its 5-year review of the mortgage rules we wrote to protect the economy from another meltdown. Despite industry claims, the report shows the rules did not lead to higher costs or less credit. They worked!
I appreciate the diversity of Ohio’s new Cabinet. Pledges for support of early childhood learning and to address the opioid crisis are important, as is the need for us to monitor them and demand that progress be made. The people need and deserve it.

A very reasonable and practical decision by the new CFPB director to scrap most aspects of the costly agency name change. Time to stop with the gimmicky PR and put the focus back on substantive work for consumers and honest businesses.
So the big tax bill piled about $1.5 trillion onto the federal deficit, much of it to big corporations. Where did this money go? We now know that companies paid out about $1 trillion in stock buybacks. So did it trickle down to the middle class? Curses - foiled again!
I’m not one who takes his bearings on an Administration by the stock market indexes. But it’s certainly not healthy to have things be so dependent on the whims and pronouncements of one individual rather than on economic fundamentals.
Here's my post on Facebook today where I wanted to make sure to convey my gratitude and appreciation to everyone who pitched in to help us with the campaign this year. My deepest thanks to you all. https://t.co/SgNge6bJT7

More than ever, we still need to find ways to reduce gun violence in Ohio. Last year we had a record number of gun deaths since federal officials have been keeping these statistics. The rate of gun homicides is higher than the national average, as is the rate of gun suicides.
New numbers out recently showed that infant mortality declined in Ohio last year, but the rates continued to rise in the African-American community. This is unacceptable in 21st century America. We highlighted this issue during the campaign and it needs more focused attention.
According to section 5.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, “The ‘O’ represents the ‘O’ in ‘Ohio’ and suggests the state’s nickname, the buckeye state.” So we can give some leniency here. https://t.co/LLhhvYqLxx
It will be good to see Maxine Waters as Chair of the House Financial Services Committee. She takes no guff from anyone and cares deeply about protecting consumers. She will be able to call both Mulvaney and the new director to testify, subject to her comprehensive oversight.
Mulvaney failed to see how deception and fraud undermine consumer choice and markets. This is a law-and-order issue. Root out unlawful practices so consumers and good businesses can thrive. Research shows that was 90+% of our enforcement actions. Just let people do their jobs!
Mick Mulvaney's ideology got in the way of facts and he had a deep bias toward his past and perhaps future contributors. He never understood what consumer protection is all about. He talked about enforcement but rarely did anything about it. . . .
The new director now has the chance to exert her own independence. Mick Mulvaney never could, nor did he ever shed his political bias as he hunted for headlines to show that he still was an enemy of how the CFPB was serving consumers (that is, all of the American people).
I see the Senate has confirmed Kathy Kraninger as CFPB Director. Like me, she had not run an agency before. Like me, she will find talented and dedicated people who will make her proud. Like me, she will see the good, bad, and ugly and have to figure out what to do about it all.
Thursday Trivia:		Q: What does the O on the Ohio flag stand for?		(No Googling, no cheating!)
Happy first night of Hannukah, bringing welcome illumination to all the world.
To get on top of it, we must have more treatment and less prison. Drug courts help. Narcan helps. Medicaid expansion that doesn’t throw people off the rolls with work requirements helps. But we must crack down on fentanyl and get it out of Ohio. It’s causing most of the deaths.
Federal officials have now confirmed that Ohio was the worst state in the nation for opioid deaths last year other than West Virginia - more than 5,100. Our rate is 46 deaths per 100,000 people and the national average is 21. We are dealing poorly with this scourge.
The tradition of flying the flag at half-staff upon the death of eminent Americans could hardly be better suited to George H.W. Bush, veteran, patriot, and public leader.
George H.W. Bush was a patriot who rooted for our country above all and did not see the divide across the aisle as a source of personal feeling or practical difficulty. He did much to produce a kinder, gentler nation, as he envisioned.
Life expectancy, which has risen in the U.S. pretty steadily for 60 years, declined again last year. Opioid deaths, esp fentanyl, and rising suicide rates are the main causes - with suicide rates for men more than tripling those for women. We need to get America back on track.
One question that raises is whether Ohio is going to keep going down the path of more income tax cuts. That is starving us of money for key investments and killing local services. It really is time for a reset and a rethink.
Open-ended tax breaks are just a giveaway. So if you’re hoping for better policy outcomes, that’s all you’re doing - just hoping. That’s what we see with Congress’s $1.5 trillion tax bill. Give the money away, bust the budget, and hope for the best. But we deserve better.
I’m quite exercised about GM and its new hit to Lordstown. We recall how @realDonaldTrump promised to bring the jobs back. His budget-busting tax bill was sold as ramping up domestic investment. Then he supposedly improved NAFTA. So now we ask, Where’s the beef?
GM just announced plans that seriously jeopardize the future of the Lordstown plant. Donald Trump and Mike DeWine owe it to the people of the Valley to step up and fight for these jobs, as I pledged to do. This is an acid test of whether they care about Ohio workers.
Even as I sent a message of Thanksgiving for all your help this year, I was deeply sad. My dear friend Steve - we met on the 2d day of college - battled cancer all year. He slipped away from us in the wee hours yesterday, leaving a big hole in many lives much too soon, esp mine.
Happy Thanksgiving! Though it's easy to dwell on our hardships and losses - I am reminded today of how much I have to be grateful for. I'm blessed by friends and family and am so thankful to all of you and your support over this past year.
For years now, Thanksgiving has been my favorite holiday. It is all about showing gratitude and appreciation for others and recognizing that whatever you lack is less important than what you have. Giving thanks makes each of us a better person.
Lame duck sessions are never good. Often there are scores to settle and people on their way out feel no responsibility for the consequences. Right now the legislature seems obsessed with making their points against Gov. Kasich. Not clear how that serves Ohio’s future.
So I mostly took the weekend off from tweeting, and I must say it felt really weird! I have done 5-10 tweets per day for almost the last year, which is likely too heavy a pace outside a hot campaign, but I’ll find a new rhythm for now. Bear with me!

So many priorities for attention from this campaign: health care, education, jobs, clean energy, the environment, criminal justice reform, gun violence, voting rights. And now in the lame duck session: further loosening gun laws and restricting a woman’s right to choose. Really?
Statehouse rally today for H.B. 160. Passing it is the right thing for Ohio. Why should anyone lose their job because they’re gay or straight? Or their housing? I can’t see any good reason. It hurts Ohio business and the caliber of our society. Let’s move forward with a Vote!
First responders and firefighters in these situations are brilliant. A combination of volunteers and professionals, with many pulled from elsewhere, they just come together, focus, and get the job done to save lives and protect people’s homes. The very best America has to offer.

100 years ago today our forebears finished the immediate task of saving Europe for democracy. But then leaders took a narrow and punitive view of the future and ended up squandering the peace. It’s all worthy of reflection.
After a week of politics, today is for those who serve our country. They make it possible for us to have our political fights, even as we share our core principles. Important for us all to remember that.
At times in life you get a gut check - this week was a big one - that tumbles you back to default mode. Am I happy or sad? Trusting or cynical? Broadly generous or narrowly selfish? And then the challenge: wherever life has deposited you, find a way back to where you should be.
On the Medicaid expansion, we need to watch anti-government bureaucrats in DC, who may try to undermine it stealthily. And we must check the legislature here if they keep up their prior resistance, but I assume they at least had their ears open during the campaign. Right? Hello?
The House flip also likely cements the Medicaid expansion funding for all the states around the country that already have it and are benefiting greatly in terms of better health outcomes and reduced overall costs for their people. And may allow it to take root in new states.
The change in control of the House of Representatives in Washington has an important consequence for Ohio: it cements, as a legislative matter, the Medicaid expansion that is so needed here. The funding for it will not now go away or be reduced. Thumbs up on that!
And what would be achieved by that divisive maneuver, of bringing forward a right-to-work proposal? Just more backward movement in this state that we don’t need. We will waste much goodwill and resources and time, all for nothing.
We had enough discussion of “right to work” in this campaign that it should be quite clear to our leaders that it has no place in Ohio. If they perpetrate the grotesque fraud of trying to cram it down after all, the people will rise up to squash it, as they just did in Missouri.
The American Federation of Labor was founded in Columbus in 1886--and it merged with the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1955 to form the AFL-CIO, the longest lasting labor federation in the U.S. https://t.co/Z1C0xgHO3f
More voters cast their ballots in this midterm - on both sides of the aisle, and in between - than ever before in the history of Ohio. So nobody needs to fear higher turnout. We should tear down obstacles to voting and make it easier for everyone’s voice to be heard.
When I think about everyone who knocked doors, made phone calls, gave money, or took part in any of the campaigns this year, I am deeply moved and utterly grateful to each of you. Your devotion to our democracy gives me hope and makes me proud to be an American.
And in that spirit, here is today’s Thursday Trivia:		Q: The American Federation of Labor was founded in 1886 in which Ohio city?		(No Googling, no cheating!)
Here’s a special shout-out to everyone across Ohio who took the time, whether occasionally or regularly, to answer our Thursday Trivia questions. YOU were the nerds we needed to keep us going. Thank you!
At least 12 people are dead in a college bar in southern California, including a sheriff’s deputy. When do we stop prattling on about mental health and wake up about the need to take action? Ohio has no immunity from this horror. The list of tragedies is long and growing.
It occurred to me that I am now freed from the constraints of running for or holding public office. So I can speak more naturally now about things that matter to Ohio and our nation, and share my own more light-hearted thoughts. You can pay attention or not, just as you choose.
As the campaign comes to an end, let me give one more shout-out to my running mate, Betty Sutton. She put her heart and soul into our partnership, and she was quite impressive at all times. I thank her warmly and profusely for all she did with and for me.
Win or lose, Tucker still greeted me when I came home with the same love as always. And my family bathed me in love as well. Thank goodness for them! The world continues to turn, regardless of my own personal disappointment. Yet I regret the things I will not now do for Ohio.
I have always known that politics is a hazardous enterprise. It can either fill your heart or break it, depending on what can seem to be just a sudden turn of a coin. It has gone both ways for me at times, sometimes unexpectedly, which can be hardest of all.
I saw many candidates fight really hard this year - including myself and my running mate and our great team - and I saw some win and some lose. As Mike DeWine said to me last night, “politics is a strange business.” Yet even with its flaws, it is at the heart of our democracy.
As he so often did, Abraham Lincoln said it best: “It hurts too much to laugh, and I’m too old to cry.” Very tough loss last night. I sent my congratulations to Governor-Elect DeWine, and send my continuing love to all of Ohio.
Congratulations to governor-elect @MikeDeWine. Though our campaign fell short tonight, we proved that our collective voice is strong. And I’m hopeful because of the millions of Ohioans who supported our campaign. Thank you!

Spent some pizza time with volunteers and field staff in Cleveland and also in Akron. They are Fired Up and Ready to Go knock on some doors. Find an event near you! https://t.co/0zGDU498Fm https://t.co/JWLwBWCTwx
Deeply glad to have my friend @JoeBiden back in Ohio today. He’s gone above and beyond. We’ll be streaming live from Parma Heights starting at 11am - and you can watch the live stream on my facebook page at https://t.co/P2zWaAWivi
From yesterday’s GOTV rally at OSU with @elizabethforma. So many people were wearing the Nerds for Cordray T-shirt. We loved it! https://t.co/ZWT6ckXpzp
Just four days left. We ALL have our sleeves rolled up and need to keep working. Join us for a volunteer shift by signing up at https://t.co/70t10wx8xe https://t.co/QeOuI5UfzD
Elizabeth Warren was the one who recommended me to President Obama to serve as the nation’s first consumer watchdog. She grew up in a working family and knows a thing or two about fighting for working families. Now Ohio needs a fighter for working families. https://t.co/8YqvCAHo1E
John Kasich regularly stands up to Donald Trump, but @MikeDeWine hasn’t shown the courage to do so. It seems he fears Trump’s wrath and won’t stand up to him even when what he’s doing hurts Ohioans, like messing around with our health care. https://t.co/zbTu53NhzI
Nothing “trivial” about this election. I’m running for governor to protect your health care and fight for working Ohioans. https://t.co/oyPL8q9fMm
DeWine has shown his 42 years in politics this week. He’s hoping Trump will save his sinking campaign, but won’t commit to standing on stage with him. In Cincinnati recently DeWine was in the parking lot but wouldn’t go inside and stand with Donald Trump. Embarrassing!
A warm hello to my doppelgänger Will Bezbatchenko, who played me on Jeopardy for Halloween. Ingenious! Hats off to you! https://t.co/Vtg01Szk0D
Scenes from yesterday at @OhioU and @ohiostate. Young people know that their future is at stake in this election and they are fired up to make their voices heard. If our young people vote, we will change Ohio! ou https://t.co/DVgThvwBmn
Thank you @stein_405 for your support. Early voting is still open! Vote today, tomorrow, Sunday or Monday and then you can knock doors on Tuesday! https://t.co/vrxUbTyvoE
The answer is 7. Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Warren Harding were all born in Ohio. Some people try to count William Henry Harrison, but he was actually born in Virginia. https://t.co/5eUhTCs06i
Tucker celebrating his birthday by doing what he does best: just mellowing out. https://t.co/xE2p9eOjO4
Proud to have support of the Teamsters and many other labor unions. Labor is one of our strong foundations in Ohio - and @BettySutton and I will fight for working people as the next Gov and Lt. Gov, including fighting to protect the pensions they earned. https://t.co/0BpY4PXsMm
All along, @MikeDeWine has backed trade deals disastrous for Ohio. His approach hollowed out the middle class here as we saw low-paying jobs with no benefits replace high-paying jobs with benefits. He even opposed trade assistance to those who got hurt.	https://t.co/nzCcEIQ4yE
You heard the man. Now go to https://t.co/n9tg98IKOk and make a plan to VOTE early or on Election Day! https://t.co/NvxZdzsaqg
My partner @BettySutton passionately supported protections for women and for all people with pre-existing conditions as she worked on the ACA in the Congress. She still does. And so do I! https://t.co/rswZxqwHN3
My partner @BettySutton and I are proud to have the support of @Ohio_pro_ffs @fire_330 and Fire Fighters all around Ohio. You all can vote today, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday! Find a good time around your long shifts! https://t.co/teJQxGcEmB
“DeWine indeed joined other GOP attorneys general in unsuccessfully suing to scuttle the [ACA] DeWine said nothing at the time about the need to maintain coverage for pre-existing conditions. He now says he always has supported such protections.” Call B.S.	https://t.co/Y8KkMwq3zk
A great piece about what we’re all fighting for on November 6th. “DeWine is a look to the past. Richard Cordray is a look to the future with new ideas. Cordray is someone who will fight for all Ohioans.” Absolutely right! 	https://t.co/3gURtzDsBF
"5 more days - we need everyone to vote, everyone to volunteer! 5 more days!" - @elizabethforma
"We're in this fight because we believe that no one who is trying to get an education should be crushed by student loan debts." - @elizabethforma
"Rich Cordray and I think its time that government works for everybody else - that's why we're in this fight." - @elizabethforma
"@MikeDeWine is fighting for the very people for whom government already works - the rich and the powerful." -@elizabethforma
"When @MikeDeWine became attorney general, it was his pride and joy, his first day in office, to say 'we're going to take away health care from Ohioans because we're going to wipe out the Affordable Care Act'"-RC
"Who do you stand up to and who do you stand up for? In Ohio we need leaders who are going to stand up for the working class and middle class of this state." - RC
"We cannot go backward on health care. And make no mistake -- health care is on the ballot." -@bettysutton
Way to go guys! So proud of you! People of EVERY age have influence if they just choose to exert it. https://t.co/8dF9xU9pRn
“Factual missteps” is a fancy way to put it—I’d say it more plainly: Pence &amp; DeWine are lying about their claimed support for protecting people with pre-existing conditions, even as they take action to undermine or nullify those protections. 	https://t.co/Y8KkMwq3zk
Q: It’s the final #ThursdayTrivia before Election Day! So, how many US presidents were actually born in Ohio? 		(No Googling, no cheating!)
Looking forward to not one but TWO stops with my friend and powerful advocate for working people, Senator @Elizabethforma! Tune into livestreams of our events at 10:15 am and 1:00 pm on my Facebook page: https://t.co/P2zWaAWivi for all the action.
Sobering and poignant words from my close friend Harry Litman:	https://t.co/84a0sIPBfD
DeWine has backed every poorly negotiated trade deal that has hollowed out the middle class in Ohio, trading good-paying jobs with benefits for lower-paying jobs without benefits. He’s always had a corporate agenda, not an agenda for working people. https://t.co/E9RiCtiNEU
DeWine’s spent a lifetime fighting against equal rights for LGBTQ Ohioans - I’ve spent a lifetime fighting for them and for less hatred and more love. Ohio should be a welcoming state for all. It's the right thing to do and it’s best for our communities.	https://t.co/ubvwv9axuB
In our regular game at the local church, I get my shots off and make my share on occasion -- though not quite like seeing @klaythompson go off for 52 with 14 3-pointers in Chicago. https://t.co/g1zKQ0NbdW
“Nothing in DeWine’s recent past suggests he would be the type of leader that Ohio, and the nation, so desperately needs….In both reality and theory, Cordray is the better candidate in this election, as the gubernatorial debates have tended to prove.” https://t.co/d0n8qCABHL
Voting makes you feel powerful like Superwoman!!! https://t.co/tAj7MBtznI
Happy Halloween! https://t.co/S4b3Ak3ql2
No, they won't - they never have. @MikeDeWine fought for years to let big insurance companies take health coverage away from people because those corporate interests have funded his campaigns. https://t.co/feCZdYFYr8
What a thrill! Memories of a challenging year as I saw Betty and my names on the ballot and voted for #OHGov today. As Teddy Roosevelt said, “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty.” A special friend came with me to vote too. https://t.co/Ke16yMKnKN
Proud to have the growing support of young voters. “Because of plans to act on healthcare, opioids and gun laws, we have chosen to support Cordray and Sutton for Gov and Lt. Gov of Ohio. We believe they offer the best plan to support and protect Ohio.” https://t.co/MibCsV0Yap
Happy Halloween! To borrow a phrase from my friend @BarackObama: “Don’t boo, vote!”
Wall Street banks and financial institutions have invested millions in @MikeDeWine’s campaigns. That’s because he always puts the wealthy ahead of working families in Ohio. Even now, he wants more and more tax cuts for the rich. https://t.co/d2aLVRxR2A
And RFK goes on to say: “We must admit the vanity of our false distinctions among men and learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of all…. We must recognize that this short life can neither be ennobled nor enriched by hatred or revenge.”
A friend shared this RFK quote with me: “When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues,... then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies.”
As so often happens at this point in the election cycle, the eyes of the nation once again are turning to Ohio. And as Joe Biden said, as Ohio goes, so goes the nation. Let’s get to work! https://t.co/IdvscpHGCr
Had fun with my friend @JoeBiden and my partner @BettySutton in Youngstown yesterday. His remarks on the state of our politics and our society today were refreshing, and his call for us all to vote and make our voices heard was resounding. https://t.co/teTGYDYq0s
The list of school districts that distrust @MikeDeWine to handle the investigation into his epic ECOT scandal is growing. DeWine should not now be investigating a scandal that generated political contributions to him while he looked the other way. 	https://t.co/nBfazHyPm0
To Lee Cormany and Harley Hamilton at OSU, VP Biden and I thought the milkshakes were great and could taste the love in them as the extra-special ingredient that made them so good!	https://t.co/UZdfdayPkd
“We found that it is misleading to blame Cordray for job losses or tax increases during his tenure because he had the responsibility for neither.” Also the recession was national, not just Ohio. Another term for @MikeDeWine’s ad would be “big fat lie.”	https://t.co/82M4JgoLL9
.@realdonaldtrump thinks fighting for working people by putting $12 billion back in their pockets is “destroying a government agency.” Apparently @MikeDeWine agrees. That’s because neither of them cares about working people, they only care about themselves. https://t.co/cxWxf3h6aS
Thank you @LepLeppla for knocking on doors for this great team. And yes, early voting is still open - all the way to Election Day! Note, 8:00-7:00 the weekdays of this week, 8:00-4:00 on Saturday, 1:00-5:00 Sunday, and 8:00-2:00 Monday. https://t.co/wVAP9CyQQz
Gotta love those Fall Colors - especially the Red, White &amp; Blue of Cordray-Sutton signs! https://t.co/id2tAfs2Dt
Thank you @realzachroberds for your work to get voters out to the polls! Nothing is more important in the home stretch than knocking doors and making calls. https://t.co/bPCs3xovZ2
As long as you’re voting, you can tweet whatever you want @bloomsdaydevice. And so can all of you! Time for another jamboree round of “Mean Tweets!” https://t.co/XeorSxk5Hp
“In a time when disingenuous finger-pointing and spouting untruths threaten the integrity of our political discourse, a candidate like Rich Cordray is a welcome relief.” https://t.co/mmg6tuGPuW
What a day! Thanks to everyone who came out to Youngstown (or tuned in online) to see @JoeBiden, @BettySutton, and me. With one week left, it’s all hands on deck. Let’s do this! https://t.co/HQLgLs7fs9
Change is coming, in a powerful wave that’s growing all over this state. Change is coming in a younger generation of Ohioans that are coming forward, stepping up, and speaking out.
Mike DeWine has already spent millions trying to make you indifferent. And for the next eight days, he will spend millions more attacking the work we’ve done to put money back in the pockets of hard-working families, so that on November 6th, you will stay home.
If @MikeDeWine had his way, people with asthma, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, even people who just happen to be women—all of them could be charged sky-high rates, or denied any coverage at all. That was DeWine’s top priority. But it's wrong, and WE won’t let it happen.
I support protections for people with preexisting conditions, and holding big drug and insurance companies accountable for how they treat people. But @MikeDeWine, on his very first day as AG, went to court to strip health care and those vital protections from the people of Ohio.
Thanks to President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their outstanding team, the country has pulled out of that recession over the past 9½ years.
About to go onstage for a rally with @BettySutton and my friend the former Vice President @JoeBiden! My team will take over my twitter for live coverage of the event and you can watch a live stream of the rally on my Facebook page: https://t.co/P2zWaAWivi
Thank you @MaxTorin and thanks to all of #TeamLorain - our ground game is revved up and we know it will be the crucial difference in these last few days! https://t.co/CFWqLl7ku5
Proud to have the endorsement of so many of Ohio’s great newspapers, including The @Vindicator. They agree that using the power of public office to try to strip people of their health insurance, just when they need it the most, is simply wrong. https://t.co/7eE25gqzD7
And don't I know it! Thank you @writeordiewifey and thanks to all supporters and volunteers around the state who are making calls and knocking doors as we sprint down the home stretch. https://t.co/NDDGATdiUf
It’s time to turn the page on @MikeDeWine’s failed plans. After 42 years, his time is finally up. https://t.co/PbsJCX0JAA
Every morning, Tucker and I share a banana, though given our relative proportions I eat most of it. I suspect it’s one of his favorite parts of the day, and mine too! https://t.co/uKIs7abeUd
Such a strangely small and interwoven world. One of my closest friends, Harry Litman, grew up in that synagogue and told me he knows “every nook and cranny” of it. He was the one who introduced me to Peggy. Here he reflects on the tragedy: https://t.co/14vfDqKKhR
Let me be clear: Ohio is not, never has been, and never will be a “right-to-work” state if I have anything to say about it. And as Governor, I will have a LOT to say about it. https://t.co/lVo2lq5qeN
On Friday, I stopped by McDonald’s (my former employer) for some quick french fries. Ran into Eric, who told me he remembers me knocking on his door on Hague Avenue 25 years ago during my state rep campaign - WOW! https://t.co/xAGFuwSgEl
Loved competing in Ohio Trivia! in Toledo the other day. Those kids know their stuff. They put up a lot more fight than @MikeDeWine did in the #ohgov debates. https://t.co/1a8tPkXJA4
We’ve hit the peak of silly season. @MikeDeWine is now attacking me for supporting the exact same legislation that he and George Voinovich supported. His desperate flailing isn’t working and he knows it. 	https://t.co/kMHaBGOrX2
That is true servant leadership. Thank you Tim Burga and @Ohioaflcio for your strong will to make this happen! We deserve the change that @BettySutton and I will bring for fairness in the workplace and support for working men and women across Ohio. https://t.co/0hVDJRWkfw
Setting an example for us all of mind over matter @carolina_riann! Thanks for your hard work on a cold and rainy Saturday. https://t.co/o7I4tuYUSK
Who do you stand up to and who do you stand up for? In a direct conflict between big business and working people, 327,000 Ohio workers are missing $42 million they had earned in overtime pay. All because @MikeDeWine sided with big business against them. 	https://t.co/UnCwJF3rQ1
Thank you @MaumeeMom! And thanks for encouraging people to find their voice by casting their vote! https://t.co/6rmkIQBpaR
We had a terrific Labor Rally in Toledo where 15 unions voiced their strong support for @BettySutton and me. On behalf of Ohio’s working men and women, thank you for having our back. Ohio’s workers and unions are our pride and joy, and we will fight hard for them. https://t.co/285jPTiM4F
RT @JoeBiden: Ohio needs a champion—a Governor with a back bone—and that’s @RichCordray. He’s ready to fight for working families, and I’m…
“I'm a pastor who believes that we are called to work for the least among us. Rich Cordray has consistently done that throughout his political life, and I believe he will do that as our next governor.” https://t.co/tkKtguVcZy
This is accurate and crystal clear: "Had DeWine been successful in killing the Affordable Care Act, Americans with pre-existing conditions would have lost their health insurance coverage." 	-The Youngstown @Vindicator	https://t.co/EcuQDFAc9r
As Ohioans and Americans, we need to take time this week to come together as a country. We mourn the lives lost, and we pray for their families. 	My full statement on this week's events: https://t.co/M1Dykv29d8
RT @SteveDettelbach: As a proud Jew with family who attends the Tree of Life synagogue (who thank God are okay) my heart is absolutely brok…
Horrified by the senseless acts of violence at a Pittsburgh synagogue this morning. My heart is with the victims and their families. But we're not helpless to stop these shootings; we must take action and we can no longer sit idly by as gun violence plagues our nation.
Congratulations to my friend @sherrodbrown on three debates and three wins in #OhSen!
Just 10 days left! You can still vote early in person or by mail. And if you run into any issues, there are excellent public servants at the Ohio Voter Protection Hotline ready to answer any question: 1-833 OH-VOPRO (648-6776)
My wife Peggy somehow seems to do it all! In addition to being the breadwinner for our family and a first-rate professor, she’s a great Mom and also a tremendous advocate for working women in Ohio. https://t.co/3rtdwiuUZV
All eyes will turn to Ohio on November 6. Ohioans, pundits, reporters, and many concerned Americans will be watching to see what we do here. If you haven't voted yet, go vote early and bring some friends along. Let's bring this thing home for Ohio.	https://t.co/nCM6iSzWWI
Is he actually assembling that yard sign or is he instead eyeing the possibility of snuggling up and using it as a blanket? Show us the full video, @Jajuare81013! https://t.co/CC9DPNYyty
Spent part of the morning competing against the Toledo Public School Early College quiz bowl team in “Ohio Jeopardy!” - not thrilled about losing by 1 point (!) but well done, quiz bowl team. These are some whip-smart kids. https://t.co/tAWoML1wM5
Spoke up for workers at today’s Labor Rally in Toledo. People are not happy with @MikeDeWine blocking 327,000 Ohioans from getting overtime pay, his support for every lousy trade deal, his unwillingness to stand with workers on Issue 2, or his loose evasions on “right-to-work.” https://t.co/etstvfDdbG
It appears I stumped many of you yesterday. Akron, Ohio was the first city in America to use police cars. It's also (though many more of you would have known this) the rubber capital of the world! https://t.co/dlblTTBqxq
Violence has no place in our political disputes – period. I was horrified when someone shot at Congressional Republicans at their baseball practice, and I’m appalled at these attacks on Democratic leaders. It’s completely un-American.
Tune in at 10:30 on my Facebook page to see me compete in "Ohio Jeopardy!" against the Toledo Public School Early College quiz bowl team. https://t.co/P2zWaAWivi
So @MikeDeWine just gave his campaign $3 million in a desperate attempt to buy the governorship. We won’t be able to match that dollar for dollar, but we can put a big fat dent in it with your help. Please consider donating to our grassroots campaign. https://t.co/cVdTmp0ZPv
Took a quick break from the campaign yesterday to go ziplining with some of my campaign staff on one of the Canopy Tours at @HHCT. If you haven’t been yet, you should definitely go! Or go ziplining in the Wilds, which is also exhilarating! https://t.co/WNFhIOksTV
As I told the @Vindicator, Ohioans are very concerned about making their way in this economy of flat wages and rising costs. I will fight to protect health care, increase skills training for better jobs, and spread opportunity more fairly around the state.	https://t.co/CNjodX239G
Thank you for your work @DavidJKowalski - and say hello to your dedicated voter-in-training for me! https://t.co/zTIQDWSriP
At one time, @MikeDeWine and many others benefited politically from their crusade against the Affordable Care Act. Now it’s time to answer to Ohioans for making such heartless efforts to get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions. 	https://t.co/GaSiWX4xTe
My wife Peggy recently found these pics of Tucker helping our daughter, Holly, with her homework when she was in grade school. Tucker’s motivational tutoring clearly worked! https://t.co/rDfWB12g6V
Yesterday riding the @COTAbus in Columbus. With almost one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties having no form of mass transit, our state needs better infrastructure. The added investment will create jobs for Ohioans that can’t be outsourced. https://t.co/luVIkWi9NH
Half of the states in the country invest in public transit, but Ohio doesn’t. @MikeDeWine has no plan to improve public transportation in ANY of Ohio’s counties, let alone the 27 counties with no access to it whatsoever. https://t.co/6QT9QlZJfr
Thursday Trivia		Q: What Ohio city was the first to use police cars in America?
Great event last night at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. @BettySutton and I believe we need to make Ohio work for everyone, not just those at the top who've already found success. We must make Ohio a fairer place to live and for our people, young and old, to thrive. https://t.co/pyvZPUWdo0
With less than two weeks to go, we’re in the fourth quarter of this campaign. That’s crunch time! We’re all working as hard as we can to bring this thing home for Ohio, but we need your help. Sign up for a canvassing shift at https://t.co/Iy1yot90Hf https://t.co/PbBaPKVSqv
Mike DeWine ran in 2010 on a promise to overturn the ACA in its entirety, including protection for those with pre-existing conditions. Fortunately, he failed. Now we just can’t trust him to be in charge of our health care. He serves his donors, not us.	https://t.co/miU9Uimfkf
Loved visiting Jackson Center in Shelby County last week. Ohio farms are something special. They create self-sufficiency in our state and the farmers have such a strong connection to the land. We need to protect and support them. I will. https://t.co/l4uiH65GLj
At a UAW hall, @BettySutton reminded Ohioans of @MikeDeWine’s anti-worker actions over 42 years. “DeWine has shown time and time again that he protects Wall Street, big business, insurance companies and the wealthy donors that write his campaign checks.”	https://t.co/cVQnXs1fVD
Our dog Tucker is the soul of equanimity. He doesn’t care about negative ads or close polling data - he just doles out the love. And that means a LOT this close to Election Day! https://t.co/UkoueerCd1
Seems @realdonaldtrump is taking a page out of @MikeDeWine's playbook. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Either way, they're both lying about pre-existing conditions and they’re still coming after our health care. We need to stop them. https://t.co/IOO1wCXx6r
My wife Peggy - who is currently our family’s breadwinner - points out that women make up 48% of Ohio’s workforce, and two-thirds of those women are the primary earners for their families. https://t.co/rGy0adEWh1
The Outdoor Industry Association has endorsed me as a leader on environmental issues who will invest in Ohio’s public lands and outdoor recreation. For hunters, fishermen, and sportsmen of all kinds, we will be vigilant to preserve our way of life! 	https://t.co/RHRf0awtu0 https://t.co/Uz7bFXOLjK
I talk more about public transit because I care more about it than @MikeDeWine does. For my partner @BettySutton and me, it’s a key part of our vision to move Ohio forward. We need good roads, strong bridges, more transit, and better Internet access.	https://t.co/H7l9N2bmJk
We have shortchanged infrastructure in Ohio. To step into our future, we must take our infrastructure development more seriously. We will improve our roads and bridges, our transit, and our access to broadband, all while creating good jobs for Ohioans. 	https://t.co/UPByv0fti7
"States that expanded Medicaid … such as Ohio, reported spending their allocations more slowly than states that didn’t expand the health insurance program." Medicaid expansion is one of our most effective tools to combat addiction and the opioid crisis.	https://t.co/MOMqji5rw2
It’s absurd for @MikeDeWine to lecture us on how Ohio should handle for-profit charter schools while he clings to $36,000 of ECOT money. All in the wake of the biggest financial scandal in Ohio history, which happened right under his nose. 	https://t.co/KBQJ8khgzu
Contacting voters is what it's all about and in a close race like ours, this could be the difference. Go to https://t.co/sot1ZDmPZS and sign up for a shift! https://t.co/4IwMz6nHGh
So excited to be welcoming my friend @JoeBiden back to Ohio! He will be joining @BettySutton and me onstage at a great rally in Youngstown on Monday.
We are now just two weeks out from Election Day - WOW! You know @BettySutton and I are working as hard as we can to win this race. If you can spare an hour or two, please sign up for a canvassing shift at https://t.co/pOg5jVISgP
ALERT: VP @JoeBiden is coming to Ohio! And @BettySutton and I will welcome him for an Early Voting rally on October 29. Details forthcoming -- sign up to be first to know: https://t.co/q4yewjVFmS
As @MikeDeWine set out on a corporate-funded mission to eliminate the ACA and its protection for pre-existing conditions, he now finds it was a wrong turn. So as the election nears, he wants people to trust him with their health care. We think not, Mike. 	https://t.co/miU9Uimfkf
Indeed - @BettySutton and I are ready to push Ohio in a new and better direction. We will bring much-needed change to Capitol Square! We will lead Ohio to invest in our people and to strengthen the communities we love so deeply. https://t.co/wpYblCGSgN
Proud to have the support of the Elyria Chronicle. "The time has come to end one-party rule in Columbus, and the best way voters can achieve that goal is by electing Democrat Richard Cordray as Ohio's next governor.” https://t.co/YNBO4CIXwm
Now @MikeDeWine is following the lead of @realdonaldtrump and others who’ve realized their heartless, long-held positions opposing every part of the #ACA are political poison this election season. “Whoops, what did I say again?” Give me a break! 	https://t.co/SPbe0aBM0J
This election is about stepping into our future - @BettySutton and I have a positive vision to support small businesses, fire up our infrastructure, protect Medicaid expansion, and invest in more training so all Ohioans can get the good jobs they deserve. https://t.co/YXyuwM6EOp
Jack Reardon - Chair, 2nd Graders for Cordray. You go, Jack! https://t.co/kPHthzTaS1
There’s no comparison between @MikeDeWine and me on right-to-work. He’s like Republicans from other states, who at first deflected it, then folded under pressure. And recall on S.B. 5 he showed no backbone. I’m firmly and squarely against right-to-work. https://t.co/4p27BE3e3i
Hey @AftabPureval, you know you have my FULL support off the court. But on the court? I’m down to take you on any time! Maybe best sometime AFTER November 6. https://t.co/oGMp61pL28
I believe @BettySutton and I have the vision and energy to help Ohio step into our future. We need to open up our politics and welcome the youngest generation in order to strengthen our communities and grow our economy. We can’t do it without them! https://t.co/Ju4xxdoRrJ
Numbers are important in this election. https://t.co/T8h9FhhmUf
Proud to be endorsed by law enforcement officers around Ohio and will always back them in their important work. We can do so much together - and we must - @BettySutton and I will make sure they have the resources and support they need to do their jobs. https://t.co/pn7vzL8skc
So glad every day to have @BettySutton as my amazing running mate in this race. I'm looking forward to working with her to achieve our shared vision for Ohio. Check out her interview with the Sandusky Register. https://t.co/zYQWCRva9h
Thank you for the support @LauraSeydel. We will fight to protect Ohio’s clean air and water. This election will determine both the short-term and the long-term direction Ohio takes on supporting and protecting the environment. https://t.co/i9kCS6pSPK
Proud that @BettySutton and I have the support of strong doctors around the state. They agree with our support for protections for people with pre-existing conditions and our plan to make health care more accessible and affordable for Ohioans. https://t.co/sc4ilV7QGt
Thank you @DavidMiller0789 and to all the organizers who get up on a Saturday to knock doors and make calls. Amazing work! https://t.co/kVQxJT1CVR
With some great friends this morning for worship service in Columbus, led by our great Congresswoman Joyce Beatty! https://t.co/lsOBewMI1k
Proud of my friend @SherrodBrown for his performance in the second #OHSEN debate tonight. He was strong and unwavering in his support of Ohio's workers and their families.
Closed out last night at the Pumpkin Show parade in Circleville, which I have attended for years with my close friends the Gerhardts. I grew up in Jackson Township, just across the county line in Franklin County. We were a vivid parade entry in a yellow Plymouth Prowler! https://t.co/kJPVaw9vqh
We kicked off a voter canvass from the famous Kelly’s Market on the South Side of Columbus today. My old legislative district came right to the edge of Williams Road there, so many of my constituents shopped at Kelly’s all the time. https://t.co/t8BJodmw0w
Having traveled across the state for the last year, @BettySutton and I know that healthcare is the top issue on the minds of Ohioans. We are running to protect your health care, whereas @MikeDeWine misused our tax dollars to try to get rid of it.	https://t.co/hREAlj107c
Two more Ohio school districts are suing DeWine’s cash cow, ECOT. “The districts say they don’t trust Ohio Attorney General @MikeDeWine to fight for their best interests.” As DeWine/Husted still stubbornly hang on to $36,000 of ECOT money, that’s clear. https://t.co/h0FnyjXEBM
WOW - just 10 minutes to go vote! That’s as quick as making a glass of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Thanks @reemtaye for the support. Love the sign. And love your lovely mama! https://t.co/oI2vTdPeTN
Thanks for the support @elikalil_ and love the shirt! And hey, we need to go hoop it up sometime! https://t.co/B3O6gfRsav
Exactly like @MikeDeWine, @realdonaldtrump is saying one thing, doing another on protecting people with pre-existing conditions. They’ll say anything to get your vote, but they won’t do what they say. If they would, they’d already be doing it right now.  	https://t.co/Gs9XdRhOjM
For supposedly being the top law enforcement official in Ohio, @MikeDeWine can’t seem to get much right for the law enforcement officers he’s supposed to lead. It’s time for him to step aside and for us to get moving forward. https://t.co/wSpB2Bzn5t
Enjoyed touring the Ottawa River and Maumee Bay yesterday with experts Tom Bridgeman and David Kennedy, and ship captain Gary Byers. We put our heads together to consider how to solve the threat to the environment posed by the toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie. https://t.co/HyktAIRYRi
Whether it’s Lake Erie’s toxic algae bloom, fentanyl deaths surging, local funds being siphoned off to Columbus, or crumbling infrastructure, Toledo - and all of northwest Ohio - needs and deserves a new direction. https://t.co/K91pQjQ1mF
Reminds me of Richard Armour: “Cows/Do nothing but browse/And drowse/And now and then moo./That’s all they do./...Making milk with all their might/With every bite./Cream too,/With every chew./I’d like it fine/Could I combine/In such measure/Business with pleasure!” https://t.co/ipmFnToi54
Wearing my Tin Man tie in honor of one of my favorite movies of all time, The Wizard of Oz. We need to have more “heart” in government and in politics! Like @JohnKasich showed when he fought successfully to bring Medicaid expansion to Ohio. https://t.co/t8m59IlQwc
@SethARichardson Thanks, I thought it was very mooooooving.
Nothing could be any grassier than these grass roots. You go, Cordray-Sutton army! Take the initiative! Use your imaginations, fire up your creativity, and thanks for all your energy and enthusiasm! https://t.co/QTLu2uF8m2
And @MikeDeWine’s failures by the numbers:	327,000 Ohioans blocked from getting overtime pay	4.8m Ohioans with pre-existing conditions at risk to lose health coverage 	4,162 opioid deaths in 2017, 4x more than when he took office	42 years in politics working for special interests
As you well know, I love the pleasing shape of our state. But boy was I floored to find my soulmate in this Shelby County calf! https://t.co/XZzatZ2wEF
As @MikeDeWine has been Ohio’s “Top Cop” for the past 8 years, our two biggest law enforcement groups - the Fraternal Order of Police and the Patrolmen’s Association - know the two of us very well, They both support Cordray/Sutton, not DeWine/Husted. https://t.co/OjHDQx3vfP
The answer is Marietta, which was not only the first permanent settlement in Ohio, but also the first in the entire Northwest Territory! https://t.co/lI3oIOFbK0
What a great day to visit the FreshStart Farm and Creamery in Jackson Center! The cheese curds and chocolate milk are marvelous and the cows are mighty friendly ;-) https://t.co/QnUkCQeBEy
Although @MikeDeWine now denies it, he tried his hardest to strip away protections for Ohioans with pre-existing conditions. The #ACA is the only law to ever protect those people, and DeWine spent the last decade fighting it - and bragging about it. 	https://t.co/lSqJYQZIwj
So @MikeDeWine and others of his ilk across the country are facing the same question from voters: Why did you fight so hard to take away health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions? 	https://t.co/wZgzGgWbh0
Thank you @danimc12222 for your support! And for taking your voters-in-training with you! https://t.co/hoobfiWkgH
We’ve now picked up endorsements from major newspapers across Ohio - including some that seldom endorse Democratic candidates. Ohioans know it’s time for an end to one-party rule that gets sloppy and even corrupt. https://t.co/qI4NRST0Ws
Glad to speak with @WOSUAllSides about the #OhGov race. We talked about everything from President Trump’s attacks on my record as America’s consumer watchdog, to the importance of preserving health care access in Ohio. Mike DeWine ducked it. Have a listen!	https://t.co/KfO8RG7Cej
What an amazing team of supporters around the state. @iAryeh please thank that wonderful group for their support and for their work to get voters out to the polls! https://t.co/KPJIu832kM
Thursday Trivia		Q: What was the first permanent settlement in Ohio? (No Googling, no cheating!)
National Republicans blew a trillion-dollar hole in our budget with their tax giveaway to their big donors, so now they want to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and the middle class. That’s wrong for Ohio and wrong for America!	https://t.co/8U84YusoJW

Whether it’s blocking workers from getting their overtime pay, waffling on “right-to-work” and minimum wage increases, or advocating for unfair trade policies, @MikeDeWine consistently sides AGAINST workers. https://t.co/oacUnT3OYo
More communities across the state should have the opportunity to hear @MikeDeWine and me lay out our separate visions for Ohio. I’m ready whenever you are, Mike. https://t.co/weRZJ8zbVd

Boy does @MikeDeWine embody the status quo in every way. We need checks and balances on Capitol Square, but DeWine represents more sloppy and complacent one-party rule. The change candidates this year are @BettySutton and I! 	https://t.co/TyARyAZGdI
Check out these great drawings sent to us by @claponclapoff, which were drawn by his wife Debbie. He said they’re also working on some handmade lawn signs to put up around Ohio. Thanks so much for your creative and imaginative support! https://t.co/f80vGP0Ot9

Still waiting on @MikeDeWine to step up to the plate and meet me in Toledo for another debate. We have the time, and I think we owe at least that much to the voters in Northwest Ohio. 	https://t.co/ypJzwzmXJx
“Ohio's next governor must be a foursquare foe of business-as-usual at the Statehouse and a persuasive advocate for fresh approaches to Ohio's persistent problems.” This is so true - we need checks and balances in Ohio. @MikeDeWine can’t offer that. 	https://t.co/DEDPM2pgQo
Ohio women need to know their reproductive rights are on the ballot this year. Yet @MikeDeWine is way too extreme on this issue, leaving no exception for rape or incest. One-party rule in Ohio and Washington would only embolden his anti-choice policies. https://t.co/o84WU5QiUm
People don’t go to work just for the fun of it. Everyone who works hard deserves a full paycheck that reflects every one of the long hours they put in, especially overtime hours. Obviously, @MikeDeWine disagrees. He wants to let employers keep that money. https://t.co/TCnpeRLitG
“Republicans have been Ohio's governors for 24 of the last 28 years and have long led Ohio's Supreme Court and the General Assembly. Yet despite jobs bills and tax cuts, Ohio continues to lag economically and in other crucial areas.”  Cleveland Plain Dealer https://t.co/EhVYHfgXRV
“DeWine, by contrast, is a status quo option who is unlikely to challenge his party’s entrenched thinking."  —@CrainsCleveland  		Ohio's top businesspeople want leadership, not the status quo, one-party orthodoxy, to foster a strong business environment: 	https://t.co/SQOdSI5WH5

The Cleveland Plain Dealer endorsed @JohnKasich in 2010 &amp; 2014, but this year they’re with us: “Cordray wants to challenge convention; DeWine is comfortable with the status quo.” 		Ohio is ready for a new direction and an end to one-party rule. https://t.co/DEDPM27FrO

To @jeniecebrock, and every nerd across Ohio, thanks for always having my back. It’s about time we had a nerd in the governor’s office - especially a battle-tough, fighting nerd! https://t.co/ax69Z8Aa9F
Proud of my friend @SherrodBrown after his first debate tonight. He's a champion for Ohio workers and has consistently stood up to powerful special interests. I know he'll continue standing up for Ohio's workers and their families for many years to come. #OHSenDebate
One of the best things we can do for our state is invest in our future by focusing more effectively on education. I will listen to teachers and work closely with educators to enable them to make sure every Ohioan can get a quality education.	https://t.co/V3O5YtAxxS

Saddened to hear of a shooting in Fayette County early this morning. I'm thinking of the officer's family and wishing a strong recovery for the wounded deputy.
.@CrainsCleveland agrees that the defining issue of this campaign is leadership. After 8 years of one-party rule, Ohio needs a governor to push the legislature and hold it accountable. @MikeDeWine won’t do that, but I will.	https://t.co/SQOdSI5WH5 https://t.co/wtMQOCdtRH

More name-calling from @realdonaldtrump on Friday but I feel the same way I did when the industry lobbyists attacked me in DC -- no amount of name calling will stop me from standing up to stop those who want to cheat Ohio families.	https://t.co/lTRnNibfj7

So @MikeDeWine and @realdonaldtrump both attack me for the work I did at the CFPB - where I got back $12 billion for Americans who had been cheated. Maybe it’s because the money came from their donors and went to everyday people instead of THEM.	https://t.co/ewbmcDFaFe
We promote people who succeed in their jobs. But with @MikeDeWine in charge, Ohio's drug crisis spiked to 2nd worst in the country. And he got big campaign money from ECOT as they ripped off taxpayers with the biggest financial scandal in Ohio history.	https://t.co/6y1l0svxjN
Not old enough to vote. But old enough to INFLUENCE VOTERS. https://t.co/DGortCeapb

“Not one thing happened…he came here, promised funds, got hopes up, and did nothing” about the drug problem in Washington County. Indeed, @MikeDeWine had years to make inroads on the opioid crisis, but the problem has gotten worse and worse on his watch.	https://t.co/FNHxKVbFuw
Just had a great canvass kickoff event with @BettySutton and my friend @CoryBooker. He reminded all of us that we owe it to each other to fight for our communities and to fight for future generations. And the best way to do that right now is to get out and vote! https://t.co/bfsOrqckh9
A marketplace functions best when it permits the talents of everyone to be accepted, fostered, and utilized. Ohio must be welcoming, inclusive, and diverse if we are to compete successfully with the rest of the world in the years to come. 	https://t.co/FsXRTzlBMM
So, @realdonaldtrump, was I “hurting people” when I made things right for them and got back money in their pockets - $12 billion for 30 million Americans? Or was I only hurting those you really care about - the big financial companies that you're now allowing to have their way?
In @realdonaldtrump's speech tonight, he said that as the U.S. consumer watchdog I was "hurting people" and "really enjoyed it.” I don't mind the insults, but Ohioans deserve a governor who will stand up to Donald Trump. Help me fight back by donating now. https://t.co/GFAWpFGC5x

“Students at virtual charter schools are suffering poor academic outcomes while company executives get rich.” We know this all too well as ECOT plundered Ohio while @MikeDeWine snoozed. I stand with @SherrodBrown as he calls for an investigation. 	https://t.co/aAGsrshH4S

So @realDonaldTrump and @MikeDeWine are two sides of the same coin. Both fought tooth-and-nail to end Obamacare and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions -- and they think we’re too dumb to remember. We can’t let them get away with it. https://t.co/C08piH55rZ
We knew @MikeDeWine would continue to lie about his record on pre-existing conditions, so we published the letter with his signature as he filed a lawsuit on his first day as Attorney General to get rid of your health care coverage. See for yourself! https://t.co/ogMLjapvgu https://t.co/xBwWlAfJ44
Actions speak louder than words. And @MikeDeWine has sent all of us a message - through his actions - that our health care won’t be protected. That’s not the message Ohioans want to hear.	https://t.co/f7GigPIbM2

Seems to me that @BettySutton is absolutely right, as @MikeDeWine served up another one of his freshly baked lies to deceive Ohioans - but we’re not falling for it! https://t.co/LNXGYq47rO
It’s important for Ohioans to hear directly from the candidates without the filter of ads or the media. The @toledonews invited us to debate again and our campaign has accepted. I hope @MikeDeWine will respect the voters of NW Ohio and join me.
My wife Peggy is featured here, and they only capture a small portion of her magic. She’s an accomplished lawyer and professor, and an incredible mother to our twins. 	https://t.co/Q9LqsIHEwj
DeWine feels the need to scare people by telling them I’ll raise their taxes. It’s a lie. I’ve consistently said the opposite. If you understand the state’s finances, as I do, then you know we’re running a budget surplus and we need to make sound investments to strengthen Ohio.
In last night’s debate, I was surprised how stark the gap felt between myself and @MikeDeWine in our ability to explain how we are ready to lead on various issues. It’s the job of the governor to lead, with a specific vision and an ability to execute. https://t.co/gQb1HmdQPy
.@MikeDeWine’s anti-women agenda is outdated and far too extreme for Ohio. Make sure you and all your friends are registered by the end of today so you can make your voices heard on Nov 6th. https://t.co/62TEn0Bnbz https://t.co/CRfvFDoqqT
In the debate last night, @MikeDeWine - as expected - doubled down by lying again about his obsession with taking health care away from Ohioans. We expected he would, but this time, we had the proof to hold him accountable. https://t.co/NXmY9c1v6Z
While infant mortality skyrocketed in our state, @MikeDeWine obsessed over defunding Planned Parenthood. It’s an immoral abdication of responsibility and it will change when @BettySutton and I are elected. https://t.co/vMMxHCPRZI
Today is the last day to get registered to vote. If you’re as fired up as I am from last night’s debate, follow the advice of my friend @SherrodBrown: find 5 people to register today and make sure they vote on Nov 6th. https://t.co/aI3wqfIP6C
The final #OHGovdebate just ended in Cleveland. I hope I made you proud. For my part, I'm planning to fight with everything I have and I hope you will, too. Four weeks to go. Let's finish strong!
Tomorrow is the last day to register to vote and Wednesday early voting begins. @BettySutton and I respectfully ask for your vote, a vote to step into our future. #OHGovdebate
I faced down the big financial companies to protect consumers and put 12 billion dollars into the pockets of 30 million Americans. @BettySutton and I will move this state forward. #OHGovdebate
This race is about who you stand up to and who you stand up for. I've always stood up for people who've been abused or mistreated by predatory interests and I always will. #OHGovdebate
I think the people of Toledo would like to see us debate again. I'd like to invite @MikeDeWine to go and debate there next week. #OHGovdebate
Time and again, we have an issue, an important issue, and Mike DeWine's comment is somebody will figure it out, later on. The governor's office is about leadership. #OHGovdebate
A woman's right to choose and make her own health decisions is something we should protect in Ohio. #OHGovdebate
The first thing I will do is protect reproductive rights. Mike DeWine has had no respect for those rights. He's gone so far as to say no exceptions even for rape or for incest. That's too extreme for Ohio. #ohgovdebate
$189 million stolen from the state of Ohio on your watch @MikeDeWine. You did not file a lawsuit until you were running for governor. And we will not get that money back on your watch. #OHGovdebate
I am glad that you've agreed with our plan on K-12, Mike. Where we haven't agreed is on the mess and the scandal that is ECOT. #OHGovdebate
Our teachers are trained to teach. They need to have Columbus lay off and give them more latitude so they can teach. #OHGovdebate
We have too much high-stakes standardized testing. Nobody does that when they get out in the workforce. We need to change our approach. The people telling me the most about this are teachers. #OHGovdebate
Mike DeWine has failed us on police training. He's failed us across the board, which is why law enforcement supports me in this race. #OHGovdebate
We need people to understand we need fair policing and that comes about through proper training. You know how much police training the Attorney General's office is paying for this year? Zero hours of training. #OHGovdebate
Drug dealers have had a playground in Ohio while you've been asleep at the switch. You've been the fentanyl failure for Ohio. #OHGovdebate
We should stand for net neutrality in this state. I will stand for it. #OHGovdebate
How can you grow the economy without talking about small businesses and supporting them? #OHGovdebate
We should grow the economy in Ohio and we will grow the economy in Ohio but Mike DeWine's plan won't do it. His plan is built on more tax cuts to the top 1 percent. That money has never trickled down and never will. #OHGovdebate
We're releasing the letter that shows that on @MikeDeWine's first day as AG, he sued to get rid of Obamacare and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. #OHGovdebate https://t.co/ogMLjapvgu https://t.co/Z2HIlj2uhj
We do not need to raise taxes in Ohio. What I will do is raise paychecks. #OHGovdebate
Taking taxpayer dollars to take away health care from people, that was a DeWine double cross. And taking taxpayer dollars to wipe out Medicaid expansion, that was another DeWine double cross.
We have a record of 8 years of what he's done on pre-existing conditions. There's only ever been one law in this country that protected people in this country on pre-existing conditions and it was the Affordable Care Act. Ever since @MikeDeWine has been flatly opposed to it.
Mike, you've had your chance for 42 years -- it's time you step aside. And it's time for Ohioans to step into our future.
The governorship is not a gold watch to be given to whoever has been around the longest. We need new leadership to move forward. @BettySutton and I believe we can do better.
Yes, @MikeDeWine and his allies “hammered the Affordable Care Act when it was unpopular. Now that it has gained favor they are scrambling to say in their own way — me, too.” But it won’t wash to Ohioans who know better than to trust them. https://t.co/SSOohckklt
At 7 pm tonight I will take the stage for the third and final #OHGovdebate. Like the first two, my team will be taking over my Twitter account to live-tweet during the debate. And you can watch the live stream on my Facebook account: https://t.co/yr6adPLDs2
Although @MikeDeWine has had 8 years as the “Top Cop” to solve the opioid problem, he’s only made it worse. Deaths quadrupled, and drug cartels invaded Ohio and flooded us with fentanyl. He’s the captain of the Titanic. Time for new leadership at the helm.	https://t.co/x05bJVzsKj
Thank you to our wonderful supporters in Cincinnati for sending out 1,000 handwritten postcards. Incredible! https://t.co/CqlBSA3XuJ
Insurance companies have invested millions in @MikeDeWine because he has consistently backed a sure-fire plan to save them money: gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Great to spend time with @SherrodBrown, @RepBeatty, @BettySutton and @KamalaHarris today. There’s great energy and enthusiasm out there -- a readiness to end the status quo of one-party rule and put aside the divisiveness in our politics. It’s time for a new way forward! https://t.co/ILy1Q2hF9x

On Thursday at a forum with high school students, @MikeDeWine and I were both asked our positions on raising the minimum wage. I said it’s time to raise it for hard-working Ohioans. DeWine fluttered like a butterfly in the wind.	https://t.co/z95ioCmANN
Yesterday @MikeDeWine came out in favor of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. His claims of being a champion for women have always been empty, but this shows once more that he’ll side with President Trump against them every time.
So @MikeDeWine claims he is “for” protecting people with pre-existing conditions, but only one law has ever achieved that. And he has attacked that law and bragged about opposing it ever since. He still brags about it, except now he’s finding out that he picked the wrong side.
My friend President @BarackObama said, “When times get tough, we don’t give up. We get up.” Running for governor is no walk in the park -- but I’ve committed myself to the task. I hope you’ll join me by signing up to volunteer in the final month: https://t.co/9Kiz90Mrec
Hey there, @MikeDeWine, it’s just wrong to allow insurance companies to cancel coverage or raise premiums for people who have a pre-existing condition. AGs who agree are joining the (current) federal lawsuit to defend these protections. Why won't you?
RT @BettySutton: “Behind every successful woman is a tribe of other successful women, who have her back.” Thank you Region 2B Women's Advis…
If you had told me last December that with one month to go, we would be tied in the polls, out-raising our opponent, and leading a grassroots effort for change, I would have been thrilled. This is exactly where we hoped to be. We can do this! Let’s give it our all!
One month from today is Election Day. WOW! If you haven’t registered to vote yet, you still have a few days left. The deadline is Tuesday, Oct 9th - so take a few minutes, make sure you’re registered, or get registered now at https://t.co/62TEn0Bnbz
Today is hard, but we must channel our anger into action. Let’s look out for ourselves in Ohio by opposing candidates like @MikeDeWine who won’t protect our basic rights. I’ll stand up strongly for voting rights, worker rights, civil rights, women’s rights.
Some great forums lately with young people - students and children as well as parents and teachers. I’m falling in love with this young generation of Americans - showing us how to be great in their own progressive and inclusive way, linking us just as human to human.
DeWine is trying desperately to clean up his record by lying about how he’s worked relentlessly against Obamacare’s protections for pre-existing conditions. It’s wrong for him to mislead people who are most at risk of losing health coverage. #ohgov https://t.co/MsLBG091ne
The most common first-name of any baby born in Ohio last year was "Emma." Play again next week! https://t.co/Rowz3wVmTN
You shouldn’t need a college degree to be part of the middle class - that’s why I’m fighting to make sure Ohioans can secure good-paying jobs through affordable training and skills programs. Check out our new ad! https://t.co/YYyYFBrU2W
Here’s the @TheAthensNEWS: "DeWine has been a bitter foe of the Affordable Care Act and has not supported the related Medicaid expansion that provided health-care coverage for 700,000 low-income Ohioans.” 	https://t.co/5syqwfMvE4
As my friend President @BarackObama says, “elections have consequences” - and the consequence of electing @MikeDeWine would be a complete failure to lead Ohio into its future, on jobs, health care, education, gerrymandering, and addressing the opioid crisis.
Had a great event with leaders representing many of Ohio’s doctors yesterday. Thank you to Dr. Arthur Lavin, Dr. Anita Somani, and Dr. Vin Gupta for joining me to discuss one of the defining issues of this election: access to affordable health care. https://t.co/9UCBQFmMFh
RT @nowthisnews: .@RichCordray spent six years in the Obama administration as ‘America’s consumer watchdog’ — now he’s running for governor…
So @MikeDeWine just spit in the face of 4.8 million Ohioans living with a pre-existing condition when he lied about his record. If DeWine had his way, insurance companies would still be able to discriminate against Ohioans with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and more.
DeWine’s lies on pre-existing conditions are backfiring. He’s just lost the support of over 750 doctors who have broken with the Ohio State Medical Association to support our campaign. They know DeWine’s prescriptions are wrong for Ohio. 	https://t.co/5AJ4RJQvPP

This is right out of your own mouth, @MikeDeWine. On the first day into your tenure as AG, you wanted the #ACA gone. Now you try to claim otherwise. Do you really think we all just fell off the turnip truck? Ohioans are a lot smarter than you seem to think. https://t.co/jJUgnF1OLp
Thinking of all the brave men and women in law enforcement around the country who have to put on their uniforms this morning after the senseless attack on 7 officers yesterday in South Carolina.
Proud of our great team that out-raised @MikeDeWine last month. We also had 9 times as many donations. He may have the corporate special interests on his side, but we have the support of a grassroots army that won’t be stopped. Join us by donating today! https://t.co/1R7FxPM0Mc
Some media coverage suggests that @MikeDeWine and I have the same position on “Right to Work” - but we don’t. Let me set things straight: DeWine is willing to put this issue on the ballot. I disagree. Ohio is not and should not be a “Right-to-Work” state.	https://t.co/JNy6Nogfvn
My friend President @BarackObama put it simply when he said “Don’t boo, vote.” 		So @MikeDeWine doesn’t care about us booing, but he’ll care about us voting as we bring change to Ohio - so make sure to get registered by October 9 by going to https://t.co/62TEn0jLMZ https://t.co/OuZuayfCYw

Donald Trump just doesn’t get what many women and girls go through on a daily basis. The #MeToo movement is not a “scary time for young men” - it's about holding men accountable for sexual assault and sexual harassment. And it’s been a long time coming.	https://t.co/G09N0pHo3Y
It seems @MikeDeWine either does not know his own record or can’t defend it. He has spent a decade fighting to end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. When he says otherwise, just remember that actions speak louder than words.
"Republicans enjoy control of both chambers in the Ohio General Assembly, as well as the governor’s office - and yet the majority party is ineffective in moving the state forward.” This year, many Ohioans want to end 8 years of unbalanced one-party rule. https://t.co/TL0UIp8g4O
Had a great time at the Marietta post-debate party! I had so much adrenaline left over from the debate and it was exciting to celebrate with some of our most committed supporters and both new and old friends. Thank you! https://t.co/5nSbUg70zQ
So @MikeDeWine has wanted: 	✅More restrictions on women’s reproductive rights	✅To gut the Medicaid expansion that covers 700,000 low-income Ohioans	✅To dismantle the #ACA in Ohio	✅To end protections for those with pre-existing conditions	https://t.co/TL0UIp8g4O

The difference in this election couldn’t be clearer: @MikeDeWine has taken more than $1 million from Wall Street. He works for them. I returned $2 billion from Wall Street to Ohio taxpayers and retirees. I work for you. https://t.co/9Hd9KQAo35
Well done Ohio Dominican University! This is a perfect example of how strong partnerships with local community programs can help Ohioans better access college. As governor, I will work to foster more programs like these. https://t.co/l3Dr7V7NTE
The second #ohgovdebate just wrapped up in Marietta. I hope you’re as fired up as I am. To me, the need for change couldn’t be more urgent, and I hope you saw that as clearly as I did. 		Thank you for having my back!
The cost of health care is so important. @BettySutton and I will aggressively fight to keep costs down. #ohgovdebate
Mike DeWine has been a grotesque failure on fentanyl. Last year we lost 3,431 Ohioans to fentanyl. Law enforcement says the cartels have flooded Ohio with fentanyl on his watch. #ohgovdebate
A lot of this poor tone and divisiveness and pitting people against each other and blaming and scapegoating is coming out of Washington and I want to stand for something different here in Ohio. I want to stand for politics that we can respect and be proud of. #ohgovdebate
People can't lie their way to public office in Ohio. #OHGovDebate
We need to reign in the failing charter schools—get that money back into the classroom. We will work with the legislature to improve the school funding formula. Let's trust our teachers. Let's take the shackles off and let them do better work in the classroom. #OHGovDebate
What you find again and again with @MikeDewine is every problem somehow was caused in the two years i was AG but in the eight years he was AG he's not responsible for anything that happened. It just doesn't add up. #ohgovdebate
We also will fire up the infrastructure of Ohio -- lots of good jobs will spread throughout the state when we do that. We were promised an infrastructure package in the presidential election but we haven't seen anything. #ohgovdebate
.@MikeDeWine used your tax dollars to send lawyers to court to oppose a Labor Department regulation which would have mandated fair pay for overtime for 327,000 Ohioans. #OHGovDebate
The people of this state are very fair - they understand that we should have good working conditions, fair working conditions for people that work hard every day.
Ohio is not a Right to Work state, should never be a right to work state.
I have said consistently that if Right to Work comes before me I will veto it. What @MikeDeWine will not say is that he would also like to see this on the ballot.
People need to retire with dignity and that means spreading opportunity around the state. #OHGovDebate
We will fight to keep the Medicaid expansion that @MikeDeWine fought against for years -- tried to make sure that it was wiped out across the country. We need to make sure we keep it in Ohio. #OHGovDebate
We need to reduce health care costs across the board in Ohio. @BettySutton and I will negotiate more aggressively with the drug companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will reign in the greedy middlemen. #OHGovDebate
.@MikeDeWine's campaign should come with a warning from the Surgeon General: Electing Mike DeWine as governor will be hazardous to your health. #OHGovDebate
We will protect everyone with a pre-existing condition to make sure that they don't lose their coverage. There's no issue that @MikeDeWine and I disagree more on than health care. #OHGovDebate
If you or someone in your family has a pre-existing condition, you should know this, @MikeDeWine took your tax dollars and sent attorneys to court to deny you coverage. #OHGovDebate

Earlier this month, thousands of Ohioans packed into a Cleveland gym -- and thousands more waited outside -- all for the chance to hear President Obama. Here are a few of my favorite pictures from the event. https://t.co/7te4OnpAdt
Jim Jordan and Mike DeWine are birds of a feather. But 700,000 Ohioans with health care through Medicaid expansion and 4.8 million with health care who have a pre-existing condition don’t want this. They need a governor who will stand up for them. I will. https://t.co/HQSF6FkyRq
Our campaign is about fighting for Ohioans and putting money back in their pockets. But @MikeDeWine is busy reaching into their pockets and taking money out -- to the tune of $42 million from 327,000 workers who deserved their pay for working overtime. https://t.co/BqACekWpPB
Under @MikeDeWine, opioid deaths have risen to record levels and drug cartels have flooded Ohio with deadly fentanyl. Now do-nothing DeWine says he’ll “get started on the drug problem.” Oh really?! Too late! You’ve failed us and don’t deserve a promotion.  https://t.co/suPtVz0V7k

You’ve had 4 campaign statements proven false in 3 months so nobody can take you seriously. More accurately, @JonHusted, while I took on corruption in DC and returned $12 billion to consumers, @MikeDeWine chaperoned ECOT’s massive theft of our tax dollars. https://t.co/k7QluUFoHL

Despite these allegations, my opponent continues to support the Senate process rushing to judgment on this nomination. I call on @MikeDeWine immediately to call for a delay in the vote and to join @BettySutton and me in standing up for women and survivors.
The Senate absolutely must #DelaytheVote until there is thorough FBI investigation into the multiple allegations made by different women who have come forward. How could we not do that here? Shameful.
First they are attacked and then they are treated as nobodies. We need to be better than that. Much better.
What are we saying to all survivors of sexual assault if the Senate ignores her story and just goes ahead as if none of this has mattered? This is why survivors are reluctant to come forward.
The Senate will do a grave and lasting disservice to our nation if they blow this off and jam through a vote for confirmation. It’s a lifetime appointment that will decide the fates of millions of Americans. It is absolutely urgent that we handle this properly and get this right.
I’m sickened by how the men on the Senate Judiciary Committee are treating her. We must do better for survivors of sexual assault.
Dr. Ford’s courage and grace to tell her story in the face of vile attacks are an inspiration. I believe her and respect the courage of all women who come forward to share their stories.
2/ Women who are the victims of sexual assault deserve to be heard and should not be attacked for having the courage to come forward and tell their stories. And men must step up to stop mistreatment of women whenever they see it anywhere in society.
1/ The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are deeply troubling and need to be fully investigated — which is why I believe the Senate should delay any vote on the nomination until that happens.
President Obama’s leadership helped us move forward from the bad old days when insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions like asthma or cancer. We can’t let @MikeDeWine take us back to those fearful days. https://t.co/kXlg59BUS8

People earn their overtime pay by working for it and they deserve to get it. DeWine’s lawsuit to block people making less than $48,000 a year from earning overtime pay was heartless and shows he simply doesn’t know or care what it’s like to be in the middle class.
Every Ohioan making less than $48,000 a year needs to know that @MikeDeWine used their tax dollars to sue the federal government to block them from being eligible for overtime pay. All told, 327,000 Ohioans lost protections for overtime pay because of DeWine.
This stuff isn’t really complicated - someone who took tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and looked the other way while a dishonest charter school robbed Ohioans blind shouldn’t be trusted to hold them accountable now. https://t.co/n0YQEOvQTA
As I travel around the state, people tell me they want a governor who is focused on putting money back in their pockets and standing up for middle class Ohioans. That’s exactly what I will do and have always done.
After 8 years as Ohio’s “top cop” while the opioid crisis exploded and fentanyl deaths have spiked massively, @MikeDeWine just told a reporter “we’re going to get started on the drug problem.” WOW. Completely out of touch.
This is a difficult time for our nation - and for women in particular. I want to say clearly and without reservation: Women who are the victims of sexual assault deserve to be heard and should not be attacked for having the courage to come forward and tell their stories.

"We didn’t fight for the ACA for more than a year in the public square for any personal or political gain – we fought for it because we knew it would save lives, prevent financial misery, and ultimately set this country we love on a better, healthier course.” 	-President Obama https://t.co/Si82u8V7gq
The OSAM Drug Abuse Report for 2018 says: "Law enforcement reported that drug cartels have flooded Ohio with fentanyl." All on Mike DeWine’s watch. His first year as AG, Ohio had 73 deaths from fentanyl. Last year, we had 3,431. We need someone new to clean up this mess.
We remember where @MikeDeWine was on Senate Bill 5. But now he’s dodging on so-called “right to work” to keep his options open. Ohioans deserve a clear commitment on this issue. As Governor, I will fight any and all efforts to advance “right to work.”
I am curious to know how DeWine thinks he’s "for" protecting people with pre-existing conditions. He tried to wipe out the law protecting them, failed, then tried and failed again. Now he could go to court to protect them, but he refuses to do it. Three strikes - you’re out!

We can see @MikeDeWine is not willing to stand up to Donald Trump. The only thing he could find to criticize is that Trump has been mean to AG Jeff Sessions. How about ending protections for Ohioans with pre-existing conditions? Time to stand up for Ohio.	https://t.co/Qy23ORDUQp

DeWine tried to drag us back to a time when 4.8 million Ohioans could lose their health care for having a pre-existing condition, and 700,000 Ohioans would lose Medicaid coverage. If he had his way, Ohio would be sicker and poorer, plain and simple. 	https://t.co/x8ewxFmbV4
DeWine has had no clue on fixing the opioid crisis. If he did, he would’ve done it already. And his proposal to end or shrink Medicaid expansion would make the problem worse. Whatever we do, we can’t leave him in charge of this mess.
As is now clear, @MikeDeWine—Ohio’s top cop for the last 8 years—allowed the opioid epidemic to spiral out of control. He was simply ineffective as drug trafficking exploded, notably the horrific scourge of fentanyl deaths, which have increased 50-fold on his watch.

Ohio’s opioid deaths are rising to catastrophic levels on Mike DeWine’s watch. 		DeWine says he’ll appoint an "opioid czar" to fight the problem but we've had an "opioid czar" for the past 8 years, and his name is Mike DeWine. https://t.co/9Ue5nZBbSn

From Day 1, @BettySutton and I have made this campaign about creating opportunity in every corner of the state. We will lead us to an inclusive Ohio that leaves no one out and leaves no community behind. Everyone willing to work hard deserves the chance to build a better future.
As I said in the debate, listening to @MikeDeWine on drug policy would be like asking for navigation advice from the captain of the Titanic. He’s had 8 years to solve the problem and opioid deaths have more than tripled on his watch.	https://t.co/KL2aug0OVK

Ohio should be a state that stands strongly for women's equality. Let's start by ending sexual harassment that holds women back in the workplace. Let’s insist on equal pay for equal work. And let’s protect a woman’s right to choose, which I am for and @MikeDeWine is against. https://t.co/7cTjLWvDy6
Ohioans want a governor who will look out for them beyond all else. We’ve seen @JohnKasich have the courage to expand Medicaid. But @MikeDeWine will not put what’s good for Ohio ahead of his need for political support from Donald Trump. 	https://t.co/I2Efsowz7t
The answer is 6! JFK, Buchanan, Taylor, Polk, Van Buren and John Quincy Adams were the only candidates who managed to win the Presidency without ever winning Ohio. Though Cleveland only won 1 of 23 electoral votes in Ohio in the 1892 election. https://t.co/2l9XK66mc3
So @MikeDeWine has been AG for the last 8 years and his political career spans 42 years. If he was going to implement his supposed “plans,” he would have done so already. He can’t deliver - it’s time for a new direction. https://t.co/MgIaTTwJui
What Ohioans have a pre-existing condition? Almost 5 million of us. Anyone with asthma, or high blood pressure, or cancer. Being a woman may well be enough. And all the rest of us know we might be diagnosed tomorrow with something we never knew we had. So, basically, ALL of us!
Let me be clear: On his first day as AG, DeWine filed a lawsuit to overturn the #ACA and thus to eliminate protections for all Ohioans with pre-existing conditions. Now he refuses to sign on to a lawsuit that would protect them. He’d take us backward on health care as governor.
At the debate on Wednesday, I knew @MikeDeWine would attack me, but I never thought he'd lie about his own position on health care. Here’s a fact: DeWine has fought for almost a decade to end health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Today is #NationalPOWMIARecognitionDay to honor all the brave men and women who either are or were prisoners of war or missing in action. They are never forgotten as we continue to pray for their safe return.

Thursday Trivia		How many U.S. Presidents were elected without winning the great state of Ohio? (No Googling, no cheating!)
Enjoyed last night’s debate with @MikeDeWine about how we would govern Ohio. The difference between us couldn’t be any clearer. He is mired in the past — we are ready right now with a vision to step into Ohio's future.
Ohioans need a governor who will be a backstop against the Trump administration and a safeguard against a Supreme Court that is fixated with taking away women’s fundamental rights. But @MikeDeWine won’t protect those rights. I will. https://t.co/Y4R1aJ2BIZ
We'll invest in everyone who is willing to work hard in the state of Ohio. I've stood up against powerful interests who thought they could take advantage of people and get away with it. I didn't let them get away with it. I'll stand up and fight for you and I'll fight for Ohio.
When ECOT stole money from us, @MikeDeWine did nothing. We need something different. After 42 years, it's time for a real change. @BettySutton and I will bring that change to the state of Ohio.
.@MikeDeWine has been climbing the political ladder for 42 years. His positions are not going to change. In Washington, he sided with the corporate interests. When Wall Street ripped off taxpayers in our state he enabled them and empowered them and rewarded them with tax cuts.
On this issue of the military lending regulation that we put in place and the Trump administration is trying to roll back, I’d like you to say four little words: “Donald Trump is wrong.” I’d like to hear you say that.
At the CFPB I got 200 million dollars back for our servicemen and women who should not have to worry about someone scamming them or fleecing them. #ohgovdebate

Your record on ECOT has been unbelievable @MikeDeWine . They stole 189 million dollars from taxpayers in this state right under your nose and you did nothing about it.
Newsflash: We've had an opioid czar in Columbus for the last 8 years and his name is @MikeDeWine. #ohgovdebate
The opioid crisis is the public health crisis of our generation and it's the law enforcement crisis of our generation. #ohgovdebate
Many people feel left out and left behind. We need to create an economy that works - not just for some of us or those at the top - but for all of us. #ohgovdebate
Asking @MikeDeWine for advice on the opioid crisis would be like asking for navigation advice from the captain of the Titanic. #ohgovdebate

We can see that @MikeDeWine is on the wrong side of so many issues. But most egregious has to be his long-time obsession with taking health care away from Ohioans.
Wishing a meaningful and easy fast to all those who celebrate #YomKippur!
.@MikeDeWine has always opposed the #ACA and Medicaid expansion. Now he claims to have switched his position in an effort to cloud his record. Nobody trusts him to protect our health care. 	https://t.co/CPHEUCnf3s
The for-profit charter school industry has a crony capitalist in @MikeDeWine. That’s why they bankrolled his campaign as he looked the other way on their theft and fraud. He and Betsy DeVos are not on our side. https://t.co/fXZ6Ep6F1q
This week 10 years ago, a financial crisis crushed Ohioans who lost jobs and homes. My opponent’s votes let Wall Street run wild and take advantage of people on Main Street. Now he blames me! I went to work and cleaned up the mess he and his allies made. https://t.co/rtOrX30ktf
Both @MikeDeWine and I have served as AG but our records are starkly different: I got back $2 billion from Wall Street to Ohio retirees. DeWine (on his first day) sued to take aware health care and strip Ohioans of protections for pre-existing conditions. 	https://t.co/29ThetVvVT
Ohioans have a clear choice on education. DeWine fought to defund rural schools, after-school programs, and special education. But @BettySutton and I would do the opposite, elevating our teachers and supporting the well-being of all our children with wrap-around services.
Glad to hear our message is resonating in Clermont County - and beyond! 	For anyone else who wants a yard sign, sign up here and we’ll let you know how to pick one up! 	https://t.co/YJ7S4xYT6y https://t.co/KIjSzVRMwB
Ohioans need to know this: In 2016, the Obama administration restored overtime pay protection to workers earning less than $48,000 per year. But @MikeDeWine joined a lawsuit to stop the law from taking effect here, blocking 327,000 Ohioans from earning their fair overtime pay.
Change is coming in a powerful wave that’s growing all over the state. I see a younger generation of Ohioans stepping up, speaking out, and fighting for a better nation. We need to embrace them and share the mantle of leadership with them. Not 20 or 30 years from now. Right now! https://t.co/77QoD0fHqB
Still fired up and ready to go from an incredible rally with President Obama on Thursday. Thanks again to thousands of you who came to show your support. We have an energy and enthusiasm on our side we haven’t seen for awhile. Ohio is ready for change. https://t.co/uIUBMdGlqK
Thank you @SherrodBrown! You always had my back at CFPB and Ohioans know you always have our backs. This is a great team - fighting for better health care, more quality education, broader opportunity, and making Ohio the best place to live and work. https://t.co/pBvsFQrAkX
As always, @BettySutton, VERY GLAD to see your Mom and most of the Sutton family make it out to our event with President Obama on Thursday. They are true VIPs! https://t.co/IVSe24hvuK
President Obama is right to call for a return to honesty, decency, and lawfulness in our government. The corruption is just as bad in Columbus as in Washington. We need a new broom to sweep the place clean. I’m in this race to stand up and fight for Ohio. https://t.co/1YFpj94kDx
A man who has been on a lifelong crusade against workers does not deserve to be elected governor. Working Ohioans need to know their governor will have their backs. https://t.co/85H7YbLWJV
Now, @realdonaldtrump bizarrely thinks he is the sole victim of Hurricane Maria, rather than thousands of Puerto Ricans who died because of his apathy, hubris, and poor response. If you can’t face up to your shortcomings, you won’t improve!
By the way, @JonHusted, if you really cared about those suffering from the opioid crisis, you wouldn’t be trying to strip them of health care just to rally your base voters. Time to put aside partisan politics and think about what’s best for Ohio, like Governor Kasich has done.
Hey @JonHusted, on the opioid crisis, the fact is overdose deaths have tripled on @MikeDeWine’s watch. He’s failed us. Your claim about drug dealers is an “outright lie,” as the Dispatch pointed out. We need someone new to get the job done. https://t.co/ve2y49gb6Y
I am thinking of and admiring all our brave first responders that Ohio is sending to help with the hurricanes this weekend and all those in harm’s way along our coast. 	https://t.co/pQA3VQfqe9
In 2016, @MikeDeWine moved to block the new overtime rules, causing 327,000 Ohioans to lose overtime pay protections. After spending a lifetime backing corporations over our workers, clearly he’s not suddenly going to start caring for working Ohioans. https://t.co/V6jH4nqR2j
President Obama said it best: We believe that access to affordable health care is not a privilege, it is a right. We will reduce costs, put more money back in the pockets of working Ohioans, and improve health outcomes in this state. https://t.co/KYAIZBbXyo
Many, many Ohioans, and most especially our young people, are ready for new direction and new leadership - the kind of leadership that is focused on solving actual problems to raise our quality of life. Lift us up! VOTE!	https://t.co/vCcmsgVkg3
In 2010, Ohio public schools ranked 5th in the nation. Since then, due to piecemeal legislation passed without educator input or enough funding, they’ve slipped to 22nd. Our teachers and students deserve better. Read our plan to bring Ohio into the future: https://t.co/0CnYRjavuo

Thank you, President Obama, not just for your generous words of support last night, but for inspiring so many Ohioans and Americans to take charge of our democracy -- to put our hands on the moral arc of the universe and bend it back toward justice.
“If he won’t fight for your health care as attorney general, How can you trust him to fight for your health care as the governor of the great state of Ohio?” 		-President Obama on @MikeDeWine
“He doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk. There are families all across Ohio and all across the country who’ve got money in their pockets because of the work that Rich did.”		-President Obama

In his 42 years as a politician, @MikeDeWine has come to believe that it’s possible to confuse voters if you sling enough mud -- as he’s doing with a repugnant and desperate new ad. But it won’t work this time - Ohioans are paying too much attention.	https://t.co/KicMbycW48
Thank you, @elizabethforma for your kind words — and for recommending me to serve President Obama as the nation’s consumer watchdog. Always there for me - thank you! https://t.co/zhGtZHfm6T
And @DonaldJTrumpJr is here supporting @MikeDeWine because they prefer a governor who won’t stand up to President Trump, even when he’s wrong for Ohio. And DeWine thinks if he makes up enough lies about my record and character, he can eke out a win here. Not this year!
You can tell a lot about leaders by looking at who supports them. I’m proud to have my friend @BarackObama supporting me in Cleveland this evening. On the other hand, @MikeDeWine will appear tonight at a fundraiser with @DonaldJTrumpJr.
Thursday Trivia		The first ambulance service was established in 1865 in which Ohio city?
Today, @BettySutton &amp; I laid out how we’ll reach students beyond the classroom by taking a new approach to K-12 education. We need to support every aspect of a child’s well-being by involving local communities, trusting educators, and ending theft by failing charter schools. https://t.co/InC56Tih9r
Ohio's public schools are asked to do more than ever. But state lawmakers aren't supporting them—they've steadily funneled resources away from schools and laid on mandate after mandate that hinder teachers in the classroom. Students, teachers, and parents deserve much better.
As my friend @elizabethforma said, Kathy Kraninger should be fired for her role in separating babies from their mothers at our southern border, not promoted. 	https://t.co/kZ2hhmDq9b
Ohio students deserve a governor who isn't in the pocket of student loan companies. Unlike my opponent, I’ve spent my career fighting against predatory lenders and returning money to students who were cheated or mistreated. 	https://t.co/1YcKrHG4bC

Most of us remember exactly where we were on 9/11 and will remember that moment for the rest of our lives. The way we came together as a community in the weeks that followed will also stick with me forever.
As with the devastation of Pearl Harbor, our nation will never forget the lives lost on September 11th, 2001. And we will always be grateful to the first responders who bravely risked and gave their own lives to save many others. Thanks to our first responders then and now!
I spoke with @UAW Local 1112 retirees this morning. We are indebted for all they’ve done to build the middle class and support both our economy and our national security. Give them a level playing field, and our union workers can outcompete anyone in the world! https://t.co/KqxxlZWmfC
A little rain didn’t stop us from welcoming a great group of New Americans to our home yesterday. It was moving to see so many leaders advancing rights and creating opportunities for all Ohioans. We’re at our strongest when we lift up the skills and talents of us all. https://t.co/TaZpfjvt2A
The ECOT scandal reflects @MikeDeWine’s 42 years as a politician. They bankrolled his campaigns while he turned a blind eye to their crimes. Now he claims to be “holding them accountable” after they’re all done stealing $186 million from taxpayers. 	https://t.co/Hd2WgXIpox

Last night, I celebrated the 120th birthday of Pipefitters Local 120 in Cleveland with 1,500 people. I talked about strengthening unions here in Ohio, building on our great apprentice programs, firing up infrastructure, and beating back right-to-work as they just did in Missouri.

If @MikeDeWine actually cared about protecting Ohioans with pre-existing conditions, he’d join the 17 other AGs who are defending them. In this state, 4.8 million people have a pre-existing condition and his failure to stand up for them is unconscionable. 	https://t.co/PtBoUB6aXP

1/ We now have two months to go until Election Day. I know they’ll be a tough two months - with National Republicans pouring all kinds of money into this race in an effort to smear my record and confuse Ohioans about what our campaign is about.
Thursday Trivia		In 1984, what was the original slogan required to be placed upon every registered vehicle in Ohio? (No Googling, no cheating!)
We are now hearing that officers got to the scene incredibly quickly and their action saved an untold number of lives. Grateful for their service and professionalism in this horrific situation.
Another senseless shooting, this time in Cincinnati where multiple people in our community have been killed. My heart is with those stricken by this tragedy. But our words are empty without action. We need to take immediate steps to address the daily tragedy of gun violence.
We also spent time hearing about Davis-Besse in Oak Harbor. Their capable workforce deserves our close attention as we think about how best to fulfill our energy potential in Ohio. We will find ways to keep energy costs down for middle-class families and create good-paying jobs.
Hearing more about wind projects in Ohio today. The legislature has been quite backwards on wind power even as this source of clean, renewable energy is already providing electricity here and increasingly around the globe. It’s also creating lots of jobs, and we need our share! https://t.co/UZEdeQwp9e
Young people are energized to stand up, speak out, and drive this election - and rightly so. We should listen more closely to their voices, sharing the mantle of leadership with them not 20 years from now, but right now! I am with them for a better Ohio. https://t.co/4YSkK34L6p
The Supreme Court’s precarious balance highlights how @MikeDeWine has spent decades waging a war on women and their right to make their own reproductive choices. He’s also obsessed with defunding Planned Parenthood. As governor, I’ll be the backstop Ohio needs to fight back.

When I was AG, we investigated and prosecuted companies that misclassified employees as “independent contractors.” This illegal dodge lets cheaters bid lower than those playing by the rules. But @MikeDeWine stopped aggressively enforcing the law. Time for him to go!
Thank you to Chillicothe Mayor @lmfeeney! As you say, @MikeDeWine’s decade-long war on the #ACA and Medicaid expansion doesn’t inspire confidence for the many, many Ohioans who stand to lose their health coverage if he has his way.	https://t.co/ydb8AhPEdY

Ohio native William McKinley wore a red carnation during his debates and kept them on his desk in the Oval Office for good luck, though after his re-election he was tragically assassinated. https://t.co/boVAevNaG1

Yesterday we celebrated the storied Labor Day weekend gathering at Black River Landing in Lorain. People are intent and committed this year. To have a thriving economy, we need to empower our workers and improve skills training across the state. LCCC is leading the way! https://t.co/39oon83UsD
On #LaborDay, I’m honored to have the support of so many Ohio workers. Especially Mrs. Rees, an original “Rosie the Riveter” who at 96 still has the energy to bake cookies for her church and the disabled. She’s “All the Way for Cordray.” Read her story: 	https://t.co/Ke64knf0EM
The founding convention of the American Federation of Labor was held in Columbus, Ohio in 1886. The purpose was to improve the economic conditions of skilled craft workers within the framework of American capitalism. The labor movement has improved and strengthened our society.
Today we honor the American labor movement - the fight to achieve good wages, safe working conditions, fair treatment, and secure retirement. Here, as in so much of life, banding together with others creates strength. That’s the essence of our labor unions and it is what’s fair.
Enjoyed the Geauga County Fair last night. Nice ride down the Big Fun Slide and we had great milkshakes from the 4-H building. I wisely limited myself to just one. But that wasn’t all I had to eat! Who doesn’t love our Ohio county fairs? https://t.co/CSYhdLmr4h
Research clearly shows that children with access to high-quality early childhood experiences at ages 0-5 are much more likely to graduate from high school, earn higher wages, and report better health. But children who start behind usually stay behind. We can do better in Ohio.
Columbus is finding resources to create 1,000 new slots for children to enroll in Pre-K this year. The evidence is crystal clear: quality pre-K programs prepare our young children to succeed in the classroom and beyond. We need more of this!	https://t.co/B7k2X2aj8s

Thursday Trivia		Ohio is home to the first interracial and coeducational college in the United States. Which college was it? (no Googling, no cheating!)
For my part, I was at the @UFCW conference yesterday, noting how @MikeDeWine has left the door open to take right-to-work to the ballot in Ohio in order to please the Koch brothers. But @BettySutton and I firmly and steadfastly oppose it, no matter how it is brought forward. https://t.co/X4tA9qY9Xb
A basic test of leadership is getting the facts right, and @MikeDeWine has flunked. He keeps saying Medicaid expansion is fiscally unsustainable, when the more credible Budget Director has proved him dead wrong. Yet DeWine wants to shrink the program, which is wrong for Ohio!
Real Ohioans like Tawanna Cox of Dayton benefit from the Medicaid expansion, which saves money for everyone as more people are insured. That’s why it’s dumb that @MikeDeWine tried to block the program - twice. Now he can’t manage a straight story on it. https://t.co/DsQQ3pcIQY
It’s disgraceful that law enforcement agents had to file a union grievance to resolve an issue so critical to their safety as protective vests. As Ohio’s top law enforcement official, @MikeDeWine was asleep at the wheel at the expense of his own people. https://t.co/Z4ReUUsHMI
To restate the point, @JonHusted, the subject was protections for unions and workers. So I wonder, will you and @MikeDeWine clearly state that you oppose so-called "right-to-work" in Ohio? Saying “it’s not on our agenda” is a dodge and you know it. https://t.co/Q11QOXaNSD

Student loan debt is a huge problem plaguing our nation. In particular, for-profit institutions have produced terrible results for many students, with 25% of their borrowers defaulting on payments just 5 years into repayment.	https://t.co/I4eabZekCW
Ohio’s ranking as one of the top ten business climates in the nation proves that you don’t need to attack unions to have strong economic growth. Unions are good for making sure Ohio workers are treated fairly and that strengthens our economy. 	https://t.co/KQ3ygmhNlq
So @JohnKasich's legacy as champion of Medicaid expansion will be felt for years to come. Fewer Ohioans now live without coverage at lower costs for taxpayers. With more Ohioans insured, health outcomes improve and  health care costs go down for all. 	https://t.co/pULZO5leRM
We need to make higher education an option for more Ohioans, but we rank 45th in the nation for college affordability. Worse yet, recent college graduates in our state now leave school with an average debt of $30,000. And the CFPB has slunk away from protecting them.
My partner @BettySutton and I have developed a deep respect for one another. It makes for a really good team between us. https://t.co/GuFKa4Z8Fx
Great move by @SherrodBrown. Students - not government - should get the money that was stolen by ECOT. I’ve called on @MikeDeWine to return his $36,000 of tainted ECOT money. He won’t do it. He’d rather have their money than hold them accountable. 	https://t.co/tPjdfGSUQs

Moved by Pastor Covington’s sermon yesterday at the St. John AME Church in Columbus on “The Struggle is Real.” I spoke for a few minutes as well, but appreciated most his advice about not listening to the haters in the peanut gallery and instead just to keep on keeping on! https://t.co/nGUEJf2BCa
As so often happens, the eyes of the nation will turn to Ohio this November. We’re going to send a message that we’re ready for a new direction. Clean, honest government that roots out the corruption and restores honor and dignity to the Ohio Statehouse!	https://t.co/223pwtPqSL
As CFPB director, I returned more than $750 million to student loan borrowers, but Squatter Mulvaney has abandoned them. He's transformed the agency into a charity for powerful financial companies - at the expense of our students.	https://t.co/xoK1pA83SP
Yesterday on #WomensEqualityDay we celebrated the 19th Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote. We’re reminded that women &amp; girls in Ohio still face gender inequities that keep them from reaching their full potential—which means Ohio fails to reach its full potential, too.
Thanks to all the good people at @CAIR_Columbus for their invitation to this great event! As in the spring, and so now again, @MikeDeWine’s absence was noticeable and disrespectful of Ohio’s diverse communities. https://t.co/NobWadkFd5
Wonderful event on Friday with members of the LGBTQ community! My partner @BettySutton and I have a vision for justice and equality in Ohio. It will take work, but we can only move Ohio forward by truly realizing the talents and strengths of each of us. https://t.co/96PsZagQkb
Last week, I attended an affordable housing roundtable. Housing is the most costly budget item and about 400,000 Ohio families pay over half their income in rent. Many make wages that can’t keep up with housing costs. That’s simply unsustainable and we can do better.
O-H-I-O! https://t.co/8479F1xcJL
It is sickening to see another senseless mass shooting in Florida. My heart is with those stricken by this tragedy. We need to move forward with action to address the daily tragedy of gun violence.
We’ve improved our health care as Ohio’s uninsured rate has fallen from 32.4% to 12.8% since Medicaid expansion went into effect. I agree with Governor Kasich that the program is working, and Ohioans don’t want DeWine to shrink it or take us backwards.	https://t.co/iW7T9AvgpC
Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart: “I’ve been in law enforcement for over 50 years, and I’m a Republican. I’ve seen Cordray and Dewine in action. I know them both, and I’m for Rich all the way. I’m voting for the man, not the party, and so are cops across Ohio.” https://t.co/6gUFUTZd2l
Saddened to hear of  the passing of John McCain - a hero who sacrificed more for our country than many of us ever could imagine. He had noble qualities of character and our nation is better off because of his service.
“While state officials were underfunding local school districts, they were sending upwards of $100 million a year to a charter school that will be forever remembered as an epic failure.” I can’t improve on what Brent Larkin has to say here about ECOT. 	https://t.co/Jb6Fu0fl0N
To @BettySutton and me, nothing matters more than Ohio’s children. That’s why we made plans for Universal Pre-K and workforce development. Our young people should be able to get the skills they need and not see college as the only path to economic success. https://t.co/pX0zdCBzkY
Alyssa, I can’t wait to see what kind of governor of Ohio you will be. But let’s take the helm right now - this year - and get your peers in this great young generation not only to stand up and speak out, but also to register and vote. The future is now! https://t.co/tYOknlOtTe
Aside from the childish insults directed at me by @realDonaldTrump, DeWine’s attendance at last night’s @OhioGOP dinner was a slap in the face of Ohio’s working families who are being hurt by Trump’s attempts to take away health care, destroy unions, and let Wall Street run wild.
Trump just said I "ruined people's lives" at CFPB. Actually, millions of Americans had lives ruined by Wall Street greed. We got $12 billion back for those who were cheated. You &amp; DeWine side with them rather than hold them accountable.		Fight back: https://t.co/Dhf6xPb56s
Saddened to hear about the senseless shooting of a Cincinnati police officer. All of us are thinking about his family and everyone at @CincyPD in this difficult time.
In just a few hours, Donald Trump will begin speaking at the Ohio GOP dinner, singing @MikeDeWine’s praises. Trump wants DeWine as governor because he knows DeWine won’t stand up to him.
The answer is Williams, Van Wert, and Paulding, located proximately in northwestern Ohio. John Andre was a British spy in the Revolutionary War, and his captors are deserving American heroes! https://t.co/piqdH92waU
We’re sick of the corrupt circus coming out of the White House. And we deserve a governor who will stand up against President Trump’s policies when they hurt Ohio. People are ready for the kinds of solutions that @BettySutton &amp; I will deliver to improve their lives!
Thanks to @osudems for having me speak last night. Peggy &amp; I are sending our twins off to start their sophomore year. They are part of an admirable generation of young people standing up and speaking out who will change America for the better with their values. Now is YOUR time! https://t.co/PNEupbLjrW
When I was AG, I would not have dreamed of getting myself a bulletproof vest, especially if our own agents were in danger. No law enforcement officer should have to beg for equipment - certainly not bulletproof vests that could save their lives. 	https://t.co/4HM50JeEl2

The first National Women's Rights Convention was held 168 years ago today. We’ve made much progress but still have lots of work left to do, so @BettySutton and I will establish an Ohio Commission on Women and Girls. Check out our full plan here: https://t.co/FsqPvD2t0U
I’ll be a governor for everyone, even people who say I look like a grownup Kenneth from 30 Rock. Well…maybe they have a point. When I headed the CFPB, Jack McBrayer sent me a bobblehead doll of his character Kenneth the Page! Right on, @nbc30rock! https://t.co/9kGF34z4XX
Try as he might, there’s no “narrow path” or “tightrope” in Ohio politics. Because @MikeDeWine protects his own political interests by refusing to stand up to Donald Trump - even when he’s hurting Ohioans - he is unfit to be governor. https://t.co/eoYDbfJkZU
We haven’t forgotten that from Day One, @MikeDeWine opposed Medicaid expansion as well as protections for the 4.8 million Ohioans with pre-existing conditions. He looks out for the powerful interests that bankroll his campaigns - not what’s best for Ohio.	https://t.co/PGyRmbjMJT
I support access to health care for more Ohioans and Medicaid expansion helps. I agree with @JohnKasich that with the federal government covering 95% of the cost, it’s a great deal for Ohio. Plain and simple. Brush up on your arithmetic, @MikeDeWine! https://t.co/ENhIzBBpQQ
We have smelly corruption in Columbus with the Speaker’s payday loan lobbyist scandal and the ECOT theft of funds from taxpayers and schoolchildren. Now we have D.C. corruption of two more Trump insiders convicted of crimes. Restore honor and dignity! Time to clean house!
Yes we do need some good strong nerds to deal with the difficult and important issues facing Ohio. https://t.co/9hWzUNdtqv
Hey, @MikeDeWine, why not start with the $36,000 of tainted money still sitting in your campaign account that your running mate received from ECOT founder Bill Lager? https://t.co/JCZxtuNglF
Jeff Lieu from Fuyao Glass America says he will need 700 more workers next year but we have a shortage of qualified workers. Many other business owners see this too. Businesses that need workers - Ohioans who want to work. We MUST get them skills training!	https://t.co/m5hS7eOGxA
“DeWine also displayed his conservative bent in fighting in court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, including assurances of coverage for pre-existing conditions and the Medicaid expansion.” Now he says he’s for all 3. We weren’t born yesterday, Mike!	https://t.co/OdJQwC4gMh
Ohio workers deserve a governor who will be strong on labor issues. Unlike @MikeDeWine, @BettySutton and I are committed to supporting labor unions like @ohioaflcio and the good-paying jobs they provide in a fair and safe workplace. https://t.co/Zv5Wciy2Gk
I am wearing my Library necktie today in honor of our award-winning library systems in Ohio. We need to honor them, strengthen them, and keep building on them for our future! https://t.co/vcOrI4YnbU
Glad you asked @Ruatha_Pern! It's the Isotelus, which is a trilobite, from the days when Ohio was deep beneath the prehistoric ocean. https://t.co/CTMnNkv072
What kind of message does it send when @MikeDeWine — our state’s top law enforcement official — ignores his agents’ pleas for equipment and puts his own protection ahead of theirs? Every Ohioan should be angered by his blatant disregard for their safety. https://t.co/ezMY41ONiG
Glad to hear that Jim Obergefell will be inducted into the Ohio Civil Rights Hall of Fame. Jim’s heroic work in fighting for marriage equality - fending off Mike DeWine all the way - is one of the many reasons I’m proud to be an Ohioan. Congrats, Jim!	https://t.co/uMH35Y7UcH
Well, @jonhusted I’m glad you “welcome” the view I have consistently held: Ohio’s taxes do not need to be raised. Let’s focus on how we can grow wages for all Ohioans instead of cutting taxes further for your wealthy donors. https://t.co/duSYoNQu0K

Our youngest generation is teaching us much about inclusion, diversity, and tolerance so that we can embrace the talents not just of some of us but of all of us. That is key to a stronger economy and stronger communities so we can step into our future to create a better Ohio.
The @_OLBC dinner this weekend was an occasion for fruitful discussions about the upcoming campaign and to hear words of wisdom on major issues of the day, such as diversity and empowerment. We are united in pushing for Issue One as a moral and fiscal imperative. https://t.co/iNfVYsHyFo
For years, @MikeDeWine has supported poorly performing charter schools like ECOT - a spectacular failure that built an empire based on criminal fraud - just to keep his wealthy donors happy, even as they failed our children and abused our taxpayers.
“For young and for old, a place at the table,/ a voice to be heard, a part in the song,/ the hands of a child in hands that are wrinkled,/ for young and for old, the right to belong,/ and God will delight when we are creators of justice and joy, compassion and peace.”
We sang a hymn in church yesterday that was an anthem for the union of our youngest and our eldest generations, and all the wisdom they can share with us if we open our minds and hearts and lift them up to help us chart the future of Ohio.
The Republican tax bill did nothing in Ohio to improve our roads and bridges, but it did unlock millions for mega-donors like the DeVos family to flood the airwaves with false ads about my record. They want a governor they can control-but that’s not me.	https://t.co/TXiKmIQdsD
Very glad to get our dog Tucker into another campaign ad. He is and always has been a first-rate good luck charm! https://t.co/gYJLJzpt0m
Had a great time at the kickoff event for the Campaign for Ohio. I’m encouraged by how hard so many young people are working. They are standing up and speaking out, and they know we have to get our message out to Ohioans in every corner of the state! https://t.co/cK9gzAROc0
I find it so wrong when workers are cheated out of their money. As Governor, I’ll make sure Ohioans are paid what they’re owed. We DID investigate and punish these kinds of violations, including worker misclassification, and we will do it again. https://t.co/GOKQwlH6JW
I hope my opponents see this clip. As I’ve said many times before, anyone who understands our state government finances knows we do not need to be raising taxes. That’s the truth, @JonHusted, and you should know it too. https://t.co/3Iue2kvmLY
Today is #AviationDay. More like … Ohio Day since the creators of the airplane - the Wright brothers - were from Dayton. Saw that yet again last week with the current expansion of jobs and opportunity at the Dayton Airport. Not to mention our great Wright-Pat!
Grateful to my friend Rhine McLin for gathering an impressive group of African-American women leaders in Dayton recently to talk about the campaign and how much is at stake this year. Voters’ rights, workers’ rights, women’s rights, civil rights are all on the ballot this year! https://t.co/J7WyGwJpOP
So @MikeDeWine now wants to go after Bill Lager to recover money that he should’ve stopped from going out the door in the first place. Yet he still refuses to return $36,000 of tainted ECOT money sitting in his own campaign account. 	https://t.co/ddo90WZjrz
We’re having some fun with the “mean tweets”! 	https://t.co/XsfuuFnH4D
@MikeDeWine opposes Issue One, saying the legislature should vote on it, not the people. Well, the legislature already failed us for all these years. Now they’ve passed the buck to the counties to make the state numbers look better. That doesn’t solve anything.
Our limited and expensive prison space should be for violent criminals and those who prey on others. Not drug addicts who need treatment. Let’s be smart about what we spend. And it’s not criminal justice “reform” to cram problems down to the counties without proper funding.
We should not warehouse drug addicts in our prisons. It’s the most expensive, least productive, and least humane thing we can do. And we destroy people’s futures by saddling them with felonies so they can’t get a job, student loan, or occupational license. Let’s pass Issue One.
And what about over-regulation of our classrooms? So many unfunded state mandates, so much standardized testing, dysfunctional graduation requirements, and now even state takeovers of school districts. Let’s take a fresh look at these things and find a better balance.
.@MikeDeWine and @JonHusted complained the other day about too many regulations on business. If you think so, why haven’t you fixed it already? You’ve had 8 years - step aside and give someone else a chance.
After a candidate screening yesterday, a delightful 10-year-old named Samantha quizzed me on HER issues. Why is there so much testing in the schools? Why don’t we trust teachers to teach as they’re trained to do? They were good questions with no good answers. We need reform.
At the Dayton Chamber of Commerce yesterday, @JonHusted claimed I want to raise taxes on small businesses. I guess he thinks @MikeDeWine isn’t getting enough traction, so it’s time to start making things up. C’mon Jon, you know better. You have no basis for that false claim.
The opioid crisis spiraled out of control on @MikeDeWine’s watch. Now - just months before an election - he claims to have a shiny new plan to address it. Where was his plan four years ago, at a time when leadership would have mattered? https://t.co/Pgd8UuM8pC

Access to the internet is no longer a luxury - it’s a must to compete in the modern economy. This is welcome news for many rural households that lack access to modern digital tools. We will complete the task of delivering broadband access to all of Ohio. 	https://t.co/JbPIRSKfQF
Now @MikeDeWine, after years of allowing more than 50 of his agents to wear expired, defective kevlar vests, has decided that 10 weeks out from Election Day he wants to get his officers some new vests. What an impeccable sense of timing. https://t.co/meyIgTWysb
We’re experiencing a widening skills gap in Ohio and around the country. We need to take care of our workforce by investing in their training and prioritizing their work readiness. https://t.co/qsIzxq3rRd

Ohioans don’t want their health care taken away, plain and simple. 	https://t.co/j18D5NnQOq

As I’ve said before, @MikeDeWine and @JonHusted need to step up, take responsibility, and call for the removal of this baseless ad that’s being blasted across Ohio by national Republicans working on their behalf. Quit ducking! Show some leadership! 	https://t.co/tIOyxO2WqA
It doesn’t have to be just one way or the other. Yes, @BettySutton and I will partner with Ohio mayors to make sure cities have the resources they need. But we’ll also work to expand training and job opportunities in Ohio’s rural communities. https://t.co/1yrzbgxzrv
A perfect example of the dance @MikeDeWine is doing: Now that @JohnKasich says Ohio should protect pre-existing conditions, DeWine says he agrees. Yet he hasn’t joined the lawsuit by AGs around the country to protect pre-existing conditions. Actions speak louder than words!
For 42 years now, @MikeDeWine has taken his bearings from how the political winds seem to be blowing. He tries to hitch his wagon to whatever might gain him votes - though he's clearly unsure how much or how little to stand up to Donald Trump. 	https://t.co/myNP2M5QL6
Mike Pence’s visit to Ohio today is a reminder that he voted AGAINST the 2008 auto rescue that saved thousands of jobs in one of Ohio’s top industries. I’m proud that @BettySutton voted to stand up for working Ohioans - even when it wasn’t politically convenient.
I’m honored to be 1 of only 3 gubernatorial candidates from across the nation to earn the endorsement of the @BlkEconAlliance - a group of top business leaders and advocates who are committed to advancing policies to create better jobs and wages for African Americans.
Ohio is one of the most heavily gerrymandered states in the nation. The 2018 elections will have major consequences for the future of our state — a Democratic victory would be the first step toward putting voters back at the center of our democracy. https://t.co/gj0vNOZIYU
I think @JohnKasich is right. The 4.8 million Ohioans with a pre-existing condition are being put at risk by @MikeDeWine’s refusal to join a lawsuit to stand up to Trump’s attacks on the #ACA. We can’t trust DeWine to protect our health care. https://t.co/nAAJBk7zOS
Gallup estimates the LGBTQ community makes up about 3.8% of Ohio’s population - figures that are often under-reported. That means at least 350,000 Ohioans deserve to know where @MikeDeWine stands on LGBTQ issues. And many of us care deeply as well. https://t.co/QdyBvSSFOd
“When kids fail, the rest of us lose: We lose their talent, and we pay higher taxes for everything from special-ed teachers to prison guards,” says Shannon Jones. So @BettySutton and I have a plan to invest in Ohio’s children and Ohio’s economy. 	https://t.co/ylRTxAOmsO
Last week’s ruling does not undo the harm ECOT was allowed to inflict on Ohio students and taxpayers. As governor, I’ll fight to stop abuses from happening at all. But @MikeDeWine let it happen for years as ECOT cronies bankrolled his campaign funds. https://t.co/1QtVjiN03U
Ohioans don’t want their health care taken away - so @MikeDeWine is now trying to run and hide from his decade-long war against Obamacare and Medicaid expansion as this election nears. 	https://t.co/lTrPrpfe87
It’s unconscionable that squatter Mulvaney now wants to suspend consumer protections for military service members and their families - allowing predatory lenders to go after those serving our country. Shouldn’t we be aggressive, given what they do for us? https://t.co/1HR7XQ56cy
I’m thinking today of Heather Heyer and the many Americans protesting bigotry and racism that have no place in society. I stand with them against hate and violence. 25 years ago, I battled the Ku Klux Klan and successfully defended our hate crimes law in the Ohio Supreme Court.
When I led the CFPB, we recovered $12 billion wrongly taken from consumers by big banks and predatory lenders. National Republicans funded by special interests are spending big for @MikeDeWine because they know as governor I’ll fight to make sure people are treated fairly.
Enjoyed meeting with the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities - they are doing amazing work to improve people’s lives across Ohio. We need to ensure broad access to the state's mental and behavioral health services.
The workforce development plan that @BettySutton and I have presented puts workers first by investing in skills for fast-growing industries like health care, education, construction, advanced manufacturing, and computer systems.
The Medicaid expansion needs to focus more on mental health and substance abuse. And we must fix the current problems with the reimbursement system that are hurting many small providers. The Cordray-Sutton administration will make behavioral and mental health a priority.
I received my own personal notice of this because one of the shows streaming is my game from the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tourney in 2014 while I was heading the Consumer Bureau. I still love Alex! https://t.co/d8qLSqlRiN
The Dispatch: “They will not be able to eliminate all of the smears and hit jobs, but they have the capacity to undercut the effectiveness of these lies by pledging to speak out against them, forcefully and unequivocally, whenever they appear.” Integrity time. Ahem, @MikeDeWine?
The Dispatch had it right back in December. When the political hacks and slime merchants show up in Ohio, the candidates need to say STOP to the lies and the sleaze. Now the RGA is here with false ads, and Mike DeWine doesn’t have the guts to do that. https://t.co/sBOE7gz7gH
Isaiah Thomas can say what he wants - it’s a free country. But having never made any positive contributions during his brief stop in Cleveland, his uninformed views about our great city and state lack any credibility.
Businesses say they will only locate where they can find skilled employees. Our ‘Better Skills, Better Jobs’ plan is gaining traction with Ohioans hungry for a fairer economy that spreads opportunity to everyone - whether or not they have a college degree. https://t.co/gQC8mkWoeG
When government bows to powerful special interests, the people lose. Squatter Mulvaney has allowed financial predators to take advantage of consumers throughout his tenure at CFPB. Ohioans deserve a watchdog who will fight for them, not for Wall Street. 	https://t.co/4mtfh6lRQG
National Republicans are carpeting Ohio with false ads about my record based on ZERO evidence. DeWine and Husted are hiding, pretending they have nothing to do with it. Time to step up and take responsibility - or you don’t deserve to hold office. https://t.co/38T3aVIgyO
On @MikeDeWine’s watch, ECOT stole $186 million from Ohio taxpayers and students. Yet even now, he refuses to return $35,000 in dirty ECOT funds that are soiling his campaign war chest. 	https://t.co/GwvhdxuqzZ
A rose is a rose is a rose. Squatter Mulvaney would rather spend his time quibbling over the lettering of the CFPB’s acronym than lift a single finger to help consumers who are taken advantage of by predatory lenders and by Wall Street. https://t.co/jVf0MmoJ99
We will flip Ohio from red to blue in November, and we will build an economy that prioritizes workforce development and produces more skilled workers. Our economy can and should spread economic opportunity more broadly and work for both employers and employees.
Even after all the hue and cry, @MikeDeWine still has over $35,000 in dirty ECOT money in his campaign coffers - proof positive that he won’t make the reforms needed to protect our failed students and to protect defrauded taxpayers.
Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the CFPB has zero relevant experience for the job. Consumers in Ohio and across the country deserve to have a watchdog who will fight for them - as I did, fiercely and relentlessly - not for the special interests. 	https://t.co/pPuoHR8YB4
Yesterday’s answer is Superman lifted a car over his head on the cover of Action Comics 1 in 1938.  Superman never shied away from standing up for the “American Way.” I can’t lift a car overhead - anymore ;-) - but I’ll never back down from fighting for the Ohio Way. https://t.co/apak9DLCg9
I met with the Summit County Opiate Task Force this afternoon to hear from the experts on the opioid crisis in Ohio. Local leaders are on the front lines of the fight against this epidemic and we must ensure we both listen to them and give them the kind of support they need.
College is one answer, but it isn’t the only path to the middle class. Whether people are	just starting a career or transferring to a new path later in life, all Ohioans should have the	freedom to make their own best choices and get the skills needed to secure their futures.
Spent this morning at the Manufacturing Advocacy and Growth Network discussing our new Better Skills, Better Jobs plan for Ohio. For years, our state’s workforce development efforts have emphasized employers over employees. It’s time we put workers first.
The Supreme Court ruling is a step forward for students and taxpayers victimized by ECOT. But we need more action, which won’t come from the DeWine-Husted ticket as they grimly hang on to tens of thousands of dollars they took from ECOT cronies. 	https://t.co/7SfUx1xmLw
A new report finds we now have over 100,000 Ohioans working in clean energy - in jobs that contribute to clean air and clean water AND reduce energy costs. We are committed to investing even more in renewable power to accelerate this growth. 	https://t.co/gkJkhvtVf4
The incredibly slim margin in deep-red #OH12 (Tiberi by 36 in 2016) shows a level of energy among our voters that is truly inspiring. @BettySutton and I are ready to match our voters’ passion and work ethic to deliver a victory for Ohioans in November. https://t.co/C53ipUuxuD
I think @JohnKasich is absolutely right - Ohioans don’t want their health care taken away. But @MikeDeWine’s decade-long war on the #ACA and years of opposition to Medicaid expansion means Ohioans can’t trust him to protect their health care. 	https://t.co/3lH0pmWs3O

Important meeting with the @Advocates4OH yesterday. They see people worried about their economic futures and know their voices need to be heard and respected in Columbus. We will fight for working Ohioans and implement policies that invest in and strengthen the middle class.
My running mate @BettySutton put it beautifully: Ohioans want to work, care for themselves, and have the dignity of doing the work, but it’s our responsibility to make sure they have access to the training and skills they need in our fast-moving economy. https://t.co/CQPoPeP2j0
Focusing only on the landscape of today is no recipe for success tomorrow. Our “Better Skills, Better Jobs” plan puts people first, It’s a bottom-up strategy that empowers Ohioans with skills that will allow them to excel today and excel in the future.
College is not and should not be the only path to the middle class in Ohio. My partner @BettySutton &amp; I have a plan to put more Ohioans to work - not just in a job, but in a career. 	https://t.co/omo6e4ZJgs
Congratulations to @dannyoconnor1 on a hard-fought battle. Last night’s close result reminds us that grassroots energy matters. The doors we knock &amp; phone calls we make matter. Let’s double down on our efforts over the next three months and win in November!
Our @KingJames built the @IPROMISESchool to provide better skills today for better jobs in the future. We have the same vision for all Ohioans. Check out our “ Better Skills, Better Jobs” plan for Ohio. https://t.co/X5CMHIb5y6
My running mate @BettySutton &amp; I believe that every Ohioan — not just those with a four-year degree — can earn and develop the skills needed to get a good-paying job that can support a middle-class lifestyle.
Improving the lives of individuals with disabilities is a deeply personal matter for me. At a recent citizens forum for disability groups, I talked about how we can address these issues in Ohio. Neither @MikeDeWine nor @JonHusted showed up or even sent a representative.
Make no mistake — the #ACA is the ballot today in #OH12, too. @Troy_Balderson &amp; @MikeDeWine want to take us backward to a time when Ohioans could be discriminated against for having a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/kSB1kiXyV3

Danny O’Connor and his team have been working around the clock -- running on coffee and a few hours of sleep -- to do everything possible to flip Ohio’s 12th Congressional district.
I’ve always loved Election Day because after months of speeches, ads, phone calls, and door knocks, we finally get to see our democracy in action.
We also must expand broadband access. Many Ohioans pay too much for subpar service or have no access at all. We will work with towns and cities across the state to do this. On a large scale, costs will come down and quality will go up. We need to step into our future.
Ohioans depend on our infrastructure. We must repair our roads and bridges and invest in public transit to get people where they need to go. We can protect our clean water too, all without raising taxes. Check out our plan: https://t.co/0XAWKcYW3D
Over the weekend, we saw the depth and intensity of enthusiasm from huge numbers of volunteers who are determined to send @dannyoconnor1 to Congress. I am inspired by their energy and determination. https://t.co/uX2vuXtRVV
The eyes of the nation will turn to Ohio tomorrow. We have a great chance to win and send a message that we’re sick and tired of the divisive, scapegoating politics of the last 18 months. Keep working to persuade people to go out and vote for change!
Medicaid expansion and the #ACA which protects pre-existing conditions is good for both urban and rural communities in Ohio. So @MikeDeWine’s many years of opposition to both is too important to ignore. We can’t trust him to protect our health care.	https://t.co/bFko8Kd8Pr
There is no reason for Donald Trump to insult Lebron James, who is working to improve life for young people in his hometown of Akron. Trump’s tweet on Friday was ridiculous and offensive. https://t.co/M4oA016nKL
Joined my friends the Madrus yesterday to water ski at Lake White in southern Ohio. Marvelous! Good outing and didn’t even get my hair wet, though if I had tried to drop a ski I likely would have. When they have me come ski during a statewide race, I win. So go figure!
Just 3 days to go until the special election in Ohio’s 12th district on August 7th - I hope all who are able can find a canvass near them! I’ll be knocking doors today for Danny O’Connor but you can find a phone bank or canvass near you here - https://t.co/0zGDU498Fm
Donald Trump’s divisive comments here last night were nothing new, but seeing @MikeDeWine cheering every word should set off alarm bells. We need a governor who stands up to Trump when he does things to hurt Ohio, but clearly DeWine won’t. I will stand for Ohio First!
We’re committed to ensuring that Ohioans have the means to access the jobs and opportunities they need to succeed. So we will restore and rebuild our infrastructure. And no - it doesn’t mean higher taxes - it just means we need to put Ohioans first. https://t.co/T0zPeZy4i7
Infrastructure is crucial to Ohio’s future. Our plan would:	✓Repair &amp; maintain our roads, bridges &amp; freight facilities	✓Invest in public transit	✓Expand access to Broadband across the state	✓Upgrade underground infrastructure to protect our clean water https://t.co/0XAWKcYW3D
At Nationwide Children’s Hospital, I was blown away by the research that is pushing forward the frontiers of medical care and creating innovative economic opportunities. I was also blown away by the meticulous attention to detail wherever we looked. Very impressive.
I see our campaign had 5 times as many contributions as @MikeDeWine. We have the momentum and we have the support of the grassroots in Ohio who are hungry for change. I hope you’ll consider joining us by donating whatever you can. Thank you!  	https://t.co/cAPl6Jkep1
We just released our first TV commercial of the general election! As the ad says, I’m running for governor to see to it that your hard work pays off. Check it out: https://t.co/jnUdyQQpnV

When we have politicians, of either party, who genuinely understand and care about the lives of Ohioans, we can achieve solid bipartisan results: a step in the right direction for hard-working Ohioans and against the greedy payday lenders.	https://t.co/KLBgfYvvDU
This is right on. @MikeDeWine’s hypocrisy on health care has no bounds. As the author says: “Elections have consequences, and we finally deserve better.”  	https://t.co/koLfLKmEVI
President Trump is visiting Ohio on Saturday and @MikeDeWine will be cheering him on. But DeWine won’t stand up to Trump even when he is hurting Ohioans, as on health care costs. We deserve a governor who will stand up for Ohio - that’s why I’m running. Ohio First!
Ohio’s infrastructure needs an upgrade to repair our roads and bridges, invest in public transit, provide statewide access to broadband, and protect our clean water. And we can do it all without raising taxes. 	https://t.co/u4h8ZScCol
Hardly anyone got stumped yesterday. Ohio history buffs clearly knew our first capital was Chillicothe! https://t.co/V2jAoIsQx4
We all know the quality of our infrastructure is key to our success as a state. It’s how we get to work, do business, and get what we grow and manufacture here to markets. It’s roads and bridges, water and sewer, public transit, and yes - finally - broadband. Let’s get it done!
Today @BettySutton and I released our infrastructure plan for Ohio. We believe this is how we invest in our economic future, create jobs, strengthen our communities, secure clean water, and put money in the pockets of middle-class families.
Trump is intentionally sabotaging the #ACA — and @MikeDeWine's refusal to stand up to him and for Ohio's health care is just making it worse. https://t.co/cGHjXRanfL
She makes another key point also: “The federal government returns 96 cents on the dollar to help us with Medicaid expansion” - @BettySutton. This program is almost entirely paid for by the federal government and will continue to be. We can’t afford to lose out on that.
My partner @BettySutton makes a great point: Medicaid expansion helps everyone - not just those on Medicaid. When more people are insured, fewer people go to the emergency room for costly care, which drives down the cost of premiums for everyone. 	https://t.co/VloeOU8F2l
Thursday Trivia		What was Ohio's first state capital? (No Googling, no cheating.)
My last act at the CFPB was to make a tough payday lending rule the law of the land. The Congress did not have the guts to overturn it. Now Trump administration officials want to find some other way to kill it. The people of Ohio and America know better. 	https://t.co/4QfI4Ivrev
It was an honor to serve and work with President Obama as head of the CFPB. And today, it's an honor to receive his endorsement for governor. 		For the next three months, I'll work as hard as I can to earn the endorsement that matters most: the voters of Ohio. https://t.co/446BU5pJpC
3D-printed guns are a bridge too far. @MikeDeWine's position could allow criminals and the mentally ill to print their own guns at home and severely hamper our law enforcement officers from being able to do their jobs. https://t.co/R19bvXRPbJ
Jeopardy! would not be the same without the incomparable Alex Trebek, whom I had the pleasure to meet back in 1987 when I was first on the show, then again in 2014 when I was invited back as part of the Thirty Year Celebration of top winners. 	https://t.co/Lxx6IvXNX7
No surprise here: when you ask people about the work my colleagues and I did at the CFPB, most agree that financial giants should be held accountable. I will continue to fight for fairness here in Ohio by standing up for working people and their families. https://t.co/vlrGXAdxcU
I enjoyed this story. We can’t step into our future if we don’t focus more on our youth. We will work to provide funding to essential programs that educate our youth, build their skills, and prepare them for the new economy. 	https://t.co/qZUvOKIsoX
The outrageous but unsurprising CEO payouts from the recent federal tax cuts are a reminder that corporate interests have too large an influence over our politics. Ohioans need a governor who will be a backstop against the harm done by greed. 	https://t.co/bUhqqDx0X8
It's not just ECOT. Statehouse Republicans - with @MikeDeWine by their side - are the foxes guarding the henhouse in terms of lack of accountability for underperforming charter schools. They would rather protect their wealthy donors than protect taxpayers. https://t.co/lNsWc2KYGg
For years, Ohio has had the worst payday lending laws in the country while leaders in the Statehouse did little to protect the money of hard-working Ohioans. This legislation is a step in the right direction, but there is still much more work to do. https://t.co/6vBgmlXye3
Please join me in wishing a most happy birthday to @BettySutton. She has broken barriers as the first Democratic woman in Ohio to serve as a legislator at the local, county, state, AND federal levels. She’s a great partner and close friend and will make an amazing Lt. Gov. https://t.co/MteYODQN8d
This campaign is already producing some wonderful outcomes! Here you can meet Mateo, who is the newborn son of Jose, who handles all the many complications of the schedule effectively and with very good cheer. https://t.co/DSRorjZl7o
The governor’s race will determine the shape of the future for Ohio. We can choose to continue with the status quo or even move backward, or we can choose to step into our future. I believe there’s a lot of energy for change in Ohio and I’m ready to fight for that change.
One thing we see all over is that lots of Ohioans are restless. Wages are flat, health care costs are rising, and many feel left out and left behind. They think they don’t have a strong voice in Columbus.  @BettySutton and I want to be that strong voice. 	https://t.co/z6NdfOPHaX
In my soapbox speech at the State Fair this weekend, I repeated what I’ve said throughout this campaign: @MikeDeWine’s long-held opposition to #ACA and Medicaid expansion is wrong for Ohio and has been for eight long years.	https://t.co/ZPW8Mdocad
We loved welcoming so many great Democratic legislative candidates from all over Ohio to our home yesterday. We can win in November up and down the ballot, but it will take hard work and great teamwork from every one of us. Honored to be joined by Win Virginia leaders too! https://t.co/xymDW0ARZg
Beautiful day and outing yesterday to Champaign County, to see all the Wards (a whole passel of them!) and many friends. Saw their interesting irrigation system hard and effectively at work as well. https://t.co/mKtZGN5VV5
Newest CDC numbers show that overdose deaths skyrocketed in Ohio over the past year, from 4300 to 5100. They predict an 18% increase year over year, almost double the national rate of increase. We need a new direction and a changing of the guard. https://t.co/2dVY3LDdrN
Today on NASA’s birthday, I'm thinking about one of Ohio’s best and America’s best - the Honorable John Glenn. He was truly most deserving of that customary title. And he was a relentless idealist for public service, all his life. https://t.co/0Gg9Ov1Iud
Stories like this are precisely why we need to invest in Ohio communities, to unlock the freedom and the economic potential of everyone in every part of our state. https://t.co/Q5GStRXi4O

Today marks exactly 100 days until Election Day. Hard to believe we’re entering the home stretch. But maybe it’s like the Belmont Stakes, with a really LONG home stretch!
Don’t tell me Germany has better apprenticeship programs than we have here in America. If you mistakenly think that, check out what the building trades do every day here in Ohio. They produce skilled labor of the highest order who do quality work for the rest of their lives.
Happy belated birthday to Frances Strickland - actually it was last week, but who’s counting? I can recall singing “My Girl” to her on our ice cream social tour through southern Ohio almost ten years ago. “I’ve got sunshine on a cloudy day” indeed!
The for-profit charter school cheaters at ECOT bankrolled @MikeDeWine &amp; @JonHusted for years in their campaigns. Now that our taxpayer money is already gone, he’s frantically dreaming up lawsuits that could have mattered had he started on them sooner. https://t.co/RTaCxIUMNf
This week, @BettySutton and I announced a comprehensive plan to reduce costs and expand reliable health coverage for all Ohioans - starting with preserving and protecting the Medicaid expansion that my opponent said would not exist if he became governor. 	https://t.co/5cZ1wdsIrU
Yesterday marked 28 years since passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We celebrated with an excellent candidate forum hosted by the Center for Disability Empowerment to build on that work in Ohio. https://t.co/B0IMamMm8g
The evidence is crystal clear. Early childhood intervention and quality preschool programming improve school readiness - and help address other problems like infant mortality, workforce readiness, and criminal justice costs. This is not a partisan issue.	https://t.co/4HVtYrj3AD
It's great to hear @JohnKasich affirm his support for the Medicaid expansion he brought to Ohio. It's also telling that it’s easier to get a straight answer out of him in a few seconds on the street than out of @MikeDeWine in a year on the campaign trail. 	https://t.co/1pz1ljWYli

For almost a decade, @MikeDeWine has fought the ACA and Medicaid expansion at every turn. A leopard can’t change his spots. We simply can’t trust @MikeDeWine to protect health care for Ohioans.
We can reduce costs and provide better, more reliable coverage by: 	✓ Protecting Medicaid expansion	✓ Investing in primary and preventive care 	✓ Increasing transparency and accountability for consumers	https://t.co/6lYgfYUKFi
Ohio’s health care system is set up to protect powerful special interests like the big drug companies - not to look out for the middle class. Betty Sutton and I will change that approach.
We've just learned that drug-related deaths in Ohio increased at double the national average in the last year. @MikeDeWine has failed us on the opioid crisis - we will address it as the public health crisis that it is. https://t.co/enrvfGQyI7
As I’ve said before, Ohio has the worst payday lending laws in the country. Leaders in the Statehouse must continue to improve our consumer protections so Ohioans aren’t getting ripped off by unscrupulous predatory lenders. https://t.co/2GIUNwlSrH
This is the second time in a week that @MikeDeWine was caught making false statements to advance his campaign. I guess 42 years as a politician has taught him that misleading the voters can fool some people - but it won’t work this year. https://t.co/PcszcLakF7
The @FOPOhio’s endorsement is always hard-fought. Our officers deserve a governor who stands for fairness in the workplace and at the bargaining table and makes sure they have the resources they need to keep us all safe. I’m honored to have their support! https://t.co/EZ1irqIfWd
Ohioans shouldn’t lose a chance at having a future because of an addiction or because their disease is being treated as a crime. This initiative is the right thing to do, would save big money, and would help us combat the opioid epidemic. https://t.co/D24IAwSQG4

When I talk about spreading out economic opportunity across Ohio so that nobody is left out or left behind, that includes our farm communities. We need to focus support on small businesses, including our farms, and finally deliver broadband throughout the state. Fairness to all!
Forty-nine years ago today, Neil Armstrong of Wapakoneta and the crew of Apollo 11 returned to Earth. When Americans put our minds to it, we can accomplish incredible things. We all need to visualize the future and an Ohio whose best days are yet to come.

The FOP BBQ, this year in Independence, is always worth the anticipation. A chance to hear people’s thoughts and concerns, to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. Building lines of open communication that will help us work together to protect public safety in Ohio.
Ohio farmers are being unfairly squeezed by policies out of Washington and Columbus. Many are teetering on the edge of solvency. This year it’s time for a protest vote to say “Stop ignoring us. Listen to what we have to say, bring everyone to the table, and support our farmers!”
Ohio farms feed the nation and the world; we must see that our complex environmental challenges don’t change that. Our practices must be sustainable and we must protect our clean water. Our farmers need support with improved tools and strategies and with everyone at the table.
So squatter Mulvaney has now offered up his sub-squatter Kathy Kraninger as the nominee for my old job at CFPB. But they are two inert peas in a pod, with little apparent interest in providing consumers with much financial protection. https://t.co/5R7nku8vC1
Glad to run into Jack Markell recently. In Delaware, he was a true consumer finance governor, creating an Office of Financial Empowerment to work on financial education for students, financial coaching for adults, securing bank and credit union accounts, etc. A great role model.
As AG, our team recovered $2 billion for Ohio retirees, including law enforcement officers. In the budget crisis, we secured $4 million in drug abuse prevention funds for local law enforcement – saving jobs in many parts of Ohio. And we were first to take on human trafficking.

In Victory: Magnanimity. In Peace: Goodwill.” We are resolute to win this race for the future of Ohio. https://t.co/pi1xO8aaz5
We also know in our hearts that we must embrace the talents of everyone if Ohio is going to move ahead as we should. We can’t make the kind of progress we deserve if we push anyone out or leave them behind. Our youngest generation knows this best, but we all need to get it too.
Jobs and economic opportunity are the top responsibility for every Governor, as everything else flows from that. We need to step into our future with clean energy, advanced manufacturing, workforce development, support for small businesses, revitalized infrastructure, and more.
Local safety forces and first responders need resources and tools for prevention, education, and law enforcement to deal with the opioid crisis. @BettySutton and I will make sure we fund and support local government in partnership to address these bigger problems.
The opioid crisis is killing 14 Ohioans a day - but @MikeDeWine had no plan to fight it until this year, as the death toll mounted. We need broader solutions like protecting Medicaid expansion and spreading out economic opportunity across the state. 	https://t.co/pWhlYz60ML

The #ACA is under attack, both from the Trump administration AND from @MikeDeWine, who has opposed the entire law - including Medicaid expansion - for 8 years and now says something else. We can’t trust him to protect our health care. I am strong and dependable on these issues.
"For years, @MikeDeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion." As I've said before, this is such an enormous flip-flop that it's more like a belly flop. Ohioans cannot trust Mike DeWine to protect their health care. https://t.co/l3h51litVv

As I demanded, the House has now scheduled a vote on the payday lending bill. But there is still time for the FORTY-ONE payday loan lobbyists working the bill to make mischief as they were hired to do. All the while, more Ohioans are being hurt by the worst laws in the nation.
The ECOT scandal involves the defrauding of taxpayers. The wealthy CEO made off with $180 million of our money, after dispensing millions in campaign money for Republican officials to look the other way. Mike DeWine never lifted a finger to stop it. #SendThemaWakeUpCall.

Ironically and happily on #MandelaDay, I sat yesterday with Bishop McKinley Young and learned many things, including that he served as the Bishop of the AME Church in South Africa when Mandela was released and then elected President. Wow!
On #MandelaDay I think of all that Nelson Mandela did to heal his country and the world through greatness of soul and fostering a spirit of reconciliation. His Long Walk to Freedom is one of my favorite books. We can all learn from him about thinking more broadly than oneself.
.@JohnKasich is right. This time calls for us to stand with #CountryOverParty — so why won't @MikeDeWine speak out? Because he has decided that he needs to navigate his political base, which means he is putting party and self above country. https://t.co/hpGDM8Ow5c
It’s impossible to see @MikeDeWine as anything other than the embodiment of the status quo. When @BettySutton and I win, we’ll bring change to a state legislature that collapsed into corruption this year and has been retrograde on so many issues that impair our future.
We need a Governor who will stand tall to protect hard-working Ohioans, not for political gain but because it’s the right thing to do. Not to get an endorsement or headline, but because it’s what our neighbors always do and have always done for one another. It’s the Ohio Way.
Spoke from the heart at the Churches of God in Christ Town Hall last night. There are many injustices in the world, and far too few chances to take them on and fix them. This year provides the opportunity to step up and do that. We can not afford to miss out on it. https://t.co/KlJVE8coV6

Talk is cheap. If @MikeDeWine really supports protections for pre-existing conditions, why hasn’t he stood up for them as AG? Instead, he’s fought AGAINST them, and the entire #ACA, at every turn. What he says now cannot be squared with what he has done.	https://t.co/fAIbNEHRp3
President Trump’s refusal to stand up to Vladimir Putin speaks volumes, as does the silence of many Republican politicians - including @MikeDeWine - who are so afraid of their base voters that they won’t ever call him out. Patriotism should come before party.
Ohio has not paid enough attention to pre-natal care, post-natal care, infant mortality, mammograms, and women’s health screenings (where the legislature defunded Planned Parenthood). This key area is a priority for @BettySutton and me, and we will set a new direction.
.@BettySutton co-sponsored the Children’s Health Insurance Program Program (CHIP) and has long been a leader on children’s health issues. Betty and I will expand on CHIP to ensure that no Ohio child is left behind without essential access to health care.
Here are the facts:	✓DeWine ran for AG in 2010 on stopping ACA 	✓On his 1st day in office, he sued to block ACA, but he failed	✓In the GOP primary, he repeatedly attacked his rival who wanted to end Medicaid expansion	✓Now, ?? One thing we know is that nobody can count on him
.@MikeDeWine has spent the last decade fighting the #ACA. Now that he sees the political winds shifting, he wants to claim he is singing a different tune. Unfortunately, his songbook is full of lyrics on all sides of the issues, and he veers among them for naked political gain.
Great event yesterday at our house with Democrats @SteveDettelbach, @ZackSpaceOhio, @RobforOHIO @KathleenClyde, our dog Tucker, and hundreds of grassroots supporters who are so hungry for change in Ohio. Both @BettySutton &amp; I are honored to fight alongside you. https://t.co/RXl9gFCauD
RT @KathleenClyde: We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us but I am excited to be in this fight to #TakeBackOhio with @RichCordray @BettySutton…
Ohio needs to step into its future and become a more progressive state. That is what the youngest generation is teaching us: inclusion, diversity, tolerance, embracing the talents of every Ohioan. And it will be good for business as well.
Illegitimate Mulvaney again drops efforts I undertook to recover $60 million for consumers from debt collectors who violated the law. Instead, they paid less than $1 million. When people get cheated or mistreated, they deserve their money back! That always seemed clear to me.
Where does @MikeDeWine stand on protecting the 1.3 million Ohio workers who could have their pensions cut or eliminated altogether? I've fought for fairness to working people throughout my time in public service and and will continue to do so as Governor.	https://t.co/XauRKgDmDc
Pension cuts could affect 1.3 million workers in our state who earned their pensions and deserve to have their promises kept. Ohioans need a governor who will stand up for working people, not side with Statehouse lobbyists. https://t.co/4lzndPyZ6D
Another #flipflop from @MikeDeWine. Too little, too late, as $180 million is gone now. If he was at all serious about ECOT corruption, he would start by returning the $36,000 that the DeWine-Husted campaign still has from ECOT and their lobbyists. 	https://t.co/HUMfYzfCy4
It’s wrong to #flipflop on an issue as important as health care for political gain. We need leaders who don’t just put their finger in the political wind, because where will they be when push comes to shove? Who can tell for sure? Who can count on them? Ohio deserves better. https://t.co/T6fpZw5VNk
To borrow a phrase, @MikeDeWine was against Medicaid expansion before he was for it. In fact, he was against it in the 2010 campaign, against it in his failed lawsuit to block the ACA, against it in the Republican primary, now suddenly says he was for it all along. Oh really!
Toledo's 2014 drinking water crisis was a direct result of a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie - just like this one. We all know that clean water is fundamental to our health AND to our economy. 	https://t.co/bQ7WXwC43Y
We have the worst payday loan laws in the nation. We also have dozens of payday loan lobbyists swarming the Statehouse, bringing scandal and corruption in their wake. They brought down a Speaker. Don’t bet against them to kill efforts for reform.
It makes me mad when people take advantage of others and treat them unfairly. That includes gouging people with costly payday loans. And it includes mistreating taxpayers, like the ECOT scandal where we were defrauded of $180 million and some made out like the bandits they are.
.@MikeDeWine has already said that as governor he would place extremely harsh restrictions on women’s decisions about their reproductive rights. Make no mistake: these rights are on the ballot this November. We need a governor who will stand up for them. 	https://t.co/KxDIeASQiw
Continued efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act will hurt many Ohioans. These irresponsible attacks on health care will cause all of us to pay more for health insurance, plain and simple. 	https://t.co/FteJAXjvhZ
The answer is ‘All of the above’. DeWine's stance on Medicaid expansion changes like the East Wind — all for the sake of political expediency. https://t.co/wCizVbpmsC
Until the House sets a vote on the revised payday lending bill, we can’t know what will happen. If it goes over to a lame-duck session, bet on the 41 lobbyists for the payday lenders finding a way to kill it. All the while, Ohioans are being gouged with interest rates near 600%.
Today I'm standing with the @MineWorkers and @Teamsters who are rightly demanding protection for the pensions of working people. Retirees shouldn’t have to worry about their pension being eliminated through no fault of their own. #ProtectOurPensions https://t.co/MTB3dqDmRN
As the Supreme Court shifts, we need to be our own backstop to protect our rights. I am ready to do that as Governor. Ohio women are at grave risk of losing their right to make their own personal health decisions unless we stand with them and fight back. https://t.co/9qbImNCr4N
.@MikeDeWine spent millions in the GOP primary attacking Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor for supporting Medicaid expansion. His changed position is an obvious flip-flop with his finger in the political wind. When push comes to shove, nobody can count on him. They CAN count on me.
Unlike @MikeDeWine, my position on Medicaid expansion has been clear from the start: Hard-working Ohioans shouldn’t have to worry about whether they or their families can afford the health care they need.

Great to be in Lucas County touring the Oregon Clean Energy Center. This is a win-win-win for Ohio. It keeps energy bills down for consumers and businesses, protects the environment, and encourages new businesses to move here. https://t.co/Bg6wzUSz4e https://t.co/YubJ87wU6N
Ohioans know a failure when they see one, as @MikeDeWine sat on his hands for years. All the while, he took political money from ECOT’s special interests - until taxpayers had been defrauded to the tune of $180 million. Now the damage is already done. https://t.co/DX5Oa0eqFX
42 years as a politician has trained @MikeDeWine well. He promised to get rid of Medicaid expansion to win the primary and now is changing his position for nakedly political reasons. This is such an enormous flip-flop that it's more likely a belly flop! https://t.co/PGyRmbBo8t
I had said that if the legislature fails to reform Ohio’s worst payday loan laws in the nation, we will flay them mercilessly through the summer and fall. The jury is still out until we see what, if anything, finally passes. For now, people are still being hurt badly every day.

With four months to go in a tight governor race, @MikeDeWine finally calls ECOT “corrupt.” But he couldn’t find a way to say it when it would have counted, as they made off with $180 million of ill-gotten gains through lying about their attendance records. Too little, too late!
RT @BettySutton: My running mate, @RichCordray, is a public servant through and through. Here are 11 quick things you might not know about…
In Ohio, we must put fairness to people and their families first. We must respect women's personal decisions about their health, not dictate to them. We must defend the rights of working people to bargain collectively for fair pay and a safe workplace. All worth fighting for.
The upcoming battle over the Supreme Court reminds us again of why @BettySutton and I are fighting so hard in this campaign. Ohioans need a key backstop in place for them - a Governor who will fight against efforts to undermine our rights.
An “all of the above” energy strategy for Ohio would create good-paying jobs, revitalize rural communities, reduce the cost of energy bills, and protect our clean air and clean water. Only the stubbornness of human beings stands in the way.
There’s no reason why Ohio can’t lead the nation in clean energy. As a reminder to all of us, Cleveland’s own Charles Brush built the world first wind turbine to power his home in the 19th century.
In 2008, Ohio fined a group led by @BetsyDeVos $5.3 million for laundering campaign money to Republicans like @JonHusted. @MikeDeWine sued and in 6 years has recovered ZERO. Now he says he’ll get our ECOT money back. He has ZERO credibility.	https://t.co/mzVqOdScRR
They’ve sent @BetsyDeVos to tour a Toledo high school today. She’s spent her life running down public schools and boosting for-profit education that rips off taxpayers. She’s no role model for us in Ohio. 	https://t.co/ESa0OrGwfV.
We rank #38 in renewable energy production and #31 in energy efficiency. We need to step into our future with a more aggressive and comprehensive energy strategy. We can do much better.
There’s a misguided ideological agenda in the state legislature in Columbus that’s holding back the renewable energy sector from investing in Ohio and creating jobs.
Sitting with Rich Nathan recently, he spoke of the vertical and horizontal aspects of faith. Vertical is our own relationship to God, horizontal is what we do to improve life for others. It reminded me vividly of Dr. King’s sermon on “The Dimensions of a Complete Life.”
We must make sound investments in early childhood development, K-12 education, and a flexible spectrum of training and education that includes our community colleges. We will close the skills gap and sow the foundations of lasting futures in all Ohio families and communities.
We need to work more closely with our colleges and universities to commercialize our strong research and development work. I am hearing win-win ideas to create more opportunity in this state while bringing down the cost of higher education, and I am keenly interested.
Ohio needs to step into its future with a strong commitment to clean air and clean water, finding good jobs in renewable clean energy while pursuing an “all of the above” energy strategy that works for sustainable communities. We can do that and we will do that.
We heard promises about infrastructure in the Presidential campaign that have not been kept. Ohio needs a renewed commitment to fix our roads and bridges, upgrade our water and sewer and the grid, improve transit, and finally provide broadband across the state.
To spread out economic opportunity across Ohio so that nobody is left out or left behind, we should start with a commitment to support our homegrown small businesses that employ half our workforce and are the source of much innovation and ingenuity in our economy.

Scott Pruitt is gone, but his negative impact on Ohio’s environment persists - including his failure to protect our Great Lakes and especially our troubled western basin of Lake Erie.
This is a lame and flimsy excuse. Nobody tied @MikeDewine’s hands other than his ECOT political donors. He had the authority to stop them from abusing taxpayers and failing our children but chose not to do so when it would have mattered.	https://t.co/vUAgnPTbKu

Hearing the wrenching stories around Ohio of people and their parents and children who have pre-existing conditions and should not have to worry about losing their health care makes it all the more maddening that @MikeDeWine will not stand with us to protect them.
What a colossal mess! There are real human costs to this ECOT scandal (not to mention more than $60 million still missing) and @MikeDewine's refusal to take action until now. https://t.co/hMAEG43XTf
Scott Pruitt richly deserved to lose his job. He opposed the mission of the EPA from the start and did not believe even in the kinds of measures we all embrace to protect our clean air and clean water. And then again and again he abused the trust of the taxpayers.
Roundtable today with Aftab Pureval at Cincinnati School of Nursing on the importance of keeping protections for pre-existing conditions. @MikeDeWine never has and never will stand up for Ohioans on this key issue - he was against it right from the start. https://t.co/A87vuc1B54

With the Supreme Court battle looming, the fight for women’s reproductive rights turns to the states, and @BettySutton and I will continue fighting hard to protect these rights in Ohio. The stakes have now been raised this year.	https://t.co/GAwa6YXK2d
I will fight hard to keep the Medicaid expansion in Ohio, which means taking on the legislature if it continues to be opposed. We also will cost-effectively expand CHIP in Ohio. DeWine has said none of those things. His plan for children has gaping holes in it.
Massively bummed about LeBron.
One problem with DeWine's credibility on his early childhood plan is his record showing that when push comes to shove, politics and special interests can take priority over kids. He voted against the Children’s Health Insurance program (CHIP) and against funding for Head Start.
So @MikeDeWine has rolled out his early childhood plan. I agree that this is an important issue, and in some areas I would go even further. But it won’t mean much if we end the Medicaid expansion as he has pledged to do. That would be a few steps forward and many steps back.
Spoke with the American Legion about the service bonus we pushed through the legislature that voters approved in 2008 to recognize those who served in the Gulf War, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

I told my story of running for Governor at Buckeye Boys State and was my party nominee but finished second to Philip Saunders of Bedford Heights, the first African-American ever elected. We ran a great race and I was proud of us both. Now this year we will redeem that effort.

This is a fantastic model for how to get Ohioans the skills they need to succeed in the current economy. Early education is the best way to prepare our young people to enter and compete in the workforce. https://t.co/eE2z5NOeiq
Republicans have been desperate to smooth over their pay-to-play scandal on payday lender lobbyists. Yet the lobbyists have such a chokehold on the legislature that they can’t shake loose an actual reform bill without gutting consumer protections. Get the broom! We need change!
Last night, I attended a Muslim community roundtable. We have respected community leaders who have brought their talents and built their lives here, and we are all the better for having new Americans want to join us here. It is high time to stand up and say so.

We brought people together all over Ohio to save people’s homes from foreclosure. In the same way, we can bring people together all over Ohio to fight the opioid crisis. Listening to one another, respecting one another, learning from one another, working together - the Ohio way.
I’ve spent many years fighting to protect Ohioans from predatory lenders. @BettySutton and I will continue to protect people from special interests and those who take advantage of them, making sure people are treated fairly and with dignity and respect.
And @MikeDeWine will reverse the progress we made on expanding Medicaid. He will kick 700,000 Ohioans off their health care — and we’ll all pay higher premiums as they come to our emergency rooms with more serious and costly problems. @BettySutton and I won't let that happen.
Today is the third anniversary of King v Burwell — when the Supreme Court upheld the ACA as constitutional. Yet some, including Mike DeWine, keep trying to take us back to a time when you could lose your health care due to a pre-existing condition.
Enjoyed our evening in Geauga County last night at Bessie Benner Metzenbaum Park, which does so much to serve the developmentally disabled in that part of the state. We all agreed that we need to work for change and progress in Ohio. Fired up and ready to go! https://t.co/w8IvepQstd

Payday loan lobbyists are intent on weakening the bill now in the Ohio Senate. They want to keep their business model that exploits Ohioans with ruinous interest rates on payday loans. They’ve bought politicians and now they expect to get what they’ve paid for.

Everything I am hearing about how we can fight and beat infant mortality in Ohio leads to the same conclusions: We must protect the Medicaid expansion and we must find a way to provide critical care and screenings for mothers.
We just held our third roundtable event on Ohio’s infant mortality problem. Our infant mortality rate is unacceptable and it is even higher in the African-American community. With state and local officials working closely together, we can do better.

Just when we think it can’t possibly get worse, it turns out ECOT paid out over half a million dollars in “hush money” last year. They knew they were guilty and used stolen taxpayer money to try to cover up their fraud. https://t.co/UZz3CBB2sy
Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with respect, no matter how they look or who they love.  It's also key to economic growth.  Backward-looking laws will keep us from competing with other states to attract new businesses and good jobs to Ohio.
Instead of agreeing to protect those with pre-existing conditions, @MikeDeWine remains opposed to Obamacare, including the Medicaid expansion. That means 700,000 Ohioans would lose their coverage, and we all will pay for more costly emergency room care.
Yesterday, I called on @MikeDeWine to take a stand for millions of Ohioans living with pre-existing conditions. As Attorney General, he can and should intervene in the federal lawsuit to save the mandate that health insurers sell policies to those with chronic conditions.
The answer is 1953. Although Ohio seemingly joined the Union as the 17th state in 1803, it wasn't until 1953 that the U.S. House of Representatives officially ratified Ohio's state constitution, granting us official statehood. https://t.co/envwW6hjLy
Met with Urbancrest Mayor Joe Barnes today, my old friend, minister, and fellow basketball player who could not be moved on the court. Now steadfast in his efforts for the community! https://t.co/DEkmPEq8zf
@MikeDeWine is doing a poor job of managing the AG’s office. He fumbled the clothing allowance for BCI law enforcement agents for three years. Rather than fix it, he refuses to treat them fairly. Many also have expired vests that pose a safety risk - more mismanagement.
RT @SherrodBrown: When I was Secretary of State, we set up voter registration sites in high schools, food banks, in the Bureau of Motor Veh…
We know that @JonHusted's model for purging Ohio voters from the rolls disproportionately hurts African-American voters. That is wrong, and it is manifestly unjustified. https://t.co/nMytkEGUtE
The payday loan rule we adopted at the CFPB says lenders must ensure that a borrower is able to repay a loan before making it. @MickMulvaneyOMB and predatory lenders are trying to block our rule, but so far the courts have refused. https://t.co/wyoC35BG8F
Thursday Trivia		Q: When was Ohio technically granted statehood? (no googling, no cheating!)
The Justice Department has now announced that they will not defend the protections for people with pre-existing conditions who lose their health care when they change jobs. This is a core issue for Ohioans and they are just walking away. #OhioDeservesBetter
And Mike DeWine presumably agrees with his buddy Jeff Sessions at DOJ that we should now be stripped of the protections for people with pre-existing conditions - which could be any one of us or any family member based on some new diagnosis we might get tomorrow, or next week.
@MikeDeWine has fought Obamacare at every turn to please his right-wing base. All Ohioans bear the cost of his ideological crusading. He opposes Medicaid expansion and would shove 700,000 people back into the shadows, making us all pay their expensive emergency room care.
Today is National Weed Your Garden Day. Excessive, unwanted weeds crowd out plant roots and steal nutrients that are needed for the plants to grow. Kind of like Republicans stealing a billion dollars from public schools for scam-factory ECOT. We must weed our garden. #OHGOV
Good businesses who care about their customers want strong, even-handed enforcement against the cheaters who engage in unfair competition and tarnish everyone in the market. It is not only possible, it is right to be both pro-business and pro-consumer. I will be that Governor.
It was then-Governor Ronald Reagan who said: “Free men engaged in free enterprise build better nations with more and better goods and services, higher wages and higher standards of living for more people. But free enterprise is not a hunting license.” Amen to that!
.@MickMulvaneyOMB does not have his eye on the ball. He is backing off the payday lenders and he allowed scam artists at PHH to skirt the mortgage lending laws and make off with many millions in kickbacks. But he is getting the sign changed from “CFPB” to “BCFP.” Effective!
If Husted’s model to block registered voters from taking part in our electoral process were adopted in other states, millions more around the country would be locked out of a democratic process that relies on their valuable voices. 	https://t.co/gzj6Tlqlmx
Yesterday’s ruling, @JonHusted said, “is a victory for election integrity” and “can serve as a model for other states to use.” Purging registered voters may be a personal political goal for @JonHusted, but it does nothing for election integrity and blocks the right to vote.
The billion wasted dollars that ECOT stole from children and schools and taxpayers makes me angry. Republicans allowed ECOT to divert this money based on fraud, then turned around and accepted ECOT money to fund their political campaigns.	https://t.co/YgSr1ush8n
Voting is an American right and it should not be politicized by anyone for political gain. Democracy relies on the participation of everyone and we should be making it easier to vote - not harder. https://t.co/YqIJOHXCFx
My running mate @BettySutton is spending the day in Ashtabula and Willoughby to discuss how the ECOT scandal has hurt our local schools and our children, and to discuss what we’ll do about it as Gov and Lt. Gov. #OhioDeservesBetter
This is wrong. The Internet has become a necessity and we have a responsibility to keep it open and accessible to all. As governor, I'll issue an executive order requiring net neutrality rules in order to do business with Ohio. https://t.co/FSPzHWbCeL
This is troubling. @MikeDeWine did not take seriously a clear risk to the lives of our law enforcement officers who risk so much for us all. We need a governor who will pay attention to the details so these things don’t happen. https://t.co/nV0wDAeXD6
We need to get this right. As college has become less affordable for many, we must invest in our community colleges so that all Ohioans have the opportunity to get the skills and training they need to succeed in today’s economy.	https://t.co/2wIgwyhgUh
My new friend Conor Lamb talked about how the work we did at CFPB to take on abusive debt collectors reinforced how people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when that does not happen someone needs to do something about it, as we resolutely did.
Really glad to spend time yesterday with @ConorLambPA, who showed the entire country that a law-and-order candidate who will fight for the rights of working people can win over voters in Western PA, right across the line from Eastern OH. That’s my formula as well. https://t.co/xu4twsvd0G
Hard to see how raising rents on some of the poorest Americans could raise their quality of life or be an appropriate response to the struggles they face every day. Yet that’s what HUD is doing. Sad and heartless - another federal agency subverting its core mission.
Working Ohioans deserve to know we have their backs. And they deserve to be paid what they’re owed. As Governor, I will go after companies that commit wage theft or that cheat other law-abiding businesses and workers by misusing 1099s. https://t.co/vj9N4Ckswg
Last week, we commemorated D-Day and the debt of gratitude we owe to all who serve our country. I was honored to attend the VFW State Conference to stress the importance of making sure our veterans and their families are treated fairly. @BettySutton and I will always do that. https://t.co/ErB2Uu4KKw
I spoke at the Ohio Association of Community Colleges to discuss the plan @BettySutton and I have laid out for investing in them and in our people. Our plan will enable every Ohioan to get the skills and training they need to succeed.
Even after a last devastating defeat last night, I still loved this Cavs team this year. They battled through many obstacles to get to the finals, and with a few bounces here and there and some better officiating, it would be 2-2 right now.
“It took an FBI investigation to finally have this bill on the House floor,” said Rep. Kathleen Clyde. My thoughts exactly. Only the exposure of corruption that threatens their own political careers spurs action. #SicknessInTheStatehouse https://t.co/mRpUZJmUIG
Thank you @HRC. @BettySutton and I have long stood on the side of fairness and equality for the LGBTQ+ community and human rights for all. We look forward to working for full equality here in Ohio. https://t.co/6rxOE0CTMl
The answer is 49. The only state in the country to not share a single letter with the word “mackerel” is ... OHIO! That’s mackerel as in “rotten mackerel.” https://t.co/Ub2jtPxU9D
We are still learning more about ECOT corruption. Republicans took millions in political money and enabled their donors to cheat Ohio children, parents, and taxpayers. They should be ashamed! #SicknessInTheStatehouse 		https://t.co/w6CXdvOjZL
The CFPB advisory board was filled with conscientious people who took no pay to give their perspectives on the struggles of American families. And @MickMulvaneyOMB just fired them all because he doesn’t give a damn about any of that. 	https://t.co/oTWk8Lws3D
Thursday Trivia		Q: How many states share a letter with the word 'mackerel' ? (no googling, no cheating!)
AAAARRGGHH! The Cavs have been a team to love this year, through all the many twists and turns of this very long season. That tough loss last night hurt something fierce.
Their stories are powerful reminders of why I’m running for governor. Hard-working Ohioans can’t afford more of do-nothing DeWine. As I’ve always done in public service, I’ll give people a voice and will fight to make sure they are treated fairly, with dignity and respect. https://t.co/k4PEvDIu5y
Met with friends and colleagues in Cleveland yesterday who had stories to tell about predatory mortgage lenders and people facing foreclosure. When I was State Treasurer, I worked with nonprofits like ESOP to take on these lenders and keep people in their homes.
As Party Chair, @DavidPepper has built a solid bench of great public servants, organized grassroots in all 88 counties, and offered a Democratic vision for Ohio. He has earned another four years leading the @OHDems, and we are glad to work with him to win this year!
For seven weeks, Ohio House Republicans haven’t passed a single bill or even held a legislative session. They are all caught up in themselves and not working for or thinking about what the people of Ohio need. There is a sickness in the Statehouse. Cordray-Sutton is the cure!
Warm thanks to former Virginia Governor @TerryMcAuliffe for coming last night and helping propel us forward. He set an example of being a pro-business governor who is also progressive and inclusive - @BettySutton and I share a commitment to that same direction for Ohio.
“those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.” “Let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God’s work must truly be our own.” All just as true now as then.
Bobby Kennedy died 50 years ago. As he taught us, “Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring”
Today is the 74th anniversary of D-Day. I have walked the beach there and imagined young people, who were my own children’s age, risking their all to fight for America’s freedom. And thank God they did so. We all should be deeply grateful.
I was in Springfield yesterday to discuss how we can more effectively tackle the growing opioid crisis. Ohio is hurting, 2017 was an awful year, and it’s clear we can do better. We need to get law enforcement and treatment specialists the tools they need to do their jobs. https://t.co/rDVxWkJXmo
Anyone serious about the opioid crisis can see that if we turn back the Medicaid expansion, we cannot beat this epidemic. We won’t have the resources or the treatment options to do it. Mike DeWine would be a disaster for Ohio.	https://t.co/eilImVT9JN
Republican legislators prioritize big tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of key local services desperately needed around the state. So we have police and fire going begging, one of the worst opioid problems in the nation, and communities compromised. That is all wrong.
Risking the loss of a thousand jobs in the Mahoning Valley, not getting safe and updated voting machines, and holding fast to the worst payday loan laws in the nation are among the casualties of a dysfunctional Ohio Statehouse thanks to Republican corruption scandals.
If @realdonaldtrump moves to restrict federal funding for @PPFA, I will join other governors to take legal action to preserve it. Health and wellness services provided by Planned Parenthood are essential for women and their families.	https://t.co/VOHG76boHE
Working people deserve to have Ohio’s leaders watching their backs. Those who are already organized know @BettySutton and I will do that. Meanwhile, @MikeDeWine won’t say where he stands on so-called “Right To Work” laws. Which means he can’t be trusted in a pinch.
Great weekend events with @AFSCME and @ocsea. @BettySutton and I will always stand on the side of fairness to Ohio workers. They are the backbone of our state and we'll fight hard to support and defend them, just as they are now fighting hard to get us elected. https://t.co/FXSyQCRUmV
.@MikeDeWine long ago bought into the partisan and ideological view that he had to be against anything relating to Obamacare. Now he’s stuck, and his stubborn stupidity on this issue will cost Ohio dearly. We deserve better, and @BettySutton and I will be that better choice.
We all get hurt if we lose the Medicaid expansion. Federal money that would come to Ohio will instead go elsewhere. And the people without access to health care will show up instead in emergency rooms with serious and costly medical problems. We all will pay for that.
Even though federal dollars - not Ohio dollars - will cover 90 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion, DeWine refuses to support it. He wants to strip away health care from 700,000 people. That’s wrong and bad for Ohio.	https://t.co/FbwfH5vTVH
The Cavs again played with heart for three quarters last night and then, as that great team will sometimes do, they shot us out of their gym in the fourth quarter. Things will  be very different at the Q! But we need to keep up the strong defensive pressure.
I recall once Dad was upset about something at work, as he hadn’t been treated well. I asked him about the motives of who was doing that. He paused and said, “Well, I guess they’re trying to make a living, just like me.” I learned to avoid questioning people’s motives.
Over his career, my Dad became an administrator. I learned a lot from him. He was a genius at putting himself in others’ shoes to see the world from their point of view. He always preached harmony on every team, looking out for one another, helping everyone to be at their best.
Even with limited vision, Dad was a whiz of a card player, one of the tip-top at contract bridge. He, and my Mom too, won dozens of trophies. At the end of a long day, he remembered every hand: what was bid or should have been bid, what was played or should have been played.
Dad was a big homebody at heart. When I was around the country with the CFPB, he often asked where I was. Then he would invariably say, “Get home soon.” He liked knowing his people were all at home, where we belonged. Now I’m here all the time again. He would have liked that.
My Dad has always been my hero in so many ways. Although legally blind, he never let that hold him back. He taught us early on that the “woulda/shoulda/coulda” club was a poor excuse for pressing forward to get things done - usually for others rather than for oneself.
Thank you for visiting today, @KamalaHarris! I had a great time with you today talking about the issues that matter most to Ohioans and how we can address them. I appreciate your support and your friendship. https://t.co/I4xcJ1bUu0
In the wake of the financial crisis, @KamalaHarris was California's AG and I was Ohio's AG. We both worked to save people’s homes and we stood up against those who cheated them. She knows what it means to fight for people against all odds.
Today I’m wearing what little orange I own in solidarity with Ohioans - including many responsible gun owners - worried about the senseless loss of life in our streets and our schools from gun violence. We can and must do more to save lives - and I will as Governor. #WearOrange
Pre-school is the most reliable way now, outside the home, to identify health issues and learning disabilities among young children. Greater access to pre-school, and wrap-around services at K-12 schools, will be positive for every child’s education, opportunities, and success.
I agree with the Ohio Children's Hospital Association and Groundwork Ohio. Preschool educational and developmental programming builds a crucial foundation for children to succeed, and should be available to every child.	https://t.co/1SQAnwax3z
Pressing the case for criminal justice reform yesterday. Many believe it costs us far too much to house drug addicts in our prisons. Others believe we are needlessly and unjustly wasting people’s lives and destroying their futures. Both are right, and we need to work for change.
For Ohio to reach its full potential, we must be inclusive and tolerant and embrace the talents of everyone. We are not there yet, and though we are making progress we still have miles to go before we sleep. Happy Pride Month! https://t.co/QVIVI05Qun

We can see that @MikeDeWine won't stand plainly and clearly with middle-class families against so-called Right To Work legislation. Ohioans have long made their views known: They want fairness in the workplace. So do Betty and I! https://t.co/rK2DQZ2yao
My running mate, @BettySutton, created the Cash for Clunkers program which saved 60,000 good-paying union jobs and helped save America’s auto industry. There's only one team in this race who will fight for working Ohioans and who have the record to prove it. #OHGov

Big Labor Rally in Columbus last night at the Firefighters Hall. @BettySutton and I have always fought for fairness to the people, who deserve better than to be ignored or exploited in favor of the special interests. That goes above all for those who uphold the dignity of work.

In Virginia, 400,000 more people now get health coverage through Medicaid - a huge win! Now let’s look in the mirror and elect Cordray-Sutton to protect the same program that provides health care to 700,000 Ohioans. https://t.co/hBn7XtMk7B
Working people who stand together to forge an organized collective voice for fair treatment and better working conditions show the way toward progress and advancement in America. They always have. They always will. @BettySutton and I stand with them.
Mike DeWine has made no progress on ECOT. He took tens of thousands of dollars in political contributions to look the other way as they failed our children, defrauded taxpayers, and made off with $1 billion of our money.	https://t.co/9Wo1HkEpFp
As Governor, I will protect health care for 700,000 Ohioans through the Medicaid expansion. I will support and build on our best local efforts on infant mortality. And I will fight to restore funding for Planned Parenthood to provide screenings and care to pregnant women
Important roundtable discussion in Cleveland today with leaders on our infant mortality crisis. Ohio has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country and has the second worst infant mortality rate for for African-American babies. This is absolutely unacceptable. https://t.co/tKnlDoN8qj

In Congress @BettySutton supported and Congress passed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, a major overhaul of SBA loan programs to make it easier for small businesses to get loans and access capital, which saved or created 1.3 million jobs annually.
As Ohio Treasurer, I led the GrowNow program of low-interest loans for small businesses, which helped them expand their operations or develop new product lines, all of which produced many thousands of sustainable, high-quality jobs based in our communities.
Great discussion today in Cleveland with the Manufacturing Advocacy and Growth Network (MAGNET) about creating and expanding smart manufacturing jobs. @BettySutton and I have a record of creating jobs and getting results and look forward to working with leaders like MAGNET. https://t.co/ah0SsDU28J

Say anything you like about LeBron James and his tremendous performance - all of it is justified and then some. But for our guys to hold that team down to 79 points on their home floor (74 until garbage time) is a sensational team effort. DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS!
As Governor, I will make it a point to show my strong support for our American Legion posts, our VFW posts, and all our veteran and fraternal organizations who do so much to raise the quality of life for others in our communities.
As Governor, I will work with anyone and everyone in the Federal government to find ways to deliver the improved health care that our Ohio veterans need and deserve.
I always enjoy parades, and I enjoy my hometown parades most of all. Here we are in action to remember and salute this Memorial Day. https://t.co/MmDGptwz84
At the Consumer Bureau, we made things right for servicemembers and veterans on their mortgages, student loans, auto loans. We took on for-profit colleges that cheated veterans out of their hard-earned GI Bill money. For all those who had stood up for us, we stood up for them.
When I was State Treasurer, I led the effort for a statewide ballot issue for a special bonus earned by veterans of the Persian Gulf, Iraq, or Afghanistan. Legislators blocked it for awhile, but 72% of the voters finally approved it in 2009. The voters got it right.
Today we commemorate the lives that were given in service to this great country. People who are willing to take personal risks for the things that matter most are heroes. Hail to America’s Heroes!
.@MickMulvaneyOMB worked diligently in Congress to destroy the Consumer Bureau and now he’s doing his best to undermine it from within. Treating people fairly and stopping them from being cheated and mistreated doesn’t matter to him. But it does to everyone else.
Frankly, to clean up the corruption in state government we need to do something fairly simple. We need to elect brand-new people to come in with a big broom to sweep the place clean. https://t.co/orNqBQVYlB
Republican legislators are trading favors for campaign contributions. They feel so comfortable in power that they think voters don’t matter. That's been true of one-party rule at the Statehouse for years now. We need change. We need checks and balances.
LeBron James is playing the best basketball of his life - or of anyone’s life. And we get to see it night in and night out. Now batten down the hatches for one more heroic effort in Game 7.

The desire by Congress and the Administration to repeal the CFPB’s auto guidance has been misguided all along. It merely restated existing law, so repeal does not change anything. Discrimination in lending remains flatly illegal. https://t.co/zF9hYlMTBy
ECOT auction continues. They still refuse to auction off framed pictures of the politicians who embraced this failed defrauder of taxpayers and children. Many are happy to bid them up and buy them! Put them up for sale!
Shame on those who would withhold funds for things like clean water and diapers because someone doesn’t meet a work criteria that often doesn’t even make sense in rural areas. Assuming all those without jobs are lazy or jobless by choice is out of touch with reality.
Keeping any portion of $570 million in unspent cash assistance to help our poorest residents pay for essentials is an unconscionable failure of our government. @BettySutton and I will do better by Ohioans. https://t.co/wGSrpwspB9

For all his lengthy career, @MikeDeWine has never lifted a finger to rein in payday lenders. I have fought them at every turn, both here and in Washington. Ohio has the worst payday loan laws in the nation because of pay-to-play on Capitol Square. #OhioDeservesBetter!
Yesterday I met with addiction and mental health specialists in Mansfield to learn about effective local tactics to combat the opioid epidemic. To beat this scourge, we must listen to, learn from, and work with one another. They say the Medicaid expansion is essential! https://t.co/z8ubhrRtAk

Cavs! They always talk about their offense and their shots, but defensive effort=winning. Korver diving on the floor, LeBron and Love and Nance shot blocking, all pushing out to the 3-point line, Thompson hustling and hustling, then hustling again. Grit wins championships!
Ohioans are tired of the terrible toll the opioid crisis is taking. I met with people from Canton, Mansfield, and Findlay today to discuss what we can and will do about it.
Pumped up to be endorsed by @OhioEA. @BettySutton and I will stand with them to strengthen our schools and protect worker rights. We will make needed reforms and respect the important work they do for our communities.

Cavs broke out the other night. Played strong defense and, because of that, you could see the confidence grow at the offensive end. Now keep it rolling tonight!
I'll be making several stops in Northern Ohio today to talk about taking on the opioid crisis - something @MikeDeWine has failed to do. This crisis is killing Ohioans every day and it's time we step up and tackle it.
Pastor yesterday counseled living our lives with decency and order. Then showed us a little girl rolling in the dirt at a public event, celebrating “her own little groundbreaking ceremony.” It was hilarious and adorable.
Under @MikeDeWine, deaths from the opioid crisis have tripled. Next he wants to dismantle the Medicaid expansion and take health care away from 700,000 Ohioans. That's not leadership. It will make this terrible crisis even worse and lead to more deaths and greater misery.
Yesterday I was joined by strong Sheriffs to discuss how we can better tackle the opioid crisis. We will coordinate with local, state, and federal leaders to find practical solutions that prioritize treatment, increase resources, support local law enforcement, and save lives.
Terrible gun violence again yesterday in Texas. Grief and sorrow for all concerned. We need action, and we need it urgently. How can anyone think it’s ok to stand immobile in the face of what we’re seeing?
.@BettySutton and I are proud to be endorsed by Ohio IBEW, Ohio Laborers, and Ohio Plumbers and Pipefitters. We stand shoulder to shoulder with organized labor to protect workers from Republican attacks in Washington and the Statehouse, including so-called right to work.
Then-Speaker @JonHusted changed the law to curtail accountability for failing charter schools. Big donors complained and he responded. Betsy DeVos is similarly dismantling accountability of for-profit colleges. Opens the door to fraud and abuse of taxpayers.
“Through outright scheming, benign neglect, or unconscionable silence, Republicans running state government only pretended to demand adequate accountability from ECOT.” Very well put. Criminal investigations now are underway.	https://t.co/RMY7vLmY6T
Corruption in state government has run rampant on the watch of @MikeDeWine and @JonHusted. While tax dollars are tied up in Columbus and not coming back to our communities, Republicans are too gridlocked to do the people’s work. We can't afford more of the same. #OHgov
The current shutdown of the State House has delayed legislation addressing payday lending, where Ohio's laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594% interest on loans that end up ruining people’s lives. Unconscionable!

More contempt of consumers, as squatter leadership at CFPB now wants to shroud in secrecy the public complaint portal we developed that has been so effective. It calls out how consumers say that financial companies have mistreated them. Don’t we have the right to know that?
A big deadline passed yesterday. Congress did not have the stomach, or the votes, in the public light of day to overturn the payday loan rule we adopted as one of my final acts at CFPB. Now the question is, will squatter leadership try to kill it in the shadows somehow?
I’ve spent my time in public service fighting for people, standing up for them to see they’re treated fairly. But here we have politicians helping themselves, either directly or through campaign contributions that distort the purposes of our government. TIME FOR A CHANGE.
The FBI sure has its hands full. Former Speaker Rosenberger took lots of money from people who were buying influence to enable abusive payday loans. It perverted our government. DeWine and Husted did and said nothing about it.	https://t.co/oMLmTuppzx

This is outrageous. Many items from the ECOT HQ are so extravagant-why would anyone think it appropriate to spend tax dollars this way? This is clearly the result of greed and self-dealing. Meanwhile, many other Ohio students struggle in subpar facilities. https://t.co/0HUEnEl9US
So @chrislhayes was interested in how new interim leadership has set back the CFPB. Walking back the mission, letting ideology and toadyism to powerful financial interests block protection for consumers - all of us. Shameful.
Just yesterday, the U.S. Dept of Education stopped investigating for-profit colleges, no matter how they abuse taxpayers and students, including veterans fleeced of their GI bill benefits. We shut down two bad sets of schools and got back $750 million for those who were wronged!
Incredible story about making change. Gessel, Gessel, Froiken, and Precker - avatars of public hygiene, getting us all free toilets. Dayton grit. Young people standing up and speaking out to change America for the better. Grateful! 	https://t.co/V0gg7kRql2

After joining @MikeDewine, @JonHusted handed over his $4.6 million. Now he says he has no campaign account and so can’t disgorge his ECOT contributions. But the joint ticket has the money. So of course they can and should GIVE THE $ BACK. 	https://t.co/Wc31DRpQ9H
I'll be live on All In with Chris Hayes starting at 8:00 pm tonight. https://t.co/BXBDwJoixd
As a result, state officials never held anybody accountable and let ECOT get away with a billion-dollar ripoff of Ohio taxpayers and failed promises to educate our children. We now have the last line of accountability available to us - VOTE THEM OUT this fall. Let’s do it!
This is absolutely egregious. For-profit school greed is one of the many reasons i’m running for Governor. I will be an advocate for students always, and will fight back against the Trump Administration when it turns its back on them.
At the CFPB, we got $750 million returned to students who were cheated by for-profit schools. Now @BetsyDeVosED wants to let students who are being cheated be hung out to dry. That is exactly the opposite of what public service is supposed to be about. 	https://t.co/F4KWcBfSVF
All of those legislative maneuvers and all that self-serving protection of ECOT officials came about as ECOT rained political contributions on Republican politicians - about $3 million in all. Connect the dots. It’s much easier than any child’s puzzle.
ECOT is increasingly toxic, with multiple criminal referrals now being made for abuse of taxpayer money and defrauding of Ohioans. Nobody minded the store, and when the former watchdog raised concerns, then-Speaker Husted changed the law to neuter it. Indefensible!
Ohio is a great place to live, make a home, raise a family, go to school, work, and grow a business. It should also be a great place to age with dignity and retire securely, surrounded by family and friends, with strong support from community programs and resources.
AARP estimates 2 million Ohioans work in jobs with no retirement plan. @BettySutton and I have plans to help. We will explore new approaches to provide more retirement planning and options, to make it easier to secure their futures.	https://t.co/zAtiqyVVIW
Today for Mother’s Day, we were in the most beautiful part of the Bible, the Sermon on the Mount. The point was made that one thing mothers do is forgive us - a lot. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Mothers set a great example for all of us.
Happy Mother's Day! I lost my own Mom 37⅔ years ago and still miss her all the time. But I have my wife Peggy to celebrate today, who is an all-star in every role she plays, including her role as mother. Grateful to her and to Moms everywhere.

Another century later, the General Assembly adopted a formal salute to the Ohio flag, which goes like this: “I salute the flag of the state of Ohio and pledge to the Buckeye State respect and loyalty.”
Apparently we did not have a state flag for the first century after joining the union. Then Cleveland architect John Eisenmann went to work and brought along his great imagination. And voila! A starred flag for the ages was born!
Around the globe, only three national flags are not rectangular. Switzerland and the Vatican City have square flags. At least they’re trying. Nepal has a commendable double pennant for the Himalayas. What the heck, I like it - but it’s not nearly as pretty as ours!
Can anyone honestly argue that Ohio does not have the most beautiful flag of any state? It is classy and elegant. It has stars and stripes, but with pizzazz. It represents our roads and waterways, hills and valleys. It has our “O” with overtones of a buckeye also.

Ohio has never feared to step out and be innovative. 49 States have a flag shaped in a 2x3 rectangle. Yawn. (And people say I’m boring!) Ohio, alone in the world, has a flag sometimes called a swallowtail or a birdsmouth, but properly known as a burgee. https://t.co/ocCZ89KeL2
What a great crowd at the @OhioEA Spring Assembly! @BettySutton and I are proud graduates of our public schools. We will stand alongside teachers in Ohio and work to stop the misguided war on workers and public education we’ve seen from Republicans. https://t.co/VYAcljEjj7
In 2010, Ohio public schools were #5 in the nation in Education Week's annual Quality Counts ranking. In 2015, we fell to #18. Here and across the nation, parents of young children say the main obstacle to preschool is cost. We will work to address that need.
.@BettySutton has long been a champion for early education. Our administration will create a statewide Pre-K "Hub" and guarantee adequate funding for universal pre-K through combined public/private efforts.

CAVS!! Not to go all hoop wonk, but incredible game last night. Raptors, at home, shot 54%, made 12 threes, 10 for 11 from the line. And the Cavs blew them out! LeBron made incredible shot after incredible shot, Love was clicking, they poured it on in the 2d half. Wow!

Go Cavs! Big Shot LeBron - Wow! “I felt like a kid all over again” he said after the game. So did we fans! ;-)
So there he is, Exhibit A, Swamp Creature @MickMulvaneyOMB. Confirming the old adage that in DC, they view an honest politician as one who, when he IS bought, STAYS bought. And he stays bought not only throughout his time in Congress, but when he goes to work elsewhere.
We thought at least we had to try to connect the dots to link campaign money to public policy. But Mulvaney is so brazen he does it for us. Consumer advocates, don’t come see him unless you pony up. All our worst fears confirmed about how DC now works. Disgusting!
Second, Mulvaney openly tells us that when he was in Congress, he made it a practice never to meet with any lobbyist unless they had first made a contribution to his campaign fund. He was bought and paid for, and he openly TELLS us he was bought and paid for. Wow!
First, after repeatedly attacking me at the @CFPB for being “too political,” @MickMulvaneyOMB blatantly scolds the banks to give more campaign contributions to back anti-CFPB legislation. As a federal regulator, he calls on them to do that. Let that sink in for a minute.
Here is the story of Mulvaney’s recent outing before American Bankers group. He says two remarkable things as he preens for this gathering where he felt very cozy. They show he is corrupt and not a neutral or honest advocate for anyone. https://t.co/XcoeAGeKh5
Mulvaney and his squatter leadership at CFPB are a direct threat to clean and honest government. Why doesn’t the Trump administration see the value of protecting consumers? Now we know for sure out of his own mouth - because they are in the pockets of the financial industry.
.@MaryTaylorOH has a new ad about ending the Medicaid expansion. @MikeDeWine won't protect it either. An urgent reminder of the stakes this November. Protecting Medicaid expansion is literally life or death for many thousands of Ohioans.	https://t.co/zCQsHxCXzq
As Attorney General, I won the Supreme Court case that said Ohio can hold charter school officials individually responsible for cheating taxpayers and failing students. As Governor, I will fight scams and frauds like ECOT and hold them accountable for their abuses. #OHGov

Keep it up, CFPB knights in armor! You are making a real difference under very trying circumstances. You are a shining example of government that can work, and it’s exactly why I’m running for Governor - we need government to work for the people. #OHGov
The $1 billion to be paid out by Wells Fargo as a result of wrongdoing we uncovered shows the CFPB’s dedicated public servants can still do excellent work when they are allowed to do so. They are the real heroes here, fighting for the right against all odds.
Despite the nasty snarkiness from squatter CFPB leadership, I am glad to see the work we got underway when I was running the Bureau is still paying dividends even as the Trump Administration generally is actively undermining consumer protections.
As I’ve said before, it’s still wrong that 2 million Ohioans were purged from voter rolls in the last 7 years. Voter suppression is un-American and has no place in our democracy. We should make it easier to vote, not harder. #OHGov https://t.co/NxYW1PNv90

Off to Cincinnati to see my great friend, @elizabethforma! She has learned a great deal about the opioid crisis from working on it in Massachusetts. I look forward to seeing what we can incorporate from their approach here in Ohio.
President Trump tweeted a while ago that the CFPB on his watch would slow regulation but vigorously enforce the law. It always sounds good to say that. It’s a very different thing to actually do it. They aren’t doing it. Does he even care that Mulvaney is making a fool of him?
Squatter @MickMulvaneyOMB testified before the Senate Banking Committee today. What does he have to show for himself? Zero, zip, nada. That’s how many enforcement actions they have taken on his watch. Watchdog? No. Lapdog? Yes. Snoozing, lazy lapdog? You bet.
As Ohio Treasurer, we worked with all parts of state government to end the Coingate scandal. Then as Ohio Attorney General after the special election, we finished cleaning up problems in that office. Now, as Governor, I will be the new broom to sweep the Statehouse clean. #OHGov
In 2006, the Coingate scandal rocked the Statehouse and helped elect Democrats to state office to clean up the corruption. This year’s scandals - the ECOT scandal and now the pay-to-play-payday-lending scandal that has just broken wide open - will change the races this year.
This is a troubling situation with @MikeDeWine. He was worried about his political situation and hastily inserted himself in the middle of an FBI investigation. Now they will have to investigate his discussions with the disgraced Speaker. He must pledge to cooperate with FBI!
At the Ohio Statehouse right now, the fish rots from the head. And the stench is rising, day by day, from the one-party, look-the-other-way Republican rule. Don’t think for a minute this is the last of it. #OhioDeservesBetter

So squatter @MickMulvaneyOMB is the flim-flam man who never belonged at the CFPB in the first place. No enforcement actions. “Humility” to let financial cheaters go back to doing whatever they want to people. No law and order in the marketplace. Nice job, Mick!
Now suddenly, as Mulvaney scrambles to testify in Congress about his goose egg on consumer protection, he makes empty talk about maybe having one big settlement. Like a two-bit street magician - Look, over here! - with a shiny object to distract everyone from his poor record.
The failure of Mulvaney’s philosophy (groomed by years of cozying up to special interests) is his startling laziness about enforcing the law. Not a single enforcement action since November. Well, gee, in his lax regime I guess nobody is violating any laws! Isn’t that wonderful?
.@MickMulvaneyOMB constantly misrepresents the differences between him and me. The difference is about ethical business conduct - cheaters who violate the law &amp; take advantage of people versus those who lift up customers and deliver value back to people.
Squatter @MickMulvaneyOMB says some at CFPB think “lending money for profit is evil.” This shows he hasn’t bothered to get to know people there. I always said, we want people to lend money for profit, and to thrive, by helping their customers succeed.

A recent report shows that the Franklin County and Columbus land banks have generated $180 million in economic activity over the last 5 years by redeveloping vacant or blighted areas. That’s great stuff! We started the county land bank when I was the County Treasurer.
Why do we pledge allegiance to the flag? Because we love our country. Voting, and making it easier for people to vote, is also about loving our country. Standing in people’s way to stop them from voting is looking backward to the 19th century. It is un-American.
The simple principle is we should REMOVE roadblocks to people voting if they get motivated to do so, not find more roadblocks to set in their way. This is a democracy, if we can keep it. Russians want to undermine it. Americans should put our arms firmly around it. #OHGOV
Lots of people canvassing with the @FCDems today ahead of early vote starting on Tuesday. Reminds me to be aggravated about voter suppression in Ohio. Why do we need to aggressively purge the rolls? Why isn’t regular driver’s license renewal sufficient for everyone?
Republicans loved to irresponsibly bash “Obamacare” to score political points. And @MikeDeWine did that more than anyone. Now that the rubber meets the road and we have to face down many people losing access to health care, they are in a fix with no good way out. #OHGov
What @MikeDeWine DID say, though, is that Medicaid expansion “will not exist” if he is governor. So though he is unwilling to take any responsibility or lead on the issue, neither does he have the guts to buck the legislature and defend it. #OHGov
Interesting @clevelanddotcom editorial board yesterday. Three times, @MaryTaylorOH asks @MikeDeWine point blank, “Will you end the Medicaid expansion?” Three times he tries to wriggle away, unwilling to answer out of fear of his party’s right wing. #OhioDeservesBetter
The newest @ohiogop proposal to ban all abortions with no exceptions - not even allowing a woman to save her own life when imminently threatened - is extreme and dangerous. It would open women and doctors to criminal prosecution. It is wrong for Ohio.

When I was Attorney General, we introduced robotics into the crime labs and got the backlogs down to 71 days on a declining trajectory. Under @MikeDeWine, they ballooned back up to 136 days and now are running at around 90 days. So we can all judge that for ourselves.
.@MikeDeWine was a demagogue on the crime lab numbers when he ran against me 8 years ago. Now the @daytondailynews reports what sheriffs tell me around the state: we have major backlogs in drug cases that lead to suspects being released and cases being impaired. #OHGov
From his days on the House Financial Services Committee, @MickMulvaneyOMB was groomed to take financial contributions from lobbyists and then let financial predators off the hook. Now he is temporarily chief-in-charge of letting them off the hook. And he is REALLY GOOD at it!
Squatter CFPB leader Mulvaney tells Congress he is acting with “humility and prudence.” In fact, he has not issued a single enforcement action since I left, which means he is green-lighting any conceivable financial malfeasance. Protecting consumers is just not in his nature.

After 20 abortion restrictions in the past 7 years, now we have the most extreme bill of them all. A total ban, no exceptions for rape or incest or the life of the mother. Letting prosecutors decide to bring criminal charges against a woman or her doctor. This is utter madness.
President Trump in Ohio today to talk about his plan for doing infrastructure on the cheap. We need a better and more robust plan. Building Ohio with good jobs.
It will take a broad commitment to tolerant, inclusive, diverse communities to arrest our relative population decline. We must embrace everyone’s talents, with nobody left out and nobody left behind. That will bring business here and persuade our young people to stay here.
Recent stats show America is growing twice as fast as Ohio. Within the state, population continues to shift away from eastern and southeastern Ohio. We have to find ways to spread out economic opportunity to lift up all of our communities. It’s not happening right now.
Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley is taking a big role in our campaign and we are grateful to her for all her energy and activism. Together we want to see a better, more progressive Ohio. One where businesses want to locate and our young people want to stay and make a life.
The #MeToo movement is a potent force as @BettySutton and I hear &amp; see it around Ohio. Women want to be able to give their best every day w/ out having to deal with oppressive obstacles posed by sexual harassment and stereotyping. We need to stand with them and make this right.
Hand-to-hand combat continues in the Republican primary, apparently stooping to new lows as family are being brought into the fray. Some things don’t change, though, such as Mike DeWine refusing to answer where he stands on Medicaid expansion. That’s not leadership. #OHGOV
Mike DeWine blames everyone but himself on opioids. He has failed us, as he concedes the numbers show. This blew up on his watch, leaving Ohio among the worst in the nation. He is making excuses rather than making a difference, at a time when Ohio really needed him. #OHGov

No matter how desperately Mike DeWine now tries to fudge the numbers, the fact is the opioid crisis blew up on his watch and he did nothing for 7 years to address it. Now it’s too little, too late as 14 Ohioans die every day from this scourge. #OhioDeservesBetter
Putting people together to listen and learn from one another is always the best and right way to solve our problems - what I call the Ohio way. We can’t solve the opioid crisis, though, unless we support local government services and protect the Medicaid expansion.
On the opioid crisis, we see great opportunities to partner with local officials around the state to get something done. Sheriffs and police have thoughtful perspectives on the problems in their communities. Mental health and addiction specialists bring real expertise we need.

Also up to see Lucas County Sheriff John Tharp today on the opioid crisis. Although we have released our framework for addressing these issues, we will continue to listen to local officials around the state and find ways to refine and improve our approach.
On the opioid issue, and on various other issues as well, you can now view a growing amount of policy content on our website at https://t.co/iZI6FcsZLI. This is in response to fair comments from many far and wide that they wanted to see more detail. Listening!
Rolling out our framework today to address the opioid crisis in Ohio, with Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin, Mayor Andy Ginther, and City Attorney Zach Klein. The state leadership has been a stunning failure on this key issue that undermines our families and communities.
The new executive order bans transgender citizens from the military. Like stalling the bill to end discrimination in housing and employment against LGBTQ Ohioans, it sends the wrong message. We must embrace all our talent, not shut people out based on bare prejudice.
President Trump is now acting again to try to ban transgender Americans from serving and protecting our country. Over the objections of many military leaders. Snubbing the talents and patriotism of our fellow citizens who deserve better than this shabby act of prejudice.
Representatives Fedor and Galonsky are right to seek to amend Ohio’s Human Trafficking Law to increase penalties imposed on traffickers of 16- and 17-year-olds. Regardless of the age of consent, they are still minors and entitled to substantial protections under the law.
Came upon notable words in a hymn we were singing recently: “Win this nation back/ Change the atmosphere.” Indeed!
The legislature has held 20 hearings on a bill to fix the unemployment compensation fund, with no real progress. Remember we had to borrow $3.4 billion from the Federal Government when we ran out of money, costing Ohio businesses $1.4 billion in extra taxes to pay it off.
Payday lending proposal is being watered down with amendments that do not resolve the glaring loophole under the Credit Services Organizations Act. We need strong reforms, not weak efforts pretending to be something more than they are. Or the issue should go to the ballot again.

Many people, old and young, are getting their marching shoes ready for tomorrow all over the country. They bring strong conviction as they exercise their First Amendment rights to talk about the Second Amendment. This is America, and everyone has a voice that we should hear.
Betty and I and our team are good listeners and learners. We appreciate our partners and welcome constructive criticism. New policy content is up on our website in response to comments, especially from young people, who rightfully asked, where’s the beef? More to come.
We must protect our health care, but also work to improve it here at the state level. That means fixing the exchanges and driving down costs while expanding choices. We must protect the Medicaid expansion. Nobody should have their health care taken away from them #ProtectOurCare
Today is the 8th anniversary of the #ACA. My running mate Betty Sutton fought for it and helped pass it. Because of that law, 900,000 more Ohioans have health insurance today, and people are protected from discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.
Spoke with Erika Jones recently about important work they are doing to address infant mortality in Columbus through the Celebrate One initiative. She described great work being done in certain parts of Ohio. We need a statewide strategy to support and build on that key work.
As for me, I cracked down on polluters as Attorney General but supported our farmers as Treasurer with the Ag-Link program. We can bring all parties together, with our local officials, to find smart solutions that use new technology and are sustainable. What I call the Ohio way.
Betty and I are strongly positioned to handle the Lake Erie issue well. She ran the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and has real expertise about the Great Lakes and how environmental needs dovetail with economic development opportunities.
The Governor just declared the open waters of western Lake Erie to be impaired. This is a long overdue recognition of reality under the Clean Water Act. It now will fall to the next Governor to work with all parties, including our farmers, to ensure a sustainable cleanup.
So here we go. I now see Mike DeWine is calling Mary Taylor a “criminal” and bellowing to “lock her up.” My questions are, is there no decency in politics anymore? And even if there is no decency, is there no originality? This is both lame and unedifying.
The health insurance exchanges have never worked very well here in Ohio. If they don’t, we lack the competition we need to provide people with more choice and to get more cost control. Other states are doing better. We need real focus on this challenge and have never had it.
Honored to spend time working in the George Washington Williams room at the Statehouse. He was the first African-American elected to the legislature, groundbreaking author of African-American history, Civil War soldier, minister, and diplomat. An admired role model.
.@BettySutton and I are proud to have earned the endorsement of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and the locals all over Ohio. The UFCW bargains hard and effectively for its members, protects the retirees, and stands up for worker rights. We stand with them!

@UFCW @UFCW75 @RWDSU @BettySutton Thank you!
We now see Mary Taylor and Mike DeWine slugging it out in the Republican primary. They should be having an open primary with debates, as we are, rather than trying to rig the process at ORP. Go out and seek support, but respect the voters and give them a clear choice.
Medicaid expansion is about far more than the opioid crisis, of course. It means hundreds of thousands of Ohioans have access to preventive care, diagnosis, and treatment. That is cost-effective in the long run and good for Ohio. We need to fight to keep our health care.
RT @BettySutton: Great discussion last night with an inspiring group of bright and talented young black professionals hosted by Columbus Co…
Mike DeWine had 7 years to address the opioid crisis, which blew up on his watch. He feels his vulnerability, yet won’t back Medicaid expansion. Mary Taylor opposes it; I favor it. Not a single reporter can get him to take a clear position. No wonder he’s ducking debates.
Treatment options are key to solving the opioid crisis. The Medicaid expansion is needed for Ohio to have the resources for treatment options. Yet Mike DeWine, now belatedly putting out frantic plans on opioids, does not back the Medicaid expansion. Where’s the beef?
Betty and I are grateful to be endorsed today by over 50 public officials from Franklin County. This is where I served at the local level. And I continued to serve alongside these officials at the state and Federal level as well. Now working to do so once again.
It is not enough, it seems, for Betsy DeVos to stop protecting students and parents against harm from student loan servicing. Now she wants to block states from taking action as well. We will push for more oversight in Ohio and join other states to fight to protect our people.
This obsession with every conceivable abortion restriction has meant lawmakers have no bandwidth left to address women’s and children’s health issues. Pre-natal and post-natal care are lagging, and high infant mortality is not being improved. This extreme agenda is hurting Ohio.
State legislators have passed 20 abortion restrictions in the past 7 years. The latest has just been struck down by the courts, wasting taxpayer money as we pay attorney fees on both sides. Now 20 of them want to ban abortion outright, also clearly unconstitutional.
So today is the first day of Spring, though it doesn’t feel like it. Yesterday did feel like it though, and it felt really good. Soon things will be beautiful all over Ohio, and I’m looking forward to those drives around the state. As my Mom used to say, “Spring has sprung!”
Moreover, Ohio job growth continues to lag the national average, as it has for 61 straight months. In fact, our job growth is only 2.4% over the past 12 years, while the national rate exceeded 10%. Trickle-down tax cuts worsen inequality and just don’t get the job done. #OHGOV
We continue to see controversy and uncertainty over Ohio job creation numbers in the past year. Yet it is undeniable that job creation has been slowing here, year to year, for several years now, at a time when the 8-year national economic recovery has been going strong. #OHGOV
My personal instincts as a leader had always been toward stoicism, trying to bear the load without showing the strain. But I came to see that people respond and relate to our human side more than they do to any pretense to be superhuman. The authentic reality is more potent.
I learned that too at the CFPB. You can hold an hour-long meeting, struggling over a difficult topic, and the key takeaway can be a brief personal engagement on the way out the door - the moment of humanity that strengthens and sustains the effort being made.
I had a chance recently to talk about leadership with Nancy Kramer. She emphasized the power that can be created by showing vulnerability. John Pepper, too, in his book on leadership, stressed the power of the moment to leave a lasting impression that inspires people.
In the end, I can only be in so many rooms with so many people. We also engage through print and broadcast media, but space and other constraints create distortions. Here, I can engage in frank and direct communication. So I like it. And you all can come and go as you please.
So I will keep trying to present a variety of thoughts on this feed. Certain people (not just the trolls) may find some of them frivolous. That’s ok. My serious comments on important policy issues may spark disagreement and even strong feelings. That’s ok too.
I also think it apparent that I have a deep love for Ohio. This is where my parents raised us boys, where my wife and I have raised our twins. I am delighted by many things about life here, our history, the stories of Ohioans. I have been many other places - this is always Home.
More on this whole twitter enterprise: I find it hard to cram real thoughts into 280 characters. I write my tweets myself, so they are MY thoughts - like them or not. I talk about what interests me in the moment, and many things do - some deadly serious, others whimsically odd.
Others want some content that shows who I really AM, not just what I stand for, and they find single-minded policy discussion monotonous and boring. In truth, this IS who I am: earnest, rather corny, a bit playful, with wide-ranging interests and my own sense of humor.
I have now been writing this Twitter feed for more than three months since I got into the governor’s race. People seem to have strong feelings about it. Some hate anything that is light-hearted and frankly seem to lack a sense of humor. They only want sober serious content.

Two years ago, I submitted my DNA sample to https://t.co/nMCGFbSWjC. One of the things I found is that I have a solid amount of Irish in my bloodline, apparently originating with my great-grandmother, who grew up in the 19th century. It was a fascinating exercise.

Society of St. Vincent de Paul Diocese of Columbus is offering low-cost loans to replace payday loans. Their efforts are needed because Ohio does such a poor job of controlling payday lending. Interest rates here are highest in the country, over 500%. #OhioDeservesBetter

The Pennsylvania special election is highly encouraging. That district runs for miles along the Ohio border. Ohioans just west of the line have similar needs and perspectives to people just east of the line. This will be a good year if we make our case to them convincingly.
Among Ohio’s many infrastructure needs modernizing the grid. We must secure it from cyber attacks, integrate new technologies, increase its resilience, and empower consumers more fully. Every outage costs on average $1 million or more in lost productivity, some much more.
Deeply appreciative of the Stark County Democratic Party last night for their strong endorsement of the Cordray-Sutton ticket. We will work closely with them to bring home a win this year.
In Cleveland late last night to speak with Cuyahoga Women’s Caucus, Young Black Dems, and Stonewall. All are patriotic Ohioans who want to see better things for our people and our communities. Embracing the talents of all! Pulling together for a better Ohio! https://t.co/rOsSeedGRv

All over the country and our state, young people are standing up and speaking out to seek solutions to gun violence. We need to strengthen and encourage them, not discourage or discipline them. And listen carefully to what they are saying about keeping our schools safe.
I am speaking at an Eagle Scout ceremony tonight in my hometown, as I have done many times. Always impressed at the dedication and discipline of our successful scouts, and the leadership they learn and exemplify. We could use more of them in public life.
Mike DeWine at Lake County Republican Dinner apparently viewed himself as criticizing me for being associated with Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren. They stood next to me and fought for consumers and for a better America. Proud of their strong support and service.
COTA in Columbus has moved over more and more from diesel fuel to natural gas. Now they will be back to the future with battery-powered electric buses in the coming years. Cities are recognizing that new approaches are needed for energy efficiency and cleaner air.
In to see the Toledo Blade yesterday. They have been primarily responsible for some important investigative reporting on Ohio government over the years. This year they are calling out the ECOT scandal. The people of this state benefit by their careful scrutiny and so do I.
Great Lakes Museum in Toledo where Rep. Kaptur endorsed Betty and me is a real treasure. Amazing how special this precious ecosystem is, right on our doorstep. How short-sighted of our leaders to allow the toxic algae bloom to fester unaddressed for the past several years.
A major challenge in Ohio is to spread out economic opportunity so that all regions are able to participate meaningfully in its prosperity. This is a longstanding concern in many medium-sized towns, which deserve more respect and attention from state government.
The state legislature’s ostrich performance on renewable energy, sticking its head in the sand and dragging us backward, hinders us from building on the jobs of the future. Wind and solar are expanding around the country and around the world. Let’s get back in the game!
Job numbers over the past two years for Ohio are truly disappointing. Both years lagged the job growth in Governor Strickland’s final year. The state legislature’s massive tax cuts produced the same ineffective trickle-down economics that doesn’t actually trickle down.

The debate we held the other night shows respect for voters that we are all willing to address their concerns, telling where we stand and taking criticisms and brickbats from one another. The Republican candidates, not so much. They regard the voters as pesky nuisances.
Ohio University students are asking for more policy content from our campaign. We have put out views on many issues to date, but will provide more details soon. Over the years, people often said I provided more content than they wanted to read. So this is different!
In Steubenville and Martin’s Ferry and Marietta along the river, people tell me they often feel left out by policies formulated in Columbus. They want their voice to be understood and respected by their public officials. I hear them loud and clear and will listen closely.

Squatter leader Mulvaney at CFPB says other agencies should now do the work we used to do when I was the Director. May be that is just as well - I would rather have state officials do this work aggressively than have Mulvaney and his ilk do it only timidly.
At the CFPB, we found ways to protect and support working people who often could not get a fair shake from the largest and most powerful financial institutions. We gave them a voice for their complaints and put money back in their pockets - especially our veterans.
We are traveling the river today, from Youngstown down to Marietta. This part of the state has known what it means to face economic challenges over this generation. We need to spread out economic opportunity and support the hard-working people of these areas.
Great to see strong supporters in Lima yesterday, including Mayor David Berger, who is now serving his eighth term because under his leadership, Lima Works. The rest of Ohio should take heed how he brings people together in a spirit of partnership.

To make this happen - to fully realize the promise of the #MeToo movement - we must have men push other men to change. No more tolerating bad conduct, no more chuckling about how “boys will be boys.” Respect and equal dignity. Treating all women like we treat our mothers.
And then, in removing these obstacles, we must understand how sexual harassment holds back and discourages women in the workplace. Nobody should have to put up with that - not my daughter, not your sister or your mother. Nobody at all. Full equality in letter and spirit.
As the #MeToo movement is teaching us all, it is not enough just to embrace the talents of everyone, women as well as men, in all our diverse backgrounds and experiences. We have to remove obstacles to people’s progress too, starting with prejudicial gender stereotypes.
Today is International Women’s Day. Many McDonald’s are flipping their iconic arches from M to W, which is an interesting form of recognition. Betty and I back the #MeToo movement wholeheartedly. We will lead an Ohio that embraces the talents of everyone. https://t.co/DKHKQSLN1S

Tremendously enjoyed the Democratic gubernatorial debate last night in Toledo. Don’t fail to notice that only one party is openly debating the issues. Mike DeWine seems afraid to debate Mary Taylor. He prefers to burrow his way quietly to the nomination.

We are now losing 14 people a day to the opioid crisis, far worse than most states. Drug overdose fatalities rose 39% from mid-2016 to mid-2017, nearly triple the national average. As the state legislature undercuts local services, we had the 3rd largest increase in deaths.
Most recent budget had almost flat funding for schools and no increase in basic state aid for colleges and universities. We have slipped from 5th to 22nd in K-12 education, as reported by Education Week. And a sorry 45th in the nation in college affordability.
For average weekly wage, Ohio is in the middle of the pack, 12% below the national average. For median household income, we are 38th of the 50 states, nearly 9% below the national average. Kitchen table issues like these are our focus and Ohio’s proper focus.
Many disturbing statistics in the @DispatchAlerts about Ohio’s current situation and where we rate in the country economically. Middle of the pack in job growth since 2011, and suffering one of the worst unemployment rates in the nation. #OhioDeservesBetter
Columbus Women’s Commission is doing impressive work with private sector employers to improve pay equity between women and men. Also interesting ideas about how to reduce evictions by pushing landlords to seek alternative solutions with their tenants.
Recent word that Equifax breach of consumer information was even worse than we thought, as 2.4 million Americans more were harmed. Now up to 148 million Americans total. This fiasco should be investigated thoroughly! As we started to do. Consumer protectors must step up!
Spent quality time with Rep. Alicia Reece, hearing her thoughts and strategies to expand economic opportunity, make bureaucracy work for the people, and stop voter suppression. Dynamic leader! Ironically, it turns out we both represented Ohio’s 33rd House District.
Citigroup recently refunded $330 million to customers after finding it had overcharged them on their credit card rates. Review was mandated by the CARD Act. Shows the continuing importance of federal laws regulating the financial industry.
New study shows opioid crisis is especially acute in the construction industry, where injuries are 77% higher than in other occupations. Injuries often lead to use of painkillers and then addiction. We need sharper focus on this issue, where our state government has failed us.

CFPB squatter Mulvaney wants to “soften” how consumer complaints undermine transparency in the financial industry. Really?! Consumers using their voices about how they are treated undermines transparency? We are supposed to be the masters of the marketplace, not mute servants.
So what do we now see? New online for-profit charter schools are springing up to take the place of ECOT and others that have failed and defrauded taxpayers and children. When does Ohio say, Enough is Enough? Maybe not until we go to the ballot in November.
Bill passed by the legislature extending protection orders to those in dating relationships is a good idea. Rep. Emilia Sykes, the sponsor, is right to broaden our domestic violence laws. As AG, I worked with victims of domestic violence and saw how hard their lives can be.

Payday lending ballot measure is not a perfect answer, but it will limit excessive fees that are rampant with payday loans now in Ohio, leading to some of the most costly payday loans in the nation. Definitely an improvement over the dismal status quo.
Republican tax bill just passed was the wrong measure at the wrong time. Blowing up the deficit during a time of low unemployment is causing a strong fear of inflation and driving up interest rates, which will curb growth. And not much money left for infrastructure.
Cleveland is a winter wonderland this morning! Many schools closed. Yet my friend Peter Lawson Jones had me out with his group for basketball at Shaker Heights High School at 6am. Men and women, all age brackets. Great hard run. Thanks Peter! https://t.co/yecawuEmE0
Bipartisan redistricting reform had an outside/inside strategy. Threat of a competing ballot issue provided impetus. Heather, Keary, and others did great work from outside, the expert Sen. Dr. Sykes and Leader Strahorn led from inside. Crossed the aisle effectively. Well done!
Redistricting on the May ballot is a rare bipartisan measure to get fair maps for Congressional races. To be clear, I fully support it and urge all to do so. It keeps the governor’s role in the process, which is important. Fair maps! That’s all we ask for, but we insist on it.
One of my last acts at CFPB was to adopt a rule curbing payday lending across the country. It imposes sensible limits on debt traps that payday lenders continue to resist. Under federal law, we could not set interest rate caps. But the people of Ohio can do that, and should.
Betty and I are glad to be endorsed today by Columbus Mayor Andy Ginther. We have known each other for over 20 years. We have seen the progress in Columbus under his leadership and that of former Mayor Michael Coleman. We will work together to bring economic opportunity to Ohio.
Consumer advocates are advancing a ballot measure to make payday lending in Ohio subject to a hard interest rate cap of 28%. Voters tried to do that before, lenders skirted it. We now have shockingly highest rates in the nation, over 500%. I strongly support this effort.
The 2+2 program at Columbus State and many community colleges is also essential as one key approach to bring down the cost of higher education. Many families feel priced out of this important ladder of opportunity and we must fix that problem to reduce inequality.
At Columbus State yesterday, we had an extensive discussion of workforce development and how crucial it is for the state to focus on strategizing how we match our training and education offerings to the kinds of jobs that need to be filled. They are showing the way.
US Department of Education now wants to preempt states from monitoring and overseeing student loan servicers. That is wrong. They want to do nothing while stopping the states from doing something. Instead, Ohio should join the handful of states leading the way and fighting this.
Up to see Mahoning County Democrats last night. Many like homegrown Joe Schiavoni and I respect that. My record is strong on results for the Valley - protecting Lordstown in the GM bankruptcy, keeping jobs and health care at Forum Health, saving many homes from foreclosure.
Spending time at Columbus State Community College this morning. They are becoming a noted leader in the hard area of workforce development. And the 2+2 program is a great relief for many families struggling to afford the cost of higher education.
Our stop yesterday to spend time at Rainbow Years Child Care showed me that it is essential to be able to understand and fill the gaps in available services at the local level. They are doing good work in Dayton, but the state makes it harder than it should be!
New data from the Labor Department shows that most wage growth is occurring at the very top and the bottom of the wage scale. Those in the middle are continuing to stagnate. We have to find ways to spread out economic opportunity in Ohio.
Stopping in Pomeroy this afternoon to view the flood damage and the still very high levels of the Ohio River there. Not quite as bad as last week, but conditions are very tough and the people need more help to cope with it.
Another stop on our Community Solutions tour this morning. We are looking at how Mayor Nan Whaley and Dayton have moved forward on a broad pre-K program. Exciting and bold initiative as we look at how we might scale a similar approach on a statewide basis. https://t.co/TjDYg4Vr4U
Seeing some impressive community building initiatives, like the iBelieve Foundation in Appalachian Ohio that teaches leadership to youth and works to close the college access gap. Developing peer mentorships, driving more awareness of the region. Changing minds and hearts.
I’ve heard from many people about the poor conditions of our roads, including I-71, causing many cars to suffer blown tires. That is both costly and poses a safety issue. We certainly deserve much better than this.
Speakers at the rally yesterday noted how teachers and nurses, steelworkers and tradesmen, bus drivers and highway workers, auto workers and civil servants of all kinds are together in defending our rights against attacks from all branches of government.
Massive Statehouse rally yesterday with labor officials and members from all over Ohio, all ages, all backgrounds, all kinds of occupations. Strenuously opposing Right to Work. Glad to be there with my partner Betty Sutton to stand strong with our sisters and brothers!
When I was confirmed to head the CFPB after two years of Republican opposition, Joe Biden swore me in. Yet Kathleen Sebelius made it a point to come over and hold the Bible, saying she thought the Gilligan family should have a presence there. Quality person. Quality family.

Major rally today for Workers’ Rights at the Ohio Statehouse. We are strongly opposed to the new efforts to impose Right to Work here. It is a southern measure that is wrong for Ohio. Has been for 60 years. Still is today. The Koch brothers want it. Ohioans don’t. https://t.co/h48OmUa6jc
Mike DeWine is on record to put Right to Work back on the ballot. And he supported Senate Bill 5, anti-labor measure that the people overturned in 2011. Ohioans defeated that measure, Issue 2, by 62% of the vote. Ohio has not changed. Nor have the anti-labor elements.
Anti-labor forces in Ohio are trying to bring back so-called Right to Work. Ohio has long rejected it. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce put it on the ballot in 1958 and Ohioans rejected it by 63% of the vote. Yet the anti-labor forces keep trying to revive this approach here.
Moving forward with our Community Solutions Tour by spending time at Owens Community College today. Learning more about how these key institutions are making a difference for people in ways that go far beyond just the classes they are providing. https://t.co/IHKvFhJFKL
Good outing for my partner, Betty Sutton, in Parma last night. Heavy focus on our kitchen table issues. Concerns about health care, education, and economic opportunity are dominating people’s lives, and we both have strong track records to address those concerns.
Going to see the Ohio Federation of Teachers this morning. They are the backbone of our communities, helping raise and mentor our children, carrying out the ideals of public education for all, and providing strong leadership by example to all the rest of us.
Certification yesterday of candidates confirms that we will have a spirited primary on both sides in the governor’s race. It is an opportunity for candidates and voters to have their say, and to do so on the merits. We can show Russia what democracy is all about.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the flood victims in Pomeroy, with more rain in the forecast. Local officials are teaming up to address the problems as best they can. Shows our local government at its most needed, which deserves more support from the state legislature.
I have had a chance to review HB 512. The legislature’s failures on education, flawed testing systems, and the ECOT disaster show the Governor needs to play a strong role in supporting public education, but should do so in tandem with the State Board of Education, not like this.
Great session last night with Youngstown-Warren Black Caucus at New Bethel Baptist Church with Pastor Simon and Jaladah Aslam. Concerns about education, criminal justice reform, entrepreneurship, funding for local government, key social services. Listened and learned a lot!
In Lorain yesterday for a labor rally with running mate Betty Sutton. People are very fired up about the continuing efforts to press forward on Right to Work, which is so wrong for Ohio. Shades of Senate Bill 5!
Sheriffs around Ohio are describing the latest efforts to shift more prison population from state facilities to local jails. None of this addresses the problem, but just moves it around to put it on the backs of local governments to make the state numbers look better.
Leaders in Dayton and Cincinnati are finding ways to accomplish universal pre-K programs. We need to understand what they are doing and see about what can be done for other children and families on a broader statewide basis.
Up to Canton this morning for Prosecutor Ferrero’s Crime Prevention annual breakfast that recognizes community heroes from local law enforcement and among the civilian population. State legislature’s war on local government is undermining public safety.
Parkland and Westerville are tragic reminders of the epidemic of gun violence we face in America. Here's how we can start to solve it:	https://t.co/G1SwZ02NJ1
Weekend report that promising bipartisan efforts around criminal justice reform we worked on with the Inter-Agency Council in the prior Administration have now fallen down completely. A shame and a waste. We will need to pick up the ball and move it forward here in Ohio.
Department of Labor proposed tip rule would take more money from hard-pressed workers who get paid in part by tips. Estimates that the rule would cost tipped workers $5.8 billion a year in tips that could be pocketed by their employers. More inequality!
Trump budget would cut funding for the CFPB by about 25%. This would undermine the agency’s ability to protect consumers and would give more license to those who want to cheat people in the financial marketplace. It is wrong and should be stopped.
Despite promises about forgotten Americans, the Trump economic plan is built on the same tired formula of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, with deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. There is nothing new about this agenda. It is bad for Ohio.
Despite repeated campaign promises, the Trump budget includes over $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Now we see how he wants to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax bill. We must fight to protect seniors and others who are most at risk.
Drove by the ECOT campus on South High St earlier today. A monument to corporate waste at the expense of students, teachers, and taxpayers. Poor monitoring, poor execution. Thousands of students dumped back on the system, money that will never be recovered.
The fallen officer funeral was held today to honor the two Westerville officers who were slain in the line of duty. We honor their service and sacrifice, and must redouble our own efforts to find ways to stem the tide of gun violence in our society.
Our son and daughter are going to be home this weekend. Oh how we find ourselves longing for the days when they were here all the time! Maybe we didn’t always see then, as we do now, how much each mundane moment matters. Parents, listen up!
Incredible scam being peddled by the Trump administration. Proposing $200 billion in public money for infrastructure, but their budget CUTS $240 billion from transportation and infrastructure programs. Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley points all this out. Major campaign promise shredded!
Spent time with Akron teachers yesterday, hearing how hard it has become to run and control their own classrooms. Safety issues are of great concern. Ham-handed testing and monitoring regimes are not working well, as many recognize. We need a bipartisan effort for reform.
Talking a lot with key mayors over the past few weeks and among their many, many responsibilities to their citizens, they are intensively searching for ways to reduce gun violence in their communities. We need to partner closely on that and learn from them.
So Trump’s VA Secretary made his staff fabricate an award he was not actually receiving in Denmark so his wife could travel along there at taxpayer expense, costing all of us thousands of dollars. The law has a simple term for that. It’s called Theft in Office.
The Westerville tragedy here also shows we need to crack down hard on crimes committed with guns. A man now faces federal charges of illegally buying the gun for the suspect despite knowing he was a convicted felon. May get 10 years in prison. These laws need to be enforced.
The Parkland school shootings in Florida are gut-wrenching. Parents who had breakfast with their children that morning. Maybe got a call during the day to hear a joke or a story. Then suddenly 17 are dead. We need to come together to find better solutions to gun violence.
Speaking to the issues around the CFPB here: 	https://t.co/T7aLdEyo9p
Then all the way to the Kalida Knights of Columbus hall in Putnam County for a late outing with northwest Ohio Democrats. We will compete all over the state. All voters deserve to hear our discussion of the key issues so they can consider our priorities and make their choice.
Great Fat Tuesday gathering yesterday with my friend Bernie Quilter and community leaders, labor leaders, and public officials at the UAW hall in Toledo. Many beads were worn! Not quite Bourbon Street, but close! Laughter, food, and fellowship. Thanks Bernie!
Connie Pillich and Scott Schertzer in Columbus this morning to team up with Betty Sutton and me on moving our state forward. Grateful to both of them for their commitment to help with this hard task. Building a great team to secure Ohio’s future!
Learned a lot yesterday from meeting with a dozen suburban Cuyahoga County mayors. Concerns about local government funding and local control of schools. They deserve more respect and support from Columbus. Listening more than telling. Betty and Nan and I are on their wavelength.
New business survey shows corporations are going to spend almost half of their massive tax savings on investors in stock buybacks or dividends. Employees will get only a “very tiny piece,” about 13% of it. Trickle, trickle, trickle. Not very far down.
Betty Sutton and I started our Community Solutions Tour today together with suburban mayors from Cuyahoga County. Hearing an earful about their shabby treatment by the state legislature and how it hampers them from solving problems in local communities. #OhioDeservesBetter
@KFILE We are making it our policy to keep our best talent here in Ohio, most especially our global and immortal talent like LeBron
Another online for-profit charter school will be closing. Insight School got an F in every category on its state report card, including those tracking achievement and progress. Another 1,300 students dumped back on the system, more millions wasted. Are we learning anything?
Detroit woman let down by CFPB dropping payday lending case says: “To be honest I’m really mad, really pissed, because I actually voted for Trump. So knowing that his guy threw out this case that affects people like me, I feel kind of like stupid - just kind of like betrayed.”
Appalling that payday shill Mulvaney dismissed CFPB enforcement case where Golden Valley misled consumers to charge 950% interest. Detroit woman borrowed $900, had to repay $3700, and racked up $1000 in bank overdraft fees while still owing. Then he tried to blame the staff.
The New Cavs offer a bright glimmer of hope! New energy, zip, and laughter. How people fit together and fix their attitudes matters hugely to any team or organization.
Thorough and respectful candidate outing yesterday with CAIR, representing the Islamic American community. Republican candidates for governor invited too, but neither came. How can you pretend to represent Ohio if you just ignore certain communities? And what does that say?
Supposed acting director Mulvaney of CFPB on Face the Nation yesterday talking about doing the job with “humility” and not being aggressive. Financial cheaters, scammers, and fraudsters are not humble. To take them on, you must be aggressive to be effective, as he admits I was.
Important right now to show our support for fallen officers and Westerville police. As we can see again from this tragic incident, domestic violence creates danger for everyone it touches.	https://t.co/IIqoHJ5ycD
If Rob Porter had criminally assaulted a woman on the street, they would have cared. How is this any better? I worked with domestic violence victims as AG; they deserve stronger support than this. Men have to call out other men to bring the kind of change we need. #MeToo
Accounts on Rob Porter’s history of domestic violence don’t add up. FBI exposed his problems, blocked his security clearance. Top levels of the White House blew them off. They did not care. Now, as usual, they claim it is everybody else’s fault and not their own. #MeToo
You know how little kids run everywhere they go? They have an idea to be somewhere, and they want to be there NOW. ASAP! Last weekend, I found myself running up the last few steps to meet with Southern Ohio County Chairs. Then again yesterday at New Salem to see Pastor Troy.
Today would be my Dad’s 100th birthday. He passed away July 4, 2016. An unusually fine human being, he worked 43 years with the developmentally disabled. He always gave others the benefit of the doubt. Although legally blind, he was not limited. A very dry wit. And a Great Dad!
Marvelous break from the campaign trail last night to see Leslie Odom Jr. (of Hamilton fame, where he played Aaron Burr - Sir!) perform at the beautiful theater in the former Great Southern Hotel. Sold out, fresh off his Super Bowl performance. Special to be there.
Great forum yesterday on Black Votes Matter at Cleveland Avenue library branch, where I attended the original dedication some years ago. Strong audience and steady stream of questions about how do we make Ohio government work for ALL the people, especially in our urban centers?
Today's tragic event in Westerville is an important reminder that our law enforcement officers and their families live constantly with the risk that goes with such a difficult job. We honor their service and mourn the loss of these two fine officers.
I have been talking with and comforting many people around Ohio who have personal stories about family members or friends beset by the opioid crisis. They have different insights into how to deal with this tragic problem, but many also overlap. I am listening carefully.
I have been highly critical of the Republican legislature’s hard ideological edge and for avoiding tough problems like Medicaid expansion, the unemployment fund, and reforming education monitoring and oversight. But I am glad to say they did well on the redistricting compromise.
Clean air, clean water, available public lands and parklands are things we count on to maintain our quality of life. They require updated infrastructure, dedicated funding, and vigilant attention from federal, state, and local officials working together. I will insist on that.
When we took on the foreclosure crisis in Ohio a decade ago, we brought people together - state and local officials, our great nonprofits, and the private sector. That is the Ohio Way. We now need to do it with opioids, justice reform, environmental issues, and many others.
As we run in the primary, we all will be seeking support from individuals and from groups, based on issues and relationships and experience and track records. None of this squelches the voice of the people - it IS the voice of the people as expressed in political action.
The truest thing that can be said for so many candidates in the governor race on the Democratic side is they are all looking at the same picture and see a real opportunity. We happen to think that Betty and I make the best ticket. But the people will decide!
In economic markets, the participants often seek to avoid competition and reap secure surplus rents instead. The same in politics, where many try to minimize competition and prolong themselves in office. But none of that is good for the public.
I testified regularly before the U.S. House as director of the CFPB and saw the results of gerrymandering on full display. Looking over their shoulder for a primary challenger made the place highly polarized and dysfunctional. For my hostile accusers, ideology trumped facts.
We have reports that President Obama and Attorney General Holder are focusing on state races that will affect Congressional redistricting around the country. Those include the governor, secretary of state, and auditor races here in Ohio. We want fair maps!
News yesterday that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will look into how CFPB is handling or ditching the Equifax probe. He and I discussed the topic several times and he seems to understand the damage that massive breaches do to consumers and the financial system. So we’ll see.
As best I can tell, since we’ve had primary elections in Ohio, no Democrat ever has first been elected governor without having to fight through a primary race. Some primaries had 6 or 7 candidates. We’ll make our case and let the voters decide. As it should be.
So it looks like a 7-way or 8-way primary on the Democratic side in the race for governor. Many candidates don’t like competition, so they gerrymander the districts. But it is good for voters, and Betty and I are embracing this primary. Glad to EARN our way forward!
Good give and take with progressives in southern Ohio last night on an array of issues and concerns. Much feeling that state government in Columbus talks much more than it listens. Partnership of state and local officials is badly frayed, undermining progress in our communities. https://t.co/xY6iYh8FK6
In filing petitions to run for Governor, again I found it impossible not to think back on teachers in school, mentors in the workplace, allies and supporters, parents and siblings and friends, who encouraged and supported my dreams. Only possible feeling is deep gratitude.
President Trump yesterday called Democrats at the State of the Union “un-American” and “treasonous” for not applauding him. How much applauding did he do, or did Ryan or McConnell do, for President Obama? Was that unpatriotic too?
Glad just now to be in position to file 3,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot as a candidate for governor of Ohio. Thanks to many who took time to drum up support. Moving to think of all those who have helped Betty and me along the way to this great opportunity. https://t.co/WdVUwbI8es
More and more people are feeling an electoral wave coming this year. Telling quote is: “They can’t wait to vote.” We are seeing and hearing it all over this state, and it is reverberating all around the country. None of it matters unless we win.
Very important that any redistricting plan be fair to both sides and minimize efforts to divide counties, which leads to the worst gerrymandering. Important to maintain the governor’s role also, which can help enforce a fair map on the state legislators.
Under this Republican Congress and Administration, the federal deficit is ballooning from $500 billion last year to almost $1 trillion this year. Little or no room left to address problems like infrastructure and the opioid crisis. The Tea Party has laryngitis all of a sudden.
Talk of the recent tax bill just reminds us that it wasted $1.5 trillion on trickle-down economics that does not trickle down, while building nothing for America’s future. Now we hear that if there is going to be any infrastructure, they want to do it on the cheap.
Many local leaders and law enforcement officials calling on the Trump Administration to provide help with Ohio’s opioid crisis. Yet yesterday’s visit turned up empty. So far just hollow talk with no serious money to support local efforts to address this horrific problem.
Just now seeing that CFPB pseudo-leadership may be pulling back from pursuing ongoing investigation of Equifax data breach that hurt tens of millions of Americans. If you’re not going to stand up for consumers on something this important, then what good are you?
Last stop Saturday in Chillicothe was at Carl’s Townhouse for a hamburger (tenderloin) and a milkshake. This iconic restaurant is so beloved that when they moved locations, rather than tear it down, they shipped it across town one night at 3am and put it on a new foundation!
Speaker Paul Ryan is so desperate to find good news on the tax bill that he tweeted about a public school secretary who got a raise of $1.50 per week. Once it became clear how pathetic this was, and how little the tax bill is trickling down, he hastily deleted the tweet!
President Trump is coming to Cincinnati today apparently to take a victory lap over the recent tax bill. Given the history here in Ohio over the past 20 years, not sure it makes sense to brag about bringing us more trickle-down economics that doesn’t trickle down.
Pastor LaMarr was strong today and lifted up Minister Hopkins also. Pastor cracked me up by describing the failed “waiting game” he played with his oatmeal as a child. Mission statement resonated: “To make a profound impact in our homes, neighborhoods, city, state, and Nation.”
New report out that wind energy growth in Ohio slowed last year. How does that make any sense? We have a backward-looking legislature on many issues. If we don’t move forward, we will fall behind. #OhioDeservesBetter.
We need to understand in Ohio that diversity and inclusion are strengths for us to build on, not things to be feared. To attract businesses here, and to get and keep the best young people, we need a welcoming and tolerant atmosphere, with nobody pushed out or left out.
A picture paints a thousand words: Strong Support from Southern Ohio Dem County Chairs. We will take the fight to all 88 counties and we will take back Ohio this year! https://t.co/EefqEeXfeH
Glad to see Fed Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in one of her last official acts, reinforced the enforcement actions we at CFPB had taken against Wells Fargo by curbing growth and restricting board membership until they provide assurances they will better serve consumers.
Steve and Sheila Madru hosted the meeting today. They know everybody and always pave the way for me in my efforts. Told them we would see about water skiing again this summer, though I’m a few years older than the last time we went!
Traveling from Circleville to Lancaster, Dick Gerhardt and I could see again the beautiful vistas of southern Ohio. Then down to Chillicothe, where the hills are so darn beautiful that, as you may know, they form the backdrop on the Great Seal of the State of Ohio! https://t.co/iELJLdkzvF
Also over today to the Fairfield County Dems pancake breakfast. Didn’t get to eat much with so many people to talk to, but that is a good kind of problem to have! Jane and Jay Snipes pictured with me here have always been my reliable stalwarts in this area. https://t.co/kPZgOmTNUj
Down to Chillicothe today to see many Southern Ohio Democratic County Chairs and other local officials as well. Feels like Old Home Week! Lots of support in southern Ohio and down to the river. We’ve worked closely together before and will again this year. https://t.co/XZEXbywvSo
Milan: in Italy, mih-LAHN; in Ohio, MY-lun. Berlin: in Germany, bur-LIN; in Ohio, BUR-lin. Lima: in Peru, LEE-muh; in Ohio, LIME-ah. Toledo: in Spain, to-LAY-doe; in Ohio, to-LEE-doe. Clearly we’re not the least bit afraid to do things differently from the rest of the world!
Speaking of Groundhog Day, Auditor Yost now suddenly wants a performance audit for Jobs Ohio. Where’s he been for the past 7 years? If he thinks it lacks transparency now, what changed in the meantime? How does he justify being so late to the game? Maybe he saw his shadow
#GroundhogDay today, and old Punxatawney Phil saw his shadow, so 6 more weeks of winter. Haven’t we had plenty already? One year I was in Darke County for the occasion, and they used a pot-bellied pig to provide an economic forecast. Next came the financial crisis!
Township officials are very practical minded. They are problem solvers who address all of the issues presented in the local community. There is no big bureaucracy and they can’t and don’t pass the buck. Elected on a nonpartisan basis, they work well together with all comers.
Up to Bowling Green last night to spend some time with the Wood County Democrats. Great mix of people who are pretty much fired up and ready to go! A number of BGSU Falcons and lots of good questions on tough issues to put me through my paces. https://t.co/gyTrNQJsNB
Just visited the Ohio Township Association and many township leaders from around Ohio. I grew up in Jackson Township and now live in Pleasant Township, so can relate directly to their interests and concerns. “Stop the War on Local Government” is what I hear loud and clear.
Very upsetting to see the CFPB squatter leadership now interfering with the Fair Lending unit’s important work enforcing laws against discrimination in credit markets. We took on tough cases about redlining and other violations. Some don’t like it but it is the Law of the Land.
Many heads nod from the rural areas and small and mid-sized towns around Ohio when I detail the war on local governments that the state legislature has been waging for years now. This must change. Working together and supporting one another to solve our problems is The Ohio Way.
My friend and former AG colleague, @GovernorBullock, now Governor of Montana, out today with strong executive order on #netneutrality requirement for all who contract with the state. I will do the same as Governor of Ohio. It’s the right thing to do.
At the Farm Bureau yesterday, great discussion about the challenges we are facing in our rural areas. Support for agricultural services, business planning and succession issues, tax issues, broadband, school funding equity, and more. Much to do! Listening and learning.
Fundraising numbers out today for Cordray-Sutton show strong support and widespread interest in this race. We are grateful for every single contribution and feel the deep responsibility of people who place their trust and express their hopes in our success.
.@toledonews insightfully recognizes that the ECOT scandal is shaping up as the Coingate scandal of 2018, even worse in many ways. Their investigative reporting blew open Coingate, and tough reporting is cracking open this one as well. Hail to the power of the Fourth Estate!
.@SteveKoff of the @ThePlainDealer with a great article yesterday on how the fight over the CFPB is unfolding in DC. Notable too that more of the action is moving to the state level, where I now am, as a focus in the years ahead.  https://t.co/fTVQ4KNzbQ
Always enjoy schoolboy basketball with my brother and our friends! Last night saw the West Jefferson Roughriders and Worthington Christian Warriors in action. My friend’s son is point guard for WJ. Coach Weakley for WC used to play with my brother, recently got his 300th win.
We fought this case against the naysayers and the critics, the financial industry and the Congress, as well as the Administration, which changed sides to oppose the independence of this new people’s agency. We were right to do so.
Again, much more to be said, but today’s decision is all about maintaining independent law enforcement free from politics. We are seeing that theme over and over again in efforts by the courts to check the rogue use of executive power. Here with the CFPB.
Seeing the DC Court of Appeals has issued a strong opinion today favoring the independence of the CFPB. Some other statutory issues mixed. Much to talk about here, more than can be said in a quick Twitter feed. A historic ruling, maybe soon on its way to the Supreme Court.
Many thanks to my esteemed friend, leader, and public servant, Cincinnati Mayor @JohnCranley who endorsed Betty and me yesterday. Dayton Mayor @NanWhaley and John and I oppose the war on local government in Ohio and will finally put a stop to it. https://t.co/zxmzopZC2g
Maybe President Trump will finally get around to infrastructure tonight. Keen interest to see what money is involved and how. If it is a pittance from the federal government and much imagined private money, count me as skeptical. Many infrastructure needs right here in Ohio!
As Father Neil told us all, the good side of politics is not self-serving but instead serves others. John Kilbane later followed up by recalling how Jimmy would spur us in the right direction with counseling marked by “spirited encouragement.” Very spirited indeed!
Father Neil Kookoothe gave a brilliant homily at Jim Goggin’s funeral yesterday, capturing the best aspects of the labor movement and good politics. Not about self-aggrandizement, but about human dignity, human flourishing, and human relationships. That was our Jimmy!
After spending time at the Farmers Union, I am worried. I used to see the ag sector up close from the Treasurer’s office, where we had the ag-link program of low-cost farm loans. Federal policies are now putting pressure on cost inputs and also weakening our export markets.
As we near the end of January, there is light at the end of the tunnel - pitchers and catchers report in just two weeks! First signs of spring!
Partnership between state and local officials, our great nonprofits, and those from the private sector who are willing to help is The Ohio Way. That is how we addressed the foreclosure crisis together. That is always how we have attacked problems successfully.
Ohioans want practical solutions to the challenges we face, not bumper sticker slogans. They want public officials to fight for their principles but to work together where they can on behalf of the people. I have done that before and can do it again.
A coalition, including noted clergy, wants payday lending reform on the statewide ballot. We know what Ohioans think because they told us before. Legislature won’t act because of the campaign money. Ohio has worst interest rates in the country. Power to the people!
This is how one-party Republican rule has failed Ohio. Many millions of dollars siphoned away from our schools and our kids. Funnelled to cronies and special interests protected by the state legislature. All money taxpayers will never see again. #OhioDeservesBetter
ECOT wasted tremendous amounts of taxpayer money, maybe as much as a billion dollars. Even now it still owes the state $54 million that likely never will be collected. Yet the CEO has millions in real estate holdings protected by a web of corporate structures.
New survey out from top consulting firm shows that only 7% of companies expect to raise wages for all employees after the corporate tax cut bill, while 80% have no such plans. So more trickle down that doesn’t trickle down. Enact, fail, repeat. Enact, fail, repeat. Mindless!
Consumer spending stood out as the strongest part of GDP figures for the 4th quarter. That has been true for some time. A marketplace that works better, with stronger consumer protections, gives people more confidence to decide how to spend their money.
One might reasonably look at the recent corporate tax cut bill, costing us $1.5 trillion, much of it piled on the backs of our children and grandchildren, and say: Here is the REAL waste, fraud, and abuse in government!
Imagine the chaos for these 12,000 students and their families, halfway through the school year, dumped on the sidewalk! And how will it disrupt teachers as some come back into our public schools? Does their money come back too or is it just gone? We know the answer.
Failed for-profit charter school ECOT now tells parents of kids who were enrolled in its disastrous online program: Goodbye and Good Luck. “All families are encouraged to identify alternate educational opportunities for former ECOT students.” Translation: You’re on your own.
CFPB flack responds in Washington Post to my defense of “pushing the envelope” to protect consumers with odd reference to Shelley’s poem Ozymandias. If the point is sic transit gloria mundi, it’s wise to keep in mind that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.
Hearing curious things about the combined effects of Trump-era policies on agriculture. Keep in mind it is Ohio’s #1 industry. Some policies put upward pressure on input costs. Others put downward pressure on output prices, especially exports. Farmers are being squeezed!
At Farmers Union today, Joanne Hillman of Five Points in Pickaway County told me her Mom worked in the foster grandparent program that my Mom headed. Her Mom always referred to me as “Little Richard.” Of course, that stage name is taken, but we had a good hug about it! https://t.co/HGI2a4pveK
Invited to Ohio Farmers Union this morning. Much to discuss and much to hear from them. Rural development, voc-ag programs, sustainability, rural broadband, fertilization methods, aging farming population, rural health care, alternative energy, school funding equity, and more.
Shout-out to @SenWarren for her impassioned statement this week in support of our campaign. She knows what it means to stand and fight for a principle that matters in people’s lives. She fought with me for consumers, and who are they? Oh, just each and every one of us.
In Akron yesterday with strong public officials and community leaders who want fervently to help @BettySutton and myself take back Ohio in 2018. We will bring our #kitchentable campaign to every corner of Ohio. And we will fight for every single vote.
Ohio’s Community Action agencies were just in Columbus to make people aware of how much they do for our quality of life. I get it and always have. They helped us save homes and they support people through tough days of financial stress. Honored to speak with them! Thanks Phil!
Laborers Local 310. The County Mayo Society of Greater Cleveland Ball. The Cleveland Building &amp; Construction Trades Council. The Irish Good Fellowship Luncheon for St. Patrick’s Day. Cleveland. Galway. May God hold you in the palm of His hand.
I join many here and abroad who mourn the sudden passing of Jimmy Goggin, a friend to all in the labor movement, both a spur and a balm to public servants like me. He was a beloved Irishman and he was always here for all of us, “in sunshine or in shadow.” Broken-hearted today.
Still basking in the warmth of Dempsey’s last night, at an event filled with old and new friends dedicated to taking back Ohio in 2018. Find myself ever glad to spend a little time with my running mate, @BettySutton.  Then off to join in boosting our friend @ComMarilynBrown
Maybe a billion dollars down the drain! After all the fancy awards for ECOT’s supposedly great phantom recordkeeping, the prancing around at their graduation ceremonies, and the circle of crony protection within the Ohio Republican Party, nothing but ashes for our children.
Just think of how the failed ECOT experiment plundered our schools and our kids! How it dries up confidence in government and fosters the view that lobbyists and insiders are feasting with no conscience at the expense of taxpayers! #OhioDeservesBetter
My son tells me that many fundamental tenets of Stoic philosophy came close to early Christian teaching and doctrine about how to live an ethical life. Recognizing the importance of keeping order in ourselves to reflect the essential order of the world.
I dug frequently into Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations during the tribulations at CFPB last year. His Stoic outlook holds great appeal. We must try our utmost to be deserving and worthy of respect. External vicissitudes must be kept in perspective. Easier said than done though!
In Newark last night to speak with Licking County Democrats. Packed house! Great energy! And lots of tough questions putting me through my paces. I appreciated the brisk workout and the deep commitment to changing our state and nation. We need to win this year.
Notably, DC court of appeals yesterday granted an expedited hearing and set a fast briefing schedule in the case over the proper succession at the CFPB. Shouldn’t the statute governing the agency be the statute determining the line of succession? This court will now decide.
I also had Thomas More in my office: “I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties, they lead their country by a short route to chaos.” And: “it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world … but for Wales?”
Leaked memo from the CFPB’s putative acting director says the agency will no longer “push the envelope” on behalf of consumers as we did on my watch. Did we push hard to see that people are treated fairly by big banks, debt collectors, and payday lenders? You bet we did.
More retreat yesterday from current squatter leadership at CFPB, this time closing an investigation into the predatory practices of a payday installment lender that had given money to the alleged acting director’s campaign. The fish rots from the head down.
Not to mention that state income tax cuts have often hurt funding for local governments (causing local property taxes to rise). That pits the state legislature against local officials in ways that do not help solve our problems and that hinder our mutual effectiveness.
Tax cuts here at the state level have brought us trickle-down economics that does not seem to trickle down. Since 2005, when Ohio began its zealous tax-cutting binge, the state’s rate of job growth has been just 25% of the national average.
Ohio trails the national average of states in job growth. Last year, Ohio’s rate of job growth was only 50% of the national average. And 2017 was Ohio’s worst year of job creation since the end of the Great Recession.
As we travel the state, Betty and I see workforce development as a key in shaping the future of Ohio and expanding opportunity for our children and adults alike. We have long had a skills gap - many jobs going unfilled for lack of qualified applicants. That needs to be solved.
Now see that the #CHIP program was finally reauthorized for 6 years as part of the agreement to reopen the government. Many children and families in Ohio rely on it, and it never should have become a political football in the first place.
Honored to have @mlfudge's support for our campaign. @BettySutton and I will be her partners in Columbus in the fight to put Ohio families first. #CordraySutton https://t.co/WzUM2WSFGl
On the ECOT scandal: “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.” Then next in Matthew: “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
In 2016, the login information for many hundreds of ECOT students showed that as many as 70% missed so many days of school that they could be declared truant under state law. How is that working for anyone? Oh yeah, the CEO with his opulent mansions.
While ECOT was avoiding accountability, the Dispatch helpfully informs us that its CEO was buying a million-dollar home in Upper Arlington, a second waterfront home, and yet another house in Key West worth $3.7 million. All with OUR money! Without educating the children!
Details in Dispatch story on ECOT are startling. It was a fraud from the start: in its first year it reported 2,270 students, but records show only SEVEN logged on to any school computer systems. Not 70, not 700. Just 7. They got a slap on the wrist and kept right on going.
In May, @realDonaldTrump said the US “needs a good shutdown.” Now the Budget Chief says it’s “kind of cool” to be in charge of a shutdown. Kind of cool? For all the employees who work with no pay? For small contractors hurt by the gap who may go out of business? #Heartless
Proud to have my daughter join the Women’s March in Atlanta where she is a freshman in college. Grateful to everyone in our nation who is standing up for change and engaging in the hard work of advocacy. They are showing the way to a better future. https://t.co/qMDQFY41LB
At Toledo events, had the chance to talk about libraries with some of the @ToledoLibrary leadership. They are jewels in the crown of Ohio! Community hubs, resource centers, raising our quality of life! We must make sure we honor, protect, and support them.

Where is @realDonaldTrump on payday lending? Seems to be AWOL. Last month, in another matter, he tweeted that “I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating.” In our Kansas case, payday lenders were caught cheating. So where’s the beef?
More retreat from the CFPB on payday lending, announcing it is abandoning a lawsuit brought on my watch in Kansas federal court against a group of payday lenders who misled consumers and did not disclose interest rates as high as 950%. Unconscionable!
.@BettySutton and I were thrilled to meet with @CuyahogaDems this morning - everyone full of passion and determination to fight for a better future for our state. https://t.co/xGGmtf1fx4
It took 6 years to build the CFPB into a powerful force for good, ensuring that people are treated fairly in the financial marketplace. “Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,/ And stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools.” Watch this new review process carefully.
Making government work effectively takes the will and the courage to confront and surmount obstacles. It takes the drive to move any human organization forward rather than standing still and stagnant. It takes creativity and also persistence. It is not easy.
I don’t believe government can or should be all things to all people. It has its role, often a vital role, alongside other forces in our society like the private and nonprofit sectors. But government that works to solve the practical problems people face just makes sense to me.
I found it ironic, sad, maddening, and frustrating - all at the same time - to see people in Washington consciously undermining the government by getting in its way, then complaining about how it doesn’t work. Why shouldn’t we want our government to be effective for our people?
As we teeter on the brink of yet another #governmentshutdown, consider who gets hurt. Big contractors can weather the uncertainty, whereas small businesses that don’t get paid on time have less cushion and some will likely go under. But does anyone in DC really care?
RT @SteveDettelbach: Nothing will undo the damage that ECOT and the politicians who enabled this scam have done to Ohio taxpayers and kids.…
ECOT took taxpayer money with the promise to deliver an education worthy of our children. Now they've left us in the lurch. Ohio deserves better.

Parma was originally known as Greenbriar, but the name was later changed to reflect the grandeur and beauty of Parma, Italy. Businessweek recently recognized Parma as one of the best places in Ohio to raise kids. And we have a lot of great places to raise kids!

Enough already with the redistricting shenanigans in the Ohio legislature. Give us a fair process with input from both sides, and don’t try to cut the governor out. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.
Really happy to be endorsed by the @LimaBuilding Trades and the Ohio State Association of Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters. The people who build Ohio better are starting to unite in support of the team of @BettySutton and myself. We are grateful, and we are determined.
Noticed the dead silence yesterday from @realDonaldTrump on whether he supports the move by CFPB to reconsider the strong payday lending rule. Does he stand on the side of payday lenders or on the side of the people? Ohio voters spoke in 2008: 64-36 against payday lending.
Congress is so remarkably dysfunctional. Dragged through the holidays scaring families with the loss of #CHIP health benefits for their children. Now facing another deadline to avoid a government shutdown, jeopardizing the businesses of many small contractors. Time to grow up!
RT @SteveKoff: Wonder what the @RichCordray tweets are about? This. https://t.co/D88alKDTdR
Overwhelmed by the strong enthusiasm and excited to move ahead! https://t.co/POAgZNql3O
Let’s hear too from a broad alliance of ministers, priests, nuns, rabbis, and imams on whether the Trump crowd should roll back the strong CFPB rule on payday loans. Micah: What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.
Let’s see the case be made, with full debate, on whether the zealots and toadies can justify repealing a rule to protect consumers against extortionate payday loans. Whenever the public has voted on this issue, it has always overwhelmingly sided against payday lenders.
But watch closely for them to try - under the radar - to roll back the payday rule. Congress could pursue a CRA vote to overturn it, in full public view, but it seems they don’t have the guts. Instead, hire new bureaucrats to shred years of analysis and kill it off stealthily.
So far, at least, the CFPB’s announcement is limited to pushing back the compliance deadlines under the new payday rule, which were to have become effective yesterday, triggering deadlines to apply to become a registered information system under the rule.
Where’s @realDonaldTrump on protecting consumers against debt trap loans made at 391% interest rates or even higher? Don’t hide on this one, Mr. President, come out and tell us where you stand. Give America a tweet and proudly stand up for payday lenders against consumers!
Truly shameful action by the interim pseudo-leaders of the CFPB, announcing their plans to reconsider the payday lending rule just adopted in November. Never mind many thousands of people stuck in debt traps all over the country. Consumers be damned!

Was reminded the other day that the American Whistle Corporation in Columbus is the only remaining manufacturer of whistles in the country, including for the Super Bowl! They do tours as well and explain the magic of how the little ball gets inside the whistle.
At the MLK breakfast yesterday, one of the speakers put very succinctly and eloquently a point that I have been feeling in the current climate: that the “othering of America must disappear.” Putting others down to boost oneself up is not the right way.
Judge Glenda Hatchett, keynoting the Columbus MLK breakfast, noted that we are not called to be paralyzed. Instead, we must see that we stand on the shoulders of mighty, mighty generations, which gives us a responsibility and how dare we not fulfill it. Amen!
Enforcing the ECOA led to actions against discrimination in mortgage lending, credit card lending, and auto lending. That fight led to the US Supreme Court in the Inclusive Communities case, and much back and forth with Congress. It is difficult but worthy work.
We all worked hard on that speech, to understand and explain why banning discrimination in all forms of financial credit transactions is essential to full economic inclusion in our society. And we embraced that view, as enacted by Congress, in our work at the Consumer Bureau.
On Oct 10, 2014, as CFPB Director, I spoke at MSU on “Economic Rights as Civil Rights: The Case of Fair Lending.” It was 60 years after Brown v Board, 50 years after the Civll RIghts Act and, as I noted, 40 years after the ECOA, which protects economic rights as civil rights.
“We demand this fraud be stopped. Our weapon is our vote.” This is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking against so-called RIght to Work in 1961. Ohio’s public officials should take heed. Civil rights and economic rights are kitchen table issues. #kitchentable #MLK
“by which unions have improved wages and working conditions for everyone. Wherever these laws have been passed, wages are lower, job opportunities are fewer and there are no civil rights. We do not intend to let them do this to us…”
In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false slogans, such as ‘right to work.’ It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights. Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining …”
As Dr. King told us: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” This is such a time - always is such a time. Run to the fight for the soul of America. #MLKDay
Still thinking on yesterday’s service with @DrCharlesEBooth, 40 years of ministry, who told us - what else? - “it’s not about me, it’s about Him.” And that God gives us great friends, then turned things over to his own friend Bishop Jerome H. Ross, Sr. to rock the congregation.
Dr. Martin Luther King Birthday Breakfast in Columbus always brings in the best speakers from around the country. Today will be @TheJudgeHatchet , on the enduring dream of justice as an elusive but essential concept in our world and in our government. #MLKDay
Hearing tremendous feedback around the state about the new partnership with @BettySutton and how her experience and many accomplishments deepen and complement my own record of public service. We share the right focus and can back it up! #kitchentable
Continued exasperation over the failure of the Congress to renew the CHIP program. How can we be threatening children with the loss of healthcare, and their families with all that anxiety, because politicians can’t get their act together to do their job? GET IT DONE ASAP!
.@DispatchAlerts has noted the explosion of grandfamilies - children being raised by grandparents, not mothers and fathers. More fallout from neglecting the festering opioid crisis. Much love, but great burdens and Ohio not among the 35 states with a kinship assistance program.
Off to see @DrCharlesEBooth, world-renowned preacher and teacher and worthy servant of God, marking 40 years at Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, now as Senior Pastor. We are lucky he came to Ohio for United Theological Seminary and stayed!
In fact, if not for the overlay of getting a political advantage by suppressing people’s votes, in any other setting this kind of needless duplication would be decried by Republicans as another celebrated case of government waste, fraud, and abuse. So cut it out!
Not clear to me why Sec of State needs to push for purging voters in this manner. Everyone with a driver’s license gets updated regularly on identity and residence. Why not just rely on that where applicable? Why have a separate system that just makes things harder for people?
Concerned about reports on the argument in the voter purge case. No reason it should be this hard or that any judgment calls should be made against supporting people’s fundamental constitutional right to cast a vote for leaders and issues they care about.
I agree with @DrVernonSykes, who served with me in the General Assembly, about the cynical and selfish motives behind the Republican redistricting proposal. He’s been studying these issues for over 20 years! https://t.co/chgTZivuku
It makes me feel better too. And we do share the same love for having breakfast at Lily’s Kitchen Table in Grove City! https://t.co/90EdG5EcFo
Disappointed to be snowed out this morning with my friends who serve as County Chairs in southern Ohio. Stay warm and be safe! And see you all again quite soon.
.@BettySutton was born and raised and lives in Barberton (#58), one of Ohio’s small towns near Akron. I was born and raised and live just outside of Grove City (#30), one of Ohio’s small towns near Columbus. Good synergy! Good values! Good people! Good place to make a life!
Ohio has more than 80 cities with populations between 20,000 and 80,000. You might see big chunks of the state as Small Town USA. Some are suburbs of the largest cities, others are freestanding hubs, such as a number of county seats. Many people adore that lifestyle.
“Well I was born in a small town/ And I live in a small town/ ... No I cannot forget where it is that I come from/ I cannot forget the people who love me/ Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town/ And people let me be just what I want to be” #JohnMellencamp

Off to Dayton this morning to see a highly respected friend of mine. Nobody has done more to call out and fight back against the legislature’s war on local government than Mayor Nan Whaley. Glad to join with her in supporting those who deliver on the front lines for Ohioans.
Last night, we introduced the Cordray-Sutton ticket to Ohio Democratic County Chairs. First time I have been able to speak to them in over 7 years! Could not do any politics while I headed the Consumer Bureau, consistent with federal law. Now I can breathe freely again.
As a lawyer, @BettySutton stood up for working people and fought to protect them when they were mistreated. She is tough but caring. You cannot live through stories of people facing unjust threats to their livelihood without coming away more committed than ever. And she is!
On the road with @BettySutton yesterday. She is a great partner with me and a great leader in her own right. We have much in common, most of all a practical sense of how to get results on the kitchen table issues that Ohioans care about the most
Busy yesterday! Good busy! Also lots of reaction to my patriotic tweet about the shape of Ohio, some hilarious. To the few Colorado and Wyoming adherents, straight lines are just plain boring. Our north and south perimeters save us by making us interesting.
Busy day for the team. But don’t think you’ve heard the end of my opinions on the shape of Ohio! (I’m talking to YOU, @NateSilver538 with your Kentucky as a leg of fried chicken - great vision and good complementarity, but it ain’t up to the shape of Ohio.
.@BettySutton served as U.S. head of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. Broad view of her mission to promote economic development on the Great Lakes. Just ask the longshoremen about how she finds ways to make a difference for working people and for Ohio.
.@BettySutton also moved the amendment to the ACA that required protections for pre-existing conditions to take effect immediately rather than after a delay. This saved lives and eased the strain on people and their families. She gets us and cares about us! #kitchentable
.@BettySutton was the primary sponsor of the CARS Act, known widely as Cash for Clunkers. It meant over 60,000 jobs in and around the auto industry when we needed them the most. Creative, pro-jobs, pro-environment. REAL public service that made a difference for Ohio and the U.S.!

Can’t say hello to new Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein without a warm embrace and farewell to consummate and creative public servant Rick Pfeiffer. Always has given me candid advice (the best kind) in a kind and affectionate way that lifted me up. Thank You!
Swearing in Zach Klein as new Columbus City Attorney. He worked with Judge Holschuh, with me, with Vice President Biden, and with me again. Then he left the nest, and ever since we have watched him fly as a worthy and deserving public official.
Notably, all of the D governors in the last 60 years who flipped Ohio from R to D were elected with an R in the White House. And all of them were elected easily (closest was Gilligan in 1970 by 11 points). Looks like 2018 is going to be a good year!
All D governors in my lifetime have had primaries: Strickland in 2006, Celeste in 1982, GIlligan in 1970. And just before that, DiSalle (7-way!) in 1958. Exercising those muscles makes us tougher than if we remain lazily at rest. So bring it on.
Looks like we may have some competition this spring, as well as in the fall. What does not kill us makes us stronger!
Ohio has a unique and pleasing shape, I have always thought. Kind of a pentagon or home plate, with straight sides, a meandering river boundary below, and a partly straight top with a friendly bite mark out of it on the northeast side from Lake Erie.
Excited to share some big news this week on our campaign. More to come this Wednesday!

Seismic happenings in the U.S. Senate race yesterday roil the political scene here. Personal regards to the Mandel family. Through it all, Senator Sherrod Brown steadily does his great work standing up for Ohioans and fighting for the middle class!
We had begun to see the makings of bipartisan progress on justice reform in DC and around the country. Some of us see the moral failure of wasted lives and squandered potential, others cite the immense cost. We cannot let further progress on this issue just fall down.
Deeply perturbed by yesterday’s report on shockingly high infant mortality rates in the African-American community. How can we let that happen in the United States? How can we let it happen in Ohio? We are better than this and will be, but only if we work together.

People like Steve Bannon seek to stoke identity politics to stir people up and pit them against one another. It is cynical, and it undermines our sense of shared community and our ability to make economic and social progress. It will continue to hold us back, if we let it.
Issues about how we treat one another, whether we work together to solve our most pressing problems and respect one another’s rights in the process, at bottom are #kitchentable issues as well. We cannot build our economy by dividing our communities.
Issues about inclusiveness and spreading economic opportunity to all levels of our society are #kitchentable issues. They change the pattern of economic development in our state. They affect both workforce development and how we attract and retain jobs.
Issues about equal pay for equal work are #kitchentable issues. Issues about racial justice, such as the cases on redlining and discrimination in mortgage loans and auto loans and credit card loans we fought at the Consumer Bureau, are kitchen table issues.
Dignity and respect for sanitation workers, and their right to organize to make a better life for themselves and their families, stirred Dr. Martin Luther King in the final days of his life. Taking action together to lift people up is a way to fulfill their basic civil rights.
We learned at the Consumer Bureau that many #kitchentable issues are also issues about dignity and respect. When people are cheated or mistreated and can’t get the time of day from anyone to bother to fix it, that is a kitchen table issue but also is about dignity and respect.

Government is about priorities. Everyone is told to tighten their belt, local governments most of all. Then Congress goes and splurges on a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut that blows up the national debt and makes it harder to find the money to rebuild America.
We fought through huge piles of ideology at the Consumer Bureau. Our work helped consumers from every district in America. We solved people’s problems almost as a kind of constituent service. Some in Congress seem to hate it when government is actually working for people.
We can fight the culture wars over and over again, and some people gain a lot of profile by doing that. Or we can focus on the core economic issues that dominate people’s lives day in and day out. That’s where I am and will be in this campaign. #kitchentable
How does stirring up conflicts and picking fights help us forge the right path into the future? Since when does seeking out the most provocative course appeal to anyone? Why would driving others down make any of the rest of us feel better about ourselves?
First in 2016 and then again in 2017 we saw almost a concerted effort to sow division among us, to pit people against each other and find scapegoats to blame for the challenges we face, It’s wrong, and it doesn’t help us solve any of our problems.
I still don’t see any answer from Mike DeWine on whether he supports or opposes the Medicaid expansion (I support it). It seems he’s trying to straddle. Also the so-called right to work proposals (I’m opposed). I wonder if he and Husted even agree on those two issues.
Over the years, I have worked with Ohioans at all levels of government, in the private sector, and with our great nonprofits. They expect and deserve to see practical solutions to the problems they care the most about. #TheOhioWay
So we’re now into 2018, and a lot of rubber will meet the road in the coming months. I welcome all competition, which will sharpen our message, and look forward to making our case to Ohio voters.

I also passed my first consumer protection bill. The Realtors wanted to require home sellers to disclose major flaws to home buyers. We prompted Gene Watts to whistle it through the Senate, then fixed it and passed it in the House. The CFPB was not yet a gleam in anyone’s eye!
Years later, Mark Real, formerly of the @ChildDefender, showed me statistics on how our mandatory paternity testing law boosted child support enforcement in Ohio. A hard thing about legislation was that you often do not see the fruits of your work until much later.
My lucky break was sitting between Jane Campbell and Ray Miller, who had a lot to teach me. I got on a new committee on Children and Youth that Jane chaired; she let me work on legislation affecting child care, child support, and juvenile justice. I couldn’t get enough of it.
I was elected to the legislature in 1990. We had five new Democratic freshmen: myself, Weston, Maier, DiDonato, and Prentiss. With a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, you had to work across the aisle to get anything done. It was easier then, with more centrists.
I always considered running for office as providing the education you could never get in school. You deal with all kinds of people and learn what’s on their minds. You see all sides of the community, and you learn a lot about yourself - your drive and level of commitment.
When I first ran for the legislature, I went door to door on the west and south sides of Columbus and in Grove City and Obetz and Urbancrest. I marveled at how different things could seem just a mile apart. It got me out of my normal groove and really opened my eyes.
I once thought we should name our place, but then our young twins decided that we lived in a submarine named Speedy. So I suggested Speedy Park, for the trees, and they mocked me for coming up with the name of an airport rental car facility. So I just decided to drop it!
I grew up in an unincorporated township (Jackson) south of Grove City, and now live in another (Pleasant) west of town. We drink well water and have a septic tank, which creates some headaches. Our original farmhouse was built in the 1870s, and sits on 5½ acres with many trees.

Like so many places around Ohio, in Grove City the public schools have long been a main hub of the community. The bands, sports teams, and other activities bring people together, and many of our school friends and teachers remain in the area. We keep our eyes on one another.
More compelling evidence from the front lines of the state legislature’s war on local government in Ohio and how it is hurting our communities. https://t.co/d6nCIUHbuQ
I was cut from basketball in high school, so my interests shifted to debate and chess and In the Know, a quiz game that was my main activity. We competed hard for our great advisor, Mr. Powell, and won the championship my senior year. Then my son’s team won it 40 years later!
My athletic career peaked in middle school. In 7th grade, I won a mile match race against another strong runner, and we were flag football champions. In 8th grade, we won some kind of state basketball tourney. I played point guard, though I never could dribble very well.
In elementary school, we had an Enrichment program one day a week that fired our imaginations. Mrs. Stahl, our teacher, let us get up a head of steam in areas of our choosing. Years later, my twins had Mr. Schreiner in the same program. Her picture was on the back of his door.
In school, I was blessed with a great number of inspiring teachers. They kindled a love of learning in me and were willing to allow considerable latitude to develop it. I was fairly high-spirited and had to be settled down at times. But I was also pretty driven to succeed.
I think I was lucky to grow up as a middle child, one of three boys. We were crazy about sports, though we took them way too seriously relative to our modest abilities. I read lots of juvenile sports fiction about fair play and sportsmanship, Frank Merriwell types of stories.
Our Mom passed away many years ago, a victim of breast cancer. She never got to meet my own family, though I desperately wish she could have. My children know her as Ruth Elizabeth, and we read her series of 33 Oz books together and enchanting works by Jules Verne and others.
Mom taught us music and poetry, and she brought laughter and excitement into our family. She didn’t believe in being down, and we read Norman Vincent Peale’s Power of Positive Thinking at the dinner table. She made beautiful birthday cards and pushed us to aim high.
Even as a parent, our Mom was still a tomboy at heart, loving to paddle a canoe or walk a beach and get sand in her toes. Like many Moms, she was the focus and energy and magic of our family, making everything go and giving it a direction and an impetus.
Mom started the first foster grandparent program in Ohio (a Kennedy family idea), matching seniors with developmentally disabled youth and adults, who spent caring and affectionate time with them. Everyone involved loved one another and loved my Mom. It was true public service.
Mom went to Fairview High School, which was razed some years ago. Fellow alums include Judge Jeff Froelich and track star Edwin Moses. She went on to Stephens College and Michigan State, majored in Social Work, and later worked as a social worker and teacher.
Our Mom grew up in Dayton, on Kenilworth Avenue. When we were little and visited our grandparents, the woman next door was wheelchair-bound and had an elevator in her house. We were so excited to ride up and down, up and down! Funny the things you recall.
“Truly He taught us to love one another/ His law is love and His gospel is peace/ Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother/ And in His name all oppression shall cease/ Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we/ Let all within us praise His holy name”
Merry Christmas! On this most special day, we celebrate the birth of a newborn who became a refugee in Egypt from political persecution, and it is worth reflecting how as a community, a state, and a nation we must treat the anawim, the most vulnerable among us - with humanity.
“O holy night the stars are brightly shining/ It is the night of our dear Savior’s birth/ Long lay the world in sin and error pining/ Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth/ A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices/ For yonder breaks a new glorious morn”
Dennis has since recalled Auld Lang Syne, which we celebrate at the New Year, and its last verse on friendship: “And there’s a hand, my trusty fiere!/ and gie’s a hand o’ thine!/ And we’ll tak’ a right guid willie-waught,/ For Auld Lang Syne.” Good will to all on #ChristmasEve!
And this cautionary tale for 2018, from To a Mouse: “The best-laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men/ Gang aft agley,/ An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain/ For promised joy!” Let’s strive hard for the Promised Joy instead.
One we laughed about, To a Louse, where a proud woman sits in church in her best outfit, not realizing a bug is crawling on her bonnet. “O wad some Power the giftie gie us/ To see oursels as ithers see us!/ It wad frae mony a blunder free us/ An’ foolish notion”
Got the chance to sit awhile with @Dennis_Kucinich the other day. We found that in our youth we both learned to love the poems of Bobby Burns. His pronunciations were closer to the original than mine, though!
One more on my Dad, who passed away last year at 98. He lost his paper route money in a bank failure during the Depression. In my position at the CFPB, I also served on the FDIC Board insuring deposit accounts to protect Americans from such tragedies. Irony!
We used to  visit our Grandma in Dresden. She lived right next to the railroad tracks and we put pennies on the rails. After the train went by, they were flattened to a thin metal strip and very hot. I don’t know if it was dangerous - we were just kids, passing the time.
John Glenn grew up near my Dad’s hometown, in New Concord. Campaigning a few years ago, I found he had something in common with my Dad: they both could recite from memory the rollicking verses of Robert Service, poet of the Yukon. Especially The Cremation of Sam McGee!
My Dad was born and raised in Dresden, now famously the home of Longaberger baskets but then just a Norman Rockwell village where his Dad worked at the paper mill and he and his friends grew up playing all the sports (not just those they were good at).
Campaigning in Ohio means spending lots of time riding around in the car. On city streets or country roads, I-70 or 71 or 75 or 77 or the newer four-lane arteries Ted Strickland helped get through southern Ohio, that’s the rhythm of a campaign. Barney Oldfield, look out!
At the CFPB, I adapted Van Morrison to describe our enforcement attorneys: “Men [and women] with insight/ Men [and women] in granite/ Knights in armor, intent on chivalry.” When we ever got anything wrong, it was always while trying to do right by consumers - that is, all of us.
Fulton County native Barney Oldfield, born near Wauseon, was the first to go a mile a minute in 1903. When racing, he slid around corners like a motorcycle racer instead of braking. Buckeye ingenuity! Now we go 60 miles per hour every day, and don’t think a thing about it!
Becker-Riedel so-called “right to work” proposals introduced in Ohio House claim to boost competitiveness by stripping workers of longstanding protections. Again, I am squarely opposed. Still waiting to hear from Mike DeWine. Listening hard . . . hearing nothing. Crickets!
#kitchentable issues took some big hits in the #GOPtaxbill. Income inequality will be magnified, while access to healthcare is undermined. Now the drumbeat begins to offset the obscene cost of the tax bill through cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Hands off!
Rep. Becker’s obsession with so-called “right to work” threatens to bring about a repeat of the fight over Senate Bill 5, on an even bigger scale. Nobody is forgetting where people stood in that fight. Just leave well enough alone!
Our reasonably mild winter so far (just now officially begun, in fact) looks to be getting harsher soon. Accords with the bleak remains of the day after the #GOPtaxbill just passed, which spends all of today’s and much of tomorrow’s money for no tangible gains to the country.
Last night marked the end of Hanukkah. To me, it is the stirring story of Judah Maccabee and the fight of his faithful followers for righteousness. A very public holiday of lights shining into the darkness, transforming people and their outlook on life.
Spoke with Peter Lawson Jones today and @deandepiero yesterday. Strong leaders in Cuyahoga County backing our campaign. Great experience, wisdom, and advice.
The tax cut bill is a hardhearted and shortsighted abomination! Driven entirely by lust for supposed political gain, wasting $1.5 TRILLION that does not build our country. Infrastructure is AWOL! And has anybody ever read the story of Lazarus in Luke 16?
Rep. Becker pushing hard for House Bill 53 on right to work. If that comes to my desk as governor, I will veto it. Flat out. Now Becker is pushing to put the right to work issue on the ballot. I am against it. Is Mike DeWine for it or against it? Time to take a stand.
Was introduced to the Roman Burger yesterday in Lorain County. Salami and cheese cooked on top of a hamburger patty. Sounds strange, but it was really quite tremendous. Note to self: Please do not fall into eating your way across Ohio - You will never make it.
We now hear that the tax bill, which I have lamented and criticized several times already, is speeding toward passage, perhaps as soon as later today. People can see the misplaced priorities here, and the empty promise of economic growth recalls past tax cuts in Ohio.
Reminders across northern Ohio about the work we did to save so many jobs and protect Ohio interests in the Chrysler and GM bankruptcy proceedings. It was a scary time for our state, requiring leadership from federal, state, and local officials. Glad to have played my part!
Learning from @UAW leadership about key changes impending for the auto industry. Electric cars affect transmission production; self-driving cars will affect many aspects of production. We need to stay ahead of the curve to keep Ohio in the forefront. We will do that together!
Lorain County Commissioners @TedKalo, Lori Kokoski, @mattlundynews all out to support us, along with Prosecutor Dennis Will, Clerk Tom Orlando, Recorder Judy Nedwick, Lorain City Auditor Karen Shawver, with son @CoryShawverOH who is our future hope. Strong labor leaders as well!
In Lorain to meet with allies and supporters. We worked with many of them to save thousands of homes during the foreclosure crisis. People remember our work together. They want to come together again and work to solve the problems facing our state. We will do that!
#Netneutrality is a highly sensitive and important issue. Aggravating that Chairman Pai mocks people’s concerns by dressing up as Santa and wielding a lightsaber that he misuses on behalf of powerful interests. Winners and losers must be considered much more carefully!
This #GOPtaxbill gets worse and worse. The process has been revolting. The bill wastes $1.5 trillion that builds nothing for our future and helps those who need it least. In John Randolph’s immortal words, “Like a rotten mackerel in the moonlight, it both shines and stinks!”
Heading up I-71 today to Cleveland. Familiar drive. Years ago, this trip was made on the so-called 3-C highway (Routes 62 and 3), which went through many small towns that the freeway now bypasses. Important to note: there is much, much more to Ohio than just this key artery.
Our son comes home tonight, which will make for a FULL household again! It’s people and purpose that make the holiday season special.
A blessed day to be home and in the community. Read again today that the wise person builds a house on the rock, not on the sand. Small businesses are the rock of our local economies; companies that flit here and there to milk our communities of tax breaks are the sand.

Incubators and shared space (like we saw at Idea Works in Mansfield) can be crucial nurturing grounds to support new business concepts. Spin-offs from existing firms and processes can find and fill new economic niches. A conscious culture of entrepreneurial innovation.
Many small businesses can benefit by economies of know-how about the elements of being a business. Personnel administration, infrastructure logistics and support, organizational strategies. Let the key people concentrate solely on refining the core idea or product and executing.
Our small and mid-sized businesses are homegrown and not looking to move away. Working at small enterprises is known to enhance quality of life for employees and their communities. A sense of ownership and belonging, close teamwork, meaningful participation and achievement.
To revitalize Ohio’s economy in a sustainable way, supporting small business is a key part of the answer. We had the GrowNow program when I was Ohio Treasurer, which helped many small businesses expand and grow new jobs. We can do the same for many others through hard work.
Introduced in Canton by Harry Klide’s daughter Melissa now on our team. Honored! Stark Prosecutor John Ferraro, Massillon Clerk of Cts Johnnie Maier and Law Director Andrea Scassa, Canton Treasurer Kim Perez, former Commr Gayle Jackson, former Rep @stephenslesnick all with us!
.@SherrodBrown, conscience of the Senate, notes that #CHIP is not yet extended and money is running out. Families around the country told to brace for losing their children’s health insurance over the holidays because of DC failures. Cruel indifference! Breathtaking incompetence!
Now down to Canton, going past the Hall of Fame, of gridiron and pigskin, in the days when a drop-kick field goal was an adventure. Original Canton Bulldogs! More great friends here, including Sheriff George Maier, who brings people together and is respected on all sides.
In Summit County, Sheriff Steve Barry, John Donofrio, Margo Somerville, @fuscojeff, @MayorWalters , Clerk of Courts @SandraKurt, Andrea Norris, Diana &amp; Paul Colavecchio, Jerry Freeman, Ginger Baylor, Mary Nichols-Rhodes all endorsing. #teamcordray
Guess that wasn’t even the half of it in Summit County! Many pastors reaching out to support with prayers and efforts. Lots of elected official support. Incredibly strong grassroots organizing on the ground. Impressive efforts!
Across to Akron (as in Acropolis) and Summit County. The High Point of northeastern Ohio. With two diner stops, we are extending our kitchen table tour to talk about kitchen table issues. Many friends here! @ProsecutorWalsh and Russ Balthis are for us. #CordrayforOhio
In Mansfield at @mainstreetbks talking to small businesses that are the backbone of our economy. “Be Focal Buy Local” is their slogan! Jay Goyal will help us figure out how the state can boost small businesses more effectively. Hard work, but the right thing to do! #theohioway
“On the road again/ I just can’t wait to get on the road again/ The life I love is talkin’ issues with my friends/ And I can’t wait to get on the road again” #WillieNelson
With my folks from the UAW in Maumee. Local 969 on the West Side got me first elected to the Ohio General Assembly. They adopted me. Then I got the chance to stand up for the auto workers big time as AG during the Chrysler and GM bankruptcies. As the circle turns!
Kudos to @phrontpage! He noticed what I noticed: that I couldn’t possibly have coped with a limit of 140 characters. “Beginning to think Cordray was just waiting for the 280 character limit increase before getting into the race.” Made me laugh and nod at the same time. (268 😉)

STILL annoyed by that so-called “Financial Health Indicators Update.” It has red lights, yellow lights, and green lights for local governments in different conditions. Seems more patronizing than helpful. How about a big fat flashing red light for the state legislature?
Well, well! I see Auditor Yost has called out 9 Ohio cities showing signs of fiscal stress. Akron, Canton, Lorain, others. Are you KIDDING ME? Whose fault is THAT? The state legislature is waging war on local governments and you are “helping” them by pointing out this result?
Now @GDouglasJones has made it so that we can almost forgive Alabama for stealing the fourth spot from @OhioStateFB in the #CollegeFootballPlayoff.  Almost! Call me deacon blues.
“Dashing through the snow/ In a no-horse Ford Escape.” Just in time to pick up my daughter, home from completing her first semester of college. Hip, hip, hooray!
Headed to Tuscarawas County, a word used by the Delaware Tribe, perhaps meaning “open mouth” - well fits a political shindig! Soc Space, former County Chair, was first to endorse me for AG in 1997 (11 years later I was finally elected). I don’t forget. Ahead of his time!
We have some big news of our own to announce today. Our new Finance Director is @antoniakoch, who broke fundraising records this year in @ossoff’s U.S. House race in Georgia and then again in @GDouglasJones’ winning U.S. Senate race in Alabama. Welcome to our team!
Proud to have the support of Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin, highly respected former Columbus police lieutenant. As Attorney General, I worked with highly respected former Columbus SWAT commander Peter Tobin, now US Marshal. They are friends as well, I hear.
I have talked about #theohioway, bringing people together to solve our problems together. @GDouglasJones fought against hate crimes that divide our communities and now is our newest United States Senator. When we stand together, we can do great things. #Indivisible
Maybe you’ve heard the phrase “Putting party before country?” How about what we just saw in the #AlabamaSenate race, “Putting party before self-respect?” Character matters to voters - that’s the America we know and love.
Current and former teachers say they are dissatisfied with the testing and monitoring in place for our schools. Many are very concerned, and recall also how the legislature’s approach had put many young people in danger of not graduating. Time to rethink!
Howard Wilkinson quoting John Green - two keen observers - says grassroots Democrats like Cordray, but he will have to earn the nomination. “Nobody is going to hand it to him.” Agreed! The old-fashioned way! Just give me a fair chance to earn it. https://t.co/PJHA32Q1SD
Clark County Dems are brimming with energy! Disgust with the status quo, bold ideas for change, determination to make it happen. How do we do it? We have to vote, Vote, VOTE! Gather strength now, so next year we can seize our chance to forge a new path. #CordrayforOhio
Sat for a bit with @BuildCentralOH. Well, actually stood, shaking hands. We ALL were wondering where the promised #infrastructure has gone. We were going to have BEAUTIFUL roads and bridges, remember? Time for DC to put its money where its mouth is.
Speaking of time, John O’Grady and I were laughing at ourselves the other day as we tried and tried and eventually succeeded in recalling Mary Ellen Withrow’s trademark saying: “Yesterday is a canceled check, tomorrow is a promissory note, but … TODAY is CASH!”
When I began my tenure at the Consumer Bureau, all the pictures of my children in my office were from the sixth grade. And now they have graduated from high school and gone off to college! Time is a thief that takes from us what is most precious.
https://t.co/3BHZQoqfK7
Encouraging thoughts for @GDouglasJones in Alabama. Law and order prosecutor of hate criminals! Standing strong against the stain of Roy Moore! We salute you for putting on the gloves and making a noble fight. When our turn comes, we will gladly do the same.
Tom Suddes writes that in 1985, Ohio per capita income was 96% of the national figure. By 2016, it was 91%. “If tax cuts ... were the key to prosperity for ordinary Ohioans, most of the state’s men or women would be sitting pretty.” Tell it, Tom! Trickle down or dry hole?
Knew I had worked with many great local officials over the years, but seeing their faces and renewing friendships has been special. Simon and Garfunkel, “Old Friends/ Old Friends. Time it was/ And what a time it was/ It was .../ A time of innocence/ A time of confidences.”
Last week in Toledo, @OfficialCarty introduced me. He recalled when he was Mayor, budget cuts forced 150 police layoffs, but my AG team found money to save 75 jobs. He said he will always remember that, and so will they and their families. Choked me up. Thanks Carty!
Newly back on the campaign trail, I feel myself gradually rounding into shape, getting the rhythm, talking to people and hearing them narrate the stories of what matters in their lives. I draw energy from people’s stories. Coming along!

Holiday party at @OHDems. When I was an officeholder, my wife would ask, what’s with December and all these parties? Don’t you do any work? And I would try to explain, it kind of IS work. Yes it’s fun, but it’s important networking too. Not completely convincing, it seemed.
Talking to @OhioYD this morning. Lively! When I used to teach at OSU Law School, I found that every year I stayed just the same, but the students got younger and younger and younger. Any teachers out there know what I mean? Like Dorian Gray?
Meant to mention that on Thursday in Marion we visited @ramtec_ohio, which provides training and certification in robotics and advanced manufacturing. This is the kind of workforce development that can close the skills gap! Need more of it throughout Ohio! #goodjobs https://t.co/NWx0IUHG9i
Speaking of building trades, you see this horrendous tax cut bill flying through Congress with pencil scratchings all over it? Real confidence builder! And I just wonder, where’d the darn infrastructure go? Wasting $1.5 trillion - is it doing anything to help build our country?
In Lima with @BldgTrdsUnions and my friend Mike Knisley. Dennis Duffey and he always had me speak to their leaders about CFPB when they came to visit Capitol Hill. They do quality workforce development - top-flight apprenticeship programs! Strong worker safety! #BuildOhio
Any good campaign has an energy and a drive, a momentum exuding from the entire enterprise. But also a lightness and a vibrancy. Around each new corner, as C.S. Lewis said, capable of being “surprised by joy.” Amidst the scramble of this first week, I can feel it!
My vision is focused on the kitchen table issues that Ohioans and their families care about. Bill O’Neill is a loose cannon who callously disrespects women, embarrassing our party and our state. There’s no place for that in this race. #CordrayforOhio
My children think I may have been overdoing the water theme. Enough of the watersheds, Dad! I just have always found it interesting, how a drop becomes a trickle and a flow, and then it GOES somewhere, with a direction and a purpose. Like people and their lives.
Zonked on way home last night, after stopping again in Cleveland and spending time with @CuyahogaCounty Democratic holiday revelers. New chair Shontel Brown is dynamic and engaging. Made up for the first snow I’ve seen this winter!
Sign marked the great divide in Ohio river valleys, as we transitioned between the Lake Erie and Mississippi River watersheds. All the topography seems flattened and inconspicuous when driving a car on the freeway. Bikers have their finger on the pulse!
Stopped by to see new municipal judge-elect @baldwin_judge Won with 66% of the vote - I’ve never done that! Kudos to Jaladah who ran such an effective campaign. Carla’s Mom and Dad were there and understandably proud of her!
Kicked off in Mahoning Valley among great friends: Traficanti, Ditzler, Gaines, Patton, Letson, McNally, Kitchen, and more. Recalled our work together with local officials on the hospital merger, fighting foreclosures, financial education.Greg Hicks of Warren my special champion!
Thank you my great friend! As you said to me the other day, “There’s nothing like a great campaign!” https://t.co/u6jOGALMz0
My Mom liked to say, “Nothing can stop the flow of water.” Think about Cuyahoga County place names, practically bathed in it: bay, river, falls, lake, beach. Others fled to more assuredly dry land - the sixteen or so communities named “Heights” and several named “Hills.”
Engaging the media in Cleveland to talk to the people directly. Very different, though, from what I’m doing here in these tweets. Interesting how the currents of information flow through our society. Should we have in mind “media watersheds?”
Leaving the Scioto River watershed to head north to Cleveland. Soon will crest the “interstate divide” that turns the rivers from flowing south into the Ohio River to flowing north into Lake Erie. Much different path if you ever want to exit the continent in a boat!
@CRAbbrNJCA @RichCordrayOH @CFPB_Gov I will miss @CFPB terribly, but I could feel in my bones over the course of this year that Ohio needed me. So here we go!
@moneyjoev .@moneyjov is right - lead first with your ears, apply your brain, find your voice, share your heart. I have learned that from people all over America, and it is how we intend to do things here - what I call the Ohio way, bringing people together to solve our problems.
Just pulling into Marion for an event with my friend Mary Ellen Withrow who served as Marion County Treasurer, Ohio Treasurer, US Treasurer! Always with me, just the best. Swore me in in 2007 and told the crowd “It’s great to have a Treasurer named Rich!”
Streaking! No, not the Seventies-era craze: How about those Cavs? Won their 13th in a row last night - chasing the Indians magic from just a few months ago. Really turned it around lately. Leadership - LBJ. Inspiring!
Stopping by labor breakfast for consummate public servant @Stinziano. Puts others first. Learned from his Dad, as I did too in the Ohio House. At Plank’s on Parsons, where we always talk about how to stand up strongly for hard-working people and their families!
Can’t head home from Toledo without mourning the algae bloom in Lake Erie. Harming our economy AND our environment! Heard promising ideas today about learning from ongoing work on the Chesapeake Bay. Need state and local government to pull together! #CordrayForOhio
@jerryspringer I agree with @jerryspringer about what Ohio needs in its next governor: a fighter for working families. And that's just what I mean to be.
Even better than your own kitchen table is @tonypackos (Tony Packo’s) in Toledo. Hot Dog! Powerful gathering with Contrada, Gerken, Quilter, Finkbeiner, Hicks-Hudson, Ashford, Ujvagi, and more allies. Great friends! Great partners! https://t.co/oS58C4V0hJ
Deeply stirred by email appeal today from my friend @SenWarren. She recruited me to the Consumer Bureau, recommended me as first Director, backed us through thick and thin. Profile in Courage. Always there for me, and now again! https://t.co/z7uVrZTMfh
@Gracie_Lynne @kiesehansen @smhigg @samdunkle You say Woooo, I say, Woohoo!
Now we enter the Maumee Valley, draining north and east into Lake Erie. Do our children learn about our interesting Ohio watersheds? I learned to love them from Tommy “Two-Trail” Meyer on the “Celeste and Shoe in ‘82” campaign. Like that one, we’ll bring home a winner!

@leighlo14 I am proud and grateful to have your vote, my friend. Now we need to go get more!
@UmangMVarma @Aarondklein Nice of you to call it a “jump shot.” It’s still smooth, but I don’t really jump much these days. Can’t risk injury as we tramp the campaign trail!
Outstanding event - Old Courthouse in Dayton where Lincoln once spoke. Grateful to @RepFredStrahorn and Willis Blackshear and @dennislieberman, titans of the Miami Valley, for their support. Fred leads Ohio House Dems - together we will stop the war on local government! https://t.co/ox8WDxU7M1
Moved over to I-75 to head north. We track the Great Miami River now, which flooded Dayton massively in 1913. In eastern Ohio that same spring, the Muskingum River flooded and my grandma went out the second-floor window in a rowboat!
High-energy event just now. Sparkling young officeholders from @HamiltonCntyOH @PGSittenfeld and @AftabPureval, both endorsed and impressive. Count me in as young at heart, with my friend Steve Driehaus, back now from serving our country in Africa!
Heading to Cincinnati, which brings the beautiful view from high above the Little Miami River. It starts out in Madison County, up by where I live. Nothing about it seems “little,” except as compared with the other one, which we’ll see later today. https://t.co/wa3MP1ifOf
Many people I talk to know the system is broken. It continues to leave countless families to scrape by and work even harder for less economic security. It’s time for a change, and it starts today. https://t.co/vRAX78sSGp
As governor, I'm going to be focused on one thing: getting results for people and families who so often struggle to pay the bills and worry about their finances. That’s my promise, but I can't do it without you. Text OHIO to 228466 to join our campaign. https://t.co/zPb3vBvWtg
@DanielleSWilkin Thanks for your support - I’m excited too, although in my case my wife tells me not to dance in public.
Speaking of the Buckeyes, though, I thought the CFP Committee really blew it. The Big Ten doesn’t get the respect it deserves! We need to root out the SEC bias. Just one more rigged system we don’t need - Boo! #Respect
I’ve been seeing way too much division and conflict around the state and the country. My way is to bring people together to understand and solve problems. That’s the Buckeye Can-Do attitude I know and love!  Let’s work together to find our mojo again. #Unity
@ValerieJarrett Wow, VJ, thanks! You always looked out for me when you were at the White House, and now, you’re still looking out for me as I start this new adventure.
Off and running for governor. Feels good! Like a dog that’s shaken off its muzzle. Much to do for our Great State of Ohio. Join us! #LetsGo! https://t.co/4r62YTOFW3
I’m here at my favorite hometown place - Lilly’s Kitchen Table in Grove City - to announce my candidacy for governor of Ohio. My focus is on the kitchen table issues that people and families face across the state. Bummed if they don’t let me eat anything, though!  #KitchenTable https://t.co/nx7wcN86J2
Good morning! Sometimes not my best time of day if I’ve stayed up too late, but today feels different. It’s a big day, and I’m looking forward to sharing really good news with you shortly. Thx. RC
