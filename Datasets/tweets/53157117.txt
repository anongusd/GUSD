"Promise is a work in progress, but I firmly believe that it is a wonderful tool as long as the right behaviors and the right children are being referred to the program," said Maria Schneider, the prosecutor in charge of the juvenile unit at the Broward State Attorney's Office.
Representatives from across Broward's criminal justice system are delivering impassioned defenses of Promise, praising it as a way to improve graduation rates and help struggling kids.
"Be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater," says Judge Steve Teske, who pioneered reforms in Georgia and supported Broward's work. "Please be careful. Because if you do, don't expect your graduation rates to continue going up. I can tell you that right now."
District officials are currently hosting a public forum on Promise, explaining the background of the program and how it works. They'll take comments after their presentation. But tonight's audience is smaller than the one at the district's last Post-Parkland forum.
Broward schools Superintendent Robert Runcie insists the school district gave the best information it had on Nikolas Cruz's Promise involvement at the time, says there was no intent to mislead https://t.co/nxedin87Zi
Update: In an interview, Runcie says Cruz's disciplinary record was in multiple systems; it took time to comb through them. There was no effort by the district to mislead, he says: "People want as much information as we have... we gave folks the information we had at the time."
How does the district explain this glaring discrepancy? We don't know, because so far they haven't responded to questions about it. Full story: https://t.co/9oTQYjhzgV
But that's not all district the superintendent said. In a March interview, @RobertwRuncie told me Cruz was "never referred" to the program and it "would never have been appropriate for him."

@TimWSternberg @MiamiNewTimes @RobertwRuncie @Nora_Rupert @smtravis @WPLGLocal10 @wfor @maxeden99 Wanted to respond to you here as well. It's definitely not true that we edited the piece to show "a positive bias" toward the superintendent. If you've read the whole story, you know that it includes concerns raised by parents, teachers and others.
@KidzCoach @jessicabakeman @MiamiNewTimes @browardschools I'm not seeing how that relates to the Promise program, but feel free to email me at brittany.shammas@miaminewtimes.com.
@TimWSternberg Your comments may warrant doing another story taking a look inside the program from someone who knows it. You have my number and should know that you are always welcome to give me a call.
@TimWSternberg But if you‚Äôve read the story you know it includes allegations that kids are inappropriately put into Promise and that teachers are facing reporting pressures. These issues seemed to more directly tie in to the current concern over Promise.
@TimWSternberg I appreciated your perspective. But you told me you didn‚Äôt believe Promise played a role in what happened at Stoneman Douglas. Your concerns were mostly w/curriculum, which seemed too narrow to get into in a story about Runcie and controversy swirling around him post Parkland.
@TimWSternberg Hi Tim, did you read the whole story? Definitely not true to say it leaves out the controversy, and I am surprised to hear you call a piece that used 20+ sources fake news.

More here: https://t.co/CLLvgyyxCp /end
And much of the reporting on Broward‚Äôs policy leaves out its nuances ‚Äî as well as its requirement that felony-level infractions require the involvement of law enforcement. /16
So, yes, Obama's administration encouraged policies like Broward‚Äôs. But to characterize it as some radical liberal conspiracy to keep criminals in school misconstrues the background of this policy, as well as the reasons it was enacted. /15
A ‚ÄúDear Colleagues‚Äù letter sent to school districts in 2014 directed them to avoid discriminatory discipline policies and seek alternatives to law enforcement involvement for routine disciplinary issues. /14 https://t.co/ChuCMJN3Hw
The Obama administration indeed praised Broward's efforts and held the district up as a model for the rest of the country. /13 https://t.co/8CeNPWlC92
The agreement notes that some threats, including those that involve discharging a device with intent to do harm, require reporting to law enforcement. This is part of Florida law. /12 https://t.co/uoBc4yB2U6
A "discipline matrix" tells principals how to handle different types of student misbehavior. It dictates that bringing a weapon to school leads to an expulsion, and that serious offenses require consultation with law enforcement (denoted here with AAA):  /11 https://t.co/T9TZSWLvM9
The agreement they reached encouraged principals to deal with misbehavior without arrests when appropriate. BUT it also emphasized that law enforcement would have discretion. And felonies did not qualify. /10 https://t.co/0xRQrwvYnt
The disciplinary policy change, announced in 2013, was intended to correct these problems. Officials across the criminal justice system, from the sheriff‚Äôs office to the state attorney‚Äôs office, were involved in putting it together. /9 https://t.co/XDLg972KkW
The Broward district had plenty of reason to reform its disciplinary policies. In 2011-12, it had the state's highest number of in-school arrests, including for things like spitballs. Black and special needs students were disproportionately affected. /8 https://t.co/8edhYoJoO4 https://t.co/4KNEiAcpJg
A federal bill introduced many times by Congressman Bobby Scott aimed to address this. It had bipartisan support. Portions of the bill would later make it into an Obama-era education law. /7 https://t.co/QfABowjiLj
At the time, there was a movement away from zero-tolerance policies that had caused students to be arrested for small things like swearing or acting out in class. /6
For starters, PROMISE (which the shooter wasn't in, per the superintendent) is only one part of an overhaul of discipline in Broward. The change was inspired partly by legislation passed in 2009 by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by the Republican governor. /5 https://t.co/gGOSN6v51T
But much of the information being circulated about PROMISE is misleading or flat-out wrong. And based on what we know so far, it appears to have little to do with the Parkland shooter. /4
Last week, @marcorubio gave the theory a boost, criticizing PROMISE in a speech on the Senate floor. /3 https://t.co/qEKvRe8us9
This theory seems to have started on an obscure right-wing blog before making its way to Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh and Fox, where pundits have blasted it as a bleeding-heart liberal action pushed by Obama. /2
Over the last week or so, conservatives have taken to blaming a Broward County School District program called PROMISE for the school shooting in Parkland. /1 https://t.co/DyBHNFNKUg
@RJNelson13 And I am a former education reporter who covered the Broward school district, so I think I do know what I‚Äôm talking about. Where exactly did I lie?

@Marc_TR6 state law didn't give them a choice. School boards had to approve a charter application even if they don't have a campus yet
Teachers get 2.5 percent raises, but those at the high school level lose a supplement https://t.co/WbMAgzkuCQ
The school board voted to discontinue the $2,600 supplement, with Freedman and Good dissenting.
One item still remains: Whether to continue giving teachers a $2,600 supplement for teaching a sixth period
Board votes to give 2.51 percent salary increases to some of the district's longest-serving teachers.
"I'd rather cut something than their paycheck," board member Abby Freedman says, to cheers.
"No matter what we give, it'll never be enough to anybody," board member Ann Murray says, to boos. "That‚Äôs just the way it is."
Superintendent Runcie says if the district does not receive sufficient funding in the future, it will start eating away at the fund balance
Board member Patti Good says she was under the impression this would be very difficult to fund. Wants to know what the impact would be
"A budget is choices," @BrowardTeachers attorney says. "And the choice is going to be, do teachers fall high on that scale?"
District says it already had to cut projects that directly impact students, inc. a theater program and hiring more special needs assistants
District says it'd cost about $4.2 to fund what the union wants. Could likely find the money, but is it sustainable?
The question is not whether the district has the money, it's what it will have to cut to provide the raises, school district attorney says
"In a perfect world, you would love to grant these increases, OK," school district attorney says. "But we're not in a perfect world."
"The availability of funds is not the only issue," district attorney says. Board has to take care of students, other staff and community
Siding with the teachers would cost about $13 million, or less than 1 percent of district budget, @BrowardTeachers attorney says.
"Everybody in this world is now an education expert," @BrowardTeachers lawyer tells board. Says lawmakers have wreaked havoc on education.
"I wish every day I had listened to my mother and gone to law school," another teacher says. "Every day."
"I have to tell you that I'm out of faith and I need to see action," Stoneman Douglas High School teacher says
School board Chair Rosalind Osgood says she thinks it's important to allow public comment.
Hearing is starting now. School board attorney says the district recommends the board not accept public comment today. Audience boos.
