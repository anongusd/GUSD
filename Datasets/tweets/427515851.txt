Among the reasons Russia shouldn't be suspected of the Skripal poisoning, Polyanksiy suggests they would have gotten the job done, if they did it : "If we tried to kill him why didn't we kill him? Were these agents newcomers, interns, I don't know?" #Salisbury
"We don't know if they are alive," says Polyanskiy.
Russia complains that it does not have access to Skripal and his daughter -- Russian citizens -- who they are accused to attempting to kill. Polyanskiy says they are worried about them. Says only "physical contact" will ensure Moscow can confirm the whereabouts of the Skripals.
TLDR Russian press conferences: nothing can ever be known.
Polyanskiy complains that the UK has "launched an unprecedented anti-Russia campaign." Says British journalists "don't want to delve into the numerous inconsistencies..."
Polyanskiy says he is concerned because Russia doesn't know where Skripal and his daughter are... suggests the UK is detaining them by force.
"We still don't know who did it, why and how," says Deputy Permanent Representative Dmitry Polyanskiy. cc: @EliotHiggins

Votel's first line here is even more confusing. He says the US has A database, and has the ability to "see" the Saudi database. Are these two separate things?

BREAKING: The Saudis and Emiratis owe the US $331 million for refueling services related to operations in Yemen that they never paid for. The Pentagon has divulged this to the Senate a week after @rgoodlaw and I revealed the problem in @TheAtlantic: https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO
@ishaantharoor do they not have away jersey or something how can they both play in red?
Though the Senate Yemen vote is obviously a "blow" to the Saudis/Trump etc. (support will continue), it is equally if not more important as a sign of Congress potentially re-asserting itself on oversight of US military ops, in this case one operating in a liminal statutory space.
The US support operations that the Senate just voted to cut off for the Saudis/UAE in Yemen haven't been properly tracked by DoD and as @rgoodlaw and I revealed, there's NEVER been official notification to Congress of a servicing agreement with the Saudis. https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO

The Yemen support package in a nutshell: https://t.co/6fL8yLrkPq		https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO
In other words, because the Saudis didn't do whatever internal procedures they were meant to under an ACSA agreement with the US, the arrangement remained provisional up until today. Fuel was delivered for years, 1,000s of civilians died, and Congress never was notified.
The Pentagon confirms that, to this date, Congress has never been informed of an ACSA with the Saudis. For the first year, there was no ACSA at all. After that, Congress was never notified of the provisional ACSA because KSA didn't fulfill "all of its internal procedures."
Congress is supposed to be informed of all ACSAs that are put in place with other countries. I can't find anyone who remembers notification for the 2006 UAE ACSA, but it may be out there.
Here is the 2006 UAE ACSA: https://t.co/golQ4CB3rt		Here is the May 2016 Saudi ACSA (note that's a year into the war, see the piece for why that's important): https://t.co/pARSwQ3lRI
I'll post a few relevant documents here, which have been published (widely, at least) from what I can tell. 		Here is the Pentagon's response from last week that formed the basis for our story: https://t.co/2EZBiBfV5d
The Government Accountability Office is expected to issue a report next year on the use of ACSAs. There may be a lot more to this story.
Ultimately one of the things this comes down to is Congress' ability and willingness to exert oversight over US military activities existing on the margins of what's been authorized by Congress. In this case, the use of ACSAs made scrutiny even harder. 		https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO
It turns out that wasn't a bad decision - though it was a bad outcome - because to this date, the Pentagon hasn't resolved "errors in accounting were DoD failed to charge the [Saudi led Coalition] for fuel and refueling services," as they told the Senate. https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO

For the first year of the campaign, the US military now indicates it sold fuel to the Saudis via the UAE. That third-party use is currently banned as of the last NDAA. And it's unclear if they formed this explanation only when they realized they had no servicing agreement w/ KSA.
Not only could they not answer what they were owed, but it's not clear they've been able to track what was given to the Saudis and Emiratis -- we knew they didn't track missions -- or even what they were paid for the fuel -- which they must be under law.		https://t.co/dpqpOSTgLO

@ifthedevilisix @JettGoldsmith I'll catch up on this when I'm not travelling. I follow accounts for various reasons, I may have followed this one a long time ago -- no idea. I can't even read the tweets in your thread that led to this. All I saw was someone liked a tweet I was tagged in. Confused.
@ifthedevilisix I don't know you or the account I evidently follow. I follow thousands of people. People who make fun of victims of the Syrian war can go to hell.
@ifthedevilisix I don't follow you -- the only notification I got was someone I do liking that tweet. I hit like for a second. Lay off. Pick your battles, dude.

From 2002-2018 the US spent on average more than $1.5 million PER DAY on anti-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan. 		Last year poppy cultivation was 4x what it was in 2002, according to the UN. 		"Counternarcotics seems to have fallen completely off the U.S. agenda."
Severe drought has displaced 275,000 people this year.
Through the end of August, there have been 56 insider attacks on Afghan national security forces, leaving at least 85 dead and 36 wounded.
Afghan national security forces are at their lowest levels since 2012. ANDSF is around 40,000 personnel -- 11% of their target strength of 352,000.
Corruption:		- DOJ says Afghanistan's attorney general is "deficient," fails to cooperate on anti-corruption.	- Anti-corruption center goes after low level cases	- Officials want less transparency -- not more
The UN mission in Afghanistan recorded record numbers of civilian casualties (313 deaths and 336 injuries) due to aerial operations by pro-government forces in the first 9 months of this year.
Afghan government control or influence of districts (55.5%) in the country is at its lowest level since @SIGARHQ began monitoring in 2015.
Going to tweet out some elements of the latest @SIGARHQ report on Afghanistan, 17 years into the war. TL;DR: it's not going well. 		You can read it the quarterly report in its entirety here: 		https://t.co/ESGyRdclyv

There is definitely a different tenor to UN statements. People are dying, will die in far greater numbers. 		But think about it in simple terms: You haven't had enough food for any sustainable spell in two years or more. What is your health like?
I think it's important to be clear - and it can be lost in some of the metrics used to measure humanitarian need:		Yemenis are dying from lack of food every day, wasting away. It doesn't always matter what they technically perish from. Lack of food puts them on death's door.

Lowcock notes that Gulf funders - led by UAE - have led aid financing in Yemen.		They are also fighting to capture Hodeidah, Yemen's largest port.
UN aid chief Mark Lowcock telling the Security Council that up to 14 million in #Yemen are hurtling towards famine (to most their current conditions likely would appear beyond "pre-famine" conditions, as the UN terms it).

The point is -- it's complicated. Arms sales alone don't measure the position of an American President. But they also can't entirely be negated by the personal views and bilateral vibes of the Prez and their staff.
