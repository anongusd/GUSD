Some context: A September 2017 DHS report found “the southwest land border is more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before” https://t.co/WAddw9iiBw
This doesn’t sound like the beginning of a bipartisan overture: “I would like to see major immigration reform … we have a real problem, we have catch and release … you have chain migration, where a bad person comes in … and then you have the lottery, it’s a horror show”
This makes the $8 billion funding demand sound completely arbitrary: “Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall.”
Did Trump just argue a wall would allow him to cut funding for Border Patrol agents? “We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row”
Mulvaney this morning on whether the emergency creates “a dangerous precedent”: “It actually creates zero precedent. This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”
A senior admin official told reporters this morning that only the $3.6 billion under 10 USC 2808 requires the national emergency. The White House is hedging its bets – if that money gets blocked by a court, they’re also trying reprogramming (10 USC 284) and treasury funds
Trump seeks roughly $8 billion for a border wall, per Mulvaney:		$3.6 billion via 10 USC 2808 (tied to nat’l emergency)	$2.5 billion via 10 USC 284 (DOD money moved to counter-drug fund)	$1.4 billion (FY18 funding bill)	$600 million (money from the Treasury forfeiture fund)

The idea that Vitiello (a Border Patrol official) could be tapped to run ICE might seem a little odd. But his time in leadership during the Obama admin (he served as BP deputy chief from 2010-2016) could boost odds of confirmation
News in @ProMorningShift: the White House has considered acting CBP Deputy Commissioner Ron Vitiello to replace Homan at ICE, per an admin official https://t.co/CDkSIpaoV3
From the admin official in @ProMorningShift: “The reality is some of these problems [the secretary] can’t fix. … It can’t be done by the executive branch. It has to be done by Congress” https://t.co/CDkSIpaoV3
An administration official told @ProMorningShift Nielsen “[has] been under tremendous pressure to deliver” and that a confrontation with Trump had been anticipated for several weeks https://t.co/CDkSIpaoV3
Meanwhile, ICE’s Tom Homan plans to retire in June. Peter Edge, acting deputy, also hopes to retire in the near future, a former DHS official told me earlier this month.
The most interesting/startling part of Nielsen’s near-departure: her deputy Elaine Duke resigned in April, which means the #1 and #2 slots at DHS would be filled by acting officials. And a Trump-aligned nominee for either job won’t have an easy road to confirmation

From @AndrewRestuccia and @seungminkim: roughly 100 of Trump’s nominees have been kicked back to the White House https://t.co/HiKdjewDLP
I'm not sure if it's been published @jbreisblatt but Tom Homan was carried over to 2018. So was John Mitnick for DHS general counsel.
@jbreisblatt The Senate needs unanimous consent to carry the nomination over, so I think a single senator could have blocked https://t.co/zDUR13DGTt https://t.co/531wdHb47N
Kevin McAleenan's CBP nomination will be worth watching. He was an Obama holdover with strong bipartisan support, but his nomination sat dormant for eight months. He cleared the Finance Committee earlier this month https://t.co/JyEBnANv4b
The Senate DIDN'T confirm acting CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. That means the White House will need to renominate him in 2018 https://t.co/JyEBnANv4b

@deanzenga Maybe... as Kelly also pointed out at the hearing, he watched people hopping the wall on a trip to the border

That's a wrap for the Kelly hearing. Both Johnson and McCaskill seem sold and the latter called him a moderating force in the Trump admin
@_mariocarrillo_ I think that's fair to say. Not a surprise, but he's deferring to Trump's team on policy questions
A common refrain Kelly heard from Border Patrol agents: "We ought to be allowed to do our job”
Kelly on stability in the Northern Triangle: "It’s really improving the security on the ground and investment"
Kelly didn't give a resolute answer on DACA. He spoke about prioritizing removals but also said “the law will guide me”
Kelly on DACA: “I would guess that this category might not be the highest priority for removal”
Kamala Harris asks Kelly the first question about DACA
“I can’t guarantee 100 percent," Kelly says in regards to vetting refugees. He continued: "I guess you do the best you can”
McCaskill points out an obvious problem with the border wall: many people arriving surrender to Border Patrol
Kelly stresses the importance of Latin America in border strategy: "Defense of the southwest border really starts 1,500 miles south"
Of the opioid crisis, Kelly says it's a “huge problem, getting worse” and that production takes place in the Americas
