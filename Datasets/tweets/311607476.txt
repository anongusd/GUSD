@kubeczka_mark @TomGranzzz @AB84 Actually, statistically, the offense has been as good or better without him. He misses a lot of games. They are used to playing without him. Ben, Brown, Bryant, Juju and others are more than above-average without him.
@kubeczka_mark @TomGranzzz @AB84 All I'm saying is closer to 14 is reasonable. 18 is not.
