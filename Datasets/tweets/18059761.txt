@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 Also sitemap can sometimes be counted as equal signal for indexing.. use robots and disable sitemap. üòÅüëçüòé
@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 I found 8 signals outside of robots.txt Google could have used to index that page. üëçü§îüôèüòÅ
@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 I've only been doing SEO for 25 years.. most of what I know isn't documented or it will be exploited. Cc: @Mattci
@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 Use robots.txt and meta robots directives.. both.. give Google more of a signal.
@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 In my brain.. building over 10000 websites.. installing Apache.. etc.. IF Google gets the same signal 100000 times (WordPress default) it WILL find another way to index the website. Example: firewalled staging sites? sent to a Gmail account WILL BE indexed REGARDLESS OF ROBOTS
@jennyhalasz @JohnMu @portentint @sejournal @RoryT11 If.. the robots.txt is a blanket directive.. i.e. disallow: / then Google will use other signals.

if robots.txt contains blanket directive ERROR.
