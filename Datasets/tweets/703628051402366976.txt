@MorningGloryxo @rebelliousMax0 @RashidaTlaib Saying the pledge in Arabic has no different meaning than saying it in English. Why would they change every other word to the Arabic version but keep the English word for God? Arabic speaking Christians use the word Allah too.

@Taehyung1996 @bpla24 @colorcolorfan Yes, getting upset when someone you don't know finds happiness in life with someone who isn't you makes you selfish. I have my idol crushes too, from both girl and boy groups. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm ever going to be with one of them. I'll likely never even meet one.
@Taehyung1996 @bpla24 @colorcolorfan I don't see how an idol going on a date ruins that fantasy. I like kpop because I like the music and I like the idols personalities. Nothing about them dating or even them getting married and starting a family ruins that for me. I don't get why so many fans are selfish bastards
@Taehyung1996 @bpla24 @colorcolorfan Nobody said it's the only thing that makes them happy. But if they're dating, it would be because it makes them happy. If the fans aren't ok with that, the fans can go fuck themselves
@Taehyung1996 @bpla24 @colorcolorfan If fans don't want their idols to be happy, then they aren't fans at all
@Taehyung1996 @bpla24 @colorcolorfan They are just people. A lot more is expected of them than the average person but they should still be free to date whoever the hell they want. What's more, Jennie and Kai shouldn't have had what little privacy they have left violated like they did.

@WillJacoby007 @SteveKingIA You could of course argue that closest the war ever got to a fight for freedom was the Arab revolt against the Ottomans, but the allies really didn't care one way or the other if the Arabs were able to gain their freedom. They simply enjoyed having allies distracting the Ottomans
@WillJacoby007 @SteveKingIA WW1 was just one group of allies vs a separate group of allies. By and large, it wasn't some great struggle for freedom like WW2 was. In fact, the penalties forced on the losing nations at the end of the war did practically nothing to preserve freedom throughout the world

@Headless_Hunt @g_masc89 @OsborneInk What I know is that, regardless of personal reasons for fighting, they fought for a country that was founded for the express purpose of maintaining slavery. So to be quite fucking honest, I'm glad so many of them are rotting in unmarked mass graves. It's better than they deserve
@eccentricdrunk lol
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk The same people who put up those statues created those voting laws knowing full well that they would harm African Americans more than anyone else
@eccentricdrunk I'm not really that selective. Some people get monuments because they defended slavery. Some people get monuments for other things and they also happened to defend slavery. The first set of monuments includes confederate soldiers, generals, and politicians and they shouldnt exist
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk Sure if they were wealthy enough to afford to poll tax, and educated enough to pass the literacy tests, and brave enough to vote in defiance of the people who sat at polling places specifically to intimidate African Americans trying to vote. Sure, other than that, they could vote
@eccentricdrunk McClellan gained his fame by being a sub par union general and a failed presidential candidate, not for fighting to the death to maintain slavery. We can't always apply our morals to historical figures, I have no problem with statues of Jefferson, but sometimes evil is just evil
@eccentricdrunk At worst, a confederate soldier was a brutal slaveowner who was willing to kill to maintain that. At best, a confederate soldier was a poor person who, regardless of his personal reasons for fighting, fought for a country that was expressly founded to maintain slavery
@eccentricdrunk All confederate soldiers fought to preserve slavery by the very fact that they were confederate soldiers. The only confederate who may deserve a statue is John Tyler, and that's only because he was famous for being president, not for being a confederate
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk And the fact that these statues primarily went up as African Americans were fighting for their right to vote was pure coincidence I'm sure
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk Oh yeah, putting statues of African Americans former owners right next to the centers of Justice in counties with high populations of African Americans absolutely wasn't intended to send a message to anyone.
@eccentricdrunk Sure, he's not famous for fighting to preserve slavery or for enslaving people
@Aspyre_FGC @g_masc89 @OsborneInk This is more like if statues of Nazi SS were created by neo Nazis in the 90s and placed in Jewish communities. Oops sorry, we can't get rid of them because they're history
@Headless_Hunt @g_masc89 @OsborneInk I mean, I'm talking about my opinion. Pretty sure I have a good grasp on what my opinion is. I even consulted myself to make it
@Aspyre_FGC @g_masc89 @OsborneInk That's the dumbest fucking comparison
@eccentricdrunk And?
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk The only way the message from the white supremacists could have been less subtle was if they bought huge banners saying "Hey, we pretty much still own you" instead of the statues
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk Those statues were built to glorify the Confederacy while also being a convenient way to intimidate the African Americans living in those communities. There's a reason so many of the statues were placed outside of courthouses, and it wasn't to honor fallen soldiers
@PanOfSeamen @OsborneInk Not monuments that were built specifically to distort history
@madfishmonger The pupper was demanding food
@SilverScarCat @OsborneInk There's always dumb fucks. No amount of available education will help those who don't want to learn in the first place. For example, some people still think confederates were the good guys. I'm sure the statues of confederate generals in heroic poses have nothing to do with that
@mooneymama1 @DrShaena @UNC Many of the statues are outside of southern courthouses. And the reason those locations were chosen is because the justice system in those counties were controlled by well off white people who wanted to remind the African Americans that it was controlled by well off white people
@mooneymama1 @DrShaena @UNC Museums are for remembering. Monuments are for glorifying. Monuments to confederate soldiers literally put people who fought to defend slavery by waging war against their fellow Americans on pedestals and make them seem like they were fighting for a righteous cause

@_jacketchan_ @OsborneInk Most confederate statues were created decades after the fall of the Confederacy. Created specifically to try and make the confederates look better than they actually were and instill fear in local African American populations

@LeftyLieBuster @OsborneInk lol, it's not exactly a well guarded secret that the confederates were democrats. Statues glorifying slave ownership or fighting for slavery don't deserve to be anywhere except a museum. And since the people running this University were never going to do that, I say good riddance
@_jacketchan_ @OsborneInk Silent Sam was intentionally created to distort history by depicting confederate soldiers as noble soldiers fighting for a patriotic and righteous cause
@wthisagigawatt @OsborneInk "We can take a joke" says the person who just admitted to never laughing at jokes
@realDonaldTardo @the_moodyfoodie @Michael09162399 @OsborneInk Sure it was. If they didn't want to fight to preserve slavery, they shouldn't have fought to preserve slavery
@Michael09162399 @OsborneInk "Calhoun?" Really? That's not even a clever name for someone trolling as a white supremacist
@g_masc89 @OsborneInk Confederate soldiers don't deserve monuments.
@chestnut2171 @DougHeye At Silent Sam's dedication ceremony, Julian Carr praised confederate soldiers for their patriotism and bragged about how he "horse whipped a negro wench". You really think the goal of the statue was to make sure we never went back to that way of life?
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper And if the average confederate soldier was too dumb to realize that, then that's their problem not ours
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper The states that have these statues are generally the same ones who teach in their schools that prominent confederates were heroes fighting for some righteous cause when in reality they were fighting to maintain the institution of slavery.
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper Mostly done after reconstruction after white supremacists felt emboldened by the Jim Crow laws
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper Except they didn't put the statues up until 40-50 years after the war
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper Oh good, we agree that confederate soldiers don't deserve monuments in public places
@chestnut2171 @DougHeye Yeah, because glorifying slave owners by putting their images on literal pedestals is the best way to say "Don't be like these guys"
@SeabassSaid @DougHeye @jaketapper Confederate statues were designed to glorify the actions of the people they depict. They were not created to be an educational resource

@TheTattooedProf Hey, any WW1 historians you can recommend? I've recently been feeling the urge to read up on it.

@JimmyWhetzel Honestly it wouldn't even need to be a sequel. There are countless Avatars so they can go back as far as they want
@JeremyECrawford My barbarian once got feebleminded right before a player's new character arrived, which led to the barbarian attacking him and cutting off his arm. So the only time the swords ability to cut off a limb ever worked was against another party member
@senatormcdaniel It's not like FDR was an infallible deity. He did some good things and he also did some of the most horribly racist things in our nation's history.
@RobinBurkhalte1 @randy_fogle @GrayCherylG @senatormcdaniel That's like saying Germany took up arms in WW2 because Poland wouldn't give them their land back.
@RobinBurkhalte1 @Mdarbyreid @senatormcdaniel Secession isn't legally allowed under the US Constitution. So, not really
@senatormcdaniel The Robert E Lee post isn't a liberal vs conservative issue. What you posted is just categorically false
@senatormcdaniel You should start with historical accuracy before you start worrying about political correctness
@TheTattooedProf @RitaBeanz @MalcolmNance Yeah, there's famous stories (at least locally, I don't know how widely known it is outside of the area) about a union regiment from the Eastern shore of Maryland burying friends and family that had fought for the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg
@TheTattooedProf @RitaBeanz @MalcolmNance Thanks for the response. I live in Maryland, which to me, has always felt like it is in a neverending identity crisis of whether it's northern or southern.
@calysway @TheTattooedProf @senatormcdaniel I guess talented would have been the better term
@TheTattooedProf @RitaBeanz @MalcolmNance Is there an estimate of what percentage of poor whites living in the south supported slavery. I would think that a sizable portion just didn't care one way or the other.
@calysway @TheTattooedProf @senatormcdaniel Honestly I think Sherman was the most gifted general of the whole war

@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 And?
@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 I mean I only know him as the short guy with the annoying face that is on the news sometimes when I'm flipping through the channels. So yeah, to me he's a random person whose existence isn't worth noticing
@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 You realize there is a major election just months away. It makes no sense to focus on a random person who has nothing to do with her instead of focusing on her opponents.
@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 Respect is irrelevant. He's a public figure who has no connection to her and lives on the opposite side of the country. He can demand whatever he likes. She doesn't have to agree to anything

@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 Ben absolutely falls into that category. Unless he wants to move to her district and run against her, she should feel no obligation to interact with him at all.
@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 And the point I was trying to make is that debates are by and large worthless. Everyone already knows everyone else's opinion. Putting them on a literal stage and having them regurgitate those opinions won't change anyone's mind
@RoyAllWind @Jaredmstanley @Ocasio2018 If she was refusing to debate her political opponent, maybe you'd have a point. If politicians stopped to argue with every random person who demanded a debate, they would never do anything else

@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder And honestly as more and more of the country moves to cities, we'll see likely see the electoral college override the will of the people by even more outrageous percentages until it gets to a point where it's statistically impossible for republicans lose a presidential election
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder And the fact that conservatives ALWAYS benefit when the EC vote is different from the popular vote has absolutely no bearing on your opinion here?
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder Oh, you must be an Alex Jones fan
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder Getting rid of the electoral college isn't going to stop republicans from winning the popular vote. They've done it many times before. If New York and California control who wins the popular vote like you claim, the republicans would never get a majority of votes
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder And having it where a majority of the population determines who becomes president is not the same as getting rid of the rights of the minority
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder Votes in red and blue states already don't matter regardless of their size
@Lauralyliberali @TeeSmitty @MikeChaffee @TonyReeder There were plenty of things that were put in our constitution and then changed years and years later once people realized that our founders weren't infallible.

@ConceptHut @LucyDEire It would be baffling and out of place in the trailer because nothing from previous LoU content set up any of the characters as furries. Everyone knows that Ellie is a lesbian. People who were angered by the trailer were angry because they dared to show Ellie being... Ellie
@5kyLegend @Haedox @Hamlock1998 I mean Ellie isn't 14 anymore. It only makes sense that since she's older and in a community with a lot of other people, she'd eventually start being attracted to someone
@ConceptHut @LucyDEire And I'm pointing out how bizarre that situation would be. I mean, I can't guarantee that none of the LoU characters are furries but we've certainly never found out that any of them are. Creating two random furry characters and make them the centerpiece of e3 would be baffling

@Miamifanx23 @TheOnion @SteveKerr I see on the map that Hillary won more of the American population. It doesn't mean a damn thing to me that that population is mostly in cities
@Miamifanx23 @TheOnion @SteveKerr The electoral college was put in place so slaves would count towards the influence of low population southern states without giving them any say in the matter.

@ReneJFerranJr @Dodadaz1 @keithboykin The people involved matter as much as if not more than what they're saying. A white man calling a black man the n word isn't nearly the same thing as a black man saying it to another black man. Same for the c word. A man calling a woman the c word is different than 2 women

@570_ed @NatResources @TruthSoldierz @FLGovScott The only real requirements are a constitution and a high enough population. After that, all it really takes is congress approving statehood
@themikeymoyer @Ravens @JoeFlacco I'll take a wobbly completion over a spiral that doesn't make it to the receiver
@JoshuAllenMason @Ravens Joe's gone even if he gets us a super bowl this year. He's burned the Ravens too many times

@AnnaProsser @HollyConrad @QuandtumTheory @JimmyWhetzel @twittysuch He is! He's also a good guard dog. He always barks to let us know when the neighbors are doing something awful, like getting home from work or taking out the trash

@pshark47 @ACLU A miscarriage shouldn't be one of them
@MelissaStout12 @ACLU The problem isn't necessarily the fact that they're being detained, it's the way that they've been treated while detained
@DavidMoon2014 @andreathekline @VAtterbeary @Willcsmithjr @krassenstein That is absolutely insane.
@Scotttaylorva @USATODAY I know. My point is that even voluntary buyback programs have sizable numbers of people who are against them and it doesn't make much sense to me. Sorry if I was unclear
@Scotttaylorva @USATODAY I don't understand why some people are still so against a voluntary buyback program. Obviously it shouldn't be forced
@HollyConrad @AnnaProsser @QuandtumTheory @JimmyWhetzel @twittysuch My dog. His name is Cutter https://t.co/tWfnJIZPBQ
@MarkDice If Trump wasn't a cunt, I might actually give a shit about his policies. Until he learns how to be a decent human being, his policies are irrelevant to me liking or disliking him

@RepSwalwell They didn't just refuse to investigate Nixon because he happened to be president during the cold war. Why should it be any different here?
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Obama said Merry Christmas every year, you assclown
@V8dman @sesg13 @FoxNews @Judgenap @realDonaldTrump Sorry, Trump's a cunt. And as long as the word cunt accurately describes him, it doesn't matter what his actual policies are. He doesn't deserve support
@evepeyser She showed him exactly as much respect as he deserves
@realDonaldTrump is a cunt. Just realized it's been a while since I said it
@4SolOrion @glaad Yes, you're obviously an independent free thinker. That's why I see opinions that are practically identical to yours pretty much every day
@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to seeing you throw more paper towels
@rbshoemaker @anioti @steveberg1946 Yes, these ancient Iraqi artifacts that have nothing to do with Christianity do not belong in an American museum about the Bible.
@Ri0tClanOfficia @WilGafney Ah, they bought stolen goods. Big difference
@rbshoemaker @anioti @steveberg1946 I don't think Hobby Lobby's bible museum is what Indy was referring to when he said things belonged in a museum

@pennaheel @ChelseaClinton And I think Trump's a cunt but I'm not going to tell that to Barron
@annepearl1 @MetroIssues @Bigron1987 @samvega @RBReich She was appealing to her base like every other presidential candidate in history
@leonard0534 @BV Yeah, conservatives sucked back then like they suck now
@dslundberg @JohnDingell Agreed, and if the reason for his dismissal was that they no longer thought the job was appropriate, I wouldn't have a problem with it. Unfortunately, that's not why he was fired
@IAMNOTABRAND @LOLGOP I don't think most Trump voters are racist. I just think most Trump voters don't consider racism to be a disqualifying attribute in a presidential candidate
@Courtland_Esq @jeffzeleny @realDonaldTrump I guess. I'm just trying to say that if we colonized part of Mars, we wouldn't legally be able to use military force to prevent another nation from colonizing another part of Mars
@Courtland_Esq @jeffzeleny @realDonaldTrump Space belongs to all nations. We've signed treaties that say as much
@veryfrank10 @JenniferJJacobs No, space shouldn't belong to any one nation

@AFIChai @realHeatherD @fawfulfan @netanyahu The Israeli people want peace, the Israeli government is a different story
@wmmceachern @MotherJones If that was true, they would be tried in criminal court. They aren't
@mikeymellow @Gene_G1960 That was my view going into 2016. I now regret it. Now I will vote for who I think can do the most good, and in my opinion, beating Trump IS doing the most good

@rioohipp_ @dog_rates I would give them all so many hugs
@realHeatherD @fawfulfan @netanyahu I think both groups of people are led by asswholes. But yeah the Palestinian people are definitely worse off than the Israeli people
@netanyahu Nice PowerPoint presentation
@fawfulfan @netanyahu I don't know why anyone would listen to him anyway. I don't understand why America continues to let him do whatever he wants. I feel bad for the average citizens of Israel
@KahunaDan @sahluwal Jimmy Carter didn't have a very good presidency (not entirely his fault) but having Trump in office has made me realize that I'll take a good human being over good policy any day. Of course I don't think Trump is a good human and I don't think he has good policies

@BradTaergeron @NOgechukwu @thurnuz @globeandmail The punishment should happen because people are assholes, not because people are assholes and some of them happen to be black
@CEOEnterpriseNX @globeandmail Yes, if they were truly having a problem with dine and dashers, they should have just made pre paying the policy for all customers
@greenrascal_ @globeandmail I don't care who was dine and dashing. If that was a common problem, they should have made all customers pay up front, not just one race
@Titaniam1 @globeandmail But this restaurant didn't ask everyone to pay before they got their food, only the black customers
@CEOEnterpriseNX @globeandmail The issue here is that only black people were being asked to pre pay
@vidrick @globeandmail If that lawyer only charged black clients a retainer, then yes there should be some sort of penalty
@asevig @globeandmail If the restaurant was having a problem with that, they should have made pre paying the policy for all customers, not just one race
@thurnuz @globeandmail If that was true, they should have made pre paying the policy for all customers instead of just black people
@JohnCronan1 @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump If people cared about values and respect anymore, Trump wouldn't be president right now

@BeSpotted @DSky3 This is what happens when the right demands for years that the left stops being PC. We actually give them what they want
@TomMillze They wanted people to stop being PC. We're just giving them what they wanted
@Paige_Bama22 @ashbygourmand @IngrahamAngle I'll take a good human being over a good president any day. Trump isn't either of those things
@blackvenom1226 @houlihan79 @cmclymer @mtcarkeys It doesn't matter what she actually does. Her job title is "Senior advisor to the president". My point still stands, she's not just the president's daughter
@DisabledUSN_Vet @Ravens @Browns And then he chose to stay in Baltimore for more than 20 years. That was his choice, not Modell's
@NizamWalter @Ravens Yes he can. And he probably will
