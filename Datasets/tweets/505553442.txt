To me that caused me some PTSD?!	Wtf is wrong with men and women who defend this POS?! #GOP #KavanaughConfirmation
I am so sick of men defending a sexual assaliant. I was assaulted 3 times in my life and I have been 100% truthful on all accounts and it's like no one believes me. The most traumatic experience was when in was 7 years Old. Why the Fuck would I lie about something that happened
@morriscummins2 @FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump Women if we tell the truth are publicly shamed and slammed on everything we do to our sex life and home life. Publicly on the stand. Until you might know what that feels like to be accused of lying shut the fuck up.
@morriscummins2 @FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump Often to women and we do NOT ask for it. Please pray for yourself and have some compassion and stop defending this jackass that has put on a public tantrum. If you were really innocent you wouldn't whine like a child. Truth hurts
@morriscummins2 @FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump I can't remember the month or day of the week it happened but where I was and now it happened 25 years ago to the day. I was 7. I was a scared embarrassed child. I neber said anything about it publicly to anyone but my mom. I'm sorry you don't believe her but this happens too
@morriscummins2 @FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump I didn't come forward then because I was a kid and I was scared and embarrassed it took me over 25 years to have the courage to speak about it. It happened in real life. Women won't lie left and right so stop that BS #metoo
@morriscummins2 @FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump She was not lying period. I'm a person that can tell ASAP if someone is lying and she was 100% truthful in her account. Her specific details were enough for me. I also was sexually assaulted on more than one occasion and it the first account happened to me at 7 yrs old.
@FrascaMichel @BeHappyandCivil @realDonaldTrump Really do you understand why women don't come foward sooner in life?! Open your tiny ass brain and think about it. I was sexually assaulted at 7 YEARS OLD. It took me over 25 YEARS TO FINALLY TALK ABOUT IT. Have some fucking compassion, my god!

@tomofromearth 99% of the time people buy cats dogs or bunnies and don't do the research into what it takes to take care of them. More and more people need to educate them. We try to do that at the shelter so they know all it takes to care for the animal.
@tomofromearth In the last 6 months we have gotten and taken in 5 rabbits that were dumped into the wild or onto the street to fend for themselves. More people need to adopt and not shop. Goes for cats and dogs too. Bunnies are the highest dumped animals over cats and dogs and it's sad 😔

Would be a good thing for police to monitor for illegal activity and for violating their welfare benefits. I don't think they should be punished (no one can help being homeless) but for a social worker to come out and assist the issue. @realDonaldTrump
Again I support welfare and social security but it's wrong for some people to break these systems and work them they need to be federally punished for that. I think people who survive off welfare need to report what they bought each week to the govt that they bought these items.
Should be treated the same way through a smart online system. With employees monitoring the questions each customer reports. I don't understand why it's such a archaic process with welfare. #changewelfare
Care about people breaking the system. You know what? Unemployment through its new system which were you have to report every week that you applied for jobs it's so smart now that it won't give you the unemployment if it finds out you got extra income you didn't report. Welfare
As a libertarian I don't see how monitoring welfare is such a bad thing so many people break the system it's terrible. People buy drugs buy insane things like lobster with a EBT card buy things they could not ever afford with it. And they get away with it. Why is it so wrong to

@JaredLeto @30SECONDSTOMARS #MarsAmerica https://t.co/uQiWUqcXQR
America to me means racism is gone, people get along and agree to disagree politically. America to me is unity instead of division, understanding and love. America to me is able to access birth control #mybodymyrights America to me is making love and not war #MarsAmerica ❤️🇺🇸
As a 💁🏻 America to me means equal pay. America to me means equality and rights for the LGBTQ community 🏳️‍🌈. America to me means access to a gun for protection only and assault rifles not in kids hands, the age limit to 21 with gunsafety classes &amp; bckgrnd checks #MarsAmerica
@JaredLeto @30SECONDSTOMARS Can't wait to see you again it's been way too long! It's been about 5 years since we last saw you play with @ChesterBe #Ripchester @linkinpark ❤️ see you in Mansfield in June! #MonolithTour

@LoganPaul That I called myself a worthless existence. I was planning to end my life via a horrific car crash. I chose finally not to and get some help. Please think about going forward how others may react to a video like this. For some and many it can trigger them.
@LoganPaul Logan I was suicidal 10 years ago in September. I want To make you aware of how numb people feel before they choose to end their life. I didn't eat for two weeks. When I went to class I couldn't physically look anyone in the eye. I cried all the time. I was so sick of myself
Let's see this executive order @realDonaldTrump take action for veterans I want to see it. I want to see the number of veteran suicides decrease. We cannot keep this suicide rate go any higher. We must fight for our patriots who fought for this country to keep it free 💯🇺🇸
My mom and I who were classic democrats agreeed that we Are on the same page politically there are a small percentage of things we approve of trump doing to fix this country. One major thing is immigration. @realDonaldTrump I told her I think she's secretly a libertarian 💯🇺🇸
When people use me for their happy moments and take credit is what I can't stand. If it wasn't for me you would have never have met this person. #SorryNotSorry

I lost a good friend a online friend 3 years ago to suicide the fact no one understands is maddening. @ATRhq @philthatremains it's sad..
It's sad how people who hold such a stigma against depression and PTSD that suicide is a selfish act. No it's not. U don't understand
It's sad how suicidal ppl feel so lost so empty and don't have money for healthcare they feel like they're crying for help and no 1 listens
I care about the poor and unfortunate so much. I care about the individual I care about our constitution. I'm proud to be a Libertarian. 🇺🇸💯
Healthcare right now is ridiculous Obamacare has its benefits but it doesn't cover mental illness most of the time. It has to change now.
&amp;turns &amp;there is nothing I can do bc the VA system is fucked. As a libertarian Iwant2change this. This istruly #madness @philthatremains
A veteran for over a year and we've been together longer. He has moments where he's lost and I can't help him he has nightmares he tosses
As a true Libertarian I believe in taking care of our veterans first as well as the individual. I'm proud to say I have been engaged to
No one understands depression PTSD or suicidal thoughts gets it so no one funds into MORE care to HELP people who feel suicidal it's SAD!
Battling what some people who do not know about #mentalillness every day they can't sleep at night due to flashbacks &amp; bc there is a stimga
Our veterans. They come first they protect this country. They deserve to come before anyone else. They shouldn't have to be poor on the sts
There needs to be a special law put in place the VA system is fucked we need a manidated federal law that allows affordable health care for
I think if we are stuck with @realDonaldTrump as president then we need to address the major problem of #PTSD resulting in #VetSuicide

@tomofromearth @GodseyNicole Oh if you say no that's what I meant no is know whoever wants to take pics needs to talk to your people that's what I meant
@tomofromearth @GodseyNicole Yeah if you guys say No or the venue says no then it's just no for professional cameras simple as that no is no no is never yes lol
