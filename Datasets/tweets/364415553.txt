If the Trump Administration can afford a $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires, billionaires and wealthy corporations, then it can certainly afford a modest and hard-earned pay bump for the women and men who honorably serve our country.
By effectively reducing federal pay, the President will hamper efforts to retain and attract talented and qualified candidates to fill the ranks of America‚Äôs civil service.

"The first vigil, organized by the First Presbyterian Church of Annapolis, will begin at 7:00 PM at the Westfield Annapolis Mall parking lot in front of Pottery Barn (2370 Annapolis Mall Rd, Annapolis, MD 21401).
‚ÄúIf anyone would like to come out and honor the victims of this tragedy, I encourage you to join us at a series of vigils this evening.
"Anyone who may have valuable information about yesterday‚Äôs incident should contact the Anne Arundel County Police homicide unit at (410) 222-4731. If you would like to remain anonymous, please call the Department‚Äôs 24-hour tip line at (410) 222-4700.
"I again encourage any individual or family member who needs help to call the Anne Arundel County Crisis ‚ÄòCommunity Warmline‚Äô at (410) 768-5522.
"We honor the courage of the Capital Gazette staff who were determined to press on and publish the newspaper today. They are a tribute to their profession and have quickly cemented the legacy of their lost colleagues.
‚ÄúWe also cannot ignore that those targeted were members of our cherished free press who work tirelessly to keep us informed in a time of increasingly course and overheated political rhetoric.
"The challenge is to find the political will to enact sensible and widely supported measures that will make our communities safer places to live.
‚ÄúIt is inevitable that this terrible shooting will be pulled into the national debate over what we can do as a society to address gun violence. That‚Äôs fair and appropriate because clearly we must do more.
‚ÄúI also want to reiterate my deep appreciation for the swift, heroic efforts of our first responders and law enforcement officials, who are continuing to conduct a thorough investigation of yesterday‚Äôs incident. They answered the call of duty with outstanding professionalism.
"And for those who are grieving, we will do whatever we can to help ease the impact of this traumatic experience.
‚ÄúAs yesterday‚Äôs events continue to ripple through the Annapolis community, I want to again express my deepest sorrow to the families who lost their loved ones in this terrible tragedy.  We will keep close the memory of Rob, Wendi, Gerald, John and Rebecca.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the privilege of knowing many reporters at The Capital Gazette over the years. I deeply admire their professionalism, their service to our community and their commitment to a vibrant, free and open press.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs violent events at The Capital Gazette are heart wrenching. As we work to process this tragedy, we should praise our first responders, whose swift and courageous actions prevented an even greater loss of life.

Annapolis is a very tight knit community, and a tragedy like this shakes us to our core. For individuals or families in need of immediate help, please contact the Anne Arundel County Crisis ‚ÄúCommunity Warmline‚Äù at (410) 768-5522.
Right now our highest priority needs to be making sure the families of the victims have the information and support they need in this tragic time.
I am in contact with the federal agencies responding to the scene. My office has established lines of communication with the FBI and ATF to ensure that they have the resources they need to assist the Anne Arundel County Police Department.
Our first responders took courageous action today and are managing the ongoing situation with the utmost care and professionalism. We cannot thank them enough.
I am deeply saddened by reports of a shooting at @capgaznews. My thoughts are with the paper‚Äôs staff and their families at this difficult time. I will continue to monitor the situation and work with local, state and federal law enforcement as we assess these developments.
