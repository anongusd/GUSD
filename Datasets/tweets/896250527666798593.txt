if Ohio followed my idea for redistricting, the map would look a lot better and many Ohio voters would actually have a choice in their House elections. Ohio needs to be redistricted and it‚Äôs pretty amazing the courts haven‚Äôt gotten to this already https://t.co/FWpT49j9L3

reference that from here on out for comparisons. right now, Ohio‚Äôs map is fixed to have four districts that will almost always vote blue, two that are Republican-leaning (they did not vote Democrat in 2018), and 10 generally safe red districts. you can see in the map that major https://t.co/Kn40orTn4t

Any kind of legal decision on this has a lot of questions to answer.
a certain race or gender from being on the ballot? Or would the courts only allow this in the case of a non-political condition being met? If so, that raises some questions, like what if there were to be a candidate some day with an income low enough that they never filed returns
The question being - can states keep people off the ballot because they are pro-life, socialist, anti-vax, etc.? Can a legal line be drawn between political reasons to keep someone off the ballot and personal reasons? If that line is drawn, could states feasibly ban candidates of
I would definitely question the legality of this, but if it gets challenged it‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens. Arizona also has a law that disallows Communists from their ballot and that would raise many other concerns if the courts hold this up. https://t.co/DztDvW1MWl

You can continue to dance around the question and try to throw stones at me for asking, but the more you refuse to answer the worse it is.
@KAccountable @SteveScalise Okay, so you are a hypocrite and don‚Äôt want to admit it, instead throwing up a casual argument from fallacy instead of answering the question.
@garutch @ReallyRealDonny @SteveScalise This isn‚Äôt a religious view. It‚Äôs a political view. That was quite the leap. So it‚Äôs okay to abort poor people because they won‚Äôt have a good quality of life? Why not focus on lifting up everyone and preserving life? Why do you assume that I want the lowest common denominator?
@KAccountable @SteveScalise Okay, so? Are you a hypocrite, yes or no?
@julynewmoon @nowthisnews I did not say you are a Democrat, but you said that Democrats shouldn‚Äôt stand for anything and justified it by saying ‚Äúwell Republicans are just as bad‚Äù.
@garutch @ReallyRealDonny @SteveScalise Weird, no one is talking about banning sex. Democrats are refusing to ban late term and post-birth abortions. When you have sex you make a decision (except some unique and rare circumstances). It‚Äôs not the fault of the fetus that this decision was made.

@martin_short64 @RawStory You‚Äôre right, my apologies, I mixed up the pound and euro symbols. Still is a lot less than $15.
@nowthisnews Kind of hard to square this with liberal abortion policy
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon The tea party movement was a movement to hold government accountable to spending. Most of those people (like Marco) dropped that once elected or (like Rod Blum) later lost re-election. Rand Paul is one of six members of Congress who has voted in a fiscally responsible way.
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon I never said that was the case, but one district is not representative of the whole country.
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill Not really. Decriminalization generally refers to possession and use for medical reasons but keeping sale illegal, while legalization means it‚Äôs more like alcohol.
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon Those same Republicans also selected the biggest non Tea Party candidate in 2012, and Rand Paul and Marco Rubio both rode in on the 10 wave. Not saying you‚Äôre totally wrong, but there‚Äôs more to consider.
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill Because legalization is a better option there I think, since we know the positive and negative effects of doing that. If I had a magic want the next drug I would look at legalizing is LSD, but that probably won‚Äôt be it.
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg NY-14 is one 27th of New York
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg you bringing up all these districts? Probably because a small handful of districts don‚Äôt show the whole picture of the US.
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg There were also a lot of moderate Dems who won those districts in Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma, etc. My district elected a moderate Dem (who also ran in 2016) over a Republican incumbent. This considering that Bernie won all the states I just mentioned in the 2016 primaries. Why aren‚Äôt
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg No, because it‚Äôs not fair to assume Democrats in one district represent Democrats everywhere.
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon This is fair and true, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to compare NY-14 with the rest of the Democratic Party.
@MacenzieCarter @my15kids @thehill We actually very nearly agree on this. I prefer decriminalizing everything but weed so more research can be done and drug safe havens for people who commit crimes while addicted or od.
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg Kind of true, just like how Republicans will win in Wyoming no matter what, Democrats will win in NY-14 no matter what, so taking cues from safe districts on national elections isn‚Äôt the greatest measure.
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon None, but House and Presidential elections are different things. The tea party wave didn‚Äôt lead to a tea party nominee in 2012.
@verysmallracoon @robjGoldberg Please, explain what I‚Äôm wrong about
@verysmallracoon @theseantcollins @clairecmc @AOC Thanks for the compliment, yes, I am definitely 18.
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill Yep! But if we improve ports of entry AND build the wall, we‚Äôll eliminate a lot of problems. Creating more entry points would help too.
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon The fact that you think this is hypocrisy is a pretty good indicator that you didn‚Äôt get anything I said
@robjGoldberg @verysmallracoon What are you talking about? If course it had to do with Obama, incumbent Presidents always have bad midterms for their party.
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill No, I want people to come legally. Yes I did hear about it. That‚Äôs the point, we want to know where everything comes through so we can better regulate that.
@martin_short64 @RawStory Their minimum wage is $8.23 USD.
@honourablefool @theseantcollins @clairecmc That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. He won because of his trade policy, which those states (plus Minnesota, Ohio, and Iowa liked). Not because of racism or whatever the competing argument is.
@verysmallracoon @theseantcollins @clairecmc @AOC Trump wasn‚Äôt running for Congress in NY-14 tho, so AOC was never picked to beat Trump
@brpierce51 @theseantcollins @clairecmc As for what a ‚ÄúModerate Liberty Republican‚Äù is, it means I‚Äôm a Republican who‚Äôs more libertarian on some issues and more liberal on other issues, but overall conservative.

@bootguy_paul @my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill Same goes for Democrats though
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill To make it harder to enter the US illegally and force more legal immigration.
@RawStory Yes, making the minimum wage a living wage forces you to fire people and raise prices, which makes the minimum wage not a living wage. If you want to keep doing that you end up with a lot of people unemployed and high prices for everything.
@my15kids @MacenzieCarter @thehill No, but you think the vast majority of Republicans don‚Äôt want the wall?

@Treyfana The system I would personally like to see is some kind of adapted French system, which has public and private hospitals, an individual mandate, and private insurance. I think a Medicaid expansion plus the French system without the mandate might work just as well.
@dirttfather @theseantcollins @clairecmc You clearly do think it‚Äôs important since it‚Äôs the first thing you went to. If you didn‚Äôt care you wouldn‚Äôt have brought it up.

@Treyfana Public hospitals with a deductible for care. No clue what the deductible is, but certainly not Medicare for all.
@dirttfather @theseantcollins @clairecmc You know you‚Äôre right when ‚Äúthis guy is ugly‚Äù becomes your operative argument.
@auntiepho @theseantcollins @clairecmc It was a good year for Dems in a state that doesn‚Äôt mind Dems outside of Presidential elections. Remember Kander‚Äôs narrow loss just 2 years earlier? McCaskill was way more popular, enough to win, until she went far left.
@Treyfana Norway does not have Medicare for all.
@sbakergrimes @theseantcollins @clairecmc Oh yeah it was never mainstream. It was an O‚ÄôKeefe video. But Missouri conservatives, including the ones that liked McCaskill, probably saw it.
@Treyfana Medicaid for all doesn‚Äôt work that well in any country that has it. If you want to talk about France‚Äôs universal system then we can talk about that, since there‚Äôs no disputing that it works well.
@anarchotokonoko @theseantcollins @clairecmc On guns and quite a few other issues. I can‚Äôt recall the exact content of the video but from the viewpoint of more moderate Trump supporters in Missouri who liked McCaskill, it was pretty bad.
@karenroepke @theseantcollins @clairecmc I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I know I‚Äôm Conservative, I know which of my views are far-right, moderate, far-left, etc. If we assumed it was true to any extent then we should also assume it‚Äôs true for liberal pundits and everyone else.

@thehill Ohio has a Senator who will say anything, regardless of whether he believes it, to be elected President.
@direwolfepc @theseantcollins @clairecmc Not if the goal is for Trump to lose. That would move the needle in favor of Dems but to win they need a good opponent. Trump‚Äôs GOP approval is too high for a primary opponent to matter.

@smittyd060 @Politics_Polls @ppppolls @314action That‚Äôs quite the simplistic view of elections. While re-election campaigns tend to be a referendum on the incumbent President, things happen to push it in one direction or another. 2012 would‚Äôve been way closer if Mr. 47% had kept his mouth shut.
@smittyd060 @Politics_Polls @ppppolls @314action Not when ‚ÄúGeneric Dem‚Äù is listed. When someone hears that, they tend to think ‚Äúmy type of Democrat‚Äù, often idealizing to someone who is closer to them ideologically. If anything, this is the ceiling for Dems.

@BheemaBachus Being unknown in an election helps because you can build your own image. I don‚Äôt think the police department mismanagement is a sticker, he could just as easily remove himself from that scandal. Nonetheless, this is what elected Trump, Obama, Clinton, and Carter.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises 1980, where John Anderson, a moderate Republican who was a primary opponent to Reagan, ran independent and ended up hurting President Carter, possibly costing him re-election.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises It *could*, but the reason why it usually doesn‚Äôt happen is because independent candidates end up being appealing to people who don‚Äôt like the incumbent but are in their party, whereas the opposition tends to vote in mostly-lockstep with their nominee. This is best observable in

@Techtonic17 @Jon_Melin @jazzyneises The odds of that are higher than him winning outright, although the House would probably pick a major candidate, but 270+ Electors aren‚Äôt totally impossible for Schultz.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises Not really no, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single election in US history where an independent candidate has helped the incumbent. And I was expecting Kasich to run Indy until Schultz started talking it up, and I didn‚Äôt really care.

@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises Even if he doesn‚Äôt win, the spoiler theory is pretty well debunked.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises California, and probably New York, would be in his coalition for victory. I would agree that California is essential.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises a right-wing President. That means he would almost certainly take votes pretty evenly from both, although it could be different in every region. It‚Äôs almost certain that Schultz won‚Äôt win, but it shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out.
@Jon_Melin @jazzyneises I think the bar is definitely higher for that reason, but a Schultz victory shouldn‚Äôt be written off at all. He could very easily take support from all over the US, and could bolster that to a victory. It either helps or hurts him a lot that he‚Äôs left-leaning in a re-election of

@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill And by the way, I totally should have a say in this, because abortion effects everyone.
@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill I know. I‚Äôm saying men and women should be held accountable for their actions.
@3kindsBlue No. But history shouldn‚Äôt remember Trump as the whole problem. I would love to see families together, and progress should be made to allow for that.
@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill Nice. I‚Äôm not going to answer your inane hypotheticals. Women and men should be held accountable to their decisions. Killing babies left and right and not changing your behavior is cruel and immature.
@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill Not having sex if you‚Äôre not ready to get pregnant is 1,000x more responsible.
@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill I strongly disagree with that. Just because you don‚Äôt want to be pregnant doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt have to be responsible for your choices.
@izza_elly @alyssalavacca @thehill No, but many have brought it up because everyone who knows me well knows that for much of my childhood I only lived with my sisters and mother (my dad was deployed 3 times) and that as a result I grew up in a house where periods were talked about a lot.

@alyssalavacca @izza_elly @thehill You are talking about marginal cases. Yes, Medicaid should cover birth control. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. You are failing to defend why the vast majority of abortions should be allowed after 8 weeks.
@izza_elly @alyssalavacca @thehill Rare probably isn‚Äôt the best characterization, but most women (all the ones I know, at least) that have irregular periods get prescribed birth control.
@izza_elly @alyssalavacca @thehill I already talked about the rare case where a mother‚Äôs life is in danger.
@Kongen_Carl @KendalKillian @repmattdean @mnsports3 That‚Äôs because I specifically went out of my way to list positions I disagree with Republicans on.

@king_jeremy_b @alyssalavacca @thehill It‚Äôs not ‚Äúrare in my eyes‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally rare. This legislation also allows for abortion if it effects the mental health of a woman up to the point of dilation.

@king_jeremy_b @alyssalavacca @thehill It‚Äôs marginal in the sense that it‚Äôs very rare. I see how that could‚Äôve been misinterpreted though.
@BheemaBachus @ashleyfeinberg @NateSilver538 Especially in the Midwest, and super especially in the iron range and rust belt areas. My great Grandpa, a lifelong Democrat, voted for Trump in 16 (at 92!). I don‚Äôt think he would vote for Schultz but most of those voters, especially the younger ones, would make up Howie‚Äôs base.
@king_jeremy_b @alyssalavacca @thehill That‚Äôs another marginal issue. Protecting life means protecting life.

@_RScottWhitley_ @thehill No one cares about definitions. When people talk about abortion they mean baby killing.
@alyssalavacca @thehill Except the ignorance of science has gone miles. No abortion should be allowed after 12 weeks, and it should be very heavily restricted after 8 weeks. If you have a heartbeat and can feel pain, you shouldn‚Äôt be killed.

A big reason I‚Äôve gotten involved in the GOP is to breathe new life into that kind of thinking. It‚Äôs important to mean something when you say something.
@mnsports3 @ChaseMcAllister @repmattdean Biggest complaint I have about the GOP. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a libertarian or anything, but if we say we like personal and economic liberty that shouldn‚Äôt stop when we don‚Äôt like that freedom. Example: I hate prostitution. I believe adultery is a sin, and that God created...

@Mabelrose2 @TonyContino @Jason2CD @homeinmn02 @RepAngieCraig The fact that I would even consider voting against the guy who I think will run against Craig shows that I have a massively open mind. Believe it or not there are Republicans that come to mind that I might vote for Craig over (but would rather vote third party). I already know

@mrs_snark @MrCourtneyMoore @redherringdraws @fetusesnotppl @PPact The second part I definitely agree with. People need to be held responsible for their actions and decisions regardless of gender
@Axels15 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump In fact (and I double checked to make sure I was right about this), the Republican Party was effectively the second or third coming of the Free Soil Party.  Which was a pretty damn small third party.
@mrs_snark @MrCourtneyMoore @redherringdraws @fetusesnotppl @PPact As I‚Äôve said before, if her life is at risk it‚Äôs a different issue. It‚Äôs also worth noting that abortion is not a totally safe process either.
@Axels15 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump History repeats itself. Bell was effectively the Whig Party candidate and he lost badly.

@Axels15 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Yes... because you could‚Äôve gotten a good indicator of the 2016 election by looking at the Brexit vote, 2015 UK elections, and the rise of populism in many other nations such as Germany.
@Axels15 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump 1860 for President, 2014 for Governor, 2018 for US Senate, and I believe 2006 (maybe a little earlier) for US House. But look at the 2017 France election. Look at the 1992 polls. Ruling out a Schultz victory is not a good analysis.
@Axels15 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not dense lol, I know I don‚Äôt have a lot of influence. I actually think Schultz could be a great candidate, and I think that analysis saying that Schultz would hurt a Democrat is bad if not totally untrue. Same goes for saying he can‚Äôt win.
@RichardCoffee13 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Prove it. I‚Äôve cited evidence that he can win (1992 polls) and your opinion seems to be based on feelings.
@RichardCoffee13 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Okay? My political views don‚Äôt change:	-The fact that Ross Perot was leading in the 1992 polls until he dropped out	- The fact that Schultz could very well be elected President	- The fact that I‚Äôll take a look at his policies if he runs
@RichardCoffee13 @davidcicilline @HowardSchultz @realDonaldTrump Solid argument

@mrs_snark @MrCourtneyMoore @redherringdraws @fetusesnotppl @PPact The government can‚Äôt require abortion.

@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll So if a Democrat wins by 7% in a D+60 year in Georgia as opposed to losing by 7% in a D+2 year, does that mean the first candidate was a better candidate in Georgia? If you think so you should provide a good reason or not claim to know what you‚Äôre talking about.
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll To summarize 	You are saying Abrams did better than Clinton. On hard numbers that‚Äôs true, but she did slightly better in a year where Dems did way better. That‚Äôs the distinction. She was a weaker candidate than Clinton.

@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll If a Democrat wins Minnesota by 4% in a year where Democrats win the popular vote by 4%, that‚Äôs less impressive than a Democrat winning by 6% in a D+5 year and that‚Äôs a worse performance than losing by 1% in an R+30 year.
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll Do you know what it means when a state is trending red or trending blue between two elections? You have to compare the margin vs. the national vote.
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll Georgia 2016: R+5.2 (Adj. R+7.4)	Georgia 2018: R+1.4 (Adj. R+10.6)
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll If you adjust for the net change (Dems had a +2.2 advantage in 16 and a +8.8 advantage in 18), Abrams did worse in Georgia than Clinton.
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll Come back with numbers and we can talk.
@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll She will probably win but that will be close too since it‚Äôs a Presidential year. In 2008, she did roughly 4 points worse than Obama. She will probably overperform the Democratic nominee for President, but nothing is off the table.

@PoliticalSavGuy @willdabeast455 @LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll Don‚Äôt forget that New Hampshire is a fiscally conservative state. Every time AOC opens her mouth, they drift a few votes closer to Trump. Add to that the fact that Libertarians probably won‚Äôt be as strong in 2020, and that Bernie is the only fiscal socialist who can appeal to any
@MattJReynolds @Politics_Polls He had 45% of the vote overall and just imagine him in a one on one debate with Jeb!, Cruz, Rand, Marco, or anyone else (but the two I mentioned). Christie would‚Äôve lost just because of bridgegate. Trump never had to be a good candidate in the primaries, he just had to be best.
@LudwigsGhost @Politics_Polls @MasonDixonPoll If you‚Äôre right (I don‚Äôt think those are the deciding states in 2020), that‚Äôs not good for Dems. But I bet that ultimately, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Nevada will decide 2020.
@AnnCoulter https://t.co/3qHAUsEMNc
@MattJReynolds @Politics_Polls Bad analysis. Trump would‚Äôve won by a lot in a one-on-one race against anyone but Carly Fiorina and maybe Ben Carson.

@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC People are dying because of abortion. Each abortion, especially after 8 weeks, when the baby has really started to develop, is the ending of a human life. If you want to talk facts and science, at least acknowledge where life begins. https://t.co/7VovDw1rgQ
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC No, men are effected by abortion too. Almost as much as women.
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC You‚Äôre right about that. But likewise, shouldn‚Äôt babies be not murdered?
@johniadarola Privatize TSA now!
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC No. That‚Äôs the same argument that was used to justify slavery. Enough is enough. We are talking about baby killing. There is no moral or realistic reason to allow abortions after the 8th week.
@JordanUhl @AOC @DanRiffle Every billionaire that hordes money is a policy failure. Every billionaire that puts their money back into the economy is a policy success. The difference of opinion basically boils down to which you believe is more common. Name one billionaire who got rich off of hoarding. One.
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC I disagree. Abortion fundamentally effects men too, almost as much as women. 		And by the way, most women do not support legal abortion all the way. It‚Äôs actually pretty unclear what most women think about this, as 50% are pro-choice and 44% are pro-life.
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC It's the standpoint of most businessmen that taxes don‚Äôt exist. These are adult humans perfectly capable of reasoning. There is no reason for your opinion to even be relevant. And science doesn't answer why your voice should matter in this issue.
@stevenpvr @kathygriffin Totally agree. The federal government has gotten way too big and we have to devolve more things to states, counties, cities, and individuals.
@kathygriffin If you‚Äôre wondering why Kathy, it‚Äôs because so many industries have been federalized. If we privatized and regulated ATC, those people would be making a lot more than they do now. If we handed the TSA over to the states, they would be working better.
@Radbeard @nejohannsen @AOC The best outcome for the woman and the baby. Which is why a lot of people like me are out there that would like abortion to be 100% banned but know that‚Äôs not practical from a standpoint of women‚Äôs health. It is somewhat healthier to get a legal abortion than an illegal one.

Congress should pss a new ERA that disallows legal discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, or any of those sorts of factors (except for age, because that would have some real implications).
@washingtonpost That‚Äôs not why they don‚Äôt like her. There are tons of Dems that rail against money in politics that don‚Äôt get nearly that level of attacks from corporate Dems. It‚Äôs because AOC says stupid things and not only fails to defend those things but also denies responsibility for it.
@TenaciousE5 @AOC You missed what I said. I criticized the White House and AOC for using religion for their political goals. The Bible isn‚Äôt a guide to political policy. It‚Äôs an instruction manual on how to live your life in a Godly way. Using the Bible as a political attack dog is wrong.

@jodimb25 @_Trick_Baby_ @DonnaNeubig @NBCPolitics @MSNBC Know better than to do what???
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN That just might be true. It was nice talking, but I must sleep now. Good talk üëçüèª
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN though, at least I would think
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN Modern democracy would be an interesting exercise for sure. To my knowledge democracy has never really been tried outside of Greece. If information technology continues to accelerate like it has been since the 90s, it could potentially work. Fake news would have a worse effect
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN next election. Granted that might not happen if it would hurt them.
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN This is probably too far off for either of our lifetimes, but I‚Äôve wondered before if elections in some kind of shorter period for the Congress would change how well things worked. On one hand, it could make things worse, with the opposition or majority stonewalling until the
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN candidates and parties separate.
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN I would agree that political parties are definitely a net negative. At the very least, political parties should be for endorsements and not for running a nomination process (although this idea only works well with RCV). Let candidates identify themselves how they want, but keep
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN in court decisions. I think most of the Cory fits that well but it only takes a few bad eggs to ruin the court. I think the Senate made a mistake confirming justices so easily and is now making a mistake by voting on a party line.
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN I don‚Äôt know if I would go that far, but the politicization of the Supreme Court was definitely never intended. The fact that we know that we can characterize the court as having 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats is a disgrace. They should really be judges with no history of politics
@NoktDoto @IlhanMN @womensmarch @AOC An oppressive regime... of people who have been persecuted wrongly for all of human history. I think I‚Äôll side with Israel on this one. And by the way, this ‚Äúoppressive regime‚Äù wants Palestine to be a country. Guess which side doesn‚Äôt want the other to have a country?
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN broker. I think it‚Äôs intended to give some smaller states a greater say, but capping the number of Congressmen made that difference very disproportionate (you can win the presidency in a two-way race while losing the vote by 46%).
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN My idea towards the electoral college is that, in every election where it broke with the popular vote (except for 1876, but that‚Äôs kind of it‚Äôs own issue) no one got a majority of the vote. That‚Äôs probably just a coincidence, but in those cases I think it‚Äôs probably a justified
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN Oh yeah, leave it to me forget campaign finance reform. Businesses and unions should not be allowed to give to campaigns and PACs have to go. George Soros and the Koch Brothers can be forced to stop at $2.7k per Primary/general like everyone else.
@NoktDoto @IlhanMN @womensmarch @AOC To clarify, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs anti-Semitic based on what she said in this series of tweets, but there are other things worth criticizing her on.
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN abolition is the right answer, but electors should be awarded proportionately (with the exception of the extra two electors going to the state vote winner). Another thing I like is automatic registration that purges dead voters. RCV. That‚Äôs about it though.
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN Now I‚Äôm interested in talking this out. I‚Äôve personally always liked the idea of switching Congress to one Representative per 100,000 people and turning redistricting over to a computer program, but keeping the Senate the same. As far as the electoral college goes, I don‚Äôt think
@FunkLab3000 @IlhanMN 17 year olds should be allowed to vote. Maybe 16 year olds. A lot of stuff needs to be done to fix the way we vote though.

@KamalaHarris You don‚Äôt deserve a raise unless you earn a raise.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre Actually, I‚Äôm treating women like the responsible adults that they are. Treating women like idiots is saying ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt know she could get pregnant, so she should have an out‚Äù. I‚Äôm confident in adults‚Äô abilities to be mature and responsible, regardless of gender.
@thehill Barr will probably just continue the war on drugs and support for interrogation. There are way better options for AG. Pam Bondi, Trey Gowdy, and others.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre Like having protected sex, you can eat Big Macs daily, exercise, and be just fine. You can also do that and get fat.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre Again, if I decide to eat a Big Mac for every meal and argue that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do it to get fat so it‚Äôs unfair that I got fat‚Äù, it‚Äôs the same argument.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre would have to have sex roughly 371 times (again, my math could be off, but it‚Äôs in that ballpark) to get pregnant with both types of protection. And that‚Äôs assuming you only use a condom and the pill.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre Yes, but condoms have an 85% success rate and birth control has a 91% success rate. I don‚Äôt know what the combined success rate is, but with some rough math I would estimate that it‚Äôs about 98-99% when both are used. If you account for the regular odds of getting Pregnant, you
@RetroPoochXD @johniadarola Yeah, so? Pelosi said that there‚Äôs no situation where she lets any money goes to the wall. $5.7B isn‚Äôt an awful lot (unfortunately), but if Trump offered to increase hurricane relief, cut defense spending, increase welfare benefits, and so on she still wouldn‚Äôt go for it.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre No, it‚Äôs not a punishment, but it is a potential consequence. If you have safe sex, you probably won‚Äôt get pregnant. If you have unprotected sex and get pregnant or get someone pregnant that shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise.
@RetroPoochXD @johniadarola Yeah... except Pelosi keeps publicly saying that she refuses to compromise on wall funding. She won‚Äôt go for $5.7B, or $2B, or $100M. During one interview, she joked that she would give ‚Äúa dollar‚Äù as a compromise.
@fetusesnotppl Whatever you like to think. Given your viewpoint on this, my bet is you don‚Äôt know an awful lot of people in the military. Veteran‚Äôs benefits are pretty great, even for people who were never in the military (specifically family members). The VA is a joke though.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre A list of the women I‚Äôve harassed:		List will be updated as needed.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre You can‚Äôt get pregnant or get someone pregnant without having sex. Whether you like it or not, pregnancy is a consequence of sex. You could use the same argument to say ‚ÄúI just ate cheeseburgers daily for 20 years for pleasure, not to get fat‚Äù.
@fetusesnotppl I think we would agree on the fact that virtually every military intervention since the 80s (maybe longer) has been the wrong choice, but people in the military (except top generals) don‚Äôt make that choice. It‚Äôs still brave to join the military.
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre So you think people should have the choice whether or not to shoot up schools?
@fetusesnotppl @NZLAndre Not having sex is being responsible. If you do and you get pregnant, that‚Äôs a consequence of your choice. Deal with it.

@publicfreeman @jkg_kazi @thecjpearson I agree with you there, but that seems to be an effect of the overintrusion of government into business. Specifically with subsidies. That stifles competition.

@Ocasio2018 of our current K-12 education system. We need to radically change that system to K-10 and teach students to get jobs, NOT to be ready for college (which schools can‚Äôt do well anyhow). We also need to seriously trim down common core.
@Ocasio2018 Actually, education at that early of an age has been proven to dampen interest in education in the long term and increase dropout rates. Universal Pre-K would effectively mandate that every parent sends their kid to government run Pre-K. That‚Äôs ignorant given the massive failure

@KamaIaHarris @thehill I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible, I honestly don‚Äôt. The margin of victory was so narrow that the incumbency advantage of a President alone would‚Äôve tipped Kobach over the edge, especially in such a red state.
@KamaIaHarris @thehill There is, because it‚Äôs unlikely that the state will split between parties in a Presidential year and it‚Äôs virtually impossible for a Democratic nominee to win Kansas.
@KamaIaHarris @thehill Yes, and those people had an overall negative approval of Kobach and a positive approval of Trump.

@KamaIaHarris @thehill I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible in a Presidential year, there‚Äôs no real substance that proves your point.
@KamaIaHarris @thehill West Virginia is one of the most Democrat states in the US and the most conservative Senate Democrat won by 3%. Trump is a lot more popular than Kobach in Kansas.
@KamaIaHarris @thehill Also worth noting that voters view state and federal elections very differently, which is why West Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana are often close in Governor races but safe red states in Presidential elections
@KamaIaHarris @thehill In a D+9 year against a very unpopular Republican. In 2016 there weren‚Äôt any splits between Presidential results and Senate results. Not possible for Trump to lose Kansas.
@KamaIaHarris @thehill Not realistically possible

@SenKamalaHarris Then why won‚Äôt you just give $5B for national security?
@Jon_Melin @realDonaldTrump The idea is to portray Dems as weak on national security. Bill Clinton did the same thing in 1995 but with Medicare and that‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons he was re-elected.

@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Giving money to farmers isn‚Äôt socialist, it‚Äôs been practice for ages and has kept us from famine.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Not too late, and tax cuts aren‚Äôt bailouts.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill There‚Äôs something we can agree on, the government should never interfere with the free market by propping up failed businesses.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill I apologize, it was wrong for me to assume you were going to consider facts instead of emojis and memes that aren‚Äôt really that great. I never should have engaged with you with an intent to inform and persuade because clearly you don‚Äôt care. Enjoy voting for poverty.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Memes aren‚Äôt going to convince me either. Turns out I was slightly off on the numbers, but you were way off. 73% come from Mexico, Latin America, and South America, 16% come from Asia, and the other 11% come from elsewhere. You act like we shouldn‚Äôt be controlling immigration.

@Vickigr81567276 @thehill 98.3% of illegal immigration is from the southern border.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Just because less people are illegally immigrating doesn‚Äôt mean the threat is gone. I actually guarantee you that we could bring 5,000,000 people in a year LEGALLY in a way that keeps us safe, but we can‚Äôt do anything with our immigration policy without a wall.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Okay, so let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre right and it would be Trump‚Äôs fault. What‚Äôs wrong with him shutting down the government for national security?
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill He‚Äôs wrong. Trump is 100% wrong. If there‚Äôs a shutdown it is the fault of the legislature.
@Vickigr81567276 @thehill Nope. He promised this when he was campaigning and was elected because of it. He is sticking to his promises. Democrats are stonewalling that and if it leads to a shutdown it‚Äôs their fault, just like it was Republicans fault for the 1995 shutdown.
@thehill Yeah, we‚Äôll see if Democrats want to shut down the government.
