On "VICE," an #Oscars nominee for Best Picture: 		Hollywood’s self-congratulatory, maddening, false portrayal of the Bush admin shows us why Republicans fled into Trump’s arms in 2016 — and why they’re likely to do it again in 2020, writes @matt_latimer: https://t.co/ZC5xXEHX47
Ahead of the #Oscars tonight, some of our pieces over the past year about tonight's nominated films:
"Sometimes, it’s not the most electable who wins, but the least unelectable," writes @billscher. "But that’s not an argument for willfully flying blind and ignoring electability altogether."	https://t.co/uHGao0qmew
In political terms, it amounted to a massive bet on a strategy of mobilizing infrequent voters instead of trying to win over dependable ones. 		Now, national campaign strategists are paying close attention to how Beto O’Rourke did it: https://t.co/8nLCjCuiK0
"As a general rule, you can use Trump’s electoral strength in the early Republican primaries as a proxy for pessimism." https://t.co/wzGlIMjX22
When the ultimate goal is winning 270 Electoral College votes, simply choosing a nominee based strictly on who you like is an enormous risk. A majority coalition invariably includes voters who don’t think exactly the way you do. https://t.co/EYyLmxtEG5
O’Rourke is now on the precipice of running for president with “losing Senate candidate” as the most impressive line on his résumé.		But it was how he chose to run that campaign last year that sets him apart from his potential Democratic rivals: https://t.co/Wd0x2GISoa
Where some see generosity, others see old-fashioned corporate paternalism: https://t.co/HRQ0BjrvXC
“Did we accomplish historical voter turnout in Texas? Yes. Was it enough to put us over the top? No,” Malitz shrugged two days after the election. “It’s politics in the age of Trump. Historical data only means so much.” https://t.co/Ad3Orl2SM4
“There would be no triangulating against his party’s base, no judicious courtship of a relatively small slice of potential party-switchers with views to the right of his.” https://t.co/8FJ1Y1gMEg

Politically, ousting Trump would require the same kind of seismic wave he successfully surfed during his 2016 campaign — nothing less, in fact, than another shakeup and realignment of the Republican Party: https://t.co/oIDnheP8ua
If Senate Democrats could secure all 47 votes in their caucus, they’d need 20 Republicans to secure a conviction. But to feel comfortable moving forward with impeachment proceedings at all, they’d need to get signals from maybe half that number: https://t.co/XeMpHDu0ty

If the United States has a sacred text, it’s the Constitution. Americans are taught, from an early age, to venerate the 231-year-old document. 		The presidency of Donald Trump illustrates the problem with this veneration, writes Sanford Levinson: https://t.co/rjiUdjCPDu
