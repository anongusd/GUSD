@lyft incredibly disappointed in lack of customer service and shady business practices.  Got a promo e-mail, took multiple trips then was told the promo was tied to an old invalid account and I could not be credited even tho no fault of my own.  @Uber would have been cheaper!
@RaminNasibov Should have hired @ArnoffMoving to get that installed!
@comcast Jimmy in your solutions group deserves a raise! He was very professional and incredibly helpful with multiple issues I was having!
@GoPro Project in Studio opens w/ my timeline gone! I saved religiously, and clips on left are correct but timeline on bottom is empty-help!
@AmericanAir just had a nice guy drop our bags off. Online system still says bags yet to be found but I'm just glad to have them. Thank you!
@AmericanAir already done. rude DCA lady said no way to know when we'd get info. said it was our fault-customs in Abu Dhabi rather than NY.
@AmericanAir what's wrong at DCA? Our bags are no where to be found though hundreds of others are here ownerless.. https://t.co/oPUCTXPju3
@LPTechTeam that doesn't make sense. You weren't the manufacturer of the phone when I bought the case either, but you warrantied it then.
@LifeProof You said the replacement case you sent me has a new 1 year warranty.  Now you say that doesn't cover water damage! What gives!?!
Losing #ExIm means the U.S. is losing #jobs. It's time for Congress to VOTE to reauthorize #ExIm4Jobs http://t.co/eYjg0wtiUA
@thepointsguy - can I cancel a new credit card after 364 days in order to not have to pay annual fee in 2nd year if waived 1st year? Thanks!
@united spoke w/ TSA-they said talk to UA again because it worked US Airways flight last week and worked for my wife who was booked with me
@united so is it a coincidence that 3 flights in 3 weeks didn't get pre check???
@united -can you help me get my pre-check on boarding passes? last 3 flights haven't had it; gate and phone agents haven't figured it out
@united please help. spent hour on phone yesterday-supposed to get call when problem with website solved. no call, problem not solved.
@USPS fails again. My redelivery apparently will not happen though website says it will. Waited 29 min on phone - #mightaswellbecomcast
@thepointsguy where on your website can I submit a "reader question"?		thanks!
@USPS still the undisputed worst service anywhere. Waiting for priority 2 day package since Aug. 21st. No one can figure out where it is.
@lyft just tried to send a DM but it said I can't b/c you don't follow me. Can't tell if this convo is a DM or not..
@lyft I just downloaded the app then tried to click my friends link for a $25 credit but it says only for new members. What can I do? Thanks
@USAirways thanks for the prompt response.  Your representative was very helpful and got my problem solved quickly!
@USAirways my TSA pre-check isn't showing up when I book flights. What can I do to correct this? Just called and got message to call later.
Tom really crushing a presentation about how @4pfoods is going to change how we think about food. #4PFoods #4PFoodslaunchparty

@ActuaryGangsta @epl108 @TomLorenzo haha. sadly that might be true...
@HODINKEE how wide are your 22mm straps on the buckle end? 22 also or do they narrow? Thanks!
@OXO just got your green salad spinner and love it so far. wondering if it can be used to store a made salad? the lid doesn't seem too tight
@USPS goes down as the worst customer service experience ever. I STILL have not received a call back from either number. Thx for nothing.
@USPS Still no response from either #. Visited post office today-they don't know either and can't get in touch with the center. Please help!
@JewelersMutual - thanks for your great customer service. Just spoke to Jaime in the personal policy dept and she was SUPER helpful!
@USPS No luck. Left messages for both 3 days in a row with no return. Have tried each # 5+ times w/ no answer. Any other ways to reach out??
@USPS "dispatched to sort facility" on Dec 20th at 6pm.  Tracking number is RE052555561US - any help is greatly appreciated!
@USPS - it's now been 11 days since i sent a Priority 2-day package and I can't get anyone to tell me where it is. What do I do!?
@USPS - any reason my tracking info still says expected delivery of Dec. 23 now that it's Dec 30!? I paid a LOT to ship something 2day mail!
@OverDriveLibs I think it's okay now. For a while there was no option to play the D/Led files. Then it just appeared after a while. Thanks!
@OverDriveLibs just downloaded your app and love it. having some trouble playing files on my iphone once downloaded - any suggestins? Thanks
@DanUrda my dudes use bovada and sportsbook. the two most public books ever. was looking at others earlier but hadn't seen them drop til now
@DanUrda where did you get those lines? haven't seen chiefs or 9ers go that low anywhere. and what do you like about steelers?
@DanUrda-totally agree. i'm just worried that covering isn't a major concern and when they're up 24 at half, they take him out and let up.
@DanUrda the last 4 (like 5 years worth) 20+ point dogs are 4-0 ATS. not scared?
RT @engadget: 500px photo-sharing app gets iOS 7 update, new looks and features http://t.co/QXWNTa7INp
@cporten-his aim is off. wearing two super bowl rings is throwing him off balance i guess. luckily for you, vick doesn't have that issue.
Nice when a company really cares about customer satisfaction. @indochino replacing my suit pants that wore more quickly than they should.
@GiltSupport Thanks for the response, Steve. Won't let me DM you-is there an e-mail address? Love Gilt and never had problems before!
@GiltCityDC -I bought my fiance a mani/pedi deal at Release Blow Dry Bar in June. Their equipment has been broken since! Please help!
spent the morning volunteering at @wjfarm and it was great. now i'm getting to enjoy some of the extra produce we harvested!
@indochino @indochinohelp - I love my new suit but the pants (crotch) are pilling terribly after only 3 or 4 uses-what can I do!?  Thanks!
@DanUrda no love for Seattle at -2.5 or gmen getting 6?
Just made a reservation for @KapnosDC for tomorrow. Can't wait to check it out w/ @ActuaryGangsta @Jennypenny7413 @DrewPerrotta @TMcDougall_
@ActuaryGangsta was trying to help Dayna's parents while I was down in FL. Don't worry, we still have @DIRECTV - they're WAY better!
never heard anything. pretty much as i have come to expect when dealing with @comcast
@ArlingtonVAWeb went to pay what I was told was a $35 no right on red fine to find the fee was $50 AND $65 processing fee! Is that right?!
@HarvardHBS Can an MBA application be submitted prior to all recommendations being submitted or will that appear incomplete?
@Arden_Reed any plans to be in Washington DC anytime soon?
just tried @boloco for the first time. it was awesome. wish there were more of them around DC!
@comcast STILL on phone and haven't heard a human's voice yet.  going on 2.5 hours - i've heard "your call is important to us" 100+ times
@Comcast why have I been waiting over an hr for a service rep? Seems a bit excessive to not even hear someone say hi yet
@USAirways thanks for the quick response, LK!
@USAirways if i have to cancel a $186, one-way ticket. can i just not show up to flight? don't want to pay $200 change fee for nothing-thx!
@LivingSocial I wish you guys could teach every company how to do telephone customer service. Always helpful, nice and solve the problem!
@USAirways I had the best service at Logan Airport yesterday. Maura, the desk agent was such a HUGE help. Great service, no questions asked!
@IndochinoHelp what does it usually cost to send back a suit after getting the remake? you said to choose cheapest and it still cost me $35.
@Marriott, if I book a room using a IATA # (no discount tho), am I still eligible to receive Rewards points for all costs of the stay? Thx!
What gives, @MarriottIntl ? I've had 2 stays last month not post to my account; even AFTER Missing Stay Requests submitted 1 hasn't posted!?
What gives, @Marriott ? I've had 2 stays last month not post to my account; even AFTER Missing Stay Requests submitted 1 hasn't posted!?
Hey, @IndochinoHelp, thanks for the quick response and the great customer service. Computer issues happen - you guys recovered very well!
@IndochinoHelp great! Thanks for the quick help, Mr. Concierge!
@IndochinoHelp please help! E-mailed the website multiple time w/ no response. Need to have work done asap for a friend's wedding! Thanks.
@indochino - Is there another way to get in contact other than e-mail on website? I've e-mailed twice since Saturday and haven't heard back.
@USAirways I'll DM you shortly. Hope you're more helpful than you were last time you asked me to DM you or the EIGHT PEOPLE i just spoke to.
@AmericanAir - hopefully it's not too late and you can cancel your merger. you want nothing to do with @USAirways - THEY'RE USELESSSSS
@USAirways and it's STILL not booked!
I can't believe I bother ever trying to use @USAirways - I should know by now they're impossible to deal with. 1 hr on phone to use a credit
folllow @ActuaryGangsta if ya wanna make madd cashh. That gangsta is a betting guru. Kid is sharper than @DrewPerrotta's headaches post conc
@USAirwaysÂ really? I have to pay a change fee for a flight from NY that I can't even get to tomorrow? Now I missed a wedding and will pay $$
@StateFarm I just received a letter from my new agent that appears to be written by a 4th grader. Why am I paying for premium service!?!
@VidaFitnessDC why so difficult to get removed form your e-mail list. I've asked 4 times, and also "unsubscribed" yet i still get them!?!
@DrewPerrotta - HUGE value in 'no.'  i'll hit that all day long
@newbalance - VERY disappointed in the MX20's.  Been a life long NB lover (20+ pair) but these have fallen apart after 1 month of crossfit!!
@KAYAK Love the new website layout - much smoother and easier to use/adjust.  keep up the great work, kayak!!
@DrewPerrotta @ActuaryGangsta don't bother trying to talk to him now, @drew, he's been "napping" since 6:30
@ActuaryGangsta @DrewPerrotta what you guys think about orlando getting 7.5?? you know i LOVE rooting against anything Philadelphia!
@ActuaryGangsta, @DrewPerrotta  you like the knicks in cleveland tonight? Can they repeat last night's performance??

@ActuaryGangsta @DrewPerrotta @Mjw2884; word. just hit jazz
head still in a fog from the weekend #danandemmaswedding		@DrewPerrotta @ActuaryGangsta  @iamdarnoff @Ashtaad @Eeindc
@iamdarnoff @cochonbutcher @Ashtaad : i'll take 2; book it!
@ToddDurkin - what do you think about Paleo dieting?
@USAirways it's just too bad you have NO customer service!
@mattt1312 I had rnd trip flight booked to ny for passover. need to go week early for grandma's funeral- @USAirways wants $500 MORE now
And @USAirways I can't buy a new 1 way ticket and not use my current DC-NY flight without automatically being kicked off the return?? WTF
All please RT: @USAirways are you kidding me? $500 to change existing flight in order to get home for an immediate family member's funeral?
@CapMacDC the plastic chinese takout containers. they're resealable and close better than the flimsy cardboard ones
@iamdarnoff: you really think so? recovery doesn't even come close??
