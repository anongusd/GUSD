@KamalaHarris I'm surprised you feel that way. You put a lot in prison
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Do you think you know Trump? Watch is going to happen in three weeks and Trump doesn't get the funds. It’s all about setting himself up for success when the lawsuit comes about regarding the declaration. It will be proven that he’s made every last effort to address  appropriately

@SenatorHassan Murdering the helplessness is immoral. Every one who abort their baby is a murderer and should go to prison for capital murder

@oscar_out @global_guitar @dreddlore @hyloguy @TheRightMelissa @drdeblk @realDonaldTrump That is cold. I have an AA BS MBA and have completed all coursework for a PhD.  It's hard for me to gain employment. I had to start my own Agency. Used my home as an office.
@funder Shameful
@iamths1973 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump You shouldn't humiliate the president
@realDonaldTrump Ignore the haters.
We all need to be taught https://t.co/398CRD7AWh
@realDonaldTrump If you didn't do anything wrong stop responding to these accusations. It only feed into them making it worst. People are going to believe what they want. Give it to Jesus and let him respond.
@ButchEmerson @VictoriaLeighM2 @RichardMaynhart @ABC I just ask Victoria Leigh who work the Fields Blacks, Hispanics, Asians Who? Because that's the number one reason the 13 Amendment has that prison work clause in Black reverts back to slavery. "Work without pay. The penalty more stiff when a Black goes before judge than his White

@nytimes This is a travesty! The Justice System is founded on inequality.  punishment for Whites v Black. For example a white man commits the crime of rape he gets probation if punished at all. But a Black is subject to get 25 to life for evn attempted. This is a fact.
@nytimes If he had been a Black Man they would have locked him up and thrown away the key.

@TheNakedPanther @mpgdaniel @KamalaHarris I went back to school at age 46. I have an A A in Criminal Justice, BS in Criminal Justice, MBA and have completed all coursework for PhD. I ended up with 167,000 loans with no way to pay. Yes I was a honor student and my race and age hinders me for high paying employment.
@TheNakedPanther @mpgdaniel @KamalaHarris I was a honor student not i'm was :-)

God give us true love for one another. Help us to protect each other in every way. When we make a mistake and hurt or offend one another help us to be strong enough to apologize to each other and not panic for fear that the person we offended will run and tell people about it. https://t.co/CJ0ggBWaY5

@Dearieme65 @Janet4OH @Jim_Jordan You are right. Sometimes i work a second job to supplement my income. These people pull their food stamp and WIC cards out of their MK, Coach, LV, Gucci bags some wearing their MK watch to pay for their food. I am 64 years work 6 days and ngts to pay my bills &amp; their housing.
@Jim_Jordan A lot of them pull their food stamps out of Coach, LV, MK and many more authentic name brand bags. I know because I have work part-time jobs in grocery stores to supplement my income.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Yes he did
@CNNPolitics @CNN So sweet and thoughtful
@realDonaldTrump You guys right or wrong other countries are seeing this bickering with our president and laughing. We need to stop this. !!Peace in Christ!!
When I said the welfare offices are filled I mean with illegals. We as Americans can't get assistance for them.  The people who are receiving food stamps WIC and money when paying for groceries they reach in their MK, LV and coach bags to get the FS and WIC cards to pay. https://t.co/4NPQtFQKLG
