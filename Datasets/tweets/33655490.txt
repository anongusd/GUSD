Happy New Year! After over 20 years in elected office, I’m excited to begin a new chapter in 2019 as Director of @seuniversity's American Center for Political Leadership. I hope you share in my good fortune and spend 2019 pursuing your passion surrounded by those you love.
Merry Christmas from my family to yours! As this time of year brings our families and friends together, let us remember to appreciate and give thanks for the blessings in our lives.
Today, my work on behalf of RVers, as founder and co-chair of the Congressional RV Caucus, was featured in the RV Industry Association’s Newsletter. I am grateful for their recognition and support. 	https://t.co/5HaLky6wpL
During this difficult time, we find solace that President Bush is reunited with his beloved wife, Barbara, for eternity. May God continue to bless the Bush family and this great nation.
I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of President George H.W. Bush. He was a patriot and statesmen in every sense. Cindy and I convey our sincerest condolences to the Bush family.
As we gather with family and friends this holiday, I hope that you, too, will find the time to reflect on all the blessings that we have been given as a nation.
I am especially thankful today for the men and women in uniform at home in America and deployed across the globe, bravely defending our freedom this Thanksgiving.
I feel confident our best days lay ahead and I am deeply thankful Cindy and I have had the opportunity to raise a family in this country.
Over these years, our community and nation have overcome numerous challenges. Elections have come and gone. The political pendulum has shifted to and fro.
This Thanksgiving, I am spending time reflecting with Cindy about the past eight years, and what a humbling opportunity it has been to serve my hometown community in Congress.
100 years ago today, we welcomed home our brave soldiers who fought along our allies in WWI. Let us remember those that were not able to come home and the brave men and women in our armed services that continue to put their lives on the line for our nation’s freedom. https://t.co/bTd8F9NJjA

Sen. John McCain dedicated his entire life to serving our nation. As a Navy Veteran, a war hero, and later through his service in Congress, he exemplified the best this country has to offer as a statesman. My prayers are with the McCain family during this difficult time.
On this #NationalPurpleHeartDay, my heartfelt gratitude goes out to all of the recipients of the Purple Heart for their service and sacrifice.
Cindy and I have a heavy heart this morning with passing of our dear friend Stephen Gately, a true friend and patriot.		Stephen has made a tremendous impact on our lives and countless others, and we  are grateful for his service on behalf of our state and district.
Happy 4th of July! Let us celebrate the independence our nation and thank the brave patriots who selflessly defend it. God Bless the #USA!
On this Memorial Day, as we gather with friends and family, let us remember our fallen heroes that devoted their lives to protecting our freedom and great nation.
I’ve been honored to serve my community in Congress. Cindy &amp; I have decided that I will not seek re-election.

@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters If consumers really were getting caught in a "debt trap," the data would show consumers "trapped" in the market. 		But Florida, South Carolina, and Illinois each found that payday loan consumers leave the marketplace over time.		That doesn’t sound like a trap.
@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Compare that to reputable studies that bothered to look.		(Economists with the Federal Reserve Board in 2013 did, among others.)		Numerous folks found that over the long term, payday loans provide a net benefit to a consumer's financial situation.
@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Even worse, @CFPB restricted its pool of data by looking at a mere one-year period.		You need a longer period of time  to know how users of these loans behave. Heck, in its own study, CFPB admitted that it needed to analyze data over a longer period of time. It didn’t.
@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters @CFPB ignored the abundance of data available from the states, instead taking a broad view rather than a deep dive into the data.		What they did amounted to glancing at several lenders across multiple jurisdictions with different rules and regulations. That’s not a clear picture.
@CFPB @SenWarren @RepMaxineWaters Not only does the @CFPB's research fail to establish that payday lending is harmful to consumers across the country in the long term, it also fails to prove that this rule might be effective in alleviating that purported harm.
@CFPB If @CFPB is going to regulate, it needs to do so with appropriate data. 		Unfortunately, @SenWarren &amp; @RepMaxineWaters have been misled:		CFPB’s didn’t do anything resembling exhaustive research for five years. They skimmed what little data they cherrypicked.
@CFPB First, let’s consider what payday loans mean for the economy: 		12 million consumers use payday loans. 		60,000 American jobs depend on this industry. 		This isn’t a small portion. Many people who need access to credit get it from payday lending.
The first words Samuel B. Morse used on the telegraph were, “What hath God wrought?”		I suspect the first 911 call was, “WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!" https://t.co/lFaxYNa79u
My op-ed in the Morning Consult today looks at how @CFPB failed to use accurate and complete data when making its rule on Payday Loans. 		You don’t have to love payday loans to believe that we should be careful about regulating in a way that could hurt low-income Americans. https://t.co/waZH7IUPPR

@PaulaOrrino Hi Paula! Properly regulated pay day loans mean people don’t suffer the (higher) expense of a bounced check, a missed payment, or have to turn to less scrupulous lenders. 		State regulators have done this effectively. CFPB took a heavy-handed approach to effectively ban them.

@s_wyan How so? Not a single Republican voted for Obamacare.
@postalrachel False. Congressional members and staff are NOT exempt from the AHCA. (McSally Amendment made sure of it).
@mhall119 Just one? Here's a few: Desoto, Glades, Hardee, Highlands, Lee, and Okeechobee
FACT: 20 MILLION Americans are UNINSURED under Obamacare. Can't fix something that is broken and failed in its promise to Americans.
FACT: Obamacare raised taxes by over $1 TRILLION, including payroll taxes.
FACT: Deductibles average $6k under obamacare. #notaffordablecare
FACT: 1/3 of all counties in USA have only 1 insurer under obamacare. That's not choice, that's single payer.
Fact: premiums have risen on average 25% across the country this year under Obamacare.
@snowflake_not Thank you! I'm thankful for all my staff.
CBO estimated 22M would flock to Obamacare. Oops-they were wayyy off. 300k Floridians had their healthcare plan CANCELLED under Obamacare.
4.7M American LOST healthcare under obamacare, 1/2 the counties in FL have only one insurance option, Premiums in FL will increase 19%.

The top 2% taxpayers pay 45% of tax revenue. With no compromise to cut spending how high of a percentage should we expect the top 2% to pay?
