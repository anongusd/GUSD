@Breeana991 @ConfinedInMind @NoAZenergyTax APS sure is scared.  Hiring bots to do its bidding.  Renewable energy works large scale.  Coal plants in the US emitted 1.2 Billion metric tons of CO2 in 2017.  Cars emit 6 tons per year.  It would take 200 Million cars to match it.  https://t.co/gnBRkGCSLX

@Breeana991 @ConfinedInMind @NoAZenergyTax Breeana Bot, you're wrong.  Coal plants emit 1.2 Billion metric tons of CO2 a year.  A car emits 6 tons of CO2 a year.  It would take 200 million cars to emit the same CO2. https://t.co/gnBRkGCSLX
