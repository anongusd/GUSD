@ryanmauro @DrZuhdiJasser No. A patriotic American citizen (no other moniker required) should displace her.
@JackPosobiec I’m in for a 20 spot! Match me!
@IngrahamAngle Thank goodness she clarified her committed relationship status lest she be overwhelmed by DMs from potential suitors.
@BuckSexton First, he must acknowledge and apologize for his whiteness. Only then (maybe) might he engender trust among all voter potentates.
@Neoavatara @PolitiBunny Media outlets with shareholders and budgets in a capitalist economy aren’t allowed to hire and fire at will? Maybe if they put out a product consumers wanted, there wouldn’t be the largesse of displaced “future software engineers”. This is exactly how a meritocracy should work.
@BuckSexton This belies how much trouble he is in. He also seems isolated as hell. Taking the one man vaudeville act on the road this week from border to border and coast to coast. He might want to retain more counsel and stfu.
@rudeger11 @TheMarkPantano @steph93065 @TuckerCarlson @EthanBearman @TuckerCarlson rarely challenges anyone these days. Why lefty nitwits are lining up because he allows them to spew unchecked nonsense like Mussolini from the balcony.
@briandavidearp @hopecarrane Seems like epoch shattering, highly important work. You gonna measure monkeys gritting their teeth under induced stress as an encore?
I love @TuckerCarlson, however he allowed @EthanBearman to come on his show tonight and blame (are you ready?) RONALD REAGAN for the massive homeless problem in California, without calling him a liar to his face. Stop being a pussy Tucker.

May we all be a s disgustingly pretend- humble, contrite, and introspective as @kirstenpowers when we fuck up.

“I have spent a lot of time concocting a narrative once again proving there is no doubt, anyone in the MSM is a narcissist to the core.” Let’s not forget who the real victim is here.

I love @TuckerCarlson, however his show has become an unwatchable farce where he is ill-prepared to debate morons  (who should be effortlessly dismantled) allowing them to run amok, spew fallacy after fallacy and talk over him while he sits, smirks, and says “huh?”
@BreitbartNews Get used to the propaganda meant to discourage, divide and disillusion. It will be immeasurably huge until November, 2020.
@emzanotti According to police. He led them to the “spot” and immediately pointed toward the camera and stated: “THANK GOODNESS THAT CAMERA IS LITERALLY RIGHT THERE (points) IN CASE THERE IS AN ATEMPTED MODERN-DAY LYNCHING BY TRUMP SUPPORTERS LIKE THE ONE WHICH JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

@Barnes_Law It is absolutely “unconstitutional” to invoke a constitutional amendment in an extemporaneous manner. Just as it is unlawful to misapply the law. Equivocation is a most basic fallacy. The showcasing of this stupidity by so many is shocking.

@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter More like 36 million. We get about 250,000 new souls a year smart enough to leave the “prosperity” and enrichment of the most fiscally irresponsible and populous state in the nation.
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter All 50 states have mandatory background checks. Apparently they do not have background checks for simple mindedness. The rest illustrates my prior points.
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter Glad you agree. Now go put a steak on that eye.
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter CA has third highest state homeless rate. CA residents pay 50 percent more for electricity than the national average. CA has highest state income tax. CA has the highest small business failure rate for ten years running.
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter San Fran (is it in Cali?) has more homeless and street needle addicts than air. As a state, CA students rank 46th in math, 49th in reading. Ca has the highest number of children living in poverty. 58 percent of CA public school students qualify for free lunches.
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter What a synaptic misfire. CA state and local debt, total deficit (from California Policy Center) is estimated at 1.3 trillion. Giuliani (last time I checked repub) left NY office in 2001. CA and NY have lost a net 2.2 million residents since 2007 (tax base leaving).
@Platinum107 @brannon_denise @AnnCoulter Name a US city which has been under dem control for at least 20 years (Philly, chi town, St. Louis, Baltimore, Oakland, San Fran, et al) that isn’t a either a poverty stricken or crime ridden, fiscal nightmare where blacks suffer in droves with worse schools than Sudan.

@DailyCaller Polar bears are highly adaptable and their territories are huge. This is nothing new. Far north Canadian townships have issues as well. More bears equals more competition for food sources and thus, migration.

@BornInventor @TomFitton Again, if one is operating from public donations, it’s not okay to point out how much time is spent “flexing”? His camera time is a soft way to solicit donations. You’ve non sequitar-ed the issue and my original statement still stands. His results to posturing ratio needs help.
@BornInventor @TomFitton There has been as much public preening about the issue by Fitton (See? Here I am in a T-shirt staring off in the the distance) as there has been legal action. In the Los Angeles county settlement, there is no date by which compliance must be demonstrated. Donate for more selfies?

@bengordonshow @StefanMolyneux I would assume so. You begged the question and introduced a false cause, all in the same sentence.
@bengordonshow @StefanMolyneux How about some time within the last 25 years? You’re welcome.
@bengordonshow @StefanMolyneux Actually, by definition, the “present” and the “past” are two different things. But to clarify and reinforce Mr. Molyneux’s statement, white males paid the majority of taxes in the “past” as well.

Darwinian competition prunes those who exhibit the least utility to consumers over time.
@realDailyWire It’s also not worth commenting on given bats will fly from my ass singing “Oh solo Mia!” before it lasts five minutes in the Senate.

@RedState Assuming your question is rhetorical.
@j_desarno @KimStrassel Is there a difference between cynical and “grossly” cynical? Additionally, your characterization is not only entirely false, it lacks support. Lastly, labeling the GOP base as uniformed is laughable given the dem freshman class. Hyperbole: the go to for empty heads.
