@Laurenbug36 @GavinNewsom Lauren, that's not the reason why rent / housing prices are affordable in Texas.  The major reason why is because Texas allows supply to meet demand.

I like the show "Border Security: America's Front Line" on Netflix.  What this show proves is that America is very rigorous and thorough with people who come through legal ports of entry.  But Democrats want to let illegal aliens bypass these entry points and come anytime!  Sad!
@latimes Such a dumb candidate for president.  Total clown.
@Alyssa_Milano I support President Trump's declaration of a national emergency.  You can stand with open borders, but most people don't.
@Nrvlljr12 @paulkrugman Doesn't matter to me.  Obviously we do have a national emergency if even one illegal alien harms any American -- since such an individual was never supposed to be in America.  Any effort taken to prevent future illegal aliens is a good idea.

@ms_arti The state of California, for instance, spends a lot of money on the government-run schools.  And many of these students are here illegally.  With less illegals, it means less money spent on foreigners getting an education, health care, and prison costs.  It's a big win.
@rob_blue It was a nightmare.  I am determined to reduce illegal immigration to zero after the terrible experience.
@ms_arti With fewer foreigners/illegal aliens in our schools, we will save a lot less money.

@emilianopkc @haideledezma @richcocacola In a competitive market, like a car company, the union has to be reasonable because if they make the product too costly by raising wages too much, consumers can buy a different car.  Can't do that with govt.
@emilianopkc @haideledezma @richcocacola There are many organizations, especially in Silicon Valley, that do not have unions but have channels to communicate problems with the firm.

@_rochellec You are welcome!  Always here to help :)
@_rochellec I think taxes on investments are more of an issue for people who like to trade (like me).  If someone buys and sells things often, the taxes could certainly be an issue.  However, for passive investors, I think the tax is probably less of an issue.
@_rochellec There are tricks if you work for a corporation.  You can sometimes borrow against your 401(k) if you need the money.  That way you can keep your retirement goals but also you're just borrowing from yourself. :)
@_rochellec Oh, oops!  Yes, everyone is leaving California.  CA sucks!
@_rochellec In the alternative, you could put the money in a taxable but tax-efficient index fund so that you only pay tax when you sell.  In that case, you would pay a lower capital gains rate but no penalties.  You could also sell whenever you want.
@_rochellec Well, ironically, the tax penalty would be lower on the Roth since you are putting in after-tax money.  With a 401(k), you get a tax deduction for putting the money in, but if you take it out, then that money gets taxed.  So it would be a bigger bill.
@_rochellec 401(k) also has tax penalties for taking it out early.
@_rochellec If you don't wait until you are 59 1/2, then you will pay ordinary income tax rates (which are higher than capital gains) + 10% federal tax penalty, plus whatever California adds.  Huge penalty.
@_rochellec A Roth is tax-free when you take it out.  I think there is a Roth 401(k) too, to make things even more complicated.
@_rochellec No.  You really can invest in aggressive or conservatively in either of them.   Roth or 401(k) says nothing about the kind of investments you are making.  It just impacts the tax treatment.
@_rochellec You can be an aggressive investor with a 401(k) or a Roth.  The only issue is you cannot short stocks in either of them.
@_rochellec You can buy the same things for a 401(k) or a Roth.
@_rochellec A Roth and a 401(k) are boxes to put your assets.  By themselves, they do not affect your financial performance.  What matters is what you put in the box.
@_rochellec It's tax-free when you withdraw it one day at 59 1/2, regardless of how much you've made.  Even if your profit is 5 million, it will be tax free.

@Fitzroy23 @Qin_Jiushao @rk70534 @Ocasio2018 With capitalism, there are a lot of restrictions on what you can charge.  For instance, if I opened a coffee shop, I would love to charge $50 for a cup of coffee.  However, I couldn't, because customers have choices (supply), which would mean demand for $50 coffee would be weak.
@Fitzroy23 @Qin_Jiushao @rk70534 @Ocasio2018 In the case of the CEO who raised the price of the drug 10,000%: the irony is that the guy who did that actually did not own a patent for the drug.  He merely knew that his competitors had to pay for govt permits to compete with him, which takes time.
