@RyanLizza If I understand it correctly. 2.25 miles of replaced wall. Additional 1.8 miles completed. With a goal total of 5.3 miles. 		5.3 miles? Millions of dollars? US / Mexico border is almost 2000 miles.		does anyone else see an issue?		https://t.co/97urmkRe7B
@MattMackowiak Because saying Socialism or Liberal is like discussing sex in the early 1900's. It's just wrong. You cant do it.  		Taboo 		It all depends on how and why.

@EmmaYourFriend It has some of the best Christmas songs that you will never hear on the radio.
it is amazing. Im not on here since mid October, and I lost 1/8 of my followers.
@JDaIey My mom
@GeorgeTakei Why is everyone complaining about the price of the wall. Trump said that he was going to have Mexico pay for it.
@bobsaget Uh ... ice cream. Yeeaah ... always room for ice cream.
@realDonaldTrump What happened to getting Mexico to pay for the wall?
@GlennKesslerWP Didn’t Trump say that he was going to get Mexico to pay for the wall?
@guypbenson Do you think that a member of the Trump staff did that just to get favor from the lgbt community?
@GrianMC @YouTube Just sent mumbo a tweet about a parade float contest. I think you both should set something up.
@ThatMumboJumbo Set up a float parade contest. Build platforms of a certain size. Floats must fit that size. Hermits vote for top 3. Not their own. Most votes win.
Phone crashed mid October. Cant retrieve Apple ID. Contacting Apple, I will be able to get access to ID in 21 days. Then I can send it in to get it repaired. Looking at 4 months without a phone. Nearest store is a 2 hour drive, one way.		How long can you go without your phone?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Replace Medicare for All with Trump , and Democrats with Republicans. Definitely more amusing and truthful.
@nowthisnews Why is it, the first thing we do, we call 911, the lawyer, or throw a punch? 	Before you do, ask yourself , could I be wrong?
@MichaelAvenatti We do. But we can only yell so high up the chain. Beyond that, no one gives a $#!+.
@GeorgeTakei We can do better that a lot of people. But lately, for some reason, it’s about laziness and greed. Correction, it’s been like that for awhile. Lately we have brought back the hate. Make America hate again #MAHA

@AddInfoOrg @sinbadbad I don’t get it. I really don’t. Difference will bring debate, debates give us the opportunity to think in a new way. New ways of thinking allow us to have new ideas. And that allows the nation to grow and truly become a great nation.

@realDonaldTrump Isn’t that what Stormy Daniels said?
@old_worker @shannonrwatts @newscatmathis One of the biggest problems with this case is that everyone wants to make it about politics and it’s not. It’s a rape charge. And should be tried as such.

@BiIIMurray I see you woke up on this side of the grass this morning
@WilliamShatner Beach boys little Saint Nick
@GroovyBruce Yeah. I have $40 to spend between 4 people. I’m building stuff this year, when I find the time.
@Hayden_Mack07 Haa ha
I like this. It’s not just someone throwing out a number, but showing what was said. https://t.co/Psv1whKgIv
@fart How many followers do you have to have before you are classified as a celebrity?

@HamillHimself I saw you on the late show, you said you needed more followers on Twitter. So I looked. You already have a few. Then I looked again. I realized I was already following you. So I looked closer. You’re not following me. You should follow me. ~wave hand~
@spawn89506 @WilliamShatner Ah yes. My bad. Miss read while busy.
@spawn89506 @WilliamShatner If the comment was your region, but the comment was you’re wrong.
@spawn89506 @WilliamShatner No , it’s you’re as in you are
@spawn89506 @WilliamShatner Interesting read. I still stand by my previous statement. I have yet to see otherwise. I’m not saying you’re wrong. Maybe I just have the worst luck in coworkers. Maybe it’s regional. I don’t know. I’m hoping that it is just an age gap thing.
@spawn89506 @WilliamShatner Well so far I have yet to see differ.
@20committee I live on $50k a year that $124k difference. 8 yrs would be almost $1M. Plus investments, interest, spouse income, etc.
@CNN I’m not fond of Trump. He is eating McDonalds, so what.
@MollyJongFast @Mikel_Jollett Fake news
@halleberry But I do https://t.co/IoZyacJtlr
@RepTimWalz Good work
@WilliamShatner Way to early to text. But you get the idea.
@WilliamShatner Older vs younger at work: younger has the mentality that they don’t want to, do the other person can do it. Older has the work ethic of act as though you’re the only one so you have to do it.
@RadioFrontline @repmarkpocan Oh I agree. Although if I was a baker , I would make the cake, but you will have to purchase the topper somewhere else because I don’t carry what you want.
@wesleysnipes When you and your boys are out walking the streets and you find yourselves walking in step. What do you do?
@mattsiegel @samswey @AriBerman Thank you
@RepHartzler Is there any way the people can read this bill?
@omglovefacts @Jasmine_Stagger Looks like a B/W Milky Way
@samswey @AriBerman Where can I read the petition?
@Ncham45 @funder Are you going to put on the big boy pants and converse or just waste my time and through insults?
@Ncham45 @funder Yes, for a reason. You refuse to talk. You want to make irrelevant comments and unmotivated attacks. At that point, conversation you has completely gone out the window. So Yes, moron.
@Ncham45 @funder And with comments not even relevant to anything said?
@Ncham45 @funder Why is it, whenever a simple question is asked, Trump Train riders can only attack and insult?
@GKButterfield Wow. Really? Well he’ll get the jackass vote.
@BrentMorin Relax? Absolutely. Reindeer antlers? I’ll pass.
@USRepRickNolan Can you follow me?
I like to ask people questions in order to better understand the other persons view. Why is it, when asking those aboard the Trump Train, the response is always an attack and insults? MAGA? Really?
@Ncham45 @funder Learn to read. I never said anything about breaking laws. Moron
@Ncham45 @funder What about the problems with PR, California wildfires, highest unemployment since 2010. Or shall we talk about Trump? Russian scandal, everyone working with him being fired or resigning.
@Ncham45 @funder Want to talk about Trump? Still waiting on his tax return. What about the Russian scandal thing? The disrespect that he shows to anyone not affiliated with him.
@Ncham45 @funder Almost 800 pages, filled with glitches that they had 2 hrs to read, translate, interpret, and vote. It’s a mess. Jerusalem? So what. That wasn’t a campaign promise. What about Puerto Rico, California wildfires, highest unemployment since 2010. ...
@Ncham45 @funder ... almost 800 pages of glitches, most of the people voting on it were give 2 hrs to read it, translate it, and understand the outcome of it. It’s a mess. Jerusalem? Was that even a promise? Is that even relevant to the US and the problems right now. ...
@Ncham45 @funder I asked what, so I have a better understanding of what you mean, not to be an ass or try to belittle you. We? We did not vote for him, technically your vote was irrelevant as well. He was voted in by the electoral college. Did you read the tax reform? ...
@JKCorden @taylorswift13 Um yeah, pure sexy
@fart @brianbeutler Nope
@AdriannePalicki Don’t worry, I’m sure there’s a lot of  worshippers of Kelly, waiting for next season.

@funder He has the mentality of a child. When told no , he screams yes
@janetpeiser @meltzinmymouth2 @therealroseanne I don’t appreciate needing it. But I give thanks to those who understand, and want to help their fellow Americans.
@janetpeiser @meltzinmymouth2 @therealroseanne I was on welfare, WIC, Medicade, food stamps education assistance. Once there it is difficult to get out. You end up knowing a lot of people while in those lines.
@meltzinmymouth2 @janetpeiser @therealroseanne And that went to the wrong response
@meltzinmymouth2 @janetpeiser @therealroseanne Education assistance too
@meltzinmymouth2 @janetpeiser @therealroseanne WIC not wit
@meltzinmymouth2 @janetpeiser @therealroseanne I was on welfare, wit, Medicade, food stamps. Once there it is difficult to get out. You end up knowing a lot of people while in those lines.
@SWVRoma @janetpeiser @therealroseanne Yes and no. Sometimes a bully acts like a bully because they want the attention. And the tougher they act, the more attention they get. And that is both Trump and Un. And both countries love their leaders for it.
@KelliThomas3 @SWVRoma @janetpeiser @therealroseanne When I said dictator, that was Un. And yes, Un was throwing the first punch. But, you shouldn’t instigate a bully to throw more punch when you’re supposed to be a leader.
@meltzinmymouth2 @janetpeiser @therealroseanne The little man? Really? He has been trying to cut the benefits my friends and family need in order to survive.
@SWVRoma @janetpeiser @therealroseanne But Un is not a school bully. He’s a dictator, who has isolated his own people so they don’t know what is right or wrong. Because of this, the people are supposed to worship Un. He can’t back down or he will look bad to his people.
@janetpeiser @therealroseanne No. Trump is the one that is acting like a bully, trading insults with another unstable bully. And both want the other to back down.
@therealroseanne Thoughts? He’s a moron. Honestly, no joking, I think he may have psychological issues that are making it difficult to do his job. Which is why he is acting like a moron.
@RadioFrontline @repmarkpocan Agreed
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump ~clapping ~
@repmarkpocan It’s not anyones business who someone else loves. If it’s against your religious beliefs, then you already know that when the time comes, God will deal with it. If you don’t like it then don’t be a part of it. But stop the hate.

@RickeySmiley It’s all about reactions. That’s what they want. Say that it’s pathetic, shake your head, and walk away. But don’t react, it’ll bring more.
I hear Trump’s threats to Un and Un’s threats to the U.S. ... has anyone tried getting these two to sit down and talk?

@RepRubenGallego Thank you
@ILM126 @b0yle Thank you
@eltonofficial @Beats1 Missed it. Will there be YouTube clips?

@CNN Why can't the big boys have a sit down and find some common ground?

@RepHastingsFL @POTUS Priorities are lacking.
@NBCNews Has Trump tried to talk to N. Korea?
@RepMaloney @SenateGOP It should not be this difficult.
@WPBF25News This is one of my plans. I'm glad to see a corporation that see what I do.
