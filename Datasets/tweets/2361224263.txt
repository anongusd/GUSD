If anything, Americans need the Pledge of Allegiance now more than ever.		Moreover, we need to reject the mistaken notion that love of country comes with a hatred of others.
It is notable that the modern American ‚Äúelite‚Äù‚Äîthose who work in media, in corporate boardrooms, and run for office‚Äîcome from institutions that have become hostile to the very idea of patriotism that is anything other than adherence to left-wing social and political views.
Unfortunately, many of our schools also seem to be ground zero for the effort to delegitimize patriotism and assimilation.		The only ‚Äúassimilation‚Äù taking place in that environment is in bludgeoning students into becoming progressives‚Äînot Americans.
This needs to be countered ferociously, and it can be, by citizens who have had enough of these egregious assaults on free speech.
Instead, they often give free rein to radicals who violate the First Amendment rights of others with little consequence, who shout down those who disagree with them and actively suppress debate.
Are our colleges and universities, funded and supported by the American people, really doing a good job of producing able and productive citizens?		One would hope, but no‚Äîmany of these public institutions are fostering neither critical thought nor a patriotic citizenry.
At one time, it was just the opposite. 		Expressing devotion to country demonstrated loyalty beyond one‚Äôs tribe or ethnic group. If America (a massive, ethnically diverse country) abandons this principle, it will only face more racism, more group antipathy, and more tribalism.
In the face of these attacks on our history and reason for being, Americans must take a concerted stand against efforts to undermine public displays of patriotism, which are under assault by those who, wrongly, see attachment to country as hateful or racist.
Plus, it‚Äôs rich to hear blistering critiques of the racism of people in earlier times when, for instance, little is said to condemn the bigots and anti-Semites that infect the far-left today.
Perhaps it‚Äôs OK to glean the best aspects of the past rather than every aspect		Most Americans understand this, but the militant modern left insists on zealously purging any figure or concept from history that doesn‚Äôt conform to its ever-evolving, impossible to define standards
If that was the case, it would be doubly problematic for American progressives. 		After all, the progressive movement of the early 20th century was steeped in eugenics and ‚Äúscientific‚Äù racism.
While many early proponents of the pledge undoubtedly had racial views that would not be in accordance with what we believe today, nothing about the current recitation highlights that or means that we must also adopt those ideas.
Contra the @SantaBarbaraCC president and the angry activists at the school, Balch initially created a pledge of allegiance as an antidote to nativism and racism. 		And as a man who fought in the Union Army and quoted abolitionists, he could hardly be defined as pro-slavery.
He wanted new Americans to have an intellectual and emotional attachment to their new country.
Balch intended it to be a way to show immigrants that they were welcome in their new country as well as provide a reminder that they inherited from others a great tradition of freedom that often came with a steep price.
Quoting famed abolitionist activist Henry Ward Beecher, Balch noted that a pledge to the flag was a demonstration of devotion to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
Those whose parents and ancestors had been treated as serfs in their home countries would be expected to be citizens in their new one.
... ‚Äúevery child and teacher under its roof is a true-hearted, earnest-minded, loyal-spirited American, well understanding the great responsibility which citizenship confers, and fully prepared to assume that responsibility when the time is at hand.‚Äù
Balch, who, along with most of his generation, knew the value and price of freedom‚Äîand of his nation‚Äîcrafted a pledge to the flag in the late 1880s.		He intended this simple declaration of patriotism to deliver a ‚Äúsign‚Äù to the world that...
Col. George Balch, a Union Army veteran, developed a pledge for the poor and immigrant schoolchildren he taught in New York, which became the basis for Bellamy‚Äôs pledge.
Congress added the words ‚Äúunder God‚Äù in 1952, after a public campaign from the Knights of Columbus.		But the Pledge of Allegiance actually has an older antecedent...
First off, the modern pledge is attributed to Francis Bellamy‚Äîa Christian socialist who wrote it in 1892 for a celebration of the 400-year anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus.
The Pledge of Allegiance itself has a long and complicated history‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not what the left believes it is.		Here‚Äôs a thread to cut through the confusion... https://t.co/CnsX3wwO1O
