@sherrydeatrick @kenvogel @POTUS Challenge coins are used by the military especially Green Beret , Special Forces &amp;  Ranger units .

@realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Yes we do so leave @realDonaldTrump  !! Neilsen just chased out of a restaurant by an outraged public ! Sessions being chastised by his church for possible expulsions .

@WhiteHouse Americans need to tell their Congress &amp; Senate members to get off their butts &amp; remove Trump from office !! He is corrupt , crooked, a pervert , pedophile, in dereliction of his duties , abusing his office , profiting from his office personally, treasonous &amp; a security risk to US
@realDonaldTrump You look weak to NK . The picture of you saluting the NK General has been posted to NK propaganda tv saying you , as Commander in Chief , of the U.S. military bows down to the superiority of NK military ! This shows the U.S. as weak with a weak Commander / Pres. You are a fool !!
@MichaelAvenatti Thank you for fighting for the children !
@MichaelAvenatti Happy Father's Day to you ! May you have a blessed day !
@PalmerReport Yes he is , no one wants to work with the Trump Admin. because they have to a lawyer to cover their butt !! Trump throws anyone under the bus to save himself. He is so corrupt &amp; dangerous to our country ~ he needs to go !
@SenatorHeitkamp A better way to deal with it is to get off your butts in the Senate &amp; House of Representatives &amp; remove Trump from office. He is incompetent , corrupt, unstable , abusing his office , lies daily &amp; is a danger to the United States. Do your job &amp; get him out of office !!

@realDonaldTrump Here is the info on Canada &amp; Trump.             https://t.co/0bB24Ygfky
@realDonaldTrump Actually I think Prezzie Trump is upset with Canada for re branding his signature hotels after he won the election. Canada felt Trump's remarks about Mexicans &amp; Muslims  made were not cultural acceptable in their society . Trump has held a grudge against Canada since then.
@SenateGOP Get off your butts &amp; take control of this country now ! Trump needs to go before he gets his way &amp; becomes our dictator !! Wake up &amp; kick his butt out !! He's a traitor , lies constantly , profits for himself over our country ... He's a corrupt slimeball !!
@Newsfanatic @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Yes , he is pissed Pres. Obama earned one &amp; that eats at his soul ... I think he would go mad if he doesn't get one by hook or crook. Sad man ...very sad &amp; destructive .
@realDonaldTrump You really want to know what's sad is the world laughs at you ! Daily ! I watch news from around the world ~ India , China , Pakistan , England , Saudi Arabia , and all over the U.S. ~ the only FAKE news is Fox News Entertainment ! It's so much crap it's pure State run propaganda
@realDonaldTrump Our country's biggest enemy is YOU Prezzie Trump ! You are doing Putins bidding . You are undermining the World's security , World's free nations coalition &amp; well being , alienating our allies , trying to destroy free press &amp; destroy our freedoms &amp; constitutional rights !Dictator
@SenateGOP Republican Senators please get off your butts &amp; get Trump outta here fast !! Before you are serving Putin instead ! Trump is committing treason &amp; obstruction of justice. He is tearing down the free world trying to be a dictator !
@realDonaldTrump You are a real sick puppy ! You need to be removed from office immediately !! You are corrupt , treasonous , crooked , lying , abusing your office , &amp; selling out the U.S. to the highest bidder beyond Russia !!
@realDonaldTrump The only "False " &amp; "Fake" statements &amp; facts are from you ! You lie so much , you don't know what the truth is anymore. Plz resign before you damage our country anymore !!
@realDonaldTrump Prezzie Trump , you are a threat to national security &amp; need to be replaced fast. You are so ignorant &amp; selfish. I don't know how you survived this long. Plz resign ! Now , before you do anymore damage to our country.
@realDonaldTrump You need to be removed from office now before centuries of work &amp; trust among the world is destroyed. You are committing treason , corruption &amp; other crimes against the US . You need to be removed &amp; unfit for office. NOW!!
@realDonaldTrump Putin's plan to destroy the US globally is working thru you Trump !! You are destroying our position in the world &amp; alienating us from our allies. Allies that have supported us in war , humanitarian issues , keeping Russia in check &amp; helping balancing of power in the world stage.
@realDonaldTrump All the high crimes seem to be committed by your campaign advisors , you , your family , your cabinet members , your attorneys , your in laws , your financial advisors &amp; everyone you surround yourself with. Hmm notice that all of the crimes involve you ??
@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. President ~ in case you slept thru it ~ you raised taxes giving the top 1%er your tax break ~that's on you not Dems. Stop playing golf , get your house in order with all your croonies spending including 007 &amp; other non necessary big ticket items &amp; security . Wake up !!
@realDonaldTrump Why do you turn everything on yourself ?? You are a sick puppy ~ can't wait for you to be impeached or imprisoned  !! The world would be a much better place...Calling Mr. Mueller !!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Oh that explains it ~ no one with an education watches Fox News ENTERTAINMENT Channel ~ it's not real news . It's the show host's  interpretation &amp; opinion of news he or she heard . It's designed for people who can't interpret it themselves. Never watch it ~
@realDonaldTrump Get rid of your heavy spenders like Pruitt &amp; others like him spending Government money like water to entertain his 007 image of serving our government. Stay home in WH from golfing for the rest of your time in office &amp; we'll save billions !! Get your office in order ~resign
@realDonaldTrump The only corruption there is ~ is you &amp; your cronies you surround yourself with. You all are liars, corrupt , treasonous &amp; destroying this country inside &amp; out. Not only is the U.S. laughing at you so is the world. You need to go now !! You have no morals or decent scruples..
@realDonaldTrump I wish the Presidency had a strong a morals clause as Rosanne Barr's contract had...wait it does ~ The Constitution ~ I know Trump has violated each part at least once ~ get him out !!! Now !!!
@realDonaldTrump President Trump is alienating the U.S. so he can make juicy financial deals for himself &amp; family members... He's corrupt to the bone if he can make $ .13 off anything. He needs to go now !!!
@realDonaldTrump He is Pardoning all these felons who plead guilty so he can recruit them for his next campaign. He only wants the best scum for his next run. Lol but Mr. Mueller will fix that...
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Face it your base is shrinking ... your crowd size is low ~ under 1,000 , your time is setting as President !! You can only lie so much before even an idiot won't believe you anymore...the time is coming. Anything from Mr. Mueller yet ?? Can't wait to hear from him !!
@realDonaldTrump You are one sick puppy ... You owe the world many apologies for you corrupt, immoral , unconstitutional behaviour , being rude , lying on everything &amp; demoralization of several nationalities. You are a racist &amp; immoral human being. You need to apologize &amp; are due no apologizes!!!
@RomneyJudith @realDonaldTrump Who need enemies ...
@realDonaldTrump Your friends are falling fast around you but Manafort is hoping you will pardon him so he is going to trial. Lol. But the laugh is on him because you are joining him in jail. Your list of crimes is too long to list here...

@realDonaldTrump 22 school shootings so far this year on your watch !!  $300 million given to your campaign by the NRA ~ you sold out those killed , wounded &amp; damaged children in those shootings... I hope their cries for help &amp; dying  screams haunt you for the rest of your life. You deserve it ..
@realDonaldTrump If coal is so clean let's heat your offices , homes , party venue with coal &amp; see how you live with it. Put it in your children's &amp; grand children's rooms if it is so clean &amp; safe. Not willing to trust it that far,  huh ?
