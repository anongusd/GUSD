@RichardDedor @jonbecker I'm pretty sure it's a "built-in" template now that I look at it again: https://t.co/SD3GD5t77F
@jonbecker We use a Google Sheet. I can share the template with you if you want. YNAB was a bit too...esoteric for me. And like Tim, we had issue with Mint not maintaining automatic links to our accounts. So, if manual was going to be part of it, we figured full-manual with Sheets.

@ckg33 That's why they change so little. Everybody always has something to argue about. Off to bed!
@ckg33 I don't mind the first four üòÇ You're a purist. I'm a filthy casual. The more MM the better. Only reason I don't think they should add another entire round is that it would make conference tourneys moot for the most part.
@ckg33 Nah. One spot isn't enough. Regular season a) doesn't actually matter and b) has fluff games already. Cut off those FBS/FCS games and make it 16 teams. Plenty of time in the calendar for that.
@ckg33 I'm not convinced 8 is enough. They'll just do P5 conference champs and 3 P5 at-larges. I don't believe UCF would have been invited this year if CFP committee was asked for their "best 8."
@ckg33 For sure, but it has much less impact on the tourney overall. Hard to argue a team in the Sweet 16 shouldn't have been in the tournament. You know if it were me I'd save the at-large bids for non-blue bloods :)
@ckg33 I'm a casual fan of both, but I watch a ton more football than basketball. I enjoy MM much more than CFP, though. CFP feels orchestrated or clinical compared to the Madness. Top-down vs grassroots to stretch it a bit.
@ckg33 I wonder what MM would look like if it were all automatic bids. Regular season + tournament title. There are trade-offs everywhere.
@ckg33 I would agree with you if the regular season actually mattered in CFP. It doesn't, which is why CFP should be at least 8 if not 16. Four in CFP leads to "well, they lost but they're actually better *overall*" thinking.
@ckg33 2014 OSU lost to Va Tech	2015 MSU lost to Nebraska	2016 OSU lost to Penn State	2017 Alabama lost to Auburn
@ckg33 I mean...that's not true though. Every year there are teams that shouldn't be in the CFP if "the regular season matters." Alabama lost, didn't even play in SEC title game, and still made it. That's ridiculous.
@ckg33 I guess I'm not really sure what the logical conclusion of what you're saying is. Syracuse might get beat big somewhere down the line so we should just start with the Elite 8?
@ckg33 FCS makes a playoff work. Timing "issues" are self-imposed.
@ckg33 Yes but that's because they won their way through the tournament, not because the committee assumed they would have, which is what CFP does. Every other year a G5 team beats a P5 in one of the big bowls.
@ckg33 It's not a cop out to say, "then beat them." The main problem with CFP has always been that we don't get to find out who's actually the best team in the country. UCF spotlighted that this year.
@ckg33 They're wholly incomparable. If selection committee chose four "best" teams for March Madness it would look exactly like CFP: same teams, same conferences, no room for the little guys.
@michaelmiesen Better believe it
These guys are battling Dunk City for my favorite March Madness team of all time right now.

One of my goals for spring break was to work through my Inbox playlist. Getting there.
Rose Thomas learned that somehow and I guarantee she didn't learn it *solely by being punished.* In the same way that time management isn't learned (or taught) by deducting points from a late essay, these lessons aren't learned (or taught) by doling out punishments.
'Student breaks rule so student must be punished' ignores all of the depth and complexity in the relationships between administrators, teachers, and students. 		It's not the consequence that's important, it's the conversation.
I wish @rpondiscio or @DTWillingham would "role play" the conversation teachers and administrators should have with students about the consequences. That's the meat in this thought. https://t.co/fAqGqF1qfE

@stumpteacher Settled on, "Can you tell us more about your decision to name the restaurant Malo knowing what that word means in Spanish?"
@stumpteacher (The place serves "Latin cuisine." So we talked about how to phrase the question so as not to offend.
@stumpteacher Them, brainstorming questions to ask the marketing director: "Why did you name the restaurant something that means 'bad'?"
@stumpteacher I was just talking to my students about this today, in a way. We're visiting a restaurant in town tomorrow. Name of the restaurant is Malo.
@stumpteacher It helps a lot with that kind of stuff. Also, something to be said for the teacher reaching out and establishing that feedback loop.
@stumpteacher I have parents I've known for a few years now and work in a similar industry to what I teach. Others that I haven't. Same with friends.

@TweetByDavid @flyosity Agreed totally on that.

@TweetByDavid @flyosity Apple just showed that they‚Äôll push ‚ÄúSeptember‚Äù back for the X.
@TweetByDavid @flyosity I‚Äôm of the mind that ‚ÄúiPhones/iOS update in September‚Äù should be an internal goal, not a rigid launch no matter what deadline.
@TweetByDavid @flyosity I appreciate the dialog, David. ‚ÄúDelaying‚Äù the launch of iOS 11 or launching iPhone 8 with iOS 10 would have been fine with me.
@TweetByDavid @flyosity Those who care would have appreciated a fully-baked iOS 11 when it launched and those who don't wouldn't have noticed a "delay".
@TweetByDavid @flyosity Most of the common bugs still left in iOS 11 have been known throughout the beta. So yes, they should have been fixed before launch.
@flyosity Maybe after months of beta testing, iOS 11.1 is the one they should have launched with?

@herz6kids Have to suck it up and do it anyway.
@herz6kids I've had that happen with videography projects. Find out after agreeing that project will be much less creative than I agreed to.
@herz6kids Well yeah, that's just unprofessional and not acceptable. Once commitment has been established, suck it up and do the job.
@herz6kids Is it a job where the worker could be terminated at any point?
@herz6kids to say no to a client, that the job/project they're offering isn't the right fit. Does that fit with plumber example? Likely not.
@herz6kids That said, (and to play devil's advocate a bit) one of the things we've learned from our business partners is that sometimes it's right...
@herz6kids Seems you're equating job with task. I was thinking job as in...well, job. Like a new position.
@herz6kids Plenty of other considerations that are just as -- if not more -- important than money. Culture, location, support, autonomy...
@herz6kids Obviously I'm missing some context here, but I'll engage. No, "I'll give you money" is not enough to get me to take a job.

@jonbecker By ‚Äúwork‚Äù I mean in the context you‚Äôre looking for (calendar/reminder notifications). W/o my phone, my Pebble tracks steps, tells time.
@jonbecker I don‚Äôt know enough to help with standalone smartwatches. I‚Äôm pretty sure there aren‚Äôt many/any that work on their own w/o primary device.
@jonbecker on the Pebble and then when the phone/tablet gets a notification it bluetooths it to the watch.
@jonbecker But that‚Äôs the same for the vast majority of smartwatches. On Pebble, you tell the Android app which notifications you want to appear...
@jonbecker OK. The Pebble won‚Äôt do anything smart unless it‚Äôs within bluetooth range of the tablet. It‚Äôs really a secondary display (in a way).
@jonbecker Does he have a smartphone?
@jonbecker That‚Äôs the one. You can save $10 with the refurbished one (https://t.co/yPl8pvPhUu). No warranty either way ;)
@jonbecker Everything he'd want is between the phone and the watch. The app was updated since the buyout to cut the Pebble server cords.

@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed I don‚Äôt have a stance on how your district spends its money. I‚Äôm pointing out how you‚Äôre selecticely skeptical of purchasing laptops‚Ä¶
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed You asked in your post if you're being too skeptical. I don't think you're being skeptical enough.
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed What‚Äôs the justification for all teachers having laptops?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed It‚Äôs not and I‚Äôm not making that argument. I‚Äôm asking why you are being selective.
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed I have yet to see someone question the purchase of teacher laptops. Only student laptops. Am I wrong?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed Was ‚ÄúDoes this improve achievement?‚Äù investigated for teacher computers? How TQ money is spent?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed Are you asking for ‚ÄúDoes this improve achievement?‚Äù research when building buildings, buying busses‚Ä¶?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed Is this the first multi-million dollar purchase you‚Äôve *asked for research on*?
@iowa_ed @Chris_Liebig @mctownsley Or does buying tools for students have a higher bar?
@iowa_ed @Chris_Liebig @mctownsley Do you ask for research when technology purchases are made for adults?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed Give some examples and show me the blog posts you‚Äôve written asking for a research base, please.
@iowa_ed @Chris_Liebig @mctownsley And teachers taught without computers, too. Did you ask this question of teachers getting computers?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed What percentage of the budget is that?
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed But "Are the right devices needed to learn and create?" is not a question. At least, it's not a question asked for adult purchases.
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed The underlying questions you ask about privacy are warranted and good to grapple with before, during, and after device deployment.
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed Not *which* tools, but the need of the tools.
@Chris_Liebig @mctownsley @iowa_ed I‚Äôm still curious if you put this much thought into buying yourself the tools you need.
@Chris_Liebig @iowa_ed Your post brought up selectivity in regards to administrators. I‚Äôm pointing out your selectivity.
@iowa_ed @Chris_Liebig Where are blog posts demanding research for giving all *teachers* in your district laptops to get their work done?
@iowa_ed @Chris_Liebig Yes

@JennBinis Because I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm more likely to share with you after this conversation :)
@JennBinis Are these unwritten rules (and judgement of those not knowing/following them) leading to people not sharing?
@JennBinis Ahh. Someone should write down all these unwritten rules. I didn‚Äôt realize ICYMI was a conversation starter ;)
@JennBinis I forgot the @mention. So, 100 characters. Do I tell someone who has assessment nerd in bio why I‚Äôm sharing assessment post? :)
@JennBinis is that better than ‚Äú[Headline for the my blog post I already wrote] [link]‚Äù?
@JennBinis Lay out a formula for me. We have around 120 characters. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre into assessment so I thought you‚Äôd like to read this [link]‚Äù
@JennBinis Thanks. It went well last time. This is a different group of students so I‚Äôm excited to see how they do.
@JennBinis You‚Äôre an educator on twitter. If another educator shares an article about education with you, you‚Äôd be unsure of the purpose?
@JennBinis If someone else wants to take the 10-second interaction (or single twitter mention) as an annoyance, that‚Äôs on them.
@JennBinis sharing good stuff. I did the same thing three weeks ago and had multiple people thank me after the session.

@JennBinis @mctownsley no explanation is necessary. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like you to read this.‚Äù
@JennBinis @mctownsley and they want specific people to read it because they respect those people and they have influence.
@JennBinis @mctownsley are you serious that you don‚Äôt know why? They wrote something they‚Äôre proud of and want people to read it.
@JennBinis @mctownsley ‚Äúdon‚Äôt send too many tweets about the stuff you‚Äôre creating because it clogs my timeline.‚Äù Oy vey.
@JennBinis @mctownsley or even if someone has a ton of followers. People should be proud of what they‚Äôve created.
@JennBinis @mctownsley Too much why? Why is ‚ÄúI made something cool and I want people to see it but I don‚Äôt have a ton of followers‚Äù bad?
@mctownsley I think that falls into the ‚Äúothers are sharing your stuff‚Äù thing.
@mctownsley there‚Äôs a difference between promoting yourself and promoting the stuff you‚Äôre a part of.
@mctownsley the pushback I often see on ‚Äúself-promotion‚Äù is from folks with an established audience lamenting *others* self-promoting.
@mctownsley Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at: if you‚Äôre doing good stuff, it needs to be shared. If others aren‚Äôt sharing it for you, then share it.
If you‚Äôre involved in great stuff, please tell everyone about it. Be loud and proud.		Don‚Äôt worry about people poo-pooing ‚Äúself-promotion.‚Äù

By tough, I mean that it‚Äôs hard to fail at 6th grade English stuff. So, are we asking them (and ourselves) to do failable stuff?
For our students, the classroom is a public space. Telling them to fail is easy. Modeling it ‚Äî failing in front of 11-year-olds ‚Äî is tough.
Make this a habit: someone refers to failing being an integral part of learning, ask them to name the last thing they publicly failed on.

This from the Drake who is hosting a standards-based grading symposium in June. Hard for me to reconcile.
None of the FAQs for Drake‚Äôs new +/- grading are ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I find that interesting, especially because it was the first question I had.
Do you re-check what you know with any regularity? Do you question your own assumptions and conclusions? What‚Äôs your process like?

@Chris_Liebig I agree. And if you ever find yourself in Des Moines, please visit. https://t.co/zKm5VRfayi
@Chris_Liebig I agree about where we disagree :) From my vantage, the system (all around Iowa) is moving toward students &amp; experiences.
@Chris_Liebig I keep bringing up both BIG and APEX because we‚Äôre not ‚Äúsomething to adopt.‚Äù Different examples of the system progressing.
@Chris_Liebig We‚Äôve had 40+ school districts visit us at APEX. Cedar Falls just joined the CAPS network.
@Chris_Liebig The beauty of both BIG and APEX is that we are a part of the system. The system can and does change. Just needs catalysts.
@Chris_Liebig Sounds boring. I‚Äôd rather give you the experience of visiting our space ;)
@Chris_Liebig Again, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but you‚Äôre leery of arguments for those who are doing it but only present hypotheticals.
@Chris_Liebig There are a lot of hypotheticals that may play out, but you haven‚Äôt visited BIG and brushed off APEX with ‚ÄúGood stuff, but‚Ä¶‚Äù
@Chris_Liebig For others, that‚Äôs not their top priority. Competencies doesn‚Äôt change that.
@Chris_Liebig Teachers who want their students to have divergent experiences will make it happen in any situation.
@Chris_Liebig The blog post you shared that started this whole conversation talked about how competencies aren‚Äôt a new idea.
@Chris_Liebig None of what you‚Äôre bringing up is new, though. Standards aren‚Äôt new. External assessments aren‚Äôt new. Gov‚Äôt wasting money‚Ä¶
@Chris_Liebig creative, non-traditional, choice-based, activities and projects our students did (and loved).
@Chris_Liebig It‚Äôs hard to convince me because I taught with the CCSS for 4 years and it was never cumbersome and never stopped the many‚Ä¶
@Chris_Liebig A lack of willingness to take risks and be subversive plays a much larger role than any set of standards.
@Chris_Liebig I don‚Äôt agree that standards/competencies necessarily lead to a lack of autonomy in instruction and learning experiences.
@Chris_Liebig What I‚Äôm getting at is that even with autonomy, we could (and do, often) end up with boxes to check.
@Chris_Liebig students should be learning in a given course. And 15 is by no means too many expected ‚Äúlearning outcomes‚Äù.
@Chris_Liebig Is it mainly who is creating the competencies that you‚Äôre pushing against? Any teacher should be able to elucidate what‚Ä¶
@Chris_Liebig What are we comparing competencies and assessment to? Harder than‚Ä¶? Assignments and points?
@Chris_Liebig If you‚Äôre talking specifically about tacking c+a onto the traditional paradigm, then yeah, I can see hurdles.
@Chris_Liebig Ahh. Yeah.
@Chris_Liebig Sounds like an analogy to high school :)
@Chris_Liebig Maybe big projects aren‚Äôt the best way to go about it? (I obviously know nothing about your course, so just asking questions.)
@Chris_Liebig That‚Äôs possibly true. The entire program was built from scratch to be all projects. How often do you meet? For how long?
@Chris_Liebig and do something about it. So, I like sharing about it :)
@Chris_Liebig And I don‚Äôt mean to imply that we‚Äôre doing things perfectly. I just had the chance to take my frustrations with the system‚Ä¶
@Chris_Liebig Here‚Äôs a post I wrote about our class this fall: https://t.co/CVhM30iaCn
@Chris_Liebig But that cycling back through standards happened in my 6th grade English classroom too where I had 3x the standards I do now.
@Chris_Liebig Each project doesn‚Äôt have room to assess every standard(/competency), but over the course of the semester, each gets hit ++.
@Chris_Liebig Ah. Yeah. My group of 17 from fall semester completed 70 projects of type in those videos: https://t.co/TKdja3FrtH
@Chris_Liebig I‚Äôm in a privileged place, though, so I‚Äôm not speaking for states and districts that are still all-in on high-stakes.
@Chris_Liebig in the consciousness of elected officials at this point. (Whether they agree we‚Äôre over-testing, it‚Äôs in the conversation.)
@Chris_Liebig Absolutely (again). AYP got canned with ESSA, though, right? (https://t.co/VH3pziBj7M) I feel like over-testing is at least...
@Chris_Liebig Interesting question, but I‚Äôm not convinced a) that will happen or b) it‚Äôs a reason not to continue pushing.
@ckg33 I agree about the apathy. I wish people would see UCONN in the same way we‚Äôre seeing the Warriors.
@ckg33 Then again, I‚Äôm all #teamchaos in the men‚Äôs tourney. If the blue bloods never won another tourney, I‚Äôd be happy.
@ckg33 Probably just a personality difference then. I‚Äôll watch the finals to see if they do it again. I‚Äôm intrigued by total domination.
@drewacp Gives you more time to read ;)
@ckg33 Yeah‚Ä¶I just go back to: would you be watching either way?

@ckg33 Good points. Do you think those lamenting UCONN are mainly fans being turned off or people who didn‚Äôt watch WBB anyway?
@Chris_Liebig ‚Ä¶traditional classroom.‚Äù And that‚Äôs true.
@Chris_Liebig When you see what BIG does and what APEX does, it will be natural to think ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt translate directly to the ...
@Chris_Liebig Absolutely see where you‚Äôre coming from. Both APEX and BIG are new, not tacked-on, if that makes sense.
@ckg33 I can‚Äôt see I saw much backlash against Alabama football. They feel just as inevitable.
I‚Äôd venture those of you actively not watching UCONN dominate aren‚Äôt watching any other games either.
Did those lamenting the downfall of women‚Äôs NCAA basketball see that every game yesterday was an upset?
@ckg33 Not just you :) What I saw that was intriguing is lamenting UCONN but no mention of all the upsets yesterday.
Number of folks in my timeline complaining UCONN women are too good. Well, actually none of them used the word good. Just complaints.
@Chris_Liebig I don‚Äôt mean that flippantly. If you‚Äôre genuine with that question, @IowaBIG is doing just that in your neigborhood.
@Chris_Liebig Yeah‚Ä¶you should make time to visit @IowaBIG. You seem to have some strong views about these ideas.

@wmchamberlain Just saw this go through my timeline :) https://t.co/LcjfjQDrGb
@wmchamberlain That‚Äôs why I said we should look at output as opposed to input. To ‚Äúcode‚Äù means you should be creating a script/app/etc.
@wmchamberlain I think you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find any codebase that has zero copy/pasted code in it. That‚Äôs why Apple provides libraries.
@wmchamberlain I think you‚Äôre being overly picky here. Using Automator, Workflow, to create scripts or Drafts to create actions is ‚Äúcoding‚Äù.
@wmchamberlain What percent of a program would need to be ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhand written‚Äù for it to be coding? Do all libraries need to be re-created?

@dcox21 I realize I‚Äôm saying all this having not listened to it, but that‚Äôs point. I wanted a story that I didn‚Äôt already know was a story.
@dcox21 do you listen to The Memory Palace? (To me,) those are historical stories, not political. Bergdahl isn‚Äôt interesting w/o politics.
Now that I‚Äôve said that, I should say that Reply All may be my favorite podcast and I‚Äôm looking forward to season 3 of Serial.
@bradleychambers There‚Äôs definitely a difference between ‚ÄúEveryone should take a programming course‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe should host HoC events.‚Äù
@bradleychambers That‚Äôs HoC :)
@dcox21 political. No thanks.
@dcox21 So, all that, plus I do not enjoy politics at all. I don‚Äôt see the Bergdahl story being one that becomes ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù so it‚Äôs just..
@dcox21 Season 1 was great in large part because there was zero context for listeners. It was a brand new story.
@dcox21 I was put off that Serial would choose to do a story we‚Äôve heard of as well as one where the narrative can get lost in politics.
I thought ‚ÄúThe Cathedral‚Äù was Reply All‚Äôs weakest episode so far and was disappointed that Radiolab featured it. Many better eps to feature.
I think Bowe Bergdahl and ‚Äúhis story‚Äù are so off-putting that I didn‚Äôt make it more than 5 minutes into the new season of Serial. Yuck.
A couple of somewhat-contrarian views I feel the need to get out of my system:
@bradleychambers because everyone will not program, we shouldn‚Äôt take an hour out of a few days to focus on logic and critical thinking?

@SocialPS Was hoping you had tangible gift cards...have them in a secret stash anywhere??
@dcox21 Because trying to convince someone to change their political philosophy 140 asynchronous characters at a time is not for me.
@dcox21 Is this the part where we go, ‚Äúthis would be interesting to discuss in person over an adult beverage or two, but not here.‚Äù
@dcox21 At some point can‚Äôt we just politely agree that we see things differently and move on so as not to harm a relationship?
@dcox21 But if we disagree philosophically (before we can even discuss the merits of the actual argument) is either of us ‚Äúclose minded‚Äù?
@dcox21 philosophically, I think public education should be provided/preserved/protected by the gov.
@dcox21 This is the part where that ‚Äúclose minded‚Äù thing comes into play, right? Am I the one being close minded if I just say that...
@dcox21 Ah. Then, yeah, I‚Äôd call public education a right. Which takes us back to square one. I get your thinking.
@dcox21 Yeah. That‚Äôs logical. Whether it‚Äôs a right or a privilege doesn‚Äôt matter as much to me.
@dcox21 There‚Äôs the rub, I suppose.
@dcox21 Education doesn‚Äôt fall under that third one? :)
@dcox21 Have a list in mind?
@dcox21 Sounds like you disagree with Senator Sanders on whether education is a right, then :)
@dcox21 Do you consider education a right?
@chartier Hey thanks for engaging. I appreciate that you're up for conversation.
@chartier Maybe this summarizes my thinking: In the same way that one OS X device is all I need, my iPhone is all the iOS I need.
@chartier (Hope it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm not saying iPad/iPad Pro *shouldn‚Äôt exist*. Just struggling to see the need for a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù.)
@chartier As someone with a 6s in my pocket and 13‚Äù MBP in my backpack, I don‚Äôt see the role an iPad would play.
@chartier I shoot it with my iPhone, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to edit there. The workflow gets unnecessarily complex on iOS.
@chartier I still feel like I‚Äôd want a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù when I get done walking around. Example: I‚Äôm doing a 1-second-per-day video of my year.
@chartier Definitely. I have to get my mindset past the marketing speak. Look at what it is not what it‚Äôs said to be.
@chartier they were really just using their MBP as an iPad the whole time.
@chartier That‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôm struggling with seeing people say an iPad Pro will replace their MBP. If that‚Äôs the case, seems like‚Ä¶
@chartier Keyboard shortcuts?
@mctownsley Can‚Äôt pass it up!
@j_allen I‚Äôm just very comfortable with my routine on each of my devices and iOS stretched onto a big canvas hasn‚Äôt cracked that routine.
@j_allen If I‚Äôm unitasking (reading, scrolling Twitter, reddit), I don‚Äôt want the size of iPad ‚Äî even mini.
@j_allen I‚Äôve had full-size iPads, I‚Äôve had an iPad mini‚Ä¶I always end up going back to my laptop or my iPhone.
@j_allen but iOS‚Äôs current state is not a pro OS.
@j_allen iPad Pro is half pound lighter than new MacBook. I guess my complaint is really with iOS. It‚Äôs a mobile OS. It‚Äôs been stretched.
@j_allen I think iPad Pro could replace any laptop that could be replaced by an iPad. But that‚Äôs the rub. Then it‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù just an iPad
Which some of you may want! That‚Äôs terrific. But as someone who has an iPhone and a MacBook Pro, what would the iPad Pro replace?
In the same way that without optimized apps, an iPad is just a big iPhone, w/o pro apps, an iPad Pro is just a big iPad.
I don‚Äôt at all doubt that iPad Pro has the power to run FCPX on it. Would I want to touch FCPX? No. But that‚Äôs not the point.
Do geekbench scores matter for drawing apps? For Flipboard? For Photos? I still don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs Pro about the iPad Pro.
The iPad Pro isn‚Äôt going to replace a real computer no matter how fast it is until it has real computer apps.
I‚Äôm a little lost on why the power of the iPad Pro is so mind-blowing. Have Apple/Adobe talked about bring FCPX or AE to it?

@spencerideas @DanAgins @royanlee That would be interesting. Now the analogy is ‚Äúoverused Instagram filters.‚Äù That‚Äôs a constraint.

@spencerideas @DanAgins @royanlee Seems like the analogy would be your computer not letting you type a story about vampires.
@spencerideas @DanAgins @royanlee I see the equivalent as ‚ÄúThere are too many tweets about ____. You can‚Äôt tweet about that anymore.‚Äù
@spencerideas @DanAgins @royanlee I just mean that 140 characters and 6 seconds are a limitation. Being unable to take a pic is binary.

@agiletortoise Understood and I recognize that we in education have a habit of swinging the pendulum from one end to the other.
@wmchamberlain Holler if you hear me.
@wmchamberlain Don‚Äôt hold your breath‚Ä¶
Do I still have a blog? Seems like I have something to say about teachers and free/paid services. Maybe I should spit it out. @wmchamberlain
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher Time for this old man to hit the hay. Thanks for letting me push on you tonight. It‚Äôs been a while :)
@pernilleripp That‚Äôs a good point. Many don‚Äôt have access to devices to blog often in 30 days. Maybe push @kidblogdotorg to add some time?
@pernilleripp I don‚Äôt think 30 days is inadequate. You do. Difference of opinion :)
@stumpteacher That‚Äôs good to hear. I didn‚Äôt get that message until now (see: https://t.co/53MxL9w5qH)
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher The expectation that things for teachers will (and should) always be free is what I‚Äôm pushing back on, I guess.
@stumpteacher But it‚Äôs not free, so ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt promote is as a free product‚Äù just seems like a weird thing to say. I don‚Äôt mean to be snarky.
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp Sure, which goes back to the communication issue, which is not what I saw as your main concern from first tweets
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher I assume they ran out of venture capital or saw the writing on the wall.
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher What‚Äôs their revenue stream if not making it a paid product? They cannot legally serve ads to their users.
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher More than one thing as in services? I pay for plenty of services that I value: LastPass, Evernote, iCloud‚Ä¶
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp I own all of @agiletortoise‚Äôs apps even though I don‚Äôt use them all. Same for @tapbots
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp If the product is quality, absolutely. I find ways to support devs all the time.
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp I agree that‚Äôs true however, I was hoping that those with big influence could work to change that @wmchamberlain
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp What if the people these groups really respected were pushing for developers to get paid?
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp Chicken/egg?
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher That‚Äôs where we disagree. Most teachers spend more than $4/*week* on coffee.
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp Well, Josh, of course you won‚Äôt‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not free. :)
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp This tweet didn‚Äôt make it seem like you‚Äôll still be standing by them: https://t.co/53MxL9w5qH
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher making you say you won‚Äôt be preaching their product anymore.
@pernilleripp @stumpteacher It was free when you were pushing it. I see your frustration with communication but seems like it‚Äôs the $$ ‚Ä¶
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp Totally understand that. Great chance to educate the people you‚Äôve been sharing it with.
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp I pushed @wmchamberlain on this the other day. Folks with big influence should be advocating for devs to make $$
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp ‚ÄúWhoops. Looks like they changed their model from free to completely affordable. Glad they‚Äôre now sustainable.‚Äù
@stumpteacher @pernilleripp Free is unsustainable, especially for a service catering to a demographic they cannot serve ads to.

@wmchamberlain if something was the recommendation when it was free and now it‚Äôs priced reasonably, it should still be the recommendation
@wmchamberlain that ‚Äî ‚Ä¶teachers won‚Äôt pay‚Ä¶ ‚Äî needs to change.
@wmchamberlain from your initial tweet I responded to, it seemed you were moving on from Kidblog now that it‚Äôs paid, like it‚Äôs not an option
@wmchamberlain I think you should use your influence to recommend quality developers get paid for their work :) Kidblog offers 30 day trial
@wmchamberlain why not recommend teachers pay for quality services? $30/year is completely reasonable for any teacher.
