@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski Do giving them some guns in the 1980s started 911? U dumb as shit.
@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski Ok your complete idiot, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all.
@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski We supplied weapons to him in the 1980s which backfired. I‚Äôm saying if we didn‚Äôt intervene he would be alive running an international terrorist group that would most likely kill more innocent Americans.
@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski No, I would do what we‚Äôre doing now by training the Afghanistan military and instituted a well run democracy.
@JacobCantRap @KyleKulinski Your taking it out of context. Bin laden orchestrated 911, and had housands of followers that killed thousands of US citizens and soldiers. There was a reason we intervened.
@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski Really? It took the CIA over a decade to find him in the midst of two wars!
@IhMaw2cs @KyleKulinski Because there‚Äôs still insurgents and after what happened in 2011 with ISIS, we can‚Äôt risk leaving again.

@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs right I just want to hear a source.
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro Source?
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy Really? Taxing the rich 85% to 95%? You do realize they start to tax the middle class like in California? The gas tax, soda tax, etc
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro They claimed asylum first- didn‚Äôt come here illegally.
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro Generation z is conservative. https://t.co/HVOFbxIq2u
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro Tax cuts, obama care repealed, bigger military, Renegotiate nafta, building a wall, etc
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy It doesn‚Äôt matter if their more old- millennial are more left
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro How so?
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy I voted for him because I agreed with his policies.
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy I live in Los Angeles- and our economy is very good it has been since the 1950s (when it was Republican) however, millions are leaving to Texas and Arizona (including companies) because of high taxes.
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro How? Most Cubans are Republicans. https://t.co/9Em0ibrg3z
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy Taxes- we would have to tax the Rich an insane amount and cut military spending, social security, food stamps, welfare, etc... taxing the rich isn‚Äôt enough and taxing them at a 85%-95% is not good for our economy.
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy I rather have a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio.

@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy That‚Äôs gotta be the biggest BS I‚Äôve ever heard! He (Yale professor) has no actual evidence and is speaking opinion based. He literally called Trump supporters as smart as five year olds!
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy Sorry- I misspoke (writing to fast). However the dems plan for universal healthcare would be 32 trillion over ten years and universal healthcare hasn‚Äôt worked effectively or efficiently anywhere!
@That1WelderGuy @DarkKingZoro Quarterly? When was the last time that happened in US history- also it was a slower recovery then the Great Depression!
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy A universal basic income system would fail even worse the Obamacare! 32 trillion dollars doesnt just come from nothing!
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy Really dude? Obama GDP didn‚Äôt even grow one quarter.

@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy Yeah and who passed it? Dems not Republicans! There‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs called Obamacare!

@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy My premium went up and I lost my healthcare because of Obamacare
@DarkKingZoro @That1WelderGuy GM is closing the plants because the cars (check Cruz and 2 others) aren‚Äôt selling well- not because of the tariffs. And 3,000 of the workers are being rerouted.

@christysevans @OyVeyAngryJew @TomiLahren Trump doesn‚Äôt take the annual 400,000$$ a year and he goes to his own golf courses- Saving Americans millions (unlike Obama) and like I said the tax cut is the reason the deficit gone up- Trump however wants to cut foreign aid, government programs, etc
