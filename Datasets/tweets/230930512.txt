RT @bylindsayhjones: May we all find something we love as much as John Elway loves 6-foot-6 quarterbacks
I’d rather have a veteran Super Bowl winning QB than a rookie who still has to figure things out. The real question is - how much $ we paying Flacco?!  https://t.co/XwaxESpxG1
Wow... what’s next?  https://t.co/NPcqLmdHaW
If the news doesn't report the facts (ie, truth) - how do people get informed in order to be heard. They try to. Silence the people.	Localize disruption. Target leaders of disruption (quietly take action).	Deploy scare tactics &amp; political cross-talk. Control volume. #Truth
Socialist France has police turned against its own citizens, citizens turned against their own police: People v People. But, our Controlled Media must prevent mass awareness of what is happening. #MainstreamMedia #MSM
Would we even know of #Yellowvests if not posted by individuals on social media? #FakeNews tries to control narrative by not providing coverage - the protests in EU go against the narrative that majority of people are for globalism, open borders, &amp; mass immigration. #WakeUp
Transparency is the only way forward. Transparency is the only way to prove to the public that everything sold to you as truth was nothing but a fake narrative designed to keep, you, the people, powerless, and keep them, in control [i.e. in power]. #Transparency
They want to keep you poor and in need of gov assistance. Bigger the gov, the more CONTROL they have, the more POWER they possess. When you're in need, you're weak. When you are weak, you're not strong. When you are not strong, you do not FIGHT.	As real as it gets. #TheAwakening
A free-thinking 'logical' person who draws conclusions based on facts are, put simply, a threat to their control/power grip. All they care about is control [i.e. power]. With control comes personal gain. #FactsMatter
If you dare to challenge their narrative are you cast out [banned] by society as a threat/conspiracy theorist etc..? Are you cast out by members of your own family? ‘DIVIDED’ 'Group-Think' THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO THINK FOR YOURSELF. #ThinkForYourself
Do they count on the fact that w/ work, family, stresses of life, etc. that the typical person does not have enough time to research topics for themselves &amp; therefore would believe narratives projected in the echo chamber WITHOUT the need for facts or substance? #Research
Psych101: If you hear &amp; see something over &amp; again by multiple (supposedly credible) news agencies, elected officials, actors, documentaries on TV, movies, internet, social media, foreign press etc. all pushing the same narrative/conclusions…what happens? #FakeNews

@kyleco Ok one week granted, the next request will be two weeks, and on and on. We know how this will play out... if you give a rat a cookie 🍪
@kyleco Ted Cruz addressed Feinstein’s delay to involve the FBI in a confidential bipartisan investigation, Grassley confirmed this process could have been accomplished. 60 days she had. Why did Ford delay in coming forward?
@kyleco She’s flown to Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Hawaii, &amp; Tahiti, but was afraid to fly to DC?
@kyleco Why did Ford lie about flying on airplanes to the hearing when she does it frequently for vacations? Why is she making $500k on go fund me? Why didn’t the Dems initiate and confidential FBI investigation 60 days ago when Feinstein first received the letter?
@kyleco Why can’t Ford remember a single detail of the events besides laughing and a hand on her face? Date, Time, Place, anything?
@kyleco So the FBI will magically make Judge recall events? Or is this just another delay tactic? Joe Biden admitted the FBI will only interview, they don’t reach conclusions. Why didn’t anything come up in previous FBI background checks. He’s already worked in the White House under Bush
