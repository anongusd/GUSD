@HillaryClinton No. This country feels like it's under attack, because your utopian dream is being dismantled brick by brick. You despise freedom of any kind. You Demoncrats are only happy when a bloated government bends the will of the people. You care about nothing and no one.
@AltYelloNatPark He wasn't trained properly on Appendix carry. There are plenty of safe holsters and conceal carry methods where the gun will never go off accidentally. I carry every day and train to draw safely while eliminating a threat without collateral damage.
@Newsweek Whatever. When he leaves office he'll be a trillionaire with all the defamation lawsuits he will have stacked up against 90 percent of the media and businesses. Oh, and we'll have a big beautiful wall, smaller government conservative heavy supreme court, world peace, and no Ocare
@AOC @RashidaTlaib You're an idiot. Listen to the full exchange. She clearly backtracked after she accused the wrong person of racism. You disgusting race-baiter. There is no racism compared to the sheer amount of false racism claims. The little boy who called wolf to often was eaten by the wolf.
@RealCandaceO @MichaelCohen212 Yes. Nuke him.
@AOC A living wage is what you get when you decide to stop working minimum wage jobs and find a profession.
@rxscooter @sandybayes1 @AOC The government cannot manage our money.
@sandybayes1 @AOC I have the facts. It is you that doesn't see the road to good intentions is paved with theft, imprisonment, and destruction. While the intent was to help the middle class it gave the federal government the power over the people and grew out of control.
@AOC @hmcghee I got it. All the Leftists book a flight with Elon to Mars and do all the social engineering and climate change work your hearts desire. Let me know when you leave. Nevermind, I'll know. Common sense will return, people will be nice to each other again, and people won't complain.
@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Um... let's see. Venezuela is a failed state and dangerous to the people that live there. Iran is a country with a terrorist regime on the necks of it's own people for the benefit of war and the expansion of Islam. So it's time for puppet leaders or hit them hard.
@sandybayes1 @AOC Our country has had big socialist moves and they have hurt us more than we will ever recover from. FDR was very destructive to this country because of his New Deal. He bloated the government and started us down the path of our current tyrannical and bureaucratic system.
@AOC The same
@AOC No. We're not. It's the Leftist utopian dream. The problem with radical dreams is they're not based in reality. So it will fail miserably or backfire and you will get oppressive Socialism the likes of Russia.
@AOC Yeah, because more jobs is evil. Give me a break.
@LeftAction So says the left-wing nut job that watches CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, HLN, and Al Jazeera.		You're stuck in a Leftist echo chamber!

@seanhannity Lol. She is a gift from God to expose lunacy within the (DSC) Democratic Socialism and Communist party.
@Newsweek The GOP is not rooted in racism, bigotry, intolerance, slavery, anti-semitism or stripping freedom from the American people. All these problems are the definition of the Democratic party. It's time the world realizes the Democrat agenda.
@dcexaminer Lol. If anyone believes that, they are the problem with the U.S.A.
@SheepdogSmokey @Acosta Acosta is an active combatant for the Democrats.
@AOC Give up. You're arguing economics and policy, but don't have any idea how either work.
@PattyMurray Mr. Barr is exactly what this country needs as Attorney General. Watch out Bill, Hillary, Barack, and Eric. The law is coming down on you soon.
@PattyMurray Yes, there is. A big beautiful wall would end many humanitarian problems when it comes to poor people being shuttled like cattle through dangerous areas, and reduce the risk of rape and human trafficking by way of the southern border.
@AOC The planet has an ever changing climate. Scientists have proven that our planet should have an average temperature of about zero degrees Fahrenheit. If it wasn't for greenhouse gases in our atmosphere we would be an ice planet. It truly could go either way. Too hot or too cold.
@funder Why are you so pathetic?
@AOC If you want to help the climate, flush your irrational plans and make electric cars cool and obtainable to everyone. If you use government as a bully to force an agenda it will fail every time.

@Ocasio2018 True, we should have just carpet bombed Iraq and Afghanistan in response. Socialism doesn't work either through just spending those trillions of dollars on social programs would just create dependency. Socialism = liabilities and stagnation. Capitalism = income and growth.
@billmaher You don't recognize your country? I watched Obama dismantle America piece by piece with eloquent lies and social manipulation. It's the Leftist distortion of culture that caused us to elect Trump. And we're going to do it again.

@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Your enthusiasm is misguided.
@hilory @shannoncoulter @ACLU Also... no business should be retaliated against because they advertise with a public figure the social injustice warriors have deemed bad.
@hilory @shannoncoulter @ACLU Ridiculous if you think Alex Jones incited violence because he posed a viewpoint. The cure to violence is more speech, not less speech. No person or organization should be banned unless they call for and direct violence.
@RealJamesWoods @ghostofvangogh1 Firing squad.
@shannoncoulter @ACLU Not the same. Social media companies allow use and do not give consistent reasons for deleting accounts. The real reason is they don't like the message. By discriminating against message they are editorializing the content. Yet they are exempt.
@shannoncoulter @ACLU No. It's a the slippery slope when a private company decides who to ban. They should be sued for using editorial privilege when they are exempt from having to follow editorial procedures.

@SenWarren The Democrats are the most corrupt political party ever to walk the planet. @POTUS exposes your lies, double speak, and wavering so called standards. Democrats and the lackey media outles have been exposed.
@karendeyoung1 Read your article with @jdawsey1 about clearance cancellations, and it is an example of why I (a Trump @POTUS supporter) cannot trust the media to report the news with out infecting it with bias. It's Trump derangement syndrome. It's a Leftist sickness.

@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks I don't want him to reach across to Dems, but if the GOP fail to act and he does try to get a half a loaf of bread I won't bash him.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Stalemate my ass. This is failure to act. It's not hard if they want to act. Go nuclear and start passing freedom caucus bills.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Do you really think that after the display by the Senate over Obamacare? I don't think you believe that.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks If Congress passes the ultimate conservative agenda and Trump vetoes it. You are right about everything. If not. Blame the GOP.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks No. Untrue
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Are you not paying attention? Congress can't even repeal Obamacare. That isn't on Trump. No tax reform. Not on Trump. No wall. Not on Trump.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Again... I'm not jumping on the Trump hate train. It was a bad move, but he will sign the good bills into law. I blame the GOP.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks He wants to be liked, just like every other President, except maybe Washington, Lincoln, Coolidge, and Eisenhower.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Why are you blaming him? Do you want a conservative agenda? Turn your attention toward Congress. I just told you they are holding up reform.
@pastormarkburns @HLNTV @CarolHLN Keep the statues and erect a black civil rights leader or famous black hero right next to them.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Trump wouldn't need to transition if Mitch would change the rules to simple majority and get that wall funded. GOP = Bought and Paid
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks Republicans are giving up a once in a lifetime situation. They could pass the ultimate conservative agenda and Trump would sign it all.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks I can see that, but Congress is clear on what the agenda is. If they weren't feckless Trump wouldn't need to go to the sister.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks It's called bad Trump. Hillary would've ushered in Liberalism for decades. Although this Congress is doing just that.
@BamaDan78 @SouthernKeeks You are wrong.

@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump All good picks for those departments 	EPA had become weaponized 	EDU had become bloated and ineffective 	HUD same as above
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No. Wrong. People being connected to Goldman Sachs means nothing. The swamp is the political elite playing the game. Trump disrupts that.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You don't need details		Cut taxes.. personal and business	Repeal Obamacare	Build a wall	End unfair trade	Deregulation
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Yep your right. They don't stipulate who would leave the market voluntarily. Hence, the number isn't accurate
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Ok. I believe you. Not really
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If you try and fail then have to file it just means you tried. The fact that he filed several times means he doesn't quit.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Filing bankruptcy doesn't make you a bad person I personally know dozens of good people that have filed bankruptcy several times.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No. He has a clear plan. He stated those plans on the campaign trail. It's the embedded swamp that is creating chaos.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No. That's inaccurate. Trump has done nothing to give Putin anything he actually wants. Putin invaded 2 countries under Obama.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You number is a little off. Almost 7 million of that number would choose no health insurance with choice. We had healthcare before Obamacare
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Keep telling yourself that
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump LMAO. That's not true.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No. That's wrong. What do you think Putin is getting? He's getting nothing.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No it's not. Your wrong. The government cannot manage money efficiently and cannot manage care humanely. Everything govt touches is ruined.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I think we should just repeal
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump True, but what about the millions saved in hundreds of unfilled govt positions.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump That does cost money true. But he's not flying to Hawaii 4 times a year either
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump He's not helping Putin. By dismantling all those agencies to bare bones it benefits us. It gives us Liberty.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I don't care who he's borrowed from and neither should you. Obama gave the U.S. more debt than all other Presidents combined.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Not just me. It's literally half the country.Yes teamwork is important, but so is personal responsibility. Govt control needs to be limited
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I'm sure his brand is taking a bump. But because he's not taking a salary and hasn't filled hundreds of govt. positions he's saving millions
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No he's not here to get rich. He is rich. He's dismantling the Fed which is utterly Constitutional.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Thanks, but Liberals cannot fix the country. 	I want government out of healthcare.	I want government out of most issues.	I want a flat tax.
@Qwarktastic2 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Here's the facts. The GOP are feckless. Trumps agenda will turn back all the negative things Obama has done to this country.

@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I read it. It shows how government regulates so that only big business can survive and absorb and deflect. All due to the over regulation.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I know how America can prosper. The sad fact is... Liberals don't and think they do.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I don't just disagree. I know people don't want to pay for anything else, and they are getting tired of having the gov in their business.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker You're right. That's why it so easy to be a Democrat. It's not hard to sell "free stuff" it's much more difficult to sell responsibility.
@Zimmers_0 @LatinXAmericano @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker BTW. It wasn't luck. Only a liberal would take a look at someone that made a successful life that started out in poverty and claim luck.

@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I'm not surprised. Getting "free" stuff is always more popular than personal responsibility.

@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker No. For all
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker That's because we don't use government properly.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker This country is about the pursuit of life, liberty, and property.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Just like food and water is not a right.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker It is not a right. It is a service.
@LatinXAmericano @Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Your viewpoint is twisted.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker You're correct. I don't think you know how free healthcare works. The amount of people going to the doctor would be insane.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Oh no they don't. Your information is absolutely flawed. Twitter is the only place I've seen so many people wanting government to take over.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker No it's not, because I'm willing to accept some theft. The Left wants more and more.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Our unfair business environment is the fault of the Left because only very large businesses can absorb excessive regulations and taxation.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker No. I made two. Unaffordable to the U.S. and government control removes liberty, freedom, and choice.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Why? Because they cannot afford it. Do you want nationalized health care?
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Because the people deserve to have it that way. The government taking taxes is theft. Liberals want more theft. I want less theft.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Health Insurance should be purchased just like Auto insurance. All the rules should apply equally. Pick your coverage, pick your deductible.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker OMG. you are hopeless. Failure is part of life. You cannot and should not try and stop people from failing. It is how we grow.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Which part?
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Great Britain's NHS charges each of its 65 million citizens 5'000 pounds / year and it's not enough. How much would 393 million cost?
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker If a state cannot pay for Medicaid for all. The federal government has no chance in hell paying for 50 states.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker California tried to vote on Medicaid for all. They couldn't afford it. Why do you think that is? Vermont can't afford it.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Health Insurance / Healthcare doesn't have... well, shouldn't have a middle man. Government should only participate in oversight.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I fight for freedom and choice. You fight for handouts.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Socialized healthcare in this country would be astronomical. Every time you give control to government you minimize choice.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Countries that have socialized medicine have between 29 and 60% tax rates. The population and defense spending makes a difference though.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker It would not cut taxes at all. It would increase everyone's taxes, and they would continue to rise.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker It doesn't save anybody anything it takes from everyone. Government run Healthcare is substandard. I know first hand.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker No. Im not. You miss the point. Government should Not be  in charge of the people. Every time you want to be a SJW you limit free choice.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker You don't need information. It's common sense. There are 323 million people in this country. Based on that, how much would single payer be?
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Government is a necessary evil. We need to limit it to its core.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Not to mention... it's 13% too high!
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker 33% would not be enough if we had single payer and subsidized companies to increase wages. Even without war.
RT @AnnCoulter: Only racism can explain why this woman isn't an engineer at Google ... https://t.co/3STVIB14rR
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker The true danger is putting government in charge of people. Don't even try to say the people are government. That's false.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I know Liberals don't mind taxes. You wouldn't mind paying more. I want to pay less. Anything over 25% of my money is too much.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Yeah. Where do you think the government gets all the money for  everything the government has taken over?
RT @johncardillo: How deep does the Deep State go in DOJ? https://t.co/atrDC5TPsX

@Frank_K_Jr @kimoco @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 Don't have figures because we don't have nationalized healthcare. It doesn't take a mathematician to know a larger population/more expensive
@Frank_K_Jr @kimoco @luckybecky77 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 On this you are correct, but we don't have to nationalize healthcare to correct that issue.
@kimoco @luckybecky77 @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 It is not being selfish to expect people to support themselves. It seems you are paying off your own guilt for being okay with it.
@luckybecky77 @kimoco @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 Are you comfortable supporting people that could support themselves?
@luckybecky77 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 Not fortunate. All my kids work full time jobs and go to school full time. They pay for their own education. My oldest graduated owing $496
@claimguy1 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 Simplified tax code. Flat tax. 15% individual, 20% corporate. 0 tax breaks.
@kimoco @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 Everyone here wants more government assistance for the people. That would require more taxes. At least 50%
@Inked50 @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @kimoco @Catheri67491792 We already pay some. The policies in this thread would require half.
@kimoco @luckybecky77 @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 Cutting a monthly check isn't empathy or unconditional love. It's undermining a persons ability to care for themselves.
@Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 I don't believe that at all.
@Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @luckybecky77 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 My oldest finished with 2 degrees biology and environmental management, none of my children have acquired any student loan debt.
@Frank_K_Jr @luckybecky77 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 That's good. I have 6 children. They all have worked all through high school. All but 1 has gone to college and paid their own way.
@kimoco @luckybecky77 @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 I'm glad you're a mind reader. I will not support anyone that refuses to support themselves. Even my own children.
@Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 We are a hybrid society. I understand we are a capitalist/socialist country. I am fighting to keep us from going full tilt socialism.
@Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 Wrong
@otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 This entire thread is filled with people that are willing to hand over half of their income for the greater good, but won't question method.
@otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 You just made my point. If you don't fight back everything will be funded by taxpayers and run by the government.
@kimoco @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @Catheri67491792 You help thy neighbor by providing a way out, not monthly indefinite support.
@luckybecky77 @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 Me too, but just like I wouldn't cut my kids a check every month. I am willing to provide short term aide, motivation, and help moving on.
@otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 No. Just a limited time supply of welfare and food stamps
@Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @luckybecky77 @Pajjr2016 @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 You ignore most of the Bible then. Christianity as a whole is not Socialist. It is very much personal responsibility and personal giving.
@luckybecky77 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 I never said people don't have the right to exist. But in America you do it under your own steam. We have a safety net. That's enough.
@otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @kimoco @Catheri67491792 I believe that 100%
@otto_maddoxx How much would my taxes increase under single payer?
@Inked50 @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @kimoco @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Oh is that what that means. I want personal responsibility and less government control. Whatever threatens that is propaganda.
@Pajjr2016 @Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @otto_maddoxx @kimoco @Catheri67491792 I agree with that and for the most part I have Libertarian view points, but when any side starts affecting my check we have problems.
@otto_maddoxx Are you sure? You're for government run Healthcare. Are you for welfare? Against income inequality? Government regulated soda sizes?
@otto_maddoxx I have definitely learned a lot from Otto today. He is immersed in a set of figures to support a failed ideology. We won this election.
@otto_maddoxx It is great. It shows the ignorance of so many over the attributes of socialism in the begging and the demise at the end.
@Frank_K_Jr @Inked50 @otto_maddoxx @kimoco @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 The left doesn't deal in facts though. You deal in manipulated propaganda.
@Inked50 @kimoco @Frank_K_Jr @otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Because it is.
@otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 When this country goes to single payer, and I'm sure it will. It will be unaffordable. Government will always claim there's not enough money
@otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 No. I am not arguing feelings. I argue facts. Your "facts" have no bearing on a system that's no in place.
@Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx And I disagree wholeheartedly.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Then apologize for getting frustrated. We obviously do not agree on any policy. Good day sir.
@Pajjr2016 I don't hate you. I think your belief system would ruin the country.		You think my belief system would ruin the country.	We are at an impass

@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 That has nothing to do with flat tax	I make 100,000 pay 10,000	You make 1000 pay 100 	That is absolutely fair tax.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 And so the insults come out.
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 Liberals always call people what they are in the mirror
@Pajjr2016 I believe in government oversight. You know how it was polluted? Company buys politician, politician looks the other way.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Again. Who made the tax code so complicated that. A flat tax would end all deductions. And I'm all for flat rax
@kimoco @Inked50 @otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 They did. And we need government oversight. Not government control.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Thanks to the fight between free market and socialism. The U.S. Obamacare made healthcare more expensive. What aren't you against it
@Pajjr2016 Good. You get it. Finally. Government is a necessary EVIL. We must quash it whenever possible.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 We cannot. And as long as I have breath in my body I will fight socialism until my last day. Income inequality and private healthcare. 👍👍
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 No. We do not need a National Healthcare system. No way
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 I agree with you there. Pharma is out of control. But that's because of FDA and other regulations. Only big companies can compete.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 It costs each person 5,000 per year in GB. Population 65 million. 5,000 per year in America wouldn't  cut it. Population is 323 million.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 That's good news. I'm happy for you. I grew up poor. No insurance. Went to the free clinic 5 times because I kept falling off shit.
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 That's too bad. How much did it cost American taxpayers?
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 Oh it cost you. How do you think healthcare is funded in Canada?
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Good. Smaller populations. I doubt things would go so smoothly here. Especially when Americans would pay 60% of their income to fund it.
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 I'm glad you like it. You might not like it when your 80.
Why don't you send this to someone on Medicaid. It would actually be more relevant. https://t.co/DVAKUVndnf
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 I'm paying for it, my employer is paying for it. There is no subsidy because money is not given its just not paid to the government
@CindyLLovejoy @Pajjr2016 Maybe with Leftists
@otto_maddoxx @truthserum48 @dbactnow @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Preexisting conditions don't matter in employer based insurance pools or group plans.
@truthserum48 @dbactnow @otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 I don't want government run Healthcare. Obamacare put more control in government hands. I want choice and freedom to have it or not.
@Pajjr2016 You're right. But I want them to make a profit because I don't want the government controlling healthcare.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Most people would drip their insurance. If we still have Obamacare that hurts everyone.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 What are you exactly arguing? Do you want the tax exemption gone? Fine. I'm cool with that. Let's remove the employer tax exemption.
@Pajjr2016 It has everything to do with population size. Healthcare costs money. The more people you have the more it costs. Period
@otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 Democrats and Republicans don't want a flat tax. Why do you think that is. It's called kickbacks. It's why politicians come out millionaires
@otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 @Catheri67491792 Here is the facts. We are overly regulated and need to simplify the tax code. There would be no debate over most things at that point.
@Pajjr2016 @otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 When I have stated something over and over I get frustrated. Sorry.
@Pajjr2016 Great Britain charges 5,000 per year per person and it's not enough. Their population is 65 million our is 323 million. 5 times more.
@Pajjr2016 If we went to a national healthcare system we would need to charge 30,000 per person per year.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 America has 323 million. America would need to charge 30,000 a year to be equivalent and we would need more $$
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Ok. I read it. The problem is the government decides. NHS costs taxpayers 5,000/year and the need more. GB has 65 million.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 If we deregulated health insurance and simplified the tax code there would be no need for a tax credit.
@Pajjr2016 You remind me of a kid that wants a pet tiger, but has no clue when it gets big enough it will kill you.
@Pajjr2016 No. Your thinking is flawed. You want healthcare funded by taxpayers. The government then decides people's care. People lose choice.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Boy you are slow. That's how much the government does not receive in taxes. It's not a cost. Medicaid is a 545 billion dollar cost (2015)
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 Funny. That's what Leftist ideologues should do. Somehow. I know I AM right and Right, and the facts are on my side.
@Pajjr2016 I start out with all the Leftist sources.		Wall street journal 	Huffington post 	USA today	LA Times 	CNN		then I go to the moderate	FOX news
@Pajjr2016 Maybe, but I ask myself what I believe and why every day, I doubt you do the same.
@Pajjr2016 No it doesn't. Different cultures and lower populations. The only country I might be willing to look at modeling is Switzerland.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 The employer receives a tax break in order to PAY for a group plan. The employee the PAYS for the group plan. You are slow.
@Pajjr2016 @kentwalker84 @Catheri67491792 Dismantling the safety net? No. We have turned the safety net into a temperpedic mattress with a 50" HD tv, high speed internet and a beer.
@Pajjr2016 We had insurance before Obamacare. If we got rid of all government ties to healthcare this country would be so much better off.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 I've read that. I sent you the facts. BTW. The fact that you think employer tax credit is bad and Medicaid is good tells me all I need know.
@Pajjr2016 I read many news sources. Please tell me the name of a real news source. Chances are you don't know they are all biased and spread agenda.
@Catheri67491792 @otto_maddoxx @Pajjr2016 You are brainwashed. The fact you don't understand how dangerous Obama was and how much more secure we are under Trump. BTW I was for Cruz.
@Pajjr2016 Wrong. Again. Sorry you don't know much. How much time did you spend in war?
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Close 260 billion, but employees and employers are paying the same. Medicaid takes in 2.79 for every dollar spent and cost us 545 billion.
@Pajjr2016 Wrong.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 Yep. And thanks to Obamacare I pay 100 dollars more per month and I have lost 3 medications that my insurance no longer pays for.
@Catheri67491792 @kentwalker84 @Pajjr2016 No. They were laughing at us when the apologetic Obama was in office. Now countries are truly scared. And I Love It!!
@kentwalker84 @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 No it's not. We are on a sliding scale. We were heading toward Socialism at an alarming rate. We are now slowly heading toward freedom.
@otto_maddoxx @Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 I'm paying for insurance. I choose to pay. That's how I'm free.
@Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 For everyone. Do you know what freedom is? Do you understand the concept?
@Catheri67491792 @Pajjr2016 You are wrong he is untangling the people from a bloated and over empowered government. You are witnessing the first struggles of freedom.

@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Look. We also have a problem with single mothers. We have a serious problem with the "men" in this country. They roam around making babies.
@Zimmers_0 @theHiRiseLA @LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker We have 50 million people on government assistance. That's still 23 million people. We need to promote self reliance.

@LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker We will never have freedom. Because of the two types of people in the world. The Right wants more freedom and the Left wants more control
@LatinXAmericano @RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker No. That's how it is portrayed, but when the government decides what is good for the people it has become a soft tyranny.

@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Here's the problem with giving the government the power to act on your behalf. Often times they go to far and take away a person's rights.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker He took it to court and won, but that's my point. A year of your life gone, stress multiplied, all because the EPA could act.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker People have a conservation view of the world now. We are in great shape today.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker No. We are not. We're you alive in the 70s? We were destroying it back then. We are living in a saved world.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker That's fine. With zero power to change outcomes.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker The EPA fined a rancher in Wyoming 1000 bucks a day because he made a watering hole for HIS cattle on HIS land.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Yes. Correct. But same organization should not have the power to do anything to a person or business.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Most of the people don't know and have been trained to not give a shit because we have give the government too much decision making ability.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker They advise. Investigation by consumer agency.  Results given to people. The people are the ones with the power, not a government agency.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker I still want EPA. To regulate those things. I just want them toothless. An advisory role only.
@RinehartD @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Notice I didn't get rid of the EPA. Maybe you should get educated.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker The EPA advises a consumer protections arm of the government and the company is investigated. Then the report is given to us. The people.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker That's not the EPA's job.
@rykelz @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Wow. You are really on board with anthropogenic climate change. Sorry, I'm not on board. We have nothing to discuss.

@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Look, I'm not the best advocate for Pro-life. I believe in the death penalty. My view is don't kill the baby, kill the criminal.
@BooBooPenners @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker If you think 401k's are privatized without heavy government regulation I've got a bridge to sell you.
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker I think we are both wrong. They may not be responsible for abortions but tgey are culpable. Project veritas was not fake. It's undercover.
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Then how did project veritas get people on tape at planned parenthood selling fetus parts
@theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Really. Do think trans people are the only ones that would take advantage of the bathroom thing? Fine. Make Male, Female, and unisex.
@BooBooPenners @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker SS should be privatized, same a Medicaid, Government has no business in healthcare except as in oversight.
@BooBooPenners @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Do you know why government cares about marriage? Because of tax and other benefits given to married couples. Government should not care.
@theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Ah, but it does. Don't let the Democrats lie to you. Planned parenthood started abortions in 1970. They have since evolved to refer clients
@theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker I think SS and Medicare and Medicaid are bloated with bureaucracy. They should be privatized with government oversight.
@theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker Look. Maybe 100 years from now we will have coed bathrooms and locker rooms, but today there are too many perverts.
@theHiRiseLA @RealDebbieLynn @CoryBooker There is an obvious Pro-life wing of the party, but the issue is that government subsidizes abortion.
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Democrats want you to use the bathroom of your choice. When a 6'5" hairy dude goes in your locker room at the gym.. that's Democrats
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Republicans want out of your bedroom, Democrats want everything in your bedroom under government control (subsidies)
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Less government also means more personal responsibility. Which means more cost shifted to the individual.
@RealDebbieLynn @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker No. You misunderstand. Republicans don't care what sex you are, or how many times you kill a fetus. Don't make the public pay for it.
@Beowoulf599 @theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Those are all the federal government should be concerned with. It may be more than 8 jobs, but they should be the limit and scope of it.

@theHiRiseLA @CoryBooker Military, infrastructure, police, fire, national parks, limited EPA, limited regulatory agencies for consumer protections, DHS, CIA, FBI.

@SararBer @Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @thehill 2 pesticides may very well be out if control, but the EPA under Obama was very much out of control and was weaponized.
@SararBer @Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @thehill 1 Let me tell you this. You and I don't know enough about this situation, and reading a NYT article isn't any proof.
@nkeenan49 @Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @thehill The Paris climate accord was a ridiculous agreement. Do you even know the financial responsibility on the U.S. for tgat agreement?
@Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @thehill Yes he is fighting for me. He's doing exactly what he said he would do. That's why I voted for him.
@Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @thehill No. He's not. It's a fight with D.C. there are just as many people claiming to be Republicans that need to go.
@SararBer @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill 2 but Trump will slide the scale closer to a free society than we are now. That's all I want.
@SararBer @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill 1 The economy was boosted in the 80s. Regan did not have a majority. I'm not blind to the fact we are a capitalist/socialist country.
@Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @Teamycakes @thehill I voted for a fighter, that's exactly what I got. I love it.
@nkeenan49 @Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @thehill Oh I love his attacks. He's turning the tide. Just sit back and grab a beer. The best is yet to come.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @SararBer @thehill Trump has always had more than $$. He's been an icon for decades. He was in dozens of rap songs when I was growing up and always on tv.
@Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @SararBer @thehill He has nothing any other business person has to do with Russia. Russia collusion is a false story
@Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @SararBer @thehill He hasn't done anything negative to the environment. Name one thing.
@Renji2Resist @nkeenan49 @SararBer @thehill There are no Russian ties. The Democrats have ties to Russia. Obama knew Russia was messing with the elections but didn't say anything.
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill I'll give you a little free knowledge. There are professional investors that always give to the part IN power.
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill LMAO. You're a fine one to talk. George Soros and celebrities fund more Deocrats than a dozen Koch Brother types do for Republicans
@Teamycakes @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill It may be. But so is not allowing people in certain military jobs because they have a shitty credit score, but it happens every day.
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill According to Liberals mandating a $15 minimum wage helps people. Wrong again. It causes reduced hours and promotes thinning out employees
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill Trickle down is a talking point. It's called deregulation and cutting taxes. It puts more money in EVERYONE'S pockets.
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill There's nothing wrong with a wealth gap. There should be a wealth gap. That's what motivates people to do better.
@nkeenan49 @SararBer @Renji2Resist @thehill Nope. You're wrong. Republicans failing to make good on a single promise shows the level of corruption in D.C. (Trump has shown it to us)
@nkeenan49 @Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @thehill It may not be an issue with certain MOS's, but it would wreak havoc in the combat MOS's.
@nkeenan49 @Teamycakes @Renji2Resist @thehill Trump has kept more campaign promises than any President in my lifetime.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Oh well then the facts have it. No real issue. 🤣 I'm not convinced until I see the data, the MOS, and the chapter rate.
@Teamycakes @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill No it's not. The military isn't a game. If you have any mental issues that could take away from combat readiness, you don't get in.
@SararBer @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Don't let those thoughts cloud your judgement. He did not bring in corporate leaders to corrupt. He brought in corporate leaders to win.
@SararBer @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill I don't believe Trump's path is destructive. It's not typical, it's guerrilla tactics, but D.C. requires these alternative techniques.
@Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump He's motivating Sessions to advance a legal agenda. Don't act like the Left cares about Sessions. You are not swaying support for Trump.
@thehill There's nothing to apologize for assholes.
@SararBer @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Nope. You're wrong too. We had a Socialist that put the country down the path of destruction and history will judge him kindly.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Nope. He hasn't alienated anyone. The LGBT community know the truth. You compromise your team if you're not mentally fit. Alaska knows too.
@NarryDr4gon No. It's the Trump supporters that see through the lies, distortion, and misdirection of the Left.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Fake data. You will be disappointed... Again. Lol
@Nvdowahya @nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Nope. Wrong again. I'm sorry you believe a fantasy. Trump will be reelected.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill No. He's not losing support. His base is more emboldened and more motivated than ever.
@nkeenan49 @Renji2Resist @thehill Wrong, sorry. Might as well accept it now. He's the greatest modern President.
@Renji2Resist @thehill You shouldn't believe CNN. Trump has committed no crimes or misdemeanors. Hillary, your candidate, has committed crimes and misdemeanors.
@CChiz5 @kaye_vx Bad question. The climate will always change. We are a planet hurtling through space. Do humans cause the climate to change?
@Renji2Resist @thehill Trump will be a 2 term president. Start crying now. Please get it on video though.

@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No it's in his children's name, and they possess the name Trump.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Because they are perceived "divided loyalties" MOST Trump supporters could care less. 		Put up the wall	Reduce regulations 	Repeal Ocare
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I disagree. His family may benefit. You can't help that. The most you can do is pass legislation on your concerns.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Maybe so, but again he has done everything required legally.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You have that right.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Influence is a debatable perception
@fireheather What about the consequences I never saw come to fruition about all the lawlessness of the Obama administration.
@fireheather I would expect the tax returns in 2019.		He doesn't need to set up a blind trust, but who knows. If it's an issue for 2020.		We are informed
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Not really. His lawyers spent a painful 2 hours briefing the public on all the legal requirements and they went above and beyond.
Absolutely correct https://t.co/Q0uNlbQXf1
@fireheather You absolutely can condemn that. Most of his supporters will allow unethical behavior to achieve their agenda.
I totally agree with this. He is running through the front lines throwing grenades that he hasn't pulled the pin yet. https://t.co/N0X0CpdprO
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And that would be your way. But if Trump knows he's squeaky clean, then he has no obligation to do more than he already has.

@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If you became President in 2020, and happened to be a billionaire that integrated multiple commercial entities. People would condemn you.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just like I will demonize and call in to question everything a Democrat President does, has done, and will do.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It boils down to policy differences. The Left will demonize and call in to question every thing Trump does or has done.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It may to some, but its not illegal. At most unethical.
@randomizerity @fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Not illegal
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS My greatest concern is and has always been Congress. 535 people that often times come in well off and leave multi-millionaires.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I understand your concern. It's not one of mine. Trump is America 1st. He has always been rich. He wouldn't take that risk. In my opinion.
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind "If they are nothing but peaceful" A government official can take pointing and language as a threat. At that point it becomes hostile.
@fireheather @DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I understand the anti-trumpers reaching for anything they can to impeach. I wanted that for Obama. There is no substance to this argument.
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind If they are asked to leave and they don't the arrest is an option. It's a misdemeanor and then the citizen may take legal action.
@RealtorKruse @BraddJaffy I AM SO PROUD HE IS OUR PRESIDENT. I wake up every day and say  "Let's Make America Great Again"
@BraddJaffy It's the rhetoric from the left pushing mentally challenged people to violence. The challenge... How do we eradicate liberalism in society?
@DeborahOchoa07 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He is enforcing the laws that have been ignored 		He should just repeal Obamacare and destroy regulations		Emoluments clause is ridiculous
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind One always has the right to fight an arrest and add to the list of legal precedent. Make it all that more confusing, or maybe, clear it up.
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind This is the best you will get.		https://t.co/YxmaRplfOh		And with that being said you have interpretation.
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind Instead we have decades of legal precedent to file through, and interpretation of "peaceable" through current homeland security law.
@fireheather @Amy_Siskind This is why it's confusing when people are arrested for protesting. Under 1A no law shall stop peaceful protest.

@thehill Stop giving @MarkRuffalo a platform to share his opinion.
@klycward @thehill You're right. It's just a group. They pissed me off when they attached "Veteran Pride and Sacrifice" to it.
@klycward @thehill It's Not! If it was values and behavior would their website's key points. It's political views
@klycward @thehill Veterans groups should be about veterans. Not political viewpoints, not "Big Oil", Not "Climate Change". It's a FAKE GROUP.
@klycward @thehill Fake group because they use veterans to spread dissent
@klycward @thehill We fought, we bled, we died for a free people. To keep our government functioning. In many ways we should always show support.
@klycward @thehill I know that's what you think. Maybe how I'm explaining it, but veterans should support their POTUS regardless of party.
@klycward @thehill They are not about the veterans. They are about producing a narrative.. hence.. fake group.
@klycward @thehill You should change your name to Alice since you dive down the rabbit hole.		Here's my issue. Veterans groups should support POTUS. Period.
@klycward @thehill Not stupid. Agreeing to the message
@klycward @thehill Like they would know
@klycward @thehill Although..500,000 could be the about of active Liberals in the armed forces. Regardless they are using veterans to preach dissent. Not cool!
@klycward @thehill It's very simple. A left wing organization that has figured out how to get their message out to the world on the backs of the veterans.

@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Maybe it's an American culture thing.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill You might want to research that a little more and use population percentage and apply it to the wide range of mass killings.
@Salon Not shocked. Liberalism has consumed higher education, pop culture, and MSM. Most people have Liberal ideals until later in life.
@LouiseMensch @LeslieMarshall Thats not a breaking news story. Democrats have only said impeachment a thousand times. Of course the Judiciary committee is looking into it
Gotcha! That makes it OK! 😂 https://t.co/J2KSKGBVw5
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Lol. True that. Most of the time, but those violent crimes are shared across the races.
@Levendaki @LadyBleach @Amplify246 Good discussion. Goodnight. Peace, Love, and Respect.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill C'mon. You're smarter than this tweet.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Ummm. Have you been watching the news. As soon as a bunch of white people start yelling "Allahu Akbar" and blowing people up. I'll agree.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill The KKK is not supported by Trump though. Just because bigoted idiots support a cause doesn't make the cause a bad one.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill Guys treat you like you allow them to treat you. If they treat you like a piece of meat. Put them in their place. Women have more power.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Lol... ok so is this one Trump or R Kelly?
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill Because the Alt-Right is a minuscule part of Trump supporters
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill I have no hard feelings toward Muslims, unless they are for Sharia law and don't speak out when they know something is being planned.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill I think misogyny is an over used and often untrue politically motivated attack word. The only antisemitism is from Muslim teaching and KKK.
@Levendaki @Amplify246 @thehill And 2A.. LOL
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Who cares. If he gets a tax break because he gives money, the needy still get help
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill Who's alt-right? I just lean right. My views are all over the map.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill I don't care about his personal motivations. He's accomplishing everything he said he would. I will vote for him again.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Wow.... you are so fixated with race. You might want to seek counseling
@Levendaki @Amplify246 @thehill Couldn't help it. The response was warranted
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill You're really reaching now.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill Actually there is a healthy amount of narcissism in patriotism
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @thehill Nobody is perfect, but he's trying to do the right thing.
@LadyBleach @Levendaki @thehill We are fighting ISIS. Do you want to win or not?
@Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @thehill The You have nothing to worry about. Just sit back and let him take the next 8 years like I did with Obama. Hoarding ammo and learning MMA.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill I'm confused... are we talking about Trump or Muhammad Ali
@Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @thehill Go back and read my tweet. Sexual Predator Enabler. She viciously went after Bill Clinton's victims
@Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @thehill Do you really think he will jail journalists? As much as I would like to see a few of them fired... 1A
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill No. We eagerly voted for a populist and a patriot. Not an old white woman that wants to ruin the USA.
@Levendaki @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @thehill But you would have been okay with a serial liar, a sexual predator enabler? You can choose to focus on what is reported. Free country.
@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill We absolutely need to advocate that we are a free people, and instill a desire to achieve greater freedom.
@Levendaki @Amplify246 @thehill Was responding to a racist accusing Trump supporters of fearing Black POTUS
@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill Exactly my point. I want more freedom, not less. We need to be removing the hold the government has, not creating more like Obama was doing.
@Levendaki @thehill Not meant as a tutorial. Just don't understand why when Trump does something that has been done before.... the country goes apeshit.
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill Get off the race already. It has to do with Government smothering the American people
@Amplify246 @Levendaki @thehill Has nothing to do with black. I hate Socialism. I want all Americans to have freedom instead.
@Levendaki @thehill Gifting TC/SCI/SAP to countries not necessarily classified as allies has been done before. It's sometimes a necessary and strategic move.
@Levendaki @thehill You mean... there a very patriotic right leaning base that saved the country in the nick of time by electing Trump. You are welcome.

@pauligirll I sense a lot of worst case scenario with you. I understand your fear.
@pauligirll Why do you want Government to do this? When I was a kid. There was a half a dozen  places to get free contraception and I was not covered.
@pauligirll Let me ask you this. If government stops supplying contraception do you think there will just be babies everywhere?
@pauligirll I don't think so
@pauligirll Christians in my view aren't pushing their agenda as much as they're trying protect their religious liberty.
@pauligirll As far as minorities being singled out... Not sure. We have many programs in place that places minorities first in line.
@pauligirll I'm not exactly sure the overreach you are referring to,  but deregulation helps all Americans.
@pauligirll In my view... start dismantling government intervention and many social issues go away.
@pauligirll Gay marriage? Why did we let government dictate marriage to begin with? Because of over regulated taxation.
@pauligirll Many social issues in my view are partisan because too many people want the government to fix it. Obesity? Regulate soda size.
@pauligirll Well we have differing views because I think we look at issues in different ways. I'm driving now, be happy to respond later
@pauligirll The Right wants Federal protections for everyone, until it potentially violates another protection. And there lies the rub.
@pauligirll Then to your point we should reduce the Federal Government to military and government oversight of state and commercial programs.
RT @JusticeWillett: Adoption = a sacred gift that enriches everyone.		I've received abundant blessings in life.		Being adopted was the 1st.…

@seanhannity He did. But let him pay with ratings, not with bans or threats to his advertisers. I agree with you Sean.
@pauligirll I may disagree with most things Liberals and some Conservatives say, but despite all the "ism's" I'm accused of, I want people to prosper.
@lockedmith @IndivisibleTeam @LeslieMarshall With single payer ( what you really want) we will all be living in our cars. AGAIN... We cannot cover a country with health insurance!
@pauligirll I think anyone who voted for or supported Obamacare should retake math. It's impossible to ensure a country using health insurance.
@pauligirll I'm glad you're not dead. Although, this current trend to want single payer... more people needing major surgery may not like the answer.
@pauligirll I don't like the bill. I think it needs to be thrown out
@SashaFierce60 @Mikel_Jollett And I appreciate you too. Lol mostly objective 😉
@SashaFierce60 @Mikel_Jollett Very true. Much more, and follow-up.
@pauligirll Are you sure? Where's your proof? Trust me. Nothing I would like better than a true Red State, Blue State experiment.
@IndivisibleTeam @LeslieMarshall Liberals want health insurance that covers pre-existing cond, but when insurance companies drop out taxpayers pay for healthcare instead.
@pauligirll Lol. I hope you're right!
@CynthiaFallon3 Wait. If you don't support Trump and you think Hillary is a good person. You sir, are no Republican.
@CynthiaFallon3 @cardsmizzou @chelseahandler Here's a fact. He's our President. We have Gorsuch, and we will probably get a bump in GDP and tax reform... if Repubs like you support it.
@CynthiaFallon3 @cardsmizzou @chelseahandler Do you think Trump is getting fair treatment of the press?
@CynthiaFallon3 @cardsmizzou @chelseahandler Well, glad to hear that.
@SashaFierce60 @Mikel_Jollett No President will fix the problem until they understand how the violence spreads. Here's the right question. Why to kids join gangs?
@SashaFierce60 @Mikel_Jollett I haven't forgotten. In my opinion Obama had the ability to do so much more to impact the violence. Stumping on gun control didn't help.

@Kringer1 @puppymnkey For decades the media has leaned left, CNN came out of the closet and it became cool to lean left.
@Kringer1 @puppymnkey Well I've been stewing for 7 years, I gave Obama some benefit of the doubt. Trump is carrying out everything he said.
@Kringer1 @puppymnkey People watch the news thinking they are watching fair view points. I know. I thought CNN was was reporting accurately.
@Kringer1 @puppymnkey The matter is. Obama fundamentally skewed Americans view of immigration. To the detriment of the country.
@Kringer1 @puppymnkey You might know this, maybe you don't. CNN, NBC, MSNBC, CBS, PBS, AP, WALL STREET JOURNAL, and many others are Liberal.
@Kringer1 @puppymnkey oh really? The fact that you said that proves you haven't heard the complaints of border guards.

@BlowhardMcGee Everyone has a past. I understand his past. I'm looking to his future.
@RichTPar You are correct. Barrack Obama created Trump.
@BlowhardMcGee I think Trump takes the people more seriously than the politicians that have made a life in the beltway.
@BlowhardMcGee @puppymnkey I suppose it will.
@RichTPar I realize it's hard to imagine a billionaire funding leftist activities, but the Wall Street Journal wrote an article exposing it.
@BlowhardMcGee I don't take Trump literally. I take him seriously. Wish you well too.
@BlowhardMcGee @puppymnkey It's time to get real. If you had the opportunity and it was legal to make 500 million, would you?

@joss Thank you for showing the world your mental illness. You are a hack.
@EWDolan I was visibly enraged too. What's the big deal?
@PamelaMonke1 It's obvious you can't face reality without getting upset, and I'm getting bored, have a nice day. I hope you can wake up soon
@PamelaMonke1 These were in the mainstream. CNN, MSNBC, NBS, CBS. You know, the left leaning organizations
@PamelaMonke1 I used the government healcare while in the Army. Not a great system. It's not patient centered care. It's regulation centered
@PamelaMonke1 It was in the mainstream media. Don't you watch the news?
@PamelaMonke1 Don't use the government healthcare, I choose to use public sector healthcare because the government run care is poor and slow
@PamelaMonke1 IRS, BENGHAZI, ACA, STIMULUS, FAST AND FURIOUS, HOLDER IN CONTEMPT, NSA, JOURNALIST SPYING, PIGFORD, BERGDAHL, IRAN DEAL
@PamelaMonke1 There won't be a wall across the whole border. There are natural barriers, double fencing, other barriers that would be fine
@PamelaMonke1 He used IRS to target conservatives.  Really it's impressive all the things he got away with. He lied straight faced often
@PamelaMonke1 Obama's 8 years was scandal after scandal
@PamelaMonke1 Government only has one real job. Oversight
@PamelaMonke1 um, respectfully, you're wrong. Medical insurance is more cost effective with less restrictive regs, competition, state lines
@PamelaMonke1 only the father speaks English so he was allowed to translate the voter form
@PamelaMonke1 All you needed was a drivers license with your current address
@PamelaMonke1 We all voted at the school in our neighborhood. There were literally 15 people there and there were 2 booths
I agree with all these points. https://t.co/2w9ovyfNVX
@PamelaMonke1 except for oversight and to protect against unfair practices
@PamelaMonke1 I will not allow that. We need less government restrictions and regulation. Government should not be in healthcare...
@PamelaMonke1 Everything Obama's agenda did was to increase government regulation and place force against Americans, for the good of others
@PamelaMonke1 I respect other people's opinions, but if they harm our economy, increase debt, increase taxes, stifle growth, I will disagree
@PamelaMonke1 Voter ID should be issued by the DMV free of charge with proof of citizenship.
@PamelaMonke1 I voted Trump, I want a wall, that doesn't mean I want good people deported. I do want voter ID - it should be free to acquire
@PamelaMonke1 @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary I'm talking to you with respect. Using words like "troll" is very disrespectful.
@PamelaMonke1 @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary I talk to them. A few of them work as milkers at a dairy here. There are many illegals here.
@puppymnkey @mrRef63 @SFL4Hillary @owillis Again. Your opinion. He is well spoken and holds conservative values.
@PamelaMonke1 Exactly. MOST of the people that are called misogynistic, are not at all. MOST men love and respect women. That's a fact.
It's official. People have made up definitions for words. Anyone who calls a man a misogynist doesn't know what the word means.
@mrRef63 @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis You would like to think so. Nope.  LTC West, would have made an awesome President. Oh..he's black
@PamelaMonke1 @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary if your claim is that only 8 illegals voted.. that means they only counted my neighbors.
@PamelaMonke1 @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary Wrong. There are 9 adults living next door. Nice people. I person is here legally. They all voted.
@MarkKowalsky Stop allowing yourself to be manipulated by the press. You are smarter than that
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis I'm sure he was fined. That speaks to the over regulation.
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis You are not looking at the bigger picture. NAFTA is being renegotiated. Corp. Tax rates down
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis I used to live in Colorado. Your laws caused a few companies to flee. Marijuana brought 122M
@secret08 @the_other_kimk @co_rapunzel4 @lossolidos I agree. The 60 million that didn't vote for Trump.
@PamelaMonke1 @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary I know there were a certain number of illegal voters. My neighbors voted. 1 out of 8 are legal.
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis He pulled out of TPP because it's not an asset for the American Worker
@secret08 You can call anyone you want stupid. It's your right. Plus.. you have been a slave to the world around you
@ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis That story was a slanted fabrication. There are media biases that manipulate the truth
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis Trump will do well for America. You don't need to be on board to reap the benefits
@puppymnkey @ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @owillis This is what you have to understand. Trump has done well for himself and his family.
@puppymnkey @CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary I don't know that for sure. You don't know that for sure. You have a passionate view. I despised Obama
@McBee53 @SFL4Hillary Trump is Legitimate. Because I and millions across the country voted for him. Not because of Russia. He was the best
@SFL4Hillary It's too bad you can't read your statement from a position of reason. It makes me sad for you. Shall we pray?
@ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis Wow. You really just regurgitate CNN talking points, don't you. Not true.
@woodjl68 @SFL4Hillary Trump is Legitimate
@CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis He didn't pull us out of anything. LIE! Better study the facts. Not lies the media reports.
@CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey I'm giving Trump a chance. I don't burn people at the stake (like apparently you do) without a record.
@ernestine_12 @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis Obama was not decent. He played you like a fiddle.
@SFL4Hillary keep spreading the lies. It only increases doubt to your legitimacy
@CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis Post all the lies about Trump you want. You have no leg to stand on. I have 8 yrs of proof.
@CDWGallison @SFL4Hillary @puppymnkey @owillis Oh I know Obama is smart. He pulled the wool over millions. While increasing the debt 10T!
@SFL4Hillary No. That's how you see Obama. Not how we did. He was an American apologetic, socialist ideologic, manipulator, and liar.

@eptronic @Salon Yes. Biggest news story. No. It would happen the way I claim. History is your best source for future outcomes.
@nicksevens You are #blocked troll.
@eptronic @Salon come now.. let's be honest. If they were white??? Headlines would be plastered on every news source. RACISM IN AMERICA
@nicksevens @Salon You must enjoy degradation. Oh wait. You're a Liberal. My bad. I always forget these things.
@Salon That's because if you can't see the lack of outrage over the racist torture. We all know what would take place if races were reversed
@nicksevens @Salon Wow. How did you handle that. I bet you showered for days.
@nicksevens @Salon Yep. That basically sums up his presidency. Good try though.
