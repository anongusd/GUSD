A.8. System-involved girls are resilient, creative, capable, industrious, and worthy of second chances, especially when they were not given the best starts to begin with. Everyone can finish strong! #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/t44RJb7c2f
A.7. Like @nokidsinprison, we imagine a justice system that is restorative, strengths-based, and community-based, so the least restrictive environment and the most supports are preferred to help system-involved children reach their full potential. #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/O0f2WdR00q
A.6. DC needs to focus on ensuring that the basic needs of its children, including Black girls, are met (i.e., safe home, food, transportation and resources) and that schools and communities are safe and supportive so that Black girls can thrive. #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/346EeHH4ed
A.5. Children don’t come in pieces. DC systems can be more responsive to the needs of girls by working collaboratively across systems to meet the holistic needs of girls by focusing on prevention and positive youth development. #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/3C6yozeeUc
A.4. Girls in the justice system need appropriate services to meet their physical, mental, emotional, social, and educational needs. Gender-responsive &amp; trauma-informed approaches are critical for the holistic well-being of girls. #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/fdWw6KbEv6
A.3. In DC, like the US, voices of justice-involved Black girls need to be heard &amp; shared. They are disproportionately put in the justice system. Groups like @YWCAUSA &amp; others underscore the role of racism and the urgency of eliminating it #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/oTLogm53ks
A.2. One of the myths is that justice-involved girls are dangerous, but the majority of girls are arrested for non-violent related offenses. Incarceration and punitive approaches are not the answer. Intervention and community-based services are. #BeyondtheWalls #DCGirlsinJJ https://t.co/DQiVnCjdOJ
