How can Congress buy time to eliminate #climatechange as new technologies are developed? Invest in natural gas infrastructure, energy efficiency, and renewables, and existing nuclear facilities.
Pro: broad bipartisan support for boosting energy security + economic competitiveness. Con: No shared vision on whether &amp; how to address climate change. Congress must bridge this gap to ensure effective energy innovation policy.
#DirectAirCapture and storage can open new windows for American manufacturing, technology, and markets while protecting the environment by meeting global emission targets. Here’s why it’s key to bridging critical policy goals in Congress: https://t.co/AikiDyrGGs
There are 5 clear pathways to reconcile economic + ecological imperatives of #climatechange:  	1.) Advanced energy storage 	2.) Advanced nuclear power 	3.) Carbon capture storage/utilization 	4.) Carbon transportation fuels 	5.) Direct air capture technology
.@JasonGrumet: The U.S. needs a #GreenTrueDeal anchored in innovation + designed to cushion the economic impacts in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
The U.S. trails 12 other nations in the amount of energy R&amp;D investments relative to GDP. To compete in the global marketplace, Congress MUST increase federal R&amp;D investment and provide incentives to encourage private resource commitments.
Innovation is the core of America’s economic strength: 50% of U.S. annual GDP growth is linked to innovation increases. How can Congress continue this trend? 1.) Public and private collaboration 2.) Increased federal R&amp;D investment

FDR was the first president to use the phrase #StateoftheUnion – before he took office, presidents referred to it as the “Annual Message.”
Once the debt limit is reinstated, the consequences are far-reaching. #Bipartisan fiscal reform is possible, but leaders must make the move to take shutdowns and debt showdowns off the table. @ShaiAkabas  https://t.co/NsaRbOyxcJ
What’s one thing that likely WON’T be mentioned in the #SOTU? The importance of internal congressional reform. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress provides a unique opportunity for Congress to come together &amp; it should remain high on its priority list this year.

1.) The appointment of members who are committed to putting reforms over politics; 2.) Reported recommendations are acted upon expeditiously by committees of jurisdiction; and 3.) Leadership commits to moving those reforms on the floor.
However, we're disappointed that it will not be able to advance legislation on its own &amp; have a guaranteed floor vote on its recommendations. That’s why we urge members to not only support the committee’s creation but also demand it have the following key elements:
BPC Action has long called for and applauds the creation of a committee to identify and recommend thoughtful bipartisan reforms which are key to a revitalized Congress. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is an essential starting point.
On the first day of the #116thCongress, BPC Action welcomes new and returning members. We look forward to working with you to forge actionable bipartisan solutions to our nation's toughest challenges!

It’s time for Congress to end the political blame game and come together to tackle the nation’s crippling federal deficits, which will soon exceed $1 trillion.
As the U.S. deficits continue to rise, Congress is caught up in political battles to continue funding the government. It must end this trend in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/sdh3ogJULc

This hearing comes at a critical time with just over two months until the debt limit—which BPC estimates to be at a record high of ~$22 trillion—is reinstated.
As the federal deficit balloons, Congress’s focus must shift from playing the political blame game to finding a solution. BPC Action is encouraged to see @FinancialCmte shine a spotlight on the nation's fiscal challenges at tomorrow’s debt hearing. https://t.co/R9cqni44d0
