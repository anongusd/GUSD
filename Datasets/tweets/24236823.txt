Jeff Bezos is worth $141 BILLION dollars.		He could personally give each of Amazon’s 566,000 employees a bonus worth $200,000 and still he would be worth $37 BILLION dollars. 		He would still be one of the 30 richest people in the world. 		Just saying...
@charliekirk11 Holy fuck. This shit got loud when it happened. But nice try.
@JxhnBinder @AnnCoulter Separating children from their parents ≠ an article talking about detained unaccompanied minors. But cool spin.
@benshapiro Ah yes, the best father's are the ones that mock people different from them.
@ErikFallsDown They also used the Bible to justify slavery. So I think it’s going well.

RT @reynoldsgareth: Trump should replace Flynn with General Consensus.
RT @chrislhayes: For sheer narrative absurdity, Flynn's replacement's gotta be Petraeus.
RT @ForecasterEnten: So much winning.
RT @TVietor08: Sort of uncanny how often CNN's #fakenews is accurate
@daveanthony how is this fucking real life?!
@SpeakerRyan you misspelt your hashtags. #emolumentsclause #basiccivicslessonsforthePresident

@JoshMalina @HrishiHirway It's great! I sub in the pit for the Bway prod.The kids are incredible musicians! Worth it just to see them shred.
@ChrisChristie What was that you were saying about POTUS acting like a petulant child? Or was that someone else you were referring too?
RT @AGOWA: DENIED.  UNANIMOUS.  PER CURIUM.
@jaketapper shot J.R. and tried to pin it on @Linda_Gray #TapperDirtFile
@realDonaldTrump 101% response? Those results seem questionable...
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorSessions This is pretty cut and dry. No, no he does not.
@jaketapper is a national damn treasure.
RT @TheTweetOfGod: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…
I'm pretty sure "1 in, 2 out" was something Trump did in Russia.
How has it only been just over a week?!
@jonfavs @danpfeiffer @TVietor08 @jonlovett @crookedmedia Wife and I set up our monthly donations. Long time listeners. Keep it up! https://t.co/xtE5E3cflZ
@AltNatParkSer Keep up the fight!!! Can't wait until we can get back to the Grand Canyon! https://t.co/X4nffU6TTV
@jodyavirgan @FiveThirtyEight How do I as an east coast elite help out? NYC is already blue. How do I help turn the red to blue elsewhere?
Trump was right.		He did get the biggest crowd. Everyone just showed up a day late.
Who knew ethics could be so much damn fun!  @NormEisen is quickly becoming my favorite person. Don't let up!
Finally followed @daveanthony and @reynoldsgareth from @thedollop. Still looking for Gary's handle. Seriously, best Pod available.
Wedding time! https://t.co/iPBAMF3ifd
@jodyavirgan But if this is the new definition of "Biggest" now... I have some great news for my penis. Why is this real life!!!!?
Does anyone know what happened to @GovChristie? Where'd that little guy bugger off to?
Has anyone asked @realDonaldTrump what made America ('Murcia*) great in the first place?  *for the under-educated
@realDonaldTrump You are the president-elect. Act like it.
@realDonaldTrump Are you still mad that Paris is Out! was one of the first in a long line of failures for you?
@jonlovett @jonfavs @danpfeiffer Guess you need to #draintheswamp to get the shit from the bottom.
@jonfavs @danpfeiffer Can you guys do a special podcast on the Tweet storm we're gonna get Nov 9th when they give Trump his phone back?
@realDonaldTrump It's sad that a 70 year old man is given the same punishment I give to my not even 2 year old. #nophoneforyou
@MTA How is it possible that you still haven't completed the staircase at the Broadway stop?
It hurts my soul to see @mike_pence try to spin around talking about ANYTHING his running mate has said. Impossible to spin. But fair shot.
"The polls are showing us in a dead heat..." "The highly respected  Rasmussen poll..." I'm sure @ForecasterEnten has some thoughts on that.
@andersoncooper is destroying @KellyannePolls right now and it's just amazing.
@RepTrentFranks You are an idiot. But good try.
#1600live Is it telling that Trump went straight to his family while Hillary went to talk to the people on stage post-debate?
@jonfavs @jonlovett @danpfeiffer Time to rewatch FAIL SAFE. Just to get prepared for life in a Trump Presidency.
@danpfeiffer at least someone has nailed his feet to the floor
@realDonaldTrump you are being awfully quiet...
@jonlovett @jonfavs Has anyone asked Trump to produce any notification of his audits he received from the IRS? Surely he can release those.
@jonlovett @danpfeiffer @realDonaldTrump seems thirstier than Marco Rubio this debate.
@realDonaldTrump Looking good. And that’s the best of the 3 forecasts. https://t.co/CkI1GjobgV
Watching @MikePenceVP speak is a live stream of someone knowing their soul is slowly dying inside of them... #poorcareerchoices #trumpbooboo

Excellent to see @CNN finally giving @BernieSanders some air time. Just needed a solid negative story to do it. Well done.
