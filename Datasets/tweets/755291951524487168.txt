@KHollowayWSB @wsbtv When a person is threatened, life or protection of others, our first &amp; most primal response, is anger which triggers Fight, Flight or Freeze.

@pray2pesci I'm down w/ removing the stigma, being responsible to use the contraceptive is the part that needs the most attention, where I live &amp; a lot of places in the US condoms are free at social service health clinics, also foam, female condom, pill, IUD, day after pill w/nurse visit
@pray2pesci The new bill in NY and the one they tried to pass in Virginia, just got me going I guess. I will admit coming down on the women who choose this is not a compassionate or empathetic if I'm hoping they will make a different choice because I've seen the pain it causes them later.
@pray2pesci I never said it should be illegal, only that I don't want my tax dollars paying for it if it is not a necessary medical procedure. I have had several friends who have had abortions, later in life they were heartbroken when they realized it was a life that they would never know.
@JedIAm4 Oh and if by R's you mean Republican, I am neither an R or a D, I evaluate each position and each person for that position as individuals those I feel best represent my views get my vote. I think healthy is somewhere in the middle of the two. I support issues on both sides.
@JedIAm4 Why do people always miss the point I didn't say they can't have one I said I don't consent to paying for it. In most cases it is an elective procedure fat people can't get liposuction with govt funds, itty bitty titty ppl can't get an augmentation so why abortions.
@IndKingCountyWA Why does it have to be one or the other, why would you attribute such a haneous position to me, I never said such a thing. You are not kind as your profile indicates. Check your heart it think it lacks a beat.
@AlisonLew Just because I voiced that I do not consent, doesn't mean I will get my way, now does it? So sure share your list I am sure there are places we actually agree we don't want out money spent. But there are also places we can just agree to disagree. This may be one of them.
@pray2pesci I'm good with sex. Love it actually, get plenty of it, I just believe both people involved should be consenting and responsible is that so difficult these days, to be responsible for your actions and not demand that others pay for your irresponsibility.
B4 u jump my shi* I am allowed in a free society 2 not consent 2 things I disagree with. U are welcome 2 add your comment but no need to be an as*hole, we can just agree 2 disagree on the matter. U can donate ur $ where u want &amp; I can voice my not consenting 2 pp getting mine.
@MSScienceWizard @johnnymac2220 Please tell me how people on govt. Medical can get an abortion without using my tax dollars to cover their govt paid medical, I know they are not supposed to be able to but I have brought a friend for an abortion 2 times with govt funded medical and they paid 4 it both times.
@johnnymac2220 Apparently you didn't understand the term extenuating circumstances, there is only so much that can go in a tweet but rape, incest, medical emergency, fetal death, mother's life/health is at risk, these are a majority of extenuating circumstances. Rape is always an exception.
@LaurieEdgar1 @JedIAm4 @DetroitLove88 Actually I have escorted a few friends who have used their services, when they needed pregnancy prevention products they got them free from dshs(social service office) cancer screens &amp; breast exams at their regular Dr. Office, so the only reason they needed Pp was abortion.
@Honey74707549 True however I don't see abortions as being a necessary medical treatment except in extenuating circumstances, most times it is elective and last time I checked, elective medical treatment wasn't covered by the govt.
@NoSacredCow60 Neither do I actually. I think people should be responsible and not get pregnant/get someone pregnant if they cannot afford to take care of their children. That being said, I do not support universal healthcare, welfare and the like, I support strong morals and hard work.
@Dolloutfitters Because the men don't decide if the woman is willing, if that were the case I cite extenuating circumstances. I agree both people need to be responsible, however it is also not up to the man involved when the decision to abort is on the table.
As a tax paying citizen, I do not consent to my tax dollars supporting an organization that murders unborn babies. If women Don't want a baby they can keep their damn legs closed! Baring extenuating circumstances, if you can't be responsible about sex, refrain from having it. https://t.co/xNQEXpoHB3

@AOC just in case you missed this post, it is spot on.

@bronze_nate @James_rwnat @realitycalls8 I feel that the opioid crisis is only a symptom of a bigger problem. Increased immigration lead to flooded employee market lead to reduced need for employer incentives and reduced pay lead to a deteriorating hope for American dream. Hopelessness is pain, drugs are pain relievers
@BornEmpirical @James_rwnat @realitycalls8 The reason our birth rates are so low is mass illegal immigration=mass employee supply=reduced need for companies to give incentives and reduced wages=both parents need to work=good ppl realize they can only afford 1 or 2 kids, takers who lack discipline have multiple on welfare.

@kenstrid @RealJamesWoods I'm not so sure you can teach your kids to fight back against an entire gang 8+ without later having to take a drive down to the corners office to identify the body of your child who was beaten unrecognizable by a gang of thugs filled with hate. No 1 on 1 stand your ground.
@quagmyrehk @RealJamesWoods The kid who was attacked was being provoked by the other so he would react and give the attacker a reason, had he reacted and the attacker end up on the floor, the rest of the gang feels justified to beat this boy to death. The boy was rather in a bathroom, surrounded by thugs.
@Wgoffballs @Harveyhagar @RealJamesWoods Against a mob in the bathroom? Sounds dangerous, looked dangerous. I told kids defend others who are being mistreated unfairly, but do it loud so you draw the attention of other hopefully like minded.

@DedreFox What do we do w/ the violent Am. citiz. criminals? Prosecute them according to their crime, those w/ a life or longer sentence should b given an alt. option 2 take an execution pill or work some kind of society supporting job 4 their entire sentence like agriculture. Supervised

@DedreFox No I didn't address the names because the situation is with regard to illegals. 	If they were not here illegally, committing a crime, the crime statistics would decrease accordingly. Approximately 1000 violent crimes a yr are by illegals when 1 is to many 1000 is unacceptable.
@DedreFox R U saying because there are fewer illegals than citizens their % in prison will be higher? Anyhow I can see where we begin to disagree, U say illegals do not commit a lot of violent crime, correct? I feel those who are here illegally should be committing 0 violent crime.
@AOC A fool is only made known when they open their mouth and speak. You are a young, pretty new face in politics, but when you speak, those who actually listen can clearly see that is all you are. When you accuse others of lies, be sure your own mistruths cannot be made public.

@DedreFox Our prisons should house american criminal idiots and not those who are here illegally. Based on real crimes not illegal status 20% being illegal when they are 3.3% of the population in america is disproportionately high. Illegals who commit crime should be deported, many are.
@DedreFox What is your particular source so we can both agree it is a reliable source of info. then discuss the data. Pew research, DOJ, DHS, Bureau of Prisons &amp; US census have the #'s at 20-30% illigals in fed prison when they are 3.3% of us pop. the other 70-80% US born &amp; legal alien.

@CNNOpinion Eric Liu, you wrote an opinion piece on Why are hispanics identifying as White? I have a  few questions,  What is white as in whiteness and what does it mean to "become white" as you term it? Wouldn't it be nice if race wasn't on the census but language were instead.
@CNNOpinion @DriverWrites The very first line of this article is an opinion. You list the weakest of the population as the majority of people in this caravan and they aren't capable of walking 100's of miles yet these people already have?? Not buying it. Grandma didn't plow thru the Mexican border gates.

@culturalfugue @kcampbell4019 @FrostyMcCool @charliekirk11 It is not that I don't want them here, I would love to see a sponsor a family program set up, but I'm not the one.

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly As it was explained to me, that is how it worked but I am learning new stuff everyday and I am certainly open to hearing the truth if I am misinformed.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly As indicated, I spend about what is billed so the only reason to pay for ins is in case of er ie hospitalization. I have had sx and been hositalized a few times and it always came with a multi k out of pocket deductible left over after ins picked up their 80% so I do see the cost
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Honestly I do strive to make others laugh/smile, but that was a realistic assessment of cost and paid medical. So since I am missing something, please enlighten me with the truth as I do realize I am not all knowing about all things, there is always room to learn more
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Again I apologize for the tone of my initial comments. I thought I was awake and was trying to wake others only 2 find that I was still in a dream. I have had a new experience, in the blink of an eye. I sense hostility, impatience, intolerance in your replies. can we start over?
@pacelattin @RaymondKooyenga @charliekirk11 @kanyewest @RealCandaceO Wooa no need to put that negativity out there, educate before you hate.

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ins co is making $$ or they wouldn't be in the ins business. Medicare sets the cost of medications, govt regulates ins co to blanket the cost if meds and regulates what ins co can charge for premium ins co contracts w/med facility to agreed billing amounts. 1 owns 2 &amp; 3. 1makes$
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly My costs are offset by my husbands. Insurance co. collects from those who see doc reg and those who don't the cost are the same but one offsets the other. premiums are invested ins co makes $ on what is not being spent at the time, also ins co/pharma/med facilities all 1 entity
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly My husband costs are the same but never needs to see doc so insurance is for emergency/unexpected illness. Together we spend 18% of our  yearly income on medical, most of which is billed under me as I have the major illness and see doc regularly.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly I'm not sure what you pay for insurance, I pay 6K in premiums+a 7k out of pocket deductible before insurance put in a dime employer pays additional 6K thats 19K a year for me alone. I have Asthma, insurance is for emergency mostly, cost is close to billed each year.
I do not give my consent. I am awake, though groggy, need more "coffee" and "Crumbs" I'm here to do my part, been doing all along was just unaware of how important it was. I guess i was on the scenic route, so happy to know the plan is coming together. WWG1WGA
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ok, so what exactly am I missing? I don't need a bridge I don't live in Brooklyn.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Oh honey, I pay for my own insurance, out of my own income, through my own job where the government taxes my personal income then uses those tax dollars to help pay4 medical insurance utilized by those who receive medical assistance thru the govt. at little or no cost. I get it.
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 Agreed, I don't advocate 4 it 2 be outlawed, I do feel that outside extenuating circumstances it should be a last resort. I personally believe that the ability to create &amp; grow inside your body, another life, is a gift given to Women not to b taken lightly.
@RepHankJohnson, Hello, I am checking with you before I decide if this is "FakeNews" as not only do I not want to succumb to being lead to believe this is true if in fact it is is not. Please confirm or deny https://t.co/wv4i1WFxA9 thank you. Sincerely

@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 You misunderstand, I don't want to pay for any medical procedures,dr visits, medications, treatments for you or anyone else besides family in need. Fortunately u r Irish I am American, so I don't. I actually apologize for putting in my 2cents since I am not Irish in it irrevelent
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 Never said I even cared about who or how many peeps you desire to engage in sexual relations with, I said show restraint if you cannot be responsible. Legal abortions are "safer" but to call them safe, is a flat out lie. I  can say as I please, you can choose not to listen.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Correct again, it is not my job to tell others, abstain if they lack judgment regarding the consequences of unprotected sex &amp; are incapable of using conception control properly, just the same as it not my job/responsibility to pay for the consequences of  their actions. Agree?
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 I also apologize to those of you that I offended with my views. That is  not who I want to be. A closed mind always opens the door to anger then to hate. I don't hate women who have abortions nor do I want to punish them. I feel the procedure itself is punishment enough.
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 I concede,it is not my business what a woman or a man chooses do with their body so long as they are not using my $ to do it. As for welfare benefits of any kind, I feel should be on the community &amp; family to assist those in need. Criminals forfeit their rights.

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ok we can set aside the moral argument of abortion if it helps those who choose that route this still leaves the issue of everyone's tax $used to pay for the irresponsible act of an unwanted pregnancy.

@marie_skou @CharlesMonsen1 Will you humor me this, If left to develop undisturbed, will the fetus become an infant? A human being?
@marie_skou @CharlesMonsen1 I think it might be better stated as "I find it immoral to give birth to an unwanted child" but the mother can always give the child to a loving family. No abortions that are strictly done due to inconvenience, are immoral, selfish, lazy. "responsibility 4 your actions"
@marie_skou Please do not pull the Contraceptive failed line as in testing it nearly never does, in practice it only fails when one is irresponsible and forgets, or uses improperly.
@marie_skou Regulated better, perhaps. Abortion for those old enough to understand how procreation works yet to irresponsible to prevent it and find it inconvenient to carry is just unacceptable. Rape, incest, eminently detrimental to mother's life, fine, but inconvenient, no.
@Michelle1Kelly Perhaps if women,who end up with an unwanted pregnancy, were a more careful with what they choose to put into their bodies or under what conditions the risk of pregnancy are acceptable, they wouldn't have to kill a living being and justify murder by choice.
@becksk Not sure where you live but most places will save the mother over the fetus if her life is is danger.
@JillHealy_ What about all the choices that lead up to conception? Are they not her choice, who she has sex with, what conceptive to use, who is paying for the contraceptive or the choice to abstain on the off chance you will get pregnant? Accountability for your actions. I'm pro-choice too

@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice As for his well being, if he is brain dead he has no awareness of well being nor does he have an awareness of what dignity is. Dignity would be to allow the parents to seek care wherever they choose at their expense no seek court decision to restrict parental rights.
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice So you think the child is terminal, is brain dead as they claim for reasoning to end his life? if yes, you must concede that, he no longer feels pain as people without brain function cannot process pain, so how does taking him elsewhere to die deny hi,m comfort?
@CraigAmbrose1 @tomaszs2 @MerseyPolice So if he is terminal, why can't the parents take him home to pass, or to another facility? Why were the parents not allowed to remove him the moment the hospital stopped providing life sustaining support? This is just wrong, they should be allowed to seek a miracle anywhere.
@simonhall1974 @DatOtherMichael @MerseyPolice At whose request did the courts intervene? Who got the courts involved and who prevented the parents from removing the child prior to the court order?
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice The parents have the right to seek 2nd, 3rd opinion, or religious miracle, or to take their "dying" son home to pass on his own in his own environment. Why would any hospital refuse to allow them to seek care elsewhere if they have already condemned him to death, unless foul play

Not sure exactly what you are saying with regard to "voting on the honor system". I always have paid for my conception control, never had a pregnancy I wasn't willing to be responsible to take care of, or one that was too inconvenient. Abstinence was what I could afford.

@DedreFox I have been called all sorts of things, many that are untrue, some that are, if i live in such a way as to draw the title Whore, then I can't really complain about being called one. Whore is a person who sells sex for money, so if the title fits, then so be.

@FitnessScott @StormyDaniels If she signed a NDA then she is most definitely not doing the right thing. She signed in agreement not to talk, she took the money then she talked, that is a person who cannot keep their word, why believe anything that came from her mouth.
The fact that she knowingly signed a NDA.(legal or not, she signed and took the money) then didn't keep her word, tells you all you need to know of her character. Since she is willing to try and destroy a family for money and fame, proved she has no morals. Disgusting tramp. https://t.co/fL0v29mOZM

@JonGordon49 @adage @robhatlabs @theashbhat I must agree they failed and are pissing off real people. Also there is no ability to contact on their website. I think they are the bot
@theashbhat According to your analysis, I am a bot., which I am not. When I go to your site to correct the information it will not allow me to contact you, so How exactly can one correct this info.
@IamTheRealJoan Oh, ok I get it now. I'm sorry I didn't realize you are dealing with your mental illness. All is forgiven, but just so you know the app  that tells you who is a bot is not correct, as I  am actually a person.
Don't you dare try to put that label on me, just because you don't like what I have to say. https://t.co/403Ij7GRXF

@lynncampm @jwall1955 @1994Nolan @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump By the way last time I checked guns can't fire themselves and by your logic we should ban cars because the cars kill more people a year than guns, while were at it, let's ban high fat foods because heart disease kills the most people.
@lynncampm @jwall1955 @1994Nolan @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump How about this, FACT: gun ownership in America has gone down DRASTICALLY over the years. Gun laws have been put in place maybe you should read them, get some personal perspective because reality is "less guns=more gun deaths" No Gun Zone= Killing spree
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump If this young person had one adult, one friend or a few random students asked him "are you okay man do you need someone to talk to?"instead of just pointing the finger and saying "he's going to be the next one to shoot up the school!" how was that helpful? The Community knew him!
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump Because there was a time once when parents teach their children compassion on one another and empathy and understanding. A time when it was encouraged to help a friend in need even if they weren't your friend but they were in need. A time when we reached out to those hurting.
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump Because as the old adage goes and most people have forgotten "it takes a village to raise a child".. so if the community The Village knew this poor childs situation that they lost their parents,  felt like an outsider then it was The Village responsibility to help this boy.

@Dinosgurl @realDonaldTrump Well actually it has to do with the fact that the power grid being a mess before the hurricane and all the state's currently in need of power poles which have to ordered, then made, then delivered. Texas, California, Florida &amp; Virgin Islands disasters need poles also. 64 deaths.

@Dinosgurl @realDonaldTrump Perhaps, ask FEMA and The American Red Cross, the president can't do everybody's job you know. Some of these government agencies that are in place for natural disaster relief need to actually do some relieving.
@brittnyjeangray @realDonaldTrump To actually do that, if it is a bad deal is not only irresponsible, but clearly stupid, you would actually prefer a bad deal to postponement?
@realDonaldTrump Yes they want to dance around and waste tax payers dollars and not get the job done and done correctly and when they don't get what they want, they will just pass the blame on to you for actually making things happen. Govt. No work, no pay, no exceptions.

@fletcha3 @ericabbott2239 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Also if an immigrant is working for less then its most likely because they're getting paid under the table and not paying taxes that's another problem. If they're working legally then they are getting paid minimum wage there's no other way around it
@fletcha3 @ericabbott2239 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews That is a very rude and predjuice thing to say. I certainly do not feel that way. If an immigrant is working in this country for less than what is paid to other people who are working in this country that is not on the entire population of the America that is on their employer.
@ExDemLatina WOW! REALLY WOW,  I actually like her I hope this is out of context, like maybe the the rest of the sentence went like this "before we can truly end racism" because if her sentence ends with "they just have to die that sounds like an ultimate punishment for ignorance, death
@1YankeeGirl1 @RieMcAz @VP @realDonaldTrump I thought most of the spouting was about Trump and Russia and Trump stealing the election  and Trump colluding with Russia and Trump did Bla bla bla, and I thought it was the media doing all the spouting until President Trumps tweet "fake news". Seems prez was right about media.
It's disgusting how we allow such public disrespect for the person who was elected by the people of the United States of America to fufill the office of President and Chief. Our country is losing its integrity due to ignorance and laziness. https://t.co/mSFAacL3HV
@Beragon @Bioben78 @espiers @NateSilver538 That statement is laughable Trump has been famous and in the media for well over 20 years, look into news from the 80's. If he committed crimes it was available for the media to find his life has been in the public spotlight most of his adulthood.
@NateSilver538 I guess violating security protocols and compromising the National Security of the United States of America then repeatedly lying about it after destroying evidence isn't exactly apocalyptic but it's a serious crime against the Country and every American citizen. Important tho.

@realDonaldTrump Discussing how the general pop. Accuses Trump of things that clearly he did not do. TRUMP didn't write the medical bill!
@Mike_P_Williams @realDonaldTrump Middle income, paid 10% of wages for med 2014 paid 25% 2016. It will cost less to pay the dr. Directly now
@realDonaldTrump Cap the premium insurance can charge sliding scale according to gross income. Or gov. Funded hospitals access for all.
@realDonaldTrump Sliding scale insurance premium, no tax breaks for all, subsidise hardship deductibles by income and severity with medicade
@williamlegate @Dzydvl Why should it be a right to have insurance subsidised by government(taxpayers dollars) you can get care without it.
@williamlegate @Dzydvl  Having medical insurance means cost coverage, you can still see a Dr or go to the ER you just get billed for it

@lococarl @RJSzczerba @realDonaldTrump people died because they couldn't afford insurance or because they were denied medical attention?
@HappyBeachHomes @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Pay the Dr. a monthly premium and cut the insurance company out. Carry only ER &amp; major care
@HappyBeachHomes @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Sounds good do they pay a premium? Or do we pay it for them? Because if we pay for it???
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump if your Healthcare cost more than your salary in the first place, you already have a problem. Insurance cost

I did not fact check the news paper source but it has links for direct government info. Please do your own homework  https://t.co/ErpT4xAExs
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump out of date information
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Healthcare not health insurance. If you have no insurance, that doesn't mean you can't get medical care.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump your video is 12 years old, a lot has changed in 12 years. Get a status update
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Trump didn't write the Bill it's not called Trump care. Presidents can't write up bills, stop blaming Trump

@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump exactly my point. How do you think the media got those tax records? Trump leaked it, it was brilliant.

@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump do more research on the subject please so you are informed, watch the videos of congress discussions
@RJSzczerba @realDonaldTrump my middle income family spent close to 26% of our income on medical in 2016 and the new premium is up again.
@RJSzczerba @realDonaldTrump yes but I paid 10% more of my income and $2000 more in deductible under Obama Care than prior to 2014.
@realDonaldTrump Why is it taking so long to just say there was no tap. Why dancing around the answer with carefully spoken words that imply
@realDonaldTrump the secrecy with which our his administration has performed in recent years is deplorable. Transparency  is greatly lacking
@realDonaldTrump he will continue to drain the swamp, still waiting to see the Presidents skeletons, the deceptive Nature of past president
@realDonaldTrump Quit undermining our president and stop demanding that he provide evidence yet allow everyone else to make up stories
@realDonaldTrump please someone who actually has real evidence that the current president outright lied present the evidence
@realDonaldTrump Put it in simple terms. "No wire tap or any other means of surveillance ordered, none approved, none performed" see simple!
