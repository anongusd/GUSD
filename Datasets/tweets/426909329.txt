CDC today celebrates the life of Betty Bumpers- one of the greatest public health heroes America has ever known. A former First Lady of Arkansas, her “Every Child by ‘74” immunization campaign was so successful that CDC used it as the model for a national immunization campaign.

Measles outbreaks in all regions illustrate how fragile gains in disease elimination can be and why it’s more important than ever to be vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable disease. Routine #immunization is critical to protect everyone, everywhere.
Due to low vaccine coverage nationally or in pockets, multiple regions have experienced large #measles outbreaks in 2017. Despite challenges, global efforts to eliminate measles continue to make progress. Since 2000, measles deaths decreased by 80%.  https://t.co/XFztf5YFFQ https://t.co/OKnKNf7AeN

@ncnative46 Poliomyelitis is caused by poliovirus. CDC tests every stool specimen from reported AFM cases for poliovirus; all specimens we’ve received tested negative. Because of high vaccination coverage against polio in the US &amp; globally, we no longer see cases of poliomyelitis in the US.
@RoseOfKali @CDCgov AFM is not a U.S.-specific issue and is well-documented in other countries across Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.  All stool specimens from AFM patients that CDC has received have tested negative for poliovirus.

We now know that overdoses from prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 16-year increase in #opioid overdose deaths. Drug overdose is one of few problems getting worse in the U.S. – it is affecting all ages, races, and communities.
In 2015, the number of opioids prescribed was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for 3 weeks. That’s too much.

The #opioidcrisis is a devastating and complex problem that requires action from all partners, including the business community. CDC remains committed to helping fight the epidemic by emphasizing what we know best – prevention. @USChamber
There are many additional consequences of the #opioidcrisis. Increased use of illicit opioids is sparking dangerous outbreaks of viral hepatitis and HIV infections among people who inject drugs.
In 2016, for every one person who died of an opioid overdose, there were 41 people living with a substance use disorder involving prescription opioids. Those impacted by the #opioidcrisis need effective interventions and support.
Amount of prescription #opioids prescribed was approximately three times as high in 2015 as it was in 1999 – enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for 3 weeks. #opioidcrisis
Wider availability of cheaper, more potent heroin has played a role in the growth of heroin use. Deaths from synthetic opioids, driven largely by illicitly manufactured fentanyl, tripled from 2013 to 2015. Almost 20,000 died from synthetic opioids in 2016. #opioidcrisis
Drug overdose is getting worse in the US – affecting all ages, races, and communities. The #opioidcrisis is being fueled by both prescription #opioids and illicit drugs, like heroin and illicitly-made fentanyl.

We at CDC, along with @HHSGov, @Surgeon_General, @PHEgov, @NIH, and @US_FDA are committed to working together to protect Americans during this challenging #flu season. Stay updated at https://t.co/9XXxTCLLPz.
For people who are very sick with #flu – or at high-risk of serious complications, such as children, the elderly, or pregnant women– we recommend prompt treatment with antiviral medications. This could mean the difference between a milder illness and a hospital stay or worse.
We recognize this #flu season has been hard on families and that we’ve lost too many children because of flu. CDC continues to recommend parents get their kids vaccinated each year against the flu.
This season’s #flu vaccine offered better protection against H3N2 for children six months to eight years old, with an estimated effectiveness of 51%. Overall, flu vaccine was 59% effective against both influenza A and B in children.
Vaccine effectiveness against this season’s dominant H3N2 #flu viruses was about 25%. However, the vaccine was better at protecting against the other circulating flu viruses. For example, it provided 67% protection against H1N1 and 42% against influenza B viruses.
According to estimates, U.S. #flu vaccines were 36% effective overall against influenza A and B. That might not sound impressive, but it means a vaccinated person reduced risk of getting sick with the flu and having to go to the doctor by about one-third.

I want to recognize that this #flu season has been hard on many so far. We can’t predict how much longer this season will last. But if we stay vigilant and take steps to fight flu, we can reduce the risk of getting – and transmitting – it.  Stay updated at https://t.co/Z25d8K3t8c
Watch for more severe #flu symptoms like persistent high fever, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat. Another severe symptom: you start to get better, then suddenly feel much worse. Seek medical attention immediately in this situation.
For those who are already sick, please stay home from work or school. Otherwise you run the risk of spreading #flu to others – and what may be mild symptoms to you could be deadly to someone else.
We continue to recommend antiviral treatment for people who are very sick with #flu or people who are at high risk of serious flu complications who develop flu symptoms.
#Flu can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections like bacterial pneumonia, so we recommend people 65 and over get the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine.
We continue to recommend getting the #flu vaccine to prevent flu. It’s true that flu vaccines often have lower effectiveness against H3N2 viruses. However, the vaccine’s effectiveness against other flu viruses is better. And some protection is better than none.
This #flu season continues to be particularly challenging. CDC’s latest tracking data indicate that flu activity is still on the rise overall. Influenza A H3N2 viruses continue to dominate this season, and are often linked to more severe illness.

You can reduce your risk of getting the #flu through everyday good health habits. Please stay home if you are sick to help prevent spreading respiratory viruses to others. We also recommend you frequently wash your hands. Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze.
Antiviral medications can help reduce #flu symptoms and shorten how long you are sick. Those who are very sick or at high risk of developing serious flu complications should be treated as soon as possible with antiviral drugs.
We continue to recommend #flu vaccine. Even though most flu vaccines have low effectiveness against H3N2 viruses, effectiveness against other flu viruses is better.  The vaccine may also reduce the severity of symptoms if you catch flu in spite of being vaccinated.
CDC’s latest data indicate that #flu activity is still high and widespread across most of the nation and increasing overall. Influenza A H3N2 viruses continue to dominate, but we are seeing other flu viruses, incl. H1N1 and influenza B, causing illness as well.
One of the biggest health threats we are facing right now is #flu. Flu is complex and difficult to predict.This season is a somber reminder of why flu is one of the world’s greatest public health challenges – and why we at CDC must remain vigilant in our efforts to fight flu.

HHS statement addressing media reports: "The assertion that HHS has 'banned words' is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process. HHS will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all Americans."

As part of our commitment to provide for the common defense of the country against health threats, science is and will remain the foundation of our work.

Every week, CDC updates the number of #Zika-related cases in the US. As of July 6, more than 1,130 travel-associated cases reported.
