@xtrixcyclex @DrDenaGrayson @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump If Putin told him to, he would.
@Dbehl33 @uncfan48003939 @AOC How? The comment makes no sense.
@LS7789fbb @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I think many Republicans are dying to get rid of Trump. They are just too spineless to say it publicly.  Either way, whether there are 60 votes or not in the Senate cannot be a factor whether the House Dems uphold justice or not.
Trump/Putin goal achieved.  Destabilize the US. @realDonaldTrump @OccupyDemocrats @tedlieu @MarkWarner @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters @GOP 		Government shutdown threatens US cyber security' | via @telegraph https://t.co/CoVyxHMjvz
@The_UnSilent_ @TelegraphTech Putin‚Äôs goal indeed!
@FareedZakaria @piersmorgan Exactly what Neville Chamberlain said too!
@thehill And just to practice, he‚Äôll crash the American economy first!
Treason. https://t.co/02d3Lte02H
@thehill Yep! Treason. @realDonaldTrump
@MarkHertling @The_UnSilent_ I sooo want to zoom out on this pic to see if they are holding hands.
@TheEconomist Well, the US has declared war on science, education, truth, knowledge...so it won‚Äôt take much for China to take over. That seems to be the Trump/Putin goal.
@CNNPolitics No one feels sorry for him.

@TPM What about Trump? @GOPLeader
@grantstern @OccupyDemocrats My guess is the @GOP has been taking illegal Russian money before Trump was even on the scene. @realDonaldTrump is simply the one who is clumsy enough to spill their secret.
@OccupyDemocrats @AOC @ResistanceParty @TheDemCoalition https://t.co/fvdsTjmvRr
@grantstern @OccupyDemocrats @FoxNews is complicit.
@CNNPolitics Rick Scott probably pocketed the $ himself!
Word is the @GOP is considering moving the 2020 RNC from Charlotte to Moscow. Lol! Closer to the boss.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The @GOP strategy is to destroy America. Dems must save America.
@jaketapper @AmericanCancer God bless your friend. Stay strong. Screen early.
@HillReporter The shutdown is part of the Trump/Putin agenda. Destabilize western economies, governments, institutions and alliances. @realDonaldTrump is a traitor!
@AOC @AOC and King sure isn‚Äôt the only one. @realDonaldTrump praised them as fine folks. @GOP too spineless or complicit to call either one out.
