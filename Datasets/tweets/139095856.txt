As far as I know, Trump still hasn't reached out to his predecessors who were targeted. 		*deep breath*

@AmyAlex63 or the fact that Apple (I think) built their new HQ with all those new employees but the town built basically NO new housing. Where are all those ppl gonna go?
Well, that's head in the sand, fantasy thinking. 5/5		PS, this applies to you to, D.C.
It's going to take hard work from government AND corporate citizens to come up with solutions - and some very difficult decisions are going to have to be made. But sweeping it under the rug, blaming life choices for homelessness, thinking building luxury apts will suffice? 4/
But I would argue that the first step is acknowledging what the tech boom has done to the housing market in SF and surrounding areas. Poverty is being pushed out of sight to the burbs, where they don't have the infrastructure to handle it in any real way. 3/
Think about the hotel workers who were on strike at our original Marriott conference hotel - these folks were working 2,3,4 jobs to afford to put food on the table. We heard from lots of smart folks who talked about the housing crisis and how there are no good answers 2/
So when I was in San Francisco last week for #comnet18 I met the most fascinating Uber and Lyft drivers. These were all folks who had "good" day jobs, but worked a second job to afford to live in SF. One man drove Uber to pay for parking. It made me think...1/
