@Toure I ain't trying to sit here and hate on you I just want to let you know if you believe what you say about Carson and the racist GOP...
@Toure ...to suggest that any political group in America today is actively looking to roll back minority civil rights is just fear mongering

Costas forgets that the Century 16 theater was a no gun zone anyway
Then he goes on to state all these reasons as to why we should "restrict" guns and states that carry laws didn't save ppl in Aurora
