@ericnus right, what I'm saying is the points about "oh but his grandchildren are jewish" are meaningless because it doesn't change the reality of what we can very plainly see him doing
there is absolutely nothing trump cares about more than seeing his base salivate and he knows exactly how to make that happen
how trump feels about jews himself is not the point, he saw early on that he could lean on anti-semitic rhetoric and dog whistles to whip up his base and has played into that as hard as humanly possible ever since — the effects are exactly the same
