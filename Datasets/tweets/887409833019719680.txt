Responding to hate with hate only generates more hate.
@RealJamesWoods You mean stuff like, the Senate not approving any Presidential cabinet appointees, then Congress and the press calling any cabinet level executive actions ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù because the cabinet was not confirmed by the Senate?
@realDonaldTrump Raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 25%, then, if China keeps its word, refund 15% after a year.
@wynnetha1 @SenatorHassan Except for the female babies who will die.  I guess they aren‚Äôt women yet.
@charliekirk11 You can‚Äôt socialize medical care onto a capitalist framework.  That is not affordable.  The only possible way is an approach which socializes the framework.  Problem there is the quality of care drops.
@CathoConser @WSJ If not for the marriage ban on clergy, married men would seek to become priests.  Pastors of other Christian denominations do not have the same issue (other issues maybe).
@THR So, unless you vote the way he wants, you have no live, are not wise and worst, are not even human.  This is directly offensive to many!

@ClimateHawk2 @snohomish360 @GovInslee @EPA @Interior Historically, the largest source of CO2 in the atmosphere has been from sources such as volcanoes.  Sea level change may release the clathrates and methane hydrates currently sequestered on the sea floor.  If these were all to be released, it would dwarf human sources.
@ClimateHawk2 @snohomish360 @GovInslee @EPA @Interior I do agree climate change is an issue - but it is a global issue, and anyone claiming the ‚Äúworld is going to end in 10 years‚Äù because of it is, quite simply, a quack.
@ClimateHawk2 @snohomish360 @GovInslee @EPA @Interior As far as credentials, I‚Äôve got a graduate degree in analytical chemistry (Texas A&amp;M) typically, I use journals (Such as JACS) and my experience is that people on Twitter know that CO2 causes warming, but chemically, don‚Äôt know why.  That would involve a knowledge of conjugation.
@ClimateHawk2 @snohomish360 @GovInslee @EPA @Interior I‚Äôve read estimates from multiple sources that approximately half of the known petroleum reserves have already been consumed.  This is since the mid-1800s.  I‚Äôve also seen journal reports which place climate change at an increase of around 1‚Ä¢/100yrs since then. https://t.co/cDfyfxE0Sc
@ClimateHawk2 @GovInslee @EPA @Interior Over what time period?
@RepKarenBass So, what are your thoughts on Al Sharpton‚Äôs rise to fame then?
@GovInslee @EPA @Interior I‚Äôm not saying we should do this but mathematically I believe we could burn through the remaining oil and gas reserves both tapped in untapped and the resulting climate change would be approximately 1¬∞ globally over the next 50 years.

@CNNPolitics @KamalaHarris There has been quite a few suckers for misinformation all over the media lately.  This was without an investigation.  An abundance of information means nothing to those who have already shown that they jump to conclusions with no information.

@DanCrenshawTX @Americanpie48 They block Steve Scalise, a confessional member and gun violence victim, from speaking on such matters on the house floor and in its committee chambers all the time. They pick and choose their victims to fit a narrative, but they do disservice to truth in doing so. All political.
@robbystarbuck @SpeakerPelosi Only the President is Constitutionally authorized to ceremonially represent the US in international affairs. This is meant to prevent political stunts, such as this, from occurring and potentially subverting the national interest. Nancy knows this, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a harmless hug.
@justinamash @TheDemCoalition Based on your argument, the first thing to do is end Obama‚Äôs overreach.  That would establish the precedent you claim to stand on. @PressSec
@Lrihendry Did he ever notify the authorities as to the status or activities of his daughter, a known, self-proclaimed ISIS/terrorist group member?  Abetting terrorists is a serious crime.  She was married to men who bragged to her about decapitating Americans, and was ok with it.
@greggutfeld I‚Äôm pretty sure he redacted all his dealer contacts from the list he sent police.  I‚Äôm sure those guys REALLY appreciate being put on the radar.  See, Jussie‚Äôs drug problem means he is directing blame at those dealers...
@WSJ Step 1.  Comb the Vatican archives for guidance on the sexuality of the first group of bishops.	Step 2.  Realize that these disciples were able to have relationships.	Step 3.  Realize that clergy not marrying is because of outdated papal mandate.	Step 4.  Update papal mandate.
@RealJamesWoods Sounds like a Saturday night in West Hollywood.
@RealSaavedra I guess nobody does ‚Äúhumble‚Äù anymore.

@thehill I gotta go with Pres Trump on this one.  MY ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù is that formal contracts are not written up in memos (memorandum) and, understanding means comprehension of information, not agreement to action.  Don‚Äôt be played by semantics.

@MattFinnFNC @BretBaier Can you picture the two of them as cell mates?
@bhweingarten @SebGorka It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúUS census‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt distinguish citizens from non-citizens.  It is a ‚Äúsuper-long survey questionnaire‚Äù of people (hopefully) in North America.  It doesn‚Äôt ask about legal status, and is optional, and participants self-report.
@yaf @DineshDSouza @dartmouth All they did was sit in the back and try and disrupt what was supposed to be a forum for scholarly discourse.  Essentially turning an open-invitation discussion to a disorderly political protest.  Protest outside.

@thehill She strikes me as being more of a ‚Äúbrush‚Äù kind of girl, but what do I know...???
@thehill What this really means is that people gave the government LESS of an interest-free loan this year.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Of course.  She deleted her emails for a reason.  Normal people click delete.  Not normal people use special wiping software and physically destroy the storage device.  Things happen for a reason.
@thehill Does Mitch even have to bring such a bill to the floor?
@greta Especially considering that the banks got that money at 0% interest (maybe 0.25 or 0.5%) and they automate the entire system.   I wish I could borrow money at 0% from the Fed and loan it out to lenders whom, by law, cannot default (unless they are the children of congressmen!!!).
@MSNBC @NicolleDWallace Because he‚Äôs learned that commenting immediately, like so many did in support of Smollett, does not always speak to truth.
@BobCusack And then, the veto.  Any defectors know a veto is coming, and are simply saving face politically.  It would be interesting if they would also vote to override a veto, if necessary.
@marklevinshow She, like the President, is the head of a co-equal branch of government.  What‚Äôs good for the goose is good for the gander.
@AOC How much is she paying her boyfriend (who she hired on her staff, and who acted as a proxy for her taking in lobbyist and activist resources.)
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog This is ridiculous.  You are calling out the White House for doing the exact same thing you are doing.   The left has spent two years calling the President the ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù AND taking up any narrative, true or false, which paints them negatively. @PressSec Stop the hate. https://t.co/Uael8HNnoR
@NBCNews It‚Äôs a GOOD thing there was no hate crime.
@wikileaks It‚Äôs pretty easy to check a truck for guns.  It‚Äôs not easy to explain to the world why you care more about holding power than the wellbeing of your citizens.  The UN should not acknowledge Maduro‚Äôs false claim to power by conducting such negotiations with him.  This is biased.

@DiamondandSilk I‚Äôm sick of Maxine Waters saying Trump ‚Äúdog whistles,‚Äù when she herself ‚Äúdog whistled‚Äù Jussie Smollett calling on him and others to push back using any means necessary.
@NBCNews He would have acted the part of Nero - playing the fiddle as Rome burns - if his actions sparked race riots.  Rodney King - ‚Äú can‚Äôt we all just get along?‚Äù
@GordonGChang I agree. Trump should stay on schedule with the tariffs, sticking to his original negotiation stance, and not falling for the stalling tactics. I prefer lower domestic taxes with a higher sticker price on ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù goods. They still have higher tariffs (and VATs) than we do
@charliekirk11 I would not want to be in as racially tense an environment as state jail with his reputation.  He‚Äôs facing long-term solitary for protective reasons.
@HillaryClinton The NDA signed by Mrs. Clinton as Secretary of State is significant because she was "advised that unauthorized disclosure, retention, or negligent handling" of top secret material was a federal offense.  Destroying federal records was election meddling.
@SteveScalise So, they are gerrymandering with the biggest electoral line in the country.
@PraiseKekDotCom @MSNBC Sure.  Then they developed a nuclear-powered cruise missile/torpedo which completely violated the spirit, if not the language of that agreement.
@MSNBC Don‚Äôt they already target the US with thousands of ICBMs?
@realDonaldTrump This may sound nuts, but I think you should meet Jussie Smollett in person and ask him directly why he hates you.  Remember when the Pope met the man who shot at him and washed his feet?  I think you have a chance to publicly ‚Äúturn the other cheek‚Äù with Jussie... https://t.co/1zIPOwoDVY
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends In China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and innumerable other countries, this would be high treason.
@redsteeze Maxine Waters keeps accusing President Trump of ‚Äúdog whistling,‚Äù but in this case, she was the one blowing the whistle- encouraging ‚Äúpush-back.‚Äù  Not surprisingly, she was at the Troubadour watching him perform days after the incident.

@realDonaldTrump 55 miles this year.  Then, next budget cycle (in a year) another 100 miles. Then, when you get re-elected, it will be a mandate to declare a national emergency and build the remainder of what is necessary. All structures require a foundation and you‚Äôve got that.

@maddow A poll of 1,004 participants can NEVER statistically be representative of tha American voting population, even by the largest of confidence intervals.  This poll INTENTIONALLY omitted key demographics breaking down the voting sample by political affiliation. @PressSec
@madsr57 @NBCNews @CNBC If you look at the actual poll you find that everything you find is true.  The sample size is too small to be representative of all Americans by even the largest of acceptable confidence intervals.  Any reporter covering this as objective needs a basic education in statistics.
@NBCNews @CNBC This poll is bogus.  It is of less than 1000 participants, issued by a liberal institution, and the demographics of the participants was strongly leaning to the left.  The real insight in the poll is that overall support for the wall has INCREASED over the last year. @PressSec
@realDonaldTrump It is the first piece of literature ever printed, as well as the best-selling book of all time.  It would be educationally negligent to not study it, at least from a non-religious perspective.

This results in the propagation and amplification of the magnetic wave component.  Magnetism!!! https://t.co/rLpPMs4Mwr

@SenatorLankford A recent large tax cut should partially offset this increased cost.		Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages - on the national, not individual corporate scale? 		Dependence on other countries for raw industrial materials has national security implications.

.. or find another cosigner.  If the gun owner commits any illegal Acts then the co-signers would be legally liable for negligence as it is their responsibility to make sure that any gun they signed for is in responsible hands.
Perhaps every gun owner should have at least two other people who co-sign on the gun.  It would be their responsibility to do regular checks on the gun owner and if it any point they don't think the person should own a gun then the gun owner would either have to give up the gun..
The key idea is not diminishing an individual's right to bear arms, but regulating how groups of people who bear arms keep an eye on one another, for the greater good of society.
Such militia could and should bear responsibility for keeping track not only of the arms their members bear, but also the mental state of their fellow members whom they allow to bear arms.  Other members of a militia could be held legally responsible fellow members actions w/guns
"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"	This 2nd amendment suggests those wishing to bear arms 'SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE MEMBERS OF WELL-REGULATED MILITIA.'
The nature of the Second Amendment suggest that those who wish to bear arms might ought to be members of well-regulated militia
It's interesting how the states with the highest percentage of their Mexican /US border already walled, are against the construction of a wall.

@FoxNews If you could go to an American military parade, would you go?
@SenatorCardin @NASA Unfortunately, Turks and Kurds are killing each other.  The US military has been aiding the Kurds.  Turkey does not like this.  Since the US and Turkey are NATO allies, their hands are tied, thus a silent war - with victims such as this doctor emerges.
@yashar As gross as this is - it makes sense...
@SenatorLankford This is likely in 'silent' protest to American collaboration with Kurdish forces.
@VP Unfortunately, I doubt North Korea will ever voluntarily abandon their nuclear program.  The best resolution would be a revolution of the North Korean people.  This is what their leaders fear most - not an American invasion.

After phenomenal growth in the Dow it seems natural that many investors are simply wishing to take some profits at this point.

@jimmykimmel @StormyDaniels Lol

Question : which ideas from the people concerning tax reform or healthcare are informing congress - or is congress being informed by a void?
That void is filled by less desirable substance-lobbyists, foreign interests, congressional or partisan groupthink, even fear or speculation
The ideas of the people should be what informs Congress.  When partisanship filters out ideas before they get to congress it leaves a void.
Ideally, legislation begins with an idea shared amongst people.  Congress then draws it formally.  Finally, the President signs it into law.

How hard would it be to send the USS Enterprise to Puerto Rico to augment the power system there while they rebuild the grid?
In 1953, N. Korea agreed not to "execute any hostile act within, from, or against the demilitarised zone".  An ICBM flyover violated this.
@QueerCurmudgeon Directly associating NASCAR with white supremacy and basketball with Black Lives Matter is a faulty deduction of composition.
