@SikhsForTrump A wall is a wasteful and static single point of failure that will not do what Jar Jar promises. There is no data to back it up and justify throwing $5 billion away rather than invest it in measures that would actually work. You know, the fiscally conservative approach.
@SikhsForTrump Dumbest argument ever for a 2000 mile border wall at a minimum taxpayer cost of $5 billion. Nobody is arguing against improving border security. All we're saying is listen to the experts and the data, not the self styled "stable genius".

@socal_american @GOP In fairness, the GOP hasn't been fiscally conservative since at least Reagan. They only insist on restraint when Dems put forth important programs to help women, minorities, and the non-wealthy. However, they've never seen an unpaid for tax cut for the rich they didn't love.

@fk_eduardo @carterforva So the people elect the members of the National Assembly, Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court strips the AN of power because Maduro's party lost the majority, Maduro creates a new Asamblea Constituyente loyal to him, the legitimate AN makes a Constitutional claim to remove Maduro,
@fk_eduardo @carterforva You're not seriously standing up for Maduro, are you? If so, I hereby revoke your Doctor Who imagery privileges. ;)
@williamlegate @AOC The way I see it, the Venezuelan National Assembly's removal of Nicolas Maduro from office is effectively the same as the United States Congress removing a president via impeachment. If President Pelosi asked all ambassadors in DC to stay, what should they do?

@Dylan_CG_M @carterforva It remains to be seen. From my understanding this is a constitutional battle, rather than a military coup. Having said that, no way this removal of Maduro sticks without the military honoring the AN's claim.
Very important ask of my friends in the #Resistance:  The people of #Venezuela made today possible. To make this all about Trump and US imperialism is to deny la #ResistenciaVenezolana their hard fought victory. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üáªüá™üáªüá™
@ChrisMurphyCT Senator, the full power of American foreign policy hasn't done jack since Hugo Chavez first came to power. The Venezuelan people and their duly elected Asamblea Nacional made this happen. I give the Trump administration zero credit except for acknowledging President Guaid√≥. üá∫üá∏üáªüá™
@leahmcelrath @KarenAttiah Without serious evidence, please leave Potus Putin Puppet out of this. Venezuelans are dumpster diving for food, not for lack of money but for lack of food. If the National Assembly's claim is legitimate, then it's no different than removing an American President by impeachment.
@Dylan_CG_M @carterforva It's possible. One thing that makes me doubt Trump played a part is that he's a fucking moron. And if he had any capacity for self-reflection he'd realize he and Maduro are cut from the same cloth.
@JackGlastra @NBCNews Sorry, you lost me. I don't support coups. All I'm saying is that, for argument's sake, if (yes, that's a big if) the AN's claim is legally allowed by their constitution, how would it be any different from us removing a president via impeachment?
@ClistonBrown If the US Senate were to convict Trump and Pence in impeachment trials, should our allies refuse to work with a President Pelosi because Trump continues to call himself president?		If the Venezuelan AN's constitutional claim is legitimate, then what is the US supposed to do?
@JackGlastra @NBCNews It may be. I'm trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. Regardless, Maduro has to go. If the AN legitimately found a constitutional way to do it, then all the better.
@samswey The headline buries the lede. Venezuela declared Maduro's presidency illegitimate and made constitutional claim to install the President of the AN as interim President of Venezuela. Potus Putin Puppet had nothing to do with this. If he did, he would've fucked the whole thing up.
RT @ripple2012: TRUTH !!! https://t.co/CWxE3bvrb0

@realDonaldTrump Step 2:  Send immigration lawyers, social workers, and anyone else needed to help process these asylum requests as quickly and effectively as possible while screening for possible traffickers. These families need help; this is not an invasion.
@cwebbonline @realDonaldTrump True deal makers negotiate in good faith and honor their agreements. Donald does neither.
@realDonaldTrump The humanitarian crisis involves families fleeing war and drug violence being blocked from requesting asylum at the US border against federal law. You have made it worse by separating families and neglecting children. Step 1 is to honor the deal you made and open the government.
@realDonaldTrump "I won, so I'm right" is a toddler's defense. The reality is you are clueless, rudderless, unethical, amoral, and widely known for reneging on deals you clearly negotiated in bad faith. Your plan so far has resulted in children dying and the folks on the front lines going unpaid.
@realDonaldTrump If you're gonna lie, lie big and lie stupid, right comrade? And when one day you decide to tell the truth about something, nobody will believe you.

@realDonaldTrump 800,000 federal workers aren't getting paid because you reneged on a deal to keep the government open. This includes the men and women of CBP, ICE, TSA, and the Coast Guard. You are putting national security at increasing risk, because Fox hurt your feelings. Fuck your feelings.

@slothpilot @JohnnyGringo101 @SaysHummingbird We should not be giving $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the already wealthy and highly profitable.
@slothpilot @JohnnyGringo101 @SaysHummingbird Obama left office with a 6 year job growth streak. More jobs means more tax revenue. More tax revenue means lower budget deficit. To your point, though, annual deficits still add to the outstanding national debt. In times of economic growth we should be paying down that debt.
@slothpilot @JohnnyGringo101 @SaysHummingbird Folks like to criticize dems as freely borrowing money we don't have. In fact, the GOP is the more consistent record of doing just that, i.e. the 2018 tax scam. The ACA, for example, provided a tremendous boost to the economy including sustained growth of healthcare jobs.
@slothpilot @JohnnyGringo101 @SaysHummingbird In recent decades, Dems have been more successful at reducing the annual deficit when possible. Clinton left office with a budge surplus that got quickly wiped out under GWB and by the 2008 recession. The only way to pay down the debt is to have sustained budget surpluses.

@JohnnyGringo101 @slothpilot @SaysHummingbird I didn't even include the Wall St. (GWB) and auto industry (BHO) bailouts, Those were loans that were since repaid with interest.

@claudester @xtrixcyclex @BillKristol @LindaMLC @GOP That's on us in 2020.
@xtrixcyclex @BillKristol @LindaMLC @GOP I don't see Trump resigning unless staying somehow becomes worse than walking out in handcuffs. Even if the House votes to impeach, it takes 2/3 of the Senate to remove him from office. Based on what we've seen of the modern day Republican party, that seems unlikely.
@xtrixcyclex @BillKristol @LindaMLC Chris, don't underestimate the insanity and blind loyalty of today's GOP. Even if Mueller proves conspiracy against US beyond a reasonable doubt, it still requires ~20 Republican senators to vote to convict. I would not take that bet.
@realDonaldTrump You are fucking insane. I don't mean that as hyperbole; you are literally insane and the single greatest danger this country faces. https://t.co/cmB3bj45Sr
