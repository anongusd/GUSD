@WalshFreedom The DNC servers where wide open. JAR 16 20296 lists in detail the most basic deterrents and the most basic measures of cybersecurity that were NOT followed by the DNC. Does the DNC have ANY responsibility for their own security?

@samstein 15. I've tried to see my doctor, but with Obama care, my deductible is $7500.00 plus my left testicle.
@samstein 14 Please Sam, I need your help. if anyone asks me a question i can only reply  "i vill wote for trump and then ve kill moose and squirrel"
@samstein 13 You can imagine my horror, Sam, then clear as day I said it again "i vill wote for trump and then ve kill moose and squirrel"
@samstein 12. Much, I struggled to close Facebook, and for the first time I heard myself say it "I vill Wote for Trump" I now had a Russian accent
@samstein 11. Strain Hillary's body was under having to carry the weight of Putin on her back, now Putin yelled "Hillary Sucks Ass" Sam, it was too
@samstein 10. Putin was riding Hillary like a horse, saddle and all, (yes even saddlebags) I could see, even with 33000 deleted yoga emails, the...
@samstein 9. No matter what I did all I could hear was "Hillary Sucks Ass" From Putin's golden voice, shirtless on his horse, only it wasn't a horse..
@samstein 8. as you can imagine I was overcome with both shock and horror, I mean I had just had "I'm with her" tattooed on my tiny liberal Pean
@samstein 7. Putin looked a me, really right through me, like he could see into my very soul, and said "Hillary Sucks Ass"
@samstein 6. soon after visions of Vladimir Putin were dancing in my head, he was shirtless (of course) riding a horse on a sunny russian day
@samstein 5. and i was overcome by a need to eat borscht, drink vodka, and wear counterfeit Adidas tracksuits every day, so comfortable yet stylish
@samstein 4.I was posting a picture of my new tattoo on Facebook when I saw a Russian Ad, lightning bolts shot from my screen directly to my nipples
@samstein 3. in March of 2016 I had just returned from the tattoo parlor where i had just had "i'm with her" tattooed on my Dick
@samstein 2. Now finally I can tell my story to you and hopefully with your truthful reporting congress and maybe the military will act on my behalf
@samstein 1. Thank you, Sam, without you and your high journalistic standards I wouldn't have the courage to admit that I was influenced By Russia
