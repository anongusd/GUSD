@MeghanMcCain No Ms. Meghan I have not. Not returned since the war, this is the one area that your father would not discuss. I have many memories of him, letters concerning issues of policy, his genuine concern for my disabled children &amp; a handwritten note of health resources for me. Miss him.

@Sophie2078 I would be extremely disappointed in the male species, based on your wit, beauty, and utter sexuality to not be aroused.
@HeyoShellz As stunningly beautiful with raw sexuality as you are, I find it unbelievable that you don't have romantic, passion filled evenings, every evening.
@Sophie2078 Please, that's disturbing even for sarcasm......I'd provide the former.....
@Sophie2078 I would truly love the connection, being together, sharing, however I would be extremely disappointed if I could not bring you complete satisfaction, and would not stop, until it was achieved.
@blueorsomething If that's your case, I certainly hope not, as you're simply too beautiful to go that way.
@Sophie2078 Don't I truly wish

The #ENLISTAct is a scheme to normalize amnesty for illegal immigration and essentially codify Obama‚Äôs unlawful executive amnesty.
we need to fix healthcare in America. The #AHCA must: 	1. Repeal Taxes	2. Reform Medicaid	3. Empower States
The #ENLISTAct keeps alive Obama Admin policies that give unlawful immigrants an instant green card &amp; promises near-instant citizenship

Stand strong and vote ‚ÄúNO‚Äù on AHCA unless significant reforms are made. We must #RepealObamacare
Obamacare would be repealed if Title 1 regulations are removed -- allowing the free markets to drive down healthcare costs. #RepealObamacare
More regulations = more subsidies. We must put patients first and #RepealObamacare
We need healthcare that works for all Americans. Conservatives must vote ‚ÄúNO‚Äù on AHCA unless major changes are made #RepealObamacare
Senators -- #ConfirmGorsuch now! We want a judge who will follow the law, not their policy preferences.
Gorsuch has a strong record of defending religious liberty and upholding the proper role of the courts. The Senate must #ConfirmGorsuch
The Senate must act now to ensure he is confirmed and placed on the Supreme Court #ConfirmGorsuch
Judge Gorsuch is a strong constitutionalist and an excellent replacement for the late Justice Scalia. #ConfirmGorsuch
2 major issues with #AHCA: 	1. Fails to remove Obamacare‚Äôs regulatory structure	2. Continues to subsidize expensive health insurance plans
#AHCA only takes small steps against #Obamacare‚Äôs regulatory structure. We voted for #FullRepeal.
#AHCA tweaks, but doesn‚Äôt end harmful Obamacare regulations. Congress must do more to reduce the cost of health insurance #FullRepeal
Enough is enough. We need to get a health care that works for all Americans. We must fix #AHCA now
