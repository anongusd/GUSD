It says a lot when the most substantive argument against Ayn Rand that professors of philosophy seem to be able to make is to try and make her the punchline of a joke. "She is awful." Shouldn't an educator be more interested in dialogue than belitting and shutting someone down. https://t.co/51TDK1A6eL
How do people get away with using the phrase "crony capitalism" when it is such an obvious contradiction in terms? Cronyism is a direct result of government regulation and intervention and is directly proportional to the degree of "mix" in a mixed economy.
@HillaryClinton @KathyKLTran @pwcdanica @JCarrollFoy @DelegateFowler Why do people always thank the generous and selfless politicians, but never thank the people who actually worked to create values which were then exchanged for money which was then taken by force by the politicians so that they can give it in the first place?

"Hate crimes" are an anti-concept. When one person violates the rights of another, there should be no subjective evaluation of their motives as being better or worse. They are all equally offensive; one motivation shouldn't result in a lighter/harsher punishment than another.

No one owes the government any portion of their life or livelihood. It can only take the life, liberty, and property of its citizens as punishment for crimes.
When the inconsistency of the draft with the natural rights to life and liberty was finally recognized this abominable policy was abolished. When will the government finally recognize the incapability of taxes with the right to property?
“The only “obligation” involved in individual rights is an obligation imposed, not by the state, but by the nature of reality: consistency, which, in this case, means the obligation to respect the rights of others, if one wishes one’s own rights to be recognized and protected.”
“[An obligation to the state or society] implies that rights are a gift from the state, and that a man has to buy them by offering something (his life) in return.”	-Ayn Rand #RandRead #CUI
@jaketapper @brianschatz Yes, it is so immoral to have an obligation for any country to send it's soldiers in defense of another. A soldier's sole purpose is to defend the rights of the citizens of their nation from foreign aggression, not to serve as a sacrifice for another country (even an ally).
@SenatorCantwell And only at the cost of the freedom of private citizens to run their lives and businesses as they see fit. Oh, and though the seizure of their livelihoods.
RT @JohnStossel: Bingo https://t.co/v8L0W5bBrP
RT @JohnStossel: Absolutely true. But so hard to convince voters. https://t.co/1WcrkBjrx9
So when a government claims its citizens have a right to something that only they can provide (or that someone else can be made to provide) we should be suspicious, because these "rights" can only come at the expense of the natural rights of others.
Natural rights are universal, independent of nation, race, sex, etc. What varies is the extent to which governments fail to protect them. A right is never gained from or granted by someone, it can only be recognized and defended.

1. Rand would never agree with people actively "bringing doom" to people, unless it simply meant leaving them to their own destruction	2.

Again, Rand decried the shackling of anyone by the law and conventions, but identified those most persecuted as the great.

Hey @realDonaldTrump “The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition of trade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges”		Ayn Rand. “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.”
@SageThinker99 Sounds great! Thanks!
@SageThinker99 Haha, I just wanted to be sure we kept the topic to Ayn Rand so the addition seemed necessary.
@SageThinker99 I guess that's another part of her philosophy which is so meaningful to me. She recognizes that everyone's life experiences are different and everyone has different values and she realized that there is no way that a government can make decisions for such a diverse population.
@SageThinker99 That sounds a bit conspiracy theory-ish to me. Can you be more specific? Who holds what power over whom?
@SageThinker99 What political power does a company have under Laissez-Faire Capitalism?
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz We should be encouraging people to think critically and make good decisions for their lives, not relying on a patriarchal government "Daddy" that keeps us safe. Humans are amazing rational animals that can think for themselves.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz By the time the government realizes there is a problem and starts to plan laws, everyone already knows about the issue and it starts to be resolved on its own. Would you buy a tonic now even if it were legal? Would you work for a company that locked you in?
@SageThinker99 Tyranny is an abuse of political power and Rand believed that businesses shouldn’t have political power.
@SageThinker99 I'm not sure I follow you on capitalism being tyranny. Capitalism has nothing to do with the government. It is the complete separation of state and economics.
@SageThinker99 Yeah, I read a little of her work when I was around that age too, but didn't get much out of it. Only as I have gotten older have I started to see its value. It is something that really you need a lot of life experience to start to get a grasp on.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz I never think that trying to understand other people's point of view is nonsense. I'm sorry you feel that way.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Also, If you are going to start getting snarky, I don't really care to continue the conversation. I only come on here to deal with decent respectful people.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz What arguments haven't I addressed?
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz That is actually a common fallacy. If you would like proof, the records all exist in the Ayn Rand Institute archives.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Government is a purely reactive force and cannot actively seek to do anything of its own volition. When it can decide that it can actively pursue a cause to protect some people it always will act at the expense of another group.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz It's ok if that's the best you can come up with. Debate can be challenging.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Beating the argument that I should explain something to people who have been dead for a century?
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Thank you for telling me what I believe, but you missed some things. I believe government is a necessary good which protects natural rights. I'm sorry if you don't have any more arguments for me.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Businesses who actually harm people should be held responsible. Do you work for profit? Is that a bad thing? Businesses with happy healthy employees produce more high quality products which means more profits. And if employees don't like the choices they can start a business.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Is that your best argument?
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz In this case, if they didn't allow employees to leave when they wanted to, they were impeding their liberty, which is something the government should protect people from. But this is basic rights from the Constitution and new laws for specific instances aren't necessary.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Employers don't legally have to be decent. If they harm the life, liberty, or property of their employees, then they must be held responsible, but other than that employees should quit if they don't like the way their employers runs things.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz But they didn't think they needed the laws until after the deaths.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz That might not have sounded clear. My point is employees changing their policies and the government passing laws occurred simultaneously and after the deaths had already occurred.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz The laws only came into existence after their deaths brought attention to the issue. The laws wouldn't have saved them either.
When the government fixes low prices it is for the "public good," but when businesses fix low prices it is out of a selfish intent to monopolize. #RandRead #CUI
@SageThinker99 They bring me hope that people care about living in a world free of force and where everyone only participates in voluntary relationships. She had such a positive view of the potential of individual humans and of what we can accomplish free of tyranny.
Laws cannot be "fluid" or interpretable. They must be precise and objective, based on unchanging principles. #RandRead #CUI

@SageThinker99 Her essays bring me so much joy as well!
When government starts getting involved in business (decided how they should be run) business ends up getting involved in government. The more government regulation, the more cronyism and lobbying businesses must use to try to maintain an environment in which they can thrive.
Is this equal protection under the law?
If unions can have a government protected monopoly on the supply of labor, how can the government prevent businesses from having a monopoly on the supply of a particular good? Individuals are free to come together to mutual benefit, unless those individuals run businesses...

Well, my first foray into twitter debate has left me pleasantly surprised! I have encountered thoughtful people who acted respectfully and presented their views well. Encountered a couple of duds, but overall I am encouraged!
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz They stopped because companies had to start competing to attract the best workers and so they began improving working conditions and giving better compensation. And because they realized that under better conditions workers are more productive.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz The issues of terrible worker conditions weren't stopped as a result of government intervention. They stopped after terrible incidents occurred (which inspired the laws) which were publicized by journalists and everyone was made aware of them.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz As a matter of freedom, yes. The majority can't vote away freedom. A business that labels their products dishonestly is constantly at risk of being exposed, which would undermine their credibility making customers unwilling to buy their product, which puts them out of business.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Um... I said "Businesses that have harmful policies or inadequate products only survive if the government forces people to buy them." This business didn't survive.
@ntlsheresisted @AWBlanchette @thefaycat @brianschatz If a company makes people sick with their products, then they should certainly be held responsible. That costs them money. Money is an extremely effective incentive for them to use safe practices in running their businesses.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Then as some factories had better conditions than others, others had to improve their own conditions to attract the best workers. Free market competition raises the standard of living for everyone, lowering prices and improving working conditions.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Actually worker conditions in larger factories had already started improving before unionization as owners realized that children weren't efficient workers and that under bad conditions workers couldn't reach maximum productivity.
@ntlsheresisted @AWBlanchette @thefaycat @brianschatz Seeking profit is the reason companies produce things of value to people. If a product isn't valued, no one will want to buy it. Profit seeking=finding a need and satisfying it.
@ntlsheresisted @AWBlanchette @thefaycat @brianschatz Think of relatively unregulated industries such as tech. They are allowed to innovate freely and have done so at unprecedented rates. If drug companies had that much freedom the amount of sickness would plummet and as a result they would earn tons of money. Win-win.
@ntlsheresisted @AWBlanchette @thefaycat @brianschatz It's much cheaper to come up with rehashes because they are based on things already FDA approved. It's like how American choices of sunscreen are decades behind Europe because the FDA won't approve them. This means more cancer and more death. https://t.co/FopbbWUxdQ
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Life, liberty, and property are inalienable rights, meaning even a democratic  majority vote cannot take them away. Your right to serve who you want is your liberty. Your money is your property.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And just because the majority believes something is right doesn’t make it so. The majority used to believe women shouldn’t work outside the home and that gays couldn’t marry, but they never had the right to vote those rights away.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And do you wear your seat belt because it’s the law or because you want to be safe? Advocate, teach people, but regulation is unnecessary. People who know these laws exist and follow them know why the reason why. Most follow them to be safe not to avoid punishment.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I mean, what incentive do drug companies have to develop safe effective drugs and why would restaurants want there food to not make people sick?
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz The FDA makes it nearly impossible for drug companies to create new effective medications. I guess they do protect us from evil restaurants which will cut every corner and feed us poison if it weren’t for the FDA looking over their shoulder.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz You seem to have an image of a Disney villain in your head when you picture business owners...
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And what mining company wants to hire 8 year olds? I don’t think they would bring much value to any company. They aren’t the most productive workers.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Businesses will not be able to keep many good employees if they don’t provide suitable working conditions or adequate compensation. Employees are always free to negotiate their terms of working for someone and to leave if the wish.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I’m glad you brought these up. I believe all property should be private, and anyone who owns water, especially if they want to sell it for drinking, will keep it clean and sue anyone who dumps in it.
@OSovol @SallyforPeace @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Can’t come up with a single argument? Thank you though for your keen observations. They have really elevated this respectful debate.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz A tax comes with a threat to comply or be punished. The gun is metaphorical.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz What are your specific criteria for which health related measures are the business of the government and which aren’t?
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz If laws can be made to require taxpayers to save the lives of our society, then can laws be passed to save society from itself? Outlawing junk food, smoking, excessive drinking, and unprotected sex. Mandatory exercise regimens. These might save more lives than healthcare.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Then do that, and advocate and convince people to do the same, but please don’t hold a gun to people and say help or go to prison. That’s what a law is. A threat against noncompliance.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Would you donate money to help the child? I probably would especially if I knew the parents. Charities are wonderful ways to help such cases and all funds are freely given without the need for threats.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And the reality that ins. companies need to make a profit to grow and continue to do business? Without profits they go bankrupt and no one gets treatment and more people die.
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And my point is that not saving someone is not the same as killing them. Why do you add the caveat “In healthcare” to when greed kills? By your standard doesn’t your own greed kill people too? Are your enjoyments in life worth more than someone else’s life?
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz And does someone’s unwillingness to regulate themselves in the way you want mean that there should be a law forcing them to follow your values? If the majority votes that women need to regulate themselves and only wear modest clothing should it be made a law?
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Why should deciding to open one particular kind of business immediately make you a slave to the needs of “the people”?
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Do you ever decide to spend money on something you don’t absolutely need instead of donating it? Are you a greedy, money grubbing villain?
@AWBlanchette @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz So is anyone who isn’t donating every penny that they don’t absolutely need to support the sick leaving them to die? What makes it a private company’s job and not yours? How many people could you provide healthcare for if you lived on the absolute minimum?
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz They will do what is in their interest which is to provide the best quality product to the most people at the most cost. Businesses that have harmful policies or inadequate products only survive if the government forces people to buy them.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz And not helping someone is not the same as harming someone. Buying coffee instead of donating your $3 is not helping someone. Throwing your coffee in someone’s face is harming them.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Some peoples’ code of ethics are ok with sacrificing a few for the good of the many. My code of ethics says no one can be sacrificed unwillingly when the “society” gangs up on them.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz I support policies which has never been fully implemented so they can’t have been “proven” to do anything. America is full of a wide array of individuals with varying codes of ethics which the government must respect. It can’t have to power to choose how we act.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz By this logic these things won't be paid for with slave labor. A civil society doesn't force people to work even with the best intentions. The ends never justify the means. If you want to kick someone out of the society, try the slavers first.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz The government already seizes their money to pay for these things so they are disincentivized. Also they are forced to waste tons of money lobbying in Washington (a result of the government's power over them), earning favors so they aren't victims to new regulation.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz I do agree with you that businesses benefit a great deal from good infrastructure and educated people, which is why I'm sure many would invest in those things free of coercion.
@ntlsheresisted @saywhat95 @brianschatz Again, no matter who benefits or not, the ends cannot justify the means. Coercing people to pay money for any cause under threat of fines or imprisonment can't be justified, even for even the best causes.
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Supplying a service involves a customer and a service provider. A person who receives a product and a person who creates the product. When the person who provides the product has no choice, it is slavery (even if the "master" provides compensation).
@saywhat95 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Has anything I've said indicated that I don't care about other people? I care deeply about other people, but I can't sanction something tantamount to slavery as a just solution. It's easy to say "Take the money from the greedy businessmen!" It's hard to stand on a principle.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I'm actually in favor of privatizing these things as well. Private management and competition always produces higher quality products that benefit more people in the long run.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz If a good person I knew fell on hard times, I wouldn't hesitate to contribute to help them. There's nothing wrong with wanting everyone to contribute to help others. But it is wrong to take the money from their pockets or threaten them with fines or imprisonment if they don't.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And that's where private charities are a possible alternative to government intervention. They provide a means to help people without coercing money from anyone. This issue is obviously so important to so many people and I'm sure uninsured rates would go down.
@Spooneyluv22 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz And whether or not people like it, there is nothing illegal about being greedy. We can't let the government control our personalities. That's what authoritarians like @realDonaldTrump want.  Everyone is free to be a good or bad person and we are free to judge them accordingly.
@Spooneyluv22 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I said it was a form of slavery if they don't have a choice in who receive the benefit of their work. Slaves are forced to serve someone against their will. I think the people who own businesses should have the same freedoms as anyone else in deciding who they work for.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I'm sorry to hear of your difficult circumstances, but I just can't get behind the idea that someone's personal misfortunes give them a right to force someone to do something for them against their will. Even a majority vote can't take away someone's freedom.
@krinklyfig @ntlsheresisted @thefaycat @brianschatz How did you know that’s my favorite Abraham Lincoln quote?
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Everyone except slaves have a choice in who they work for. And why did you become so hostile suddenly? It really was a good discussion up until now and I don’t understand why you turned to name calling and personal attacks?
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Who are people like you and who is killing you off? I’m 100% cool with you being free to choose whether or not you want to buy a product from someone and 100%  cool with them being free to choose if they want to sell a product to you or not.
@SallyforPeace @brianschatz Well, then wouldn’t providing slaves with food and housing be considered a form of compensation.?The horror of slavery isn’t only that slaves weren’t compensated, but that they didn’t have a choice in who they worked for and the products of their labor were taken away from them.
@Spooneyluv22 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz I’m sorry if my posts are difficult to understand. Are there any parts in particular that you would like me to explain? This issue is very complex and I want to explain my views in a way that is accessible to everyone.
@SallyforPeace @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz More customers+high satisfaction(quality products/integrity/honesty)+low costs=high profits. This is the formula for success in a truly free market, where the gov’t doesn’t control business and therefore businesses have no interest in controlling gov’t (no cronyism).
@SallyforPeace @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz If the government didn’t have so many regulations and restrictions on insurance companies there would be new innovation (as we see in unregulated industries like tech). A diverse population needs access to diverse solutions. Not a one size fits all gov’t program.
@SallyforPeace @brianschatz And if an insurance company breaks their contract, customers have every right to sue them. For being such a vilified and mistrusted industry, people still seem willing to purchase insurance without taking the time to know what is covered in their plan and what isn’t.
@SallyforPeace @brianschatz I sincerely wish that everyone were able to have health insurance, but I value individual freedom above anything else. People are free to be good or bad and we are free to judge them for their actions, but we can’t make something illegal just because we think it’s mean.
@ntlsheresisted @thefaycat @brianschatz Aw, that’s disappointing! And just when I posted saying how civil and focused you kept the debate! This just makes me think you ran out of arguments.
@SallyforPeace @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz The only way to provide insurance without stealing is through private charity which I am all for!
@SallyforPeace @thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz How can a contractual agreement freely signed by a consenting adult be a license to steal? Do you think the government should be able to force people to give money (the definition of stealing) to pay for another’s insurance?
@Spooneyluv22 @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz What a though provoking addition to what has so far been a civil discussion of a very difficult debate. You are sure to change minds!
@thefaycat @ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Profits are the fundamental purpose of businesses and are the only was they can continue to function. The company that provides the most value to the most people at the lowest cost earns the most profit. Perfect incentive to provide quality affordable insurance.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Which would be the case if the government dropped its patriarchal insistence that it knows what’s best for us and gives insurance companies the freedom to provide packages that reflect the amazing diversity of Americans and not the whims of some gov’t bureaucrat.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Should the government come after you for not helping every uninsured person who asks you for help? Why should it come after any private business?
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz There is a big difference between actively hurting someone and not helping someone. The government is tasked with punishing criminals who damage the life, liberty, and property of others, not with enslaving some people to others with difficult or unfortunate circumstances.
@AmyPeikoff Can’t wait to listen! I wish I could be at #OCON2018 in person!
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Feel free to condemn or boycott any company whose practices you disagree with. Campaign against them, but the government isn’t a weapon to point at someone whose actions we think are mean or unfair.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz The principle‘s same. As you implied before, extortion is wrong, whether it be that of producers or consumers. We are guaranteed the right to freedom of association, which means businesses can decide to do or not do business with anyone as they see fit for good or bad reasons.
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz Every business, including insurance companies, must do complex calculations to determine how to set prices in order to maximize profits. Also, extortion is “obtaining something through threat or force,” so actually forcing insurance company’s to cover someone is extortion...
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz If someone walks into an expensive restaurant and says “I will die if I don’t eat, but your food is too expensive!” should the government step in and force them to provide them with meals?
@ntlsheresisted @brianschatz The job of any business is to create a mutually beneficial relationship in which both the customer and the service provider end up better off. Is it every business' job to ensure that it's products or services are available to every person?
@brianschatz Hmm... Making private companies or individuals provide services to people against their will sounds a lot like slavery to me...
“「我們仍然不知道上面為什麼做出某些決策，」他說。「它們可能是經過深思熟慮的，但如果我們不明白為什麼，就有可能被誤導。」” 這樣的想法太可怕了！沒有人絕對正確。因此，我們必須不停的懷疑所有實施的政策，畢竟沒有甚麼是無可非議的。

@patrick_mendis SCOTUS isn't forcing unions to do anything. It just saying it is not legal for them to coerce payments from people. If someone washes my car without asking and then demands payment, I can benefit from their action without owing them anything.
individuals to buy health insurance, or business owners to serve or not serve as they see fit (also liberty). And while almost everyone would agree that an individual's property can't be seized by majority vote, most don't see that this is the definition of taxation.
Life, Liberty, and Property are rights which are inalienable (protected even against a majority vote). Most people would agree that the majority can't vote an innocent to death (life) or into prison (liberty). But fewer will agree that we can't vote to force doctors to serve, or

You can't force people to buy your insurance or invest in your company even if you are sure they will benefit from it. You have to persuade them. So why can you force someone to join or fund your union against their will?
If unions really were a panacea to laborer woes and were worth the cost to members then they shouldn't need to force anyone to join or pay "fair share fees." If they bring more benefit than they cost then workers will join willingly.
So unions force people who actively choose not to join them to cough up cash that in turn is used to support candidates which will help grow the power of unions, which then force people who actively choose not to join them to cough up cash... #viciouscycle

Rand's "What is Capitalism?" planted the seeds for several interesting lines of inquiry that I would like to dig into deeper. I am currently looking into ways to share my thoughts, reactions, and development in more detail. #RandRead #CUI
From Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged." This is giving me chills! People just don't seem to understand how positive her views were of humans and their potential.
“the man who produces an idea in any field of rational endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanent benefactor of humanity...It is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or loss"
“Every man is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree to which he thinks that determines the degree to which he’ll rise.”	-Ayn Rand. “Atlas Shrugged” #RandRead
“...misfortune is not a claim to slave labor; there is no such thing as the right to consume, control, and destroy those without whom one would be unable to survive.”	-Ayn Rand. “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.” #RandRead #CUI
Values are not determined or protected by fiat or majority vote. They are determined by rational individuals and protected against fiat and majority vote. #RandRead #CUI
“Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’s judgment, demanding that he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent.”
“...an attempt to achieve the good by physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates morality at its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize the good...”	-Ayn Rand. “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.” #RandRead #CUI
There is no gray area between morality and amorality, and any mixture of the two must be considered amoral. Since Capitalism is the only moral system, any degree of dilution/mixing produces an amoral system. #RandRead #CUI
“The moral justification of capitalism lies in the fact that it is the only system consonant with man’s rational nature, that it protects man’s survival qua man, and that its ruling principle is: justice.”	-Ayn Rand. “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.” #RandRead #CUI
The Four Keystones of Capitalism	Metaphysically: The requirements of man's nature and survival	Epistemologically: Reason	Ethically: Individual Rights	Politically: Freedom	#AynRand #RandRead #CUI #Objectivism
The more sound the philosophy on which the foundations of a society rest, the smaller the role chance, accident, and tradition play in the lives of the individuals living there. #RandRead #CUI
“The right to agree with others is not a problem in any society; it is the right to disagree that is crucial. It is the institution of private property that protects and implements the right to disagree”	-Ayn Rand. “Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.” #Randread #CUI
“In a capitalist society, all human relationships are voluntary.” -Ayn Rand #RandRead #CUI
And the wildest part of it all is that the only way to not be a slave is to not work, and yet to not work one must rely on the work of others. Therefore those who chose to work are necessarily slaves and those who choose not to work are necessarily their masters! #RandRead #CUI
You may say "But the government uses taxes to provide education and infrastructure and protection which make the work possible in the first place!" And a southern slave owner may say "But I provide food and clothing and shelter so that my slaves' work is possible."
Letting a slave choose the task that they must perform to provide you with value to steal does not cancel out the fact that you lay claim to the products of their labor, their livelihood (well-named as it is the means to their life).
And we are certainly coerced into paying taxes. Pay or be fined (have more of your labor claimed). Pay or be imprisoned (our very liberty is at stake). Under such a system tax payers are at best indentured servants paying an endless debt and at worst slaves.
Given this fact, forcing someone to give money—whether by government-condemned theft or by government-initiated theft (taxes)—is therefore equivalent to forcing someone to provide work (remembering money=value=work).
Money, by definition, is a convenient, common, transferable representation of the value of work and it's products. In other words, money is a one-to-one representation of value that has been produced.
If any part of a man (his mind, life, work, or it's products) is considered the property of the tribe/state, then he is truly a slave. #RandRead #CUI
"Every man is an end in himself." #RandRead #CUI
“The social recognition of man’s rational nature—of the connection between his survival and his use of reason—is the concept of individual rights.” #RandRead #CUI
There is nothing instinctual in man's survival. It depends solely on his use of rationality. And rationality can only be practiced by individuals, not by any group. #RandRead #CUI
A man may choose to live without thinking by imitating and repeating a routine of work discovered by others, but that routine still had to be discovered. Without these thinkers, none would be able to survive. #RandRead #CUI
It is the responsibility of individuals to determine what behavior is right and wrong, and to judge the behavior of others, but these evaluations must never be made by a government holding a gun. Coercive morality is immoral. #RandRead
Laws are not tools to make people act a certain way. Their sole purpose is to protect individuals and their property from physical and coercive force. The government must not be in the business of legislating decency. Protect life, liberty and property, not feelings. #RandRead
How DARE you tell me the right way for me to act and what's best for me‽ That's paternalism! Now don't you know that THIS is the way to act? This is actually what's best for you! Let's legislate! #hypocrites #RandRead #CUI
Europe never got over the concept of man being  a slave to the power. They only managed to replace the King they serve with "the people". Slavery to the chief or slavery to the tribe? Why not try eliminating slavery altogether? #RandRead #CUI
#CUI=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal
Central economic planning is a remnant of feudal thinking in which everyone is a small piece of a greater whole directed by a benevolent elite. #RandRead #CUI
The issue of Capitalism is not one of practicality but of morality. It is not a means to be justified by its ends, but is rather the only means morally justifiable. #RandRead #CUI
Henceforth known as the #RandRead
Starting this #RandRead with Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. First essay is "What is Capitalism" by the lady herself. #AynRand
So I've set a goal to read though as many of #AynRand's essays as I can and to write the thoughts which they inspire.
So amazing to see that Ayn Rand's ideas are finally being taken seriously by some of today's leading intellectuals! This will expose so many new people to her ideas! If only I were in the US right now! 😭 https://t.co/FpdTtN4Xlm
