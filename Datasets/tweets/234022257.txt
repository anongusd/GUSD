Congressional oversight is important. There are several provisions in this that ensure there‚Äôs no executive overreach, including: 3-year sunset provision, require consultation w/ Congress 45 days prior to actions, publishing proposed actions for Public Comment.
The goal of this legislation is not to raise tariffs for their own sake. On the contrary, if @POTUS has the tools needed to bring other nations to the negotiating table, they will lower their tariffs on American goods.
Regarding the Reciprocal Trade Act, @WSJ ed board is wrong on this one. We‚Äôve been losing a trade war for decades, and our workers, farmers, and manufacturers are hurting. It's time to level the playing field on trade. We cannot sit back and continue to be the world's piggy bank.

Preparing inmates to return to our society in meaningful jobs is in the best interest of all Wisconsinites, but shortening the sentences for criminals with major and repeat criminal convictions makes our communities less safe. (6/6)
Let‚Äôs not forget, these are not merely victimless crimes. Meth and heroin dealers sell poison that break families, spurs additional crimes, and can lead to injury or death. (5/6)
Senate Democrats decided that bipartisan reform wasn‚Äôt enough to gain their support and demanded that Congress shorten the time served for major criminal offenders before they‚Äôve even spent a day reforming their lifestyle or serving their sentence.  (4/6)
However, I cannot support this legislation because it fails to address concerns raised by our law enforcement and by Wisconsin families.  (3/6)
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve supported legislation to make sure that, with good behavior, nonviolent, low-risk offenders can be released from prison and rejoin society.  (2/6)
As a former prosecutor, I took the different arguments about the First Step Act very seriously, and there‚Äôs widespread agreement on both sides of the aisle that we need to reform the way prisoners serve their sentence. (1/6)
Extremely disappointing that some of my retiring/defeated colleagues have skipped out on work when we need votes to fund the wall. You still represent your constituents. Come back to work!
