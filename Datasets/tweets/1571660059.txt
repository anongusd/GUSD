@RMahre I stopped paying attention to Gravis in September. If we can send Gravis, Emerson, Quinnipiac and Rasmussen into the bin of irrelevancy, we'd be better off without their cruddy polling.
@mat02180 They aren't, also don't play that card if you believed the Kavanaugh allegations.
@mat02180 1. He was clearly a businessman.	2. Honestly haven't heard about that one.	3. Apparently there was some sort of weird arrangement he had with his wife, which is their business.
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 Well on the bright side Virginia somehow sent "a message" to Trump. Who knows what that "message" to Trump was, not that he was ever gonna listen to it.
@mat02180 Yes I did. Similar to Kavanuagh, those allegations weren't proven.
As I said: they make Rasmussen seem like A+ pollster. https://t.co/tBLQAanJzr
@BautistaBomb @ActorAaronBooth Gravis is so bad it makes Rasmussen's number seem believable.
It still baffles to me to this day that candidates still go to Partisan Hack @ActorAaronBooth and Gravis Marketing. Lousy polling, horrible track record, and quite frankly, sub-par analytical skills.
The internet is a wonderful thing. I donated to them. https://t.co/K3m7BVLE2P

@IAmKrishanPatel @PopulismUpdates But considering your party is literally digging into your vastly depleted state legislatures to run presidential candidates now, I‚Äôm sure you can find someone whose competent and in sync with the American people, burden to do that is on you guys.

@aseemru McSally would win that race
@HelloJames8 Which is funny enough considering Sinema isn‚Äôt a moderate, nor will she really be, but it‚Äôs the McSally campaign‚Äôs fault for failing to effectively do so. As I said later on, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs another candidate that can replicate Sinema.
I don‚Äôt think Dems have anyone else who could match Sinema‚Äôs appeal and skill as a candidate. Gallego is far too liberal for the state, and Woods‚Äôs recent party flop might kill his chances at cross over appeal, but then again ‚Äúcountry over party conservatives‚Äù will vote for any D
But on the other hand...		-Sinema was probably the best candidate Dems had to offer, she ran a great campaign and it was a great year for Dems. She was the perfect candidate in a perfect year and it paid its dividends.
-She also did run a little too closely to Trump (muh MAGA), so that probably didn‚Äôt help things, and considering Trump only narrowly carried this purpling State, i dont exactly see how she can pull off the balancing act when she failed to do so.
-There were plenty of ‚Äúcountry over party conservatives‚Äù who cucked out and betrayed her and voted for Sinema. I don‚Äôt exactly see how she can immediately win them back considering their tendency rn is to destroy the GOP.
As I‚Äôve mentioned before, I‚Äôm NOT in favor of McSally‚Äôs appointment in #AZSEN. 		-While she should‚Äôve won on Election *cough* Maricopa mail in ballots *cough* kind of sketchy if you ask me *cough*, she didn‚Äôt. She managed to blow a seat that we held for 30 years.
@jacobfhsmith @GrantWoods Possible, but again, considering Woods completely betrayed the party, it may motivate Republicans to vote against him, but on the other hand, lots of ‚Äúcountry over party conservatives‚Äù voted for Sinema over McSally. I think Sinema was probably the best Dems had to offer in AZ.

@Greedonerd @trafalgar_group Traflgar had a banner year, they nailed pretty much every race. Idk what you're getting at.
This is what @ActorAaronBooth can't defend.

@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra I cited the work put out by Gravis that showed them laughably wrong. You can't or won't defend it because you know Silver shouldn't have ranked you guys that high. Gravis is a C- rated pollster on it's best day.
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra Those were statics put out by Gravis, Aaron. I know you don't want to defend it because you have a hard time looking in the mirror to defend it, but try not to be so condescending...
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra Well congrats, you own it. Please run from defending it as it shows how much you can't defend your firm's track garbage record and you're only hiding behind a little ranking system made by a mediocre political forecaster.
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra So you stand by your firm having Nelson up 4 points? You stand by your firm's work for AP showing Grietens having a 55% approval rating in the middle of his scandal? You stand by your firm's work having Nehlen within striking distance of Ryan? You're living in an alt. reality...
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra It's research that was put out by your firm, Aaron. Own up to it since you're calling Gravis the best pollster in the world essentially. Also, I could care less what Nate Silver predicts, he's had a rough couple cycles...

@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra Also, can;t forget this doozy: https://t.co/PTBrOfYbxe 		How did you have Greitens at 55/39 right in the middle of his scandal?
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra -FL GOV, You had Gillum up 5, lost less than 1%	-In SEN, You had Donnelly up 4, he lost by 6	-Your Sep 16 Poll for NV GOV had Sisolak up 12! (He won by 4)	-A few of your last AZ Sen polls had McSally ahead by a few points even
@ActorAaronBooth @AGBecerra "Accurate Polls" 		Ok Aaron, let's look at some of them (for this year)		(Final Polls) 	-OH GOV, You had Cordray up 5, DeWine won by about 4 	-MI SEN, You had Stabenow up 13, she won by 7	-MT-AL, You had it tied, Ginaforte won by 5	-FL-SEN, You had Nelson up 4, lost less than 1%.

@bdquinn @SenhorRaposa @RRHElections @ABQJournal @Redistrict You don‚Äôt have any principles, you want everyone to use these ludicrous election systems just so your side of the aisle can get more seats because you guys seem to struggle to win one round elections when it‚Äôs one on one
@bdquinn @SenhorRaposa @RRHElections @ABQJournal @Redistrict Even if the Republican would have won, it still would‚Äôve been a rigged and unfair system had the Democrat finished ahead of him.
@bdquinn @SenhorRaposa @RRHElections @ABQJournal @Redistrict No, it doesn‚Äôt.
@bdquinn @SenhorRaposa @RRHElections @ABQJournal @Redistrict Again, your argument is essentially built on the premise that just because one system works here, means that it can and should be replicated everywhere. No it shouldn‚Äôt. Again it‚Äôs not hard to determine the will of the voters in a one round election idk why you struggle with this

@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa Considering the Dem bench now is essentially just Kander (when he recovers) and Galloway, Dems don't have too many people left that they can turn to. Missouri is truly a Republican state now.
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa Ohhhhhhhhhh big time
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa From my observations, Hawley really isn't all that Trumpy, he really is your run of the mill typical establishment Republicans (which I love), though he will be an ally of Trump's considering how much he helped Hawley.
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa Yeah, she got called out by a very prominent state senator (I can't remember her name rn, but ik that she's insanely radical)
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa Kander's overpreformance as pretty much a fluke, and was a combination of his own personal skill and likeability and Blunt's general laziness (he woke up just in time though), and was helped by Trump carrying the state by 20.
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa 3. Her vote against Kavanaugh tarnished the image she was trying to project as a centrist. People forget that Missouri is an increasingly conservative state, and any perception that you're going along with the liberal elite in DC, will cost you big time here.
@paolo_lim @EButcher55 @SenhorRaposa McCaskill had a few problems:		1. Luck. Eventually you just run out of it.	2. Hawley (while he had a slow start), actually proved to be a skilled opponent. It was clear that he wasn't going to be an Aiken and once he got in gear, ran a very effective campaign.

@RMahre There's no electoral college for congressional districts (Thank God)
@bdquinn I'll give you an example of voter intent: I like Candidate A. I'm going to vote for Candidate A.  Candidate A gets the most votes, and should win. What's so hard to understand about that? Voter intent is pretty easy to determine.
@RMahre I've never criticized the Electoral College, and anyone who wants to abolish the electoral college -Democrat or Republican- don't understand Democracy and basic democratic principles. But comparing RCV to the EC is ludicrous, there's nothing remotely the same about them.
@bdquinn The intent of any election is elect one person. One vote, one person, it ain't complicated. You can arrive at that conclusion with one election, there's no excuse to drag it out.
@SenhorRaposa @EButcher55 I believe Monica Lewiskini. As for the other accusers, I never really reviewed their accusations against Bill Clinton.
@SenhorRaposa @EButcher55 You constantly insist Brett Kavanaugh assaulted Dr. Ford, without evidence.
@bdquinn Runoffs are literally a waste of time, money and energy for everyone involved. Yes, runoffs are simple compared to RCV's, but its just another unnecessary election. Again, I don't see why people can't just make one single choice and be done with it, it's not that hard.
@SenhorRaposa @EButcher55 After that little convenient Macriopa County ballot dump, as for the other states, Republicans were never gonna win there.
@bdquinn Runoffs are different from RCV's (and I'm not a fan of runoffs either mind you). I firmly believe that if you receive the most votes, you win. I don't see what's wrong with that. Why add in all these ridiculous algorithms and extra rounds?
@bdquinn No... there literally isn't.....

@Stizmaster @CATargetBot The election was 3 weeks ago, and they're still counting votes. At this rate they'll finally be done counting by the time 2020 rolls around. Even Broward County seems competent by comparison. It's not fair to the candidates, the people in those districts and to democracy

Also, the fact that so many democrats won solely on the promise of single payer healthcare, a complete government takeover of the healthcare industry, is a dissatisfying and disappointing result.
Flake might have won had Trump not gone on an obsessive triad against him for a year on end. Also, I really fault a lot of these ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù republicans who claim themselves to be conservatives who bought in to that garbage that Sinema was a centrist. Give me a break.
