Post-ACA Medicaid's clearly inequitable two-tiered system—“red” vs “blue” state—would seem an absurd injustice to any fair-minded analyst.
As states expanded Medicaid more or less generously, many not at all, another multi-tiered system is being created. #MedicaidExpansion #ACA

Ensure that newly insured, public &amp; private, are adequately insured, without exorbitant out-of-pocket costs for medically necessary care.
The relatively more protective effects of Canadian health care have suggested ways to maximize the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) protections.
