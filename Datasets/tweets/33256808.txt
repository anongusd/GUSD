The Democrats cannot nominate a #Socialist to face Trump in 2020.  Their problem is, how do they throw Bernie under the bus AGAIN and hold their base together?
Trump now enjoys 93% support of the GOP base - a record rivaled only by George Bush right after 9/11.  Meanwhile, only 18% of voters say they support the Democrat's #Socialism.
Democrats won the House in 2018 because Trump wasn't on the ticket in red distracts and #NeverTrump'ers were.
The amusing thing is that the fact Democrats cannot accept Trump just beat them in 2016 will cause them to lose even bigger in 2020.
Schiff and Nadler keep claiming there is evidence of Trump's collusion with Russia EVERYWHERE.  If that's true, why hasn't the Special Prosecutor designated to find it found it?
Happy Monday! https://t.co/PlegJd7aAX
Tax reform is working.. https://t.co/jMqBfBdOks
If Democrats don't throw these crazy socialists under the bus soon, they could be looking at an electoral wipeout in 2020 that rivals Reagan's 1984 re-election.
In poll after poll, Independents are shifting support to President Trump and his #MAGA agenda as the Democrats lurch impossibly left.
Democrats know they cannot defeat President Trump in 2020 so they are seeking to disqualify him now.  Sadly for them, they are only disqualifying themselves with the American people.
With every new day we have Democrats saying some new thing that is even crazier than the previous day.  By 2020, they will be in full-fledged meltdown!
President Trump's CPAC speech was amazing.  He spoke to the heart of the American people about exceptionalism and patriotism and the Democrats said he sounded like Hitler!
This crazy person @AOC is the gift that keeps on giving.  Even people on the Left are saying she is nuts!
70% of voters in a recent poll say they want the #RussiaGate investigations to end with the Mueller Report, and yet the Democrats are doubling down on more investigations than ever.  It's insane.
The Democrat Congress has lost their minds with these open-ended fishing expeditions against Trump.  There is no crime,  just a hope they can catch someone in a process crime with all these subpoenas.
At a time when Russia and China are pouring money into their military budgets to upgrade, expand and modernize, Bernie Sanders wants to slash our defense budget and jeopardize our freedom?
Bernie Sanders began his 2020 Campaign by saying he will dramatically slash the Pentagon budget to pay for social programs. Lol, I honestly believe Democrats are trying to lose.
CPAC is now officially TPAC ‚ÄúTrump PAC‚Äù

Oh, and in case everyone missed it do to a lack of reporting, the economy is in FANTASTIC SHAPE!
Joe Biden has so many issues as a candidate, hard to imagine him running, but with this crazy field of Democrats, you never know!
It really is inexplicable that the Democrat Party is lurching so far left during the campaign for the White House. They used to always run to the middle then govern to the left.
The more the media makes a darling out of @AOC, the harder it will be for the DNC to eventually throw her and her crazy ideas under the bus.  America will never elect a Socialist.

If the Feds had not raised interest rates so many times putting the brakes on the economy, 2018 GDP would have been far higher that 2.9%!
Several recent polls demonstrate that Independents are surging back to Trump after voting Democrat in 2018.  The crazy #GreenNewDeal is helping.
So now the House, the Senate and Cohen have all exonerated Trump of colluding with Russia, and yet, @AdamSchiff insists there is obvious evidence everywhere of collusion.
Republican leaders have submitted Cohen for perjury charges after lying under oath yesterday about seeking an office in the White House.  Man, this guy can't stop stepping in it!
https://t.co/CSFTIlrryn
Saying the Cohen testimony backfired on the Democrats would be the understatement of the century.  Cohen cleared Trump of Russian collusion, Wikileaks collusion and campaign finance violations.
Cohen was not convicted of Campaign Finance Violations by a jury or a judge.  He plead to them in exchange for a lighter sentence.  He never would have been convicted in court.
Cohen takeaway - No Russian Collusion - but then again, we've known that since the start.
If Trump was colluding with Putin, why would he risk everything on a high profile Trump Tower meeting with someone who ultimately had no useful information?
Is there any indication that President Trump or his family are richer today because he is President than they would have been had he not run?
Cohen's biggest mistake was leading off with the idea that Trump never wanted to win the White House, only improve his brand.  How would losing on the world stage improve his brand?
Bernie, Bloomberg and Biden are all running for President in 2020. 		I thought Democrats were the party against a government full of old white men? 		What a joke!

Both eyewitnesses named by Trump accuser, Alva Johnson, claim the alleged "kiss" never happened.  Oops.
Trey Gowdy mocked Adam Schiff on Sunday for spreading the narrative in recent weeks that there is "evidence in plain sight" of collusion between President Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.
ANOTHER HOAX - The woman, Alva Johnson, who is claiming President Trump tried to kiss her in 2016 at an event, has since attended an Inaugural Ball and applied for 2 jobs within the Trump Admin!
A super majority of American voters are now saying that, should Mueller exonerate Trump, they do NOT want any more #Russiagate investigations; however, Democrats are planning on just that!
The most remarkable thing about the entirly bogus #Russiagate Investigation is that it was determined from the very start that Russian interference did NOT affect the outcome of the election!
If President Trump was colluding with Putin to defeat Hillary, would he risk everything on a Trump Tower meeting to do oppo research?  Why not just call Vladimir and ask?
If #RussianCollusion were powerful enough to have defeated the $1.2 billion Hillary Campaign which featured 24/7 #Media collusion with her campaign, shouldn't it have been easier to find?
One can debate whether or not losing the House for 2 years was good or bad for the Republican Party, but one thing is without question, the ensuing #Socialist clown show has been great for Trump in 2020!
Despite the House, the Senate, and by all indications, in short order the Mueller investigation declaring Trump innocent of #RussianCollusion, leading Democrats claim the evidence is "obvious."
Without evidence, House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) has said President Donald Trump was the ¬ìgreatest threat¬î to American democracy since the Civil War.  Incredible.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just said humans should stop having kids in order to save the planet. 		How about just people who believe in the idiotic things she does stop reproducing? 		Who agrees with me? üëãüèº

National polls show that while the Democrat Party lurches left, voters are moving right with only 6 states now being majority Liberal!
Between the Smollett and Covington #FakeHate scandals, the Democrats entire hate meme for 2020 is in real trouble.
President Trump is a remarkably patient man.  This comes from trusting his own instincts completely.  In his mind, he knows how this movie ends.
The great benefit of being a patient, strategic thinker is that you can lay traps for your linear-thinking opponentS well in advance so they never see it coming.  Trump does this constantly.
President Trump must get tremendous pleasure from making the pundits and experts look foolish as he proves them wrong over and over again.
President Trump is the first US President to stand up to China on trade and we are very close to getting a major trade deal, despite the pundits saying this would never be possible!
The current round of U.S.-China trade talks began Thursday and have made so much progress that the Chinese delegation has extended their trip for meetings to continue through the weekend.
President Donald Trump met with Special Envoy for President Xi Jinping Friday, promoting great promise for a trade deal and openness to extending the tariff truce deadline.
Kamala Harris wants to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.		Shouldn't she have more important issues to worry about? 		Like all the unsanitary streets in California littered with needles &amp; feces.
Is Joe Biden really travelling the globe telling our allies that America is, "an embarrassment?"  He is basically disqualifying himself from the 2020 race.
First the Covington Case and now the Smollett Case.  It seems the Democrats have a chronic case of #FAKE on their hands.
With Trump's approval ratings at near all-time highs and his support within the GOP at 93%, it would appear the 2 year Mueller witch-hunt has been ineffective.
More and more "insiders" are coming forward saying they expect the Mueller Report to be "anti-climactic."  Or in other words, a complete waste of time and money.
The #Media can't wait to forget about this whole Jussie Smollett #FakeHate crime story.  I expect it to disappear from the headlines as soon as they can make it go away.
2016 Jussie: Trump is gonna be indicted.	2017 Jussie: Trump is gonna be indicted.	2018 Jussie: Trump is gonna be indicted.	2019 Jussie: I got indicted.

What crazy person is upset that the government did not over-withhold from them during the year?
Average Americans are saving over $1200 a year in taxes over their bill before tax reform.  Impressive!
Why would a taxpayer want too much withheld from their paychecks just so they could have a bigger refund?  It is like a forced savings account with no interest?
Article after article screams the headlines, "US Taxpayers shocked by smaller refunds, feel betrayed by Trump!"  But when you read the article, you see that these people are actually paying LESS taxes!
2020 will be a game of, "Who can be the craziest Socialist?" for the Democrats.  This should be good.
Well, good ole Bernie is in.  Remember when he used to be the ONLY Socialist on the ballot?  Now he is to the right of the nutty crew running this time around.
On the one hand Democrats do everything they can to prevent border security while at the same time insisting they support border security.
There is far far far more legal standing for President Trump to declare a national emergency at the border than there ever was for Obama to declare #DACA and Democrats didn't complain about that.
This baseless lawsuit by 16 blue states to block the national emergency declaration seeks to prove there "is no emergency." President Trump is NOT required by the NEA to prove that there is an emergency.
The new lawsuit filed by 16 blue states seeking to block President Trump's national emergency declaration completely ignore the existence of settled law, the National Emergencies Act.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the far left rep from New York, played a major role in sinking the Amazon deal in New York which would have brought tens of thousands of high paying jobs to the state.
Speaker Pelosi just wished everyone a Happy Thanksgiving in February.  No wonder she thinks George Bush is still President!
Looks like Bernie Sanders is in for 2020, but instead of being the only crazy Socialist, half of the field are even further left than he is.  Fun times!
At some point, the DNC will have to throw these far left loonies under the bus and move back to the middle with an electable candidate, and when they do, oh boy what a mess!
The Democrats far far far left lurch is leaving Independent voters in the rear-view mirror.  Over 80% of Independent viewers approved of President Trump's #SOTU speech.
Every time I hear a Democrat speak, it feels like they are talking to non-citizens, not citizens.  Anyone else?  Why would they do that unless they expect non-citizens to vote?

If there was enough collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia to actually change the outcome of an entire Presidential Election, shouldn't it have been easier to find?
The House and the Senate have now declared after exhaustive studies that there was NO COLLUSION between Russia and the Trump Campaign, yet the Democrat House wants to start investigating all over again!
The Democrats leftward lurch is almost confusing.  What are they trying to achieve?  They have to know America will NEVER be a #Socialist country and the #GreenNewDeal is a laughingstock!

The Democrats plan to tax the wealthy at 70% is insane!  The Treasury will actually earn less revenue as the wealthy will stop investing in America and move resources off-shore.

I have no idea how the Democrats are going to pivot back to the middle for 2020.  America will never elect a far left #Socialist to run the country.
Supply-side economics works and has always worked.  Democrats claim it doesn't.  Global Warming Models from 30 years ago have all proven false, yet Democrats say trust their models now.

It's funny to watch the #Media and other Democrats hailing Ocasio-Cortez as the new leader of their Party.  She says some really crazy stuff.
Hollywood hates Trump.  It's odd really since Trump has never done anything to harm Hollywood.
President Trump was the peacemaker last night.  The President for everyone.  Based upon polling, this seems to have been the right way to go.
So let's see, the Democrat agenda seems to be raising taxes, open borders and infanticide.  And their candidates are jockeying to see who can be the most extreme on each.
Because of their rabid leftist base, Democrats cannot walk away from their "anything goes" abortion policy.  This will cost them as well it should.
Late-term abortion is going to be a major problem for Democrats as we head into 2020.  This is a repugnant practice that a vast majority of Americas disapprove of.
Last night's post-SOTU polling made even more glaring the odd difference between support for Democrats vs. their policies.  Votes HATE their policies, yet just gave them control of Congress.
In a shocking turn of events, 72% of post-SOTU voters said they agree with President Trump's position on Immigration enforcement.  Makes one wonder how Dems took Congress?
President Trump's message last night was designed to appeal to Independents, a group he must win for 2020.  In flash polls taken after the speech, Trump received support from 82% of them!
Watching the Democrats reaction to President Trump's SOTU speech last night, I don't think unity or American greatness are something they are interested in.
Last night, President Trump made it clear he wants all of us to be united and work together to solve America‚Äôs problems. 		Nancy and Chuck do not want that because they are scared to death the wall will work! 		#KeepAmericaGreat #BuildTheWall

Assuming America has not completely lost its mind, President Trump should win re-election easily in 2020 on results alone.
America would never accept a 70% top marginal tax rate.  The economy would implode as investment evaporated.
Between Ocasio-Cortez and Kamala Harris, it's a race to see who can go the furthest Left and say the craziest things with a straight face.

Democrats are actually suggesting marginal tax rates of 90%!  That is insane and would cash the economy.
Like 2016, the radical #Socialist base of the Democrats Party will not take kindly to the DNC marginalizing their favorite "rockstar" candidates.
The DNC cannot win the White House with any of these far left #Socialist candidates.  How will they push them aside this time?

Will President Trump announce a National Emergency to build the wall during the SOTU address with Pelosi sitting behind him?  That would be dramatic to say the least!
This New York late term abortion law followed up by the VA attempt to allow abortion up through the moment if dilation is showing just how extreme the Democrats have become.

After the experts predicted gloom and doom for stocks throughout December, we have just experienced the best January rally in history!
Over 300,000 jobs created in a frigid January during the middle of the government shutdown.  Incredible!  That is twice the expected amount!
If President Trump issues a National Emergency declaration during his SOTU address, will the Democrats boo our national sovereignty after Trump has just spent an hour making the case?
President Trump is openly hinting that he may declare a National Emergency to build the wall during his SOTU address.  That would be a thing of beauty to watch Nancy Pelosi's reaction!
Late term abortion is disgusting and the Democrats are disgusting for supporting it.
President Trump has tried over and over again to help Dreamers find a way to stay in America and earn citizenship, but the Democrats have refused every offer demanding full and immediate amnesty.
Sorry Dreamers, Nancy Pelosi could have gotten you a deal in exchange for wall funding, but her pride prevented her.  Now Trump will get his wall and you'll get nothing.
President Trump now has a number of options whereby he can fund the wall without Nancy's help.  She could get a deal for her constituents but she won't.  Too much pride.
The Democrats are spinning out of control.  They are now for tax rates exceeding 70%, late term abortion on demand and open borders.  They are committing #Americide!
I keep hearing about how Trump's trade war has hurt the economy, and yet I see manufacturing expanding and inflation in check.  Meanwhile new trade deals with Mexico, Canada and China!
DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST THEIR MINDS! "Bernie Sanders proposed a 77 percent tax on billion-dollar estates Thursday as part of a broader policy to bolster the estate tax to combat inequality."
Democrats are reportedly extremely worried that President Donald Trump¬ís support among Latinos is not falling ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Lindsey Graham just announced that the Trump Admin will build the border wall, "one way or the other."  Yep, its' gonna get done and soon!
President Trump is calling it like it is.  Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, higher taxes and open borders.  This will NOT play well for them in 2020.

It would have been almost impossible for Mueller's Team to do a deep investigation of Russian Collusion without literally tripped over Uranium One and Hillary's payment for the Steele Dossier.
It appears the Mueller Report is almost upon us.  Will it be damning of Donald Trump and Russian Collusion?  Well, considering no other domestic indictment has involved Russian Collusion, I'd guess no.
President Trump's plan to take moderate positions (such as on DACA) that he knew Democrats could not and would not accept, has forced the Democrats so far left, they have gone well beyond just Liberal to Socialist.
Kamala is the new rockstar of the left.  She is going to pull the Democrat field so far left, it will be impossible for them to triangulate back to the middle for the General Election.
Nancy Pelosi will fly to Afghanistan but refuses to fly down to our southern border. 		Does anyone need anymore proof that she puts the American people last?!

The RNC has just stated that they are 100% behind the re-election of President Trump in 2020!
President Trump's approval among Republicans is the highest it has ever been!
I am frankly amused when I read the Leftist Media pretending they have any idea how the Trump Base thinks.
After two years of seemingly endless Mueller Investigations which have netted ZERO evidence of Trump collusion with Russia, does the new Democrat House actually believe we want MORE of that?
To hear Adam Schiff talk, you'd think he was the Head of the FBI.  This man's hubris knows no end.
Does the new Democrat Majority in the House plan on ever actually DOING anything for AMERICANS?
President Trump's ability to fulfill campaign promises at such a  high level despite almost 100% opposition and lies from the #Media is nothing short of miraculous.
The USA economy remains strong while the rest of the world begins to struggle.  That's because they are no longer taking advantage of us on trade!
President Trump is spending his retirement by working for nothing just to rebuild our country‚Äôs prosperity.		Meanwhile, Democrats do nothing but spend our money to secure their own retirement. 		The difference is astounding.
If @SpeakerPelosi were President, does anyone believe we would now be winning the trade war with the world or even fighting back?  Of course not.

It's sad that Democrats do not care Dianne Feinstein had a Chinese spy drive her around for 20 years, but completely obsess over the Russian hoax investigation just because they hate President Trump.
Pelosi will regret her hubris in signing that 3 week CR with 8 pens.
If Republicans had won the House, President Trump could not have declared a National Emergency to fund the wall without undermining his own party.  Pelosi in charge has cleared the way!

Don't look now, but the Pelosi House is about to become irrelevant.
Enjoy your gloating about Nancy being "Negotiator In Chief" while you can Democrats.  In 3 weeks, Trump puts her in the corner.
Due to Pelosi's intransigence on the wall, there is a good chance Trump will fund it on his own and Pelosi's constituents will get NOTHING.
Democrats cannot stop Trump from funding his wall.  They can only hope to negotiate and get something from Trump in exchange.
To hear Hollywood crow about it, you'd think @SpeakerPelosi just won the Super Bowl and not just a 3 week CR that will allows Trump to declare a national emergency and build the wall.
President Trump is a genius. 		Reopen the government for 3 weeks so workers can get paid. Show the world how the Democrats refuse to compromise. Then declare a national emergency and build the wall!
The Democrat 2020 field is beginning to look like a who's who of Socialist nutbags.
Remember when Democrats used to pretend to be moderate?  Those days are long gone.
A new poll says only 7% of voters support Trump on the wall.  This is insanely ridiculous.
Grassroots Republicans are sticking with President Trump as a historic partial shutdown of the federal government continues with no end in sight amid a partisan spat over immigration.
The only reason Obama "created more jobs in his final 20 months than Trump did in his first 20," is that the vast majority of Obama jobs were part-time gig work.  Trump's are full-time career jobs.
President Trump passed Tax reform and ended over 800 Obama Era job-killing regulations, and the #Media will STILL claim this is the Obama economy.
You can read leftwing article after article claiming that the Trump Tax Cuts have been a disaster for America, but you need look only to the economy to see that is a lie.
Despite almost 70% approval on the economy, Trump gets only 44% approval on his handling of it.  Yes, folks, this is insanity.
Despite assurances from practically every financial pundit on the planet that the Trump Trade War would kill jobs, the US job market is sizzling with record low jobless claims.
The number of people seeking jobless benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since November 1969, a sign the job market remains strong despite the partial government shutdown.

The Democrat Party is being pulled so far Left now as to be unrecognizable from the Party of Kennedy.  Their 2020 Presidential field so far is fully and unabashedly socialist.

After the way Kamala Harris treated the Honorable Justice Brett Kavanaugh, I hope Americans are smart enough to never support this woman for president.
The Democrats lies on the wall are so transparent, it amazes me that anyone actually believes them!

Democrats today had a chance to actually DO SOMETHING for frightened #DACA recipients and did NOTHING.
Let me be clear.  By turning down President Trump's new offer to re-open the government, Democrats have now taken FULL OWNERSHIP of the shutdown.
President Trump's speech today was epic.  Thoughtful, serious and made a wonderful offer to #DACA recipients to have a 3 year work permit. The heartless Democrats turned him down cold.

Against all odds, Trump is winning the trade war with China single-handedly when every expert said it was impossible, and THIS is the man Democrats want to impeach?
Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported Friday that China has offered to significantly boost its purchase of U.S. goods over a six-year period in an effort to re-balance trade between the two superpowers.
Chinese officials are open to eliminating an imbalance with the U.S. that has been a source of trade tension between the two largest economies in the world and a major headwind for stocks!
The stock market is off to its best start in 30 years!  Thank you President Trump!
President Trump is standing firm on his demands that Congress fund the wall.  Meanwhile, the Democrat Leadership seeks to jet around the world on the taxpayers dime doing anything but negotiating.

Frightening that the #1 achievement thus far of the new Democrat Majority is a swell tan and good theater tickets.
Supply-side economics works.  Trickle-down economics works.  Democrats, apparently, don't.
Just as supply side economics claims, the loss of revenues from corporate tax cuts was more than made up by the increase in revenues from individual receipts.
Opportunity Zones passed in tax reform are an incredible opportunity for small businesses will to relocate their business to urban areas.
The Democrats and Media will claim to this day that Trump's "tax cuts for the rich" are blowing a billion dollar hole in the deficit.  The actual numbers show that simply is not true.
While corporate tax receipts were down, individual receipts due to increased jobs and wages surged creating a net positive result!.
The results are in and yes, the #TrumpTaxCuts are paying for themselves and more!  Tax revenues surged by $31 billion in 2018 over 2017!

SCHUMER IS SUCH A JERK - "McCarthy said Pelosi refused to acknowledge the border crisis and that Schumer raised his voice while addressing the president."
PATHETIC - "Congressional Republicans confirmed the account after the meeting, noting that Schumer and Pelosi refused to commit to any funding for a wall within 30 days, even if the government was reopened."
President Trump don't play.  He came right out and asked Nancy Pelosi if she was going to fund the wall.  She said no.  He left the meeting.  Baam!  That's how a boss works!

The Democrats are about to have a full blown civil war on their hands.  Ocasio-Cortez's "New Green Deal" is a real problem for Nancy Pelosi.
On the one hand, Nancy Pelosi says she wants bipartisanship.  On the other hand she is saying, "My way or the highway!," on wall funding.  She is a complete hypocrite.
95% of 2016 presidential donations by Federal workers went to Hillary Clinton.  The government remaining closed is hurting the Democrat base far more than the Trump base.  Problem for Nancy.
Declaring illegal immigration a "national emergency" is President Trump's ace-in-the-hole to fund the wall without Congressional Dems approval.
The Defense Budget has about $100 billion in unallocated funds which can be used for various purposes as they are needed.  Legal minds believe President Trump could access these funds to build the wall.
Today President Trump told Chuck Schumer he will keep 1/4 of the government shut down for months or years if he needs to to get his wall funded!
So far there is no indication that Trump's trade war is having ANY negative impact on the job market at all as the economists direly predicted it would.  Amazing.

President Trump's legal team is now accusing Muller of obstruction of justice for deleting the Strzock texts, and so he should.

Illegal immigration is an invasion without planes, bombs or guns.  These people have no intention of assimilating.  They come to conquer.
Using the troops to build the wall once will be a far cheaper and more effective solution than stationing 1000's of soldiers on the border permanently to protect is from illegal invasion.
A brand new caravan of 15,000 Hondurans is on its way to our border.  President Trump must use the troops to build the wall and protect us!

Thanks to President Trump, this time next year American troops will be at home celebrating Christmas with their families instead of in Syria! #AmericaFirst
President Trump walked away from a life of adulation and comfort to fight for #MAGA.  He is a brave, selfless hero who deserves our utmost respect.

The Fed is causing extreme distress in the financial markets by continuing to raise interest rates despite low inflation.  Hopefully this will end soon and the market will rebound.

While the financial media beats the recession drum daily, consumer and manufacturing confidence reaches new highs and GDP hits 3.4%!
Lots of reasons for the stock market troubles - higher interest rates, anti-business Democrat House, censorship cratering big tech.  The actual economy is fantastic!
Thank you to all of the dear patriots who lobbied Congress to pass tax reform.  Without it, The Trump Economic Miracle would never have happened!
As I look at how hard it was to fund the wall and get Obamacare repealed and replaced by this Republican Congress, I realize it was a miracle that tax reform got done!
President Trump must stand strong and get the wall funded.  The #SchumerShutdown cannot win!
Anyone who thought we had won the war when President Trump was elected in 2016 was mistaken.  The #DeepState is very deep and very determined.  We must fight harder now than ever before!

The arrogance of Chuck Schumer is painful to watch.  He is actually claiming that President Trump has made America LESS prosperous and LESS secure while he threatens to raise taxes and opposes the wall?

With President Trump, a deal isn't as deal until it's signed.  He gives many feints and misdirections before closing to feel out the opposition and see how they react.
The Fed has always been ultra-paranoid about inflation to the point of killing growth to prevent it.  Inflation is like CO2.  You can demonize it but without it, no trees.
Even Jim Cramer, no fan of Trump, is baffled that the Feds would raise interest rates with the stock market already in freefall.
Raising interest rates is complete foolishness and a pure poison pill on the economy and our President. We are at war within our own Country. We must fight back now!

I am amazed by President Trump's mental toughness that despite the daily barrage of attacks, he just keeps going #MAGA for us!
We know walls work.  Look at Israel.  Democrats just don't want it because they need those illegal votes to win, just like CA and NV in 2018.
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have said President Trump will NEVER get his wall funded.  Fine, let¬ís have the military build it.  It is a national security emergency.

The Democrats are rattling the impeachment saber, but they would be NUTS to actually go down that path, especially on this fake campaign finance stuff.
The Clinton Foundation Hearings this week were devastating for Democrats and yet, there was barely a mention of them in the media.
The hearings this week about the Clinton Foundation exposed that while operating as a non-profit, it was no such thing.  If that can be proven, Hillary has a major tax issue.
Can you imagine if there had been FISA warrants tapping Obama's phones during his transition in 2008? The corruption discovered would have been extreme!
The wall in Israel has lowered illegal immigration from 55,000 to only 1 per year.  Walls work!  Nancy Pelosi just wants illegals so they can vote Democrat.
Nancy Pelosi is willing to shut down the government forever to block wall funding.  I guess she just took the mantle of government shutdown back from President Trump, didn't she?
President Trump is truly making America great again and all the Democrats want to do is litigate and resist.  My only conclusion can be that Democrats don't want America to be great.  Awful.
The Democrats are running out of options to attack President Trump. First they tried vote recounts, then #RussianCollusion, then campaign finance violations.  It's all falling apart.
Robert Mueller‚Äôs team pulled a Hillary Clinton by deleting text messages from Peter Strzok‚Äôs iPhone. 		This is the real obstruction of justice we need to be talking about!

Nancy Pelosi just said she would keep the government closed forever rather than negotiate border wall funding.
And now NY federal Prosecutors are investigating Trump Inaugural spending.  It's always New York!
Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Martha MacCullum on FOX News Channel he is 100% sure he has the votes to pass $5 billion in border wall funding.

Nancy Pelosi has a wall around her estate and a security detail funded by the taxpayers. 		It‚Äôs no wonder she does not care about the safety &amp; security of average Americans!
President Trump is indicating he will have the military build the border wall if Congress refuses.  Gets positive response from Republican leadership in the Senate.

Apparently, James Comey has developed severe amnesia.  Congressmen at his hearing expressed shock he could remember how to get out of the room after it was over.
Rumors are that President Trump is looking at Mark Meadows as Chief of Staff.  That would be an excellent #MAGA choice.
Candidates can donate unlimited amounts of personal funds to their own campaigns.  Unlimited.
Mueller has NOTHING on #RussiaGate.  How do we know?  The Democrats are obsessed with this campaign finance #FakeCrime.  If they had Trump on Russia, they'd be talking about that.
The plea Cohen copped too, campaign finance violations, were not even a crime, just a fantasy created by NY prosecutors to entrap Trump.

The recent volatility in the stock market is due primarily to uncertainty over China trade and interest rates.  The economy is awesome!
A federal judge has raised speculation that Hillary Rodham Clinton and her State Department ¬ìcolluded¬î to keep her missing emails secret from the public and courts, an escalation of scrutiny into Obama-era scandal.
Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth in a new memo also called the Clinton email affair ¬ìone of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.¬î
President Trump is nominating William Burr to be his new AG.  In the past Burr was critical of Hillary's email server and Comey's infamous news conference exonerating her.
As expected, serial liar James Comey is refusing to answer many questions at his closed door hearing with Congress today.

"The WALL Act would fully fund the border wall by closing existing loopholes that provide illegal immigrants with federal benefits and tax credits," Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.
The financial markets have no idea what to expect from this new divided Democrat Congress.  I wonder if I can by "Complete Waste Of Time" futures?
The recent stock market volatility is due to interest rate uncertainty, Democrat House uncertainty and China Trade uncertainty.  The market hates uncertainty.
MSNBC's Katy Tur recently said on camera that her life was "now pointless" due climate change.  In protest, she promised to never drive her car again - not really.

December is going to be a HUGE month for the #DeepState.  If Trump is going to take them down, this is the time.
Since Flynn was let off with no jail time, he could not have been a part of Russian Collusion, and yet, he helped Mueller's investigation.  Which investigation?  Hillary perhaps?
The United States already has a surplus of welfare recipients, yet liberals want to import more via the migrant caravan? 		Liberalism is definitely wack!
CNN‚Äôs Douglas Brinkley said ‚Äònobody‚Äô wants to see President Trump at George H.W. Bush‚Äôs funeral. 		Correction: Nobody wants to see CNN on the air anymore.
How did so many economists become liberals, given liberals are TERRIBLE at the economy?
President Trump's tough stance on trade seems to be reaping dividends as China has agreed to significantly drop trade barriers in exchange for lowered tariffs.
Despite all the craziness, America is still the greatest nation on Earth with the most opportunity!  Retweet if you agree!
Will the DNC screw the Bernie Wing of their Party in 2020 like they did in 2016?  Civil war is coming!
I can't wait for the clown car of candidates Democrats will be putting forth to run in 2020!
The Democrat Party is far more divided than people think.  The new young Turks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be disruptors for the Pelosi leadership.
Does anyone else find it terrifying that Nancy Pelosi's first agenda item has nothing to do with improving the lives of American Citizens?
Here we are just weeks from the swearing in of the Democrat House and we still have no idea what their agenda will be - oh yes, #amnesty.  Geesh.
The year is winding down.  Time to get your financial house in order.  The money you pay hiring a tax accountant will be paid back ten-fold or more in the money you save.
Am I the only one who finds the fact lightweight Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now one of the primary speakers for the Democrat Party absolutely hilarious?

Hearts and prayers for the family of George Bush.  Rest in peace.
The United States needs to go back to the days when it was a sanctuary for Americans - not illegal immigrants!
Hillary Clinton lied to Congress, so	why hasn't anyone prosecuted her?!
Chuck Schumer said that Democrats care about protecting our borders.  Really?  Prove it!  Fund the wall!
We are now hearing that some caravan invaders have AIDS and TB!  Why don't Democrats want to protect us from this?
The Huber report to Congress is on December 5th.  He has had a staff of over 400 looking at The Clinton Foundation for a year now.  #TickTock!
Considering the Mueller Investigation has cost close to $40 million dollars and ruined lives, he better have more than just process crimes created by his investigation!
This whole blow-up on Cohen seems to be a nothing burger.  It's old information and yet another attempt at a process crime by Mueller.
Barack Obama is claiming credit for the US now being the world's largest oil producer?  WAT?!!!  This man is delusional!
Huber testifies about The Clinton Foundation on Dec 5th.  He has had a huge budget and staff working on this for a year! #popcorn!
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow threatened more tariffs on China Tuesday in a joint press conference with press secretary Sarah Sanders and national security adviser John Bolton.
Between Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, I don't know who is the biggest asset to the Republican Party!
It looks like Nancy Pelosi will be the Democrat Speaker of the House.  So long as no one asks her who the President is, she should be fine.
The migrant caravan wants President Trump to speed up the asylum process so more migrants can get into the United States. 		How about we speed up the wall &amp; deportations?

Dear Liberals, scientists get stuff wrong all the time.  If a theory cannot be wrong, it's not scientific.
Trump says he "doesn't believe" the crazy climate hoax report and Liberals go ballistic!
As far as climate change, if I have a choice between CO2 which makes up only .004 of the atmosphere or a  giant burning ball so bright I'd go blind if I look at it, I'll go with the giant burning ball.
According to the media, these caravan invaders are peaceful people looking for work.  In reality they pushed women and children to the front and stood behind them throwing rocks!
The media is trying to make it look as if the caravan is poor running women and children, scared for their lives when in reality it is mostly young, fighting age men.
So many Democrats who were losing on election day surged to victory as late votes were "found."  I'm not buying it!
Both Clinton and Obama lost BIG in the Senate as they lost BIG in the House, but with Trump, things went opposite directions.  Something is fishy here.
So strange that President Trump increased his advantage in the Senate while losing the House in a route.  That has NEVER happened before.
Immigration is now the #1 issue in America and 70% of voters disagree with Democrat plans to abolish ICE.  HOW did they win the House?  No one wants their policies!
@CalebDennis18 Is he Freddie Mercury playing ball
I don't get it.  Does the new Democrat Congress WANT our southern border invaded by this caravan?  Where are their declarations of support for Trump's efforts to stop them?
@markschlereth Exactly!!!! BTW can we order your chili online from Florida?!!!!
Name one way in which the Democrat House will improve America's economy in the next 2 years?
So far, I sense the Democrats are mostly going to investigate Trump, the most successful economic President in history, with their newfound power.  I'm sure THAT'S what folks voted for. #smh
Still waiting on the Democrat's economic agenda.  Isn't the media even a little curious?
I almost feel sorry for the manmade global warming crowd, having to release their dire warming warning during one of the coldest early winters on record.
Are they serious?  A temperature increase of 3 to 12 degrees in the next 80 years?  Kind of a HUGE range there?  Oh right, that's how WILD GUESSES are.
The Democrats won back leadership of the House over 2 weeks ago and I still have no idea how they plan to improve the economy?
The next two years leading up to President Trump's re-election will be a battle for the soul of this country - but #MAGA Nation is up to the task and ready for the fight!
Had a lovely Thanksgiving evening with President Trump and his beautiful family at Mar-a-Lago last night.  What an incredible event!
Chief Justice Roberts really stepped in it making the preposterous claim that Obama-era judges have no political bias.  Trump isn't back down from that fight!
I hope everyone had a joyous Thanksgiving.  We all need one day where we cast our dietary disciplines to the wind and just enjoy good friends and good food!
I‚Äôm thankful Donald Trump is our president!

The Fed has had a tendency to overshoot in the past and cause problems in the economy.  Inflation is in check.  We don't need to raise rates more!

Other than Democrat cheating, Paul Ryan is the most to blame for Republicans losing the House.  The Republican Base is glad to see him go.
After 2 years of Democrat rule in the House, America will remember why they threw these bums out in 2010!
The 2019 Democrat Congress will easily devolve into one investigation after another, one subpoena after another, one new witch hunt after another.
I never cease to be amazed by the hypocritical outrage of the Left.  These people have no moral compass.  They feel no guilt or shame.
Democrats who saw nothing wrong with Hillary hiding classified documents on her private server, then bleach bitting them to hide evidence are now outraged over Ivanka's emails.
The base is very upset about the appearance of cheating by Democrats in the 2018 midterms.  President Trump needs to get on this and stay on this until 2020.
Democrats are so afraid of interim AG Whitaker their Senators are actually suing to block him.  What are they afraid of?  What are they hiding?
Social Media is going to be under tremendous pressure in 2019 to stop the censorship.  Facebook stock appears to be in big trouble already!
Brenda Snipes has resigned from her role in Broward County.  That isn't enough.  She must be investigated for election fraud.  This was more than just incompetence.
The White House has informed Jim Acosta of CNN they will suspend his press pass again once the injunction period is over.  I guess his gloating was premature?
Republicans lent Democrats the House for the next 2 years.  Come 2020, will be the best thing that ever happened as we take the House back #MAGA-style!
So, what are Democrats going to do with the House?  Are they going to make all those freshman who promised to fight Pelosi vote with her?
Despite "finding" 83,000 votes late that went mostly to Democrats, Snipes still couldn't cheat enough to pull off the win in FL.  DeSantis and Scott are IN!
President Trump and the DOJ need to stand up to this voter fraud and fight for us.  The base is very unhappy.  We need action!
The Democrats just turned red Orange County blue on the strength of late and found votes.  You believe that?  Neither do I.
The Democrats are very divided.  We'll see that more and more as time goes by the next 2 years.
The Democrats don't have the votes to repeal #TaxReform or derail the economy.  Thank God!
More than ever, Republicans have become the party of the middle class, the Democrats the party of the uber-wealthy and the very poor.
Democrats could be in big trouble as the Trump DOJ looks at election cheating on their part.
President Trump endorsing Pelosi for Speaker must be driving Liberals NUTS!
A judge affirmed his order Friday to evict Michael Avenatti¬ís law firm from a California office building for skipping out on $213,000 in rent over four months.
President Trump is asking the Caravan, if you hate your country so much you'd leave it, why do you wave your home country's flag?
Now that Democrats are in charge of the House, THEY will get blamed for shutting down the government.  Trump will have real leverage so they can avoid that.
President Trump is focused on building the wall and is expressing his willingness to shut down the government to get it.
President Trump offered an olive branch to Nancy Pelosi in endorsing her for Speaker, but make no mistake, he will be VERY tough with the Democrat House.
RINOs and the Democrats are trying to sabotage our President's success and his promises on immigration. 		Ignore them and BUILD THE WALL!

The Democrat Majority of 2019 will forever be under a cloud of suspicion with the voting irregularities which took place!
Did America really vote for higher taxes, more regulation, fewer jobs, more crime and sanctuary cities in 2018?  I don't think so.
Democrats will seek to roll back tax reform in the House but they simply don 't have the votes. But I'm glad to watch them try as they alienate America.
This Avenatti guy.  Geesh, what a mess.
In the next 2 years, the Democrat Congressmen who pretended to be moderates to win red and purple districts will be exposed as frauds as they vote lockstep with Democrat Leadership.
If the Republican House is smart, they will continue to create new #MAGA Legislation only to have Democrats block it with their own far left agenda.
I expect the 2019 Democrat House Majority to be a circus as factions fight amongst themselves and leaders vie for 2020.
The Democrats are already showing cracks in their leadership and they haven't even been sworn in yet!
This ridiculous "vote-finding" by Democrats has taken place all across the country as "late votes" turn losing Democrats into winners.
Federal Prosecutors have been asked to look into potential illegal activity by Democrats in the FL election - stay tuned!

President Trump doesn't need to start worrying about an election for a year.  He can go all out, pure #MAGA through 2019.  Hold onto your chairs Democrats, it¬ís gonna get rough for you!
Why is winning the Senate more important than winning the House?  Well, the entire House will be back up for re-election in 2020 for one thing!  Senators last 6 years!
Despite "losing" the House for 2 years, Republicans and #MAGA are still firmly in control of America!
¬ìBoom: Record high business optimism, need for employees at 45-year high¬î What the hell were people doing voting for Democrats?
Thank goodness Republicans united to pass tax reform before these crazy Democrats take back the House for the next 2 years.  This Trump economic miracle would not exist without it!
President Trump needs to be very aggressive in going after these House Democrats in 2019.
I can't see the Democrat House Majority getting much done other than issuing subpoenas and stamping their feet for the next 2 years.
Florida hangs in the balance.  On the surface, it would appear that the Desantis and Scott victories will be secure but anything could happen with Democrats "finding" ballots.
The more that comes out, the worse it gets.  Democrat vote fraud and cheating coast to coast.  The Republican Leadership MUST stand up to this.  The base demands justice!

Nothing wrecks the Democrats faster than giving them a little power.  Look what 8 years of Obama did to their party!
President Trump is a strong leader and will stand up for us against this Democrat House!
Follow my Twitter feed for great advice on finance, real estate and taxes!
I'm always shocked when I see people voting for the failed Democrats.  Retweet if you agree!
The Democrats in the House do not have the power to stop or even slow the Trump economy.  Trump still holds the winning hand.
Was it worth it to lose the House to Democrats for 2 years in order to drain the swamp of #NeverTrump?  Absolutely.  Sometimes you just have to prune the tree.
The past is the past.  We must now set our sights on 2020 and finding attractive #MAGA candidates to replace these Democrat "moderate" fakers!
Will be lots of gridlock on Capitol Hill the next two years. Although they control the House for a season, Democrats do not have the power to pass their radicalism into law.
Write your Congressmen!  Tax Reform 2.0 is at risk with the new Democrat House!  We must make the Tax Reform 1.0 changes permanent and adjust the parts that require fixing!

The next two years will be a nightmare of division and infighting for the Democrats.  They will wish we had never lent them the House for 2 years!
I have an exciting new show coming up soon on the YourVoice¬ô America Network about taxes, finance and real estate!  It's going to be amazing.  Stay tuned!
President Trump is all for a free press and gives dramatically more news conferences than Obama ever did.  But he is for a FREE press, not a PROPAGANDA press!
"Look, I don¬ít think he¬ís a smart person, but he¬ís got a loud voice," Trump said, adding that "it could be others" whose press passes he might revoke.
President Donald Trump ripped CNN¬ís Jim Acosta for being "very unprofessional" Friday, saying that the way he treats Sarah Sanders is a "disgrace."

I expect a lot of infighting between the Liberal and Socialist wings of the Democrat Party as the 2020 elections approach.  Both vying for ultimate party control.
Because of their small majority and lack of Senate control, Democrats won't be able to repeal #TaxReform or affect economic policy at all.  Pelosi is a paper tiger.
Why do voters keep believing these Democrats when they run as moderates then immediately flip to screaming Liberals the moment they are elected?
Manchin of WV seemed like the most bipartisan, moderate guy - that is, until he won re-election.  Now he is attacking Trump on a daily basis.
Democrats appear obsessed with calling the resignation of Jeff Sessions a #ConstitutionalCrisis.  Where in the Constitution does it say a President cannot request the resignation of a Cabinet member?
Trump's Interim AG, Whitaker, is refusing to recuse himself from the Mueller Probe or anything else for that matter, much to the chagrin of the Democrats.
One of the things we love so much about President Trump is that he refuses to be cowed by the Democrats and their media sycophants.
Rick Scott, the guy who appears to be getting ripped off in the FL recount is the sitting Governor of the state.  If there are shenanigans being played, he needs to step in and stop them.
The Florida votes are still be counted and so far, it seems a remarkably high percentage are going to the Democrats.  Well, It's up to FL Republican Leadership to save themselves!

Senate... you have 4 weeks to pass Tax Reform 2.0 which passed Congress in October. Once the new House takes office.. Tax Reform 2.0 will be DOA! If you don‚Äôt make Tax Reform rates permanent the Democrats will immediately look to start repealing parts of Tax Reform 1.0
How could anyone in media NOT show the utmost respect for The President? This question really goes out to everyone.
Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has said in the past he would indict Hillary Clinton. 		Now is the time! We cannot let her get away with all her crimes. #LockHerUp
If blacks and Hispanics turn out in greater percentages than ever before for Republicans, that could be the difference this midterm!
I am seeing lots of polls which lead me to believe Hispanics will be voting RED this year.
The richest man in Florida sees stock market falling 15% if Democrats control Congress.  Could be worse than that!
Republicans will win today, but in the event they were to lose, Democrats would make such asses of themselves over the next 2 years Trump would win in a 2020 landslide!
This is it.  This election is for all the marbles.  Do we continue to greatness or step back to mediocrity?
It really is hard to believe that slightly less than half the country is nuts.  How could anyone want to go back to Democrat, #AmericaLast rule?  How can this even be close?
Hollywood celebrities are stumping hard for Democrats.  Lotta good that did in 2016!
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told the Los Angeles Times Monday that the investigation into so-called ¬ìRussian collusion¬î will be a top priority if Democrats win the midterm elections. Are they kidding?!
Half of the nation¬ís Latinos want U.S. troops deployed to stop the migrant caravans, say two polls taken just before the midterm elections.
More than a third of the Americans with Latino heritage in close races do not think Democrats will be tough enough to curb migration!

The world should follow America, America should not follow the world!  #AmericaFirst, not #Globalism!
It's no coincidence that everything Democrats campaign on will result in America being weaker and more powerless against our enemies.  This is what they want!
If Democrats take back Congress, all economic progress of the last 2 years will end.  Tax reform will be repealed, borders will be opened.  Vote GOP like your lives depend on it!
I look at the samples used in these national polls and it is confusing.  They always estimate only 25% Republican turnout when early voting has been closer to 40%!
We are looking at something remarkable in FL - Republicans outperforming Democrats in early voting. Panhandle still votes Monday.  Vote GOP!
President Trump has done a great job against all odds.  Let¬ís give him the #MAGA Congress he needs to finish the job!
Do you like your tax cuts?  Democrats will vote to repeal them!  Don¬ít let it happen!  Vote GOP!
If Democrats take back the House, instead of economic growth we'll only grow investigations and taxes!
I think the media and Democrats are going to be SHOCKED at the returns on Election Night.  C'mon baby!  #RedTsunami
The media is saying Gillum and Scott will win FL but I don¬ít see how.  They are running over 100k behind where they were in 2016 in EV.
I am thrilled at the #MAGA Patriots turning out in huge numbers at the polls.  Let's roll #TrumpTrain!
At the point, Democrats need a late surge miracle to have any shot at all of not losing seats.  They are in TROUBLE!
Its not just that Gillum took Hamilton tickets from an FBI plant, it's that the FBI had a plant trying to entrap Gillum!
This guy Gillum looks pretty corrupt.  No wonder the FBI had a sting running on him.
It's not to late to give to your favorite GOP candidate!  Every penny helps to GOTV!
Democrats are running on Nancy Pelosi, higher taxes and open border?  God help them!
Thanks to all the amazing patriots who called your Congressmen and got Tax Reform passed.  Without it, the economy would not be nearly as amazing.
We MUST have a Republican Congress to get Tax Reform 2.0 fully passed and the wall funded.  Vote GOP and bring a friend!
Know how you usually see that big dump at the start for Democrats when EV comes in and Republicans play catch-up all night?  Not this year.  This year Republicans get the early lead!
Republicans keep racking up big wins in early voting.  Democrats on the ropes.  Don¬ít see how they come back from this.
Democrats are upset by President Trump‚Äôs new ad because it shows the truth they are trying to hide.
Stunning https://t.co/uhTzZMqor8
This is just unbelievable https://t.co/VgBIz9oPda
Just wanted to say thank you to the whole #MAGA Nation for bringing us this far.  Just one last big push on 11/6 and we can lock in these gains for a generation!
#TrustTrump.  He knows what he is doing!
If you liked Tax Reform 1.0, you're going to LOVE Tax Reform 2.0 but we NEED a GOP Congress to get it done!
If we can enter Trump's 2nd two years with a #MAGA Speaker, #MAGA Majority Leader, #MAGA House and #MAGA Senate, it's off to the races!
Wow, the early voting for Republicans is off the charts, rivaling 2016 turnout!  Please get out and vote.  We must defeat socialist Gillum and Nelson!
Republicans want to give the middle class a 10% tax cut on top of the tax cuts the middle class received last year. 		This can only happen if Republicans win in November. Go vote &amp; spread the word!
I am so excited about 2019!  If Republicans can hold the House and grow our lead in the Senate, 2019 will be an amazing year for the stock market and the economy!
If we want Tax Reform 2.0 to happen, we need to maintain the House and grow our lead in the Senate.  Let's go folks!  We're so close.  Let's make this happen!
Did anyone REALLY think only 25% of the midterm electorate would be Republican?  In many battleground states, it is running closer to 44%!  Generic polls were based upon 25%!
We are seeing it across the whole country.  Democrats just aren't turning out as expected and Republicans are flocking to the early polls.  Amaze!
Wow!  Have you seen these early voting numbers in FL?  In 2016, Democrats lead walk-ins by 154,000 at this point.  This year, they lead by only 3000 and trail absentees by 65,000!
Early voting is looking great for the GOP.  No sign of a #BlueWave anywhere!
I'm excited about the benefits the new tax changes will be bringing to the American taxpayer, both businesses and families!
Once Republicans hold the House comfortably and grow their lead in the Senate, the next 2 years of the Trump Presidency will be remarkable in its achievements!
Two human brains remarkably similar in size, shape and construction.  One believes Liberalism is a great idea, the other Conservative mind thinks they are crazy.  Amazes me to think about it.
"Anti-Communist lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro won the Brazilian presidential election on Sunday."  Trumpism is taking over everywhere!
Early voting reflects that Republican turnout is actually much higher than Democrat turnout in key states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee and Texas. Republicans are also closing the gap in Nevada.
In one of his most brutal Tweets in recent memory, President Trump went after Democrat candidate for Governor in Florida, Andrew Gillum. Trump calls him a ¬ìthief,¬î and the ¬ìMayor of poorly run Tallahassee.¬î
"A GOP office in Volusia County, South Carolina was the target of several gunshots sometime between Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, according to local news reports." Violent Left.
Trump is sending 5000 more troops to the border to stop the caravan.  He means business!  Great optics right before a midterm where illegal immigration is the #1 issue.
President Trump is back to 50% approval with a week to go before the midterms.  42% happy with the direction of the country, almost 20 points higher than under Obama!
Democrats love to blame President Trump when a tragedy happens, but they never offer to be a part of the solution to prevent these tragedies from happening again.

It will likely come down to a Tarkanian victory to keep Pelosi out as Soeaker of the House! Stakes are high! https://t.co/0vGGFP4VTQ
Trump engaged in well planned tax strategies as he reaped riches from his father - The New York Times. If you want to reap the same best practice tax strategies DM me! https://t.co/ZG7zJGqYiF
Let there be no doubt, the amazing Trump economy is due to his tax cuts, with even more to come.  President Trump is promising an additional 10% tax cut for the middle class!
Typically, "Democrats vote early, Republican votes on time," but this year, Republicans are voting early in numbers vastly outpacing Democrats.  #BlueWave?  We are looking at a #RedTsunami!
Early voting results have grown from troubling to an impending disaster for Democrats.  In Florida alone the EV advantage has ballooned to 75,000 in favor of Republicans!
Obama is frustrated that President Trump wants to block the invasion caravan from Honduras.  These Democrats have lost their minds.  They would throw open our borders to anyone!
Hearts and prayers for the victims and their families in the senseless Life Synagogue shooting today.  You always wonder how a person can have this much hate to do such a horrific thing?
U.S. GDP grew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter. 		Remember when the Democrats said that was impossible? #MAGA
Overvalued tech companies have been taking a beating.  One reason is that people are sick and tired of their bias against Conservatives!
The markets hate uncertainty.  You literally cannot get more uncertain than things are now.  Stock traders don't know who will control Congress in 2019.  It's a little crazy for them right now.
Stocks bounced back bigtime today.  This is just normal churn taking place before a contentious midterm.  Normal.
The timing of these "mail bombs,"  all of which have been duds, is highly suspect.  2 weeks before the midterms?  Really?  What #MAGA person would give Democrats that gift?
I don't see how we can refer to "the mail bomber," when none of his bombs go off.  Maybe we should call him, "pipe guy" or something more accurate.

Always beware counting on a big ANGER vote for electoral victory.  People were angry at Obama in 2012 but Romney lost white blue collar voters and lost.  You need a positive agenda!

This "bomb scare" sent to only Democrats seems a little fishy to me.  Stamps but no postmark and none of the devices went off?  False flag operation?
Twitter is trying to influence the midterm elections by having the hashtag #MAGABomber trend. 		It is now more important than ever for Republicans &amp; Trump supporters to get out and vote on November 6th!
The problem with lots of ad money when you have a terrible message is you are tempted to spend it and remind everyone you have a terrible message!
Silicon Valley is throwing all kinds of money at Democrats in the midterms.  Sadly, for them, it will be wasted as Democrats fall further and further behind.
Polling "expert" Nate Silver, who predicted a Hillary victory in 2016, is now predicting a Democrat wave in 2018 despite surging Republican enthusiasm and strong early voting - he's a joke.
The average unaccompanied minor illegal alien costs the US taxpayer $36,000 a year.  That's more than many Americans with kids make working full time jobs.  This must STOP!
"It's no longer Republicans versus the Democrats, it's America versus socialism. The movement in this Democratic Party toward clear socialism, that's what they're doing." - Kevin McCarthy
The midterms will be a referendum on whether America has suddenly and inexplicably lost its mind.  I'm going with no.  America is quite sane and will remain quite #MAGA.
Here's the scary part.  As bad as having a Speaker Pelosi back in charge of Congress, rumors are she is grooming Adam Schiff to replace her.  My God.
President Trump is at 50% approval, GDP is at 4.6%, unemployment is at record lows and satisfaction with the direction of the country is at 43% (up from 28% under Obama).  This does not a wave election make!
Perez of the DNC is already lowering expectations of a #BlueWave. Kind of expected that.
This caravan is looking more and more like an army of thugs by the day.  The Democrats will regret concocting this "October Surprise." Now they pretend like thy had nothing to do with it!
.@realDonaldTrump has called for an additional 10% tax cut for the middle class!		Retweet if you are ready to keep more money in your pocket!
The Warren DNA fiasco has hurt her badly. I just hope she runs for President and the Democrats nominate her. :-)

The media loves to label Democrats as "rockstars."  The latest is Beto in Texas.		If by rockstar they mean getting his butt kicked in November, then dead on.
News Flash to CNN.		No reporters are getting beaten up by Trump supporters.  Now man up snowflakes!
Democrats claim President Trump is "hostile to working people," even as his economy has created 400,000 new manufacturing jobs and blue collar wages are rising faster than any other group!
John Cox is SURGING in the CA Governor's race and has Newsom's lead down to single digits.  In addition, there is a good chance Democrats won't take a single seat held by a Republican in CA.  No #BlueWave!
Cruz is running well ahead of Beto in Texas, despite Beto "raising" vast sums of campaign cash.  Doesn't matter how you dress it up with ads, Texas will never vote for a socialist!
Republicans are surging in races across the nation as Democrats fade into the close.		Nov 6th is going to be fun!
This Migrant Caravan is going to backfire badly upon the Democrats who are clearly funding it.  By large majorities, Americans want our borders protected and oppose this invasion.
President Trump never stops trying to help US Citizens... https://t.co/rGPzbr89Yk
President Trump has threatened to send the Army to the southern border to protect it from these "caravans" of invaders from South America!		He should use some of that defense budget to just build the wall!
JUST MORE TRUMP WINNING BEHIND THE SCENES!		"President Donald Trump broke the all-time two-year record last week for appointing judges to the federal appeals court and immediately nominated more."
Democrats don't care about results - they care about creating perpetual victims who will vote for them so they can get paid.  Everything they do creates dependency - and that's just how they like it!
In an incredible video, reporters go on Campus and ask Beto supporters to name a single accomplishment by him.		Literally no one can.		Amazing.
The Democrats want illegals to vote in Texas and to just give away money to working families.		Everything they do is illegal or crazy!

Well folks, on Nov 6th we get to find out the truth.  Have pollsters been lying to us all this time claiming Independents oppose Trump 2:1?  Pretty sure the answer to that will be YES!
Democrats are actually running on rolling back tax cuts to businesses which has been the #1 reason for the booming jobs economy.  These people are insane!
Early ballot requests in major battleground states are in and the news is GREAT for Republicans!  While Republicans are outperforming even 2016 numbers, Democrats are lagging behind 2016 numbers.  Uh-oh...
Only twice since WW2 has a sitting President gained seats in one house while losing them in the other.  If Republicans gains seats in  the Senate as they surely will, history says they gain in the House too!
In 2016, America finally came to her senses and elected a #Results President, Donald J Trump.  In 2018, we get to find out we somehow went insane since then, or are ready to empower our President Trump for more winning with a #MAGA Congress!
Across the nation, Republicans are surging in race after race - even as Pelosi predicts a Democrat tsunami.  		Let's not forget, Nancy Pelosi predicted a "good day" for Democrats in 2010 as well.
President Trump is fully committed to making America's Military the best, most modern and well-equipped defense force on the planet.  He is requesting $700 billion for the next budget year!		We cannot allow China and Russia to surpass us!
The Fed has a difficult task - to keep the US Economy on a steady glidepath for longterm growth without overheating but also not killing the goose that laid the golden egg.		Given low inflation, the Fed by raising rates 7 times has been exceptionally aggressive.  Balancing act.
Jeff Sessions has designated 5 groups as "Transnational Criminal Organizations" and is putting Rosenstein in charge of the task force targeting these groups.		These don't sound like the acts of men who expect to be fired.
Looks like Mueller is planning to wrap up his investigation shortly after the midterms.  Regardless of the exact timing, President Trump will go into his second two years clean and clear of the #Russiagate lie.

Well, it looks as if Elizabeth Warren is actually 1/1000th American Indian.  It says a lot about the Democrat agenda when THAT is their most significant "win" over the past 2 years.

THIS IS REAL WINNING!		Median household income rose to $61,372 in 2017, a post-recession high. Wages up in August by their fastest rate since June 2009. Paychecks rose by 3.3 percent between 2016 and 2017, the most in a decade.

Jobless claims at lowest level in nearly five decades. The economy has achieved the longest positive job-growth streak on record. Job openings are at an all-time high and outnumber job seekers for the first time on record.		#TrumpEconomy!
For the first time in more than a decade, growth is projected to exceed 3 percent over the calendar year.		Remember when economists scoffed at the idea Trump could achieve this?
4 million new jobs have been created since Trump's election, and more than 3.5 million since Trump took office. Most of this was due to the promise of #TaxReform!
President Trump has had the most successful first 2 years of his presidency of any President in US history with more promises kept than even Ronald Reagan!  Right now his list of major achievements stands at 289!  When does this man sleep?!

"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening that Democrats have taken civility to a ‚Äúnew low‚Äù during Justice Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation process."		And THIS is why they will lose the midterms.  This ISN'T America.
Eric Holder, former Obama AG, suggested during a speech that Democrats "kick" Republicans.  In the current atmosphere of violence and harassment against innocent Trump supporters, this is dangerous talk.  The frightening thing is, we are hearing the same from several Dem leaders.

Every great thing was achieved one step at a time.  On those days where you feel down or discouraged, just stick with the plan and put one foot in front of the other and keep moving.  Emotions make great followers but terrible leaders.
Tax reform never polls well because no one likes taxes, reformed or not.  But make no mistake, the driving force behind this amazing Trump economy IS #TaxReform.  The windfall companies are seeing is allowing them to hire at record levels!
Heart goes out to those in the path of Michael. I pray its windspeeds and storm surge lessen dramatically but that it comes ashore and passes quickly creating the least amount of flooding!
Is the media's 92% negative coverage of Trump hurting him?  According to the latest Rasmussen Poll, Trump is at 51% approval, a record high for his administration; meanwhile, the media languishes at record lows.  I think they are only harming themselves!
The latest report shows that Trump is receiving 92% negative media coverage.  This is quite remarkable considering we are in the midst of one of the greatest economic expansions in history!

Pollsters have Independents preferring Democrats in Congress by 2:1 - and now we have THIS:		https://t.co/7nMWXvDEIL
If the Democrats were to win back power in November, all #MAGA would grind to a halt.  Tax cuts would be rolled back.  Borders would be flung open and for the next two years, we'd hear nothing but impeach, impeach, impeach.
And now, as if making clowns of themselves during the Kavanaugh hearings weren't enough, The Democrats are openly running on impeaching Justice Kavanaugh if they take back power, an idea popular with a tiny fraction of voters and angering Republicans.
Key to the Democrat's plan to defeat the Kavanaugh appointment as for him to withdraw or Trump to withdraw his name.  One thing which greatly helped in busting that plan was Avenatti introducing an absolutely ridiculous "witness" to insert himself into the process.
The long term ramifications of Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation to SCOTUS cannot be overstated.  The Democrats, whose last hold on power was the ability to legislate from the bench, are in deep deep trouble.

@TaxReformExpert good morning friends - let start this day right
"I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends."		 - Abraham Lincoln		President Trump understands this and it is at the core of his foreign policy.
Ariel Dumas is a writer for Stephen Colbert.  Here's what she tweeted about Kavanaugh:		‚ÄúWhatever happens, I‚Äôm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs life."		Um, he is now a Supreme Court Justice.  I don't think 'ruined' is the word you're looking for...
Look at the love and admiration with which Ashley Kavanaugh looks at her husband Brett as he is sworn in. What a beautiful moment. They are clearly a team. That's America folks! https://t.co/zH7SdQWecX
I imagine Democrat leadership sitting in a darkened room, only mood lighting on their faces as they stare blankly at each other. "He did it to us again.  We used every trick in the book and somehow, he beat us again..."		Then one voice speaks up. "Guys, its about to get worse..."
This really is a complete disaster for the Democrats.  They not only have a 5-4 Originalist Court, they have managed to fire up the Republican Base in ways no ads ever could.  They have provided us a common enemy so vile and devoid of humanity, we cannot help but to rise up!
You know, I have to wonder why Hollywood is so angry at Trump.  How has he harmed them?  Which of their fevered fears have actually come true?  Where are the death camps?  Where is the oppression of women and blacks?
One by one, Trump is taking away the Democrats tried and true weapons.  He doesn't care if the media hates him, is not concerned about near-term political ramifications and now, he's taken their biggest weapon of all, #JudicialActivism.
The Democrats have no agenda.  That means they must look for any and everything else to stir up their base.  The problem is that their most motivated base is so extreme, they are turning off the entire middle.
If you want to keep on WINNING, you have to vote Republican in November!
Democrats are pissed.  America must have had a good day.
I am watching and I still can't believe it.  McConnell, Graham, Collins, Grassley - all acting with such boldness?  Trump's strong leadership is definitely rubbing off on these Republicans.  I've never seen this level of spirit before! https://t.co/gAsVNe4F0S
I am going to call this trickle-down boldness.  President Trump's bold, brash, never-surrender leadership style has finally become a part of the Republican Leadership personality.  Incredible! https://t.co/o3gY6btBEs
Looks like Joe Manchin from WV is also a YES! on Kavanaugh.  Although a relief, I don't see how he could have voted against and have any hope of victory in bright red WV this November.
Susan Collins, in a speech for the ages, declared her support for Brett Kavanaugh to become the 9th Supreme Court Justice.  Wow, who would have guessed McConnell and Graham and Collins!		AMAZE!
The Democrats are accomplishing one thing.  They are putting the Republican Base on a mission to DEFEAT them and their Salem Witch Hunt ways in November.  There is no way America wants THIS in charge!

@TaxReformExpert speaks on #TaxReform at the Winn Room in California
Now the Democrats are crying COVERUP! on the FBI investigation.  Does it never end with these people?  They have no intention of voting for Kavanaugh if the FBI investigated for 30 years.  They have no shame!
Since the FBI Investigation found no corroborating evidence of sexual assault by Kavanaugh, are we to assume that every Democrat Senator will now vote NO on the man the left-leaning ABA gave their highest possible rating to based upon his jurisprudence?
Why are Democrats working so hard to help us win the midterms?  I mean this whole Kavanaugh thing was such a clumsily managed trainwreck.  They can't be this stupid, can they?
So let me guess.  We now need a CIA investigation of the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh?  And then we'll need an NSA investigation of the CIA's investigation?  And then we'll need a permanent Special Prosecutor to investigate all of them?

It's actually amusing watching the Media call the Beto O'Rourke FREE COUNTRY MUSIC CONCERT the biggest political rally since Obama with 50,000 in attendance.		Take away the free music the crowd is 1/10th that size or less.
As Democrats were spending their time dredging up false charges against Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump was forging the greatest trade alliance, USMCA, in history.		The praise is universal!		https://t.co/z0GiE09ldf
SAW THIS COMING:		"Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) face significant electoral pressure as another poll released on Tuesday confirmed that a majority of their constituents want Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh confirmed."
Taxcuts have A LOT to do with this optimism!		"MTV Poll: 79% of Young People Say Financial Future will Be Better or as Good as Parents"
These preposterous charges the Democrats are bringing forward against Judge Kavanaugh simply have to end.  They provide no evidence and even the author's identity is withheld.		At this point, it is pure character assassination and denial of due process.
Democrats,		Were you trying to fire us up because you kinda fired us up?
DEMOCRAT #1: "What do you wish?"		DEMOCRAT #2: "That Trump would stop helping so many people."
President Trump is signing a trade deal that will benefit every man woman and child in America, and yet Hollywood still calls him a racist, misogynist and egotist.		Hollywood has lost the narrative bigly.
Retweet if you believe Brett Kavanaugh will make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice!
The Democrats are trapped.  Trump has once again out-maneuvered them at every turn.  And just to show that he can multi-task, he signed the biggest trade deal in US history right in the middle of the Kavanaugh investigation.  Remarkable.
@TaxReformExpert provides #taxupdate: https://t.co/fxm97YstYp‚Ä¶
Have you ever noticed that Democrats are constantly running on UNDOING something rather than DOING something? https://t.co/WGaw0tB95P
Once Kavanaugh is confirmed and SCOTUS is 5-4, I feel this will be extremely demoralizing for the Democrat base.  Of course Democrats will run on impeaching Kavanaugh, but there is no evidence for that.  Bad spot for them.
Lindsey Graham is now calling for a deep investigation into the Democrats' entire handing of the Kavanaugh Hearings.  I think this will end badly for the Democrats as they clearly tried to game the system.
Here's the bottom line.  If you are going to accuse someone of something as serious as Ms Ford is accusing Judge Kavanaugh, you MUST have evidence.  She didn't even have a fake yearbook signature.
I see no upside for the Democrats in this Kavanaugh mess they have created.  They got the FBI investigation they wanted, but as everyone warned, the FBI does not investigate sexual assault claims, so basically they got an enhanced background check.		Now they are boxed in.
I will take Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs decades of impeccable public service over Matt Damon‚Äôs decades of covering up for Harvey Weinstein any day. https://t.co/XS8H18xEzI
Dear Democrats,		When you have a cockroach problem, don't turn on the lights. #FBIInvestigation
While the world and media obsess over the Kavanaugh hearings, Trump is within 48 hours of closing a major new NAFTA trade deal with Canada!		Can this man multi-task or what?! https://t.co/m7ByhKiPKF
What do the Democrats do when the FBI gives Kavanaugh a clean bill of health one week hence?  Do they attack the FBI or claim Trump is controlling them?  They are not interested in truth, only power - and that power is what will be denied to them. https://t.co/uIhZQN4iI9
The Democrats seething hatred does not serve them well here.  They are so possessed by #TDS that they have lost all sight of the optics to regular voters. https://t.co/dgI4wbuj11
"House Republicans passed a $631 billion extension of the tax cuts they enacted in 2017, reprising their biggest legislative success of the past two years."		Yes!
Can you picture this.  The FBI check completes in a week and Kavanaugh passes with flying colors.  Then we hold the vote and Democrats STILL vote NO? The red state Dems don't dare.  If they do, they are finished.		Fascinating!
The Democrats may have been bluffing when they asked for a one week investigation into Kavanaugh. assuming Republicans would not.  Now that Trump has agreed, they are in a tough spot.  If Kavanaugh passes the check, do they STILL vote against him?
Considering the FBI has already completed 6 background checks on Kavanaugh, professional pride would lead one the expect the evidence would have to be quite startling and damning for them to make a big deal of it now.
The President has opened a 1 week supplemental background check into Judge Kavanaugh.  He has already completed 6.  This will secure the votes of Flake, Collins and Murkowski.  It may actually turn against the Democrats.
As I've been promising Tax Reform 2.0 gets passed in Congress. More crumbs coming for Everyone....		https://t.co/2uxEaBeonD

Did Kavanaugh do enough today to get himself confirmed?  We shall see.  But it is clear the Democrats have seriously damaged their own brand beyond possible repair.
Ford's story was full of holes.  How did she get to the party?  How did she get home?  When was it?  Where was it?  It seems she conveniently forgot any information Kavanaugh could use to exonerate himself.
It would appear to me that Kavanaugh has the most important evidence of all on his side - a lifetime of spotless service as a judge, vouched for by hundreds of close and well-respected friends.
Kavanaugh, for his part has come across as strong, forthright and justifiably emotional at the attacks upon his wife and children, which will appeal to the female viewers.  Seeming too tough and too hard can be a turnoff and for Kavanaugh, he must win over the women to prevail.
The Kavanaugh hearings today have been fascinating and troubling.  There seems to be a strong emphasis on Ford's "believability" rather than any actual proof or evidence of her claims.  A great actor could make a strong case for the Easter Bunny.

"The White House has reportedly drafted an executive order to probe Facebook and Google censorship and bias."		This is HUGE.  These companies have become "the public square" and as such, must afford users 1st amendment rights!
I keep seeing these polls where Democrats are surging into the midterms, but given their #AmericaLast agenda, it's hard to believe.  Then I see President Trump give a rally for 30,000 in Missouri and I say, "Wow, now there's a poll I believe!"
"A new poll from The Huffington Post indicates that only a quarter of women believe that the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are credible."		It's time to #HoldTheVote and confirm Kavanaugh!
The Democrats have turned the Kavanaugh hearings into a 3 ring circus.  This cannot be helping them in the midterms as they seek to put themselves forward as the party that can govern for all of us!
The Democrats do not have any solutions to the problems facing the American people. 		They would rather sabotage Brett Kavanaugh and his family. 		Remember this in November!
If Christine Ford does not agree to testify before the Senate by 10pm tonight, Grassley will schedule the Kavanaugh vote for Monday!		Woohoo!  Love bold Republican leadership!
The Democrats have lost their minds!  They are now openly calling for Judge Kavanaugh to be denied his due-process and civil rights.  Frightening!

At this point, it is almost hard to imagine the economy doing much better without becoming inflationary.  And yet, with Tax Reform 2.0, it is poised to do even better!  Simply amazing!

Can you imagine being the #DNC's Advertising Agency?		Agency: "Ok, so what's your agenda?"	DNC: "Open borders, higher taxes, job-killing regulation."		Agency: "How much trouble is the economy in?"	DNC: "4.6% GDP."		Agency: "Um, yeah, we're gonna need more money..." https://t.co/g1VbE2ibEP
Obama infamously stated that manufacturing jobs were "never coming back" and that Trump must have some sort of "magic wand" if he thought they were. :-)		#MagicWandDoctrine https://t.co/jb9SzAdVBE

The most significant result of the Mueller Investigation so far is getting McCabe and Strzock fired and Brennan's security clearance pulled.		Huh.  makes you wonder.
Wow, so George Papadopoulos got 14 days in jail?  Really?  Sometimes I think the Mueller Investigation is TRYING to look like a waste of time.
We are so lucky to be Obama free https://t.co/JLiPM6FkTi
You've heard the old expression, "If it ain't broke don't fix it?"  America was broke and Trump is fixing it! #TaxReform2 https://t.co/HcGFiA0H4b
I hear Obama is taking credit for Trump's booming economy.  Pretty ridiculous considering Trump wiped out 800+ Obama-era regulations, passed massive tax reform and is fixing trade while creating 100's of thousands of manufacturing jobs - none things Obama did! https://t.co/xAlH4PUPcu
The Trump economy is ON FIRE!  Jobs are surging and wages are rising.  Amazing!  Thank #TaxReform! https://t.co/0apzmzGZqM
As crazy as Kamala and Booker were during the Kavanaugh hearings, leftwing groups and publications are excoriating them for "blowing it."  Perhaps they should have set a desk on fire to make these crazies happy? https://t.co/15WSD6XC6f

Folks, the Democrats are in trouble and they know it.  When you are confident and winning, you don't act like they did for the past 2 days at the Kavanaugh hearings.
I'm reading that leading GOP Congressmen are going to President Trump tomorrow and asking him to declassify Russiagate documents!  Oh boy, it's about to get good!
Now that Americans have experienced the taste of real prosperity and independence from government under Trump, they won't be going back to the Democrats in November! https://t.co/YoLls4RYvr
Does anyone really believe Americans will vote to give back the tax cuts they have received and the jobs those tax cuts created by putting Democrats back in power?  It is preposterous!
I just can't watch these Kavanaugh Hearings and believe the Democrats actually want to take back the House and the Senate.  What a clown show! https://t.co/9cLDXjpT17

Keep this in mind about media pollsters.  The fact someone was "accurate" on 11/8/16 does NOT mean they are accurate 2 months before the midterms.  ALL of these pollsters are in full-blown propaganda mode right now.		IBD claims only 33% of Ind's support Trump.  BS.

I've watched politics for many years and I've known many Democrats.  I have never seen their party lurch this far left before.  Their Trump Derangement Syndrome is so strong they've lost all perspective and are doomed to the dustbin of political history.
For Democrats, "respect" means doing everything they want without question - absolute and complete obedience is all they will accept.		Soooo, no respect..

This is what amazes me so much about President Trump.  No matter what happens, no matter how seemingly bad at the moment, it always turns into a win for him!
By making the midterms about impeachment, Democrats are turning 2018 into 2016 all over again - and we know what happened then!
I honestly cannot believe it.  Democrats are actually falling for the #ImpeachmentTrap!  Are they TRYING to give Republicans a reason to vote in November?
The #media simply does not want to talk about the Trump economic miracle brought on by the taxcuts!
Brett Kavanaugh is looking more and more likely to be confirmed before the midterms, give originalists a 5:4 advantage for a long long time!
The Democrats are now in an "impeachment trap."  If they run on impeaching Trump, they motivate Republicans.  If they don¬ít they turn off Democrats.
So far, Mueller, who was appointed to find Russian Collusion in the Trump Campaign has found only bank and tax fraud having nothing to do with Trump or Russia!
President Trump is against the practice of "flipping" the accused in plea deals to secure evidence on "bigger fish."  The system motivates the flipper to lie to reduce their sentence.
RT @JFNYC1: With all what's going on, if elections is today, would you vote for @realDonaldTrump?		I vote YES		Please vote and Retweet.
The Democrats have no agenda.  Their only hope to beat Trump is to take him down personally, but with the great economy?  Impossible.
Trump has cornered the Democrats into an impeachment trap.  If they run on impeaching Trump they lose.  If they don¬ít their base is outraged.
The Cohen and Manafort cases have NOTHING to do with Russia.  Mueller is out of ammunition.  Time to wrap up the witch hunt!
My heart breaks for young Mollie Tibbets, her life stolen by an illegal alien.  Build that wall and stop this travesty!
It really is hard to believe the Democrats believe a plea deal from Cohen someone puts Trump in jeopardy of impeachments.  Plea deals aren't evidence.

Nothing the Media has breathlessly warned us about regarding Trump for the past 3 years has happened.  Nothing.
President Trump is daring Brennan to sue him over his lost security clearance because he knows all of Brennan's emails and communique would then be open to discovery.
John Brennan once voted for an avowed Communist.  He never should have been CIA Director and was a miserable failure as such.
The Obama Admin sought to scrub security clearances in 2013 and the media didn't care.
President Trump is calling out "security clearance profiteers" like Brennan.  No more like his ilk make $ off the misplaced trust of the America people!
Stay tuned to my Twitter feed for the latest on #TaxReform.  I'm in DC weekly negotiating with Congress to pass the laws to put more money into YOUR pocket!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming and it's going to be AWESOME!  The economy is already running on all cylinders and is about to get a nitrous injection to really roar!
The latest Media meme is a return to the old tired meme that Trump is somehow unhinged and unfit for office - this while he achieves record results daily.
If a #BlueWave is building, why is DNC fundraising so horrifically bad?  They have almost nothing to go up against the Republican juggernaut in November!
Republicans continue to shatter fundraising records, now over $100 million ahead of the Democrats raising more than 2010 and 2014 combined!

Top Senate Investigator: After 19 Months, Still No Evidence of Trump-Russia Collusion - OF COURSE NOT.
Personal savings are soaring in the Trump Economy.  Another factor economists assured us would never happen.
Economists, who exist only to make weathermen look accurate, consider the Trump boom a mere "blip."  These fools are always wrong.
President Trump is coming out hard against social media censorship, says he will not allow it to continue.  Wow, popcorn, this should be interesting.
It has been learned that the White House Legal Team has been cooperating fully with the Mueller Team.  Of course, Trump is innocent.  They have nothing to hide.
Under President Trump's leadership, youth unemployment has reached a 50 year low!  Incredible.  These are kids working, learning real skills and staying out of trouble!
INCREDIBLE - CNN is being accused of attempting to intimidate the Paul Manafort jury after the far-left cable channel (and six other anti-Trump outlets) requested the jurors¬í names and home addresses.
A top security clearance is a privilege, not a right, and a privilege seditious John Brennan has forfeited.
John Brennan has lost his mind.  The horrible thing he says about our President and yet he expects to retain his security clearance?

The Democrats have NO ANSWER for the massive Trump rallies.  They don't even try because they know no one would come.
Democrats are saying Trump denied Brennan his 1st Amendment rights by stripping his security clearance?  Lol, do they even know what the 1st Amendment is?
John Brennan is SURE Trump colluded with Russia?  What does he know Mueller doesn't?  Answer, nothing.
I'm back in DC working on Tax Reform 2.0!  Good things coming.  Stay tuned!

The Trump Campaign is suing Omarosa for millions as a result of her breaking her NDA.  She is in for a world of financial hurt.
Is CNN actually embracing violent hate group #Antifa?  Incredible.  They've lost their minds.
Trump's #TradeWar with China is weakening their economy but NOT ours. This is putting pressure on China's President XI to negotiate a deal with Trump.  Brilliant!
According to a new Rasmussen Poll, support for President Trump among black voters has hit a record 31%!  Oh man, not good news for the Democrats.
@TaxReformExpert is a voice for #accountingtoday - more to come
Thank God, the Democrats ran Hillary Clinton, the worst candidate in history.  She never had a chance.
Democrats are not for liberty.  They are for license to steal your liberty.
The more you become dependent upon the government, the more government gets to dictate terms.  You lose your freedom.
Socialism is slavery.
It is hard to believe that given the absolute success of Trumps' brand of nationalist capitalism, one of our two major parties would be campaigning for Socialism.
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming and it's going to be awesome.  Stay tuned for more!
Why have no Democrat Leaders loudly disavowed this weekend's #Antifa riots?
The #Antifa protests are driving the middle away from the Democrat Party.
Omarosa is making a complete fool of herself.  It's embarrassing.
A new Gallup poll reveals that Democrats now favor Socialism above Capitalism, DESPITE Trump's amazing 4.1% GDP Economy.
The key to Republican victory in 2018 will be turnout.  Trump has all the tools to make Republican turnout soar.
I talk to liberals and I just don't get it.  90% of the things they hate about Trump are pure fiction, and yet create the entire premise for their false position.
Liberals compromise about 20% of the electorate.  How can Democrats take back Congress appealing to only 20% of voters?
I don't recall any time in history the Democrats have run this unabashedly left. I don't see how this can be a winning strategy.
Is Nancy Pelosi toxic?  Yes.  So what better person to lead a toxic party like the #Democrats?
While the #Media constantly frets over "potential violence" from Trump supporters, left-wing #Antifa commits real violence every day.
The Democrat's once formidable lead in the Generic Preference For Congress Poll has collapsed in the past week.  Voters are starting to pay attention and don't like what they see from D.
If you're a small business person, plan your taxes like you expect to be a big business person.  Plan for the future the future will plan for you!
President Trump's economic success is directly tied to his dramatic tax reform.  More money in businesses pockets, more gas for the economic engine!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming soon.  It will fix what was broken in 1.0, make the best parts permanent and add great new ways for businesses and individuals to save on taxes!
@TaxReformExpert - here is the latest #taxalert on the proposed Sec 199A Regs	https://t.co/itguz72et3
Despite promises by "experts" to the contrary, Trump's #TradeWar is resulting in FEWER layoffs and LOWER inflation!
Chinese President Xi Jinping is facing backlash from within the Communist Party over his hardline stance in the trade dispute with the United States.  #Winning
President Trump's increased border enforcement caused the number of unaccompanied minors crossing to drop by 23% in July!  That is a HUGE savings to the American taxpayer!
I look at the heroes of the Left and I just shake my head.  These are not the people America wants to emulate.
The Democrats lead in the generic ballot has all but evaporated in the past week.  What happened?  It's late Summer, people are starting to pay closer attention.
If you're a small business owner or wealthy individual looking for ways to save on your taxes you never imagined possible, follow my feed.  You may be surprised what you learn!
President Trump has results on his side and at the end of the day, nothing succeeds like success!
It is simply remarkable that social media giants and service providers are banning Conservative commentators for "hate speech" but refusing to say what the hate speech was?
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming folks!  Will have many great features to make businesses and individual more prosperous!
The turnout numbers for Democrats in these Special Elections is very odd.  Over 90% of Presidential GE numbers?  Really?  Not sure that is possible.
2 years after Americans elected President Trump to make America great again, will they give power back to the Democrats to destroy America? No.
President Trump has exposed the Democrats for what they are - Communists.  Remember when they used to run as moderates?
@realDonaldTrump ... no former political experience,  no problem! Tax reform ‚úÖ... international safety ‚úÖ... immigration reform ‚úÖ... well done Mr. President!
Can the Democrat Party win the midterms running against everything America stands for?  I don't think so.
The 1st Amendment is the FIRST amendment because it was the most important one.  Democrats are now open calling for its abolishment.
So Democrats are now openly calling for the banning of Conservative Media in order to "protect democracy?"  I'm sorry, WAT?!
@TaxReformExpert spends the morning with top CPA partner discussing Qualified Opportunity Funds #RealEstate #TaxReform #politics #law #costsegregation #Government

The garbage part-time jobs Obama created were not like the high quality full-time careers Trump is creating.

We are about to find out if the Democrats can take back Congress with no agenda during one of the best economies in US history.
Retweet if you believe Donald Trump will go down as the greatest economic President in history!
Despite 92% negative media coverage, President Trump has been wildly successful.
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming!  We are making the good things permanent, fixing the just ok things and adding new exciting things everyone will love!
The remarkable Trump economy is tied directly to the success of Tax Reform.  The Democrats will never admit the truth!
I don¬ít understand social media's plan here.  Their censorship will piss off the Republican base and alienate the entire middle.  It's nuts!

So Hollywood is going to band together and protest Trump?  Oh no.  I'm sure they will be as effective as they were in preventing his election.
Right now, the Democrats may have the least popular agenda in the history of American politics.  Voters are often 2:1 against or worse!
Election after election the #Media is left wringing their hands asking, how could the polls get it so wrong?  You'd think by now they'd be shocked if polls got it right!
Trust polls?  Polls have the Democrat in TN leading the race by 5 when Republican Primary voters outnumbered Democrats 2:1.  So no, I don¬ít trust polls.
I keep reading about how President Trump's support among Democrat constituencies is soaring, but I never read about Republican constituencies going Democrat?
Democrats aren't giving rallies because they'd have to brag about their policies, of which they have none!
President Trump is giving speeches before rallies of 10's thousands.  Democrats have no answer for that!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming and its full of prosperity for US taxpayers and businesses.  The boom economy has only just begun!
Turnout in TN last night was amazing for Republicans, literally doubling the Democrat turnout.  The #RedTsunami is real!
Black support for President Trump has jumped to 29% from 15% in just a year. Incredible. This changes everything!
The #TrumpTrain has FAR more Twitter users with over 100,000 followers than the Left.  No wonder they want to limit our voice!
No one ever paid a Trump supporter to go to a rally.  On the other hand, most of the Democrat protests you see are just paid Soros lackeys.
For some reason I doubt Democrats will be giving massive rallies like Trump.  Maybe just protests where they use paid miscreants to break and burn things.
As the midterms approach, President Trump will shift into pure campaign mode.  Like his massive rally in Tampa, the energy will be infectious.
As we look at 4.1% GDP, narrowing trade deficits and improved prospects for peace abroad, the Democrat calls for impeachment seem sillier by the day.

So many of the millennials living in their parent's basements who wanted #Socialism are now getting good jobs.  I have a feeling their motivations are changing.
Now that #Capitalism is working so well for America, WHY would voters choose #Socialism?
I still cannot believe the Democrats are actually openly running on a #Socialist platform.  What kind of crazy polling told them THAT was popular?

President Trump @realDonaldTrump would like to reduce capital gain taxes by inflationary measures. @larry_kudlow has been advocating for this and the administration may have found the a legal process to get it done without the need for it to pass Congress and Senate. Stay tuned
Every single Democrat issue is polling 2:1 against.  I just don¬ít see how they have any shot.
I'd hate to be the Democrats 2018 advertising firm.  What can they talk about?
Democrats have very little money to spend on midterm races.  Republicans are so flush, they are sending $8 million to CA!
If the Democrats are going to win a #BlueWave, why didn't they outvote a single Republican in the CA primaries?
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming!  We're gonna add new things,  fix things that needed fixing and make things permanent that were temporary!

Tax Reform 2.0 is coming and it's going to be AWESOME!
Trump is about to come at the Democrats from 8 different directions as the midterms approach.  Popcorn!

Prepare for the SHOCKED FACES on CNN and MSNBC as the election returns roll in on November 6th, 2018.
After the past 18 months of prosperity, do the Democrats actually think America will vote for gridlock and impeachment hearings?
Sorry Democrats, America is not going to vote for higher taxes.
The night before the 2016 elections, every top #Media publication gave Trump a less than 10% chance of victory.  Missed it by THAT much.
Democrats are claiming they have "newfound momentum" for the midterms.  No they don't.
Tax reform 2.0 is essential to keeping the economy strong. Tax reform should NOT happen every 30 years... https://t.co/mlzHpbzpfi
Democrats are actually running on open borders and higher taxes.  I still can't believe it.
Now that Americans have gotten used to having that extra money in their pockets from tax cuts, they won't vote to give it back in November.
I work with the wealthiest and the smartest every day for a living.  President Trump impresses me as one of the greatest minds I've ever encountered.
President Trump's strong GDP performance will only improve as his tough stance on trade fixes decade long imbalances and unfairness.
Trump's 4.1% GDP isn't amazing just because of it's size (anyone can have a good quarter) but because of its sustainability.
As divided as the Republican Congress has been, it is almost miraculous they've been so successful on tax reform!
Tax Reform 2.0 is on it's way.  We're making the best stuff permanent and the good stuff better!
Elizabeth Warren said she wants a tax plan based not upon "numbers," but "values."  I have news for her.  They count taxes in numbers.
President Trump is brilliant!  He has actually maneuvered the Democrats into running AGAINST peace and prosperity!
To hear Democrats talk, they almost seem to want WW3 with Russia.  Does peace and prosperity scare them that much?

With Trump winning on trade, jobs, taxes and foreign affairs, I honestly don¬ít know what the Democrats can do in the midterms.
Tax Reform used to pass once in a generation.  Now, in less than a year, we are preparing to improve our tax laws yet again!
I feel so grateful to have been able to go to DC and work firsthand with our lawmakers getting Tax Reform passed.  It really is whole new way of doing things!
Tax reform 2.0 is coming!  More money in your pocket.  More money for employers so the can hire you and give you a raise.  Exciting times!

Like Tax Reform, Tariffs can being changed, tweaked as makes best sense for the country. @realDonaldTrump President Trump has shown that none of his moves are static. He is already working on Tax Reform 2.0. He also feels that Tax Reform does not need to change  every 30 years.

The rumors of a strong GDP number are swirling.  We'll see.  The economy is STRONG!
Larry Sabato, who predicted a BIG Hillary win the night of the 2016 election, is now predicting the Democrats will win back the House.  Um, not worried.
Elizabeth Warren gave an interview about repealing the Trump tax cuts.  This woman is dangerously ignorant of even basic economic theory.
In addition to making permanent individual and business tax cuts, Tax Reform 2.0 provides additional ways for start-up businesses to reduce their tax burden!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming and it looks exciting!  We make permanent many of the individual and business tax cuts from the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act!"

I'm sorry, but this #AbolishICE thing by Democrats is just so so so dumb.  #ICE has 84% approval!
Does James Comey really think America cares what he thinks?  He sure seems to.
A new study has come out and EVERYONE is winning from #TaxReform!  Thanks so much to everyone who helped us a fight for a great plan!  You did this!
The fact Trump's approval rating ROSE following his meetings with Putin proves that America trusts Trump to lead us to world peace through strength!
The Democrats are in THIS bad of shape with the 24/7 promotion by the sycophantic media.  Can you imagine if the media supported Trump?
From Global Warming to Elections, have you noticed how infrequently things turn out as Democrats predict they will?
The most delicious part of 11/6 will be watching the Democrats fight amongst themselves on 11/7, blaming each other for their midterm losses when they were supposed to win.
As expected, the Democrat Party is now splintering between those who would take it far far left and the more moderate wing.  They are a house divided against themselves.
Most of our laws, trade agreements, etc... are outdated and need to be reformed.		Instead of expending energy on attacking Potus, pressure your representatives to put their re-election strategy aside and get to work on behalf of you. 		We should only elect those who work!
.@realDonaldTrump has proven himself to be a very strong leader and negotiator on the national and international stage.		If you aren‚Äôt taking him seriously, you are in for a big surprise.

It really is hard for Democrats to sell the whole "traitor" meme when America is thriving.  I mean, would a traitor make America great again?
The latest polling says that of all the issues facing American voters, Russia ranks at or near the bottom - and yet, Democrats obsess over it daily.
Of course the Democrats want WW3 with Russia.  Only with choas and suffering can they ever rule again.
Hillary Clinton sold Russia 20% of our Uranium reserves, then received millions to her Foundation.  The Democrats and Media never batted and eye and still don't care.
Rachel Maddow says she senses Trump is a foreign agent.  Lol, I wonder which part tipped her off - the record economy, record low unemployment or record consumer confidence?

What the Republicans are getting ready to do to Democrats in the midterms could easily be described as "running up the score."
How can the Democrats compete in November?  Republicans are fielding the biggest GOTV organization in their history while Democrats borrow just to remain alive.
The economy is cooking on all cylinders and about to get even stronger and we have the Trump tax cuts to thank!
Once Kavanaugh is confirmed, I believe you'll see other Liberal SCOTUS Judges consider retirement as their vote no longer carries the weight it did.
Congratulations to Charlotte, NC for being chosen as the home for the 2020 Republican Convention!  Beautiful city.  Way to go!

Now that Americans have enjoyed their tax cuts for a year, does anyone think a majority will vote to GIVE THE MONEY BACK in November?  Hell no!
In a new poll, the LEAST IMPORTANT ISSUE for voters in the midterms?  Russia.  Yep.  The Democrats #1 obsession and no one cares.
The US economy is already firing on all cylinders and Tax Reform 2.0 is yet to even be announced.  Wow, this is going to be amazing!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming soon and it's going to be amazing!
You ask a Liberal why they dislike Trump and you get a list of reasons that sound like they came from an SNL skit, and they probably did!
Of course President Trump didn¬ít want to humiliate Putin on the world stage in Helsinki.  He has just negotiating a fragile peace deal for the Middle East!
President Trump just announced a major deal with Russia to pull back Iranian Troops in Syria which would have been a major threat to Israel.  Media too busy calling Trump "traitor!" to notice.

The more the #Media overreacts to Trump, the further he throws them.  It's #PoliticalJudo.
Today, Democrats actually equated President Trump's Helsinki News Conference with Pearl Harbor.  Incredible.
Hillary Clinton sold 20% of America's Uranium Reserves to Russia and no one in the #Media shouted traitor!
Liberals seek complete control over your life because they know without that, you'd never accept their crazy ideas.
The Democrats don¬ít want higher tax rates to raise more money.  They want higher tax rates so they can decide who the winners and the losers will be.
The Democrats don¬ít want to solve problems.  They thrive on suffering.  Why would they want to solve problems?
The Democrats don't want peace.  They thrive on suffering.  Why would they want peace?
President Trump is seeking to heal our long-term relationship with Russia rather than score momentary political points that just make things worse.
We should take an office pool on what the Democrats new outrage will be next week.  I can't keep track!
The Media, Democrats and NeverTrump are in full meltdown.  So what else is new?

The Democrats want to turn the USA into London.  Didn't we fight a war to prevent that?
The #TrumpTariff's were supposed to cause an instant recession.  GDP is now estimated at 4.5%!
Tax Reform was supposed to explode the deficit.  But revenues have been running at a record pace!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming soon!  Get ready.  Even more money in the pockets of small businesses and individual taxpayers!
The Democrats plan to win the midterms?  Run Nancy Pelosi, the least popular politician in America, as Speaker.
Sometimes I worry, are Democrats just pretending to be unbelievably stupid to throw us off the scent?  I mean, no one can actually be this dumb, can they?
The Democrats plan to abolish ICE is a gift to Republicans.
Just to be clear, the latest Mueller "indictments" say nothing about Trump's involvement with Russian agents seeking to "hack" the DNC's server.
The #Media wants to cancel Trump's meeting with Putin or at least send a "chaperone" with him.  Who should we send, John Podesta, who thought p@ssword was a good password?
So, Democrats want us to put the party in charge of our national security that used p@ssword as their password?  That's d@mb.
There is no way Democrats return to power in the #Midterms.  Their entire platform reads like a laundry list of everything America hates!
Spoke on Tax Reform today at St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. Fortune 500 Executives reported to me increased salaries... more crumbs... for their employees...great city https://t.co/V1VziQKifF

President Trump is standing up to May on Brexit.  If she gives into the EU, no sweet trade deal with the US.  Trump is tough.  I love it!

For the first time in decades, we have a President willing to stand up to our allies and demand #AmericaFirst.  It's thrilling!
No matter what the polls say now, come November, Americans will vote their wallets.  They always do.
In every sector across America, there is record optimism about the economy and direction of the country under Republican rule.  A #BlueWave?  Don¬ít think so.
The Democrats are actually running on raising your taxes.  Incredible.  Who votes for having LESS money?
Tax Reform 2.0 is going to be a huge win for the American taxpayer.  Coming soon!
Think about it.  The average pollster uses only a 24% Republican sample in their poll.  Republicans control EVERYTHING with just 24%.  Amazing!
President Trump now enjoys 85% approval from Republicans!  His overall poll numbers would be higher if pollsters didn't assume America is only 24% Republican.
When #PeterStrzock described himself as an angel, I don't think he meant the good kind.
Strzock implied his deep hatred of Trump was "out of extreme patriotism," and yet, he was unbiased?  WAT?!
Wow, the #PeterStrzock testimony today was incredibly contentious.  Strzock himself told some real whoppers.  He must have practiced keeping a straight face in front of the mirror.
House Democrats have introduced a bill to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).		As an Hispanic, the message they are sending me is that they want to make America unsafer.

President Trump has an excellent knack for seeing his enemies' greatest weakness and his supporters' greatest desire.
I am constantly amazed by President Trump's energy. He is the hardest working, clearest thinking man I've ever met!
If Democrats spent more time leading and less time resisting, maybe they wouldn't have to spend so much time resisting?
After a year and a half of the Mueller Investigation turning up NOTHING on Trump, Democrats claim Trump picked Kavanaugh to keep him out of prison.  Incredible.
Democrat Senators running for re-election in red states will be under tremendous pressure to confirm Kavanaugh.
Could we end up with a 7-2 Conservative Court by the end of Trump's second term?  Pretty likely.
If Liberals are this upset about the appointment of Kavanaugh to SCOTUS, how will they react when Trump appoints 2 more Conservative Judges in the next 6 years?
Hollywood will have as much success stopping the confirmation of Kavanaugh to SCOTUS as they had preventing Donald Trump from becoming President.
Democrats keep calling President Trump a dictator.  Considering they always lose to him, I can see why they might think that. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Winning
The more Liberals scream and shout about Kavanaugh, the bigger they'll lose in November.  And they still won't be able to stop his confirmation.
Minorities benefiting from Tax Reform. Good Tax Reform does not discriminate anyone!!!! https://t.co/glwEpyGXzn
Thank you to all the brave Americans who defied the #Media machine and elected President Trump.  You made the right call!
Humans are so fragile, every day is a gift.  Do something amazing with today!

Recent estimates of GDP growth are between 4.5 and 5.3%!  When you consider how large the US economy already is, that is remarkable!
The US economy is running on all cylinders and we haven't even passed Tax Reform 2.0 yet!  Let's light this candle!
Tax Reform 2.0 is right around the corner.  I've been in DC weekly working with Congress on it.  It will be amazing!  Stay tuned!
Is Hillary Clinton really thinking of running again in 2020?  And we thought #SpeakerPelosi was a gift!
When you look at the dramatic effect Trump's SCOTUS picks will have upon America's future, you begin to see why the Democrats were so desperate to impeach over #Russiagate!
We are looking at the serious prospect of a Conservative Supreme Court for a generation and there is nothing the Democrats can do to stop it!
President Trump's pick for SCOTUS coming soon.  There is an excellent change he will get two more picks within the next 6 years as well!
Tax reform 2.0 is coming and it¬ís going to be AMAZING.  Stay tuned, big news soon will put more money in your pocket!
The message of 2016 was simple - America wants #AmericaFirst results.  The #Democrats #AmericaLast agenda is doomed to failure.  It is tone deaf in the extreme!
Because Progressivism is the core truth of #Democrats, they experience extreme confirmation bias when evaluating evidence.  This leads them to often misread clear signals the electorate is sending.
President Trump has taken away the #Democrats ability to campaign as moderates.  I believe they have made the choice their only hope is to now become fully #Socialist.  Foolish.
Illegal Immigration is now the top issue for midterm voters even ahead of the economy.  Democrat's #OpenBorders policies are opposed by nearly 80% of voters! What are they doing?!
It is also a vote for Tax Reform repeal (no crumbs), a vote for a world without safety first and a vote for high regulation and handouts. https://t.co/P41v9gXNqF

Democrats are so obsessed with resisting Trump they have moved further left than any time in their history.  I was shocked to hear the Head of the DNC declare them to be a #SocialistParty!
Facebook has apologized to a Texas newspaper after flagging a post containing text from the Declaration of Independence as ¬ìhate speech.¬î  Lol, too late Zuckerberg.  That horse is out of the barn!
The Democrat Leadership has walked away from the moderate wing of their base in their #AbolishICE platform.  This spells doom in November for the #BlueWave!
With regards to immigration enforcement, GOP voters were largely unmoved: 15 percent said ¬ìtoo aggressive¬î and 70 percent said ¬ìnot aggressive enough.¬î  So while Democrats are divided on this issue, Republicans are united.
"Similarly, only 22 percent of African-Americans want to get rid of ICE, while 56 percent oppose getting rid of ICE. "  This is a HUGE problem for Democrats as they need high Black turnout in November!
"Just 20 percent of swing-voters and 18 percent of Republicans support getting rid of the ICE agency."  This is a BIG problem for Democrats in November as the nominate #AbolishICE candidates.
Here's the problem with the Democrat's #AbolishICE movement.  It is causing Liberal Democrats to nominate those who support it, but will then lose badly in November because America supports ICE.
Yes...God Bless America for all the opportunities it provides to its people https://t.co/JdB8n9PBZ8

Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) really has driven the Left mad.  They are no longer behaving as a rational organization.

As a business owner, I can see the results @realDonaldTrump is delivering for the American People. 		The media is doing the American People and the business community a disservice by not highlighting his successes.		In business, it‚Äôs all about converting ideas into results.
Democrats are running on empty. They have no agenda, no ideas and soon, no voters.  The #WalkAway movement is gathering steam as traditional Democrat voters abandon their radical message.
President Trump to speak Sunday morning on Tax Reform 2.0! Making the tax rates permanent will be key ... as repealing permanent tax rates would take a Democratic President, House and Senate.

President Trump is making great inroads with young Americans.  He just said, "There has never been a better time to be young and American!"

TaxReform 2.0 is going to be amazing!  Stay tuned.  I will be appearing on YourVoice America soon to talk about it!
The Left is losing their minds over the prospect of President Trump replacing Justice Kennedy with a strong Conservative.  Oh well, winners make the rules.
Why would an Hispanic citizen of the USA who played by the rules and did it the "right" way support these "line-cutters" invading from our southern borders?
Legal Hispanics don't want illegals here either.  They bring drugs, crime and disease to their communities, also lowering wages and increasing unemployment!
As President Trump takes a strong Constitutional stand on border enforcement, his approval among Hispanic voters is SPIKING by 10%!!! Amazing!

I feel much safer in New York City ever since @realDonaldTrump President Trump was elected. He makes the whole world safer. https://t.co/tso4T7Pble
In a new poll, only 40% of voters wish Hillary had been elected instead!  Wow, we are rollin!
Do the Democrats have an actual agenda beyond hating Trump and identity politics?  51% of voters in a new poll say NO!
It's funny that Democrats claim the support of Millennials, and yet their leadership team is the oldest and most out of touch!
The Democrats are calling Barack Obama back onto the campaign trail for the midterms.  In their own words, "There's no one else!"
Did the Democrats REALLY pick Nancy Pelosi to be their franchise quarterback?  Wow.  How empty must their bench be?!
Large majorities even from liberal pollsters are now saying the American people oppose Democrats on the key issues of immigration and the economy!
The Media hates talking about how great the Trump economy is.  They'd rather talk about ANYTHING else.  But the American people feel the difference in their wallets.  They know.
I'll be on YourVoice¬ô America next week to discuss TaxReform 2.0.  Will be an amazing show!  Make sure you watch!
If I didn't know better, I would think the Democrats were TRYING to lose.  They are running on raising taxes and open borders?  America HATES that stuff!
The Democrats have completely lost the narrative for the midterms, running further left than any party in the history of the midterms!
In NYC influencing Tax Reform 2.0 today. We need permanent tax cuts... https://t.co/rnZ5gpi7QB
Who can argue we are witnessing greatness https://t.co/dtAclVxC3r
Charlie is right here!!! https://t.co/7qiQIt4ZKI
The Economy is booming yet the Democrats want to undo it all come November... Tax repeal is at the top of their agenda     https://t.co/9AiTWM2lgq
Our economy is in amazing shape and getting stronger by the day.  The Media wants to talk about anything BUT the economy, but the people notice.
Retweet if you want America to send illegals back home immediately at the border!
President Trump is recommending that instead of holding illegals at the border and going through all these judges and hearings, we just turn them around and send them home immediately!
Veteran filmmaker David Lynch believes President Donald Trump could be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in American history because of the way he has shaken up the political establishment.
Maxine Waters is openly calling for people to publicly harass Trump Admin Staff?  Are you kidding me?  This woman has lost her mind!
Peter Strzock has been subpoenaed to appear before Judiciary and Oversight Committees next week.  This should be interesting
By taking the middle on immigration, Trump has forced Democrats so far Left they are about to fall off their flat Earth!
If the 2018 midterms are a referendum on government corruption, Republicans will win going away.  The Democrat #DeepState is as corrupt as it gets!
Pretty much every economic expert predicted doom when President Trump announced his tariffs.  And now, German Automakers are asking the EU to end ALL auto tariffs! #Winning!
A restaurant owner refused to serve White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders because of her affiliation with Trump.  If that had happened to a Liberal, they'd be marching with torches!
President Trump has the Midterms all planned out and will surge into the close.  Democrats have NO chance.
At this point, the #Media has completely lost the narrative.  They are simply flailing and hoping just one lie, any lie, finally sticks.
I read today a Liberal saying that the Trump #TaxCuts are costing the Treasury a fortune in income.  The TRUTH is we have seen record revenue increases, not decreases!
The Democrats are really promoting Nancy Pelosi as the next Speaker should they win the House?  Are they trying to lose?
A new poll shows that 64% of Americans want illegals detained at the border.  Mystery as to why Democrats are running on this.
Have you noticed more money in your paycheck since tax reform passed?
I keep hearing that Democrats lead the generic ballot.  It seems impossible to believe.  Their agenda is 100% anti-American!
The more you win, the more you win.  It's all about momentum and right now, Republicans have ALL the momentum.
Trump has all the results and the policies Democrats are proposing are VERY unpopular.  Oh yeah, and they're broke.  I can't see how they win in November.
Obama said ISIS wasn't leaving and manufacturing jobs were never coming back.  ISIS left and manufacturing is coming back!
It is estimated the Trump econmy will grow at 4.8% this quarter.  Obama could never have dreamed of these numbers!
We are working on #TaxReform 2.0.  It's gonna be great!
President Trump has a new #ZeroTolerance policy.  Democrats have a #ZeroEnforcement policy.  Incredible.
It was bad enough Democrats were running on raising your taxes.  Now they want to run on #OpenBorders and #CatchAndRelease?
A new poll shows that Americans oppose Democrat's new favorite program, #CatchAndRelease by 3:1.  WHY are they pushing this?

Wouldn't that be great if we can get wall-funding and healthcare reform done before the Midterms?
Has everyone noticed a change in their finances as a result of tax reform?  Does it feel like you have more money at the end of the month or can afford nicer things?
Who ever thought Democrats would suddenly become the Party of Family Values overnight?  Lol, this won't last.  It's not who they are.
The Trump economy is so strong, the biggest risk now is actually overheating and growing too fast.  Wow, that's the kind of problems we want to have!
Liberals want handouts for the Legals and Illegals. What happened to hard work and doing it the right way? Retweet if you stand for conservatism and @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/2r5d08Hth9

Only 13% of Democrats are satisfied with the direction of the country despite record low unemployment for women and blacks.  Hmmmm.
The % of Americans satisfied with the direction of the nation is hitting record highs under President Trump's leadership.  Amazing!
President Trump is enforcing our borders.  Sorry Liberals.  Cry all you want.  That isn't changing.
The children who are "being separated" from their illegal parents at the border are being cared for far better than they are used to back home!
President Trump is following the law to the letter at the border.  The Left is just grandstanding, but America hates illegal immigration.  This is a losing message for them.
Can you imagine the Media if Obama were President with Trump's economy?  They'd be calling for ticker-tape parades!
Again, I wanted to reach out to every American who lobbied their Congressmen hard to make #TaxReform a reality and the miracle that it has been!
Can you believe that Democrats actually don¬ít want us to have borders?  To let ANYONE come here and live off the taxpayers as they please?  These people are NUTS!
Like every other #FakeNews story, the whole meme that President Trump is somehow holding illegals in concentration camps will fade in the light of day.  We must have borders!
Us Taxpayers spend $35,000 a year on each illegal alien child that comes to America.  That is dramatically more than impoverished kids who are US Citizens live on!
Happy Father Day to all my amazing friends
Build the Wall.. Pass Tax Teform 2.0 for a successful midterms https://t.co/b3xJRFAkWd
MAGA strong and with our President https://t.co/kmLWCyliAa
Retweet if you believe America is the greatest nation on earth and getting better and stronger every day!
America is experiencing record enthusiasm from consumers and businesses.  Yet all Democrats can do is complain.
Hire a great tax accountant and make sure you don¬ít pay one cent more to Uncle Sam than is required.  It will pay for itself in no time!
Having been actively involved in crafting Tax Reform 1.0, it is a thrill to see what a difference it has made in our economy!  Tax Reform 2.0 is on the way!
The Democrats have clearly lost their minds.  They are now accusing President Trump of setting up concentration camps for illegal kids and claim he's coming for YOUR kids next!
President Trump is building a sustainable economy that will be strong for the next decade easily.  It is amazing to watch.  Even hardened economists are astounded!
The most amazing thing about this economy is there is no one asset or employment class driving it.  The gains are broad and deep. Remarkable.
I'm proud to be an American today more than ever.  President Trump is making this nation greater than it has ever been.
No wonder our trading partners are scared.  Trump is making the US full self-sufficient and self-sustaining.  They better cut a deal with us while they can!
Tax Reform 2.0 is coming along nicely!  It's really hard to even guess how strong this economy can become!
How can Democrats compete in November?  The RNC has all the money, all the results and all the agenda.  This is Trump's Party now!
If you vote for a Democrat in November, you are voting to roll back the Trump tax cuts, stop our 4.8% economy and have endless impeachment hearings for the next 2 years.  DON¬íT DO IT!
Yesterday we learned retail sales numbers were DOUBLE what was expected.  Record lows for unemployment.  Rising wages.  How can ANYONE vote for a Democrat in November?
J.P. Morgan economists see the economy growing at four percent for the quarter. Macroeconomic Advisers forecast 4.4 percent. The Atlanta Fed¬ís GDPNow forecast hit 4.8 percent Thursday!
The OIG Report was a DISASTER for Comey, Strzock and #DeepState.  The FBI itself must be preserved and saved, but these corrupt men must face justice!
Based upon primary voting over the past month, can anyone point me to Democrat enthusiasm that would indicate a coming #BlueWave?
North Korea is just the beginning.  Going into the Midterms, we can get #TaxReform 2.0 done, wall funding and healthcare reform.  The Democrats have nothing.
I never believed I'd see the day when Democrats were openly rooting for a Recession to take down Trump, but they're doing it.  Sad.
Stocks are up 40% during the President's tenure thus far and I promise you, #TaxReform is the #1 driver behind that!
The Media and NeverTrumpers are working overtime to denigrate and minimize President Trump's remarkable North Korea Peace Deal.  Let's stand with our President and show our support!
I'll be in DC often in the coming months lobbying for Tax Reform 2.0.  Cool stuff coming folks!  Stay tuned for the latest!
The Media's reaction to the Trump/Kim Summit is so predictable and annoying, it hurts to even watch it.  These losers have no new plays!
Now Trump has an amazing economy, tax reform and the potential for peace in Korea to run on for the 2018 midterms.  Democrats are finished!
No one on this planet knows more about closing a deal that Donald J Trump.  Why does he need the advice of "Korean experts" who have been wrong for decades?
President Trump's success with North Korea is nothing less than miraculous.  Of course, the #Media as one voice have declared it a complete disaster.
What a President.... https://t.co/irL9TbQ6Dh
Who is seeing more money in their paychecks thanks to @realDonaldTrump tax cuts?
At the G7, Trump called the EU's bluff by requesting that ALL nations drop ALL tariffs and protections.  No countries accepted.  Now they look silly complaining.
President Trump does not say to our enemies that for us to win, you must lose.  President Trump says, "We can all win together!"
For decades China has used North Korea as a club to bash the West over the head.  Those days of usefulness have come to an end.  If China wants peace in Korea, there will be peace.
President Trump understands that Kim wants to be an economic power and only Trump can make this happen.  That is Trump's lever that will eventually bring peace!
Retweet if you believe President Trump will be able to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula!
Retweet if you are PROUD that we have a President in @realDonaldTrump who is exhibiting leadership with our foreign allies.
Here we are just months from the most consequential midterms of our lives, and the Democrats still have no agenda or platform!
I'm curious as to what Nancy Pelosi's plan is to raise wages?  I mean, in 8 years, Obama didn't.  I'm serious, I'd love to hear the plan.
Did Nancy Pelosi actually say that low unemployment doesn't matter?  Really Nancy?  Please, NEVER retire!
Before President Trump, I always wondered what would happen if America elected a pragmatic, results-driven business person to run the country.  Now we know!
America is very well-managed under the leadership of President Trump.
Tax Reform 2.0 will be proof that Congress can make small improvements to the tax law every year instead of one huge change after being broken for decades.
John McCain.  I just don¬ít get him.
President Trump always knows where his leverage is.  He understands the strong US economy gives him power to make moves a weak economy would not.
Europe to Trump.  If you raise tariffs on us, we'll start a trade war!  Trump to Europe.  Go ahead.  You won't last a week.
President Trump suggested an end to all tariffs by all nations at the G7. I didn¬ít hear any takers.

Tax Reform is the engine that is driving this Trump economy.  Even more amazing times ahead!
Things are pretty great in this country.  Trump is delivering the promises he made.  Why would America now go back to the Obama days?
Even major utilities are now lowering their rates due to the Trump tax cuts.  Amazing!
If a #bluewave is coming, why are Republicans now 7 points more fired up to vote in the midterms than Democrats?
Every time we get a report of new record low jobless claims or high consumer confidence, the media "experts" are always surprised.
With each new censorship or shadow-ban, the social media giants move closer and closer to becoming regulated public utilities.  They brought this upon themselves.
I look at Primary results over the past month and I see NO indication that censorship by social media of the #Conservative message is helping Democrats, do you?
His leadership is amazing https://t.co/LFHumxujaJ
I am proud to be an American.  I am proud to be a Republican.  I am proud to be a Trump supporter!
If the Republican Congress can get wall funding and healthcare done before the midterms, Democrats will be in deep deep trouble.
Proud of Mitch McConnell for cancelling August recess to push through the Trump agenda!  Well done!
Tax Reform has been a miracle.  Thanks you to the brave men and women of the Republican Congress who pushed it through!
President Trump's economic policies are reducing the number of losers in this economy - bad news for Democrats who count on loser's votes to win!
The Trump base is getting fired up and turning out.  America does NOT want to give these economic gains back!
Democrats struggled in uber-blue California and we still haven't had the upcoming Hillary/Obama and #Deep State perp-walks yet!
Newsom is a slick looking uber-liberal that will destroy what is left of California's economy.  Go Cox!
Cox coming in second for Governor of CA will dramatically improve Republican turnout in November.
HUGE night for Republicans in CA last night.  On a day Democrats were supposed to show the first signs of a #blue wave, they didn't even challenge in red districts Hillary won!

We are at 3.8% unemployment, record low unemployment for blacks and estimated 4.8% GDP, yet Democrats have only hate for our President!
Democrats are actually blaming President Trump for high gas prices?  Gas prices are rising because the economy is so AWESOME!
Trump's 1st 500 days have been absolutely remarkable, and yet, the Democrats have nothing but hate and attacks.
I believe we are entering upon one of the greatest eras of economic prosperity the USA has ever seen.  Thank-you President Trump!
If we can maintain or grow our House Majority in the midterms and take a Super-Majority in the Senate, the Trump MAGA Agenda will be unstoppable for the next 6 years!
How can Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats convince America the amazing Trump Economy is actually bad for them?  Talk about needing a magic wand!
Trump's economic policies are going to turn the rustbelt into the gleaming bright steel belt!
Obama said manufacturing jobs were never coming back.  Under Trump, manufacturing has exploded.  Republicans may never lose the rustbelt states again!
Trump has cut over 800 Obama-era regulations and brought massive tax reform to create REAL fulltime jobs.  What did Obama do to create jobs?  Government stimulus and fake demand?
Most of the "jobs" created under Obama were "gig" work and part-time jobs with no benefits.  Trump is replacing 2 and 3 PT jobs with FT careers with benefits. Huge difference.

As Trump works to reduce our trade deficits, GDP will rise.  Trade imbalances have a very strong negative effect on GDP!
Why would Democrats want to repeal tax reform?  It is raising record revenues for the Treasury through growth!
I am still amazed we got tax reform done with this divided Congress.  Still find it amusing Democrats plan to run on repealing it.
Not only is tax reform putting more money into people's pockets, it is allowing employers to hire more and pay more.  Rising tide lifts all boats!
President Trump's economic policies are making Americans more prosperous. There is a sense of revival in the land!
Get ready for the midterms folks!  This could be the moment we end the Democrat Party as a relevant political force for a generation!
President Trump is making America great again despite 24/7 lies from the Democrat-controlled Media Machine.  They will not win!
As long as you are living, you may as well live large.  This isn't a dress rehearsal.  This is Broadway baby and every day is opening night!
Thank God for this amazing country where anyone can succeed with enough hard work and determination.  What is your million-dollar idea and what are you doing to make it happen?
According to at least one poll, immigration is now a bigger issues in voter's minds that tax reform.  America is sick of Democrat open-borders policies!
Is your paycheck bigger since Republicans passed tax reform?  Will America vote in 2018 to give that money back to the Democrats?  I don¬ít think so.
I'm in DC weekly working on #TaxReform 2.0.  We are closing loopholes, fixing mistakes and adding new features to make this the best tax plan ever!
As a small business person, taxes can be your biggest expense.  Why pay more than you have to?  Hire a great CPA to save every penny you have so you can hire and expand!
The economy is so strong there are over 6 million open jobs which cannot be filled.  This means employers need to start improving the training of existing staff.  A good thing!
Well, the OIG Report on #DeepState is coming soon.  Popcorn folks.  This will be drama!
It's sad day when the #Media's only job is to spin the amazing Trump results as failures.
If Republicans can get a new Speaker before the midterms who is pro #MAGA, look for Republican turnout to surge to record levels!
If you like #TaxReform 1.0 you'll LOVE #TaxReform 2.0.  Coming soon!
By bringing trade into balance, Trump will dramatically improve GDP.  Trade imbalances are stone cold GDP-killers.
The economy in 2019 should be nothing less than astounding.  The biggest challenge will be keeping inflation under control as GDP surge to record levels.
Even in California Democrats are getting nervous as seats they once considered easy targets begin to slip away from their grasp.
In the latest Reuters/Ipsos generic poll, Republicans have surged to a 6 point lead, up 9 since their last poll.  If this holds, the Democrat Party is finished.
Why does the #Media obsess over silly nothing stories like #StormyDaniels?  Because it fills their time so they don¬ít have to talk about Trump's amazing results!
Democrats are talking about using the "savings" from rolling back #taxcuts to fund social programs.  What savings???  We'll have LESS TAX REVENUE!
I'm actually astounded at the Democrats. They really plan on rolling back the Trump #taxcuts that have fueled the greatest economic boom in history. #smh
The upcoming midterms may signal the end of the modern Democrat Party as we know it.  They could be wiped out as a relevant political force!
Republican turnout has skyrocketed in primaries now that Paul Ryan has announced his intention to resign.  People feel like their votes matter again!
I hope #NancyPelosi keeps putting herself out there as the next Speaker should the Democrats win the House.  What a great #GOTV motivator for Republicans!
As a successful businessman, I look at the modern Democrat Party and wonder to myself how other business men and women can support their #AmericaLast policies.
Surprisingly, despite doubts as to the Republican Congress being able to unify around anything, the stock market "baked in" the tax cuts and rallied on them for a year before they took effect.
After observing the last 16 months carefully, I cannot help but conclude that the Democrat Party seeks nothing less than the destruction of this nation.
The Left cherishes empty symbolism and hates actual results.  Of course, symbolism leads only to dependency while results lead to invididual prosperity and independence.
I honestly have to wonder what that entire thing about kneeling for the Anthem was in the NFL.  It was stayed by a guy who got cut and left stadiums half empty.  For what?  Empty symbolism?
The new NFL policy that players must stand for the anthem is wildly popular with fans.  The kneeling, while achieving nothing, was damaging the NFL brand terribly.
Just a few days ago, Obama officials were admitting there were "spies" inside the Trump Campaign, then they became only "informants," and now they can't remember there ever even being those!
I am so excited that the #MAGA Candidates I have supported with fundraisers are winning and winning BIG in their primaries.  Incredible times!
#TaxReform 2.0 is gonna be awesome.  Stay tuned.  I'll have the inside scoop!
Nancy Pelosi is talking about a "better deal" for Americans.  This outta be good.  What's better than 3.9% unemployment and 6.5 million open jobs?
Word is, immigration policy is going to be a major midterm issue.  Trump wants a fair deal for American workers.  Polls show this is the #1 issue for voters.  Democrats better watch out!
The Trump economic miracle marches on.  Because the US economy is so well, Trump has tremendous leverage to lead around the world.
Some employers are complaining that wage costs are rising due to the terrific Trump economy.  This is how it works folks.  Capitalism and competition.
Small businesspeople in America are prospering as never before.  We bare at 3.9% unemployment and have 6.5 million unfilled jobs.  This economy is hot!
I'm working hard in DC to make #TaxReform even bigger, better and more effective than it first was.  Incredible things ahead folks!
Democrats are running on paying reparations, universal income, free college and repealing tax cuts.  Lol, really?  See you in November.
Democrats are actually starting to float real plans to repeal the Trump tax cuts.  Tax cuts that are causing our economy to surge and increasing revenues to the Treasury!
If Republicans can hold the House and expand their majority in the Senate, the next 6 years of the Trump Presidency will be miraculous!
I am hopeful that the next Speaker of the House will be a major #MAGA CONSERVATIVE!  Things are looking positive!
I am one of the nation's leading tax experts.  I'm directly involved in creating tax reform on Capitol Hill.  Follow my feed for the latest on what's REALLY happening!
Face it folks, we owe this incredible economy to the Trump tax cuts.  It has worked even better than the greatest optimist ever dreamed!
I've been working hard in DC every week to bring even bigger and better tax reform to you.  Stay tuned, amazing things coming!
Trump knows Kim will never be a great nuclear power, but he is offering him the opportunity to be a great economic power.  He knows that is what Kim REALLY wants.
"Trump signaled to Kim Jong-un that he would benefit from denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, promising to guarantee his personal safety and invest a great amount of money into the country if a deal could be reached."
Kim in North Korea has been trying to gain the upper hand in negotations with Trump by threatening to back out of a meeting.  Trump's reaction?  "I'm good either way¬Ö"
Almost every pundit on the media, including those in Conservative circles, claimed Trump's trade tariffs would be a disaster.  Yet they are a huge success.  Amazing.
Democrats are actually talking about impeaching President Trump if they win back the House.  As if the Trump base wasn't already motivated to vote!
As a business person, I could not be more excited about the economic policies of the Trump Administration.  Truly bold, decisive and miraculous.
The best way to become a winner is just start acting and taking actions like you're a winner.  Never a beggar be.  Live large and think strong.
It's funny that so many doubted Congress would get #TaxReform done when the stock market was pricing it in for a year beforehand.
Everyone is going to be very happy with the additional tax reforms we have been working ont in DC.  Amazing!
President Trump looks like he is tuning up to make a major move on #DeepState.  This just as the OIG Report is about to drop. Tick tock. Exciting times!
Trump spent the first year of his presidency learning the job, finding out how the system works.  Now he's got it.  The next 7 years of his office will be astounding!
Join us Monday in DC... https://t.co/5ChDAGRFZN
Before Trump I always wondered what would happen if you gave a strategically brilliant billionaire the reigns of government.  Well, now we know.  Awesome!
My tax business is doing fantastically.  My clients are feeling more prosperous than ever.  Money is flooding back into the United States.  Trump is the difference!
Historians will look back upon this time with sheer amazement.  At no time in history has a nation ever declined to the brink only to be revived to ever higher heights than ever before!
President Trump isn't just making America great again. he is making America the greatest it has ever been!
Trump said we'd win so much we'd get tired of winning.  Gotta say, not feeling tired yet!
The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans want prosperity for everyone, Democrats want to control who is prosperous.
I have been in DC working on #TaxReform 2.0.  I'm here to tell you, once implemented, this economy is going to take off like a rocketship.
As well as this economy is doing, can you imagine if we can grow our majorities in the House and Senate this November?  The 2nd two years of Trump's presidency will be astounding!
Considering how well the economy is doing and especially how well minorities are doing in this economy, the Liberal arguments that Trump cares only for his rich friends ring hollow.
Hopefully we have some tricks up our sleeve with Tax Reform 2.0 https://t.co/vCMZRF0i0o
You think the #Media and #Democrats are panicking now, wait for October!
The most amazing thing about the booming Trump economy if that it is not based upon an asset or technology bubble - just good solid fundamentals.
We are witnessing the true power of capitalism unleashed!  It is truly a remarkable sight!
Despite complaints from the CBO to the contrary, Trump's tax rate cuts have INCREASED revenues to the Treasury - at record levels!
My special personal thanks to all the voters who called their Congressmen during #TaxReform negotiations.  You made a HUGE difference!
I've been in DC a lot working shoulder to shoulder with Republican Leadership to make #TaxReform even bigger and more #AmericaFirst than before!
The fact Democrats are actually talking about running AGAINST a great economy tells you all you need to know about Democrats!
Are the Democrats TRYING to throw the midterms?  They are against Israel, for Iran and are openly hoping the economy will fail to give them a chance!
America was truly at the brink.  But with God's help and the leadership of President Trump, we are back, bigger and better than ever before!
I‚Äôm making taxes great again
The momentum for November is building, not to a #BlueWave (which was never realistic), but a #RedTsunami!  It's just getting better folks.
Name one amazing thing Democrats have done in the past year?  Just one.  Right.  You can't.  This is why they will lose in November.
Trump does not seek to silence his enemies, he seeks for them to speak loudly.  That is the only way America will know their words are empty.
The Democrats have been forced into the position of lurching far left to raise money.  This has ceded the 60% in the middle to Trump.  Perfect triangulation strategy.
When you go to vote on Nov 6th, remember this.  Not ONE Democrat voted for the Trump tax cuts.  Not one.
Despite being beyond full employment, record numbers are new jobs are coming available.  The effect of reducing the corporate tax rate to 21% has been immeasurable!
I am thankful to be alive during these historic times and to have a bold President like Trump to lead us!
Make no mistake.  The current strong economy is due to the tax cuts.  The effect of reducing the corporate tax rate so dramatically has been huge!
I don't understand?  Where is the Democrat support for Israel?  They seem to prefer terrorist Iran!
Tax Reform = Jobs!!!	https://t.co/o2Nyf4CW2f
The powers that be will rage for a few days over the new US Embassy in Jerusalem, but then they will calm down and rage about something else.  No attention span.
Today the US opened its new Embassy in Jerusalem in an historic gesture of peace and support.  Not a single sitting Democrat Congressman attended.  Incredible.
As is the case with every election, it all comes back to, "the economy stupid."  Almost 90% of voters now rank (the amazing) economy as their top issue!
Republican enthusiasm to vote in the midterms in spiking.  Democrat enthusiasm is lagging.  They peaked too early and are now on the decline.
During the recent primaries, we saw HUGE Republican turnout and Democrat enthusiasm clearly lagging.  Great #MAGA candidates won!
Look for President Trump to really turn on the presidential charm heading into the midterms.  Democrats are in trouble.
Democrats are in trouble for the midterms.  Their lead in polls, even on CNN, is gone.  Millennials are losing interest.  Minority groups are shifting to Trump!
Look what President Trump has achieved with a divided Congress full of establishment haters.  Can you imagine a #MAGA Congress with a Republican #SuperMajority?
We all owe a debt of thanks to the real people who worked hard behind the scenes to get quality #TaxReform passed.  If you called your Congressman, you made a difference!
The Trump #TaxCuts have surpassed the expectations of their most ardent supporters and confounded their biggest critics.  Truly amazing!
I'm live speaking on Tax Reform 2.0  .... https://t.co/05IQi3QKm3
The Democrats are worried.  About what?  That the economy is so amazing under Trump.  How do they run against a great economy?  They don't.
The US is finally preparing to open its new embassy in the capital city of Jerusalem.  After decades of promises, President Trump DID IT!
Headed to DC to work on Tax Reform 2.0 this week. What would you like to see in additional tax changes?  https://t.co/TW6z7zmbAG‚Äòtax-reform-2.0‚Äô-may-include-education-assistance-and-retirement-benefit-reform-.aspx
No Europe, we don¬ít want to become you.  President Trump is making America the greatest nation on earth!
I see no indication on a daily basis that Democrats love America.  They seem to disdain what she stands for.
The Democrats are "tired" of hearing, "Make America Great Again!"  Well, they better find a comfortable chair and get used to it!
I'm in DC weekly working on tax policy, making the already amazing tax reform bill EVEN BETTER for America!
President Trump is slowly exposing and defeating the #DeepState from within.  He constantly does things they said could never be done.
Signs of the tax cut can be found all over the economy and the Internal Revenue Service adjusting tax withholding tables, giving workers a preview of ongoing tax relief.	https://t.co/izqPxISjWU
America is abandoning the Democrats.  At what point to Democrats start abandoning the Democrats?
The Democrats Generic Preference for Congress has evaporated - down to just 3 points - which is actually a lead for Republicans.  What a change!
Isn't it a strange word where Democrats actually seem depressed that America is doing so well?
It is great fun watching the #NeverTrump pundits forced to admit that Trump's tax cuts were an amazing idea and working as promised.
Make no mistake, the current economic boom we are experiencing is 100% due to the tax cuts.  The surge started even before passage as businesses anticipated lower rates!
Tax cuts are amazing.  Look at the economy!  Best thing Trump and Congress ever did!
So many of the old guard establishment Republicans are retiring.  They just can't enjoy Congress anymore in Trump's results-oriented USA!
I am so excited about the primary election results from last night!  True #MAGA Candidates being chosen!  Amazing.
Democrats never can understand how tax rate cuts result in growth and record revenues because they aren't a part of growth, they are a party of failure.
Tax revenues are off the charts, bringing in $40 billion more than the CBO had estimated.  Honestly, the CBO just isn't good at calculating the positive effects of growth!

President Trump, like Reagan before him, believes in peace through strength, not leading from behind.
How many times have Trump's critics shouted into the cameras he was starting WW3 when, in fact, he was making world peace possible?
Trump's two decisive bombings in Syria sent a clear message to despots around the world - I'm coming for you.
Why have the Trump tariffs succeeded where the Bush tariffs failed?  Well, Trump is Trump and Bush was Bush.  People take Trump more seriously.
As a result of the bold and brilliant Trump tariffs the pundits swore would not work, major global players are now discussing building factories HERE to avoid tariff costs.
The Trump tax cuts and especially the lower corporate tax rate has now made America the envy of the world as THE place to do business.
As we go further beyond full employment, employers have no choice but to raise wagers as they compete for more and more scarce employees.
As a result of the Trump #TaxCuts, unemployment is now below 4%!  That is far beyond what economists consider to be "full employment"!  Amazing!
Even before Congress miraculously passed #TaxReform, this economy was factoring in its positive results.  Reality has exceeded even those expectations!
As a successful businessman and entrepreneur, allow me to say how excited I am about the pro-business Trump policies.  Amazing for me and my business!
The amazing Trump economy is not based upon a bubble in dot.coms or real estate from cheap money.  It is based upon solid supply and demand and will last!
The affect on jobs from the tax cuts has been dramatic.  Companies are flush with cash and hiring like mad to keep up with their competitors.
Nancy Pelosi talking about being Speaker again is a gift from Heaven!  No Democrats yet are running on the far left Pelosi agenda.
If Republicans can maintain a strong Majority in the House and take a Super Majority in the Senate, the #AmericaFirst agenda will be unstoppable the next 6 years!
Retweet if you feel fired up for the next 6 years of the Trump Presidency!
I've been spending a lot of time in DC working on improving tax reform.  Exciting things are happening.  We're making this law even better!
It is interesting that with President Trump, things always seem the most chaotic just before he scores a major victory.  I think this is part of his strategy!
Trump's approval is back at 51% again, even after more than a year of non-stop media attacks.  How high can he go?  55%?  60%?  Anything is possible!
What a week for Trump!  The prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula are amazing!  Tax reform and trade reform are all paying off!
Democrats are planning to run on, "Elect us because we're not them!"  That doesn't work when you have record jobs and a strong economy."
I expect Democrats to be largely absent from the campaign trail just as Hillary was.  When it comes to campaigning, not having an agenda is a problem.
Dependency never made anyone happy.  No wonder Liberals are so miserable.
The Democrats are actually running on raising your taxes.  Who runs on giving you less?
Donald Trump is making America the most attractive place on earth for worldwide investment dollars.  That means jobs, jobs, jobs!
I am an experts expert on saving you big money on your taxes.  Why do you think they wanted me in DC to help with reform?  Follow me for great tax advice!
Kanye West is shaking things up.  He is questioning the old accepted premises of the Democrat Party and hitting them head on with the truth.  Amazing.
The country is doing very very well, and yet, pollsters will tell you a strong majority are still unhappy with the direction of the country. What don¬ít they like about up?
I am still amazed by the miracle of tax reform.  How did this divided Congress and even this divided Party manage to pull it off?
The Democrats are actually going to run on raising your taxes?  Lol, really?  We just elected a President who promised to cut our taxes.  How is that going to work?
The special elections Democrats won in Trump heavy districts were against weak Republicans running to replace weak Republicans.  No one ran on Pelosi policies.
If the media has the power to move the needle politically, why don¬ít Democrats control anything?  They are preaching to the choir but the congregation left.
I think President Trump could cure cancer tomorrow and all the media would talk about is out of work doctors.
Nobody likes paying taxes.  Right up there with health insurance, it feels like you're paying a lot for something you rarely use.  You'll feel better if you reduce that debt.  Call a professional!
I feel sorry in a way for the Democrats.  Trump won on just the promise of what he would accomplish. Now he has actually ACCOMPLISHED IT!
I could understand America wanting to elect Democrats if the economy or foreign affairs were failing, but President Trump is winning bigly on every front!
If America was hungering for a return to Liberal government, wouldn't they have elected Hillary just a year ago?
I keep hearing about this #BlueWave from the #Media, but they never mention which Democrats policies are going to bring it?
As one voice, the #Media mocked President Trump as "dangerously insane," on North Korea.  Perhaps they are the ones who are dangerously insane?
President Trump says Republicans are going to win the midterms.  Don't bet against President Trump.
We are getting bigger and better tax reform done in DC.  It's exciting!
I see momentum building for Republicans for the midterms.  Things will turn out much worse for the Democrats than anyone imagines.
President Trump has achieved more in one year with little help from Congress and no help from the media than Obama achieved in 8. Dramatically more.
Can you imagine if Obama had been responsible for potentially re-uniting North and South Korea?  The #Media would be beside themselves with joy.
The #Media is so invested in hoping for President Trump's failure, they simply cannot take joy in North Korea.  It has to be awful being them.
Minorities love Trump!!!! Don‚Äôt be fooled by fake media https://t.co/Jz320N5ZZw

I am amazed at what is happening in North and South Korea.  I appreciate Trump's "hopeful skepticism and strength" in negotiating the peace.
Have been in DC a lot lately working on #TaxReform.  This fight isn't over!  Many exciting new ideas coming down the road soon.  Exciting!
Without a permanent victim class, the Democrat Party cannot survive.  They have no motivation to create legislation to end poverty, only prolong it.
Something is changing.  The entire premise that blacks must vote Democrat is being shaken to its core. Republicans have been the Party of equal rights from the start!
Kanye West - "Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up. Lot of people agree with me, but they too scared to speak up." - wow.

Actually I know why the #Media keeps worrying about WW3.  To the Progressive Movement, what Trump is doing to them must feel like the end of their world!

By staking out the middle on positions like gun control and immigration, President Trump has brilliantly forced the Democrats hard Left when they wish they could run as moderates.
The Democrats hate Trump so much, they have convinced themselves they can run on higher taxes, more crime and open borders and win.

I hope the new Speaker of the House will be a pro-MAGA leader.  Retweet if you agree.
As dysfunctional as DC is, I still marvel at the fact we got as good a tax reform package passed on the first try as we did.  We're making it better!
Don¬ít listen to what these ridiculous #FakePolls tell you.  Trump's tax reform is wildly popular and we're working hard to make it even better!
Symbolic victories are great.  You get to live in your symbolic White House, govern from the symbolic Congress and write symbolic laws no one has to follow!
Hey I know, maybe after the Democrats get wiped out in the 2018 midterms and lose a Super Majority to Republicans, they can claim some sort of "symbolic victory"?
These boycotts, protests, etc. are like everything the Left does - all symbolism, no results.  #Democrats, America elected President Trump because we want RESULTS!
Frankly I am amused by these Leftist boycotts.  They do NOTHING to move the needle on the underlying issue in the Left's favor and if anything, improve the business of their target. #strange.

No matter what Democrats tell you, any economic legislation they propose is designed to make you broker and more dependent upon them!
Democrats derive their power from the dependency of a victim class.  What then is their motivation to propose prosperity legislation?
Never forget, not one Democrat voted for tax reform.  Not one.  They don¬ít want you to keep your own money because it's harder for them to control you.
People don¬ít realize that tax cuts aren't tax revenue cuts at all. They are tax rate cuts. Actual revenues increase due to economic expansion.
Despite the big Trump tax cuts, revenues to the Treasury are hitting record highs!  I guess that blows a hole in the, "How do you pay for these cuts?, argument.
Well, tax day is here.  Are you ready?  Start today doing your tax planning for next year.  If you don't already, seek the advice of professionals to save big money.

Trump is a bold strategic leader.  The Democrats and media can't get him because they don't think big picture as he does.  He uses this to his advantage.
From illegal immigration to trade to taxes, President Trump is making the hard, often unpopular in the moment decisions politicians before him have been afraid to make!

For all the rhetoric and name-calling flying around from the Democrats and Media, President Trump is hard at work just solving real problems like illegal immigration.
Rather than release dangerous illegals into our communities, Trump is looking into placing them at military facilities or building tent cities using the National Guard.
Trump has just signed a memo ending the long held policy of "catch &amp; release" where dangeorus illegals are released, HOPING they'll show up on their court date!

Lower tax rates always result in higher tax revenues due to a faster moving economy where money is taxed over and over again at lower rates rather than just once at higher rates.
Democrats act like all your money is theirs and they decide how much you get to keep.  Republicans act like your money is yours and take as little as possible.
Liberal is a misnomer.  It doesn't stand for liberty as the more power Liberals posses, the less liberty you enjoy.
Democrats want higher tax rates not because it raises more money, it doesn't, but because it makes them the deciders on who wins and loses.
Liberals never want to actually solve problems.  They derive their power from problems.  Prosperity is the last thing they seek for you and me.
This new enthusiasm for #MAGA entertainment bodes well for Republicans in the fall and spells potential disaster for #AmericaLast Democrats.

When you cut tax rates, you make the economy move.  Every time the economy moves, you get to tax it.  So you tax more at less and end up with more, much more!
Tax "cuts" really is a misnomer.  They are really tax "rate" cuts.  Tax rate cuts actually result in increased revenues to the Treasury!  Not a "cut" at all!

This campaign season, will we see Democrats nationwide campaigning against liberal principles and will the voters know they have no intent of governing that way?
PA-18 was unusual in that you had a Democrat eek out a win by running AWAY from the Democrat Leadership's agenda.  How will that work in the broader midterms on November 6th?
On philosophy behind picking a "Cabinet of Rivals" as Trump initially did to an extent is to know the thinking of the enemy.  By having Cohn onboard, he knew intimately what the #Globalists were thinking.
Larry Kudlow and Mike Pompeo look to be two excellent pics by the Trump White House.  As we prepare for even bigger tax cuts, Trump seems to be settling into a comfort zone with his team.
Congress will also be looking to fix a host of legislative ambiguities and hiccups that companies and accountants have discovered in the law since it was passed.
The tax cuts for families passed in the recent #TaxReform bill were not permanent due to reconciliation.  Congress will work on addressing that in their new bill.
"We're really encouraged. Main Street optimism is at record levels. Our economy is really gaining momentum and booming in a big way." - Kevin Brady

Trump has shown that "carrying a big stick" when it comes to dealing with despots like Kim in Korea is effective.  Bowing to them like Obama, not so much.
