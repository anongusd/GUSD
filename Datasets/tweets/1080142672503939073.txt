@MarkClemen3 @cb_laflare @realDonaldTrump Lucky?! He is a bigoted, racist, self-important, narcissistic, sexist, arrogant, ignorant, dangerous, hate - inciting, environment - polluting, deluded, vile criminal. He has brain washed many white Americans, in particular, creating echoes of Nazi propaganda.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It is propaganda....and a dirty tactic by Trump. On top of all his racism...his sexist views over women's choices for their own bodies is dangerous. Decisions about abortion are not taken lightly, and drs do not kill viable babies. I agree with you completely!
