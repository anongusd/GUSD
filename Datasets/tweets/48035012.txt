The Vatican ends six week of silence and mounts a response to the accusations of Carlo Maria Viganò. https://t.co/TuTSAyw26j
The Ouellet letter is noteworthy because, for six weeks, there has been overwhelming silence from all the key Vatican figures who had any standing to refute or back up Viganò’s claims. As of today that has changed.
Ouellet writes that “presenting the measures taken against [McCarrick] as ‘sanctions’ decreed by Pope Benedict and annulled by Pope Francis is false.”
Ouellet says the letter is a “political fabrication.” But in the meantime, he also lends some credence to the idea the Vatican was onto McCarrick. Says McCarrick, at an unspecified time, had been “strongly invited not to travel and not to appear publicly.”
One of the Vatican’s highest-placed cardinals, Marc Ouellet, has written a combative letter defending Pope Francis against the Viganò accusations. It’s the first time anybody mentioned in Viganò’s letter has pushed back against any of his claims.

Another part of the @Pontifex letter: "With shame and repentance, we acknowledge ... that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives. We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them."
Francis specifically mentions Pennsylvania grand jury report. But does not mention other notable, recent cases — McCarrick, etc. He also does not lay out any concrete reforms.
Pope Francis, in letter released just now, says “no effort must be spared” to fight abuses in Catholic Church. He describes “the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience” perpetrated by a “significant number of clerics.”

This is a definitive opposition to the death penalty. Previously, the opposition was *nearly* complete, but allowed for the penalty in very rare cases when it was a means necessary to defend lives.
Pope Francis has altered the Catholic Church teaching on the death penalty, saying it “attacks the dignity of the person” and is “unnecessary as protection for the life of innocent people.”

Update on US’s Emily Sweeney, injured tonight during women's luge singles event: 	- at hospital	- no apparent broken bones	- able to walk on own power	- teammates seemed shaken but somewhat relieved by initial prognosis
Just saw Sweeney in the back of an ambulance. It was about to take off, but she yelled for it to stop. “I’m fine,” she said, yelling loud. She was crying. Helped out of ambulance and she walked gingerly into a room off-limits to press.
A stretcher was brought out just in case, but Sweeney does seem to be walking off — gingerly — on her own power. #USA #luge
US luger Emily Sweeney just had a nasty crash. Officials with walkie-talkies rushing over. She ping-ponged and then came to a stop.

The U.S. added a solid 223,000 jobs in June; unemployment rate down to 5.3%, lowest of recovery.

3. James Towey, one of Darren Wilson’s lawyers, said that the idea Brown was surrendering or had hands up is “total bulls---.”
2. They ALL feel that Dorian Johnson’s initial story is the reason this case, among so many, went huge. Major disdain for Johnson.

New #MH370 search area is 75,000 sq km, compared with 7.68 million sq km at its largest point several weeks ago.
There have been no further detections from Chinese ship, which is operating 300 nautical miles south of Ocean Shield.
You need a "completely noiseless environment," Houston says.
Australian ship, the Ocean Shield, is the only one working the area listening for pings. Why? B/c other ships would contaminate acoustics.
Hopefully "in a matter of days" we'll find something on the bottom of the ocean floor, says Angus Houston, #MH370 search leader.
Search teams now focused on a much smaller area for #MH370. "I believe we're searching in the right area."
Australia has analyzed data of initial pings and found them consistent in frequency and recurrence w/ that of a flight data recorder.
Australia reports two new potential black box transmissions picked up by the Ocean Shield vessel.

The depth of the ocean where signals are being transmitted is 4,500 m -- limits of capability for underwater technology.
The Ocean Shield is in northern section of the underwater search area.
Signals were heard for more than two hours -- with TWO distinct pings. (cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder)
Australia says it navy vessel has picked up "very encouraging" signal suggesting transmissions *possibly* from MH370 black box.

There was some int'l hope that things might improve under Kim Jong Un. But that is "ashes in our mouth now," Kirby says.
Kirby also sent Kim Jong Un a letter informing him that he "may be responsible in any subsequent prosecution."
Kim Jong Un was given a copy of the COI report.
Kirby on #DPRK: "There will be no excusing a failure of action because we didn’t know. We do know.”

What are consequences? Well, let’s wait a few months. Or a few years. There's a treasure waiting at the classified archives in Pyongyang.
Whatever just happened in N. #Korea this week, it was big. And far more consequential than the fleeting "tensions" of March/April.

Early story on Jang's execution. The severity of his punishment is "uncharted territory," even for a brutal regime. http://t.co/n61QrgaLoW
KCNA: Jang facilitated the spread of a "decadent capitalist lifestyle" by "distributing all sorts of pornographic pictures" to his pals.
The extent of this scapegoating is epic. So wait-- Jang was the man behind the 2009 currency revaluation? … and then he was promoted by KJI?
N. #Korea criticizes Jang for selling off control of Rason ports to "a foreign country" -- e.g., China -- "for a period of five decades."
@adamcathcart i noticed that too. JST didn't seem to have one.
KCNA: For those who disobey the Supreme Commander, "there will be no place for them to be buried even after their death."
North Korea has updated its own story on Jang. 2,700 words. Last sentence: "The decision was immediately executed."
But that's only if you take North Korean state media at its word. Charges against Jang could be trumped up way to rationalize his removal.
This seems to be the most clearly documented case of dissent in N. Korea in 65 yrs of Kim family rule.

North Korea says that Jang began "overtly and covertly standing in the way of settling the issue of succession" after Kim Jong Il's death.
"Despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog," betrayed the trust of North Korea's leaders.
The latest DPRK dispatch says that #Jang had been "attempting to overthrow the state."
DRPK: Jang faced a military tribunal Thurs. The verdict "served as a sledge-hammer blow" showing the anger of the North Korean people.

The inimitable Andrei Lankov thinks the purging of DPRK elites will continue for quite some time. Nobody untouchable.

In NKorea, a person who commits even one of Jang’s crimes — while disobeying orders from KJU himself — would have been executed yesterday.
Eventually, we’ll have our answer on Jang’s fate. But if Jang escapes execution, it’s North Korea’s version of celebrity justice.

Best as I can tell, Jang was last mentioned in #DPRK media Nov. 6. Last mentioned alongside KJU on Oct. 10.

Reminder to self: write every word of this story as if Jang might appear tomorrow.
According to the lawmaker, two Jang aides, Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-keel, were publicly executed.
At a press briefing, ruling party lawmaker Cho Won-jin, who had been briefed by NIS, says Jang "very likely" dismissed of all positions.
Report of Jang's dismissal is intriguing. But several recent NIS assessments of North Korea have been wrong. So caution is the way to go.
If this is true, it would be by far the biggest shake-up since Kim Jong Un came to power two years ago.
S. Korea's Yonhap news agency says Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong Un's uncle, has been removed from power.
