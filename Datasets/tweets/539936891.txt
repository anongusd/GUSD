@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris That‚Äôs my point. There are many different reasons why. Of course she only finds a specific example that could be explained (not racism) but only cites a number
@BreitbartNews He‚Äôs never kissed the butt of Joe Biden therefore you can cross child molestors off the most.
@MNfrankie It could be the author (FM) writes content worthy of reading and sharing. High school sports coverage is an amazing tool that introduces so many folks to the athletes in our area. It shares their stories, triumphs and losses. Many times it‚Äôs the backbone of small towns.
@KamalaHarris Holy smokes. The three states cited for this embarrassing (according to the article, apparent racist Edu spending) are CA, NY, and NJ... who have 1 thing in common - run by DEMs. Crazy and pathetic. Do better
@KamalaHarris Where? Here in our area of S.C. those districts receive nearly the double amount of per pupil spending. Also, do you account for / factor for costs such as higher utilities, building costs associated with schools? Those have zero to do with curriculum.
@ewarren Your boss, Nancy just asked, ‚Äúhow are we going to pay of it?‚Äù so good luck
@KamalaHarris This has been going on since the Carter years. What policies do you have that or are you just spouting off ‚Äúnew ideas‚Äù that are 40 years old?
@JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray @amprog Exactly! This staffer actually has a Brain and is absolutely correct. I bet they wrote her speech. Because she has to look down every three seconds. Clueless as usual unless it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrangeman bad. No wall‚Äù
@ewarren You‚Äôre at 10 points. You need to step it up or it will be an early exit.
@steph93065 @KamalaHarris Rent relief= take tax payer dollars and pay off the mortgages for land owners thereby increasing their wealth and further steepening the income divide. Kamala isn‚Äôt very smart or is she just trying to help the wealthy?

@JCI_JohnEvans @SenSchumer That‚Äôs cool. Can we add in a right uh a judge to declare someone mentally incompetent or unable to own weapons, then finally put the gun debate to bed?
@SenSchumer What is meaningful? Like where is the line of safety measures that will inhibit the wrong folks from obtaining guns and using them and not infringing on good folks‚Äô rights (2nd Amend)?

@SenGillibrand So you‚Äôre saying what the Podesta brothers did was wrong?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Research trafficking methods. I have. They say and do anything.
@ACTBrigitte An Educator, Soros Puppet, a drunkie, and an anti-Semite walk into a bar.
@AOC Very true! Law school and medical school tuition plus the costs of living, like food and rent and gas and laundry, these things are mostly only available to students who come from backgrounds with extra resources.
@PattyMurray They may be temporarily separated to make sure they are trafficking victims, but you voted for murder of babies. You saying there is no difference?
@ElectCDavis @GabrielaMcNiel @PattyMurray Most of the cases apparently accused by other minors. And this apparently has been a problem going back to previous Admin. Why are we just hearing about it now? Oh yeah.. media
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris You ever hear of traffickers? The kids need to be verified, then yes, immediately give back to parents after verification.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Or those where parents cannot be verified?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwith their family.‚Äù What happens to unaccompanied minors?
@ewarren What criminal implication was there? You are an attorney and should know the laws better.. heck you‚Äôre in Congress who makes the law. Smh. ‚ÄúMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.‚Äù Was the one thing you had. HAD
@DarenStoltzfus üòà
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris That was part of a sad movement. I didn‚Äôt say BLM. I said some folks. The cop killings was in response to the movement. Well documented. Also documented that BLM denounced the Texas shooting.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Tough one. How about remove them from possible dangers, first and sort out facts. Still no answer about the kids who can‚Äôt be identified. She tells half the story. An answer to that would tell the whole truth.
@JCI_JohnEvans @RepCunningham Laughter is the best medicine
@fjdinardo @DonaldJTrumpJr Because discord among Americans leads to outrage and disrupts peace and unity. A unified country is a strong one. See also, 9/12/01.
@PattyMurray Not true. It has nothing to do with cancer screenings or well being health care. It‚Äôs strictly regarding abortions and money (tax payer dollars) PPH uses to back door fund lobbying efforts. It‚Äôs not fair to use tax $ to lobby candidates many wouldn‚Äôt support their $ going to.
@RashidaTlaib @AOC Nice! Good work and great question.
@Refinery29 @AOC It‚Äôs a right afforded to someone by who? What document or other instrument says this is a right? I‚Äôm with you that wages have been stagnant too long, but what is the ‚Äúright‚Äù you speak of? Also,  is $32,200 a year ($15 per hour) a livable wage?
@Eagle_Woman_ @TrulyTrumpette @assilem4791 @Annakhait @Complex I don‚Äôt have a problem wit the idea, just the execution. 1. That small amount of money isn‚Äôt fixing the real issue. 2. How would anyone be able to determine who gets the reparation?

@Jim_Jordan Short answer: a Dem President declaring it, then they say Trump wasn‚Äôt right so the new Pres has to to do it.
@SpeakerPelosi Thread is a snowstorm of ‚ùÑÔ∏è you are complaining about Matt yet Adam S can say what he wants to the press without regard for the truth even. How many lies did he tell about an investigation on national TV and twitter?

@KamalaHarris What happens to the kids who cannot be safely reunified? How will you know if theirs claiming to be are rightful parents?
@SenKamalaHarris You may find more time to actually do what you were elected to do, if you weren‚Äôt flying around campaigning for President.
@PattyMurray And you participated in the ‚Äúvote‚Äù to allow doctors to look the other way as a child dies after birth, last night. But you‚Äôre whining over a nomination?
@KamalaHarris https://t.co/nkoo4fZG9z
@ElectCDavis @AOC What is a livable wage? I‚Äôve seen $15 an hour thrown out but is that? $31,200 a year supporting a family?
@RepCunningham Party over LoCo. Not 1 single vote that wasn‚Äôt party. What over reach? Are you saying the President doesn‚Äôt have the power to do this? That‚Äôs crazy because the last 3 Presidents used it approx 30 times. And one did so for ‚ÄúNational‚Äù Emergencies 7 times ON ANOTHER CONTINENT. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Not sure what in that text implied I said that. However in MN they did chant ‚Äúpigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon‚Äù then walked back it‚Äôs meaning. I don‚Äôt have a clue as to what is their actual, achievable goal.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Which then led some folks to then murder innocent police?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris BLM started because a Hispanic Jewish guy wanna be cop murdered a kid under an egregious use of the stand your ground law?
@KamalaHarris What movement?
@AOCortex2020 @Rae_Dawn_Chong @KamalaHarris Trayvon was killed by a Hispanic man, no?
@JCI_JohnEvans @JackPosobiec No idea, man. My point is $33K doesn‚Äôt touch what needs to be done. We need to be providing massive overhauls in education that leads to real jobs. That beaks cycles of poverty and inequity.
@SenGillibrand What rights are in danger? Women? Children?
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 4. Instead of reparations, I think we need to look at what creates a balance. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell a man to pick him self up by the bootstraps if he has no boots.‚Äù Hence you can‚Äôt fix 227 years of income inequality with $33,000.
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 2. Kamala‚Äôs father admitted his family owned slaves in Jamaica. 3. The idea that the US was full of slaves is very wrong. Majority of Africans sold went to Brazil and Caribbean. Est 400K came to US over the 227 year period.
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 1 Like 25% (not the rich 5%). Also it is known poor white people fought in the civil war to protect the institution because they feared being seen equal to a slave if freed. I think the idea of reparations is bad, (humans are worth more than $33K) we need to be real with facts
@JackPosobiec My family was poor as hell growing up. The best I can tell, it‚Äôs pretty much always been the case, generation after generation of carpenters and other similar trades.
@PattyMurray Voted infanticide again. Washington should be very proud. The latest bill was specifically written that doctors had to provide care for a living child.

@SCforEd 1. That won‚Äôt do it but sure. Educators need to take a stand and mean it. Why is it that Educators weren‚Äôt picked to sit in the Cmte? @Paul_Bowers got them on the ropes, but ‚Äúwe‚Äù are letting them get back up. Hence all the delays and empty promises.

@frknreicher @edgeofit @PattyMurray Moral? Locking your door at night is immoral, then. Killing babies is moral to you?
@PattyMurray Recall you voted NO to pay the coast guard during the shut down. The people of Washington should know that. There was nothing about border or wall; just pay the coast guard and you voted no. Classic
@Ellis_Millshire @LingemannnNYC @RepJayapal @AOC Our entire national debt is 22 trillion. This represents 1/3 of all debt accumulated over time. And she wants to add that to it
@PattyMurray Has anyone at any time gotten Murray or staffer respond? Haven‚Äôt seen one yet. Perhaps you guys could vote out the baby murderer.
@RepKathleenRice Secure the border
@ewarren Backing out the deal Hillary made which sold 20% of Uranium rights to Russia, or no?

@SenKamalaHarris 1. You won‚Äôt have enough votes to pass so focus on things you can actually accomplish like securing the border 	2. Why don‚Äôt you investigate this? Russia donated over $145,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation; Hillary Clinton sold 20% America‚Äôs Uranium to Vladimir Putin. Hypocrisy

@JCI_JohnEvans @Michael74561282 @SpeakerPelosi You serious? Because the alternative is worse to those folks than murdering people based on their sexual orientation, women have little to no rights, and can be murdered for being raped. That‚Äôs better than voting for a R??
@AOC @rubendiazjr Current state of affairs include the MS13 murder that was filmed in your district?
@KamalaHarris Infanticide is not ‚Äúreproductive rights‚Äù your party has proposed bill to murder babies AFTER birth, yet you package it as ‚Äúreproductive rights‚Äù
@PattyMurray @usedgov And you supported Infanticide. What‚Äôs worse?
@pel_e @PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED The new design for the wall has pillars that go deep into the ground and have seismic technology. Why won they work? Planes, radar and drones. More agents at the border. Problem solved. Next?

@AOC That lady is holding a stop Kavanaugh poster.. the accusers said they made it up. Keith Ellison‚Äôs accuser hasn‚Äôt said she made it up. Where are the calls for him to resign? Seems hypocritical
@thehill NPR interview will do damage to his campaign
@Rep_Pendarvis Resign or no? Also troubling the accusations about the Lt Gov. The Sup Ct confirmation hearings taught us to believe the accused no matter what.
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi He is. He opened Gov back up and gave you three weeks to do your job. Odd that you‚Äôre still blaming him because you aren‚Äôt doing your job. You get paid $3,350 per week to do your job therefore in 3 weeks time, taxpayers paid you $10,000 to do nothing.

@azuredawn9 @cambabaroonie @PattyMurray 1. Stop being fake and toeing the party line. 2. Tell members in said party (House members in WA) to secure our border with whatever CBP says they need. They know better than anyone.
@WSeattlePete @PattyMurray Dude, Murray voted no to pay the Coast Guard during the shut down.

@AMeisner32 @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer So you‚Äôre arguing the states with low population shouldn‚Äôt matter? That‚Äôs why the house and senate were constructed - based on fairness of representation and population and to avoid a tyrant from 1 type of area controlling the masses

@benshapiro Agree
@KamalaHarris Permanently lift them out? Why can‚Äôt you do some real work, think past 1 and look at 2 and 3. What if you drafted a policy to permanently lift them out. You now through education with life skills, real jobs. This keeps property owners rich and no one really gets out of poverty.
@AveryGWilks Where‚Äôs the video?
@SenGillibrand Courage to protect American citizens at all costs?
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Gets even more complicated when non-citizens vote. The citizens can‚Äôt even agree.. seems like ALL of us agree we are duped by red and blue. They get rich off of our labor.
@ashleyawoww @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer I understand your argument. Should one city control an entire state? Should one state, i.e California control 10 states in the Southeast? Unfortunately it‚Äôs a reason our country is divided

@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Yes but not all voting is a US wide election. Perhaps your DL could be your ID. What is wrong with requiring and ID if said ID was easily available and free. And why should approx 5-10 states control the US?
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer So it‚Äôs fair to registered voters to go out and cast their vote in a democratic election when their vote may compete against an opposition vote by someone who isn‚Äôt legally supposed to vote?
@sportsmommy74 @JCI_JohnEvans @panerabread John is free. He can deliver üòÇ
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker ? Have you studied his 2002 campaign? While a loss, his will and resolve while facing so much mudslinging, facing folks who were all about Sharpe, knowing they had no interest in him, was and is very inspiring for someone willing to challenge the system. Kamala as Pres is a joke
@JohnLockwoodIII @Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer You‚Äôre saying there is no fraud in voting? Guess those dead voters came back from the grave to vote and the young man in CA was wrongfully convicted for registering illegal voters. You seem up to speed on facts
@JohnLockwoodIII @Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer I want every citizen of the US to vote.  I also want voting rights restored individuals who served their time. I do think the Gov should pay for a state / voter ID card then require it to vote. That‚Äôs fair and leads to good accounting.
@Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Roughly 2,000 votes affected who became President in 2000. Saying even 1 vote doesn‚Äôt matter is disingenuous to the system.
@garlickn0ts @TuckerTonight @SenSchumer Well as you may know, evidence was entered in federal court that the last Mexican Pres received bribes from the cartel, so we have to take our own measures.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez @SenBooker @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump So you don‚Äôt want an accurate count of American citizens? Isn‚Äôt that the purpose of the census?

@flrbase @AOC He grew up poor. He made a coffee house a global player in trade and green policies, employs thousands.. No she doesn‚Äôt want him in. She preaches fairness but is a hypocrite. Just like voting down that bill that would block Cong. from getting pay raises for sex offenses.
@tictoc @AOC I guess you think giving Legislators a pay raise even though they have sexual improprieties against them is ok. Your base know you feel that way, considering most of these incidences are men on women. Dems rejected Rep bill that would disallow raises for sex offenses
@MarshaBlackburn Would be amazing if US citizens could see the actual budget before congress votes on it. I have a feeling millions of tax payers would take issue with the billions leaving our country while we have so many veterans, children and families starving, homeless, lacking education etc
@KamalaHarris The Rep led senate Unanimously passed the federal anti-lynching bill in Dec. due to Corey‚Äôs hard work. I hope he runs for Pres. I can‚Äôt tolerate your ignorance and uninformed rhetoric much longer. @CoryBooker please save us from her. You didn‚Äôt sleep your way into office.
@KamalaHarris 2014 called and wants its crisis back. So on the the East Coast (that area East of West VA, we are free from the epidemic? You need new research folks. The more states leading the nation in opioid deaths are north and east of West VA.
@flrbase @AOC Exactly. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter what you did. But she preaches inclusion, tolerance, equality, and fairness yet told this gentlemen he wasn‚Äôt worthy of something and one could interpret it to mean she, as an elected official was a higher class of people. That‚Äôs not cool

@HereWeGoAgain @Ben_Margolin You‚Äôre educated. Hillary brokered selling 20 % of unranium mining rights to Russia; we kicked butt in Syria, and we‚Äôre backing the good guy in Venezuela against Putin, but ok guy.

@DawnSenate47 @DNewbille @KamalaHarris The shooters we legal gun owners? Seems like anyone who used a handgun like Roof would have been too young. Hence my suggestion all guns need to be insured and parents responsible for all crimes committed with their guns.
@nycjoe @RepCunningham @HolyCitySinner @dshelton66 This will age well.
@DNewbille @DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris Right legally. How many gun crimes are committed by legal purchases and rightful owners?

@benshapiro It‚Äôs too bad we can‚Äôt start a movement by the people of the people. Every single member of Congress should be replaced. They are paid a salary produced by the labor of the American people. Nothing this past month showed they did anything on our behalf. #derelictionofduty

@Imustbecrazy5 @meghanomical @DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris But also state we have to make America fair to all and give everyone an equal chance. What they then do with that chance is up to them. govt shouldn‚Äôt control people or indefinitely be a crutch IF all else in opportunity is fair.
@Imustbecrazy5 @meghanomical @DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris In part that‚Äôs why I partially support the slogan shared by Reagan, Clinton, and Trump to make it great again. However if that term applies the EVERYThing post -WW2 including pre-civil rights, I don‚Äôt agree. I support the economic boom that gives all folks good jobs.

@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Just as there are congressional members on the borders of Tex, NM and Arizona who do want it. As well as many border patrol agents. That‚Äôs part of the problem, some do. So who wins in the debate?
@BartSantello @cholata329 @PatriotRLR @BarbaraRauch6 @SecNielsen @POTUS I don‚Äôt agree with separation of kids from their family. Unfortunately in the world we live in today, many groups of people do not have documentation therefore it is had to prove whose kids belong to who. Many human traffickers exist and quite often it takes time to prove.
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham ? Odd post is odd.
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Racist - that‚Äôs odd. Against who? You obviously don‚Äôt know me. I have heard many many officials say they supported it. I asked what officials would it take for you the hear or believe they want it. A wall is in-American, how?
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 What officials said this? Do you agree that local residents, members of Congress in that area, local news sources and Border Agents to be officials on the subject? Is Pelosi an official on this subject?
üòÇ https://t.co/UWRRqKzYLT
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Your last sentence is incorrect. In fact, the President, Sec of Homeland Security, and many many many agents and officials and landowners on the border support it. Just 2 years ago, Chuck wanted it, Clinton, and Obama did, too. Why do you hate America?

@Mateo_Clough @RKnight36 @Bakari_Sellers That‚Äôs what I was trying to see or hear - what he did / said to inflame racial tensions.  1 guy told me it‚Äôs him siding with the police. What areas or gifts or economic policies has he tried to please Putin? Selling 20 % of US‚Äôs Uranium mining rights to them ticks me off.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Ok, thank you for your time. I was just tying to figure out why he did or said that makes you feel he is openly racist. Homophobic, xeno, and miso. Have a good night
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Not what I was intending. I am more interested in why people feel a certain way about Trump.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers his policies specifically 3 of them really really hurt families and people of color. I was a huge fan. He also gave a speech saying he wanted to Make America Great Again. Saw that one today.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers My questions are this: what exec orders, policies, laws proposed to Congress or actions by the Pres has made you feel he is racist or seeks to remove any rights or harm any US Citizen of any color? I was a huge B Clinton fan and the more I dug into it I found
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Respect and thank you to both for taking the time to reply. It‚Äôs really on me to figure out why people feel a certain way. We all different and we have different feelings and interpretations of what we see and hear. You guys mind helping me out?

@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris So poverty leads to gun crime? If guns aren‚Äôt necessarily a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in other areas, shouldn‚Äôt poverty be the target of concern? We shouldn‚Äôt take rights from folks who are in poverty (ie gun ownership) if they‚Äôve done nothing wrong. That‚Äôs akin to voting rights

@DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris Great discussion! Here‚Äôs the point, the lady who started it is a troller. So we do our best to hash out issues civilly. She doesn‚Äôt care about AAs in this country who suffer gun crime, poor schools, no healthcare, hungry, poor etc. She cares more about other nations‚Äô citizens.
@PattyMurray You‚Äôre equally to blame. The legislative and executive branches getting paid for this is ridiculous. Oh wait, executive doesn‚Äôt get paid under this guy.
@DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris I can see your point. Cigarettes kill around 280,000 a year. Ban those? (Please), DUI kills 11,000 per year, ban cars or booze? 19,000 died from prescription pain killers, ban those? At some point people need to be accountable - not the product
@rhauth @DawnSenate47 @GermanSwede @KamalaHarris 2. I do believe the Court should step in and remove weapons form someone deemed mentally unstable (threat to themselves or others) 3.

@domifrancon @PattyMurray @FoxNews The $180B I speak of is for illegals. And yes there are millions of US citizens that need that help and should have first rights to it. I begin to wonder if both sides ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the use of illegals for exploitation of labor. That in itself is wrong - using people.

@domifrancon @PattyMurray Ask your local hospital comptroller, the boards of Education, 85,000 in prison, and Gov assistance (welfare) programs. I‚Äôm all for helping folks, but we have so many US citizen children lacking food, healthcare and education. Why can‚Äôt we help our own first then help others?

@GailJoyZD @postandcourier Completely uneducated response. Davis salary has nothing to do with this.
It‚Äôs embarrassing. Yet not ONE member of the state legislature is willing to REALLY do something about this and reform our educational system. Education is a talking point for them - talking and no action. For some it‚Äôs: uneducated kids = cheap and expendable labor https://t.co/GAHCLyAkMA
@PattyMurray You do the right thing and secure the border. What costs the American tax payers more: $5B for wall or $180B spent annually on folks who break the law?
@KamalaHarris So spending 180 billion of our tax dollars on folks who break the law is ok?
@KamalaHarris You got it half right ... again
@KamalaHarris No they aren‚Äôt. Their paychecks are fine. The shit down was avoidable if the Senate cared about a safe and secure border.
