Cuba‚Äôs role in usurping democracy and fomenting repression in Venezuela is clear. That‚Äôs why the U.S. will continue to tighten financial restrictions on Cuba‚Äôs military and intel services. The region‚Äôs democracies should condemn the Cuba regime.
Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido has announced his planned return to Venezuela. Any threats or acts against his safe return will be met with a strong and significant response from the United States and the international community.

Any actions by the Venezuelan military to condone or instigate violence against peaceful civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders will not be forgotten. Leaders still have time to make the right choice.
The Venezuelan military must uphold its duty to protect civilians at the Colombian and Brazilian borders, and allow them to peacefully bring in humanitarian aid without violence or fear of persecution.

More Canadian diplomats attacked in Cuba. The US condemns the regime‚Äôs unwillingness to help identify perpetrators. The Cuban govt is responsible for ensuring the safety of diplomatic personnel, but instead focuses attention on subversion of democracy in Venezuela.
Today, President Guaido has asked the workers of Citgo to stay in their jobs during the democratic and economic recovery of Venezuela. The fruits of their labor will no longer be used to facilitate graft and corruption by Maduro.
Maduro‚Äôs FAES thugs have terrorized innocent children across Venezuela, including the daughter of President Juan Guaido today. All Venezuelan services must take this opportunity to accept President Guaido‚Äôs offer of amnesty and recognize the legitimate government. https://t.co/J6IUTn2MhO
I wish Nicolas Maduro and his top advisors a long, quiet retirement, living on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela. They should take advantage of President Guaido‚Äôs amnesty and move on. The sooner the better.

We continue to pursue all paths to disconnect the illegitimate Maduro regime from its sources of revenue and ensure that interim President Guaido and the Venezuelan people have the resources and support they need to bring democracy back to Venezuela.

UN inspectors have reported that #NorthKorea is selling #Syria elements for the manufacture of chemical weapons. Once #NorthKorea gains nuclear capability, you can expect the nuclear supermarket to open in #Pyongyang. They'll sell the technology to anyone willing to pay.
Any possibility of a diplomatic solution with #NorthKorea increases in direct proportion to the credibility of our military threat, which both China and North Korea must be made to understand is real.
Henry Kissinger said it right: ‚Äúwhat once was declared unacceptable is now becoming irreversible‚Äù... Decision time is coming soon for @POTUS, and #NorthKorea understands he‚Äôs very different than his predecessors.
The Europeans have fallen for the #Iran trap and re-opened economic ties with Iran.  The only way to make them realize the seriousness and gravity of the threat Iran poses is to get out of the #IranDeal.
The premise of Obama's #IranDeal was that if only the United States showed "good faith" and dropped our "harmful intent" toward Iran, they would give up their nuclear program and behave like a normal nation. None of this has happened.

If #NorthKorea does get deliverable nuclear weapons (and it‚Äôs on the verge of it with #Iran right behind them), then it‚Äôs a historical turning point. It means a half century or more of American counterproliferation policy has failed.
There‚Äôs been far too much debate over whether #Iran is in violation of the #NuclearDeal. The point is that this was a bad deal to begin with and it‚Äôs a bad deal now and it should be torn up.

With the recent protests in #Iran, we can see the danger that the regime is in. It would be a tragic mistake to now turn away the opportunity to turn the economic screws- we must tear up the #IranDeal.
.@POTUS should abrogate the #IranDeal. It was never in America‚Äôs strategic interest, it was always intended to benefit #Iran (and it has, substantially).
When @realDonaldTrump talks about the military option being on the table with regards to #NorthKorea, it‚Äôs not just rhetoric (like with @BarackObama), it‚Äôs real.
RT @FoxNews: .@AmbJohnBolton: "I'm prepared to argue at great length that Iran is violating the deal... This deal was so badly negotiated."‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs no doubt that the pressure that @realDonaldTrump has put on #NorthKorea has finally gotten their attention. They understand that @BarackObama is no longer president.
We have a very limited amount of time left before #NorthKorea gains deliverable nuclear weapons. We‚Äôve got to look at the very unattractive choice of using military force to deny them that capability.

North Korea's continuing emphasis on targeting the United States with ballistic missiles is a serious threat, and they‚Äôre getting rapidly closer to that capability.
I  would urge @POTUS to look at today‚Äôs #UN vote as a pivot to look at the question of American funding of the United Nations- what agencies we can zero out, what agencies we can withdraw from, as well as moving towards voluntary contributions.
I'll be on @FoxNews with @marthamaccallum at 7:30pm ET, then with @LouDobbs on @FoxBusiness at 7:40pm ET. Hope you'll tune in and watch.
In the General Assembly and many UN bodies, the membership simply doesn‚Äôt pay attention to the American position unless they think there‚Äôs money on the line.
There‚Äôs one diplomatic solution to #NorthKorea and that is to say to China: ‚ÄúYou want to get rid of the North Korea nuclear threat? The way to do it is to get rid of the regime.‚Äù
The US veto of the UN vote to void @POTUS‚Äôs #Jerusalem move was a demonstration of what American leadership really is. It does not consist of finding out what Europe wants to do and then agreeing with it.
There‚Äôs been criticism that @realDonaldTrump is an isolationist, but the record doesn‚Äôt bear that out. The real isolationist was @BarackObama.
I think it‚Äôs critical that @POTUS has made the point that you cannot have a strong American position in the world without a strong domestic economy. The reverse is true too.
If these rogue states think the threat of U.S. military action is just more rhetoric, like the last several administrations, then they will disregard it and #NorthKorea will get deliverable nuclear weapons.

The Middle East peace process has long needed clarity and an injection of reality, and Trump has provided it by making the decision to move the US embassy in #Israel to #Jerusalem.
Congress needs to pressure the State Department and provide prompt and adequate funding for building a first-class new embassy in #Jerusalem.
#Jerusalem has been Israel‚Äôs capital since 1948, and the sooner that the American flag flies over the American embassy there, the better.

I personally believe we should increase migration, but we should do it along the lines that @POTUS has suggested: on merit, not simply because of family relations and certainly not because of a visa lottery program.
It is fundamental to this country that everyone has the right to practice their own religion, but nobody has the right to commit terrorist acts because they are offended by somebody else‚Äôs religion. That kind of basic element to Americanization needs to be stressed more.

For a long time the threat of using brute force was used to intimidate the US into not acknowledging the reality of Israel‚Äôs capital. And for a long time, the lesson was that the threat works, but @realDonaldTrump has changed that by moving the US embassy to #Jerusalem.
What @realDonaldTrump did by moving the US embassy to #Jerusalem was nothing more or nothing less than making Israel the same as every other country where we have an ambassador.
I join Liz McDonald on @RiskRewardFBN at 5pm ET with lots to discuss. Turn it to @FoxBusiness to watch.
Moving the US embassy in Israel to #Jerusalem was the right move by @POTUS. We‚Äôve been living in a delusion by not acknowledging the fact that #Jerusalem is Israel‚Äôs capital.

(2/2) If the Middle East peace process is such a delicate snowflake that moving the U.S. embassy‚Äôs location in Israel to Jerusalem could melt it, one has to doubt how viable it truly is.

The current administration is following Obama‚Äôs policy of treating	terrorist attacks under the law enforcement paradigm.
It was a huge mistake to try to close #GuantanamoBay during the Obama	administration.
My heart goes out to families of victims in today‚Äôs horrific attack in NYC. A reminder that war on terror continues, even within borders.
.@realDonaldTrump has made it clear, in regards to #ISIS, #Iran and #NorthKorea, that Neville Chamberlain does not live in the @WhiteHouse.
It doesn‚Äôt matter how many deals or agreements #Iran engages in, they‚Äôre going to continue their nuclear weapons program.
Iran can sign multiple agreements, but the fact is, they‚Äôre not going to stop until they reach the nuclear capability that North Korea has.

Best wishes to Steve Bannon as he departs the White House and returns to the private sector. Thank you for your service to our country.
Whatever nuclear and missile capabilities #NorthKorea acquires, Iran will be able to purchase and have the next day.
Iran &amp; North Korea have worked together on ballistic missiles for 25 yrs &amp; they likely work together on aspects of nuclear program as well.
More negotiation with #NorthKorea simply means more time for them to increase the size and scope of their nuclear &amp; missile capabilities.

President Trump‚Äôs visit to Israel this week is an excellent way to show the strength of the relationship between our two countries.
President Moon should ignore China‚Äôs calls for dismantling US missile defense system in South Korea.
I hope @POTUS will address his campaign pledge to move the US embassy to Jerusalem during his trip to Israel next week.
For years I've urged the US to place embassy in Jerusalem, which would signify to the world that Jerusalem rightfully belongs to the Jews.

As @POTUS meets with Erdogan, It's important to keep in mind that Putin would like nothing better than to separate Turkey from #NATO.
Disagreement on issues like terrorism, migration, &amp; Russia have sapped Europe's willingness to work effectively with US on global threats.

Yesterday I joined @EricShawnTV on @ANHQDC to discuss Iran. You can watch it here: https://t.co/Mj1sOMN4bA @FoxNews
The serious threat posed by N Korea is direct consequence of 8 yrs of Obama‚Äôs failed foreign policy. "Strategic patience" was bad strategy.
As long as this N Korea regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually happen. Only solution is to reunify the peninsula.
I am joining @TeamCavuto on Your World at 4:00 pm ET. Tune in to @FoxNews for some interesting discussion.
Thoughts are with France today. ISIS has claimed the lives of too many innocents. Hopefully France's next president will step up offensive.
There's no doubt #NorthKorea received substantial support from other State actors over the years, &amp; is likely still getting support today.
When US says "give up your nukes," what N Korea hears is "give up your regime." They view nuclear weapons as tantamount to regime survival.
For years GOP &amp; Dem admins have tried to coerce N Korea to give up their nuclear weapons program through economic sanctions. It has failed.
Great column by @FredFleitz in @FoxNews: "Team Trump and Iran: Obama and the 'swamp' have just scored a huge win". https://t.co/1DFddFa4ji
North Korea is never going to voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons program. It is their ace in the hole. It is their insurance policy.

Obama‚Äôs inaction has had bitter consequences around the globe. Syria is the perfect example. #ObamaFailures
Obama has nearly killed our national missile defense program, weakening military in 8 years of reduced, inadequate budgets. #ObamaFailures
Obama‚Äôs passive approach has facilitated increased nuclear proliferation by rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. #ObamaFailures
Obama left Iraq prematurely then called #ISIS a ‚ÄúJV‚Äù team. Intern'l terrorist threat MUCH worse now than when he took office #ObamaFailures
Obama's passivity enabled China to undertake aggressive military actions and territorial claims in its littoral waters. #ObamaFailures
Obama has made many concessions to #Iran‚Äôs ayatollahs to save the collapsing 2015 nuclear deal #ObamaFailures
Obama agreed to the disastrous #IranNuclearDeal. Iran has since expanded its nuclear proliferation efforts. #ObamaFailures
Russia has grown stronger as Obama‚Äôs failed foreign policies have weakened our influence globally. #Obamafailures
Obama has been reluctant to stand by our closest ally in Middle-East, Israel, to the point that they‚Äôre unsure of our support #ObamaFailures
Obama allowed passage of a harsh, anti-Israel UN Security Council resolution, which caps his destructive relations w/ Israel. #ObamaFailures
In response to #ObamaFarewellSpeech, I'll be tweeting on Obama's top 10 foreign policy failures under hashtag #ObamaFailures. Stay tuned.
The fact is that the world is more disorderly &amp; dangerous now than it was 8 years ago when Obama became president. #ObamaFarewellSpeech

If Obama cedes control of Internet to international body, I predict within 10 yrs, the internet won't be free &amp; will be highly regulated.
Impending transfer of Internet domain control from US supervision to an international body will mean the end of the Internet as we know it.

The Obama admin doesn't understand how countries can have interests adverse to the United States, and why we need to protect them.
The cease-fire agreement in #Syria between the US and #Russia demonstrates much of the futility of the Obama admin‚Äôs foreign policy.
We need a leader who truly understands that our government's most important job is keeping citizens secure from foreign threats.
The explosions in NJ and NYC remind us that we need to be vigilant for threats abroad AND at home.

#Iran has changed neither its policies nor behavior and if they aren't going to change this year, they won't change in any subsequent year.
One year later, as predicted, the notion that the #IranDeal would bring peace &amp; stability to the region has proven to be an illusion.
#HillaryClinton followed Obama's lead getting back to politics amidst a tragedy. The country mourned &amp; she was still on her email scandal.
While #HillaryClinton looks for a VP, the truth is no vice presidental pick will be experienced enough to make up for her lack of integrity.
#Brexit was not about immigration or economics. It was about self-governance. Euro-skepticism is now higher than ever before across the #EU.

How we handle #Iran sends a clear message to #NorthKorea. I am sorry to say, currently, we are failing on handling either one properly.
The next President must be able to tackle foreign policy head-on, so we can protect our citizens from future terrorist attacks on US soil.
Obama‚Äôs mistakes, concessions, and general detachment from the Middle Eastern reality for the last 7.5 years have cost the US a great deal.
#HillaryClinton will support the #IranDeal as written, which is a fundamental misinterpretation of how to deal with proliferators and WMDs.

Obama tries to calm the public by neutralizing emotion. Yet, now's the time to act. He must show he cares about our national security.
