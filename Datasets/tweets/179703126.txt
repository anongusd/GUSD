@obbiecole @MattMurph24 I think 2020 will require “all hands on deck.”  I don’t think either one should run for President, and even though I’m a huge Hillary fan, I don’t think she should either.  But there ARE great roles for all of them IF they’re willing to carve out a niche and advance Team Dem.

@MattMurph24 Bernie and Biden should carve out smaller scale constituencies and educate voters in those demographics about the issues, make them smarter, more informed voters.  Help them understand WHY progressives favor Medicare for all (which did NOT start with Bernie Sanders), etc.
@neeratanden Even on @MSNBC there were many that enabled Trump every time they repeated false information about Hillary, all the call-in chatty time, all the false equivalencies, all the kissy face with Bernie (they didn’t bother to vet him either).  We have to learn from this!
@DesignationSix @Lynnsplace2018 @TomiLahren @SharperImage @FoxNews No, and not just for Christmas—never ever.
@maydaymindy9 @herrick_a No, people that arrogant and narcissistic don’t have friends, just hangers on, and when he has no more money or power, there will be no one, as it should be.  I hope he’s buried in an unmarked grave in a potter’s field.
