@StaceyBeryl @nemosworld @SenJohnThune You claim to be a christian while cheering on a man with five kids from three wives who pays for sex with a porn star the same week his most recent child is born. And you're shaking your head at me? Here's how I think the negotiations should go: You get a wall, churches pay taxes
@StaceyBeryl @nemosworld @SenJohnThune I hope she does. I want to see the day when the church has to back pay all the taxes its been skirting. I think we should be able to jail politicians who attempt to make laws based on 2000 year old book of fairy tales. We can start with Trump though #LockHimUp
@realDonaldTrump ... out of empty cigarette packs ... in prison. #LockHimUp
@Jasmine_Jewels @SpeakerPelosi We'll get it soon enough. Not that you'll change your mind. So far 6 members of Trump's team have pleaded guilty to multiple felonies, 4 serving time. If one Obama staffer had been indicted y'all would've lynched him without a second thought.
@BrendaOBrien408 @SpeakerPelosi Trump did warn us not to elect someone under federal investigation. How do you think people are going to vote in 2020? The party led by a traitor? Or whatever the other option is... Thanks to Trump dems can do whatever they want... #LockHimUp #WhatAboutHerEmails Now?
@SenJohnThune @sdcorn Not like you had anything more pressing.
@RussellMiller @shirlgirl56 @SenJohnThune Good 'ol @RussellMiller - If it's not white it's against the law. Classic conservative values at work. Hey @SenJohnThune I think I found your pastor!
@keithsherburn @SenJohnThune Uh... That comes from the bible. Which modern American conservatives like @SenJohnThune cherry pick. This is line has nothing to do with hating gays, women, or foreigners, and can therefore be safely ignored.
@GOPLeader "My Kevin" He calls you. Stooge.
@jenndreibel @RepDonBacon @GOP He doesn't represent you. You didn't vote for him? His goal is literally to piss you off. It's the GOP way. If they'd really wanted to build a wall they would have done it. This is just a way to piss Dems and have an excuse for not having gotten anything done.
@Ya_Veo @dscc Yup. That sucks. But a wall isn't going to help. Desperate people are going to take desperate measures. That's life. If you're really worried about dumbass parents and dead kids I suppose you're also in support of a handgun ban?

@SenJohnThune @adamweber Keep your faith away from my government. Real leaders lead from the front. They never ask their people to do something they wouldn't. They always put the welfare of their people before personal gain. A real leader would break ranks a put SD first. That's not you.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS The #TrumpShutdown sure is a weird way to fight for the American worker. BTW, Y'all had control of ... everything ... for two years, if building a wall was such a great idea, why didn't you just do it? That's just incompetence. So now you're going to blame... democrats. K.
@MiracleAppy1 @RealJamesWoods Protect the citizens from what?
@Ya_Veo @dscc Steve King says that between  '55 and 2011 25,064 illegals were arrested for homicide. That's about 448 a year. That means that last year, for every 1 murder committed by an illegal alien, 18 vets committed suicide. You know what won't help? Building a dumb ass wall.
@karen_eggleson @tribelaw No. They'll literally just tell their followers "That didn't happen, it's the lugenpresse getting to you again." And conservatives will be like "Oh. Okay. Glad we cleared that up."
As I was a teenager I read about the caning of Sumner and thought "Politicians are so apathetic now. Even violence must have been better than apathy. It can't get worse than apathy." At that moment, a group of future politicians heard that thought and said "Hold my beer."

@Ya_Veo @dscc Maybe. If I were delusional I wouldn't know it. Given the rate of participation in magic man in the sky worship on the right I'd say you're more at risk. Either way, you're afraid of people who would be stopped by a wall. So at least I'm not you.
@irongeek_adc I get that. Feminism never bothered me, likely because it's not about me. What I meant was more that I think those who use the term do so to manipulate the emotions of the listener. It universally brings to mind a distasteful image. The image conjured speaks volumes though.
@Ya_Veo @dscc Haha. It's def. Trump's shutdown. Not just his though. I hold all of the people who voted for him accountable. #TrumpShutdown #ConservativeShutdown #ChristianShutdown #LookAtAmericaWeAreMakingAHugeDealOfHowAfraidOfMexicoWeAre
@irongeek_adc When anyone says virtue signaler the first thing I picture is Christian conservative, screaming about the evils of homosexuality, Mexicans, and science... In support of a man with 5 kids from 3 marriages, who brags about assaulting women and pays to plow porn stars.
@RepDonBacon Stop worrying about  the SOTU and start representing your constituents. Grabbing land from Americans to build a wall can wait, let's get the folks their pay checks.
@RandPaul A suicide bomber killed some of our troops, what do we do? Uh, let's just claim we won and GTFO? This is a lie like everything else that comes from conservatives these days. Meanwhile, thousands of Americans go without pay. I'm not  impressed.
@Anonymo26011986 @Dwalt @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Protecting them from what? The subset of criminals willing to hurt a person, but draw a moral line at finding a way around a wall? A wall protects no one. The conservative sheep are being made to believe in a wolf that doesn't exist.
@SenJohnThune @paultenhaken It's interesting to me that you set the record for cash taken from internet service providers in return for legislation, and now have a sudden burning desire to "bring the worlds fastest internet ..." How does that work? Do you have a sales department?
@SteveKingIA You have a storied history of blatantly racial remarks. You finally pissed off your own people. Also, freedom of speech you have, and you exercised carelessly, now you are experiencing consequences. The fact that you don't know the difference means you're unfit to lead.
@shovas @DorsaAmir Hahaha... Hey guys I heard you were talking about how stuff works and trying to understand the universe! Here's some total bullshit that somebody made up, for which I have no evidence, and no reasonable explanation for my own belief. Buuuut I'm gonna argue anyway.
@SwiftOnSecurity If enough of us claim there's a wall he'll start repeating it. I can hear it now "People are saying, lots of people you know, important people... people are saying, in an article I read, on tv, that the wall I built is the best wall, better than Hillary's emails..."
@Anonymo26011986 @Dwalt @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I don't feel unsafe. And anyone who might be a threat to me isn't going to be stopped by a wall. The cowards want a wall to protect themselves from a villain that doesn't exist. It's a show of fear and weakness. Shameful really.
@Anonymo26011986 @Dwalt @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump See, conservatives can only act in the face of an imaginary enemy. No desire to help others. No desire to do good. There has to be a bad guy to motivate them, oh and the bad guy has to be make believe, they back down from any real adversary. That's why they need a wall. Fear.
@scrowder You believe. You don't get to belief through logic. You don't need evidence, bc no amount of evidence can dissuade beliefs. Only you can change your mind. I don't think you have it in you to be honest with yourself. Let alone us. #ChangeMyMind
@Dwalt @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Less than one wall. The $5B is to build about 215 mi of wall, roughly 9% of the border. Alternatively we could fix the water in Flint, feed homeless vets, fight the opiate epidemic... oh wait, that would be helping Americans, we wouldn't want that.
@RussellMiller @jacobysmom2 @SenJohnThune ONLY? As of Dec 2018 there were 23,400 homeless vets in the united states. At per diem rates we could feed every one of them 3 meals a day for a year for a little less than $200 M (3% of $5B). But that would be helping people, something only "liberals" are interested in.
@SenJohnThune You know that your voting base in SD is blaming you for their empty pantries right? Time to put on your big boy pants and stand up for the people you're supposed to serve. No one elected you to represent Texas or Trump. Do your job.
@JohnBoozman There is ample precedent for waiting until after the midterm elections with confirmation hearings. I'd expect you'll fight for the American voter to have an opportunity to express our desires through the democratic process?
@senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley @SenateGOP @senjudiciary @JohnCornyn @SenMikeLee @SenThomTillis Voters should have a say in the supreme court. Hold the appointment until after the midterms. Seems there's precedent for that.

@RepDeSantis Pro Trump president Trump is obstructing justice because he doesn't want to answer questions or be held accountable. Pathetic.
@senorrinhatch @YahooNews What happened to needing to wait until after the elections to appoint a justice? Voters should get a say right? Or was that only a solid argument when Republicans benefit?

@MaxineBowden @TeamCavuto @SenJohnThune Obama enacted a zero tolerance policy mandating that families be separated? Can you point to that policy? I only ask because I can show you a video of Jeff Sessions claiming that god has granted him the right to enact a policy that he describes in exactly those terms...
