@thehill The Wall Street Journal is a mouthpiece for guess who...... Wall St. Not saying that they don‚Äôt do great journalistic work over there, but we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when they get defensive. @AOC is a threat to the shady practices on Wall St that have caused the middle class grief

@CNNPolitics CNN should stop reporting on his ridiculous rallies. By continuing to show up at his absurd dog and pony shows, you‚Äôre allowing more easily manipulated people to hear his awful policies
@nytimes Best of luck to Kerri Evelyn Harris tonight!
