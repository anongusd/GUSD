The "reset" argument appeals to Democrats exhausted by Trump era and nostalgic for Obama years. But underestimating anger in base and desire for radical change can be risky, given lessons of 2016

During the travel ban oral argument, 3 different justices (including Kennedy) offered hypotheticals about a politician peddling hateful bigotry on the campaign trail https://t.co/YbBKuTm1Bk https://t.co/PSbyp760wx
@nffcnnr not President Trump, just candidate Trump
Saying he would considering closing down mosques, calling Muslims "sick people," falsely claiming he saw "thousands" of Muslims cheer in NJ during the 9/11 attacks
The solicitor general argued today that anything the president said about Muslims on the campaign trail is "out of bounds" in deciding whether the travel ban is discriminatory. Here's a sample of what that includes: https://t.co/UjgYmPwOVd
Key Roberts q: ‚ÄúWhat if the military advisors tell the president that, in their judgment, the president ought to order an air strike against Syria...Does that mean he can't because you would regard that as discrimination against a majority Muslim country?‚Äù
Kennedy was very skeptical of Hawaii's argument that ban not having end date made it illegal: "You want the president to say Im convinced in 6 months we'll have a safe world?"
Also by my count ‚ÄúTWEETS‚Äù was said twice, you‚Äôre welcome
Hawaii‚Äôs lawyer spent most of his time arguing Trump was exceeding authority and overstepping congress, delayed establishment clause argument as long as possible
The SG conceded that would likely be unconstitutional, if that hypothetical president asked his staff to craft a ‚Äúlegal‚Äù ban on Jewish people
Kagan asked govt to address a scathing hypothetical in which a candidate makes virulently anti Semitic statements and then once in office bans travel from Israel citing national security
Hawaii‚Äôs lawyer conceded that if Trump had completely disavowed his desire for a muslim ban they would not have a case on establishment clause, no matter what he said during the campaign
Justice Kennedy seemed somewhat interested in the establishment clause claims in travel ban oral argument but suggested only family members of banned people would have standing

I think if these senators want more support for this bill, they're going to need to add more skills visas
So it‚Äôs making system ‚Äúskills based‚Äù solely by subtracting a huge # of family green cards, not re-directing current green cards to skills
