@FunAndNormal @rtlingl yeah wiz of oz was a disappointment to me too, after all the hype - not hating it, but... something of a disappointment
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal what was the mission impossible "in-joke", if it's not indiscrete?	(i'm quite a fan of the franchise, minus the recent overlength)
@FunAndNormal @rtlingl it's easily in my top 5 - &amp; i'm not a specifically old movies guy, i watch lots n lots of new stuff too - but the story &amp; script &amp; cast is just still hard to beat, even today
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal always liked val - still do
@FunAndNormal @rtlingl you're a ...well... right-wing person, &amp; haven't seen gone with the wind?? üòÄ
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal she's kind of a femynyst (or at least independent woman, very liz taylor), marries into this rich trad texas cattle clan - has her struggles - but gradually SUBMITS, &amp; in the end wouldn't ever have had it any other way :)	like taming of the shrew, w liz &amp; rich burton - but texas!
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal very trad, btw, that one, through &amp; through - not the least of its charms :)
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal gone with the wind is almost 4 hrs... i wouldn't say time flies - but you don't want it to be a moment shorter - 	or "giant" is a movie many find boring &amp; are meh about, but i loved - story goes on forever, covers almost the "lifetime" of the protagonists:	https://t.co/PPH0prRHyj
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal eg i didn't think inception was a minute too long - i would have liked it to go on	(that was also lenny d, incidentally)
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal @Lov3Aesthetics well, there are some you just want to last forever... 3 hours, &amp; you're still hungry when they stop
@FunAndNormal @rtlingl @Lov3Aesthetics sometimes all you need is to cut 10-15 min by targeted 30 sec cuts here &amp; there to make the pace pick up (i know that from book &amp; article writing - a global 5% length cut works astounding *miracles*) - but they no longer seem able to "kill their darlings"
@FunAndNormal @rtlingl @Lov3Aesthetics i wouldn't say quite 2 hrs too long, but the tendency to make overly extended movies is becoming more &amp; more common, even w otherwise strong movies, - such as wolf of ws, or decent action movies like the latest mission impossibles - brevity used to be a hollywood art

@rtlingl @FunAndNormal @Lov3Aesthetics in fact you could say the movie degnerates as he degenerates - he's way best when on top, &amp; still hungry :)
@rtlingl @FunAndNormal @Lov3Aesthetics oh yes - i'm sorta meh (or meh+) about it, it was a little long, &amp; the later part degenerated, as with most modern hollywood movies	but the first half is very, very strong, &amp; had me completely spellbound
@FunAndNormal @rtlingl @Lov3Aesthetics i piously quoted matthew 18:12 when i "took him back" after his recent recanting (pseudo-recanting?) of nevertrump	but it seems, just as there are #fakenews, there are #fakelostsheep :)	lesson learned...

@beyondreasdoubt @molratty if the right were to make a blocklist (not popular on our side afaik), a list criterion might be "everyone who follows beto + some antifa group + media matters" - that would avoid lots of trolls for us (but also result in blind angles - so the whole thing is quite self-defeating)
@beyondreasdoubt @molratty blocklists are software/services which, if subscribed to, block a bunch of people for you automatically	(&amp; said "bunch of people" blocked is generally determined by who those folks themselves follow	say you follow cerno + nick fuentes - that's often enough to end on a blocklist)

@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead oh, this is for a bigger discussion than i'm capable of...	i just try to do my best right here, poasting political scandals &amp; tactical advances
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead well i'm an optimist, as i believe that (almost) everything will now become reversed, via a rapid acceleration of reaction, that we're at the brink of experiencing	but i understand pessimists, bc if that acceleration &amp; reversal doesn't happen... then yes, things don't look good
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead yes - denmark is quite advanced - stunningly advanced, in fact, in some select areas - but very, very discrete internationally about it - also the advance is not in all areas - &amp; our demographics have changed dramatically nonetheless - &amp; still change
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead me? i'm from denmark - but i grew up french-speaking, &amp; fell accidentally, via the internet (&amp; my bourgeois, underused twitter account) across the french pro-family mass demos in 2013 - couldn't let it go, &amp; the rest has grown from that

@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead no - it's never a safe bet, i know, each election &amp; situation is different... but asynchronous regionalism introduces interesting new dynamics &amp; troll/chaos possibilities :)
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead i would agree, but remember that germany has asynchronous state/regional elections, just like spain... &amp; like i said, you just saw what happened in andalusia... for germany, see eg saxony, &amp; bavaria, both quite advanced in populism (or populist ideas co-optation (bavaria))
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead (comparable to what you (spain) just experienced regionally, in andalusia)
@mamadougarcia97 @KettilsMead france will be a while yet...	any country without proportional representation (uk, france, us) is severely challenged - unless there's a billionaire trump!	austria &amp; germany are more interesting - their proport representation has forced the "normal" right to evolve on migration
@KettilsMead i was very disappointed by the 2 centrist parties' betrayal - tbh i would have expected a shitty-but-working right-compromise a la norway, which has an analogous situation w 2 small cuck centrist parties - so yes... swedes must be patient a little longer yet - sad!
RT @mamadougarcia97: @europesperance vox is similar to Orban in hungary, is its reference
@KettilsMead wouldn't know - i'd say ecr has a (slightly) softer &amp; more pragmatic/ collaborative profile, which would go well with the vox branding, which imo is the slickest among populists in europe (&amp; i like slick - it wins!) - but again, i simply don't know the inner dynamics well enough
spain shouldn't have started taking in all those migrants... that germany &amp; italy no longer want		shoulda looked to what way populism went in germany &amp; italy after *those* two had been mad enough to take the migrants		¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø		(i'm starting to think fall 2015 was a blessing)

more to the point - i made the explicit resolve today that i now refuse to follow, relay, support, or even merely LOOK at someone defending such passive surrender	i view it as irresponsibility, a form of betrayal	&amp; a betrayal that has come close to getting me &amp; my mine massacred https://t.co/G0itestPq9

i think much of the confusion stems from hardliners superstitiously believing that if they use words like "racism" they magically absorb some of the properties of a concept they view with deep suspicion	i make no such claim	i take no explicit stand on such concepts 1/2
mocking, as you call it, is fine too, i definitely count that in - whatever trolling will work	...&amp; this is ALL trolling	&amp; what is trolling? passive-aggressive, asymetric warfare, of the weak (us) vs the now dominant - who became dominant precisely by mastering passive aggression https://t.co/na9GaSvXZ6

@SekretSila @OldBookClub yes &amp; the 1st century civil wars already drained them, which is why i find it so entirely bizarre &amp; out of character that spengler ("LE mr. authority" in civilizational decline) dates rome's "greatness" almost exactly from that time - it baffles me completely!! üòÇ
@SekretSila @OldBookClub two of my greatest roman heroes are cincinnatus &amp; torquatus manlius, which are 5th &amp; 4th centuries respectively - way before the also indisputable, but already more showy, greatness of the fabii, cato, &amp; scipiones

@OldBookClub i'm mystified as to why spengler - who rightly regards his "cesarism" (&amp; by implication the corruption of healthy political mechanisms that leads to it) as a late-stage phenomenon - would write something like this
@OldBookClub he's not all wrong about the latter part, but completely off-track as to the republic	the true glory of the republic was precisely in the century of the first 2 punic wars - perhaps somewhat earlier too...
@AscendedBastard i hadn't quite thought about that aspect	her "analysis" is indeed spectacularly, myopically, one-dimensional
