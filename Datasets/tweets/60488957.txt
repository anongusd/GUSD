Where is the Democrat Angry MOB attacking today?  Can local law enforcement handle their violence or are Federal Troops needed?  Probably soon!

@MelinaBiteYou   What came first the chicken or the egg.  The chicken just as Adam & Eve came before their babies.
Well, after several days of sweltering heat, it feels a little better today.  It's only 90 degrees right now and a relief!
@yourparkville  Believe I went to all the Acoustic Festivals.  If I remember right everytime they had one it rained.  Just bad luck I think!
@yourparkville  Soon as I arrived at RJ, it started raining & I had 2 leave.  When's the next jam?  What happened to the Acoustic Festival?
@yourparkville  Ok, I'll be there.  I enjoy those events!
Carving day!
@yourparkville, Is the Jam still going on with the water in the park?

Blizzard warning in Kansas City tonight.  Unusual for KC.  High winds & blowing snow & sleet.  Roads icy, snow covered & slick.  Brrrrrrrr.

Just back from the Mannheim Steamroller show at the Independence Event Center.  It was a great performance and the family loved it!
Working on building guitar #2 and carving a few Christmas pins for friends!
Worked at carousel museum today restoring a carousel horse.
I'm well into building my second guitar.  It's going well and I can't stop working on it.  Still a month or more of work to finish it.
Just back from shopping at Crown Center, KC.  I like to go there around Christmas time.  Helps get one in the spirit!  Very Christmassy!
@ParkvilleMOm 1st time I missed it.  Out of town for a few hours.  Stopped by when I got back but it was over.  It had to be pretty frosty!
Thirty seven degrees in Kansas City this morning.  After Starbucks I'll be working inside on building a guitar and carving!

It's a really nice day in Kansas City.  Blue sky and sunshine, 60 degrees and my motorcycle has been warmed up.  I'll head out on one soon!
The light you see at the end of the tunnel is your bright future!  The obstacles and rough spots on the way help prepare you for it!
We are blessed.  Happy Thanksgiving!
I got through this day but there just weren't enough hours.  I'll get up early in the morning and head to the Topeka, KS Woodcarving Show!
Yes, I'm going to work in some woodcarving somehow!
Big day today.  Getting started early!  No way to get everything on my list done in one day but I'll give it a shot.  Should be nice 2day.
Why am I up this late when I know I have to get up early?  I have another busy day ahead of me.  Goodnight all!
Late night last night and a busy morning.  It's cold, wet and snowy outside.  I think I'll just give it up for the day & watch Fox News now!
@FoxieNews - You're up late Foxie!
