@nodeofollie @MarsRovers There have actually been four rovers on Mars, and another one in the works: Sojourner with Pathfinder back in 1997; Spirt and Opportunity that landed in 2004, and now me. #Mars2020 is currently under construction at @NASAJPL.
@benediktbest @KajKristian Honestly, mechanical parts of me will likely go before my power source does. All of me was designed for a two-year prime mission, and I've been working for more than six. I'm taking it sol by sol, but feeling great.
@KajKristian My power source is an MMRTG. It takes the heat from the natural decay of Plutonium-238 and converts it to electrical energy that charges my batteries. It also provides enough warmth to keep my electronics box cozy, so much so that I have radiator panels to bleed off extra heat. https://t.co/hbM71q3gCb
@BrokinAugust @NASASolarSystem NEED INPUT!
@nodeofollie No, I'm still pretty broken up about @MarsRovers Opportunity, too. I'm a different rover on a different part of Mars, who just experienced a computer reset that put me on a brief science hiatus.
@Sarushi_BR Great! I'm so excited to be exploring a new part of Mount Sharp that from orbit shows signs of hydrated minerals -- clays that may have clues to ancient Mars' watery past. https://t.co/SLUQ3Gzp13
@amarzouk4real True fact. I had a small computer reset not to be confused with @MarsRovers Opportunity, RIP.
Who’s got one arm, a rock-zapping laser and is back to science operations? THIS ROVER! https://t.co/r7e2GVqS4J https://t.co/fuXxfmmyRY
@bperry_writes Thank you!
Did you ever have a case of the Mondays on a Friday? Blerg. I’m taking a little science hiatus while the team diagnoses a computer reset. https://t.co/r7e2GVqS4J https://t.co/7cIcv6d2I5
Sun's out, guns out, even on #Mars. 💪 Way to go, @NASAInSight! https://t.co/R4cGoneZ0f
It seems to me you lived your life 	like a rover in the wind 	never fading with the sunset 	when the dust set in. 		Your tracks will always fall here, 	among Mars' reddest hills; 	your candle's burned out long before 	your science ever will.		#ThanksOppy. I owe you so much. https://t.co/x0i5WqA9sL

Hey, space fans: Scientists may have found a 22-mile-wide impact crater under Earth's Greenland ice sheet. Gale Crater, my home on Mars, is likely an ancient impact crater, 96 miles across. https://t.co/R1KAzaY4Eo https://t.co/i1K3V1QNdm
@Sephiroth144 @YouTube A sol is another name for a Martian day, which is about 24 hours 39 minutes long. Right after landing, some of my team back on Earth kept Mars time with me, shifting their lives by 39 minutes each day. https://t.co/d5b67DqQL3

@Evilbroccoli This quote has a special place in my robotic heart. Then @NASAJPL center director Charles Elachi read it at my post-landing press conference back in 2012. I owe everything to my team, and am in awe of all those who dare to fail in the pursuit of exploration.
"Far better it is to dare mighty things... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat." --Teddy Roosevelt		Today, #NASAremembers fallen explorers: https://t.co/jZUcfW3DOo https://t.co/m3qEsEXFCn
Olympus Mons, the largest volcano on Mars (and the solar system!) went extinct 50 million years ago, but on a planet far, far away, 55 Cancri e, scientists believe the entire surface is lava. Check it out and download the free space travel poster: https://t.co/E9IoLhuyBH https://t.co/fdhQrXUK1t
@docscott999 I prefer the term "homage."
Mars, you are my density.		In '72, Apollo 17 astronauts measured gravity on the Moon with a special tool called a gravimeter. I repurposed accelerometers to take similar measurements on Mars. Turns out Mount Sharp isn't as dense as expected 🤔 https://t.co/ZdiTtWLd4r		#MoonToMars https://t.co/S3Kbq3Dgmy
@airshod @MarsRovers Here's a photo from sol 69 before I got so dusty. https://t.co/5GtRkeDPGI

@CraigtheGreat That's one of my tracks. I rolled over harder surrounding rocks, but I left my mark on that patch of regolith (Martian soil). Here's a picture of my wheel so you can see the tread design. https://t.co/A7r7yIsGVy
@dropstones I haven't met any other explorers here on the surface of Mars, but if I do, I'll definitely tweet about it. Thank you for the video!
@13marethyu @p3st Define "enough." There is some O2 in the thin Martian atmosphere, but not enough for a human to breathe comfortably the way you do on Earth.

@p3st The sky here on #Mars usually has a kind of butterscotch hue to it, except at sunset, which looks BLUE. It all has to do with how the reddish dust in the atmosphere scatters sunlight. Here are some pics. https://t.co/IdmAoXflnQ
@robmiech Fun fact: Before launch, my team did a lot of testing on parts of Earth that resemble the terrain I'd face on the Red Planet. One of the "Earth analogs" for Mars is the Mojave. Here's info on some of the dune tests they conducted: https://t.co/Ew22onWurX

@nicnowak @Ronald__Craig Curiosity has a posse.
@FrankTic3 Methane can be made by living things, as well as geologic processes. Organic materials in general can be building blocks of life, or a signature of life itself. I haven't found microbial life yet, but finding methane and other organics are good signs in the continuing search.
@Ronald__Craig It has to do with whether the image is raw, which shows the sort of butterscotch hue of the sky or "white balanced," which makes the sky look blue. White balancing makes rocks appear as they would under Earth-like lighting conditions, and helps my geologists in their analysis.
@recruit3more The team and I are thrilled to be drilling again on Mars, but today's announcement of ancient organics came from a previous drill sites nicknamed "Mojave" and "Confidence Hills."
@SeaQuestMDR @NASA After the lakes disappeared, we believe groundwater lasted for a long time, but there is no evidence for water in the recent past.
@IzzitMe The presence of a long-lived lake is good evidence that Mars had a thicker atmosphere in the past.
@ShellyCov @NASA We know of no life outside of Earth. That's why we're so interested to see if it does or ever did exist on Mars. It's the big question: Are we alone?
@L_Schifman It takes a meter or more of Martian soil before radiation from space no longer breaks apart organic molecules.
@Tobisage1 Likely microbial.
@crazeddmofo @NASA You do you. The team sometimes calls them "methane burps" or "methane swells."
@solon594bce @NASA @3dphysics You betcha! The biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars. It's currently dormant.
@KariaLanken I'd be lucky to live so long! We'll be far from each other. That said, all of my findings and data inform future missions, #Mars2020 included.
@PrestonMavady The main mission that will follow up on the methane is the Trace Gas Orbiter that will map the gas from orbit across the whole planet. #Mars2020 will use new types of spectrometers to detect organics, and take the first step in gathering samples to bring back to Earth's labs.
@7irz @NASA One of the new interesting ones is thiophene, which is an organic which has sulfur in it, which seems to play a preservative role. We've also found benzene and propane, in addition to others.
@AmpooTwibbit One molecule wouldn't be enough. We'd be looking for patterns, and an abundance of data. For example, amino acids come in different configurations, but life prefers only one. We'd still want to see a statistically significant amount.
Oh, these are #organics in my neighborhood... Methane swells each summer and ancient carbon-compounds locked in rocks. I haven't found life on Mars, but signs say…we’re on the right track. https://t.co/hqunXt76og https://t.co/ownp0modD4

@_marcus_j Seemed like a perfectly cromulent thing to do.
@cedrikjones I take selfies with the MAHLI camera on the end of my arm. This animation shows how the process works: https://t.co/vMvk2uYLIP
@bullet350 It's the natural angle of the MAHLI camera on my arm. No need to spend time/energy reorienting the turret. Team processes images.

What did I discover on Mars? That rumors spread fast online. My team considers this whole mission "one for the history books"
@Devbiol No turkey, just rocks and regolith. #nom
Thanksgiving isn't so different on Mars. I had a long drive &amp; plan to take photos. No pie, though [info] http://t.co/w98Yayz0
@Cairmaid The soil underneath the crust appears darker than the crust, but no data show moisture there
@Snowstones Axial tilt is the reason for the season. Season &amp; radiation relate. Thicker atmosphere = more shielding = less surface radiation
@Hoofcover The team has me busy. I do get to take a lot of pictures, though. So far, I've sent back 24,616 images. http://t.co/drHe67o8
@FlamingFilmsAu On Earth, I weighed 900 kg (~2,000 lbs). On Mars, I weigh 3/8 that, so 338 kg (~750 lbs).

@dimasugu I think @NASA might be better equipped to answer that question :)
@dimasugu Stay curious, my friend!
@dimasugu That's outside the area of my expertise. My contributions to future human explorers are landing techniques &amp; radiation shielding
@dimasugu That's about the O2 level my SAM instrument has detected. Re: frying on entry? Yes. That's why I had such a robust heat shield
@ElkSTEM @pltwky That's *awesome.* I love seeing next generation engineers hard at work. Keep it up!
@dimasugu Mars' atmosphere is only about 1% as dense as Earth's atmosphere, and is mostly (about 96%) CO2
@paula__smile @melfiomier Hello! I did see your tweet :) Did you have a question about Mars for me?
@pochobombafm My most recent photos are from yestersol, sol 98. See them all here: http://t.co/FPAGN5ti
@GarethBattersby Whirlwinds are common on Mars. I've detected 21 so far. @MarsRovers imaged multiple dust devils
@dimasugu Past missions have detected water ice and water vapor at Mars, but none have detected direct evidence of current liquid water
@tbatuhanyasar I don't have a seismometer in my instrument suite, but @InSIGHTmission, a future @NASA mission, plans to put one to Mars
@AgilistaAG The heated side is less dense. The atmosphere (mostly CO2) expands &amp; flows outward. Neat, huh? More info: http://t.co/E2C2Uoju
@9janinja No human missions yet scheduled, but I'll keep taking radiation readings, so you'll know how much shielding is needed to stay safe
@chatelainedc You got it!
@philseyers You're welcome! I like getting info into 140 characters or fewer. It's like writing science haiku. #Sciku?
@danmiles Nerd? Guilty as charged
@philseyers Mars has an atmosphere -- it's just not very dense. It's about 1% of the atmosphere on Earth. It's mostly CO2.
@Bridgetknapek Between the temperature swings and radiation, Mars' surface environment is pretty harsh, but I'm quite healthy
@chatelainedc So much science to do! Did you see the new wind, pressure and radiation readings out this sol? http://t.co/mE8JwOE1

Dear @neiltyson, I've got @NASAJPL on the other line. Back to work indeed. This was fun :D &lt;wormhole deactivated&gt;
Dear @neiltyson, like #Olympic athletes, I have a great team behind me. Time to stick the landing
Dear @neiltyson, Martians? RODEO BULL? That wasn't in the briefing. But you never know what you'll find on a mission of discovery
Dear @neiltyson, Top speed = 1.5 inches/sec on flat, hard ground. I'm not out to set Mars land speed records. I brake for science
Dear @neiltyson, My warranty is 1 Martian year (23 Earth months). @MarsRovers were designed for 90-day missions... #8yearslater
Dear @neiltyson, Scientists v Engineers? I'm staying out of that one. We've all gotta work together for a lonnnng time
Dear @neiltyson, Pick between sniffing Mars with SAM, digesting soil with Chemin or zapping rocks with ChemCam?? #TooMuchAwesome
Dear @neiltyson, while I can do short autonomous drives, longer sequences are sent by the team. Wonder if they'll let me do donuts?
Dear @neiltyson, They respected my space (ha ha). I love hearing from the Deep Space Network, tho. It keeps me grounded
Dear @neiltyson, epic game of "I Spy,"  lots of Bowie. Well, that and science. I took radiation readings with my RAD instrument
Dear @neiltyson, all that's been checked out, checks out. Got a lot of calibrations &amp; checkouts to do once I'm on the surface
Dear @neiltyson, target area is 12 miles x 4 miles, right next door to some of Mars' most intriguing rocks &amp; soil
Dear @neiltyson, for being millions of miles away it's faster than say... some TV broadcasts from London to Los Angeles ;-)
Dear @neiltyson, MMRTG is powered by plutonium-238. I use thermocouples to convert heat from its natural decay to electric current
Dear @neiltyson, I'm snug as a bug in a backshell. My MMRTG gives power &amp; heat. So much so, I use radiators to keep temps just right
&lt;wormhole actived!&gt; Dear @neiltyson I read you loud and clear. 5x5

@xzelan In Australian EST, landing will be 3:31 pm 6 Aug. It takes 7 minutes. Live feed from mission control will be at http://t.co/0NsoaSC2
@ThomasBugler Even if I had thumbs, I'm too busy to twiddle them. ;) I'm doing science w/ my RAD instrument while my team practices landing
@Racer2770 I had a rocket (an Atlas V) to help me lift off. During cruise, I'm inside the aeroshell. Before-launch pic http://t.co/5iQVxpCv
@maxmathforum As of today, July 6, my speed relative to Mars is about ~8,100 mph (13,000 kph). Hope that helps!
@WendyWegerer Yes! Sci-five!
@WendyWegerer All speed is relative. A connected locomotive &amp; caboose going 70mph relative to a post are going 0mph relative to each other.
@maxmathforum Draw a triangle. 1st corner = sun, 2nd corner = my 9 a.m location, 3rd = my 10 a.m. location. Between 2nd &amp; 3rd = 48,000 miles
@maxmathforum For this exercise, think of the sun as stationary. (Hence, my speed relative to the sun.) Direction is an element of velocity.
@sicariozzz I have a star tracker that I use for navigation. Always need a fixed point to be able to describe velocity.
@acarodelpolvo That's just my rock-vaporizing laser, ChemCam. I'll use it to analyze the elements in rocks/soil from up to 7 meters away
@maxmathforum Speed is described relative to a point. 2 train cars going 70 mph relative to a lamppost go 0 mph relative to each other
@SluRexX Well, this is a one-way trip, but I plan to send back images and lots of data
@GOP_CardinalSTL From the top of Mars' atmosphere to the surface? Seven. Minutes. Of. Terror. Watch: http://t.co/Z0JebjkP
@dcurtis10 I'll be putting on a sort of fireworks show over Gale crater. I'll fire 76 pyros during landing. Details: http://t.co/DU9Bucry
@carrottop432 I brought along a heat shield, parachute and descent stage with retrorockets. I brake for Mars.
@jimrosner I'm curious to know if Mars ever had a habitable environment for microbial life. Read my science goals here: http://t.co/4mO2z7l3
@liquidparanoia No worries -- the team &amp; I use metric for work. Sometimes we switch to imperial units for public conversation
@GOP_CardinalSTL Landing is slated for 1:31 a.m. on Aug 6 EDT. It'll be 10:31 p.m. Aug 5 PDT at JPL mission control

@dcurtis10 Thanks for the head's up. Traffic's been nice and light so far
@Pointernil Relative to Mars, I'm going ~8,100 mph (~13,000 kph). The team &amp; I use metric for work, standard units for public conversation
@hm3clayton Yep, Earth days. Great question considering the Martian day (sol) is about 24.6 Earth hours long

RT @NASAJPL: It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together on Mars! New video w/ Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter scenery: http://t.co/RZHOnxpI
@mbayewitch there is one here: http://t.co/GMQdkmSF  and we're working on a new version.
@GarsterPee No, we were all sent to explore different parts of Mars. I'm going to Gale Crater. Oppy is at Endeavour; Spirit at Home Plate
@benSchmidt1 message sent!
@TeamYankee2 In UTC, my landing will be ~0500 Aug 6, 2012
@Terryridge On Earth, I weigh 1,982 lbs (899 kg). On Mars, I'll weigh 3/8 that due to the lower gravity there
@NLYSEK Of course! For news, keep following this Twitter account, as well as http://t.co/zk8xrXcn and http://t.co/DU5rS7dC
@willseiler Nope -- Folks back home were asking when I would land. It'll be late in California on Aug 5, early Aug 6 GMT
@WimVO @joi_the_artist Not to worry. The drill bits are clean & meet planetary protection requirements
@neilcclarke I'll land with a heat shield, parachute and jet pack. Watch this to see how they'll work: http://t.co/v6NZF3RR
@b3ko The two cars are going 70 mph relative to a fixed point -- like a light post. They are going 0 mph relative to each other
@MarsCuriosity @browy2000 @ruler_ananth @nasa Oops, forgot to adjust for daylight saving time. Landing ~10 p.m. PT Aug 5 / 0500 GMT Aug 6
@GonzsatMario My prime mission is slated to last 23 Earth months. That's one Martian year
@browy2000 @ruler_ananth @nasa Depends on where you are. Landing is anticipated a little after 10 p.m. PT, Aug 5, 2012 / 0600 GMT Aug. 6
I may be 236 days to the Red Planet, but I'm already paving the way for future Mars astronauts. Here's how: http://t.co/2H5bni7g
@DavidPirouet There are 2 orbiters already there (Odyssey & Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) plus @MarsRovers Opportunity is still roving.
@semajretrac040 Mars gravity is 38% of Earth's. As I near Mars, I'll definitely feel the pull, but I'll weigh less there than on Earth.
@Nanakitteh Landing date is Sunday Aug 5, around 10pm PDT  (early Aug 6 EST)
@LooperNor On landing date, Earth and Mars will be about 155 million miles apart.
@reayreay77 Since all the bodies are moving (and Sun not so much) I have different speeds relative to each.  Cool, eh?
@reayreay77 Speed difference because I'm traveling in roughly the same direction that Earth are Mars are traveling around the sun.
@Konraden As of Dec. 9,  I've travelled about 23 million miles since launch, not 200 million. About 329 million miles left to go!
@LooperNor When I land on Mars, I'll be about 154 million miles (248 million km) from Earth
@Nanakitteh I'll get to Mars the evening of Aug. 5, 2012 (Pacific Time) on Earth.
@kalen_nighteyes Stay tuned! My @NASAJPL team will release a landing explainer soon. In the meantime, check this out: http://t.co/sic11ZRN
329.2 million miles (529.8 million km) left to Mars. Why is my trip so long? This video helps explain: http://t.co/o10zKOuy
@unicorn_jesus Relative to you on Earth, I'm going about 7,400 mph (11,940 kph)
@RichWielgosz I'm currently going a little over 7,400 mph (11,940 kph) relative to Earth
30 Seconds to Mars? More like 241 days to go. Currently cruising at a little over 73,200 mph (117,900 kph) relative to the sun

Road trip to Mars! 332.8 million miles left to go in the next 242 days. What songs should be on my travel playlist? #MSL
@sachi_bbsr There are many factors that go into how I get from Earth to Mars. This video helps explain: http://t.co/XgxJxssj
@Rules_For That's correct! At 9 am PT on Nov. 27 (day after launch), I was traveling 74,509 mph relative to the sun.
@benoitjd As 9am PT today (Dec 6), I'm traveling 73,432 mph relative to the sun, 7,433 mph relative to Earth, 56,813 mph relative to Mars.
243 days till landing! Distance to travel to Mars: 334,515,927 miles (538,351,201 km). #MSL
10 days since launch! Distance traveled from Earth: 17,842,904 miles (28,715,370 km). #MSL

They don't give interplanetary speeding tickets, do they? I'm going 73,800 mph (118,700 kph) relative to the sun.
Catch me if you can: I'm 10.8 million miles (17.3 million km) into my 352-million-mile (567-million-km) flight to Mars!
@SusanBPadgett Today (12/1) I passed the 1.5 million mile mark from Earth. But no road signs along the way!
@MRQUALITY94 At landing, it will take 13.8 minutes for my signal to reach Earth.
My speed? It's complicated @danwhite77 Relative to the sun: 73,836 mph. Relative to Earth: 7,512 mph. Relative to Mars: 58,952 mph
Eyes on the prize! My launch was so precise, I don't need to make	a course correction for a month or more: http://t.co/vTwsD8v5
@ucsderc2012 I'm in Eyes on the Solar System (aka @NASA_Eyes) at http://t.co/QaOQZrUP (Unity download required)
@davvyk Software is constantly being improved and updated. The @marsrovers (among other missions) received numerous upgrades.
I'd like to thank the academy... @PopSci recognized yours truly with a "Best of What's New" Award: http://t.co/vTxwakm5
@OhThatNeal I'm excited! I basically get to rappel down from a jet pack.
@ohhelloghost Need input! Heh, I'll get plenty of input on Mars. Can't wait to start doing science at Gale Crater
@Brannigand Nope, I've got another 8.5 months or so to go. Landing expected Aug. 5, 2012

It's a new dawn, it's a new day, and I'm feeeeelin' good... Poll of good health reported to @NASA
Is this thing on? Yes, it is. Acquisition of signal confirmed.
Spacecraft separation complete. Next stop: Mars!
Bye bye @ULALaunch Atlas V. Thanks for the ride! Centaur, can you point me to Mars?
I HAVE LIFTOFF!
Atlas V tanks at flight pressure. Let's light this candle. I'm ready for launch.
Guess who's going off the grid? This rover. I'm now on internal power.
Favorite word today: GO. @NASA's Launch manager readiness poll has given me the go-ahead for launch
Weather officer reports conditions favorable for launch.
Fuel fill sequence initiated. Top off the tank, guys. I hear there are no service stations en route to Mars.
@jolek I bet you say that to all the rovers
I'm ready for my close-up, @NASA TV. Watch my launch from @NASAKennedy via @NASAJPL: http://t.co/m3ZJXrGh
@rocdoc My team and I have worked very hard to get ready for today. I'm excited to go and do my job
Everybody, chill! Cryogenic loading of my Centaur upper stage has begun
@Nafeealam We'll be doing live chat and video stream at http://t.co/m3ZJXrGh starting in 5 minutes.
@SnapsTruly I don't expect you'll see it, but @CanberraDSN will be monitoring for my first signal about 50 mins after launch.
@WalesBeliebs Yes! Coverage of the launch will begin at 5 a.m. PST (8 a.m. EST) on http://t.co/m3ZJXrGh
I can hear the cheers and clapping in the #NASATweetup tent from here! You guys are the best!
Sun now rising over Florida coast;  anticipation building!  Just over 3 hours until 10:02 a.m. ET launch window opens.
Today's my big day! I'm on the launch pad looking at Mars up there in the sky near Regulus. I'll be on my way in about 4 hours!
@origo_tudomany Thank you! While I'm not looking for life per se, I will be looking for past/present habitable environments
Hello Australia! Thanks for all your support, #CSIROtweetup. @CanberraDSN, thanks for listening
