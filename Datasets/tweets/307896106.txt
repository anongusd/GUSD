@SorchaScorcher @tedcruz I said 21 for a couple and you corrected me with the individual exemption. 	You brought up the recent tax cut when you said they got a tax cut already, which I correctly said was mostly a corporate tax cut and that the estate tax was already adjusted as part of that.
@SnackAlgorithm @WillyWa12566853 @tedcruz Rich people didn't do anything wrong, quite the opposite, most did something right. This is just about priorities for the economy and budget and I think the economy would do much better if you middle class got a significant tax cut.
@Sad_Max_Boot @tedcruz Because we live in a democracy. We have all gotten together and decided how much of my money the government should take, it's called taxes, which is what we're discussing here.
@SorchaScorcher @tedcruz For individuals it's 10.5 &amp; for couples it's 21. It was a corporate tax cut with small adjustments to individual rates that skewed to the wealthiest Americans. Like the estate tax went from 5 million to 10.5 million. He's just looking to add to their piece. 	You were saying?
@tedcruz It's a tax on 5000 of the wealthiest Americans. How about a tax cut for the other 299,995,000 of us first? I feel like couples with over $21 million dollars will be fine until then. Thanks

@realDonaldTrump From 1999 to 2008, of the 0.151% of Ninth Circuit Court rulings that were reviewed by the Supreme Court, 20% were affirmed, 19% were vacated, and 61% were reversed; the median reversal rate for all federal appellate courts was 68.29% for the same period.

@eitansasson The Post said Ivanka Trump sent less than 100 emails on her private server¬†regarding official business, with other emails to personal assistants about her travel arrangements and White House schedule.	That's just based on Ivanka's word. Clinton said the same thing....
@eitansasson Need the FBI to go through them.... This is the stupidity that they went through with Clinton... Then they declared emails classified that weren't even she sent them.
@eitansasson Literally exactly the same on all major points. Expect Ivanka's came after an entire campaign saying that Hillary should go to jail for it.... How could she possibly not know it wasn't allowed? #FULLERCLINTON
@eitansasson Emails were out of Trump Tower- which means private server, her lawyer picked the emails that were govt- just like HC, any emails she deleted from that account were destroyed- exactly like HC did. How do we know what she deleted/destroyed wasn't classified??? #FULLCLINTON
@TheWeek It's strange to argue against constitutional originalism in an article supporting the death penalty, which currently exists on the basis of that legal philosophy. 	Especially because the main critique is with poorly written legislation and not the judicial interpretation of it.

My thoughts on the Honduran migrants or caravan of immigrants coming to the US border. #HonduranCaravan #mexico #Border https://t.co/37NMAisTt8
Instead President Trump is name calling them by way of Twitter and getting his supporters to join him instead of at least acknowledging that our mundane is their light and that we are still the shinning city on a hill. I can't help but think we are America and we could do better.
I am really bothered by the way people are talking about them. I'm not sure what to do when they get to the border, but there was a time I was confident that smart and compassionate people would be working on it
I don't generally think lawless should be rewarded, yet I can't help but think that most are moms, dads and kids, in the middle of an incredibly difficult journey, the kind you read about in history books, pushing themselves on the hopes of getting a shot at the American dream.
These migrants are not sneaking in, they aren't from terror zones, we have a labor shortage and it's clear that many of these people know how to work hard and suffer to get what they want. We could certainly pick a worse group of people to let in, if that's what we decide to do.

@godofradio @JSalama5 To have any real pre-existing condition protections require community rating regs- so they can't charge sick more, essential benefits rule- to make them cover expensive illness, enrollment restrictions- ppl can't wait to buy when sick and subsidies. Which recreates the ACA.

@godofradio @JSalama5 The ACA ended lifetime caps &amp; pre-existing conditions, created minimum standards and helped millions buy ins. Intentional sabotage and an unwillingness to modify/improve the law has exacerbated it's deficiencies. The patience protections part of the PPACA is why GOP can't end it.
@godofradio @JSalama5 Also, it avoids answering why deductibles spiked in the 2 years leading up to 2010. Which was in part because the employer market was in crisis from years of increasing premiums and employer participation/benefits decreasing which pushed people to the dangerous ind market.
@godofradio @JSalama5 10 yrs ago is great but not very useful in determining impact of legislation from 2010. Judging the impact of the Dept of Homeland Security's on national security using 1998, 2008 &amp; 2018 includes 9/11 &amp; is misleading. Increases in prems/deductibles part of why we have the ACA
@AG_Conservative Employers offering health coverage in 1999 - 67%, 2008- 56.4%, 2017- 46.9%	The employer H-Ins market was collapsing. 20+ years of double digit premium increases, reduction in benefits/coverage, sicker risk pools, etc.,	The Ded spike was absolutely part of a trend.
@godofradio @JSalama5 This was not intended to sound rude, limited characters can sometimes make it sound harsher than intended.
@godofradio @JSalama5 Employer Ins deductibles did rise before and unrelated to the ACA, they slowed following passage &amp; employer participation/ quality of benefits were rapidly dropping &amp; premiums were rapidly increasing for previous 20 years. Why 2008 not 2010 other than to skip unrelated ded spike?
@LBitter @JSalama5 The main argument against ACA wasn't employer Ins deductibles, they did rise before and unrelated to the ACA, they slowed following passage &amp; employer participation/ quality of benefits were rapidly dropping &amp; premiums were rapidly increasing for previous 20 years. What's false?
@NewsbySmiley @AndrewGillum Obviously, their Safety and Security is more important than election outcomes. and we all hope and pray that the storm turns into a nothing and all Floridians/Americans are safe.

The complaint is that more than 50% of the Senate represents 18% of the population. This is actually a great point in helping people understand that the issue is not partisan rather it's more a concern for the future of the country. https://t.co/bVoE4Kg0Mn

@bilald Again we agree. Yet not all non-violent ways of protesting are effective, i.e., chanting "get out c*nt". My point is only that we should be targeting attention, issues and ways to win rather then a person bc people are more likely to empathize with the target if it's a person.
@bilald I said you but I meant Obama supporters in general. 	Obviously not if they had enacted the same policy, you already know the policy is disgusting, a policy they cared about and they wanted you to care about, would screaming him out of a resturant make you want to look into it?

@RBrulin @bungdan With all due respect, you'd be wrong then too. If thousands of Israelis were on the Palestinian border and were launching rocks and fire bombs at Palestinian police while some rushed the border, there would be an outcry from the world and it wouldn't be about the 60 dead Israelis
@RBrulin @bungdan Good talking to you. To address your main point, if someone is in the process of committing or attempting to commit a terrorist attack, whether Palestinian or Israeli, and is killed in the process, the killing is Justified. Hard stop.
@RBrulin @bungdan If Israeli citizens rioted like this and tried breaking through the Palestinian border and were shot in the process it would absolutely be justified.
@RBrulin @bungdan Why did the Palestinian police not arrest a single person for throwing rocks or Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers on the other side of the Border? If the Palestinian government wanted to stop this they could in a minute.
@RBrulin @bungdan I don't agree. If a group of Israeli citizens rioted, threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at Palestinian officers and were caught by Israeli police they would spend the next 20 years in a prison. Because Israel is a democracy governed by laws.
@RBrulin @bungdan Is it really your assertion that's because in the late 70s Israel may have committed Terror attacks they have given up the right to kill terrorists and should therefore allow members of a terrorist organization to cross their borders?
@RBrulin @bungdan Hamas takes credit for Terror attacks. Google ‚ÄúThe three hero martyrs who executed the Jerusalem operation have no connection to Daesh [ISIS], they are affiliated with the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] and Hamas,‚Äù Hamas official Izzat El-Reshiq¬†tweeted.
@RBrulin @bungdan But the information that is available does tell a story, we know that this was organized by a terrorist organization, the terror group has stated that 50 of the people killed were part of that group and we know they were rioting and trying to break through Israel's border.
@RBrulin @bungdan Your comment implies that many of the people killed we're nowhere near the border, how many of the 60 people killed were not at the border riot? Burning tires, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at police or soldiers is a riot not a protest.
@RBrulin @bungdan If you are a part of a terrorist organization, you're at a riot on another country's border on behalf of that terror group and you're in a group throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at soldiers and/or your trying to break through a border, yes, your being killed is justified.

@bungdan I didn't call them terrorists, the United States designated Hamas a terrorist organization and they organized the protest.
@RBrulin @bungdan The US designated terrorist organization Hamas organized this riot, had people bring their children/babied to a violent protest and told people to try to break into Israel. Had a terror group organized this at the US or French border it would have been called a terrorist attack.

@ZeebestABC @chrislhayes What differentiates terrorists from a defending army is that terrorists intentionally target innocent civilians, like Hamas shooting rockets indiscriminately into cities vs a defending Army which will shoot people that they have evidence are dangerous and who are attacking them.
@ZeebestABC @chrislhayes It's convenient you didn't respond to the fact that this protest was called by Hamas, a terrorist organization, no different than ISIS according to the US. Terrorists call for protests and ppl show up w/ rocks, hand grenades and bombs, it's not so easy to figure out who is armed.
@ZeebestABC @chrislhayes Also, according to @NBCNews some hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails and three were shot detonating a bomb.
@ZeebestABC @chrislhayes If 10 people are running at you and 9/10 have been clear about the fact that they want to kill you, several of them are armed, the armed ones and the unarmed ones are wearing the same thing, what do you do?
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes Pardon my grammar my talk-to-text sucks
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes Hell, we expect them US forces to use lethal Force if the scene that was going on on the Israeli border was happening outside a US Embassy, let alone our border.
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes And we'd be okay if the US soldiers used lethal force to stop them.
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes Hamas, a terrorist organization, they called for the protest on Israel's border, where they were throwing Molotov cocktails and trying to get into Israel. Americans would expect our government to stop firebombing ISIS members from hopping fences and coming into the US.
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes Crapping on Israel for doing the same thing your government does to protect you is easy. Defending your double standard, not so much.
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes *hopping
@nick_tacik @chrislhayes Which part of my post was incorrect? Do you really believe that if ISIS called for protests on the US Mexican border, started throwing rocks and molotov cocktails at US soldiers, then some of them tried hoping the fence to get in, that Obama wouldn't have ordered them to be shot?
@chrislhayes Hamas is a terrorist group, labeled as such by the same govt that labeled ISIS, Hezbollah and the Taliban terrorist groups. If ISIS admittedly sent ppl to protest/fence hop into the US, you care more about the fact that some of the terrorists were armed than that some weren't.

@Two_of_Twelve @nrlc No. You will continue to work on trying to make abortion illegal and I will continue to try to stop you. In the meantime we can get things done that'll reduce abortions and take care of mom's and kids. Had you done that 20 years ago there would be significantly less abortions now
@Two_of_Twelve @nrlc No but while we continue to argue over making abortions illegal, which we will never agree on, at least we can be doing the things we both agree on like wanting healthy mothers and babies and to reduce there amount of women getting abortions because the don't have money. Win/win
@nrlc How about you support mandatory paid maternity and paternity, increased funding for WIC/Medicaid and public school starting at 18 months and save lives by immediately reducing the amount of abortions.
If you truly believe a fetus is a life then how about you support mandatory paid maternity and paternity, increased funding for WIC/Medicaid and public school starting at 18 months and reduce the amount of abortions. With their help these would be law in less than a year.
Two thoughts 1) 20 weeks is when detailed ultrasound is done. A 20-week ban is more likely to make women decide to have an abortion based on incorrect ultrasound because they won't get a chance to get a second opinion.
Two lies 1) 21 weeks is not a late term abortion. 2) fetuses in can not feel pain at this stage. https://t.co/Yxxsz0Ahe9
