@shlomibros @heatherdawn1971 @mariagaani51 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Whining üòÅ I think is what your trying to say...
@ArrogantRuss3ll Sometimes he gets to excited.
@jasonbhood I enjoyed your preaching today Jason!
@PhilBredesen Do you support the wall?
@SpeakerRyan Your full of hot air, you really don't care. I'm fighting for my pension and your 48 years old and collect all that's not right. Butch Lewis act please act now!
@marcorubio Maybe you should be a preacher...
@SenAlexander I've worked for 35 plus years. I want the same health and pension plan as yours. I'm about to lose my pension if you don't do anything about the Butch Lewis act.
@SenAlexander @senrobportman @MarkWarner @SenAngusKing @NatlParkService @GreatSmokyNPS Great what about the Butch Lewis act. No response from you at least Bob corker responded and he's leaving office. YOU SUCK!!!! As a senator.
@maileflanagan @marcorubio Maybe they need to come in legally. Second why it's it out responsibility to take care if them!!!
@TIME Fake news LoL. Seriously he's out of touch like so many.
@CNBC I went and surely didn't see that. Fake news!
@BlisterList @NBCNews @CNBC We did fine without Iran we can now.
@Lrihendry This wall will pay for itself in a year. Think what we now pay for to house them. So all this would stop them from entering.
@CNN Then go back and apply legally.
@SenAlexander Please pass the Butch Lewis act. I've worked 30 years and I'm about to lose anything. Wish I had the same health and pension as yours. You think that's fair?
@ABC My dog loves the heat she'll lay out in the sun when it's 95 degrees.
@SpeakerRyan I want the same health insurance and pension as you. Hypocrite!
@SenAlexander What new policy had been that way since bill Clinton signed it by Congress. And your our senator? Please we are not that stupid.
@PhilBredesen I believe you 100% . When you took over as governor, it was a mess, and turned it around.

@MikeWIN40864602 @realDonaldTrump But hey maybe they had the union pension somewhere in the 2200 pages.
@MikeWIN40864602 @realDonaldTrump Scum bags on both sides and Trump didn't have the guts to do it...
@SenAlexander @VUMChealth Please retire I've said before all talk no action. Please vote him out something.
@SenAlexander Well said but how long have you been a senator?  To LONG....
@RandPaul All talk no action.
