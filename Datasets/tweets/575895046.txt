@joncoopertweets @TheDemCoalition @PeteHegseth Total knob
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Staring at the wall
@CNN Lieberman is a real Trump applogodt and such an irrelevant stooge. He also says its a rush to judgement about the VA governor?  What an embarrassment.
@JonMarksMedia Goff is NOT better than Wentz
@Wawa 2.  If you do 3 or 4 you aren’t human
@fcoxx_91 Some of the best I’ve had
@SteveKingIA You are gross
@rklein90 How “Christian” of her
@SportsRadioWIP Everyone owes Schwartz some apologies.  The D Held the Saints to 20 points.  That was our game to lose and the offense lost it.
@SportsRadioWIP @NickFoles thank you for everything.  Another exciting season.  You can’t win em all but the ones we have won with you have always been magical.

@slavin78 @realDonaldTrump And that he had 2 years under a R house to pass but never did. Pure politics.

@NFL Embarassing referee performance in Dallas.  The Eagles not only robbed on the fumble on kickoff (which would have resulted in a FG, minimally)  but also on an Offensive pass interference call which was a TD.  Embarassment.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 3rd tweet of the day is a charm.  See I knew you could do it.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS 0 for 2 today so far Mr. President.  Your political rivals (tweet 1) and China (tweet 2) shouldn’t trump recognizing the sacrifices made on Pearl Harbor’s Anniversary!  Come on, I know you can do it!
@OvrTheEdge @SportsRadioWIP Lmfao.  No one said they don’t do well on tv.  We’re talking numbers here. They are irrelevant in the game of football and have been for 2 decades.  I’m glad you thought equating tv ratings mattered. 👍👍
@SportsRadioWIP Dak is a total L. The Cowboys are the LEAST relevant franchise in the last 15 years. His statement literally contradicts himself. What a tool!

@JuliaScotti4 I’ll for R for Romaine at this point over this orange buffoon
@JuliaScotti4 Yes, they are indeed.  I meant Nationally.  And when Bernie ran as a D he didn’t get the Nom.  I think the D’s need need to do some searching.  They should look to this past mid term. Mostly women veterans were the ones who upset incumbent R’s.
@JuliaScotti4 He might but won’t get the R nomination and is too conservative at this point to potentially run as a D.  And I’s never get anywhere.

@wethreemusic you guys were robbed!!!!
@AGT @howiemandel  got that wrong
@realDonaldTrump He has more respect in his little finger than the President would hope to have in 100 life times.  		RIP Senator McCain		A war hero, a symbol of American exceptionalism and a marquee of stability and normalcy in government.  		Thank you
