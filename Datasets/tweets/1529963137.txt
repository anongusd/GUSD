@bluebuffalo I have 4 cats, 1 kitten and 1 bull mastiff. I recently changed over to Blue Buffalo. I am so impressed with your food line for pets. My pets are enjoying it and I do not have to worry about unhealthy additives for my fur babies. Thank you!
@JonLemire I see this picture and I am filled with sadness. It's a beautiful building that represents our country, the wars that have been fought, the men/women who have died in order for one person to lead our country. It feels tarnished now.
@vermontgmg Note: The word "was" may need to be inserted into how the GOP used to act. 	(was the most traditionally).
@JoyceWhiteVance @girlsreallyrule He can pretend all he wants.  America and the world watched his behavior in all of these matters. He, the GOP and the T admin as well as POTUS are giving new meanings to the word - hypocrisy.
@ProudResister If all the facts finally come out on everyone involved in this, can you imagine what this will do to our Gov't?	 We need to clean "house" and have people who actually serve the country and not 1 person or themselves.	The results will be traumatic to say the least.
@DerekCressman Then how can they say that they cannot track the children? There is paperwork in adoption cases. There is paperwork when any child enters the system.  How can any agency say that these beautiful children suddenly appeared out of no where.
@krassenstein @RepDougCollins Maybe someone should remind him what happened to Former Rep. Gowdy after he sided w/T! 		That it may work for one person, but the country finds such behavior to be unfit for such an office.

@funder I know I'm getting older, but when I first started voting, I voted Rep. I did so because they stood for our country, our beliefs &amp; patriotism. I stopped after 2elections (80-84) when I saw the party change. It turned into a party that is for 1% and no longer patriotic, nor truth.

As I read tweets, watch T.V., it is troubling that I see more and more of a white/black only country. So many tweets are only concerned with one of the two races and leave out so many others. All lives matter. All rascism needs to be addressed.

@MarshallCohen Maybe if news agencies quit giving an Indicted person so much air time, we wouldn't have to read or listen to his "woe is me" attitude. I've never seen in my lifetime, so many people who are under investigation or indicted get so much air time.
@JamesAllenGrady Strange how they never responded to the diplomats who were "harmed" in Cuba. I guess the difference is one has rum, and the other has "OIL". This is Iraq all over again if they do this.
@thomaskaine5 I have to disagree. I live in an huge red area. They voted for Trump. It's a mixed lot of college and non-college. I do agree what they have in common is the hatred, fear and unhappiness you stated. Many have a huge "dark secret" of bigotry. The jokes, looks &amp; comments of bigots.

I live in the middle of the country and yes, you did get my attention.
@sahilkapur @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris I have to add:	1. That she doesn't over promise of what is possible to actually accomplish.	2. That this doesn't become about two cultural race (black &amp; white) races. America is so multicultural and all races in our country need to be acknowledged. (My family is important also)
@joncoopertweets @LunaLuvgood2017 I had a nice dream this afternoon during a nap. They started rounding them up from the top, family and then went down to Congress and got those supporting Russia too. It was just a huge roundup of all of these traitors. It was a great dream.

@ASlavitt Those are the ones we know about.	 I have to wonder how many we do not know about and how much has been done in secret since the election?
@PhilipRucker My personal observations:	1. They will do anything to keep Russia happy.	2. They think everyone else is stupid: everyone will buy whatever they are selling.	3. The main goal is to destroy as much of our gov't as possible in every agency.	4. They have no morals. None!

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Can a voter request Congress start an investigation into the actions of the Senate Majority Leader? I think there are many of us who want to know why McConnell refuses to protect our country and refuses to take the vote to pay our Fed. Gov't workers. Something is really wrong.
@SocialPowerOne1 Geeze so only white people can condem Fox now? ROFLOL It must be really getting under her priviledged skin to have another race put them in their places. But yet, they tear apart other races on an hourly basis.
@RedTRaccoon @nypost @realDonaldTrump  Not paying Gov't workers, but here again, you are spending tax dollars on jets. People are going to be evicted from their homes, going to food banks for food, can't pay utilities, but geeze let's let the your wife (?) fly off to FL.
@PersuasivePR With all the projecting T does on a constant basis, is anyone thinking about his statement of killing someone and getting away with it? He has projected darn near every single thing he or his cohorts have done. Something to ponder. 🤔
@ChrisCuomo Yes it is a power struggle, The one to blame now is @senatemajldr . The House is doing it's job, but the Senate is failing the American Fed. Gov't. Instead of acting on checks and balances, he is running amok, doing whatever he pleases and not protecting our country!

@Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump He doesn't care about the Fed. Gov't workers. He has no plans of opening the gov't back up. To make sure he has name out front again, he threw a tantrum, and yes, this is the best they could come up with. Risking her safety and those traveling with her.
@BrianKarem SHS need to address @SenMajLdr . The house has already passed numerous bills that the rep's already approved to open the gov't. It's McConnell who is refusing to take a vote. He's the one refusing to negotiate.
@HoarseWisperer Are you sure you want to do this? After all the crazy statements by T's lawyer yesterday and today, it's quite possible something might be popping. Just a thought, you know crazy G goes on t.v. just before an indictment or really bad news.
@alex_mallin @PhilipRucker @PressSec Does he mean the paychecks with zero dollar amounts? One would think that instead of cancelling trips, he would have a long talk with @SenMajLdr. and his lack of voting. @SpeakerPelosi and the house has passed numerous bills to open the gov't.

@RedTRaccoon So, does this mean T will no longer be taking any trips out of the WH? I mean how can he leave the WH for these meetings. Just this morning he was gone again. 🙄
@neeratanden So, this means no more Trump trips, for him or his family during the shutdown also???🤨
@MichaelSteele And yet he is using Marine1, AF1 for his family and himself. He has made several 🤨trips in the last few weeks he doesn't remember. His family made how many trips to FL. All during the shutdown. Bunch of hyprocrites.

@TrinityMustache @ManInTheHoody I stand corrected, but I'm still not backing her.
@TrinityMustache @ManInTheHoody No, I'm a woman &amp; not going to use that excuse. She led the charge. If you like her good for you and that's what this country is all about. To be honest, I'm not impressed with any of them yet. Not until I see, hear what they say on topics. It's way 2 early 2 get on any bandwagon
@ChetPowell @angie8675309 @kylegriffin1 Are we talking about #PresidentCoulter or Trump? Because Coulter says she is giving all the advice about the shutdown and wall to him and he is obeying her. 		On a serious note, I agree, he is destroying our country and he's more destructive daily.
@joshuamanning23 @MalcolmNance Not me! This is just like giving Trump's base so much credit. Instead of talking about the 70% who love our country. They look to the GOP like they are going to change. I give @JerryMoran  credit, because he stood up for country over party today.
@StopTheSpeaker When he starts to talk about what is going on in the WH and standing against the destruction of what Trump is doing, then I'll care about what he has to say. It's easy to talk about someone no longer in office.
@soledadobrien @MalcolmNance @SenPatRoberts , why on earth would you assist the Kremlin and not the United States! The fact that you voted to assist them is so detrimental to our country. Why, sir, why?
@jimsciutto @lizsmithtweet Shameful that @SenPatRoberts would stand up for Russian interests and not the United States. No wonder KS has such a bad reputation. Russia attacked our elections and Sen. Roberts is rewarding one of their interests. Disgusting to say the least.
@politicususa @tjbogart33 @SenPatRoberts You stated you may not run again, perhaps that would be a great choice since you put Russian interests over the United States. Why would a Senator vote to help a Russian interest? Please do our country a favor, step down we need Senators that stand up for USA.
@tedlieu @smartdissent @realDonaldTrump Maybe the reason for the shutdown is simple. Everyone has been asking Trump when they should have been asking #PresidentCoulter . It appears she is running the country and Hannity is Vice Pres. Who knew we had a takeover, just ask her. @realDonaldTrump

@_NotFakeNews_ Honestly, if she is the Dem choice, I might consider a different vote, as long as it isn't T. She lost me when she refused to let Franken have a hearing. I don't agree if he did those things, but her refusal to even give him a chance, means no chance to her.

@Damita911 I know, Trump has started and continues a dangerous precident. As you said in normal times this never occurs. He is doing horrible damage to our country, our laws, and constitution. Real POTUS' would never behave nor disgrace our country the way he has. Everything has changed.

@realDonaldTrump Yes Sir, it is. Our Country is special and so are the Fed. Gov't workers who are going without their pay. Their families are stressed while you are looking at the window kicking back, while they are trying to find enough money to eat. Must be nice, it's your #TrumpShutdown
@GOP @SenTedCruz Trump told the nation and the world this is his shutdown. Sen.Maj. Leader is refusing to even take a vote. The house is passing legislation to stop the shutdown and you have the nerve to print this. Wake up and protect Americans and not two people. 😡Workers deserve to be paid!

@sirDukeDevin @DebraMilazzoSha @realDonaldTrump I thought you actually had to join the military, become an officer and work your way up. Bone spur's excuses are not a quilification for this. Deferment from military service is not a quilification. Attending a military cadet school is not a qualification in the real world.
@NormOrnstein Sending you heartfelt hugs for you and your family. I have lost one husband to suicide, one to cancer, and my mother. The greatest loss was my son June 2014. Losing a child is the worst pain of all. Again, heartfelt thoughts to you and your family.

@gtconway3d @JustSchmeltzer My daughter was at one of the chain stores that sell a huge amount of "Made in China" products. She was upset on how prices in this store are going up. My answer: Tariff's and it's going to get worse not better. She's on a limited budget, yes, it's the consumers who will pay.

@Tom_Winter There is a huge "chain store" that many use. My daughter called while at this store, expressing frustration at the prices going up. This chain is well known for using "Made in China". I told her that they were preparing for the tariffs going into effect. This hike only a sample.
@morningmoneyben My daughter is a huge shopper of a chain store. This chain store is well known to use "Made in China" products.  She complained yesterday of their prices going up. All I said to her "Tariffs are coming" this is only a sample of what's going to happen.

Okay this is beyond stupid. Let's send the US Coast Guard who are not being paid to a border where the Border Patrol are not being paid to check children you are putting into cages. They are not being paid because of a shutdown over a wall that is physically impossible to build
@kylegriffin1 So is he saying his base doesn't work or not able to work for the Fed Gov't? Humm, so any rep's in the Gov't not getting paid are now Dem's? So, if you're a rep and not getting a check it's just in your imagination???
@ABCWorldNews You mean the US Coast Guard that are not receiving their pay during the #TrumpShutdown  aiding the Border Patrol also not being paid?????
@tommyxtopher Many of the T base believe in this. They believe by backing T they will cause the end of times for Jesus' return. They honestly think they will be raptured and not have to deal with mess they are creating. It's why I left the church decades ago.
@brianstelter Visitng the troops would b great if he was there for all of the troops. Not causing division and stating Dem's are at fault for his problems. Visitng troops are great when you are not trying to get your poll #'s up and need to use the military for photo op's. or escaping shutdown
@RepMarkMeadows No Sir, he did not! He made a point of saying that only certain military are worthy. That if you're a dem. you don't have the same rights. POTUS are supposed to unite all Americans not cause division. And sir, not all of the military, veterans have confidence in him.
@AymanM 5) Spent tax payer $$$ while Fed Gov't workers are not recieving their pay.	6) Spent tax payer $$$ when Mortgages, Rent, Food, Bills are coming due for those affected.	7) Addresses the fact that only part of America is what he cares about.	8) Used military again for photo op.
@cmclymer @NBChristinaGinn I would have to have more than two:  	A 📢because I go on rants when I see injustice.	 A needle and thread: I make quilts. 	An apron because I love to bake.	And several cat's and a faithful dog as my companions.
@tribelaw I find it comes in waves. I have this thing inside me (it's called a soul) that when I see people who are getting hurt by his stunts, the hate he spews and the lies bother me. It hurts me to see what is going on. I've never liked bullies &amp; this man is given a stage for his hate.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, our Federal Gov't is made up of people. Not politics. They want to be able to feed their families. Buy groceries and pay their bills. They are not pawns for you to use. You are not supposed to POTUS for just a few.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump He has his aides go through and find his name. If he is not mentioned in a good light he has no idea what words are in an article. So, no he probably has no clue it's for reading.
@thehill So, is he saying his base doesn't work? If I was one of them and wasn't getting paid, I would be even more pissed.

@traciemac_Bmore @parscale He threw paper towels at hurricane victums, recommended rakes for forest fires, damn I hate to think what he's going to do or throw at our military other than a photo op.
@jimsciutto People going to go without their paychecks  due to his shutdown and he's flying over using tax dollars for a photo op. If he cared he would have done this long ago. As a veteran I'm tired of his using us when his polls are down or he's in trouble. Many Vets work for the Fed Govt.
@waltshaub People here are going to go without their paychecks due to his shutdown &amp; he's flying over using tax$$ for a photo op. If he cared about r military he would've done this long ago. As a vet I'm tired of his using us when his polls r bad or he's in trouble. Many Fed workers r vets.

@YoungCADemocrat I'm tired of seeing these polls. Until I hear what they have to say, where they stand on issues and how they behave then no, I'm not going to back them/vote yet. I've seen Rep. Eric Swalwell  standup as many others. It's too soon. Let's see what happens in the next few months.

@B52Malmet People are praising him for this photo op, are forgetting he had no plans to visit. His plans were for a two week Christmas Vacation at his place in FL. He needs the military again for polls and a photo op. 😡He shuts down the Gov't and needs to hear praise. Different type rally.
@naretevduorp @veterans_i It's always easy to see when he knows he is in trouble. Here he is again using the military for a photo op. His polls are going down and he can pat himself on the back for being over there. Otherwise he wouldn't be near the military he views as his personal toy soldiers.

@TheRickWilson @MccarverDawn Wow, it's such a good thing that T and the GOP had that tax cut for the 1%. Their going to need it since he is single handedly flushing it all down the toilet for them. 🤔
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition I think this is slowly getting past the point of him, fox news and the GOP trying to lie their way out of this one. This one is going to hit his fan base in their wallets. It's not going to be so easy this time.
@TeaPainUSA All those savings he gave the 1% and now he is flushing their winnings right down the toilet. It wouldn't bother me, but it's affecting all of America and not just his elite crowd.
@kenolin1 I like Presidents who want to protect Democracy and America. I like Presidents who don't tweet like a crazy person. I like Presidents who don't make me afraid everyday because they're so unstable.

@realDonaldTrump All that work giving the 1% huge tax breaks and you are flushing all those "winning" $$$$$$$$ right down the gold toilet. Wow, you're the one who caused the Trade Wars to excellerate downward, and you're the one who had the money and walked away. #TrumpShutdown is your fault, Sir
@EdKrassen @BarackObama Well all those $$$$$ the 1% received from the Tax Cuts are being flushed right down the toilet from their "Stable Genius" in the WH&gt; How is the winning going now? You traded your souls for everything he is destroying.
@realDonaldTrump So America's Christmas present is the blank paper you signed the other day was turned into a resignation letter. What a wonderful way to end the #TrumpChristmasShutdown

@mitchellreports @davidjlynch @JoshNBCNews @ckubeNBC @SecPompeo At some point the only ones he will have left are his family. We are a country and not a private company.

@CNBC If we could afford to pay off our mortgages, don't you think we would?

@vancitydwell At this rate the country will be safer, he won't have time to take dictator calls and spend all his time getting advice from that one fake news channel.
@TheRickyDavila I think all their assets/creditcards/bank accounts should be frozen also. So, they can truly live like those they have harmed.
@MoveOn @TravelingUS @realDonaldTrump This isn't only 800K people not being paid. It's their grocer's, gas, stores, etc that will not be getting paid either. This isn't just about the Fed Gov't not being paid , it's also for all of those they do buisness with. Creditors don't care if there is a shutdown.
@RepAdamSchiff @Mimirocah1 @RepAdamSchiff    That's a good one sir! Extremely accurite. Have a Merry Christmas and thank you for everything you do for your country and voters. I live in a different state, but I'm extremely glad and assured you are looking out for all of us.
@RwCJesse #TrumpChristmasShutdown , so why is his family flying around from DC to FL back to DC on taxpayers money? Those who operate the Air Traffic Control towers, people on the ground/ the airports who receive no pay at this time have to cater to Trump's family while America suffers..
@leahmcelrath @Twitter From what I've gathered from watching these newer bots, they have been sitting idle for some time more than 2 (+-) with an account and are now activated. They have more that a couple of followers. You have to read their tweets carefully and not respond to them. Just my opinion.
@TheDemCoalition @ChrisChristie Oh please. This man has been a jerk all of his life. From his t.v. apperances in the late 70's on. This has nothing to do with age. It seems as though this spoiled brat has aged and never learned to deal with anyone. Only knows how to throw tantrums and be a bully.
@JoeNBC Dear @realDonaldTrump , the United States Military are not your toy soldiers or to be used as photo op. They give their respect to those who have earned it. Gen. Mattis is one of those men. You can try and disrespect him, but for those who have served you cannot tarnish this man.
@politico @SenBobCorker and the #GOP, you have known from the start what type of person you were dealing with. Instead of standing up for country you went and sided with him. You have let him do as he pleases while many in America suffer the consequences. You are guilty also.
@TeaPainUSA @TeeBeeDee1 Well, I've been ridiculed because I refused to endorse him when he started and then decided to destory our country. But, I won't be gloating due to the damage he and his hatefilled, crooked admin have done to our country. I also will remember those who backed this evil creature.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, you own the shut down. You went on national t.v. and broadcasted to the world that you owned it. You had a deal, you turned it down and now as usual you want to blame others. Please Sir, grow up and start acting like POTUS. Real men take responsibility for their actions.

@TeaPainUSA 8. Thousands of Americans are on edge, not knowing if they will have a paycheck, not only for Christmas but it's winter.
@SenatorCollins Ma'am will all due respect. You and the entire @GOP are responsible for the actions this POTUS has taken. You and your cohorts have let this man run amok with no consequences. You have done nothing to be a part of the checks and balances of our great nation. https://t.co/ompNcn1XsN

@chrislhayes From watching him on t.v. back in the 80's, I thought what a pompus fool he was then, watching the news as he went bankrupt (s), divorced (s) etc. None of this was a surprise for those who paid attention to his actions back then or now.

@ProudResister You have them. I've had two fur babies who have been sick this year. One ate thread and had to have extensive stomach/intestinal surgery and the other had pnumonia. So, I'll have the furbabies send prayers too.
@FalResistsHate There's a lot of us having this problem this year. You're not alone. All I can say is take a deep breath, keep repeating this will pass. It won't make it go away. Talk to someone, do something constructive. All that is going on it makes us w/ depression have it worse. Reach out!
@johnpavlovitz @RobPvt Something needs to change. I was just tweeted that I'm not patriotic because I don't want that wall. I am a 100% disabled vet. Just because I don't drink the koolade does not make me less patriotic. I want my country to b kind to people, not this hate. I am crying over the hate.
@5a2166e867a3472 @realDonaldTrump TY, please do not be so flagrant in telling people they do not love their country just because they think differently than you.  The gov't cannot pay travel pay on time and it takes weeks. A shut down will make things worse. Again, please do not tell people they are not patriots.
@amvetsupport I am somewhere between angry/hurt. Because I'm worried about not getting a paycheck down the road (I'm a 100% Disabled Vet) to be told I don't love my country over a fricken wall. I'm just somewhere between rage and crying. I served as others with honor. Magats make me ill.

@5a2166e867a3472 @realDonaldTrump Shut downs means no paychecks for many in the Federal Gov't. This means no food, paying bills etc. It means stress. It means no checks for Disabled Veterans. I've been affected my shut downs before and I know personally how this affects people. I'm a disabled vet who loves USA&gt;
@davidfrum Maybe the man who "saved Christmas" should understand that the majorty of America doesn't want his wall of hate. Yes, we want secure borders. To put families in stress over this is wrong. #GOP needs to remember what Christmas means.
@christinawilkie Wasn't he the man who saved "Christmas" now taking away Christmas? I am so sick of all of them playing with peoples lives. They still have their money, stocks, savings. The average American lives from paycheck to paycheck. Families will go without.
@kasie @naretevduorp Maybe someone can remind the @GOP what Christmas and Christ is all about. Families are going to be stressed, less presents, food. They live paycheck to paycheck. These are not rich people who have thousands in the bank. They will be going without just to appease hate! So wrong.
@Acosta How can the man who states" He alone saved Christmas" now be the one taking away Christmas from those who want to take care of their families. Less presents, more stress, less food all for hate and racism. This is a true contradiction of what Christ and Christmas is about.
@andylassner @realDonaldTrump brags about how he brought back Christmas. So why is he willing to take it away from people? Families are going to be stressed, Christmas presents will not be bought. He is hurting families that believed in him. He is the true  Grinch of Christmas, hate over love
@realDonaldTrump TAKING AWAY CHRISTMAS AND LYING ABOUT A CARAVAN THAT WASN'T A THREAT IS JUST ANOTHER OF YOUR HATE FILLED LIES!  		YOU ARE CAUSING STRESS TO FAMILIES INVOLVED IN YOUR SHUT DOWN!		YOU SIR, ARE THE REASON FAMILES OF YOUR BASE WILL HAVE LESS THIS CHRISTMAS!!!!
@MSNBC @GOP just wanted to say thank you for stress this Christmas. Wanted to thank you for taking away Christmas joy, presents and happiness just so you can please a hatefilled base. Christmas is supposed to be about caring for others. YOU ARE TAKING AWAY CHRISTMAS and HAPPINESS!
@CapehartJ I have hundreds of family in other countries and this is how we stay in contact. Otherwise I would be gone from FB.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump will be forever known as the man who put a wall over Christmas. He will be remembered of denying thousands of homes stress free holidays. He bragged this is his doing. Voters will remember not being able to give their children presents, food, pay bills all because of him.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump If anyone had any doubts about his allegiance to Russia, this is overt proof of who is in charge of his decisions - Putin.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Sir, you want this wall over people not getting paychecks at Christmas, these same people do not have thousands of dollars in the bank. They will remember that you took away their children's Christmas, heat, paychecks. We will remember you took away Christmas!!!!!!
@StevenBeschloss No, wonder more and more GOP are leaving the party and going independent. Here in KS we've had two leaders jump ship in the last few weeks. That's saying alot.

OMG, I am so angry this morning. Why are so many afraid of T and his followers? Why, they are not even half of the country. They are a small part that Congress and the Press are giving so much power. What about the rest of us who dearly love our Country!
@MSNBC @MeetThePress I hate to point this out to @SenAngusKing but we've had partisan warfare since this POTUS won the Rep. nomination. Since he won the POTUS via Electorial Collage. This POTUS has deliberately divided the country and you are now assisting him in his war against the rest of us.
@Scout_Finch They're great. I'm one of those who had to clean up from the old style pressure cooker and had a huge fear ever since. But, I purchased an instapot and love it.

@MeetThePress @RandPaul Sir, @RandPaul if a POTUS obtains the office, by fradulent means, has help from a adversarial country and Congress refuses to act, it is then we have a banana republic. When one person thinks they are above the law we are a b.r. America was built on the Constitution &amp; Laws
@MeetThePress @SenAngusKing @SenAngusKing I understand ur concern, r you listening to yourself? You &amp; many others r giving the 1/3  too much power. 1/3 does not represent the country. What about the rest of us who want a country that follows the laws and not threats? Why are you giving them so much power.
@StevenBeschloss When we have a POTUS who is thinking of running for another term to evade being indicted something is seriously wrong. Our Congress is failing us. In order to be POTUS he takes an oath to uphold the laws and constitution, how then can he run for office by breaking those laws???
@JohnsonFree1 @MeetThePress @SenAngusKing I agree, but why is Congress and the Press giving them so much power. I have never understood why. I don't think we should ignore them, but to yeild to this type of hatred/control has to be stopped if we are to continue as a country.

@TheDemCoalition How can any POTUS lead US, when they broke the law to obtain the Presidency? This person's presidency should become null and void. In this case, another won the popular vote and should've been POTUS in the first place. How can a traitor/fraud be our POTUS who defiles our laws?
@TheDemCoalition I don't think we should have to have an impeachment when the legal system has proven any POTUS has obtained the Presidency illigally. Any POTUS who has come into power especially with another countries assistance does not belong in the WH.
@danielburgin Yes, I agree @danielburgin , but we need to protect our country from ever having another situation where the POTUS is above the law and when Congress (GOP)refuses to act. In times like these they agree with him rather than protect country.

@ChrisLu44 @RichardLui @MSNBC If POTUS possibly commited fraud:wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain	 in order to obtain the office then why wouldn't person be able 2 have indictments against such person. Wouldn't they have obtained the office through illegal means?
@neal_katyal Yes, once again he is trying to change the narrative. In the mean time the world sees these tweets, they laugh at such childishness and then when it comes time for negotiations they know how to work him. There are actually serious repercussions to his actions.

@tedlieu Fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.	Didn't POTUS state that he can make money before/after w anyone he wants and it's not illegal. If he was indeed making deals with other countries..... If you commit a crime to obtains office??
Fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.	"he was convicted of fraud" 	If you commited Fraud to obtain the office, then why wouldn't this same person be able to indicted due to the fact he obtained office by illegal means.
@CaseyBratPack @tedlieu FRAUD: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.	"he was convicted of fraud"	That's why I trying to get answers. If a person commits Fraud to obtain the POTUS, then why should he not be able to be indicted?

@BradMossEsq If a person willingly commits a crime in order to become POTUS, and breaks the laws of the country before hand in order to obtain that office, then isn't his oath of office fradulent?
@BradMossEsq Can you plz explain why?
@neal_katyal @Roadwalt If a POTUS has been in office due to possible help/interference  from an outside country and colluding with that country, wouldn't that make his presidency null and void, thus making him eligible for indictment?

@RepAdamSchiff I understand your wanting a pledge. But POTUS made a pledge to protect the Country and Constitution and we are all seeing how well that went. If he is questionable, no pledge, go on till a nomination is not under T thumb.
@tedlieu When we have a Pres. named as Individual 1, and supposedly cannot be indicted, why should he be able to have judges installed, DOJ and more. He is clearly under investigation, breaking laws (?) and making legal choices. Something has to change into a POTUS not being indicted.
@Lennar Definitely

@counterchekist After the way he has behaved in regards to Vet's and the VA, I don't think he should keep pushing it on how the military and Vet's love him. He has disgraced himself overseas and here at home regarding Vet's. His admin screwed the GI Bill payments. Nope, better not count on us.

@Lawrence I think every one is over looking what he has also stated: That if you want to raid America, you only have to pay him.
@ChrisMurphyCT It went off the rails also, when 45 targets the Press and nothing is done about it. He shouts/tweets and rants about the press and no one in Congress is stopping him. Yes, it's been going off the rails and all r guilty for letting it continue.

Sir, are you saying that if any country gives you enough money they can raid us?  Isn't that against the laws of our country?  This is more proof he thinks our country is for sale. Another tweet to show us how he thinks. https://t.co/p3wycNu229
@KenDilanianNBC So, if you pay him, he will allow any country to raid us? He wants our economy maxed out (yes the 1% doing quite well)  Yes the 1% are rich and getting richer. I'm still worried that he will allow anyone raid us for a price.

@EdKrassen We are no longer on the edge of a dictatorship. We are in the beginning steps. This is no longer a trial run. The alarm bells are no longer going off of as a warning. This is a daily and hourly attack on America and it comes from the WH.
@bbgirl1966 @Turnip2020 @BarackObama I was thinking about this tweet this morning. When my husband passed away, when I received his flag, the presenter stated it was from a grateful nation. There was no mention of the president.
@matthewamiller More proof they think they are above the law. They blame everyone for everything and yet do the same thing a thousand times worse.
@bbgirl1966 @Turnip2020 @BarackObama And yes, I am very sorry for your loss. My heartfelt condolences to you and your family.
@bbgirl1966 @Turnip2020 @BarackObama I'm going to inform my daughter at  the time of my funeral if he is in office to decline the flag. I want no thank you from a draft dodger, who uses veterans for stunts to thank me for anything. I served my country to fight against dictators/Nazi lover and liars who hurt the USA

@Bernstein I was saying that last night. That's why K wasn't very upset about his loss.
@4everNeverTrump He's going to try and do everything he can to find out. He might be weaker, but he's a cornered animal.  The most dangerous animal is one who is cornered.
@Amy_Siskind From the press briefing ( he was able to once more alert his base that the press are enemies/lie) to this. This is only the begining of fear and it's going to get dangerous. He is going to do whatever it takes to stay in power.  I hope I'm wrong.
@AURNOnline @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse I fear the press was being played. He knew during this farce he was going to fire Sessions. He played to his base yet again that anything that is printed are lies and that the press is the enemy. They and the American people were played.
@jpballoujourn1 @CaseyBratPack @Yamiche @AprilDRyan @Acosta @PeterAlexander I hate to say this, but it looks like now the press was being played. He was able to send out the message to his base that the press can be man handled, that anything they say are lies and the enemy. This was planned for his later actions.
@airforcevet43 @washingtonpost This I fear is only the start of whole new type of chaos. This is going to get bad.
@PreetBharara This is only the start. He's cornered, he knows it and he is going to try and take total control. It's going to get bad and not just for the investigations. He's going to do what ever it takes to stay in power. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think so.
@HoarseWisperer This is going to get really bad. We all have seen what he does when he feels threatened. He is a crazed, tyrant and facing investigations, etc. He's on the attack now.
@EdKrassen I think we all need to buckle up. This is just the start of even more severe craziness. It's going to get dangerous while he tries to take total power, he's scared, cornered and it's going to get bad.
@renato_mariotti @CaptainsLogAz Tic tock, tic tock, tic tock , tic tock:  the clock will go into hyper drive now that he is scared. He's going to go on a total rampage to show that he is in control. This is only the start I fear. https://t.co/WM6N7p9MGQ

@matthewamiller I think way to much is put into polls. I don't know anyone who was polled. If people think opposite is winning in polls it makes them come out all that much harder. Maybe it's time to quit worrying about polls and start working on getting rid of Elec. College &amp; Gerrymandering.
@SopanDeb I don't think polls will be accurate in the time of T. If you let people you didn't vote R you can be in trouble with people who know you, and if you did, you're letting people know you think kKK= bigotry, and lies are okay. If you were one of these peeps would you be honest?
@EsotericCD @swin24 Maybe people just don't tell the polls what they are really thinking. Personally, too much hope/faith is put into the polls and it discourages true voters.

@McFaul @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin Personally, what upsets me about her is the fact of her saying one thing and doing another. This is not the first time she has done this since T. She let's every one think she is against something and then turns right around and votes yes. As for M, he's pretending to be a dem.

Why is it when u get on a racist 4 saying there r only 2 colors in the world, they get soo upset. I was just called a C_____t and it's because I stated it was more than white women who voted for T. There were Hispanic, Asian, etc. Talk about racist. And yes, I reported him

@DogginTrump I'm exactly the same. I don't care what the polls say in the future. All I know is that if even one percent feel the way I do they will vote. Vote Blue and get all of those hate filled )W()#$%)# out of the GOP!
@CheriJacobus I really don't care, do you?
@PersuasivePR The news keep talking about this boiling rage going away and we won't vote the GOP out. They better wake up. I am not alone in the anger and the deep fear in my soul as so to what they are doing to our country. Deep fear as to the destruction of my beloved USA.
@JRubinBlogger If there are others such as I who have this quiet boiling rage going on in my soul after the travesty of this disgraced and ruinous vote for SCOTUS, then I don't care what future polls say, GOP needs to be voted out! I am so upset to see what they have done to our courts.
@StevenBeschloss @KirstenPowers I have a quiet boiling rage going on in my soul. To see the GOP ruin our laws, country, SCOTUS. I have had to quit FB, twiiter ranting due to it bothering my health.

@chrislhayes I blame anyone who votes for K. This position should be filled by a canidate who can put law over party. One who can show and behave dignified and not a ranting lunatic. This is a postition of power and there are so many more qualified Rep. Judges who could fulfill SCOTUS!
Dear @SenatorCollins 	The position of SCOTUS is not 1 of party. This job is for 1 who truly believes that they will have a non-bias position to uphold laws of our country. K. has shown the world that he cannot do this. To vote yes, is being party to the destruction of our laws. https://t.co/XJ07HzDYEb
@lisamurkowski Thank you Sen. Murkowski. You stood up for your voters, for women, for humanity. Standing up for our justice system, to insure that our judicial system does not become one of power instead of justice. Our government is fragile and it is only people of courage who can save her. TY

@CapehartJ The tweets are getting worse, the anger is self righteous, and the lies are worse (who would've believed they could be). He now has the GOP enthralled in his anger and disrespect to the country. The anger is the most dangerous to our country &amp; citizens.
@JoyceWhiteVance I doubt that was the original intent. Once they figured it out they went into "Righteous Mode" to get their base motivated. If they win, then the Dems are motivated. If they lose their base is. This is not a win for either party but a loss for US , laws and SC. The people lose.
@senorrinhatch No Sir! WIth all the wonderful judges in US, whither GOP or Dem, why are you so intent to put into place a man with questionable ethics? Why? I know judges who do not have blemish, who believe in our laws and constitution. The only reason you are pushing this is because of TRUMP

@chelseahandler Innocent people do not go on ridiculous rants and lies. He takes the act of being guilty to a whole new level. Laughing stock isn't even close to his rants and vicious lies about people and our country.

@JeffMerkley I tried to warn people he was going to win, and have continued to do so. He is destroying everything that is good in our country. He is constantly lying, dividing us, attacks all of our institutions, intelligence agencies, news, poor, disabled, etc  I refuse to honor an evil man.
@CBSNews Please, someone tell this person, that innocent people do not behave this way. That country comes first and a true patriot would want the attack of R, solved and protect our country. That we need to protect our country, this is not rigged. Perhaps innocence would want that.
@EdKrassen I don't think Manafort is going to flip. He is waiting for a pardon (?) I think he might feel that he has greater fears from perhaps another country?
@EdKrassen When will the @SenateDems quit messing around and start making waves. This dilly dallying is dangerous. They need to use all their power to talk to the GOP, take legal measures, do what is necessary,and to stand firm. Their contemplation is as dangerous as the GOP's silence.
@SykesCharlie Innocent people wouldn't need to do any of this. The more he does this, the guiltier he looks (is). While doing this he is destroying our country.
@NBCNews Maybe if he put our country first instead of himself, attacking the free press and our intelligence agencies and did something other than twitter, he wouldn't be talked about. He loves all the attention, neg. or good.

@tribelaw @thedailybeast I live in KS and listen to a lot of people as they talk about T. The majority think he is a horses' ass and they like the money now in their pockets. They don't care what he tweets or says. So, just a thought.
Aghast she realized what she stated&amp; said "Oh, I didn't mean that, the ballot goes to the bottom of the machine. "She sure woke me up when she said that &amp; then I laughed. Not funny if you think about it. She meant well though when she realized how she sounded with that statement.
I went &amp; voted 1st thing this a.m.. As I turned in my vote, the lady stated  the machine would take the sheet, then shred the paper. Astonished, I turned to her &amp; asked her with all that is going on, what would they do on a recount or problem with the computer system. (Thread)
