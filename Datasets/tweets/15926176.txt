@jt_hammons @StoudemireSue @ajceditor Look under the photo at the word "stalls."  AJC selected that word.
@jt_hammons @PoliticsGPB No humor intended.  NY has gone after fracking, &amp; California is shutting down nuclear.  While we can certainly learn things from both states, especially with California about solar and storage, geography matters when it comes to energy.  GA can never be a Germany, nor should we.
@StoudemireSue @jt_hammons Nuclear has not "stalled" &amp; I am not sure why the @ajceditor let his associates use that word. In fact, the project is at its fastest pace. All of the really big solar is done by mostly Ga Power &amp; any city like Athens or Atlanta that want to be 100% renewable will work with them.

@dana1981 @flannerykw Which is why President Obama's climate czar told me in a White House meeting that without existing nuclear, and many new builds, an 80 percent clean energy goal by 2050 could not be attained.  But natural gas has been the nemesis for new nuclear because of low prices.
@dana1981 @flannerykw We have a version of this we are comfortable with.  It is called "community solar."  You make a monthly investment, by choice, and you receive a dividend back on your utility bill based on the performance of "your" portion of the array you own.
@MikeLynchTweets No pretending.  Just that the trend line is going in the right direction.  Only those states that are closing existing nuclear plants &amp; replacing with nat gas are seeing increases in CO2.  Let's sit tight &amp; not do a paradigm shift.

@nuppal @GeorgiaPSC FYI, the PSC doesn't generate or sell electricity.  We regulate utilities and list the information and history as a public service.  To really see an accurate picture of solar in Georgia, go to https://t.co/HNawm81PFh as well as https://t.co/vty03IM9cM
@nuppal @GeorgiaPSC You are right.  It needs to be updated.  Back in 2003 though, there was extra cost.  The Green Energy Program was a premium paid by subscribers that triggered the deployment of solar.  The program was not successful.
@nuppal @GeorgiaPSC We killed that program in 2016.  The ASI and REDI program is much better.  I'll make sure the website reflects its "death" going forward.

@BibleHuey @JKempEnergy @ToshibaUSA @WECNuclear Huey, thanks for engaging on this. My job is actually to protect the ratepayers now and into the future--against issues that may come up that might put our state in a pickle (higher gas prices or CO2 cost).  Noting obscure about bankruptcy either--it made our situation difficult.
@BibleHuey @JKempEnergy @ToshibaUSA The @WECNuclear bankruptcy was beyond our control. You should always mention that to be fair. It invalidated an otherwise well designed contract.
@MarkArum Treasure Island--from back in the 70's.  Got all my @Mattel Hotwheels there.
@BibleHuey @JKempEnergy @ToshibaUSA I think only time will tell whether we made right decision. As natural gas ticks up in price, the Vogtle value proposition gets better.  If we export LNG in a big way in the US, Vogtle's value probably grows again.  And if there is ever a price on carbon, the PSC will be heroic.

@SolarInMASS @RabagoEnergy @sas_cleanenergy I'm just saying that the left is often hypocritical.  They cancel carbon-free nuclear, they lecture me on CO2 but don't drive EVs or have solar as I have had, and in the case of the fires, they ignore thinning &amp; forest management because they hate to chop a tree down.
@SolarInMASS @RabagoEnergy @sas_cleanenergy Those fires, half of which are on federal lands, are undoing all of the other climate measures CA has put in place.  https://t.co/AeGCOfUeBI
@SolarInMASS @RabagoEnergy @sas_cleanenergy According to scientist Pieter Tans, head of carbon cycle greenhouse gases group w/ Greenhouse Gas Reference Network,  a very large, very hot fire destroying 500,000 acres could emit the same total amount to CO2 as 6 large coal-fired power plants in 1 year. https://t.co/jzEmkd4H2k

@SolarInMASS @RabagoEnergy @sas_cleanenergy Californians consider CO2 a hazardous pollutant.  I think there are far more concerning issues like the proper recycling and disposition of nuclear "waste," coal ash beneficiation, broader use of EVs, more market-based solar and helping low-income customers save $ on their bills.

@sas_cleanenergy @RabagoEnergy No manipulation I don't think--maybe too much dependence on emerging technologies.  If we finish Vogtle at current budget, &amp; nat gases prices rise, we are winners.  If we finish Vogtle &amp; there is a future carbon tax, we are winners.  If both happen, GA will be sitting pretty.

@RabagoEnergy @sas_cleanenergy It may not work everywhere, but still works here in GA.

@kcboyce As we see more electric school buses (and they are coming), school systems will have a chance to charge overnight on cheap rates and connect to grid from 2pm to 7pm in the summer and feed back onto the grid for net profit during highest grid hours.  A 2020's phenom I think.

He and his wife have fostered crack babies and know all too well the impact.
@ShawnReynolds_ Actually, the candidate-to-candidate questions are the status quo and the "way @atlpressclub does things year after year.  So I agree, no need to keep that segment just because "that's the way it has always been done."
@atlpressclub @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA @tedmetz I am afraid watching it once is all I can handle.  Suggestion--Bill Nigut to moderate, and don't ever try it live again.  We have some really smart reporters out there so get rid of the candidate-to-candidate questions that waste precious air time.
If you watched the @mygpb debate, you may have been disappointed as I was.  (And I am a GPB financial supporter too.) Fire alarm at beginning, constant mix-up by the moderator with who gets what time, &amp; those awful candidate-to-candidate questions. @atlpressclub needs to revamp.

@Graham4GA @chuckeatonga Comm. Eaton is technically correct.  The Georgia Power ratepayers did not shoulder any of it:  $700M write-down, &amp; $400M in limbo. PSC signaled "no go" on recovery.

@CarlileJennifer And next year when we do our IRP (Integrated Resource Plan, circa 1991), you'll see a call for more solar, and I imagine the PSC will approve more.  There will be zero indigenous wind--I can promise you that, unless we buy it from a state like Oklahoma.  Solar with no subsidy.
These extensions are worth billions.  I was at GA Tech last week &amp; the solar panels we installed on the Rec Center for the 1996 Olympics are in such bad shape that they have disconnected them from the building.  Life of panels was 20 years.  I love solar, but life cycle matters. https://t.co/KLaybt8QmS

@EvanSchultheis @nuclear94 @thadmoore But for the millions of Chinese sucking in particulate matter from unscrubbed coal units, it is worth the cost.
@GSCorcoran Even with higher cost, we simply don‚Äôt know what the world will look like in 20, 40 or 60 years...and what fuel will cost. If there is a cost on carbon down the road, these reactors will be a good deal for them. And Democrats and the left want that carbon pricing. You nailed it.
@EvanSchultheis @NoPlantVogtle When we converted Plant McDonough from coal to gas, we had 3 cost overrun incidents due to labor pool. Building anything large, including stadiums, is risky.
