Judge allows Zimmerman's transcripts but says irrelevant course work needs to be redacted. Defense is still arguing against it.
Defense says they are on a fishing expedition &amp; the state says the transcripts r relevant b/c it shows Zimmerman took criminal justice
Before the jury is let back in the court room, the defense objects to state's request to allow Zimmerman's college transcripts
And we are back
To my last tweet, Dr. Rao confirmed
The defense asks about Trayvon's injuries and notes that he had abrasions on his knuckles/hands and a gun shot wound.
Dr. Rao calls Zimmerman's injuries minor and won't confirm his head was slammed to the ground but says it made impact 2 the concrete 3 times

Serino says "legally speaking" he didn't see anything wrong with Zimmerman following Trayvon.
RT @JeffWeinerOS: Serino says a possible break-in tool ("slim jim") found in the area days later. #GeorgeZImmerman #TrayvonMartin
In short, the defense is trying to break down the use of the curse words by Zimmerman as not concerning.
State finishes redirecting and now Defense cross-examining, again. Asking about Zimmerman's use of a&amp;$hole. Suggesting it was slang
State combing through Serino's investigation of the case. Ask if he interviewed Rachel Jeantal, says no. Or review 711 video, says no.
RT @JeffWeinerOS: BDLR points out that there's a numerical address on front of house #GeorgeZImmerman walked past. Serino agrees. #Zimmerma‚Ä¶
Note, the state is asking more questions of Serimo during their redirect than the initial questioning. Seems to be planned
State trying hard to question Serino in a way that suggest Zimmerman profiled and followed Trayvon. Defense objecting rapidly
State asking directly if Zimmerman profiled Trayvon. Serino says "it could be construed as such." #zimmermantrial
State plays Zimmerman's initial 911 call about Trayvon and asks if calling some1 "F!?$&amp;ing punks" ill-will and spiteful... Serino agreed
The state is redirecting Serino now. Trying to backtrack some of the statements he made now when answering the defense's questions

Serino just walked in &amp; now the jury is walking in. The judge allowed the comments of Serino to be disregarded by the jury. #zimmermantrial
State is now trying to get a witness who is not in the country allowed to testify via video (Skype I'm assuming). Judge tabled it until tmrw
Defense obviously disagrees but it seems the law is on the state's side.
State is arguing that Serino's statements on Zimmerman's truthfulness &amp; veracity should be struck from the record and jury ordered to ignore
Today starts with the State asking to strike some of the testimony of the lead investigator Serino from yesterday

Singleton says she assumed she informed Zimmerman that he killed some1 after she told him they couldn't id the body. Says he looked shocked
Defense asking Singleton if Zimmerman knew Trayvon was dead.
Singleton says she spoke with most of the witnesses about what happened that night
This all was said the night of the shooting. O'mara for the defense is currently questioning Singleton
Zimmerman tells Singleton that it's a sin 2 kill someone. Singleton then tells him:I dont think God meant that when you r defending ur life
Zimmerman asked Singleton if she was Catholic b/c she wore a cross. She said no she is Christian.
Court is back in session, the state continues to interview Singleton the police officer who interviewed Zimmerman the night of the shooting
@patjburns yes, I am Florida covering the trial
Court in recess until 1:30

The statement that George Zimmerman wrote that night is being read and projected on the screen
RT @khightower: Singleton says that she also had #zimmerman to write on paper his statement of events as well. #TrayvonMartin
This was the first time that jurors heard an account from Zimmerman in his own words of what happened (via the recorded police interview)
Zimmerman says he held down Trayvon because he thought he had a brick. Soon after the police showed up.
Zimmerman says while holding him down after he shot Trayvon that a neighbor asked should he call the police. He told him no and to help him
Zimmerman said during the interview that Trayvon was saying ow, ow while Zimmerman was on top of him. Says he was holding Trayvon down
Zimmerman says he pulled it out and shot Trayvon and Trayvon said "You got it, you got it." this is when Zimmerman gets on top of Trayvon
Zimmerman says Trayvon told him you are going to die tonight and Zimmerman says he thought he felt Trayvon hand near his gun
During interview Zimmerman said that he was screaming help and Trayvon put his hands on his nose and mouth
Jurors actively taking notes while the recording is being played
Zimmerman says he then fell back to the ground after the punch and Trayvon got on top of him and started banging his head
Zimmerman says he said nothing and then Trayvon punched him in the nose after saying "Well now you have a Problem."

Sorry voice*
State asking Nakasone about people familiar with a voice being able to recognize the vice better
State redirecting now

Nakasone says when multiple people listen to a call to id a voice there is a "increased risk in bias"
States objection was over ruled. West repeats his question
Attys at the bench over state's objections of Don West's questions of Nakasone regarding multiple people familiar with a voice id'ing
RT @khightower: Prosecution has objected twice to defense trying to ask questions it says are beyond his expertise. Attys at bench now.
West still asking about Nakasone's expertise and qualifications
Nakasone notes that he has received many emails from scientist agreeing w/his opinion that it is difficult 2 determine a voice from screams
West is asking questions of Nakasone about the recognition and accolades he has received.
Prosecution is done. Guy West for the defense begins to cross examine Nakasone
Nakasone says it occurred 2 him that he couldn't determine the screams on the call. The defense I'm sure is very happy with this testimony.
Nakasone notes that anyone in distress someone's voice will have a higher pitch regardless of age.
To clarify, Nakasone says he could only isolate 2.35 seconds of the screams in the call
Nakasone on the 911 call: "Not fit for the purpose of voice recognition"
Nakasone now describing the infamous 911 call where screams and gun shot could be heard. Says it was 2 mins &amp; 34 sec &amp; screaming 2.35 secs
Nakasone says "Far field Voices" in phone calls have problems analyzing because it is mixed with other background noises
Nakasone says when analyzing phone calls it is very difficult to hear voices distances away, calls them "far field voices"
Majority of jurors taking notes as Nakasone testifies #Zimmermantrial
Irony of the witness being called by the state  is just a few weeks ago the state argued for Nakasone not to testify.
Don West stands up and says there "absolutely not" any objection to this witness. Says he "encourages" the court to have this witness.
Nakasone estimated that he worked on 3000 cases
Witness is Dr. Nakasone, works for the FBI as a senior scientist. Describes himself as voice recognition analyzer among other things
The witness is not the medical examiner. I stand corrected
State calls the next witness. I believe it is the medical examiner. Defense says they have "A Matter" on this witness &amp; approach the bench
Good morning, court is back in session. The jury is about to walk in now.
Sorry, my phone is ABOUT to die.
Tweets coming back soon. Phone bout to die.
Witness testifies that Zimmerman told the police that he shot Trayvon Martin
Witness says Zimmerman told him: "I was defending myself and shot him." Note, every member of the jury took notes when this was said
The defense wants the jury to believe Zimmerman was beat up, proving that point now with this witness
Defense: Zimmerman was staggering and looked like he got his butt beat? Witness: Yes
The prosecution is cross examining now
Witness says Zimmerman didn't appear to be in shock, explained that Zimmerman seemed coherent after shooting Martin: "Like any other person"
To clarify, Zimmerman told the witness not to call the police when asked because he already did
Witness told Zimmerman's wife that her husband just shot someone.
Zimmerman asked witness to call his wife for him when the police showed up and handcuffed him
Witness talked to Zimmerman after he shot Trayvon and asked him if he should call the police and Zimmerman said no

Recess until 1 o'clock
O'Mara reading the witness's original statement says the "Black Guy" was on top...this isn't in the state's favor, jurors looking intently
O'Mara to the states witness, "The guy with the red (Zimmerman) was always on The bottom." witness: correct
A few moments of levity with this witness, prosecution ask if the witness MMA trains, sarcastically says he doesn't think he is in shape 2
Witness confirms he didn't see blows but arms moving downward
Witness says he didn't use "ground and Pound" initially in his written statement 2 describe the person straddling the other: TM on top of GZ
The state is redirecting now
O'Mara ask for the witness to use his common sense if it was Zimmerman screaming for help, says in his opinion, yes.
The sketch was something the witness drew before giving testimony today
Witness sketched a picture of who was on top and again confirms it was Trayvon
Jurors just handed a picture of Trayvon at 711 that O'Mara showed* the witness, asking if the person in the picture was on top."
Witness confirms
Jurors just handed a picture of Trayvon at 711 that O'Mara should the witness, asking if the person in the picture was on top.
O'Mara now is now using direct names instead of the man on top and bottom. Starts question with  did you see Trayvon Martin on top...
Current witness says he didn't hear a second voice besides the screams for help, most of other witnesses agree
Today is the first time Martin's mom stayed in court during the screams for help on the infamous 911 call where a shot could be heard
As of now one of the major disputes in testimony is whom witnesses saw on top, a few have said Zimmerman but today's says Martin
Not the best testimony for the state's case against Zimmerman, though the witness says he couldn't see if Martin slammed Zimmerman's head
Witness assumes that it was Zimmerman screaming for help because that is who he thinks he saw on bottom of the ground and pound position
O'Mara ask if the witness thinks the person on bottom was screaming for help says he would assume b/c that person is usually the 1 screaming
Witness says he saw the position of Martin on top of Zimmerman as the "Ground and pound" position in MMA fighting
Witness says the dominant position, according to MMA Fights, is the person on the bottom
O'Mara's questioning of witness says again the person with dark clothing-Martin- was on top and with lighter clothing- Zimmerman- on bottom
O'Mara gets on the ground to show the positions of GZ and TM, some jurors stood up from their seats to see
RT @JeffWeinerOS: O'Mara asks if initial screams could've been from sidewalk T. Good: "I thought we weren't speculating." #GeorgeZimmerman ‚Ä¶
The defense has its turn to question the witness now, starts by asking if the witness doesn't want to be there. Witness says it has 2 b done
Prosecution's witness puts Trayvon Martin on top and ask if he ever saw the person on top slamming the person on bottom's head: answers no
Witness comparing the confrontation that GZ and TM too a Mixed Martial Arts fight
The prosecution witness is testifying what he remembers seeing but admits it was hard to see: this could benefit the defense
State prosecutor makes loud noise punching his fist and ask if that is what the witness heard. He said no.
Good heard noises outside and walked to the glass door and cracked the blinds to see outside
State's next witness is John Good
Defense asking questions now

Pros: did the man who was walking have any trouble walking, stumble? Witness: No
