@ChelseaHouska Aubree is a smart little cookie. I just adore her
@AmberLPortwood Just saw the last episode. Don't listen to all the negative comments. You are a great mom. I was and still am proud of you. Even at your worst, you unselfishly put Leah first. Many moms screw their kids up. One thing you and Gary did right is work together as parents.
@TylerBaltierra @CatelynnLowell I am glad she gets help. There comes a time when you have to get up and go even when u don't want to. She has the tools its up to her to use them
@TylerBaltierra I don't think you should leave your wife. You are doing the right thing.
