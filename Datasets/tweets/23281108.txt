That said, I do agree with the SG's office that the GOP controlled VA House of Delegates does not have standing to pursue this appeal. It is time voters in Virginia have constitutional districts.
The GOP did not use race as a factor, it set a hard and fast 55% black voting age population as a floor.  It is hard to see how you think race did not "predominate" under those circumstances. Its why the VA civil rights group agree with me and not the Trump SG's office.
Here is what the trial court found: "the legislature achieved a 55% minimum BVAP in each district by drawing boundaries based on that threshold, we now find as a matter of fact that the legislature employed a mandatory 55% BVAP floor in constructing all 12 challenged districts."
This badly misstates what the GOP did in Virginia. They set a 55% floor for black population in 12 districts-regardless of the conditions on the ground.They did not "check from time to time"-the GOP had it set to cruise control that could not be removed. The SG's brief is wrong. https://t.co/lhAdj1O972

Sorry--It was John Thune, not Larry Pressler.
So where does that leave us for 2018? I again expect one statewide recount-able election and a bunch of House recounts. My job for the next few days is to try to figure out how to prepare for wherever they may be. The end.
2016 was a busy election for me. I was Gen Counsel for Clinton, and preparing for two SCOTUS redistricting arguments on Dec 5 (I won both). Luckily Ayotte conceded to Hassan quickly. In NC, Cooper had a close election, but thankfully the result was never in doubt.
Some in the GOP briefly thought they could contest the Warner 2014 reelect, but after the margin grew to over 17,000, Gillespie conceded.
On election night 2013 it became clear that McAuliffe was going to win handily, but the AG's race in VA was close. It ended up very close indeed. After initially trailing, Mark Herring pulled it out in the recount. It was the only recount where I have been able to live at home.
In 2012 Heidi Heitcamp won a narrow, but convincing victory. 2936 votes might not seem like a lot, but it was insurmountable. Luckily the GOP saw it that way as well and conceded.
In 2010 I did a reprise in Minnesota--this time for Mark Dayton.  Unlike Franken, the result was never in doubt.  Dayton won easily, and became a successful two-term governor.
2008 brought us the recount between Franken and Coleman. It remains the largest, longest and most expensive recount of all time. After being certified the loser, after 7 months of recounts/contests/litigation, Franken emerged victorious. I was in MN so long I paid taxes there.
2006 again involved a very close Senate race where the Republican (this time Conrad Burns) conceded literally as I landed in the state. Jon Tester became a US Senator! And again, I turned around and flew back home.
The Gregiore v Rossi recount/contest was the first major post-2000 recount. The effects of Bush v Gore were evident. It went on for months, involving court cases on a number of side issues. After initially being declared the loser, Gregiore emerged narrowly on top.
In 2002, Tim Johnson narrowly won re-election.  I was certain their would be a recount, but hours after I arrived in South Dakota, Pressler conceded.  I turned around and flew back home.
2000 was an obvious turning point for recounts--because of Bush v Gore. After that, recounts got much bigger, more expensive and viewed as legal, rather than political disputes. That trend continues until today. I was in Washington State helping Maria Cantwell secure her victory.
That was followed by the 1998 Senate recount in Nevada. Harry Reid had defeated John Ensign, but there were issues involving Washoe County's voting machines, so we did a recount.  Reid still won. Dean Heller was the GOP Secretary of State overseeing the recount.
My first statewide recount was actually a contest over the 1996 Louisiana Senate election. It was conducted in the US Senate (I was actually hired by the Rules Committee).
During my career handling recounts, we have averaged one statewide recount-able election (excluding for president). Not all of these have resulted in recounts, but almost all have involved some post election legal activity. https://t.co/F0XnX2RP7m

The article hangs on this Cook quote: ‚ÄúThe past few weeks haven‚Äôt really diminished Democrats‚Äô chances of a takeover by that much". How do you go with that lede?
@pkcapitol @WaPoSean Here is the quote from Cook: ‚ÄúThe past few weeks haven‚Äôt really diminished Democrats‚Äô chances of a takeover by that much, but they‚Äôve increased the chances of a small Democratic majority.‚Äù Do you really think that supports the headline/lede?

This is why the District Court will likely need to redraw the map. This is not a case of "both sides". The GOP engaged in racial gerrymandering in violation of the US Constitution for cynical partisan reasons and continues to pursue that agenda. 10/10
Since then, the state House GOP has continued to fight us in court &amp; seek further delay &amp; appeal. The map they offered last week is another cynical effort to protect their partisan majority at any cost. Democrats, including the Governor, have correctly called it out as such. 9/10
After another new trial on remand, where the GOP fought us, the District Court struck down the current state House districts as unconstitutional. The ever-patient court then gave the legislature time to attempt to enact a new remedial map. 8/10
Think about that.  How often does every Justice of this Supreme Court agree on a case involving voting rights or redistricting! That is how bad the Virginia GOP's behavior was. 7/10
We then brought a similar case involving 12 state House districts which were drawn using the inflexible, one size fits all, 55% rule. This time it was the state House GOP that fought us st every turn. A unanimous Supreme Court agreed with us as to 11 of the 12 districts. 6/10
The result was a court redrawn map that reduced the Black voting population from that one district and created a second district where Black voters could exercise voting power. The GOP members of Congress fought this too. 5/10
In our first lawsuit, we challenged the application of this rule to the congressional map--and in particular to Congressman Scott's district. The GOP members of Congress fought us every step of the way. We won in the district court and a unanimous Supreme Court agreed. 4/10
The Virginia GOP's 55% rule was unbreakable--a 54.9% district was rejected by the GOP--it had to be 55% or greater Black. The use of race in this way was as cynical and it was unconstitutional. 3/10
After 2010 the GOP controlled the VA legislature &amp; governorship and thus controlled redistricting. In order to minimize Democratic seats, they created a hard &amp; fast rule that any district where Black voters would elect their candidate of choice had to be at least 55% Black. 2/10
The Virginia media is doing a lot of "both sides" coverage of the ongoing redistricting dispute involving the House of Delegates map redraw. As the lawyer who argued this and the companion congressional redistricting case in the Supreme Court, I want to add some context. 1/10

RT @rickhasen: Seems like what they really need to do is to delete the original tweet. https://t.co/kXgiPR8j4x
Bottom line: The scope of the fraud is growing. Scott Taylor has so far refused to offer a full explanation of his role in this scheme--perhaps because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The GOP, which is usually quick to proclaim fraud, remains silent.
363 names are on petitions that were circulated by Scott Taylor staffers who affirmed to witnessing forged signatures.
We have submitted 40 sworn affidavits from voters who say their names or the names of their relatives were forged. An independent analysis by the media says the number is 60 and 4 of those who signed are, in fact, dead.
Significantly, all of the petition pages circulated by Scott Taylor staffers list the address that doesn't exist. A majority of the signature forms submitted by Taylor staffers indicate that they were from a common set of copies/copier.
Brown lists 2 addresses on forms submitted to support her petition. Records indicate that she doesn't live at one of them and that the other one doesn't exist. The one that doesn't exist is similar to one that does exist, but records show that she doesn't live at that one either.
The scandal surrounding GOP Congressman Scott Taylor and the fraudulent efforts to get an independent--Shaun Brown--on the ballot continues to grow. Last night we filed a supplementary brief with the court with new information. Here are some highlights:

@imillhiser Have Faith!
That is why the SCOTUS won‚Äôt upend this victory‚Äî Because in the end you have a trial court making findings of fact about the credibility of witnesses. This is not something the SCOTUS second guesses. And yet, that is all the Virginia GOP has to quibble with. (8/8)
More of the quote: ‚ÄúAs the majority makes clear, the resolution of this case turns on credibility determinations which we, as the triers of fact, must reach...I cannot subscribe to the credibility assessments that animate the majority on that outcome determinative issue.‚Äù (7/ )
That is why the dissenting judge calls the "credibility assessments that animate the majority...outcome determinative.‚Äù   (6/ )
Indeed in Cooper v Harris (another racial gerrymandering case) that  the reason why the SCOTUS agreed to strike down the maps‚Äîthey were deferring to the trial court‚Äôs findings of fact. https://t.co/wdasC9S0I5 (5/ )
Because of that, the only remaining dispute in today‚Äôs opinion was over findings of fact. The SCOTUS will only review the trial court‚Äôs finding of facts to see if its ‚Äúclearly erroneous‚Äù.  This is a very deferential standard. (4/ )
So Kennedy, Alito and the Chief are already on record supporting our view of the law. Thomas concurred in part and dissented in part.  Only Gorsuch is an unknown. (3/ )
First, this case has already been to the Supreme Court, and it decided the case 7-1 in favor of the plaintiffs, and against the position urged by the GOP legislature. https://t.co/1Svw57zs9o . (2/ )
I have received several questions about this case and whether the SCOTUS will simply overturn the results.  Here is why that is very unlikely in this case (1/ ) https://t.co/Kr6ePFLBxF

So basically, it is all going to depend on what evidence the prosecutors have regarding Cohen‚Äôs motives, and Trump‚Äôs awareness.		Done. (10/10)
Finally, none of this is affected by whether Trump paid him back or not ‚Äì its equally illegal for Cohen to make a loan as to have made a repaid contribution. (9/)
That of course assumes a sitting president can be indicted, which is a subject for another day. (8/)
3. As it relates to Trump: He could be found criminal liable as well if he had ‚Äúknowledge of what [Cohen] was doing, in relevant part though not necessarily as to every detail, and he had knowledge [Cohen‚Äôs] purpose‚Äù. (7/)
2. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, if [Cohen] have made the gift or payment notwithstanding the election, it does not become a contribution merely because [Cohen‚Äôs] payment might have some impact on the election.‚Äù (6/)
As you can see, the Court ruled as follows: 		1. ‚ÄúThe government does not have to prove that the sole or only purpose of the [payment by Cohen] was to influence the election. People rarely act with a single purpose in mind.‚Äù (5/)
Rather the judge said that it was for a jury to decide what the motives of the payment were.  Therefore, the clearest understanding of the law is found in the jury instructions, which I posted here. https://t.co/OoLCqDVKRZ
It is important to keep in mind that Edwards was indicted and the court refused to dismiss the indictment as a matter of law. This means that the judge rejected the idea that the type of conduct (someone paying hush money during a campaign) could not violate the law. (3/)
In Edwards, wealthy individuals paid to hide Edward‚Äôs former mistress/child from the media during a campaign. Several commentators have falsely asserted that because Edwards was not found guilty by a jury, that it means that there is no legal violation possible here (2/).
There has been lots written recently about Cohen‚Äôs payment to Stormy Daniels and the campaign finance laws. As some have noted, DOJ prosecuted former Senator John Edwards under very similar circumstances.  This thread will explain that case &amp; its implications here. (1/)
Worse still, it appears that 100% of Trump's personal lawyers don't understand campaign finance law. https://t.co/QP7Sx6LeCt
In case there was any doubt ‚Äî Giuliani is not an expert in campaign finance law. Indeed, he appears to know nothing about campaign finance law. https://t.co/B8RWsQN4oS
GOP passed a bill to prevent college students from voting in NH elections. We sued &amp; fought to get access to the voter reg database. Court agreed. GOP leg has introduced a new law to prohibit disclosure ‚Äúin response to a subpoena or civil litigation discovery request." Amazing.
To be clear, there is no serious campaign finance lawyer arguing that these payments were not illegal. The only issue is whether they were criminal or (merely) civil violations. And Giuliani is helping those arguing they were criminal. https://t.co/GgHF6bClD3
Things that are now very clear: 	  --Trump and Cohen violated the campaign finance laws; 	  --Cohen is going to be indicted soon; 	  --Trump needs a very good lawyer; 	  --Rudy Giuliani is not a very good lawyer.

Most of Trumps legal troubles are still shrouded in mystery. These two things I can say this for certain: (1) Giuliani seems to know nothing about campaign finance laws. (2) His statements significantly increased the likelihood that the Stormy payments violated the criminal law.
