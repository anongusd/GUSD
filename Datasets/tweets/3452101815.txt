Like, if I‚Äôm buying a roguelike I want to know if it‚Äôs still fun after you‚Äôve done all the basic stuff. In that case, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre judging an intense story by how long it takes to read/watch.

I'll probably add to this thread tomorrow after my commute. Not that the genre isn't already successfully and brilliantly written about by experts; I just like providing a total outsider's perspective sometimes.
They never get in depth enough for my liking, or really dig in and explore those questions about God and faith! Where's the Christian, or at least Christian rock, version of "Hallelujah"? Sometimes the ending is "I don't even know the Name," not "You raise me up so I can stand."
Because these songs almost always describe a PAST crisis of faith. If the dark point they're talking about is in the present, they're talking about how Jesus is always there to pick them up. Without fail.
3. Another subject is "I was going through some tough crap and Jesus saved me," and this one is where I kind of get sad about lost potential.
I was recently listening to one where this guy was asking Jesus to take the stage at his show: "If you wanna steal my show / I‚Äôll sit back and watch you go." It's kinda romantic. Like a rockstar asking a groupie to get up and dance because he likes watching her more than himself.
In addition to aforementioned "your love is fierce" complete with tidal wave and hurricane metaphors, at least one song refers to Jesus' beauty, and I'm pretty sure I've heard some variant of "you're the only one I love/want" a few times.
2. One of the relatively few subjects of Christian rock is basically a spectrum from "I'm in love with Jesus" to "I'm desperately in love with Jesus."  	I like to play a game called "love song or Christian rock station?" I've been wrong before.
(The image quality seems to be terrible, so that first one, which is now one of my favorites, goes like this: 	Hello, my name is regret / I‚Äôm pretty sure we have met / Every single day of your life / I‚Äôm the whisper inside / That won‚Äôt let you forget)

@edotwil Because lots of times you scratch the surface of something with no canon rep and a metric ton of either queercoded characters or homoeroticism without disclaimer, or both, pops out 		Can‚Äôt really do that when almost everyone is consistently asserting they‚Äôre straight
@aliciamargaritx I‚Äôm honestly thinking I should study it more! Because while I‚Äôve read/seen a lot of stuff with queer/queercoded characters I‚Äôm certainly not a scholar of the way lgbtq existence in media changed over the past century
And this isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. This is kind of what the transition from queercoding to queerbaiting is all about. I'm having a hard time putting a finger on it in tweet format though I'm gonna go take a walk
as a character lgbtq audiences saw themselves in, even if not written with intentional queer coding.		But now that such coding and such a response can be talked about openly, he's written as so unambiguously straight that he clarifies it in-universe
Idk like this feels like a really bizarre way of thinking but I almost feel like if the show had been written forty, fifty years ago, Evan (loner, "different," affectionate towards real and imagined friends) could have been both written and perceived very differently 1/2
I could write paragraphs and paragraphs about the scene in Dear Evan Hansen where everyone onstage panics at the idea that Evan could be perceived as gay and rushes to reassure the rest of the play's world (and the audience) that he's not

@rexparker It‚Äôs not even particularly original. I‚Äôve definitely seen ‚Äútrigger warning‚Äù as a tag line for some forgettable action movie.

@rexparker It's a bit of a weird piece overall
I've always felt like a defining characteristic of horror is that it's meant to be, well, scary.
