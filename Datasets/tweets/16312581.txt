@page88 @rgeller @errolmorris Controversial to read things these days. And I suppose in this too, @realDonaldTrump sets the tone.
@rgeller Of course. That said, the whole story is about optics. The negative messaging associated with the MAGA movement is not up for debate. The red hat the boy wore communicates intolerance (even hate) to about half the U.S. population, and most of the ppl who protested in DC that day.
