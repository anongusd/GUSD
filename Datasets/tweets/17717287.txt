Scaparrotti: @US_EUCOM supports @NATO, which remains, as Secretary Mattis said, the "bedrock" of our transatlantic security.  #EUCOM2017
Scaparrotti: In response to Russian aggression, EUCOM strengthened relationships w/ Baltic nations, Poland, Turkey, &amp; Ukraine.  #EUCOM2017
Scaparrotti: @US_EUCOM is adjusting posture, plans, &amp; readiness to remain relevant to the threats we face.  #EUCOM2017
Scaparrotti: @US_EUCOM has shifted focus from security cooperation &amp; engagement to deterrence &amp; defense.  #EUCOM2017
Scaparrotti: Political volatility &amp; economic uncertainty compounded by trans-regional, multi-domain &amp; multi-functional threats. #EUCOM2017
EUCOM's relationship w/ NATO &amp; 51 countries within our AOR provides USA w/	network of partners who support global operations. #EUCOM2017
