@donjpickerel @MrsRabbitResist I didn’t say you were a liberal, I compared you to liberals because you’re incapable of using your brain when it comes to criticizing religion👌🏼👌🏼☝🏼
@donjpickerel @MrsRabbitResist Yes, Christianity also spread like a disease. I really don’t get why liberals love attacking Christianity but when it comes to Islam it’s suddenly a sacred subject.
@donjpickerel @MrsRabbitResist Sooo...just more examples of Islam spreading like a disease?
@leeleeb50 Or ya know, electronic voting with a blockchain to track votes. Just because it was used in the past doesn’t mean it’s good.
@ShaalanHesham @MrsRabbitResist If a literal interpretation is worse than a liberal interpretation, the source obviously isn’t very good. Religion is a disease, and Islam is among the worst.
@donjpickerel @MrsRabbitResist Maybe the fact it spreads like a disease is part of what’s so dangerous about it 😱😱☝🏼
@MagdaDavitt77 If you think it’s possible to be an intelligent theologian, you’re not intelligent 😂😂💯
@MrsRabbitResist Bad ideas are not immune from criticism because they are held by a minority. Islam would be hilarious if it weren’t so dangerous.

@mosswood_pixie @SenFeinstein No that’s literally the whole point of the 1st amendment. Some people are wrong. That’s none of the government’s business.
@TahitiPlumeria @SenFeinstein No. Doing away with lifetime appointments would erode the autonomy of the judiciary. Judges would be more inclined to rule in ways that would curry favor with future presidents, legislatures, or constituencies.
@RandyMi72633637 @SenFeinstein So you want planned parenthood to give out false information just to spite conservatives? 🙄🙄🙄
@SenFeinstein Just because they’re wrong doesn’t mean the government needs to prevent them from spreading their message. People need to be allowed the freedom to discern for themselves what’s true, even if sometimes some people get duped.

@dedeauxb @SarahPalinUSA No one cares if you agree. The courts say you’re wrong. Seriously, why do you hate the constitution so much?
@dedeauxb @SarahPalinUSA Because this is America. If you don’t like people having rights this isn’t the place for you.
@rlind1968 @SarahPalinUSA No, you just made that up because it feels good. If rights were only for citizens, the constitution wouldn’t say “persons,” it would say “citizens.” I’m guessing you’ve never read it though so you wouldn’t know that.

@smleach1217 @Lars_Shitposter @JohnPhillips No, don’t be an idiot. That’s how it works in authoritarian regimes. In the US you have a right to be secure in your home and free from unreasonable search and seizure. Someone calling the cops doesn’t magically grant them a warrant.

@hamsize @JohnPhillips @Blklivesmatter He was in his own home. Cops don’t get to kill you for possessing a gun or ignoring presets IN YOUR OWN HOME
@Lars_Shitposter @JohnPhillips Cops don’t have a right to force you to correspond with them. Citizens do have a right to possess firearms and close the doors to their own home.
@SmithsonSheila @halstark88 @JohnPhillips No, that’s the consequence of not listening to the King’s Guard. In the US, we have these things called rights. And telling cops to fuck off and get off your property is one of them.
@SmithsonSheila @JohnPhillips You have ever right to close the door on cops. Have you never read the constitution?
@ZootPlays @kinderpring @Cakemon4 @JohnPhillips Yea, a warrant is what makes a person wanted. You need a warrant. Duuuuuuuuuuhhhh.
@SmithsonSheila @Cakemon4 @ZootPlays @JohnPhillips Refusing to waive your constitutional rights is a “big no-no” now?

@christyallison @Swiftyme123 @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan None of the definitions in that link have to do with anything that’s free.
@christyallison @Swiftyme123 @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan There is no definition of entitled that means getting free stuff. It’s not the context, it’s just that you don’t understand what the word means.
@christyallison @AlabamaBlueDot @MEUonamission @SpeakerRyan They’re not paying people with previous people’s payments though. They’re investing the money and paying people with the returns on those investments.
@Swiftyme123 @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan Yes that is very much what an entitlement is. You’re entitled to things you’ve paid for.
@KayHarvey00 @DorchTroy @lizzieshore @saffordtweets @SpeakerRyan If you’re entitled to it because you paid for it, what would make you think someone else is entitled to take it from you? Like are you trying to be stupid?
@lizzieshore @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan Yes it is. An entitlement means you are entitled to it, rather than it being a gift/donation/voluntary contribution. Social security is as much of an entitlement program as we have in the US.
@cerullianblue @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan Yes it is. You’re entitled to it as a result of paying into it. It’s an entitlement.
@KayHarvey00 @DickInman @saffordtweets @SpeakerRyan Yes, you’re entitled to it because you pay into it. That is literally what makes it an entitlement.
@gilesgoatboy @saffordtweets @KayHarvey00 @SpeakerRyan Why is it ludicrous to say you’re entitled to money from the program you paid into?
@christyallison @AlabamaBlueDot @MEUonamission @SpeakerRyan Social security is in no way anything even close to a ponzi scheme.

@NolanHolmberg @borchich @RoKhanna @marcorubio Yeah, of course if it were packaged in a bill with cuts to the program it would be bad. But independent of other changes to the program, why’s this a bad idea?
@RoKhanna @marcorubio I really don’t understand why this is a bad idea. It allows people the option of raising several kids or retiring earlier. It would also increase the average voter’s opposition to cutting the program since they’d see benefits throughout their life instead of just when they’re old
@GregAFish @RoKhanna Not really though. Automation is profitable independent of wage levels. Whether it takes me 2 years or 10 years to recoup my initial investment, I’m still gonna invest in automation.
@RoKhanna According to this graph, $23/hour should be the minimum wage in the least expensive state

@kellyjwise @AtheistRepublic Why should everyone have the right to use government resources to establish and enforce a contract that takes away someone’s rights? That would never be ok with an employer, so why is it obvious with marriage?
@therealOpuni @AtheistRepublic Not being married isn’t the same as being alone 😂😂🤔😂
@Tothiwim @AtheistRepublic Well that’s a pretty dumb romanticization of the concept.

@Cwispy2Trains @Cernovich @StefanMolyneux That is literally impossible to know unless he releases his personal &amp; business taxes. You’re either lying or you’ve been duped again.

@capthss @AtheistRepublic In case you’re actually serious, a parent is legally responsible for their child for 18 years. A lot can change in 18 years. Moreover, that question is irrelevant unless you argue that children should be punished for the laziness/stupidity/bad luck of their parents.
@AtheistRepublic If you can’t provide for the kid without stealing &amp; you only steal from someone who can afford to lose what you take, then it’s not morally wrong to steal property to preserve life. But it’s wrong to willfully put yourself in such a position out of laziness or apathy.

@ssmelliott @boarderstu @jharriison @reckIex @chaddiedabaddie Yes, if you intentionally cause a major car wreck and cause panic that’s obviously terrorism. Obviously.		No, unintentional accidents aren’t terrorism even if they cause political changes. Obviously.		Any other childish and facile questions about the definition of terrorism?
@ssmelliott @boarderstu @jharriison @reckIex @chaddiedabaddie Wait, so it’s only terrorism if the victims don’t get attention? Seriously, can you use logic for even half a minute?

@ssmelliott @boarderstu @jharriison @reckIex @chaddiedabaddie Maybe something, maybe nothing. That’s 100% irrelevant to the fact he instilled mass panic in the area, which is a political action.
@boarderstu @jharriison @ssmelliott @reckIex @chaddiedabaddie Causing mass panic is a political act. He’s either a terrorist or he’s so stupid he committed an act of terrorism without realizing it. Somehow I’m gonna guess it’s the former.
@ssmelliott @reckIex @stardustspecter “Neither of my friends”		I think we’ve found the problem. Maybe try having more than 2 friends and you won’t be so drawn to trolling on twitter?
@ssmelliott @reckIex Of course mass shooters have political aims. Sure there’s exceptions, but the vast majority of school shooters don’t kill specific people for specific reasons. They’re there to inflict mass panic, kill people they’ve never met, and gain infamy. Those are political goals.

@JonnaChissus Paying benefits earlier will of course reduce returns to the overall fund, but do you think it will significantly weaken the fund? If so, do you think there’s a solution besides scrapping the plan altogether? Or more importantly, a solution that has a chance of passing?

@GordyDBOWitz @matthewjdowd Many liberals were saying this exact thing when Obama was in office. Presidential power has been steadily increasing for decades, not just under trump.

@stephharperrn @PeggySue110816 @Rex42808122 @FoxNews The US government owns the patents to CBD and THC. Monsanto cannot legally modify the organisms that produce these chemicals without federal approval. Plus banking regulations.

@MlicariEsq Not at all. Would you want your employer divulging your private information to government agencies without your permission or a warrant? If there’s evidence a specific person is an illegal immigrant they can get a warrant. Otherwise it’s an unreasonable search &amp; seizure.

Trump is obviously not in excellent health, but I don’t see any reason to doubt his doctor said that.

@SpeakerRyan @Cernovich Yeah that sounds like crumbs to me.
@letetiadj @mattmfm @realDonaldTrump “Verb” isn’t a verb. Synonyms of “verb” aren’t verbs either. 		“Superlative” isn’t a superlative. Synonyms of “superlative” aren’t superlatives either. 		You have to distinguish between the word as its own word and the word as a part of speech to describe other words.
@letetiadj @mattmfm @realDonaldTrump If you were using it as an adjective, those would be synonyms. 		Superlative the noun doesn’t have any synonyms.
@letetiadj @mattmfm @realDonaldTrump Thanks. Those are distinct definitions though. One is a noun and the other is an adjective. 		If you use it as a noun, only the noun’s definition applies. “Most exceptional” is a superlative, and exceptional skills are superlative skills, but “exceptional” isn’t a superlative

@nikflorida @anindiantravels @KeithOlbermann You still haven’t explained how a misspelling indicates any attempt to manufacture the quote or impersonate the author 🤔🤔🤔
@jdorrancfarnham @mattmfm Reading through the comments, it seems nearly everyone is interpreting this as forgery or impersonation, which is totally absurd. That part isn’t a scandal.		His mental health is definitely a scandal, but that’s not what’s mentioned here.
@nebro @edlane3 @mattmfm If they didn’t intend to release the results, why would they have spent the last 2 months announcing his examination?
@ZE_DadOf3 @MonsterMages @JamesMartinSJ @JuddApatow Monster: “No one wrote about Jesus during his time”		Zach: “That’s patently untrue! This one guy wrote about him 3 generations later!”		Everyone except Zach: “😂😂😂”
@MonsterMages @ZE_DadOf3 @JamesMartinSJ @JuddApatow The strongest evidence for Jesus’ existence (as one or multiple humans) is the numerous inconsistencies in the story of his life. If he were invented from whole cloth, the authors would have likely eliminated these inconsistencies.
@owillis @ThisTwitIsLit Are there legit journalists saying this or do you mean “journalists” like @seanhannity ?
@kellypai3 @Veronic20599483 @KeithOlbermann Why? It’s pretty similar to the statements he made about Obama’s health.		Did you expect him to say his boss is obese and unfit for office?
@derek__wheeler @ABC You don’t think people deserve to know if their president considers himself a racist?
@KeyDecision1 @mattmfm Why would he be signing his quote? That’s not how quotes work. He said the thing INSIDE the quotation marks.		If it were a statement written by him, there wouldn’t be quotation marks. Get it now?
@BufordTofTexas @Jlover7700 @KeithOlbermann @WhiteHouse Incompetence and laziness seems much more likely than attempted impersonation or forgery, which many seem to be suggesting.
@juliecarp57 @KeithOlbermann It’s a quote, not a signed statement. Duuuuuuuuuhhhhh.
@happydem18 @KeithOlbermann @SarahHuckabee Yeah no shit. The person doing the quoting is rarely the person being quoted. That’s literally the whole point of using a quote.
@HulkingGawker @KeithOlbermann It’s a quote, not a signature. Duuuuuhhhh.
@MegAnneGarst @KeithOlbermann No shit the doctor didn’t write the statement in which the doctor is quoted. That’s why they quote him in it. Quoting someone isn’t impersonating them.
@Wattm1Watt @KeithOlbermann Since when do people sign their own quotes? That would defeat the whole point of using a quote. Duuuuuuhhhh.
@Sue_n_Salem @KeithOlbermann The quote was from the doctor. The doctor didn’t sign his quote. That would defeat the whole point of quoting him. Duuuuuuhhhhhhhhh.
@TheDogLady1228 @KeithOlbermann Why would it be? They misspelled his name when quoting him. How on earth is that anything close to forgery?
@LeeAnndelCasti2 @KeithOlbermann Since when is misspelling someone’s name when quoting them evidence you’re trying to impersonate them?
@kellypai3 @Veronic20599483 @KeithOlbermann Since when is misspelling a quote evidence you’re trying to impersonate the author of the quote?
@Veronic20599483 @KeithOlbermann It’s a quote. No one’s signing the doctor’s name on anything. Hence the quotation marks. Duuuuuhhh.
@octaves5 @KeithOlbermann Since when are quotes signed by the person being quoted? That would defeat the whole point of quoting someone.
@Chelu61Frye @KeithOlbermann Since when is a misspelling something evidence that the quote is fabricated?

@ArethaGrier2 @mattmfm So if you misspell the author’s name when typing out a quote, that’s evidence of forgery?
@PresidentBigot @mattmfm The person typing out the quote misspelled the author’s name. How exactly is that evidence the quote is made up?
@edlane3 @mattmfm The whole point of this physical is to announce the results. Every president does this.
@SMacMillanMD @mattmfm This is a quote that’s attributed to its author. It’s not a signed statement form the author. That’s why there’s quotation marks.
@KeyDecision1 @mattmfm It’s not signed. It’s a quote that’s attributed. Duh.
@mattmfm The quotation marks obviously indicate the doctor didn’t write his own name there. That’s not a conspiracy. 		Can we focus on the real trump scandals for maybe like 5 seconds?

@commchf @toastcity84 @CNBC @BretBaier I’m always shocked that this is a new concept to people. I’m starting to think it’s not new information, it’s just a super inconvenient fact that undermines their whole “but prices will go up” argument.
@SCadick @toastcity84 @CNBC @BretBaier No one’s proposing a law that would ban price increases. #strawman
@Black_Ted_Mosby @toastcity84 @CNBC @BretBaier Yep, and wage increases by definition will always increase prices by less than the wage was increased. So even when prices go up, the products are more affordable than before.
@corinehardman @politiburr @linluv5 @toastcity84 That might be dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Stores don’t exist to give jobs to students and retirees. They exist to sell products and make money. Duuuuuhhh.
@nieman_james @jaygirl1980 @CNBC Oh wow, another great idea. Who doesn’t love to spend hours traveling back and forth from the library to save basically nothing after factoring in gas/bus costs? You’re such a genius dude.
@toastcity84 @CNBC @BretBaier Price increases would be a fraction of the wage increase tho. Purchasing power would NOT remain the same. 		If a fraction of your labor costs go up, and labor is already a fraction of your total costs, it should be pretty obvious that prices will increase less than wages.
@UptownGirl_xo @Llorac11 @jakehicks1206 @CNBC How does a part-time employee get overtime?
@Diesel_4life @jaygirl1980 @CNBC Minimum wage was ALWAYS intended as a living wage. It’s just that over the past 30 years, people like you have started buying into this propaganda and big corporations have taken full advantage of your ignorance. #history

@drumpfucked @Mediaite But if they don’t get tipped, they don’t get paid less than minimum wage. 😱😱

@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If your employees are redundant and inefficient, tax rates have nothing to do with that. In fact, redundant employees would reduce your profit and decrease your tax burden, lessening the effects of any tax increases.

@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If you think taxes are applied as a dollar figure regardless of profit, that’s probably why you’re so clueless about the impact of taxes.
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If an employee used to add $10k of value to your company, but now only adds $5k, you’re still losing $5k of value if you fire that employee. This is super basic dude.
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If John were saying that tax cuts lead to firings, I would say he’s just as poorly-informed and math-averse as you. But I’m pretty confident that’s not his argument.
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If the profit loss is due to higher corporate taxes,every employee is still adding value to the company. Duh.
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola Duuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrr “this guy isn’t on twitter 24/7 therefore I’m smarter than him”
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If you’re competent at running your company, every employee contributes to your profit. If that profit decreases by 5% or 10% or even 50%, it’s still stupid to cut any employees. #BasicEconomics #GoBackToCollege
@myusernamekthx @johniadarola If you think tax rates affect hiring and firing decisions, I think you’re the one who needs to go back to college.

@waju80 @amyeve @EatYerOats @peterdaou I’m not sure why you’re so impressed by my ability to count. Most people can do it. You should take a class or something.
@jaketapper I’m about 90% sure Stephen miller was under the influence of something during this interview. He was rocking back and forth before the questions started. He was argumentative but unable to make a coherent point, instead rambling around his ideas without ever really hitting them.
@waju80 @amyeve @EatYerOats @peterdaou Do you really not know how to count? Seriously, it can’t be that hard to understand that 37 is more than 12.

@realDonaldTrump Hmmmm... #SloppyDonny does have a nice ring to it. Do you mind if I call you that, Mr. President?
We could solve this whole voter ID kerfuffle by simply treating photo IDs as a constitutional right of every citizen. If everyone gets a free ID when they turn 18 &amp; a free renewal every 5-10 years, it’s perfectly reasonable to require it to cast a vote. Otherwise it’s a poll tax.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou I’d say that’s a uniquely complex case because he’s the leader of a group we’re at war with, but he’s in a country we’re not at war with. I honestly have no idea what international law says here.		But you could always get a secret decalaration of war from congress beforehand
@nancyoneil1020 @EdKrassen @CNN If a normal president said this about someone, I could imagine it having a serious impact on their reputation &amp; income, so maybe.		But I have a hard time imagining that trump insulting you damages your reputation. If anything it probably makes your reputation better 🤔
@PIE20121 @EdKrassen @CNN I wouldn’t be surprised 😣
@EdKrassen @CNN I’m pretty sure you can’t sue a sitting president. #TwitterLawyers confirm?
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou Sure, they’re better than traditional air strikes in most cases. But they should be subject to the same rules of engagement as any other bombings (signature strikes are a huge problem), and should only be allowed after a declaration of war or if authorized by the host country.
@ImJonAbramson @EatYerOats @amyeve @peterdaou Agreed. But the starting point for negotiations shouldn’t be a pre-compromised moderate position. The starting point for negotiations should be everything you want and maybe even a little more, so there’s room to compromise without giving up your core liberal principles.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou I agree that’s not the worst thing a politician can say, but it just fed into her existing public perception as a totally choreographed robot. This and many other things made her a historically weak candidate.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou The problem is that 1. Bernie didn’t make the same mistake, and 2. She repeated her mistake with Libya, and then laughed about it. She also supported drone strikes in numerous other countries. I don’t see any evidence she learned anything from Iraq.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou Sure, banks aren’t inherently bad. But there is something inherently corrupt about politicians getting paid millions by any large corporation after leaving office. This alone should have disqualified her from seeking future elected office.
@ImJonAbramson @EatYerOats @amyeve @peterdaou All of that was true throughout our history, and there’s been numerous times when we’ve enacted historically liberal policy.		There’s no reason we can’t do the same today.
@2Kindlydevious @SvePan1108 @peterdaou Orthodoxy is a religious ideology though. Anyone can convert, and there’s several large populations of Orthodox Jews in different parts of the world. I’m really trying to see how it could be an ethnicity but I just don’t see any logic to that.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou She’s obviously 1000x more informed and more capable than trump, and I could even go as far as to say she’s fine or acceptable, but even “acceptable” is really pushing it.
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou She voted in favor of the Iraq war and was one of the leaders of the Libyan war. She then laughed about it. She believed in having a “public and private position.” She was paid millions to speak to big banks. Etc. How can you be optimistic and liberal and still think she’s great?
@SvePan1108 @2Kindlydevious @peterdaou Nobody uses Jewish as an ethnicity. Anyone who does is either misunderstanding Judaism or ethnicity.		Ashkenazi Jews are a distinct ethnicity, but unless you’re talking about them specifically, Jews are a religious group. Most are European, Middle Eastern, or North/East African.
@ImJonAbramson @EatYerOats @amyeve @peterdaou Why does it take magic to enact historically liberal policies? 		European popular perception of 18th-century American government was famously described by historian Richard Hoffstadter as a “radical liberal experiment.” 		#TheRevolution #CivilRights #19thAmendment #NewDeal
@ImJonAbramson @peterdaou If you’re a natural pessimist, Hillary probably seems like a great option compared to the status quo. But if you’re a natural optimist, she’s a really crappy option compared to what’s desirable &amp; achievable.
@2Kindlydevious @SvePan1108 @peterdaou #PuertoRicanJewsUnite!
@SvePan1108 @2Kindlydevious @peterdaou “Person of color” is a common term generally meaning “ethnic/racial minority” in the US. Judaism is a religion. The two have nothing to do with each other. Just as there are white, black, Hispanic, and Asian Christians, there are also Jews of all those races.
@peterdaou A 20-tweet rant and not a single sentence about policy. Why is it so damn hard to understand that Bernie supporters care almost solely about policy, which is also why they despised Hillary. It’s reaaaaally simple. No need for all this partisan trickhackery. Just focus on policy.

@Gitano_48 @NolaLegalmvp @justicedems I wasn’t responding to you, I was saying NOLA enormously oversimplified the issue when they said that if Pizza Hut raises prices, someone else won’t raise prices, thereby stealing Pizza Hut’s customers and forcing them to reverse their price increase.
@SallyAlbright If there’s nothing wrong with marrying for money, then why is it an bad to call someone a hooker? 		You can’t defend the action as honorable while interpreting the job title as an insult.
@DavidSorenson20 @docrocktex26 If someone thought he’d start a war with Iran and repeal Obamacare, it’s obviously been much less bad than they expected. 		Duh.
@mikegulyas @justicedems No, you wouldn’t just fire people you need and lose money. You’d raise prices. But because small companies already have higher relative costs and higher prices, a $15 minimum wage helps level the playing field, making it harder for large companies to charge such low prices.
@DavidSorenson20 @docrocktex26 “Not as bad as theoretically possible” is nowhere near the same as “good.”
@Solafide12 @docrocktex26 Or they just had worse expectations than you did? Duuuuuuuuh.
@docrocktex26 So no one’s allowed to have expected trump to do worse things than he did? No one’s allowed to have expected he’d pass Obamacare reform, or crack down on legal cannabis, or anything else he didn’t do?
@rachaelbwriter @Minarchy_Ball @justicedems Lots of companies do post notices when they raise prices due to ingredient costs. Are you 100% sure Pizza Hut has never done this?
@EnkidoLives @justicedems This is 100% propaganda. Minimum wage was ALWAYS designed to be a living wage. Look into the history of minimum wages in the US.
@mikegulyas @justicedems Big corporations’ have an advantage when minimum wage is low. They can pay poverty wages to 10s or 100s of thousands of employees, let government services pick up the slack, and use their savings to offer lower prices.		$15 minimum wage won’t solve this problem, but it will help!
@NolaLegalmvp @Gitano_48 @justicedems That’s an enormous oversimplification. You’re either being incredibly disingenuous, or if you honestly think the only criteria for purchasing decisions is price, please stop commenting on any political or economic issues.

@DmDougmyers  https://t.co/ZuUnZCl1zQ
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 Yeah I used to think that was a no-brainer, until I learned that over 30 states have no laws requiring ID to buy a gun. We’ve been at this all day now and you still can’t come up with the law.
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 Says nothing about a photo ID. And even if you need an ID to get the open carry permit, you don’t need the permit to buy or own a gun in Minnesota, so you’re still no closer to proving me wrong.
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 I keep begging for some evidence to correct my apparent ignorance, but no one is able to show me a single law saying you need ID to buy a gun in most states. The only logical conclusion I can draw is that such a law doesn’t exist...
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 You don’t need a permit to own a gun in Minnesota, and you haven’t been able to find any law supporting that claim, nor have you been able to find a law saying you need a photo ID to get the permit.
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 You keep calling me a dumbass but you can’t produce a single shred of evidence saying you need an ID to buy a gun in Minnesota 🤔🤔
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 First of all, you don’t need a carry permit to own a gun in Minnesota. You only need a permit to carry the gun in public. Moreover, where does your “proof” say you need ID to get a permit?
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 Where’s the part where it says you need ID?
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 You bought a law? Ok buddy
@DmDougmyers @tmtulcs @notpresjohnson @lybr3 So I’ll take it you can’t find a law to back up your claim?

@texasGSDgirl @aldresser @lybr3 The easy solution is just give everyone a free ID when they turn 18, in which case I’d be totally fine with needing it to vote. The problem is when you try to require spending money to exercise constitutional rights. That’s authoritarian and unAmerican.

@DmDougmyers Reducing the government’s income has the same effect as increasing its  spending. Duuuuhhhh.
@DmDougmyers @notpresjohnson @lybr3 So you think it’s ok to charge money to vote?
@krassenstein 3 years ago both parties were actively supporting a half dozen wars with our troops and equipment. The county hasn’t changed, you’ve just become more aware.
@aldresser @lybr3 A photo ID costs money. Black people are in general poorer than white people. So requiring photo ID disproportionately impacts black people and other minorities. Now you can stop wondering.
@PragmaticEbooks @DmDougmyers @notpresjohnson @lybr3 It’s requiring photo ID that causes problems, because you almost always have to pay money to get one of those. This is in effect a poll tax, which has been unconstitutional for a long-ass time
@DmDougmyers @notpresjohnson @lybr3 None of those are constitutionally protected rights. If you want ID to vote fine, but you have to provide free ID to every citizen in that case. Most states don’t.
@lybr3 Do you think their methods include literally hiding voting booths or are you being intentionally clueless?
@DeeEman2013 @DysClaimer @TheRyanGrooms @pdxlawgrrrl Charging them with a crime is appropriate. Charging them with murder or manslaughter is absurd and discounts the officer’s responsibility for his own actions.

@pdxlawgrrrl It is absolutely outrageous that the police act this way. Reminds me of #TamirRice in 2 ways: first, cops relied entirely on an anonymous caller without collecting facts. Second, cops came in guns blazing and gave 0% opportunity for compliance or explanation before executing them

@KL08247 @TheGoldenBoyNC @peterdaou @realDonaldTrump @senorrinhatch No one’s telling him to go away because he did go away. Duh.
@TheGoldenBoyNC @v_surreal @peterdaou Romney is almost always referred to as a failed candidate. Your point is moot.
@TheGoldenBoyNC @peterdaou But we do hear “failed 2012 candidate Mitt Romney” and “2008 presidential hopeful John Edwards.” What’s the difference between Romney/Edwards and McCain/Sanders? Maybe it’s that McCain and Sanders have current titles we can use? 😱😱😱😱
@wewillresist2 @peterdaou Really? 12 years of public office makes her the most qualified candidate EVER? Yeah she was qualified, but literally hundreds of candidates have had more experience than her before running.
@peterdaou Your logic is enormously flawed. The first woman to do any given activity is not inherently good at that activity. Was the first male midwife automatically one of the best midwives ever to exist? Maybe, maybe not.
@bartlet4amer @EricHolder @tburages I never said I though they would. In fact I never even said I thought they should try. I said the founders had made it so they could. Please stop trying to manufacture arguments.
@vdblegal @peterdaou Go to the rust belt and tell the people there she cares about them. Kinda like DJT did.
@CAlmeidaAuthor @peterdaou How was she already at the very top? She lost both times she ran. Where I’m from repeated losers aren’t considered the best of the best.
@tiredofgop @peterdaou @HillaryClinton What did you want her to do? She lost. There’s no recourse for a confirmed loser.
@TwiHusband @peterdaou Or maybe just to a winning level? Duh?
@bartlet4amer @EricHolder @tburages 30 of 99 last time I checked although that tied race could make it 31 of 99. But you keep moving between saying it’s impossible and it’s improbable. I never said it was likely, just that the founders explicitly addressed your concerns and made it possible.
@bartlet4amer @EricHolder @tburages You said “you need congress to amend the constitution” even after I’d already mentioned that the states could do it. It’s pretty reasonable to therefore assume you didn’t know the states can amend the constitution without congress.
@BillyESmith @peterdaou If you think George Clooney is gay, you’ve probably not met a lot of gay guys.
@umbrellaman92 @peterdaou Then why did she lose the white women vote? Hint: it was her fault, not the voters’.
@wewillresist2 @peterdaou @HillaryClinton I thought the greatest part of her campaign was when she didn’t go to the #RustBelt at all because she was arrogant and didn’t listen to her husband, Barack, or Bernie when they all told her she should go. Such a great decision, definitely has nothing to do with her loss.
@peterdaou @mtmaire When someone says the loser isn’t very good at the thing they lost at, you interpret that as sexism? Ooooook buddy
@bartlet4amer @EricHolder @tburages As of yesterday you didn’t even know states could do it, so I’d say difficult is a big improvement over impossible. And governors don’t call for a convention, state legislatures do.

@upine @anklebiter65 @TravelerJade @positively14th @SandraRoggero @peterdaou Yes, that is a big part of it. He pre-negotiated everything so the starting point for the real negotiations was already a compromise. Then he’d fail or the final version would be a 70-80% republican policy. Examples: Obamacare, closing #Gitmo, nominating Merrick Garland, etc.
@anklebiter65 @TravelerJade @upine @positively14th @SandraRoggero @peterdaou If you don’t think Obama was a weak president there’s not much hope for any rational conversation about his presidency.
@lynnae_mosley @SandraRoggero @peterdaou If you’d look at my tweets from the past couple weeks you’d see that the vast majority of them are criticizing trump &amp; his party. That doesn’t by any stretch of the imagination preclude me from also calling out obama &amp; Hillary on their bullshit too.
@curt_quin @SandraRoggero @peterdaou Did you honestly not realize I’m criticizing obama and Clinton for being too similar to republicans? Or are you just bored and spamming random threads with these pics?
@realDonaldTrump @jamiejmcintyre @dcexaminer Are you telling us this happened or not? It makes exactly 0 sense for the president to be citing news articles about what the president is doing.
@Biomaven @sxtmp @TrueFactsStated You need scarcity AND demand for something to be valuable. Scarcity alone doesn’t make something valuable.
@Biomaven @TrueFactsStated Gold is valuable because it’s both desirable AND scarce. Plenty of things are one or the other and aren’t inherently valuable. Like bitcoin.
@Lyra3141 @TrueFactsStated So because the dollar isn’t backed by anything, bitcoin, which is also not backed by anything, is somehow better?
@brandonlancast2 @TrueFactsStated If the US government develops a cryptocurrency its value would obviously be tied to the value of a dollar. That’s kinda inherent in how currencies work. There would be no financial benefit to owning one over the other.

@calfanatic @SandraRoggero @peterdaou Bernie was for gay marriage 30 years ago 😱😱😱
@chrissyteigen @Cernovich I’d imagine there’s a legal/liability reason for not wanting to bring an unannounced passenger into a foreign country. Still a bad way to handle it but I strongly suspect there was a policy in place from the legal team and they just followed it.
@upine @theminorchords @positively14th @SandraRoggero @peterdaou Did you really just blame voters for not protesting Clinton enough to push her toward good policies? Why would we want a leader who only espouses good policies because they need our vote? I’d prefer a leader who espouses good policies because they understand they’re good policies
@upine @positively14th @SandraRoggero @peterdaou I’ve never heard a Bernie supporter say he’s perfect. I doubt you have either.
@positively14th @SandraRoggero @peterdaou All of that is waaaaayyy pre-Clinton. Democrats have been useless for 20+ years, and that’s being kind.
@SandraRoggero @peterdaou Yes, but it’s important we ensure we don’t get stuck with the same kind of dem leadership as the past 20 years. That’s part of an effective resistance.
@Spitfirehill @ham1961 @peterdaou Of course. In almost every regard she’s 1000 times more competent and qualified than Trump. But so am I, and I really hope no ones dumb enough to think I should be president.
@MlicariEsq @brainconductor @Kearsey_Morton @BobbyBigWheel @peterdaou She certainly has some accomplishments separate from Bill, but as far as I know they’re all either non-political accomplishments (when she was a lawyer) or they’re from her job as a senator, which she clearly only won because she was a former FLOTUS.
@SandraRoggero @peterdaou Yeah and many of my criticisms of Hillary I also make of Obama. They’re both weak. They both pre-negotiate with the opposition ensuring any deals will be massively biased against them. But in most criticisms, Hillary is like Obama plus 50%. She’s the same but worse.
@brainconductor @MlicariEsq @Kearsey_Morton @BobbyBigWheel @peterdaou Everything is always about her, never about policy. Her entire political career is because of her husband and yet she’s propped up as some sort of feminist hero. Every single thing she says must be focus-tested and polled before she says it. Etc. etc. etc.
@brainconductor @MlicariEsq @Kearsey_Morton @BobbyBigWheel @peterdaou Well there’s the fact we now have irrefutable proof she rigged the primary and supported DJ cuz she thought he’d be easy to beat. She always says she takes full responsibility for her loss, then immediately spends the next 5 minutes giving endless excuses why it’s not her fault.
@Mobute @SophieInCT @BobbyBigWheel Not sure what that is but why the hell not?
@ham1961 @peterdaou No she doesn’t. She was a senator for like 8 years and SecState for 4. If that’s your bar for qualified, then almost every other Secretary of State is more qualified than she is/was.
@_celia_marie_ @BossDoxie @MikeDrucker Yes, I would also be a miserable presidential candidate. That’s why I didn’t run. Too bad Hillary doesn’t have the same level of self-awareness.
@SandraRoggero @peterdaou Really? Refusing to endorse gay marriage for 30 years is advocating for the less fortunate?
@peterdaou Loyalty in politics is not something to be proud of. I want leaders who are loyal to this country, not their party and each other.
@brainconductor @MlicariEsq @Kearsey_Morton @BobbyBigWheel @peterdaou She’s allowed to do whatever she wants. And I’m allowed to criticize her for it.
@summerbrennan They also told her to take up improv comedy. Is that sexist too or are you intentionally picking the one activity they mentioned that’s traditionally a feminine activity for the sole purpose of claiming sexism?
@snicklefritz35 @BobbyBigWheel @dgmcdowell His favorable rating among people who know who he is has ALWAYS been way higher than Hillary’s.
@dgmcdowell @BobbyBigWheel Bernie is the most popular politician in America. Hillary CONTINUES to do worse than trump even after we’ve seen what he’s doing.
@GuidedByVodka @BobbyBigWheel She was also told to take up improv comedy. Where’s the controversy?
@Mobute @SophieInCT @BobbyBigWheel Wow you’re so smart. How did you ever come up with that?
@brainconductor @MlicariEsq @Kearsey_Morton @BobbyBigWheel She wrote a book and went on a national press &amp; signing tour. She teamed up with @peterdaou to start an online media company focused on politics. She’s doing literally everything she can to stay in the spotlight.
@procrastin @BobbyBigWheel Have you ever looked at a poll?
@danieljfusco @BobbyBigWheel And that’s why Donald Trump Won. The message is the only thing that matters.
@hotincleveland @cdizzlefosniz @BobbyBigWheel Maybe that’s because he’s the most popular politician in America 😱😱
@cdizzlefosniz @BobbyBigWheel That was one of many random activities. If that was the ONLY activity they’d mentioned, it would be reasonable to say that’s sexist. But it wasn’t. Is it also sexist to tell her to take up improv comedy?
@SophieInCT @MikeDrucker @nickiknowsnada Yeah, I’m totally jealous of Hillary. I should have been president, not her! 		Or maybe she’s incompetent, useless, and incapable of bringing forth a single policy-based argument and instead blames everything on sexism, just like you.
@SophieInCT You’re right. It’s not a crime to be hopelessly obsessed with strangers’ penises. It’s just really fucking weird and gross.
If you think Hillary would be a good president, you’re almost as delusional as those who support President Trump.
@SophieInCT is a sexual harasser who’s obsessed with penises and penis size to such an extent she can’t even focus on policy for 30 seconds without bringing up penises. https://t.co/uYrNXSfquW
@SophieInCT @MikeDrucker @nickiknowsnada It’s really hilarious how you claim to be a lesbian yet you’re oddly fixated on everyone’s penis and how big it is. Definitely points to some hidden desires. 		Maybe you should stop trying to sexually harass people and read up on policy so we can have an adult conversation.
@deejay90192 @321Amanda75 @HillaryClinton Yeah the most liberal senator in this century doesn’t care about women’s rights. Can we get over our stupid tribal allegiances and actually look at policy for once?

@BossDoxie @MikeDrucker How is it misogynist to tell Hillary to get out of politics? She’s incompetent and nationally despised. She lost to the most unpopular candidate ever. She has nothing to contribute.
@MikeDrucker @nickiknowsnada Maybe it has to do with the fact that Al Gore didn’t spend all of 2001 doing interviews, book signings, and commenting on politics 😱😱😱

@SenThomTillis @NancyPelosi You could have given 1000x more people (that’s the entire US population) 5x as much money (that’s $5k per adult &amp; $5k per child/infant) and added the same amount to the debt. 		Instead you’re adding $5,000,000 in debt for every one of those $1000 bonuses.
@officialmcafee Wtf. This looks like a 9th grader’s first draft of a school project.
@timkaine SHUT THIS BITCH DOWN. Filibuster &amp; refuse to yield the floor till the new year
@SenFeinstein Don’t just vote against it, filibuster. Work with other senators and refuse to yield the floor for days.
@SV_Hancock @shewz @YouGetBees @jeffery_b @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro Hey donkey, the CDC is a government program that helps the poor using tax dollars. The very fact you cite it as an authority is an admission that government programs do help.
@TweetsIn_HD @NumbersMuncher @charlescwcooke How is the current economic situation relevant to the FUTURE effects of this tax bill?
@lavindir75 @MrCdubya @DRMartinLLC @theTrumpSpring @CNBC You still haven’t explained how the cause can occur after the effect. That’s the only thing I ever challenged you on. 		Telling me Dodd-frank hurts small banks but not big ones is entirely irrelevant to your claim that Dodd-frank contributed to the economy crashing &amp; burning.
@SV_Hancock @shewz @YouGetBees @jeffery_b @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro Are you serious? People used to just die of starvation and freeze to death on the streets and get fired for getting injured on the job and then get evicted for losing their job. Government programs have worked so far to eliminate the worst, it’s not unreasonable to continue that.
@SV_Hancock @YouGetBees @jeffery_b @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro The world is all rainbows and puppies. It’s entirely unrealistic to expect that 100% of people will be able to fully support themselves for 100% of their life, and it’s entirely immoral to say that it doesn’t matter if some people have to starve or freeze to deal occasionally
@TweetsIn_HD @NumbersMuncher @charlescwcooke I’d rather have a functioning modern economy and high-paying jobs and moderate or high taxes than a shit economy, high unemployment, and slightly lower taxes
@NumbersMuncher @Cernovich There’s plenty of room to criticize the obvious fact that it’s crumbs for the poor without mocking the poor that will benefit from a few extra crumbs.

@NancyPelosi When democrats retake the House you MUST pass the most progressive tax reform bill the US has ever seen. If the senate votes it down, keep voting on the same bill dozens of time a al republicans with Obamacare repeal.
Half the republican argument was premised on this obvious fallacy being a certainty. Within hours of passing the bill they’re already backtracking and saying “nobody knows”	#shameless #GOPTaxPlan https://t.co/igNV78kHiZ
To keep the #TaxScamBill in perspective, we could have given every man, woman, and child in America a check for almost $5,000 and it would have added the same $1.5 trillion to the national debt. 		This doesn’t even take into account all the other horrendous parts of the bill.
@NewAgeDemocrat @Little_Red_Boat @BlakeStBums @CNBC We could have given every man, woman, and child in America almost $5000 and NOT increased taxes by over $4 trillion on the middle class and poor over the next decade, with the same effect on the national debt and even greater macroeconomic benefit.
@lavindir75 @MrCdubya @DRMartinLLC @theTrumpSpring @CNBC How did it have “everything to do with it” regardless of whether it occurred before or after? Since when can effects come before causes? 		Also FYI a wether is a castrated male goat.

@Ptango1036 @jgerling @MissyCanadian @wolfgirl2gizmo1 @KentBenjamin1 @PressSec @POTUS What? Obama was president for 8 years. No ones insulting Trump by saying that Obama was president longer than him. Please stop smoking meth.
@Ptango1036 @jgerling @MissyCanadian @wolfgirl2gizmo1 @KentBenjamin1 @PressSec @POTUS I do find it amusing that you haven’t even noticed how the graph is actually designed to be misleading. If you talked about the decreasing height on the Y-axis, you’d have a good point. But saying the arrow is 1.2mm off and therefore the graph is wrong is just absurd.
@Ptango1036 @jgerling @MissyCanadian @wolfgirl2gizmo1 @KentBenjamin1 @PressSec @POTUS What are you even talking about? That graph covers 10 years. Of course 2 months is minor. It’s less than 2% of the total change
@bob_wilkie @MossMo73587541 You’re totally right. American media always covers terror attacks in Pakistan when Muslims are killed.
“Likes and retweets are not endorsements.” 		Yeah, that’s literally 100% what they are.
@Ptango1036 @jgerling @MissyCanadian @wolfgirl2gizmo1 @KentBenjamin1 @PressSec @POTUS I totally reject your premise that we should start judging presidents from their election, not from their inauguration. Even if I agreed with that though, it would be a minor change in the graph. The real misleading part is the changing vertical height of each 2000-point section.

@jgerling @MissyCanadian @wolfgirl2gizmo1 @KentBenjamin1 @PressSec @POTUS Why is there no consistency on the Y-axis? While your point is correct, this graph is intentionally misleading readers by decreasing the vertical distance between points on the Y-axis as the numbers increase.

@JordanHarrold @KJR1960 @SenatorFischer It’s a little better than nothing for the middle &amp; upper-middle class. It’s worse than nothing for the working poor, whose employers will never give them paid leave but who will still be paying for the tax incentives that go to employers who do offer it.

@MikeS227 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump So you’re saying he’s a loser at negotiating?
@ProTrumper1 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump awwwww but I thought trump was supposed to be Mr. Deal-Maker? Yet he can’t even get his own party to agree on anything 😂😂😂😂
@DTRUMP4PREZ @AnnCoulter @angeloftruth11 @realDonaldTrump Awwwww Mr. deal-maker can’t get his own party to agree on policy? Poor lil fella

@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Yeah but he’s also terribly incompetent. Remember how he thinks the stock market pays off our national debt?

Any republican who fails to unequivocally condemn known pedophile Roy Moore must lose their next election. Pedophelia is non negotiable.
@antistatistofIG @TulsiGabbard Money gets taxed when it changes hands. Like when a company pays an employee, you pay income tax even though they already paid corporate tax
@thundley4 @TulsiGabbard TaXaTiOn Is ThEfT
@thundley4 @TulsiGabbard By that logic every dollar is taxed literally hundreds of times as it passes from person to person.

@atlharp @TulsiGabbard Blue states pay for the broke ass red states and have for decades.
@antistatistofIG @TulsiGabbard When the money changes hands, it gets taxed. For example, when someone inherits money it gets taxed. That’s not double taxation.
@crowdedhereeh @TulsiGabbard You know you could have googled &amp; found an answer to your question quicker than it took to type your reply, right?
@thundley4 @TulsiGabbard No it hasn’t. When money changes hands, it gets taxed. That’s not double taxing any more than sales tax is double taxing.

@ConsiderThis1 @RoKhanna I understand what you’re saying. But there’s a fundamental difference between refusing to help promote your site and literally blocking it.
@AjitPaiFCC wants IPSs to control which sites you can view. Under the new rules all independent media will be slowly crushed. #CallCongress https://t.co/SMOZ7Q6ElY
@ConsiderThis1 @RoKhanna That’s not blocking the site tho. You can still get to any site you want. ISPs would have the power to take a site entirely offline.
@ConsiderThis1 @RoKhanna True but google is just another site. You can still access non-google-approved sites. If the ISP has that control, they can block altogether
@annamericana @KyleKulinski @dpakman The video accepts the premise that IQ varies between races, but demonstrates that it’s largely if not entirely environmental, not genetic.
@utumno_4 @RoKhanna So you’re willing to trade open and unfettered access to the internet for $0.03 per month?
@ConsiderThis1 @RoKhanna Except that your media package would now only allow access to sites approved by the ISP. And this is an arbitrary example,prices could go up
@DizzyMissRuby @RoKhanna @NomikiKonst Your internet costs will be subsidized by large corporations like CNN or FOX in exchange for them controlling which sites you can access.
@PeteysDead @RoKhanna @JAdomian If we lose #NetNeutrality, consumer costs will likely go down as they will be subsidized in exchange for MSM controlling our access to info
@EShy @RoKhanna ...could pay the ISPs to offer limited access internet for cheaper. But saving a few dollars isn’t worth our access to media.
@EShy @RoKhanna Many ISPs will likely do that. Consumer costs to access the internet could actually go down if #NetNeutrality dies because CNN or FOX...
@laughingliberal @RoKhanna If #NetNeutrality ends, ISPs can slow down sites, block them, make them pay extra, etc. We can’t allow this to happen.
