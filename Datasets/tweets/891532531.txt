A3. 1: One way to cope with the stress of caregiving is by connecting with people who share the same experience. Military caregivers can join #HiddenHeroes Caregiver Community group on FB to connect with fellow caregivers. #CaregiverSupportChat https://t.co/QBpW1vceH1
Q3: What are some techniques or resources that can help #caregivers cope with the everyday #stresses of caregiving? #CaregiverSupportChat
@pattikatter This is such a great point.
Taking time to care for yourself, and seeking support when you need it, are crucial to maintaining your health and providing the best care for your care recipient! #CaregiverSupportChat https://t.co/UubYz3ToEb
A2 3: To prevent "compassion fatigue," you can:	üèòÔ∏èConnect with your community 	‚öΩÔ∏è Exercise 	üé® Embrace a hobby like painting or hiking	 ‚úîÔ∏èSay YES when someone offers help	‚ù§Ô∏è Seek support services	#CaregiverSupportChat 	https://t.co/PpBhopIO0g
@turbomelimel @PsychArmor Yes! We love @PsychArmor, especially their Military Caregiver Recognition Award Program.
A2 2: While you‚Äôre providing care for a loved one, it's easy to forget about yourself. Identify activities that enhance your mood and help you recharge. Make it a priority to take time for yourself, even if it‚Äôs just a few minutes. #CaregiverSupportChat https://t.co/3axQDn8IYC

A2. 1: Caregiver burnout is real, but there are steps you can take to prevent it from happening. #CaregiverSupportChat
The most important factor in keeping a care recipient healthy is keeping their caregiver healthy! https://t.co/yEi6jjZWJU
Q2: Caregiving can induce a number of different feelings, including #stress and #anxiety. When does stress become overwhelming, and at what point does it become unhealthy? #CaregiverSupportChat
A1. 5: Despite these findings, only 15% of the programs surveyed by the @RANDCorporation actually support military caregivers as a targeted population. This means #militarycaregivers are not getting the attention they need and deserve! #CaregiverSupportChat
A1. 4: #Caregivers may experience #depression as they balance all of their responsibilities. @RANDCorporation found that post-9/11 caregivers are 4x more likely &amp; pre-9/11 caregivers are 2x more likely, than non-caregivers to have major depressive disorder. #CaregiverSupportChat
A1. 3: Military and veteran caregivers are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems, strains in family relationships, and workplace problems than non-caregivers.#CaregiverSupportChat
RT @familydoctor: A1. #Caregiver burnout is real. It‚Äôs important to accept that there is a limit to what you can do at times. #Stress can s‚Ä¶
A1. 2: Often times, caregivers experience financial challenges. Since caregiving is an all-encompassing job, it can be difficult for military caregivers to have a job outside of the home, which can prevent them from finding other means of compensation. #CaregiverSupportChat
A1. 1: There are 5.5M #militarycaregivers caring for our nation‚Äôs wounded, ill, or injured servicemembers and veterans. To learn more about the unique challenges they face, we commissioned @RANDCorporation to conduct the first study on military caregivers. #CaregiverSupportChat https://t.co/IYiAPAY2JX
