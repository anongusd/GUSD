OK, this photo taken at CPAC of President grabbing flag after embracing falsehoods of Kim Jong Un (&amp; before that Putin &amp; S.A. Prince) &amp; after dissing Warmbier family, Justice Department &amp; former FBI Director Mueller just says it all #PictureWorthAllWords https://t.co/agh61qzLf3
We should be making it easier for everyone to vote, not harder. Glad to see New Hampshire Democrats defending the Granite State’s tradition of voter participation. 	https://t.co/Jxsad3EBQT
Thanks to Fred and Cindy Warmbier for standing up in memory of their son Otto. The lesson? The President, in turn,  should be standing up to dictators like Kim Jong Un and Putin and the S.A. Prince.  Not flattering them by denying the clear truth of his own intelligence forces. https://t.co/bVhdGEWX98
Good to see Minnesota-based @3M committing to a sustainable future!	https://t.co/Nn8L8Ix4oP
It’s telling to see whose word the President trusts: Putin and Kim Jong Un. Who does he doubt? His own intelligence officials	https://t.co/DKa2o2LmN2
Time to make history for #WomensHistoryMonth, and celebrate four women senators running for President. Thanks to my friends  @KamalaHarris @SenGillibrand and @ewarren 	Just think...it wasn’t that long ago that we didn’t even have four women in the Senate!

Today I met with some of the inspiring students from March for Our Lives to discuss how we can make it easier for people to vote. That includes passing my bills to automatically register every eligible person when they turn 18 &amp; give everyone the option of same day registration.
Asked Secretary Perdue today about problems with the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) reservation system. He said it would be fixed by March 4th.

On Senate floor with @SenWhitehouse where I just spoke about 1986 climate change letter signed by former Minnesota Republican Senator David Durenberger.  Back then climate was a bipartisan issue.  As the senators noted then, we must act soon.  Well that was 32 years ago. #Action
The Moscow Trump tower issue is real: Mr. Cohen acknowledged that he lied under oath to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, saying he was trying to protect Mr. Trump. “I am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore,” he said.  https://t.co/t3eP0zFap9
This is even a bigger deal:  Cohen has alleged that Trump knew in advance that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks planned to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails. https://t.co/cuKK0J4mEo

We are all thinking of those who lost loved ones in Aurora, Illinois today.  We remember that the victims went to work today just to do their jobs...as did the officers who put themselves right in the line of fire to save others.
States should not be able to purge “inactive voters” from the voting rolls, an act that disproportionately hurts minority or low-income voters. My SAVE VOTERS Act with @SherrodBrown protects voting rights by ensuring that states cannot purge eligible voters. Let’s pass it.

One of my best New Year’s Eves ever: surprise visit w/Ukrainian troops on the front line in the middle of a snowstorm with my friend John McCain. He was at his best with the troops.

Good morning! While you may have been sleeping..the shutdown was averted (at least in the senate), the criminal justice bill is done &amp; the farm bill will be signed into law today. No it wasn’t all a dream (but there were a lot of nightmares along the way). Home for Christmas! 🌲
Thanks to @DickDurbin @SenMikeLee @JohnCornyn @CoryBooker @ChuckGrassley @SenFeinstein for leadership on criminal justice reform bill. Thoroughly enjoyed watching Sen Grassley in his festive red holiday sweater fight off Sen Cotton’s amendments on the senate floor last night.

The Senate just passed criminal justice reform legislation. It’s an effective balance between keeping communities safe &amp; ensuring the fair administration of justice. It's also supported by major law enforcement groups &amp; the ACLU. The House should pass this bill now.

When you run for office and serve the public you also make a promise to accept the will of the people. Yesterday—on the same day a Federal Judge in Texas threw out the Affordable Care Act—Scott Walker broke that promise to the people of Wisconsin.
Facts: Texas judge just ruled to throw out Affordable Care Act &amp; protections for millions of people on a Friday night right before Christmas. Trump administration has already said it won’t help to defend it. Now it is on us &amp; the Democratic Attorney Generals. Let’s get to work.

This week the Senate passed important legislation overturning an IRS rule that upended decades of requirements that groups engaged in issue advocacy must identify their donors. Americans have the right to know who is paying to influence our elections. Now the House must pass.
The Senate voted 56-41 to pull America out of the devastating war in Yemen, and also passed a resolution condemning the Saudi Crown Prince for the Khashoggi murder. Finally the Senate stopped turning a blind eye to the 85,000 children who have died. The House must now act.
When you give your information to companies online, you shouldn’t have to worry about it being exploited. I joined colleagues to introduce the Data Care Act, which would require companies to protect your personal info -- access to this data is too important to leave to chance.
JUST IN: The bipartisan sexual harassment bill I'm leading with @RoyBlunt has passed the Senate &amp; House and will soon be signed into law! This will fundamentally change the way sexual harassment cases are handled in Congress and protect victims instead of protecting politicians.
NEWS: Reached bipartisan agreement between House &amp; Senate on the sexual harassment bill I am leading with @RoyBlunt as well as House leaders. Our bill changes the rules so that victims (instead of politicians) are protected.  We hope to pass it in the Senate in the next few days!

Protecting the Mueller investigation has bipartisan support, yet Republican leadership will not work with us to get this passed. We must preserve the integrity of this investigation. It’s not about politics - it’s about the future of our democracy. https://t.co/Nws9XqTodf
This month is National Adoption Month, so @RoyBlunt and I have introduced a bill that will help families get the counseling/support they need throughout the adoption process, helping ensure a smooth transition for children &amp; parents. Every kid deserves a loving &amp; lasting home.
Finally.  With 85,000 kids lost, I have long supported and voted for ending support for Saudis in Yemen: Rebuking Trump, senators back effort to suspend U.S. support for Saudi-led war in Yemen https://t.co/P4jgjTgjgB
Met with MN Rabbi Marcia Zimmerman &amp; other advocates about the growing number of hate crimes in the US. We cannot stand back and let hate gain a foothold in our country. We must lead by example, treat each other with respect, and stand up to these horrific acts.
We have been working toward funding the Orange line for a while.  One of five areas getting this for grant! Really good news !  Orange Orange Line bus rapid transit awarded $74 million from federal government. https://t.co/xOIj0j7HJE
Spoke on the Senate floor calling for a forceful response to killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi &amp; to hold Saudi govt accountable at the highest levels. The US is stronger/safer when our values -- a free press &amp; protecting human rights -- are at the heart of our foreign policy.
Minnesotans have a record of getting out &amp; voting, and in the 2018 election, we again had the highest voter turnout in the country! If we want to make it easier to vote, pass my bill for same day registration on a federal level. Numbers don’t lie.	https://t.co/eljncVh505
Great to speak with @CommonCause, @Unite4Democracy and advocates from across the country about important ways we can secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come.
Climate change is real and causing massive harm to our environment and economy. The Administration needs to take action, not stick their heads in the sand. Inaction is not an option.	https://t.co/WiDYwGIe87
Skyrocketing costs of Rx drugs have people rationing/not purchasing medication. This can have devastating consequences, like w/Alec Smith, a young MN restaurant manager who couldn’t afford his insulin &amp;lost his life. We must pass my bills to lower prices.	https://t.co/q4rQw1t4Cl

Both our neighbors the Packers and our  @Vikings played a great game....but the victory went to the hometown team.  Thanks Cousins.  Thanks team! #Skol
Thanks @katieaune and @CJDavisOSU who tell me the last time the Vikings and the Gophers beat both Wisconsin teams in one weekend was in 1994 (I believe everything I read on twitter so it must be right 😉)	10/20 — Vikings 13, Packers 10 (OT)	10/22 — Gophers 17, Badgers 14. https://t.co/i76rKHc0wk
.@Vikings are looking really good and I wish I was at the game.  When is the last time we beat the Badgers and the Packers in one weekend?

Walt was an early supporter when I ran for CountyAttorney. I remember how much it meant to get his quote on my 1st brochure. That’s because he had so much respect in NE Mpls &amp; beyond.  Thinking of his family today. Northeast Mpls giant Dziedzic dies at 85. https://t.co/FVG0rW40nr

We’ve secured over $46 million in additional funding for MinnesotaCare, MN’s basic healthcare program I’ve long advocated for. This is an important step forward for affordable, comprehensive coverage for many Minnesotans.

Our Constitution doesn’t say “we the party” -- it begins with the powerful words “we the people." When it comes to our elections that means counting every vote. Period. As Florida undergoes a major recount we must make sure the people's voice is heard.

Big doubts emerging on “acting A.G.” Whitaker. Legality of appointment, past business deals, questioning Marbury vs. Madison etc etc. Through it all we must uphold the independence of the Mueller investigation and thus the rule of law.

We need to pass my Secure Elections Act, which would help states update their outdated election systems, require audits, and guarantee that states using federal election $ have a paper trail for every ballot - something we don’t have right now in Georgia &amp; parts of Florida.
This isn’t a headline anyone should read. Surviving two of our nation’s deadly shootings? It doesn’t have to be. The vast majority of Americans (and hunters) agree: common sense gun legislation must become the law of the land. Ask your rep why it isn’t. 	https://t.co/zjRIKQKPov
We know a little something about recounts in MN. Every vote must be counted (and now recounted because it is so close) in Florida. Every vote. That’s how democracy works. And see this: In Arizona race, Dem takes lead over Republican as vote count continues https://t.co/6dapAXGMY9
“AG” Whitaker’s 2014 words when asked about worse SCOTUS cases: “There are so many..I would start with the idea of Marbury v. Madison..and the Supreme Court as the final arbiter..We’ll move forward from there—All New Deal cases that were expansive of the federal government...”😱
Acting AG’s statements on investigation mean he shouldn’t run it or be AG. Republicans who have claimed they don’t want to interfere w/investigation must lead &amp; work w/us to protect rule of law: Senate &amp; House must move now to protect Mueller investigation https://t.co/Z4a7hhRkG7

Now that the President has made Jeff Sessions resign, it is more important than ever that the Special Counsel investigation continue. This happened the day after the mid-terms for one reason—he didn’t want the American people to hold him accountable. No one is above the law.
Historic outcome in Minnesota last night: half our federal delegation is now women w/victories for @TinaSmithMN @BettyMcCollum04 @AngieCraigMN &amp; @IlhanMN . We’ve come a long way since U.S. Rep Coya Knutson lost to 6’4” Odin Langen whose slogan was “A big man for a man-sized job.”

As I said today, the Constitution doesn’t say, ‘We the ruling party.’ It says ‘We the people.’ If the people of this country want a check &amp; balance &amp; a fair process, we need to speak out. Today we did and I thank Sen. Flake for joining our call to reopen the FBI background check
Flake just said he wants a week delay of floor vote for a limited investigation.  We have been out negotiating for past hour with Chris Coons and others. Due diligence.  It is what I asked for in my remarks.
I was on @CBSThisMorning to talk about Dr. Ford’s powerful testimony and the need to reopen the FBI background check.  My colleagues can defiantly beat their chests all they want—I believe we need the facts. https://t.co/MeywBuXoTK
Now the American Bar Association (who had rated the Judge qualified and whose rating was touted today by his supporters) just called for a VOTE DELAY to complete the FBI background check investigation and interview witnesses  https://t.co/UQt1PFDJCO
Question: Why wouldn’t they ask the FBI to followup with key witnesses for one week?  Answer: Because they don’t want to hear what they might say.....The Senate can’t vote on Kavanaugh now https://t.co/yweDuzftxF
The chairman just thanked Dr. Ford for her bravery in coming forward....
If the White House would have allowed FBI background check to be reopened &amp; an investigation like in other cases, they wouldn’t have been surprised by answer to: Why did you take the polygraph test in a hotel room in Maryland? Her answer? Because I was at my grandma’s funeral.
I got the polygraph test Dr. Ford took showing truthfulness about her account in the record. To quote a judge: “law enforcement agencies use polygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses” &amp; the tests “serve law enforcement purposes.” That judge was Brett Kavanaugh in 2016 case.
It was good to hear Dr. Ford’s explanation of why she decided to send the letter in and why she waited before going public: because she was afraid of being “personally annihilated.”  She went public after reporters came to her house.
At hearing. Re Chairman’s claims re FBI background checks: My experience has been that for a number of nominees they have withdrawn nominations or we have asked them to based solely on FBI check. FBI finds things out. The White House should let them do that here&amp;finish their job

Asked Judge Kavanaugh about campaign finance law today as well as voting rights. These questions couldn't be more important -- too many states have restricted access to voting with new laws that weaken the right to vote and campaign contribution limits have been eroded by Court.
“A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps both.”  Those are Madison’s words I quoted in the hearing today.

Here now in Annapolis and this will be a tough afternoon for everyone.  As noted by President Bush yesterday, a man who never liked to rest is being laid to rest. McCain ends 81-year journey with burial at Naval Academy. https://t.co/7b84mvU9Zp
John and I stopped by the @MNFarmersUnion last week at the @mnstatefair to talk about their food this year - an amazing BLT and nitro brew! There’s never been a more important time to support Minnesota farmers. https://t.co/88Sri8OuMV
Good to work with the @MNFarmBureau this year. Thanks for having me at your @mnstatefair booth this past week! https://t.co/pbvoqBjkIh

The Capitol ceremony was beautiful yesterday. I will be attending the Cathedral service today as well as the burial tomorrow when John McCain’s journey will end where his service started—at the Naval Academy. Thanks Cindy and family for your strength.  https://t.co/3ANNzXwtwn
This is a good step by the FDA, but we need to do more to combat opioid abuse. So let’s pass my bill with @senrobportman to help curb synthetic drugs &amp; keep them out of our communities. https://t.co/WJ6kGXa6Rb

This is a big deal for our state and something our state government and federal Delegation have been pushing for for years in the courts, Congress and with the executive branch: Trump administration to pay New York, Minnesota for lost health-care funds https://t.co/nyoppteYpm
Congrats to Nancy Brasel our new federal judge!  This got done today and it makes the August Senate session more than worth it.  Eric Tostrud will be confirmed next week!
#OnThisDay in 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech on the steps on the Lincoln Memorial.  His powerful call to action still resonates today, as we continue the fight for justice and opportunity for all Americans.
Was on the floor for Senator Lindsey Graham's tribute to his best friend, John McCain. Such beautiful words.
I’m again calling on Republicans to #UnBlockTheDocs. Judge Kavanaugh’s critical documents from his time in the White House are still not public. This isn't normal. Americans deserve transparency for a nominee to our nation's highest court.
So many people are pulling for Denise, @WCCORosen. Keeping you and your family in our hearts. https://t.co/75HlJYMhpi

One thing about Senator McCain: He took his work and his duty seriously, but he didn’t always take himself seriously (which made him a lot of fun to work with). Here are some lighter memories I shared with @MSNBC’s @Kasie Hunt. https://t.co/NP0V0tEgAJ
Minnesota was recently ranked #2 in the nation for women’s equality, as well as #1 in both educational attainment gap and unemployment rate gap for women. Our state knows that empowering women builds a bright future for all. https://t.co/pwogZ1I0wB

What I love about the @mnstatefair &amp; this event is that they bring people from all across our state together. Thanks @MNFarmersUnion for hosting! https://t.co/2NAjQseSmk
Something else I learned from John McCain? Resiliency. Plane shot down, POW, loses presidential race..instead of giving up he returns to senate to do good work &amp; pass on a whole lot of lessons to the rest of us. His words? “Who am I to complain? I’m the luckiest man on earth.”
I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my friend and colleague, Senator John McCain. Full statement: https://t.co/vjlfkb7uCe

Days away from Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearing &amp; we still don’t have critical documents from his time in White House. Only 6% of docs have been given to Senate &amp; only 3% made public! What are they hiding? #UnBlockTheDocs &amp; postpone so we can read them. That’s how democracy works.

Cohen plea and Manafort guilty verdicts show that no one is above the law.  News today is more than enough proof that the Mueller investigation should be protected and Rosenstein &amp; DOJ &amp; law enforcement allowed to do their jobs.  Patriots pay their taxes.  Criminals evade them.
Minnesota was ranked #2 in the US for best community &amp; tech college systems! I know the value of community colleges -- both my sister &amp; dad attended one. We’ve built a strong system in MN and should support it along w/ apprenticeships and skills training. https://t.co/tMgzkfvn72

Talk is cheap but drug prices aren’t: Trump to Drop Call for Medicare to Negotiate Lower Drug Prices    https://t.co/zwyKqKpJQl
The price of a life-saving cancer drug has spiked 1,400% since 2013 - putting it out of reach for too many. I joined @SenBlumental &amp; @SenatorBaldwin to call on drug company CEO to lower price immediately. Families should be able to focus on getting well, not how to pay for meds.
My mom taught 2nd grade until she was 70. Every year, she’d teach a unit on monarch butterflies. It was her favorite &amp; the kids loved it. It’s #TeacherAppreciationWeek &amp; thanks to all the teachers - like my mom - who make a difference in their students’ lives. https://t.co/mDmuROgeQJ

Will 13 indictments get the big social media companies to stop opposing my bill to require disclosure and disclaimers on political ads? https://t.co/AKSTpmunG6
A federal grand jury just indicted 13 Russians for interfering in the 2016 elections—largely through social media engineering &amp; anonymous online ads. My #HonestAds Act w/ @SenJohnMcCain &amp; @MarkWarner would make public who bought an online political ad—the same rule as TV ads.

The killer in the Parkland, Florida school massacre should never have been allowed to purchase an AR-15.  I have long advocated for sensible gun legislation, including a bipartisan background check bill. It is time to bring these bills up for a vote. They will save lives.

Admin wants to completely cut the LIHEAP program — which provides heating assistance for thousands of Minnesotans — in its next budget. That’s unacceptable. Could get to -6º in Brainerd this week! LIHEAP is vital to many in MN who need it to heat their homes in tough winters.
In intel hearing today, six heads of our intelligence agencies unanimously agreed that Russia interfered with our 2016 elections and are seeking to do it again ahead of 2018 elections.

Thanks to all the security and law enforcement here in the cold for the Super Bowl!  And (since it is a good day to stand up for the FBI) thanks to the FBI agents in MN and across the country who protect us every day.

If the President is truly serious about doing more to bring down the cost of Rx drugs, we could start by passing my bipartisan bills to lower costs for Americans everywhere &amp; allow Medicare Part D negotiation! He should tell his party to allow for up or down votes on these bills.

It was like every bad ending to every bad @Vikings playoff game was redeemed by one single pass. Way to go Diggs! #Skol https://t.co/RNAZinWPwF
Best playoff game ever and i will personally volunteer to shovel Case Keenum’s driveway tonight!  #BringItHome #Skol
No fans will leave.  Still in shock.  And it is so cold outside.
I can breathe again.  They brought it home.  OMG #Skol On to Philadelphia.
Finally a good field goal moment in a @vikings playoff game!  49 yards #BringItHome
Oh baby it’s COLD outside but a 17-0 first half playoff score WARMS the hearts of every long-suffering @Vikings fan in the nation #BringItHome #Skol
What a catch
Those penalties were the revenge for the last vikings/saints playoff game #Skol
Great way to start a game #BringItHome   We’re trending (to a win) @Vikings

Met w MN business leaders today about preserving #NetNeutrality, which keeps a level playing field for small businesses — like @Zipnosis, our host. Startups &amp; small companies are the engine of our economy. That’s why I support the bipartisan bill to ensure an open/fair internet.
The big Haiti earthquake was 8 years ago today and here are some kids the President should meet. After the earthquake my office worked with 25 MN families to bring their kids home. Here I am with one of the adopting moms, Betsy Sathers, &amp; her kids. https://t.co/1Ejq34SUWV

DREAMers are listening to every word in Washington because their lives depend on it. Today they heard the President throw insults at immigrants when a bipartisan group of senators came forward with a plan to get something done. They deserve better. We must pass the DREAM Act now.
Primary voting in some states starts in just *two* months. @SenatorLankford and I sat down with @JudyWoodruff to get out the word about our bill to help states shore up their election equipment so we can prevent another cyberattack on our democracy. https://t.co/lGJfsgpP8Z

Our Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) does so much to protect our Great Lakes &amp; spur economic opportunity in MN. That’s why I’m leading a bipartisan effort to have Canada create a similar program, which could boost GLRI's effects for people in both countries.
NOW LAW: The SAFER Act—my bill w/ @JohnCornyn, @SenBennetCO, &amp; @SenDeanHeller to help reduce the national rape kit backlog—was signed into law. It will provide more resources for our law enforcement officers to cut down on the rape kit backlog &amp; find answers to unsolved crimes.

All Americans deserve safety/dignity in their senior years. In Nov. I called on Admin to do *more* to prevent &amp; investigate elder abuse in nursing homes. Instead they've been rolling back health/safety standards. I'll keep fighting to better protect seniors from abuse. https://t.co/xBdCnrEemN

@FCC The @FCC vote to end #NetNeutrality could stifle internet innovation by creating fast lanes and slow lanes depending on how much you can pay. That's why I've joined 16 other Senators on a bill to restore net neutrality.
We don't know many details of the #GOPTaxPlan that'll cost $1.5 trillion and affect almost every American. What we do know is that it'll slash the top rate for upper-income households (even deeper than the Senate bill), leaving middle &amp; working-class Americans to pick up the tab.
Today's @FCC vote to end #NetNeutrality protections is bad for consumers, businesses &amp; rural areas. These rules hold internet providers accountable &amp; promote competition/innovation. This isn’t the last word on net neutrality, &amp; I’ll keep fighting for a fair, free &amp; open internet.

Here’s my full statement on Sen. Al Franken's resignation: https://t.co/kdRH5FDqZc
Sexual harassment is unacceptable. This morning I spoke with Senator Franken and, as you know, he will be making an announcement about his future tomorrow morning.  I am confident he will make the right decision.
A free &amp; open internet is essential to our democracy. The FCC shouldn't let fake comments sway their decision on #NetNeutrality. I joined with @SenatorHassan &amp; 25 other senators calling for a delay on a vote until we investigate these fake comments. https://t.co/EBqC2rAbD9
This is good news. As co-chair of the NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus in the Senate, I've been working to help state and local governments update their emergency communications systems to help people more easily reach 9-1-1 when they need help. https://t.co/8oTNCWa0VJ
As Minnesota gears up to host #SuperBowlLII, I'm calling on the @NFL to take action to combat ticket fraud. This is a huge event that has attracted scammers to sell fake tickets. Let's get ahead of this before it becomes a problem &amp; showcase the best the Twin Cities has to offer.
11,000 DREAMers have already lost their DACA status. And nearly 800,000 students and workers who call the United States home could lose their DACA protection if we don’t pass the #DreamActNow. We should get this done before the end of the year!
Attended beautiful service today for Former MN AG Warren Spannaus.  Walter Mondale spoke about some great memories and the minister did a wonderful job of capturing Warren’s compassion and lifelong quest for justice. He also loved hymns and we sang his favorite ones...

ICYMI: The @EPA made a good decision to maintain the ethanol volume requirements through 2019. But we can do more on advanced biofuels. Renewable fuels strengthen our rural economies and give consumers more options at the pump. I’ll continue to push the Administration.
We need to keep the promises we've made to Americans who worked hard and paid into Medicare &amp; Social Security. This is one reason why the #GOPTaxPlan is so dangerous - we can’t let Medicare and Social Security be next up on the chopping block! https://t.co/BgYdMP0ax2

So here is pg 257 of the bill with handwritten changes...the tax bill is so last minute that they are scribbling on the margins. The issue? These scribbles (all 500 Pgs of them) will set the American tax system for a decade. #ThisIsYourTaxBillAndYouDon’tKnowWhat’sInIt  #SpeakOut https://t.co/S0LOmhOusV
Outrageous-the #GOPTaxPlan is 500 pgs long, we got it 3 hours ago and vote is TONIGHT. How is that enough time to review &amp; debate legislation that will completely change our nation's tax system for a decade. One trillion in debt...they don’t want America to know what is in it.

Just left the floor where I continued to make the case for going back to to the table to negotiate a tax reform bill that actually helps middle class families.  This bill adds over a trillion dollars in debt &amp; does nothing for America’s infrastructure
No hearings? Major debt?  That is what this is: It Started as a Tax Cut. Now It Could Change American Life.  https://t.co/eOd272IgDb
ALERT: Senate votes TODAY on tax plan. It's a bad deal that will blow up our nat’l debt, increase taxes on many middle-class Americans &amp; lead to millions losing healthcare. Call your senators now &amp; say we need a bipartisan bill that helps all Americans! 📞: (202) 224-3121
This week I joined 17 Dem Senators to tell the Republicans we want to work on reasonable bipartisan tax reform...bring down corporate rates &amp; bring $ back from overseas?  OK, But this bill goes too far, adds too much debt &amp; does too little for middle class. #ComeToTable

@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorLeahy @ChuckGrassley Enough.		When prices of the top best-selling drugs are skyrocketing, we cannot afford to put a former pharmaceutical executive in charge of our top health agency. https://t.co/wz6Ik4jj40
@SenJohnMcCain Enough. 87% of Americans want to make it easier for generic drugs to be released. Congress must support my bill w @SenatorLeahy to give generic drug manufacturers access to research &amp; my bill w @ChuckGrassley to stop payoffs to generic drug makers to keep products off the market. https://t.co/CTkFuIezq7
Enough. 72% of Americans support the purchase of prescription drugs – with the same dosages &amp; safety standards – imported from Canada. It’s time for Congress to act on my bill with @SenJohnMcCain to allow safe, affordable prescription drugs from Canada. https://t.co/IiImGtsdD0
