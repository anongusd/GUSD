@bukolasaraki Mr sin president,why didn't you call the whole party chairmen ,45 is just too lean, you are too ambitious,even your position as sp is shady
@vanguardngrnews He can easily be traced through his identity card
Brazilian players missing so many scoring chances...

RT @vanguardngrnews: Video: The IGP can't read ?===has been published on Vanguard News - https://t.co/6fAAXxf2Kc https://t.co/sl4IPt60Xw
@MobilePunch Mr Governor, your candidate is sure of victory,16-0 loading again
@vanguardngrnews May her soul rest in peace
@MobilePunch She was so interested in having fun with the dog and the video clearly showed her emotional embrace of the dog.
Have you ever told Nigerians that your huge monthly salary and allowances have been paid into your account?Mr Senator,prove and defend yourself...

@freshfmibadan You supposed to be giving many people enough time to respond to the news you had read to them
@Francis_madu1 @bukolasaraki @APCNigeria @NGRSenate @nassnigeria @SPNigeria @OnemolaOlu @_walebakare @babaidris090 @Onile050 @chiefow @ToyinSaraki "I will like to be your media Campaign personnel",are you a journalist?.The word, "personnel"is pluralistic,take note.
In this life,we need to always remember that nothing in this world is important,nothing is worthwhile to be counting on as big,because life is not worth celebrating;try to help others who are in need if you have the opportunity to help.

@yommywindy @MobilePunch You must be crazy,you keep your dirty mouth shut when you don't know how to contribute to issues
@MobilePunch But woman,why did you intervene into a matter that doesn't concern you and you brought out your mobile phone recording a police officer on his duty.Some women are good,but those that are known for formenting trouble are more than the good ones,example of such is this scenario...

@realFFK I begin to wonder why these terrorists were not arrested or even shot dead as they moved in to Yobe town to drop off the kidnapped Dapchi school girls this morning;thanks to God and the Administration of PMB.
@rihanna You are so beautiful
