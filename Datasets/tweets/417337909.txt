What f*cking invasion? 	#NoHumanIsIllegal	#NoNationalEmergency 	#NoWall https://t.co/wKqq5dIUAf
And there it is...		45: “I am going to be signing a National Emergency”		The National Emergency is having a f*cking rogue president! 		#ITMFA 	#NoWall	#NoNationalEmergency
@AneMenik 😂😂😂 I will read it as soon as our so called president finishes lying to us on national television. Ugh! 😑
Individual 1 is on national television telling outright lies. Declaring a National Emergency is illegal in this situation. Everything he is saying are lies. 		Now he wants the death penalty for drugs.		Mueller needs to do his job and I’m afraid it’s not going to happen. 		#ITMFA
@AneMenik @TreeHugger Everyone will benefit and profit from it eventually. It’s a great idea.

@Rourke199811 @stephsings1 I am upbeat about it. Once in a while I get pissed and have a little pity party but, in general, I do pretty well. I try to stay very active and that helps a lot. I hate winter b/c that’s when my body hurts the worst. It’s my organs I have to take care of. Thank you Christopher.
Well, any minute now, we’re going to have constitutional abuse of power by a rogue president. 		There is no National Emergency. 		There is a delusional moron in the People’s House. 		#NoWall	#ITMFA
@Boston_Grandpa @StopTheseThings Yeah, you’re correct. I shouldn’t have retweeted that. I live close to Georgetown, in Austin and read another article about it being 100% solar &amp; wind. I retweeted the wrong article. I took it down. 	There is however, currently a lawsuit over what it’s costing the residents.
@MarlaRPD @MrDane1982 I didn’t have the ability to present my true self until I was 17. I kept my sexuality hidden because I was #RaisedInACult. I knew I would be kicked out.

@jp10730105 I’m grateful that you are a compassionate provider. That’s a rarity. Have a great evening.
@jp10730105 I’m not, I’m a retired Federal Agent. I’m speaking from experience. I have an extremely large family and also had 2 complicated pregnancies. My wife had 1 complicated pregnancy. All 3 of our children could have easily died without the proper care.
@general_badass I also had to have a major surgery on a broken ankle and leg a couple of years ago. I was in the hospital 3 days/nights, lots of follow up appointments, etc. The bill was $437,000. We would have been up shit creek without a paddle had we not had good insurance. That. Is. Wrong.
@general_badass I get where you’re coming from. My son felt the same way until he got married and had a child. 	I do care about my credit and, I’m lucky to have very good insurance. I also believe we shouldn’t have to pay for it. I believe healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.
@ReviewXennial @Timion11 Kamala, because she’s fresh, excited, brilliant, and a woman of color.
@jp10730105 I’m so sorry for your loss. All of our experiences affect us in different ways.
@jp10730105 No, I’m just saying different people have different perspectives and experiences, that’s all.

@JoeLewin223 Luckily, I don’t believe there are too many...just some, religious left. Most people on the left are #science people, or believe in a higher power. They’re not obsessed though. Politicians, unfortunately, feel as if they have to portray some type of religion. #COEXIST it works.
