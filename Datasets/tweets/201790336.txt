Apparently Jayson Tatum cannot be fouled. Totally unfoulable.
Welcome to amateur hour in Philly.
Can the refs give the 76ers a confetti tech?
Very good point here. Even if they had won... https://t.co/cIyCbY4Llh
Confetti for overtime? That‚Äôs... interesting. #onlyinphilly
Great pass Redick! Also, I love you.
Does the Rookie of the Year voting include the playoffs? #lvp

Home cooking, big time. #refereeingismakebelieve https://t.co/3wx6aMxJKW
NBA refereeing is make believe.
I‚Äôm all set with Baynes covering Embiid. No more, please.
Kevin Hart scored one less point than Ben Simmons tonight. https://t.co/GEe98HFtKS
Aaron Baynes scored 5 times as many points as Ben Simmons tonight. Let that sink in...

Is lack of practice time last week why Butler didn't play? Asked what made Johnson Bademosi the best choice as the third corner last night, Belichick replies, "He practiced it the most."
