If we'd known about it then, we definitely would have reported it then. 	This came to light b/c -- after a @nytimes story last year profiled an illegal worker at Bedminster -- @trump Org began firing its illegal workers en masse, driving them out of the shadows. https://t.co/NWYdwPZKLz
What we still don't know:	--How many other @realDonaldTrump properties had/have illegal workers?	--Was Trump himself aware?	--If Trump Org. goes all-legal for next summer's golf season, how much will it raise their labor costs and affect their biz model?
So far, we've learned:	--@realDonaldTrump's biz employed illegal workers at 5 golf clubs (at least).	--At some clubs, it didn't enroll in e-Verify, the easiest step to screen new hires.	--Those practices didn't change much when Trump entered politics, or when he became POTUS.
