His voting record on the environment, healthcare and women‚Äôs rights are something we cannot remain silent about. An endorsement of @RepPeteKing is downright irresponsible. VOTE @liuba4congress!
Her opponent may claim to be in favor of gun reform, but what has he actually accomplished on this front in the decades he has been in Congress? He hasn‚Äôt made any effort to rally his fellow Republicans to pass any reasonable legislation since Parkland, and that is inexcusable.
Liuba has made the commitment to reject NRA money. Importantly, she‚Äôs also a mother of young children, so she is just as invested in making America safe from gun violence as we are.
we DEMAND more from our elected officials!	@liuba4congress  was one of seven congressional candidates on the panel at our very first event. She was a stand out. She spoke passionately about the urgent need for gun reform.
