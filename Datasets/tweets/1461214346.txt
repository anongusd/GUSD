@cassi_niedziela It’s definitely a monumental disappointment. The Supreme Court will be Conservative leaning for the next few decades. It’s a sad sight to see an institution of this stature, which is supposed to be independent, become so tainted with bitter partisanship.
@cassi_niedziela Well, we’re all entitled to our own opinions. I do hope that you understand that I approach this issue with a great deal of care, and I believe that victims of sexual assault should be heard.		This whole thing is just so fucked up.
@cassi_niedziela I don’t know what the right answer to all of this is. But I don’t think this is a black and white issue. Teenage boys make stupid, fucked up mistakes in high school, but I don’t think that should ruin the rest of their lives.
@cassi_niedziela Assault is assault. And assault is wrong. But do you really believe that we should ruin a man’s life because of a drunken mistake he made as a minor? Especially when the allegation isn’t even rape. (If the allegation was rape, I think the discourse would be much different.)
Again... https://t.co/Ee0ZhGiufp
@cassi_niedziela And even if he did do it, I’m not going to judge his character based off something he did while intoxicated at a high school party at the age of 17. That’s just not fair.

@ReginaP87963387 (2/2) The Supreme Court rarely does anything, despite judicial review making it, arguably, the most powerful of the three branches of government.
@ReginaP87963387 (1/2) Exactly. Agreed. It was FDR who once said “It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”
