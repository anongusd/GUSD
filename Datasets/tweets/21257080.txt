With that said, I would like to wish everyone a good night and farewell. Thank you.
We, #thepeople, have nothing more at stake than our own futures. Many of us are willfully donating our own time, resources, and SANITY, to ensure our right to live remains intact. America lives within us, #thepeople and will continue on forever so long as one of us still stand.
#thepeople have spoken, repeatedly, and they do not support Kavanaugh or the actions of the current President. In closing, I would like to thank the tireless members of #TheResistance and #thepeople, who continue to fight and investigate these matters out of their sheer courage.
I call into suspect any member of the supreme court who continues to back Kavanaugh or the President in lieu of the overwhelming evidence and the outlash of #thepeople. I believe that this defense is backed either by special interests or a dedicated ignorance of the evidence.
I call into question these interests because I gaurentee you that the lack of transparency is enough to prove to #thepeople that it is not in the best interests of #thepeople to continue to support Kavanaugh or the current President.
Nor did Kavanaugh consent to a polygraph test. The lack of either of these items, shows a lack of honesty and character. My personal investigation and investigations from many groups around the country show that both the current President and Kavanaugh hold special interests.
There is heavy suspicion regarding the #KavanaughHearings, in the form of the lack of deeper investigation. Donald shows this by refusing to withdraw or suspend confirmation until a federal investigation has taken place Kavanaugh himself refused to ask for a federal investigation
#thepeople are winded and exhausted, we all followed Kavanaugh's trial today. I want to remind everyone that I am an independant, devoid of alllegiance for either side of the political party. I stand for #thepeople and strictly for #thepeople. That said, I believe that

Without either a Polygraph or FBI investigation, there is a reasonable doubt to Kavanaugh's innocence. If Kavanaugh is voted in, it will absolutely destroy the credibility of the Supreme Court. #KavanaughHearings
My personal take away is exactly what the evidence has pointed to and continues to affirm, Kavanaugh is unfit for the court and that there is evidence of corruption within the Senate. Kavanaugh has neither a polygraph test or an FBI investigation.  #KavanaughHearings
You can almost see the rising in heart rate between Kavanaugh and the Senator right now. I wish ABC's banner wasn't blocking everyone's names.   #KavanaughHearings
Simple answer to a very serious question. "No." #KavanaughHearings
Ouch. Did not watch Dr. Ford's testimony. I wonder why? Her testimony puts a tremendous amount of risk on Kavanaugh. One would think that with so much at stake, one would remain extremely informed.  #KavanaughHearings
Yes or no. Simple question with a simple answer.  #KavanaughHearings

As always, Keep fighting the good fight and never forget, the truth hurts, but it's what will set you free.
Many homes have issues with old piping, wood, and electrical that is consistently covered with paint as a way to hide problems and serve as temporary fixes. These complaints are extremely visible just by digging through the various reviews posted on housing websites.
Forcing residents into debt by forcing signatures into lengthy contracts and stockpiling exhuberant amounts of fines and fees onto residents. These people find themselves victims of being locked into specific areas in which many homes are not properly taken care of.
Another important thing to note is AZ's current housing crisis. Once again, discrimination and stereotyping prevents many residents from finding proper housing, forcing them into high density, high crime areas. Many families, (I included) have become victim of housing contracts
In personal interviews, I have found that many residents are being prescribed the wrong types of medications due to an attitude of stereotyping groups. This is reflected by AZ's incredibly low ranking in mental health. (48th out of 50 as of this most recent year.)
However, there is a few areas in which are important to note. Currently, AZ's health industry needs to be checked. Seniors, Adults, and Children are not recieving the care that they require. You can see this in individual interviews with residents and @DeptVetAffairs
@RubenGallego Good Morning, this is MG42, Guardian Angel, coming in with a few informative tips to aid you in your campaign. Currently, here in AZ, we have a generational gap that keeps the conservative elderly and the progressive youth split on subjects and ideas.

For the pathway to heaven does not travel in a downwards direction.
It's shown that a person will only try something so many times before giving up on it completely. How many times can a person try to participate in life before giving up entirely? We cannot be a society that leaves people behind, it is our job to raise each other.
They say insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. How many times will we throw ourselves at the same wall, expecting the next hit will come crumbling down? In the modern era, how many applications will we fill only to be denied?
How is that we spend more time working and recovering from such, then time with friends and loved ones? How much resentment do we have from missing an event, losing a chance? How many people spend so much of their time focused on love and wanting to feel loved?
We've done all this work to make things better and yet, those ideas and inventions have only served to lengthen our work day. Many of us don't even have time to spend taking care of animals or gardens. Many long for the simplicity of the past, burdened by the complexity of today.
People have sacrificed their entire lives, sometimes even their own family to give others the benefit and convenience of having more time with loved ones. It always seems like the more we create to save time, the more our free time is ripped away from us.
"A few things, though, are necessary, or just one." 		In the modern age, there so many tasks that we are forced to concern ourselves with. So much so, that the stress on our children alone is enough to drive them to suicide and homicide. Never forget what's really important.

Why must we make it even harder for them by having people work today?
The saga that people leave behind when they pass on is something to be cherished, to eventually be celebrated. We've come far from that dreadful day and I believe it's time that we come to recognize that. Today is a hard day for so many families and survivors.
With that said, I would like to bid everyone a good day... and a good night! After 17 years of remembrance, I still don't understand why this day isn't a federally recognized holiday. Although it is a day of mourning, we shouldn't need to mourn forever.
In order to change, we must first acknowledge that our vulnerability exists. But on this day, through our own vulnerability, heroes emerged, we gathered together, and the unity makes us stronger, both as people and as a country. 9/11, we will #NeverForget.
There is no shame in admitting that we are not invincible. As a country, just like people, we are all vulnerable to attack. At any given point in time, we could be swept away from all that we hold dear. To admit vulnerability is not an act of weakness, it's a show of strength.
to please #lightacandle, say a prayer, bow their heads, or otherwise take a moment to stop, honor those whom we've lost, thank those who valiantly rushed to respond, and to appreciate the support that came from both near and far. This day is one of remembrance and vulnerability
realizing it, many were swept up in a powerful echo that briefly united the country. The resounding impact was so strong, that even people outside of the U.S.A. stopped, prayed, and supported all the victims of this tragic incident. Today, I'd like to all the citizens of the US
Nearly 20 years later, we are still rebuilding. Families and friends may forever be disrupted, but today we stand here, in remembrance of the innocents, the soldiers, and the community. In that moment, however, something powerful echoed throughout the nation, and without
On this day, 17 years ago, the U.S.A. experienced one of it's most tragic losses. On this day, we lost not only two powerful symbols of hope, diligence, and freedom, but countless lives, and it shattered the sense of security that our country had come to appreciate and enjoy.

These tariffs are just a front, an illusion of action to cover up what's really happening. We already have Ford telling us that they won't release their newest vehicle here in the U.S. because of tariffs and there is a multitude of allies upset with us. https://t.co/oZWvvHNDJf
https://t.co/IApAD8dbZk	What this data actually means is that the top U.S. import to China is actually the US dollar and this is reflected in the fact that the U.S. is currently investing Chinese businesses. These tariffs are draining the US, while strengthening China. https://t.co/4Id0vy670t
Now here's where things get interesting. Donald imposed new sets of tariffs. Donald has announced $200B worth of tariffs on China, claiming that he'll make China pay. But when you look at the actual data, the US only exports a mere 1/5 the amount of goods to China as it imports

"Thanks for your help!" said the little red hen. "I will." And the little red hen¬†ate¬†the bread¬†all by herself.¬†Angry, hurt, betrayed, and abandoned.
When the bread¬†was finished, the tired little red hen¬†asked her friends, "Who will help me eat¬†the bread?"	"I will," barked the lazy dog.	"I will," purred the sleepy cat.	"I will," quacked the noisy yellow duck.
The tired little red hen¬†asked her friends, "Who will help me bake¬†the bread?"	"Not I," barked the lazy dog.	"Not I," purred the sleepy cat.	"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.	"Then I will," said the little red hen. So the little red hen¬†baked¬†the bread¬†all by herself.
"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.		"Then I will," said the little red hen. So the little red hen¬†brought the wheat¬†to the mill¬†all by herself, ground the wheat¬†into flour, and carried the heavy sack¬†of flour¬†back to the farm.
So the little red hen¬†cut the wheat¬†all by herself.		When all the wheat was cut, the little red hen asked her friends, "Who will help me take the wheat¬†to the mill¬†to be ground into flour?"		"Not I," barked the lazy dog.	"Not I," purred the sleepy cat.
When the seeds¬†had grown, the little red hen¬†asked her friends, "Who will help me cut the wheat?"	"Not I," barked the lazy dog.	"Not I," purred the sleepy cat.	"Not I," quacked the noisy yellow duck.	"Then I will," said the little red hen.

Once upon a time, there was a little red hen¬†who lived on a farm. She was friends with a lazy dog¬†, a sleepy cat¬†, and a noisy yellow duck.¬†	One day the little red hen¬†found some seeds¬†on the ground. The little red hen¬†had an idea. She would plant the seeds.

We are all SOLDIERS.	So remember, Heroes Never Die and Never Stop Fighting the Good Fight.	MG42 - 2:13 AM, 8/14/2018, Arizona, USA
We are tired of walking in circles. We are sick of the fear of others and above all, the fear of ourselves. We are better and stronger than ever before. We are people and we are strong both with and without our fellows. Individuals are strong, communities stronger.
Liars only hold power over those who are quick to judge. It is why they set out to sap us of our belief in something greater. All life has the power to achieve something great. Never forget that, The invisible chains that have held us down have become weak and brittle.
As people of The World, we are no longer chained to the ways and the thinking of the old. The things that we used to use to define us as important no longer hold their power over us. We are what they call disillusioned. The Truth will set us free, has set us free.
To all my followers, never forget, knowledge is power. As of this current moment, information is the most valuable thing that anyone can own. The Truth will set you free and the truth lies in the information that you arm yourself with. Be subjective and objective at the same time

#theworldiswatching is sick of your shit and they are communicating several things, @WhiteHouse The number 1 thing that they are communicating is that they no longer fear the @USArmy and are willing to resort to aggression in order to get what they want. Stop lying to #ThePeople
#6. Finally, the American government should probably recruit me somewhere, being that I am the current acting #Globalists leader, so that I can provide better and more secure support to the #theworldiswatching
#5. An IMMEDIATE public apology issued by @realDonaldTrump addressed to The World regarding the atrocities that @realDonaldTrump is DIRECTLY and INDIRECTLY responsible for during his entire campaign.
#2. Immediate closure of the detention centers, or the conversion of these centers into immigration centers or REFUGEE centers	#3. The removal of all current trade tariffs as imposed by @realDonaldTrump 	#4. The immediate return to strengthening global relationships through @UN
I am just as sick of this charade as everyone else, so I'm issuing this public announcement. The World is sick of your BS and there are a few steps right now to prevent international nuclear war. 		#1. Recall any US Troops that are not actively defending another country.

@neiltyson It would be only natural for the Mongoose to appear near the serpent(Serpentus) in order to counteract the snake in a sort of yin/yang relationship. There is recorded Mongoose worship in the form of Egyptian culture. According to Wikipedia, Ra himself transformed
@neiltyson Mongoose has always been a symbol of a creature resistant to snake venom and the killer of snakes. They are repeatedly used as a symbol of the truth, of cunning, and of a heroic creature who is unafraid to face great adversity.
@neiltyson I believe that the Mongoose constellation actually sits within the Hydra formation somewhere near the head or the belly. In fact, it's within my gut, that the CUP that's presented within the hydra constellation is indeed, the constellation of the Mongoose.
@neiltyson would enter the belly of reptiles much larger than them and gnaw them from the inside out. The Mongoose has been represented throughout World folklore as a heroic beast that would be mistaken for a demon. One can see this in the story of the Brahmin and the Mongoose
@neiltyson Misrepresented. The Mongoose, or ichneumon appears within the constellation HYDRA. Within Egyptian folklore, he was referred to as "the Pharaoh's Rat" or mistaken for a type of otter. Lutra. But again, within folklore the Mongoose was presented as a beast who

The only way to prevent nuclear devastation is by uniting as a global entity. Otherwise, it's no different than putting a loaded gun on the mantle.
"Russia and China still maintain significant nuclear presence. Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility. To maintain our own methods of deterrence, we need a weapon of overwhelming power." - Kenneth Baker, MGS 1998		The World is that weapon.
In other words, there's plenty of available nuclear material and scientists for making a bomb. We live in an age where any small country can have a nuclear weapons program." 	"What about the other super powers?"
"It stands for Material Unaccounted For. It proves a well organized black market in nuclear materials. Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn.
"Many of the drums are corroded with nuclear waste spilling out of them."	"Unbelievable."	"Not only that but several pounds of MUF are reported every year."	"MUF?"
"No."	"Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high, as far as you can see, because there's no real way to dispose of the stuff."	"SO THEY JUST TRY TO CLOSE THE LID AND TRY TO PRETEND LIKE ITLL GO AWAY?"	"Essentially, yesAnd they're not even doing a good job of storing it."
https://t.co/L4kF4mr6E8		"Oh you're wrong, the threat of nuclear war isn't gone, in fact, it's greater than it's ever been! The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even today. Listen have you ever seen a warehouse of nuclear material?" https://t.co/xbGObdAJ4X

My name is MG42, and my WORDS (thoughts, ideas, speech, writing) are POISON(toxic, ToxinMongoose, venom, sickness). They spread and manifest slowly over the course of time, festers.
A practical use for it. I started throwing out KEYwords and catchphrases left and right to see how fast it would spread. When one part of the city starts to unknowingly pass around your mannerisms, hehehe, well... I guess that's called setting an example.
That I was just gonna get banned anyway. Funny how well it took off. But truth be told? I JUST LIKED THE LOOK. Us 90s kids were uh, taught that it was cool to be different, yanno. It wasn't until I discovered how quickly my way of speaking would "infect" others did I find
Clues in their character dialogues by emphasizing the words with a different style or different color text, I decided to bring it to the chatrooms in spite of everyone's complaints and attempts to conform me to everyone elses behavior. I mean, I was under the constant assumption
And so, I started typing the way I talked, which included putting emphasis on specific vocabulary words. How was I supposed to do that though, without being able to bold, underline, or italicize in every platform I used? Thanks to modern video games who would highlight
I'll tell you why it caught on. It was me, blowing off everyone's complaints because they kept banning me from furry chatrooms anyway for trying to have debates on the problems within the fandom. It was totally taboo for anyone to speak out against the fandom. https://t.co/cNRhqgZ7HN

Serves the people. Sure, we can maintain imaginary lines that we can call borders and give everyone the right to govern themselves as they please. But there are ideals and there are laws and there are things that all thr countries in the world need to adopt, to save us the people
Streets. Poison in our land. Poison in our food. Poison in our water. Posion in our air. And poison in our people. The only way to solve all these problems is not to tackle them as individuals, but as a unified group. We can no longer remain seperate countries. This no longer
Kamualii McCabe, and I'm here for the people. For us. For the World. President or not, my organization and I will continue to push the World towards globalization, because we don't just have individual problems right now. We have global problems. There is war, suffering in our
I believe that I would make an excellent President, because I am here as a representative of the World. My only goal, my only concern, is to save the World, and the only reason why I'm doing it is because my heart tells me that's the right thing to do. My name is Wilson
But this is the result of caring too much about trivial things and being unable to open one's mind to new possibilities and change. Time moves only in a singular direction and holding on too tightly to our past convictions is killing us as a civilization right now.
Of never knowing what it's like to truly be cared for by themselves and the others around them. We've forgotten as adults and a population that the most human thing to do is care. We care for each other, our children, our plants, our homes, our food, our animals. We care alot.
We set the examples for them. And when our children grow up seeing us do nothing but bicker and argue over things so trivial like what is moral and what is right, we set the stage for them to grow up doing exactly the same, further isolating the population and injecting a fear
We should be embracing each other in our different ideals because without discussions and dialouge, we can never further the human race. Every person has a unique story to them, which means that every person has something unique to teach. Our children copy our behavior.
That benefit the most amount of people. We shouldnt be trying to stifle growth with the disbelief that The World cannot hold this size of population. We have the ability to creatw and maintain entirely self-sustained ecosystems here on Earth, In space, and even on the moon
The best way to do this is simply to make people happy. I'm not talking about kissing rump(I mean, I know some folk who wouldnt complain) but by serving as an example to the people. We need to show the people that our government is willing to make sacrifices and comprimises
With automation emerging across The World, we have a new problem of how do we keep people working to support themselves? We have to find new jobs in new sectors and we have to learn to embrace each other and our cultural, racial, sexual, and religious beliefs.
By companies looking to gain the most profit while spending the least amount of money possible. Everyone should know at this point that you have to spend money to make money and hoarding money slowly robs everyone of their chance to pursue the American dream.
That they are incredibly important to the well-being of the people, but for some odd reason they have extremely low budgets. I would advocate for the reform of labor unions, continue wage increases, and return the rights to employees that have been slowly sapped from them
All programs with empirical evidence that show they provide great benefits to communities, by giving them a foundation to stand. No good human or beast deserves to suffer the life that we have put them through for the past 20 years. In all these sectors, its been shown
All soldiers would recieve sensitivity training, to know, understand, and how to react to different situations to prevent the loss of life on either side. I would return welfare programs like social security, food stamps, rehabilation services, temporary to permanent housing
On the wealth and well-being of their communities. I would work to support non-profits everywhere and I would honor all our emergency crews by making them official soldiers of the US military. After all, they are all groups who risk their lives to protect the people they love.
Commodity then we can see that any waste of life is a disservice to the people and the communities and cultures that they reside in. The loss of life sets us back and this has been shown in countless studies on how a single imprisoned person can have grest impact
I would return sexual liberties to people, because it is now understood that the prohibition of such behaviors increases the rate of abuse and violent crime, leaving people to question their own identities, and cause them to inflict great harm. If one saw life as a type of
I would give teachers raises and fund schools across the country, because not only has it been shown that pouring money into these two budgets significantly reduces the rate of violent crime, but because it would help to pave the way for a clean, high tech future and new industry
My next goal would be to legalize marijuana, for its been proven that opiod addicts who switch to marijuana quit opiods at a 40% success rate. This act would not just cause the U.S.'s economy to soar, but it would create thousands of new jobs in the health industry.
It has been shown that not only should the price of neccesities go down but that tue value of luxaries should be increasing. But its not, it's all flipped upside down. Necessities are extremely high righ now with luxaroes being slow.
If I was elected, my first priority would be to mass produce cheap housing and make improvements to one of our agriculture system to drop prices dramatically and attempt to fund a way to infinite food and water supply, because with all the evidence
Many of us know the origins of racisim and nationalisim. Most of us already know the atrocities commited  by those who came to conquer. We know the effects of what happens to children when they learn not to trust the adults. I'm here to put a stop to it.
We are killing each other and ourselves for a reality where we as a population are more focused on the trivial details of a cartoon rabbits bosom then we are about things that could actively change our lives for the better. This is not the future we concieved.
I firmly believed that we knew the solutions to all of our current problems and that much was true! But we never put those plans into action and look where it's got us, slinging feces back and forth at each other with little to no progress towards creating solutions
In great strides by raising awareness, advocating for those who had yet to learn how to stand up for ourselves. I know how to listen, to study, and I know the importance of sharing our knowledge and maintaing our culture. One can never completely erase soneone's history.
To be an Anthropologist means that I specialize in the study of humans. I am also a man who is unafraid to put himself at great risk for the sake of the people. I am willing to make personal sacrifices to end conflict and reach solutions. My writing has already been effective
I am also a man unswayed by money, fame, sex, and control. I am an Anthropologist, A mob boss, a rebel leader, a gangster, a healer, a priest, a monk, a shaman, a knight, a mediatior, a prince, a nomad, a teacher, a doctor, a soldier, a general, a diplomat, an abassador
I am dedicated to protecting the lives and freedoms of the people by offering them choices, a good way to about things, the wrong way to go about things. In this manner, we effectively reduce the amount of abuse, self-harm, and corruption that we see today.
My focus is on the people, for it's evident and shown across history that it is much better to support the masses than to serve individual purpose. Helping, inspiring, and being there for others makes people geniunely feel good, because these actions are intrinsic accomplishments
There are many reasons why I believe that I would make an excellent president. The first and most important of all is that I am willing to make great sacrifices to benefit the largest amounts of populations possible. I love the people and I fight for them every day. https://t.co/mG5XeKRTsQ
