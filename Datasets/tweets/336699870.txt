Warburg: development &amp; diplomacy are incredible tools that reap enormous value for US interests, esp given relative size comp. to mil budget
Warburg (channeling Secretary Gates): We have more members of military bands than we do foreign service officers
Bergner (fmr SFRC staff dir): complete agreement w/Warburg on Congressional use of war powers resolution
Warburg: must use war powers resolution to reign in exec power so use of force has clear nat security goals, an exit strat, &amp; public support
Warburg: drift in both parties toward isolationism/unilateralism is dangerous, multilateralism is necessary to face 21st century challenges
Warburg (@UVaBatten): recent presidents have been too quick to use force despite lack of sustainability, transparency, and exit strategy
Panel 2: when is military force justified? Multilateralism? American public views? War powers resolution and role of Congress in AUMF?
Doran: regime change doesn't =military intervention, as evidenced by US policy of supporting regime change in Soviet Union during Cold War
Doran: "vital interest of US is to protect free flow of oil from Persian gulf at reasonable prices and from multiplicity of suppliers"
Giraldi: "we have a huge moral responsibility to help Syrian refugees bc we were major contributors to the catastrophe in #Syria"
Giraldi: biggest lesson from Iraq is importance of maintaining the firewall between intelligence and policy. Bad intelligence=bad policy
