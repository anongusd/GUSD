.@SenatorMenendez on North Korea: We need to know the totality of their inventory before you can jump off to what denuclearization looks like and what you can agree to. We had none of that. #AMR
.@SenatorMenendez: nuclear disarmament is far more difficult than the art of the deal. It's not about personal diplomacy or made for TV moments. I did not think the President should have gone to the summit without the preparation. #AMR
Michael Leiter: I think its fair to say that this admin, President Trump specifically, are neither focused on our allies nor focused on predictability. And both of those things cause many problems in many areas, to include North Korea. #AMR
RT @SenatorMenendez: TUNE IN: I'm about to go LIVE on @MSNBC with @mitchellreports. 📺
.@RNicholasBurns: I think that President Trump has been right to try diplomacy with Kim Jong Un, clearly the buddy philosophy, I can become his best friend, that hasn't worked, Kim hasn't been moved by that at all #AMR
.@RNicholasBurns: the President was right to walk away from it but I think the President really misstepped on question of Otto Warmbier - for the President to essentially let him off the hook - the President should have stood up for the memory of Warmbier and his family #AMR

Asked if joint military exercises w/ South Korea (suspended since Singapore summit) will now resume @realDonaldTrump says he told the generals we spend hundreds of millions of dollars, exercises are "nice" and "we play the war games" but claims U.S. doesn't get reimbursed
Since Singapore U.S. has been waiting for North Korea to list a full inventory of his weapons program critical to any verifiable denuclearization and @SecPompeo confirms #KimJongUn still won't deliver that list.
Trump says #KimJongUn was willing to dismantle Yongbyon nuclear facility but wanted sanctions lifted 1st. Also confirms the U.S. knew of other facilities including a 2nd uranium plant beyond Yongbyon. @SecPompeo confirms Kim wouldn't deliver list of his weapons a key U.S. demand
As summit ends without signing ceremony Trump says you always have to be prepared to walk, that he could have signed something today actually had papers ready to sign but it wouldn't have been appropriate
At Hanoi newser @realDonaldTrump says he tried to watch as much as he could of Michael Cohen testimony but "having a fake hearing in the middle of this summit was a terrible thing" but says he was impressed that Cohen said he saw no collusion w/ Russia
Summit ends early as @realDonaldTrump says #KimJongUn wants to de-nuke but not all the areas the U.S. wants adds that we know the country (North Korea) very well. Says Kim promised he will not be doing testing but it wasn't appropriate to sign an agreement today
.@realDonaldTrump says #KimJongUn wanted all the sanctions lifted and we were not willing to do that.  Says Kim has a vision (on denuclearization) but it's not our vision "on this occasion we had to walk"
Hanoi summit ends early with no deal says White House we live with @realDonaldTrump news conference answering q’s about his talks with #KimJongUn

RT @KatyTurNBC: Cohen: Not one Republican on this committee has so far asked me about President Trump.
.@KenDilanianNBC: during the presidential campaign, Trump had a real estate deal that required Putin's approval from which he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars. We know that. But Cohen's testimony is presenting it before the public in a new way today #AMR
.@Mimirocah1: So standing alone, this testimony won't get him a reduction. But his incentive to tell the truth here is huge, because it will also allow that to go into a letter if the southern district ends up writing a reduction to his sentence. #AMR
.@KatyTurNBC on Trump Tower meeting: Cohen is alleging that Don Jr would have to go to his dad for that because it was a meet of consequence. Don Jr has completely denied that. #AMR
Jeremy Bash: And second, that he had strong suspicions that Donald Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, approved it, and that he would not have allowed Donald junior to do anything without Donald Trump Sr.'s permission. (2/2) https://t.co/ZUGG6hBpSf
Jeremy Bash: Two things related to Russia: one is that he knew that Roger stone had called trump and said we know about the hacked e-mails being dumped in advance... 1/2
.@matthewamiller on House R’s questioning Cohen: If I were them, I would ask myself, how have I put myself in that position that I'm the one coming off worse in these exchanges than someone who is now a convicted felon? #AMR
.@matthewamiller: I think actually one of the biggest takeaways from today, party from all these new factual revelations is Michael Cohen's demeanor and the way he's held up under questioning from Republican members of congress. #AMR
.@matthewamiller: We now have a witness alleging crimes by the President under oath, on the record in front of congress and the American people. The justice department apparently has evidence to back that up, has some evidence to back that up #AMR
Michael Cohen: I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr Trump for 10 years. And the fact that you pull up a news article that has no value to it, and you want to use that as the premise for discrediting me.
Michael Cohen: I protected Mr Trump for ten years. The more people that follow Mr Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering

White House apparently barring wire service members from press pool for Trump-Kim photo ops in Hanoi because of earlier shouted q's on "sensitive" subjects (Michael Cohen testimony) which @realDonaldTrump himself had tweeted about from Hanoi, #freepress
Updating: pool says @realDonaldTrump said “we’ll see” to shouted q about whether they would agree to end Korean War.	Experts warn that could lead to #KimJongUn demanding US troop withdrawal from South Korea and should not happen before real steps on denuclearization

.@FrankFigliuzzi1 on Cohen: What he says needs to be verifiable by documents and witnesses. Sometimes best motivator for someone to come clean is imminent sound of prison door closing. He wants southern district of NY to be happy and thats best motivation for him to tell truth
.@nedprice: President Trump in doing this, pursuing this dialogue with NKorea, has established this dangerous and cartoonish binary. Its either fire and fury and rush to war or its this even stranger bromance we see now btw Trump &amp; Kim Jong-un, the fact that they are in love
Tom Donilon: We haven't seen testing. By the way, that testing stopped before Singapore. But the program isnt frozen. Theyre proceeding on missile development. The last thing he talked abt, which is, I'm in no rush as long as there's no testing, there's a serious analytical error
Tom Donilon: President said 8months ago that threat from NKorea has been eliminated. Thats not true. Theres no agreement on what denuclearization means at this point, will be important to talk abt at summit. Theres no strategic commitment in evidence to get rid of nuclear weapons
.@PhilipRucker: When he sees those letters from Kim Jong-un, he thinks that could potentially produce an historic agreement between the 2 countries. His advisers are much less gullible, so to speak, when it comes to this issue, they feel like it's a much tougher road ahead. #AMR
.@PhilipRucker: He's very proud of them. He's received five or six of them over the last several months from Kim Jong-un who has used flowery language, calling him "Your excellency," referring to his political genius and smarts and how much he's enjoyed getting to know him. #AMR

.@McFaul on US leaving INF: It was strategic mistake. Russia was violating INF treaty, altho there was a dispute abt that. But they were. The prudent course wouldve been to put info, declassify that info, have public discussion of how Russia was violating, then get back to treaty

.@kasie: Those divisions that were created during that (2016 dem) primary were deep. They were ugly. They were very painful. And some of them haven't healed quite yet. I do think that the money that's poured in for Bernie is a sign that many of those voters are still with him

.@JoyceWhiteVance: Someone encouraged the President to call on Butina and that is what led Trump for the first time to indicate that he might be willing to relax sanctions against Russia. That tidbit is too tempting for prosecutors not to follow up on. #AMR
.@JuliaEAinsley: Mueller is not bringing the charges here, but he could be privy to some of the information from Butina's cooperation since her goals are the same as a lot of the people who are being investigated. #AMR
.@JuliaEAinsley: The judge took a moment to address the fact that the	gov. has recordings of phone calls Butina had with a journalist. It’s	believed her lawyer Robert Driscoll had perhaps set up the calls, which puts him in a conflict of interest to influence her plea. #AMR

.@Tom_Winter: This is the pretty incredible fall of somebody who is obviously one of the President's most prominent surrogates, and somebody who spoke very highly of him #AMR
.@Tom_Winter: Cohen acknowledged that the President has called him weak in tweets and Trump said that he was weak, and it is that weakness that led Cohen to cover up for some of the president's deeds #AMR

.@Tom_Winter: He came into the court shortly before 10:20 and we were not scheduled to start until 1, and we did start early which is unusual. #AMR
.@KenDilanianNBC: Michael Cohen made the point that he really wanted to get on with his life, and that is why he kept this sentencing date. #AMR
.@KenDilanianNBC: Cohen emphasized the fact that he committed many of these crimes from what he called blind loyalty to the President #AMR
.@KenDilanianNBC: The judge was also particularly moved by Cohen's commission of a number of crime for his own personal benefit, referencing the fact that he had committed the tax fraud and the bank fraud. #AMR
.@Mimirocah1:  This is a complete corruption of our federal election system, and it was done in the biggest campaign finance donation probably in our history in the sense of how meaningful it was #AMR
.@Mimirocah1: The judge found that Michael Cohen's crime was “sophisticated.” In other words, that is a term of art in the sentencing guidelines and there a sophisticated enhancement that can be applied #AMR

Jim Baker: Im always proud 41 used to describe our relationship of big brother little brother–we would have spirited discussion but he had very effective way of letting me know discussion was over– hed look at me and say ‘Baker if youre so smart why am I president and youre not?'
Jim Baker chokes back tears at end of eulogy saying "our glory Mr President was having you as such a friend" #Bush41
Jim Baker says #Bush41 and he had relationship of older and younger brother and they had spirited conversations when they disagreed but Baker always knew when time for talk was over and Bush would say: Baker if you're so smart how come I'm President and you're not?
Jim Baker says of #Bush41 yes, he had the courage of a warrior. But when the time came for prudence he had the greater courage of a peacemaker -(speaking of Desert Storm, the 1st Gulf War during which Baker was Secretary of State)
Baker, who worked for Reagan as well as Bush: "He was not considered a skilled speaker but his deeds were eloquent...he possessed the classic virtues of our civilization and his faith...George Bush was temperate in words, thought and deed." #Bush41

.@JillWineBanks: You can't say something is a witch hunt when you have so many people indicted, so many people in jail, so many people convicted, so many people pleading guilty #AMR
.@JillWineBanks: This is not a witch hunt. It has never been a witch hunt. It is a search for the truth, whatever that truth turns out to be. #AMR
.@JillWineBanks: There's plenty of circumstantial evidence that a pardon to Manafort could be seen as obstruction. It certainly should be politically toxic #AMR
.@JillWineBanks: When you pardon someone who is testifying or could testify against you, who's part of an investigation of your campaign, you're treading very closely on what is obstruction. #AMR
.@JillWineBanks: They had signed agreements. They were talking to the Kremlin. It was not a light agreement. That's like saying you're a little bit pregnant. He was clearly in business with the Russians. #AMR
.@JillWineBanks: Saying it was sort of a light relationship in light of all the documentary evidence we now have and the testimony of Mr. Cohen shows that that is delusional. #AMR

.@emilyjanefox: It is very difficult for me to believe that if the Trump children were involved in some sort of real estate deal that Michael Cohen didn't know. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Cohen had a front row seat to a lot of what the family was doing in the Trump organization. It is a very small office and mom and pop shop, and the building where all of the adult children grew up. Their offices were all right next to each other. #AMR

.@JoyceWhiteVance: There's just something unusual where Trump gets a pass, certainly from his own party. One hopes there will be accountability at the end of the Mueller investigation. #AMR
Chuck Rosenberg: These unfettered powers we always talk about are still circumscribed by the criminal law. Whether or not he intends to obstruct justice would be the inquiry. #AMR
Chuck Rosenberg: On one hand, the President has unfettered power under the constitution to pardon whoever he wants for any federal crime. On the other hand, it's actually not completely unfettered. If he's doing it for a corrupt purpose, then it could be obstruction of justice.
.@JoyceWhiteVance: We don't know if there is more tape recording of conversations between Cohen and the President. We know that the President doesn't use e-mail.
.@JoyceWhiteVance: Prosecutors executed a search warrant for Cohen's home and businesses and took boxes full of documents and recordings, and all sorts of evidence. They have spent months since then combing thru evidence so that nobody is going to be asked to rely on Cohen's word
.@emilyjanefox: It is a very different relationship between Manafort and his attorneys and Michael Cohen and his attorneys and prosecutors. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Cohen volunteered to bring up the President's name in court today under oath. Nobody was forcing him to get up to say that it is the President who directed him to make payments to women who had alleged affairs to him leading up to the election.
.@KatyTurNBC: What we got today out of the filing is a little bit more information about the time line #AMR
.@KatyTurNBC: Federal prosecutors don't believe in coincidence, and what we know from Robert Mueller's team is that they are putting together a detailed time line. #AMR
.@KatyTurNBC: You have to consider the motivations, the actions, what Donald Trump knew and how much can conceivably be coincidence here #AMR
.@KatyTurNBC: The investigation is painting a picture of a group of people around Donald Trump who thought for so long that there were no consequences, and they could do whatever they want and they would ultimately be bulletproof. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Michael Cohen feels no allegiance to President Trump anymore, and no reason to protect him. He feels every reason to come clean about what he knows. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Part of the reason that he lied to congress last year is because of loyalty to the president. He wanted to be on the same page as what the president has been telling the public for quite some time #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Cohen said that he had reached out to a Kremlin spokesperson just by googling Kremlin on Google and he had not heard a response. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox: Michael Cohen told me in an interview that he would take a bullet for the president
.@emilyjanefox on Cohen: Today was the first indication that not only has he come clean, but what he has come clean about is important and will play a role in how this all plays out from the Mueller's team. #AMR
.@emilyjanefox on Cohen: He wanted to come clean, and that is what he has done in the past few months spending dozens and dozens of hours with the attorneys for the southern district #AMR
.@MarkWarner: I have said it before, you can't make this stuff up and I believe there is more coming from Mueller. #AMR
.@McFaul: If there is a cancellation, as there was one time when I worked for President Obama, it is coordinated between the two sides, and this is very different in that regard. #AMR
.@McFaul: He never criticized Vladimir Putin directly for attacking the Ukrainian sailors, and then the news about Michael Cohen drops and a few minutes later, he decides to cancel the meeting. #AMR
.@MarkWarner: You have one more shoe dropping in terms of his closest personal attorneys lying about ongoing connections with the Russians during his campaign. I guess they understand why Trump would cancel the meeting #AMR
.@MarkWarner: It begs the issue that with Mueller now moving onto producing more and more products we have to make sure that his position is protected #AMR
.@MarkWarner: I am not surprised and this is what we are seeing out of the affiliates of Mr. Trump and a fairly wide pattern that comes out of the President's group of lies. #AMR
.@MarkWarner: This is one more example of a close ally or associate of Donald Trump being caught lying about their ties and connections with Russians and the Russians’ attempts to influence the Trump campaign. #AMR
RT @davidgura: Of Michael Cohen, @MarkWarner tells @mitchellreports this: "I gotta believe he's got more to tell."
RT @davidgura: "It's a pattern that comes out of the White House, @MarkWarner tells @mitchellreports. "The destruction of truth."
.@Tom_Winter: This is not a one and done thing where Cohen met with the Mueller team or the prosecutors here on New York on one single occasion. This is ongoing for several months. #AMR
.@Tom_Winter: It is interesting to see where this goes. Not only with the Robert Mueller's investigation, but to see if it is going anywhere in New York. #AMR
.@Tom_Winter: We noticed that people from the special counsel's office, prosecutors and the people of the southern district of NY were in attendance and at that point we realized that it is something Mueller-related #AMR
RT @JesseRodriguez: Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) on with @mitchellreports right now @MSNBC reacting to Michael Cohen plea

.@kwelkernbc: The President and the legal team are really escalating the attacks against Mueller as if they are bracing for more shoes to the drop here #AMR
.@kwelkernbc: We are seeing this president increasingly seeming embattled and lash out at the special counsel, and lash out at Michael Cohen and he called him weak #AMR
.@kwelkernbc: There was so much pressure on the President to have a very different summit than the one he had in Helsinki, when he was said to have taken Putin's word over his own intelligence community about Russian meddling #AMR
Chuck Rosenberg: What they are doing is get him under oath on the record to admit his culpability to a certain set of facts that include Trump family members. Who will be charged and what they will be charged with, we don't know. #AMR
Chuck Rosenberg: Why are they doing this and laying out in detail in this criminal information his misconduct? It is because they want him under oath on this topic for subsequent reasons. #AMR
Chuck Rosenberg: Keep in mind that prosecutors don't need to charge Cohen with every single crime that he completed, because he pleaded guilty to eight in the southern district court and now a ninth #AMR
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: It shows that Mueller's prosecutors have now documented a business connection between the Trump organization, and Russian top officials, including the potential meetings of Vladimir Putin #AMR
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: Today’s guilty plea clearly demonstrates that Michael Cohen continues to cooperate with Robert Mueller's prosecutors #AMR
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: Michael Cohen will get a reduced sentence, because in court, they say that the maximum penalty of lying to the congress is five years, the government would recommend and not object to zero the six months. #AMR
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: The president is right that he could do whatever he wanted to do as business matters when he was a candidate and private citizen. The question is whether his public statements conform to what he was doing,

.@PhilipRucker: We were asking abt the declines in stock market &amp; GM plant closures &amp; layoffs and whether he fears a recession, he answered by tearing into Jerome Powell. We asked if he takes responsibility for it and who's to blame and he put it squarely on federal reserve chair
.@PhilipRucker: Trump has not been shy about the displeasure with Jerome Powell as the fed chairman, but his comments to us yesterday in the oval office were sort of a new level of discord with the fed chair. We didn't even ask him about the federal reserve by the way. #AMR

.@CLewandowski_: Paul pretended to be something that he wasn't. He pretended to be a contemporary of the President both in age and financial stature, and what we have found out since that time, it is all a false. #AMR
.@CLewandowski_: The crimes that Paul has plead guilty to, and found guilty of through a jury trial are things like tax evasion, money laundering and things that are fairly easy to prove, but those have nothing to do with the tenure of his time working for the Trump campaign.
.@CLewandowski_: All of the things that Paul has plead guilty to and convicted of took place in international consulting roles overseas, his tax evasion, and money laundering and all of those other things had nothing to do w the role when he was serving as chairman of campaign

.@CLewandowski_: Do I believe he should have opinion in solitary confinement? No, I dont. But I have never heard if President say that he had any interest in pardoning Manafort, and many of the crimes are not just federal crimes, but state crimes for which President cant pardon

.@peterbakernyt: What we have learned from all these impeachments is that the impeachment will not succeed if it's party line. Only if the president's party gets on board, not all of them, but some of them, is the only time they're going to be successful in impeachment. #AMR
.@carlsonmargaret on Trump's comments on Mattis: He gives solace to his base, they say oh, he's a democratic, so that completely removes his authority. And at the end of the exchange, he said, and I know more than he does. #AMR
.@RuthMarcus: The notion of a Trump cabinet without Secretary Mattis there is a much scarier place in my view. #AMR

.@kwelkernbc: The president's legal team are acknowledging that they are concerned about in-person interview, and the fact that it could open up the president to a perjury trap. #AMR

.@nedprice: Trump gave license and impunity to regimes around the world to carry out their worst impulses on journalists, on their critics and anyone who would criticize them. That is remarkable from the U.S. President. #AMR

.@gilliantett: The concern is that as American debt &amp; deficit is rising rising rising &amp; dramatically under this Republican government you are starting to see investors say, hang on a sec, bc we kind of forgot abt the debt in recent years, but maybe its coming back to haunt us all
.@gilliantett: The President is saying bc of midterms coming up we need to keep the economy growing, and those kinds of comments that Pres has been making in last 24-48 hrs are the things that undermine investor confidence, and thats frankly a dangerous time to do it right now
.@gilliantett: The corporate tax cut has been fueling the economy and it is like chucking fuel on the fire. The feds say that we can't have the economic fire burn too much out of control, or are going to have inflation, and so they are trying to damp it up. #AMR
.@gilliantett: A lot of the jokes of the market that a Halloween is coming early for spooking the investors in the markets. #AMR
.@gilliantett: When there is a lot of debt in the picture, which is absolutely the story of the U.S. economy, investors run scared. When that happens, they sell their bonds, and the interest rates go up in the markets. #AMR
.@kwelkernbc: The fact that the Pres wanted to get out ahead of this story personally, and he wanted to be his own messenger speaks to his way of governing, and his way of sort of trying to direct his own communication, and it certainly underscores the fact that he is emboldened
.@kwelkernbc: He’s been eager to talk to the press and eager to head up his own press department. #AMR
.@Olivianuzzi: The President is a little bit more relaxed I suppose if you are viewing the way he has been appearing in public and speaking to the reporters over the last few months #AMR
.@Olivianuzzi: The old saying of let Trump be Trump has taken over once again as it had in different points of the campaign. #AMR
.@Olivianuzzi: We don't see it a lot where we have high ranking members of the President's cabinet and the administration in a room with a reporter as he is trying to influence the story. I am glad it happened and I think it is revealing. #AMR
.@Olivianuzzi: It seems that he wanted to influence my story and then pulled out all of the stops in an attempt to do so. #AMR
.@gabegutierrez: We are told that 50 residents on the island have decided to ride it out, and the first responders could not get to them. #AMR

.@AndrewGillum: We are hopeful that when it comes to getting our FEMA assistance that it will be holding in place when we need to call upon it. #AMR
.@AndrewGillum: It is going to take some time to recover, but we are counting our blessings today, because it could have been a lot worse for us. #AMR

.@KarenAttiah: Right now we want answers either way. Whether he’s alive, whether he’s dead, whether he’s kidnapped. It’s harder not knowing either way. #AMR
.@KarenAttiah: Saturday Saudi officials said that they believed that he was murdered inside of the consulate. Saudis have been denying it maintaining that he left #AMR
.@IgnatiusPost: Nikki Haley is in play now any time any issue involving women's issues, foreign policy comes up, people will ask what does Nikki Haley think, and that is probably what she wants. #AMR
.@IgnatiusPost: When you lose the most prominent woman in your administration at a time when Trump’s relationship with women and dealing with issues that matter to women are a key concern of the country is trouble for Trump. #AMR
.@samstein: She had been politically at odds with Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign and brought into the administration sort of as a nod to the moderates even though she is herself quite conservative #AMR
.@SabrinaSiddiqui on Nikki Haley: They did not see her as being there for more than a couple of years, and so it is a question of when and not if. #AMR

@SabrinaSiddiqui on Nikki Haley:  A lot of people there always felt that the ultimately, she was in this position to raise her own public profile.
.@matthewamiller: The appearance of Rod Rosenstein walking down the stairs with the white house chief of staff is leading people to lose faith in the independence and the credibility of that investigation out of the Justice Department. #AMR

.@PeteWilliamsNBC on Kavanaugh: He sat next to Elena Kagan. They were chatting and smiling and joking, and that is the way it is going to go. #AMR
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: The chief justice did give the typical greeting when a new justice comes on, welcoming them, saying that he is looking forward to working with them in the common cause.
.@PeteWilliamsNBC: Justice Kavanaugh was a little bit more active than the freshmen justices are, and asked about a dozen questions. #AMR
.@JoshNBCNews on Nikki Haley: She was really the person in the administration best able to thread the needle and that is why it is a loss for the administration
.@JoshNBCNews on Nikki Haley: You wonder how much impact she could have had with those strong figures like Mike Pompeo and John Bolton also in the picture. #AMR
Wendy Sherman: There is no question that there would be a second summit, and the president wants it on the calendar as quickly as he can, and I would suspect before the midterms. #AMR
Wendy Sherman: The key question is who replaces her now? Will they be able to use the same finesse in dealing with not only the folks in Washington but those around the world? #AMR
Wendy Sherman on Nikki Haley: She has also been at odds with the administration, and in a careful way on many issues like human rights and sexual violence, and it is going to become more difficult in the days ahead.
Wendy Sherman: Perhaps Nikki Haley is looking at a seat if Lindsey Graham is attorney general and she wanted to get out before the mid-term turnover. #AMR
Wendy Sherman: No love lost to the UN for Ambassador Bolton. He does not believe in anything multi-lateral, and obviously, she represented the institution that he hates so much #AMR
.@KimberlyEAtkins on Nikki Haley: She has been able to be sort of like the Trump whisperer and not to just the moderate people, but to the world, other nations, and leaders who have turned to her to try to understand what the Trump doctrine was when it was not clear.
.@kwelkernbc: It was Nikki Haley who came out to defend the language of fire and fury, and it worked because it got the meeting with Kim Jong Un. #AMR

.@IgnatiusPost: Jamal Khashoggi was known in the Middle East as a fearless commentator. #AMR

.@MarvinKalb: I think that the motivation is that if (the President) can humiliate the press enough and say they are dishonest people, and he puts them on the defensive and when you are on the defensive you don't want to take on the boss #AMR
.@MarvinKalb:  I had only heard and associated "enemy of the people" with dictators of 20th century. Hitler used it, and Stalin used it and Mao used it #AMR
.@MarvinKalb: I did not want to write this book. It's no pleasure to be an editorial author, and I wanted to stay in the middle and write the news, but I did it because trump in February of last year, 2017 used the expression "Enemy of the people" in describing the American press
.@peterbakernyt: there's still so many unanswered questions and one thing that he could do if he wanted to help clarify them is to release the tax returns. #AMR
.@peterbakernyt: our colleagues have found is that years and years and years of the creative or the perhaps dishonest or the misleading bookkeeping meant that the Trump family was able to avoid millions and millions of dollars of taxes. #AMR
.@jwpetersNYT: this undercuts this mythology around Trump as a self-made man, and he not only had one trust fund according to reporting here of our colleague, but three trust funds, and loan after loan after loan from his father, and many of which were never repaid. #AMR
.@jwpetersNYT: what our colleagues did is to the look at thousands and thousands of pages of documents and canceled bank statements and checks, and to draw this picture of how intertwined Pres Trump's finances are with his fathers #AMR
.@peterbakernyt: This is the image that he has cultivated since the beginning of time in public life and long before he was in politics. He's written books, marketed TV show and ran for Pres that he's up from the boot-straps kind of figure #AMR
.@RuthMarcus on Trump: he is the most imperfect messenger of most imperfect message...he has had credible allegations of sexual harassment and sexual activity against him, and the empathy is in one direction and empathy is only towards accused perpetrator and never towards victim
.@RuthMarcus on Trump comments last night: it was sickening and maybe it is smart for him politically in the midterms to rally his base, but he has a short term objective which is not an audience of million, but an audience of three or four senators #AMR
.@RuthMarcus: What the President did last night was just sickening. Maybe we should only be surprised that it took him so long to do it, and he was able to follow the script of treating her with some respect for so long. #AMR
.@RuthMarcus: We thought that we were in a place of few short weeks ago where the women were going to be treated differently than they were in 1998 than they were back when we covered Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. #AMR

.@PhilipRucker: It is a rallying cry for white men particular who are fearful of the #metoo movement and feel like their sons and fathers and uncles and themselves could somehow be falsely accused of something and have their life or the career ruined #AMR
.@PhilipRucker: The Kavanaugh situation has been a galvanizing force for Trump's base and the Republican voters and the conservatives who care about the courts. #AMR
.@BillKristol: There's no deadline. The court doesn't have to be populated by nine people. So I think a lot will depend on how things feel at the end of this week in terms of the FBI investigation. #AMR
.@LamoureuxTwins: It levels the playing field for education for kids who don't have internet or don't have tools to access internet. And so just that 1 program that we've really-we've been traveling around country, creating awareness and educating ppl has been eye opening for us

.@SenatorLeahy: It is not the matter of if he drank as a youngster, but it is a question of whether he was truthful to the committee. #AMR
.@SenatorLeahy: Merrick Garland who was somebody who would have been confirmed with an overwhelming vote by Republicans and Democrats and held up for a year, and we had to move this forward in a week.
.@SenatorLeahy: when I was a prosecutor I wanted to get all the facts, if it takes a few extra days it takes a few extra days #AMR
.@AshleyRParker: Flake, as he has on a number of issues, often will make a lot of noise, sort of act in this kind of the mavericky way and then ultimately vote the party line. #AMR
.@AshleyRParker: The President said publicly that we need to get it over quickly, and that is the right sense that the longer it drags out, the more that may come out that is damaging to Judge Kavanaugh. #AMR
.@AshleyRParker: It is basically up to Senator Collins, Senator Flake, Senator Murkowski, and what the others think is not to say unimportant, but frankly unimportant. #AMR
.@Mimirocah1: Brett Kavanaugh showed himself as someone who really seemed incapable of showing that kind of objectivity, and that is very disappointing and sad if we are going to politicize the supreme court in this way now. #AMR
.@Mimirocah1: Supreme court justices of course they can have political views but they have to be capable of being objective and fair. #AMR
.@Mimirocah1: His political rage is just completely unbecoming of someone who is going to be sitting on the supreme court. #AMR
.@Mimirocah1 on Kavanaugh: 100% his demeanor needs to be taken into consideration. #AMR
.@FrankFigliuzzi1: I will strongly caution everyone not to think that this so-called expanded scope somehow has given the FBI free reign #AMR

.@JillWineBanks: I've seen FBI overnight be able to do amazing thngs&amp;discover what needs to be found. We need to focus on lying, bc if he lied abt anythng, whether its definition of boofing or devil's triangle, or how much he drank, it's the best argument you could make to jury
.@maziehirono on Dr. Ford: if she had behaved the way judge Kavanaugh did, I think it would be a total nonstarter for her. #AMR
.@maziehirono:  I'm not one of the Democrats who said that a week is too short. I did say my expectation is that the FBI will provide the resources necessary to do a complete job. #AMR
.@GeorgeWill: I think Jeff Flake did himself, the country, the supreme court and even his party a great service by slowing this down. The problem was that it became -- it was dismally predictable. #AMR
.@maziehirono: when he was asked specific questions about the meaning of the terms in his yearbook, anybody could go and find out that what the true meanings of those words were. And as Comey said, when you lie about something like that, it just points to the need to dig deeper.
.@maziehirono: it was unbelievable, the portrayal of himself as some kind of a boy scout, all he cared about was studying, going to church, doing projects and playing basketball or sports. It was pretty unbelievable to me. #AMR
.@maziehirono: I found totally bizarre&amp;astounding when Kavanaugh accused Dems of engaging in plot to do him in and dragged in Hillary Clinton. This is a conspiracy theory, this is what he believes, this is what hes going to take to SC. He was so partisan, that it was unbelievable
.@maziehirono: It's so limited, I called it basically -- I think the word farce would not be far off to talk about this so-called investigation. It is not going do get us anywhere near the truth. #AMR
.@KenDilanianNBC: of course the FBI would want to interview Judge Kavanaugh, and Dr. Ford. But neither of them are on this list of people. And I checked with an senior administration official who said that has not changed. #AMR
.@maziehirono:  It's not about whether he drank or not. But whether he lied about it. And the picture that is painted is that this is a person who drank a lot. Not just in high school but also in college, and that when he drank, he would become very belligerent and aggressive.
