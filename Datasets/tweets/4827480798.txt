Hoyer motioned to vacate the vote on the short-term CR (H J Res 28) and consider it de novo on Wednesday. Scalise thanked Hoyer and the chair (Rep. Butterfield) for working with him.
Republicans brought some papers to the floor, looked ready to offer a measure before recess was called. Scalise and Hoyer huddled after, amid the chaos. House in recess, some members and staff of both sides still on the floor, discussing.
Republican members yelled "shame" and blamed Dems for the shutdown, CA Rep. Tony Cardenas blamed Trump for the shutdown in response, and a Republican member yelled at him to "Go back to Puerto Rico"
Major drama on the House floor. Republicans say they requested a recorded vote on a CR through February but the request wasn’t recognized by the chair. The chair called recess and  both sides were shouting at each other.
