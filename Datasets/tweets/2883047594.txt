@lruskin @SethAbramson I would never say my "former wife", but rather my "ex wife", because it ended on a negative note. At the same time, I would never say "ex-President", but rather "former President", because often Presidents end their term in a respectful and dignified manner.
@lruskin @SethAbramson I think so. However, I've worked for several former military and law enforcement personnel and I can't tell you how often I got my hand slapped for saying "ex". While I agree both mean "used to be" "ex" is used when the situation ends on a negative note or reason.
