President closes televised Saturday address on #immigration compromise out of 29-day #shutdown: "Whatever we do, I can promise you this: I will never forget that my first duty and ultimate loyalty is to you, the American people."
President Trump: "Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense, with lots of compromise" in #immigration proposal to end #shutdown; @senatemajldr "has pledged to bring this bill to a vote" next week in the #Senate.
President Trump's plan pairs 3 years' "legislative relief" for 700,000 #DACA recipients with 3 year extension of 300,000 immigrants with #TPS.
President's $5.7 billion request "for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall.  This is not a 2,000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea.  These are steel barriers in high priority locations."
Initial plan outlined by the President includes $800 million "in urgent humanitarian assistance," $805 million for drug detection technology, additional 2,750 border agents, 75 new immigration judge teams "to reduce the court backlog of, believe it or not, almost 900,000 cases."
President Trump in statement at White House: "If we are successful in this effort, we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real, bipartisan immigration reform."
"Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame as it is all over the world.  Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction." - President Trump in statement
"Over the decades, many presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone, and no real progress has been made on immigration... There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. " - President Trump

.@SenateMajLdr reminds the #Senate of more to do once a #Budget2018 deal is adopted https://t.co/2uVHgGA8tj
Sen. Schumer: Our work here in Congress on this budget deal between the Republican Leader and I, between the #Senate and the House was completed without a great deal of help from the White House.
Sen. Schumer: We @Democrats would have liked to take up and pass the #ButchLewisAct. We couldn't reach an agreement to do that, but now we have a process and potentially the means and motivation to get it done.
Sen. Schumer: American families with children who benefit with #CHIP will now be able to rest easy for the next decade.
Sen. Schumer: After months of legislative logjams, this budget deal is a genuine breakthrough. After months of fiscal brinkmanship, this budget deal is the first real sprout of bipartisanship.
Sen. McConnell: The bill I move to, which will not have underlying #Immigration text, will have an amendment process that will ensure a level playing field at the outset.
Sen. McConnell: I hope we can build on this bipartisan momentum and make 2018 a year of significant achievement for congress, for our constituents, and for the country that we all love.
Sen. McConnell: This agreement will also bolster our ongoing national struggle against opioid addiction and substance abuse.
Sen. McConnell: First and foremost, this bipartisan agreement will unwind the sequestration cuts that have hamstrung our armed forces and jeopardized our national security.
