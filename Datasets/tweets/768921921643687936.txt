@Davesnothere_ Teach me the ropes on this money making. Our 401k is just moving slowly. Where tge investors put it, it's  making maybe 6k a year, we are contributing good, stocks up , but someone else is making the big bucks, sure as hell ain't us . Send me a pm
@Davesnothere_ And in AZ the lotto was supposedly for the roads, but Jan Brewer was using the money foolish and giving her staff fat raises and bonuses.
@Davesnothere_ As far as schools, they need to check into that and supervise what's going on, lots of schools the superintendents are getting way more than they should and less money going into the schools.
@Davesnothere_ @realDonaldTrump This cash assistance is bullshit for people to live off of,only deductions we get are mortgage interest,personal exemptions,medical. It's it's not much, but every bit helps.
@Davesnothere_ @realDonaldTrump If someone can't find a damn job in 6 months there a problem there.Lazy. By all means keep the food stamps to supplement the working families that need them for the ones with children and stuck in minimum wage jobs.
@Davesnothere_ @realDonaldTrump They should just keep the taxes how they are now, get rid of the death tax, drug test welfare recipients, make welfare a temporary assistance not a way of living. Cut welfare off completely after 6 months.
@eugenegu @FriedBaconBitz @realDonaldTrump He did that too

@Davesnothere_ I sure as hell do t want to pay more taxes than I already have to,you just said you have 500k in one account,you obviously make a hell of a lot more than 53k,if I made the money you make I'd pay that extra 5%
@Davesnothere_ And we are paying about 25% I get it it's not fair for families to be paying a death tax. But seems that's all the GOP is thinking of, the rich, why can't they just leave the fucking taxes alone and just get rid of that death tax they are talking about. I sure as hell don't want
