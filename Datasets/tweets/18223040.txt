Alexi: Biggest example of impact of court decisions is Citizens United. Court now is damaging our democracy #ilsen
It seems like Mark Kirk has a YES or NO answer when it comes to protecting corporate special interests.  #ilsen

Alexi: "I have to give the Congressman credit. He's a great politician. He didn't answer your question." #ilsen
Mark Kirk says groups should reveal their donors.  But will he tell Karl Rove to take down his ads? Actions speak louder than words #ilsen
Alexi: I am for full marriage equality. "We're going to look back and be embarrassed we didn't act sooner" #ilsen
Kirk claims that he's "totally confused" about  admin position. We're confused about Kirk's YES or NO, would he vote to repeal #DADT? #ilsen

Charles Thomas asks Kirk about his "voter integrity" squads."Can you explain whether this program is or is not targeted at AfricanAm" #ilsen
YES OR NO: Mark Kirk refuses to answer Qs about whether he was shot at, where he stands on #DREAM Act #ilsen
Alexi: "Just give them an answer, Congressman." #ilsen
Alexi: "I asked him a simple question. He refuses to give a position." #ilsen
Mark Kirk asked THREE TIMES to clarify stance on #DREAM Act.  THREE TIMES, no answer. #ilsen
Yes or no, Congressman, how would you vote on the #DREAM Act? #ilsen
"Congressman, if this came up for a vote, how are you going to vote?" Mark Kirk is afraid to say "no"? #ilsen
Mark Kirk again refuses to take a position on #DREAM Act, filibusters on border question instead. #ilsen
Alexi: Mark Kirk's evasiveness on #DREAM Act is "not leadership." #ilsen
Mark Kirk voted to bail out big banks and then voted against reining in taxpayer-funded bonuses #ilsen
Alexi: Mark Kirk voted twice to bail out the big banks but voted against helping states across the country #ilsen
Mark Kirk wants to "rollback spending" in Illinois. Which services would he cut? Again, platitudes but not specifics. #ilsen
