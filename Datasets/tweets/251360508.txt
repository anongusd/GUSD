@barbiedoll1959 @Davetopia777 @EdBernstein1 @realDonaldTrump The homeless starving veterans problem won‚Äôt be solved by adding more illegals. The homeless starving veterans have been that way for YEARS. It is a long-standing problem. Trump‚Äôs been in office 2 years; Obama 8 !! Were you concerned then or before Obama? Are you helping them?
@Alyssa_Milano @TaranaBurke What do you think of the Muslim treatment of women in their countries? That will become part of American society, given the left‚Äôs viewpoints. What then? Will you stand up for those girls and women too?
@RealJamesWoods And she‚Äôs giving the Go Fund Me for ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù lots of exposure! Thanks Alyssa!
@Ocasio2018 Hope that makes you realize the relative magnitude of fake news that @realDonaldTrump has been bombarded with. Fake news is a real thing.
@RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs not his fault he has been paralyzed by the democratic politicians. The voters voted for him and the wall too.
@thecaptain18078 @davidgadaskin @RealJamesWoods I‚Äôve thought about that too. Calif can be their own entity.
@davidgadaskin @RealJamesWoods There is one. I see it went up 2 mil overnight
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump WE THE PEOPLE want the wall. We voted for it. Stop Drug trafficking. Stop Illegal Immigration. Stop uman trafficking. Stop paying for benefits for  illegal immigrants.
@GameSpot How can you own dance moves? Maybe I made those up before Carlton was even born. Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sure I did.
@Amy_Siskind You are concerned about racism,  yet you yourself are racist with your tweets.
@Amy_Siskind Why does the color of hisnor skin matter? You are batentlh racist.
@DanCrenshawTX It is scary to see the MSM be one sided though. It can and does influence people. They don‚Äôt show much of what is REALLY going on!
@BKT2ROC @vflinc72 @RealJamesWoods Well said that sums it up!üëçüèº

@ViDaniels6 @Wbrest @MollyBrown28 @realDonaldTrump Your wins could very well be due to corruption and voter fraud!
@MollyBrown28 @realDonaldTrump Certainly was not a blue wave. But it sure would be nice for some to look at reality and see the apparent corruption. You are letting hate cloud  your mind. Are you really that blind to what is going on Molly? Should we all turn a blind eye to voter fraud?

@blondie19807 @FoxBusiness @SenFeinstein The answer is that she leaked it. Yes she knew the answer.
@foxandfriends You didn‚Äôt ask your staff about it Dianne,  because you knew you were the one to do it ! that‚Äôs the logical conclusion.
@FoxBusiness @SenFeinstein she didn‚Äôt ask her staff about the leak until she  was on national TV! What a fool she  made of herself regarding the leak! Only 3 people had the letter supposedly, and she NEVER asked her staff about the leak. Unbelievable
