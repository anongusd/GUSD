@mikefreemanNFL Amazing....but what was the wind speed?
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom Yeah, maybe. Unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath. Sadly. I hope for a good primary season with the results being a strong and unified democratic ticket
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom Indeed! A systematic problem. But people that voted in the primary voted in the general. People that encounter voter suppression didn‚Äôt vote in the primary. Blue states with less restriction to the ballot sanders did well in those states
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom Clinton won the southern states then trump won them in the general. Sanders did well in blue states and states like WI, PA, MI and OH.
@ktjazz14 I see the point and can agree but disagree with the premise
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom There‚Äôs a lot of political science data that proves that incorrect and low voter turn out not third party made a bigger impact
@Alllwftopic https://t.co/zYW5kquqXk
@LiberalPhenom @ktjazz14 Then you‚Äôre all set. If he‚Äôs truly not going to win and you can say that so confidently on day one I don‚Äôt understand all the attacks
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom Yeah, that‚Äôs a huge issue. Race does matter. That‚Äôs a big weakness. I hope he has a good team around him to improve his language on the topic. Not pushing back too hard on that one.
@LiberalPhenom @ktjazz14 So if he‚Äôs the nominee you‚Äôre voting for a republican and staying home in 2020?
@LiberalPhenom @ktjazz14 Cool. You‚Äôre pry a republican
@ktjazz14 @LiberalPhenom Yeah, Keith, you hate the man. I‚Äôm sorry for you that you have so much personally against him. Hopefully you can work that out. I want a better country and I can see a lot of people in 2020 that can do that. Don‚Äôt OD on hateraid

@ampay Yeah, sorry your president is a lair but you forgot the part when Aaron said this is damning and likely true. Right wingers care so much about lairs
@AnthonyDjphoto @PolishPatriotTM Seen??? His sources seen and are involved in. That‚Äôs the straws you a grabbing for? He reported what his sources know. Duh.
@ampay Yeah, if he had possession of the reports he would be in the investigation but he‚Äôs a reporter telling us what his sources said. How is that lost of right wingers
