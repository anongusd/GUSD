@HuffPost Too late, get fucked.
I really try and be cordial and respectful to the #Trump fans and the ultra-conservative and the ultra-biased here on Twitter, but sometimes it‚Äôs tough. But I‚Äôve found that showing them the #truth is far more effective than getting angry.
@PunditAngry @IngrahamAngle Here‚Äôs some light reading for you, dummy.	https://t.co/cJfv4NihE7
@DonaldJTrumpJr What do you expect when the grand wizard shows up?
@CNN Wow. Weak.
@AmbJohnBolton This asshole has had a war boner since he got hired
@nytimes So no need for a wall then. #CancelTheFakeEmergency
@realDonaldTrump @gtconway3d No deals have been made. You walked away from the summit. There is nothing to guarantee anything you just said. There's also no evidence to suggest they've stopped their nuke program. Just more lies from our shithead President.
@maryjveld @Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle https://t.co/hWLu465rzD		Some light reading for you. I know it's the "failing" New York Times as your lord and savior Trump would say, but these are the facts.
@maryjveld @Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle So just let an injured infant suffer until death?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TPUSA If it sounds like a Klan rally, and looks like a Klan rally...
@politico @DonaldJTrumpJr Gorsuch - Seat stolen by @senatemajldr 		Kavanaugh - Sexual predator		That's a good track-record so far.
@NormanGYoung @washingtonpost You're not very smart, are you?
@KyleKyFl @washingtonpost Oh. You're stupid.
@seanhannity So much hate here because she‚Äôs not white and/or not Christian. Scumbags.
@SaraCarterDC I'm sure you weren't invited to many parties, but more kids were eating Tide Pods than have ever had a "Skittles Party" in the history of forever. #CPAC #CPAC2019 #Gaslighting #SillyConservative
I love how the #Republicans against #Trump's #FakeEmergency are most concerned with Dems using the precedent for #ClimateChange. CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL EMERGENCY YOU FUCKWADS!
@daveweigel He's just running the family business. The old Falwell university down yonder.
@maryjveld @Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle Are you a physician? Have you read the bill in it's entirety? I already know the answer to this because of your blatant ignorance on the topic. Go do your own research and form your own opinions and stop getting your talking points from Fox News and Hannity.
This is hilarious and extremely infuriating at the same time. https://t.co/R2hK77IpqZ
@BillKristol It's amazing Hannity didn't immediately get on his knees as soon as Trump sat down.
@realDonaldTrump Someone's getting scared.
@realDonaldTrump I think Congress will be more concerned with demanding your taxes, Donnie. By the way, your behavior is far from that of an innocent man.
@justinamash Hey #MAGA shitheads. This is what a true American looks like. Country before party. Country before President. Take note.
@maryjveld @Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle So because some people from an opposing political party do things you don‚Äôt necessarily agree with, you no longer see them as your countrymen?
@Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle Democrats are Americans...
@Jimmyv221 @IngrahamAngle So Democrats aren‚Äôt Americans?
@IngrahamAngle Did you just compare American citizens to the fucking Taliban??
Vietnam is 12 hours ahead of the DC. The #CohenCongressionalHearing happened while #Trump was sleeping. There was no #TrumpKimSummit to cover during the #CohenCongressionalTestimony. No one wanted to watch that shit anyway. https://t.co/CiSKJprFYl
@HuffPost @SecNielsen @DHSgov @ICEgov @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP this is on your hands.
@CNN Oh shut the fuck up, Lindsey.
@ConservativeJC0 @seanhannity Surprise he made it back to the plane with his bone spurs
@seanhannity Still can‚Äôt make it to a real war zone. Hold on. Does Trump think Alaska is a foreign country?
@KAGOORAH @CNN Hmmm. Highly decorated Marine Corps. General (who's 4 years younger than Trump) vs. Boeing exec with ZERO experience.
@CNN Why is he dressed like a fucking Bond villain?

Hey @MarkMeadows, not a good look, bud. But we wouldn't expect anything less from a sad little weasel with his head lodged in #Trump's ass. #MarkMeadows #meadowsisaracist https://t.co/4GNc2NAXSh
This is my favorite thing. https://t.co/iQXg3MlL4T
@iammetx @seanhannity lol
@NickolRyan @benshapiro But it's what's surrounding it. You can't meet with a murderous dictator and spend the whole time complimenting him. You can't take his side on the death of your own citizen at said dictator's hand. You can't come back and say "we made great progress" when you didn't make any.
#JimJordan looks like he sweats through about 3 shirts a day.
@iammetx @seanhannity I‚Äôm sure he is #1 in his demographic. There are a lot of stupid people out there.
@seanhannity Two of Trump‚Äôs biggest brown nosers who will do/say anything to please their master. How convenient.
@scottwongDC Blind loyalty. It's ok. When the dominos fall, History will remember who was on what side.
@washingtonpost This just keeps getting better. I thought Trump was a master negotiator. Maybe this is part of his 4-D Chess strategy?
@NickolRyan @benshapiro What about 2 failures, because this was the second failed summit?
@iammetx @seanhannity I definitely don't get notifications but that's a good idea. Hannity is good for at least 10-15 minutes of humor every day. His idea of breaking, important news is really pathetic. Guess I shouldn't expect too much from someone who couldn't hack bible college.
@seanhannity Fox News, the pinnacle of journalism, everyone! "AOC EaTs A hAmBeRdEr!" Meanwhile, their master, #Trump, is on the way back from yet another failed summit with #KimJongUn. Very #lowenergy and very, very #sad.
camp aren't looking great. If my last name was Trump, I'd be pretty nervous right about now. #CohenTestimony #TrumpKim #TrumpFail
There's still no #wall, #Trump's #FakeEmergency is on the ropes, the second #TrumpKimSummit was a failure, #Cohen is dropping dimes like clumsy bank teller, and he just sided with a brutal dictator on the death of an American, #OttoWarmbier. I'd say things in the #MAGA (1/2)
@washingtonpost Oh, the guy who feeds people to dogs and melts people with flame-throwers didn't know about the American held captive in his highly controlled, American-hating regime? Sounds plausible.
@brianstelter @seanhannity Are you trying to tell me the college dropout, Sean Hannity, *doesn‚Äôt* know about foreign policy?
@RealCandaceO @MichaelCohen212 @OversightDems @AOC @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @GOPoversight seems she may have proof regarding some of Cohen‚Äôs testimony. I think she‚Äôs bluffing, but it may be worth looking into #CohenCongressionalTestimony #CohenTestimony #CohenHearing
@RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr @MichaelCohen212 Go for it. Show us the proof. My bet is you don‚Äôt have any.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I don‚Äôt think anyone is denying that he‚Äôs a liar or a criminal, inherently. However, today, what could he have gained by lying to Congress? He has everything to lose.
committed a crime, regardless of political affiliation, then you are a disgrace to your country. #MAGA (3/3)
already very well aware of. They did this out of loyalty to the #GOP, loyalty to #Trump, but most importantly, they put their political agendas over their country. If you do not see the importance of finding out whether or not the man occupying the highest office of the land(2/3)
#Republicans embarrassed themselves today during the #CohenTestimony. Instead of looking for the truth in the name of our country and in the name of justice, they set out to smear #Cohen; a job already very well done; and they intended to paint him a liar; a fact we were (1/3)
Didn‚Äôt think failure would be this apparent this early on in the #TrumpKimSummit. Still not sick of winning! #MAGA https://t.co/NC7Hq1UfRV
Imagine how mad #Trump is right now that seemingly no one gives one far-flung fuck about the #TrumpKimSummit while #Cohen goes in on his whole family!
Watching @RepGosar lecture a former attorney on professional conduct and responsibility is hilariously weak. Go get an MD, Paul. #CohenTestimony #DentistsArentDoctors
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is sad. The only thing you have is #Cohen saying he didn't want to work for the White House when he, apparently, did. From HOURS of the #CohenTestimony, this is the keystone to your case against him? Do better, Junior.
It's weird how, outside of #Trump world, being a Trump ally doesn't bring great outcomes. Who could've guessed? https://t.co/rpjJlkRrU5
@MarkDice @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Good! Send him to prison! But first, let's get this evidence against #Trump!
#Republicans and #Trump supporters: "#MichaelCohen is a lying liar who does nothing but lie. How can you trust a word he says?"		Meanwhile, every time Trump flaps his fat neck, you're guaranteed to get at least one lie. 		This is all very, very pathetic for the #Right
@AmericaFirstPAC @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanspicer We WaNt EvErYoNe To WaTcH oUr SaD pOlItiCaL sTuNT!
@nytimes We all know #Trump loves him a good dictator!
#Republicans are acting like #Cohen is a friend or some sort of secret weapon; No, absolutely fuck that guy 100%, but it's important to get the information he knows. #CohenTestimony
@MaxBoot @brianstelter COHEN'S TESTIMONY IS ABSOLUTELY 100% FALSE! OH! HOW DO I KNOW? HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT A JOB AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN HE TOTALLY DID! - Republicans
@BoDietl @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @POTUS THIS is what the #Right is hinging on. "He SaiD hE diDN't WaNt A jOb At ThE wHiTeHoUsE bUt He ToTalLy diD! I hEaRd HiM!" Good for you. Now let's get back to what's been said about our dirtbag President.
@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr But #Trump is a pathological liar as well. I'm not seeing the strategy here. "Let's try and defend our untruthful leader by calling his ex-lawyer untruthful."
The really, really, really, really sad thing about the #CohenTestimony is that regardless of what #Cohen says, the #Republicans will continue to turn a blind eye to what #Trump has done and continues to do. They are loyal to Trump, not the United States of America.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Let's be honest, you'd probably just say you couldn't recall.
Anyone else find it ironic that the #Republicans came to the #CohenTestimony with the intention of painting him as a liar who can't be trusted, yet their lord and savior #Trump is, as far as anyone can tell, a pathological liar. The difference being #Cohen is not the President.
@IngrahamAngle Well Trump is a compulsive liar, yet you defend him blindly at every turn.
@charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle Should the media arrest him? I‚Äôm not sure I understand your gripe.
It should be noted that the primary allies in speaking out against #Trump are doctors, lawyers, educators, politicians, etc. while those supporting him are media talking heads, forgotten celebs like @RealJamesWoods, and some lady named Diamond Silk #sad
@DonaldJTrumpJr I disagree with the majority of what you say, but I will agree with you on this. Being transgender is absolutely fine, but it is unfair to compete in athletic competition with females if you were born a male.
@realDonaldTrump This is a patently untrue characterization of this bill. Your position comes with a responsibility to be open and honest and this is yet another example of your inability to do so.
It‚Äôs really sad to see how #politics have consumed so many people in the worst ways. We should be striving for a better #America together. Republican, Democrat; it doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre all Americans.
This, 100%. #JussieSmollet did a bad thing. If he was a democrat, a republican, a libertarian, a socialist, a communist, etc. it would be equally bad. Let‚Äôs stop looking at political affiliation and start looking at right and wrong. https://t.co/K9KEeLoy2l
Hey, you know what‚Äôs stupid? Fighting. Wanna know what‚Äôs worse? Fighting over politics. Let‚Äôs think back to our kindergarten days and use our words. https://t.co/QHDy2UtABv
@funder Just to play Devil's advocate, if the questioned was posed as "Have you ever socialized with Trump in the presence of females under age 18" he may have plead the 5th because that's a pretty loaded question.
@SGijora @charliekirk11 Is it possible that this whole #JussieSmollettHoax isn‚Äôt political, and that he‚Äôs simply a shitty person who did a shitty thing?
@spacecowlady @CNN This is the most measured response I‚Äôve seen to political fuckery in like, 3 years. Bravo.
Do you know what #JussieSmollett and #MarkHarris have in common? They‚Äôre both liars and they both did shitty things. Their political views don‚Äôt matter. Nor does their race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. They did shitty things and deserve appropriate punishments. Period.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Would you be willing to admit that right/conservative media companies show the same bias?
If you allow anyone, and I mean ANYONE, to form your opinion on ANYTHING, without first making your own informed judgement, you are a weak person. Do not allow media talking heads, political pundits, or anyone else shape your opinions of other people. Make your own judgements.
@IngrahamAngle @JussieSmollett This tweet is ridiculous. He took a photo with Obama so that adds to some sort of liberal conspiracy? This kind of poor reporting and irresponsible gaslighting is what continues to drive a wedge between us. Shame on you @IngrahamAngle
The #JussieSmollett case is a perfect example of letting our "all or nothing" attitude get in the way of logic. What he did was bad, but it surely shouldn't be a left vs. right issue. One bad apples doesn't spoil the entire bunch, and that's true for BOTH sides. #ComeTogether
@Naterjake4115 @ChuckDingwall @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo No need for Law and Order episodes. I let my JD help me come to these conclusions.
Does no one else realize how ridiculous it is to judge a person solely on their political affiliation? You're mad because someone else wants things to be different that what you want? Do you hate people who enjoy foods you dislike too? #Unite #ReallyMAGA #ComeTogether
@WhiteHouse That is a great quote, but it's hard to take it seriously given the President's tweets and statements that continue to serve as wedges between people of different political ideologies. We must ALL work to unite once again, despite our differences.
@AP This hoax does a disservice to the LGBTQ community.
@BillKristol This is one of the biggest problems facing society today; everything is black and white. You can still enjoy someone's music, someone's acting, someone's company despite having different political beliefs. Remember when your political views were private?
@TuckerCarlson To say Fox News anchors have complete freedom seems to be untrue. It's obvious that Fox is very right-leaning. Also, the audio of this interview shows very clearly that you were out-classed and it made you mad. If you're confident in your position, you would have posted the audio
@ChuckDingwall @Naterjake4115 @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I agree. If I were a betting man, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs most likely guilty of something, especially considering the whole situation.
@Naterjake4115 @ChuckDingwall @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo But that‚Äôs not how investigations work. You don‚Äôt stop digging when you find a piece of gold, you dig more to find it all. Any prosecution is going to want all the evidence they can get to make any charges stick. This is all assuming there is wrongdoing in the first place.
