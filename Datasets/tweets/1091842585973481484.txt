@Mustachio441 @operativeY @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump You don't "need" to see any of the president's returns. They're none of your business. 		What kind of moronic logic are you using to suggest that you do have a right to see them? (Hint: Don't look in the Constitution or U.S. Codes).
@Mustachio441 @operativeY @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Uh, the president's tax returns -- like mine and those of every other American taxpayer -- are none of your business. They're none of the public's business. What part of that don't *you* understand?

@realDonaldTrump Hell yes. The only way this gets fixed is to hold my media (clown) brethren to account. 1st Amendment doesn't abide libel and slander.

@jamietworkowski #loser alert: The Aurora killer was a convicted felon who was ordered to turn in his legally purchased gun in 2014 but cops never followed up and, well, gosh, the existing laws failed. 		Let me repeat that. "The existing laws...failed." Don't you feel stupid? You should.

@waltshaub @neal_katyal How so? The law says presidents have the authority to declare national emergencies. Disdain for this president is a lousy legal defense. But you can try, I supposed.
@neal_katyal The argument can be made, convincingly, that "I didn't need to do this" means he wouldn't have had to if Congress had done its job and allocated funding like he asked. Prediction: SCOTUS will uphold this declaration.

@LevNovak @mcbill @NYCMayor Uh, you didn't save jack. And you don't *now* have $3 billion to spend. By chasing Amazon off you blew $27 billion in tax revenue; the $3 billion was a tax break...a discount on taxes owed. Never had it. And now, you never will. #stupidnumbersgames

@RedonDont @tedlieu Yes, it is a legal term, and it also happens to matter. Lieu "believed" statements and then demanded action on his beliefs -- that Fairfax step down.
@RedonDont @tedlieu @POTUS I'm sure you felt the same way about Bill Clinton. Or Hillary, for that matter. She's been accused of doing a lot of things.
@GreenMan207 @kathiefoko @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No, those are *your* "facts."
@GreenMan207 @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @HillaryClinton Why you gotta bring up the man's race? What is it with you libs -- so obsessed with skin color.
Great news. https://t.co/CcyxtZYM6e
@tedlieu @VP @mike_pence @POTUS Dear @tedlieu:		Ever been to the U.S.-Mexico border? Ever camp out there for a couple weeks? Dare ya.
@7thdaughter1 @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Just got on here this week, but thanks for perpetuating the Russian bot lie. I was wondering how long that would take. #libsarepredictable
@GreenMan207 @kathiefoko @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I see you're still able to recite your daily Democrat talking points. Good for you.
@GreenMan207 @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He gets it by virtue of winning the office, in this case by beating the most corrupt prez nominee like, ever. @HillaryClinton
@RedonDont @tedlieu Right. So having a law degree in Lieu's case clearly hasn't taught him that facts matter more than political partisanship and virtue signaling.
@RedonDont @tedlieu 2) U make my point. If Ted was in charge @POTUS (and Reps) would be removed from office on mere accusations not evidence and proof. The Joe Stalin Legal System, as it were.
@RedonDont @tedlieu 1) It is if we're talking about calling for someone to step down. And I don't care what Lieu's legal credentials are; you don't "believe" someone into being guilty. I graduated MCL with a masters in intel analysis but that doesn't qualify me to run the CIA. ...
I don't know. I've always found Democratic 'oversight' to be a joke. 🤣 https://t.co/kO2imuN2eK
Spot on. If only Democrats understood this. https://t.co/MG0gEsRghG
@tedlieu So glad Democrats like you aren't in charge of our justice system. It's not about who you believe it's about what is and isn't true. LG Fairfax -- like Kavanaugh before him -- deserves a fair process that should be allowed to play out.
@tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The "American people" include Republicans and @POTUS. Let's see you "demand respect" for them as well. I'll wait.
@kathiefoko @tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It is none of those three. You must be thinking of Obama again.
True story. Thank you @DanCrenshawTX for being on our side. https://t.co/BUxmwrhOTw
@tedlieu @AdelAljubeir @KSAmofaEN @ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump You have to earn respect @tedlieu It's not automatic and you don't get to demand it. And @POTUS legacy will be around a lot longer than you and yours. Live with that.

@_waleedshahid @AOC No, but thank you for at least being honest about what her BS plan really IS: A socialist wealth redistribution instrument in the same vein as what Venezuela did.

@RepMarkMeadows But Americans got to see that, especially Americans who may have been on the fence about who to support in 2020, so that's good for @POTUS and America in general.
@HeyTammyBruce Well, they couldn't stand up for it either when Obama was president because employment numbers for all demographics, women included, were horrible. So there's that.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Well, since the president isn't guilty of anything, how 'bout you concentrate on really important stuff like border security, military readiness, infrastructure, and -- did I mention border security? 🙄
@GovMikeHuckabee Apparently not. Democrats love their reps selfish, self-centered, anti-American, and all about the agenda.
