@ananavarro Congratulations Ana, felicidades!
@PressSec @EliStokols I guess we are now living in an age where official gov statements regarding "national emergencies" are declared via screen shots of iPhone notes
@BBCBreaking Perfect. Then SCOTUS can tell him no and Congress can keep the gov funded.
@EliStokols I thought the colosseum held 7500
@RoKhanna I’ll delete all 3 if so
@AndyKGenova @Poravi76 @WomensHealthMag @alroker @JillianMichaels 1. Doctors and dieticians ARE qualified to speak. Literally my point 2. The statements she made were riddled with inaccuracies and 3. There are many different voices in this field, plenty of positive keto research. More to learn
@jaketapper Allez les blues
@joerogan You did a great interview. I enjoyed hearing yall’s conversation
@yashar Ya. California one is for sure wrong. Buffalo chicken dip FTW
@PeterAlexander @yashar Open open open!
@realDonaldTrump Hey I actually agree with this. Stunned silence. All right
@farmdaughterusa @JillianMichaels She is a personal trainer. Not a nutritionist or a dietician and certainly not a PT (physical therapist). She has nooooo business giving nutrition advice
@Poravi76 @WomensHealthMag @alroker @JillianMichaels She is not an expert. Not a doctor, a scientist, a nutritionist, or a dietician. She is a “famous” personal trainer
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Shasta county California voted for him. I’m guessing they won’t next time
@RobertMaguire_ @realDonaldTrump And the county in NorCal affected were his voters. The only people he allegedly cares about
@CNN Recent? Uhhhh
@ericawerner @seungminkim He should deliver the rebuttal tonight
@Reuters Only the 3rd playoff win for the cowboys since 1996 🙌🏼🙌🏼
@Reuters First
@Sethrogen I used to lifeguard when he swam
@brianklaas *calls
@realDonaldTrump Your most classic tweet
@ananavarro It’s in the 60’s in LA today too 😭
@benshapiro Your comment is in pathetically poor taste
@yashar @ATT @ATTCares They gave everyone here in the areas affected by the fires with their service free unlimited text, calls, data for 2 weeks
@DavidAFrench It’s low because our policies are working
@LACoFDPIO @LACOFD Thank you firefighters 🙏🏽
@foundmyfitness It makes sense to me. I have celiac and eating GF obvi does a lot to keep my body from attacking itself, but to decrease bloating/water weight and blood glucose I have to also reduce sugar, refined carbs, and eliminate all grains as well. GF doesn’t mean healthy
@DanRather Agreed 🙌🏼. And it’s now over 1000 missing
@CalebJHull Bless your heart
@CNN Over 600 missing and over 60 lives lost. I’ve seen drone videos of the entire city of Paradise charred in ruins. This should be all over the national news
@voxdotcom Everyone who was affected by this fire deserves some grace. It’s not a class war. These are wonderful communities where neighbors help neighbors
@BBCBreaking Thank you for actually covering this on national news. People need to hear
@Ocasio2018 Beautiful response. Spread the light
@NewsHour Thank you for actually covering the fires on national news
@thelocalmalibu I sent this to Dive n Surf/Body Glove who is taking a daily boat of supplies from Southbay to Malibu
@AliVelshi @KateAurthur https://t.co/w9ifGjVONE
@AliVelshi @KateAurthur Cover stories like this: https://t.co/BNmR0FwKnx
@AliVelshi @KateAurthur We don’t need you stand in the fire. Just report it
@krassenstein @NRA Its been a week since Thousand Oaks. You’re not even mentioning that
@iamphilhunt That’s a really sad argument. Even if it were only rich people they are still people. But it cuts through rich, poor, young, old... maybe if it were on the news you would see that
@krassenstein My state is on fire. There’s that
@KateAurthur @yashar I was thinking the same thing. And the deaths at Borderline were only mentioned for 2 days. All I hear is election coverage. It feels dismissive of our community
@CNN So did Melanie
@CAL_FIRE This warms my heart ❤️. Thank you to these states and the brave firefighters!
@Sparkster7 @KrisMul @LosAngelesFires They have been evacuated now
@NBCLA @JuliaBrownley26 Be safe
@DanCrenshawTX @DavidAFrench @nbcsnl I’m really impressed by you! Including your natural comedic timing. Never forget
@timneufeld @realDonaldTrump Thanks for speaking truth to power! FYI Malibu is in the Santa Mountains and although it is “chaparral”, there are plenty of forested areas. A beautiful city I called home for 9 years ❤️
@ReaganBattalion Can some please montage all of our past presidents in the rain?
@RogueNASA Can someone get a montage of all of our past Presidents in the rain serving our country
@LAist I used to teach swim lessons at a house by this cross street. I hope everyone there is safe ❤️
@robreiner Naaa. Lady parts are beautiful and strong... and not afraid of getting wet
@wildwestpie @realDonaldTrump 250k evacuees and 10 million of us breathing ash
@realDonaldTrump Over 250k evacuated and 10 million of us are nearby breathing ash
@ndblackirish97 @APWestRegion @AP I care about what these people have lost. Some things are not replaceable
@realDonaldTrump California is known as a "donor state" because we pay more in federal taxes than we receive benefit from. We grow 1/2 the veggies, 2/3 of the nuts and fruits, 9/10 of the wine in the US. We are full of good people who deserve empathy in times of need, jerk
@tauruselissa @krassenstein I’m sorry to hear you had to evacuate. Happy you’re safe. Malibu was my home for 9 years. I hope the state and local aid and our community steps in until we can force that a-hole to provide federal aid. -your neighbor in Hermosa
@FrancoisArango @realDonaldTrump Fifth largest
@shanelseedeecby @realDonaldTrump Malibu is in the Santa Monica Mountains. Plenty of forest.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously fuck you. We are Americans suffering, and you are the President
@joerogan Be safe 🙏🏽
@Alyssa_Milano Be safe 🙏🏽
@CNN I had a giant ramen burn on the back of my hand for years
@brianschatz Reece’s. No, mostly a one quarter spike followed by most key leading indicators pointing to end of our good run. But hey.
@realDonaldTrump Please stay out of my sporting events. Not everything is about you
@goldengateblond @slpng_giants This 😂
@voxdotcom No
@charliekirk11 Did you know: Democracy is dying in Hungary? As a proud Hungarian-American it is heartbreaking to see their freedom falling to nationalism and fascism before my eyes. Don’t try to glamorize it
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Be best?
@ChelseaClinton You’re a beautiful woman. Thanks for having grace and class
@jaketapper 😳😳😳
@ananavarro My thoughts exactly. He needs help. I hope his family can reach out to him and get him help
@voxdotcom Yup
@Lawrence I calculated earlier today actually: Wyoming-ites have 35x more power per capita in the senate, 1.33x house, 3.85x electoral college than each Californian. Yet CA provides the goods that keep these small states afloat. BS! The system needs to be reconfigured
@jordanbpeterson If I were Canadian, I’d feel blessed that I didn’t have to be part of this at all and not put my words into the angry mob where there is no way to come out on top
@mkraju @Acosta @jeremyherb I’m proud of her. If only others on the fence voted their conscious
@krassenstein It should be called a FEMA alert, and it should be controlled by FEMA and local agencies (not a notorious bad speller/poor judgement user), and I hope these lawsuits let us opt out. I’m ok with getting them... but not being forced to
@EliStokols A rare moment of vulnerability and honesty. I’m speechless
@Eater Um.
@sapinker And then they made rules of decorum like not calling out or pointing at another Senator that have been followed since the 1860’s including Jim Crow, McCarthyism, and Vietnam... until...Thursday?! 🤮Let’s get it together. Respect.
@ananavarro This article is brilliant. So well done. Logic and reason over feelings, hyperbole, partisanship. Really impressed
@ARmastrangelo @benshapiro It was Kanye’s right to protest, but he shouldn’t be surprised if other shows/venues/companies don’t trust him to follow rules in the future. America baby.
@ARmastrangelo @benshapiro I don’t know who Alana is, but Ben should be above confusing ignorant people by RTing it. Guests on tv shows are asked to follow that show’s directions. It’s not bullying and not infringing on 1st amendment rights.
@benshapiro Today has brought out some ugly human demons, but you are better than this comment Ben
@Garro415 @LandonWall_ @RubinReport Naaaa everyone loves JR
@TexasTribune @tedcruz @NBCDFW The blonde moderator seemed almost hostile, definitely unfriendly, to Beto. Enough to be distracting. Both candidates sound too scripted and Beto is best when he is real. Cruz was “true to form”
@FrankLuntz @tedcruz @BetoORourke I love Beto, but next debate he should act less scripted and more real like on the campaign trail. Cruz can’t match him at his best. True to form
@LandonWall_ @RubinReport Joe Rogan is an open-minded, free-thinker
@realDonaldTrump This is more of a greatest hits tweet. Like you type the first word and then keep picking the middle suggestion from autocomplete
@CNN @CillizzaCNN 1. Pence 2. Ivanka 3. Haley
@realDonaldTrump Top 3 guesses: 1. Pence 2. Ivanka 3. Nikki Haley
@realDonaldTrump You got ratio’d bro 😮
@MikeDelMoro I thought the same thing. “He” uh? Maybe it’s Sarah herself and it’s a cover. Tricky
@KamalaHarris We need to support increasing housing supply to keep up with the CA population so rent comes down to more reasonable rates on its own
@THR Vandalism is vandalism. The star walk is part of local tourism, and she is hurting the interests of the city. She should have the same punishment as the guy who jackhammered the original one
@RubinReport @TeamYouTube I know your theory is a left wing conspiracy against you, but this happens to almost every channel I subscribe to from comedy to entertainment to the really random stuff. That being said, it sucks when I miss new content bc of it!
@benshapiro Paper straws are pretty great alternatives. It’s an easy and effective switch. There are bigger problems out there these days
@MattWalshBlog Paper straws are fine
@realDonaldTrump Seriously, seriously just thought this was the parody account I follow
@RealDonaldTrFan Cake 🎂!!!
@realDailyWire @benshapiro I always listen to you as a conservative counterpoint but am regularly disappointed by the lack of respect you have for many groups of people and sweeping generalizations and gas lighting that you should be above
@RubinReport Huh? Why don’t you just watch the video if you’re so concerned about the way others have digested it?
@realDonaldTrump I keep wondering what the lowest thing you will say is, and so far this is it. I just wanted to respond for the sake of history that proud Americans everywhere were put to shame today by a US President to our enemy
@benshapiro What wasn’t this the first tweet in the thread? And that other part is quite a generalization to begin with...
@benshapiro Not homophobic just to joke he has a schoolboy crush. Especially after the crap that just happened. Please don’t equivocate 🙏🏽. Bad summit, end stop.
@KetoConnect It’s so hot out! Green smoothie: 2 eggs, spinach, avocado, tumeric, ginger, small handful of blueberries, ice. Cool and refreshing!
@cdLockett @benshapiro @billmaher These conversations are important. We need more of this kind of dialogue 👏
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Haha you realize red wave means you’re on your period right 😂? You do you
@krassenstein Too late
@WildgirlAthena @SundyBoBundy @jay_says_that They said because she was also credited as a show creator not just actor the entire show had to be canned to fire her. They have to do a spin-off...
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro I find it super weird that top secret FBI documents can be written in such a casual style, and that someone that educated  mixed up “their” and “there” (if anyone else caught that)
@Graham__Hancock Angry and sad!
@RandPaul Thank you so much for reading the bill, but this is really blowing up my feed 😜
@ZachMcGough2 @RubinReport @KyleKashuv I know you are saying that to tease people because we all think of those things as daily life, but yes, there are people that don't have an ID and can't do any of those things either. Weird to think about
@jpodhoretz @benshapiro This young lady has lupus and a kidney transplant. Her body is filled with nasty medications, and she is just happy to be alive, enjoying time on the water. Send her love, not whatever this is
@LylakNightangel @benshapiro The book was released today 🤦‍♀️. Ohhhhhhhh
@SenJohnMcCain That is serene! Thinking of you Senator
@jordanbpeterson @Twitter @scrowder @joerogan @RubinReport @h3h3productions YouTube is a private company, so I guess it can regulate its content as it pleases? Maybe build a new platform? I agree I don’t see why this video violates terms of use, but I totally understand why SXSW politely asked y’all to leave. Shock jock shtick 101
@MeghanMcCain @benshapiro I love Meghan, but I have been noticing some of these things lately too. I like it much better when The View ladies have respectful debate
@VinnieB4free @RealSaavedra @benshapiro The man they were targeting used to be a spy who gave a bunch of info against Russia
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro It’s weird that so many people’s first reaction wasn’t pure anger at the evil person who did this, likely a Russian agent, someone who would have access to nerve agents that aren’t typically used by civilians because they ARE regulated and difficult to aquire...
@politicalelle @benshapiro Principles over profits
@realDonaldTrump @benshapiro This is the first (and quite possibly the only) tweet of yours I have “liked” or will like, but I give credit where it is due. Keep listening to the people of this country
@marcorubio Thank you for showing up. Yes, it’s your job, but it still takes courage to walk into a building with 7k who have raw emotions and disagree with you. I am happy that you are listening and that some of your positions are evolving. This is what America is all about 🇺🇸
@quinncy @benshapiro I don’t agree with @benshapiro on much, yet I follow him.... so.... 🤷🏼‍♀️. The disclaimer is probably wise though!
